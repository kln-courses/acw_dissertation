<plain_text> <page sequence="1"> Photojournalism’s White Mythologies:  Eliot Elisofon and LIFE in Africa,   1959–1961 RAoul J. GRANqVist umeå university, sweden raoul.granqvist@gmail.com ABstRACt this is a close study of the LIFE photo-essay “A Writer’s land of Primitive,  Eloquent Beauty: storied World of Africa” (1961) by Eliot Elisofon. His dou- ble-faced essay contains eighteen photos, which he took during extended  travel on the continent in september–December 1959, and fourteen literary  extracts from the Western canon that accompany the visual material. i iden- tify the socio-political context and the visual/literary conventions within  which the photos were taken, explore the photo-essay’s racist storytelling  and panoptic and mythological viewing of Africa, and allege, tentatively,  the LIFE essay’s duplicitous role in Cold War American politics of the time.  the LIFE essay solidified time-worn mythological concepts of Africa cham- pioning them as pseudo-historical facts with particular regions as their  strongholds. East Africa was depicted as Animal Eden; Apartheid’s south  Africa, as balanced Boer Freedom; Congo, as the land of savagery; West  Africa, as Nakedness. the purpose of the LIFE essay, i demonstrate, was to  trivialize and demonize the post-colonial process in Africa. Eliot Elisofon’s  1959 trip contained three other projects, two of which (a coverage of “new”  Nigeria and extensive aerial expeditions) were implicated in the same LIFE  narrative of Cold War stewardship. i discuss these two only provisionally. that fact and fiction, history and myth, or the assumptions contained in each of these categories, cannot be separated is hardly a contested assumption. the “two” interpenetrate each other making the territory of their interaction,  particularly in an African context, a fertile ground to examine the dialectics of  hegemonic centrist belief systems. in fact, the rhetorical fallacy of difference that  has beguiled the Western relations with Africa has a long history of discriminatory  • REsEaRch in afRican litERatuREs, Vol. 43, No. 3 (Fall 2012). © 2012 • </page> <page sequence="2"> RaOul J. GRanQVist • 85 obscuration. the perceptions of myth have been championed to be promoted  as historical facts, those of history degraded into mythological chimeras, yet in  whatever direction they have moved, they have solidified rigidity and ignorance  about the subject in the process. the categorizations of African time as not exist- ing, African people as discontinuous groups, and African landscapes as sublime  canvases for the Western eye, have emerged as hard facts with immense influence  on politics, museology, media, and education. the “popular” viewing of Africa through stereotypes and clichés of this  ontological content, when advanced by an American nationalistic media giant  such as LIFE with its 8 million readers worldwide throughout most of its lifetime  (1936–1972), must have been enormous, to say the least. LIFE’s photographs of  African people, events, sites, fauna, flora, and animals claimed to tell it all from  within the magazine’s own cultural and aesthetic perspectives. the photographs  were indeed totalizing, all-inclusive, and remained undisputed, at large, by the  American readership until the early 1970s. A subdivision of them rehearsed the  infantile sagas of the “savage land,” appropriated as conciliatory innuendos in  American Cold War politics in Africa that this article contends. through commercial agencies and archives the same photographs operate  continuously as active or nostalgic mediators of a forlorn world. “[P]hotogra- phy remains one of the most enduring and focused instruments of documenta- tion, regardless of its fragmentary constitution, falsehoods, and mise-en-scènes”  (Enwezor and Zaya 23). “Documentation” in partnership with “fragmentary  constitution, falsehoods, and mise-en-scènes.” How is it possible? My starting point for a discussion of a single LIFE essay, Eliot Elisofon’s “A  Writer’s land of Primitive, Eloquent Beauty. storied World of Africa” from 1961  (Elisofon, “A Writer’s land”),1 are the two questions by okwui Enwezor and  octavio Zaya in in/sight: African Photographers, 1940 to the Present: “Can decon- textualized images be facts contained within an embellished history?” and “Can  they represent an empirical record of experience or serve as objective stand-ins  for history?” (21). these questions summarize aptly the major objective of my  inquiry: to explore in depth the “truth” behind the platitudes of the essay title, to  drain the “embellished history” with its two nouns “beauty” and “world of Africa”  and their three modifiers, “storied,” “primitive,” “eloquent,” of their nerves. I  will identify the addressed “writer” and decompose his alleged affiliations with  Africa. to achieve these goals, i will dig deep into the circumstances of Elisofon’s  travels and the visual conventions that generated the photographs, seek informa- tion from his fieldnotes, examine the African sociopolitical context in which the  photographs were produced, check up on individual photographs in the essay  and the appended literary extracts, and reconfigure their contextual bearings on  the photos of which they became part. My unhesitating “yes” to Enwezor’s and  Zaya’s questions is a way of ascertaining the need to account for the width of the  processual intercontextual “reality” by which the photo-texts were informed. Even  the charm of a picture of Victoria Falls can be a colonial lie, a replica then of its  myth—a thick lie. i have listened to Robert Young’s call: “[A] major task of post- colonialism must be the production of a ‘critical ethnography of the West’ [Homi  K. Bhabha], analysing the story of a West haunted by the excess of its own story”  (Colonial Desire 163; also White Mythologies 124). An example of such excess is the  essay under scrutiny. </page> <page sequence="3"> 86 • REsEaRch in afRican litERatuREs • VOlumE 43 numbER 3 the photographic essay contains eighteen color photos, including the cover  image. Four of them are spread across two pages and another three extended  across a space of a little less than two; six are designed for one page, and the  remaining five accommodate 60–70% of a single page space. Their visual con- tent alerts and engages the eye with an engrossing power that so many of  LIFE’s photographic pages do. But what is unique for this LIFE magazine essay  is that it requires more from the viewer than an ogling, appreciating browse.  For a full appraisal of it, its ideal reader ought to be familiar with the Western  canon of literature about Africa. Each photograph (except the cover image) is  not only appended by the traditional captive one-liner, which Elisofon and his  colleagues were experts on construing, but a literary extract of 50–200 words. in  other words, each photo has its own literary emissary or the other way around.  Elisofon’s select group of writers were: Joyce Cary* (2 works), Winston Churchill,  stuart Cloete*, Joseph Conrad*, Andre Gide, Geoffrey Gorer, Ernest Hemingway*  (2 works), Rudyard Kipling*, Vachel lindsay*, Alan Moorehead, Alan Paton*,  theodore Rooseveldt, Henry M. stanley, and laurens van der Post (the asterisk  signifies “fiction”). Of these fourteen writers, three were born in Southern Africa  (Cloete, Paton, and van der Post), all the others (except lindsay) had spent some  qualified time, or had traveled, in Africa. At a slide show at Boston university in october 1961, two years after his “liter- ary” travel, Elisofon explained to the students that he had collected one hundred  texts to go with his panoramic narrative of melancholic Africa in all (HRC 53.34).2  His prime intention was to do a literary photo-book of Africa, which never hap- pened. His itinerary narrative from the 1959 African trip is littered with a resource- ful bank of literary extracts. Most of them served as prompts or incitement for him  to identify a visual object and mount the photo session accordingly. the eighteen  photographs thus became palimpsests of extreme Western overwritings, erasing,  renaming the place, the language, and the interactions of environment and culture  in which they were generated. A clever stealth was to take place. LIFE magazine’s  juxtaposing of two Western traditions of mythologizing Africa, the literary and the  visual, by this way of dislocation and alienation strengthened the idea of American  Cold War control. this was the whole idea of the LIFE essay. Elisofon’s selection of  literary texts opened up historical venues into Africa, from stanley’s preparations  in The Congo (1885) for King leopold ii’s brutal regime to Moorehead’s peaceful  safari through wildlife’s Africa in No Room in the Ark (1957). He would not see his  aggregations as problematic or anachronistic. His application of the established  visual conventions, well-known to any African traveler since the expeditions of  the two brothers livingstone in the 1860s, was drafted creatively to dialogue with  what he considered was the ethos of a Western literary heritage. His “storied world  of Africa,” bathing in an illusion of symmetry, harmony, and knowledge, was  construed, i will show, through acts of manipulation and deceit. Elisofon, on his  side, would call his idealistic dreamworld respectful of both Africa and the LIFE  magazine’s readership, and me, deceitful and wrong. i have organized my discussion of “Africa’s savage Beauty” (as the essay was  labeled on the magazine cover) in four sections: Eden’s East Africa, Apartheid’s  south Africa, savagery’s Congo, and sexuality’s West Africa. in the conclusion  i discuss the politics of the LIFE essay, reflecting on its disassociating from the  struggle for independence in Africa between 1959 and 1961 (the time span between  </page> <page sequence="4"> RaOul J. GRanQVist • 87 his field trip and the date of the publication of the essay) and the ambiguous  circumstances of his thematically extended travel. Eliot ElisoFoN’s EARlY tRAVEls to AFRiCA By this time (1959), he was, relatively speaking, an experienced traveler to Africa.  Apart from his time as a war correspondent in Morocco/tunisia, where he was  assigned for LIFE to the Atlantic fleet (1942–1943), he had made three journeys to  the continent. The first in 1947 was a five-month solitary drive from Cape Town  to Nairobi via Victoria Falls, livingstone Museum, Amboseli game reserve, the  Maasai and English-settler communities in Kenya/tanzania, and a ten-week Nile  trip from lake Victoria to Cairo.3 it also included a stretch of traveling in Nigeria,  liberia, and Mali later in the fall. His reporting from “new” Nigeria fell into the  traditional paradigm of “change” in the writing of Africa, positioning itself on  the other side of the present essay and proving Elisofon’s open-ending, complex  commitments. His first Nile trip, on the other hand, was important as the incep- tion of his most ambitious and best known photo-monograph, The Nile, with an  introduction by laurens van der Post, one of his favorite writers (Nile).4 the ritual  “masculinization of motion” (leed 220), as Elisofon’s ethics, policy, and method  of travel could be characterized, was formative of his investment in the colonial  themes of visual incorporation. the 1947 African journey included, most importantly, a brief stay in Belgian  Congo, in the leopoldville (Kinshasa) region, where he was to initiate a life-long  pursuit of “African art” that meant collecting, photographing, and writing about  it. these activities went on side by side. Here he also met the Kuba king Mbop  Mabiinc maKyen of Mushenge and made a celebrated portrait of him, discussed  in detail by Christraud M. Geary (“through the lenses”). together with a second,  a group photograph of the king’s “350 wives,” they were inserted in his book The  Sculpture of Africa (Sculpture 6–7) as exotic frontispieces of deviation and exuber- ance.5 Customarily, the king and the photographer exchanged gifts. the king  offered Elisofon an old pipe with a man’s head for the bowl, a cup in the shape  of a hand, and several boxes covered with intricate designs and animals in relief.  the ground for his collection of African artifacts was being laid, a collection that  eventually would amount to 800 pieces (staples, “Visualism” 182). Elisofon, in his  turn, gave the king a “a gold-looking heavy neck-chain that cost exactly forty-nine  cents” at Woolworths, a camera, and 500 franc (HRC, 10.1, report 24 Jan. 1947). the  lopsided mode of bargaining was a colonial norm that he practiced as a collector  in Africa.6 Elisofon’s next journey to Africa took him to northern Congo, to the upriver  port stanleyville (today Kisangani). His commission was two-fold: to act as a  color expert for John Huston’s location shooting of the film “The African Queen,”  starring lauren Bacall, Humphrey Bogart, and Katherine Hepburn, and to make  a photo story about the small raft as a workplace for the film-team on the Ruiki  river, in the village of Biondi, 160 kilometers south of stanleyville.7 A film that in  Jann Matlock’s words figured “the whites [as] resources of their own interests”  and Africa as a grotesque geography of mud and baboons.8 Elisofon’s narrative  from his days with the film team adopted a similar colonial slant. The African  staff of 28 women who carried water, the 14 boys who rowed the equipment, and  </page> <page sequence="5"> 88 • REsEaRch in afRican litERatuREs • VOlumE 43 numbER 3 the 1 private policeman, he wrote, “did not like to work, being lazy by nature . . .”  Bacall got her “baked beans, clam chowder, fresh tomatoes” directly by air from  london (and not stanleyville) and did not complain (HRC, 16.18).9 i cannot resist  counting the moon years that separated the life conditions of the two women,  the female water-carrier and the American actress, bonded for a second by a few  square meters of mushy soil on an African river bank! two years later Elisofon, and his wife Joan Baker spear, went on an expedi- tion to climb the Rwenzori Mountains (on the uganda-DRC border) to photograph  the landscape. thirteen of them gave up but Eliot, the stubborn and the brave,  with a swiss Alpinist, and “the only porter with shoes” continued beyond the  12,400 feet camp level and Elisofon could finally take a series of photographs that  are claimed to be the very first color pictures of the wet fauna in the heath region,  its wind-bared rocks, and Mt. stanley. stanley had climbed the heights in 1889  and had his illustrator make an image of what he saw, Elisofon’s expedition was  number six, a figure that he never missed to mention in his cataloging of Stanley’s  and his crossings on the African paths. Elisofon’s famous “Mountain of the Moon”  pictures and those of animal life (in all twenty-one) in adjacent Albert Park (now  Virunga National Park) were his contributions to the LIFE special issue on “Africa,  a Continent in Ferment” (May 4, 1953, 75–85) that i will say a few words about in  its forerunner capacity of the 1961 one. The advertisement for the issue claimed that the five photographers that had  been sent out by the magazine “had encountered enough material for an H. Rider  Haggard novel.” that LIFE used Haggard, the extraordinarily popular African  storyteller at the time and the smart liberal (British) imperialist, as a springboard  for their formidable 170–page publishing venture, was editorial tactics of the  double-talk. By all means, it advocates, marvel at what you see and read about  an expansive continent but moderate your expectations and, above all, beware  of what might happen! the bulletin board of the New York Daily News (April 30,  1953), in flaunting the forthcoming LIFE issue, formulated an ominous scenario of  the “explosive continent of Africa,” housing the lapse of the ivory Coast’s into “a  laboratory for native self-rule,” the “murders by the Mau Mau,” the “vague hints  of Communist filtration in a land that supplies half the free world’s uranium” and  the “crushing victory of the ‘white supremacy’ government of Daniel Malan” (his  anti-British unity Party winning the election on April 17). it is from within this  context of Cold War awe and insecurity about what was happening in Africa and,  more accurately, what should not happen that Elisofon had reentered the scene in  August 1959 with cameras and novels by Haggard in his luggage. the white myths  of Africa were to be activated, LIFE must have thought. The itinerary narrative of his five-month trip in 1959 (from Nairobi to Cape  town, lagos, and Kinshasa) was littered, as i have mentioned, with annotations  about what particular lines or passage from the writers agreed in some way with  his camera eye’s view of this particular animal, this Rift Valley escarpment, this  “type” of African rite. (or the other way around with how the text extract added  depth to his visual interpretation.) He emulated, copied, reproduced, “illustrated”  (the word he used himself) the texts in this dialectic way. the “African” book selec- tion that he traveled with was imposing, including (apart from the ones he used in  his essay) writers such as Karen Blixen (Out of Africa [1938]), Julian Huxley (Africa  View [1931], Aldous Huxley (The Sorcerer’s Apprentice: A Journey through Africa [1948]),  </page> <page sequence="6"> RaOul J. GRanQVist • 89 Robert Ruark (Something of Value [1955]), osa Johnson, Married Adventure: The Lives  of Osa and Martin Johnson [1940]), Emil ludwig (The Nile: The Life Story of a River  [1937]), and Peter Abrahams (Mine Boy [1946]). the last one was, i believe, the only  book in the whole collection that was written by a black African. A thick Western  filter shrouded Elisofon’s literary Africa. EDEN*s EAst AFRiCA Elisofon’s second stop in Kenya-uganda was a logistical copy of the 1947 one. in  a letter from Nairobi (March 31, 1947) to his boss in New York, he had outlined  his photographic East African venture: “we have to include,” he wrote, “the  physical features of the country, its inhabitants both Africans and wild animals.”  there have to be pictures of mountains, plains, rivers, lakes, the Great Rift Val- ley, and the indian ocean part of Mombasa. interesting animals, he added, were  giraffes, buffaloes, zebras, flamingos, rhinos, and elephants. His taxonomy of  “original” specimens must include, he specified, “the native African who still  lives in Kenya [sic]” and, naturally, portraits of the white settler (about whom the  conditional clause “who still lives” would have been more appropriate) (HRC,  10.5). so closing in on Karen Blixen’s perceptions in Out of Africa, his camera tried  to emulate her metaphor “giraffes as rare flowers,” Julian Huxley’s “volcanoes  like ripples” (at lake Navasha) in Africa View, and a scene of Maasai bloodlet- ting of cows in Robert Ruark’s Something of Value. Blixen and Hemingway were  his favorites. of the six East Africa images in the LIFE photo essay, two relate to humans,  three to animals, and one to a natural site (Murchinson Falls). As we saw, Elisofon,  by conventional automation, verbal/visual lassitude, or exclusionary racism, syn- thesized animals and “native Africans” into the imaginary of one. His amalgama- tion seemed to be a rational assumption. Elisofon was absorbed (as was his time)  with the “noble savage” romance that the pastoral Maasai, in a blood-line conjunc- tion with their cattle, embodied par excellence. Elisofon took hundreds of photos of  blood-letting Maasai warriors and blood-eating Maasai girls during his trips to  the Kilimanjaro region. the picture in the LIFE essay of a young couple, captioned  as “Young Maasai warrior in Kenya talks with village girl” (EEPA, 1959, Maasai,  57938 12),10 connoted the myth’s primeval bliss and peace, here, demonstratively,  in stark conflict with the unnamed violence of the Mau Mau revolt that had been  fought not far away from the olengaitoli village, where this picture was taken. its  serenity would not be fully dressed without its biblical innuendos; generic Adam  and Eve communing in a paradisaical flirt. the photo was backed up by the u.s. President theodore Roosevelt’s almost  half-a-century old anthropological description of men and women in a Maasai  kraal with its “fine shaped savages” (“The men were tall . . . Thotmes or Rameses”)  (167). in his travelogue, Roosevelt thanked Christian missionaries for opening  up the East African “paradise” and propagated that “in these parts every effort  should be made to favor the growth of a large and prosperous white population”  (102). the annexed lines from Roosevelt were metonymically controlled by their  ideological and textual provenance, impregnating Elisofon’s photo-essay picture  further. its innocence was as false as Blixen’s lyrical savannah epiphanies that  Elisofon referred to frequently in his fieldnotes. In a paper called “Literature and  </page> <page sequence="7"> 90 • REsEaRch in afRican litERatuREs • VOlumE 43 numbER 3 society,” read at a teachers’ conference in Nairobi in 1973, Ngugi wa thiong’o  castigated Blixen, “a writer in the racist tradition,” for construing in Out of Africa  a cosmos with “God at the top followed by the white aristocracy, ordinary whites,  domestic animals, wild animals who are all in ‘direct contact’ with God” and  leaving Africans “as parts of wood and stones” outside of her creation (17–19). He  could have attacked Elisofon’s wild-life Eden with the same fiery ammunition,  had he read this photo-essay. Kikuyu people were excommunicated from Elisofon’s gallery of deified  types, disqualified probably as being either brutal freedom fighters (“terrorists,”  in today’s parlance), humiliated loyalists, or simply “not enough original.”11 set- tlers were more than welcome. in 1947, he spent a week with the Pitt-Moores, a  British coffee plantation family in the Kambu district. this time (1959), he hung  around Erik Rundgren, a professional hunter with Ker &amp; Downey safaris, ltd. (a  company that still exists), and took pictures of a taxidermy outside Nairobi (EEPA,  Kenya, hunting, H 4 KEN 1.0.1 EE 59), which was mounting and selling poached  elephant feet to serve for waste baskets and buffalo skulls for ash trays (an activity  with which he did not sympathize). it was the wild game reserve’s dirty backyard.  Rundgren was the photo-essay’s prototype of a British (swedish?) settler entrepre- neur. “tough ‘white hunter’ Erik Rundgren scans Kenya bush” read the caption,  contrasting his masculine authority with the Maasai couple’s feminine laid-back  chatting. Rundgren surveyed the landscape, controlling it, as it were, in a posture  of appropriation that the generic African would not be permitted to adopt by  the colonial photographer (EEPA, Kenya, hunting, A 4 KEN 14 EE 59 EEPA EECl  777). Anonymity’s African’s look was absorbed by the colonial camera or lost in  predetermined activity. Arriving in Nairobi in late August 1959, Elisofon confronted a country four  months ahead of the clubbing of eleven detainees in a Hola concentration camp  and only two months ahead of the closing of all the Mau Mau camps. Kenya was  touching the end of a British terror regime, the worst in the empire’s colonial his- tory; however, the state of emergency was still in operation (until November the  same year). Meeting tom Mboya, the devout Pan-Africanist in Nairobi (he was  killed in 1969), and photographing him at lengthy sessions, Elisofon was naturally  at an intellectual forefront of the situation in the country. Yet, this momentous  time of transition right in front of his camera seemed to have left him cold as ice.  Not a word in his fieldnotes, not a picture taken in clear support of the British  withdrawal to come. His loyalty was chained to the nature of his LIFE commission,  which jarred resolutely with the political development in the country and on the  continent. Elisofon hardly invited Hemingway’s anti-hero Francis Macomber in  the short story “the short Happy life of Francis Macomber” (“You can drive . . . i’m  so expensive” [“Macomber” 15]) to dismember the tough white hunter Rundgren  or forecast his precipitant exit from the land to which he had no right. No, on the  contrary, the extract extolled manhood in the embodiments of big-game fiction’s  Robert Wilson and safari tourism’s authentic Rundgren. “the European improving  eye,” writes Mary louise Pratt in a much-cited sentence, “produces subsistence  habitats as ‘empty’ landscapes, meaningful only in terms of a capitalist future . . .”  (60). Rundgren’s “scouting” eye of the Edenic “Kenya bush” forecast a very near  future when Roosevelt’s elite hunting of 400 African porters was to be replaced  by exploitative international tourism (see Akama; Frömming). </page> <page sequence="8"> RaOul J. GRanQVist • 91 Elisofon’s East Africa photo gallery included three mammals: the zebra, the  leopard, and the elephant, with their literary appendages. His fieldnotes never  invoked religious references. Yet here, notwithstanding his secular thought base,  in scrambling for the perfect match of the animals and the textual worlds and  the urge to fill their “emptiness,” tradition’s biblical fantasies formatted an Africa  safari narrative of innocence. (innocence meaning contentment and its biblical  opposite, knowledge meaning the good or the bad.) “A zebra herd races across a  grassy plain in the shadow of Ngong hills near Nairobi,” ran the LIFE zebra cap- tion. its literary counterpart had dislocated the scene, evoking running zebras in  Nyika National Park in northern Malawi, instead. laurens van det Post’s sensu- ous captivating of “the drumming of the hooves . . . the rhythm of their speed  moving in waves across their shining flanks, charged over the crest and made for  the pool where the leopard lay” tapped into Elisofon’s pictorial representation of  another race for risky survival that was neither good nor bad, only—natural (van  der Post 236). the connection between the ingredients that contained his photograph of  “leopard snarls in ubangi-shari [Central African Republic] jungle,” the second  photo, formulated another Jungian reflex of the primeval unconscious (see Soy- inka 1–36). Alan Moorehead’s adjoined lines about his first African sight of “wild  animals in their natural surroundings [sic],” the “tense vitality in their movements,  an element of challenge in their glance, that immediately diminishes you . . .”  (11–12) also played with the wilderness theme, allegorically attesting the game  park’s (or the colony’s) sovereignty as allegorical safe haven (for the white man).  Also, here, Elisofon had manipulated the geographical provenances, Eden’s bor- ders being eclectic. Moorehead did not watch leopards from the inside of his car  in a Central African jungle. He did not watch leopards at all. the animals that he  had run into were indolent kudu bull browsers in Kruger Park (Johannesburg)!  the “challenge” against his manhood that he talked about was as hypocritical as  Hemingway’s. Elisofon’s third animal session depicted “A young elephant in Kenya game  sanctuary [Aboseli] helps nudge a baby to his feet.” (Note the religious connota- tions of “sanctuary!”) Pictorial anthropomorphism found an outlet in Elisofon’s  choice of Rudyard Kipling’s creation fable of “the Elephant Child” (71, 76), another  interlineation of the theme of “Maasai” innocence and immaturity. Fundamental- ist eurocentrism no doubt ousted any errant thought with the American about the  possibility of engaging with an African creation fable instead of Kipling’s. the last photograph in this section related to the landscape category of the  visual sublime, one of Elisofon’s favored photographic genres and more directly  to the noun “beauty” in the essay title. We have already paid tribute to his stun- ning color pictures of the “Mountain of the Moon.” other celebrities that he could  not resist were sites such Victoria Falls12 and Murchinson Falls near Victoria Nile  in uganda. Certain features in the African landscape were more important than  others for the Western photographer. Mountains, confluences of rivers, waterfalls,  cataracts, panoramas, the profiling of the shores, savannahs, and the jungle had  been the given constituents of Western observation of Africa for centuries (see  luig; staples “safari”). Elisofon fell into the Victorian stereotyping of the African  landscape with a light heart. He was particularly enthused to be able to reinter- pret with his camera visual comments by the greats, John Hanning speke, David  </page> <page sequence="9"> 92 • REsEaRch in afRican litERatuREs • VOlumE 43 numbER 3 livingstone, and, in particular, Henry Morton stanley. His choice of Winston  Churchill, another giant, as his voice over for Murchinson (165–168) was self- evident. the visual impact resulting from the power of the bursting water masses  in Elisofon’s photograph and the word “roar” of its caption matched Churchill’s  depiction of the falls exploding in “magnificent fury.” The two merged in the  artistic convention of the sublime excess. the opposite page in the LIFE essay  contrasted the Murchinson fury with a somnolent gliding boat on the “peaceful”  Congo river (see the Congo discussion below). Anne Morrow lindbergh’s travel sketch of “A safari Back to innocence”  [“immersion in life, Journey to East Africa”] (88–94, 97–98), apart from integrating  four of Elisofon’s safari photographs,13 sums up, handsomely, i propose, most of  the aspects that i have discussed in this section (lindbergh). Five years after the  publication of Elisofon’s photo-essay, she composed the following homily for LIFE: Meeting great flocks of Masai cattle grazing dry hills one slips further back to  biblical days of Abraham and his descendents, counting their wealth in cows.  Here a herdsman—some Masai David his staff erect, in his earth-red robe— stands ready to defend his flock from lions. Down inside the enormous extinct  crater of Ngorongoro guarded by its arm of mountain walls, one stands like  Adam among animals fresh from the Creator’s hand in the Garden of Eden. (94)  . . . In Africa one sees it as if for the first time, like a child or an artist. Perhaps,  ever, like a saint, one focuses with that “absolutely unmixed attention” that  simone Weil equates with a prayer (98). An innocence of cultural callousness, blindness, and denial. What sexy “lions” did  she and LIFE magazine fear, i wonder? APARtHEiD’s soutH AFRiCA the double-page that harbors the two south Africa photographs was gracefully  organized with the first photo’s taking in the visual representation of a man  with a rope leading eight oxen and a wagon in an Indian file. Behind the retinue  is another man on horseback. the sun is setting (we know this also from the  fieldnotes); the distinct contours of the equipage are black as sin and the horizon  lightly encouragingly brown. it was: “Century-old voortrekker wagon recrosses  Transvaal veldt.” The image extends across the upper one-fifth of the two pages  like the movement of the caravan that it simulates. We know that Elisofon took  the photo on september 29, 1959, in Potchefstroom, a city 120 km west-southwest  of Johannesburg during a historical reenactment commemoration of the 1838  extension of trekking. The second photo that covers four fifths of the two pages,  with the exclusion of a half-page spaced for the literary extracts, depicted another  masculine progression, less optimistic and spirited, against the background of  an enormous and bulky pile of quartzite rock: “Johannesburg miners walk back  to compound after day’s work.” He took this picture at Daggafontein Mines, an  Anglo-American corporation, one of many gold mines in the area at that time. it  was in the city springs, 50 km east of Johannesburg. the visual narrative of the two pages connotes movement, contrariness (the  upper procession is to the right; the one beneath to the left), power, organization,  time, nostalgia, and dreariness.

GRanQVist • 93 Cloete’s The Turning Wheels (193–194) and Alan Paton’s Cry, the Beloved Country (34),  interact with the two photos? in contrast with Elisofon’s peregrinations in East Africa, his south African  travel was straightforward. His travel plan incorporated the topics that eventu- ally materialized on the LIFE pages. First, Elisofon and Jane met a trekker veteran,  Pieter l. Ferreira, 91 years old, at Enkeldoorn (now Chivhu), a small city in Masho- naland, 146 km south of Harare; the first white settlement in Zimbabwe. Ferreira  was “a lieutenant in the Rhodesia Horse during the battle of Chigarra,14 which was  fought a few miles from Enkeldoorn in 1896 against the natives in revolt,” Elisofon  wrote in his notebook, and continued: We shot him for quote about Boer necessity for space and freedom, from Cloete’s  Turning Wheels, and quote about “the whole of Africa was theirs while their  wheels would roll.” there are not many around who made the trek . . . so we  shot this old man wearing his medals [one given him by Cecil Rhodes] (HRC,  26.4, travel itinerary). this portrait-picture did not do. in Potchefstroom, a week later, he was fortunate  in running into the event that provided him with a series of photographs of his- torical trekk enactments. “[t]he whole of Africa was theirs,” wrote Cloete and  nothing in his 28-line extract (“Rootless, the whole of Africa . . . between their  big cloven hoofs”) modified Elisofon’s initial statement of faith. Just the opposite!  the celebration of the Boer “ties of kinship; religion and war their bond” received  the American stamp of approval. Elisofon’s or LIFE’s snap adoption of the nostal- gic trekking image with the eight oxen and the two men facing the sunset, had  rebounded. the “white” frontier myth of penetration, idealized by Elisofon as  the “necessity for space and freedom,” has always had many admirers and was  irresistibly American. He liked the Boers. the second photograph has a far more somber setting. He photographed  “machine boys” drilling blast holes in quartzite rock 2000 feet down in Daggafon- tein mines, “shoveling boys, winch drivers, tram boys, haulage boys.” He would  also take pictures of coal miners in Enugu (Nigeria) the next month. He had Peter  Abrahams’s Mine Boy in his pocket, quoted from the novel in his fieldnotes, and  must have considered using him but opted for the more conciliatory Paton in the  end. the quote (“We come from transkei, and from Basutoland . . . for all south  Africa is built on mines”) did tell what it all was about, but candidly. LIFE did not  mediate to their readers—with Mine Boy as a vehicle—the hard facts that black  labor and American money were the backbone of mining in Apartheid’s south  Africa. in all, the narration of south Africa in the photo-essay was ambiguous: an  endorsement of racist Boer political ethics and criticism of the apartheid state’s  exploitation of black Africans in the mines, or, differently argued, each storyline  eroded that of the other, as if conclusions were left open for the viewer/reader to  consider. </page> <page sequence="11"> 94 • REsEaRch in afRican litERatuREs • VOlumE 43 numbER 3 sAVAGERY’s CoNGo No epistemological concept is richer in the meaning-production of cultural deg- radation and Eurocentric self-reflection than “savage/savagery.” The sum of its  shifting applications reads as a condensed history book of the Western view of  the other in its thousands of costumes, from military uniforms to the harlequin’s  motley rags. My intention here is to deconstruct its historical specificity as a visual  marker in Elisofon’s dual narration of “Congo” and perhaps add another specimen  to the term’s crowded wardrobe. the six photographs that formulated his Congo narration consisted of four  images that overtly characterize masculine aggression and humiliation of the  other; the two remaining, in contrast, sensations of rest, beauty, and harmony (the  sublime). The first three that I will discuss emanated from the same photographic  session of around 40 shots, many of which were focused on a single, not identifi- able, individual who readily came to typify a “race,” a “tribe,” or an “African  savage.” on the cover page of the LIFE magazine edition, this man was initially  tagged as a threat: a “Wild Warega Warrior poised for attack.” Grim-faced and  dotted, he was caught in a posture of pointing his spear at the camera or rather  he was directed to do so (EEFA, 1959, Congo, dance, F 3 lGA 1 EE 59, EEPA EECl  5284). the same man reappeared on the last page of the essay, now in a zoomed  close-up of a facial paroxysm, intimating staggering fury at the other/the viewer.  the caption is repeated: “An exited battle-prepared Warega tribesman prepares  to hurl his spear” (EEFA, 1959 Congo, dance, F 3 lGA 1.1.2 EE 59. EEPA EECl  5291). He is “wild” no longer but ready to commit the bloody act! Rightly i mused,  contrapuntally, am i being threatened for trying to name the lacunae of the LIFE  essay? the reading of the sixteen appended lines from Vachel lindsay’s racist  poem “the Congo” (176) (“then along that riverbank . . . to the Mountains of the  Moon”) brings, of course, no solace. “ ‘Blood’ screamed the skull-faced, lean witch- doctors . . .” Elisofon had choreographed this photo session of the lega initiation  dance in Kabila village in Kivu province (DRC) with lindsay’s horrible lines as  his prompts. What naivety of reader response did LIFE count on? in the EEPA data with regard to these two pictures, a passage from Daniel  P. Biebuyck’s Lega Culture had been invoked to explain their cultural frame of a  lega initiation act called lutumbo lwa kindi. it may generally be applicable, only  that the sequence of Elisofon’s mass shooting with its persistent focusing on the  single dancer’s mimics and movements and, consequently, that the latter is more  in communion with the dominant cameraman than absorbed by the demands  of a cultural rite-system, but it undermines its relevance. i suggest that Elisofon  here, as he frequently did when his quest for “authenticity” failed, bought what he  needed: here a local dance with which he could intervene, for the sake of getting  the perfect savage photos. the choleric aggression à la lindsay that the pictures  expressed was in perfect conjunction with the fantasy of what “savagery” might  hold, but seemed out of tune with what Biebuyck understood as the main ethical  principles of lega culture. lega men did not hurl spears on strangers. the society safeguards the moral and social code necessary for the lega to  live together in harmony. For example, it teaches filial respect, marital fidelity,  </page> <page sequence="12"> RaOul J. GRanQVist • 95 nonviolence, and cooperation. Bwami is also the political power that allows the  lega to live at peace with their neighbors (Biebuyck 68). in the next photo-making séance with “An old Warega tribesman of Congo  [who] squats under a tree” (EEPA, 1959, Congo, lega, portraits A 3 lGA 2.2 EE 59.  EEPA EECl 267), a caption that is only spatially true, the photographer’s guidance  was very precise. His script, a collage of lines from Joseph Conrad’s Heart of Dark- ness (24–25) (“the men were enemies . . . this bit of white thread from beyond the  seas”), highlighted the mythic riddle of the “startling” white thread against the  black skin. Following the Conradian script, Elisofon had theatrically wrapped a  strip of white cloth around the anonymous lega man’s neck.15 What was the codi- fied meaning of the white thread that so many Conrad scholars also have struggled  with to decipher? Within the frame of the same quote and (rhetorical) question,  hides the complimentary anecdote of Marlow offering the dying slave “one of  my good swede’s ship’s biscuits” (Granqvist, “Romance and Racism”), which  lines (and story) Elisofon had omitted, i assume, not to dismantle the unity of his  storyline. We can, again, follow Elisofon’s directions in his step-by-step shooting  of the genuinely miserably looking man, creeping in and out of his nest (EEPA).  Elisofon’s photograph emits strong feelings of abandonment, and knowing its  manipulation, within me, also of disgust.16 Even more so the next, “Men of the Wagenia paddle in the rapids of the  Congo” (EEPA, Congo, transportation, l 3 ENi 2.1 EE 59. EEPA EECl 9603), a  hymn to muscular manhood as exhibited by a crew of “fishermen” at the Boyoma  Falls near Kisangani.17 it is not the backwash of its powerful visual language of  body and muscles that troubles me but with what a catastrophic theme that Eli- sofon loaded it. its hermeneutic key was Henry M. stanley, the British-American  explorer whose acquisitiveness, pragmatism, and visual sense of details, Elisofon  admired to the extent that he, in the late 1960s and the early 1970s, planned to  produce a book about him and the Congo river (to be sponsored by National Geo- graphic). His sponsors eventually withdrew, maybe because Elisofon had become  too implicated in the Mobuto regime.18 the annexed quotation from stanley’s The  Congo (“Whatever interest we may profess . . . the muscles of whose members  have a more immediate and practical value to us . . . the tropical world must ever  remain worthless to them and to ourselves” [93]) is an unfinished explication de  texte. Metonymically, men’s muscles in stanley’s vision were not there for fun  (like the paddlers’), they were to be exploited to the full, otherwise Africa would  remain unproductive and sterile. At this nebulous point of exposition, at the very  word “ourselves” (above), Stanley was interrupted. Elisofon did not let him finish  the argument that he was developing, as if its outspokenness would have spoiled  the aesthetics of the photo’s masculine self-consciousness. But silencing stanley  right there, he was also, paradoxically, provoking (the reader/me) to allow him  (stanley) to speak his mind. this is what the bodyscape of the playful muscles in  the Wagenia canoe predicated: in every cordial-faced aborigine whom i met i see a promise of assistance to me  in the redemption of himself from the state of unproductiveness in which he  at present lives. i look upon him with much of the same regard that an agricul- turalist views his strong-limbed child; he is the future recruit to the ranks of  </page> <page sequence="13"> 96 • REsEaRch in afRican litERatuREs • VOlumE 43 numbER 3 soldier-labourers. the Congo-basin, could i have but enough of his class, would  become a productive garden (93–94). so rationally argued the engineer of King leopold ii’s African real estate in 1884.  in the end, the forced labor economy would result in a death toll estimated to be as  high as 10 million people (Nzongola-Ntalaja 22). Elisofon’s appreciation of stanley  was astonishingly myopic. the last two Congo pictures are “A boat glides on Congo before stanleyville”  and “Butterflies congregate on floor of Congo jungle.” The first is a panoramic,  esoteric river landscape lacking in cultural specificity; the second an explosion of  butterfly colors in a close-up, imposing and wondrous. Geary characterizes Eli- sofon’s Congo photographs (in general) as “stunning” (“Central Africa” 51). they  are, but as i have said, even a photo of Victoria Falls can contain its own disproof.  At least here the grand craftsmanship of the two photos, of their making and  their visual impact, can be disentangled through the text-image coalition. For the  production of the first image, Elisofon had returned to Conrad’s novella (38) and  one of its many epiphanies of a Garden of Eden in a state of decay, similar to his  trope of the undergrowth rottenness swallowing the slave/the old lega man. the  short passage (“. . . thin high stillness of primeval forest . . . as it flowed broadly  by without a murmur”) with phrases like “black creek,” “rank grass,” “mud,” and  “somber gap” deflect the emblematic sublime of its visual companion. For the sec- ond, André Gide was invited to scribble a melancholic note about a lost butterfly.  His writing occurred during a tour outside Brazzaville, at the confluence of the  Congo and the Djoué rivers (livingstone Falls). it reads: “there was a little path,  almost along the river’s edge, and a shady creek where a canoe was lying moored;  a great number of butterflies of a great many different kinds; but . . . the finest  got away” (12–13). A loss fractured the “stunning” butterfly image, as horror and  deprivation defied “the gliding boat on Congo.” sExuAlitY’s WEst AFRiCA it sounds like voyeuristic agitprop when the editor, in the introductory passage  of the “storied World of Africa,” retreated to one of the most well-known sex- addicted lines in Hemingway’s writings on Africa to represent the LIFE essay as a  sum total. Reading it “to its startling end,” the editor confessed, “one is reminded  of what Ernest Hemingway wrote in the sensitive Green Hills of Africa: ‘. . . i loved  the country so i was happy as you are after you have been with a woman that you  really love . . . Now, being in Africa, i was hungry for more of it’ ” (72). LIFE’s call  for pornographic viewing, as it proved to be, was rationalized and normalized  by the two interacting Western myth systems of machismo/patriarchal primi- tive masculinity (of which Hemingway was the authorized prototype19) and the  sexualizing of Africa, a vital product of which was the denigration of the female  body (see Armengol-Carrera, Hyam). We will see how the last four photographs  conform to these myths. the emblematic photograph taken in Mali of “the woman bathing at the sun- set in the Niger, near ancient timbuktu” (which was the excited editor’s informal  caption) was one out of a series of seven (EEPA) that Elisofon took at the same  spot, within a time span of a couple minutes (EEPA, 1959, Mali, domestic life, J 1  </page> <page sequence="14"> RaOul J. GRanQVist • 97 MAl 6 EE 59. EEPA EECl 7871). Within this period of time a second woman, in the  immediate background inside her boat, is maneuvering it towards the riverbank,  thus adding dramatic space, action, and depth to the main event. this was the  bare-breasted woman in the front washing herself, splashing water intermittently  on her breasts, while in a dialogue with the woman behind her. in one of the  photographs the woman with the bare breasts turned her face towards the pho- tographer as if responding to the “male gaze” or his directional guidance (J 1 Mal  8). Being the first image-text in the photo-essay, and, what’s more, rewarded with  the editor’s prefatory enthusiasm plucked from Hemingway about female sexual  submission, its gendered iconography pressed hard on all the others. it saturated,  in fact, the essay as a whole. the story of the juxtaposed extract from Joyce Cary’s  The African Witch (“the two girls loved the glittering river . . . it was like green- ish glass, glistening where the film of the thinner liquid rested upon its surface”  [63]) was true in the sense that the image and the text shared a social encounter  between two women friends at a riverside, idealized in Cary’s “glittering river”  and Elisofon’s sunset across the Niger. The fact that Cary’s fictional protagonists  lived at the small Rimi river in Katsina state (in Northern Nigeria) may be of minor  significance. But the ethical-cultural discordance, between the essay image’s  immersion in eroticism and Cary’s religious (Muslim vs Christian) contemplations  in The African Witch, is immense. the Cary overwriting does not salvage the photo;  it lends names to the hypocritical and sexist intention that backs it. it is not surprising that one of the two-page photos in the essay was a dance  scene whose major attraction is centered on nudity and the dancers’ breasts. Colo- nial photography overflowed in pictures of women’s breasts where a clear duality  was upheld between what was considered beautiful and what was ugly. Elisofon’s  choices of female objects was generally guided by “beauty” and “youth.”20 During  his visit with the Kuba king Mbop Mabiinc maKyen in Mushenge, when he took  his famous pictures of the ruler, he also photographed a dancing session. this is  an extract from his report to his office in New York about his camera work with  the villagers (HRC, 10.1. Report 2. A visit to Nyai Bepe Mabinshe: King of the  Bakuba, Jan 1947): the leader had a special gourd which had a necklace of tinkling objects around  its neck. she set the rhythm for the others. the others . . . all kinds . . . fat and  skinny, tall and short, young and old, smooth and wrinkled, some with breasts  so pendulant that they were revolting to see, backs and stomachs tattooed in  intricate beautiful patterns, a touch of tattoo near the forehead, some with clean  shaven hands, other with tight black curls, and all wearing the attire of the  harem [he calls the ruler’s entourage of wives], an orange wrap around skirt  with a billowy edging. . . . i got tired of photographing old hags with horrible  figures and picked out a nice young one with a fine figure, only she said she  couldn’t dance. the one photograph that the LIFE-essay picked from the twenty-odd that Elisofon  took of the liberian National Dance troupe, who were apparently performing  for him, fulfilled these “aesthetic” standards. The dangling breasts of the two  young women of the essay photo, vertically and horizontally centered for absolute  attention, were “cannibilized” (to use lucy lippard’s term) (EEPA, liberia, 1959,  dance, F 2 VAi 1 EE 59).21 its caption “liberian girls near Monrovia do a dance of  </page> <page sequence="15"> 98 • REsEaRch in afRican litERatuREs • VOlumE 43 numbER 3 celebration” lied. it was the white man with his horny camera who was the subject  of the “celebration.” the supportive lines culled from amateur anthropologist  Geoffrey Gorer’s travelogue Africa Dances (“Africans dance. . . . the West African  negro is not so much the blackish man or the cannibal man or the primitive man  as he is the man who expresses every emotion with rhythmical bodily move- ments” [63]) generalized and idealized the dance as orgasmic, conforming it to  Hemingway’s metonymic reductions of Africa and Africans as sexual objects for  copulation (“you feel it welling up again” [Green Hills 76]). the stereotypes of the  hyper-emotional, irrational, and childlike African, were also played out in the  narrative of the last two photographs that i will discuss next. the two photographs were placed side by side on opposite pages. the picture  on the left-hand page portrays the torso of a young coquettish woman, smiling,  closed eyes, looking down, with a headscarf and a dress in the same brown colors.  the caption reads: “A Vai girls smiles in the market in Monrovia” (EEPA, 1959,  liberia, portraits A 2 VAi 1 EE 59. EEPA EECl 212).22 the picture to the right is  another torso portrayal of a young “woman,” hardly more than a child of 12–14,  naked, her face and upper body covered with white ritual chalk. she smiles  broadly and looks straight into the camera. the caption is “liberian girl giggles  at her chalky ritual make-up” (EEPA, 1959, liberia, women F 2 Bss 43 EE 59. EEPA  EECl 4749).23 None of the women was named; another instance of how visual  de-individualization configured representativeness. The stylish market woman  with the alluring smile stands for the modern world and her naked partner with  the demonic grin for outmoded and outgoing “savagery.” the visual dichotomy  founded on shifting material codes (such as clothing) has, of course, a long tradi- tion in colonial and missionary photography (Granqvist “looking-glass”). it had  a renaissance in the 1960s when a gigantic Western picture industry construed  various modalities of “Africa in transition.” the nostalgic hinterland of female  nakedness to which the LIFE essay clung did not signify a threat. it sustained a  world of myths, a replaceable world of opportunities to be embarked upon with  Western help. the second caption was misleading. According to the EEPA data catalogue  about the series of the photographs that Elisofon took, the “giggling girl” was one  of six or seven Bassa who, having returned from the prescribed time of training  after circumcision, were performing a dance for elders and women in their village.  in the photograph that was picked for the essay, the girl returned a warm scoffing  smile at the cameraman, amazed, i guess, at his persisting comic bouncing and  twitching around the small group. He, in his turn, wanted the viewer/reader to  understand that she was already on “his” side, disaffiliated from her culture, soon  another translated, replaced, woman with Western make-up and Western self- indulgence. this is why she was captioned to giggle at herself. it is as if Mr. John- son’s sweet-talk with the village belle Bamu has been rewarded: “oh, Bamu, you  are my savage girl here—you do not know how happy i will make you. i will turn  you to a civilized lady and we shall not do any work at all” (Cary, Mister Johnson 12). in Elisofon’s service as a photo appendage, Mister Johnson, the polyglot and  trickster, code-switched from standard English into rotten English. He spoke a  Hausa version of pidgin English (“i got a lil girl, she roun’ like de worl’. she smoot  like de water . . . Why you ‘fraid for me? i no got nuttin, no stick, no knife . . .”  [19–20]), an example of childish bantering that Chantal Zabus has called Cary’s  </page> <page sequence="16"> RaOul J. GRanQVist • 99 dependence on the “double [colonial] heritage of levity and barbaric primitiv- ism” (63). the returning candid smile of the liberian girls on the two LIFE pages  had been appropriated to reduce them as cultural personae and delete them as  gendered individuals. the essay portrayed, let us recollect, twelve individuals, eleven of whom were  nameless black Africans, stereotyped, categorized, and debased. one was white;  a colonialist, hunter, tourist guide and the only one in Elisofon’s African gallery  who was identified with a name. Seven of the black Africans were women, four  of them were depicted naked, one was a Maasai, the second a “modern woman,”  the third a silhouette. three of the men were wild “savages,” and the fourth, a  Maasai with a spear. there were three photographs of groups; in the two with  black Africans the camera perspective was on the men’s backs; the white group  was a stylized romance of voortrekker penetration. there were four pictures of  animals; two of “sublime” landscapes. Were it not for the improved equipment and  technique, and Elisofon’s skill, all of these images could have been produced as  sketches or photographs by Charles and David livingstone or stanley almost one  hundred years earlier, so little had they departed from the Victorian conventions  of visualizing the “dark continent” (see Koivunen 61–72). PolitiCs As you will have noticed there is a temporal gap between Elisofon’s in situ photo- graphing and travel and the publication date of the essay. the gap was as long as  two years. it is not any two years in the political history of the African continent,  they may well be its two most decisive ones after the Berlin Conference years  (1884–1885). I use the word politics here to mean: first, the politics of Elisofon’s  travel (1959), particularly its connections with the literary project; second, the poli- tics of the LIFE essay genesis (1959–1961) and its connections with the development  in Africa. The two fields overlapped in many ways. Elisofon’s 1959 travel with his camera and his canon of Western literature as  his compass was one of four projects, two of which seem to be at loggerheads with  the literary expedition. The first was not. His research for the Nile documentary,  which he had started in 1947, took him anew to Egypt, we saw, to compliment his  visual repertoire of monuments, river traffic, bridges, and landscape views. the  almost four-hundred files held by EEPA from the river expedition were, remark- ably, devoid of photographs of human beings other than reflections or vague  group silhouettes. His third photo-project, a coverage of the “new” Nigeria for LIFE, differed not  only in this respect, thus abounding in portrayals of political leaders and colonial  (both British and Nigerian) administrators, but also letting us appreciate Elisofon’s  perspicuous eye for the mechanism of his craftsmanship. How hands worked— metonymically couched or not. He portrayed legendary political leaders such as  samuel l. Akintola of the Action Group and the nationalists Michael ihemukara  okpara and Nnamdi Azikiwe. Azikiwe, “the Zik of Africa,” who would become  the country’s first president. He photographed manual workers of shifting skills  (glass welters, masons, mud-brick construction workers, and Ekulu [near Enugu]  coal miners). He documented the electoral campaign (rigged, some think, by the  British24) for the December 12, 1959, election, which would usher in independence  </page> <page sequence="17"> 100 • REsEaRch in afRican litERatuREs • VOlumE 43 numbER 3 the next year (october 1, 1960). And he restrained his appetite for ethnographica.  A few of these photographs were used in the Nigeria essay.25 it is as if his Nigeria  work with its documentary photography and that of the literary work on the myths  of Africa were their own enemies. But they were not. they were part of the same  agenda. the myth mongering, i insist, was as factual, political, and conclusive.  Finally, how are we to rationalize his fourth project’s contribution to the agenda?  the function of his aerial expeditions? They emanated from Elisofon’s penchant for the magnificent vistas that could  be shot from the inside of an aeroplane. Distance photographing could be used for  visual mapping, for formulating syntheses of landscape formations, for military  spying,26 and for the illusion of seeing it all.27 Elisofon had tried them. technically,  the aerial made angled panoramas possible as the photographer could sick-sack  around an object, both vertically and horizontally. it also conjectured similarities  with the constituents of the nineteenth-century explorer’s scientific ambitions in  organizing taxonomies of nature and economy. it bolstered panoptical power of  seeing-as domination; it was the man climbing the mountainside without taking  a step. Elisofon was, to use Michel Foucault’s term, a “panoptic machine” (Jay  411). His topographic mapping by air during the five months of 1959 was, indeed,  intimidatingly28 determined. it included the Aswan Dam (Egypt); the port town  of lamu on the indian ocean and the Rift Valley with the Mau escarpment (both  Kenya); downtown Johannesburg (south Africa); the city of Kinshasa (DRC); the  city of Zaria in Kaduna state and the shell-BP oil drill south of Port Harcourt  harbor (both Nigeria); and the city of Goundam (Mali). As these photographs do  not seem to have been used or asked for by the media at the time, my suggestion  is that LIFE had other uses for them, that they found their way into military files,  which was not an uncommon practice and was acquiesced to by the magazine. the thrill of the myths, their outer world, was not a fool’s lost paradise. the  myths of Africa were real in the sense that the vacuity, tenaciousness, and perver- sity that they inhabited would appeal to a political trickster like Elisofon. He could  handle hardcore political and social issues, such as election campaigns and aerial  expeditions, but also racist colonial storytelling—if it was purposeful. He could  help demonize Africa and adjust to the holes it left. that the double entendre of  his photography was ambivalent and ambiguous is saying little (staples, “Visual- ism” 183); that it could be subsidiary of LIFE patriotism and American Cold War  African politics, as i argue, is saying more. Within 1960, twenty new African states saw the light. Among them were DR  Congo, Nigeria, and Mali that Elisofon had visited in 1959. Kenya, we saw, was  under state emergency until November 1959, with Kenyatta in house arrest and  freed to become president of KANu in 1961. Patrice lumumba, President of DR  Congo, was murdered with American and Belgian assistance in February 1961, less  than a year after independence. Apartheid’s south Africa staged the sharpeville  Massacre on March 21, 1960, with 69 dead and 180 injured and the PAC and ANC  banned, turning Apartheid into a tragedy with global dimensions. only to list a  few major events during these years that were to shape African future and that of  the world. the october 1961 LIFE-essay’s option for the outer world was a hiding- place. the editorial preface of Elisofon’s LIFE issue with Hemingway’s Green Hills  quote claimed a response other than erotic titillation also. the following short  </page> <page sequence="18"> RaOul J.

But much of the truth of Africa, of the forces that stir in its heartland, are  illuminated by the memorable writings about it. The first sentence acknowledged that a “struggle” for “harsh modernity” was  going on in Africa. “Harsh modernity,” a euphony for the unutterable and the  unexpected: the winning of freedom from decades of colonial superimposition  and degradation, was an alarming and distressing problem, the magazine insinu- ates. to trivialize the post-colonial process further, the manifold reports from  Africa in American media, the editor explained, were but vagrant headline news  not worth taking seriously. “truth,” the penetrating truth informing the ominous  “forces that stir in its hinterland” (for “those forces,” see the list in the LIFE essay  of May 4, 1953, discussed above), could be accessed by the pairing of Elisofon’s  photographs with “memorable writings,” also from the West. in other words, the  “stirring” revolts in Kenya, Congo, and south Africa, LIFE proposed, should be  dampened by a dose of Western cultural know-how and strengthened hinterland  American Cold War politics.

For viewing  the photos in the essay, see endnote 1. 11. in 1947 in Kenya, Elisofon met the reputed Kikuyu colonial chief Koinange Wa  Mbiyu and his son Peter Mbiyu Koinange (educated in the u.s. and a coming Kenyan  foreign minister). the chief was dressed up in “attires of monkey skin,” as he was  expected to be in front of the foreigner’s camera. And as the Kuba king, he was under  the supervision of a colonial information officer. After the photo rehearsal, the chief  was metamorphosed, to the shock of Elisofon, into a “well-dressed executive similar to  a Washington clerk of the Negro race.” “He was wearing a blue serge suit with a shirt  and a tie, black oxfords, had a gold chain dangling from his lapel to his breast pocket”  (HRC, 10.5). the Kikuyu chief, in contrast to the Kuba king, had transgressed the rule  of subservience and the stereotype of himself only (in Elisofon’s eyes) to move into  another, that of the black clown. 12. Elisofon’s photographs of Victoria Falls, taken in 1947, feature currently (20  March 2012) on Victoria Falls’ website: http://www.tothevictoriafalls.com/vfpages/ tourism/lifegallery.html. 13. the photographs were a zebra on the cover of the edition, the same elephant  family as in the 1961 LIFE essay, a sunset, and a group of gnus. 14. see D. N. Beach, “Afrikaner and shona settlement in the Enkeldoore Area,  1890–1900.” http://archive.lib.msu.edu/DMC/African%20Journals/pdfs/Journal%20of  %20the%20University%20of%20Zimbabwe/vol1n2/juz001002006.pdf. 15. Anonymity is legion for the many thousands of Africans that Elisofon photo- graphed during his travels, with the exception for men with power, political leaders,  both within or outside the colonial cadres, famous artists, and a few others. in other  words, only men who had stepped out of “savagery,” as it were, were honored by being  identified and recognized as individuals. A journalistic ethical principle that he would  never have accepted for Americans and Europeans (including the “Boers” he had met  at Potchefstroom). For women, anonymity was a rule; EEPA classifies them simply  (and lazily) as “ethnic.” And what is “ethnic?” A young lega woman, from the same  village as the Conradian man, fell out as a person with a name, Manganza, but was  instead discredited being photographed by Elisofon in anthropometrical poses, from  the front and in profile. The Victorian visual representation of Africans, derived from  physiognomy and phrenology, was still active as late as the 1960s. 16. Elisofon met Chinua Achebe in Enugu in september 1959 and took a number  of photographs of him sitting at a table with two editions of his fresh publication of  Things Fall Apart (1958) in front of him (EEPA, Nigeria, 1959, Achebe, H 2 NiG 6.1.1 EE  59). Achebe’s piercing eyes have followed my work on this essay, reminding me of his  words in his famous castigation of Conrad’s Heart of Darkness: “Marlow comes through  to us not only as a witness of truth, but one holding those advanced and humane views  appropriate to the English liberal tradition which required all Englishmen of decency  to be deeply shocked by atrocities in Bulgaria or the Congo of King leopold of the  Belgians or wherever” (Achebe). A liberalism that also haunted Elisofon. 17. it was a regatta. Elisofon accompanied the paddlers down the rapids, photo- graphing them on the canoe from behind. 18. i am currently researching this topic. 19. Hemingway’s writing about bull-fighting (his last before his death), “The Dan- gerous summer,” was published by LIFE in three consecutive installments during  september 1960, one year before Elisofon’s essay was printed. </page> <page sequence="20"> RaOul J.

Geary asks whether such photographs should be exhibited and republished at  all (“World of images” 19). 21. the one printed in the LIFE essay is not available in EEPA. 22. the one printed in the LIFE essay is not available in EEPA. 23. the one printed in the LIFE essay is not available in EEPA. 24. see http://www.dawodu.com/election1.htm. 7 March 2012. 25. the LIFE essay, “the Hopeful launching of a Proud and Free Nigeria” (Novem- ber 7, 1960, 54–69), was structured from within the traditional dichotomy of the “new,”  the “modern,” the “international” vs the sadness of the bygone. 26. He was a spy for the Allied (with LIFE’s approval) in “neutral” stockholm (Feb- ruary-November 1944). see a documentation of this time in Raoul J. Granqvist, “Eliot  Elisofon i sverige 1944: spion, fotojournalist och livsnjutare” (Eliot Elisofon in sweden  in 1944: spy, Photojournalist, and Hedonist). Nya Argus, 104.11–12 (2011) 294–301. 27. As early as 1939, with the famous photographer thérèse Bonney, he was in  Finland for LIFE to document the country’s preparations for the olympics (that were  interrupted by the soviet attack on the country). the two circled above the southern  part of the country for a few hours’ photographing of various sites/spots that were to  bind together their formulaic snapshot concept of what constituted “Finland.” Raoul  J. Granqvist, “På gränsen till ett krig. Eliot Elisofon och LIFE i Finland 1939” (on the  threshold of a War: Eliot Elisofon and LIFE in Finland 1939), Nya Argus 104.5–6 (2011)  143–146. 28. i use that word speculatively, suggesting without knowing with certainty, that  Elisofon (or LIFE) might have handed over these photographs to American intelli- gence. in Red Paranoia 1951, he was accused by the FBi to be a communist, obviously  because of his membership in the socialistic Photo league (and President of it for a  year). He firmly rejected the accusation. In an affidavit for Time/LIFE on March 8, 1957,  he explained, as way of exonerating himself, that he had assisted American Combined  intelligence with hundreds of photos of roads and topography taken during his 1947  Cape town-Cairo journey and that he had also cooperated with the American intel- ligence (in particular with the oslo American embassy) when photographing docks,  harbors, beaches and Norwegian fjords during his Atlantic coastal journey the follow- ing year (HRC, 69.2, 71.7–8). the state control of LIFE magazine operated, as it seems,  both from within its own pages and from the outside.
