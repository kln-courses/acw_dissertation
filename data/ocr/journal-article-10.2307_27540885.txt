<plain_text><page sequence="1">ARTS AND LETTERS THE SMOKE OF ONE'S OWN COUNTRY* By HOWARD BAKER Just as the ancient world schooled itself in the study of Homer, so the modern world, century by century, has made its own very serious efforts to recover what it could of the Iliad and the Odyssey by trans lating them into whatever language there was then at hand. In these efforts English literature has enjoyed some of its best moments. I am thinking of the towering Elizabethan poetics of George Chapman, the Augustan perfections of Pope, the romantic empathies of Cowper and Bryant, the chivalric antiquarianism of the last century, the novelistic prose of recent days: of these examples in particular, and now beside them the wholly arresting verse Odyssey of Robert Fitzgerald. Since the versions varied with each age and each author, the trans lators have usually offered the reader something or other in the way of an apologetic preface. But not Robert Fitzgerald. This may very well be because in this age we have come to realize that no preface can give a lucid and reasonably objective account of the Odyssey. (Nor of course can so frail a thing as a book review.) We happen to live in a world where you would not have to travel far to find a linguist, an archaeologist, an anthropologist, an expert in comparative oral lit erature, as well as a variety of historians, each of whom knows more about certain details in Homer's world than Homer's Alexandrian edi tors could possibly have known. But in the hands of the specialists the Homeric thing, like so many other things, becomes atomized to the point that comprehensive statements are difficult to envision.1 For ex ample: even today the question whether Homer was one poet, or two, or a breed of anonymous interlinking poets is not at all settled, though in America, thanks particularly to the research and polemics of the late Milman Parry, opinion has settled on the Unitarian, one-man view. If Mr. Fitzgerald had chosen to write a preface he could hardly have Homer, The Odyssey, translated by Robert Fitzgerald, with drawings by Hans Erni, New York (Doubleday &amp; Co.), 1961, 475 pages, $4-95 'For such general assertions as I have ventured to make, I have referred to C. H. Whitman, Homer and the Heroic Tradition, Cambridge, Mass. (Harvard), 1958.</page><page sequence="2">318 ARTS AND LETTERS bypassed a question which scholars have delighted in since 1795, pro fidess and distracting though it must be for a translator, not to men tion nearly everybody else except the specialists themselves. As it is, without the preface, his pages confront you, at once open and secretive, smiling in the way a very old statue smiles, leaving it up to you to make of them what you will. The publisher's message on the dust-jacket is similarly unpresum ing, the main claim being that Mr. Fitzgerald has devised a blank verse which is especially suitable for the task at hand. One would hope as much of any new verse translation, and in this case hope is wholly fulfilled, as we shall try to show before long. Only a single feature in the makeup of this handsome book gives a foretaste of what this Odyssey will actually be like: the twenty-four line-drawings of Hans Erni suggest the adroit simplicities of Picasso's classical drafts manship. A glance at the text however soon reveals a parallel adroitness with words, and all at once a classicism that was companion to Picasso's comes to mind?the pro?e of James Joyce in Ulysses. It isn't just the vocabulary that suggests Ulysses, though it is in part vocabulary? . . . here's a young weaver singing a pretty song to set the air a-tingle on these lawns and paven courts. . . . X, 226 ff. (p. 184) ?but it is rather a seemingly artless syntax which is nevertheless in tricately broken up and tied together. It will be remembered that Joyce, in the act of imposing the pattern of the Odyssey on a day in Dublin, arrived at a style which was not archaic in the manner of the scholars Butcher and Lang, for instance, or on the other hand of the enthusiasts for the Celtic revival; nor was it deliberately contemporary and colloquial. It was a style instead that combined past and present, a polished epic language with the run of current talk. It succeeded notably. It appears also to be reversible. It is quite possible that Homer has become newly translatable because of the activities of James Joyce. This is not to set up the thesis that one master-writer named J. J. has had a specific influence on a contemporary poet named R. F.; but rather to propose that there is a modern style and a modern aware ness that react interchangeably, and that, for better or worse, the com</page><page sequence="3">ARTS AND LETTERS 319 bination touches everybody. As a preliminary note on what this com bination is, we might say right now that the new thing in the world seems to have been and seems to continue to be a reliance in subjec tive resources rather than objective criteria. In fact the difficulties be clouding "objective criteria" are the peculiar preoccupation of these years, whether having to do with literary style or with any of the other ways of organizing experience. Joyce's celebrated journeys into the shadowlands of the "stream of consciousness" are pretty certainly not technical devices so much as they are reflections of a state of mind. The state of mind persists. Fitz gerald opens the Odyssey by putting Homer's words this way: Sing in me, Muse, and through me tell the story of that man skilled in all ways of contending. . . . What is unusual here is the emphasis on the inward-looking point of view. If this is a departure from familiar Homer, the departure con sists mainly in the new interpretation of Muse, which is Homer's own word. This Muse is not a draped female figure with braids and a lyre; she is something inside us. The pertinent question therefore is, what was she, along with the other gods and goddesses, for Homer? To an swer this hard question we shall be bound eventually to entertain some shaky surmises. Meanwhile we must grant Mr. Fitzgerald his right to a Muse that dwells within him; not to do so would be a betrayal of all that we assumed by being born into a century of existentialism (the deme of Sartre) and solipsistic logic (the tribe of Wittgenstein); which is, let me hasten to add, not, in my opinion, the worst of fates, as the fates of men and nations go. Some comparisons are in order: of this Odyssey with some of the earlier ones, and consequently of some of the apparent presumptions of the present world with some of those of the past. I. When Odysseus is finally landed on the shores of Ithaca, he fails to recognize his long-sought, beloved homeland. He is alone. Worn out by twenty years of adversity, his companions all dead long since, the plunder brought from Troy and way-points sunk in the sea, he has nevertheless won a passage home for himself, together with a shipload of gifts, from the hospitable Phaeacians?and has slept through his dis embarkation and that of his new possessions, as well as the departure</page><page sequence="4">320 ARTS AND LETTERS of the Phaeacian ship. It's something to think about: to win the cher ished goal and not to know it. Athene is partly to blame, having put a mist on what might other wise have been familiar landmarks, and taking her time as usual about making her purposes clear to him. When she does appear, Odysseus has tallied up his misgivings as best he could and has begun to weep; he is in a mood therefore only to be wary towards the delicate young shepherd whom he refrains from recognizing immediately as his pro tecting goddess in disguise. Athene rallies him on his scepticism and gives him straightforward assurances as to the place's being Ithaca and her herself being who she is. Odysseus' reply is a crux in Homeric statements about the relationship between mortal and Immortal, ra tional and Suprarational. In Mr. Fitzgerald's translation some of the most relevant lines are these: His mind ranging far, Odysseus answered: "Can mortal man be sure of you on sight, even a sage, O mistress of disguises? . . . Hear me now in your father's name, for I cannot believe that I have come to Ithaka. It is some other land. You made that speech, only to mock me, and to take me in. Have I come back in truth to my home island?" To this the grey-eyed Athene answered: "Always the same detachment ! That is why I cannot fail you, in your evil fortune, coolheaded, quick, well-spoken as you are. . . ." XIII, 311 ff. (p. 252) The idea that Odysseus' ranging mind hovers over is the proverbial Greek notion of the gods amusing themselves with man: how can one know and trust the gods? It is a question that makes Athene smile, while complimenting him on his Protagorean ability to take the meas ure of things. The great Elizabethan translator saw nothing here to smile about. Taking off from the first two lines spoken by Odysseus, George Chap man spun twenty, which add up to so egregious an interpolation that Alexander Pope indicates them as an instance of the failings of his</page><page sequence="5">ARTS AND LETTERS 321 predecessor. But Pope was not sensitive to a horror that Chapman and his contemporaries were extremely sensitive to: the sublime mock ery that may be the reward of aspiring men. Although the scaffolding of Chapman's poetics is tortuous, as is normal with him when dealing with touchy subjects, the direct impact of his protest can still be felt: "Goddess," said he, "unjust men and unwise That author injuries and vanities, By vanities and wrongs should rather be Bound to this ill-abearing destiny Than just and wise men. What delight hath heaven That lives unhurt itself, to suffer given Up to all domage those poor few that strive To imitate it, and like the Deities live?" Chapman had his reasons to make a protest. He dedicated his Odys sey to Robert Carr, and his dedications on the whole look very much like compulsive celebrations of whichever chanced to be the star blaz ing brightest in the Elizabethan and Jacobean firmaments. The Shadow of Night aspires toward Ralegh by praising the members of Ralegh's so-called School of Atheism. After Ralegh's fall, the earlier selections from the Iliad look upward toward Ralegh's old rival Essex. Then toward the truly lamentable figure of Prince Henry. And on a dif ferent occasion toward the ambiguously lamentable figure of Francis Bacon. ... It is no wonder that Chapman thought the ways of the gods suspect when dealing with men who strove by virtue like the gods to live. His concern goes deep; that his dedications cannot be con strued as meanly opportunistic is proved by the fact of his continued allegiance to Robert Carr, even after the latter's exposure in connec tion with the murder of Sir Thomas Overbury. There is also clearly more than a small Machiavellian overtone in Chapman's use of the word "virtue." Chapman's Homer boils down to the Renaissance faith in the poet's ability to make men of broad action immortal, come whatever disasters there may in the career of the man himself. Honor is the theme. The verses dedicating the Odyssey to Carr show that Chapman modeled his thinking on the Humanism of Politian, whose brilliant purposes in cluded contributing undying luster to the palaces of the Medici. For Politian and Chapman, Alexander the Great is a haunting prototype of the great man?that Alexander who strove for virtue, "i.e., for a higher and more harmonious individuality" (Jaeger), and who</page><page sequence="6">322 ARTS AND LETTERS wept at the tomb of Achilles, because Achilles had a Homer to cele brate him, and he, alas, had none. Coleridge remarked that in this sort of humanistic handling of the classics Chapman's "forgetfulness of the distinction between Christianity and idolatry, under the general feeling of some religion, is very interesting."* Chapman, we must add, was not the only poet who in his London heyday forgot, or ignored, the distinction. Only the most obscurantist view fails to see that just as the Homeric hero was alive mostly for the honors that he might win, or enlarge, or cling desperately to?all else coming to eventual ruin in death?so too the Elizabethan hero: the point has been clearly elaborated by C. B. Watson in his Shakespeare and the Renaissance Concept of Honor (Princeton, i960). The other side of the coin?the unaccountable sportiveness of the gods?got its sharpest impression from the hand of Shakespeare: As flies to wanton boys, are we to th' Gods; They kill us for their sport. But Montaigne drops the same metaphor onto a page of his, and Sid ney, and Plautus, and so on; and on back into the dim reaches of An tiquity: O damned confusion! Can this be a ruse to trick me from the boat for some god's pleasure? V, 850-1 (Fitzgerald, p. 103) One coin of course does not constitute all of the currency in the epic bank. There are other coins which will possibly jingle the merrier be cause of the presence of this weighty one in an inside pocket. We won't stop to look at the gayer side of Chapman now. We will observe that Fitzgerald's Odyssey is like Chapman's in that it muffles neither the brazen clang of weapons nor the gasps of pain. Pope's does. II. When Pope came to the passage we have been considering, he not only got rid of Chapman's exasperated interpolations; he took all of the sting out of the remaining lines, Chapman's and Homer's as well: "But, by th' almighty author of thy race, Tell me, oh tell, is this my native place? 'Quoted in Homer's Hymns and Epigrams, ed. Hooper, p. xxvi.</page><page sequence="7">ARTS AND LETTERS 323 For much I fear, long tracts of land and sea Divide this coast from distant Ithaca; The sweet delusion kindly you impose, To soothe my hopes, and mitigate my woes." Instead of mockery we get sweet delusions underscored in three differ ent ways. Clearly this Odyssey has undergone a sea-change. The simplest thing to say is that the epic is now looked upon as one would look upon an Italian opera. Pope remarks, in commending the flow of Homer's verses, that anyone, regardless of his knowledge of Greek, can with diligence follow the operatic sweetness, variety, and majesty of the poem. True: but what would he miss? He would miss, among other things, a lot of terribly interesting perplexities, which we may roughly call philosophical, that were apparently settled for Pope in the codes of the Continental neo-classicists. "The Odyssey" Pope says, "is a moral and political work"; and settles for a commonplace or two. He quotes Horace Epistle I, 2, but does not concern himself with Hor ace's more puzzling comments, such as the attribution of the evils at Troy to the crimes that ran riot both within the walls and without, or the attribution of slothful decadence to the Phaeacians. The fact, is, Pope's Odyssey, if not an Italian opera, is an English court masque of great size, and it is full of its own kind of action and color and music. It is superb in its way. Its author is not philosophi cal, not even very thoughtful; he has settled into a listless benevolent Deism, which would put the lazy Phaeacians to shame; he interpolates Newtonian ideas which seem curiously watered down: e.g., ". . . the whole earth must move if Heaven commands," where the original thought was simply that nobody less powerful than a god could have moved Odysseus' bed. And of course Pope's Odyssey is pretty far from Homer's. Homer, for just one example, has the little Phaeacian princess Nausicaa ad dress her father, after her wonderful dream, in the simplest, most touching words imaginable. "P?ppa phil'," et cetera, are words which have always been known, often repeated, and indeed are transparent to almost anyone, a student of Greek or not. Mr. Fitzgerald puts them this way: "My dear Pap?, could you not send the mule cart around for me?the gig with pretty wheels?" VI, 57-8 (p. 113)</page><page sequence="8">324 ARTS AND LETTERS But Pope wrote these lines, or he allowed his able assistant, William Broome, to write them, like this: "Will my dread sire his ear regardful deign, And may his child the royal car obtain?" One can feel the heat of the candles on the stage and smell the subtle smoke that accompanies such brilliance, and view dimly the shadowy figures of an elegant, perhaps enviable, audience in the background. Which is just another way of saying that this Odyssey is collaborative and objective to an unusual degree. III. After Pope, the deluge. For a long time it was exceedingly difficult for another poet to struggle ashore with a new Odyssey. Cowper. when setting out on his venture, wrote to Lady Hesketh: "The only proper part for me is not to know that such a man as Pope has ever existed." And, under this self-imposed discipline, Cowper did work out a blank verse translation which preserves some of the human motives and sim plicities that Pope rejected. But not many. Cowper, in phrasing the Ghost-of-Achilles' famous reply to Odysseus' shallow praises of him in Hades, may have put his predecessor out of his mind, but he hasn't forgot his vocabulary: "Renown'd Ulysses! think not death a theme Of consolation; I had rather live The servile hind for hire, and eat the bread Of some man scantily himself sustain'd, Than sov'reign empire hold o'er all the shades." X, 488-91 We may allow that "a theme/Of consolation" and "the bread/Of some man scantily himself sustain'd" is direct, untheatrical diction; but "hind" is Pope's word, and "servile," which is Cowper's donation, is of no help at all. Then after another century came the spate of long-line translations, possibly to confound Pope, possibly to recapture the archaic attractions of English ballad meter; or possibly, in recent practice, to symbolize some of the physical properties of the original hexameters. Of the latter, the Iliad of Richmond Lattimore is an admirable example, though it is more praiseworthy, I believe, for its avoidance of bad</page><page sequence="9">ARTS AND LETTERS 325 poetics and bad translation than for its achievement of a firm metrical line? Robert Fitzgerald's blank verse, while by no means a revolutionary instrument, is uniquely suited to a poem that sweeps on and on, mov ing from bountiful halls to the gloomy regions of the dead, from one strange island to another, from the laughter of the gods to the slaughter of the princely suitors?to a poem, in short, which should be heard, lis tened to, not merely read. It was an oral poem to begin with, and an oral poem it remains in Mr. Fitzgerald's translation, and also, quite sufficiendy, a blank verse poem. Take the unusual treatment of run-on lines as an example of Fitzgerald's artful procedure in metrics. Nor mally an unaccented syllable at the end of a blank verse line is simply left hanging there, counting as just an extra, insignificant eleventh syl lable; but in the ear this extra syllable may be carried over when the syntax permits it and counted as the first syllable of the following line: God send you see your lady and your homeland soon again, after the pain of exile. VIII, 410-11 (p. 149) For the benefit of the eye, these lines might have been written: God send you see your lady and your home land soon again, after the pain of exile. To the ear, Mr. Fitzgerald is a very satisfactory worker of English blank verse rhythms. He often uses over-length to separate off blocks of verses, often under-length to punctuate them in the middle. His practice in regard to such mechanics as elision and reversed stress con forms generally to the rules. Listen as carefully as you will, and with the exception of the floating accent on the Greek-spelled proper names, you will find it hard to tell where his verse departs metrically from, say, the non-Miltonic standard of Milton's close predecessors. But fine versification, fortunately or unfortunately, does not a fine poem make. There is the far showier thing called vocabulary that cannot possibly escape notice. Take these verses, for example; they constitute the greeting that the Ghost-of-Achilles gives Odysseus when he discovers him alive in Hades: "Son of Laertes and the gods of old, Odysseus, master mariner and soldier, old knife, what next? What greater feat remains</page><page sequence="10">326 ARTS AND LETTERS for you to put your mind on, after this? How did you find your way down to the dark where these dimwitted dead are camped forever, the after images of used-up men?" XI, 471-76 (p. 212) The first lines are formulaic epithets, which Mr. Fitzgerald wisely lets go unrefurbished on the whole?grey-eyed Athene, wine-dark sea, and the rest; they are the standard parts in the running gear of the epic. As for "old knife," liking it, like liking California black olives, may not occur the first time around, but it fits Homer's slashing, much scarred warrior really very well. The last three lines bring up prob lems of a different order. A whole complex attitude toward life and death becomes important, not the words themselves. They are good words though; the best of words for this somber passage, because, for one thing, they treat the ultimate nature and condition of man with a trace of scornful humor. With this remark, we can't put off any longer the hazardous voyage backward into the distant past. IV. The formalities of the Eighteenth Century, as we observed, intruded between many a late-comer and the Odyssey. But these formalities, insofar as they had to do with the Homeric content, were condensed from the well-known Attic formulations. Aristotle had treated Zeus as a mythical forerunner of his own Unmoved Mover (see Werner Jaeger, Aristotle, chapter XIV), and so, thereafter, the gods tended to become formal quantities of greater weight than that with which they may have been endowed at first. Plato, moreover, had already estab lished a theory of Forms, which was in part, at least, the outcome of his reaction against the doctrine of "flux" that he found in Homer (see, e.g., Theaetetus 152E and 160D) and in the majority of the philos ophers of Ionian backgrounds. Out of these turns of mind the habits of the ensuing centuries took their shape. It begins to look, in fact, as if Plato may have cast a blinding bright mist over the hinterland from which the Odyssey came. The theory of Forms had changed the old realities into untrustworthy appearances; the dialectic, notably the law of Excluded Middle, had forced the gods to be either gods or not gods, a hero to be either virtuous or not vir tuous (flawed though his virtue might be in the way that the sun may</page><page sequence="11">ARTS AND LETTERS 327 undergo a partial eclipse). For goodness was either goodness or not goodness. Like oil and water, opposites did not mix. Reality knew no neutral middle ground. But in the past hundred years or so the pre-Socratics, Homer among them, have been brought out from behind the curtain and invited to speak in their own right. One result has been the increasing suspicion that the theory of Forms was a polemical structure, and also an ex perimental, continually evolving?and dissolving*?series of conceptions in Plato's own mind. Once "the unity of Plato's thought" was called into serious question, so also were the premises of neo-classicism; when the old fundamentalism began to crack, events like Joyce's Ulysses and Fitzgerald's translation became possible. An instance of the bearing of recent studies on a critical problem in Homer would be this. Norman Gulley in Plato's Theory of Knowledge (London, 1962) not only traces Plato's negative reactions against the "flux" of the Ionians but he also attributes the origins of Forms-theory to the religious ideas of the Orphies: the Forms seem to have been de veloped from the Orphic ideal of "the eternal release of the soul from imprisonment in the body." Now this connects Plato with a strong religious bent that occurred in Attica in his time, and it equally re* moves from Plato the likelihood of his having any strong interest in the religion of the Olympians. The Olympians and their religion doubtless remained the delight of the festivals; Homer was known and loved by everybody; but enthusiastic cults like the Orphies fed the passions of the soul. On these grounds we should be justified in as suming for ourselves a parallel detachment toward the theology of Homer. Not that detachment toward so great and complex an achievement as Homer's is easy to come by. C. H. Whitman, in the book already noted, can neatly reconstruct the Homeric gods in the newer terms that have begun to make sense for us: they are projections or predi cates of human action and character and circumstance, they are happy embodiments of the imagination, and they are frankly and honorably anthropomorphic. We are reminded of the words of Plato's famous opposite number, Protagoras: "Man is the measure of all things." But after having said so much, Mr. Whitman, like all of us, runs into diffi culties. The gods are also symbolic, he continues. And then suddenly, *W. G. Runciman in Plato's Later Epistemology (Cambridge Univ., 1962) explicates the Theaetetus and the Sophist in ways that show the great analytical accomplishment that occurred despite the Forms. 11</page><page sequence="12">328 ARTS AND LETTERS along with the gods, everything seems to condense into symbol and myth, becoming concrete in much the same terms as those which Su sanne Langer has made familiar. For all ends and purposes we have swung back to the Forms again, only now they are anthropological rather than ideal. We have difficulty too in connecting, as Mr. Whit man does, the intricate formal properties in Homer with the geometric designs on early Attic vases. Oral poetry?"Sir Patrick Spence," for hiStan ?is often, for whatever the reasons, amazingly geometrical in design. In the circumstances perhaps the best resort is simply to try to re cover a sense of the Ionic "flux" that Plato sought to controvert. The first place to look, of course, is at the record of the Ionian feeling about things as it is preserved in the paintings on vases of Eastern origin. The early Ionians, writes Arthur Lane in Greek Pottery, "seem to have inherited something of the Minoan delight in fleeting appear ance, in surface pattern, in vivacious movement; and from the art of their Asiatic neighbors they derived a feeling for soft and rounded plastic forms." And of Ionic ware discovered in Italy: "This East Greek style stands in marked contrast to the dry fastidiousness of Attic black-figure. There is much color, purple being often laid direct on the clay; well-observed naturalism in animals and plants; energetic movement in the fleshy human figures; and great freedom and deli cacy in the incised lines. .. ." Although this may be a bit like translat ing the shapes of clouds into forms that we remember, still a pot creat ing the effects that Lane enumerates does resemble the Odyssey very materially. We may add that the vase painters, when they began painting scenes from Homer, show no Attic moral qualms nor great delicacy in making their choices, the blinding of Polyphemus being a favorite subject. As for modern appreciations of the Ionian spirit, we bring up a pas sage from Gilbert Murray's Rise of the Greek Epic. There is a certain irony, and perhaps unfairness, in quoting what follows, because Mur ray was intent on proving a case in which we are not interested: namely, that many Homers exist all stitched together in the Homer we know. The following, however, describes the general background of Murray's mocking Milesian Homer, the Ionian singled out from the others, the one on whom as Unitarians we must put special emphasis. The Homeric gods, Murray says, . . . had been made, up to a certain standard, very beautiful, highly</page><page sequence="13">ARTS AND LETTERS 329 anthropomorphic, not in the least poverty-stricken, barbarous, or grotesque. But in the process they had lost their special hold on the worship of any particular community. They had forfeited the powerful support of uncritical local superstition: and, after all, in the eyes of an educated and sceptical Ionian, would they quite bear thinking about? This serio-comic Olympian family, with its permanent feud between the husband and wife, in behalf of which we can but lamely plead that the wife's unamiability is the natural result of the husband's extreme unfaithfulness, and the husband's unfaithfulness almost excused by the wife's monstrous unamiability? The lame son at whom the gods laugh? The pretty daughter, always in scrapes and tears? . . . The gods are not by any means rejected. They are patronized, conventionalized, and treated as material for ornament. However disproportionate this passage is in playing up one strain in Homer, we would have to correct it, I believe, not by stitching it in with stuff such as that in Hesiod's Theogony, since Hesiod is uncriti cal, literal, rationalistic, and non-Ionian in ways in which Homer cer tainly was not, but by trying to borrow additional eyes from the earliest pre-Socratic investigators of things in general. This would be difficult. But we would notice, for instance, that both Heraclitus and Xenoph anes, though they cast barbs at Homer, level their severest attacks against "the uncritical local superstition" of their times. Therefore it may very well follow that for the slightly later Ionian mentality Homer was not high-handed enough, or not so overtly negative as he should have been, in dealing with the gods. We would notice something else for sure: the extraordinary Ionian preoccupation with the flux of things. In this seems to lie the key to the central problem. V. Mr. Fitzgerald, in composing his felicitous titles for the books of the Odyssey, calls Book XIII, in which Odysseus is landed at long last on Ithaca, "One More Strange Island." Strange islands coming one after another were all that Odysseus had encountered during his years of seafaring; and though from this last one there arose the smoke of his own country, he isn't aware of it at first, as we have already said. Consequently this last beach puts him in mind of other savage beaches and of the harsh tests that invariably came along with them. That was what history had become for him, and what it was actually going to continue to be on into the unforeseeable future: he was caught in</page><page sequence="14">330 ARTS AND LETTERS an inscrutable flux?with islands in it. History, viewed coldly, was very much like what Stephen Dedalus called it: "A nightmare from which he was trying to awaken." It seems quite understandable that Stephen, when Mr. Bloom tries really to find out about him, should put Bloom off with a mixture of ribald scepticism and platitudinous be liefs. What else could he do? Odysseus finds it practically impossible to give a straight answer when someone questions him too abruptly about his origins and destination. But in moments of unthinking ex ultation, as on his departure from the island of the Cyclops, he gives his name only too freely. That's the way it goes with victims of the flux. Odysseus, however, though he weeps when he is alone, nevertheless has learned what to say about the flux and what really to think about it. He has mastered a system of comparisons. When, for instance, he got ashore with the remnants of his companions in what proved later to be the domain of Circe, he made the initial explorations alone, and discovered that here again was another island, with the mark of a single and probably hostile habitation on it. Near the ship on his way back a huge buck appears; he kills the buck and, carrying it toward the beach, he decides to put off his report until morning, fie greets his men: At this those faces, cloaked in desolation upon the waste sea beach, were bared; their eyes turned toward me and the mighty trophy, lighting, foreseeing pleasure, one by one. So hands were washed to take what heaven sent us. And all that day until the sun went down we had our fill of venison and wine, till after sunset in the gathering dusk we slept at last above the line of breakers. When the young Dawn with finger tips of rose made heaven bright, I called them round and said: "Shipmates, companions in disastrous time, O my dear friends, where Dawn lies, and the West, and where the great Sun, light of men, may go under the earth by night, and where he rises? of these things we know nothing. Do we know any least thing to serve us now? I wonder. AH that I saw when I went up the rock was one more island in the boundless main, a low landscape, covered with woods and scrub, and puffs of smoke ascending in mid-forest."</page><page sequence="15">ARTS AND LETTERS 331 They were all silent, but their hearts contracted, remembering Antiphates the Laistrygon and that prodigious cannibal, the Kyklops. . . . X, 178 ff. (p. 182-3) The gist of what Odysseus is saying is, of course, that there are limits to knowledge, the outer bounds being suggested in the obvious unknowns of cosmology, a science at which the Ionians were unusually adept. But in contrast with the unknowns, there are the knowns: in this case, for Odysseus, the sequence of night and day and these new unproven physical surroundings. In these things lay reality and pos sibility. Homer's flux, in other words, has islands in it; a limited and all-important island-thing has emerged from the deep. This is a form of materialism, certainly; and the gods, who are themselves often fan cifully associated with islands, would inevitably play only a flickering unsubstantial part in it. Islands of experience, while substantial enough in their way, are also subject to limitations of their own. If, as Heraclitus maintained, "you can't step into the same river twice," still you may reply that that river remains that river and no other, and that by the same rule it can never douse the same "you" a second time. But maybe all we need to say is what has been said through a couple of millennia and some centuries to boot. The Odyssey laughs and weeps with the day at hand, and remains true to the longings of a lifetime. Mr. Fitzgerald's translation is nowhere dull, is always alive, like the wine-dark sea. With the pleasant smoke of one's own country to be sighted so clearly in it, it tempts one to think that this must be truly something like Homer's country.</page></plain_text>
