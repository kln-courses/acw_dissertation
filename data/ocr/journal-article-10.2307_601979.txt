<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Language and Imagery of the Bible. By G. B. CAIRD. Pp. viii + 280. Philadelphia: THE WESTMINSTER PRESS. 1980. $20.00. In 1961 James Barr published The Semantics of Biblical Language, an important and carefully reasoned volume in which he sought to undermine the notion that one could infer the structure of ancient Israelite thinking directly from the linguistic forms of Biblical Hebrew. Stimulated in part by Barr's work, G. B. Caird, Professor of Exegesis of Holy Scripture at Oxford and author of several books on the Christian Bible, has written Tihe Language and Imagery of the Bible in order to explain how the differences between the biblical worldview and ours would be greatly diminished were we to appreciate the various non-literal types of dis- course and their uses in scripture. Although Caird states in the Preface that "This is a book by an amateur, written for amateurs," his citation of source material, his pedantic ten- dency to define and refine technical terms, and his frontal assault on major scholars such as Mowinckel, Bultmann, and Wheeler Robinson, serve to enter this book into the scholarly arena. In seeking to break down the "linguistic obstacles to communication" that, Caird maintains, prevent the modern reader from hearing the proper sense of the Bible, he clarifies the various functions of language, types of meaning, qualities of language (such as ambiguity), the relationship between thought and language, the wide uses of metaphorical lan- guage, and the evolution of eschatology in its diverse stages. He also devotes space to the Christian Scriptures' under- standing and utilization of the Hebrew Bible, the Septuagint, and the general problem of translation. Notably missing is reference to that magisterial 1975 book on language and translation, George Steiner's After Babel. Caird's writing is characteristically lucid and elegant and displays intelligence. Yet he feels no need to justify his theoretical postures; he approaches his subjects with an array of partisan positions and attitudes. His work acknowledges the influence of J. L. Austin's speech act theory, and his concept of meaning is clearly anti-phenomenological and author-oriented (see e.g., pp. 39-40, 68, 165, 186ff., 217). The book's marked Protestant thrust would not offend were it not coupled with patently anti-ritual and anti-Jewish obser.- vations (see, e.g., at pp. 31, 71, 143, 167). Embedded within the</page><page sequence="2">658 Journal of the American Oriental Society 102.4 (1982) ostensibly dispassionate exposition is an argument holding that Judaism is literal-minded and ritualistic, while Chris- tianity is properly metaphorical and spiritual (see, e.g., pp. 156-57). Caird's manifest ignorance of Rabbinic Judaism does not lend credibility to his opinionizing on this score. Students of the ancient Near East may, like me, take special interest in Caird's discussion of the anthropomorphic representations of God in the Hebrew Bible (pp. 172-82). Caird tries to demonstrate that the apparent biblical percep- tion of God as human-like should in no way be understood literally. His argument is vulnerable on a number of sides. First, the reasoning is fallacious. Caird alleges that the use of inanimate and animal imagery in speaking of God "provides a useful corrective to anthropomorphic metaphor" (p. 174). In the Bible and throughout ANE literature, however, such imagery is also applied to human beings. Second, Caird's citation and exegesis of scripture is selective and moot. He altogether ignores narratives, such as Gen. 18, in which God himself appears as an ordinary man. He adduces prophetic verses to the effect that "God is not like mankind, subject to vacillation and weakness" (p. 175) without considering such passages as Gen. 6:6-7. Third, Caird displays barely a super- ficial acquaintance with ANE scholarship, much less with its textual and pictorial sources. Even a cursory flipping through Pritchard's A NEP should give one pause before arguing that Psalm 18's description of YHWH gliding down through the clouds on a winged sphinx, bellowing thunder-claps and casting down lightning-bolts as arrows, is no more than a figurative representation of the Lord's rain-making power. In contending that Davidic kingship was patterned after an ideal of divine kingship, Caird fails to see the image of the righteous king in its widespread ANE context (a comparison of the epilogue to Codex Hammurapi and portions of the Ugaritic epics of Aqhat and Keret with Psalm 72 would only provide a start). He neglects to ask whether the royal vision of YHWH historically preceded the Davidic ideology and whether the kingship ideal in Israel was more likely to have been modelled after the conception of YHWH or adopted from a common ANE idea. It is regrettable that Caird did not heed the methodological exhortations of Barr when, in the above-mentioned book, he called for a systematic linguistic study of both Hebrew and Greek as a prerequisite to the theological analysis of the Bible and for a comparative study of "the Canaanites, the Arabs and the Babylonians" in order to achieve an under- standing of the distinctive ideas of the Hebrew Bible.
