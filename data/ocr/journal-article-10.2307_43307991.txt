<plain_text><page sequence="1">DONALD GILMAN "Tel art plus divin que humain": The Reality of Fantasy In Ronsard' s Poetic Practice Like poet his of Renaissance convention. contemporaries, By assimilating Pierre recovered de Ronsard and recon- is a poet of convention. By assimilating recovered and recon- structed knowledge of classical culture, he anthologizes ancient myths, themes, and concepts, and, adhering to the expectations of the sixteenth-century poet-humanist, expresses his ency- clopedic learning in accepted genres, schemes, conceits, and rhe- torical styles. It may be that Ronsard's originality lies in an eclectic blending of classical allusions, but such a borrowing of traditional topics and techniques seems to preclude any sugges- tion of the fantastic. Readers of his poetry, however, continu- ally encounter the presence of illusion: visions imagined in dreams or recalled in memory; fanciful thoughts on the chang- ing shapes of clouds; the diverse sounds displayed in nature, emitted from a bagpipe, or inherent in a lyre; the complex asso- ciations conveyed by the substance and form of glass (McFar- lane; Castor). Symbolism was not a nineteenth-century French discovery, and synaesthesia can be traced back at least to the Book of Exodus or to the epics of Homer (Engstrom, 11-14). But Ronsard's vision of horses feeding on air or his description of the cries and weeping of trees blurs the boundaries between re- ality and illusion. Constant revision, experimentation of form, and the reorder- ing of poems in various collections testify to Ronsard's attempts to chart a course between a Scylla of objective description and a Charybdis of imaginary expression. During the middle of his career, he appears to have discovered a means to mold his con- Journal of the Fantastic in the Arts/ 1988, Vol. 1, No. 2 35</page><page sequence="2">36 JOURNAL OF THE FANTASTIC IN THE ARTS jurings of the fantastic to the exigencies of conventional form. In his poem "Hylas" (1569), he likens the successful poet to a bee, extracting and reworking thoughts, motifs, and tropes culled from numerous texts (Vol. 15, pt. 2, pp. 252-53, w. 417- 30). 1 1n spite of strained similitudes and jarringrepresentations, the poet is for Ronsard a painter who, as Ann Moss has recently noted, relies upon the rhetorical technique of contaminano, and who, by "collecting textual allusions from diverse sources, then juxtaposing them and amalgamating them, imitates the ordered synthesis of nature and her infinitely variable multiplicity" (Moss, p. 119). Through the borrowing of Pindar's comparison of the writer and bee,2 and through his reference to the Horatian concept of poetry as a sort of painting,3 Ronsard submits again to inviolable commonplace, and his originality of thought seems to lie solely in the application of contaminatio to an explanation of his own poetic practice. Although Moss argues convincingly and correctly for Ron- sard's innovation of sophisticated structures of poetic discourse (Moss, ch. 7; Cave), he nevertheless shapes his mythological nar- rative, metaphorical transferences, and ecstatic musings to the realistic restrictions of convention. But if illusion ultimately yields to reason, Ronsard does not overlook, in theory or prac- tice, the significance of the fantastic. An examination of his thoughts on the process of poetic creativity will define his con- cept of the fantastic, its place and role in the writing of verse, l Pierre de Ronsard, Oeuvres complètes, ed.

In his "Ode à Michel de l'Hospital" (1553), Ronsard describes the inspired nature of poetic creativity (Vol. 3: pp. 142-43, w. 409-42, and pp. 149-150, v. 545).4 According to Ronsard, the an- cient poet-prophet was an unlettered bard who, as a passive agent of the gods, perceived cosmic mysteries and transmitted them to man. Like Homer's Demodocus or Hesiod's unskilled shepherd,5 Ronsard's poet-seer relies upon Apollo, the Muses, and other intermediary spirits to convey truth. As a human in- fused by one of the four furors (prophetic, poetic, sacerdotal, or erotic), the poet-uafes becomes detached from his physical sur- roundings and, recalling Horace's portrait of the unkempt De- mocritus ( Horace , Ars Poetica , v. 297), seems insane to those around him. In spite of the poet's physical appearance, Ronsard stresses the sanctity of the poet-prophet who fulfills his earthly role as a spokesman of the gods and counselor of princes. This picture of the inspired poet does not change in Ronsard's Abbregé de l'art poétique françoys (1565). But whereas the poet's madness seems only to be implied in the ode to Michel de l'Hospi- tal by his nocturnal haunting of caves, meadows, and streams, his craft, as Ronsard describes it in the Abbregé, does not corre- spond to reality. The poet does not lie. But Ronsard must admit that the inspired holy force stimulating the poet's faculty of im- agination in the "Ode" becomes a theological allegory in the Ab- bregé. On the surface, the poet relates amusing tales that he amplifies, colors, and develops. As Terence Cave has demon- 4.

By borrowing the technique of ecphrasis employed by Homer in his description of Achilles's shield or by Catullus in his depic- tion of Peleus and Thetis's wedding coverlet,6 Ronsard recounts myths evoked by sculpted, painted, or embroidered scenes, and fits these tableaux to a poem's thematic dimensions. Such poetic pictures reaffirm his dependence upon classical convention. But if he appears to be harmlessly using an ancient stylistic device to disguise moral teaching in the form of a satisfying story, his contemporaries attacked his telling of fable and description of fantasy. In particular, Louis Le Caron details, in his Dialogues (1556), the dangers of fiction. According to his interlocutor Pasquier, who voices Plato's concerns on the moral justification of art, fable satisfies man's search for pleasure but instills virtue only among the mature and learned.7 For the masses, poetry is an obstacle to moral edification and understanding. And since artistic imitation is twice removed from reality, the abstract les- son concealed by the pleasurable fable is, in the end, an uncer- tain opinion (Le Caron, fol. 145v.; Plato, Republic. 10. pp. 596c-596e, 598e-599c, 602b-c, 605c). As an interlocutor in Le Caron's Dialogues , Ronsard was un- doubtedly aware of the arguments against his use of fantasy and fiction. Many Protestants, moreover, were incensed by his use of the fantastic, and accused him of stepping beyond the borders of truth when, in his "Hercule chrestien" (1555), he compares 6 Homer, Iliad , ed. and trans A.

In his polemical verse of 1562-63, he responds to their vitriolic charges of his madness, accusing them of arrogance, viciousness, and delusion (Higman, pp. 255-61). He claims in his "Response aux injures et calomnies" (1563) that his poetry seems, on first reading, to be incoherent, rambling, and fanciful. But he cau- tions his readers not be deceived by his diversions into fantasy, for this appearance of illusion is the reflection of reality. The reader must extract the kernel of truth from the shell of the fable. Unlike the orator or preacher who structures his argu- ment logically and systemically, the poet practices an "art caché." And by submitting to the gentle but forceful goadings of the Muse, the creative writer, like the bee, finds the substance of his verse to include every aspect of nature (Vol. 11: pp. 159- 61, w. 847-92). For Ronsard, then, poetry is an allegorical theology. As Isidore Silver has clearly shown, he draws upon the technique of alle- goresis, which was employed by the ancient interpreters of Homer, medieval mythographers and exigetes, and Renaissance theorists, and which enables him to justify his creative individu- ality and poetic representations of the fantastic (Silver, chap. 11). Although allegoresis effectively defends his craft of fiction, two questions on the nature of poetic creativity cry for a re- sponse: (1) How does the practicing poet discover an object of imitation? (2) If the poem conveys impressions of the unreal, how does the poet assure a successful and accurate transmission of the truth? These questions on artistic mimesis reach beyond analyses of stylistic expression. And by raising doubts on the means of finding the source of his inspired insight and of fitting fiction to fact, Ronsard must describe the search and repre- sentation of the fantastic in terms of a psychological process adaptable to the needs and capabilities of a sixteenth-century practicing poet. Although Ronsard adheres to a belief in poetic inspiration through his theoretical writings, he recognizes, in his "Ode à Michel de l'Hospital," the differences between the ancient poet- prophet unconsciously communicating divine insight and the Renaissance poet-craftsman laboriously employing learned skills and techniques (Gilman). The sixteenth-century poet therefore could not be identified with the Homeric bard or He-</page><page sequence="6">40 JOURNAL OF THE FANTASTIC IN THE ARTS siodic shepherd; but the writing of verse without substance is, on the other hand, a waste of time and talent. Ronsard theorizes a third sort of poet, the "poëte humain," who, combining charac- teristics of the inspired poet and versifier, recreates a divine vi- sion in a form intelligible to man: "Par un art mélancolique / Trahissoyent avec grand soing / Leurs vers. . . (Vol. 3, p. 143, w. 575-77). In his "Hymne des daimons" (1555), Ronsard con- tinues to describe the influence exerted by spiritual beings on man's perceptions (Lafeuille, ch. 5; Levi, pp. 151-52), but the human poet's melancholy temperament enables him to explain the poet's flights of fantasy (Gilman, pp. 91-95). As Raymond Klibansky, Erwin Panofsky, and Fritz Saxl have demonstrated, Renaissance thinkers accepted and reworked the Aristolelian concept of melancholy as a malady afflicting philos- ophers, poets, sibyls, and soothsayers (1964). For Aristotle, mel- ancholy is a natural humor, and later natural scientists attribute this temperament to divinely ordained astral move- ments. The ninth-century Arabic astrologer al-Kindi associates melancholy with the planet Saturn (Klibansky, pp. 128-29). Astral forces do not determine human action; but, according to the fifteenth-century Florentine humanist Marsilio Ficino (Klibansky, pp. 254-74; Kristeller, pp. 211-14), the planetary rays emanating from Saturn induce within the poet a melan- choly temperament that predisposes him to create verse. The poet retains his faculty of reason, which accounts for the use of free will. And if holy insight does not directly infuse the soul and guide the pen of the human poet, his melancholy nature in- directly receives influences exerted by divine will and happen- ings and, as part of his natural talent or ingenium, enables him to respond to a spiritual calling ultimately leading to a percep- tion of universal truth. In his Abbregé, Ronsard repeats his classification of the three sorts of poets: the ancient poet-prophet, the craftsman of the commonplace, and the human poet (Vol. 16, pp. 4-5). Natural talent enables the human poet to formulate lofty and divine con- ceptions; and, although Ronsard advises the aspiring poet to seek his subject matter in the writings of ancient authors, he does not argue for an eclectic plagiarism of diverse sources. Rather, like his contemporaries Badius Ascensius, Pierre Fabri, Thomas Sebillet, Joachim Du Bellay, and Jacques Peletier du</page><page sequence="7">TEL ART PLUS DIVIN QUE HUMAIN 41 Mans, he adapts the threefold rhetorical procedure to the poetic process which includes, in successive order: (1) invention, or the discovery of the subject matter; (2) disposition, or the arrange- ment of the material; and (3) elocution, or stylistic expression (Silver, ch. 10; Castor, ch. 9). In searching for the material of his verse, the poet must employ the faculty of imagination which projects within his mind pictures derived from heavenly and earthly, animate and motionless representations. These images become the source of his poetic imitation. Reason, however, must guide selection, for a random or comprehensive repre- sentation of the invented images may result in incoherent, non- sensical discourse. After determining and ordering the material, the poet employs his knowledge and labor to mold the invented and arranged subject matter to an appropriate poetic form. Ronsard views an indiscriminate imitation of the imagined material as the source of monstrous, fantastic poetry. But his al- lusion to the powers of the imagination indicates the signifi- cance of faculty psychology in the poetic process and, in my view, defines Ronsard as a poet of the fantastic. In his interrelation of the process of invention and the faculty of imagination, Ronsard is clearly drawing upon ancient and me- dieval ideas of learning that Renaissance humanists interpreted and reworked.8 The most complete description of this faculty psychology is perhaps found in Avicenna's eleventh-century Canon of Medicine which, translated from Arabic to Latin by Gerard of Cremona, underwent eleven editions by 1500. Elaborating upon Aristotle and Galen, Avicenna designates three ventricles of the brain which account for the capabilities of the mind to collect and interpret phenomenal impressions. The front section contains the imagination, and reason and memory are respectively situated in the middle and rear ven- 8 For a study of the tradition and development of faculty psychology, see Murray W Gundy, The Theory of Imagination in Classical and Mediaeval Thought (Urbana: University of Illinois Press, 1927), and E.

The imagination gathers all sensations through the sen- sus communis. The faculty of phantasia, also housed in the im- agination and located adjacent to the sensus communis , retains and reproduces these sense impressions. As part of the faculty of imagination, phantasia plays a crucial role in the abstraction of the sensible forms, for in order to guarantee an accurate in- terpretation, it transmits them to the middle ventricle for dis- cernment or judgment. The middle segment, or the virtus cogitativa, receives the sense impressions forwarded by the im- agination. By combining or dividing these impressions immedi- ately received from the imaginations or retrieved from the storehouse of memory, it creates the inwardly perceived vision. Discrimination is therefore a significant operation of the cognitive wit, for it determines, on the basis of experience, the sense impressions that the faculty of memory will preserve. And through its powers of discernment, it recognizes the validity of the forms which it will combine or separate to produce the im- pression imprinted within the mind. In adapting this faculty psychology to his thoughts on the poetic process, Ronsard is aware that the poet may visualize, through disease or excessive melancholy, distorted impressions or wild imaginings.9 The poet attempts to reproduce in verse the forms projected by the imagi- nation. But just as the cognitive wit assures an appropriate and intelligible representation, the step of disposition in the poetic process regulates an accurate and logical expression of this ob- ject of imitation apprehended by the poet's inner eye. Poetic invention, then, reflects and depends upon the work- ings of the imagination. Although Ronsard, in recasting the story of Hylas, appears conventional in his use of myths and im- ages borrowed from ancient authors, the diversity of his eclecti- cism and original handling and combination of traditional forms demonstrates his employment of the faculty of imagination to create an impression of the fantastic. Like the image of the polli- nating bee presented at the conclusion of the poem, Ronsard in- tegrates into his narrative structure the accounts of the myth recorded by Apollonius of Rhodes in his Argonautica, Theocri- 9 See, in particular, "Elegie à Jacques Grevin," 9: p. 23, w. 51-52; Abbregé de I 'art poétique françoys, Vol. 14, p. 13; "Préface sur la Franciade" ( 1587), 16, pt. 2, p. 334.</page><page sequence="9">TEL ART PLUS DIVIN QUE HUMAIN 43 tus in his "Idyll 13," and Valerius Flaccus in his work, Argonau- iica.10 Ronsard does not deviate from the story told in his clas- sical sources. Hylas, son of Thiodamus, king of the Dryopians, and of the nymph Menodice, becomes the squire of Hercules and accompanies him on the voyage of Jason and Argonauts. As Hylas draws water from the fountain of Pegae, Dryope, nymph of the fountain, falls in love with his beauty and, along with her sister nymphs, pulls him into the well. Upon learning of the loss of Hylas, Hercules is left behind by the Argonauts and, hearing Hylas's faint echo from the spring, mourns the drowning of his friend. Although Ronsard presents a narrative faithful to his classi- cal sources, the drowning of Hylas forms only the second half of the poem. In the first part Ronsard centers attention on the labors of Hercules: his slaying of the three-headed monster Ger- yon (pp. 235-36, w. 25-32); his amorous encounter with Galatea (pp. 236-37, w. 33-56); his killing of the Numean lion (pp. 237, w. 57-64) ; and his various adventures on his j ourney with J ason (pp. 238-42, w. 93-180). In spite of the title of the work, the tale of Hylas is clearly embedded within the fable of Hercules, and 10 See also Appollodorus, The Library , ed. and trans. Sir James George Frazer, 2 vols.

He recognizes, moreover, a need to reaffirm the heroism of Hercules; and, in al- luding to the attacks against Hercules by Aristophanes, Euripides, and Seneca,11 he refutes charges of his nefariousness as a kidnapper, rapist, thief, murderer, and madman. Thus, the myth of Hylas becomes increasingly obscured and seems to serve as a significant event in an encomium of Hercules who, through his actions as the Gallic Hercules, contributes to the political and cultural emergences of sixteenth-century France.12 This reworking of myth departs from the expectations of the Renaissance reader. Theocritus's erotic tale of Hercules's rape of Hylas dissolves into a reaffirmation of the hero's virtue. Apol- lonius of Rhodes's portrayal of Hercules's role on the Argonaut voyage provides only a backdrop for a description of his labors and grief. And in their account of Hercules's heroism, Renais- sance mythographers only allude to, and sometimes completely overlook, the episode of Hylas.13 By any standard, myths con- vey impressions of the unreal and, like Plato, the reader must acknowledge their fiction. The labors of Hercules, though, go beyond the limits of verisimilitude. In brief, the narratives of the killing of a three-headed monster, the fathering of a child with the Nereid Galatea, and the singlehanded uprooting of a pine violate expectations of the real and, along with the nymphs' snatching of Hylas, convey illusions of the fantastic. Besides these elaborations of mythological fiction, Ronsard further develops the fanciful by situating the narrative in the East, in lands controlled in the sixteenth century by the Turks 11 15, pt. 2, p. 235, note 1; Jung, p. 102, n. 30: and Galinsky, chaps. 4 and 8. 12 Laumonier (15, pt. 2, p. 234 n. 2) traces the legend of the Gallic Hercules from Lucian ( Herakles 4. 6), whose works were translated from Greek into Latin by Erasmus.

New York: Garland, 1976), p. 241, only mentions the source of the myth as that of Theocritus's "Idyll 13." Boccaccio, De genealogia deorum, and Natalis comis, Mythologiae, overlook the myth of Hylas.</page><page sequence="11">TEL ART PLUS DIVIN QUE HUMAIN 45 and distant from the immediate surroundings of western Europe or from the explorations in the New World. The personi- fication of Fame ("la Renommée") (p. 238, w. 91-94), the descent to earth of the winged brothers Calais and Zetes (p. 242, w. 187- 89), the presence of fauns and fairies (pp. 244-45, w. 229-52), and the appearance of the speaking shadow of the deceased Hylas expand the creation of fantasy (pp. 250-52, w. 371-416). And through the hidden allusion to the transformation of humans into flowers (pp. 243-44, w. 211-28), and through the description of the metamorphosis of anthropomorphic gods into swans or bulls (pp. 245-46, w. 261-72), Ronsard leads his reader into an imaginary, transcendental consciousness. But behind this representation of illusion, Ronsard describes the pain, the intensity of human emotion, the reality of death, and the con- stancy of a continually changing cosmos. The fantastic labors of the mythic hero become the realistic responsibilities of mortal man, for the virtue that prompts Hercules to honor God, respect his neighbors, and cultivate nature exemplifies the moral ideal of humankind. As we know from our reading of ancient accounts, Hercules may have been a giant. But his prodigious strength extends bey- ond physical feats; and, pursued by the jealous designs of Juno for being the son of Jupiter's paramour, he must psychologically endure the troubles and travail of a mortal. Like man, Hercules faces the inevitable dilemma of following a life of dissolute pleasure or a course of unrelenting toil. In selecting the road of virtue, he demonstrates courage, perseverance, and compassion. Yet the temptation of pleasure remains present. Recalling the words of Tiresias to Odysseus, or paralleling the prophesies of Anchises to Aeneas (Homer, Odyssey 9. 51-80, and Virgil, Aeneid 6. 724-885), the shadow of Hylas predicts Hercules's destiny of suffering, labor, and cruel death. His earthly accomplishments, however, will assure a divine immortality and, according to Hylas, affirms the triumph of virtue over the demise of pleasure (Vol. 14, pt. 2: p. 252, w. 411-14; Laumonier, 252, n.2). The destiny that Hercules and Hylas endure reflects the an- guish of all living creatures. Through use of a dialectic of fan- tasy and reality, Ronsard describes a human struggle that enables man to attain heroic stature. In the passage detailing</page><page sequence="12">46 JOURNAL OF THE FANTASTIC IN THE ARTS Hercules's slaying of Geryon, he likens the monster's cattle to shining, beautiful stars: ... tu pris pour ta conqueste Ses boeufs cornus, ses boeufs au large front Aux pieds retors, qui luisoient come font Ces Astres beaux, lors qu'une Nuit sereine D'une grand dance in biez les pourmiene Et font jallir ça et là de leurs yeux, De petitz feux qui honorent les Cieux. (pp. 235-36, w. 26-32) At first glance, the metaphor of terrestrial oxen and ethereal planets suggests the employment of a distended comparison, and supplies his critics with justification to label his poetry as the work of a madman. On closer examination, though, the al- lusion to the dance of the stars indicates the constancy of a divinely ordered universe (Laumonier Vol. 15, pt. 2: 235, note 3). Like the stars, the oxen take their place in the cosmos. Later, in borrowing Lucretius's image of the dying cattle which suffer the pain of sacrificial slaughter and grieve the loss of offspring (De rerum natura, 2: pp. 353-60), Ronsard depicts Hercules's mourning of Hylas and, at the same time, describes the need of all living creatures to submit to divine will. Passion motivates the nymphs' rape of Hylas, and Ronsard compares the nymphs' consolation of the boy with a sea cap- tain's recognition of a star, a favorable wind, and a command to sail (p. 247, w. 309-16). Perhaps this recasting of Theocritus 's metaphor seems irrelevant and unintelligible. But in respecting the astral influence exerted upon earthly events, the captain yields to a favorable moment for travel. Similarly, the arrow of Venus inflicts the nymphs with an erotic furor (p. 245, w. 265- 72); and Hylas, in following a deer guided by the avenging Juno (p. 243, w. 201-10), finds the fountain where he must meet his end. Hylas's instruction becomes Hercules's lesson. Submission to the call of destiny characterizes the nature of virtue. Like Aeneas's obedience to the divine destiny of the founding of Rome, Hercules's will, courage, and strength elevate him to heroic stature: the Gallic Hercules who will assist the French to realize the glory and honor of civilized culture. Ronsard, then, is a poet who employs convention to express his vision of the fantastic. Early in his career, he recognized that</page><page sequence="13">TEL ART PLUS DIVIN QUE HUMAIN 47 the sixteenth-century practicing poet could not be identified with the ancient poet-prophet. Poetic conventions and rhetori- cal techniques are the craftsman's tools. But as we have seen, the human poet perceives into cosmic happening and universal truth. Endowed with a melancholy temperament that pre- disposes him to create poetry, the practicing poet depends upon his faculty of imagination to discover, or invent, the substance of his verse. Reason must temper his imaginative visions which, as the object of imitation, are reshaped to the restrictions of in- telligible form. In his posthumous "Préface sur la Franciade" (1587), Ronsard compares once again the craft of the poet to the work of a bee (Vol. 16, p. 336). Nature provides the material for artistic mimesis, but the images received and interpreted by the poet form only the shape of an idea. In shifting, combining, adding, deleting, and recasting his mental impressions, the prac- ticing poet transfers the actuality of the recognizable into the fantasy of the illusionary. The use of reason assures coherence of argumentation. But like the ancient poet-prophet, Ronsard is a maker of myth and metaphor, and the fantasy that he creates in "Hylas" reflects the shadow of a concrete reality which the poet renders as an "art plus divin que humain" (Vol. 16, p. 337). The conventions of form become therefore the substance of fan- tasy. In his poetic recreation of the imaginary, Ronsard employs Renaissance precepts of theory; as a fabricator and interpreter of myth, he transforms the symbols of fantasy into signs of re- ality.
