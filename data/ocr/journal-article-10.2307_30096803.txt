<plain_text><page sequence="1">A LATE MINOAN TOMB AT KNOSSOS (PLATES 6-8) DURING the course of agricultural operations on the vineyard of one Kosti Psilakis, south of the Temple Tomb and on the opposite side of the Herakleion-Arkhanes road, three vases in stone and two in pottery were uncovered by the cultivator and were appropriated by the Herakleion Museum. On 24 April I940 Miss Vronwy Fisher (now Mrs. Hankey) and I excavated the site on behalf of the British School at Athens and uncovered a very small chamber tomb, of which most of the chamber walls and all of the dromos walls had been cut away. One or possibly two L.M. III burials had suffered severely, but the earliest burial on the inmost or western side of the chamber seems to have remained undisturbed until I940o, when Psilakis began to lay out a vineyard here. Of the three stone vases found by the owner of the land before our excavations, the most imposing was a handsome jug (x8) in the material which the Greeks termed alabaster, but which modern authorities usually term calcite. The material looks Egyptian, but M. l'Abb6 Drioton has assured me that the shape is not an Egyptian one. The stone is also not a Minoan one, and I am inclined to think the vase was made in Cyprus or Syria, especially as a con- temporary deposit in the Royal Tomb at Isopata contained ajug of undoubtedly Cypriote form in the same kind of 'alabaster'. The small ovoid jar 17 in a black and white breccia, a Cretan material, is roughly modelled in the form of the body of a man wearing a wide-sleeved coat. The lid, presumably modelled in the form of a head, is missing. Anthropoid vases are more charac- teristic of Middle than of Late Minoan deposits, but the absence of the head makes it hard to date this vase securely on typological grounds. The third stone vase recovered by the owner is a small nest-shaped bowl (9g)I in grey steatite with horizontal ribbing between the shoulder and the lip, and might be dated on style anywhere between the M.M. I and L.M. I periods. The two pottery vessels found by Psilakis were beaked jugs (4, 5) adorned in the L.M. II style, and a third similar vase (3) was found during the excavation. During our excavation we uncovered the inhumation burial (I) of an adult man to whom these vases had belonged. The skull was broken and displaced; but the skeleton as a whole, though in bad condition, was in situ with the feet pointing north-east and the body laid out on its back. Underneath the skeleton was a bronze sword (x6), presumably slung from the shoulder by a baldric. The flanged hilt with its horned guard is of a type well known in Crete from L.M. IB to L.M. IIIA times, and equally familiar on the mainland. The hilt plates had perished, but the six flat-headed rivets, which had decorated the hilt, were still preserved. The blade was complete, but snapped across in three places. Touching the sword on the west were the remains of a metal cup (x4), of which much of the bowl was missing; but the rim and base of silver plated on a bronze core were well preserved, and so was the strap handle with a cable pattern in gold. Adjacent to the cup was a silver pin (x5) of the type described by Evans as a hairpin, and by Blinkenberg as une simple epingle replide, and regarded by him as the immediate predecessor of the violin-bow fibula.2 The other finds associated with this burial (I) were a blossom vase in purple gypsum (2x), complete with lid (22), found near the skull, a low stemmed kylix (x), a knob lid for a pyxis (x3), probably employed as a cover for the steatite bowl x9g, and two squat alabastra (xo, xI).

SCALE 1:4</page><page sequence="3">70 R. W. HUTCHINSON All the finds from this burial (I) belong to the transition between the L.M. II and L.M. III periods. Furumark, I think, would call them L.M. IIIA I, and I would agree that they corre- spond to his L.M. IIIA I material; but I prefer to call them L.M. IIB and to equate the destruction of the Palace of Minos with the end of that period. In recent years the excavations of Hood and de Jong at Ayios Ioannis and on the site of the New Hospital at Knossos, together with those of Alexiou at the Harbour Town, have un- covered tombs approximately contemporary with ours and no less richly endowed-all of them presumably to be dated before the destruction of the Palace of Minos. We can now fill in the picture of the L.M. II style, which when Evans and Pendlebury wrote their books was mainly represented by the great Palace amphorae with only the later vases from the Temple Tomb to tell us what were the smaller vases of the L.M. II period. The horned sword might date anywhere between 1550 and 1350; but the metal cup is a L.M. II type related to the fine bronze basin from the North-West treasury at Knossos.' The silver pin belongs to a group cited by Blinkenberg,2 who quotes one from Koumasa, two from Palaikastro, two from Gournia (all in bronze), and one from Isopata (in gold). To these we may add one from the Fourth Shaft-grave at Mycenae. It appears therefore to be more a Cretan than a Mainland type, and the Koumasa example can hardly be later than the M.M. period. Of the two alabastra one (xo) has the cruciform design on the base typical of the L.H. II period on the mainland, and the other (xix) the concentric circles typical of the L.H. III period. Just inside the entrance from the dromos on the south side remains of a second burial (II) were found, consisting of two small vases (7, 12) and a few fragments of human bones. These vases were too weathered to allow of their decoration being restored, and it is clear that this part of the tomb must have been exposed to the air, while the earlier burial was protected (presumably by earth fallen from the roof). Near the entrance from the dromos, but some centimetres distant from the above vases, we found a quantity of fragments of bronze which at the time we could not interpret, but which may have been staples for the attachment of leather armour like those found by Hood and de Jong in Tomb III on the New Hospital site,3 and more recently in a second Warrior Grave at Ayios loannis (see below, pp. 85 f.); these may therefore have belonged to the earlier burial.
