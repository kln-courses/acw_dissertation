<plain_text><page sequence="1">HERMANN COHEN AND MORDECAI M. KAPLAN BY ALEXANDER S. KOHANSKI The recent publication of Mordecai M. Kaplan's Purpose and Meaning of Jewish Existence adds another dimension to the author's place in the realm of Jewish thought. In his previous writings Dr. Kaplan developed his concepts of Jewish religion, peoplehood, ethics, and modem man in a thought-complex which he designated as "Reconstructionism" or "Judaism as a Civilization." In his latest book he posits his conceptions of Judaism in direct comparison with those of other thinkers in Jewish history, Philo, Maimonides, Buber and, notably, Hermann Cohen's Die Religion der Vernunft aus den Quellen des Judentums (Religion of Reason from the Sources of Judaism.)' As the author states in his Preface: "The main portion of this book deals with Hermann Cohen's exposition of Judaism as a rational religion." In Part I, after a brief analysis of the Mosaic Torah, Philo, and Maimonides, there follows an essay on Cohen. Part II, which is more than half of the book, is devoted to an Epitome of the Religion der Vernunft, chapter by chapter, with a running commentary in the form of extensive footnotes. The added dimension in this latest of Dr. Kaplan's writings is a philosophi- cal one. The author juxtaposes his own philosophy of "functional rationalism" and "Judaism as a Civilization" against what he considers to be Cohen's "idea- tionist rationalism" and "Judaism as a religion, and a religion only." It is due to this difference in philosophical outlook that he finds Cohen's view a "misunder- standing of Judaism." In the biographical account of Cohen (1842-1918), Dr. Kaplan points to his early Jewish and general education, his unconsummated prep- aration for the rabbinate, his later estrangement from the Jewish people, even to advocacy of total assimilation. Cohen became professor of philosophy at Mar- burg University in Germany and was a leading spirit in the neo-Kantian move- ment. He wrote several important works on ethics and religion, but they were basically unrelated to Judaism, as such, which he had thought would in time merge with a newly created "German Religion." Toward the end of his life, how- ever, he returned as a penitent to the Jewish fold. He then wrote his Religion der Vernunft, which was published after his death, in 1918. Dr. Kaplan glosses over Cohen's personal break with the past as of no great 1 The main references in this article are: Kaplan's book under discussion, published by The Jewish Publication Society of America (Philadelphia 1964), referred to by page num- ber in parentheses; Hermann Cohen's Die Religion der Vernunft aus den Quellen des Juden- tums (Leipzig 1919), referred to as RV; Kant's Kritik der reinen Vernunft, Kirchmann, zweite Auflage (Berlin 1870), referred to as Kritik.

He still considers the Religion der Vernunft as Cohen's "final formulation of what he regarded as the rational and viable ele- ment in Judaism, ... [which] he believed would ultimately become the religion of the entire German nation" (48). The author, thus, does not distinguish between the several stages in Cohen's development which led him to the writing of his last work, and which are relevant to an understanding of his position in the last years of his life. This is not the place to go into a full analysis of this aspect of Cohen's personal life. Suffice it to compare his earlier assimilationist tendency with a statement in his last book, where among other things he pleads passion- ately for the preservation of Hebrew in Jewish prayer and in the instruction of Judaism. Concerning the relationship of Jews to the general culture in Germany, he writes: "The principle [of that relationship] is the specific content of Jewish monotheism and its inevitable isolation" (RV, 461). Dr. Kaplan's Epitome On the whole, Cohen comes out very pale from under Kaplan's scalpel. It does not "shock the reader," as the author forewarns, that he should "go to the trouble of publicizing" Cohen's treaties if he thinks it "is a misunderstanding of Judaism" (v). The sages of the Talmud went to the trouble of publishing a whole Tractate of unaccepted views in order "to teach the future generations" not to fall into the same errors (Eduyot, 1:4). Rather, what may be puzzling the reader is that in presenting Hermann Cohen, Dr. Kaplan does not allow him to appear his full-blooded self. To reduce a volume of 544 pages of German philosophical writing to about a tenth of its size in an English summary is in itself a grand un- dertaking on the part of the author. However, the brevity of many passages in the Epitome very often obscure their meaning and sometimes convey a miscon- ception of the original. There are some difficulties in translation which have not been totally overcome, including the rendition of the very title of the book as Rational Religion, instead of Religion of Reason. Another obstacle, and not the least one, is the reflection of Kaplan's own mode of thinking in the summary. Large portions of the Epitome read like Cohen "reconstructed" in Dr. Kaplan's terminology. For the author feels that those "insights" that are valid in Cohen's book are his (Dr. Kaplan's) own philosophical province. He, therefore, allows himself to say that "Cohen arrives at his second seminal idea, that God is the correlate of man. In other words, Divinity is to be conceived as that aspect of nature which impels and helps man to transcend his animal nature" (58). Both the phrasing of the meaning of correlation and its expansion into "other words" are, to be sure, Kaplan's views, but not Cohen's. In his own words, the latter states: ". . . man as a rational being is the correlate to the God of revelation."2 As will be shown later, this is an entirely different conception of God, man, and animal nature and their interrelations than the one rendered by Dr. Kaplan. Basic in Dr. Kaplan's summary of the Religion der Vernunft is his argu- 2 RV, 92: "... der Mensch, als Vernunftwesen, ist das Korrelat zum Gotte der Offen- barung."</page><page sequence="3">Hermann Cohen and Mordecai M. Kaplan 157 ment "that Judaism was to Cohen a philosophical religion . . . compatible with absolute reason" (v, 54). Cohen, however, spends his entire Introduction and many lengthy passages in the body of his book to establish his thesis on the op- posite ground, that "philosophy is not religion" and that absolute reason is not its criterion. This leads to many serious discrepancies between Cohen's original text and Kaplan's Epitome. Cohen's Neo-Kantianism In order to obviate a battle of words, it is necessary to place Cohen in the proper perspective of Kant's philosophy, of which, with modifications, he was one of the chief exponents. Nineteenth-century German philosophy is often char- acterized as having been in a state of confusion. Perhaps it would be more correct to say, it was in a state of fermentation. The field of science was teeming with new discoveries through research and practical application. That field was domi- nated by natural laws formulated in the seventeenth century by Newton, who reigned supreme in the scientific domain till well into the twentieth century. Even Einstein's theories of relativity, though deviating from some of Newton's princi- ples, still remain under his dominance. Equally strong was Kant's impact on the century. In his Critique of Pure Reason Kant laid down the philosophical foun- dations as well as the limitations for Newton's laws of nature. Newton had based his laws on three main principles: the existence of absolute space, the concept of mechanical causation, and the method of scientific hypothesis. Kant investi- gated these principles, expanded them into a system of percepts and concepts which, he claimed, could be found a priori in pure sensibility and pure under- standing, respectively. He thus set the boundaries of scientific knowledge within the limits of human understanding (Kant's emphasis). But the burst of scientific speculation in the century following Kant's death, in 1804, kept pushing out against his boundaries. The German scientific and philosophical world, stimulated further by Hegel and Fichte, was split asunder in fragmentary cells. Into this fragmentation stepped Hermann Cohen trying to help bring the fermentation to its fruition and to promote the cause of science. It may be recalled here that Cohen earned his full professorship at Marburg University shortly after he had published a major work on Kant. The problem he then faced was that of certainty in the natural sciences. Even Newton had noted the uncertainty of hypotheses and cautioned against their multiplicity and abuse. On the other hand, Kant's transcendental deduction of the categories of understanding aimed at giving scientific knowledge universality and necessity, that is, certainty. But the scientists could not be restrained either by Newton's admo- nition or by Kant's refusal to allow more than his table, of twelve categories. Cohen's interpretation of Kant (which is known as one kind of Neo-Kantianism) followed the master's path of "Critical Idealism" (Kant's own phrase) to its log- ical conclusion. In his Logik der reinen Erkenntnis he introduced a number of new categories, such as, origin, motion, continuity and function. He also tried to remove the veil from Kant's "thing-in-itself" by reducing it to a mathematical calculus, on the concept of the infinitesimal, and thus to enable the scientist to</page><page sequence="4">158 JEWISH SOCIAL STUDIES come to grips with the thing-itself as well. In this manner, many scientific hypo- theses were given the status of categories, that is, certainty. On the other hand, the Kantian categories a priori as well as Cohen's new categories assumed an hypo- thetical character, that is, uncertainty. In Germany, philosophy has always been taken more seriously, that is, more personally, than in any other Western country. Not only were there fierce intel- lectual battles among the different post-Kantian and Hegelian schools, but sundry philosophers staked their careers on the right or the wrong side of the battle- field. Dr. Kaplan therefore correctly points out the stake Hermann Cohen had in expressing his philosophical and religious Weltanschauung when he appeared before Professor Lange for his appointment on the faculty at Marburg. We shall appreciate more fully the problem of certainty in nineteenth-century German phi- losophy if we realize that it is the same problem we face today, except that in our "age of psychology" we call it the problem of security. It became even more apparent as a life problem when Nietzsche raised the issue, why seek truth? "Why not prefer untruth? And uncertainty, even not-knowledge (Unwissenheit)?" One step further and he came to the thesis, "To acknowledge untruth as a condition of life: . . . And a philosophy that dares this, places itself thereby alone beyond good and evil."23 Nietzsche's classic interpreter, Hans Vaihinger, the philosopher of "As-If," took the next step and declared all categories as "fictions," falsifications of reality, including the self. These trends spread confusion and hopelessness among the ranks of philosophers. The search for truth became overwhelming even for many a stout heart. In this fluid state between certainty and uncertainty (which again in our day has become the battleground of quantum mechanics) Cohen evolved his theories of ethics and religion, based at first on a scientific philosophy of mathematical rationalism. The best he could offer was a science of ethics in which he posited a God-idea that was actually little more than an hypothesis of a guarantor for the ultimate attainment of man's ethical striving. In this, he anticipated very much Dr. Kaplan's hypothesis of a God-guarantor, although Cohen's concept was logically the more tenable one. That is perhaps why Kaplan feels that Cohen trespassed on his territory (and apparently got away with it). Cohen's Break with His Past Toward the end of his Marburg period (he left the University in 1912), when he was moved by the spirit of faith, as has often been said of his old age, Cohen realized that by means of mathematical rationalism he had not reached the living God. For Cohen was not so much in search of a rationale for Jewish existence as he was in search of God. How deeply he was moved by his problem and how he suffered sometimes from his particular mathematical bent of mind is re- vealed in a letter he wrote to a friend in 1909, where he said: Mine is a peculiar kind of fate. If there are people who sacrifice reason, I sacri- fice feeling. You know how much I am attached to the Jewish religion, with the 3 Cf. Nietzsche, Jenseits von Gut und B6se (Leipzig 1924), Nos. 1, 4, "Von den Vorur- teilen der Philosophen," pp. 7, 10.</page><page sequence="5">Hermann Cohen and Mordecai M. Kaplan 159 most deep-lying fibres of my heart and with the innermost feelings of my soul. But there, too, my fate is-abstraction. And only men of truth are capable of understanding my spirit and will bear with me patiently.4 And thus Cohen set out on his quest for God in the Sources of Judaism. In this quest, again, he leaned on one of Kant's fundamental principles. For besides sci- entific knowledge, Kant also left a second legacy in his Critique of Pure Reason in the realm of ideas or speculative reason. God as Being In his "Transcendental Dialectic," in the Second Division of the Kritik, Kant bears down his full weight against the rationalist arguments for the proof of the immortality of the soul and the existence of God. But, continues Kant, even though we cannot prove the existence of God, as the rationalists claim, we need not despair of finding in Reason such concepts that would enable us to speak of God in relation to the totality of human experience. He termed such concepts ideas or principles of speculative reason. Such an idea is God as Being, which cannot be further identified or defined as to its content, substance or purpose.5 And this is Cohen's starting point. Since he is looking for an idea to express God, he must be able to find it first and foremost in the place where all ideas come from, namely, Reason. He then goes to the historical sources of the Jewish reli- gion (which he regarded as the primary source of all religion) to find whether that idea is manifested in those sources. To be surce, the idea or concept (the words are here interchangeable) is taken from speculative reason but that does not make it less valid, even though it does not possess the categorical status of a concept of the understanding, namely, the certainty of scientific knowledge. For if we are to grasp religion in thought at all, we can only do so by means of reason.6 This background of concepts is overlooked in Dr. Kaplan's summary of the passages under consideration. "Reason in Religion," we read in the Epitome, "stresses the unreliability of sensate experience and emotion and affirms the do- minion of Law. Reason is the foundation of Law." And he further notes in his commentary: "He [Cohen] refers to ideationist rationalism, insofar as it leads to the good life .... Whether ideationist or functional, reason demands of religion that it be spelled out in laws of human behavior and the regulation of human relations. Hence Cohen's affirmation: Reason is the foundation of law" (64-65). This summary statement does not convey Cohen's meaning, and the commen- tary is thus out of context. In his original text (RV, 11-12) Cohen goes to some length in trying to show that the idea he has found in speculative reason is not 4 Cf. Bergmann, Hugo, Hoge ha-Dor (Tel-Aviv 1935), p. 225. 5 Cf. Kritik, pp. 503, 529, 540 ff. 6 Cf. Kritik: "Kritik aller spekulativen Theologie," p. 529: "Die Ideen der reinen Vernunft verstatten zwar keine Deduktion von der Art, als die Kategorien; sollen sie aber im min- desten einige, wenn auch nur unbestimmte, objektive Gultigkeit haben und nicht bloss leere Gedankendinge vorstellen..." (Although the ideas of pure reason do not permit a deduc- tion of the same kind as the categories, if they are to have at least some objective though indeterminate validity, and not present just empty notions... [then there must be some other kind of deduction for them]...)</page><page sequence="6">160 JEWISH SOCIAL STUDIES just a figment of the imagination, which would have no binding validity for the world of experience. For Cohen does not altogether accept the role that Kant assigns to the God-idea, namely, of a unifying principle of the totality of human experience. Kant emphasizes that in this respect the Idea has no binding scien- tific necessity and hence no certainty, as it cannot be deduced from the "syn- thetic unity of apperception" of the understanding (which is the only source of necessity). In this limited role, the Idea for Kant may refer only to a Deity but not to a living God of history. "Thus," he says, "... the concept which merely speculative reason gives us of God is, most strictly understood, deistic."7 But Cohen wants to extend the Idea to the God of Israel and he cannot rest satisfied with Kant's limitation on it. What Cohen says, then, in the passage referred to, has nothing to do with "spelling out . . . laws of human behavior." Rather, it has to do with finding certainty in the idea of God offered by reason, which is Cohen's main concern as it is also the burden of our own age. Reason in religion, he therefore goes on to say, expresses rules (Gesetze) of religious thought with as much binding force as do other aspects of reason, scientific or philosophical. For reason, in general, stands for orderliness according to rule (Gesetzlichkeit); it is the organ, the in- strument, of rules. "Where orderliness has its sway, reason's domain is assured" (RV, 12). And this orderliness according to rule, this certainty of reason, is the foundation of the prime source (Urspriinglichkeit), which we have only validated in history, but which "has its ground beyond the boundaries of all history."8 Specific Mode of Though in Jewish Sources The Jewish sources that Cohen is now going to examine are, therefore, not just a conglomeration of historical "contingence, caprice or illusion," as some may claim; for in them runs through an "origin" that is grounded in Gesetzlich- keit of reason. But how can one reconcile the Jewish historical sources, which seemingly "have no part in philosophy," with reason which is basically a philo- sophical problem? That depends on the meaning of philosophy. "Reason does not exhaust itself in science and philosophy," says Cohen.9 It also has other modes of thought. And here Cohen directs our attention to a most illuminating distinc- tion that touches the essence of discursive thought and that has manifested itself in two divergent trends in the history of Judaism. The one is rooted in the con- sciousness of the Jewish people, generally identified as traditional, while the other has been grafted on Jewish awareness as a recurrent modernism but has never really taken root in it. The section in his book where Cohen deals with this matter is summarized by Dr. Kaplan as follows: "Rational reason is as much a creation of the human mind as are science and philosophy. . . . The Greeks were as original in science 7 Cf. Kritik, p. 533: "So ist der . . .Begriff, den uns die bloss spekulative Vernunft von Gott gibt, im genauesten Verstande deistisch..." 8Cohen, RV, 12: "wo Gesetzlichkeit waltet, da ist das Gebiet der Vernunft gesichert." "Die Urspriinglichkeit, die wir bisher nur als eine geschichtliche geltend machen, erscheint nunmehr iiber die Grenzen aller Geschichte hinaus begriindet...." 9 RV, p. 8: "... die Vernunft erschopft sich nicht in Wissenschaft und Philosophie."</page><page sequence="7">Hermann Cohen and Mordecai M. Kaplan 161 and philosophy as were the Jews in religion. The Jews accepted certain concepts of Greek philosophy, but not the Greek science, because Judaism is inherently philosophic." And he comments: "Both philosophy and rational religion-which, for Cohen, had to be based on a rational conception of God-had a bearing on ethics, on what we ought to do, whereas science had a bearing only on knowl- edge as such, on what we ought to know. That is why Jews, in Bible times, were not interested in Greek science" (64). In the first place, it is not correct to say that Jews in Bible times were not interested in Greek science because they did not stress what we "ought to know." On the contrary, they were very much in- terested in the problem of knowledge but not in its Greek formulation. Their quest for knowledge and their admonition to right deed were so interwoven that in the biblical Hebrew idiom both functions were placed in the heart. Similarly, they were interested in the sciences of their time, as such, but not in the Greek mode of scientific methodology. And this is the meaning of Cohen's basic differ- entiation. He does not say that "the Jews accepted certain concepts of Greek philosophy." Quite the contrary, he stresses the fact that they neither borrowed nor imitated it. The Greeks, he says, have given to their philosophy a specific character and to their science, which they borrowed from the Orient, a particu- lar philosophic bent. They created a "scientific philosophy" and a "philosophical science," whereas the Jews, having "created the religion of reason," cultivated a "speculative philosophy."' And he concludes: "The religion of reason preserves in the sources of Judaism their original, natural, human association with philo- sophical speculation which can, therefore, be as little an imitation of the Greeks as it is borrowed from them. The philosophical in the biblical sources must there- fore have a specific character of its own....". This represents most clearly Cohen's break with mathematical rationalism and his return to the traditional mode of thinking when he set out on his quest for the living God. A Special Characteristic of the Hebrew Language To make the distinction between the Greek and Hebrew modes of thought, as drawn by Hermann Cohen, more relevant to our discussion, I shall point briefly to a special characteristic of the Hebrew language in contrast with Greek and other European languages. Ernst Cassirer, in his comprehensive study of speech, indicates that the sentence, not the word, is the basic formation (Grund- gebilde) of language.ll This, however, may be said of the modes of expression in Western culture which have been inherited from the Greek legacy of "scien- tific philosophy," but it may not be said of the Hebrew mode of thought. In the Greek mode, a judgment is expressed in the form of a triad, such as we find in the logical laws of identity and contradiction, "A is A" and "A is not not-A." That is, two related entities always have a third one that mediates between them. 10 RV, p. 11: "Die Religion der Vernunft wahrt den Quellen des Judentums ihren ur- spriinglichen, natiirlichen, menschlichen Zusammenhang mit der philosophischen Spekulation, die ebenso wenig griechische Nachahmung daher sein kann, als sie griechische Entlehnung ist. Das Philosophische in den biblischen Quellen muss ebenso Eigenart haben..." 11 Cf. Cassirer, Ernst, Philosophie der symbolischen Formen. Dritter Teil (Darmstadt 1958), p. 526.</page><page sequence="8">162 JEWISH SOCIAL STUDIES Translated into metaphysical concepts, the copula "is" as a mediator became the Logos for Philo or The Holy Ghost in Christianity. By contrast, the most remarkable characteristic of the Hebrew language is that it does not possess a term for the copula "is." Its mode of thought is the dyad or that of immediate relation. The primary element of Hebrew expression is therefore not the sentence but the word, which is pregnant with content. The relational connection between words is direct, without a mediator. The sentence ha-yeled gadol (the boy is big) is often innocently translated by the Hebrew be- ginner as "the boy big," because he cannot find the word "is" in it. It would never have occurred to the ancient Hebrews to make a statement "A is A," and they refused to borrow this mode from the Greeks, because it implies definition of Being and thus its limitation. This contrast between the two modes of thought is fundamental to an un- derstanding of Cohen's meaning of "origin," "correlation," and other concepts he has drawn from the sources of Judaism. Correlation, for him, represents the mode of the dyad, that is, immediate relation. (Buber later developed his own mode of the dyad in the I-Thou relation.) It is therefore incorrect, as pointed out above, to use this term; in the form of a logical judgment, "God is the correla- tion of man," as Dr. Kaplan rephrases it (58). In this latter mode, God is con- ceived as a function of man, which may be in keeping with Kaplan's functional rationalism, but not with Cohen's speculative reason. In the more than fifty pas- sages in the original text that deal with the primary word, there is nowhere a direct statement or indirect implication that God is the correlate of man. Cohen always uses the form "correlation of God and man," "the correlation of man and God," or "correlation between God and man," and the like.12 Negative Attributes and Creation The specific mode of Jewish thought is also reflected in Cohen's insight of "divine negative attributes," which he develops along the lines taught by Mai- monides. Dr. Kaplan leaves this section entirely out of his Epitome. But without this insight, Cohen's idea of creation as causality in reference to oneness of Be- ing is, philosophically speaking, unintelligible. That is why Dr. Kaplan can come to the conclusion that "the traditional conception of creation out of nothing, as an event in time, is meaningless (99). Parenthetically, tradition does not teach creation "as an event in time." Maimonides, as an Aristotelian, certainly could not have taught it, for Aristotle does not take time as an absolute. In the Guide, Part II, Chapter XIII, Maimonides specifically warns against the doctrine of creation in time. Neither did Cohen, as a Kantian, teach this doctrine.l3 Briefly stated, Cohen maintains that negative attributes do not negate positive attributes (which, he says, would be senseless) but they deny the privative ones. For instance, 12 Cf. RV, pp. 133, 151, 251, etc. 13 Cf. Kant, Kritik der praktischen Vernunft, Erster Teil, I, 3, Kritische Beleuchtung der Analytik: ". . . weil die Schopfung ihre intelligibele, aber nicht sensibele Existenz betrifft." (. . .creation pertains to its intelligible, but not sensible, existence [that is, not to space and time]).</page><page sequence="9">Hermann Cohen and Mordecai M. Kaplan 163 the statement, "God is not inert," means the negation of the privative idea of inertness, even though or especially because the word "inert" is not stated in the negative form of "not-active." This denial of the privative, furthermore, "affirms a new positivity, so that the negation has been completely rooted out," and the positive idea of action, creation, has been conveyed (RV, 73). What is important for the understanding of Cohen is that this whole conception of creation is not a logical one, even though it has a logical counterpart in the category of "origin." Dr. Kaplan, notwithstanding Cohen's direct argument to the contrary, sum- marizes the section under discussion as follows: "The doctrine of God as crea- tor means that God is the logical ground of existence. . . . Nature and becoming derive logically from being. Thus the creation of the world is to be inferred log- ically from the Being of God" (98-99). But in the Religion der Vernunft Cohen emphatically denies that creation is a logical inference from Being. "Insofar as creation is regarded from the point of view of causality," he writes, "it demands a parting of the way with logic. In the light of this [logic] it appears as a miracle. But reason maintains it can resolve the anomaly of the miracle into normalcy of thought."1l3 And at this normalcy of thought Cohen arrives through his lucid presentation of the doctrine of negative attributes. This doctrine, again, is borne out by the specific character of the Hebrew language which, as indicated above, does not have the mediating copula "is." The Hebraic mode of thought does not use the mediating logical form for positive attribues because it does not think of them in logical terms. The verses in Exodus 34:6-7, which are known as the thir- teen Divine Atttributes, do not contain a single word that might suggest the co- pula "is." "The Lord, the Lord, God merciful and gracious...." It does not say, "God is merciful," etc., which is a logical form of definition. The only pos- sible attributive use of an implied copula is contained in the negatives en, lo (not), as for example, in 2 Samuel 15:29, Ki lo adam hu le-hinnahem "For He is not man that He should repent." But even there the word hu (He is) does not take the place of the copula but rather of the personification of Being as con- trasted with anthropomorphism. How far Dr. Kaplan deviates from the Hebrew mode of thinking and what it leads him to, is illustrated by the issue he takes with Cohen on the meaning of the word hayetah in the biblical account of creation. Cohen says that the mytho- logical view of creation assumes a pre-existing chaos, whereas in the Hebrew ac- count chaos was the state of the earth after creation (RV, 74). "And the earth was unformed and void." On this Dr. Kaplan notes: "Here Cohen misunderstands the meaning of the Hebrew hayetah in Genesis 1:2. It is used there in the plu- perfect sense, implying that the earth had been null and void before creation set in" (98). This interpretation is very well in accord with Kaplan's own concept of creativity (rather than creation) which can mean only composition out of pre- existing elements. In the cosmic act he thus presupposes an eternal chaos before the world came into being. But the traditional view and the very character of the 3a RV, p. 81: ".. . die Schopfung, sofern sie unter dem Gesichtspunkte der Kausalitit steht, nur die Auseinandersetzung mit der Logik fordert. Dieser gegeniiber erscheint sie als ein Wunder, und die Vernunft erhebt den Anspruch, die Anomalie des Wunders aufzuheben in die Normalitat des Denkens."</page><page sequence="10">164 JEWISH SOCIAL STUDIES Hebrew biblical text are on Cohen's side. The past tense in Hebrew does not dif- ferentiate between imperfect, perfect and pluperfect. It has no separate words or word-forms for these. For that matter, the Hebrew temporal sense is expressed only two-fold, in terms of past (hayah or hayetah) and continuity (howeh and yi- heyeh-historic present and future). With the absence of "is" for the present, the Hebrew substantive cannot be predicated, because it already expresses being. The predicate in the Hebrew sentence appears as the object of action. That is why the verbum is the dominant form of biblical style, and Cohen's treatment of action (Handlung) in relation to Being (Sein) in the spirit of Hebraic thought.14 Kaplan's Functional Rationalism Besides his commentaries on Cohen's Religion der Vernunft, Dr. Kaplan sup- plies at the end of his book a brief chapter on his own approach to Judaism en- titled, "A Modem Functional Rationale." It is an excellent "epitome" in its own right of his views developed in his previous voluminous writings, and since it is a statement of his own position, it must be accepted as authentic. As indicated above, Dr. Kaplan follows a line of reasoning which is patterned after the Greek mode of thinking rather than the traditional Jewish mode. This becomes more directly evident on reading the Introduction and the last chapter of the book. Dr. Kaplan finds justification for his "reconstructionist" approach to Judaism in the fact that in former generations there were similar attempts to reinterpret Jewish re- ligion and to find new meaning in it, in order to meet the challenges of time. That will, no doubt, be acceptable to every Jew who is at all concerned (or "worried," according to Dr. Kaplan's favorite expression) about Judaism as a living reality. One may thus agree with Dr. Kaplan about the need for reinterpretation but hold serious reservations as to what it is in Judaism that he reinterprets. This depends largely on one's conception of change, which is a constituent factor of reinter- pretation. Dr. Kaplan follows Heraclitus' dictum, "Everything flows, nothing abides." But while the Greek philosopher has the Logos put some order and reason into the flux, Kaplan tries to derive reason from the flux itself, that is, reason, for him, flows along with the changing stream. Therefore, in the ancient philosopher's metaphor, when he "steps into the river" to take a look at the stream, he never finds the river to be the same. If one were to ask, as Cohen did, what it is that changes, Dr. Kaplan would answer, the "what" has no meaning outside the con- cept of "change." His reconstruction is thus a rational as well as a practical at- tempt to rebuild Jewish life in accordance with the constant changes that are taking place in our day. Reconstruction, as such, may mean the rebuilding of something out of its old materials into a new design; or rebuilding it in the old design out of new materials. Dr. Kaplan tries to do both, with emphasis on the new design. First he selects "from the mass of traditional lore and custom the psychological aspect 14 Cf. RV, Ch. VI, p. 109 ff.</page><page sequence="11">Hermann Cohen and Mordecai M. Kaplan 165 which testifies to the presence of ethical and spiritual strivings."l5 But then he also reinterprets that "psychological aspect" to make it "relevant for our day." Such of the old materials as do not fit into his new design he either reinterprets to make them fit or else declares them out of existence because, according to him, they have ceased to "function" for "modern man." This is basically what he means by "functional interpretation," "functional reinterpretation," or "functional ra- tionalism."16 Functional Existence of the Jew Many difficulties arise out of Kaplan's use of the concept of function. In the first place he identifies it universally with existence. "Whatever performs a function of any kind exists" (3). And since he also puts it in the logical converse -"for anything to exist, it has to function"-the two, function and existence, are synonymous or identical. By function in this sense he apparently understands "operation," performance, in and for itself and not necessarily in relation of de- pendence on another existent. His other uses of the concept are important in his arrival at the particular function, and thus existence, of the Jewish people. In the next step he speaks of function of a given kind which identifies existence: "For anything to exist, it has to function in some specific manner" (3). That is, an existent is identified by the nature or essence of its function. "'Jewish existence,' accordingly, means 'functioning as a Jew.'" The third step is to ascertain what it is that enables a Jew to function as a Jew. This leads him to the concept of function as relational dependence, where "A is a function of B," or A depends on an independent variable B (a mathematical function). This independent vari- able is the Jewish people whose existence can be identified only by its function in the first sense, that is, by its manner of operation, since, "For the Jewish peo- ple to exist, it has to function as a people." In sum: the Jew functions as a Jew, that is, exists as a dependent of the Jewish people, which in turn functions or exists in its operation as a people. This poses a dual question: What are the gen- eral earmarks of a people and what are the specifics of a Jewish people? One might answer this question by simply observing how a people, in general, and our people, in particular, operate (function) and thus ascertain their manner of existence. But Dr. Kaplan avers that the Jews of today do not function as a peo- ple, hence they do not exist as a people. At best, he sees their existence as that of a veteran people, on the analogy of soldiers who ceased to be soldiers because they left the army and became veterans. There being no real people in existence to show us its manner of function (operation), Dr. Kaplan resorts to a definition: An existent Jewish people is one that functions as "a civilizational people." But what will prompt a veteran people to reconstruct itself into a "civilizational peo- ple?" This is the real burden of Dr. Kaplan's "rationale" for Jewish existence. If the "veteran" people has no abiding elements of a real people left in it, its efforts toward reconstruction are hopeless. Kaplan, like Hermann Cohen be- fore him, therefore delves into the Jewish past to find such elements that might 15 Cf. Kaplan, Judaism as a Civilization (New York 1935), p. 390. 16 Ibid., p. 389.</page><page sequence="12">166 JEWISH SOCIAL STUDIES spell "Jewish function as a people" and hence "Jewish existence as a people." But unlike Cohen, Kaplan not just reinterprets the elements of the past, but com- pletely transforms them by his "functional rationalism." For, "nowadays," he says, "the Jewish situation is such that reinterpretation is far from enough" (10). First the Jews "have to find a way of functioning as a civilizational people," that will "assure the existence of the Jewish people" and then "proceed to reinterpret the traditional values which spell out the purpose and meaning of that exist- ence" (10). Reconstruction thus precedes the finding of a rationale and yet it rests on such a rationale. For if the "veteran" Jewish people can "find a way of functioning as a civilizational people" without a rationale, why does it need one after it has assured its own existence? A living being does not need a rationale for its existence. A "rationale," on the other hand, is inevitable if it is to be rationally reconstructed. One must then give a good and valid reason for want- ing to reconstruct it in the first place. Actually Dr. Kaplan does not see the pos- sibility of establishing the Jewish "civilizational people" without his rationale, for that is what he intends his "Judaism as a Civilization" to be-a rationale. This explains also the title of his latest book, The Purpose and Meaning of Jewish Existence. For him, the Jews at present do not exist as a people and hence the Jew does not exist as a Jew. This is the pivotal problem of his entire conceptual approach to Judaism. He does not start with the existence of the Jewish people as a people. That status, he says, they lost in 1807, with the acceptance of the Napoleonic Sanhedrin and have not recovered it since, at least not as a world people. A Bridge between Existentialism and Rationalism It is of more than passing interest to note that Dr. Kaplan separates him- self from all exponents of Jewish life who betray even a semblance of existen- tialism. For the latter starts with existence, whereas he starts with concepts. He finds Cohen's Religion der Vernunft "extremely illuminating" for his own thesis because he considers Cohen a rationalist like himself, except that Cohen's ration- alism is of the wrong brand. But a careful study of Cohen's magnum opus of his old age will reveal that his work has built a bridge between existentialism and rationalism, as Hugo Bergmann. for example, has pointed out.17 Some of those who have followed him have continued building various approaches to the bridge which may now be in the planning or developing stage. Dr. Kaplan, on the other hand, has remained in the rational sphere of thought. He has made a concerted effort at a different method of concept-forming, namely, functional rationalism. By this method (and that is what he calls his "Reconstructionism") he has under- taken a gigantic task of shaping new concepts of God, Torah and peoplehood, out of which, he hopes, a new Jewish "civilizational people" will emerge. Whether or not such a new structure can be found and whether, if erected, it can be firmly 17 Bergmann, op. cit., p. 219. Cf. Martin Buber, Pointing the Way (New York 1963), p. 91, where he speaks of "Hermann Cohen's masterly legacy . . .The Religion of Reason. . . where he advanced from the idealism of his system to the existentialism of 'corre- lation,' ..."</page><page sequence="13">Hermann Cohen and Mordecai M. Kaplan 167 established, depends on its cornerstone, namely, Dr. Kaplan's concept of God, which will receive our attention in the following paragraphs. Kaplan's God-Idea Dr. Kaplan defines God as "that aspect of nature as a whole which makes for the maximum fulfillment of man's highest ethical and creative potentialities. That is the God of whom we have immediate experience whenever we deliberate- ly act out of a sense of responsibility, honesty, loyalty or love, and creativity. Such ethical conduct reflects cosmic traits which are manifest throughout the universe" (295). This, he maintains, is a "naturalist's" concept of God and, as such, is best suited "for the modern intellectual Jew." One must bear in mind that Dr. Kaplan derives his naturalistic view from concepts of ethical value and not from a scientific account of nature which, he claims, does not yield values. From his "functional-rationalist" point of view, then, in order for God to exist he "must function in some specific manner." What man- ner of function does this God-idea perform? As an "aspect" it cannot have any operational function, though this is the basic category of functional rationalism. All the God-idea can stand for is a relational function of dependence-on man's "sense of responsibility, honesty, loyalty or love, and creativity." And if that sense of responsibility were to diminish or reduce to zero, the God-idea as a dependent function would diminish accordingly or become non-existent. Even if nature re- vealed the ethical cosmic traits Dr. Kaplan ascribes to it and all of it were per- meated by the sense of responsibility, that sense would still be only a "natural" responsibility and the God-idea would be only one of the variable functions of nature (for nature has other manifestations besides the ethical).18 In and for it- self it does not, nay cannot, do anything, for Dr. Kaplan does not ascribe to it any being, only existence in the functional sense. But in that sense, its existence is in jeopardy because it is conceived as a numerical function (besides being a dependent function), a "summation" of all that is or might be regarded as ethi- cal values. In and for itself Kaplan's God-idea has no empirical evidence, no sci- entific necessity, and no metaphysical validity. Dr. Kaplan seems to have felt this implicit difficulty in his definition of the God-idea, for in another passage in his book he tries to find an active, opera- tional function for it. And since "creativity" is one of the manifestations of his God-idea, he assigns to this creativity a special power: "It is that in the cosmos which prevents its entropy from having the last word" (99). Here his "natural- ism" comes into direct collision with "natural science." Entropy is a physical prin- ciple of "The Second Law of Thermodynamics." According to this principle, the irreversible process of the loss of heat may eventually lead to the extinction of the world. Unless Dr. Kaplan has a scientific refutation of this natural law, how will his God-idea, as the aspect of "creativity," prevent entropy? His God-idea 18 Cf. Kaplan, Ha-Emunah weha-Musar (Jerusalem 1954). The author develops there his ideas of the relation of ethics to religion from a naturalistic viewpoint. See especially ch. 5, p. 121 ff., where the concept of "responsibility" is derived from principles of natural evolution.</page><page sequence="14">168 JEWISH SOCIAL STUDIES thus remains a mystery of nature. Throughout the ages some mystics have sought to experience God in nature through sense perception. He remained a mystery to them because they could not perceive Him there. So does Dr. Kaplan posit a God- idea in nature which he expects to reach through "immediate experience" of hu- man ethical conduct. But his God-idea cannot be found in nature through such experience except as a "meaning" attached to man's behavior. Dr. Kaplan has constructed a logical triad: "Ethical conduct means the God-idea" and he is try- ing to elevate the mediating copula "means" to an active, cosmic function. The Problem of Man Man in Dr. Kaplan's naturalism and, in particular, the individual Jew in the Jewish "civilizational people" also undergo some hardships within the confines of his "functional rationalism." Kaplan starts with a functional concept of the Jew as he started with a concept of God. As analyzed above, according to him, Jews exist as Jews if they function as Jews; and they "can function as Jews only by virtue of their belonging to the Jewish people," which means a "civilizational peo- ple." Since that people has not yet been constituted, the individual Jew is bound to lead a life of quasi-existence. Into this anatomy Dr. Kaplan hopes to infuse a new spirit that will bring salvation to the modem, emancipated Jew. It would take us too far afield to dwell here at length on the impact that emancipation and enlightenment have had on the modern Jew and on modern man in general. Those two forces, like meteors, tore man not only out of the bos- om of church and synagogue but also from family, community and state author- ity. It meant the individualization of man. Suddenly man found himself burdened with superhuman tasks which he was now called upon to face as an individual and he began to wonder with the Psalmist: "What is this human . . . whom thou hast made a little less than the mighty ones," and hast transferred unto him all their responsibilities? This is where the winds blow from so fiercely in our day and forcibly remind us of "forlornness," "anxiety," "despair." To reconstruct in- dividual man back into a societal or communal entity, as Dr. Kaplan proposes, without resolving his status as an emancipated individual, intellectually and mor- ally, is well-nigh impossible. August Comte, a century earlier, tried by means of his "Western Committee" to found a new society with a positivist "Religion of Humanity" in which the evils of emancipation, as he saw them, would be over- come. But the forces of emancipation could not be arrested or set back. Dr. Kaplan, in our day, acknowledges that emancipation is a factor to reckon with. As a matter of fact, it is the background for his portrait of the modern Jew. But he does not see the Jew as a Jewish individual existent in and for himself. He has not met with him in real confrontation, for he has not resolved his problems as an emancipated, individual Jew. Hermann Cohen, in contrast, went out to seek individual man and the individual Jew, as he went forth to search for the living God, through the sources of the Jew's tradition. He sought the individual as an "I" not only in relation to organized society or to mankind as a whole, but also in and for himself. It is paradoxical that in this age of individualism, individual man has be-</page><page sequence="15">Hermann Cohen and Mordecai M. Kaplan 169 come the most neglected of entities. True, individualism has fostered the ideas of individual enterprise, equal rights and opportunity before the law, and similar freedoms that benefit man as an individual. But individual man as a moral being has been very much left out of account. In this age of freedoms, the individual has found many things in his favor; but has he found himself as man? Ethics and Religion Hermann Cohen presents in his book an extensive analysis of this very in- tricate problem of man in his categories of a socio-ethical being and of an indi- vidual "I." Cohen draws a clear distinction between the ethical and religious as- pects of morality, the first being related more directly to the social problem, while the second aims to resolve the problem of the individual. How far apart Kaplan and Cohen are on this issue can be illustrated by the former's interpretation of the chapter dealing with the "discovery of man" in the Religion der Vernunft. Dr. Kaplan writes: "It is difficult to grasp the thought of this chapter if we read it in the light of ideational rationalism [i.e., by Cohen's method]. What Cohen tries to say is more understandable in the light of functional rationalism [i.e., by Kaplan's method]. According to the latter, moral responsibility is a function of reason. Moral responsibility is an ethical principle, because it dictates what man must do to fulfill his role as man. It is also a religious principle, because it de- rives from cosmic polarity which, when it operates in man, enables him to achieve his role as man. That polarity is the synthesis of individuation and interaction with the environment. Cohen discusses in this chapter how a human being dis- cerns in another human being a person like himself" (122). Here Dr. Kaplan visualizes the moral human being as an abstraction of an interaction between the ethical principle, which is a function of reason, and the religious principle, which is a function of cosmic polarity. Hermann Cohen leads in the opposite direction, away from abstract man to the real individual. He wants to see man as an "I" who is not abstracted from humanity, society, polarity, or a derivative of any kind. How then, according to Cohen, does man discover him- self as an individual "I"? Not as Kaplan interprets, that the "human being dis- cerns in another human being a person like himself." Quite the contrary, when a man becomes aware of fellow-man, says Cohen, he does not see himself at all. (That, he says, is Schopenhauer's view, which he rejects.) In fellow-man or in the "Thou" one discovers the ethical principle of pure will, the ought, but not yet himself as a moral "I." "Even fellow-man is not yet an individual which might be designated as an 'I.' "1 Thus far, he continues, through the correlation of he states: "The question is whether this absolute individual is a justified concept. God and man as a rational being, even as an ethical being, man still remains an abstraction and the task is now "to resolve this abstraction and to transform it into an individual, living human being."20 And to emphasize the religious aspect, 19 RV, p. 193: "Auch der Mitmensch ist noch kein Individuum, welches als Ich zur Bestimmung kime." 20 Ibid., "... die Abstraktion wieder aufzuheben und diese in ein lebendiges menschliches Einzelwesen umzuwandeln."</page><page sequence="16">170 JEWISH SOCIAL STUDIES However, one must not believe that this question has already been disposed of through the [idea of] fellow-man. Yet, in the solution of this question the specific character of religion is brought out more definitely and more clearly than in the [idea of] fellow-man." The problem now before Cohen is to show how "the cor- relation of God and man assumes for man the more restricted meaning of an individual and of an 'I.' "21 This he develops through man's feeling of guilt and awareness of sin which, he says, was first brought to light by the Prophet Ezekiel. In brief, Cohen states that ethics of pure will can enjoin man what he ought to do or ought not to do, and, insofar as it is carried into practice by organized society, he can be held to account for his unethical actions, declared guilty and punished. But ethics of pure will, either as teaching or in practice, cannot make man accept his guilt and sinfulness of his own accord. Society can even hold him responsible as a moral being, but it cannot make him into a moral being by mere enforcement of ethical action. And unless and until man discovers in himself the awareness of guilt and sinfulness, he is not really a moral being. This is the par- ticular, concrete status of individual man in correlation with God. And this, says Cohen, is the specific character (Eigenart) of monotheism which he found in the sources of Jewish tradition. The Jew who sees this tradition as his own, finds him- self as a Jew. What is most important in this path that Cohen took on his way to finding God, man, and the Jew in himself, is not whether he reached his ultimate desti- nation, but the distance he traveled, the light in which he posed the question, and the deep insights of his proposed solution. If one were to pursue Dr. Kaplan's analogy of the soldier and the army, one would find that a soldier does not cease to be a soldier when he steps out of the army but when he stops fighting. Sergeant York fought a battle without an army. And Dr. Kaplan himself is the most il- lustrious example of a Jewish fighter (or "happy warrier," as he calls himself) without a body politic. The Jews have to find themselves through their tradition first and foremost, and the kind of people they will then constitute will be oper- ating as a Jewish body to the core. 21 RV, pp. 193-194: "Es ist die Frage ob dieses absolute Individuum ein berechtigter Begriff ist, aber man darf nicht glauben, dass durch den Mitmenschen diese Frage schon erledigt wire. In der Losung dieser Frage aber erst vollzieht sich die Eigenart der Religion bestimm- ter und deutlicher als beim Mitmenschen." And ". . . dass die Korrelation von Gott und Mensch die engere Bedeutung zum Menschen, als Individuum und als Ich annimmt."</page></plain_text>
