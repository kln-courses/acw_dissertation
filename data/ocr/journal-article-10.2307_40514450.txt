Anonymous Gift. 1985.61.1</page><page sequence="2">Two Portrait Stelae and the Romanization of North Africa ERIC R. VARNER During the third and second centuries B.c. (264-146), Rome challenged the city of Car- thage, located in modern Tunisia, for dom- inance of the western Mediterranean. Rome was eventually successful over her rival in the three Punic wars, and Carthage was sacked and razed by the Roman general Scipio Aemilianus in 146 b.c. Scipio s destruction of Carthage signalled the birth of the Roman province of Africa. Under Roman domina- tion, local cultural traditions and indigenous art forms were transformed by the gradual assimilation of Roman customs and religious beliefs, as well as by the attendant adoption of Roman sculptural and architectural styles. By the second and third centuries a.D., pros- perous upper- and middle-class inhabitants of such North African cities as Roman Car- thage (founded on the site of the original city in 44 B.c.), Utica, Bulla Regia, Mactar, and Lepcis Magna spoke Latin, wore togas, lived in Roman-style houses, and worshipped in typically Roman temples built on high podia. In 1984 and 1985, the Yale University Art Gallery acquired two rare Roman North Afri- can portrait stelae dating from the third cen- tury a.D. (Figs. 1, 2).1 Said to be from Tunisia, these previously unpublished limestone stelae offer vivid testimony to the romanization of North Africa. They are particularly notable for the impressive naturalism of their por- traits as well as for the unique representations of the goddess Caelestis-Nutrix preserved in their upper registers. Votive and funerary stelae constituted a significant part of the artistic production of both pre- Roman and Roman North Africa. Votive stelae were set up in and around relig- ious sanctuaries, usually to mark such sig- nificant events in an individuals life as the performance of an important sacrifice.2 Fun- erary stelae were erected, often as cenotaphs, to honor the deceased. Combining relief im- ages and occasional inscriptions, stelae pro- vided an artistic field on which the patron could proclaim his religious and civic achieve- ments. Thousands of North African stelae, set up in cemeteries and temple precincts, would have been constant visual reminders of the importance of individuals in the collec- tive life of the city. Characteristic of the style and subject of pre-Roman stelae were incised schematic depictions of the two principal Punic deities, Ba'al Hammon and Tanit (see the upper register of Fig. 7 for a later, Roman approximation of these Punic depictions of Tanit). During the Roman period, such abstract designs gradually gave way to more naturalistic representations in relief, which by the second century a.D. included portraits, anthropomorphic divinities, animals, and vegetation. Inscriptional evidence on some of the extant stelae suggests that they were dedi- cated by members of the middle class who 11</page><page sequence="3">bore the tria nomina (the three traditional names: nomeny praenomeny and cognomen) of the Roman citizen.3 As such, it is likely that the patrons who commissioned these stelae wished a measure of their own romanitas to be reflected in the reliefs. The rectangular face of the stela donated to the Art Gallery in 1984 (Fig. 1; hereafter referred to as the rotulus stela according to the attribute held in the portrait figure s left hand) is divided into three relief bands. This tripartite division follows a canonical pattern characteristic of Roman North African stelae: the upper zone is populated by divinities, the large middle zone is reserved for portraits, and the lower zone contains sacrificial victims and offerings.4 The deeply carved central zone of the Yale stela forms a semicircular niche within which stands a nearly three- dimensional figure of a boy clad in a tradi- tional Roman toga and boots. Wearing the bulla - *, protective amulet of ancient origins worn by Roman boys until they achieved official recognition as adults - around his neck, he holds a rotulus (scroll) in his left hand and grasps the sinus (long fold) of his toga in his right hand. The upper zone of the stela reveals a seated female deity and two standing female attendants, while the lower zone contains an ithyphallic bull and a haystack. The stela donated in 1985 (Fig. 2; hereafter referred to as the sacrificam stela according to the portrait figure s pose) is also articulated with a niche containing a nearly three- dimensional figure of a boy wearing a toga and bulla. The large, carefully carved shell filling the top of this niche serves as a decora- tive frame for the boy s face. Two rings adorn the middle finger of his left hand, in which he holds a sacrificial bowl; a second sacrificial bowl rests on an altar below his right hand. Broken off at the area of the boy's knees, the sacrificant stela preserves only two relief bands, but it is likely that it too was origi- nally tripartite. As in the rotulus stela, its upper zone contains a seated female divinity flanked by two standing female attendants. Clearly, the portraits of the boys are the foci of the Yale stelae. Carved almost in the round, they are significantly larger in scale than the subsidiary figures, which are more cursorily rendered in relatively low relief. Despite the schematized patterns of their hair and the similarity of their wide-open stares, such individual features as the plump cheeks of the boy in the rotulus stela and the asym- metrical mouth of the boy in the sacrificant stela underscore the attempt at portraiture. And the careful detailing of the costumes stresses the Roman character of the dedicants; both wear the Roman toga in its developed imperial form, and the bullay which sons of Roman citizens wore until they came of age.5 Esteemed, like the toga, as a particular mark of romanitasy the bulla further serves to accentuate the youth of the boys portrayed. The North African custom of honoring children with both votive and funerary por- trait-monuments derived from Roman prece- dents, particulary Italian funerary art. As attested in epigraphical evidence, this phe- nomenon was particularly widespread in areas around the Roman city of Carthage.6 Insofar as votive and funerary portraits honor an individual, both can be said to be com- memorative, which is clearly a primary func- tion of the Yale stelae. Without inscriptional evidence or an archaeological context, how- ever, it is impossible to determine whether the Yale stelae are specifically votive or funer- ary in character. Comparisons with other North African stelae and with Roman sources provide the most promising, if occasionally conflicting, clues as to their original function. Signifying education and erudition, the scroll in the rotulus stela is a popular attribute in full-length, three-dimensional representa- tions of Roman emperors and magistrates. It also appears on coin reverses showing Septi- mius Severus, the African-born emperor of 193-211 A.D., as Fundator Pacis (founder of peace).7 Among North African stelae, the rotulus pose, with its strong ties to such official Roman portraiture, is highly expres- sive of the dedicants romanitas. It would 12</page><page sequence="4">therefore seem most appropriate for a votive monument. Yet the pose and youth of the boy in the rotulus stela are particularly remi- niscent of similar portraits on Italian funer- ary reliefs of the first and second centuries a.D. There is, for example, an exact parallel on an altar from Rome containing portraits of two deceased boys.8 As Diana E. E. Kleiner has pointed out, the rotulus attribute on such funerary altars often poignantly illus- trates the unrealized potential of the deceased child.* A frontal figure sacrificing over an altar to his right is the most widely used pose on North African portrait reliefs dedicated to Saturn. Such stelae often portray young boys wearing bullae.10 The pose also appears on Roman funerary altars of the first and second centuries a.D.; and in the Severan period, members of the imperial family assume this pose in portraits on the Arch of the Argen- tara in Rome and on the Arch of Septimius Severus at Lepcis Magna.11 Generally expres- sive of the piety of the dedicant, the sacrifi- cant pose in Yale s stela may commemorate an important sacrifice in which the boy par- ticipated. Whether it was originally votive or funerary, however, cannot be definitively ascertained. Secondary to the portraits, but of utmost iconographical significance, is the seated female deity holding a child in the upper zones of both stelae (Figs. 3, 4). Privileged over her attendants in scale and position, she represents one of the many incarnations of Dea Caelestis, the principal goddess of Roman North Africa. Caelestis is a roman- ized version of the chief Punic goddess, Tanit, who formed an indissoluble diad with her male counterpart, Ba'al Hammon. Under the impetus of Carthaginian expansion, these two Punic deities penetrated as far as Spain and Sicily.12 During Romes domination of North Africa, Ba'al Hammon and Tanit were equated with Saturn and Caelestis and were often worshipped in the same temple as com- plementary deities.13 As Saturn's companion rather than consort, Caelestis functioned as his female alter-ego.14 Her presentation in the sacrificam stela underscores the close rela- tionship between the two and reveals, as well, the persistence of pre- Roman traditions in North African art; the throne- ornamented with rams horns - on which Caelestis sits is the throne of Ba'al Hammon. Like the pantheistic North African Saturn, Caelestis presided over the celestial and nether realms, and was responsible for the earth and its fecundity.15 In her role as fertil- ity goddess, she provided lifegiving water and was invoked on inscriptions as pollicatatrix pluviarum (the promiser of rain).16 This par- ticular aspect of her divinity would have assured her importance to the inhabitants of the arid regions of North Africa. Caelestis embodied the characteristics of all the principal female deities of the Graeco- Roman pantheon. Specific aspects of her all- encompassing nature were emphasized by giving her the attributes and titles of other goddesses. The most common North African representations of Dea Caelestis depict her as a seated Juno-figure holding a flower and a lunar crescent, or as Magna Mater flanked by two crouching lions; but she was also identified with Venus, Ceres, Luna, Fortuna, Urania, Ops, and Nutrix.17 It is the latter association that describes her role in the Yale stelae, clarifying iconographical meaning and allowing us to date the stelae with greater accuracy. An obscure Italic deity, Nutrix was Saturn's nurse in Roman mythology. Although the worship of Dea Nutrix in North Africa began during the Punic period, emphasis on her association with Caelestis seems to be a prod- uct of the Severan period (193-235 a.D.).18 Septimius Severus' Syrian-born wife, Julia Domna, had strong ties to the East and may have initiated a new interest in Nutrix, the Italic deity most similar to the nurturing mother goddesses popular in the Eastern Mediterranean. Hence, the Severan date for the association of Nutrix and Caelestis in North Africa provides a terminus ante quern of 193 a.D. for the carving of the Yale stelae, as 13</page><page sequence="5">Fig- 3 Detail, upper register, Fig. i. it is unlikely that the depiction of Caelestis- Nutrix would predate that period. The Caelestis-Nutrix figures in the Yale stelae resemble an early Roman North African terra-cotta figurine of the late 2nd or ist century b.c. that has been identified as Dea Nutrix.19 Found in a Roman cistern on Cape Bon in modern Tunisia, the statuette depicts Dea Nutrix sitting on a small bench and seeming about to nurse the child she holds on her lap. It has been likened to earlier Hellenistic representations of Demeter hold- ing Damophon, or Isis with the infant Horus, representations popular in North Africa.20 A first-century a.D. terra cotta of Nutrix nursing a child at her bared breast attests to the continued popularity of the goddess in Roman North Africa and estab- lishes a clear precedent for Caelestis-Nutrix s presentation in the sacrificam stela, her breast already bared for nursing (Fig. 5).21 Seated goddesses with children were also popular on coin reverses of the Antonine and Severan periods.22 Generally associated with the concepts of fecundity and childrearing, these coin reverses are nearly contemporary with the renewed North African interest in Caelestis-Nutrix. On the Yale stelae, the appearance of the goddess, attended by female figures bearing baskets and garlands, is likely an expression of hope for abundant harvests and general prosperity, as well as a further indication of Caelestis-Nutrix s nur- turing power, perhaps in regard to male children.23 The well-preserved upper registers of the Yale stelae provide important clues for recon- structing the fragmentary upper relief bands of two Roman North African stelae in Leiden and the Bardo. In the broken register of the Leiden stela, from the region of Beja le Kef in Tunisia, a seated figure whose drapery recalls that of Caelestis-Nutrix in the rotulus stela is flanked by draped female attendants holding a garland and a basket.24 The fragmentary top register of a stela at the Bardo in Tunis reveals similarly draped figures.25 Such reliefs suggest that the invocation of Caelestis- Nutrix on North African stelae was not an isolated phenomenon; with links to Punic, Italian, and North African representations, she was clearly a goddess whose cultural appeal in North Africa transcended political and stylistic change. In the sacrificam stela, Caelestis-Nutrix is attended by a nude female figure of the Venus Pudica type. Her inclusion underscores the multiform nature of the goddess. While Cae- lestis is explicitly shown as Nutrix, she is implicitly likened as well to Venus, another fertility goddess.26 The Venus Pudica on the Yale relief represents a well-known Hellenistic type derived from the Knidian Venus of Prax- iteles.27 Numerous copies attest to its popu- 14</page><page sequence="6">Fig. 4 Detail, upper register, Fig. 2. larity in the Roman period; and its appear- ance here proves incontrovertibly that the sculptor of the sacrificam stela must have been familiar with the naturalistic and classi- cizing art disseminated in North Africa under the Romans. Indeed, in their attention to individual detail as well as their interest in modelling and three-dimensional form, the Yale stelae attain a degree of naturalism uncommon among the corpus of North African stelae. The earliest of these, from the Punic period until the end of the first century a.D., are characterized by schematic, incised designs; and abstracted carving in low relief is a hallmark of the lingering Punic influence on many later Roman North African stelae as well (see, for example, Fig. 6). The sculptors responsible for the Yale stelae were less con- strained by this stylistic tradition, attempting instead to emulate the more naturalistic art that would have been displayed in or around Roman municipal buildings and in the homes of wealthier citizens. Accordingly, they focused most of their attention and skill on the portraits, whose naturalism is striking in comparison to the expressionistic portraits that typify Roman North African reliefs (see Figs. 6, 7). Eschewing the extreme degree of schematization that identifies the continuing Punic tradition in many of the Saturn stelae, in particular, the sculptors clearly sought to convey an impression of individual likeness.28 Fig- 5 North African, Roman, from Tunisia, Dea Nutrix, 2nd century A.D. Terra cotta. Musée du Bardo,Tunis. 15</page><page sequence="7">The deep curve of both niches allows the Yale portraits to be carved nearly in the round. The full, fleshy forms of the boys' faces are well articulated; and, in the rotulus stela, the surface of the face has been left rough, highlighting the portrait s naturalism by allowing for the variable play of light and shadow across the boy s features. The abstract pattern of both boys' plastically modelled and symmetrically arranged curls draws attention to the more specific physiognomi- cal details of their faces. In the sacrificam stela, for example, the broadly arching eye- brows are a naturalistic touch that is extremely rare among portraits on North African stelae. The attempt to create a specific, naturalis- tic likeness of an individual for commemora- tive purposes attests to the strong degree of romanitas evident in the Yale stelae. As detailed earlier, such commemorative portrai- ture securely links the works to non-imperial relief sculpture, usually funerary in nature, in Italy and throughout the rest of the Roman Empire. Despite their familiarity with the naturalistic and classicizing art of the Roman Empire, however, the artists of the Yale stelae have nevertheless imbued their reliefs with the pervasive frontality that characterizes all North African stelae, however they may vary in style or workmanship. This is evident in the disposition of the portrait figures and in the firmly frontal head of the Venus Pudica figure; in most copies of the statue, the head is depicted in three-quarter view. It was not until the second century a.D., as a direct result of Roman influence, that portraits appeared on North African reliefs.29 Yet the more detailed chronology of North African stelae can be problematic. Wide iconographie and stylistic variations occur even among reliefs carved in the same area of artistic production. Supported by the exter- nal and internal evidence of inscriptions, hair and toga styles, and datable archaeological contexts, G. Charles Picard has categorized the Saturn stelae according to three chrono- logical phases.30 Phase in encompasses the last 150 years of stelae production, from 150-300 A.D. The reliefs of this phase exhibit increased figurai naturalism: proportions are generally correct, the artists work in higher relief, and gods are often shown as full figures rather than busts. Incidental decoration and architectural elaboration are frequently included. As detailed above, the Yale stelae exhibit many of the characteristics of Picards third phase. Other details of costume and appearance more explicitly support a date in the third century A.D. for both stelae. The thin, folded strip of the toga in the rotulus stela, extending below the ankle, follows a stylistic fashion of the third century a.D.31 Furthermore, the closely cropped locks in both portraits have parallels in the hairstyles worn by the Severan princes and by later third-century princes such as the sons of Gal- lienus (253-268 a.D.), Valerian 11 and Saloni- nus.32 The artists' treatment of the eyes also suggests a date well into the third century a.D. Although the hieratic, frontal stare of the boy in the sacrificam stela, and the regular linear pattern of his drapery, may indicate a date closer to the later stylized Imperial por- traits of the Tetrarchie period (286-321 a.D.) than do the more naturalistic portrait and drapery styles of the rotulus stela, both works can be firmly dated to the third century a.D. The Yale stelae chronicle in stone the romanization of art and religion in North Africa. After the assimilation of Ba'al Hammon and Tanit to Saturn and Caelestis, the traditional schematic representations of these deities were gradually anthropomor- phized. As the process of romanization gath- ered momentum, naturalistic animal and human forms in relief replaced the incised abstract patterns of the Punic period. The primary focus of the Yale stelae is commemo- rative portraiture, perhaps the most Roman of all art forms. The Yale reliefs witness the profound impact of Roman art on the indigenous artistic traditions of North Africa, and the strong desire of the inhabitants of North Africa to have themselves portrayed for posterity as Romans. 16</page><page sequence="8">Fig. 6 North African, Roman, from Tunisia (Ghorfa), Votive Stela, 3rd quarter of 2nd century a. d.

When worn by a boy participating in a sacri- fice, it may be indicative of a special event in the life of a child before he reaches adulthood, or, if used in a funerary context, be poignantly expressive of the unre- alized actions of the deceased, much as the rotulus can function on Italian funerary altars. 11 See Inez S.

The North African Saturn, as the romanized version of Ba'al-Hammon, retained the omnipotence of the earlier Punic god; in his preeminence, he was perhaps more akin to the Graeco-Roman Jupiter, whom he resembled, than to the Italian Saturn. See Soren in Carthage, 66. 16 Halsberghe, 2207; and Leglay, 218. 17 Halsberghe, 2204, 2209. Writing in the second century A.D., the Roman author Apuleius, who was born in North Africa and educated at Carthage, mentions Caelestis' association with other goddesses (Metamorphoses, 11. 5). 18 M.

Some scholars have even seen in the Dea Nutrix figurine and others of similar type representa- tions of Demeter and Damophon. Demeter enjoyed a brief vogue in Hellenistic Carthage, but the widely varying dates and lack of specific attributes of Demeter point to another mother goddess for these statuettes. Dea Nutrix is the most likely candidate.

The figure of the woman holding a basket in her hand on the Leiden stela re- verses the pose of the similar figures on the Yale stelae. Leglay has identified the fragmentary central figure as Saturn, but the feet are not crossed as in the typical seated Saturn pose; and the drapery seems to consist of two garments, which would tend to indicate a female, rather than a male deity. 25 Tunis, Musée du Bardo, limestone, 2nd century a.D.

Yale's stelae are not, however, unique in their naturalism. The central zones of two limestone stelae from Kenchala, dating from the late 2nd/early 3rd century a.D., contain equally naturalistic portraits of a young girl holding a bird and a bunch of grapes, and an infant boy holding a scroll. A Latin inscription on the latter identifies the boy as Titus Flavius Valerianus, age 3 months, 4 days, brother of Titus Flavius Sosander [t(íío) FL(avio) t(ííí) fil(ío) QviR(ina tribu) T(iti) FL(avii) sosandri fratri VALERIANO / VIXIT ME(ii) SIB(us) III DIEB(us) IIIl].
