Pp. 304. isbn 0-674-0136i-i. This book is really an extension of the work begun by Annette Kolony's pioneering 1975 book The Fay of the Fand, although it goes back to 1956 for its key assumption that America has perceived itself to be "Nature's nation," in the phrase of Perry Miller's Errand into the Wilderness. Cecelia Tichi chooses six examples of how American culture has invested places with images of the body that contribute to "the embodiment of a nation." Under three sections headed "Crania America," "Frontier Incarnations" and "Bon Aqua," Tichi pairs chapters to deal with a historical and more recent example. Her chapter tides indicate her examples: "Mt. Rushmore: Heads of State and States of Heads," "Waiden Pond: Head Trips," "Pittsburgh at Yellowstone: Old Faithful and the Pulse of Industrial America," "America's Moon: 'A Dream of the Future's Face'," "Hot springs: American Hygeia" and "Love Canal: Hygeia's Crisis." Taking an environmental and cultural studies approach, Tichi argues that tropes of environment-as-body, persistent in American culture, have been neglected by scholars since Kolodny because of a distaste for anthropomorphism. But Tichi's historical contrasts of mediation by different eras beyond the sites themselves reveal insights into the changing states of the national myth itself. She asks, "What interests are served by this identity formation? How and why might certain sites, at specific moments in time, prompt the cultural work of geographic embodiment? What happens when bodily geo-identity is not stable but subject to reinterpretation and reinvention?" What combination of elements, for example, made Waiden Pond a focus for the psychedelic "head trips" of 1960s countercultural America? Why did Love Canal come to represent the cancerous body of post-industrial America rather than Woburn, Massachusetts whose town wells were similarly polluted by local industries ? Could Love Canal be reframed as a body open to healing and renewal ? How might ecofeminism frame this toxic discourse? Sometimes Tichi's connections between tropes can stretch the imagination ("The American West was already identified with the moon in the national monument called 'Craters of the Moon'," 133). Often the commentary if complex and subtle, as in the conclusion that Norman Mailer's reclamation of the female moon of dreams from the technological WASP NASA project was actually for his own misogynist</page><page sequence="2">Reviews 349 purpose to install her as "heroic mistress."
