Any over- laps, parallels , or violent disagreements are therefore purely serendipitous. GLENN the evil." public The GOULD twenty-first concert once a "force century called of the public concert a "force of evil." The twenty-first century hasn't done away with live music yet, but we are quickly falling in line with other Gouldian philosophies and pre- dictions. Gould wanted to preserve an edited ideal; now, every new recording or performance of canonical classical repertoire automatically competes with all previous greats easily accessible on iTunes. Gould thought of giving the audience the ability to edit recordings; these days, GarageBand, Peak, MP3 Trimmer, and Amazing Slow Downer are just a few keystrokes away. Many of his records are sensational. Some work too hard to prove a per- verse point. Almost all are heavily edit- ed. There's not enough Gould on tape or video that is actually "live." Indeed, at this point, Gould's live appearances are receding from collective memory. His last performance was in 1964, so the number of people who actually got to see him onstage, while never large, has dwindled to a few elderly music fans. Among them is my piano teacher, Sophia Rosoff, who heard Gould play several times in New York and reports that he was greater than his records suggest. Another famous pianist who was greater than his records suggest was Arthur Rubinstein. As with Gould, some of Rubinstein's discs are disap- pointing. I can accept his faults more readily than Gould's, though, because he was so much less pretentious. On off days between engagements and par- ties, the titan of the world tour cheer- fully rolled into the studio and did unedited takes from his voluminous repertoire. Even in his eighties, Rubinstein sel- dom played less than a hundred concerts a season. (Gould's record was fifty- seven, in 1959.) As a result, everyone saw Arthur Rubinstein play. Countless pianists tell of a transformative Rubinstein recital from their youth. My own stepfather loved to talk of how nice Rubinstein was to the solo cellist with the Minnesota Orchestra in the Brahms second concerto. (With hindsight, I suspect that Rubinstein was nice to every cellist he partnered with in Brahms 2.) Recently, I learned from eminent jazz composer Henry Threadgill that at one of the earliest classical music concerts Threadgill ever saw in the Fifties, Rubinstein helped the lost teenager find his way to a seat in the front row before moving to the piano. For over half a century Rubinstein was a gatherer of minds and bodies in the public space. How many people met, exchanged gossip, or even fell in love at a Rubinstein concert? How many intrigues and spectacles and embarrassments were there? How many times did a sold-out room of thousands hold their breath while he encored with a Chopin nocturne? My favorite Rubinstein concert anec- dote takes place at intermission at Carnegie Hall, reported by Harold Schonberg in his biography of Rubinstein's arch-rival Vladimir Horowitz. Martin Feinstein of the Hurok organi- zation, which represented Rubinstein, escorted Horowitz to greet his old acquain- tance... To the astonishment of Horowitz and Feinstein, Rubinstein impulsively said, "You know, I'm not really feeling very well, and going on with the second half of the concert will be a big effort. I know the audience will be thrilled if you go out and play the second half for me." Horowitz was speechless and looked at Rubinstein unbelievingly. "He was really startled," said Feinstein. "His eyes shot up to the ceiling before he shook his head no." Rubinstein was in a win/win position on this one... The chances overwhelmingly were that Horowitz would say no, but Rubinstein had made his typical grand seigneur gesture and knew that word would get around. If Horowitz had said yes, it would have been on Page One of every paper in the world and would have created a billion dollars' worth of publicity for Rubinstein, r Rubinstein's best records are great enough that he will continue to live on. My current favorite is the 1959 travers- al of the Chopin Ballades. He was already almost seventy and had per- formed these works thousands of times. The narratives are clear, the phrasing direct, the pace unhurried. While I've always liked their occasion- al wrong notes, at first I didn't appreci- ate their simplicity, accustomed as I was to pianists emphasizing speed and power. Now I hear how luminous and timeless these interpretations are, full of deep wisdom acquired through a lifetime of live performance. Gould would disagree. He felt that a live audience was a bad influence on interpretation, explaining to Elyse Mach that his 1957 recording of Bach's Fifth Partita was "contaminated" by touring: "I was making an unnecessar- ily rhetorical statement about the music, simply as a consequence of hav- ing attempted to project it in very spa- cious acoustic environments... A very glib, facile effort, because a series of lit- tle party tricks which just don't need to be there had been added to the piece." Gould was on the wrong track, for the quality of his recordings varied ever more widely as he got further away from recitals. With some magical exceptions (like the stunning disc of Orlando Gibbons and William Byrd), the earlier the Gould, the better. The same cannot be said of Rubinstein, who kept learning in the heat of the moment. His last storming Beethoven concerto cycle with Barenboim makes most contemporary Beethoven playing seem tame. It was undoubtedly music's loss that Glenn Gould retired from live perfor- mance, and perhaps that choice had graver implications for him personally as well. After 1964, Gould wasn't able to draw from the vital, life-giving force of a live audience, which kept Arthur Rubinstein going as a performer even after he became completely blind. Was the denial of applause part of the reason Gould's life was abruptly cut short by a stroke at age fifty in October of 1982? Rubinstein was forty-five years older than Gould, but that didn't stop him from outliving Gould by three months, passing peacefully in December. - Ethan Iverson * Live "music"? Music! Or Isn't is it that it just tired called old "music"? Or is it that tired old "acoustic guitar" trope? Of course we know that something vibrates: does it matter if that something is a gut string or a taut membrane of animal hide or air in a metal tube or super-high-fideli- ty, state-of-the-art loudspeakers? It's impossible to listen, for example, to recorded organ music: what is there to resonate if you aren't in the room with the instrument? That's what cathedrals are for. One's own body receives the blow of the thirty-two-foot pipe. The Big Bass Drums in the marching band in the parade (you're six years old) make you ache from their impact on your eardrums and your chest. How can you recreate that in a recording? Well, I'm here to say that you can't. There's no shortage of music composed on a computer and brought to market in electronic form. We like it and need it. The sophistication of the sound stu- dio and its ability to apply layer upon layer of sound/music is exciting and important. Musical perfection is with- in reach! ("Earth to Glenn Gould!") Musical perfection is also a living Hell. In the movie version, Computer Gener- ated Images that rival reality have become so perfectly symmetrical that they give people the creeps. Toy Story scared the shit out of me and I found Avatar dead and cold. Synthetic music and musical reproduction affect me the same way. "Autotune" is terrifying. I want to hear the bow and the rosin and the breathing and the constant, infinitesimal adjustments in tuning that are required in "live" perfor- mance: living musicians performing for living listeners. Is that music I feel? - Mark Morris * April playing 2, 2011 its last : LCD show Soundsystem ever in an is playing its last show ever in an instantly sold-out Madison Square Garden, which is packed with lucky hipsters mostly adhering to the suggest- ed black and white dress code. Cruel world that this is, I can't, without major disruption and cost, be there. However, sitting at my desktop computer 2569 miles away in San Francisco, waiting for a friend to arrive, I am reminded on Twitter that the show is being live- streamed by Pitchfork, the indie music website. I don't usually have the patience to watch a music video online, much less a concert, but I bring up pitchfork.com and am hooked instant- ly. When my friend arrives, I make him watch too. Enjoying all the comforts of home (including ergonomic chairs, California munchies, and a hoppy ale that's far better than anything sold at the Garden), we watch James Murphy and his band, skillfully shot in alternat- ing close-up and long shots, playing music I love. Over the last six years I have consumed these songs from digital files dozens of times and in most of the environments I passed through - right here at my desk, in my kitchen and my car, on airplanes, on various elliptical climbers, while having sex, hiking on a cliff at the edge of the ocean, on a road trip to Death Valley, even literally on a mountaintop (cue "The Great Release," not on the set-list tonight). But I've also heard most of the songs live (at Bowery Ballroom and/or the Fillmore) one or both of the two times I was lucky enough to experience the band in con- cert. I can't imagine the songs, wonder- ful as they are, would mean as much to me if I had not had the experience of jumping up and down while screaming the lyrics (e.g., "We are North American scum," and "Where are your friends tonight?") along with the band and the rest of the crowd. But tonight I'm con- tent to be at home, tears coming to my eyes as Murphy counts down the last numbers. I can't quite imagine watch- ing this concert on my computer moni- tor any time but now, when This Is Happening , to quote the title of their last album. Half-live is fine tonight, though not half as good as being there. April 30: I'm sitting in Carnegie Hall's Stern Auditorium and thinking back to April of 2008, when I sat downstairs in Zankel Hall and heard the New York premiere of Steve Reich's Double Sextet (for two sextets, each comprising flute, clarinet, violin, cello, vibraphone, and piano). It was half live: the six-person new music group eighth blackbird, which had commis- sioned it, performed the piece live on stage, while a recording of the group performing the other sextet's parts played simultaneously. (Reich intended it to be performed either half-live or double-live.) Time passed. Double Sextet won Reich a Pulitzer Prize. I heard the piece performed double-live twice, in San Francisco and Ojai (both times by eighth blackbird joined by six other musicians), and after the record- ing (by eighth blackbird, doubling themselves) was released, I heard it many more times, double-recorded, as it were. And now, in 2011, I'm watch- ing as eighth blackbird is joined on stage by six other (live) musicians to close out Reich's seventy-fifth birthday concert. I'm always grateful to be able to watch the blackbirds exchanging glances and personifying focus as they navigate contemporary music's joyous intricacies. They seem fully alive, even when the piece is only half-live. Tonight, though, everything is live, and I am too. - David Hollander * Undergraduate cally endure a series music of majors listening typi- cally endure a series of listening identification quizzes and tests intended 16 The Threepenny Review</page><page sequence="2">to assess aural and factual command of shopworn masterworks in the Western musical tradition: Machaut motets, Monteverdi madrigals, Bach and Vivaldi concerti, Mozart symphonies, everything by Beethoven, a twelve-tone row or two by Schoenberg, nothing past 1945. I was an undergraduate in the 1980s, when the administration of such exams shifted from a reliance on LPs to cassettes, rendering the phrase "drop the needle" obsolete. At the University of Toronto, my alma mater, the cassettes were made in a soulless cinderblock edifice known as the Faculty of Music. The tapes preserved the scratchiness of their source vinyl, which meant that some of the listening examples on our tests could be identi- fied as easily (perhaps even more easily) by pops and crackles as by the music itself. It was a strange introduction to the metaphysical divide between live and recorded sound. I remembered this experience when I began to teach at Princeton Uni- versity. The syllabus I inherited for the twentieth-century music survey course included a 1958 work by Edgard Varese called Poeme electronique. Conceived for electronic tape and intended for the Le Corbusier pavilion at the Brussels World Fair, it relies on graveyard sounds (the scraping of spades in the earth), muffled moaning, and strangled coloratura climaxes to comment on the chills and thrills of recording technology. Varese created a work that would always sound the same, long after his death, and did not require living people to perform it. Yet the divide between live and recorded music began to be problema- tized long before. The philosopher Theodor Adorno, who turns out to have had something of a tin ear, heaped scorn on the gramophone in a 1927 complaint titled "Curves of the Needle." Students love to hate this essay, whose basic point about the loss of aura when live music is recorded devolves into a vulgar Marxist polemic about the terrors of commodified entertainment. The terrors could, however, trip over into laughter. In 1921, the French mul- timedia artist Jean Cocteau conceived the theatrical work Les maries de la tour Eiffel (The Newlyweds on the Eiffel Tower). The innovative Ballets suedois troupe premiered it to middling reviews, but kept it in its repertoire. In 1923 the work came to New York, where critics noted that Cocteau and his collaborators seemed much less interested in staging dance and panto- mime than performing ideas, most of which concerned the darker aspects of modernity. Run-amok technologies were part of the mix. The characters in Les maries include two gramophones, into which unseen actors speak semi-coherent lines. Their words are thus live and recorded at the same time. This condition also per- tains to the background music, a col- lective creation by the composers George Auric, Darius Milhaud, Francis Poulenc, Germaine Tailleferre, and Arthur Honegger - five members of a group of Parisian iconoclasts nick- named Les Six. Though we hear a live orchestra, their music tries very hard to sound as if it were emanating from wax cylinders and piano rolls. It is Bastille Day, and a wedding party has assembled on the first plat- form of the Eiffel Tower for a photo- graph. Cocteau immediately reminds us of the technological features of the tower by having a pair of antennae perform a pas de deux; this is followed by a waltz involving anthropomorphic telegrams. The plot, such as it is, con- cerns the appearance of the Quasimodo-like photographer and the incredible malfunctioning of his equip- ment. Instead of taking pictures, his camera regurgitates them: an ostrich emerges from its lens, telling us that the photographer had previously been at the zoo, as does a lion, which lunges at the wedding guests, seeking to devour them. Evidently Cocteau heard (Adorno might say it does the listening for us). And like the words of the actors, the music of Les maries is quite literally mediated. One of the guests at the wedding, a general, delivers a pompous speech. His oration is not, however, heard from the stage. It comes from the orchestra, in the guise of a fastidi- ous acoustic rendering of the intona- tions of a bellicose, hectoring lecturer. The music becomes unmusical, an inscription of a verbal medium. This transference explains the surre- alism of Les maries . The work is amusing insofar as all of the recording devices - gramophone, antennae, cam- era, and orchestra - break down. Like Gus Solomons , 1960 believed that cameras swallow their subjects. The musical background to these antics is cheerfully banal. The score comprises an overture, wedding pro- cession, funeral march, and some sim- ple dance forms - eight numbers in all, the bulk of them sharing melodic, har- monic, and rhythmic material. Despite being the product of five composers, the music all sounds the same. It recalls the detached, estranged music of silent film, which was distributed to movie palaces in the form of cue sheets for player pianists and orchestra. Cocteau reconceives the sound of these sheets as aural wallpaper. In other words, the music is meant not to be other works of its time (by Erik Satie, for instance), it articulates what com- posers feared might happen to their craft in the age of the gramophone. The Ballets suedois contracted five composers to produce a score of cli- ched commercial jingles, and the result, paradoxically, turned live music into a recording of itself. - Simon Morrison * Do we Of really course, need audience applause? Of course, audience members think that by their applause, their audi- ble wooos and aaah s, their ritual standing ovations, they are showing the performers their appreciation. But isn't their show actually an empty, harmful display if it disturbs the impression the artist is trying so hard to convey? A more convincing and pointed show of appreciation might be silent reflection and contemplation. Some operatic, symphonic, and bal- letic works end with bombastic, circus- like finales which (if the productions are good enough) rightly elicit a rous- ing reaction. But other works seek to take the audience on a mesmerizing journey, with the audience member somehow becoming a different person at the end, as a result of having taken the trip. Those so transformed should be able to have a few moments, at the close of the piece, to reflect on and sense what has happened to them - who they have "become" - before they return to the present, bringing this new identity to life. Some artists have told me that the very best response, the one which shows that the audience "got it," is complete silence for a long moment - while people are still under the spell of the performance - and then thunder- ous applause. David Harrington, vio- linist of the Kronos Quartet, has worked out a fine solution: at the con- clusion of each performed work, David "conducts" the audience, letting its members all know just how long the reflective moment should be. No mat- ter if David's last bowing is an up-bow or a down-bow, he follows it by lifting his bow high in the air and holding it aloft there. I have never been in an audience where this wasn't recognized by all as a signal to sit tight in the moment, dwell in the spell created, and hold applause until this final finale fin- ishes. Even the ahhhs are stifled during this moment. Then he brings his bow down, and a collective exhale con- cludes it all. I won't belabor the subject of audi- ence noises. But I think that a certain amount of non-medical coughing and throat-clearing, noticeable sighing, interruptive clapping, even paper rat- tling, when done during the perfor- mance, is meant to be heard by others as a form of participation in the per- formance itself. Such noises, while not part of the score, are nonetheless com- pletely audible and are included in the audience's perception of the perfor- mance. These uninvited performers must know on some level that their actions interfere with the performance, but for some reason they insist on interrupting the show. Why? One could hazard a multitude of theories, most of them not flattering to the noisemakers. - Tim Savinar * In my January wife and and I February went to a of couple this year, of my wife and I went to a couple of concerts (or should that be recitals? at what point does a recital become a con- cert?) by the great Maurizio Pollini at the Royal Festival Hall, London. It's the biggest of the three venues in the South Bank Centre, with a stage large enough to accommodate a Mahler orchestra. On these occasions there was Fall 2011 17</page><page sequence="3">just a big piano and this little guy. The first performance was Bach - I can't remember what exactly, maybe the Well-Tempered Clavier or something. Actually, Pollini was not alone; there was also another fellow turning the pages of the music. London was in the midst of one of the flu and cold epidemics that regular- ly infect the city and it was like a zoo - a zoo hospital - in there. Endless coughing, sneezing, and nose-blowing. "If I get out of here without catching something," I whispered to my wife, "I'll consider the evening a major suc- cess." Honestly, there was so much coughing and sneezing Keith Jarrett would have stormed off within min- utes; but, to give him credit, old Pollini appeared completely unconcerned by anything except getting through the program and making it back to his hotel in time for the ten o'clock news. I am entirely unqualified to judge whether it was a good performance - my wife, who plays the piano and whose mum is a music teacher, knows about these things, and she felt that he smudged a couple of passages - but I am qualified to say that it was more than a bit boring. I could see no way in which the experience of hearing this music was enhanced by seeing some- one perform it live, even if that person was a legend like Glenn Gould. Listening to the same music at home, played by the same person on my impeccable sound-system, sitting on my state-of-the-art sofa and not sur- rounded by a bunch of coughing and sneezing savages, would have been superior in every way. Cheaper, too. For the next gig, a couple of weeks later, Pollini was playing the three last Beethoven piano sonatas, which I know pretty well. It was far more exciting than the Bach. He was not reading from a score, for one thing, and just seeing someone who knows these complicated pieces of music by heart always strikes me as pretty cool. It was moving and thrilling and - as was not the case with Bach - the music took you on a journey. Plus there was a hint of Lisztomania virtuosity - albeit in semi-geriatric mode - about the whole thing. Still, I wasn't able to dis- tinguish between the greatness of the music and the greatness or otherwise of this particular performance of it. Once again Pollini got through it at quite a clip and might even have been back in his room for the nine o'clock news. Fair enough. I'd rather have been at home, too. I ventured the opinion to my wife that hearing straight music (as I always refer to classical music) writ- ten for solo piano is never worth going to. My wife assured me that this is not the case, that there are occasions when you have a real sense of moment, of communality, of everyone sharing the same experience. She mentioned Brendel; she always mentions Brendel, and she does so in a tone that I always find slightly irritating; it's an I-grew- up-in-a-house-with-a-Steinway-in- the-music-room type tone, mixed with I- sat-next-to-him- at- dinner -once undertones. But yes, I've always liked that feeling, the communal feeling, particularly when a half-decent pill has been coursing through my head and some moronic house choon has been pumping out of a sound system, but I liked it before then, way back in the days when, as a teenager with only a bellyful of Whitbread Trophy for bal- last, I saw Family, Hawkwind, the Groundhogs, or Dr. Feelgood at Cheltenham Town Hall in the 1970s. I liked it when I saw Dylan at Black- bushe in 1978, the Clash in Lewisham in 1980, or Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan at the Hackney Empire in 1990, and I can identify wholeheartedly with those people for whom having seen Jimi Hendrix play at a club in London in 1967 constitutes not just a musical high point, but one of their all-round lifetime achievements. Now, coincidentally, there has just been a program about Keith Jarrett's 1975 Koln concert on the radio, in which various people who were either involved in putting on the gig or who happened to be in the audience talked about the experience in almost reli- gious terms. I totally buy into that too, because although it was just a young guy and a (slightly dodgy) piano, the guy was Keith Jarrett and the music wasn't derived from a score. It was happening, being brought into exis- tence, before the eyes and ears (if one can put it like that) of the audience, who knew they were experiencing something unique and wonderful - a feeling subsequently intensified and vali- dated, no doubt, by the fact that the record went on to become the biggest- selling solo piano album in history. So, yes, seeing Pollini race through Bach seemed a total waste of time and money and seeing him play Beethoven seemed a bit of a waste too, but it's always worth going to hear Jarrett, ^ even though the tickets cost a bomb, partly in the hope that he'll throw a fit because somebody's coughed or sneezed or blinked and thrown him off his stride, but mainly because Jarrett is obviously a way more important pia- nist than Brendel or Pollini or any of them. If Brendel had died at the age of six, it would have meant that we did not have any records of Brendel playing Beethoven or Bach or whoever. A loss, obviously, but we would still have had Kempff and Pollini playing the same music, and even if all three of them had died, we'd still have had loads of other performances by whoever else you can think of - and, of course, we'd still have the Beethoven and Bach scores. The loss would have been relative. But if Jarrett had died, we would not have the Koln and other concerts. The loss would have been absolute. - Geoff Dyer * Until the only well way into you the could last hear century, music the only way you could hear music was to either make it yourself or be in a room with someone making it. The sound of music was inseparable from the presence of a living being; without physical breath and beating pulse, music did not exist. The only music was live music. What I do today at the piano does not differ in its essentials from what was done by pianists one hundred years ago: the slow technical practice, the exploration of the score in an attempt to get "behind the notes," the acute listening and self-criticism. And yet, how different it must have been to 18 The Threepenny Review Longing to sound a new note in the world of the arts?

Imagine the silence in the concert hall before that first note is struck, the communal expectation, the exquisite sense of suspension out of which would come the first sound. In such a setting I would both disappear and become more necessary, my identity would merge blissfully with the music. The listener would have no more to take home with him than his memory - a musical score could be acquired, the amateur musician might study the work, but there would be no musical snapshot in the form of a recording to be mechanically replayed time and time again. Imagine the intensity of the listening. As a touring pianist, one is depen- dent in every performance upon the condition and quality of the concert hall's instrument. You hope to encoun- ter a simpatico piano, one that allows you to make the sounds that you hear in your head and have worked ardu- ously towards achieving; then the instrument itself becomes a true musi- cal partner. This is a kind of musical paradise. But sometimes it is clear from the start that perfection is impossible, and the concert becomes about some- thing other than coming closer to your artistic ideal. Several years ago I was invited to give a recital in a remote town in west Texas. But there was a hitch: there was no piano. The closest piano dealer was nearly two hundred miles away in El Paso and he refused to truck a Steinway grand over the bumpy roads that stretched out from the main high- way. I eventually agreed to play an old baby grand that was discovered in the town church. The train whistles three times and clangs its bell as it crosses Route 17 at the center of Marfa, Texas. Stars pop brilliantly out of a sky so black it really does look like the nothing it is. I walk down the quiet town street for a com- munity "meet and greet" the night before the recital. Sixteen people sit quietly in a freezing church. The keys are icy under my fingers as I play the Bach Prelude in E major - first one voice, then two, then three. Now on to the fugue: four voices. The theme forms an arcy says the big man in the front row with his arm around a skin- ny blond boy, who disappears into him and is neither awake nor asleep. The night of the concert the church is filled. Savvy urban sophisticates from the contemporary art colony nearby mingle with local men and women dressed in their Sunday best. The program is a tough one for this lit- tle piano that has been asked for no more than weekly church hymns. At times I have the impression that I am not only pressing the keys down but lifting them up as well. In the last movement of Beethoven's Sonata in E, Op. 109, when the extreme registers of the piano create a drama of rumbling bass tremolo and brilliant arpeggios in treble, the instrument shakes as it is pushed beyond its limits. ..just like Beethoven's did. With the final state- ment of the sublime theme at the end of the variations, I struggle with the piano's uneven action, trying to make the notes of the chords speak simulta- neously and also create a legato line, avoiding any disruption in the expres- sive melody. The thought comes to me that this is probably the first time the Sonata has been performed in this town. The recital closes with Chopin's Ballade No. 4 in F minor, and here the dense and difficult coda becomes virtu- ally unplayable. This famous passage requires a power and virtuosity that must well up from the deep emotional pathos that motivates the music; the psychological demands of the work make its technical challenges greater. But as I find myself in battle with an instrument that is clearly deficient, the radical daring of the piano writing seems to be thrust into relief. Here, now, against the silence that reaches out beyond the small church into the black night extending for hundreds of miles around us, bursts forth Chopin's tragic outcry. After the concert, in the church social room, platters of Nabisco cook- ies are set up next to a punch bowl. A tall man in his sixties, dressed in a suit, comes up to me with hand out- stretched. "I don't know how to thank you," he says humbly, with an unmis- takable Texan twang. "I have record- ings of all those Chopin pieces - all of them - but never in my life did I dream I would ever hear that Ballade live." - Sarah Rothenberg * Iplay but for the a while piano, I less was than quite I used diligent to, but for a while I was quite diligent about it, especially a few years ago when I was working on some of Chopin's Nocturnes . In truth, though, I've never loved the piano the way I did - still do, in some ways - the classi- cal guitar. I venerate great piano music, especially Chopin's and Beethoven's, beyond almost anything else in the world of art, and I find most guitar music much more limited, but al- though I haven't played the guitar for forty years or so, I still, when I even think of holding one in my arms, feel the same powerful intimacy I did those ten years when I played two or three or four hours a day, and carried my guitar with me wherever I could. I'd take it with me when I visited friends, and to parties, everywhere - not so much because I wanted to show off, but just to have the instrument with me, to hold it on my lap and feel that gentle, curv- ing heft, light as air but solid and cor- poreal as a woman's body. I'd started studying the guitar at a time when I'd been playing piano but for various reasons was moving a lot, and was tired of paying expensive piano movers. Andres Segovia, then at the height of his renown, had played several times in Philadelphia, where I lived; I went to hear him and was very taken by his music, especially the tran- scriptions of Bach. I also had a friend, a picture framer, who made guitars as a hobby, and played a little, and knew someone who taught the instrument. I didn't know when I began to take les- sons and became attached to the instrument that I was entering an odd, sometimes delightful, sometimes real- ly quite nutty community of semi- compulsives, who at every level of com- petence had a single-minded obsession with the guitar - classical, flamenco, jazz, it didn't matter, it was the instru- ment itself that seduced. I was very caught up myself for a while, worked hard at my playing, first classical, then a little flamenco, and progressed quickly enough to have fantasies of giv- ing up poetry for music, but fortunate- ly was realistic enough to recognize I could never become a competent pro- fessional: I'd started way too late, and didn't have all that much native talent. I gave up playing the guitar for sever- al reasons. First, most compelling, was that unless I practiced for at least a few hours a day, my skills would quickly diminish, and the responsibilities arriv- ing around then - children, work, teaching - demanded too much time for that. This isn't the case with the piano - I can leave it for days or months, and when I begin again I'm more or less where I was when I stopped. Also, though I was hardly a master - I could work my way through Bach's Chaconne , if not quite always up to tempo - and though there were dozens of pieces less difficult I could play, I had to confront the limits of the repertoire for guitar, or at least of the music I could handle. In the decades since then, there's been a terrific amount of exciting music composed for guitar, by compos- ers as various as Mikis Theodrakis and Carlo Domeniconi, among many oth- ers, and in much current guitar music there's often an incorporation of some of the virtues peculiar to the instru- ment: extended arpeggio passages, har- monics, the dramatic rasqueados brought over from flamenco, that can make me regret having given it up. Every time, in fact, I happen to be some place where there's a guitar, I feel a little abashedly how unfaithful I've been all these years. As soon as I pick the instrument up, though, and have to confront again that my fingers don't have in them any longer even those lit- tle pieces I once didn't have to think about playing - a John Dowland dance, for instance, the last to abandon me - I hand the sweet thing back. - C.
