(J.E.S.H.O., Vol. 13, Part I, Jan., 1970, pp. 62-87) Steven G. Darian's is an admirable attempt, perhaps the first of its kind, to treat the Gangetic basin as a separate socio-economic category. It, however, fails to utilise a good amount of archaeological data which are now available for this river valley prior to the sixth century B.C. His initial assumption that the Copper Hoards provide a sort of link between the Gangetic Valley and the Harappan Civilization is doubtful. Lal's typological analysis in 195 1) dissociated the Gangetic Valley specimens from any western association. Its further proof comes from the technological analysis of Agrawal 2) who shows that both in alloying and metal forging techniques the Copper Hoards differ from the Harappan metal tools, including the Lothal anthropomorph.

This leaves the problem of their cultural affiliation open but whatever we know about them typologically and technologically seems to militate against the idea of their Harappan or a general West Asiatic affinity. The Prehistoric archaeological sequence of the Gangetic Valley may best be appreciated by considering the Upper, Middle and Lower stretches of the valley separately. The earliest defined ceramic horizon in the Upper Gangetic Valley is provided by the Ochre Coloured Pottery, unfortunately devoid till now of any other cultural association. Its occasionally suggested Harappan affinity 1) remains a tantalising problem but as at most sites this pottery occurs in a rolled condition without even easily recognizable shapes the problem is still beyond a positive solution. It is even doubtful if the layers containing Ochre Coloured pottery are regular habitational layers. Lal points out that it uniformly "occurred in a deposit of earth, varying from yellowish brown to dark brown in colour, often mixed with Kankar and usually hard in texture which did not contain any flooring substance or ash or charcoal or for that matter any other object indicative of the layer having been a regular habitational area" 2). The preliminary report of the soil-analysis, wherever available, suggests that "the deposits may have been waterlaid" 3). Lal's hypothesis 4) is that the situation reflects a sort of 'deluge', perhaps to be explained by the drying up of the Ghaggar in about this period and the consequent diversion of some of its feeders to the Yamuna. A thermoluminiscent date has now placed the pottery in the first half of the second millennium B.C. 5). At most of the excavated sites of the Upper Gangetic Valley the Ochre Coloured Pottery is succeeded by the Painted Grey Ware but at two of them, Atranjikhera 6) and Noh 7), an ill-defined Black-and-Red Ware horizon is interposed between these two levels. Nothing is known about the cultural identity of this Black-and-Red Ware except that it was associated at Atranjikhera with "microlithic cores and copper." A clear appraisal must await fuller investigations. It is only with the Painted Grey Ware that one treads on a culturally secure ground in the Upper Gangetic Valley. Their primary distribution covers the Doab and the Indo-Gangetic Divide. None of the Painted Grey Ware levels has been horizontally excavated but the collective picture is that of a group of agriculturists cultivating rice and keeping domestic pig, buffalo, cattle and sheep, besides horse.

Iron was known and locally smelted. The pottery was considerably sophisticated and some of the ceramic shapes may still be observed in the rural bell-metal utensils of the region. Despite some confusion regarding C-14 dates, the initial date should border around 00ooo B.C. Its suggested Aryan affiliation 1) is not supported by its subsistence pattern based on an association of rice, pig and buffalo, on the whole more of an eastern trait than a western one 2). The basic importance of this level is that it provided the immediate background to the early historic period in the Upper Gangetic Valley. In the middle stretch of the Valley the Prehistoric cultural picture was different. The downward limit of the Upper Gangetic Valley has here been taken to be a "line running roughly from the Ganges-Yamuna confluence at Allahabad across the North-North-east-South-South-east section of the Ghaggra" 3). In terms of modern political division the Middle Gangetic Valley thus comprises the eastern part of U.P. and Bihar. The earliest evidence of settled agricultural life has been obtained at Chirand where the recently isolated pre-metal level should touch the end of the third millen- nium B.C. The reports 4) are still too brief and vague for a clear cultural assessment but there should be little doubt that its genesis is linked with the growth of first agriculture in East India as a whole where the evidence of an undated (but presumably early) pre-metallic stage of agricultural economy occurs at as widely separate sites as Kuchai-Baidipur 5) (Orissa), Rajar Dhipi 6) (West Bengal) and Daojali-Hading 7) (Assam). Considering that the beginning of agriculture is now considered quite early in South-east Asia 8) and that some parts of East India belong geographically and culturally to the South-East Asiatic Zone 9), an early beginning of agri- culture should no longer be considered an improbability. If Chirand's pre-metal level marks the Stage I of agricultural occupation in the Middle Gangetic Valley, its Stage II is chalcolithic, also typified at Chirandlo) besides at some other sites like Sonpur" ), Rajar Dhipi12), Mahisdall3) etc. While a wide i) B.

There was a wide assortment of plain and painted wheelmade wares among which a Black-and-Red Ware formed the dominant element. This Black-and-Red Ware has been discovered as far as Rajghat 1) and Sohgaura 2) in East U.P. The C-14 dates suggest a beginning around 15oo00 B.C. 3). The origin is obscure but there is little evidence for a migration of the chalcolithic elements from South-east Rajasthan, Central India or Deccan. This chalcolithic level gradually merged into an iron-using stage around 700 B.C. 4). This aspect of the gradual merger between the chalcolithic and iron-using stages is clear from the sequences of Chirand and Mahisdal where chalcolithic elements including pottery and microlithic tools continue significantly in the iron-using level. Early historic period began, as in the Upper Gangetic Valley, in the sixth century B.C. The Lower Gangetic Valley comprises the Bengal Delta where the background to the growth of early historical sites is still not clear but whatever evidence there is indicates that the chalcolithic Black-and-Red Ware people moved down to the Delta 5). The foregoing archaeological image of the Prehistoric Ganges basin, though brief and sketchy, should suggest an important cultural point: before its economic and cultural unification in the early historic period the valley was divided into two distinct cultural areas. As the date of the Ochre Coloured Pottery testifies, settlements (of whose nature we know almost nothing) came to grow up in the Upper section of the Valley sometimes in the first half of the second millennium B.C. Around iooo B.C., perhaps slightly later, this area as a whole witnessed the growth of a secure and well-defined village economy based on iron, typified in the elaborate cultural assemblage of the Painted Grey Ware. In the Middle Gangetic Valley there is evidence of a pre-metal village economy as early as 2000 B.C. By about 1500 B.C. a secure chalcolithic horizon came to be established. Around 700 B.C. iron came in use, but as has been noted, without radically disrupting the earlier chalcolithic tradition. In one sense the prehistoric cultural area of the Middle Gangetic Valley was more primitive than its Upper counterpart where it was only with the beginning of iron that the village horizon became secure and elaborate. Not merely does one notice in the Middle Gangetic Valley the existence of an earlier pre-metal horizon but also the continuation of a long chalcolithic tradition. At this point a valid problem is: to what extent is this image of a prehistoric cultural duality relevant to an understanding of the early historic civilization of the Gangetic Valley? The answer is not easy to come by, particularly because of the lack of suitable analytical work done on the archaeological data of both the prehistoric and early historic periods, but to emphasize some aspects of the total problem, one may first draw attention to the geography of early Buddhism. i) IAR, 1963-64, p. 59. 2) IAR, 1961-62, P. 56. 3) C-14 dates have been obtained for two chalcolithic levels in East India: Mahisdal and Chirand.

Though no satisfactory explanation can be offered at the present stage of knowledge, the overlap is striking. Sharma has emphasized that "the real key to the understanding of the rise of the new religious movements lies in certain significant developments in the material life of the people" 1). On the archaeological side such an understanding would require a careful analysis of the prehistoric cultural data from both the cultural areas and the establishment of a secure compara- tive stratigraphy. It is essential to know how the upper and middle sections of the valley culturally interacted before the advent of History. The growth of Buddhism was, it seems, in one sense, the Middle Gangetic Valley response to this interaction. So far as the economic pattern of the early historic Ganges basin is concerned, a knowledge of its prehistoric phase is likely to provide a corrective to some of the hitherto accepted conclusions. To take an instance, it is generally believed 2) that Champd (an unexcavated site somewhere near modern Bhagalpur, South Bihar) was acting as a maritime river port in the sixth century B.C. Archaeologically one doubts if the Ganges delta became commercially significant before the third century B.C. Modern Tamluk or the ancient port of Thmralipta has not been adequately excavated but so far as the present evidence 3) goes, the earliest historic material at Tamluk does not go beyond the third century B.C. In fact, early historic civilisation did not begin anywhere in the Bengal delta or the Lower Gangetic Valley before this chronological point. The early historic growth in this region was not a local growth but an importation from beyond the delta. There is obviously a lot of truth in the assumption that Bengal was a part of the Mauryan empire in the third century B.C. 4). In any case, the point is that if early historic civilisation did not begin in the Lower Gangetic Valley till the third century B.C. it is not reasonable to expect that the inland river-port of Champa was catering to a maritime traffic as early as the sixth century B.C. It is also likely that the prehistoric cultural duality of the valley persisted to some extent in the early historic period. The general impression, of course, is that of an overriding cultural uniformity. The same types of pottery, art-object, coins and other things characterise the early historical sites from the uppermost portion of the Valley to the delta. Yet, a careful analysis of the material (which has not yet been attempted) is likely to show differences following the broad geographical divisions of the Valley. One may note in passing that terracotta mother-goddess figurines are more abundant in the early historical levels of the Middle Gangetic Valley. To sum up, our purpose has been to emphasize the emerging prehistoric cultural duality of the Gangetic Valley and suggest how a knowledge of the prehistoric pattern is likely to highlight the understanding of many aspects of its early historic civilization - religious, economic and cultural.
