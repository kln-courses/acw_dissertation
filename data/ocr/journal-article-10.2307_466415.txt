<plain_text><page sequence="1">Towards a Libidinal Economy of Three Modern Painters I Questioned on her "attitude towards modem art," Gertrude Stein once remarked, "I like to look at it. That is, I like to look at the picture part of it; the other parts interest me much less." What I like to look at in De Kooning's paintings is the yellow. I like to look at the yellow parts of even those paintings I don't think much of. Next to the yellow, I like to look at the pink. Finally the grey. For me the name De Kooning means the chance to stare at these painted colors, not works of art or experiences of form, and certainly not the various figurative pretexts, although the remnants of the faces of women are certainly unavoidable. So I take an irresponsible view of these "paintings", taking only what I like and ignoring the rest. The canvasses give me proof of the fragmentation of the modem senses and of the modem body. In the thinking part of my mind, I know where this fragmentation comes from; Schiller, Marx, Lukacs, Weber, tell me how the development of capital enforces a kind of psychic "division of labor," the advanced form of which can be observed in just this reification and autonomization of the various senses from one another. In front of the paintings, however, all I know is that the eye finds a space of sheer colored paint before it, in which it can lead a life of its own, beyond hearing and taste, and beyond the clock time of everyday life. The paintings let me glimpse this space, while doing other things that seem more suspect to me. If you look at them from a distance, across the circular stair-well of the Guggenheim, you register a rather different message: each canvas projects a garish and self- indulgent riot of solid colors, a whole ideology of pastel and "joyous" sensualism as inadmissible as any Renoir. Up close, however, you can forget this overall organizational "message" of the form, and concentrate on its bits and pieces, on these accidents that have something different in store for you. How were they possible? Only a myth or genealogical fable can answer this question. In the beginning, you tell yourself, was Line. It was without color or density, as the charcoal sketches show us. But it was not the sculptural outline that the tradition associates with this term. Neither trace nor profile, draftsmanship or boundary, not the ideology of the straight line made loose and supple enough to circumscribe a silhouette; but rather compulsive involution, like tangled string. Left to itself, this linear impulse generates the disappoint- ment of De Kooning's bronzes, Rodin in squiggles, as though dissolved into a blur of fibres by a Giacometti force field. The impulse to Line, you have to understand, is not sufficient, only necessary. If you let it guide your reading of the paintings, you quickly find them reduced to expensive doodles: not action painting, or if Jackson Pollocks, then a Pollock whose brush is too heavy and dripping with color to move very fast. Let's say it openly: what is interesting here is never Line itself, but what is allowed to emerge between the lines, what you find yourself calling the "Flat". This is the secret tension in De Kooning's paintings, their story line: not the melodramatic rivalry between figure and background, or even Line and Color, but the 189</page><page sequence="2">190 Unequal Developments fascinating and inexplicable emergence of the flat, with stretches of painted color across which the eye skids without so much as raising a ripple. Where does it come from? You have to imagine, I think, a process of effraction that seizes on the line itself, tangling it, as in the charcoal sketches, making it shiver and vibrate, shattering it rhythmically into pencil shadings, like so many overtones. Here some inner compulsion of line, some originary nervousness, makes it want to burst its two-dimensional limits and produce, out of its own inner substance, smears that coopt and preempt its primal adversary, the brush-stroke itself. Digression on the brush-stroke, the very fingerprint of private style, of the unique and incomparable individuality of the modem "genius." No wonder a post-individualistic art like Warhol's paints it out, not merely for the purpose of mass reproduction (although this art marks the entrance of painting into the category of Walter Benjamin's "reproduceable work"), but above all as a sign that the individual subjectivity is irrelevant, that we are now beyond all that, somewhere else. So you could see De Kooning as the meta-brushstroke, the mega-brushstroke, the enlargement of the real-life microscopic fingerprint of the normal brush into that immensely magnified space you find on the photographic blow-ups that hang near museum offices during fund-raising campaigns: enlargements of tiny sections of the old masters, to illustrate the authentication process or to show the use of x-rays in detecting earlier sketches beneath the familiar final surface. So here too, if you want, you could see these canvasses as the last gasp of some individualizing romanticism, as the celebration of some ultimate genius- or personality-cult, of De Kooning's incomparable physical gesturality, in the form of just such gigantic, yet personal and unfalsifiable painted traces. Clearly, I would rather not see them that way: De Kooning's style is unmistakable all right, but I would rather see its enlargement as a process that drives the personal beyond itself, in much the same way that the x-ray process of psychoanalysis blows your private thoughts and fantasies up to the point at which they become impersonal again, the algebra or syntax of the unconscious. Let me justify this preference: the older identification of brush-stroke with stylistic individuality took place within the opposition of color to line, romanticism to classicism. Line was here objectivity, the resistance of matter, the visible trace of Cartesian extension; color marking the place of the "secondary qualities," of the subjective projection of individual sense perception. But now, in De Kooning, Line transforms itself into the brush-stroke itself, it splays out, fanning into distinct yet parallel ridges and streams of paint, refracting the original substance into strands that have different destinies, some mountainous and bristling, others trickling down the canvas in tears that no longer seem the marks and traces of maladresse. Line is now brush-stroke and color; its new structural opposite, the flat, is something that happens to the latter, rather than a place of freedom and ofprivate, personal expression in its own right. With these developments, we can construct the first great paintings of De Kooning's maturity, gigantic ideograms, Klines projected into a Utopia of a few solid colors. A standing tripod, great smears of brown and green, with an immense brush-stroke of bluish white, beside a deeper blue, with the hallucinatory De Kooning yellow already extended overhead: in Painting 1959 the flat has already emerged as the space on which these messy brushstrokes overlap, to the point at which we can grasp its new specificity. Imagine, alongside the movement of the brush, and the strands of paint it leaves to mark its path, a quite different operation, a lateral treatment of the wet oil to which, no longer</page><page sequence="3">Three Modem Painters 191 coaxed out by the bristles that transmit it, a new and unaccustomed violence is now done, forcing the paint across its own grain, smoothing and levelling it crosswise, flattening the natural ridges of the brushstrokes and contaminating the primary colors by smearing and compressing them together in an implacable sideswipe. We can dramatize this new way of laying paint, and its hostility to the linear multiplicity of the original brushstroke, by naming the two great tools or instruments which are the demiurges of these painted surfaces. Now the flat betrays the intervention, in the splayed and variegated ridges of the primal Brush, of a new and unexpected agency, the Palette- knife; and these non-figurative canvasses can be read as allegories of some primal dualism, like space and time, earth and sky, male and female, industry and agriculture, in which for all eternity Brush and Palette-knife pursue their eternal and irreducible combat. But does this local mythology of the eye, this archetypal cosmology of the newly reified space of the purely visual, have any more general intelligibility? Today (but maybe only today), I am tempted to read it as follows: the brush gave us the strands of mingled color in a kind of streaked suspension. The palette-knife now enacts the Utopian dream of an effortless collapsing or compression of all matter back into itself, a relentless squeezed assimilation of all textures into a single homogeneous substance, of all the colored surfaces into some primal putty you can rework with your own fingers. Yet into the flat you can stare, seeing layers upon layers, ghosts of older surfaces of paint hanging for a moment beneath the surface, older colors swimming beneath the overwash of yellow or grey that presses them ever further down. It is a cruel process, as we can judge by the women's faces, those parrotty beak-like grinning caricatures, which, like the tiny features of an octopus, imperiously distract you from the otherwise swirling, non-figurative movement of colored paint. This remorseless minaturization of the faces of organic women, of the vestiges of Eros, makes of such "portraits" a veritable figure of the flat itself, betraying the last remnants of some necessary heterogeneity, some last obligatory differentiation of feature and painted trait, before the palette-knife relentlessly smooths it into a marbled surface into which you gaze, stirring with memories of a faded multiplicity now forever immobilized within the triumphant new homogeneous substance of glazed paint. II Well, you don't do things like that to Cezanne, whose institutionalization effectively discredits such irresponsibility and, like the novels of HenryJames, say, demands a wellnigh compulsory respect for the unity of the individual work and the architectonic composition of the isolated canvas. For that very reason, on the other hand---because the value of Cezanne has become a functional component in the ideology of establishment modernism-I doubt whether anyone can have a direct or unmediated experience today of a Cezanne painting. It is a little like the role of print in present-day speech; we talk and listen, but subliminally we continue to see printed words. We explore a Cezanne landscape visually, but the underlying subliminal "text" remains the "idea" of Cezanne, and the feeling that we are engaging a full-blown cultural institution. How can we break out of this vicious circle? Brecht (but also the Russian Formalists) taught us that we have to estrange things that have come to seem "natural" in order to recover some sense of their original historical function. Let's estrange the Cezanne exhibit by supposing that all these very different paintings-which represent work in so many codified genres, from portraits, still lifes, and landscapes all the way to the occasional nudes, as in The Bathers--are "in reality" versions</page><page sequence="4">192 Unequal Developments or variants of a single narrative, ways of reembodying with distinct visual content a single story that Cezanne's paintings tell over and over again. The "reader" is obviously going to be actively involved in the reconstruction of this "story," which the canvasses-inert collections of visual data--can scarcely "tell" all by themselves. So it is a kind of decision, from the outset: we decide that we will "read" our own eye-movements back and forth across these painted surfaces as a proto-narrative text. But this is not an arbitrary decision: it corresponds to something objective in these paintings, and in particular to a peculiar stereoptic "double standard" familiar to anyone who has spent time looking at Cezannes. I'm talking about the distance from which you look at the painting, and in particular about the way it asks you to move in close and eyeball the segments of individual paint with which it is put together, only to lose all sense of the objects of representation-the houses and trees, rocks, tablecloths, and human faces-that you have to back away again to recognize. Unlike the classical constructions of Renaissance perspective-which determine a single ideal viewing position from which the whole composition comes into focus--Cezanne's paintings project two distinct "view-points"- nose-close and ten feet away-which are rigorously incommensurable and discontinuous, and which can never fold together in some single unified hierarchical visual experience. There is a verbal or a literary equivalent to this peculiar structural discontinuity in our reception of Cezanne: you can reproduce it in your reading of Flaubert by replacing distance with reading speed. Flaubert's novels are still stories; and if you run your inner movie projector at the proper speed, you can still watch recognizable characters forming comprehensible desires and engaging in familiar activities within situations that are readily re-imaginable for us, as in Balzac, as in Dreiser or Zola, as in Dickens. What you can also do with Flaubert-and it is not possible with the other "realistic" novelists just mentioned-is to slow down your reading tempo to the point at which a different kind of intelligibility becomes visible: the intelligibility of the individual sentences, as they are blocked together with unequal phrases, and themselves discontinuously placed in such a way as to result in that unexpected formal unity, the finished paragraph. This kind of attention, if you like, still articulates a narrative: only it is the narrative of the adventures of Syntax, and its characters are not anthropomorphic figures, but rather tenses of verbs, pronouns on the point of becoming proper names, catalogues of nouns whose plurals amplify them into some microscopic or purely verbal equivalent of mass psychology or the behavior of collective groups. This microscopic dynamism of words is intelligible as music is intelligible, or painting: its narrative coherence cannot, unlike the more representational storytelling level of the text, be conveyed in everyday language. We would have to build a complicated and technical meta-language to do justice to the patterns our reading experience feels in the relationships between the individual words. It is easier to show this in a negative way: there is always someone to come along and remind us that Balzac and Dickens, Zola and Dreiser, are also put together out ofwords; that we ought to be able to read their sentences as slowly as we can read Flaubert's, and with the same new "objects" (nouns, verbs, pronouns, phrases, syntax, paragraphs) slowly coming into view. All I can say is that on that enlarged micro-level the words of those writers do not project any distinct and autonomous intelligibility in their own right: they remain instrumental in the transmission of the larger narrative, and force us constantly to shift our gears back to the content level, in order to understand their relationship to each other. In Flaubert, however, you can remain on the micro-level, and live as fully in a single page as in the novel's "unity of action." Back to painting for a moment: the distinction between</page><page sequence="5">Three Modem Painters 193 Flaubert and the other realists in this respect is not unlike that between Cezanne and the other impressionists. With the latter, also, you can experimentally approach the canvas, and watch your perceptions systematically disintegrate into atomic sensations, as the initial Gestalt returns to the sense-data that presumably made it up. The point is that on this level, the painted spots and specks which are the raw material of impressionism have no intelligibility of their own: nothing is going on here that has an intrinsic interest in its own right; this is sheer flux, whose organizational dynamics you can grasp only by stepping back and recognizing the representations of which it proves to be the support. The moment of Flaubert, the moment of Cezanne, is a historically exemplary one in which "for the first time" the distinct dimensions of what Deleuze and Guattari (in their Anti-Oedipus) have usefully called the molecular and the molar (those larger empty formal unities in which the microscopic data of the molecular are "organized" and recontained) can be observed to move apart, to go their separate ways, and, as in some vast geological drift, to begin to lead distinct existences. It is the moment of the twin birth of modernism and mass culture, when as in some historically new "division of labor," the older molar storytelling or representational unities are now assigned to the "degraded" status of the best-seller or the film, while the molecular experience of language or sheer paint becomes the perceptual center of the new "high art" of the plotless novel or the modernistic lyric, or of abstract painting. In Cezanne, in Flaubert, for one long last unstable moment, both uneasily coexist in the double standard or discontinuous focus we have described above, before that definitive historical dissociation within which the aesthetic in our own time continues to dwell. So we do no violence to Cezanne by trying to read this painting on its molecular level, as a coherent, wellnigh narrative dynamic which is quite distinct from the landscapes or furniture or human bodies which on its other, molar level it purports to represent. To try to rewrite the molecular level as a narrative has the methodological advantage of giving us something explicit to look for, and of making us ask ourselves who the "characters" of this estranged and microscopic action are and what they do to one another, what kind of plot or intrigue they can possibly be said to be involved in. I will say that the "characters" of this story are colors, and that the principal protagonists, as you move about the museum and look at one painting after another, prove to be blue, green, and ochre. I will say that these characters are locked in combat with one another; and that, on this level, Cezanne's imagination is a melodramatic one, with "heroes" and "villains," with happy endings that can just as easily be reversed into the disasters which are perhaps the more characteristic outcome. Going all the way with this, I will finally assert that the principle of evil in this conflictual universe can be none other than ochre itself, that yellowish brown that so oppressively disengages itself as the ground tone of large collections of Cezanne's paintings; and that the triumph of ochre celebrated by these works is to be read as the triumph of instinctual repression. Why is it, indeed, that no one has been willing publicly to acknowledge the dreariness that emanates from Cezanne's most characteristic color scheme, when you are exposed to room upon room of these canvasses? I have already mentioned the ideological status of Cezanne, which goes a long way towards explaining why people might hesitate to voice such impressions even where the latter nag insistently at their aesthetic reception. But perhaps such impressions meet other kinds of interference as well, and know censorship by other agencies. It seems to me just possible, for example, that inhabitants of the northern tier of industrialized nations (Parisians, the New Yorkers wandering through this exhibit,</page><page sequence="6">194 Unequal Developments Londoners, Berliners) willingly read this peculiarly drab reach of the spectrum between yellowish orange and brown as a sign and a symbolic expression of the subtropics, of the Mediterranean and the C6te d'Azur, the landscape of Cezanne but also the sun and of the tourist's mirage of that Other of the everyday routine of the city of industrial capitalism. It seems to me just possible that such viewers do their best to suppress the gap between the depressing visual immediacy of C6zanne's ochre and the conceptual or ideological coding of its sub-tropical content as the "promesse de bonheur" of its invitation to the Utopian voyage. Nor are they wrong exactly, for ochre really is the ground tone of the sub-tropics, yet in a somewhat different fashion than they might be willing to entertain. In the real world, indeed, ochre is the color of drought and brown dust, of poverty and heat; it is the sub-text and underlying reality of Southern California which instantly reemerges when, leaving its appearance behind you, you cdoss the Mexican border. Ochre is that omnipresent element from which only the massive irrigation of expensive villas makes lush vegetation spring. Even the sea itself is less blue from within the dust bowl; and with these three colors, the "main characters" of Cezanne's visual microcosm are given. This is so far, however, little more than the semantics of CUzanne's color scheme. It would be a mistake to ground our reading on the hypothesis of some universal system of perceptual meanings or color symbolism, whether of a sociological or a "natural" type. Whatever class content ochre may have for us must be historically acquired and symbolically reproduced by this otherwise neutral element; nor are "scientific" ideologies, such as the optical psychology in which Cezanne himself seemed to believe ("le vert etant une couleur des plus gaies et qui fait le plus de bien aux yeux"-letter of 11 May 1886 to Victor Chocquet) of much use in helping us understand how the painting reinvents and virtually produces the symbolic value attributed to it after the fact by this or that theory. Ochre is in other words not to be seen as a static symbol but rather as the result of an operation performed by mechanisms within the painting itself. On our reading, it was a non- color, the place of repression in which the more genuine, positive, primary colors are somehow cancelled out. Yet even this process of cancellation is a dynamic which requires a certain number of preconditions, first and foremost among which is surely the very "positive" value of those primary colors which are the object of its repression in the first place. Green and blue are not in other words static symbols either; they must somehow initially be invested with their positive value in order to be able to take their symbolic places in what is essentially a process. Libidinal analysis is not psychological or psychoanalytic explanation; but these dynamics can be clarified by a digression through depth psychology. It ought to be clear that repression is itself always a process: not some mere steady-state lack of affect, or windless absence of feeling, it is always a way of dealing with the anxieties aroused by some pre-existent desire. To use the Sartrean formula, repression is always repression of something; and this, even in that terrifying emptiness of which the schizophrenic complains, or with that disturbing failure that motivates the hysteric's desperate "desire to desire." The problem is however compounded when we have to do, not with the first-degree situations of the subject's psychic life, but with those second-degree ones which are the realm of aesthetic experience. On some first-degree level, repression of the visual might range from simple sensory privation all the way to pathological disorders of the eye itself: it would in any case exclude in advance any entrance into the aesthetic experience of painting as such. In order for repression to be grasped as a mechanism immanent to the painting itself, and</page><page sequence="7">Three Modem Painters 195 constitutive of a particular aesthetic and visual experience, such as that of Cezanne's works, we would have to show how the eye is first lured into this purely visual realm with promises of some heightened visual gratification, thereupon to learn its lesson of repression or visual renunciation the more surely. At the outside limit, we would have to posit a situation in which the visual experience of repression offers an aesthetic pleasure of some kind in its own right. Such a situation suggests a "transgressive" structure, in which what is to be repressed- we will now call such "positive" instinctual expressions intensities-must first be generated by the libidinal apparatus of the painting before they are available to fill their ritual destinies as its ultimate victims. I believe that this mechanism by which intensities are generated can, in our present purely visual context, be understood in terms of a play of gradations that simulate intensification. (The idea is not mine, but Pierre Klossowski's, in his book on Nietzsche.) To oversimplify things, we may observe that the solid color, taken all by itself (but it never can be taken all by itself), is neither intensity nor its absence. It would be desirable to think intensity as a temporal progression that needs to inscribe itself on a material scale or system of gradation. The impressionists constructed their "libidinal apparatus," generated their characteristic intensities, by a lively interplay between the various colors: the originality of Cezanne, meanwhile, was to have resituated a dynamic of gradations within the individual colors themselves, each of which--blue, green, ochre- now knows a patch-by-patch intensification from faint to strong, by which its own specific intensity is virtually produced. To this heightened exaltation, in which libidinal energy invests the expanding gradations of blue or green, is then opposed the contracting counterforce of ochre, which winds this excitement down and effectively recontains its energies, diverting the emergence of color and intensity into the rather different construction of a pseudo-color in which they are extinguished. This visual story or proto-narrative clarifies the ideology of volume as it informs Cezanne's thinking and that of his critics, and finds expression in that peculiar fragmentary genre of the watercolor sketch--Czanne's version, perhaps, of the practice of the fragment and the aphorism among his contemporaries--in which the paper is seen to be the blank upon which the various intensities become inscribed, and on which and from which volume presumably emerges. Yet Cezanne's well-known account of the matter is in this respect ambiguous: "Only nature can help us progress, and the eye is educated by contact with it. It becomes concentric from looking and working. What I mean is that in an orange, an apple, a sphere, a head, there is a culminating point; and this point is always-despite the difficult effects of shadow and light, and colored sensations--what is closest to our eye; the periphery of objects flees towards a center situated on our horizon" (letter to Emile Bernard, 25 July 1904). Volume is thus invoked in terms of intensities; yet in our reading of these canvasses it can emerge only when we step away and leave the libidinal world of color for that, quite different, of molar forms. The ideology of volume is intended to generate something like a myth about ochre itself: that the latter is not negative, not a form of privation, but rather a color in its own right, a nascent intensity of the same type as blue or green, which knows its own specific density. That the emergence of volume always represents the triumph of ochre, however, suggests that this "event" is of a piece with that celebration of libidinal repression--the period word is "renunciation"-which Cezanne shares with so many other late nineteenth-century artists, HenryJames, Fontane, Mallarme, Ibsen, the ageing Tolstoy or Mark Twain, being among those who come to mind.</page><page sequence="8">196 Unequal Developments This archetypal narrative then knows specific embodiment in the various genres in which Cezanne worked, of which the central one would seem to be landscape. Yet the term is too general for these varied pictures, which tend to organize themselves around village or countryside, houses or mountain: so many ochrescapes, rather, enforcing the dominant of the brownish walls that line the street or village canvasses, the brownish buildings that surge up from an inhabited greenery, and to which from time to time the great bluescapes of the Mont Ste. Victoire are opposed, in which mountain or sky presses outward in liberatory fashion, allowing the bluish air to circulate ever more freely ("la nature, pour nous hommes, est plus en profondeur qu'en surface, d'oui la necessite d'introduire dans nos vibrations de lumiere, representees par les rouges et les jaunes, une somme suffisante de bleutes, pour faire sentir l'air"--letter to Emile Bernard, 15 April 1904). Yet such moments of liberation are provisory and unstable, and tend to be recuperated by their counter-forces: hence such a paradox as the great Bibemus Quarry painting of 1898, in which ochre explodes triumphantly from out of a repressive mass of greenery. Here an immense simulation takes place, in which what is genuinely repressive is coded in terms of the centrifugal, the explosive release of freedom-as though repression were some positive intensity in its own right--while the molar structure of the painting encourages us to read the green vegetation as that from which the eye struggles to emerge. The still lifes represent a significant modification of this narrative scheme, owing to the unexpected role that white suddenly begins to play in them-the porcelain of a statue, above all, the folds of the tablecloth on which the colored shadows of fruit fall. White now marks the momentary suspension of the basic tensions of the repressive operation: it offers the serene ataraxia of a visual space which is neither intensity nor pseudo-color, and which, itself a positive visual experience, holds out the Utopia of a release from the peculiar infernal machine of intensification and its inevitable reversal. We have not yet mentioned the ultimate genre in which Cezanne's libidinal apparatus finds expression, namely the portrait. We need to develop some sense of the peculiar unsuitability of the human body within this scheme of chromatic tensions: its scandalous heterogeneity is perhaps best sensed in the embarrassment we feel before the great nudes, and in particular the various Bathers. Yet the body represents the supreme challenge to this narrative system, and its structural position better than anything else, perhaps, allows us to register the latter's ultimate value as a symbolic act. For flesh, the body, the very support oflibidinal intensity in any conventional scheme of things, has in Cezanne become its opposite: the privileged locus of ochre itself, the ultimate field of expression of the repressive principle, or, ifyou prefer, of the death wish. The portrait, the rarer nude, complete the tendencies inherent in this libidinal machinery; turning back the momentary exaltation and enlargement of landscape or open space, they effectively seal off, drawing the whole now yellowing world of color compromises back into what is now a final repressive center, the human face, the human body. O terrible nineteenth century, whose belle poque is thus secretly peopled with so many emblems of renunciation, like the skeleton who gives her hand to the artist-child among the Sunday finery of Diego's Alameda. III In the late twentieth century, it is best to come by accident upon the shock of painted surfaces for which everything in your own daily life and object world has unwittingly</page><page sequence="9">Three Modem Painters 197 prepared you. You want to enter the permanent collection (in Berlin, it is housed on the lower level of the gallery) in a distracted state, like a Hoffmann character, working your way dutifully back through time, from Romantic interiors through the fateful monumental canvasses of the middle-class age, sniped at by a few eccentric symbolists and expressionists, with only a half-empty lobby and souvenir counter waiting for you at the end of your journey through history. Fatigue, boredom, overstimulated eyes, are the best weakened condition in which to receive, turning as though sensing something behind your back, an immense image on the lobby wall which by some great good fortune you had completely-so unaccountably!--overlooked on your way in. Titles and signatures- Barbara und Gaby, Franz Gertsch, March, 1974--have nothing to do with the ten-by - fifteen feet square hallucinatory surface that at once obliterates everything else around you. Two women, seen from the back, the one standing in the doorway from which you watch this enlarged and floating space, extending a comb to the other, who hesitates between the cosmetics and perfume bottles on her bathroom sink. This photorealism evidently wants to compete with Vermeer, whose textures and surfaces are present in such systematic variety that all the textiles produced by modem civilization, from the material to the towels and the velvet of one of the dressed all the way to denim and the plastic surface of the shower curtain. Among such a range of tactile sollicitations, not skin, but rather the human chevelure stands out as the ultimate material reality; and the comb proffered to it across this bathroom space obscurely designates the painter's act itself, intervening in the tangled hair, carding its fibres, freeing it to shake and glisten in the air and the light, much as he will himself sort out the fingered memory traces of these now purely luminous objects. Something invisible intervenes to silence the reference to Vermeer in the same breath we draw to stammer our impressions of this glossy, flawless surface: an absent presence, something we will never see and which we have no right to deduce, in short, the original photograph from which it was presumably painted and which in some sense thus constitutes the fundamental object of its representation. Why should this abstract knowledge insert itself into our visual field and, undermining the glorious immediacy of the eye, stamp this immense artifact as secretly degraded and commercial? Surely the photographic prop is no more determinant than Cezanne's landscapes or Vermeer's "real" rooms, or the sketches they may have made of them; nothing in it provides any short-cut or substitute for the dextrous hand and brush that had to produce the glow of these fabrics, or the metallic shine of the bottles, the dull white of the bathroom porcelain. The interference has nothing in common with those unfortunate lapses that reveal the mountainous sunset of a movie image to be nothing but a painted backdrop, or the houses of some filmic street to be little more than a studio set. Here, where everything is "mechanical reproduction," there is no room for such humiliation of artificial techniques by the tell-tale remnant or tag-end of a once "natural," real-life situation. The painting, on the contrary, assures us that the "natural" has disappeared without a trace; and this is perhaps the ultimate source of our discomfort, confronted unexpectedly with a nostalgia for the "natural" which this image so triumphantly frustrates. Can it really be true that we would have preferred to keep up the pretenses of some "natural" referent, if only in the brush-strokes of some "real" De Kooning, or in the "knowledge" that Cezanne's landscapes, on a historical date, at that particular hour of the day, under unique local atmospheric conditions, really did exist? And why does photography not intensify this reassurance, instead of undermining it? The photographic original, if it still exists, documents and forever suspends the instant in</page><page sequence="10">198 Unequal Developments which a real comb changed hands within a real apartment. The photographic image, however, dislocates this sense of reality in an unexpected way, by underscoring the mortality of its human subjects. Not the comforting conviction of some ontological referent-not the reassuring illusion of a world of sheer being beyond artistic represen- tation, which the being of the canvas itself reinforces--but rather History and time-the flux in which Cezanne, De Kooning, the landscape around Aix, the painters' studios, their reputation and their paintings themselves, are inexorably carried away-is the unpleasant "fact" this photorealistic interior so unexpectedly confronts us with. Meanwhile, there is the sheer size of this representation, which, like a movie screen, has consequences of its own that are strangely disproportionate with its objects. This is no manageable easel-painting, that you hang, like a small mirror, within the room it represents; nor does this outsized clarity bring any of the minute order of the other end of the telescope. Space and bodies thus enlarged offer a glimpse into other dimensions, in which the humble and the banal, the trivial and the routine, have somehow been secretly, incomprehensibly, transfigured, as though in some mindless replication of consumer society in an alien universe. If the household has one place, indeed, which is effectively beyond nature, it is the modem bathroom. Bloch has written eloquently on this artificial space, in which everything is abstract and non-representational (for even chairs, in other rooms, hold out their arms like human beings, tables "stand," and beds lie open and "invite"). Whoever wishes to flee anthropomorphism is driven into the bathroom; to the other places, as in Balzacian descriptions, too much human activity or idleness clings. Even the photographic infrastructure cannot complete this ultimate depersonalization, which needs a certain staging, certain angle-shots, to avoid the intrusion of those objects still too warm or redolent with human life: a photorealistic representation of human living irrevocably transforms the unnatural into the sentimental, Freud's "uncanny" turning out to be nothing but Andrew Wyeth. Still, there are the bottles, the artificial flora and fauna of that most advanced achievement of commodity civilization, the modern drug-store shelf. Here the production process implicit elsewhere, in the fabrics, the plumbing, even the svelte bodies of these modem young women, is now foregrounded and packaged as such. This glass and plastic array supplies the icons of a religious, even mystical meditation, and throngs the altar towards which both women move and bend. Stoppered bottles distantly remind us of the magical containers and vessels of archaic, long-forgotten fairy tales. The word commodity should here be pronounced none too lightly: for these products have been disconnected from the advertising image-and-fantasy systems which offered them as so many insistent but unformulated wish-fulfillments: yet they are not for all that reduced to the shabby, pitiful materiality of a bathroom closet in which, after the decease of its owner, one comes upon the relics of a lifetime accumulation ofprescription drugs and unfashionable cosmetics. Nor are they transformed into the strange and magical fetishes of the surrealists, into Magritte's immense razor-blades or Breton's baleful and expressionless mannequins. They continue to emit the Utopian promise of consumer society itself, transfigured and projected into some unimaginable post-human space. We have already referred to the mechanism by which the meretricious hints and pledges of the supermarkets and the advertising imagery of our society is thus transformed and visually "fulfilled." It is none other than that "return of the repressed" which Freud- describing its aesthetic manifestation-called the "uncanny": that peculiar effect whereby a</page><page sequence="11">Three Modern Painters 199 represented event becomes intrinsically marked as the repetition of some older, archaic fantasy of which no independent traces remain in the text. This return of the repressed then makes its presence felt by the garish and technicolor representation of what is known to have a sober black-and-white existence, figures as daubed and rouged as in a carnival, objects derealized by the very plenitude of their sensory being, by which, however, the merely perceptual is unmasked as sheer obsession. Ken Russell's Tommy gave a vivid illustration of this process, in which even the normal and wellnigh obligatory represen- tational apparatus of the color film was reduplicated by a heightened, cartoon-like, second- degree artificial coloring system. But if this is so, then the paradoxical importance of the photographic original can now be explained, which must stand as the humdrum initial text, the prosaic everyday black-and-white still, which is to be transformed beyond recognition by the sensorium of photorealism. Photorealism is thus the aesthetic ideology and the fullest living expression of that sterile thing which is consumer capitalism or the societe de consommation. No doubt it projects the latter's view of itself and thereby legitimates it. Are we then ourselves implicitly condemned by the hallucinatory fascination it exercizes over us? Perhaps. And yet this gleaming depersonalization of the commodity vision is strangely silent about its own fundamental impulse, which it neither affirms nor denies, in all the icy neutrality of the reified eye.
