<plain_text><page sequence="1">892432 Biomechanical Responses and Injuries in Blunt Lateral Impact David C. Viano Biomedical Science Dept. General Motors Research Labs. In a recent series of experiments, fourteen unembalmed cadavers were subjected to forty- four blunt lateral impacts at velocities of approximately 4.5, 6.7, or 9.4 m/s with a 15 cm flat 23.4 kg pendulum. Chest and abdominal injuries consisted primarily of rib fractures with a few cases of lung or liver laceration in the highest severity impacts. There were two cases of pubic ramus fracture in the pelvic impacts. In this study, biomechanical respon- ses from the individual tests were normalized to the 50th percentile adult male by an estab- lished procedure. Corridor and average respon- ses were determined for the scaled force- deflection and force-time data at three impact severities. Since serious injury occurred primarily in the highest severity tests, the 6.7 and 9.4 m/s normalized response corridors define the key aspects of biofidelity in blunt lateral impact. The EURQSID and SID dummy have responses that are very different from the essential characteristics of the human impact response as determined in this study. The maximum Viscous response had the best correla- tion with injury risk for chest and abdominal impacts. A tolerance level of VC = 1.5 m/s for the chest and VC = 2.0 m/s for the abdomen was determined for a 25% probability of serious injury. Maximum compression was similarly set at C = 38% for the chest and at C = 44% for the abdomen. Pelvic tolerance to pubic ramus frac- ture was set at 27% compression, since acceler- ation of the hip did not correlate with injury. OCCUPANT PROTECTION IN SIDE IMPACT CRASHES represents one of the next frontiers in automo- tive safety. The basis for product improve- ments is an understanding of the crash types and interior contacts that cause serious to fatal injury when a vehicle is struck on the side. Knowledge of the underlying mechanisms of injury and human response to lateral impact provides the foundation for the development of applicable injury criteria and sétting of human tolerances. The application of these criteria in crash or impact tests requires the use of an anthropomorphic test device or surrogate that has human-like responses to impact force. A dummy with human-like compliance and valid injury criteria enable design engineers to effectively evaluate potential countermeasures to improve occupant protection in side impact crashes. The foundation for this type of research is injury biomechanics (1,2). The 1986 FARS (3) shows that 31.8% of pass- enger car fatalities occur in crashes with the principal direction of force lateral on the vehicle. Approximately two-thirds of the fatalities are in multi-vehicle accidents where the car is struck by another passenger car, truck, or heavy vehicle. The remaining one- third involve single vehicle crashes into pri- marily fixed objects. Approximately an equal number of fatalities occur in driver-side and passenger-side lateral impact crashes. A recent case-study analysis of side impact crashes indicates that a majority of fatalities occur at an intersection and that the victim is primarily an older occupant (4) . Approximately one-half of the fatalities involved the most serious injury to the chest and abdomen by impact on the side interior of the vehicle. Because of the importance of these injuries to the torso, a recent experimental study (5) was conducted of human cadaver impact responses to lateral loading of the chest and abdomen. This research emphasized the development of a data base on the compliance of the chest and abdomen to blunt impact and determined the underlying mechanisms of injury in a speed range compar- able to that in which real-world occupants experience life, -threatening injury in side impacts. The research also included an evalu- ation of lateral impact to thf pelvis, since hip fractures are an important complicating injury in older patients and since distributed loading over the side interior includes the pelvic region. Sufficient biomechanical response data were obtained from the recent cadaver impact series (5) to establish the human force-deflection and 1690</page><page sequence="2">force-time responses to lateral impact of the chest, abdomen and pelvis. This compliance data emphasizes impact responses at approxi- mately 6.7 m/s and 9.4 m/s velocity of impact, but includes comparable data at 4.5 m/s for completeness. The responses establish a data base which describes biofidelity of the human response. The current study involves norma- lising the response data obtained from indivi- dual specimens which have a range in anthropo- metric and mass characteristics to that of the 50th percentile response. Normalization fol- lowed an established procedure (6) as recently adopted by ISO (7) . Corridors bounding the normalized force-deflection and force-time responses were determined for blunt lateral chest, abdominal and pelvic impact at 4.5, 6.7 and 9.4 m/s. The higher speed corridors for chest and abdominal impact establish biofi- delity of the human response in a range of impact resulting in AIS 2-4 injuries, within the range of moderate to critical injury risk in side impact. In contrast, the low severity impacts (4.5 m/s) resulted in injury levels below AIS 1 for the chest and abdominal impact tests . In the original cadaver impact study (5) the average peak force and deflection response of the cadaver was compared with similar test data from the SID and EUROSID. Figure 1 shows significant dissimilarity in the peak response data. The dummies developed significantly higher force and lower deflection than the cadaver. The lack of biofidelity in force- deflection response of the current side impact dummies is a significant deficiency in their ability to simulate the human response and injury in side impacts. Biofidelity is an important requirement of a test dummy since design of side interior padding is optimized to achieve the lowest response in the test device and will result in stiff materials that are compatible with the higher forces developed by the non-human- like dummies. In a study of energy-absorbing padding for side impacts (8-10) , stiff materials that would result from the use of current test devices actually eliminate safety improvements for real-occupants who develop much lower forces and thus need softer materials to achieve bio- compatibility for lateral impact. In addition, the difference in compliance between current test dummies and the human will result in dif- ferent occupant kinematics during side impact testing. The greater deflection experienced by the human chest and abdomen allows the head to move more laterally with respect to the vehi- cle's side interior and will result in a mar- kedly different trajectory of the head from that of current side impact dummies. Obvi- ously, it is important to have a good under- standing of the human-like response to lateral impact so that realistic test dummies and injury criteria can be applied to a systems engineering of improved side impact protection. MATERIALS AND METHODS The experimental methods for the tests analyzed in this paper have been described previously (5) but will be repeated here for completeness. Unembalmed cadavers were pro- vided through the Department of Anatomy at Wayne State University Mjdical School as part of a willed-body program. They had an average age of 53.8 ± 13.9 years and body weight of 67.2 ± 16.2 kg. Anthropometric data were com- piled for each specimen prior to testing and followed the recommended practices of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, Department of Transportation. Summary anthro- pometry are given in Table 1. Specimen Selection and Handling - The specimen were selected on an age, condition, and cause of death criteria, which limited age to approximately 65 years unless the specimen was of good skeletal condition, to specimen known not to have a long period of bed rest or debilitating disease prior to death and to specimen without infectious disease. Each specimen was examined radiologically to assure against pre-existing fractures or anomalies that would influence experimental responses. All cadavers were tested after rigormortis had passed. In some of the specimen, the average time lapsed between expiration and actual testing was one to two weeks. In other specimen, the time lapse was greater between expiration and testing, so the specimen was frozen (4°F) for a period of time. Prior to testing, frozen spec- imen were stored in a refrigerator at 35° F. No attempt was made to bring internal body temperature up to physiologic levels at the time of testing. However, the specimen was exposed to room temperature for several hours during instrumentation and preparation. Instrumentation and Preparation - Prior to a test, the cadaver was instrumented with an array of accelerometers attached to the spine and pelvis. For these tests, a triaxial accel- erometer package was attached to the first, eighth and twelfth thoracic vertebrae and a similar triaxial accelerometer package attached to the pelvic region at the second sacral ver- tebrae. Targets were attached to the triaxial clusters for photographic coverage and film analysis. 1 The rationale and experimental protocol for use of human cadaver research subjects in this program have been reviewed by the Research Laboratories 1 Human Research Committee . The research complies with the provisions of the Uniform Anatomical Gift Act, follows guidelines established by the US Department of Transportation, National Highway Traffic Safety Administration and recommendations of the National Research Council of the National Academy of Sciences, and adheres to the provisions of The Declaration of Helsinki . 1691</page><page sequence="3">Table 1 WSU Lateral Impact Cadaver Information Chest Waist Hip Runs Cadaver Sex Age Weight Height Breadth Breadth Breadth # # (years) (kg) (cm) (cm) (cm) (cm) 2 863 Male 49 107.00 176.0 37.5 38.5 37.0 3 RNY1 Female 76 44.00 153.5 26.8 27.0 28.5 4 935 Male 63 69.85 174.0 28.0 27.0 31.5 5,6 947 Male 38 56.25 166.5 29.0 25.5 28.0 7,8 954 Male 66 56.25 159.0 27.0 25.5 29.0 9,10 RNY2 Male 64 61.69 171.0 28.0 33.0 35.0 11-13 956 Female 40 76.20 175.0 29.5 33.5 39.5 14-16 993 Male 49 70.76 173.0 31.5 31.5 32.5 17-22 986 Male 29 70.30 173.0 30.0 28.0 33.5 23-28 047 Male 62 83.91 176.5 32.5 34.5 37.0 29-33 008 Female 52 53.07 157.0 28.5 29.5 33.0 34,35 063 Male 64 48.54 173.0 32.0 34.0 32.0 36-39 UOMI Male 37 67.59 186.5 30.5 30.5 32.5 40-45 U0M2 Male 64 75.76 178.5 33.5 34.5 39.5 15 ~| O DOTSID 15 1 OD0TSID □ EUR0SID CHEST □ EUR0SID Q.„ • CADAVER • CADAVER ^ fia,. ^ r) 8-2 n/s ^ Z 10- tí. 8.2 m/s ^ z 10- □ ' © © &lt;5.7 m/s ^ 9.4 m/s ^ 9.4 m/s £ 6.7 m/s ^ I . £ I 5- °. 6.7 m/s - I ^ 5- 3 '* O ... 4.3 m/s O 4J m/s ' ,'4 ļ ' , 0-1 , 1 , 0-1 , , , 0 5 10 15 0 10 20 30 Peak Deflection (cm) Time (ms) 15 1 □... o DOTSID ABDOMEN 15 ] R O DOTSID 8.2 m/s □ EUR0SID 8.2 m/s □ EUROSID • CADAVER • CADAVER 'Z 10- zT 10- w w © O'- O / £ "□ 9.4 m/s tf Q -9.4 m/s / Č £ , -'I , £ tf ' /1 , ^ $.7 m/s , T , ^ $.7 m/% J Š- '■ O £ 5" ' o.. □ D 1 * 1 4.3 m/s i ļ 1 4-3 m/» I "' ę , 0-j , , , 0-1 1 r- - 1 0 5 10 15 0 10 20 30 Peak Deflection (cm) Time (ms) Figure 1: Plots of the peak force and deflection from blunt lateral impact of the human cadaver chest and abdomen and current side impact test dummies at three levels of severity, from (5) . 1692</page><page sequence="4">The arterial system of the cadaver was pressurized by normal saline infused through a Foley catheter inserted with its end in the aorta above the diaphragm. À vent tube was inserted in the brachial artery. Prior to an experiment, the catheter balloon was pres- surized to block the flow below it and saline was pumped into the body until it flowed out of the vent tube. The vent was then clamped, thus ensuring that the system above the blockage included the chest and upper abdominal organs. The lung was carefully drained of any fluid and then aerated repeatedly with room air prior to testing. The lung was pressurized. Necropsy - After testing, x-rays were taken, instrumentation was removed from the specimen, and the cadaver was returned to cold storage. Autopsy was performed by a board certified pathologist, and special attention was paid to injury of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis. At the completion of the necropsy, the specimen was returned to the Department of Anatomy for appropriate disposition. Data Analysis - High speed movies of the impact were taken at 2,000 frames per second from the frontal and 500 frames per second from the posterior and overhead views. Frame-by- frame analysis of the impact event formed the basis for the instantaneous deflection data of the torso and hip. The instantaneous deflec- tion data were processed to derive the compres- sion and Yiscous responses based on an estab- lished algorithm (11,12). Contact was indi- cated by a flash on a movie frame and a simul- taneous tick mark on an electronic data chan- nel, generated by the same contact switch clo- sure. This defined time zero. In the film analysis, interpolation was made between adja- cent frames to establish time zero where neces- sary. The acceleration channels were processed according to a digital SAE or finite impulse response filter. Injury Functions - Viscous Response [VC(t)] - A time function produced by multiplying the instantaneous velocity of deformation and com- pression responses (units in m/s, derived from film data) . Compression Response [C (t) ] - The instan- taneous deformation divided by the initial torso thickness along the axis of the impact (dimensionless , derived from film data) . Spinal Acceleration Response [Gsp(t)] Instantaneous lateral acceleration of the spine measured by an accelerometer on Tl, T8, T12 or pelvis at S3 (units in g's derived from elec- tronic data) . Force [F(t)] - Impact force resulting from pendulum contact (units in kN's, derived from acceleration of the pendulum from electronic data multiplied by the pendulum mass) . Injury Criteria - Viscous Criterion [VC] max - The peak Viscous response. Compression Criterion [C]max - The peak compression response. Spinal Acceleration Criterion [Gspjmax - The peak lateral or resultant spinal acceler- ^ ation response. Force Criterion [F]max - The peak force acting on the body. Statistical Methods - The means of the biomechanical responses were compared with the severity of the exposure. The significance level for acceptance or rejection of the null hypothesis was p = 0.05. If p &lt; 0.05, the null hypothesis was rejected and a significant dif- ference between the means was established. When two responses were compared, the correla- tion coefficient, R, was also provided. Injury risk functions were computed using the Logist function in the Statistical Analysis Package, SAS. This function relates the probability of injury occurrence P(x) to the magnitude of a response parameter x based on a statistical fit to ajigmoidal function P(x) = [1 + exp (a - ßx)] . The goodness-of-f it of thg statistic is quantified by the chi-squared (j ), p-value (p) and correlation coefficient (R) . The Impact - While the initial tests were conducted with the WSU translational impactor, subsequent experiments were conducted with a power-assisted pendulum impactor (Figure 2) . The 23.4 kg pendulum was freely suspended by guide wires and accelerated to impact speeds of 3.6-10.2 m/s in 5 cm by a pneumatically charged cylinder with thrust piston. The impactor operates on the following principle. The thrust piston is attached to a disc that slides tightly in the charge cylinder and is set against an orifice plate by a holding pressure. A small diameter 0-ring seals the set chamber from the opening to the charge cylinder. Because of the area difference, a much larger pressure can be put into the charge cylinder with equilibrium being maintained (a higher force on the disc from the set chamber) . The level of charge pressure determines the thrust velocity. Impact is initiated by injecting a trig- gering pressure between the sliding disc and orifice plate, and venting the set chamber. This allows the greater charge pressure to act on the entire diameter of the disc and rapidly accelerates the piston and power pendulum to impact speed. After 10 cm of travel, the disc and piston are decelerated by an internal pad allowing the pendulum to continue in free flight. Impact speed was confirmed by a light- beam trap and time-interval counter. The for- ward motion of the pendulum was stopped after 40 cm of contact by a force-limiting cable tether. The cadaver was suspended upright with hands and arms overhead. The specimen was rotated 30° so the point of pendulum contact was lateral on the thorax or abdomen. This protocol was used to assure that full lateral thoracic and abdominal impact occurred with the axis of force through the center of gravity of the torso. It resulted in controlled compres- sion of the torso without coincident rotation of the body about the spine axis. The center of pendulum impact on the thorax was aligned with the xiphoid process (7.5 cm below midster- num) . Abdominal impact was aligned 7.5 cm 1693</page><page sequence="5">Figure 2: Experimental set-up with a pneumatic power-assisted pendulum and upright supported specimen, from (5) .

Pelvic impacta were conducted at 90° lateral with the impactor centered on the greater tro- chanter . The pendulum interface was a smooth, flat, 15 cm diameter disc with the edges rounded. The axis of impact force was horizontal and aligned through the approximate center of grav- ity of the torso for chest and abdomen tests (approximately 2 cm anterior of the intrathor- acic surface of the vertebrae) . A uniaxial accelerometer was attached to the pendulum and its response was multiplied by the pendulum mass to give the force of impact. A suspension system released the arms at impact and approxi- mated a free torso response to impact. The off-side of impact was padded to gradually support the free body response. Multiple tests were conducted on a specimen to increase bio- mechanical response data. This could include a low-severity left abdominal impact, an injur- ious high-severity thoracic test and a lateral pelvic impact. Injuries were assigned to the appropriate impact condition. Normalizing the Data - The biomechanical response data were normalized by the procedure of Mertz (6) as used in a recent ISO proposal (7) . The procedure scales responses to an arbitrarily chosen standard subject from test data collected on subjects with different phys- ical characteristics. The approach is based on the concept that impact responses vary with physical characteristics of subjects. Acceler- ation data generated in side impact on cadavers is used in the analysis as input to satisfy impulse-momentum requirements. Dimensions such as cadaver mass, chest breadth (or abdomen and waist breadth) are taken into consideration in the analysis. The 50th percentile male dimen- sions such as mass (76 kg), chest breadth (34.9 cm), abdomen breadth (31.4 cm) and pelvic breadth (38.5 cm) are used as constants in the formulae. The impulse-momentum analysis for a two body impact is used to establish the effec- tive mass of the impacted body region: M = Tf M G dt/Tf G dt (1) cJopp/Joc where M is the pendulum mass, G the pendulum acceleration, and G the résultant spinal acceleration at T8 for chest impacts, T12 for abdominal impacts and S3 for the pelvic impacts. The normalization procedure uses the following factors: Impactor Acceleration Factor - (Rg)p = (2) (Rk)1/2 * (Rm)1/2 * (Mp + Mc)1/2 /(Mp + Ms) 1/2 Thoracic Acceleration Factor - (Rg)T = (3) (Rk) 1/2 * (Rm)""1/2 ♦ (Mp+Mc)1/2 / (Mp + Ms) 1/2 Time Factor - Rt = (Rk) ^2 * (Rm)1/2 * (4) (Mp+Mc)1/2 / (Mp + Ms)1/2 1/2 ' Displacement Factor - Rx = (Rm) ' * (5) (Rk)-1/2 * (Mp + Mc)1/2/ (Mp + Ms)1/2 where, the thoracic mass ratio is Rm = Ms/Mc, thoracic stiffness ratio is Rk = Ks/Kc, and stiffness is given by K. The subscript c is used to represent cadaver and s the standard subject. For each group of tests at a similar speed and body region, an average ratio (AR) is determined for the mass ratio Mc/Mb where Mb is the total mass of that cadaver. The "standard" mass (Ms) of specimen in a test group is given by Ms = 76.0 * AR, where 76.0 is the mass of the 50th percentile male. The stiffness of each cadaver is assumed proportional to the breadth of the torso or pelvis. Using this information, the necessary scaling factors are given in Table 2 for tests at three impact speeds on the thorax, abdomen or pelvis. These scale factors were used on the pendulum accel- eration, time, resultant spinal accelerations, and displacements to produce normalized response data. Determining Corridors - The normalized force-deflection and force-time data for the nine test conditions were used to determine corridors within which the response data fell. This was done iteratively between the two response types to obtain a compatible set of boundary points which define upper and lower response corridors when connected by straight lines. In several cases an individual test was excluded from the corridor definition because it was markedly different from the others which clustered around a typical response. A review of the normalized responses and corridors for the chest and abdominal data showed considerable similarity in response so the chest and abdomen responses were merged defining normalized responses and corridors for blunt torso impact. Average Responses - Average responses for the force-deflection and force-time data were calculated for the grouped data at three impact severities. Only the loading portion of the force-deflection response was analyzed by determining the average and standard deviation in force at 1.0 cm intervals of deflection. The average and standard deviation in force was also computed at 5 ms intervals to determine the average force-time response. Impact Velocity Scaling - The scaled bio- mechanical data for the 50th percentile male response were rescaled to a common impact speed to reduce the variability due to different impact conditions. This renormalization involved choosing a standard impact speed of 4.3, 6.7, or 9.5 m/s and multiplying the scaled responses by a factor accounting for a test speed that was different from the standard condition. The renormalization is also based on the assumption that the impact experiment can be represented by a mechanical system comprised of two masses attached by a spring. The body region is assumed of constant stiffness during impact.

Thus, for tests of differing velocity, a renor- malization of deflections to a standard impact speed is given by: Rx' = ds/dc = Vs/Vc * Rx, (7) where Ys is the standard and Vc the test impact velocity. The impactor acceleration scales for test speed differences by: (Rg)p' = Vs/Vc * (Rg)p, (8) but the time factor is not affected by renor- malization. RESULTS The original biomechanical response and injury data (5) for the chest, abdomen and pelvic impacts are reprinted here for complete- ness (Table 3-6) . Three of six tests in the high velocity chest impact series resulted in lacerative injury of the lung, liver, dia- phragm, kidney or spleen. These injuries were associated with flail chest, which was defined as two fractures on four consecutive ribs or more than eight rib fractures in the thorax. In the high-velocity chest impact series, five of six specimen had flail chest with an average of 14 rib fractures. There were only two cases of severe upper abdominal injury in the high severity impacts and they consisted of lacer- ation of the liver and diaphragm. In these impacts, only one of four specimen experienced more than eight rib fractures. There were six high velocity lateral impacts of the hip and, in spite of the high severity of loading, there were only two incidents of skeletal injury. The fractures involved the pubic ramus in both cases. In terms of overall injury severity, each exposure was summarized by the number of rib fractures or skeletal injury, the maximum severity of skeletal trauma (SAIS) , and the maximum overall severity of injury (MAIS) . Response and injury data were averaged for three pendulum impact speeds for the chest, abdomen, and pelvis (Table 6) . In all of the cases of chest and abdominal impact, responses increased as the severity of impact speed increased. The experimental protocol maximized the opportunity to define a correlation between injury and the measured response parameters but also set up the possibility that unrelated or weakly related parameters would also correlate with injury. While this maximized the possi- bility of defining relationships, it minimized the chance of pinpointing underlying causal biomechanics. A comparison of the chest and abdominal impacts indicates a similar level of peak force, deflection, and compression for each level of impact severity. The Viscous response was higher in the abdominal impacts probably because of less skeletal structure resisting the low-deflection response. A lack of vital- ity in the upper abdominal organs may have led to a lower average severity of abdominal injury than occurred in chest impacts of comparable impact severity. Internal chest injury was frequently associated with multiple rib frac- tures indicative of flail chest from the lat- eral impact. For the pelvic impacts, the force increased with the increasing severity of impact speed. In contrast, the average deflection went down between the higher severity impacts, although there was an increase in variability in the responses. This, in part, may be due to higher deflections with pubic ramus fracture and lower levels without. For pelvic impacts, the higher forces and accelerations in the highest sever- ity impacts imply more whole-body acceleration with lower average levels of pelvic com- pression. The blunt lateral pelvic impacts generally resulted in no injury with these test conditions . Figures 3-5 show the original and norma- lized force-deflection and force-time responses for the low, middle, and high severity impacts of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis respectively. The force-deflection response is a key biomech- anical response and defines the compliance of the torso or pelvis under lateral impact. The area under each curve represents the amount of energy absorbed by body deformation. Deflection-time and Viscous-time responses for these tests can be found in (5) . Corridors bounding the force-deflection and force-time responses for the low, middle and high severity impacts are given in Figures 6-8 for the chest, abdomen and pelvic experiments. Since there were only two tests for the middle severity pelvic impacts and the responses fol- lowed the same trend, corridors were not deter- mined. The chest and abdominal impact respon- ses were sufficiently similar so that a com- bined corridor was established for the torso compliance at each impact severity (Figure 9) . The average force-deflection and force-time responses for the merged chest and abdomen impact data are shown in Figure 10. The dotted lines represent one standard deviation in response. The average responses for the three impact severities are given in Figure 11. Logist analysis of the biomechanical responses identified risk functions for four or more rib fractures (MAIS 3+) , or critical injury or 9+ rib fractures (MAIS 4+) . The Viscous response had the strongest correlation with serious to critical injury for responses measured in the chest and abdominal impacts, and compression was the only parameter corre- lating with pubic ramus fracture in the pelvic impacts (Table 7) . Peak force had a higher correlation with serious injury but is an input parameter measured on the pendulum. Maximum chest compression was also a significant corre- late with serious injury, whereas none of the responses correlated with the risk of moderate skeletal injury in the lateral abdominal impacts. Pelvic compression emerged as the only correlate with pubic ramus fracture. Although based on only two cases of injury, there is a correlation in contrast to acceler- ation responses. 1697</page><page sequence="9">Tabi« 4 Cadav«r Impact R«apona«a and Inj uri «a for Lat«ral Abdominal Impact tsssss::::s:::;:::::srrss::::r=::::rz:::::::ss:s:ssr:::s:s:s::s:s::sssss:sss:s:s:ss:::=:ss:==s:ss:::::::::=::=:::::::::::s::r:::::::xEsssn Impactor Pend.

Logi s t injury probability functions are plotted in Figure 12 for the probability of serious injury as a function of the Viscous and com- pression response of the chest and abdomen, and compression for the lateral pelvic impact. A 95% confidence interval is also given. The functions are sigmoidal in shape indicating three distinct regions. For low values of the response, there is a region of very low risk of injury. Similarly, for the very high values of the response, there is a flat high-risk of serious injury outcome. In-between is a region where injury risk is proportional to the asso- ciated response. The sigmoidal function is typical of a risk distribution with a biomech- anical response. In addition to the underlying relationship between the biomechanical response and injury, it represents the distribution in tolerance of a population with weaker and stronger subjects. Based on the Logist analysis, tolerance levels were determined. A risk level of 25% probability of serious injury was used to esta- blish tolerance for the chest and abdomen (Table 8) . This probability level is consis- tent with previous studies of injury risk from human cadaver and animal impacts. The level is considered an appropriate trade-off for bal- anced protection of the population at risk and represents a risk similar to that found in current crash protection standards. For pelvic impact, the tolerance is set for 25% proba- bility of pubic ramus fracture. DISCUSSION The new human impact data (5) which is further analyzed in this study adds to the current understanding of lateral impact respon- ses for the chest, abdomen and pelvis. The low-speed chest impact load history and peak spinal acceleration in these tests are similar to those observed in previous experiments at UÏTRI (13) , even though the earlier data are for 90° lateral impact as opposed to 60° lat- eral in this study. The lower energy in the low speed tests did not result in a significant whole-body rotation as observed in a higher severity pendulum impact conducted at 90° . There are no other published data we know of to compare with the current results. Chest compliance is softer in lateral impact of the rib cage than for midsternal frontal loading. This can be explained by the flatter arch of the ribs for lateral impact as opposed to the narrower and symmetric rib cage geometry encountered in frontal loading. In addition, the lateral impacts are 7.5 cm lower than the frontal tests at midsternum. It was necessary to lower the height of chest loading to avoid direct contact with the arm and shoul- der attachments to the rib cage thus ensuring complete rib cage loading in these experiments. Even though there are significant anatom- ical differences, the normalized plateau forces for lateral impact are only slightly lower than the responses observed by Neathery (14) for midsternal impact. The frontal data have been used to develop the Hybrid III dummy rib cage which has demonstrated biofidelity for 6.7 m/s (15) and higher speed (16) impacts. The human responses used to develop the Hybrid III dummy have forces that were raised by 0.67 kN (150 lbs.) to simulate the effects of normal muscle tension in a seated occupant. No such force addition was done in the current study or in a recent reanalysis of the frontal impact data (5) , but should be added to the chest impact corridors for similarity in test dummy rational and characteristics. The corridor responses for chest, abdomen, and pelvis provide new information for the development and evaluation of side impact dum- mies. A recent effort by Lau et al (17) uti- lized the concept of spring-steel ribs, with damping material attached to demonstrate that biofidelity can be achieved for the lower severity lateral impacts. No tests had been conducted for that paper at the highest speed; however, recent experiments with the second generation of the side impact thorax now called BIQSID are encouraging and show that biofi- delity and durability may be achievable for blunt impacts in the range of 6.7-9.4 m/s. The original 3-rib chest design has evolved into a five rib torso (3 chest ribs and 2 abdominal "ribs"). The second generation design takes advantage of the similarity in the blunt impact compliance of the chest and abdo- men, and utilizes identical ribs for the new side impact torso. The BIOSID design achieves a light weight rib cage, something that was a significant deficiency in the SID and EUROSID (9) . In addition, the ribs can be easily tailored to the required force-deflection response by tapering. A spinal block on which the ribs fit has been designed to accommodate components of the EUROSID and Hybrid III dummy thus increasing the flexibility in use of the GMR BIOSID torso. Figures 13-15 are the renormalized, scaled response data for a standard test speed of 4.3, 6.7, and 9.5 m/s on the chest, abdomen, and pelvis. Superimposed on these plots are the corridors shown in Figures 6-8. For the chest and pelvis, the standard test speed of 4.3 m/s slightly lowers the peak force and deflection because many of the individual tests were at much higher speeds. In contrast, the biomechanical data is minimally changed for the higher impact speeds. This additional scaling indicates that the determined corridors are an appropriate performance requirement for the lateral impact biomechanics of the human chest, abdomen, and pelvis. This study has recognized that direct loading of the chest and abdomen is an impor- tant cause of injury to near-side occupants in multi-vehicle side impact crashes. Injuries can occur during the rapid compression phase of loading since occupants usually experience high-velocity impact by the side interior in a severe crash.

Selection of appropriate side interior padding requires the use of a test device with human-like force-deflection charac- teristics and injury response measurements as a first step in an effort to match side interior padding with human tolerances. Previous (1, 11, 12) and current (5) research on human cadavers shows that the Vis- cous response is the best correlate of soft tissue, rib cage and internal injury risk, including injury in the elderly. Use of VC offers the possibility of making realistic improvements in side-impact safety. Use of an acceleration based criteria, such as TTI, may reduce or eliminate the ultimate benefits of padding in side impact crashes, and may parti- cularly place the elderly at risk of injury, when the use of proper injury criteria would lead to realistic and effective improvements in safety (10) . On the basis of this study, our previous research (11,12), and recent experiments with anesthetized pigs (18) , the maximum Viscous response should be limited to protect against injury during the rapid phase of body deforma- tion of the chest and abdomen during side impact loading. As shown in previous work (8), serious internal injury can occur without a significant number of rib fractures or rib cage injury at all. This evidence supports the potential for the early occurrence of soft tissue and rib cage injury at about the time of maximum Viscous response and where deflection or compression of the body has reached only about half of its maximum value. There is also a need to limit maximum chest compression during crash testing to protect against crushing injuries which may occur during slow or static deformation of the chest and abdomen. This is clearly a different mechanism of injury than the Viscous mechanism. Limiting the Vis- cous and compression response is a complemen- tary approach to assessing safety systems (11, 12) . Our data also indicate that compression of the pelvis may be a better predictor of hip fracture than pelvic acceleration.
