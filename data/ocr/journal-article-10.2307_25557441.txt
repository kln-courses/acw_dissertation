<plain_text><page sequence="1">"It is not inconceivable that even the most abstract creations of painting, given the material and its visual organisation, retain vestiges of representationality which they claim to abolish." Thus Theodor Adorno, in a passage of his Aesthetic Theory which is officially concerned with the drama of Samuel Beckett. Samuel Walsh, showing a large collection of paintings and drawings in the Limerick City Gallery of Art, prompts a recollection of the radical mandarin's pro nouncement. It is a very large exhibition, thirty-one items in all, and not all of these are travelling to the Triskel Arts Centre in Cork and the Project Gallery in Dublin. Some of the work has been seen in Dublin earlier: Study 82 and Study 83 (both dating from 1988) were included in the Oliver Dowling Gallery Christmas show of that year, and six other items featured in a smaller display of drawings in April 1988. But these previous outings in no way diminish the impact of the Limerick exhib ition. One's first impression of the show in its fullest form is an expansiveness, even variety, more often associated with Nature herself (god bless her) than with abstrac tion. For Walsh in his own way is even fur ther from the frantic energies of Abstract Expressionism than Cecil King (in his dif ferent way) was. Moreover, since Walsh's earlier work, with its careful introduction of the diagonal and its virtually monochrome texturing, colour has flush ed across the canvas (or rather cotton) of Arena II and is felt almost everywhere else as an imminence. That innovative diagonal is well exemplified in Untitled 68, (oil-stick on paper, 1986). In its gesture towards the broken column, the painting conjures something of a lost classical inheritance but does so with a certain fussy emphasis on such innovation. Three years later, sym metry still rules, but a process of inversion radically challenges (maybe even vitiates) some of the principles upon which abstrac tion has been based. In the most elementary terms the pic tures on view can be said to treat a single kind of shape. This is rigorously con structed ? dominated by right angles, and essentially involving two elements ? a block-like element into which incursions may or may not be made, and an axis-like element which may project from the block towards the bottom or top of the canvas. There are of course variations on the theme, and part of the excitement of the show's immediate impact results from the serrations which Walsh has introduced without violating his symmetrical commit ment. The shape thus described is of course central in the pictures, and the material reaching between its lines and the edge of the canvas has the initial ap pearance of monochrome (and hence of compliance with the laws of symmetry), while on closer inspection it thrums with assymetrical scribble and even foams somewhat onto the chaste edges of the rectangular junctions of the shape. The inversion upon which the entire ex hibition balances determines the position of the axis-as-projection in relation to the block. When the axis projects downwards towards the bottom of the picture, the block above appears as a form. When, on the other occasions, this axis element pro jects out from the block towards the top edge, then the block appears as a shape. The effect can be disorientating because it also rules out perspective and the rep resentation of natural objects: in the well known optical illusions where two lines simultaneously enclose a vase between them and outline facial profiles beyond them (and yet frustrate simultaneous perception of both operations of these lines), the result depends on the availability of implied perspective and representation. In Walsh's work, each picture has its shape or its form: one looks from picture to pic ture increasingly aware of this radical af filiation between shape and form. A conventional response might well argue that Walsh has reintroduced into abstraction particular notions of a horizon tal/vertical distinction which are perhaps only philosophically at home in a theory of mimesis now reduced to bungalow status. That is, the top of his picture is at some risk of becoming a natural zenith or even upper horizon. Perhaps Walsh's ab solute maintenance of symmetry in his forms and shapes keeps this risk firmly in check. Certainly, the general ambience of the work remains very different to that of Mary Fitzgerald and Felim Egan (fellow workers in the Dowling Gallery), and there is little evidence of the charted nature which haunts (like a memory) Fitzgerald's Drawing Room collection. Nevertheless the austerity of Walsh's abstraction also measures its precarious balance. Optical il lusion is a by-product of abstraction, ac cording to a taped commentary provided by the artist himself for visitors to the Limerick City Gallery. 'By-product' sounds like a bonus: 'side-effect' might provide a closer analogy. On an end wall of the Gallery, Arena VI dominates the scene with its paradox ical breadth. Constructed of several panels because Walsh insists on working to a unitary scale compatible with a strictly domestic production of art, and then assembled in the gallery, this broad panorama again teases with its sugges tion of representation. Or rather, with the suggestion of an idea of representation which is once more disciplined by the pervasive symmetry of the artist's vision. The refusal of the outer panels to have their straight lines swoop or droop into conformity with perspective does more than banish an illusion of representation, it also eliminates or at least jeopardises the privileged viewer who, occupying a single unique point of viewing, commands the painting to unfold around him/her. In stead, something like a congregational relationship develops, according to which the wide assembly of panels has to be viewed in a collective of responses. The placing of Arena VI on the end wall of a long room enhances the suggestion of an altar piece, and indeed the re-installation of the exhibitions in the Triskel and the Project may tell a lot about the work as a whole. In their first manifestation, the Arena paintings take their bearings from the comparative vastness of Arena VI, its refusal to address any singular point of focus. It is in this connection that Theodor Adorno's remarks on the persistence of a spectral representationalism in even the most thorough-going abstract painting become intriguing for the viewer of Sam Walsh's work. Aidan Dunne in Drawing the Line, his introduction to the exhibition catalogue, links these new paintings to a previous Island series and suggests that the "symmetrical crosses" of the new work derive from the tau cross. There is certainly a sculptural and architectural dimension to the work: or, to be more precise, the work looks like one dimension of sculptural or architectural ideas. This is vestigialism in the extreme, this retention of (as it were) a single dimension through the determin ed breadth and blockiness of the forms and shapes which proliferate in the exhibition. Marble as mere surface, without depth, without the implication of a third field of tonal play, is virtually inconceivable: these Arena paintings similarly have the look of fonts or diminished altars that are looked at by a congregation impaired or censored or diminished in this extreme manner. The representational vestige now becomes clear, either as a by-product of abstraction or as an incompletely domin ated aspect of an inimitable world. Ec clesiastical furniture, that's it....But then the severe and systematic inversion of Walsh's forms and spaces also provides an image. And this cannot be interpreted as a square font standing on a single stem: this alternative image descends from the top edge of the paintings and now acquires its illusory representationality also. Dunne speaks of predatory saws in connection with Walsh's serrations. Perhaps so, but the question of proportion is tense in so rigidly symmetrical a field as any of these paintings. Not saws, but the bits which drill the earth or the sea-bed pulse from the centre of Walsh's spaces, to challenge the fonts which his forms appear to be. The bit is colossal, and being seen to be col ossal it no longer looks like the bit of the 'Black-and-Decker' your grandad used in the garden shed.

If these are both ? the fonts and the bits, the first rising, the second descending ? the optical illusions abstraction provides as by-products, then the tension between the two illusory elements is central and im perceptible. The poles of this tension can then be identified in various rough and ready ways. Sanctity and exploitation, repose and aggression, past and future. But as with any decent self-respecting ten sion, these identifications of its polar terms are merely temporary, incomplete and so, misleading. The font as emblem of a re novated sacral life is always with us, at least since Vatican II sanctioned a campaign of church refurbishment; the altar, once again recognisable as a table, likewise. The oil rig, with its massively enlarged version of the artisan's hand-drill has assumed a similar but hidden presence in our spiritual economy. That Walsh's abstraction can spin off such complementary images ? even if these are in the nature of illusion ? and hold them in tension, is a tribute to the integrity of his endeavour as an abstract painter. The admission of representationality is involuntary, not in the sense that it constitutes any kind of lapse of attention, but in the sense that it signifies a human resistance to system and interpretation. Adorno's "administered world"', a society in which every aspect of human activity is suffused with a ready made purposefulness and suffused also with a palpable lack of initiative, is just round the corner. The free gifts are man datory, especially when they are withdrawn, Our corner, our turn now. Walsh's painting is tough on corners.
