Daniel Gimaret's Les noms divins en Islam is an extremely important and useful work. The author's rigorously critical approach enables the reader to perceive the main weaknesses of leading Muslim theologians and Islamic theology itself (a discipline which, it must be recalled, both the mystics and the philosophers of Islam have always held in very low esteem). The book also has the merit of dispelling widespread illusions about the meanings of Allah's names and how they should be translated. Gimaret begins by explaining that his survey avoids the Sufi analysis of the divine names, and concentrates instead on commentaries upon the Qur'an and theological works by Sunnis and members of the rationalizing Mu'tazilite school. First, he examines the literary genre of the treatise devoted to the exegesis of God's names, and then discusses debates on the problem of how to decide which names can legitimately be given to him. After this, the author considers the famous saying attributed to Muhammad, according to which God has 99 names, and looks at the different lists of them. He is surprised that the list usually used is not the one in greatest conformity with the Qur'an. One must observe that for many years now English-language research publications have tended to emphasize the non-Qur'anic origins of Islamic beliefs and institutions. After a discussion of speculation concerning God's Supreme Name, Gimaret looks at the various methods of classifying the names, and himself opts for a thematic classification, in the framework of which he analyses each individual name in detail. In the course of this analysis some famous theologians are given rough treatment. The most respectable of all, Ash'ari (d. 935), is frequently taken to task for his tautological "definitions": he defines "enduring" (bdqt) as "that which has endurance", and "endurance" as "that by which the enduring endures"! Similarly, a god is "that which has divinity". However, as the author observes, Ash'ari, like other Muslim theologians, also goes in for another type of " definition ": isolating the most special aspect of a thing, in the case of God his creative power. It is significant that Muslim theologians prefer to call God "the Creator", while Sufis call him "the Real". The Mu'tazilites, so long the object of romanticizing adulation in the West, fare little better at Gimaret's hands. One of their leading representatives, 'Abd al-Jabbar (d. 1025), is shown to hold hopelessly contradictory positions: he even declares at one point that God can be seen - a doctrine which he condemns elsewhere and which his school notoriously rejects, in opposition to mainstream Islam. Such inconsistency is perhaps not surprising, given 'Abd al-Jabbar's "definition" of knowledge: it is defined by its distinctive characteristic, a feeling of calm certainty. The Mu'tazilites' exact mathematical system of recompense for good works, sins and sufferings causes the author much amusement: if one suffers at the hands of a tyrant who has no good works to his credit, and therefore cannot be mulcted of them to his victim's advantage, God has to grant the tyrant the necessary sum! Besides, this system makes the doctrine of Muhammad's intercession redundant: it works only for the penitent, who precisely because of their repentance do not need it. What is most worrying, however, is to find that Ash'arfs follower Fakhr al-Din RazI (d. 1209), admired as the originator of a new movement in Islamic theology, and the man who held out the most promise of giving it a sound philosophical basis, was a shameless plagiarist. Gimaret's demonstration of this must come as something of a blow to those who have extolled Razfs originality, independence and freedom of mind. Moreover, as the author shows, RazI is repeatedly inconsistent when trying to decide whether God can be called a thing.</page><page sequence="2">REVIEWS OF BOOKS 151 Gimaret's book is also most valuable for the corrections (sometimes striking) which he brings to old-established mistranslations. He is spectacularly successful in his treatment of the omnipresent formula bi-smi lldhi r-rahmdni r-rahlm, usually rendered " In the name of God, the Merciful, the Compassionate", in the belief that both of the names added to that of Allah referred to his clemency. Blachere, in 1952, had pointed out that rahmdn did not mean "Clement", but "Beneficent". Now Gimaret demonstrates that rahlm does not mean "Misericordieux", but "Benevolent". Rahma does not mean "mercy" or "clemency", but "benevolence", and in God's case either this quality itself or one of its particular manifestations. The idea of forgiveness, central to the Christian concept of mercy, is here at best marginal. Similarly, one must feel that in English the use of the word " Compassionate " to render rahlm is misplaced, and too anthropomorphic for the taste of classical Muslim exegetes: the author shows that when applied to God hallm, according to the commentators, does not mean "gentle", as thought by orientalists, but rather "not hastening to punish". God's love for men just means wishing them well, not romantic emotion, and his benevolence excludes any gushing expression of pity. The God of the Muslim theologians, then, is one of rigour, and it must be said that, for all their faults, they operate within a discipline of strict rules and firm internal logic. That this discipline could not develop into something more impressive is doubtless due to the nature and orientation of Islam itself: the religion has had to look back to the sources of law and mystical experience, not forward to a new theological system. Sophistication of belief could come only in Sufism, Shi'ism and philosophy. Thus the value of Gimaret's book lies chiefly in its evocation of the limits of Islamic theology, but it also provides the Islamicist (and in particular the translator) with an indispensable reference tool.
