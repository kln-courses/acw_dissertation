<plain_text><page sequence="1">MYCENAEAN SEMINAR 2000-01 18th October 2000 The Laconia Rural Sites Project Bill Cavanagh and Chris Mee Intensive surveys have identified hundreds of rural sites. Although more common in some periods than others, they have been a feature of the Greek landscape since at least the end of the Neolithic. The assumption is that these sites were isolated farmsteads; but can we be certain that they were in fact occupied and were not simply storehouses or shelters? Were they occupied continuously or only when the agricultural cycle made residence in the countryside more convenient? Texts and inscriptions provide some information about the function of rural sites in the Classical-Hellenistic and Roman periods. Ethnographic evidence has also been utilised, in particular by Todd Whitelaw, who has undertaken a detailed analysis of recent settlement and land use on Keos. Nevertheless, we felt that it would be useful to investigate the surface characteristics of rural sites as rigorously as possible and thereby resolve, or at least redefine, some of the questions about their function. In the first phase of the project, we revisited approximately sixty of the sites identified by the Laconia Survey. These were single period sites, in most cases less than 2500 m2. We then selected twenty which seemed suitable for intensive survey. The range of periods represented is: Early Helladic (2), Middle/Late Helladic (2), Archaic (1), Classical (4), Hellenistic (3), Roman (6) and Byzantine (2). The sites were investigated in 1993-94 and there was a study season in 1995. A 5 by 5 m grid of squares was laid out across the whole of each site. The members of the survey team first counted the number of artefacts along transects which crossed the site and its periphery. Then every artefact was collected from each of the squares. Tile was sorted by type of decoration and thickness, weighed and recorded, and then discarded on site. Sherds, stone artefacts and other finds were taken away to be cleaned, marked, drawn and recorded on our database. This enables us to generate density maps for the different types of artefact, so that we can see whether there is a correlation in the distribution of sherd and tile, for instance. In order to identify possible sub-surface features, Neil Brodie undertook a geophysical survey of every site. A gradiometer was used to detect local variations in the magnetic field. Soil resistivity was measured on a resistance meter. The high temperatures did affect the instruments and the fact that the soil was so dry impeded the use of the resistivity meter. Nevertheless, features have been identified on over half of the sites. Peter James has assessed the likely impact of erosion and deposition on the sites, and has sampled soils for analysis of selected elements and mineral magnetic properties. The aim is to determine any spatial BICS-45 - 2001 169</page><page sequence="2">170 BICS-45 - 2001 relationships between soil properties and artefacts, and to consider whether the present soil properties may reflect past human activities associated with each site. It is through the integration of these different approaches that we hope to understand how these rural sites functioned and this paper focused on the conclusions which we have drawn about the exploitation of the landscape in the prehistoric and Archaic-Classical periods.</page><page sequence="3">MYCENAEAN SUMMARIES 2000-01 171 9" November 2000 SPECIAL LECTURE Minoans and Mycenaeans at the end of the Bronze Age in Crete: New evidence from the excavation of Halasmenos and Kataleimata Metaxia Tsipopoulou Halasmenos, situated on a 240 m hill near the Ha gorge at the north end of the Ierapetra Isthmus, is being investigated as a synergasia , directed by William Coulson and the author, with Krzysztof Nowicki excavating Kataleimata, a refuge settlement along the edge of the gorge. Unlike Kavousi, Vrokastro and Vasiliki-Kephala, Halasmenos was occupied only in LM UIC Middle, with small scale Protogeometric reoccupation* easily distinguished stratigraphically. Proximity to land and sea routes, easy access to water and the fertile plain suggest its importance, as does its size. The excellent state of preservation permits identification of room function and spatial relationships. A small tholos tomb, 200 m south of the settlement, indicates the location of the cemetery. The settlement consists of three areas: Alpha and Beta on either side of the highest point of the hill (excavated area 1500 m2) and Gamma on the lower plateau. The unexcavated part of the site probably extends a further 1000 m2. In Gamma a shrine with megaroid plan (5.5 X 13 m), containing 'Goddesses with Upraised Arms', was partially excavated in 2000. In Alpha three megara, parallel to each other, were discovered. Only the larger structure (5.5 X 13.5 m) was completely excavated: it has two phases. It is separated from the rest of the sector by a road, has a plateia in front and its entrance to the east. A horizontal cross-wall divides it internally: in one part there is a single column base, in the second two bases. The megaron was found empty (except for a silver ring), having been cleared before being succeeded by a similar but smaller PG building with the same orientation. This second megaron has one 4.5 x 3.5 m room and an ante-room. Again there were no significant finds. Area Beta was abandoned when it was in use and a tholos tomb constructed in one of the rooms. During the first phase of the settlement all of Beta probably served for food preparation and storage. In B5 several tripod cooking pots were found, each with a capacity of 13 litres, too large for a single household. It is tempting to suggest that 'communal meals' prepared there were consumed in the megaron. Alpha and Beta yielded three domestic cult deposits, including several clay animals, one female Psi-type figurine, a male figurine of lead and burnt pottery. Halasmenos was inhabited by a fair-sized community, engaged in agriculture and animal husbandry. Faunai remains include goats, sheep, pigs and cattle. Grape is the most important botanical find. A large proportion of the pottery (only 8% decorated) consists of pithoi, pithoid jars, tripod cooking pots, basins, cups and deep bowls. A potter's wheel suggests local production. The shrine is located at the edge of the settlement. Many objects including 'snake tubes', pinakes with 'horns' and kalathoi had fallen from benches. There seem to be at least six figures. Unlike other shrines, it contained two pithoi, but no pottery of types found in the settlement.</page><page sequence="4">172 BICS-45 - 2001 Kataleimata consists of three separate rock shelves. House C, similar to those at Halasmenos, is partly excavated. Pithoi indicate long-term occupation. MM II and LM UIC finds were substantial. Nowicki suggests that Kataleimata antedates Halasmenos and the latter was established once danger had passed. The project offers interesting new evidence for the degree of 'mycenaeanisation' of Crete at the end of the Bronze Age: Ethnic origin. The people who founded Kataleimata were probably local; the choice shows good knowledge of the area. The term 'locals' designates inhabitants of the area in LM HIB, probably including people from the mainland. Architecture and town-planning. Karphi offers a good parallel. Both sites include two different house plans: one irregular and agglomerative, similar to earlier Minoan houses, the second rectangular, even megaroid. Unexcavated sites show that this mixture of architectural patterns was common. Although these could relate to different ethnic groups, it is not easy to suggest that the megara were built by Mycenaeaiis. Some Cretans must have come into contact with them in more 'mycenaeanised' coastal areas. Large LM IIIC settlements could have been founded by people from Mallia and Gournia, which show strong Mycenaean influence. Eating and dressing. Cooking wares and loomweights are particularly useful cultural indicators. Most of the cooking pots were Minoan in type (e.g. tripods and trays) and only a few Mycenaean (cooking amphorae). Was their diet and cooking similar to their ancestors? How did their eating habits and ingredients compare to those of the contemporary mainland? Were the Mycenaean-type cooking vessels used for the same foods in Crete? As for loomweights, most are of mainland type, previously unknown on Crete. Finds also include one of the largest known Cretan fibulae, as well as bronze rings of Helladic type. We therefore suggest that influence of the prevailing Mycenaean culture was strongly felt, independent of the ethnic origin of the inhabitants in these mountainous settlements.</page><page sequence="5">MYCENAEAN SUMMARIES 2000-01 173 15th November 2000 Tholos Tomb E at Archanes-Phourni and its implications for the study of pre-palatial and proto-palatial Crete1 Diamantis Panagiotopoulos Although the vast majority of Minoan tholoi display a history of use as long as several centuries, in nearly all cases their excavation has yielded unstratified deposits. As a result, this extremely long time period has proved difficult to subdivide chronologically. Consequently tholos E at Archanes-Phourni assumes special significance. Its excavation revealed two distinct burial strata: a lower EM IIA level containing the remains of an extensive clearing operation, sealed by a thin layer of fine white soil; and an upper MM IA- IIB level, with burials on the earth, as well as within 32 larnakes and two pithoi. The tomb's stratigraphy revealed that the clearance of the old interments followed a EM IIB-III interruption in its use. A corresponding stratigraphical situation was observed in tholos IIA at Lebena-Yerokambos. In turn, these cases seem to indicate that similar clearing operations at Platanos A, Marathokephalo, Drakones A and Vorou I must be related to an hiatus in occupation, and - if we extrapolate from this argument - perhaps point to cultural discontinuity in south-central Crete during EM III. The finds in the lower level can be regarded as the first well-dated burial context for EM ILA, a period which hitherto had been defined only on settlements. This deposit yielded, apart from ceramic finds, a group of approximately 120 small objects of gold, bronze, hippopotamus ivory, bone, soft stones, obsidian, flint and clay. They form a typical burial assemblage of a Minoan tholos, including eight seals-, 20 bone amulets, a handful of stone beads, two fragments of gold bands, a gold bead, two small stone vases, and one figurine. In several cases, the finds from tholos E represent the earliest securely dated examples of their classes. The occurrence of materials such as gold and hippopotamus ivory and influences from neighbouring regions of the Aegean and even Egypt clearly shows that during EM IIA Cretan centres underwent substantial economic and cultural development, which was obviously stimulated by their active involvement in an international exchange network. The upper level assemblage included, apart from pottery, around 140 small objects. These included stone vases, seals, necklaces and beads, amulets, two pins and a scraper. The secure dating of the tomb's destruction at the end of MM IIB (in Knossian terms) provides a terminus ante quem for several items whose earliest appearance on Crete has hitherto been ill dated. These include a footed larnax, a necklace of amethyst beads, a seal ring, two cylinder seals with 'architectural' ornament and two cushion-shaped seals. A larnax fragment bearing a Linear A inscription (ARKH Zc 8) can be regarded as the most extraordinary find in tholos E, indicating that script may have played a role in Minoan burial ritual. The systematic study of mortuary practices in tholos E was hampered by the poor state of preservation of the skeletal material. It was, however, possible to observe that burial was a 1 This paper summarises aspects of my PhD dissertation submitted to the University of Heidelberg in 1996. 1 owe my greatest debt to Yannis and Efi Sakellarakis for granting me publication rights for Tholos E and for supporting me enormously during my research.</page><page sequence="6">174 BICS-45 - 2001 two-stage process, involving the initial interment of the corpse and the secondary burial of the skull and eventually the long bones. From the regular practice of secondary burial, it becomes evident that the finds in a Minoan tholos tomb represent only a few years in long history of the monument. Hence, previous attempts to define the social unit using the tomb from the number of skulls, or from individual grave-goods, such as seals, daggers or even clay vases, are based on an unrepresentative sample and, consequently, bear no methodological validity.</page><page sequence="7">MYCENAEAN SUMMARIES 2000-01 175 29th November 2000 Ritual action in Mycenaean religion1 Robin Hägg When I came to choose a topic for this paper, I was tempted to try to analyse the rituals of the Mycenaeans, based on the hypothesis that it would be possible to establish a kind of 'ritual syntax'. This is something that has been attempted for other religions, but not for the Mycenaeans. However, since I remained sceptical as to the validity of this analogy between language and ritual, in the end I decided simply to look for combinations and sequences of expressions of Mycenaean ritual behaviour, to the extent this is possible at all, in view of the uneven quality of evidence at our disposal (be it archaeological, iconographical, or epigraphical). It should be stressed that this is very much 'work in progress' and that the results are of a provisional nature. The procession is often, if not always, the ritual that comes first in the temporal sequence of events in a Mycenaean religious festival. It can be defined as the ritual movement of a number of participants through a given space, from a starting point to a goal. According to Fritz Graf, Greek processions can be centripetal or centrifugal; to this should be added a third type, which returns to the starting point: the cyclical. The evidence for Mycenaean processions is first of all iconographical and consists of the well-known frescoes of women from Tiryns and Thebes; to these can be added Early Mycenaean gold rings, showing a procession approaching a sanctuary. In addition there are the frescoes from the vestibule and throne room of the Palace of Nestor at Pylos, where a huge bull (a sacrificial victim?) is brought into the megaron. A few small terracotta models apparently depicting palanquins or sedan chairs may shed further light on processions and the transporting of important persons - e.g. priests and priestesses - to the sanctuary. The pictorial record frequently shows figures carrying objects as gifts or as cult paraphernalia. In this respect, the attractive suggestion by Anna Sacconi is worth citing, namely that Tn 316 (the well-known and much discussed tablet from Pylos) constitutes an inventory for equipment used in such a procession. There are strong indications that figures and figurines may also have been carried in processions. This is what may lie behind the term te-o-po-ri-ja , theophoria, 'the carrying of gods', on two Linear B texts from Knossos and what may also be depicted on two, very fragmentary frescoes from the Argolid. One of these fragments comes from the old excavations at Tiryns and depicts a hand facing right, clasped around an object that is difficult to interpret. The piece has been reinterpreted by Christos Boulotis, who suggests that the mysterious object is a female figurine with a cylindrical skirt, carried on a pole inserted into the cylinder. This idea could be supported by a remarkable anthropomorphic vase from Mycenae, found, published and discussed by George Mylonas. This vase has a hole (Diam. 5 cm) in its base, 1 Aspects of this theme have been treated in: R. Hägg, 'Ritual in Mycenaean Greece', in F. Graf (ed.), Ansichten griechischer Rituale.

Mylonas concluded that the vase must have been carried on a pole inserted into the hole, and suggested the same use also for the large monochrome figures found in the Temple of the Cult Centre. In whatever way all these terracotta figures were carried, whether on sticks or not, it is most likely that the procession was of the cyclical type, i.e. starting and ending at the same point, the sanctuary, and traversing the space of the community (more or less like the Good Friday epitaphios procession of the Orthodox Church). Such a procession for the display of sacred symbols, offerings and valuable cult paraphernalia can be seen as fulfilling a special function when existing cult buildings are extremely small and accessible to only a few privileged cult participants. The remainder of the paper dealt with the following rituals: gift-giving, bloodless offerings, libation and animal sacrifice.</page><page sequence="9">MYCENAEAN SUMMARIES 2000-01 177 17th January 2001 Landscape and space at Akrotiri: issues of landscape in the Miniature Frieze from Thera Elinor Ribeiro This paper seeks to provide a new assessment of the Miniature Frieze of the West House, Akrotiri. The frieze is often interpreted in literal terms, and generally viewed as the depiction of a continuous narrative, whether that narrative illustrates extant Minoan poetry, an actual sea voyage to distanct regions, a sea battle, or a peaceful maritime festival. This paper finds such interpretations, which rest upon a narrative analysis of the frieze, rather unreliable, for a number of reasons, and therefore suggests a new 'way of viewing' the fresco, which avoids narrative speculations. The frieze is assessed as an articulation of an ideological landscape, as seen from the point of view of the local elite. Theories of landscape are investigated and explained with application to the frieze. The possibility that two-dimensional, landscape paintings might also function effectively as political landscapes is explored. Two non- Aegean artworks are employed as relevant artistic and historical comparisons, in order to place the landscape of the Miniature Frieze into a generic context. The first of these, an anonymous 18th century AD depiction of haymaking in England, is used to show how a painted landscape might effectively lay claim to land and local resources, and that such a landscape may be manipulated to state that the patronage and rule of the few benefits the many. The second non- Aegean artwork to be discussed is the fresco from the Palazzo Publico in Siena, painted by Ambroggio Lorenzetti. It bears a strong resemblance to the Miniature Frieze in terms of political statement, and in the profitable deployment of every level of human society in appropriate activities and roles. It is argued that, in the same way, the Miniature Frieze depicts an ideological landscape, which distributes human figures from all levels of society into demarcated regions, or zones, of activity. This idealised and industrious view of society is one taken from the top of the social hierarchy, and was deliberately created to legitimise and enhance the ruling elite's role and position.</page><page sequence="10">178 BICS-45 - 2001 14th February 2001 A mortuary approach to cultural interaction and political dynamics on Late Minoan II-IIIB Crete Laura Preston The funerary sphere provides an ideal medium for exploring the cultural and political developments of LM II-III Crete for two reasons. First, burial data constitute a substantial proportion of our archaeological evidence for this context, by contrast with the settlement evidence, which is currently very limited outside the central sites. The published tomb material not only complements the evidence from these centres, but also provides our main window onto the larger population that dwelt beyond them. Second, and more importantly, it was the main contention of this paper that changes in the mortuary sphere were closely linked with the broader cultural and political dynamics of post neo-palatial Crete. The innovative burial practices introduced in LM II and subsequently established within the island's cultural environment were less concerned with ethnic identity, of which they are frequently viewed as a passive indicator, than with status competition within an unstable political environment. The analysis was structured into three parts. The first highlighted problems with approaching the tombs as ethnic emblems in the culture historical sense. It called for a more sophisticated approach to reconstructing ethnic identities from the material record, and advocated, on both theoretical and empirical grounds, the consideration of alternative explanations for the LM II introduction of innovative tomb customs than simply invasion. The second section explored the Knossian data specifically, as the first centre at which these innovations appeared. It was proposed that the evidence for experimentation and ostentation exhibited in the LM II tombs argues against mainland invasion being the only plausible explanation for their appearance at this particular centre at this particular time. Indeed, the tombs appear rather to represent active strategies for status assertion in reaction to the LM IB political crisis that had destabilised both the previous social and political structures of Crete and the high status ideology that had underpinned them. A diachronic analysis of developments in Knossian mortuary customs from LM II to LM IIIB was then set out. It was argued that although the use of tombs as a forum for status assertion continued into LM IIIA1, mortuary symbolism now became more standardised, and the resources devoted to tomb architecture and assemblages became less extravagant. LM IIIA2 saw a further decline in mortuary expenditure, and this trend continued to the point of the virtual cessation of tomb use by the end of LM IIIB. In the third part of the paper, the wider Cretan evidence was addressed. It was observed that while there is limited evidence for the take-up elsewhere on Final Palatial Crete of the tomb customs embraced at Knossos, these ideas were not disseminated on a significant scale before LM IIIA2. It was argued that this latter horizon was intimately connected with the collapse of Knossos at this point, which occasioned a political restructuring wherein resurgent elites at other centres seized the opportunity to redefine their powers. To this end, one of the strategies deployed was ostentatious tomb use, as attested by the high status</page><page sequence="11">MYCENAEAN SUMMARIES 2000-01 179 cemeteries of Archanes-Phourni, Kalyvia and Ayia Triada. This strategy was probably inspired by Final Palatial Knossian precedents, rather than by mainland intervention. Indeed, by LM IIIA2 the tomb types embraced across Crete were probably no longer considered to carry specifically mainland associations, but had by now been internalised through their establishment at Knossos. In terms of political organisation, it appears that the former second-order sites prospered in the post-palatial phase as regional, independent centres. However, the mortuary evidence also hints at a more fragmented and complex political landscape than is currently apparent from the settlement data. The several corbel-vaulted tombs not associable with known centres, as well as the common occurrence of wealthy assemblages beyond the elite cemeteries highlighted above, suggest that the political landscape included other centres as yet unknown, or simply localised elites within or between the territories of the main regional polities. Finally, it was observed that there is also evidence for a temporal shift in high status tomb use within the post-palatial period. While mortuary ostentation in the centre and mid west of Crete all but ceases in LM HIB, this was the point at which it seems to have commenced in the far west, in the form of the Stylos and Maleme tombs. This intriguing suggestion of a further shift in the island's political balance deserves further investigation, especially through a more detailed understanding of the internal structure and dynamics of the Chania region.</page><page sequence="12">180 BICS-45 - 2001 28th February 2001 INSTITUTE OF CLASSICAL STUDIES - BRITISH SCHOOL AT ATHENS ANNUAL SPRING LECTURE The Mycenaean Acropolis of Midea: A third palatial centre in the Argolid? Katie Demakopoulou Excavations on the acropolis of Midea, begun in 1983 as a Greek-Swedish undertaking, have revealed that it was the third most important site in the Mycenaean Argolid, an administrative centre with craft industries. The fortified acropolis itself with its many significant finds, comparable to those from Mycenae and Tiryns, suggests that Midea was a centre of wealth and power, having an important role in the control and defence of the fertile Argive plain. The excavations have concentrated on the lower parts of the fortified area in two sections: the Greek sector in the West Gate area and on the Southwest Slope, and the Swedish sector in the East Gate area and on the Lower Northeastern Terraces. The West Gate and a number of buildings inside the acropolis have been uncovered. Most structures belong to LH IIIB2 and very few to the post-palatial LH IIIC period, though unstratified finds and some sporadic architectural remains show that Midea was already important during MH III - LH I and the Early Mycenaean period. Over the entire site evidence for a great destruction by earthquake and an accompanying fire, at around the end of the 13th century BC, has been found. In the Greek Sector the West Gate was completely uncovered with a spacious gateway and a guard-room protected by a massive bastion. The destruction layer, which covered the floors of the guard-room and gateway, contained a much painted, plain and coarseware pottery, dating to LH IIIB2. Other finds included stone tripod mortars and lead vessels, millstones and pounders, stone and bronze tools, terracotta drainage tiles and roof tiles, clay figurines and large quantities of carbonised figs, olives and grain. Also found were many fragments of a fresco, which probably decorated the upper walls of the gateway. Inside the Gate, along the fortification wall and under deep levels of wash, a clear fill deposit was found, reaching the foundation trench on bedrock. Most of the pottery is dated LH IIIB2. Significant finds included a large fragment from a LM I amethyst rhyton in the shape of a triton; sealstones, including one depicting a 'minotaur'; a steatite mould for producing gold and glass ornaments; and pieces of fluorite and mother-of-pearl, as well as bronze and bone tools. To the west of the Gate a large building complex came to light, constructed against the fortification wall on several successive terraces. Eleven rooms were uncovered, forming two wings separated by a central corridor with a built drain running through it. Firm stratigraphical evidence exists for a fierce fire caused by the earthquake and for the collapse of an upper floor. The decorated pottery included Group A and B deep bowls, rosette bowls and stemmed bowls, kraters, pattern narrow-necked jugs, globular stirrup jars, spouted conical bowls, small bowls with interior patterns in added white paint, and alabastra. Noteworthy are vase fragments and sherds with pictorial decoration. Common among the</page><page sequence="13">MYCENAEAN SUMMARIES 2000-01 181 plain pottery are two-handled kylikes, one-handled carinated kylikes, dippers, conical angular bowls, and askoi. The coarseware pottery includes numerous storage and cooking vessels. The many storage stirrup jars (often with stylised octopods) reveal that Midea participated in the active exchange of oil and wine carried out between Crete and the mainland. Two bear Linear B inscriptions, one with the Cretan name wi-na-jo. A clay nodule was also found, bearing a seal impression and the Linear B ideogram GRA (wheat). The rooms of this complex, probably comprising storerooms and workshops, also yielded many large lead vessels, stone tripod mortars, millstones and bronze and stone tools. Other finds include fragments of painted plaster, ivories and clay figurines (both human and animal). Especially noteworthy is a large terracotta wheel-made female figure, belonging to the category believed to represent deities and to function as cult images. Together with other material of a cultic nature, this suggests the existence of a cult building in Midea, as at Mycenae and Tiryns. On the Southwest Slope of the Acropolis, the architectural remains showed signs of the same catastrophe, caused by the earthquake and conflagration. A great quantity of LH HIB 2 pottery was recovered from the destruction layers. Also found were a stone spouted mortar, millstones, fragments of lead vessels and stone tools. In this area, an earlier phase, of habitation was identified, dating to the 15th century BC. A large amount of LH IIA-B pottery was retrieved, including a fragment of a Marine Style vase. In addition a cist grave with a child burial, dating to the Shaft Grave period, came to light. The grave goods included a yellow Minyan rim-handled jar and two ivory knobs from a wooden box, now lost. While continuing excavations at Midea are certain to shed further light on the history of the site, its importance is already apparent, proving beyond doubt that this was indeed the third palatial centre of the Argolid.</page><page sequence="14">182 BICS-45 - 2001 14th March 2001 Factions and the origins of leadership and identity in Mycenaean society James Wright Many archaeologists have criticised the application of the model of chiefdom for interpreting the rise of complex societies. Although chiefdoms have been postulated for prehistoric societies in the Aegean» in the case of the Greek mainland during the 2nd millennium BCE, the model is in-and-of-itself insufficient to account for much of the archaeological record in the Middle Helladic phase. Consequently, any pursuit of the origins of Mycenaean society is in need of ah explanatory framework that is more sophisticated than the mere recognition of 'elites'. Following upon the work of Brümfiel and others I propose the concept of 'factions' be employed and explored in the context of the archaeological histories of tribal communities. The operation of factions accounts for the variability in the archaeological record of the MH and early LH phases. A primary strength of the model is the light it sheds on the origins of leadership, especially as it emerges from settings where rank may be recognised, but where stratification has not yet been established. Leadership of factions involves internal and external factors, the former concerning intra- community relations and the latter involving the manipulation of external resources for the benefit of the leader and the faction. This aspect of factions is of great consequence for studying settlement in Greece during the MH period, for it clarifies the dynamic relationship between settlements on the mainland and those of the islands and on Crete. As Maran and Broodbank have recently demonstrated, during the late Early and Middle Bronze Ages the islands of the Aegean controlled access to the mainland and actively participated in the expansion of Minoan interests throughout this period. Thus they selectively stimulated certain settlements and regions of the mainland, and it was at these places where aggrandising leaders seized the opportunity to try to consolidate their power over their groups and their access to external resources. In her s{udy of the shaft grave from Aigina, Kilian-Dirlmeier has collected evidence of early MH high status burials, but has not situated them within the dynamic processes that led to the more elaborate burials of the end of the period. In this study I explore the context of these and other burials using Lerna, Asine, and Argos as case studies. I demonstrate that the rank distinctions began before the advent of the monumental tombs studied by Kilian- Dirlmeier. I show that divisions emerged within these communities that correspond to the emergence of factions and explain how factional leaders competed with each other for resources in both the wider region of the Argolid as well as overseas. The interaction among the aggrandising factional leaders left archaeological traces of the emergence of identity markers. These originate as the status items of a warrior elite, emphasising hunting and warfare, the acquisition of exotic and external markers of wealth, and vessels for drinking. With the advent of chiefs these become standard emblems of a warrior society through the Greek mainland. Finally, with the establishment of the palaces these identity markers form an iconography of power, painted on frescoes and pottery, and represented in other media.</page><page sequence="15">MYCENAEAN SUMMARIES 2000-01 183 14th March 2001 The rise of Mycenae: political inter-relations and archaeological evidence Sophia Voutsaki The accumulation of wealth in the Shaft Graves at Mycenae still remains a central question of Aegean archaeology. Recent explanations have attributed the rise of Mycenae to factors such as its strategic location, access to special resources, or to the production potential of the Argive plain. These theories, however, cannot explain why Mycenae became important at a specific moment, probably at the end of the Middle Bronze Age, nor can they explain why it was Mycenae rather than, for instance, Argos that became the main centre in the plain. I would like to argue that the rise of Mycenae is part of a complex process of political change that cannot be attributed to one or two isolated factors. In order to reconstruct Mycenae's ascent to power, I analysed the MH mortuary evidence from the Argolid. It is well known that MH burials, especially those of the earlier phases, are poor. Even so, a certain concentration of simple ornaments and weapons can be seen in MH I-II Lerna and Asine and to a lesser extent in Argos. Such items have not been found (so far) in any of the sites on the eastern side of the plain, i.e. Mycenae, Tiryns or Dendra. In MH HI- LM I this pattern is reversed: while a few moderately rich graves can be found in Argos, Asine and Lerna, these cannot in any way be compared with the Shaft Graves. If these observations are correct (and of course the problems of preservation and uneven publication need to be taken into account), this implies that Mycenae was relatively unimportant in MH I-II, and that it rose in importance suddenly in MH III. It is interesting that during the Mycenaean period we see a growing divergence between the two parts of the plain, with the eastern side (around Mycenae, Tiryns, Dendra) showing a high concentration of rich and monumental tombs, and the western side (around Argos and Lerna) becoming progressively poorer. The rise of Mycenae is, therefore, revealed as the result of intense competition (possibly involving actual warfare) between whole constellations of sites either side of the Argive plain. The analysis of the burial data leads to some reflections about the nature of social relations in MH I-II. The Argive data do not really confirm the picture of MH society drawn by Imma Kilian-Dirlmeier in her publication of the built tomb in Aigina. None of the MH I-II graves is particularly rich or large and none could be described as a hervorgehobene Bestattung (elite burial). Therefore, rigid social divisions cannot be detected in the MH I-II Argolid. The gold band found in a small grave in tumulus IQ in Asine might imply that differentiation is already gestating in MH II, but clear differences in burials can be attested only from MH III onwards. The lack of differentiation in MH I-II cannot be attributed to poverty. An analysis of the distribution of items such as boar's tusks, imported Kamares Ware and stone vases reveals that they are found more often in domestic than burial contexts. This implies that more wealth was circulating in the MH mainland than we have hitherto thought. The fact that these more valuable items were not deposited in graves may tell us something about MH social structure. I suggest that the main organisational principle in the MH I-II period was kin rather than</page><page sequence="16">184 BICS-45 - 2001 status; that as authority was embedded in kin relations, it did not require ostentatious gestures or rich graves for its legitimation. The situation clearly changed in MH III with the influx of luxury items and the increasing integration of the mainland in Aegean gift exchange networks. The precise position of Mycenae in these networks is difficult to establish. Economic considerations, i.e. the quest for specific resources, cannot give an adequate answer to this question, as gift exchange has a primarily political and diplomatic function. I would like to propose, therefore, that the wealth of Mycenae should be explained as a result of the initiation of diplomatic relations between Mycenae and an important external power, most likely the Minoan New Palaces, and possibly Knossos itself. The Minoan palaces would gain by this diplomatic activity by expanding their sphere of influence and perhaps by securing peace and influence in a strategic area. To sum up the main points: the wealth of Mycenae can only be adequately explained if placed within the processes of internal competition, but also against the expanding cultural horizons and shifting political alliances in the Aegean as a whole.</page><page sequence="17">MYCENAEAN SUMMARIES 2000-01 185 9th May 2001 Symbolic exchange in Cretan peak sanctuary ritual1 Marika Zeimbekis Despite our sparse understanding of social relations and forms of social integration in Bronze Age Crete (particularly in contexts of pre- and early state society), the material culture of peak sanctuary cult remains an untapped source of information on socialisation. This paper is concerned with how these sites' animal and human votive figures might afford an insight into the social relevance of the ritual practices and symbolic content of this cult. The ritual demarcation of the landscape with peak sanctuaries (which began in EM II and became more widely established by MM I) has traditionally been linked to changes in the exploitation of land and animals, namely the systematic use of upland pastures due to an increase in specialised ovicaprid breeding. The animal figure assemblages from Juktas, Kophinas, Atsipadhes (and apparently other sites too) show an under-representation of sheep figures and a surprising prominence of bovine figures, raising doubts as to whether this potential trend can be ascribed to localised strategies of cattle breeding. By extension, the assumption that animal figuration has an identifiable subject matter referring directly to the economic exploitation or ritual function of animals might be misconceived. In order to gain a fuller understanding of the symbolic relations negotiated at peak sanctuaries, it is necessary to investigate how changes in the exploitation and management of the landscape and animals were linked with transformations in the relations between persons and animals, and between persons. It is argued that these relations, affected by an increased emphasis on animal ownership and territorial definition, are commensurate with the emergence of social complexity. Within communities, the exploitation of the outfield would have consolidated relations of inequality and dependence, since cattle used for ploughing would have belonged to the elite. Also, staking claim to upland pastures for the grazing of flocks of ovicaprids would have resulted in the negotiation of such activities between communities. Peak sanctuary ritual engendered a new form of ritual, and potentially, social grouping in locations where these and other interactions within and between communities would have been sanctioned. An insight might be gained into how the social values and attitudes shared by the participants were negotiated through practices involving the innovative use of a votive currency in symbolic exchange with deities. The projection of the individual through the votive was not restricted to expressing the concerns of the 'psychological' individual nor did it simply refer to his / her daily life; it also permitted the dedicator to project himself / herself in an idealized manner through the manipulation of the votive in an offertory act. As early as MM I-II, when peak sanctuaries were most popular, clay effigies of little economic worth represented dedicators by means of their ritual and biological status, thus 1 This seminar was based on ideas derived from studying the entire assemblage of animal figures from Juktas, Kophinas and preliminary information relating to figurai votives from other sites (e.g. Atsipadhes, Traostalos, Vrysinas). A detailed account of the animal figures from Juktas is nearing completion: The Juktas Peak Sanctuary : the Animal Figurines and Figures (Archaeological Society of Athens). See also, 'The organisation of votive production and distribution in the peak sanctuaries of state society Crete: a perspective offered by the Juktas animal figures', in Knossos: Palace, City, State (BSA Studies forthcoming).</page><page sequence="18">186 BICS-45 - 2001 projecting integrative values shared by the entire community. However these same effigies also feature attributes of wealth like fine clothing and elaborate jewellery, or attributes of social standing like daggers. These offerings served as social levellers by permitting the dedicator to appropriate (through the figuration) normally inaccessible markers of economic status and social rank. The frequently deposited bovine figures would have functioned similarly because, although alluding to relations predicated on unequal access to wealth and power, they associated the humble dedicators with a species which they could not have possessed, or used. in ritual or social exchanges. The visual aspect aside, the attribute of scale is an under-used index of how individual and group identity is projected through animal figuration. It is suggested that from peak sanctuary to peak sanctuary different norms dictated the manner in which the group identity of participants was reinforced through the use of animal figures. In the case of Juktas, the figures evidenced egalitarian access through MM I-LM I, whereas in MM III-LM I Kophinas the display potential of the figures was used to indicate the dedicators' ritual / social status. In conclusion, once the social and transactional relevance of the votive currency is established, we may be better equipped to negotiate the elusive meaning of key components in the symbolic content of peak sanctuary ritual. The figuration affords an insight into the components of an early ideology whose content cannot be explained adequately in terms of a folk religion and whose material and symbolic production was generated in the institutional setting of local communities rather than the official sources of religious and political power.</page></plain_text>
