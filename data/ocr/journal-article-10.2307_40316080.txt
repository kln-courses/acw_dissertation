<plain_text><page sequence="1">PHOTOGRAPHS AS ETHNOGRAPHIC DOCUMENTS RONALD L. WEBER Abstract. Three sets of Northwest Coast photographs are examined for their ethnographic contents. Photographs are found to be important research documents, although frequently the sig- nificance of the contents is misjudged. Each set of photographs studied differs in the nature of in- formation communicated. Some are largely dependent on the subject, while others are heavily influenced by the photographer. Both sources can exert control over the content, and it is impor- tant for the anthropologist to interpret the contents with respect to the subject /photographer inter- action. INTRODUCTION Collections of artifacts in natural history museums frequently contain superb examples of art. Pieces that show great innovation, creative composition, and superb craftsmanship are not uncommon. Many pieces are equal or even su- perior to similar pieces exhibited purely as ob- jects of art in the great art institutions. Arti- facts in anthropology museums are, however, primarily valued for what they tell about the people who made and used them and are exhib- ited with respect to their original context and use. If one asks, "is it art?," the anthropology curator answers "yes" or "no" in relation to its place in the culture from which the piece came. For anthropological artifacts, place and time of manufacture, use, and meaning are all impor- tant aids in reconstructing the original context. Other relevant information includes the identity of the maker, the reason for making it, to whom it was given or sold, the material, and signifi- cance of the piece. Phonetic transcriptions of proper names of artifacts are also useful in analysis. This kind of information, as well as some historical and ecological knowledge, helps an anthropologist to understand a peopleTs way of Ufe. Poorly documented pieces can sometimes be studied and compared to other better docu- mented pieces to derive a context , but nothing takes the place of good documentation. Historical photographs can often be used to supplement documentation. The specimens in a single photograph or set of photographs have an association that can be studied by anthropolo- gists to understand interrelationships of people, their culture and artifacts. Photographs in sci- ence museums are considered as documents; their relationship to the actual culture they por- tray is as important as it is with artifacts. In- formation such as the name of the photographer, the date and place of the photograph , and the names of people and artifacts is most important , but interpretation of events or stories about the content is also useful. One must know their context to use photographs or artifacts scien- tifically. A NORTHERN HAIDA (KAIGANI) EXAMPLE Two photographs taken by Winter and Pond, a Juneau firm , at the Kaigani village of Klinkwan , Alaska, c. 1900 (Blackman 1981:62), show a num- ber of artifacts now in the Field Museum* s North- west Coast collection (Figs. 1 and 2). British Columbia's Provincial Museum's records indicate that the photographs were taken before 1901 or 1902 when Figure 3 was taken by C. F. New- combe. Note that in Figure 3, the traditional house to the right and the house pole in front of it have been removed. Flowers and grass in the foreground indicate that at least six months have passed and it is probable that more than a year has passed since the Winter and Pond photographs were taken. Nine individuals are shown as they display masks, blankets, and headdresses. All but two of the people have Ronald L.

Individuals1 names come from information originally provided by Mrs. Helen Sanderson through Margaret B. Blackman in 1971, M. Lawrence in 1975, x and Robert and Nora Cogo in January, 1977. Nora Cogo is a sister to Florence Davidson and daughter of the famous artist, Charles Edenshaw (Blackman 1982:61). The two Winter and Pond photographs were taken minutes apart as the procession moved from right to left along a boardwalk in front of Chief KasawakTs (Gesowwak) or Edwin Scott's house, which was known as Kaad-nass (Kaad-nass-hadai) or Dogfish House (Fig. 3). In March of 1902, Dr. C. F. Newcombe visited Klinkwan where he collected a number of arti- facts from Chief Kasawak, who is shown in the center of the photograph. The Field Museum purchased several of these artifacts from New- combe in 1902. Three other pieces shown in the photograph were acquired by the British Colum- bia Provincial Museum in the 1970s. Still an- other piece is shown in the book, Form and Freedom: A Dialogue on Northwest Coast Indian Art (Holm and Reid 1975) , and is now in the collection of the Glenbow Museum of Calgary, Alberta. Bul Holm, Curator of Northwest Coast Indian Art at the Thomas Burke Memorial Wash- ington State Museum in Seattle, has provided information on the location of the three beaver headdress frontlets shown in the photographs. Two of these are in the Bossom Collection of the National Museum of Canada, and the other is now in the collection of the Museum of Anthropology in Osaka, Japan. The re- maining pieces seen in the photographs have not been located. The specimens in the Field MuseumTs collec- tion are well documented by C. F. Newcombe, but these photographs also add significant in- formation. They authenticate the pieces and show them as they might have been used. Ac- cording to information collected by Margaret Blackman from Mrs. Helen Sanderson, these photographs show "the last traditional doing held at Klinkwan before evacuation of the vil- lage for Hydaburg, Alaska." Other information suggests the procession was staged for the photographer. Nevertheless, significant infor- mation can be acquired with careful study of the photographs. Some understanding of late nineteenth cen- tury Kaigani ceremonial dress is provided by the photographs. Hats and headdresses are se- cured with straps. Chilkat blankets are shown as they were worn draped over the shoulders with fringe hanging down. In personal commu- nications, Peter Macnair of the British Columbia Provincial Museum has noted that the blankets are tied at the level of the clavicle , which is the usual fashion. Frontlet headdresses were worn with Chilkat blankets, and raven rattles were often carried. Chilkat blankets require much labor to make and are , therefore , only used by the highest ranking people (Samuel 1982). How- ever, with European contact and trade, another type of blanket, the button blanket, became popular. Early prototypes of button blankets used abalone and dent alia rather than buttons. The button, dentalia, and abalone shell blanket worn by an unidentified man (F) is possibly a substitute for the more expensive Chilkat blan- ket. 2 The man with this blanket also wears a frontlet headdress like the others. The Chilkat blanket and frontlet headdress are the symbols of chiefs in Northwest Coast culture , and it is Ukely that the three men with Chilkat blankets are chiefs of three of the houses at Klinkwan. Man F , with a button blanket and headdress , may be a fourth chief. Two raven rattles are shown in the photo- graph. The man leading the procession seems to be using one rattle to beat a skin drum. An- other raven rattle is held by Chief Kasawak (D) . Interestingly, these rattles are held in an up- right position which is contrary to the preferred way today (Halpin 1978). It is said that they may fly from one's hand if they are held in the position shown by the photograph (Samuel 1982: 30). Bill Holm believes that there has always been some variation in the way raven rattles were carried, but he notes that in most old photographs they are carried with the bottoms facing upward and outward as they are used to- day but contrary to the way they are seen in these photographs. Another possible interpre- tation is that rattles were carried as seen in the two photographs to indicate that the procession has been staged for the photographer. Peter Macnair has provided further evidence that the photographs were staged. The raven rattle and drum held by the lead man are carried in dif- ferent hands in the two photographs. Macnair believes this switch was made to accommodate the wishes of the photographer. He also believes that the rattle was used to beat the drum only because of the photographer's request; he notes that both the rattle and drum would be subjected to damage if used as shown. Note that the headdresses (2, 11 and 12) and masks (7 and 8) are not worn as one might ex- pect. Instead, they are displayed as objects of wealth. Perhaps they were worn for short in- tervals during a ceremony , but they were prized property as well. There are no eye holes cut in the smaller mask , but the larger xMargaret Blackman has suggested that M. Lawrence may be Emma Lawrence. 2Bill Holm questions this interpretation and notes that button blankets are not thought of as substitutes for Chilkat blankets today .</page><page sequence="6">72 Arctic Anthropology 22:1 one has holes drilled through the orbits. 3 Both masks are well carved with ovoid faces and rela- tively pointed chins characteristic of Haida anthropomorphic masks. Some evidence of the nature of social struc- ture and ranking is shown by the position of individuals. Three men wearing Chilkat blan- kets and frontlet headdresses maintain central positions in both photographs. The unidenti- fied person (F), who wears a frontlet headdress and button blanket, stands behind the others. His apparent lower rank may be related to his younger age. Ben Duncan (H), the youngest person in the photograph, and Matthew Collison (B ) appear to be in the parade to carry and display wealth items. Field Museum records show that several of the pieces they display be- longed to Chief Kasawak whose central position indicates that he is the highest ranking person in the photographs. No women, young children, or old people are seen in either photograph. Their absence may be due to their generally lower rank. Young children have not yet ac- quired high rank while old people probably have passed on their names and positions. The lack of women in the photograph could be ex- plained by the fact that even in a matrilineal society such as the Kaigani, the most powerful positions of leadership remain in male hands. Men were the final authorities of the house- hold and the holders of position of political authority. They alone were the hosts of the most important types of potlatches , the owners of the most important property (houses and totem poles) , the performers of the most prestigious rituals (dances) , the creators and monopolizers of an art form whose symbols represented the matrilineal groups they dominated (Blackman 1982:50- 51). Alternatively, one could speculate that males were most appropriately photographed by the male photographers. Figure 3, which was taken by C. F. New- combe in 1901 or possibly 1902, shows some frame houses on the left, and it was these that were probably being used for everyday pur- poses. Most household activities would have been carried out there. By the time that the two photographs of the procession were taken , the old traditional houses were apparently aban- doned or perhaps used only for ceremonial pur- poses. Traditional Haida society is divided into two exogamous matrilineal moieties, Raven and Eagle. Each of these is subdivided into lineages , and among the Kaigani there are also further sub- divisions of people who traced their origins to named houses or sublineages. Each of the lineages and houses has chiefs, while the high- est ranking chief in any village holds power over the whole village (Swanton 1905:69; Curtis 1916:119; Murdock 1934:237; Blackman 1981:16). Rights to use crests or animal representations are inherited through the matrilineage, but a man may have the rights to display his wives1 crests. Raven crests include the following: killer whale, grizzly bear, blue hawk or thunder- bird , sea lion , rainbow , cumulus and cirrus clouds, rock slide, horned owl, flicker, moon, mountain goat, driftwood, wolf, and raven fin. The skate was shared by both moieties and the dogfish was claimed by the Y^kwa'lanas lineage, although it is usually an Eagle crest. ** Eagle crests include eagle, frog, cormorant, beaver, dogfish , raven , sculpin , halibut , raven killer whale with five fins, starfish, dragonfly, wasco, hummingbird, and small club (Swanton 1905:107- 121) . Klinkwan was largely inhabited by the Yfakwa 'lanas lineage of the Raven moiety. Since moiety exogamy was the rule, women who mar- ried into Klinkwan houses were of the Eagle moiety. Young children of the village might be Eagles, but older children would have been born of women living in other villages (the sisters of the adult men). These young men and older children would have lived in the houses of their mother's brothers from whom they would inherit rights and property. All of the men shown in the two Winter and Pond pho- tographs are probably Ravens of the Y'akwa1- lanas lineage. This lineage was divided into several subdivisions or houses of which four ("Kaad-naas-hadai, Yehl-naas-hadai, Skistlai- nai-hadai, and Na-kaduts-hadaitf) 5 were present at Klinkwan (Hodge 1910 11:985). The special crests of the Y'akwa'lanas were the grizzly bear, dogfish, killer whale, wolf, moon, and raven (Swanton 1905:271). The four men wearing frontlet headdresses are probably chiefs, and they may be the four chiefs of the named houses at Klinkwan. Edwin Scott and Eddie Cogo, the only two chiefs who have been identified , have different English surnames which were passed on through the patriline. Since males receive their lineage rights through their mothers , live with their mother1 s brothers, and yet receive their English 3Both Bill Holm and Peter Macnair have in- dicated that masks without eye holes were often worn in Haida ceremonies. The mask wearer would usually remain in one place when he put the mask before his face. ^akwa'lanas or Middle- town-people is Raven Lineage 19 of Swanton!s list. 5Swanton lists these four subdivisions as Q!à!ad naTas xadàf-i ("dogfish house people"), Sk!ìsLa-i na-i xadà'-i ("people of the house where they always have plenty of food"), Na qèTdAts xàfda-i ("people of the house that went away discouraged") and Yel'na'as xa'da-i ("raven-house people").</page><page sequence="7">Weber: Photographs as Documents 73 surnames through their fathers, it should be expected that adult men of alternate genera- tions with the same surnames would tend to live in different villages. Men living in the same village who have the same surname would prob- ably be brothers and belong to the same lineage. Only one of the brothers (probably the older) could be a chief of a lineage. Therefore, it is predictable that the unidentified chiefs in the photograph will not be close relatives or pos- sess the same English surnames. This seems to be the case with these two photographs. The first two individuals (A and B) are wear- ing fur hats that are sometimes associated with shamans. Men G, H, and I appear in the pro- cession to display wealth items which belonged to Chief Kasawak. Nevertheless, according to British Columbia Provincial Museum documenta- tion, the wooden helmet worn by man H and the staff carried by man I belonged to Mike George (G) (Macnair, personal communication, 1983). According to information collected by M. Lawrence (possibly Emma Lawrence) , the first person (A) is named Robert Edenshaw. Mar- garet Blackman states that this is not the same Robert Edenshaw who was Florence Davidson* s brother (Blackman, personal communication, 1983). A second identification of man A as Donald Mekatla was made by Mr. and Mrs. Cogo in January, 1977, and therefore the true identity of man A cannot be substantiated from the information presently available. Man A is wearing a tunic with two bear heads , a Raven crest, outlined in dentalium with abalone for eyes. This piece is illustrated in Form and Freedom: A Dialogue on Northwest Coast Indian Art (Holm and Reid, 1975:No. 61), and was sold by Sotheby's in 1981 to the Glenbow Museum (Sotheby Parke Bernet Inc. 1981:item 366, 1982:item 434). A fur cap with feather ornamentation, worn by man A, his raven rat- tle, and skin drum have not been identified in museum collections. The rattle is of the type showing a man and a birdTs head (kingfisher) with a single tongue joining their mouths. Rubber boots and European- style shirt and pants are visible signs of white influences. Man B is identified as Matthew Colli son. He wears a robe made of wolfskin with killer whale fins attached (Field Museum No. 79551). Each fin is also a raven's head. This robe probably pertains to the Raven moiety's crest known as Raven Fin, but is not listed as being a Y'akwa'lanas prerogative (Swanton 1905:271). In Figure 1, Collison carries a spring salmon headdress (Field Museum No. 79540). Accord- ing to Field Museum records, both the head- dress and the robe belonged to Chief Kasawak. The fur hat worn by man B is like one worn by man A , and a similar hat with a carved wooden land otter ornament in the Field Museum's col- lections (No. 79564) belonged to a Howkan shaman named Küídsán. The two fur hats in the picture probably also relate to shamanism. Man C is unidentified , but nevertheless he is probably a chief of one of the four Kaigani sub- clans or houses. He wears a Western-style shirt, pants, coat, tie, and leather shoes with a fine Chilkat blanket. His headdress frontlet depicts a moon bird with a circular face partially encir- cled by a crescent moon. This crest is a Y'akwa'lanas prerogative and the wearer is prob- ably a member of the Raven moiety. The frontlet is richly ornamented with abalone. For a discus- sion of this crest, see Alan Hoover's article, "Notes on the Iconography of the Haida Moon" (Hoover 1981:143-152). Man C also carries a fan that is probably made of tail feathers of an adult bald eagle. Man D is Chief Kasawak (Gesowwak) , whose English name is Edwin Scott. He was the chief of the highest ranking Y'akwa'lanas sublineage at Klinkwan and heir to the house of Kaad-naas, which can be seen behind the group and in Figure 3. He probably was the village chief as well. The frontlet on his headdress shows a beaver, which is one of the important crests of the Eagle moiety. Why a Y'akwa'lanas Raven should be wearing an Eagle moiety headdress is unclear . Chief Kasawak wears a shirt , tie , coat , pants , and leather shoes of European make , but also wears a Chilkat blanket and carries a raven rat- tle. On the back of the rattle is a reclining man with a bird's head, probably representing a kingfisher. An animal, probably a frog, seems to be held by the bird's beak, and a tongue joins the mouths of this animal and the man. Chief Kasawak also wears a pair of tanned moose hide leggings with attached puffin beaks (Field Museuip No. 79557). The crest on the leggings is probably a sculpin which is also associated with the Eagle moiety (Swanton 1905:115; Curtis 1916:117: MacDonald 1983:23). It may be that the beaver and sculpin crests relate to Chief Kasawak's wife's lineage, but they do not per- tain to rights held by a Y'akwa'lanas chief. Kasawak did, however, sell these leggings to Newcombe in 1902, though it is possible that he was acting in his wife's behalf. Perhaps he sold them because he lacked rights to use them. Man E, Eddie Cogo, also wears European- style shirt, coat, tie, pants, and rubber boots. He wears another fine Chilkat blanket and ap- pears to be holding another feather fan. His headdress frontlet also depicts a beaver, which would usually indicate his belonging to the Eagle moiety . Unidentified man F appears to be about eighteen years old and yet he is probably a chief. Only his blanket and headdress can be seen. His headdress shows still another beaver while his blanket , ornamented with buttons , dentalia shell, and abalone shell, shows a scul- pin crest. Both the beaver and the sculpin are generally considered to belong to the Eagle</page><page sequence="8">74 Arctic Anthropology 22:1 moiety. It should be noted that this unidentified man is wearing the same crest combination as Chief Kasawak. 6 Man G, Anklleq (Mike George), wears European- style clothing, but over the clothing he wears a caribou skin robe. The robe is painted with a border of red and black formal designs, but no crests can be identified. The front of the robe shows a painted design that represents the braid work of a naval officers coat. The headdress worn by man G is com- posed of two flat pieces of wood with an uniden- tified painted design above a headband of cut feathers (possibly flicker feathers). The pres- ent location of his headdress is not known , but the robe is in the Field Museum's collection (No. 79549). This robe was the property of Chief Kasawak, according to Field Museum records, but two items showing frog crests held by men H and I were AnklleqTs property when they were sold to the British Columbia Provincial Museum (Peter Macnair, personal communication, 1983). Figure H is Gennowwu whose English name was Ben Duncan. He appears to be about 11 or 12 years old in this photograph. He wears a woolen sweater with wide suspenders and a dance apron of commercial blanket material or trade flannel with a leather fringe. His clan hat shows a frog as the most identifiable crest, but below the frog is a wide mouth that resem- bles a sculpin's. These crests are also the prerogative of the Eagle moiety. The clan hat is adorned with three potlatch rings. Gennowwu wears a red cedar bark ring which may indicate that he is presently an initiate to a Haida cere- monial society. He also holds two masks that were the property of Chief Kasawak. The com- bination of crests and paraphernalia owned by both Chief Kasawak and Anklleq is interesting but helps little in understanding Gennowwu's social position. Man I, Nasauk (Adam Spoon's son), wears a striped European- style shirt, pants, and leather shoes. His headdress, with a wooden whale fin (Field Museum No. 79542), belonged to Kasawak. Nasauk also carries a dance leader's staff of yew wood with a frog crest carved at one end (BCPM N. 15163). This staff was the property of Anklleq , according to Provincial Museum records (Macnair, personal communication , 1983) . The killer whale of the headdress per- tains to the YTakwaflanas lineage of the Raven moiety, but the frog crest on the staff relates to the Eagle moiety. Two other headdresses shown in the photo- graph include a raven fin crest (Field Museum No. 79529), and a sockeye salmon (Field Museum No. 79538). Both of these belonged to Chief Kasawak and are now in the Field Museum's collection. The raven fin headdress shows the same Raven moiety crest as the robe worn by Matthew Collison (B) but neither pertains to the Y'akwa'lanas lineage. The totem pole standing in front of Chief Kasawak's house, known as Kaad-naas or Dog- fish House, appears to show a bear with a raven above and a segmented column with a bear cub on top. These are all crests of the Y!akwaf lanas lineage. The dogfish was also one of Chief Kasawak's crests. Two frontlets (not in the photographs) that were purchased from Kasawak by Newcombe show this crest (Field Museum No. 79518 and No. 79519). In conclusion, an expected occurrence of crests associated largely with the Y'akwe'lanas lineage is not present in the photograph. The only pattern that becomes obvious is that items shown are ornamented with crests which are mostly foreign to the lineage. Among the Haida, the beaver, sculpin, and frog are the most com- mon Eagle crests. Of the northern Haida it is most likely that the Stafstas or S^alA'ndas lineages are represented by these crests (Swan- ton 1905:275, 276). One can only suppose that the items used in this procession were those that had little cultural significance to the Y!akw8!lanas. Perhaps they were displayed in order to enhance their sale price. In March of 1902 Newcombe purchased many of the pieces and later sold them to the Field Museum. This sale must have occurred a year or more after the photographs were taken. PHOTOGRAPHS FROM MUSEUM CONTEXTS Another set of photographs taken by Charles Carpenter at the 1903 Louisiana Purchase Expo- sition in St. Louis shows a Kwakiutl man, Charles Nowell, wearing various pieces of Kwakiutl ceremonial paraphernalia used in the HawinalaJ or War Dance (Figs. 4 and 5). The ceremony portrayed a legendary warrior who asked to be hung from the house beam by ropes looped through his skin. The performer used a wooden frame to help support his weight and carried a magical bow that represented the Si'siul, a double-headed serpent (Boas 1897:495). Al- though these pictures were taken in a studio environment, the pieces shown were the proper- ty of the Kwakiutl wearing them and we can, therefore, accept their authenticity. In the exhibit, Maritime Peoples of the Arctic and Northwest Coast, these Carpenter photographs have been used to provide information to the Field Museum visitor on the use of the artifacts shown . According to Bill Holm , frontlets of men E and F are a pair. That worn by F is a copy of the older one worn by E (NMC. No. VII X 1148). In an early version of this paper, I interpreted these frontlets (Nos. 15-17 in the key to Figures 1 and 2) as bears. Bill Holm provided the beaver identification.</page><page sequence="9">Weber: Photographs as Documents 75 CO p CO U o'Sj o co 3 wK C « CO § cu *O jf* +■» ¿ o ü co co o &lt;D CO ^ .2 'O rH K '3 E "S fc o o 2Ü^ ^z&amp; ¡ o U o a co (Ü &gt;&gt; 3 co &lt;ü CO &amp; CU ü C in &lt;D E CO CD ed ft co C in .tí ¿2 m •g 00 55 S co co 'O n.'O e 52 v ^- e § ¡ SS» I g»! 8 É * « *. 5 .2 u o «oí U g&gt; E</page><page sequence="10">76 Arctic Anthropology 22:1 A third type of photograph in the Field Museum collection provides completely erroneous information. A photograph of a Haida mortuary pole (Field Museum No. 79717) from the village of Skedans on the Queen Charlotte Islands shows a large frog (Field Museum No. 79718) resting on its top (Fig. 6). It is not clear as to who was responsible for placing the carved frog on top of the pole, but it is known that the Haida were not the ones responsible. The two pieces originally came from Skedans where they were collected by C. F. Newcombe in 1902. At Skedans, the two pieces functioned differently and were never directly associated. According to Field Museum documentation collected by Newcombe, the frog or toad was placed inside a mortuary house where it supported a coffin of an Eagle moiety chief of the Kona-Kegawai lineage. Later the frog or toad was removed from the house and placed in the open as a monument to the deceased. Newcombe1 s docu- mentation states that the memorial pole was erected originally to receive the remains of Chief Kílgüt7 (possibly Kahligua) of Cumshewa who was of the Stawas-haidagai lineage of the Eagle moiety. The coffin was placed in the niche of the upper part of the pole, and the pole served as a memorial to the chief. The photograph of the two pieces together is a com- pletely erroneous presentation which was proba- bly staged in a museum exhibit. Figure 7 shows the memorial pole where it stood at Skedans. Note that the frog is nowhere near the pole. CONCLUSIONS The photographs of the procession at Klink- wan show a real event with native people using authentic artifacts. This cannot, however, be simply understood as people using their crests in the traditional symbolic way. The influence of the photographers must also be understood. Crests appear to be intentionally scrambled to produce an insignificant parade. The study of the circumstances for this scrambling may, how- ever, permit the researcher to understand variations of crest usage and perhaps allow anthropologists to check the actual usage of crests against the idealized usage. The photograph showing Bob Harris on the apparatus used for suspending a Hawinalal performer is entirely reconstructed, but it is a legitimate reconstruction by reliable informants who had the advantage of being familiar with the ceremony as it was used in the nineteenth century. The final example of the frog memorial and the Eagle burial post appears to be an example of unknowledgeable museum people contriving Figure 6.

The cul- tural significance in this can only reflect the preconceptions of the persons responsible. When photographs are viewed to obtain ethno- graphic data, one must consider each situation separately. Contents may be influenced largely by those who are portrayed, or may represent an interaction between the photog- rapher and the subject, or finally it may be the product of the photographer alone. Various degrees of influence will be in- volved such that each photograph has an underlying significance beyond the pure image. Photographs can date and authenticate pieces, establish associations between pieces, and provide information about the culture of the people shown or the culture of the photographer. It is always important to question the documentation and interpret the significance. Just as written or oral documentation can be incorrectly interpreted , photographs can also be misleading. Used cautiously, however, important information can be obtained from their study. 7C. F.
