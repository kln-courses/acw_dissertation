<plain_text><page sequence="1">IRISH ARCHAEOLOGICAL RESEARCH FORUM II (2), 1975 PETIT-CHASSEUR AND PASSAGE-GRAVES Peter Harbison For over a decade, authors (0 Riordain and Daniel 1964, 153; Byrne 1968, 390; and Raftery 1972, 44) have been alluding to the importance of the Passage-Grave people for subsequent generations in Ireland. It would now seem worthwhile to add substance to the concept of continuity, and in doing so to analyse briefly certain aspects of the Passage-Graves and their relationship to some contemporary cultural features in Switzerland.

It is suggested here that the crescentic feature is a neck ornament rather than a mouth.

Meath, and which he rightly recognised as belonging to the anthropomorphic group of "statue menhirs" (Fig. 1). Hartnett interpreted the lines on it as showing a human figure composed of "eye", "eyebrow" and/or "hair", a "nose" and "mouth" as well as a possible "belt" and "hand" (Hartnett, 1957, 222). But since the discovery of the Fourknocks stele, others have come to light in Switzerland which seem to suggest an alternative interpretation to Hartnett's "mouth" feature. These were found at Petit-Chasseur in Sion/Sitten in the Swiss canton of Valais/Wallis, where they had been put to secondary use in forming the walls of Beaker-period cists, though the original carving on them may go back to the middle of the third millennium B.C. (A. Gallay, 1972; G. Gallay and K Spindler, 1972). Where preserved, the heads on these stelae formed a semi-circle jutting out from the top or 'shoulders' of an otherwise roughly rectangular stone, and they were either left blank or decorated by a number of radiating lines ("hair"?) (Fig. 2). On one fragment (Fig. 3} the head is missing, but a left arm helps to indicate that the stone represents a part of the human body, and in the area below the neck there is a half-moon-shaped crescent which corresponds closely to Hartnett's "mouth" on the Fourknocks stele. On the Petit-Chasseur fragments the crescent is filled out with dots (Fig. 3), 2</page><page sequence="3">triangles (Fig. 4) or a series of lines following the edges of the arcs (Fig. 4 and A. Gallay, 1972, 75 and 79), thus suggesting that it is not a mouth but a neck ornament, imitating one made possibly of leather or metal ? and the same interpretation can probably be applied to the Four knocks stele. In the example shown on Fig. 3, the ends of the arcs are filled out with two lines running concentrically with the arc but not continuing to its centre. This stressing of the ends of 'horns' of the neckband immediately reminds us of the gold lunulae of the earlier part of the Bronze Age. But the fact that most lunulae have the decoration at the 'horns' running at right angles to the sides of the arc, rather than concentrically as is the case at Petit-Chasseur, suggests that there may have been an intermediate stage of development between the Petit-Chasseur models and the Irish gold lunulae which may find its reflection in a Danish gold l?nula (Taylor, 1970, P1. XII). While we can say with a fair degree of certainty that the custom of wearing a crescentic neck ornament which is likely to have been practised by the Passage Grave builders at Fourknocks was one which the Irish of the Earlier Bronze Age found sufficiently attractive for them to continue, we cannot yet say whether the ornament found on the Fourknocks stele was ancestral to the gold lunulae of the Earlier Bronze Age in Ireland, or whether the gold lunulae were modelled on similar prototypes from outside Ireland. 3</page><page sequence="4">Some items born by the figures on the Petit-Chasseur stelae suggest caution in trying to see too close a cultural connection between the Swiss stelae and the Passage-Graves. Prime among these are the objects modelled on those of metal ? daggers and double-spiral pendants (e.g. A. Gallay, 1972, 51) ? the later of which are of eastern European form. In addition, the arrows seen on Fig. 2 have heads of a barbed-and-tanged variety which have not yet been found in association with Passage-Graves in Ireland (compare Herity, 1974, 137 and 145). Nevertheless, there are, on the other hand, some further points of similarity which ought not be overlooked. The torsos of the figures on the Swiss stele are often heavily decorated with geometrical patterns, of which the most important for us are the zigzags, simple or boxed lozenges and dot-filled triangles (Figs:3 and 5). Many examples of zigzags and lozenges which are present on Irish Passage-Graves (Herity, 1974, 104) bear such a close resemblance to the Swiss motifs that it would appear that a range of patterns must have been common to Switzerland and Ireland. In Switzerland, the motifs are found on the clothes of whoever was represented on the stelae, and it is worth while considering the possibility that it may have been through the medium of cloth that some of the angular motifs may have found their way on to the walls of Passage Graves, and whatever meaning they had for the Passage-Grave sculptors may have been a reflection of their symbolism on woven designs. Dotted triangles, of course, occur on a number of decorated bronze axes of the Earlier Bronze Age in Ireland (e.g. Harbison, 1969, P1. 70), and again we must pose the question as to whether such a motif used on neolithic clothing is not the ancestor to the design on the Irish axes, though not necessarily through the mediation of the Passage-Grave builders. It is quite possible that these angular motifs may have been diffused westwards from central Europe, and reached Ireland by way of Brittany where we find them on a few exceptional and atypical Breton Passage-Graves such as Gavrinis and Petit Mont (Lynch 1969). More than 40 years ago, Breuil (1934, 304) pointed out that in his opinion rectangular patterns such as lozenges were late in the 'art' of the Irish Passage-Graves. Perhaps they are elements derived from central Europe which may have been added to and combined with an older series of curvilinear motifs, though it would be difficult to define where such a putative marriage of curve and straight line took place. The method of pocking the motifs into or out of the stone would also appear to be broadly similar in Petit-Chasseur and in Irish Passage-Grave ornament, and there would appear to be a superficial resemblance at least between the radiating lines of the Swiss stele mentioned above (Fig. 2) and those on a stone at Knowth (C. O'Kelly, 1973,*P1. XXXVIII, upper) and on another in Cairn Xa at Loughcrew (Herity, 1974, Fig. 43). One wonders, too, whether it is merely fortuitous or more than pure coincidence that Alpine lake-dwellings in Switzerland were being built at much the same time as crannogs were being introduced into Ireland during the late Neolithi (Davies, 1950)? None of the points discussed above in relation to lunulae or to dot-filled triangles is capable of demonstrating direct influence of Passage-Graves on the Earlier Bronze Age in Ireland, but it can scarcely be denied that the Passage-Graves seem to have had a certain fascination for later generations. In the (naturally very much later) written tradition of ancient Ireland, the Passage Grave cemetery complex comprising Newgrange, Knowth and Dowth was, we know, called Bruig na Boinne. The Bruig was seen as a sid or Otherworld location, with which were connected two supernatural pigs (O'Rahilly, 1946, 122, note 4) ? animals which are known to have played a considerable role in Celtic mythology. It was presided over by Elcmar or Nuadu, and his wife Boand, the divinized river Boyne. Elcmar was tricked by words into handing over the Bruig to his son Mace ind Oc, a hero who may be identifiable with the Dagda, the good god of the Goidels. 4</page><page sequence="5">In this tradition, we may possibly be sensing echoes of a bloodless take-over by a new race or generation of an Otherworld burial place already hallowed by an older one (O'Rahilly, 1946, 516). The same theme could possibly be understood as reverberating in the secondary use of other Passage-Grave mounds for single burials accompanied by Food Vessels in the Earlier Bronze Age (0 Riordain, 1968), and also in the choice of hills dominated by Passage-Graves for the siting of Later Bronze and Iron Age hill-forts (Raftery, 1972, 43f). Passage-Graves were certainly one type of megalithic tomb which attracted the Beaker people when they arrived in Ireland some centuries after the tombs were built. A Beaker battle-axe was found in the Passage-Grave at Sess Kilgreen, Co. Tyrone (Coffey, 1911, 178). At Knowth, coarse Beaker pottery was found in association with some of the satellite tombs (Eogan, 1974, 30 and 61) and M. J. O'Kelly (1973) discovered a whole Beaker settlement nestling at the foot of the mound at Newgrange, though it might be mentioned in passing that the association of Beaker pottery with Passage-Graves is a characteristic found also further south along the Atlantic littoral as far south as Portugal. In the 18th century, a standing stone was still to be seen on top of the mound at Newgrange (O R?ord?in and Daniel, 1964, 33f. though compare C. O'Kelly, 1969, 19), but it is difficult to know when it was placed there or by whom ? the Passage-Grave builders or Beaker people ? Standing stones on the tops of mounds are considered to have been a characteristic of the Indo-Europeans (Gimbutas, 1970, 170), to which linguistic group an increasing number of scholars believe the Beaker Folk to have belonged. The only roughly dateable standing stone in Ireland is that at the Longstone Rath in Co. Kildare which is either Beaker or immediately post Beaker in date, because a bracer ? of a type associated in England if not certainly in Ireland with later Beaker pottery ? was discovered in a burial at the foot of the stone along with undecorated pottery of uncertain affiliations (Macalister, Armstrong and Praeger 1913). Another standing stone stood on a mound at Longstone, Co. Tipperary until it was shattered some years ago by lightning, and excavations are being carried out there at present by Peter Danaher of the National Parks and Monuments Branch of the Office of Public Works. He has kindly informed me that the mound itself has not yet been tackled in its entirety, but a ring-barrow beside the mound has produced what may be rustic Beaker pottery, though it has not yet proved feasible to define the chronological relationship between mound and ring-barrow. But these two Longstones certainly suggest that standing stones were erected at burial sites in the Earlier Bronze Age, so that it is quite possible that the stone which once stood on top of the mound at Newgrange may have been erected by the Beaker People who inhabited the site rather than by the original Passage-Grave builders. Another point of contact between Passage-Graves and the Beaker Folk was demonstrated by the recent discovery of a single Carrowkeel bowl (of a type found in Passage-Graves) in among thousands of sherds of largely undecorated Beaker ware (Sweetman, 1971, 138). The bowl was associated with a cremation burial inside what appears to have been a henge monument. It will be remembered that the Welsh Passage-Grave at Bryn Celli Ddu was built inside a henge (C. O'Kelly, 1969, 17), and the once complete circle of standing stones at Newgrange may represent something similar in function, although it must be admitted in all caution that the chronological and cultural relationship between the stone circle and the Passage-Grave at Newgrange has not yet been established. However, stone circles are known from the Bronze and Iron Ages in Ireland, and we may have at Newgrange one of the earliest examples of a tradition which continued in Ireland for thousands of years. Furthermore, the obvious familiarity of the Passage-Grave builders at Newgrange with the movement of the sun, as seen in the orientation of the tomb towards a point 5</page><page sequence="6">on the horizon where the sun rises on mid-winter day, may be related to the calculations of the movements of certain heavenly bodies which are now considered likely to have been made at some stone circle sites, thus possibly suggesting a certain amount of continuity of knowledge between the Passage-Grave builders and the population of Ireland in the Bronze Age. The race of people who built the Passage-Graves in Ireland presumably lived on to integrate itself at a later stage with newcomers who made Beaker and Food Vessel pottery in the Earlier Bronze Age, and in the course of that integration it would appear to have had a certain amount to contribute to the development of culture as we know it from the Earlier Bronze Age in Ireland.
