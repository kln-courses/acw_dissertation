One might perhaps have expected a little more attention to have been paid to what Koch clearly regards as the rearguard action being fought by conservative scholars. Conservative scholarship is a part of the contem- porary scene, and the objections raised to the findings of critical scholar- ship merit fuller consideration than Koch gives them. But he does not underestimate the difficulties posed by the book of Daniel, and he rightly wishes to make his readers well aware of them. From time to time he points to areas in which further research is needed, and it is important that stress should be laid on the potential significance of such basic research. Unfortunately, insufficient care has been taken over the presentation of the bibliographical material. This would be a defect in any book, but it is an especially serious drawback in a work of this kind. The format of the volume requires that books and articles should be cited by the names of their authors, full bibliographical information being supplied only in the bibliographies. But the bibliographies do not include all the works to which reference is made in the text. Further, full bibliographical informa- tion for some works is given in the body of the text, but not mentioned in the bibliographies as well. It is also not easy to identify all the abbrevia- tions which are used. Thus, greater attention to such details would have resulted in a more satisfactory book. That said, it remains an invaluable tool for anyone who is studying the book of Daniel. Bangor, North Wales B. A. Mastin Carmel McCarthy, The Tiqqune Sopherim and Other Theological Correc- tions in the Masoretic Text of the Old Testament. Orbis Biblicus et Orientalis 36. 280 pp. Universitatsverlag Freiburg, Switzerland, and Vandenhoeck &amp; Ruprecht, G6ttingen, 1981. This is the story of how a family of eighteen theologically motivated emendations in the Hebrew Bible, known as Tiqqune Sopherim (Tiq. Soph. for short), was reduced to three, and of the large-scale operation mounted in order to get into contact with relatives of the survivors living in other parts of the biblical and rabbinic world. As a matter of fact, the family may have numbered five or nineteen, or any number in between-that is one of the problems-and Sr McCarthy acquits herself with distinction in this slightly revised form of her Fribourg dissertation as she steers her way through a shoal of such rocks. For not only do the an- cient sources disagree over the number and identity of the Tiq. Soph., which accounts for the odd notational difference between BHK and BHS (e.g. at Mal. i 12, 13), they are not even unanimous as to the significance Vetus Testamentum XXXII, 3 (1982) 358</page><page sequence="2">REVIEWS of the phenomenon. Is it that the standard Massoretic text incorporates euphemistic emendations? Or are the "euphemisms" aboriginal and the discarded readings purportedly preserved in the later lists merely sugges- tions as to what Scripture would have said if it had eschewed euphemism? Since estimations of the textual worth of the Tiq. Soph. tradition have ranged, in the modern period, from full acceptance (A. Geiger, C. D. Ginsburg) to outright rejection (W. E. Barnes), Sr McCarthy seeks to ad- judicate by means of a full inquiry which sees the Tiq. Soph. against the background of theological emendation in general. The problem and some attempts to deal with it are briefly recounted in the first chapter. In her second chapter Sr McCarthy considers the various ancient lists of Tiq. Soph., and of the consanguineous kinnuyiym, which is the term which actually appears in the earliest texts, notably Mekilta on Exod. xv 7 and Siphre on Num. x 35. The kinnuyim represent the same basic phenomenon, though the term itself is more general, implying something more in the way of euphemism than of emendation. K. G. Kuhn's hypothesis of an earlier source underlying both the Mekilta and the Siphre lists is approved as accounting for the more developed form of the Mekilta tradition without having to postulate its dependence on Siphre. Further developments via Yalqut ShimConi, Siphre Zutta and Midrash Haggadol are charted; the last-named establishes the custom, but rarely in evidence hitherto, of indicating the "original" readings. The Tanhuma literature, on the other hand, is notable for its frank use of the term tiqqun in associa- tion with the traditional, albeit numerically indeterminate, kinnyzim. Then there is the strange silence of some of the better quality Massoretic manuscripts, like the Leningrad and Aleppo codices, which either ignore the Tiq. Soph., as do these two, or manage only an occasional reference. Chapter three is vertebral in that here nineteen of the eighteen (tradi- tionally) Tiq. Soph. are examined for signs of authenticity or unauthen- ticity, with, in point of fact, only three- Sam. iii 13, Job vii 20 and Zech. ii 12-passing muster. Since Zech. ii 12 occupies pole position in several of the earliest lists it is treated first on the not unreasonable assumption that unauthenticity in this instance would suggest a poor outlook for the rest. The happy conclusion, from the point of view of the undertaking, is that the variously attested minority reading, "my eye", is a "genuine textual alternative" to the MT "his eye". Largely on the basis of the Qumran fragment 4QXIIe the existence of the minority reading before AD 90 is claimed. Still there remains the ticklish question whether this early variant merits recognition as the original reading in Zech. ii 12. And if this turns out to be the case does it necessarily follow that the MT presents a theologically motivated correction? Context, claims Sr McCar- thy, leaning full weight on A. Petitjean's analysis of verses 10-13, favours the originality of the variant, since it is contextually preferable to begin the divine speech in verse 12b rather than in verse 13. But there is little to go 359</page><page sequence="3">REVIEWS on and, the siren voice of Petitjean notwithstanding, the evidence scarcely permits more than a non liquet. One important aspect of the problem which is, unfortunately, banished to the footnotes, with a cross-reference to a short section a hundred pages later, concerns the possible objection that the alteration of "my eye" to "his eye" would not obviate the an- thropomorphism to which exception had been taken in the first place. "His eye" could be reflexive, referring to the would-be assailant ofJudah, but the earliest sources talk of euphemism and so there is a question to be answered. Sr McCarthy's answer is that, since such a change as a means of avoiding direct attribution is attested elsewhere, the third person suffix was meant to refer to God's eye, while contriving to be a sufficient conces- sion to anti-anthropomorphic sensibilities. Parallel uses of the third person are indeed cited, but the straight parallels are all Talmudic, which is a trifle unsatisfactory when it has been shown that the variant is at least as old as the first century AD. Perhaps if the whole question of third person attribution had been addressed at the appropriate point in the discussion the necessary supporting evidence-which might include the Tiq. Soph. texts in the Tannaitic midrashim-would have been adduced, or, con- ceivably, might have been seen to be lacking. It was also inadvisable to leave ticking away in a footnote a time-bomb in the form of an admission that "the ultimate origin of a (sic) variant reading for Zech. 2:12 may have been due to a chance corruption, or to a purely material error on the part of a copyist" (p. 67). If that were so the case for theological emendation of the MT would be lost to post factum rationalization of textual cruces by midrashists and homilists. Of course, the "material error", involving the not unparalleled confusion of the Hebrew waw andyodh, may have occur- red just as the footnote suggests; though in that case either reading could be original. Alternatively, on the supposition that the minor variant is the older, one could easily envisage contamination from Deut. xxxii 10, the more so if verse 12b presented as much difficulty to the ancient experts as it does to their modern counterparts. As for the remainder of the Tiq. Soph., Sr McCarthy maintains that the absence of textual (manuscript and versional) support and the superiority of the Massoretic readings combine to invalidate all but a couple of the supposed original readings. Usually it is possible to fit them into a pattern of rabbinic exegesis in which textual criticism plays little or no part. As a general rule, Sr McCarthy argues her case clearly and convincingly, so that only a couple of points of reservation need be mentioned here. The first concerns 2 Sam. xvi 12 where, it is alleged on the basis of a single manuscript at Ps. cxix 92, the kethibh (bCwny) represents a peculiar or- thography for bcnyy, the form which is indicated by three of the major ver- sions. However, it is far from certain that the Psalm variant involves merely a different orthography, especially as a reading based on Biblical Hebrew Cwn ("guilt") would suit the context well enough to qualify as a 360</page><page sequence="4">REVIEWS substantive variant, regardless of how it arose. In a good discussion of Hab. i 12, where preference is given to the MT ("we shall not die") over against the Tiq. Soph. variant ("you will not die"), the Targum is treated with suspicion, and perhaps rightly. Certainly, by ordinary Targumic canons, "your word endures forever"-with characteristic use of memrda-would appear to side with the variant. But Sr McCarthy is doubt- ful, and perhaps her doubt would be compounded by the observation that the same Aramaic functions in Hab. iii 9, 19 as a rendering of 'mr slh and slh respectively. On the other hand, the usual Targumic equivalent of seldh is simply lecalegmn "forever" (cf. Hab. iii 3), so that the Hab. i 12 render- ing may have influenced the later verses. Such evidence as lQpHab af- fords-part of the biblical lemma has perished-tends to support the MT, as Sr McCarthy notes; however, in view of the occasional disagreement between lemma and commentary in this document absolute dogmatism about the absence of the variant is best avoided. After an excursus on the LXX passages "which the sages changed for King Ptolemy", and on some fairly superficial points of comparison with the kinnuyml/Tiq. Soph. tradition, the scope of the investigation is widened to include the 'al-tiqre' phenomenon in the midrashic and talmudic cor- pora. There is no question of original readings here, simply the introduc- tion, by means of a number of devices affecting consonantal text or vocalization, of cherished interpretations of a midrashic nature. In the course of noting some shared features Sr McCarthy suggests that in a few cases, e.g. Gen. xviii 22 and 2 Sam. xx 1, the Tiq. Soph. variant may have emerged out of the aal-tiqre1 industry. There is indeed one case-1 Kings xii 16-where a Tiq. Soph. variant also figures as an 'al-tiqreP. Euphemism, the subject of chapter five, also forms part of the background to the Tiq. Soph. phenomenon, with ample attestation in both biblical and rabbinic literature. Examples from the latter are review- ed first because they are obviously primary or "original" euphemisms, and Sr McCarthy is interested not only in spotting euphemisms in the biblical text but also in distinguishing, where possible, between the primary and the secondary. Various old familiars like "bless" for "curse" and the insertion of "the enemies of" in offensive-sounding statements about God or his people are passed in review, and there is also the in- teresting use of "those men" in Num. xvi 14 and 1 Sam. xxix 4 as a means of avoiding the first person. Many a modern translator and com- mentator would have benefited from a look at the Peshitta or Vulgate for these verses-or even at 1 Chron. xii 19 where the parallel to the Samuel passage has "our heads". Three biblical references where the words "the enemies of" are inserted euphemistically are also discussed, and pro- nounced secondary despite R. Yaron and his parallel from the Coptos Decree (Egyptian 13th Dynasty). In this Sr McCarthy is influenced by the existence of a variant reading ("the word of") in a Qumran fragment of 2 361</page><page sequence="5">REVIEWS Sam. xii 14, concluding with some justification that the divergence may point to the presence of neither reading in the original (non-euphemistic) form of the verse. The possibility of contamination of the Qumran verse by an MT-type text of verse 9 in the same chapter is not considered. Tex- tual and contextual factors are also thought to mark the same usage in 1 Sam. xx 16 and xxv 22 as secondary. Even so, it is, as the Coptos Decree shows, an ancient usage, and one which has recently been illustrated from the Mari archives where it occurs in a letter of Inib-sarrim to Zimri-lim (see M. Anbar (Bernstein), "Un euphemisme 'biblique' dans une lettre de Mari", Orientalia, N.S. 48 [1979], pp. 109-11). The general effect of this fifth chapter, it should be said, is to show that biblical euphemisms are as often as not original to the text. Chapter six, with titular echoes from another period ("An Examination of certain Biblical Verses which Illustrate with Reasonable Certitude that Theological Corrections did really take place"), looks for "unofficial" Tiq. Soph. in the Old Testament, and among its catch are "the men" in 1 Sam. ii 17 and "your men" in 1 Kings x 8. In the former case the words, which are lacking in LXX and 4QSama, are thought to have been inserted to separate "despised" from its object, "the offering of the LORD". The possible influence of Num. xvi 30 is noted, but still in the context of euphemism. Sr McCarthy may be right, but the cross-fertilizing of texts without reference to euphemism is a possibility; compare the formative in- fluence of Num. xxx 3 on 4QSama at 1 Sam. i 23. And if, in 1 Kings x 8, the quiescent 'aleph has been prefixed in order to convert Solomon's "blessed wives" into men, then one might even think of "'aleph apologeticum"-to use the title of a short piece inJQR N.S. 69 (1978), pp. 112-6. Many other instances of euphemism, and of dysphemism, are surveyed in this chapter, en route to the undoubtedly safe conclusion that corrective tendencies such as are represented in the Tiq. Soph. may be traced back to the pre-LXX stage of the developing Hebrew text. Finally, and with the authority which her labours have won for her, Sr McCarthy advises that future editors of the Hebrew Bible should omit all reference to the Tiq. Soph., first because of the general unreliability of the tradition, and secondly because, in the few surviving cases, the tradition is put into the shade by the superior textual evidence to hand. In short, though Sr McCarthy differs from W. E. Barnes in that she leaves a rem- nant in possession, she is able to quote approvingly his verdict that the T-S tradition "belongs rather to Midrash than to Masorah". She has done much to buttress that conclusion. 362 Cambridge R. P. Gordon</page></plain_text>
