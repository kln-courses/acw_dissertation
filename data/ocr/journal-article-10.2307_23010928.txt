Entry requirements are simple: Send us a one- or two page (typed, double-spaced) summary that describes what you accomplished, in just enough detail to let us judge the appropriateness of your work for the competition. Entries will be expected to report on a completed, practical application, and must describe results that had significant, verifiable, and preferably quantifiable impact on the performance of the client organization. Finalist work will be published in the January 2000 issue of Interfaces. Any work you have done in recent years is eligible, unless it has already been described by a Franz Edelman Award finalist. Previous publication of the work does not disqualify it. Anyone is eligible for the competition except members of the judging panel. The purpose of the competition is to call out, recognize, and reward outstanding examples of management science and operations research in practice. The prize is awarded for implemented work, not for a submitted paper or for the presentation describing the work. The client organization that used the winning work receives a prize citation; the authors of the winning work receive a cash award. Key milestone dates for the competition: • Summaries (one or two double-spaced 8V2" x 11" pages), plus the name, address, phone number, and affiliation of each author must be in our hands by Wednesday, November 4, 1998. • Finalists will be selected based on the summaries, any other written materials submitted, and the INFORMS/CPMS verification process by Monday, January 4, 1999. • Full written papers in a prescribed format will be due from each finalist, along with a publication release from the client organization, a public relations press kit, and the name of the client organization management representative who would accept the prize citation by Monday, March 8, 1999. • Each finalist group will give an oral presentation of their work in the special competition session (which will be videotaped) at the Cincinnati Meeting on Sunday, May 2, 1999. • The judges will determine the winner or winners after the presentations and the results will be announced at the INFORMS Cincinnati Meeting. The summaries, papers, press kits, and presentations must be in English. All papers submitted by finalists become the property of INFORMS. Transmittal of cash award is contingent on the finalist delivering to INFORMS/CPMS, in a specified form, a paper that meets normal publication standards, and (for First Prize) contingent on presentation of the work at the CPMS Plenary Session at the INFORMS Philadelphia Fall 1999 Meeting. INFORMS/CPMS reserve the right to make the granting of awards conditional on the entries satisfying requirements and standards established for the competition. Send your summary, to arrive by Wednesday, November 4, 1998, to: 1999 INFORMS/CPMS Prize Competition, Mr. Russell Labe, Merrill Lynch, Management Science Group, Section 31, P.O.

Stripling 97.02 Hewlett-Packard Use of operations research techniques to improve the design of an HP printer production line almost doubled expected system throughput with minimum impact on flow time and work-in-progress, which also was successfully applied to other division projects and has led to savings of several million dollars per month. Mitchell H. Burman, Stanley B. Gershwin, and Curtis Suyematsu 97.03 NORTEL An OR-driven approach to redefining factory infor mation technology resulted in a complete implemented network and decision support system in less than one year, providing real-time access to production metrics relating to quality, inventory and cycle time, and linked analysis tools for simulation environment, expert systems, and statistical production design analysis.

Raymond B. Johnson, Claudia Greif Alva J. Svoboda, Alireza Vojdani, and Fulin Zhuang 97.05 Taco Bell Corporation A real-time decision making system of three major components was developed to control labor costs: a demand forecasting model, a simulation model to determine appro priate staffing, and an optimization model to perform staff schedul ing resulting in savings of one hour per day per company-owned store, over $7.6 million per year. Jackie Hueter and William Swart 97.06 U.S. Department of Energy Using formal probability elici tations, event tree analyses and Monte Carlo simulations, a dynamic production simulation was developed to predict production of tri tium over a 40-year period. This analysis formed the technical basis for the Secretary of Energy's decision to pursue both the commercial reactor options and the accelerator option for producing required reserve levels of tritium needed for nuclear weapons maintenance.
