<plain_text><page sequence="1">BERKSON, CARMEL. The Divine and the Demoniac: Mahisas Heroic Struggle with Durga. Delhi: Oxford University Press, 1995. xiv+318 pp. $29.95 (cloth). Hindu mythology recounts the story of Mahisa, an anthropomorphic buffalo- demon who managed to steal control of the cosmos from the gods until he was ultimately decapitated by the goddess Durga after a prolonged battle. The myth finds its locus classicus in the sixth-century C.E. text, the Devi-Mahatmya, and is recounted countless times and in countless ways in later Puranas, folktales, and ritual traditions, many of which are still celebrated today throughout India. Berkson takes this myth-ritual complex of the buffalo and the goddess and attempts to decipher its many meanings through psychological theory (especially oedipal theory), ethnographic field reports, Indian literature, historical records, and general cross-cultural comparisons. Her listing of ethnographic comparisons harks back to Frazer, her psychoanalytic theorizing is clearly indebted to Freud, and her general understanding of religious symbolism and ritual (as concretized projections of the psyche that can therapeutically act to relieve psychic stress and lead the person to some modicum of individuality) are Jungian, as are her cross- cultural speculations. Frazer and Jung, though, are not at the heart of this book. Freud is. For Berk- son's central thesis is that the myth of Mahisa and the mother goddess is a story about the development of the male ego in India and its desperate (and ultimately unsuccessful) attempt to win its independence from its own loving and terrible mother, who finally decapitates the son, thereby symbolically castrating him and ending his heroic quest for individuality and existence. Now much of this is not new. There is a sizable literature on the symbolic equa- tions of head/phallus and decapitation/castration in Indian myth and ritual. Simi- larly, numerous theorists (Sudhir Kakar foremost among them) have written ex- tensively on the development of the male ego in India and its intimate bond with the mother figure. What this book offers to this discourse is an elaborate, creative, 487</page><page sequence="2">The Journal of Religion and well-researched rereading of the Mahisa/Durga myth through the perspec- tive of Mahisa, whom Berkson identifies (no doubt correctly) with the ancient male mythmaker and the modern male devotee. Thus, in Berkson's reading, Mahisa is no pure demon but an ambiguous, liminal hero figure who shares the quality of both man and animal, demon and god (hence the book's title). This basic intuition is supported, like some grand French cathedral, by huge flying buttresses of ethnographic detail, fascinating descriptions of contemporary rituals Berkson observed, and a study of the sculpture tradition (all of which are for the most part successful), as well as highly speculative cross-cultural comparisons scattered throughout the text and featured in the appendices (few of which are successful). Psychoanalytically inclined readers will find the book useful and convincing in its central claims. Others might have difficulty, but even they might benefit from the wealth of information and detail it provides about Indian buffalos and god- desses. The book should be read with Stanley Kurtz's earlier and more theoreti- cally sophisticated All the Mothers Are One: Hindu India and the Cultural Refashioning of Psychoanalysis (New York, 1993), which isolates the very same mythical complex to develop an alternative to the Western oedipal complex called "the Durga complex."
