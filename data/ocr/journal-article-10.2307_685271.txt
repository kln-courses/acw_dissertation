<plain_text><page sequence="1">BEHOLD, MY CHILD, THE NORDIC DOG To Lorenz animals are what words, numbers and mountains are to other exceptional people. In few disciplines of zoology can such people exploit the sensibility of observation which their passion gives them. They owe Lorenz a debt for creating a study of animal psychology in which they can be at home. In this book 1 he writes about twenty-five species, mainly fish, birds and mammals. Many others are mentioned. The two best essays are on his jackdaw colony, and his vivarium for water shrews. These are two extremes of culture methods. The jackdaw colony he established on the roof of his home, intending that the animals should behave undisturbed by captivity. To attempt this 1King Solomon's Ring. New Light on Animal Ways, Konrad Z.

He gives details of how he psychologically attached them to his house. How, not being in the com- pany of adult birds, they were not afraid of human beings, and had to be protected from predators. How he discovered what they innately fear, how they learnt by the experience-not ofdanger-but of a spectacle, which in normal surroundings would almost always coincide with danger, but which in an environment of human artefacts they encountered without danger. How they communicate their memory of this experience, so that in an established colony the young are warned of the dangers of the country- side. He tells of their social hierarchy, and how clearly they can be seen to know one another as individuals; of the way this hierarchy protects the weakest; how rapidly any alteration in it is acknowledged by every bird. A male jackdaw after a betrothal of a year marries for life a female below him in the peck order. From her betrothal onwards she is raised to her husband's rank, as in our own species. He makes clear that to speak of the betrothal and marriage of some animals is no more anthropomorphic than to speak of their head or mother. The English naturalists who first spoke of a bird's mate used that word to emphasise this. It has become debased comparatively recently. He describes how the old look after the young of the whole colony, both in common and exceptional difficulties; how he lost birds for years and how they returned causing revealing readjustments of peck order. And he tells a lot about his own mind in the process. The rearing of water shrews from an artificial weaning is a tour de force, and Lorenz falls into the Cellini-like conceit of a great technician. The shrews were in a closed container whose description raises many questions of animal keeping. Should we aim at what looks to us like a natural habitat; should we frequently clean it, or leave it to oscillate round an ecological equilibrium in which we play a subsidiary part, though the con- centration of parasites and decomposing excreta is much larger than in any normal environment ? How much do a species' sensory perceptions and motor reactions differ from our own so that animals must escape, or injure themselves to show us the danger ? No one who reads this book will ever believe again that keeping an animal decently means providing it with a temperature at which it will survive, and substances which it will eat, or even acknowledging it may have light preferences. Providing an animal with a single fellow prisoner of the opposite sex is often the cruellest thing that can be done to one member of the pair. Lorenz' motives are, to himself, inaccessible. His rationalisation about these is to me unsympathetic. His attempt to proselytise I think a mistake. People who do not keep animals will find in this book the pleasure they find in exotic lives, both the animals' and the author's. Some of his stories will rank with Barrington's part song for two Bullfinches and Darwin playing the bassoon to the climbing plant. Children may not like some of 266</page><page sequence="3">REVIEWS his standards : 'let the procuring of your pet cost some trouble or money, or both.' Children believe that a reward is as sullied as a bribe. They value the luck that is deified in some cultures, and expressed by the Magnificat in, our own. But they will be made happy by finding a person whose growing up was not ' fallings from us, vanishings'. But as this book is being widely read it is important to consider im- plications. It is badly translated, not only pompously, but with the misuse of words that is frequently a consequence. The two most serious are 'mimic' and' mimetic' to mean 'exaggerated to function as communica- tion', and 'highcaste' to describe an animal high in the peck order of its colony. Therefore it is difficult to discuss. Lorenz uses several non-scientific verbalisations; for instance the wind is stupid, trees wave their arms, and, most surprising, he tells us he is attempting to make a breed of dogs with' an undistorted soul . . . which is specially capable of supplying that which poor, civilised, city pent man is so badly in need of!' Every reader I have met has a different opinion of when he is using a poetic fallacy, and when he is being explicit. This is unfortunate, as one of his major contributions to our thought is the emphasis that a comprehension of human behaviour, like a comprehension of human anatomy, must be based on a knowledge of the vertebrate series. The functional significances of, for example, commuting and the Oedipus situa- tion become clear by such comparison. He uses human words for animal activities--when they are respected in our community; and natural history words for human activities if he wants to enlist sympathy for human frailty. Lorenz has been criticised for changing his technical jargons as his ideas develop. In King Solomon's Ring he seems to tie himself in knots trying to avoid using one. Any discussion of the interaction of nature and nurture demands an explained use of terms, because everyday speech perpetuates archaic concepts. It is still literate to say I inherit my father's nose, his surname, and his watch! Most of the theory could have been discussed so as to introduce the vocabulary used by Tinbergen.' Many people, certainly most adolescents, derive satisfaction from learning technicalities. Some of the terms of comparative ethology are becoming catch phrases. Children would like to use them correctly, and would look for the phenomena in their environ- ment. Tinbergen has greatly stimulated people over eighteen. The book that will sell comparative ethology to people over twelve, who have every hope of making major contributions, has yet to be written. The lack of bibliography is also disappointing. Three books are mentioned, two difficult, one impossible, to obtain. This failure to provide any link with other authors seems most serious in his essay on the language of animals. His references to his tits and 1N. Tinbergen, The Study of Instinct, Oxford, '95S 267</page><page sequence="4">REVIEWS warblers suggests that he is working on the communicatory functions of song and call-notes. Perhaps he has obtained results that justify his ignoring previous discussions of the subject.1 His inclusion of social insects in his generalisations about what is innate and ubiquitous, are not confirmed for hive bees. Von Frisch 2 does not know whether their symbolic dance which he calls a language is innate, and he has subsequently found geo- graphical variation in it. The differences between Lorenz' generalisations and those of the other authors are that he underrates the extent of learning in an animal's lifetime, and geographical variation. This brings me to my most serious criticism of his thought processes, a consistent underemphasis on change. Much of his love of animals is for the individual differences between them, but his failure to draw certain conclusions from these has led many younger workers to consider that he does not believe in evolution. An example of their evidence occurs in the second half of the essay. This discusses the various ways in which animals and men communicate with each other, and con- cludes with several anecdotes of parrots and corvines volunteering human words in appropriate situations. These involve the recognition of animals, warnings, and departure. In all these situations birds use their voices among themselves. He describes a parrot that attempted to defaecate whenever looked at in its cage, because it was only liberated after this process. However, Otto Koehler failed to teach a parrot to say 'food' when it was hungry, and Lorenz concludes: 'The whole complicated apparatus of the bird's syrinx and brain that makes imitation and association of thought possible, appears to have no function in connection with the survival of the species. We ask ourselves vainly what it is there for !' I can think of no adult bird that uses its syrinx when it is hungry, nor of any situation where it would be useful to do so. However, many birds, including the only wild parrots I have seen ( Psittacula krameri) do use their voices after they have discovered food, thus attracting the flock. It might, therefore, be possible to teach a parrot to say the appropriate human words when itstole food, or when the appropriate fruits appeared on the trees each year. A parrot might learn to say 'look out' when it was startled visually, and then volunteer it when startled aurally or tactilely. This underrating of the consequences of variation, and inhibition in look- ing for adaptations, results in Lorenz failing to recognise the ubiquity and speed of systematic genetic change, that is to say of evolutionary processes. 1 E.g.

The relatively enormous fins of the male in his drawings of the fighting fish Betta splendens, and his description of its fight, page 26 : 'The self-display dance can last for hours but, should it develop into action, it is often only a matter of minutes before one of the combatants lies mortally wounded on the bottom,' betray that he is considering the European and American domestic form. The dorsal and caudal fins of a wild male Betta splendens are of the same size as those of the female, and the anal fin is only slightly larger. The same proportions are found in the Siamese domestic fish that are bet on in fish fights. In these, the display lasts for seconds or minutes at most. The fish then fight, biting each other's fins, often reducing them to stumps. Only in some fights are the flanks and opercula injured. Wild fish never fight for more than twenty minutes, but domestic stock may continue for 24 hours. This extension of time has been produced by selection in the last century. Asiatic fish never kill each other or die of injuries; their swimming may be affected temporarily by reduction of fin area. The defeated fish swims away and the victor does not chase him.' This is another example of the vanquished being able to call offa fight, as described by Lorenz, pp. 181-199. Therefore the pattern of fighting which Lorenz describes, the exaggeration of the display, the introduction of a new movement, the violent ' ramming' resulting in an internal rupture causing sudden death, or alternatively the lack of co-ordination between the contestants so that one is either unable to receive, or avoid a blow, let alone arouse a mercy inhibition, does not represent 'the result of an evolutional development of innate instinctive activities, at least a hundred times older' than the ceremonial dances of Java. It has been developed in Europe in the last fifty years during a domes- tication by people whose motive for keeping such animals was the romantic one described by Lorenz on page 58. Such people would quite unconsciously, by the considerations with which they put fish together, and removed them from one another, select for display and against biting. The great fins may have been selected consciously, but the enormous reproductive advantages given by aquarists to the earliest fish in any shoal to become sexually distinguishable-of which Lorenz provides an example in his description of breeding cichlid fish-selects for precocity and exaggeration of any sexual dimorphism. Descriptions of the behaviour of the related Macropodus opercularis in the aquarium books of the I870's similarly differ from anything we can observe today in European stocks of this species. Thus the fighting of wild fighting fish is more like that ofsticklebacks than Lorenz emphasises, and all the differences are functionally correlated with the differences between the structures and durations of their nests. Whenever the early records are full enough, or freshly caught animals 1 Hugh M. Smith, 'The Fresh-water fishes of Siam, or Thailand,' Bulletin 188, United States National Museum, 1945 269</page><page sequence="6">REVIEWS have been examined, changes in behaviour have been discovered in stocks that have been kept in captivity, whether we think of them as domesticated or not. This failure to expect rapid evolutionary change with every change in the animal's environment has led Lorenz to his most questionable assertions. In his consideration of domestic dogs he attributes certain psychological characteristics to certain breeds. In my experience these correlations are not as vivid as they are to him. These differences he attributes to whether the breed has wolf ancestry : '... comparative research in behaviour has revealed the fact that all European dogs, including the largest ones, are pure Aureus and contain, at the most, a minute amount of wolf's blood. The purest wolf-dogs that exist are certain breeds of Arctic America . Aureus is the specific name of the Asiatic jackal. The quoted sentences reveal why Lorenz underestimates genetic change. If he is using blood to mean cellular antigens it is improper to write of the 'amount.' Cellular antigens are inherited discretely, and are counted. If'amount of wolf's blood ' is used as a vernacular for' proportion of ancestors that were wolves 40,000 years ago', this is information that cannot be obtained by any technique, physical or psychological. The number of wolf ancestors of a breed and the number of wolf allelomorphs in a breed today are correlated, but this correlation is a function of the selection pressure. Genes from a single ancestor may spread through a breed, or species, if they give animals that carry them sufficient advantage. Also it is inefficient to think of'number of allelomorphs.' Gene loci are not equipotential. Only the loci that are concerned with the differences which we have learnt to recognise between wolves and jackals can as yet be considered. Also gene loci are not stable. It is probably the most correct approximation to think of every single wolf, jackal, and dog that ever existed as having a different genotype. The expression 'wolf's blood' disguises the fact that every single wolf gamete is different, and in any change of environment, from the physiology of a specific hybrid, to being reared from puppy-hood by a human being, the differences are more important than the similarities. In two closely related species like the wolf and the jackal, variations indistinguishable by any technique (including the genetic) are expected to occur independently, as Darwin pointed out. This is implied by classifying them in the same genus. If the two species were put in the same environment similar adaptations to it would be selected in each. The differences Lorenz emphasises between his Alsatian and his Chow can be explained by the recent histories of the two breeds, without hypothesising more allelomorphs derived from wolves in the latter. Alsatian dogs are used by armies and police to hunt other men, and over large parts of Europe they are sheep dogs. They lead the blind and become film stars. The draft dogs of Belgium are like them. They have been selected to 270</page><page sequence="7">REVIEWS co-operate with men-a continually changing team of men. They have been selected recently to look more wolf-like. This may once have been to make them frightening, now it is valued for romantic reasons, which Lorenz shares. Chows, until the opening of China to the west, were as much domestic animals as the rats in our warehouses, though they were more often eaten. Their coat and skeletal configuration, the latter indistinguish- able from that of the dogs of the neolithic lake dwellers, were ecological adaptations. They lived in little groups, like other feral dogs. His emphasis on hereditary continuity as opposed to genetic change is the reason why Lorenz omits certain details from his papers. This book is more scientific. Here he frequently tells us where he obtained his animals, and sometimes even when. These, the locality data of classical taxonomy, are among the pieces of information in a paper the value of which is most likely to increase with every reinterpretation. Lorenz either em- phasises a unique occurrence, or makes a generalisation about the species implying that for the purposes of his argument all specimens behave alike. Speciation geneticists are becoming increasingly interested in animals' perception of one another. No one could tell us more about this than Lorenz, but we can find no appreciation of our questions in his work. During the last twenty years increasing speculation has centred round the genesis of psychological sterility barriers. Lorenz seems to consider the question so little that he even shows aesthetic callousness to an animal, page I84. He put two doves together. The female pecked the whole of the skin off the male's back. Lorenz was so shocked by this that he builds a considerable theory on it, and draws the female with a sword under her wing (p. 198). There are many questions I should like to ask, but of the facts presented the relevant one seems that the doves were of species so different that Lorenz follows the taxonomists who put them in different genera ! To attempt to make a specific hybrid is always cruel to an animal, because failures in communication are to be expected. I have tried to review this book, and not to discuss some of Lorenz' recent ideas.1 The attempt by a scientist to present his work to a wider audience is very much the concern of any student of the philosophy of science, both for the light it throws on the scientist, and the consequences on the intellectual climate in which we live. The audience for which such a book is written contains one component incomparably more important than the rest, both for the author and for us, his successors. A few of these may start keeping animals because of this book, but most of Lorenz' successors will have kept animals since they were able to coordinate their 1E.g. K. Z. Lorenz, 'The Comparative Method in Studying Innate Behaviour Patterns,' Symposia of the Society for Experimental Biology IV, Cambridge, 195so. The section' "Comparative anatomy " ofbehaviour' shows how he is handicapped by lack of hypotheses, Lamarckian or selectionist, about the causes of evolution. 271</page><page sequence="8">REVIEWS eyes and their hands. For them the wish to keep an animal does not arise 'from a general longing for a bond with Nature.' They have no sense of separation; they eat the dog's food to find out what it tastes like. The dog figures in their monologue interieur as their brother or their husband. In large areas of present culture-which includes but is not confined to the English speaking world, but also does not correspond with the alliances of the I939-I945 war-many of these people have become geneticists. They are surprised at Lorenz' repeated antitheses between man and Nature. I am uncertain whether it is fair to Lorenz to discuss this point. I suspect that it, like the sentimentality about dogs, is an insincerity put in because he thinks it will make his biological ideas, which are in contradiction to it, more acceptable to a hypothetical British Public. Unfortunately it blurs those of his ideas which I think important, while exposing those I think retrograde. In Austria discussion of evolution has been impossible, not only under the Nazis but under the Roman Catholic Church. His demonstrations that much of our snobbery, sense of property, and sexual morals are shared by other animals, in the form which we regard as specifically human, could have been emphasised, as this is under- estimated by current moralities (e.g. the Christian, the Marxist, and the Freudian). I see no reason why in Homo sapiens the instinctive signs which transmit mood should have 'degenerated as our word-language developed.' They are still relied on in the activities of preservation of the species, love-making, the rearing of children, clinical medicine, human physiology, team work especially in the presence of danger, and oratory. The study of speciation by natural selection, which may be described as the contemplation of death, produces more sense of community with other forms of life than does the study of behaviour, which, as it relies on the observation of inappropriate actions, either apparently accidental or provoked, may be described as the contemplation of sin.
