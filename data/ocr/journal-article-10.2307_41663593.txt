<plain_text><page sequence="1">By DERICKSEN M. BRINKERHOFF GREEK AND ETRUSCAN ART The displays standards at the of Philadelphia design revealed Centennial by the Exposition American displays at the Philadelphia Centennial Exposition in 1876 led to the founding of a museum and school by a group of Rhode Island women. Aroused by the lack of artistry displayed in many of the domestic manufac- tured objects, they were favorably impressed by the British exhibit sent from the technical school of South Kensington. The constitution of Rhode Island School of Design provided for instruction in various arts, and for the "general advancement of public Art education by the exhibition of works of Art." Hence the origins of the school and its museum parallel the establishment twenty- five years earlier in London of the Victoria and Albert Museum and its school as a result of the famous inter- national exhibition at the Crystal Palace. The museum in Providence now serves the college of which it is a part, and the community of which it has become a feature, in accordance with the wishes of its founders and supporters. As the school has developed into a professional college, the museum has grown to its present stature with a collection constantly being en- riched by the persistent acquisition of antiquities. The Classical galleries display outstanding marble and bronze sculptures, an important collection of Greek vases, and examples of coinage, jewelry and other arts. Rather than set forth a diverse sampling, this article attempts to con- vey an idea of the depth and quality of the exhibits within the restricted range of Etruscan and Greek metal work and Greek marbles. Several of the objects illustrated have entered the collection in the course of the last few years, and more than one third of them have been ob- tained within the past decade. These examples also dem- onstrate the museum's current policy of concentrating on areas already well represented in order to assemble a richer and more significant collection. As in many museums in the United States, the nucleus of the Classical collection was built up around the turn of the century, and the bulk of the marbles and vases was obtained at that time. Mrs. Gustav Radeke, for whom the gallery of Greek marbles is named, donated or assisted in purchasing almost all the well chosen antiquities which entered the Museum before her death in 1931. Many pur- chases made since then are the result of Mrs. Radeke' s foresight and generosity. Current exhibition policy is made manifest by the new entrance hall, the Radeke Gallery, which encourages the visitor to look around the moment he is inside. Like a newspaper headline, it not only makes a statement but also invites closer scrutiny. Here the sculpture is placed in the manner of some English country houses, with artfully arranged miniature vistas in every direction. Against a cool blue wall the Greek marbles gain clarity of contour, and the large windows east and west permit them to come alive in the sunlight. More than mere showmanship, the installation represents an attempt to provoke the joy of discovery, so that even the casual passerby will do more than pay these works dutiful respect, and also to give them an arena in which, though displaced from their own time and space, they continue to command attention. Beyond the brilliant light of the entrance gallery a darkened room contains shadow boxes of varying size and height. Many of the bronzes are shown here. It may seem at first glance as if there were no historical prece- dent for this sort of display, used in many museums. Actually, however, this is no more than a contemporary version of the eighteenth-century cabinet, a room for the display of precious objects and curios, markedly similar in scale and type to those in museums today. In this article preference has been given to works ob- 150</page><page sequence="2">BRONZE KOUROS Greek, late sixth century b.c. "Amphias made this dedication from the tithes to the Far-shooter" (Apollo). So runs the in- scription on the legs and thighs of this miniature bronze. A cer- tain rusticity of detail in the modeling goes with its prove- nience, believed to be the Ptoan sanctuary in Boeotia. Statuettes from this area often make up in vigor and directness for their lack of sophistication, and are just as charming as their more metropolitan relatives. There is an undeniable attraction to con- temporary eyes exerted by Archaic sculpture's forthright strength of shape. The figure's interplay between definition by volume and delineation by linear means illustrates succinctly two modes of formal realization often combined in the Archaic period. The absence of a schematic pattern on chest and stomach to describe the male anatomy, indicated instead by the mass of the torso, is a feature of work created toward the end of the sixth century b.c.

The Etruscan bronzes illustrated here were selected not only as representative pieces but also to per- mit an appraisal of the extent of Etruscan prowess in intricate phases of design and technique. In the case of the Greek examples, the best of the bronze figure sculp- ture has been selected. As for the marbles, the aims have been diverse. Statues or reliefs have been chosen from all periods. The female head contemporary with the Parthenon is almost the only major work of its kind in the Museum. Several specimens of fourth-century figures were selected because, though of good quality, they have never been published. Within the rather extensive geo- graphical spread of the Hellenistic era, the Alexandrian portrait heads constitute an outstanding sequence, stim- ulating intensive and fruitful study. From those centuries when portraiture had just become widely established as part of the western political, artistic and cultural tradi- tion the Museum presents original evidence of indispu- table value. The illustrations show how the Museum of Rhode Is- land School of Design is attempting to make its collection meaningful to scholar, student and layman. Their needs are not identical, neither are they mutually exclusive. Whether or not they examine, enjoy, and return to the objects displayed rests in part with museum policies of acquisition and exhibition, but in the last analysis de- pends upon the works of art themselves.

This maiden is an excellent example of the style of the later Archaic period: she is most at home in the decade from 520 to 510 B.c. The statuette, reputedly found below the Athenian Acrop- olis, is the only work in the Museum to show the type of dedicatory fe- male image created and refined in the period preceding the Persian wars. The right arm was made separately and set in by means of a long pin. The fabric of the himation, falling in flat folds across the front and caught up by the left hand, still preserves traces of red paint. A long strip of chiton, visible in the center, probably was painted a different color. The upper- most covering bears traces of vertical lines to indicate woolen material. In profile, the statue is rather slim for its breadth, and along the back it is modeled in low, easy, rounded undulations. The hair hung nearly to the level of the elbows ; the bulge representing it apparently was made clearer by painting. The coarse textured marble is not Attic but seems to be from one of the islands. Height IIV2 inches. Anonymous gift, 1955. BRONZE KOUROS Greek, early fifth century b.c. This figure was probably dedicated in the days of the Persian wars. That combination of hybris (pride) and aretê (virtue) which was being formulated when this bronze was cast, appears here as a statement in visual terms of the Greek awareness of the power and the limitations of the human being. This assertion both of self-reliance and of humility, the statuette's most expressive qualities, emerges most clearly when it is seen in frontal view. From this angle, too, the naturalistic rendition of the anatomy may be admired - the attention paid to the gentle bulge of the abdomen and chest, the clear silhouette, whose swellings and contractions reveal the qualities of the human body and imply its potential ability. The smooth, fluid quality appears so easy that we are apt to minimize the amount of subtle creative effort that went into the statuette's making. Cylinder, ellipse and sphere constitute the basic shapes of the various parts of the figure. Whatever object the youth once held in his clenched right hand has disappeared. When the legs were complete, the figure stood with the left leg advanced, betraying a slight stiffness of pose typical of the first decades after 500 B.c. The bronze surface is weathered to a gleaming russet mottled with green. Height 8 1/8 inches. Museum purchase, 1925. FEMALE HEAD Greek, third quarter of fifth century b.c. This head of Parian marble dates from an important period in which first-rate originals are rare indeed. Since its publication by the previous owner it has been remounted at an upright angle. Present opinion inclines toward believing that it is the head of a goddess from a pedimental complex contem- porary with the later decoration of the Parthenon in the 430's b.c. The holes at the sides of the head for the attachment of a metal fillet and those below them at the hair line suggest that the figure originally wore jewelry. The expression, before the eyes and nose became damaged, must have presented an effect of severity and reserved grandeur in conjunction with an inner vitality, like that of some heads on the Parthenon frieze. Finally, the coiffure with its large chignon above the nape can be compared with those of other heads of female divinities from the Periclean age. Over the head some addi- tional adornment, permanent or temporary, could be placed by utilizing a short socket- like hole at the crown, though it is difficult to visualize exactly what was placed there. The surface has not been reworked. Height 10 inches. Museum purchase, 1955. 152</page><page sequence="4">GRAVE STELE Greek, mid-fourth century b.c. This memorial relief in Pentelic marble is said to have come from the Kerameikos cemetery in Athens. A monu- mental stele of this kind was mounted in a frame, probably upon a raised terrace. The breaks in the stone seem to be recent. As an example of the expression of the Greek attitude toward death this sculpture is notable for its communication of mood; the architectonic solidity of the figure radiates serenity and inner strength. It conveys the essence of the ideal of a people whose balanced awareness of the shadowy reality of death and the vibrancy of life is one of the foundations of our humanistic heritage. Dimensions 54 by 24 inches. Purchased 1931 in memory of Eliza Greene Radeke. GREEK AND ETRUSCAN ART continued STATUETTE OF A BOY Greek, third quarter of fourth century B.c. This well known statue, the so-called Bebenberger torso, is probably from the island of Chios. Its style echoes that of two great fourth-century masters, Praxiteles and Lysippus. From the latter is derived the small-scale head, which the elder Pliny noted as a Lysippan innovation. Praxitelean, however, is the slight exaggeration of the torso, bent in an S-curve, which is so unlike the stocky bronze kouroi shown above. The entire surface was given a high degree of polish. Although it is known that marble statues were finished by being rubbed with a mixture containing beeswax, it would be difficult to prove that such was done in this case. There are considerable traces of paint on the head. The re- markably translucent effect of the stone was once called Alexandrian sfumato, but it is now recog- nized that this technique was more widespread in the late fourth and third centuries B.c. While the statue ably continues the tradition of the nude male figure in Greek sculpture, its scale, quality and artistic expressiveness forecast Hellenistic style. Height 18x1 inches. Museum purchase, 1923. 153</page><page sequence="5">PORTRAIT OF A LADY Hellenistic, probably third century b.c. This marble portrait is said to have been found in the Fayum area of Egypt. It complements the Museum's collection of Alexandrian royal portraits by furnishing a basis of comparison with them. Not only is the quality equally good but the effect is much warmer than the rather reserved royal style evident in the heads of Ptolemy VI and Arsinoé III. The impression of a lady very much alive, and very Greek, is enhanced by the yellow-brown patina of the Greek marble, which is iridescent in the sunlight. There are clear indications of paint in the hair, and even more in the outline of the pupils of the eyes. The face is finely carved and modeled in planes, as in the treatment of the eyebrows, but the ears and other details are handled in a more cursory fashion. The profile of the forehead and its smooth continuation onto the bridge of the nose emphasize the low brow seen also in portraits of the earlier Ptolemies. Height I2V4 inches. Museum purchase, 1956. GREEK AND ETRUSCAN ART continued BRONZE STATUETTE OF APHRODITE Hellenistic, late first century b.c. The goddess of love clasps her prized apple of victory, thanks to an imaginative restoration which does not agree with contemporary practice or with modern scholarship. Restored portions include the left forearm, whose pose probably matched the right, and the right foot. Once assigned to the fourth century, more recent appraisals place it later, possibly even in or near the time of Augustus, when Roman patrons were responsible for a revival of the Aphrodite types originated by Praxiteles and his circle. An inlay of silver is still preserved around the eyes and lips, and the decorative effect is enhanced by a bracelet on the right arm and a double fillet binding the hair. In contrast to the positive, straightforward attitude of the Greek kouroi, her mood is pensive and withdrawn. Height 18% inches. Pur- chased from the Reinach Collection, 1926. 154</page><page sequence="6">HEAD OF PTOLEMY VI Hellenistic, second quarter of second century B.c. The profile of Egypt's sixth Ptolemy shown on coins has made possible the identification of this head as that of the king who ruled Egypt from 181 to 145 B.C. and also conquered Syria. The features do not seem those of one who has ruled over a quarter century ; in the downcast attitude the cares of kingship may be anticipated, but the face is that of a young man. There are obvious fourth-century artistic antecedents, for the technical finish and the pose of withdrawn brooding recall Praxitelean traits. There is a lyric softness given to the translucent island marble which is inherent in the best Alexandrian tradition, while the intense pathos goes with Hellenistic sculpture of the earlier second century B.c. The head, like many of this period, was completed by the addition of a separate piece of stone or stucco. In this case (as generally when the marble was imported) the latter material was employed. Stucco is so quick-drying a medium that the modeling of the hair atop the head was undoubtedly even more impressionistic than that in the marble. The back of the head and neck were chiseled flat, showing that in its original mounting the head formed part of a statue intended for a niche or even placed against a slab in the traditional Egyptian fashion. Height 97/s inches. Museum purchase, 1954. PORTRAIT OF ARSINOË III Hellenistic period, late second century B.c. This marble head is an Alexandrian work. As in the portrait of Ptolemy VI, the top was finished by the addition of a separate piece, probably of stucco, attached with dowels, but in this case the back of the head was also completed separately. On two planes converging at the rear, regular tool marks, apparently made by a drill, are still visible. The inner corners of the eyes and the outer corners of the mouth also reveal the use of a drill. The features are so smooth that the expression is detached and serene, and their effect is to recall the grandeur of fifth century work, albeit in a somewhat artificial manner. This sculpture is an example from the first Classical revival, whose most famous masterpiece is doubtless the Venus de Milo. On the basis of other heads and coins an identification as an idealized portrait of Arsinoë III, Queen of Egypt, has been suggested. This kind of Aegean island marble, with visible crystalline structure, was often imported to Alexandria; it is a cool white in its present state, recently cleaned. The head was found in Italy, and although its style is eclectic, the workmanship argues against labeling it an imitation of an earlier masterpiece. Ptolemy V, a son of Arsinoë III, built a temple to honor his mother, and there were statues of her throughout the capital city. The queen mother's glorification came rather belatedly, for Polybius reports she "endured insults and outrages inflicted on her during her whole life." Height 10% inches. Gift of Eliza Greene Radeke, 1905. NEGRO HEAD (left) Hellenistic, second to first century B.c. The hollow interior of this anthropomorphic container held a cosmetic accessible through a hinged top, now missing. The bust may be an adaptation from a statue created in the third century, when Ptolemy II brought Ethiopia once more under Egyptian control. Although the Negro had been represented earlier in Greek and Egyptian art, works such as this one, in which ethnological type and individual features are smoothly blended, testify to the cosmopolitan nature of the Hellenistic age. This head is one of the extremely rare examples surviving in bronze; the type is commoner in terracotta. Presumably made for sale, it displays a discreet fusion of commercialism and artistry. The circular opening in the hair is one of two fastenings for a handle. Height 7 inches. Gift of Eliza Greene Radeke, 1911. 155</page><page sequence="7">BRONZE SITULA (right) Etruscan, sixth century b.c. Here is a commonplace object which has become a work of beauty at the hands of Etruscan craftsmen. The surface of the situla, or bucket, is divided into three principal bands of repoussé decoration, each contributing, by its subject matter and design, to an understanding of these forerunners of the Romans. The uppermost zone reveals a number of people of various ages playing pipes, waving fans, or jovially imbibing from wassail bowls. One pair of athletically in- clined youths wield objects resembling dumb-bells in the attitude of boxers. Illustrations of boxers in Roman works reveal their use of similar implements. Note the wine bowl and stand with ad- dorsed birds' heads between the athletes. Like the top band, the center one constitutes a frieze of profile figures. Here, however, all are infantrymen marching to the left around the situla. At the extreme right is the first of four soldiers, presumably auxiliaries, whose helmets are conical rather than pot- bellied in shape. The bottom zone depicts mythical bovine animals with fantastic and varied horns or antlers. The entire situla is made of a single sheet of thin bronze, whose upper and lower edges are rolled around heavy strands of wire. It is one of an extremely rare type, produced perhaps in Bologna, where it was found. Height 10% inches. Museum purchase, 1932. GOLD FIBULA Etruscan, from Vetulonia, mid-seventh century B.c. An ancestor of today's safetv pin, this fibula belongs to a group known as the "leech" type. Most of the pin is enclosed in a long sheath ; the gathered fabric was inserted beneath a hollow bulbous bow at the end. The whole fibula is richly decorated with granular ornamentation, soldered to the gold background, thus making the fibula a piece of jewelry rather than a mundane object of rich, glittering material. A maeander pattern runs the length of the sheath and frames the scene on the bow. Here is depicted the Magna Mater of the Etruscans, a goddess of Oriental derivation, in rigid frontality, with her retinue of mythical beasts and monsters as well as dogs and stags, apparently floating freely in space. Style and composition match the vigor and expansive tendencies of Etruscan life during this period, when Vetulonia was the center of a fine goldsmith industry. Length 3% inches. Museum purchase, 1930. STATUETTE OF A WARRIOR Etruscan, later sixth century B.c. This bronze was made during the period when, through military conquest, the Etruscans dominated the Italian peninsula from the Alps to Campania. The figure thus repre- sents a people at the height of its power, and the martial attitude recalls Etruscan prowess in the art of war. The soldier is depicted striding forcefully forward. The helmet with its huge feathered crest was characteristic of the Etruscan warrior. It enabled his fellow soldiers to distinguish him in the heat of battle and increased the effect of apparent height, making him psychologically more formidable. The armor on this figurine is adorned with incised lines. Originally he held a large shield, and his raised right hand wielded a sword. The slim silhouette of this magnificent little figure, whose seasoned and tough physique is indicated by a wiry tenseness, conveys throughout an impression of heroic invincibility. The purpose of the statuette, placed as a votive offering in a sanctuary, may have been to guarantee in real life the resolute behavior here expressed in effigy. Height 9V2 inches. Museum purchase, 1934. GREEK AND ETRUSCAN ART ^0 156</page><page sequence="8">MALE STATUETTE Etruscan, early fifth century b.c. The model for this small bronze was clearly the Greek style of the late Archaic period, yet the facial proportions and angularity of modeling throughout the whole figure characterize the work as Etruscan. The difference can be ob- served by comparing this figure with the Greek Boeotian kouros shown on page 151. Chest, thorax and abdomen are stylized in a manner not too closely related to nature. The bodily proportions are fairly accurate except for an oversized head. This last feature gives the statuette its alert air, making articulate what is already expressed through the arms and stiffened feet. Who is represented is not known. It may be the Etruscan Hermes, Turms, bearing the emblems of his divinity. The sharp prominent nose is similar to the wedge- shaped nose of the Etruscan warrior. This figure, however, reveals an indebtedness to the contemporary Greek plastic idiom. The modeling is both more summary and more positive than Greek work, and is worthy of attention on its own account. Height 68/ 1« inches; with ancient base (concealed) 7% inches. Purchased in memory of Eliza Greene Radeke, 1957. BRONZE CINERARY URN Etruscan, early fifth century b.c. This vessel for receiving the ashes of the dead is one of a group whose provenience is Capua, though the origin of this particular one is not precisely known. The body and lid are of hammered bronze, while the four winged horses are cast from the same metal. The bulbous outline of this example suggests an early fifth century date, when Etruscan control over Campania had brought native artisans into close contact with the Greek colonists. On the shoulder of the urn appears a simple tongue motif, and the area below is adorned with, a palmette and tendril pattern, all very delicately incised. The four winged horses leaping around the cover are of considerable artistic interest, for their necks are blocked out in a geo- metric, almost angular, manner, while body, legs and tail are more cylindrical. The rim with the horses is detachable, and does not form part of the cover, the handle of which is missing. Height 14% inches, diameter 13% inches. Museum purchase, 1930. 157</page></plain_text>
