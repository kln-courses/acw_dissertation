In China, " originally, any metallic tool or implement of small size, or even a lump of metal, was used in barter : " ' the import of which statement is fully borne out by numismatic experience. Paléographie numismatists, who study the science from their own point of view, naturally limit their investiga- tions to the ancient inscribed money. Not so with archaeological numis- matic students, who, on the other hand, eagerly welcome and include in their research all primitive articles used in barter. There is perhaps no other country in the world, ancient or modern, that can trace in such a convincing and positive manner the ultimate source of its currency2 as is the case with China, and prove so conclusively its own evolu- tion.3 Coinage, in most cases, is said to have been invented 4 or discovered,5 while China's ancient currency system was derived, step by step, from objects of daily use.6 Commencing with the original and serviceable implements or tools, their employment in barter or exchange was the first step. Their gradual reduction in size, not only as a means of economy, but also to adapt them better to their new found use, was merely a matter of time. When they reached a convenient stage and ultimately accommodated themselves to this end, they assumed a token value, since, in their altered condition, they were no longer serviceable for the original purpose for which the models, from which they were derived, were primarily intended. The inscription being added, their final transformation was complete, and they then attained the status of current money.7 Various strange objects have found their way into the pages of Chinese numismatic treatises, both native and foreign,8 which their authors reckoned as money. Among this early token currency, the "carapace" money9 Ç ^ may be considered as one of the most curious. It is certainly the least known, as the evidence hitherto obtainable concerning it, either from litera- ture on the subject or from actual specimens, has been very meagre. i "Catalogue of Chinese Coins, etc.," by Terrien de Lacouperie, 1892, page 1, 2 Links between coined and uncoined money may certainly " herald the approach of actual coined money," but do not prove its ultimate origin. " Minoan Weights and Currency," by Arthur J. Evans, in "Corolla Nu- mismatica," 1906, p. 336 et seq. 3 Implements of practical and daily use were pri- marily employed in barter. Examples marking the intermediate stages allow us to follow the gradual transitional period from the original articles themselves to the final stage of token money. 4 " As early as the Vlth century B. C., it was believed that the Lydians were the inventors of coinage," (vide Hill's Historical Greek Coins," 1906, p. 1). 5 " With the knowledge of metals and their uses and value . . . came the discovery that a simplification of the process [of barter] was possible, as well as desir- able." Rawling's " Coins and how to know them," 1908, p. 4. 6 Hoes and spades, knives and swords, bells and other musical instruments, etc. 7 Knife and spade coins, with their derivatives. 8 Most foreign authors limit this uninscribed cur- rency to Bridge or Tingle Dangle and Lily-root money. The Bell money has only been lately added. (Rose's " Chinesischen Münzen.") 9 This name is due, probably, to the shape and design of the objects themselves, rather than to the ancient custom of using tortoise-shell in barter.</page><page sequence="2">AMERICAN JOURNAL OF NUMISMATICS. 71 That rare native work, the Ch'ien Pu T'ung Chih, by £&amp;|?ij, the richest in historical data among all Chinese numismatic treatises, is probably the only one in existence to-day which describes this kind of money. While classifying it under " unassigned " or " unplaced " coins, it quotes the Liu She Ch'ien Chih, $ļ| a work known to us only by reference, which is apparently the first to mention this peculiar currency. The obverse or upper side is said to be like the back of a tortoise, with scales (?), while the lower side is hollow, traversed by two " roads." It is assigned to a country or region ^ flg HH which I have been unable to recognize. It further cites the Hung She Ch'ien Chih, ļ£j^.iž, a treatise to-day unprocurable, in which this money is described more or'less as in the preceding, but with the addi- tional information that it belonged to the time of the Emperor Wu Ti gg, ļļfr of the Han Dynasty. In summing up, the Ch'ien Pu T'ung Chih states that the two authors mentioned above are in error, but advances no new material or evidence with which to substantiate this charge. On the contrary, notwithstanding the fact that the piece in question is said to have been a faithful copy, which he illustrates, of the original, it is not so very clear that the author ever set eyes on an actual specimen, as the verbal description is most confusing and uncertain. The illustration of this piece, showing both upper and lower sides, is here reproduced from the Ch'ien Pu T'ung Chih. It is again ascribed to a different region % H which I cannot place for the moment. Many specimens of early Chinese currency have come under my notice, but it was only last year, during my trip to the interior of that country, that I was fortunate enough to come across some examples of this rare token money. I had never before heard of their having been known outside the pages of native numismatic treatises. The lot that came into my possession was dug out of the earth near Honan-fu, and numbers twenty pieces, comprising four different and distinct classes, as follows : - A. Twelve circular or round-shaped pieces, one only of which bears a design or orna- mentation. Plate 1 6, 1-5. B. Two shell-shaped pieces, differing slightly in design. Plate 16, 6 and 7. C. Four double tube or cylinder- shaped pieces, cut longitudinally in half. Plate 16, 8 and 9. D. Two shield-shaped pieces with anthropomorphic device. Plate 16, 10.</page><page sequence="3">72 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF NUMISMATICS. In all of the above specimens there are bars crossing the concave or lower sides. One was evidently sufficient for the disc-shaped pieces, while two parallel bars were apparently needed to maintain the elongated ones in position. They were all cast in one piece, and appear to have had little or no wear. The composition of the metal is more like that of the ancient Chinese mirrors than of the early token currency of that country.1 A green patina covers all the specimens under notice, this being a natural consequence, since they were found together in one place. I am convinced that these small objects, or more probably their originals, must primarily have been of some service or use to man, as in China the practical, and not the ornamental, has always been sought for. After a close and minute examination of the examples before us, I am inclined to suggest that they are miniature representations of either shields or horse trappings, both solutions being equally acceptable as in accordance with the nature and object of the other token money of ancient China.2 Yokohama, April, iqii.
