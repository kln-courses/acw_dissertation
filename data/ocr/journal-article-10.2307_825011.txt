<plain_text><page sequence="1">Bernard M. Dickens* INFORMATION FOR CONSENT IN HUMAN EXPERIMENTATIONt I Introduction Ever since the 1948 Nuremberg Code on scientific human experimentation articulated the principle that the subject shall be informed of 'the nature, duration and purpose of the experiment, the method and means by which it is to be conducted, all inconveniences and hazards reasonably to be ex- pected, and the effects upon his health or person which may possibly come from his participation in the experiment,'1 no doubt has remained as to the researcher's ethical obligation to obtain the subject's freely given and prop- erly informed consent. So widely accepted has this ethical imperative be- come, however, that the distinctively legal elements of informed consent to human experimentation are not often isolated, and the limits to the researcher's legal obligation to supply information have rarely been consi- dered. The matter is by no means confined to the practice of medicine, although the field of experimentation by the physician and psychiatrist has attracted most literature on the quality and requirements of the subject's consent, perhaps under the impetus of the Nuremberg Trials. This present approach to experimentation will almost inevitably have a strongly medical orienta- tion, directed by the bulk of published materials, including judgments. It is recognized in all fields of human research, however, that consent means consent in substance and not merely in form.2 Consent requires more than the subject's signature or the non-resistant submission of his will to that of the researcher's, since to be genuine it must meet a criterion of intellectual * Visiting Research Professor, Faculty of Law, University of Toronto. t I am indebted to my colleague, Professor Horace Krever QC, for his critical comments on a draft of this article, and for references to materials.

The subject must in principle have an understanding and cor- rectly informed awareness of what is implied in reaching his decision to consent.3 The medical field stricto sensu may actually accommodate proper treatment to which the patient's consent is not fully informed, or to which his specific consent is not sought at all. The special relation of trust between doctor And patient bears the implication that the patient consents to reason- able measures intended to assist him in his special circumstances, and part of the patient's therapy may require him not to know of certain features of his condition or the treatment he is to receive.4 Within the context of conscien- tious therapy, there may be an ethically and legally acceptable withholding of information for consent, sometimes described as the physician's 'therapeutic privilege,'5 because the treatment is designed exclusively for the patient's benefit. Where investigation of a human subject is designed not for his benefit, however, but for the gathering of information for the wider community, possibly including the subject but not in his specific capacity (that is, not as a 'patient'), different considerations apply, which it is the purpose of this article to examine, primarily in the context of the law applicable in Canada.6 In particular, it is proposed to consider the limits to the information the researcher is legally bound to supply to the subject upon whom he wishes to engage in experimentation. Therapeutic treatment of a patient often has experimental features, of course, in the sense that the physician confronts the unknown, and the results of his treatment will be of interest and use, if only as a cautionary instance, to other practitioners and their patients. There is an inevitable practical overlap between therapy and experimentation justifying the ex- pression 'experimental therapeutics,' and the attempt theoretically to sepa- rate the two activities may be largely futile. Nevertheless, for present pur- poses the distinction will be drawn in terms of intent: in therapy, the physician intends exclusively to assist the patient, whatever spin-off for scientific knowledge may result from the treatment, whereas in experimen- tation the researcher intends to use the subject to assist him, even if the subject derives some advantage or satisfaction from his collaboration.7 A distinction of this nature, between experiments intended for the 3 The issue of consent to experimentation on minors, the insane, and the unconscious therefore raises particular legal and ethical problems, but these lie beyond the scope of this article. 4 For severe reactions to medical disclosure, see Ferrara v Gulluchio, (1958), 5 N.Y. 2d. 16, and Furniss v Fitchett, [1958] N.Z.L.R. 398. 5 See, for instance, Smith, 'Therapeutic Privilege to Withhold Specific Diagnosis from Patient Sick with Serious or Fatal Illness,' (1946), 19 Tenn.

Further, in The Human Body and the Law (1970), David W. Meyers noted that 'If the law is to deal satisfactorily with experimentation, it will need to recognize this distinc- tion between therapeutic and non-therapeutic purpose more clearly than it has to date.'9 A limitation of the therapy-experiment dichotomy may be its failure easily to accommodate organ removal for transplantation, since surgery of this nature is neither experimental nor physically therapeutic for the donor, although his sacrifice or guilt-avoidance1o may be considered of psychological benefit to him."1 Such benefit would appear to render non- essential cosmetic surgery therapeutic, and allow ritual circumcision, includ- ing that of infants upon parental consent. Philanthropic blood donation is also therapeutic on this basis, although the sale of blood is validated by more material benefit to the donor, and may be considered on a commercial rather than a therapeutic footing.12 This reasoning further subverts a simple therapy-experiment division, however, since many subjects of pure ex- perimentation receive satisfaction of their philanthropic instincts and/or a payment. Nevertheless, for the purposes of analysis in principle, the distinc- tion will be pursued from the point of view of the qualified participant in the scientific relation between treatment intended to assist the patient's physical and emotional well-being, and experimentation intended to gain knowledge for its own value and for the benefit of society at large. A difficulty in analysing experimentation in this refined sense is that only one judicial decision clearly on this matter appears to have been recorded in common law jurisdictions.13 Available decisions concerning qualified per- sonnel, although frequently expressed in the language of experimentation, have almost all arisen from alleged malpractice in administering therapy or, especially in Canada, from assault claims arising from intended therapy 8 See(1962),2Brit.

C.A.), where the subject's only benefit in volunteering for what proved to be a hazardous and damaging experiment was a payment of $50. Hyman v Jewish Chronic Disease Hospital, (1964), 251 N.Y.S. 2d 818, had the elements of a leading case, but the court hearing involved only a procedural point of evidence: it remains, however, as a leading incident, and, recalling the origin of the Nuremberg Code, an anguishing irony, when live cancer cells were experi- mentally injected without informed consent into twenty-two chronically ill non-cancer patients; see Katz, supra note 1, at 9-65.</page><page sequence="4">384 UNIVERSITY OF TORONTO LAWJOURNAL performed without or beyond consent;14 indeed, from early times a therapist's negligent departure from the standard treatment of his patient's condition was described as 'experimentation,' the use of the word being invariably censorious.15 The underlying social premise of this study is that, in principle, research, in fields by no means confined to the medical, serves the public interest in promising improved knowledge and care.16 It is also understood that in- formation obtained from a human experiment will not be applied oppres- sively against the subject himself nor abused for tyrannical or commercial purposes. The premise that research is socially beneficial in advancing the frontiers of knowledge is not devalued by the realization that the researcher himself is frequently motivated in part, perhaps decisively, by his own career ambitions," and that he may fall victim to the allure of popular acclaim and sensationalize his findings; it is accepted for present purposes that the researcher, of whatever discipline, maintains proper scientific integrity. Rejection of this basic social premise, or espousal of a contrary premise, for instance that research, illustrated by forms of psychological, psychosurgical, and biological research, tends to be socially harmful, may result in a differ- ent interpretation of what the law requires of an experimenter.s18 2 The range of experimentation Controlled procedures of enquiry into human and social functioning have been developed in many institutions. Hospitals and other such medical and psychiatric bodies have become a primary location of experimental proce- dures and a focal point of concern about abuse.19 Researchers into sociologi- 14 See Rozovsky, supra note 6, at 104. Bonner v Moran, 126 F. 2d. 121 (D.C. Cir. 1941) involved a finding of assault and battery committed on a fifteen year-old boy on whom non-therapeutic and exceptional procedures were used without parental consent: this may not necessarily be followed, however, since the capacity of a person under majority to consent to minor surgery has become increasingly recognized; see Skegg, 'Consent to Medical Procedures on Minors,' (1973), 37 M.L.R. 370. 15 The confusion between therapy and experimentation is traced and resolved in Ladimer, supra note 7, at 475-85. For present purposes, treatment of a newly observed medical condition, for which medical knowledge discloses no standard treatment, will be consi- dered as therapy by reason of the physician's intention to assist his patient. 16 Supported, for example, by the observation in 1965 that the typical physician relied on drugs developed since 1950 in about ninety per cent of patient prescriptions: Haggins, 'Due Care by Physicians in Use of New Drugs,' (1965), 14 Clev.-Mar. L.R. 506, at 508. 17 See Barber, Lalley, Makarushka, and Sullivan Research on Human Subjects (1973), chs 4 and 5. 18 Such a contrary premise would find historical authority in law, since in the eighteenth century medical experimentation as then understood was considered a constant danger, undertaken only at the physician's severe peril: see Slater v Baker and Stapleton, (1767), 2 Wils. [K.B.] 359, approved in Carpenter v Blake 60 Barb. 488 (N.Y. 1871), reversed on other grounds 50 N.Y. 696 (1872) 19 See, for example, Pappworth Human Guinea Pigs (1967).</page><page sequence="5">INFORMATION FOR CONSENT IN HUMAN EXPERIMENTATION 385 cal phenomena,20 however, and such diverse interests as economic activity, educational efficiency, and public and private communication also employ techniques of human monitoring and measurement on a wide scale for the scientific advancement of knowledge. Even the legal field is not innocent of such research; in 1954 a team of Chicago scholars at Wichita, Kansas, bugged a jury room, with the permission of judge and counsel, in a cele- brated experiment,21 and tests of the effects of legal provisions are today quite commonplace.22 The use of human subjects as direct participants in an experiment ethi- cally requires a degree of consent, and the same may be true of their indirect participation. Those whose spontaneous behaviour is just passively ob- served, by natural or mechanical means, may be required to give consent in the special sense that the conduct in question is voluntary and publicly performed, and is such that the actors realize they may be overlooked, even if not in the purposeful and disciplined way of the researcher. Private or intimate conduct may not be ethically available for this scientific purpose without a greater degree of consent, even when approaching the potential subject destroys the spontaneity of the conduct intended to be observed. Human dignity may demand this recognition. It cannot be presumed, however, that ethical and legal principles are necessarily coterminous in this area. Observation, including photography and tape-recording, of private conduct without consent has often been undertaken for criminal detection and prevention, in which there is, of course, a notable measure of public interest, and evidence of private conduct which is not criminal may also be legally admissible for the purposes of more private litigation, often in evidencing adultery. Even outside litigation, the common law approach to simple observation, including mechanical record- ing, does not adopt the ethical perspective of positively protecting the subject's unique human worth. If physical integrity remains unaffected in that no trespass or injury to the person or mind of the subject occurs, and no confidence given to the observer is breached, no illegality would appear to have been committed. It follows that, in the absence of specific legislation, private employee security screening and individual credit rating may be conducted by analysis of private conduct and means, affording the subject no method of correction nor legal redress. The law permits more than is ethically valid, since the law on individual privacy is undeveloped in Canada, as in many other jurisdictions.23 This has encouraged several commentators 20 See, for example, Angell in Lazarsfeld, Sewell, and Wilensky (eds) The Uses of Sociology (1967), 725 et seq. 2 1 See Kalven Jr and Zeisel The American Jury (1966), and Katz, supra note 1, at 67-109. 22 See Katz, ibid., at 333-6. 23 The Protection of Privacy Act, now embodied in section 178 of the Criminal Code, protects the privacy of private communications from mechanical interception, but does not in itself constitute a general law of privacy. Greater protection of privacy exists in the privacy acts</page><page sequence="6">386 UNIVERSITY OF TORONTO LAWJOURNAL within the scientific community to advocate ethical self-discipline, for in- stance by editors refusing to publish unethically obtained information, or requiring authors to state fully their method of obtaining consent.24 The breadth of procedures constituting human experimentation, includ- ing passive observation, is reflected in the guidelines laid down by the Research Board of the University of Toronto which require the submission for approval of projects using human subjects. These guidelines are not necessarily representative of practice in Canada, or even in the province of Ontario, but they have been followed by the University of Western Ontario. They provide that: The policy of the University on the use of human subjects will apply to your research if, in the course of your investigation, A You will administer a drug, take a blood sample, do a test, or perform any procedure, clinical, therapeutic or otherwise, upon the person of yourself or someone else, for research rather than treatment. B You will ask people questions whether by telephone, letter, survey, questionnaire, or interview. c You will be using non-public records (e.g., not the telephone book) which contain identifying information about anyone. D You will be observing anyone's responses or behaviour, either directly or indi- rectly. If your research will involve human subjects and you, the facilities you will use, or the subjects you will use are associated with the University, your research must be reviewed by a Review Committee on the use of human subjects under the auspices of the Research Board. Regarding the research proposal (or protocol), the University Research Board advises that: The subjects for your investigation and your method of gathering them should be described. The place where the investigation will be carried out should be defined, and it is important to indicate who will be responsible for contacting the subjects and how they will be contacted initially. It is very important that the committee be told what you will tell the subjects before they participate. The outlines go further on informed consent, requiring answers to: What explanation will you give to the subjects before they agree to become of British Columbia (Stats B.C. 1968, c 39) and Manitoba (Stats Man. 1970, c 74), which were relevant to an important discussion in the Ontario Court of Appeal in Krouse v Chrysler Canada Ltd, (1973), 40 D.L.R.

What is the competence of your subjects to consent? (The competence of a person to consent may well be affected by age, mental or physical state, or restraint of liberty.) If the subject is not competent, who will consent? What form of consent will be used? Free and informed consent, in writing, is required in most cases, so please submit a consent form with your protocol. 3 The legal groundrules It can be demonstrated that the University Research Board guidelines exceed legal requirements, but this is not adverse criticism since they are intended to cover ethical requirements; these, it has been seen, embrace more than is legally necessary. While it is usually considered unethical to fall below legally prescribed standards, the law may be satisfied by practices violating ethical principles, in human experimentation as in much else. The legal relevance of consent in experimentation is negative rather than positive. Consent does not justify the experiment but it makes legally defen- sible conduct that would be legally actionable in the absence of any other defence, such as statutory duty or right, or perhaps the somewhat uncertain defence of necessity.25 It is not proposed here to give more than a most general outline of the effect of consent as it operates in the law of crime and tort, and to point out the applicability of contractual principles; more par- ticular aspects will be discussed in context later. A CRIMINAL LAW PRINCIPLES There are obvious legal limits to the experiences to which an individual may willingly submit himself, as a cursory study of the law on attempted suicide and euthanasia will show; section 14 of the Canadian Criminal Code26 provides that, 'No person is entitled to consent to have death inflicted upon him.' It is indeed a general principle that the private consent of the party suffering a criminal offence, which by definition tends to the detriment of the public, does not excuse the party committing it. Life-and-death in- stances, however, including non-therapeutic abortion, do not show the difficulty. It is the intermediate range of offences against the person, cen- tring on assault, that lacks a desirable certainty as to whether consent consti- tutes a substantive legal defence, or only a mitigating factor in sentence upon 25 Which may justify therapeutic procedure in emergency; see Leigh v Gladstone, (1909), 26 T.L.R. 139 on forcible feeding of a suffragette, R v Bourne, [1939] 1 K.B. 687 on abortion (with consent) to save the health of a girl pregnant by rape, and, on parental conviction for manslaughter by denial of treatment necessary for a child's health, R v Lewis (1903), 7 c.c.c. 261 (Ont. C.A.). In R v Morgentaler a jury's acquittal of an abortionist invoking the defence of necessity ((1973), 14 c.c.c. (2d) 435) was reversed by the Quebec Court of Appeal (( 1974), 17 c.c.c. (2d) 289) and judgment is now pending in the Supreme Court of Canada. 26 R.S.C. 1970, c C-34</page><page sequence="8">388 UNIVERSITY OF TORONTO LAW JOURNAL conviction. Modern English criminal law showed uncertainty in considering consent to indecent assault27 and sterilisation,28 and an established Ameri- can text, having stated on assault that, 'As a general rule, if the prosecutor intelligently assented, this is a good defence,' adds that, 'On the other hand ... if the assault be of a nature injurious to the public as well as to the party assaulted, this reasoning does not apply.'29 Regarding substantial or traditional crimes (as opposed to what are vari- ously described, and often dismissed, as regulatory or administrative of- fences or quasi-crimes), evolving criteria of public policy and the degree of personal harm caused or risked have frequently guided the courts' determi- nations. These same criteria were judicially applied when the common law was a thin tissue covering a feudal skeleton; a severe injury constituted a mayhem (later 'maim') if it made the victim less able to fight for the king or for himself.30 Thus, in R v Wright in 16o3, 1 where a youth consented to a friend cutting off his left hand to make him more appealing as a beggar, they were both convicted of a common law misdemeanour amounting to unlaw- ful maiming. This decision may have been influenced by an economic incentive to punish voluntary incapacitation from work, since the disabled were a charge upon the local community or Poor Law union, but Stephen's Digest of the Criminal Law, appearing as late as 1894, records as an offence voluntary extraction of their front teeth by soldiers having to bite cartridges as part of their drill.32 The antique origin of the English common law, compounded by tenacious precedent, not only has obstructed recognition of modern scientific ex- perimentation as a valid procedure separate from therapeutic surgery, but has prevented firm acknowledgment of therapeutic surgery itself. A cutting of the body remains in principle a species of assault, occasionally called, to the outrage of English therapeutic surgeons, assault with intent to cause grievous bodily harm (although justifiable by express or implied consent).33 The Canadian Criminal Code, on the other hand, accommodates the fact of modern medicine, providing in section 45 that: Every one is protected from criminal responsibility for performing a surgical opera- tion upon any person for the benefit of that person if a the operation is performed with reasonable care and skill, and b it is reasonable to perform the operation, having regard to the state of health of the person at the time the operation is performed and to all the circumstances of the case. 27 See R v Donovan, [1934) 2 K.B. 498. 28 See Denning LJ dissenting in Bravery v Bravery, [19541 3 All E.R. 59- 29 Wharton 1 CriminalLaw(12th ed 1932) 1122 30 So, for instance, Blackstone considered castration a maim, probably by reason of its psychological effects: 4 Bl.

This provision protects orthodox therapeutic treatment,34 but whether pure experimentation falls within the formula is very doubtful. Hazardous experimentation with a fatal outcome may well expose the researcher to section 2o8, which provides that: 'Where a person causes to a human being a bodily injury that is of itself of a dangerous nature and from which death results, he causes the death of that human being notwithstand- ing that the immediate cause of death is proper or improper treatment that is applied in good faith.' The subject's consent to risk the'bodily injury that is of itself of a dangerous nature' affords no prima facie relief from liability. On the other hand, experimentation that is not personally dangerous in this way is saved by consent from amounting to assault, since section 244 pro- vides that: 'A person commits an assault when, without the consent of another person or with consent, where it is obtained by fraud, (a) he applies force intentionally to the person of the other, directly or indirectly.' Equally, where neither force nor the threat of force is applied, for instance in observing or questioning, the possibility of criminal assault does not arise, unless perhaps the subject is induced to act to his own detriment, in a manner amounting to fraudulent indirect force. The general position of a medical researcher, however, is at present beyond profound analysis in the face of both the open formula of section 45(b), giving immunity if 'it is reasonable to perform the operation, having regard ... to all the circum- stances of the case,' and the absence of any illustrations in reported cases.35 B TORT PRINCIPLES In principle a consenting party to tortious conduct cannot complain of the injury: volenti non fit injuria. At the risk of emphasizing the obvious, Lord Denman cj observed that 'it is a manifest contradiction in terms to say that the defendant assaulted the plaintiff by his permission.'36 Capacity to give consent has been questioned in some cases concerning the young and the mentally abnormal, many cases have probed the circumstances from which unexpressed consent may be implied, and most cases have turned upon the factual limits of treatment to which express or implied consent was given, 'surgical assault' being committed by treatment beyond those limits. Intervention without or in excess of consent technically constitutes the tort of battery, covering deliberate but unauthorized touching or bodily 34 And the actions of the careful lay 'good Samaritan.' (Physically) non-therapeutic treatment to remove tissue for transplantation is covered by consent given under section 3 of the Human Tissue Gift Act, 1971, (Stats Ont. 1971, c 83) in Ontario, and analogous provisions of other provinces; see 'Provincial law for giving transplant material moving toward uniformity,' (1973), io8 C.M.A.J., 1445- 35 An unreported civil case in the Ontario Supreme Court, Chivers and Chivers v Weaver and McIntyre, considered consent the only issue in ruling on an assault action for performance of voluntary sterilization, suggesting the operation is not unlawful in Ontario; see Black, 'Abortion and Sterilisation,' (1961), 33 Man. Bar News 33, at 42-3. 36 Christopherson v Bare (1848), 1 1 Q.B. 473, at 477</page><page sequence="10">390 UNIVERSITY OF TORONTO LAW JOURNAL interference;37 mere inaction, for instance in deciding not to treat a patient or an affected subject serving as an experimental control, cannot create battery, although the tort of negligence may apply. Implied consent is often recognized for therapeutic procedures in emergency, and an experiment to which consent was given may by misfortune create such an emergency, when the medical researcher may have to revert to the role of caring physician, but research is not an emergency in itself (see section io, infra). In legal practice the distinction between assault and battery often appears academic, in the less appealing sense of that word. Assault is the intentional creation in another of apprehension (which is less than fear),38 and since assault is so often rapidly followed by battery, the two offences are often described together, or simply called assault. In human experimentation, however, the distinction may be significant, since assault may cover deliber- ately causing apprehensions in a non-consenting subject when there is no intention that he should actually experience what he has been led to ap- prehend. Consent may be destroyed by the researcher's misrepresentation of facts given when inducing it, so that later touching is battery. In addition, how- ever, misrepresentation is actionable in itself, even without touching, al- though usually invoked in financial or commercial causes. A derivative tort is that of deceit, but W.L. Prosser's authoritative analysis concludes that 'the law of misrepresentation is thus considerably broader than the action for deceit. Liability in damages for misrepresentation, in one form or another, falls into the three familiar divisions ... it may be based upon intent to deceive, upon negligence, or upon a policy which requires the defendant to be strictly responsible for his statements without either.'39 J.G. Fleming reinforces the last point in observing that 'a duty of disclosure is demanded when the parties stand in some fiduciary relation to each other.'40 The conscientious researcher will be neither intentionally deceptive41 nor negligent, but he may be considered to stand in a fiduciary relation with his subject by analogy with the physician-patient relation.42 The therapist is relieved of his duty of disclosure when information would not be in the patient's interests,43 but the experimental subject has no beneficial interest 37 Such as causing a person to fall to the ground by pulling away his chair; see Hopper v Reeve, (1817), 7 Taunt. 698, at 7oo. 38 Imposing the experience of falling after removal of the chair, above, for example, would be assault. 39 Handbook of the Law of Torts (4th ed 197 1), at 684 40 Law of Torts (4th ed 1971), at 555 41 But, for instance in the field of medical education, see Blackwell, Bloomfield, and Buncher, 'Demonstration to Medical Students of Placebo Responses and Non-Drug Fac- tors,' The Lancet, loJune, 1972. 42 See Natanson v Kline, (196o), 350 P. 2d. 1093 (Sup.

Accordingly, the researcher is bound to act uberrimaefidei and make full and frank disclosure in order to have the protection of the subject's valid consent. C CONTRACT PRINCIPLES The modern patient-plaintiff appears little inclined to have recourse to the law of contract, an attitude perhaps reinforced by the advent of health services remunerated from private insurance companies or governmentally organized funds, such as exist under, for instance, the Ontario Health Insurance Plan and the United Kingdom's National Health Service. Nevertheless, contractual agreements underlie not only most medical therapy but also experimentation, inside and beyond the medical context; indeed, the celebrated 1767 case condemning medical 'experimentation,' Slater v Baker and Stapleton,44 was pleaded in contract. The contractual frame of reference brings out the distinction between therapy and experimenta- tion with particular clarity, in a major and minor way. The minor distinction is that in therapy the layman pays the specialist, whereas in experimentation the specialist often pays the layman. The major distinction, however, is that the therapeutic contract will be confined to achievement of the patient's health benefit and will exclude experimentation (as now understood), whereas the experimentation contract defines for the subject the only benefit the researcher actually intends him to have, usually in the form of a money payment. In return the subject affords consideration in the tradi- tional sense, either giving the experimenter 'some right, interest, profit or benefit,' or becoming bound by 'some forbearance, detriment, loss or re- sponsibility given, suffered or undertaken.'45 The contractual nature of the experimentation relation is usually em- phasized only at its most negative point, when the subject signs the consent form, gaining a right to specified payment and yielding his right to sue on the contract. In the Halushka case, for instance, the subject's consent in- cluded the term: 'in consideration of the remuneration hereafter set forth, I do release the chief investigators, Drs. - and -, their associates, technicians, and each thereof, other personnel involved in these studies, the University Hospital Board, and the University of Saskatchewan from all responsibility and claims whatsoever, for any untoward effects or accidents due to or arising out of said tests, either directly or indirectly.' Such immunity as this clause provided was confined to contractual matters, the plaintiff succeeding in showing assault in a tort action, and recovering judgment for the sum of $22,500. Even the contractual protection afforded the defendant by this consent formula is less than complete, however, because the researchers may be in 44 See note 18, supra. 45 This test in Currie v Misa, (1875), L.R. 10 Ex. 153, at 162 has been widely approved in Canadian courts.</page><page sequence="12">392 UNIVERSITY OF TORONTO LAW JOURNAL breach of implied collateral undertakings, irrespective of what happens in the conduct of the experiment. These undertakings may attach to such matters as their qualifications to undertake the experiment and the objective competence of their research design and methodology, so that if the subject loses confidence in the efficiency of his treatment he may not simply with- draw (which he may be able to do at any time without good reason, subject to his contractual liability: see section 7, infra), but himself initiate the conten- tion of the researcher's breach of contract, and claim compensation for his losses, both financial and otherwise; establishment of contractual liability, of course, need not depend upon the subject proving assault or negligence in operation. A further advantage of contractual liability is that it may accom- modate action for breach of confidence more easily than does tort law, even though principles of quantification of damages may coincide. Curiously, the potential of the contractual concept may be revealed by studying tortious liability, for instance on the issue of misrepresentation as to implied terms, since the modern preference to act in tort often presupposes a contractual relation. It has been noted that 'By using the distinction between ex contractu and ex delicto, the courts shifted almost all actions based on the breach of implied contractual terms to tort,'46 and it therefore remains open to the patient-plaintiff to attempt to revert to the original contractual basis of liability if he finds it of advantage, for instance in overcoming limitation periods or the need to show negligence and resultant damage. Identification of the contractual relation in experimentation imports routine issues in the substantive law of contract, affecting for example contractual capacity, mistake, illegality on grounds of public policy and misrepresentation, as well as adjective considerations concerning litigation and remedies. The distinctive points to observe, however, are the possible concurrence of contractual and tortious rights, obligations, and remedies in the experimentation agreement, subject to the effect of contractual exemp- tion clauses, and that the standard of pre-contract disclosure may be that of the utmost good faith, consistent with the fiduciary character of the relation in contract, as in tort. Policy arguments against the courts allowing a breach of contract action against a physician47 do not necessarily apply to the medical or non-medical experimenter, and, for instance, the physician's practice of giving therapeutic reassurance by using comforting expressions will quite probably be allowed far less scope. 4 The critical question Accepting that a legally valid consent to the subject's participation in a human experiment can be given, the critical question concerns the aspect of 46 Maynard, 'Establishing the Contractual Liability of Physicians,' in Problems in Law and Medicine ((1974) 7, U. Cal. Davis L.R.), at 84-1 12. 47 See generally Maynard, ibid, at 89-92.</page><page sequence="13">INFORMATION FOR CONSENT IN HUMAN EXPERIMENTATION 393 the research project to which his consent must be directed. It must be asked whether the subject must approve the entire purpose and scheme of the project, or whether it is legally sufficient that he be asked to consent only to what he will suffer in his own participation. It may be unethical, of course, positively to deceive the subject as to the researcher's full intention, but a distinction may be drawn between giving misinformation and confining correct information to matters pertinent to participation in part only of a research project. It does not follow that lack of more complete information vitiates genuine consent, and makes legally actionable the inconvenience, physical intrusions, or injury to which the subject knowingly agreed to submit himself. Instances of research projects to which potential subjects may agree in part but object in whole can be suggested in illustration. Illustration I A study may be designed of rates of recuperation, morbidity, and depression following therapeutic abortion by the 'vacuum suction' method, contrasting with rates following abortion by other methods and also following normal childbirth. Mothers may be asked to agree to answer a questionnaire, or to be examined by a physician or psychiatrist, or to have their medical files in- spected, in order to provide relevant statistics, with protection against per- sonal identification in their presentation. A mother who is devoutly Roman Catholic may be willing to consent to the questionnaire, examination, or file inspection regarding her own condition after childbirth, but may object to participation in a study showing which method of abortion is most advan- tageous, or that therapeutic abortion can be preferable to childbirth in certain pregnancies. The critical question is whether the mother is asked to consent to her participation in studying rates of recuperation, morbidity, and depression following childbirth, to which she might well consent, or whether she is asked to participate in a study showing the most beneficial circumstances and technique of abortion, to which she might object. The first request for consent represents the truth, but not the whole truth. Illustration 2 A study may be planned of the literacy of children undergoing a comparable educational experience in a school of mixed ethnic groups. A parent might not oppose his own child's involvement, including an examination of read- ing material coming into the home and testing of both parental interest in the child's school performance and siblings' powers of verbal communica- tion and comprehension. He might be less willing to participate, however, if informed that a conceivable result of the study will be to publicize that children of his ethnic group are educationally retarded, and less employable in the long term, by living in culturally deprived homes, and that other ethnic groups are more concerned with their children's scholastic welfare. The critical question is whether the parent's collaboration is sought in a</page><page sequence="14">394 UNIVERSITY OF TORONTO LAWJOURNAL study of his child's literary skills, which may interest the parent, or whether his participation is sought in a comparative study of educational privilege and underprivilege, or parental care and neglect, among children of differ- ent ethnic groups. The parent may object to this, especially if he is not confident of a creditable outcome. Equally, a parent of a privileged child may object because he is too confident of a favourable outcome, and fears publication of the research findings may pave the way to more egalitarianism in education, as did the psychiatric evidence in the famous American school segregation case, Brown v Board of Education of Topeka.48 Illustration 3 A study may involve testing the effects of prolonged lowering in body temperature (mild hypothermia) by asking various paid subjects to live for a period of time in controlled chilled surroundings on a defined diet, under- taking specified tasks. Such a study may attract volunteers from among the unemployed and the poorly paid and housed, who rarely enjoy high-quality medical attention. The purpose may be to test social welfare payments to indigents which include an allowance for the cost of domestic heating based on average requirements. It may be contended that people in poor housing, eating low quality foods, have physically adjusted to lower standards, and accordingly can maintain the standard of comfort to which they are accus- tomed on a lesser allowance. The critical question is whether prospective volunteers are to be told that they will be required to live in a specified environment under given condi- tions and be regularly examined, to be told that they will participate in a similarly described test of the adequacy of the heating allowance, or to be told that the test is to see whether and if so by how much the heating allowance may be reduced. 5 The dilemma To identify a dilemma in these situations is itself evaluative; there need be no dilemma at all if the required legal standard coincides with the standard of ethical purity and compels the potential subject to be informed of every intention formed by the researcher, and of every outcome the researcher conceives to be possible. The effect of observing this standard, however, will probably be to damage the social interest in accumulating research findings, since the potential subject will be fed facts and speculation unnecessary for him to reach a genuinely independent and adequately informed decision, and tending to make that decision negative. The purity of this approach may be purchased at too high a price in lost opportunities of social amelioration through research. A balance must be struck between the subject's interest in knowing to what his consent is sought, and the social interest in the subject's participation not 48 (1954), 347 U.s. 483, see especially 493-4-</page><page sequence="15">INFORMATION FOR CONSENT IN HUMAN EXPERIMENTATION 395 being deterred by the supply of information not essential for him to reach a decision to consent to what he will experience. It comes hard to a lawyer, aware of public confidence in the traditional aura of 'the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth' to contend that less than the whole truth will suffice. The dilemma, however, is in identifying the relevant truth; that part of the available whole which is indispensably necessary to inform consent and make it effective, and the omission of which vitiates consent and constitutes a fraud on the subject. It must be asked whether, having given consent to undergo the apparent risk and inconvenience of his part of the experiment, the subject may subsequently be able to object that his consent was ineffective because he was left unaware of other parts of the project in which he was not so personally involved. A patient may not be required, as a legal precondition to giving his consent, to receive full information of the actual techniques to be employed upon him,49 but a subject may have to know more of the over-all design of the research in which he will participate, and the general means of execu- tion. Consent lies at the centre of a jurisprudential melee that breaks out periodically in both criminal and civil courts. Consent obtained by fraud, committed by omitting or giving false information, is demonstrably no consent at all, but the quality of mistake that renders a person's consent invalid is less certain in any factual situation. In criminal law, 'the general rule is that if deception causes a misunderstanding as to the nature of the act itself there is no legally recognized consent because what happened is not that for which consent was given, whereas consent induced by fraud is as effective as any other consent, if the deceit relates not to the thing done but merely to some collateral matter.'50 Accordingly, an indecent assault convic- tion was upheld when an unqualified person practising publicly as a doctor conducted intimate examinations of six women, even though he 'acted in an entirely professional manner.'51 The women believed they were consenting to qualified medical examination, not simply personal examination by the accused, their mistake going to the very nature and quality of the act performed. In contrast, where a qualified doctor similarly examined a woman in the presence of an unqualified friend posing as a doctor, their convictions for indecent assault were quashed, since the doctor gave a medically proper (if unethical) examination, and his friend's mere presence, even by misrep- resentation, did not constitute an assault. The woman's consent to medical examination was fully informed, and not obtained by a false collateral representation as to the status of the observer.52 By analogy, if a researcher 49 SeeJohnston v Wellesley Hospital, [1971] 2 O.R. 103, at og9 (H.c.

(2d) 82 (s.c.c.)</page><page sequence="16">396 UNIVERSITY OF TORONTO LAWJOURNAL leaves his potential subject in no mistake as to the nature and quality of his participation in the project, for instance by stating that it is experimental, that it will require specified intrusions upon the body, mind, or confi- dentiality of the subject, and that defined areas of risk (if any) appear to exist, he may satisfy his obligations under the criminal law without disclosing col- lateral matters pertaining to the project. Whether the rule extracted from criminal cases, concerned with punish- ment upon proof beyond reasonable doubt, applies equally to tort, con- cerned with compensation upon proof on a balance of probabilities, is not clear; one leading English text submits that 'While there is reason for the rule in the criminal law, there is none in the law of tort. For the purposes of volenti non fit injuria it should be fully accepted that consent obtained by fraud is no consent.'53 Other authorities, however, do not immediately reject the criminal ratios, and, for instance, Fleming notes that, 'More uncertainty surrounds an intermediate group of situations where the plaintiff is aware of the real nature of the proposed contact but not its harmful or offensive quality, and the defendant conceals it with knowledge that disclosure would have induced the other to withhold consent.'54 On balance, however, he finds that 'the policy favouring acquittal in criminal cases has little weight in civil and should not be decisive in the present context.'55 The subject may therefore sue in tort with greater prospect of success than would attend a prosecution based on having received the same information. It may confidently be proposed that the subject is entitled to the fullest available information of any injury he may suffer directly or indirectly.56 If the legal requirement of informed consent exists to prevent the subject's exploitation, so that by giving information the researcher contributes to the autonomous quality of consent, it may follow that the amount of legally required information is to be assessed by asking not how much the subject knows of what he is being asked to experience, but how much the researcher knows (and should know). Since the researcher possesses all relevant facts available, and offers the potential subject information in order to induce his consent to suffer what, by definition, is intended not for his benefit but for the researcher's, it may seem right that the offer of information should be construed on analogy with the contra proferentem rule. This reasoning is reinforced by the contractual position, where the researcher has to dis- charge the duties of the fiduciary relationship, and cannot shield behind the principle caveat emptor. He is obliged, to avoid liability in both tort and contract, to take all efforts to see that the subject goes into the experiment with his eyes open, realizing, so far as reasonable care for his protection can ensure, what is at risk for him. The subject's consent is not legally required, 53 Winfield and Jolowicz Tort (9th ed 1971), at 630 54 Ibid, at 78 55 Ibid 56 Halushka v University of Saskatchewan, supra note 13</page><page sequence="17">INFORMATION FOR CONSENT IN HUMAN EXPERIMENTATION 397 of course, for what he will not experience; the issue therefore turns to what the careful researcher believes the subject will experience in participating in the project, and of what he must therefore be warned. 6 The risk of injury Judicial decisions on therapeutic treatment require the patient to be in- formed of the risk of injury in so far as reasonable medical foresight will allow and, except in those special instances of therapeutic privilege when information may itself obstruct therapy, the degree of information must be commensurate with the gravity and proximity of danger. Great danger may be lawfully consented to only when the patient has full information,57 and, at the other extreme, remote risk of minor harm need be little emphasized; indeed, it is recognized that a patient may become bewildered or harmfully alarmed if exposed to a recital of every remote danger attending a surgical procedure.58 In therapy, the risk-to-benefit ratio will exert a significant influence upon the treatment professionally considered, and proposed to the patient for his consent. Applying this reasoning to pure experimenta- tion, where no benefit to the subject is intended, it may follow that no detail of conceivable risk should be omitted from the information given to him in seeking his consent.59 This may well eliminate more hazardous experimentation until its risk can be greatly reduced, for instance by successful research on animals, and may jeopardize many projects likely to involve more than considerable discom- fort, except perhaps if the experimenter can serve as his own subject. As against this, when the subject is required to do no more than answer a questionnaire, as is commonly the case in sociological enquiries, or permit a routine medical examination or blood-test, little risk is apparently involved and the experimenter may be legally justified in confining the information he gives to that relevant to the subject's limited involvement in a wider project. Equally, when the experiment is by passive observation, there is next to no risk at all, and this may explain the law's inactivity in requiring consent. The matter has, however, an additional dimension. It may be contended that the experimenter needs the subject's consent as a legal defence against allegations of such offences as criminal assault and civil battery, but it is not certain how far the law protects the subject against injury. Obviously his physical person is protected, and nervous shock cases show that psychologi- cal harm is actionable; what is less clear is the extent of legal protection 57 Unless, of course, the patient is comatose or under anaesthetic when an emergency arises calling for an immediate decision to act; consent here may be implied, or obviated by the necessity of acting to save life or preserve health.

Ct). 58 See Male v Hopmans, [1967] 2 O.R. 457 (Ont. c.A.). 59 See Rozovsky, supra note 6, at 11 2, and Halushka v University of Saskatchewan, supra note 13</page><page sequence="18">398 UNIVERSITY OF TORONTO LAW JOURNAL against physical or psychological harm through emotional outrage or injury and against hurt feelings, including troubled conscience.60 Louis L. Jaffe, while acknowledging that consent protects health and bodily integrity, has observed that, 'Consent serves roughly two functions: First, it protects the personal integrity and dignity of the individual.'61 Its complete effectiveness to achieve this end has been doubted however, and Prosser has noted that, 'Liability of course cannot be extended to every trivial indignity.'62 The courts are inclined to take a restrictive view of suffering having no physical or clear psychological expression, and while recovery without phys- ical harm is established,63 the courts are slow to depart from the basic idea that mental suffering by itself is not sufficient damage to ground an action,64 and may reject a claim for physical incapacity found not to be directly caused.65 If, therefore, the risk of emotional harm resulting from an exper- iment is remote, and would follow from an irrational and unpredictable response, little if any information of the risk need be given. The principle of assault law, that the assailant takes his victim as he finds him, still applies, of course, but failure to consider feelings would probably lead to an action in negligence. In the illustrations suggested above (section 4) the risk of ex- treme emotional disturbance and feelings of outrage may be considered rather remote, but an actual instance may show that the danger is not purely theoretical. David Daube has recalled66 an occasion at Yale when the psychology department sought volunteers from the campus and New Haven to par- ticipate, for a reward of three dollars, in an experiment which purported to establish the influence of punishment on learning. Volunteers, after agree- ing that they would not hold the department liable for any damage they might suffer, were divided into two groups, of 'teachers' and 'pupils.' Pupils had to memorize verbal responses to a series of given words, and each time a pupil made a mistake his paired teacher either administered an electric shock of increasing voltage, having already sampled the first mild shock himself, or pressed his pupil's hand onto an increasingly hot plate, which he had felt at the outset. As the experiment progressed, the pupils got worse and worse, and were given increasingly severe shocks and burns, despite, for instance, informing teachers administering shocks that they had a heart condition. After a number or such experiments had taken place, the project ended and the results were published. The purported experiment had been bogus, the 'pupils' were acting and 60 See generally Prosser, 'Insult and Outrage,' (1956), 44 Cal. L.R. 40. 61 'Law as a System of Control,' in Freund, supra note 24, at 214 62 Supra note 6o, at 54 63 See Marshall v Lionel Enterprises Inc, [1972] 2 O.R. 177 (H.c.

Ont.). 66 'Legal Problems in Medical Advance,' Lionel Cohen Lecture 1970 (Hebrew University of Jerusalem)</page><page sequence="19">INFORMATION FOR CONSENT IN HUMAN EXPERIMENTATION 399 had faked the shocks and burns. The true experiment, inspired by the Eichmann trial, was designed to find out by testing the 'teachers' how many potential Eichmanns existed who would pursue a task, for reward, regard- less of what happened to the victim. It was found that an inordinate propor- tion of students and citizens had tortured their 'pupils' when, in the context of the purported experiment, they were already three-quarters dead. A few weeks after these conclusions were published, the head of another psychological institute announced that several of the 'teachers' were very upset by what they thought they had done to their 'pupils,' and at least one was so distressed as to need sleeping tablets prescribed by his doctor. A newspaper reported that in the experiment one 'teacher' was 'within twenty minutes ... reduced to a twitching, stuttering wretch, who was rapidly ap- proaching a point of nervous collapse,' others displayed 'bizarre laughter,' and one became 'so violently convulsive that the experiment had to be stopped.'67 Those conducting the project had made no arrangements for any distress the 'teachers' might have experienced. Since the experimenters had themselves carried out the research task regardless of what happened to the subjects, it may appear that there were even more potential Eichmanns than they had realized. The borderline between psychological harm and feelings of emotional upset, distress, or regret is not easily marked out, and the researcher may not know on which side his subject will fall. If, therefore, he should realize that the subject's feelings may be seriously affected by participation in the exper- iment, he may be legally required to inform him of the possibility. In discharging this duty it may not be sufficient to confine information to warning of the distress that is objectively foreseeable; the researcher may be expected to know enough about the project and the particular subject to apply a higher, more personal, standard of care. The researcher should then warn of all circumstances he reasonably believes will be experienced by his selected subject, as opposed to subjects in general. If the researcher observes this standard, however, he should be immune from liability if the subject suffers from an irrational or unreasonable reaction to the experiment or publication of its results that was also subjectively unpredictable. Hall JA applied an apparently objective test in Halushka v University of Saskatchewan, observing that 'The subject of medical experimentation is entitled to a full and frank disclosure of all the facts, probabilities and opinions which a reasonable man might be expected to consider before giving his consent.'68 It may be proposed, however, that the true test is subjective, and that the researcher's obligation is to give the subject such information as a reasonable researcher would give to a subject of that particular type, the burden being upon the specialist to have sufficient 67 New York Times, 26 October 1963, see 28 col,l; see also Kalman, 'Deception in Social Research,' (1966) Transaction (July-August), at 20. 68 Halushka v University of Saskatchewan, supra note 13, at 444</page><page sequence="20">400 UNIVERSITY OF TORONTO LAW JOURNAL knowledge of the individual he wants to use. In therapy, information for consent will be related to the needs of the particular patient, so that he is told of his special sensitivities, and equally not told when information would cause him undue distress, since to cause harm to a patient by supplying information can itself constitute malpractice.69 The subject of experimenta- tion is entitled to no less personal regard, and receives no benefit that may, in a patient, justify non-disclosure. If the researcher considers the subject's special conditions, however, and reasonably considers that nothing unto- ward is likely to result from what the experiment entails, he may proceed in a routine manner for his type of research. In the same way that a therapist need not inform a patient of remote possible consequences of treatment, so equally an experimenter may find justification, in the public interest, in not informing every subject of the risk of possible irrational emotional re- sponses. 7 The subject's questions It has been seen that the University of Toronto Research Board's guidelines to researchers require them to state in their protocols what explanations they will give to subjects before they agree to become participants in projects; it has indeed been recognized that the initial need to draft the consent provi- sion in the protocol aids not only the subject but also the research, since 'it serves to force the experimenter to think through and articulate his project in terms of design, risks, and objectives, and thus it has a valuable reflexive effect on the enterprise itself.'70 While the researcher can prepare himself for what the subject will be told, he cannot so easily prepare himself for what the subject will ask, either before giving consent or at any time thereafter. A leading work on the law of torts explains that, 'Doctors frequently fail to make a full disclosure to patients concerning proposed surgery. If not justifiable by genuine concern over the patient's health, half-truths or "soft answers" today run the risk of being condemned as either negligent misrep- resentation, deceit or even vitiating consent;'"71 such condemnation may also have criminal and contractual aspects. In principle, the researcher's duties in answering questions do not differ from those considered above on giving initial information, but his circum- stances may differ in that those actually responsible for obtaining consent, whether by consent form or otherwise, may not be adequately briefed on the importance of responding with adequate information, and others having later dealings with the subject, including those strictly outside the research team, may pass unauthorized comments the subject finds significant because of their ostensible authority. The incidence of inadequate briefing within the 69 See Natanson v Kline, supra note 42, at i 1o3, and Male v Hopmans, supra note 58, at 465. 70 Freund, supra note 24, at xvi-xvii 71 Fleming, supra note 40, at 79</page><page sequence="21">INFORMATION FOR CONSENT IN HUMAN EXPERIMENTATION 401 research team suggests negligence, the effect of which may be to vitiate genuineness of the purported consent, with all that follows from this. The problem of ostensible authority is more troublesome in law, and conceivably in medical practice, especially in a hospital where a senior nurse or member of the auxiliary staff may appear to share with the doctor the role of authority-figure, and may have a closer relation with a subject than has the researcher. The position of the patient in therapy72 is mirrored in the experimental context regarding the subject, although in the latter case less latitude may be allowed members of the hospital research team since their deliberate inten- tion is to use the subject. The Departmental Solicitor to the Nova Scotia Hospital Insurance Commission has spelled out the warning that: There is also some feeling in the health care industry, particularly in that branch mainly concerned with physicians, that consent to treatment concerns the physician almost exclusively. This completely disregards the development of the health care 'team' located in the hospital which is treating the patient. While the physician is a member of this team, many of the personnel who are presently treating and interfer- ing with the patient's integrity are not physicians. With the usual exception of the physician, the hospital is vicariously responsible for the members of the team who are its employees.73 If the unauthorized observations of such personnel should subvert the research team's acquisition of valid consent, or affect a contractual relation, accountability for the consequences could be widespread. Having pointed out that there are legal dangers in permitting the subject to misconstrue with whom he may properly discuss his position before consenting to experimentation, this article need not go on to consider how the chain of research command might be clarified, since this is a question of administrative management rather than law. It may be observed, however, that a nurse or other employee may be expected to report back any informa- tion given to a patient or subject whose consent to treatment is awaited, or who is awaiting treatment having given consent, so that those responsible may adopt the observations by their silence or may correct them in order to maintain the validity of subsequent or earlier consent. This may also serve the purpose of alerting researchers to any irrational emotional fears har- boured by the potential subject on which he needs to be given further information or reassurance. The consenting subject's possible right to revoke his consent, whether or not upon the basis of answers to subsequent questions, is perhaps worthy of mention, if only because it raises problems on the interplay of legal rules on contract and tort, including the defence of contractual licence to commit 72 On the doctor's duty in answering his patient's questions, see Smith v Auckland Hospital Board, [1965] N.Z.L.R. 191 (N.Z.C.A.). 73 Rozovsky, supra note 6, at 103</page><page sequence="22">402 UNIVERSITY OF TORONTO LAW JOURNAL what would otherwise be tortious. Consent once validly given is not necessar- ily binding for the duration of the experiment, although withdrawal will not operate retroactively to create liability for prior acts occurring under the authority of consent. Even if a contractual relation binds the subject to the researcher, he may remain free to break the contract and bear the conse- quences. If the researcher waives the breach and claims to maintain his contractual rights, complex issues may arise; rights of access to non-physical information such as files may well survive the subject's purported withdraw- al of consent, but the researcher's claim of a contractual right of access to the person of the subject might not prevail in a tort action for battery. Equally, his bona fide claim of right, while possibly of avail if he were prosecuted for an offence against property, for instance in taking documents,74 may not succeed if he were prosecuted for assault. The contrast between the researcher's rights in rem and in personam may be reflected in legal provisions on civil remedies, since the courts will not order specific performance of a contract for personal services," nor issue an injunction to restrain breach of such a contract if its effect would be to compel performance,76 leaving the experimenter, for what it is worth, the right to sue for damages. Once valid consent has been obtained, the subject cannot sue for breach of undertakings given in response to his later questions or requests, since they are clearly not part of the contract, but he may use information given in reply to argue that initial representations leading to consent in contract or tort were false, or that the purported agreement was affected by mistake, and invoke legal consequences not confined to the right simply to withdraw from the project. It may be doubted that the subject could be heard to contend that subsequent undertakings persuaded him to go on with his involvement, and that their false nature denied him the right to withdraw, since a court may be unsympathetic to the argument that a party is entitled to damages for loss of a right to break a contract. The researcher may decline in principle to answer subsequent questions, but this raises both practical and ethical objec- tions. Moreover, in any event, both tort and criminal law require him to maintain the continuing validity of consent by keeping the involved subject's relevant information up to date in developing circumstances. 8 The research environment Although instances have occurred of spectacular findings from primary experimentation, most progress in research results from cumulative effort. The dynamics of research tend to concentrate scarce resources into particu- lar areas of emphasis, so that the published results of one project contribute to the progress of other related projects and generate ideas for more inten- 74 See R v Bernhard, [1938] 2 K.B. 264 on the efficacy of a bonafide claim of right. 75 SeeJessel MR in Rigby v Connol, (188o), 14 Ch.D. 482, at 487- 76 Whitwood Chemical Co v Hardman, [ 1891] 2 Ch. 416</page><page sequence="23">INFORMATION FOR CONSENT IN HUMAN EXPERIMENTATION 403 sive development. Functional overlapping is found in that ditterent re- search teams work in closely associated areas (the slower teams, perhaps delayed by the demands of observing ethical and legal proprieties, risking being anticipated by a competing team), a research project within an organi- zation may have several points of contact with other projects in the same organization, particularly when the body is highly specialized, and an indi- vidual researcher may be involved at the same time in several related or unrelated projects. In almost every branch of the sciences, especially when pursued in the academic context of a university, there are pressures to present findings in research papers, articles, and books, to which the aspir- ing, less experienced and perhaps less able, researchers are often the most vulnerable. This 'publish or be damned' ethos propels research from which considerable (even if not always proportionate) public benefit accrues, but this may be at some ethical and legal cost. A sociological analysis of ex- perimentation in medicine has presented evidence that 'the pressures of having to establish oneself in a competitive scientific community seem to have the effect of making those researchers engaged in studies with human subjects who feel the pressures most acutely less sensitive to the issue of informed consent and more willing to engage in studies with less favourable risks-benefits ratios.'77 The warning note this observation sounds should echo throughout regions of research far beyond the province of medicine, even though physical risk tends to be less acute elsewhere. An associated difficulty, with a more immediate legal significance, lies in identifying a particular research project to his participation in which a subject has given a legally effective consent. Reliance upon the definitive quality of the research protocol may be unrealistic, since in good faith this may be amended in operation,78 perhaps merging one project into ajoint or wider project, and in any event it has been seen that a subject may not have to be aware of the extent of the project in which he is participating. Valid consent to a limited project may be abused, however, by opening up the project to embrace wider purposes, and the legal effects of this may be questioned. Initially, it may be proposed that the critical time for assessing the legality of consent is when information of the immediate proposal has been given and consent is obtained. The researcher will not be able to treat the consent as a blank cheque: irrespective of possibly limiting contractual considera- tions, he clearly cannot go beyond that consent in dealing with the subject. Equally, however, it may appear that consent to a procedure given for one purpose cannot lawfully justify that same procedure being applied to the subject for another purpose. The identification of the central purpose of a project is itself a matter of evidence, but the central legal issue may turn on 77 Barber et al, supra note 17, at 76 78 Amendments extending the range of human experimentation usually require referral back for approval to an appropriate ethical review committee.</page><page sequence="24">404 UNIVERSITY OF TORONTO LAW JOURNAL the contrast between fraud and good faith, and may be located less in the conduct of the researcher than in his intention. At this point, ethics and law may coincide. If the researcher initially can obtain valid consent by disclosing only the potential subject's limited involvement in a wider project, it may appear that the consent is effective without regard to the over-all outline of the research, which the experimenter may then enjoy some freedom to amend. If infor- mation of the wider dimensions of the project had to be given because they may affect the subject, and the experimenter realized the possibility of the project subsequently going even further, his failure to advert to that possibil- ity may constitute fraud on the subject, vitiating consent ab initio. If the researcher gave initial information in good faith, but the project later evolved into something larger, the subject will, of course, be free to withdraw if his agreed involvement remains unfulfilled, and in any event he will be entitled to additional information to maintain the validity of his consent to subsequent treatment in the changing context, but he may have no ground of complaint if his participation, obtained in good faith, is completed before the project advances in a new direction. He may have no veto power over the conscientious development of research in which he is no longer involved. This contention findsjustification on the plane of public policy, by advanc- ing the social interest in accumulation and concentration of properly ac- quired knowledge when the subject has been dealt with fairly, but it is also supported by more limited reasoning. Assuming that the limits of a research project can be defined, then, when its purposes have been accomplished and the results published, other researchers will clearly be free to base new projects upon the findings. Similarly, if the same research team bases a subsequent project upon its earlier findings, the original subject would appear to have no greater ground for complaint; a researcher does not undertake never to use the results of one experiment as the basis of another (subject, of course, to his continuing obligation to preserve personal confi- dentiality). At the completion of a project, moreover, the same researchers may immediately build upon their established foundation of knowledge, with no perceptible break in their evolving conception of the field of re- search, nor in the organization of their work within it. The evidentiary burden then falling upon a plaintiff-subject to show abuse of his consent by deviation from the central purpose of the initial project may be very difficult to discharge. He would have to show that the researchers were initially aware of what the research was likely to establish, and were prepared at that point to pursue it to the undisclosed further limits in a way that specially affected him. While, therefore, an experimenter must give the potential subject all the relevant information he has when seeking his consent to participation, he is not precluded from developing his research (giving further information if</page><page sequence="25">INFORMATION FOR CONSENT IN HUMAN EXPERIMENTATION 405 the subject is still to undergo the originally agreed procedures and is likely to be affected by the project as it has evolved) nor from applying resulting information for the purposes of further work no longer requiring the services of the subject. There would accordingly appear to be no legal obstacles to what is known to be orthodox scientific research practice. 9 A reflection upon practice The simple dichotomy between therapy and experimentation, based upon the physician's intention, permits a legal approach to those clinical investiga- tions, conducted in teaching hospitals and research institutions, in which a patient admitted for one purpose may also be used in other studies of no direct diagnostic or therapeutic value to him. Fewer questions can be an- swered than asked, since the law has not yet come to characterize the injury resulting to a fully informed and freely consenting subject of experimenta- tion conducted by proper procedures by qualified scientists; it may be possible, however, to identify certain of the problems a modern law of human experimentation will have to resolve. Asking questions may in itself help the practising physician to clarify his different roles and confront his different legal obligations. It is at once obvious that the patient's consent to participation in the research must be sought, since his consent to therapy, express or implied, will accommodate nothing beyond. An important distinction appears, how- ever, when tissue or fluid removed for diagnosis and therapy has an addi- tional independent research use. Without now considering legal ownership of tissue and fluid spontaneously or therapeutically removed from a live patient, it appears that his consent to its experimental employment in the institution possessing it is not required. A patient's obsessive interest in the destination of severed material may appear anthropomorphic or morbid, but parental feeling about the use of a fetus may be more sympathetically understood. Nevertheless, parental rights may not be constituted in law, and a United Kingdom advisory group reflected the Canadian position in report- ing that, 'Where the separation of the fetus from the mother leads to the termination of its life there is no statutory requirement to obtain the parent's consent for research,'79 adding the legal inconsequence that 'equally there is no statutory power to ignore the parent's wishes.'80 The principle behind lack of a legal requirement of consent to use sepa- rated bodily material is that such use causes the donor no further intrusion (although suspicion of abuse of an advanced fetus may cause parental 79 The Use of Fetuses and Fetal Materialfor Research, Advisory Group Report, 1972, para 42 (HMSO) 80 On the general right to possession of a dead body for preservation and burial, and to damages for mental suffering caused by its abuse, see Edmonds v Armstrong Funeral Home, Ltd, [1931] 1 D.L.R. 677 (Alta A.D.), and see Prosser, supra note 39, at 58-9.</page><page sequence="26">406 UNIVERSITY OF TORONTO LAW JOURNAL distress that has to be taken into account). Conversely, if more is taken than therapy compels, in order to furnish research material, criminal and civil liability will arise if informed consent has not been obtained. In any given case it would be legally unsafe to proceed in the hope that, 'Although there is no legal authority, and consent is theoretically necessary, it may be that, on the maxim, "De minimis non curat lex" - "The law does not regard trifles" - an extra drop of blood to build up a control group for a research study ... would not be condemned by the court.'81 It may indeed be contended that in principle conscientious and restrained research has a recognizable claim to an extra 5 cc of blood or a urine specimen, taken during routine diagnosis or therapy, but it cannot be presumed that the courts will relax the consent requirement, and abandon the patient in favour of the public interest, at the very moment when the patient is most exploitable. On the other hand, the requirement of obtaining informed consent may be easily satisfied. Moderate research may be regarded not as a project in itself, but realistically as a secondary pursuit to the therapy. If, therefore, the additional treatment will add only minutely to the risks already having to be taken, little additional information may be legally required in asking consent for the stated experiment; this may be so when, for instance, the patient is simply to be questioned, measured, or to have his medical file examined, or be subjected to the inconvenience of giving an additional urine, blood, or similar sample. Beyond emphasizing that the patient's therapeutic treat- ment should not be prejudiced for the purpose of experimentation without his fully informed consent, little more can be stated of what the law provides, and only questions remain. It must be asked, for instance, whether the therapist may also present himself to the patient as a would-be experimenter; subject to the role- confusion he may then cause and himself experience (against which his analytical capacity ought to be protection), there may be no objection to this. On the contrary, he may appear best placed to know how far research can go without endangering therapy. As against this, however, it is considered unethical and in Canada probably also illegal82 for the doctor treating the patient to be concurrently responsible for another patient for whom the first might, upon death, be a suitable donor for organ transplantation, in order to avoid the suspicion of a conflict between the welfare of one patient and that of another, or between therapy and sacrificial surgery. Similarly, the consent form to surgery might include reference to research use. This would be convenient when such use was not to any degree physically intrusive, and 81 Kidd, 'The Problem of Experimentation on Human Beings: Limits of the Right of a Person to Consent to Experimentation on Himself,' (1953), 117 Science 21 1, at 2 12 82 See the Ontario Human Tissue Gift Act, 1971, and the comparable statutes of other provinces, supra note 34. Section 7(3) of the 197 1 act provides that 'No physician who took any part in the determination of the fact of death of the donor shall participate in any way in the transplant procedures.'</page><page sequence="27">INFORMATION FOR CONSENT IN HUMAN EXPERIMENTATION 407 might lead to the practice of patients routinely participating in low-risk experimentation as collaborators rather than as mere subjects, confident that nothing would occur likely to prejudice their cure. Nevertheless, in law this might appear to subvert the genuineness of consent, since the sick patient willing to undergo hazards in the cause of therapy may not seem to have sufficient autonomy to resist the therapist ambitious to become an experimenter. Legal doubts express themselves in the rule that the contractual relation between doctor and patient is presumed to be affected by the doctor's exercise of undue influence,83 placing upon him the onus to rebut the presumption, for instance by showing that the patient had (and possibly even that he followed) independent advice. If the consent to experimenta- tion is a by-product of consent to therapy, it may be difficult to show such independence; indeed, a doctor may experience some difficulty in rebutting the presumption of undue influence over the therapeutic contract itself, although, since this influence would render the contract not void but only voidable, the doctor would incur no tort liability for proceeding under its terms until the patient had acted to avoid the apparent contract. To obviate the issue, however, it would be prudent to exclude the therapist from experimentation, and in any event to separate the two forms of consent. If, however, separate consent is required after consent to therapeutic procedures has been obtained, several questions arise regarding the infor- mation that must then be given. The extent of risk of the research can be assessed by considering only the excess over the risk already entailed in the therapeutic treatment. Lest the patient may misunderstand, however, it may be preferable to require the patient to be informed of any but minimal risk in the context of his total condition, so that his informed consent to the risk of therapy would be duplicated and his consent to additional risk would define the margin of experimentation. A physician invoking therapeutic privilege not to disclose the risk of therapy might then be debarred from further experimentation adding to risk. Equally, an irreversibly ill patient would be told far more than that the additional research treatment would be of limited effect in itself, so preventing his subjection to far-reaching experiments to which he consented upon information that the risk of them causing him additional injury was slight. The voids revealed by questions of this nature may in time come to be covered by a new legal fabric, fashioned piecemeal from interwoven strands of traditional legal principles, medical and research ethics, scientific knowl- edge, and evolving experience. Legal voids are prone to perpetuate them- selves, however, in that they deter the litigation by which definitive judicial materials are created. A more reliable source of contemporary solution than the courts can offer may be the legislature, before which more than lawyers 83 See Radcliffe v Price, (1902), 18 T.L.R. 466, and Re C.M.G., [1970o] Ch. 574-</page><page sequence="28">408 UNIVERSITY OF TORONTO LAWJOURNAL have a right of audience. It is not too soon to consider how legislation may accommodate modern human experimentation, providing both for due recognition of the public interest and for compensation of victims of respon- sibly conducted research.84 For this purpose, determining the information that ought in law to precede the subject's consent to experimentation is by no means the only, nor necessarily the first, task to be undertaken. io Emergency experimentation It is not inconceivable that the calm detached atmosphere of the research clinic may be invaded by external emergency. If, for instance, an uncontrol- lable disease threatens devastation of the population, experimentation with new drugs and treatments may become a matter of vital national or interna- tional urgency. Since the affected may be unsuitable for therapeutic testing, the unaffected may have to be taken for use as subjects and controls. Those not suffering from the disease, and quite possibly not suffering from any illness at all, may be needed for testing of new drugs; some may be deliber- ately infected with the ravaging disease, before or after innoculation with a newly created antidote in order to test its powers of prevention or cure, and others may be infected and left untreated in order to trace the natural pathology of the disease. At this level of pressure elaborate legal structures of free and fully informed consent may face an implosion, and collapse around the first principle of social order, salus populi suprema lex.85 Exaggerated though this apocalyptic vision be, it furnishes the ultimate point of projection of the public interest, and permits some interpolation of where a balance between public interest and private protection may be struck. It is legally acknowledged, for instance, that in time of war, armed hostility, or insurrection the public interest may be afforded a priority it does not enjoy in the more relaxed atmosphere of peacetime, and the concept of war need not be confined to a military setting. The battle against disease is a more acute form of the pervasive battle against ignorance and human neglect, and researchers joining the battle at the frontiers of knowledge may justifiably claim proportionate concessions from the law, as from other social institutions, such as those regulating the grant of funds. It need scarcely be emphasized that to justify experimentation without consent, there must be the imminent threat of widespread loss of human life; no serious experiment with one non-consenting subject could be justified to save even the life of another solitary patient, since it is not for a researcher to decide who shall be sacrificed in service to which other. That 84 See generally Ladimer, 'Protection and Compensation for Injury in Human Studies,' in Freund, supra note 24, at 247 85 This ubiquitously acknowledged principle of law appears, with an interesting summary of cases, in Re Carriere, [19431 3 D.L.R. 181, at 185 (Que. Sup. Ct).</page><page sequence="29">INFORMATION FOR CONSENT IN HUMAN EXPERIMENTATION 409 some shall be sacrificed in service to many is at times an inescapable decision, however, more easily recognized in the military theatre than in the operating theatre or the clinic. As Irving Ladimer has observed, 'the performance of an experiment involving serious consequences would have to be specifically, not generally, authorized by law or subsumed under some public emergency or necessity (mass vaccination covered by police power) or military requirement.'86 A decision at this level may appear to require governmental intervention, if not by legislation then by government itself sponsoring the experimentation, and undertaking compensation to subjects or their de- pendents. There are few well-documented instances of experimentation in emergency, but when the government of the United States was urgently committing its resources to space adventure and winning the moon race, motivated in part, no doubt, by a sense of strategic disadvantage in being superseded by the Soviet Union, the National Aeronautics and Space Ad- ministration conducted many hazardous tests upon subjects (giving their free and informed consent), who were able if injured to recover compensa- tion from the government, without having to show breach of duty, under the Federal Employees Compensation Act.87 Recognition of the important so- cial interest in emergency experimentation exists in its capacity to call for- ward the individual's most worthy instincts of self-sacrifice, and history locates at the furthest outposts of human experience acts of courageous dedication, from the celebrated heroism of Walter Reed and his colleagues, who injected themselves with mosquito extract to find a cure for yellow fever, to lesser-known men whose urgent endeavours to bring respite to humankind were fatal and obscure. Self-dedication is, of course, quite different from dedicating others, espe- cially without their consent. What conditions would constitute a sufficient emergency to justify risking the lives of others in an act of social defence, both with and without their informed consent, cannot be formulated in the abstract. It may appear that the law, being itself unable to prescribe correct decisions, can do no more than see that decisions are correctly taken, by applying itself to the elements of ethical and social due process. Historical precedents in the law may fail to inspire confidence, however. The court of Star Chamber rushed suspects and witnesses alike to the rack, invoking the doctrine of state necessity to obtain information, and Gregson v Gilbert88 revealed a cruel dimension of the modern rule permitting destruction of property when life is in danger;89 one hundred and fifty negro slaves had 86 Supra note 7, at 507 87 NASA adopted the procedures of us Air Force Regulation No. 169-8 (8 Oct, 1965) Use of Volunteers in Aerospace Research. 88 (1783) 3 Dougl. 232 89 See, for instance, Devlinj in Esso Petroleum Co.
