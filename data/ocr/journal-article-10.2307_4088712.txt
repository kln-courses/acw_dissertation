ISBN 0-521-32251-0. $99.95 cloth-The skua and penguin with title billing in this book are specifically the South Polar Skua (Catharacta maccormicki) and the Adelie Penguin (Pygoscelis ade- liae). More specifically, they are the populations of those two species that breed at Cape Bird on Ross Island, Antarctica (77?14'S, 166?28'E), where the au- thor and his students and colleagues conducted re- search during 1965-1970. Young presents the results of that research (with apologies for the long delay), using later research conducted by others on these species to help evaluate and interpret the findings from his program. The author outlines his objectives even before the title page: He wishes to "consider the relationship between these two species" and to challenge "the traditional view that skuas are totally dependant [sic] on penguin eggs and chicks for food." By examining the species' impact on each other, he intends to pres- ent "further evidence that the two species occur to- gether independently as a consequence of limited breeding space, rather than as a result of a distinct predator-prey relationship." Those who have had the privilege to study these species might wonder who holds the "traditional view" that South Polar Skuas are "totally" dependent on penguins. Even E. A. Wilson, in his report of the British National Antarctic Expedition 1901-1904 (Aves, British Museum, 1907) offered evidence to the con- trary. He observed adult skuas delivering fish to their chicks, remarked on the skuas' diverse and oppor- tunistic food habits, recorded nesting skuas far from penguin colonies, and recognized that even skuas nesting near penguins had to find other sources of food before and after the penguin breeding season. Nevertheless, some scientists have tended to over- estimate the importance of penguins to skuas, and the general public-exposed to countless nature films de- picting skua attacks on penguin eggs and chicks- may well hold this view. In any case, the author's broader objective-to ex- plore the relationship of the two species in detail- will be greatly appreciated by both skua and penguin biologists. The extent to which these species affect each other's reproductive success and behavior re- mains unclear; therefore, Young's attention to this issue is welcomed. In the introduction (p. 4), Young also sets his sights on a wider audience, namely those interested in pred- ator-prey relationships in general. The advantage of studying such relationships in Antarctica, he sug- gests, is that "general rules might become more ob- vious than in more complex systems." On the back cover, the publishers add that this book "will be of interest to all ornithologists." Finally, the book is part of Cambridge University Press's Studies in Polar Re- search series, which is "aimed at all scientists with an interest in the world's cold regions." The organization of the book, presented in wel- come detail in the table of contents, follows a logical progression of topics aimed at answering a series of questions about the two focal species. The final chap- ter, entitled "Synthesis," summarizes some of the main findings from the other chapters. Details of statistical tests are provided at the ends of chapters rather than cluttering the text. Raw data that form the bases for some analyses are provided in five appendices. Vivian Ward's delightful art work heads each chapter; pho- tographs produced by Iain MacDonald admirably illustrate the author's points throughout the text. Figures are generally adequate for their purposes, although in a few cases the thinnest or lightest lines were barely visible (e.g. figs. 2.1, 12.1). A reference section and nicely detailed index complete the con- tents of the book. The author clearly appreciates well organized ma- terial and tries to provide it for the reader. He fre- quently enumerates choices of methods, hypotheses, explanations, etc., which helps the reader follow his train of thought. Young's refreshing candor sets an informal tone to the writing, enhances the author's credibility, and provides useful discussion of topics such as researcher disturbance of the birds. Despite these positive efforts, there are some flaws in both organization and detail. The "Synthesis," for example, introduces new data and figures that should have been included in earlier chapters. Those in- trigued by results from skua exclosure experiments on page 303 must wait until page 325 for the methods to be described. Some information is repeated un- necessarily; other information is entirely missing (e.g. How were skua sexes determined? Why are published hatching dates for Brown and South Polar skuas on Anvers Island omitted from table 12.3?). I was dis- appointed to find no comparisons with Pietz (Auk 103:726-736, 1986) in his discussions of diurnal ac- tivity patterns and length of foraging trips of South Polar Skuas, or with Court (Ph.D. thesis, Univ. Otago, N.Z., 1992) in discussions of reproductive success and nonbreeder activities of skuas at Cape Bird. There are a number of typographical errors, some misspelled references (e.g. Sinif instead of Siniff), a few gram- matical mistakes, a couple of arithmetic errors (e.g. p. 288), and at least one inconsistency between text and figure (p. 397, fig. 12.2). One might have expected the publisher's editorial staff to catch more of these. To accommodate generalist readers, Young in- cludes some introductory material on the Antarctic environment and on taxonomy and ecology of skuas and penguins. The maps provided will help those unfamiliar with this part of the world. There are sev- eral places referred to in the text, however, that are not included on any of these maps and for which no</page><page sequence="2">816 Reviews [Auk, Vol. 112 map coordinates are given. Latitude/longitude infor- mation for sites is offered only sporadically (i.e. pp. 24, 391, 395). Readers browsing for specific findings may be chal- lenged by tables entitled "Percentage of eggs laid....." or "Foraging times.... "with no reference to species. This is not a problem when the tables are encountered in context, of course. Similarly, parts of the text only make sense strictly in situ. When Young discusses whether skuas are primarily predators or scavengers, for example, one must bear in mind that his comments refer only to the way skuas obtain food at penguin colonies; obviously, skuas are predators when they catch live fish. As scientists, we are constantly battling our own preconceptions to determine the truth. Rarely are there indications that Young ever lost this battle. In one case, it is by virtue of the author's candor that a po- tential bias comes to light: on page 170, he admits surprise that female and male skuas showed no sta- tistical difference in their aggressiveness at the pen- guin colony; however, by page 269 he seems to have forgotten this result when he refers to the "generally more aggressive activity of the males of pairs com- pared with the females." Readers may find Young's descriptions of skua and penguin behavior too anthropomorphic on occasion (e.g. individual skuas are "timid" or "pugnacious"; a female skua exhibited "foolhardy behavior" as a pred- ator; penguins can be "angry" or "furiously" alert after a skua attack). My reaction to such descriptors is mixed: as a behavioral ecologist, I balk; as an ex- perienced observer of skua behavior, I almost sym- pathize; and as a reader, I appreciate the added vitality in the text. More important, of course, is how well the author succeeds in meeting his objectives. For specific ques- tions addressed in the text, the author provides some convincing answers and some partial answers. De- spite the "relative simplicity" of the Antarctic system, the author could not always test or even identify all the variables involved. In other cases, the reader may speculate that another approach to the data analysis would have given a different result or that an alter- native hypothesis was not given adequate consider- ation. At the very least, however, Young has provided the reader with enough information to see how he arrived at his conclusions. This, in itself, is a notable accomplishment and serves as the basis for more in- formed questions on the reader's part. On the whole, the author succeeds in meeting his broader objectives regarding skua and penguin re- lationships. Researchers involved with these species will want to read this book for the wealth of data offered, whether they agree with all of his conclu- sions or not. As for its more general appeal, the book has two drawbacks. First, although Young alludes to wider applications of his data (e.g. for optimal-for- aging theory), he does not tackle generic predator- prey issues himself. It is left to the reader to find any "general rules" that may be supported by the skua- penguin story. Second, the book's price tag is too high for most readers with only a tangential interest; stu- dents, particularly, may find the cost prohibitive. For the sake of these readers, university libraries should consider adding this book to their collections. Skua and penguin biologists, Antarctic ornithologists, and polar-research libraries will want their own copies.- PAMELA J.
