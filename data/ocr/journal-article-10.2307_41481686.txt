<plain_text><page sequence="1">LEFT AND RIGHT IN REMBRANDT'S DEFEAT OF GOLIATH AVIGDOR W.G. POSÈQ The semantic distinction between left and right in artistic configurations is a fundamental but infrequently discussed aspect of aesthetic appreciation and studies of pictorial design seldom acknowledge the implications of the figures' disposition.1 This is hardly surprising since the configurations' diversity presents considerable difficulty in the formulation of universal laws of composition. An empirical approach to the problem, such as matching a painting with its reversed slide-projection, may give an idea of the elements' hypothetical transference but is compromised by the fact that the effect of the reversed image is of course not what the painter intended. Some insight may however be obtained from an iconological analysis of artistic conventions embodied in an individual work of art or, better still, by observing pictures which show different dispositions of the same protago- nists. I propose to combine these two methods in a study of Rembrandt's rendering of the combat between David and Goliath (fig. 1), including among the comparisons his presum- ed model, a sixteenth-century Swiss woodcut showing a contrasting figurai allocation (fig. 3), and a copy of the Rembrandt by a contemporary Jewish engraver, who in turn again reversed the figurai design (fig. 2). In discussing the significance of these reversals we shall refer to the iconographie repertory of the combat, adding some general observa- tions on the conceptual apprehension of narrative imagery. Rembrandt's illustration of David's fight with Goliath is one of a series of four etchings that he designed sometime before 1655 for Menasseh ben Israel, the famous Sephardi (Spanish) Rabbi of Amsterdam, to be included in his treatise promoting the knowledge of 1 For a rare study of the divergence of meaning conveyed by contrasting figurai schemes of the same subject see: D.

Menasseh ben Israel followed the Jewish tradition which interpreted the text as a prophecy of the future collapse of the enemies of Israel. Defining the "glorious stone" as a mystic instrument of divine providence he identified it with the unhewn rock that Jacob used as a pillow when he dreamed of the Heavenly Ladder (Gen. 28:11-15) and also with the stone with which David smote the Philistine's forehead (I Sam. 17:49). He contended that because of his supernatural stature Goliath may be identified with Nebu- chadnezzar's colossus, and, like the statue, he also represents the evil empires bound to perish before Israel is set free from exile. Such arbitrary linkage of historically unrelated biblical episodes is not unusual in mystical exegesis, which often employs this method in its attempt to penetrate the secret meaning of the Scriptures. The Rabbi was no doubt familiar with the kabbalistic glosses, especially the Book of Splender (the Zôhar) which in referring to Goliath's downfall says that the stone that killed him was an agglomeration of the five pebbles David put in his bag when he set out against the foe (I Sam. 17:40). The five pebbles, representing the Patriarchs Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, and Moses and Aharon, are said to have come to David of their own accord, and when he touched them they turned into a single unit, so that the compound stone became a tangible symbol of the Jewish faith which scored off the unbeliever.4 Menasseh ben Israel elaborated on this concept; pointing out that the number of David's pebbles corresponds to the five letters of the Lord's appellation in Hebrew (ELoHIM) he describes the stone as the Messiah himself. Dwelling on the significance of Goliath's discomfiture he suggests an affinity of the Philistine's name with the Hebrew word galût which means "exile", and is also used as a generic term for the Jewish Diaspora.5 Goliath's downfall is thus interpreted as a symbolic préfiguration of the end of galût and of the beginning of the 'Ingathering of the Exiles", which the Rabbi believed to be imminent. Although Menasseh ben Israel's interpretation of Goliath's defeat was founded upon the esoteric Jewish tradition, it had a close parallel in contemporary Protestant ideology 2 On Rembrandt's relations with Menasseh ben Israel see: I Abrahams, "Menasseh and Rembrandt", Bypaths in Hebrew Bookland (Philadelphia, 1920) and F. Landsberger, Rembrandt, the Jews and the Bible (Philadelphia, 1946) passim.

That interpretation found its expression in a wooden statuary group representing the combat, erected in front of the Doolhof Palace in Amsterdam a few years before Menasseh ben Israel composed his treatise. The Dutch wood carver Albert Vinckenbrinck7 was presumably aware of the fame of Michelangelo's gigante , but with punctilious Dutch respect for the Holy Writ, he portrayed David not as a nude giant but as a humble shepherd challenging an oversize adversary accompanied by a youth bearing his shield (I Sam. 17:7 and 41). Goliath's likeness to the wooden figureheads of Spanish men-of-war was probably meant to evoke the collapse of Spanish rule but his pseudo- antique armour, vaguely reminiscent of the Colossus of Barletta? may have been copied from an English late sixteenth-century depiction of Nebuchadnezzar's statue in Hugh Broughton's commentary to the Concent of Scripture.9 The affinity of that engraving with the Amsterdam colossus implies that the allegoric connotations of the statue's destruction were transferred to the victory over the Philistine. Menasseh ben Israel, who lived close to the site of the Amsterdam monument, was probably familiar also with the illustration of Broughton's commentary which was included in a Hebrew text published in Amsterdam in 1606, or he may have acquired the book in the course of his negotiations with Cromwell for the Jews' return to England.10 His acquaintance with its illustrations may have stimulated his wish to adorn his own treatise with a similar set of plates. 6 David was one of Luther's principal heroes, both as a secular ruler who confessed his sins and bowed to religious authority, and as the author of Psalms , where Luther identified the direct message of Christ speaking through David, cf. J.S. Preus, From Shadow to Promise (Cambridge, Mass. , 1969) 115, 201, 213; see also M. Bornkamm, Martin Luther und das Alte Testament (Teubingen, 1948) 9. In his commentary on the biblical combat Luther says: "When David defeated the giant Goliath, there was a great shout, and an encouraging message was passed around among the Jews to say that their terrible enemy had been killed and that they were free to enjoy liberty and peace; thereupon they sang and danced and made merry. Similarly God's evangel, the New Testament, is a good piece of news, a war-cry. It was echoed throughout the world by the apostles. They proclaimed the true David who had done combat with, and gained victory over sin, death and the devil ..." cf. B.L. Woolf, (ed.), The Reformation Writings of Martin Luther (London, 1956) II:278f. Luther identified the devil with the Pope, who, he declared "is not, and cannot be, the head of the Christian Church [since] he has been shown to be the head of the accursed Church of the worst villains on the earth, a vicar of the devil, an enemy of God, an antagonist of Christ - a teacher of lies, blasphemy and idolatry, an Antichrist . . .", in: J. Mackinnon, Luther and the Reformation (London, 1930) IV : 150. David's triumph over the Philistine is thus an allegory of the "new" Daviďs victory over the devilish Papacy. On Luther's influence on biblical iconography see: cat. Martin Luther und die Reformation in Deutschland (Neuremberg, Germanische Museum, 1983) 275-292. 7 The Vinckenbrinck statuary is now in the Amsterdam Historical Museum restaurant in the Kalverstraat.

H. van de Waal, "Rembrandts Radierungen", 55. п. 21. 10 The term Angleterre (England) was interpreted as the biblical "end of the earth" (Deut. 28:64) to which the 11</page><page sequence="5">In the introduction to his book Menasseh ben Israel advises the reader that his messianic doctrine will be clarified by four engravings of which one will depict the prophet Daniel's "Vision of the Four Beasts" (Daniel 7:3) representing the monarchies of Babylon, Persia, Greece and Rome that flourished in the course of the Jewish exile. A second illustration is to portray Nebuchadnezzar's statue inscribed with the names of these kingdoms and also with that of the more recently repulsed "Mahometan" (Turkish) empire in whose defeat the Rabbi recognized an auspicious realization of the biblical prophecy. The third picture is to show "Jacob's angelic ladder" and the fourth "the decapitation of Goliath prostrated at David's feet." The programme suggests the Rabbi's knowledge of the pictorial traditions, the detailed indication of the inscriptions on Nebuchadnezzar's statue being apparently derived from an engraving portraying the same subject in Hugh Broughton's commen- tary11 while the description of Goliath's defeat corresponds to depictions of David's victory in Dutch Bibles. A good example may be seen in one of Christoffel van Sichem's woodcuts showing the fight and the beheading of the giant sprawling at David's feet, in a Netherlan- dish Bible printed in Menasseh ben Israel's lifetime (fig. 4). 12 The Piedra Gloriosa illustrations were entrusted to Rembrandt, whose ability as a printmaker the Rabbi may have come to appreciate in the course of their long acquain- tance.13 Three of the etchings ( The Vision of the Four Beasts, The Destruction of Nebu- chadnezzar's Statue and Jacob's Dream) conform to the author's specifications, the fourth however does not show Goliath on the ground but still alive, and advancing to the attack, while a group of onlookers in the background anxiously watch the encounter (fig. 1). The divergence between this scene and its verbal description implies that the book was written, and presumably also printed, before Rembrandt designed the plates.14 The artist's dis- regard of the text by showing the actual combat rather than its outcome, may be explained by a wish to include the "glorious stone" which would have had no place in a decapitation scene. The stone is hurled by David advancing from the right, while the giant, clad in Jews are to be scattered before the messianic Ingathering of the Exiles can begin. On Menasseh ben Israel's knowledge of Broughton's commentary see: H. van de Waal, "Rembrandts Radierungen", 55. Hondius's illustration of the statue was also printed in a proto-typographic Hebrew text by Broughton published in answer to a letter by Abraham ben Reuben from Constantinople. I am grateful to Dr. A.K. Offenberg for this information. 11 H. Broughton, Concent of Scripture (London, 1590 or later); the illustrations of this second (?) edition, are by William Rogers. Cf.

The slight difference in the two woodcuts' format suggests that they were not made at the same time, and perhaps also that they reflect different iconographie traditions. The decapitation scene may be related to the tradition of medieval manuscript illumination, which will be discussed below, while the scene of the skirmish seems to have been copied from a woodcut by Hans Holbein the Younger, fig. 5. 13 A Rembrandt etching dated to 1636 is believed to represent Menasseh ben Israel. Rembrandt also painted his portrait. Cf. R. Landsberger, Rembrandt , the Jews and the Bible 35; A.

White, Rembrandt as Etcher (London, 1969) 105-118, fig. 154. 14 The fact that the text was not changed to correspond with Rembrandt's illustration perhaps implies that the Rabbi wished to introduce some modifications, which may in fact be seen in the plate's second printing and in the second set of illustrations which were later engraved by Shalom Italia, see below, notes 49 and 50. 12</page><page sequence="6">Fig. 3.

The depiction of Goliath's weapons conforms to Menasseh ben Israel's text, he bears a lance in his hand and has a sword attached to his belt, but he also carries a shield, not mentioned by the Rabbi who followed the biblical reference to the fact that Goliath's shield-bearer went before him. Rembrandt's attribution of a shield to Goliath reflects a persistent tradition which, resulting from a mistranslation in David's response to his adversary (I. Sam. 17:45)15, portrayed Goliath carrying an escutcheon16 or at least showed it near the Philistine's body, as for instance, in Van Sichem's woodcut (fig. 4). 17 While adopting this tradition, Rem- brandt departed from the encounter's iconographie formula showing Goliath advancing from the left side and David from the right. The protagonist's allocation assumes special interest when one learns that in accordance with his practice of using old prints as models for his biblical imagery,18 Rembrandt copied the combat scene from a small picture book of Old Testament stories published in Basel in 1576 by Tobias Stimmer, who showed David on the left and Goliath on the right (fig. 3).19 The fine artistic quality of the Swiss illustration makes Rembrandt's deliberate reversal of its composition even more remarkable. The divergence between the figurai disposition in the woodcut and the etching might at first glance be dismissed as a mirror-inversion in the printing. This would mean that Rembrandt etched a design that conformed to that of the woodcut (i.e. , David on the left and Goliath on the right), but the scene was reversed when the plate was impressed on paper.20 Incidental inversions of this kind occur not only in the work of unskilled printmak- 15 The Hebrew text says: "Thou comest with a sword (herev) and with a spear (hanît) and with a javelin (kîdôn)." The significance of kîdôn was already obscured in Antiquity, and in the Vulgata it was rendered as cly peo, i.e. shield (in Hebrew magen). The Latin text was the source of other translations including the Dutch. The canonical version officially approved by the Dutch Synod in 1618 and 1619 says: "Thy komt tot mir met een Sweert ende met een Spiesse ende met een Schilt . . cf. Biblia dat is De gantsche H. Schrifture vervattende aile de canonijcke boecken des Ouden en des Nieuwen Testaments (Amsterdam, 1661). 16 One of the few exceptions is the wooden Amsterdam monument (see above n. 7) which shows Goliath accompanied by a shield bearer suggesting a direct Scriptural influence. 17 See above n. 12. Rembrandt's knowledge of Van Sichem's work is implied by his drawing of Yael killing Sisera, which depends on Van Sichem's illustration of the same subject, cf. P. Schatborn, Tekeningen van Rembrandt (The Hague, 1985) Cat. 46, 101-303, figs. 46, 46a. 18 On Rembrandt's use of Bible illustrations and other prints as models for his compositions see: J. P. Filedt-Kok, "Biblical Subjects", in: cat. Rembrandt House , 39. Among the Piedra Gloriosa etchings the Vision of the Four Beasts and Nebuchadnezar's Statue repeat the composition of analogous themes in Hugh Broughton's Concent of Scripture , cf. H. van de Waal, "Rembrandts Radierungen", Figs. 6, 7. 19 Stimmer's woodcut was designed as one of the illustrations of the Biblia Sacra: Veteris et Novi Testamenti , (Basel, 1578) but some of the woodblocks were already used in a picture book called: Neue kunstliche Figuren biblischer Historien (Basel, 1576). Rembrandt's reliance on Stimmer's woodcut was noted by С. Tümpel, "Studien zur Iconographie der Historien Rembrandts", Nederlands kunsthistorisch Jaarboek (1969) 107ff. See also: idem , Rembrandt legt die Bibel aus (Berlin, 1970) 39. For a survey of the Swiss artist's oeuvre which in addition to woodcuts also includes many façade decorations see: cat.

Filedt-Kok, cat. Rembrandt House, 10-14, figs. A-D. 14</page><page sequence="8">ers but sometimes also in professional reproductions of famous paintings,21 Rembrandt's etching however hardly falls into this category, not only because his is an original work of art rather than a clumsy copy, but also because the artist, who in his long experience of printing, always took good care to prevent incongruities that might result from the figures' reversal,22 would hardly have forgotten the most elementary phenomenon of the process. Since he delighted in the spontaneity of the etching technique, sometimes drawing directly on the copper without the benefit of a preliminary drawing to be transferred to the plate in reverse, like many professional printmakers, he must have trained himself to design his prints in reverse, and would see their true effect only on the paper. He applied that method to the lettering, for instance the names of the evil kingdom which he inscribed on Nebuchadnezzar's statue must have been incised in mirror script. One may thus assume that Rembrandt's inversion of Tobias Stimmer's configuration was not a printer's slip, especially since his first printing of the four Piedra Gloriosa plates, which were presumably submitted for Menasseh ben Israel's approval, was followed by another impression in which three of the etchings show some alterations that may have been suggested by the Rabbi,23 while David's encounter with Goliath remained unaltered. The departure from the scene's conventional scheme must therefore be seen as an authentic conception. The problem of the reversal of Tobias Stimmer's composition is further complicated by the fact that Stimmer also designed another version of the same subject, which appears on the title page of his book; there however David is shown on the right and Goliath on the left (fig. 8). Since neither the figures' reciprocal relationship nor their postures correspond to those of the Swiss artist's other woodcut, one is led to infer that similarly to certain other iconographie motifs, David's fight with Goliath had two contrasting formulas, which may have been used to convey divergent connotations of the story.24 21 An example of the later type may be seen in David Hopfer's reproduction of Perin del Vaga's fresco in a Vatican Loggia depicting Goliath's beheading, which in turn is based on Michelangelo's rendering of the same theme in the Sistine Chapel and a figure derived from a reversed sketch by Raphael, cf. N. Dacos, Le Logge di Raffaello (Rome, 1977) 196. An inverted reproduction of Perin del Vaga, printed in 1520 by Ugo da Carpi, was followed by a correct rendering of the fresco ascribed to Marcantonio Raimondi or perhaps Domenico Venezia- no, which in turn served as Hopfer's model. The German artist incised the names of David and Goliath and also his own signature in inverted script, but was apparently not troubled by the fact that he was producing a mirror image, not only of Raimondi but also of the Vatican fresco; cf. , cat. Raphaël a la seconde main (Genève, Musée de l'art et de histoire, Cabinet des Etampes, 1984) 18-19. 22 W. Boeck, "Rechts und Links in Rembrandts Druckgraphic", Wallraf Richartz Jahrbuch, 15 (1955) 188-189. 23 F. Landsberger, Rembrandt , the Jews and the Bible, 96ff . 24 The contrasting iconographie formulas of the Annunciation also diverge in their meaning: scenes showing the Virgin on the right side are said to stress her role in the Incarnation, while those in which she is on the left have been interpreted as minimizing her prestige and emphasizing her humility and her subservience of God's will. Cf. D. Denny, The Annunciation from the Right, 1 and 134ff. The attractive hypothesis is however compromised by the fact that in many "Annunciations from the right" the Virgin is shown enthroned. The divergence of meaning may therefore be better explained by the semantic emphasis resulting from the sequential viewing order. In the conventional left to right reading, scenes showing the Mary on the left are perceived as: the Virgin receiving a heavenly messenger, while those in which the angel is on the left side must be understood as: the messenger bringing the news to the Virgin. The former stress Mary's role while those from the left emphasize the heavenly origin of the message. 15</page><page sequence="9">The figurai scheme of Stimmer's text illustration showing David on the left evolved from medieval illuminations presenting the consecutive episodes of David's life in miniature cycles, meant to be looked at together with the narrative text.25 In Greek and Latin manuscripts, and later also in books written in other European languages, such illustra- tions are always meant to be viewed from left to right, the same principle being also reflected in the design of each configuration even when the scenes are arranged in non-horizontal sequences. An example may be seen in a miniature from the mid-tenth century Paris Psalter (Paris, Bibl. nat. grec. 139) which illustrates the story of David's combat in two superposed scenes enclosed within a single frame (fig. 6). The upper register depicting the actual combat, shows on the left David led by a winged person- ification of courage, while Goliath advancing from the right is accompanied by "fear." The lower register shows the decapitation of Goliath (again on the right), watched by two groups of onlookers: those on Goliath's side are identified as "strangers" while those behind David are called "Israelites."26 The inscriptions imply not only that the viewer is expected to take the side of the Hebrews but also, and that is more important in the present context, that he is meant to look at the figures in a left to right sequence, starting with the Israelites, going on to David and finally to Goliath and his host of "strangers." Applying the same method to the combat in the upper register, one proceeds from David to Goliath, perceiving the scene as "David fighting Goliath" rather than as "Goliath fighting David", which would result from reverse sequence. By placing David on the left the Byzantine illustrator made sure that a viewer accustomed to the left to right reading order would see him, and not Goliath, as the chief protagonist. Medieval awareness of the semantic significance of the figures' allocation appears even more explicitly in the illuminations of an eleventh-century Byzantine psalter (Vat.gr. 752) which contains two independent series of scenes from David's life. In both cycles the scene of combat is followed by that of the beheading each identified by a brief commentary.27 In the first cycle both scenes (fol. 2v) conform to the Paris Psalter formula showing David on the left and Goliath on the right, but in the second cycle (fol. 104r) only the beheading, verbally described as David slaying Goliath, conforms to the iconographie convention, while in the encounter Goliath is situated on the left side and David on the right (fig. 7). The caption Goliath fighting David indicates that this scene also was meant to be read from left to right, and that whoever wrote the title understood that Goliath's position on the left defines him, not David, as the scene's protagonist. In other words he was aware that the sequential viewing of narrative scenes endows the first personage from the left with 25 On the origins of the iconography of David's life see: A.

The figurai scheme survived in the illustrations of printed books which, at least at first, were copied from miniatures. The mirror reversal of the design in the printed medium was usually allowed for, so that from the iconographical point of view, the woodcuts not only adhere to the traditional schemes, but also convey a similar meaning.31 The survival of the medieval convention may be illustrated in the Stimmer woodcut which Rembrandt used as a model. The caption over the picture says: "Not with a shield and weapons, but in the name of the Lord", which is a paraphrase of David's response to Goliath's challenge (I Sam. 17:45). The message is further elaborated in a verse which says that David, a simple shepherd boy armed only with a staff and a sling, approached the Philistine boldly, trusting 28 The semantic emphasis may be compared to that implied in the angel's position in "Annunciations from the right" (see above n. 24). A similar alteration of meaning resulting from protagonists' allocation may perhaps be discerned in scenes of Cain and Abel. Those showing Cain on the left side seem to stress his role as the first murderer while those that have Abel on the left may emphasize his role as the victim. For representations of both types see: R. Melnikoff, "Cain and the Jews", Journal of Jewish Art, 6 (1979) 16-38. 29 On the reversal of left and right in Byzantine and traditional Russian iconography see: В .A. Uspensky , "Right and Left in Painting", Semiotica, 13/1 (1975) 33ff. The problem was also studied by M. Friedman, "More on Right and Left in Painting", Assaph , 1 (1980) 123ff. Dr. Friedman found that the inversion occurs only in compositions featuring a central figure of deity, in other cases left and right are established from the beholder's point of view. 30 The few specimens showing Goliath on horseback advancing towards a pedestrian David belong to a special iconographie tradition of medieval Spanish Bibles: a double page miniature in Amiens Ms. lat. 108f. 85-86r, and its later copy: New York Public Library, Spencer Collection Ms. 22f. 66f., cf. F. Buchler, The Pamplona Bibles (New Haven, 1970) 2:319, fig. 32, pls. 206-207. The protagonists' allocation in the Amiens Bible might perhaps be explained by an adaptation of the configuration to the text which introduces Goliath on the left page and then on the right speaks about David. This implies not only the correspondence between text and illustration but also the figures' sequential left to right viewing order. Representations of Goliath on horseback but advancing from the right occur in Mt. Athos manuscripts (Dionisiou 60, f. 240r and Vatopedi 761, f. 125r), cf. A. Cutler, The Aristocratic Psalters in Byzantium, 135, 147, figs. 26, 65. 31 An example may be seen in a woodcut by Heinrich Quentell and/or Bartholomaeus von Unckel in the famous Koelner Bibel (1478, Nürnberg, Germanisches National Museum Inc. 2°521a, Bl. 127/128). The combat scene was copied from a German monastic manuscript miniature in Historien Bibel des Alten Testaments, 1460, (Berlin, Staatsbibliotheek Preussischer Kulturbesitz, Ms. germ., f. 516), cf. cat. Martin Luther und die Reformation in Deutschland, 285-286. Both illustrations combine within a single frame a scene of David's refusal of the weapons which King Saul offered him before the battle with the actual scene of combat, where David, approximately in the picture's centre, moves from left to right towards the Philistine who is situated on the extreme right. On the Cologne Bible woodcut see also: J. Strachan, Pictures From a Mediaeval Bible (London, 1959) 58-59. 18</page><page sequence="12">that faith would lead to victory (fig. 2). Following the direction of the script one appre- hends this woodcut as representing David fighting the infidel, but when the same viewing convention is applied to Stimmer's other version of the combat showing Goliath on the right (fig. 8), one perceives a different meaning. The fact that the title page configuration corresponds to that which we have noted in the upper register of the eleventh-century Byzantine miniature (fig. 7) seems to imply the existence of an iconographie tradition which endowed Goliath with a special emphasis. The situating of the combattants on Stimmer's title page is also paralleled on an ornamental border of the early sixteenth-century Prague Haggadah where David, easily identified by his sling, and somewhat prematurely also by a crown, is on the right while Goliath, in a subdued pose, is on the left (fig. 9).32 The Hebrew text of the Prague Haggadah is of course read from right to left and a person accustomed to the Hebrew script adopts the same direction in viewing the personages, who in spite of their separation by the text form a single scene. Here also the sequential viewing endows the first figure with a semantic emphasis, conforming also to the moral discrimination between the right and left,33 which in Jewish illustrations is not complicated by an "internal point of view." Proceeding from David to the defeated Goliath the viewer perceives the prominence of David. The right to left sequence devised by the Jewish illustrator of the Prague Haggadah had antecedents in an artistic tradition, even older than the one of the medieval manuscripts. We refer to late antique Bible illuminations believed to have been first introduced in the Hellenistic Jewish community of Alexandria. Though no such manuscripts have survived, their iconographie formulas seem to be reflected in other types of imagery, including one of the earliest depictions of David's fight with the Philistine on a 3rd- (or 4th-) cent. A.D. Jewish oil lamp from Alexandria, where the combattants are identified in Greek script, then used by the Jewish community for secular purposes (fig. 10). 34 Given the similarity of 32 B.

Baur, "David and Goliath in an Early Christian Lamp", Yale Classical Studies , 1 (1928) 41-51. Early Jewish illuminations may have provided models for the mid-third century A.D. synagogue of Dura Europos murals of which some are designed to be viewed from left to right while others imply a right to left sequence, due to the use of models from both Greek and Hebrew manuscripts. Alternate left to right and right to left directions have also been noted in the narrative illustrations of the Vienna Genesis , which may have had some Jewish prototypes. Cf. M. Friedman, "Vestiges of the Jewish Tradition in an Early Christian Manuscript", in: Israel ; People and Land: Ha-aretz Museum Yearbook , 1-3 (1986) 226 (Hebrew). Right to left sequences in the " Ashburnham Pentateuch" have also been interpreted as a reflection of the Jewish tradition, cf. J. Gutmann, "The Jewish Origins of the Ashburnham Pentateuch Miniatures", Jewish Quarterly Review 44 (1953) 55-72; H.L. Hempel, "Juedische Traditionen in fruehmittelalterischen Miniaturen", in: H. Fillitz ed., Beitraege zur Kunstgeschichte und Archaeologie des Fruehmittelalters (Graz, 1965) 53-59. 19</page><page sequence="13">their stature, the distinction between the victor and the villain depends on the viewing sequence, which (in spite of the Greek inscriptions) is envisaged as reading from right to left. Vestiges of this iconographie scheme may be traced in other late antique repre- sentations of the combat,35 and perhaps also in the aforementioned eleventh-century Byzantine psalter miniature, which has Goliath on the left (fig. 7) , but in medieval Hebrew illuminations, which in many cases were copied from non-Jewish prototypes, David is usually shown on the left and Goliath on the right.36 ' The prevalence of the Western formula even in Jewish miniatures makes the adoption of the Hebrew iconographie tradition on the title page of Tobias Stimmer's book unlikely, while his figures' countenance and costumes also dissociate the scene from the Prague Hagadah woodcut. Although Stimmer's disposition of the combattants corresponds to that of the Jewish illustration, his configuration was of course not meant to be read in the direction of Hebrew script; the scene should therefore be understood as "Goliath fighting David", the giant's subdued pose even allows one to describe the scene as Goliath being beaten by David. The same consideration would also apply to Rembrandt's etching which shows an analogous figurai scheme. Although the etching was commissioned by a Jewish author, the fact that Menasseh ben Israel's treatise was written in Spanish would hardly support the adoption of the Hebrew viewing sequence. It seems more likely that Rem- brandt, who habitually reckoned with the left to right viewing direction of his composi- tions,37 also meant the Piedra Gloriosa illustrations to be seen in this way. 35 The story of David's combat with Goliath appears on the walls of the Christian chapel of Dura Europos; cf. P.C.V. Baur, "Les peintures de la chapelle chrétienne de Doura", Gazette de Beaux Arts NS. 10 (1933) 75; C.H. Kraeling, The Christian Building : The Excavations of Dura Europos , Final Report , 8/2 (New Haven, 1967) pl. 31, fig. 2; Another version of the combat may be seen on a Coptic relief in the Cairo Museum, cf. A. Cutler, "A Psalter from Mar-Saba", 62, fig. 21. 36 Typical examples are to be found in the Kaufmann Mishneh Torah, (Budapest Academy of Sciences, Ms. Kaufmann, 22, II, f. 118); cf. G. Sed- Raj na, "The Illustrations of the Kaufman Mishneh Torah ", Journal of Jewish Art , 6 (1979) 66, fig. 3 and in a Hebrew Miscellany miniature (London British Library, Add. Mss 11639 f. 523v); cf. G. Sed-Rajna, "The Paintings of the London Miscellany", Journal of Jewish Art, 9 (1982) 26, fig. 11. The Mishneh Torah illustration is derived from an illumination of a Latin text (Paris, Bibl. nat. Lat. 1328 f. 17), while that of the Miscellany may have been copied from a French miniature from the workshop of Maître Honoré ("La Somme le Roy", Brit. Libr. Add. Ms. 54180 f. 121v.). 37 Rembrandt's reckoning with left to right viewing may be exemplified in two of his early works, which have a thematic affinity with the Piedra Gloriosa etching. The first is an oil painting dated 1626, which due to lack of agreement on what it represents, is usually referred to by the generic term of "History Painting", cf. К. Bauch, Der Fruehe Rembrandt 96, ff. 60; L. Bruyn et al., A Corpus of Rembrandt Paintings , 1625-1631 (The Hague, 1982) 104 f. The various attempts to identify the subject matter include a suggestion that it was drawn from the story of Daviďs combat with Goliath, and that it illustrates David's rejection of the arms that Saul offered him (I Sam. 17:37-38) cf. caption in: Hofstede de Groot, "Rembrandt's Youthful Works", Burlington Magazine 44 (1924) 126-7. One's attention is first attracted to a pile of weapons in the lower left corner, and then to a royal personage (Saul?) on a dais. Proceeding towards the right one sees the kneeling youth (David?) surrounded by soldiers. Reading from left to right the picture may thus be understood as weapons being offered by the king to a kneeling youth in the presence of onlookers. The sequential viewing is even more evident in a later painting which illustrates the verse "And as David returned from the slaughter of the Philistine, Abner took him, and brought him before Saul with the head of the Philistine in his hand" (I Sam. 17:57), cf. К. Bauch, Der fruehe Rembrandt , 118, fig. 82a; L. Bruyn et al. , A. Corpus , pp. 129-136.

Both versions being available to Rembrandt when he sought a model for his Piedra Gloriosa etching, he be seen is a horseman, representing Jonathan, who being shown from behind invites the spectator to share his view of the main scene. The old man between Saul and Abner may be identified as the prophet Samuel, bowing to the kneeling David in whom he recognizes the future King of Israel, which of course implies a rejection of Jonathan's right to the throne. The sequence is completed by an unidentified warrior, whose cast shadow directs the viewer's attention towards David. Rembrandt's reliance on the left to right viewing of this composition may be demonstrated by an attempt to read it in reverse. Starting from the soldier on the extreme right one proceeds to David, who now seems to implore the king whose ominous presence is reinforced by the rider behind him. This not only results in a misunderstanding of Jonathan's role as a protagonist but also of the implicit transfer of the crown to the young victor, which may perhaps be related to the allegoric political significance which the Dutch ascribed to David's victory. 38 Historiaram veteris instrumenti icones as vivum expressae (Lyons, 1538, repr. 1884) n.p. the woodblocks were cut by Hans Luetzelburger for an edition of the Old Testament: Biblia utriusque testamenti iuxta Vulgatem translationi (Lyons, 1538).

J.: Bilder zum alten Testament , IV (Berlin, 1938) I. Regum XVII. 40 The allegoric significance ascribed to Holbein's woodcut is also reflected in an illustration by Augustin Hirschvogel in: Konkordanz und Vergleichung des Alten und Neuen Testaments , cf. R. Schwartz, Augustin Hirschvogel (Berlin, 1917, repr. New York, 1970) 36ff . , cat. D.B. 81-82. The book was commissioned in 1550 by Luther's follower Peter Perenyi, who seems to have been responsible for the episodes' programmatic arrange- ment. Goliath's defeat, which shows him already decapitated while David walks away with his head, is combined with the scene of David saving a lamb from the lion (the lamb is of course the traditional symbol of the faithful). Both Old Testament scenes are juxtaposed with the Harrowing of Hell, showing the departure of the captives while Christ subjugates Lucifer. The typological relationship of these episodes may be explained by the fact that in the Protestant struggle against the Chruch, the Papacy was often associated with Lucifer (see above n. 6). The text to Hirschvogel's illustration says that Goliath was transfixed by David, who set the people of Israel free by slaying their persecutor, while God who would not suffer Lucifer's cunning, like David subjugated the devil, and redeeming young and old led them out of Hell. The apocalyptic liberation of true believers is thus conceptually associated with the Goliath's defeat. 41 On Holbein's influence on Stimmer see cat. Tobias Stimmer , 193 et passim. 22</page><page sequence="16">chose the expressive scene of Stimmer's text illustration but reversed its configuration to convey the special significance which Menàsseh ben Israel ascribed to Goliath's defeat. Looking at Goliath as he strides or rather lurches, towards his doom one is struck by the insecurity of his gait arising from the fact that his head and torso are periliously in advance of his feet. The stooping pose which corresponds (in reverse) to the attitude of the attacking Goliath in the Stimmer text illustration, does not suggest a vigorous charge but exactly the opposite, it seems that the Philistine is about to fall even before being struck by David's stone. The precariousness of his footsteps brings to mind a popular Jewish legend in the Midrash Rabbah according to which, when Goliath saw David approaching the earth held his feet fast, and in spite of his efforts he could not move from his place.42 Rembrandt's knowledge of Hebrew was of course hardly sufficient to justify the assumption of a direct response to the midrashic text, but Menasseh ben Israel may have referred to the legend in expounding his theory of the mystic predestination of the combat's outcome. A closer inspection of the Philistine's figure reveals other features that seem related to the scene's symbolical meaning. One should note especially that contrary to common practice he carries his shield in his right hand and his lance in his left. The incongruity might be related to Goliath's inversion in the printing, but if one holds that Rembrandt's figurai allocation was a deliberate attempt to convey Menasseh ben Israel's interpretation of the episode, one cannot ascribe Goliath's lefthandedness to a printer's slip.43 Considering that Rembrandt often depicted biblical scenes as reality, Goliath's use of the left hand could perhaps be explained by supposing that when the Philistine saw that David was preparing to hurl stones at him from a distance, he judged that an efficient manipulation of his shield would be necessary before he could use his lance, which he prudently transfered to his left hand, but the fact that Goliath's sword is attached to his right side indicates that his lefthandedness is not temporary. Rembrandt was of course aware that behavioural patterns in the use of the hands are perpetuated in persistent cultural traditions, the right, normally the stronger, is almost universally endowed with positive connotations of dexterity, righteousness and lawfulness, while the left is usually associated with negative or pejorative meaning.44 The conceptual differentiation between the two hands is especially explicit in Jewish literary heritage. As an attentive reader of the Bible Rembrandt must have known that the ancient Hebrews saw in the right hand an embodiment of the physical as well as moral prowess, the right hand was used in blessing 42 For the English translation see: H. Freedman and M. Simon, Midrash Rabbah: Leviticus (London, 1939) 266. 43 It has been observed that in his prints Rembrandt never erred in the depiction of his figures' use of their hands. For instance, persons writing are always shown using their right hand, cf. W. Bock, "Rechts und Links in Rembrandt's Druckgraphic", 192f., figs. 160, 161. 44 On the prehistoric origins of this distinction see: S. Giedion, The Eternal Present: The Beginning of Art (London, 1962) 198. For a cross cultural survey of the various traditions see: R. Herz, "La pré-éminenence de la main droite: étude sur la polarité religieuse", Révue Philosophique, 68 (1909) 553-580. See also: V. Frisch, Left and Right in Science and Life (London, 1968) and E.

(Hebrew). 23</page><page sequence="17">and was estimated as an instrument of salvation, while the left was regarded awkward, clumsy and unlucky and was commonly considered as sinister.45 Menasseh ben Israel might have added to Rembrandt's knowledge of these derogatory connotations numerous litera- ry examples in which the left is associated with error and heresy. The kabbalistic tradition from which the Rabbi drew his interpretation of Goliath's defeat identifies the left (in Hebrew šmol) with the satanic realm of Sammael, and refers to the demonic world of evil as the "left side" (sitra ď smola). 46 Since the left is considered a symbol of vice and evil character and also as a bad omen anticipating and even invoking disaster, Goliath's use of the left hand in his fight against David implies that he was bound to fail. This in- terpretation, so appropriate to Menasseh ben Israel's theory that the defeat was predes- tined, suggests that even if Rembrandt's portrayal of Goliath as lefthanded was coinci- dental to the mirror inversion of his design, it became a significant feature of his in- terpretation of the biblical episode. Together with the other illustrations which Rembrandt made for Menasseh ben Israel, the scene of Goliath's discomfiture was to be inserted among the pages of the text, which, as we have already noted, was printed separately, but for some reason, perhaps because the lightly etched copper plates could not withstand a commercial printing, this project was not carried through. Only a few copies of the Piedra Gloriosa , contain Rembrandt's etchings;47 several copies have no pictures at all, while others contain a different set of illustrations. The artist who designed those prints did not sign his name, but he has been identified as Rembrandt's contemporary, the Jewish engraver Shalom ben Mordechai Italia, an illustrator of Hebrew as well as non-Hebrew books,48 whose acquaintance with Menasseh ben Israel, founder of the first Hebrew press in Amsterdam, is documented by the Rabbi's portrait which the artist engraved several years before Menasseh ben Israel 45 The victorious omnipotence of God is referred to as the "strong hand" (yad hazaqah) which is always understood as His right hand. For instance, in the song which Moses sang to God after the defeat of Pharaoh he says: "Thy right hand, О Lord, is become glorious in power: thy right hand, О lord, hath dashed in pieces the enemy" (Ex. 15:6) and also: "The Lord hath sworn by his right hand, and by the arm of his strength" (Is. 62:8). On the positive connotations of the right hand see also: Gen. 48:12-20 and Ps. 17:7; 44:3; 139:10. The negative symbolism of the left hand is implied by Ecclesiastes who says: "A wise man's heart is at his right hand; but a fool's heart is at his left" (10:2). The verse was interpreted as: "The wise man's mind tends to his right (i.e. to what brings him good luck) and the fool's to his left." The belief that omens appearing on the right side are lucky and on the left are unlucky is implied in Ez. 21:27. It has also been noted that in Arabic shimal means both "left hand" and "bad men"; cf. С. Cohen, s.v. "Right and Left", in: Encyclopaedia Judaica. For a comprehensive survey of the symbolism of the left and right in Jewish traditions see: A. Loewinger, "Rechts und Links in Bibel und Tradition der Juden" (1916) 1-70. 46 Loewinger, "Rechts und Links", 42ff. See also: G. Scholem, Major Trends in Jewish Mysticism (New York, 1954) 239. 47 The copy is in the Library of the Leiden University; cf. H. van de Waal, "Rembrandts Radierungen." Dr. A.K. Offenberg kindly called my attention to the fact that Rembrandt's etchings are also inserted in a copy kept in the Rembrandt House in Amsterdam and also in another in the Bibliothèque nationale in Paris. 48 Also called "Salomon Italia", born in Mantua in 1619 and active in Amsterdam between 1641 and 1655, or perhaps later.

Since Italia was a professional printmaker and because the reversal occurred only in this illustration one can hardly ascribe it to an error, while the fact that it was actually inserted in the book also suggests that his version received the author's approval. The Jewish engraver who as an illustrator of books written in Hebrew and in Latin characters was no doubt sensitive to the differences between the respective iconographie conventions, may have noted that the unusual, seemingly Jewish, scheme of Rembrandt's configuration had few parallels among the familiar pictures of the combat, and advised Menasseh ben Israel that an illustration of a book addressed to the general public should conform to the conventional formula. One would not be surprised if the Rabbi's approval of the scene's reversal was also motivated by a wish to dissociate it from its potential Protestant implica- tions, especially since the prospective readers' habitual left to right viewing might result in the scene's misunderstanding as a representation of Goliath fighting David. Shalom Italia was not the only contemporary artist who objected to the semantic prominence of Go- liath's position. His revision of Rembrandt's composition has a parallel in Van Sichem's reversal of the Holbein woodcut which also shows Goliath on the left (figs. 4 and 5) . In both cases a scene which by virtue of Goliath's position on the left alluded to his defeat was transformed into a conventional representation of David's victory. Shalom Italia's in- version of Rembrandt's design also provided an opportunity for correcting the seeming incongruity of Goliath's lefthandedness, but in doing so the copyist deprived the biblical encounter of the conceptual symbolism with which it was endowed by Rembrandt. Returning now to the general issues of left and right in narrative configurations we may offer the following conclusions: (1) divergent iconographie formulas of the same subject matter seem to have been used to convey its different interpretations, revealed in the scenes' sequential viewing in the direction of the script, (2) the sequential viewing order confers a special semantical emphasis on figures situated on the beholder's left, which may 49 A.
