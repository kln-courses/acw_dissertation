June, 1955 DEVELOPMENT OF PERUVIAN COASTAL TIAHUANACOID STYLES* Louis M. STUMER IN many works on Peruvian archaeology with their necessary emphasis on pottery styles as diagnostic elements of cultural development and change, one is often struck by the seeming confusion and number of styles in the Tia- huanacoid or Middle periods, and the result- ing number of conflicting names for chrono- logically affiliated strains. This paper is an attempt to clarify in part this confusion and also an attempt to explain why it should exist and undoubtedly will continue to exist for some time to come, or at least until a great deal more field research has been completed on the coast of Peru. In spite of recent advances in architectural and textile analysis, ceramic styles still remain the soundest diagnostic elements for tracing pre-Columbian Peruvian culture sequences. In a cultural development such as that of ancient Peru, with its highly diversified regional civili- zations, whose cultural manifestations from * The author is deeply indebted to William Duncan Strong for suggesting this article and his kindness and cooperation in making available the material from the Columbia University share of the Viri Valley Project and also the photographs and collections of the 1952-53 Columbia University Nazca-Ica Expedition. time to time are influenced by "horizon styles," it is more than advisable to be able to trace culture sequences and their relationship to one another. Future absolute dating and detailed analysis in this way can be put into a proper frame of reference and cross reference. Al- though strong inferences may be drawn from certain areas where detailed study has taken place, such as the Chicama valley (Larco 1948), Virui valley (Ford and Willey 1949; Strong and Evans 1952), Ancon area (Strong, Willey, and Corbett 1943; Willey and Corbett 1954), and the Nazca (Rio Grande) valley (Strong 1954), so many important regions of the Peruvian Coast have not yet received the field research they merit that it is still difficult to present culture sequences for the coastal regions in general with any real degree of as- surance. However, recent excavations and sur- veys have indicated that there are many as yet unknown regional styles and greater intervalley stylistic differences than had been previously contemplated, especially during epochs when the coastal regions were not united either re- ligiously, politically, or stylistically, thus tend- ing to make general inferences rather risky when drawn from a study of a single valley. STUMER ] 59</page><page sequence="2">AMERICAN ANTIQUITY Hence, the analysis of ceramics of epochs when some fusion is found, such as the Tia- huanacoid, becomes of great importance as providing a measure of cross reference. The Tiahuanacoid periods are of special importance in this context, linking as they do the Forma-! tive and Regional Florescent epochs with those of the great kingdoms and confederations and of the development of the Inca Empire. Rough- ly speaking, the Coastal Tiahuanacoid periods may be defined as those occupying the time from the first strong coastal appearances of highland, Tiahuanaco- influenced stylistic manifestations to the emergence of the ulti- mate pre-Inca coastal styles such as Chimui, Chancay, and Chincha-Ica. Another reason for the importance of these periods is that' architectural development, stylistic change, and depth of associated refuse would seem to give these periods a considerable time depth. Re- cent radiocarbon readings (Johnson 1951: 37- 49), giving us late Mochica dates of around A.D. 150, tend to push the beginnings of the Tiahuanacoid periods back some hundreds of years, since Strong (Strong and Evans 1952: 205) has shown Tiahuanacoid I overlying Mo- chica. Viewed in this light, their inception could easily have been as early as A.D. 500, thus providing more evidence of their long dur- ation, as the epoch of Kingdoms and Confed- erations has its beginnings around A.D. 1200. A third measure of the importance of the Tiahuanacoid periods is their wide distribution. Evidences of Tiahuanacoid influence have been found on the Pacific littoral from the north coast of Chile to the Lambayeque region of Peru some 250 miles south of the Ecuadorian frontier, a distance of approximately 1600 miles. Over this great distance, the Tiahuana- coid influences appear in varying degrees of strength and purity and combine with local styles to a similarly varying degree. It is pre- cisely this variation and fusion with local styles, when combined with a hitherto un- avoidable lack of knowledge of many local styles, that has produced a great deal of the above-mentioned confusion. When the fact is taken into consideration that in many quarters considerable uncertainty exists about exactly what is meant by coastal Tiahuanacoid, the confusion becomes inevitable. Wendell C. Bennett, before his untimely death in 1953, did much to clarify the high- land, or Tiahuanacoid influences appearing on the coast of Peru. Bennett (1953), in his typing of the ceramics encountered in his ex- cavations at the important Tiahuanacoid center of Wari in the Peruvian Sierra, isolated 2 types that appear most strongly on the coast. At the same time he proposed the hypothesis that Wari, and probably other similar Peruvian centers, were the foci for the diffusion of Tiahuanacoid styles to most of the Peruvian coast, rather than a spread direct from the Lake Titicaca basin itself. This manner of diffusion, heretofore suspected by some, but not yet generally taken into account before Bennett's work, is another factor in the diffi- culty of understanding the coastal Tiahuana- coid manifestations. Still another point that may arise before the whole picture is clear is that Schaedel (personal communications, 1953- 54), from his work on the Chilean coast in 1953 and 1954, has come to the tentative con- clusion that the Tiahuanacoid spread to that area came directly from the region of Tia- huanaco, and that this may hold true for the southern part of the Peruvian coast as well, that part from Camana to Tacna. Because of the geographical situation of this area (Stumer 1954) the author is inclined to agree with Schaedel. There could then be a situation in which the larger and more artistically im- portant section of the Peruvian coastal Tia- huanacoid culture area got its highland stylistic impetus indirectly from Tiahuanaco via the Peruvian intramontane basins, picking up bits of local highland cultures as it came, while another less important section got its impetus directly from the Titicaca basin foci. In other words, the styles of the one area could and should be termed Tiahuanacoid, while those of the latter would probably be more aptly called coastal Tiahuanaco in order to point out the difference between the direct and indirect diffusion. This part of the discussion is still highly academic, since, although the Tiahuana- co influence has been recognized in the southern region, no work done there has yet been published and those styles have still to be isolated. To return, therefore, to the Tiahuanacoid styles already known, Bennett isolates 2 strains most strongly influencing the coast. These are: Wari Polychrome Fine (Bennett 1953, Figs. 14, 15; Pls. 3-6), and Ayacucho Polychrome (Ben- nett 1953, Figs. 17, 18; Kroeber 1944, P1. 39). The Wari Polychrome appears most definitely 60 [ XXIT, 1, 1956</page><page sequence="3">COASTAL TIAHUANACOID STYLES 0 z .41I Z) x EPOCH OF KINGDOMS AND CONFEDERATIONS CHINCHA ICA (MIDDLE ICA) / \ NEW LOCAL ST Y LE / \ DECADENT A YA C UC HO (MIDDLE ICA) POLYCHROME \ ^ / .. / (RUKANA) /^^~ D\ ECADECADENT (EARLY ICA) WARI POLYCHROME / WARI AYACUCHO N A ZCGA B VPOLYCHROME POLYCHROME NAZCA B FINE (NAZCA Y) OLD LOCAL STYLES INTRUSIVE STYLES REGIONAL FLORESCENT EPOCH FIG. 1.

However, in this region both the Wari and Ayacucho Polychromes exert great influence on the coastal styles, thus causing even more stylistic confusion in this area. The Ayacucho style shows an amazing num- ber of resemblances to the style which has been called Nazca Y by Kroeber and others. This style has been found by Kroeber and Strong in various valleys of the Nazca region and by Strong in the Ica valley. Kroeber (1944, Pls. 3-6) illustrates several pieces closely resembling the Ayacucho Polychrome ware, giving their provenience as the upper Majes valley to the south of the Rio Grande (Nazca) valley. For the present, the foregoing is the hypothetical range of distribution of the style on the coast. However, surface reconnaissance has demon- strated the likelihood of a further extension to the Pisco and Chincha valleys just to the north of the Ica. Strong (personal communica- tions, 1953-54), from his excavations at the Huaca del Loro site in the vicinity of Nazca, is inclined to believe that the Ayacucho Poly- chrome style is coastal in origin, probably a late offshoot of the true Nazca styles, and passed to the Wari region from the Nazca area at a time just before the Tiahuanacoid "invasion" of the coast. There is ample evi- dence of a good deal of interchange between the 2 above-mentioned regions at such a time. Strong's hypothesis, then, could well be a plausible explanation of the limited spread of Ayacucho Polychrome, as not being a true Highland, Highland-diffused style. It does not, however, explain the extremely decadent as- pect of both Nazca and Tiahuanacoid designs which appear on the ceramics, as well as the general disappearance of the polychrome tra- dition shared by both the Nazca and Wari styles in their classic periods. The final defini- tion of this problem must await further excava- tion, both on the South Coast and in the Mantaro Basin, in which Wari is located. Such excavation is most necessary, as the Ayacucho Polychrome-Nazca Y style is of extreme im- portance to the South Coast Tiahuanacoid periods. At the Lima Conference in January of 1953 (Anonymous 1953) the coastal Tiahuanacoid periods, or the epoch of Great Fusion, were separated into 3 main divisions: Tiahuanacoid EPOCH OF KINGDOMS AND CONFEDERATIONS CHANCAY 3m \ (LATE ANCON I) (BLACK-WHITE-RED) (GEOMETRIC) o \ NEW LOCAL STY LE z ~ L~(MIDDLE INFLUENCES ~z I,-(MIDDLE (HUAURA) FROM RELIEF PRESSED ANCON NORTH e SOUTH WARE RI DECDENT /DECADENT TEATINO WARI POLY CHROME MARANGA FEATINO POLYCHROME FINE - OLD LOCAL STYLES I| NTRUSIVE STYLES REGIONAL FLORESCENT EPOCH a FIG. 2.

This division was due in part to the results of Schaedel's work on the North Coast on the architecture and ceramics of the epoch of Great Fusion in that region. Un- fortunately, but for reasons that the author hopes will become apparent before the end of this paper, a clear definition of the divisions between Tiahuanacoid I, II, and III could not be made at that time. It was felt, however, that there were certain well defined milestones along the route of the development of the Tiahuanacoid styles that could not be over- looked as pointing out changes of significance. It should be apparent that in the stylistic devel- opment within any one epoch, especially one of fusion and a horizon style, that any hard and fast divisions must be, at least in part, arbitrary. However, since the 3 divisions are intended primarily for purposes of chrono- logical sequences and cross dating, a certain amount of stylistic "fuzziness" at times of tran- sition is not only permissible, but inevitable (Bennett 1939: 138-9; Kroeber 1944: 111-4). It would be illogical and nonsensical to cherish the hope that, merely to aid the archaeologist, styles would have changed completely and abruptly in any area in a short period of time!

It should be here pointed out that within this large mixture of stylistic terms, all meaning the same thing from a chronological point of view, are found 2 strains which the author feels are of supreme importance for the clarifi- cation of the epoch. Perhaps it would be better to say that the ceramics of all these various styles or types can be separated into 2 main divisions, and these divisions hold true for Tiahuanacoid I along the entire coastal range of its distribution. These divisions are: (1) a ceramic almost purely highland in style, be it either Wari Polychrome Fine or Ayacucho Pol- ychrome derived, with very little blending with or influence from the pre-Tiahuanacoid local style (here Nazca B), and (2) a ceramic still almost purely local with just a few diagnostic elements of the highland influence. In other words, one of the salient points to consider in studying the ceramics of the Tiahuanacoid I period is the continuing comparative purity of local and intrusive strains. For example, Pa- checo (Bennett 1946, Figs. 13, 14) is practically pure Wari Polychrome. Nazca-derived coastal influences are minor and have not yet measur- ably succeeded in softening or decaying the style. On the other hand, Nazca Y (Muelle and Bias 1938, P1. 4 a) quite often succeeds in retaining a great measure of the purity of the coastal style, showing only minor highland in- fluences in form, execution of design, and color. The Tiahuanacoid I period on the Central Coast is simpler to identify, particularly be- cause of the virtual disappearance here of the Ayacucho Polychrome strain. The ceramics, bearing a great resemblance to the Pacheco and Kollawa of the South Coast, are called by various names including: Coast Tiahuanaco, Coast Tiahuanaco A, Epigonal, Pachacamac, and Pachacamac A, and Middle Ancon I (Table 1), and are all derived from Wari Polychrome Fine (Bennett 1946, P1. 39; Bennett and Bird 1949, Fig. 40, upper half). The South Coast-originated, Tiahuanaco-diffused, double- spout-and-bridge form is present, as are the kero-like cups and anthropomorphic collar jars so characteristic of coastal Tiahuanacoid mani- festations. The polychrome tradition of the Wari Poylchrome Fine style (and also of the Nazca) has not yet begun to fade, and outside influences in general are confined to small style-softening hints derived from motifs of the 62 [ XXII, 1, 1956</page><page sequence="5">COASTAL TIAHUANACOID STYLES pre-Tiahuanacoid Maranga style of the Central Coast, that style also known as Cajamarquilla, Nieveria, and Proto-Lima. Grave association at the author's 1955 excavations at Vista Alegre in the Rimac Valley confirms the coexistence of decadent Maranga with classic Tiahuanacoid I, while at the same time showing the still relative purity of both styles. The Peruvian government excavations at Ancon Necropolis in 1952-53 (Respaldiza 1952) showed the same association, while at the same time confirming Strong's and Kroeber's observations (Strong 1925: 148-52; Kroeber 1944: 43-5) about the Tiahuanacoid association of the Middle Ancon I Incised, or Teatino, style. It would appear, therefore, at least in sites of the Tiahuanacoid I period yet excavated on the Central Coast, that we are dealing again with 2 main strains, the intrusive and the local, the former being true Wari Polychrome-derived Tiahuanacoid and the latter being represented by 2 local regional styles, Maranga and Teatino. Doubtless, as other pre-Tiahuanacoid regional styles are dis- covered along with the Tiahuanacoid wares in these regions, the same pattern will hold true, while at the same time explaining same re- gional variations which have been puzzling students of the period.

This blending, begin- ning in Tiahuanacoid I, becomes the dominant characteristic of Tiahuanacoid II in all 3 coastal regions. In other words, while stylistic fusion is not a keynote of Tiahuanacoid I, its earliest manifestations can be seen therein, and they become widespread and all-important in Tia- huanacoid II. On the North Coast, the tremendous strength of the pre-Tiahuanacoid Mochica style makes for an outstanding example of the pat- tern already noted for Tiahuanacoid I. Larco (1948: 37-40, Pls. 15, 16) points this out in perhaps the soundest bit of nomenclature yet given to Peruvian ceramic styles when he refers to the 2 strains as Mochica-Wari (Mochica with Wari influence) and Wari Nortefio A (first appearance of Wari-derived ceramics on the North Coast), while emphasizing the co- existence of the two. The Sierra-derived cera- mics found by Uhle on a terrace of the Huaca del Sol in the Moche valley (Kroeber 1925, P1. 63 a-c) are also typical of Wari Nortefio A or classic Coast Tiahuanacoid I. The Wari Poly- chrome Fine influence on Mochica seems to be mainly one of bringing a bit of the polychrome tradition to an essentially bichrome style, while at the same time the beginning of a breakdown in the great Mochica modeling tradition is seen. On the other hand, Mochica influence as seen in Wari Nortefio A appears to be mainly confined to bringing about a greater emphasis on modeled ware than is generally found in Tiahuanacoid I ceramics of other re- gions. The North Coast, however, affords a fine example of that confusion mentioned earlier. In spite of the clarity of the picture for "Mo- chica-land," the remainder of the North Coast is obscure indeed for the Tiahuanacoid periods. Mochica domination and stylistic saturation has been proven for only 5 North Coast valleys (Chicama to Santa), but the pre-Tiahuanacoid styles for the important Huarmey-Nepefia re- gion to the south and the equally important Jequetepeque-Motupe region to the north are as yet unknown. Much more field work is needed on the North Coast to isolate hitherto unknown pre-Tiahuanacoid local styles as well as to trace the northward diffusion of the Tiahuanacoid influence. When Schaedel re- ports on his North Coast field work of the early 1950's he can do much to clarify this picture. In the Tiahuanacoid II period, the pattern of development shown in Figures 1, 2, and 3 becomes most apparent. During this time the name, "Fusional," generally given to the whole Tiahuanacoid epoch, is most apt. The purity of the 2 strains, pre-Tiahuanacoid local and Wari Polychrome-derived intrusive, starts to decline to a marked degree, while some local styles die out completely. Elements from practically all styles within a given region, and often from outside as well, appear and blend with both main strains, decaying and transforming the two. There is a general shaking up and sifting out of intrusive and local stylistic elements and the beginning of their ultimate blending into the eventual final regional styles of the epoch of Kingdoms and Confederations. In Tiahuanacoid II the ceramic picture is the most confusing of all, as there now are 3 main strains to contend with: decadent intrusive, decadent pre-Tiahuanacoid local, and incipient new regional. The artistic result of all this thrashing about would be an expected decline in quality and a rash of ill-conceived stylistic mergers. Such an expectation is thoroughly justified, for Tiahuanacoid II exhibits some of the most bone-chilling artistic abortions to be found in any ancient art! True, here and there are encountered some fairly happy stylistic marriages and an occasional decadent piece still retaining some beauty and dignity, but in general the Tiahuanacoid II period ceramics are best left by the art lover to the unwilling archaeologist! As a note apart from the theme of this piece, Tiahuanacoid II textiles and small artifacts are often, strangely enough, among the loveliest encountered in Peruvian prehis- tory. On the South Coast, the Tiahuanacoid II styles still are called by a great variety of names. Among them are: Nazca Y, Rukana, Early Ica, Ica Epigonal, and Middle Ica. Some of the Middle Ica ware rightly belongs, how- ever, to Tiahuanacoid III. It is extremely dif- ficult to point out by present nomenclature Tiahuanacoid II stylistic development on the South Coast, since many of the stylistic names listed above seem to be catchalls for wares 64 [ XXII, 1, 1956</page><page sequence="7">COASTAL TIAHUANACOID STYLES showing all the strains existent at the time. Also, the pre-Tiahuanacoid local styles of the extremely important Chincha and Pisco valleys are still unknown. Table 2 contains an attempt to clarify this picture. Still another factor is that various components of the pre-Tiahuana- coid Nazca style persist for a great time in the South Coast region. Some of these pieces even occur in association with pure Tiahuanacoid III ceramics and might well be stylistically "Nazca Z," as both chronologically and artis- tically they are surely the end! The Central Coast, although complicated in the Tiahuanacoid II period, is again simpler than the South Coast. The Maranga style has died out, leaving only a small legacy of some design and form elements to the developing new regional style. The Middle Ancon I In- cised, or Teatino, style is practically dead. There are a few decadent incised, mainly utility vessels remaining, but the style has generally developed into quite a virile strain of pressed ware (Strong 1925, Pl. 44 G, I; 45 B, I), known locally in Peru as Pativilca. This strain persists until the final crystallization of the Chancay style to come. The Wari Polychrome Fine strain has decayed to a large degree and has accumulated a number of influences from other areas, notable among them one from the Huarmey-Supe region to the North. It is this strain that Tello called Sub-Huaylas. The poly- chrome tradition is dying, and during the course of the Tiahuanacoid II period disappears entirely, leaving behind it only some of its de- sign elements. These often appear in extremely simplified and sometimes well-nigh unrecogniz- able form. The local style, eventually to emerge in the form of the well-known Chancay Black- on-White, is forming itself out of various ele- ments derived from its predecessors as well as others which develop at this time. A large percentage of the ware which Strong (Strong 1952, Pls. 44 A, B, D-F, H-M, P, R; 45 A, E, H, L) calls Middle Ancon II (Table 2) can be placed in this category, as well as much of the locally named "Huaura" style (Mejia X. 1953). What is happening in the important southern part of the Central Coast at this time, that is, Lurin-Cafiete, is still a mystery TABLE 2.

When these are made, however, the pattern will doubtless be seen to be similar. On the North Coast, in Tiahuanacoid II, the same changes are taking place, although here complicated by the influences of 2 strong styles not yet fully understood. One is Lam- bayeque, probably coming from some focus in the Chiclayo area, and the other Cajamarca, coming from the north highland basin of the same name. The former makes its greatest contribution to the emerging, ultimate, Chimui style, while the latter's influence is more fleet- ing and serves mainly as a confusing factor while at the same time pointing out the fusional nature of the Tiahuanacoid II period. Among the North Coast Tiahuanacoid II styles are Wari Nortefio B, Lambayeque, Wari- Lambayeque, Santa, and a portion of the Mid- dle Moche ware. Wari Nortefio B refers mainly to ceramics showing the decadence of the in- trusive Wari Polychrome strain. The other terms generally refer to the usual mixture of strains found at this time. Some show to a great degree the final breakdown of the preced- ing local Mochica style; others, a pretty un- happy mixture of strains presaging, however, the fine Chimui style yet to come (Table 2). An interesting footnote to the development of the period on the North Coast is the seeming comparative weakness, chronologically speak- ing, of the Wari Polychrome influence in this region. Two possible explanations come to mind. One, the greater distance from the styl- istic focus, and two, the tremendous virility of the Mochica culture which antedated the Tia- huanacoid spread. It may well be a combina- tion of these factors which provides the an- swer, as strength of preceding style alone does not seem to be enough. Witness the South Coast, where the Nazca style, although itself possessing great vitality, does not prevent the long life of, and general saturation of the re- gion by, the intrusive highland influences. The Tiahuanacoid III periods (Table 3) ex- hibit the same similarity to one another, re- gionally speaking, as the two preceding, but the general aspect of Tiahuanacoid III is en- tirely different. There seems to be practically an end to the experimentation and confusion. A return to a transformed version of the re- gional development which preceded the high- land intrusion can be plainly discerned. The intrusive influences are almost dead and the final regional styles have almost completely crystallized. True, certain former influences still crop up from time to time as witness the Nazca "Z" pieces mentioned above, some broken down Central Coast kero forms showing vestiges of highland designs, and in the North revolting examples of what remains of the ear- lier, powerful, anthropomorphic collar jars (Bennett 1946, P1. 41 C). On the South Coast, the Middle Ica style (Bennett 1946, Pls. 44 D; 45 A), soon to become the well-known Chin- cha-Ica ware, has practically finished its ab- sorption of Nazca and highland influences, while the remnants of these two are fast dis- appearing. The polychrome tradition has now ended all along the coast. What remains is an interesting general use of black, white, and red in design. While the basing of "horizons" on simple color techniques such as this can be misleading in the extreme, and while the Black-White-Red ceramics of Tiahuanacoid III differ greatly regionally, the general use of this color scheme at this time is extremely fascinat- ing and would merit future study. On the Central Coast, the Huaura style has reached the Black- White-Red stage in the main, and the local pressed ware and highland- influenced strains are on their last legs. In present excavations by the Peruvian Govern- ment at Ancon Necropolis, a number of white vessels, that would not be out of place in the classic Chancay style to follow, have turned up in grave association with fine examples of Tiahuanacoid III. Lest this occasion any doubt as to relative chronological position, the author hastens to say that Ancon grave stratigraphy conclusively places classic Chancay at a later time. In the North, the modeled blackware style, soon to become Chimu, has almost crystallized, although the North Coast version of Black- White-Red (Bennett 1946, PI. 41 A-D) con- tinues to accompany it. That part of the previous highland influences in form and de- sign that will become a component of the Chimu style is now virtually fully integrated. Simultaneously the same highland influences are seen on the Black-White-Red ware in their most diffused and decadent forms. Tia- huanacoid III somehow gives the impression of having had a short time depth, at least com- pared to Tiahuanacoid II. It seems to be a period more of consolidation than of continu- ing fusion and change. To aid the reader in 66 [ XXII, 1, 1956</page><page sequence="9">COASTAL TIAHUANACOID STYLES relating the above to existing nomenclature, the following typical Tiahuanacoid III stylistic man- ifestations may be pointed out: for the South Coast, Middle Ica; for the Central Coast, some of Middle Canfete, Pachacamac D, Late Ancon I, and Black-White-Red Geometric; and for the North Coast, Middle Moche IIC, Huaca de la Cruz, and Taitacantin. Some of these terms are alternatives. They are merely set forth here as illustrative of both the typical styles of the period and the existent confusion in the nomenclature of Peruvian archaeology. Taking into account all of the above, the general pattern of the development of the Coast Tiahuanacoid styles would seem to be somewhat along the following lines (Figs. 1, 2, 3). At first, one or more intrusive highland strains come in contact with one or more firmly established local strains in each of the 3 coastal regions. During this initial period, the local and intrusive strains keep their separate identities to a great degree, while at the same time they show their coexistence by grave as- sociation. As the initial period progresses, the 2 strains begin to break down and decay, and at the same time give some of their various design and form elements to the inception of the new local style to come. Out of these stylistic gifts, plus regional developmental ef- forts, the final local style will emerge. The second phase is that of the almost complete decline of the former local style or styles as well as of the intrusive strains. At this time, the fusional currents between the 2 stylistic elements are at their flood. The ob- vious upheaval now taking place in the old Regional Florescent structure with its attendant breaking down of previous geographical and/or political divisions is bringing with it a merger of many strains that formerly had been distinct. Add to this the fact that many of these strains have yet to be discovered and typed in their pre-Tiahuanacoid form, and the confusion mentioned at the beginning of this article is at least partially explained. The final stage seems to be one of elimination of the last vestiges of the 2 main original strains, local and highland intrusive, in any- thing approaching their pure forms. There is also the consolidation of various original ele- ments with those having arrived during the previous period, thus achieving a sound and almost completely formed basis for the future regional style. This stage is also one of elimina- tion of many design and form elements which were prominent during the extreme fusion of the second stage. At this time as well, form analysis of ceramics reveals a tendency to go back to a number of forms in general use during the pre-Tiahuanacoid days and in com- parative eclipse during the fusional epoch's height. This tendency merits a great deal of future study, which, however, must be left until greater knowledge of the pre-Tiahuana- coid regional styles is possessed. TABLE 3.

It is important not only to the study of the Tiahuanacoid periods themselves, but also can serve as a guidepost in the study of the type and diffusion of the Tiahuanaco influence which is such an important one in Peruvian prehistory. In the study of the Tiahuanacoid periods, the local preceding style plays a large part in the development during the fusional epoch. As can be seen from points previously made, the strength of the early local style de- termines to a large part the direction of fusional development as well as the make-up of the ultimate regional style. It would also seem that the stronger the local style was, the longer it persisted during the Tiahuanacoid periods in mutated and decadent forms. When these are encountered in field research without associa- tions, they tend to create a great deal of chronological uncertainty. The author hopes that he has here made a case for 2 lines of endeavor in the future: (1) a great deal more field work in the Regional Florescent civilizations not yet fully known; and (2) a reappraisal of present Tiahuanacoid nom- enclature. There is no quarrel with the use of distinctive terms for ceramic manifestations when one is primarily concerned with the study of the ceramics themselves. This is merely a plea for a concerted effort among Peruvianists to correlate such terms with their chronological position in the framework of the development of Peruvian prehistory. When this is made, a great stride forward will have been taken, and the future field work will serve to round out a clearer picture. Actually, the developmental pattern itself of the coastal Tiahuanacoid per- iods would appear to be a fairly straightforward one along the lines suggested above.

GUNNERSON ARECONSIDERATION of material col- lected from Promontory Point, north central Utah (Steward 1937) suggests that Promontory- Plains relationships may be closer than hitherto realized. Moreover, while several traits of the Promontory culture occur in more than one Plains archaeological complex, some are limited to the Dismal River aspect, suggesting the pos- sibility of close ties between the Dismal River and Promontory peoples. Steward noted that a few traits (hoop and dart game, hand game bones, side notched projectile points, end scrap- ers) represented in the Promontory culture were also found in the Plains. Hill and Met- calf (1941: 188, 197) pointed out that tubular steatite pipes and blunt bone "punches" or "flakers" occurred in both Promontory and Dis- mal River. This paper enumerates still other resemblances. The worked stone of the Promontory culture is remarkably similar to that of the Plains in general and Dismal River in particular. End scrapers, extremely common in the Plains but uncommon in the Great Basin, occur in the Promontory assemblage. One specimen (Stew- ard 1937, Fig. 28 e) has a carefully worked tang or graver point at one end of the scraper * This paper was read in essentially its present form at the 1956 Annual Meeting of the Society for American Archaeology. edge. In the Plains such tanged scrapers have thus far been reported only from Dismal River (Champe 1949: 289), and may prove diag- nostic of that complex. Another trait common to both Promontory and Dismal River, but less diagnostic, is the presence of a cutting, scraping, or chopping edge on otherwise roughly shaped or unshaped pieces of flint, qtuartzite, or other stone. Promontory projectile points represent a wider variety of shapes than do Dismal River points, but most Dismal River types occur in the Promontory assemblage. The use of tubular steatite pipes is a trait shared by Promontory and Dismal River. The Promontory assem- blage contains sandstone arrowshaft smoothers which are common throughout the Plains and elsewhere, and incised stone tablets which are lacking in Dismal River but occur in other protohistoric Plains complexes such as Lower Loup (protohistoric Pawnee) and Oneota, and in historic Pawnee (Wedel 1938: 9). Finally, the general appearance of Promontory stone- work, with its wide variability in quality of workmanship, is reminiscent of Dismal River. The majority of Promontory potsherds are tempered with large pieces of limestone, in which respect they differ radically from Dismal River pottery. The remaining Promontory sherds, however, are tempered with fine quartz or sand, and in some cases mica is included. Many of these are well within the range of GUNNERSON ] 69</page></plain_text>
