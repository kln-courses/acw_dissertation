<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE CHIMAERA GROUP AT CORINTH</page><page sequence="2">THE CHIMAERA GROUP AT CORINTH NOWLEDGE of the Corinthian pottery industry as an artistic and economic entity in the Archaic Greek world is slowly being won, partly as a result of continuous excavation at Corinth and elsewhere, partly by advanced understanding of the groups of vase painters and potters.' The latter depends mostly on stylistic connoisseurship. For the Middle Corinthian Chimaera Group, a quarter century's study has brought many clarifications.2 Besides, at Corinth alone, there are now sixteen pieces attributable to the Chimaera Painter, three to the Painter of Louvre E 574, and eight attributions to other hands in the Chimaera Group. Together with many other pieces that were not known twenty, or even ten, years ago, these have provided a test of the stylistic criteria previously obtained, clarified the development and relationships of the Chimaera Group, and given us a much sounder idea of the activity and definition of a group of Archaic Corinthian craftsmen. This progress is due also to the generosity of museums who have made the material accessible for personal inspection.3 The Chimaera Painter's list published here amounts to thirty-nine items, that of the Painter of Louvre E 574 to seventeen; the Riehen Painter still has only six. Nearly fifty other pieces are listed; among them four hands can be isolated, one of which may be an aspect of the Chimaera Painter himself. A dozen pieces, representing many more, must be discussed only to be excluded from this Group. The purpose and scope of the present study is best explained by anticipating and summarizing its conclusions. The Chimaera Painter's activity begins with the dawn of Middle Corinthian. It is virtually unanticipated by any previous style or trend. His is one of the new styles that I Amyx's lists in CorVP now supersede all earlier ones. 2 The most important contributions, besides Amyx's, are those of Lawrence (1959), Callipolitis-Feytmans (1962), Rafn (1978), and, finally, the publication of the Potters' Quarter pottery in Corinth XV, iii (1984). 3 The collections and persons to whom thanks are due include all those represented in the lists; even where material proved to be inaccessible (the Piazza S. Francesco deposit at Catania, the majority of the Perachora fragments in Athens), every effort was made to be of assistance. Without the generosity that enabled personal examination of almost every piece, progress would have been impossible. In the case of the unpublished pieces, special thanks are due to the Fondazione Mormino in Palermo, to Charalambos Kritzas at Argos, to Hildegund Gropengiesser at Heidelberg, to Vincenzo Tusa at Palermo, and to E. G. Pemberton for providing sections of her catalogue (Corinth XVIII, i) in advance of publication. I owe my knowledge of X29 and L4 initially toJ. L. Benson, of R5 to D. von Bothmer, of L2, L8, and S7 to D. A. Amyx, of X13 and X19 to C. Neeft, of X15 and X22 to N. Bookidis, and of X14 and X19 to A. B. Brownlee, although they bear no responsibility for my opinions where these differ from their own. Besides the American Excavations at Corinth, several institutions have generously provided and permitted me to publish new photographs; these are credited on p. vii above. For the profile drawings, as for the tracings, I am myself responsible, but Denise Plauche was of great assistance in the final preparation of the profiles and reconstruction drawings and the arrangement of the plates. For thirty-five years' help and encouragement, as well as recent advice, this study owes much of what may gain his approbation to D. A. Amyx. Finally, Charles K. Williams and Nancy Bookidis at the Corinth Excavations have assisted me in every way imaginable; without pulling together all the material at Corinth, it would have been impossible to do more than reconsider, with a slightly expanded corpus, the stylistic evidence as such; "The Chimaera Group at Corinth" is due to their help.</page><page sequence="3">56 PATRICIA LAWRENCE justify and define the term "Middle Corinthian". Among the components of his early style are ideas and motifs boldly adapted from Attic work of his time. As the artist who designed and developed the influential plate with a heraldic motif in its tondo, the Chimaera Painter remains, certainly, the dominant artist in the Chimaera Group. Unlike his principal companion, he did some work on pyxides and bowls, as well as on plates, clay plaques, and aryballoi; his are the only pyxides in the Chimaera Group. His early plates with floral crosses,4 which, like his horse protomai and regardant lions, may reflect his interest in Attic work of the end of the 7th century, seem to be securely attributed; the more difficult floral crosses, K1-K5, at a later date, may also be his. The hypothesis that his more detailed or more tightly drawn work is the earlier is borne out by the development of the profile of plates within Middle Corinthian and within the Chimaera Group. His activity seems to cease at a date estimated as ca. 580 B.C., that is, perhaps as much as a decade before the time when most Corinthian artists adopted habits that we should call "Late Corinthian". The Painter of Louvre E 574 proves to be, in spite of the pretentious manner that he adopted for those plates, the hand of the famous Copenhagen plates and of other work related to them, as well as of the aryballoi and alabastra which prove that he was the Columbus Painter's pupil. Since all his other work seems to be later than his namepiece, and that later than the Chimaera Painter's early work, he is clearly the younger artist. The late work of his Early Corinthian teacher, the Columbus Painter, is contemporary with work that we should call Middle Corinthian. Only three of his nine plates are arguably as early as most of his closed vases or as early as any of the plates attributed to the Chimaera Painter. The other six may well be contemporary with the beginnings of Late Corinthian work. It is suggested that he was the Chimaera Painter's successor as principal decorator of plates. Since he was as fine a draughtsman as the Chimaera Painter, and evidently only a little younger, the picture that emerges suggests that the Chimaera Painter may have governed plate production through the first two decades or so of Middle Corinthian; at least, he seems to have guarded his prerogatives. The Painter of Louvre E 574 was the only artist in the Chimaera Group who decorated alabastra; this fact and the type of his felines confirm his uniquely close relationship to the Columbus Painter. As a plate decorator, he depends heavily on the Chimaera Painter, who in turn, at the period of their closest association, uses some of his ideas in decorating flat-bottomed aryballoi. His latest pieces bear motifs that must derive from work in a medium other than vase painting. His career spanned at least a quarter century. None of the other recognizable hands are artists of the same stature. The Riehen Painter is heavily dependent on the leading artists. The Painter of Gela G. 9 is competent but undistinguished. Both decorated plates that belong to the Chimaera Group, and neither hand has been recognized on vases that belong to other stylistic groups. Thus, they seem to be members of the Chimaera Group, but one wonders whether hands that have only a few attributions, in a weakly defined style, were not mere occasional helpers (conceivably only members of the major artists' families) who could be called upon to help fill an order. Some explanation is required for the dumbfounding number of hands in 4 Callipolitis-Feytmans 1962, p. 135 (second paragraph in fine print).</page><page sequence="4">THE CHIMAERA GROUP AT CORINTH 57 Corinthian black figure, relative to the large, but quite reasonable, number of distinctive styles and continuous traditions. Several plate fragments from Selinous in a good but hesitant style dependent primarily on the Painter of Louvre E 574 are by a hand not recognized elsewhere and are easily imagined as arriving in a single shipment. The case of the much discussed Rhodes aryballos, U2, quite unattributable, is somewhat different; there the style is excellent and distinctive. Since the Painter of Louvre E 574 decorated no lekanoid bowls (and the Chimaera Painter's use of such a bowl for tondo decoration seems to stem from his unusual interest in Attic work), it is not surprising that the hands of the bowls P1 and P2 and Q1 and Q2, respectively, are dependent specifically on the Chimaera Painter. The question of the Carrousel Painter also has had to be reconsidered, now that his little animal-frieze plates seem to be no earlier than the Chimaera Painter's first large, heraldic ones, and some later, larger, and very much worse plates, unrelated to Chimaera Group style, seem to be his; these seem to lead straight to certain silhouette-technique plates of advanced MC date. Was he really, even at the date of the very small plates securely attributed to his hand and related to early work of the Chimaera Painter, a member of the Chimaera Group? The profiles of the plates suggest either that the proper Chimaera Group plate is simply a standard Middle Corinthian plate or that the mediocre animal-frieze plates were actually made and decorated in the same workshop as the showy ones but painted by hacks. The majority of MC plates, with similar profiles, may have been made in one workshop; if the master artist's exercise of "prerogative" has been correctly interpreted, that shop was governed (if not owned) successively by the Chimaera Painter and the Painter of Louvre E 574. The major vase painters may even have done most of the potters' work. Whether they did or not, the Chimaera Group is defined by the painters' work on plates, and the painters (or painter-potters) seem to have been in charge of the operation. The Chimaera Painter's work on pyxides and the Painter of Louvre E 574's work on alabastra may have been executed in other shops. It might seem likely that the flat- bottomed aryballoi were, too, but four hands in the Group occasionally worked on this shape, and the aryballoi are somewhat distinctive. In particular, they differ from the majority of those attributed to the Otterlo Painter, which are less globular and often have short strokes between the petal tips on the shoulder. The Erlenmeyer and Otterlo Painters are not members of the Chimaera Group. Neither of them borrowed any more from the Group than Sophilos did from the Chimaera Painter. Neither of them decorated a plate. The Erlenmeyer Painter's large alabastra were made by a less skillful potter than those of the Painter of Louvre E 574. Their emulation of the Chimaera Group occurs on only a few vases for a short time. Their use of heavy animals is implicit in their decorating large aryballoi and alabastra. There is no such thing as a "Heavy Style" or a "Majestic Lions Group". The Otterlo Painter's relationship to the Chimaera Group is trivial, confined to the heads and shoulders of lions alone on a couple of his aryballoi. Two aryballoi by the Riehen Painter may have adopted traits from his.5 5 Cf. also the Galera Painter, in Benson 1971, p. 18.</page><page sequence="5">58 PATRICIA LAWRENCE Picture plates, like Payne's NC 1056, and several other fine pieces must also be excluded. Theirs is a different kind of excellence. The foregoing conclusions differ, in some places radically, from previous publications, including the writer's own, on the Chimaera Group. The attributions on which they depend differ from even the latest published lists.6 Besides new attributions, some pieces need careful reanalysis. The Chimaera Group had a rather homogeneous repertory and were interested in each other's work, so each hand's style (how he draws) must be distinguished from learnable types of creatures7 and, above all, from shared repertory. Both major artists used confronted horse protomai, both used winged figures, both painted terracotta plaques. At least three hands in the Group (four, if the Painter of the Kameiros Plates is not the Chimaera Painter himself) used floral crosses. Thus, the conclusions proposed here emerged only when surer attributions and a more cogent relative chronology of the painters' styles were correlated with the development of their plate profiles and these with work on other vase shapes. When the relative chronology of the entire Group had been worked out, the Group could be defined and described as a working entity in the Archaic Corinthian industry. The study will be presented as follows (for the lists of attributions, with bibliography, see pp. 117-132): Connoisseurship The Chimaera Painter; his relation to Attic work (List X: chi for Chimaera) The Painter of Louvre E 574 and his relation to the Columbus Painter (List L) The Riehen Painter (List R) The Painter of Gela G. 9 (List G) The Painter of the Kameiros Plates (List K) Painters of Lekanoid Bowls (Lists P and Q) The Style of Some Plates at Selinous (List S) The Carrousel Painter (List V, for Vienna) Chronology The relative chronology of the vase paintings in the Chimaera Group Developmental criteria for the chronology of Chimaera Group plate profiles Definition of the Chimaera Group Description of the Group as a working entity Work to be excluded from the Chimaera Group CONNOISSEURSHIP THE CHIMAERA PAINTER (List X; Pls. 38-49) The lioness on the Cincinnati plate, X4, so vividly recalls the Louvre lioness, X7, and the New York chimaera, X6, that several significant differences may escape notice. 6 CorVP, pp. 165-174. 7 Since Corinthian animals are much simpler and more formulaic than nude or draped human figures in Archaic Attic red figure, reliance on configurations must be intensified when dealing with incised animals a century earlier (D. G. Kurtz ["Gorgos' Cup," JHS 103, 1983, pp. 68-86, pls. III-IX] restates and fullyjustifies Beazley's reliance on configurations); with animal friezes, very finely honed discrimination is necessary.</page><page sequence="6">THE CHIMAERA GROUP AT CORINTH 59 There is no separately rendered topknot in front of the ear, the ruff is filled simply with parallel lines, and the shoulder is divided by a double line. The large eye has a single teardrop-shaped cell drawn beneath it, the cavity of the mouth is very large and deep, and the tip of the tongue curls up. All these traits derive from the Columbus Painter, an older artist, who is intricately related to the Chimaera Group.8 Even in X7 the roaring mouth has begun to assume tamer proportions, yet stylistically the Cincinnati and Louvre lionesses seem practically identical because of their shape and their disposition in the tondo; the design of the forelegs and the structure of the head alone would suffice to guarantee the attribution. The use of double-centered rosettes on X4 and of a single, large lotus bud on X7 represents alternative treatment of the field. Corinth KP 2902, X5 (PI. 38), is a tiny fragment from the head of a closely similar lion. The preserved part is structurally the same as X4 and X7; the band across the muzzle has added red instead of the usual meandering incision. The fabric and technique are as fine as on X4. Corinth C-69-185, X9 (PI. 39), from the Sanctuary of Demeter and Kore on Acro- corinth, is another obvious attribution on which foundations may be laid. The compo- sitional scheme is that of the Mykonos plate, X37 (two lions with crossed hindquarters turn their heads to face center, and their intertwined tails rise to fill the space between them and to strengthen the central axis of the design), but the incised details are quite different and the drawing far neater. The attribution of the Mykonos lions depended on the Vienna chimaera, X28; this one depends on X6 and X4. One of the lions, indeed, still has the Columbus Painter's double line dividing the shoulder, but the other has the Chimaera Painter's customary marking: two single lines within the shoulder divide it into three areas. The ears are not round (as on the Louvre and Cincinnati lionesses) but heart-shaped (as on the two chimaeras). On one lion the ruff has simple, parallel hatching, but on the other the hatching shifts direction decoratively, as on X6 and X7. One has an eye drawn with a single circle, the other with an inner circle for the pupil, as on X28. The contours of the topknots (the paint is partly flaked away) and of the oral cavities are closest to those on X6, and the tongue is still fairly long, but the pouch below the eye on both lions has the amoeboid shape, based neither on nature nor on Assyrian lions,9 that is a trademark of the Chimaera Group (above the eyes there is still a simple brow line). In sum, X9 ties together the central group of attributions. The attribution of the terracotta plaque Corinth KN 55, X23, like that of X5, is easy because a critical part of the lion's jaw and ruff is preserved. The ruff is that of the Vienna chimaera, X28. Given this much, the design of the head could be reconstructed with fair confidence.10 It must have been a magnificent plaque, with the entire mane rendered in separate flame-shaped locks. Such manes ceased to be customary after the Transitional style in Corinth, after the time of the great Vari kraters and the Aigina and Kerameikos chimaeras in Athens (for their relation to the Chimaera Painter, see the next section, pp. 65-69 below). The Chimaera Painter evidently disliked the shorthand, crosshatched 8 Much of what the Columbus Painter transmitted was learned from the Painter of Palermo 489; CorVP, pp. 85-86. 9 In Attica it occurs at least as early; see p. 68 below. 10 Corinth XV, iii, pl. 112. Missing parts are based on X6, X7, and X28.</page><page sequence="7">60 PATRICIA LAWRENCE mane, which the Group inherited from the Columbus Painter and the Painter of Louvre E 574 retained, for he used it only once, on the pyxis X26, in the middle of his career. A larger fragment, from the floor of a plate, Corinth C-62-605, X24, which Amyx and I agree must be by the Chimaera Painter, cannot be reconstructed; the snaky parts should be part of a Typhon, and we have no complete Typhon of his. The part of a wing bow on the reverse could belong to a swan (Typhon and swan occur together on L5) or to a siren or even an eagle. This attribution depends on style in the strictest sense of the word. The incised lines terminating in distinctive tiny, tapered hooks, as the artist lifts the incising tool and brings it back to draw the next scaly mark on the serpent, can only be matched in the Chimaera Painter, and best on X28. As negative evidence, the proof that the Perachora Typhon, L5, is by the Painter of Louvre E 574 (see below) is valuable, because the snake coils of the two Typhons are thoroughly different in shape, proportions, and incisions, although they are of the same basic type. Corinth CP-3245, X15 (PI. 38), a newly inventoried and very beautiful plate fragment, adds a heraldic griffin (or griffin-bird) to the Chimaera Painter's repertory. The center of the plate being indicated by the rings on the underside, the composition has to have consisted of the lotus rooted at the left-hand side of the tondo (part of one tendril is also preserved), with a griffin occupying the other two thirds of the circle. The double jowl and the vertical band on the neck guarantee a griffin's head, but one too unusual to be completed, even in its general lines, on the basis of other Corinthian griffins. A lion-griffin, with the forelegs as on X6 and the hindquarters as on X9, allowing the tail to cross onto the rim, is more easily accommodated with the lotus in a twenty-centimeter tondo (the whole plate was as large as X16) than a griffin-bird with its tail. The forms are very sturdy and the drawing deliberate, as on X16, but the lotus has almost EC proportions, and the tightly controlled meandering line across the lotus is closest to that on the lioness's muzzle on X4, and X7 is the only other plate with a single lotus growing from the edge of the tondo. Two plates that Humfry Payne assigned "probably" to the Chimaera Painter were attributed to him in Lawrence 1959. The attribution of the Louvre male-siren plate, X30, has been accepted almost unanimously.'1 On this Louvre siren and the Boread on the shoulder of the Hermitage pyxis, X26, another accepted attribution, three more attributions depend. Independently, Amyx and I attributed the Perachora Boread, X31, to the Chimaera Painter. The face of the Boread on X31 is that of the Louvre male siren, his body conformation, garment, and limbs those of the Hermitage Boread. Like the Vienna chimaera, X28, these heavy-limbed creatures with bold features, free of finicky detail, represent the Chimaera Painter in his most idiosyncratic vein, independent of both the tradition of the Columbus Painter and influence from his major companion, the Painter of Louvre E 574. This is Middle Corinthian at its strongest, replacing exhausted Early Corinthian formulas with entirely new ones. Artists respond variously to change; the 11 Callipolitis-Feytmans (1962, p. 135) objected to its incisions' continuing beyond the paint contour. It is, instead, the Painter of Louvre E 574 who controls his incisions painstakingly. The Chimaera Painter's, even on the early pieces and generally on the mature ones, are not slovenly but often go beyond the contour. Another sign of his relatively rapid line is the tapered hook in which incisions terminate as he lifts his stylus.</page><page sequence="8">THE CHIMAERA GROUP AT CORINTH 61 Chimaera Painter's response to the advent of High Archaic is analogous to the Kleophrades Painter's to Early Classical. Callipolitis-Feytmans attributed two plates bearing figures with sickle wings to the "Painter of the Copenhagen Sphinxes" (the Painter of Louvre E 574), and Benson accepted her attributions.12 It seems unlikely that two talented decorators were restricted to given subjects. Emulation, rather, was the rule. Benson assigned Corinth KP 2122, X32 (PI. 44), to the same hand as X31, as is obviously correct, since they are replicas (except that X32 omits the lower pair of wings) and drawn identically, but his attribution is to the "Copenhagen Painter" (sic). The attribution of X31, however, to the Chimaera Painter (X26, X30) is certain, and we agree that X32 goes with it. The tendency to restrict the Chimaera Painter to feline subjects amounts to equating repertory with style. Thus, too, the sickle-winged sphinxes on Li have "attracted" all the other creatures with sickle wings, whether or not similarly drawn. Furthermore, X26, the vase that confirms the attribution of X31 and X32 to the Chimaera Painter, is a pyxis; the attributions of the Boreads to the wrong hand were made in a study confined to plates. With X31 and X32 secure, the attribution of X33 (once freed from KP 1455 a13), another replica (PI. 44), is assured. When we call the Chimaera Painter an original artist, we do not preclude large editions. Like K1-K3, X31-X33 are true replicas, not merely versions of the same compositional idea, like X2 and L14. Berlin F 3934, X34, is the second plate given to the Chimaera Painter in 1959 that Payne had thought probably his. It is not in any sense a replica of the Boreads just discussed. Amyx, Johansen, and Rafn accept the attribution; Callipolitis-Feytmans and Benson, the latter emphatically,'4 reject it. My original arguments were inadequate; we now know that the type of beard is originally but not exclusively the Chimaera Painter's, and the chronological position of X34 must be grounded on more than generalizations. The attribution, however, is fully secured, for FlemmingJohansen's attribution of the Ny Carlsberg plate, X10, rests both on the New York chimaera, X6, and on X34. First we must review that attribution. Like X24, X10 is decorated on both sides. On the face, a sturdy, jaunty winged Artemis, radically unlike the hieratic Potniai on the alabastra from Delos, 5 walks to right holding two swans firmly by their necks. As preening swans, they must have been lifted from another context.16 In the tondo on the bottom, the artist has given us no mere protome but the entire forequarters of a cavorting billy goat, perhaps the least conventional goat in all of Corinthian vase painting. He falls between the goats of the two chimaeras, X6 and X28, with precise, detailed markings like the former and the freer manner and more goatish character of the latter. The filling ornament is closer to that 12 Callipolitis-Feytmans 1962, p. 135; Corinth XV, iii, no. 774, p. 152, note 3, and no. 765, p. 151, note 1. '3 Style apart (for that of KP 1455 a, see p. 112 below), the two fragments differ in color (though they would yield the same number from the Munsell soil-color chart), texture of clay, and (under magnification) texture of glaze-paint. Measured at the red band on the bottom, for KP 1455 a, Th. 0.007 m.; for KP 1455 b, Th. 0.008 m. There is a turning scar on the bottom of each; on KP 1455 a, it is 0.009 m. from the red band, on KP 1455 b, 0.013 m. The red bands, also, are not quite the same width. 14 Corinth XV, iii, no. 774, p. 153, note 3. 15 Ddlos X, nos. 450, 451, pis. XXXIII, LXVII. 16 See p. 68 below.</page><page sequence="9">62 PATRICIA LAWRENCE on X6, but the goat is more massive and vigorous than that of its chimaera. Although the Potnia is unique for the Chimaera Painter, her arm muscles are those of the replicated Boreads, X31-X33, and of the Boreads on all three of his pyxides, X17 (Pls. 40:b, 41:a), X26, and X39 (P1. 47:d); note that those on the pyxides are less than a third of her height (22.5 centimeters). These broad shoulders and short, sturdy arms with their characteristic markings are dear to the Chimaera Painter. Every anthropomorphic figure attributable (on other grounds) to the Painter of Louvre E 574 will be found to lack these markings and have longer, slenderer arms. The Ny Carlsberg plate is a marvel; the Chimaera Painter, although entirely within the conventions of the early 6th century, tilts the head, raises one shoulder, slants the belt, and alters the contour over the marching leg, to make an Archaic Potnia (of all subjects!) seem to live and move. Less can be claimed for the Berlin Boread, X34, but, as Johansen saw (see under X10), he is closest of all to the Potnia. His arms and shoulders, similarly marked, are even more massive than hers. The knees, we now see, are perfectly matched on X32 (P1. 44), reconfirming both attributions. The Berlin Boread is a smaller figure than the Potnia, on a smaller plate, but a similar structural logic sets him apart from the general run of MC Boreads, which tend to sprawl. If we had no chimaeras with goat parts, the attribution of X10 (with that of X34 challenged) would have required rather subtle arguments: similar use of the circular space (for the goat) and distribution of rosettes; similar structural and proportional principles; the same line quality-all real but not reducible to concrete description. Abstract descriptions are hard to distinguish from subjectivity. For Palermo, N.I. 1707, X2, my abstractions fully convinced only Rafn (1978), who had the evidence of X10 providing additional concrete indices. The entire Chimaera Group evidently liked confronted horse protomai (U1, X2, X3, L14), but the Palermo protomai share several peculiarities, zoologically indifferent, with the goat on X10. The hooves, pastern joints, and fetlocks are the same shape. The markings on the upper leg, the juncture with the shoulder, and the double stripe dividing the belly from the rib cage are remarkably similar. The mouths and noses are significantly more alike than goats and horses ought to be. Another trait, an extraordinary trait, seems to be unique to these two plates: the corners of the eyes, on goat and both horses, are left open; the lines recurve, leaving no more than a millimeter between them. Another detail, already noted,17 is the inexplicable nub exactly at the top of one horse's mane; this recurs, equally oddly, in the same position on the lions of X7 and X18 but nowhere else in the Chimaera Group. The Palermo plate must indeed be by the Chimaera Painter. So also must Corinth KP 2903, X3 (PI. 38), which seems to preserve parts of the left-hand protome from a similar plate, also with an early type of mane. If this is what the fragments represent, the long, curved muscle markings on the neck are rather unanatomical. In any case, the style, like the broad treatment of the mane, seems safely attributable to the Chimaera Painter. Judging from the publication, X3 bis, from Apollonia, smaller than X2, not only helps to confirm the attribution of X3 but also may help in interpreting that fragment. 17 Lawrence 1959, p. 353.</page><page sequence="10">THE CHIMAERA GROUP AT CORINTH 63 The Sanctuary of Demeter and Kore on Acrocorinth produced two more plates to be attributed to the Chimaera Painter. One of these, Corinth C-62-762, X16 (PI. 39), was very large. Preserved is the upper part of a crouching sphinx with parts of her forelegs, raised to press against the rim of the tondo, as on X4 and X7. The sphinx has "Volomandra locks" of an undeveloped type over her brow, similar to those of the Louvre siren, X30, and especially like those of the man in bed on X22; the generously looping wavy line framing the brow also is matched on these. Such "Volomandra locks" and the deep waves find no parallel elsewhere in the Chimaera Group. In particular, the Syracuse siren plate, L10 (P1. 52), by the Painter of Louvre E 574, may be contrasted. X16 also has a pattern of narrow rings on the bottom to match X4; L10 has a different pattern, one that none of the Chimaera Painter's plates has. Finally, the sphinx's forepaws and the hair over the shoulder, squared off at the bottom and terminated by a curved double line, is matched only on the Louvre siren, X30, and drawn identically. By contrast, we now have four large female heads, on L2 (PI. 50:b), L7, L9, and L10, by the Painter of Louvre E 574. All of these have receding chins, where the sphinx on L16 has a strong, square one. None of them has the deep waves framing the face as on X16. The sphinxes on L2 do not have raised forepaws; they do have neckbands, but these do not curve effectively to suggest a cylindrical neck, and they are decorated not with a meandering line but with a tight zigzag.18 The other Acrocorinth plate, Corinth C-62-770, X38 (PI. 44), preserves most of the forelegs and one hind paw of a crouching feline; a rosette was in the space below the belly, So far as preserved, the legs, which are in the Chimaera Painter's favorite posture, are like those of his Mykonos lions, X37, doubtless by his hand and at about the same date (see pp. 94-96 below). The relatively naturalistic leg markings common to later felines of the Chimaera Group are drawn with a much crisper nicety, and on legs of a different shape, by the Painter of Louvre E 574 on LlI and L12.'9 Thirty-five years ago it was possible (with less evidence) and necessary (to show that Lii and L12 were not a manneristic development of the Chimaera Painter) to emphasize the differences between the two major artists.20 Now we can define their styles without exaggerating their differences, and a remarkable flat-bottomed aryballos, Palermo, Mormino 621, X29 (PI. 45), shows how intimately, at least at one point in their careers, the Chimaera Painter worked with the Painter of Louvre E 574. A palmette-lotus cross, like that on Gela 8702, X25 (PI. 42:b), is flanked by lions, neither with the usual raised forepaw. Their hindquarters nearly meet at the back. The only filling ornament is two simple rosettes, between the lions' muzzles and the lotuses. X25 and X28, the Vienna chimaera, are closest in style and development. The panthers on X25 (Pls. 42:a, 43) and the lions on X29 have less elaborate details than the Vienna chimaera, but both lions on X29 have heads with its topknot, ears, and ruff (hitherto only partly preserved on X23 and weakly echoed on the Mykonos lions, X37). The curvature and spacing of the incisions 18 Privately, I have never doubted that the New York man-in-bed plate, X22, is by the Chimaera Painter; comparison with X16 and autopsy of the Boread on X39 brought me to add this small plate (an occasional, specifically funerary piece?) to his list. In fact, even the red dots (on the coverlet) are typically his; cf. X6, X7, and Xli. 19 Lii and L12 may be a little later than X37 and X38. 20 Lawrence 1959, p. 356.</page><page sequence="11">64 PATRICIA LAWRENCE in the ruff are exactly similar; compare also the side locks in the Louvre siren's beard, X30. The eyes, with amoeboid forms above and below, also match but lack the inner circle, or pupil; see X9, lion at right (P1. 39). The shape of the open mouth and tongue agrees with the Vienna chimaera. On one lion, at left, the shoulder and haunch also are typical of the mature Chimaera Painter. The other lion's body (P1. 45:b) is a nearly deceptive imitation of the Painter of Louvre E 574, as on L7 or L4 (P1. 52). "Nearly deceptive" because the Chimaera Painter has imitated the body shape and stance, as well as the markings of his companion's felines (it is strictly "in the manner of"), and has all but succeeded; his lion is not quite so trim or elegant, and, besides his own unmistakable lion's head, it has his habitual thick tail. Also, although the rest of the facing lion and the floral cross are in no one's manner but his own, both lions' forelegs have markings as on L7, markings proper to the Painter of Louvre E 574.21 Mormino 621, X29, is an exercise such as connoisseurs dream of but hardly hope for; besides suggesting that the artists were really "benchmates", it provides a valuable synchronism. A plate fragment in Bonn, X19, preserves part of a lion similar to that in the bowl X18. The lion's ear and the somewhat loosely drawn double-centered rosette leave no doubt that it is by the Chimaera Painter. Besides, its fabric is exactly that of his other plates, and the underside is decorated with evenly spaced broad bands, a pattern of his (X9, Xii, X22, X28, X30, X38) which the Painter of Louvre E 574 is not known to have used. The lion's ruff is the same as on X18, and this enclosed ruff with sawtooth locks is, of course, proper to his companion (L1, L4, L7, not preserved on L8). Such commonly borrowed configurations do not affect the style; on X19 the ear does not have the kind of elongated, soft tip that we see on L7. X20 (P1. 44) from the Asklepieion at Corinth, a fragment from a large bowl of the same type as X18 but finer and with a larger lion, has been identified and attributed (surely correctly) by Ann Brownlee. A fragment, Corinth KP 2316, X21 (P1. 44), preserves only a panther's face, a simple rosette, and the tip of a lotus sepal: evidence of a palmette-lotus cross, as on X25 and X29. The curvature of the fragment, in both directions, shows that it came from an aryballos. The basic scheme for a panther's face in the Chimaera Group is common property; each man draws it differently. In the Chimaera Painter (X25, X26), the lines for the wrinkles on the nose are pairs of round arcs, and the closely spaced ruff incisions slant outwards, to right and left. With the Painter of Louvre E 574, this face is specialized, unnaturally wide between the ears, unnaturally square in both jaws; the tip of the nose is narrow, and the wrinkles (not rounded) slant downwards; the parallel ruff incisions are nearly vertical (L9, Li i, L12); the panther face looks foxy. The face on X21 is the basic one, with arcs for the nose wrinkles: by the Chimaera Painter, earlier than X25.22 Five plates with palmette-lotus crosses, X1, Xi i-X14, it is agreed, are from one hand.23 Their profiles must also be considered in dating them, but X1 (Fig. 4, p. 117 below) and probably X13 and X14 (P1. 38) can be placed at the dawn of Middle Corinthian 21 A foreleg marking inherited from the Columbus Painter (see p. 74 below) is combined with ladder markings; the latter are common to both artists. 22 Reference to Corinth XV, iii, no. 796 (KP 2316), p. 156, will show that I approve Stillwell's comparison with X25 and that Benson disagrees with respect to both attribution and relative date. 23 Callipolitis-Feytmans 1962, p. 135; Corinth XV, iii, no. 750, p. 147 and note 1. C. Neeft (unpublished note on photograph) referred X13 to K1-K3 (I am inclined to think that this may be right; see p. 77 below; X13 is closest, however, to X1 and X14, next closest to Xli and X12).</page><page sequence="12">THE CHIMAERA GROUP AT CORINTH 65 because the flowers have so few and such fat petals.24 Only the bud on X7 might be compared developmentally. Exhaustive argument for attribution to the Chimaera Painter, based on the Berkeley plate, has been published.25 These floral plates stand in the same relation to the floral crosses on X25 and X29 as his felines on plates to those on his aryballoi, structurally alike but more elaborate and more artfully designed. The ring patterns on the bottom of the plate, in each case, are such as recur on plates by the Chimaera Painter. On the other hand, we now have a certified lotus ornament on L8 by the Painter of Louvre E 574, which makes attribution of these five plates to the latter artist most unlikely. The Chimaera Painter's Relationship to Attic Work at the End of the 7th and the Beginning of the 6th Century At a date corresponding to the beginning of Middle Corinthian style, Corinthian plate-makers adopted a double half-round foot molding from Attica, and a type of plate with a profile obviously modeled on Corinthian plates appeared in Athens.26 It is no overstatement that "les changes artistiques ont ete assez intenses entre Athenes et Corinthe depuis ce moment ... ,"27 but, apart from the double foot molding, Callipolitis- Feytmans suggests that the Athenians were the borrowers, both of the tondo occupied by a single figure28 and of the tondo with a floral cross.29 Determining that a single Attic or Corinthian surviving example is earlier than its comparandum, when they obviously are close in date, is usually impossible, but if we take all the evidence together we shall conclude, I think, that the Chimaera Painter learned a great deal from Attic artists who were at their prime at the beginning of his career. In fact, his familiarity with Attic ideas of decoration, not with single motifs alone, is such as to suggest a professional trip to the Athenian potters' quarter.30 He has not just seen random exports but chosen what he could use. First, his use of the tondo. There were Early Corinthian plates with tondo deco- ration,31 but they were few and different; they had no rampant lions with great heads 24 See p. 83 below. 25 Lawrence 1959, pp. 352-353. I should add, however, that certain arguments are inherently specious; "symmetry" implies something in the artist's personality when sphinxes are placed in strict symmetry (Lii) but not when an intrinsically symmetrical design is in question, such as a floral cross (Callipolitis-Feytmans 1962, p. 135), nor do I see any "mannerism", however defined, in the Berkeley and Catania plates, XI1 and X12 (Callipolitis-Feytmans 1962, bc. cit.). 26 Callipolitis-Feytmans 1962, p. 125; Callipolitis-Feytmans 1974, A I, 4-6, pp. 33-35 and p. 410, fig. 10. 27 Callipolitis-Feytmans 1962, bc. cit. 28 Callipolitis-Feytmans 1974, A I, 3, p. 33, pl. 3. 29 Ibid.,AI,6,p.34,fig. 1. 30 Caution is required; I am not suggesting that he was trained, even partly, in Athens. He draws like a Corinthian, just as the Panther Painter draws like an Athenian. Simply, the distance to Athens is not impossible; the Chimaera Painter seems a remarkably independent vase painter; his work is full of well digested, distinctively Attic ideas. Similarly, as H. A. G. Brijder (1983, pp. 44-56) emphasizes, early Attic black-figured cups are thoroughly in the Attic tradition of potting and decoration. It is the fundamental idea of using a drinking cup as a field for figural decoration (and an assortment of details inessential to the distinctive character of the cups) that is Corinthian in origin and testifies to the artists' interest in each others' work. 31 Callipolitis-Feytmans 1962, p. 124; CA 9, p. 149.</page><page sequence="13">66 PATRICIA LAWRENCE regardant. Corinthian lions walk demurely; even when devouring a bull,32 they keep their forelegs together. No previous Corinthian tondo pictures had single animals dynamically disposed in the circle. The Panther Painter's famous lekanis33 may be no earlier than X4, but the dynamic, rampant, regardant animal is quintessentially Attic. If we doubt the lions, we may trust the horses.34 The publication of the Vari lekanides gives us three examples of confronted horse protomai in tondos,35 at just the date relevant to X2 and X3. It is the way that the feline and equine motifs are displayed in tondos that counts, not that the Attic examples are in bowls instead of on plates. Second, there is the bowl itself, which the Chimaera Painter also uses for its tondo (X18, X20, X35, X36; cf. K4, K5, G4). As Amyx has pointed out, NC 716 and NC 717 may be the earliest Corinthian examples.36 These need not be earlier than X1-X4, but they probably antedate X18. The Nessos Painter's Vari bowls,37 indeed, are probably earlier than any of the foregoing, and three of them have spurred handles, round in section, like the Corinthian bowls.38 It seems more than likely that the bowl came to Corinth with its tondo decoration. The evidence of the Chimaera Painter's interest in Attic felines is subtler but, taken together, quite convincing. It answers the radical question, why the Chimaera Group is different from the rest of Corinthian. The animals, in the first place, are simply bigger than any since Protocorinthian, such as the Hound Painter's or those on black-polychrome plaques.39 Then, the seated pose with, in combination, the raised foreleg, regardant head (making a long arc down the back of the neck responding to the circle), and the tail in the space between the lion's back and its face (X4, X7), is Attic.40 The mane down the back of the neck, in flame locks but not covering the entire neck (see especially X20), is probably Attic, too, although if it occurred on a lion in a traditional Corinthian pose one might argue an independent genesis. The separately incised molars (X4, X5, X7, X9; Pls. 38, 39) are significant but disputable. Rafn4l thought that the Panther Painter's lion 32 ]Nfecrocorinthia, pl. 22:4. 33 Paralipomena, p. 1 1, no. 3; Papaspyridi-Karouzou 1963, no. 16355, pl. 61. 34 Lawrence 1959, p. 353, note 18, where I failed to pursue the fact that, "curiously enough," the oldest example of confronted horse protomai, Athens, Agora P 22551, has exactly the same scheme as X2.

My conclusions differ from Rafn's, partly because I grant the radical difference of the Attic work and the more than 90% purity of the Corinthian but am all the more interested in the traits that they do share, and partly because I am unwilling to place so much emphasis on possible wall</page><page sequence="14">THE CHIMAERA GROUP AT CORINTH 67 was Corinthianizing because it lacks incised molars. If so, the Chimaera Painter's early felines, just cited, would be Atticizing, because they have them. In fact, it is Early Archaic (i.e., 7th-century) lions that, if they are large enough to warrant such detail, and sometimes even if they are small, have mouths full of separately incised teeth, in both Corinth and Athens. Artists of the first third of the 6th century, in both schools, usually omit them. The sphinx on X16 also may be considered in this light. Fragmentary as she is, she was obviously a very heavy, large sphinx by Corinthian standards. One wants to compare the typically Attic sphinxes on Vari Krater B42 or, in a tondo, one by the Panther Painter,43 tamer and probably her contemporary. Again, it is not a question of the Chimaera Painter's copying Attic work or disregarding his own tradition but of his admiring Attic grandeur and panache and forming eclectic ideas about what we should call principles of decorative design. Another element in the Chimaera Painter's work, and one that he seems to have transmitted to his Group, is becoming increasingly apparent, but I would stress that it is a matter of repertory, not of style: an interest in old-fashioned patterns. It is not only that incised molars are a little archaic even at the beginning of the 6th century. The rectangular fall of hair terminated by a double line (X16, X30) harks back to the 7th century. The confronted horse protomai (Ul, X2, X3, L14) with raised forelegs and a rosette between them are, by the date of L14, of virtually antiquarian interest. The unattributed plate from Selinous, S1, surely to be referred to the Chimaera Group in spite of being unique, has protomai radiating from a medallion; the only prototype known to me for this kind of plate decoration is Middle Protoattic.44 Then there is the eagle on L15 (those by the Riehen Painter on R3 and R5 are quite different). In its preliminary publication,45 its surprising character is evident; it is a fully feathered, predatory eagle with a snake, surrounded by dense double-centered rosettes. Its iconographic prototypes date from the end of the 7th century.46 The eagle on L15 must be later than the KX Painter's eagle-and-snake lekanis,47 but it preserves the old Attic motif in full detail and with considerable vigor, without the attenuation and simplification of the KX Painter's version, which, in a bowl 38 centimeters in diameter, is not smaller than that on the bottom of a plate less than 25 centimeters with its rim. paintings and on early-7th-century seals at Perachora that might have been seen, but I owe a great deal both to her discussion and to Callipolitis' monumental work on plates. 42 Papaspyridi-Karouzou 1963, pls.

It is more remarkable, as such, because it does not appear in his earliest work. As Stillwell and Benson point out, something like it may be seen at the beginning of Early Corinthian,48 where the pouches are larger, like those around the panther's eyes on X21 (PI. 44). Much closer to those on, e.g., X28, the Vienna chimaera, are the forms around the eyes of the Kerameikos and Aigina chimaeras and the lions of the third Vari krater.49 Whether the models for the Chimaera Painter's amoeboid cells were Attic or Corinthian, they seem to be further evidence of his fondness for the best work of the preceding generation. I should not call this archaistic mannerism, because his style is not such as are called mannered. A Corinthian artist keenly observant of work outside his own time and place, but motivated by his own taste, is the rarest of phenomena. We may now consider this period of intense exchange of ideas from the Attic side. Sometimes it is impossible to say in which fabric something was done first. A bowl by the Panther Painter has a preening swan as its tondo motif50 An Attic plate from Van, close in date, has one rather like it.51 The Corinthian plate L5 has a preening swan as its tondo motif on the bottom. The profiles of the Attic and Corinthian swan plates are unknown; in each only the floor remains. Although the Corinthian swan plate should be the latest of the swan tondos, it is imprudent to argue from the relative dates of surviving examples; X24, which is earlier than L5, may have had such a swan on the bottom (cf. also U7; PI. 56). Corinth has priority in designing tondo plates, but Attic artists may have transferred such a motif from their own bowls if they were inspired by Corinthian feline plates to make plates similarly designed. L5 may owe its swan tondo either to swans by the Columbus Painter52 and the Chimaera Painter (X10), to an earlier Corinthian plate such as X24 may have been, or to the example of Attic plates like the one from Vari-or to general awareness of all of these. Similarly, a floral plate, Athens, Kerameikos inv. no. 1602,53 has a profile inspired by Corinthian practice, and the use of a floral cross in a plate tondo recalls Xli and X12 (the Attic bowls do not have floral tondos), but the design and separate flowers are purely, blatantly Attic. In neither fabric do we see slavish imitation, but the evidence seems ample to establish avid professional interest and 48 Corinth XV, iii, no. 454, p. 98, pl. 23. 49 ABV, p. 3, nos. 1, 3; p. 4, third item; Paralipomena, pp. 1-5, nos. 1, 9, 13; Kubler 1950, pp. 74-75, figs. 72, 74, and (for Kerameikos, inv. no. 154) Kerameikos VI, ii, cat. no. 187, pl. 113; colored drawings in Ohly 1961, pp. 1-11, Beil. 1-5, pls.

What is happening is nothing like the red-ground movement in Late Corinthian. The Corinthianizing that distinguishes the Panther Painter's animal friezes should be seen in the same light.54 Common sense suggests, since the bowls were native to and more frequent in Attic, and the tondo plate was native to and much more popular in Corinthian, that each fabric, while bowls and plates of these kinds still prevailed, drew upon the strengths of the other. The intense exchange of ideas, however, did not involve all styles alike. The extent of the Chimaera Painter's interest in Attic work is unparalleled in other Middle Corinthian groups. Sophilos liked not Corinthian lions generally but those of the Chimaera Painter;55 the Attic Komast Group was certainly interested in the products of the Corinthian Gorgoneion and Samos Groups,56 while the Samos Painter adorned his lions with both the Chimaera Painter's ruff and an Attic mane. In sum, these were the Middle Corinthian styles that were admired outside their own potters' quarter. THE PAINTER OF LouvRE E 574 (List L; Pls. 50-52) Fragments of a new (1974) alabastron by the Painter of Louvre E 574 in Syracuse, L8, were noted and attributed by Amyx. The fragments show that the entire alabastron was at least as large as the namepiece, L1. The feline (no head or mane is preserved, but the fringed forelegs indicate a lion) is exaggeratedly long-legged; the centerpiece was an elaborate lotus ornament. The attribution is incontestable, the Munich aryballos, L9, being closest in style. The Syracuse alabastron shows that the artist had not abandoned this vase shape at an advanced stage in his career, and it provides the "certified" floral design by this painter that, with concentric incisions in the base of the lotus, characteristically sharp, close-packed zigzags in the decorative bands, and added red used in all the broad areas, precludes attribution to this hand of any of the floral plates here assigned to the Chimaera Painter, the Painter of the Kameiros Plates, or the Painter of Gela G. 9. Close inspection of the vase, especially of the sphinx at right (the least damaged figure), convinced me that the flat-bottomed aryballos Louvre E 575, L2 (PI. 50), which Amyx says "could well be by the Painter" of Louvre E 574, in fact is his. It never was an elaborate piece; it is smaller than L7 or L4. The sphinx is perfunctory by his standards, but the profile of the face (with a puffy upper lip and receding chin), the eye, nostril, and ear, the foreleg and haunch markings all agree with corresponding features on L1, L4 (P1. 52), and L7. Alexandrescu's attribution to this hand of L2 bis strengthens the stylistic continuity from L2 to L4. The flat-bottomed aryballos in Palermo, Mormino 319, L4, also is slightly less self- consciously elegant than L7 but large and elaborate. The lions have every requisite trait: heads as on Li and L7, with teardrop pouches below the eyes and long, hooked tongues; forelegs with ladder markings of this artist's special type; shoulders of developed shape, as on L7; white dots added between the double lines on the shoulder and belly band. 54 These are fully illustrated in Papaspyridi-Karouzou 1963, pls. 55, 57-59, 62, 72, and, in comparison with some animals of the Nessos Painter, pp. 50-59, figs. 41-50. 55 G. Bakir 1981, p. 54. 56 Lawrence 1984, p. 63. These remarks should not be taken as contradictory to the central theses of Brijder's 1983 study.</page><page sequence="17">70 PATRICIA LAWRENCE They are, however, sturdier than his other lions and have less extremely tapered tails than the Painter of Louvre E 574 usually made. As another incontestable attribution (made independently by both Amyx and Benson and confirmed by my own inspection with X29 beside it), L4 is extremely important. Between the lions (and crowding them so that their hindquarters meet at the back) is a sickle-winged Typhon, regrettably damaged; much of the glaze-paint is gone, and the surface is both pitted and encrusted, but the figure is still legible. This Typhon, which guarantees another, more problematic attribution, must be described. Traces of the beard show that the head faced left. The bands across the shoulders and sleeves are decorated with sharp zigzags. The curved feathers in the sickle wings are individually incised with beautifully rounded tips. The arms are folded across the body, but the hands are not clenched; traces show them flat, one above the other. The forearms are long, and only the elbow is marked with incision. The bodice, not divided vertically, is covered with a finely executed scale pattern. The waistband is narrow and rectangular. The snake coils below the waistband are bordered on both sides by narrow margins of widely spaced scales, as on L5 and L6 (see below). The coils terminate by recoiling inwards, instead of S-curving outwards under the wings. These traits in combination are important in attributing L5 and L6. In both Typhon and lions, and generally in the Painter of Louvre E 574, the incisions are fine, sure, and exact, controlled to just reach the contour or another line, without intersecting. A fragment of a plate from the Potters' Quarter at Corinth, KP 2904, L6 (P1. 51, interior), preserves exactly such coils as we saw on L4. Those on the Chimaera Painter's X24 should be contrasted. Especially characteristic of the Painter of Louvre E 574's Typhon coils are the short, curved, widely spaced scale markings in the narrow margins of the coils, which are not at right angles to the parallel lines that enclose them. Anticipating another argument, note that L6 and L4 confirm by way of Typhon coils what L2, L7, and L10 do with female profiles, that the painter of the alabastra and aryballoi is in fact the painter of the plates. The evidence of L9 alone was not enough, however striking; the evidence of L17 is that of a late, weak piece; now we have the manifold and diverse evidence that the identification requires. The fragmentary plate Perachora II, no. 1960, L5, despite many traits derived from the Chimaera Painter, never seemed to be in his style, although some of his early work is as painstaking and tightly drawn. The interlocked hands (Typhon's own or Zeus's; cf. the Argos plate, L15, p. 71 below) are reduced to a complicated pattern, whose character, with thumbnails added, seemed radically unlike the Chimaera Painter. Above all, when one studied, side by side in their showcase, this plate and the Chimaera Painter's X31, they were decisively different in the quality of the incised line. The Typhons on L4 and L6 prove that L5 is by the Painter of Louvre E 574. The drawing of the scale pattern, the long, slender wrists, the slim waist and straight waistband, and the design of the snake coils, as described above for L4 and L6, all match, confirming the impression given by the fine, precise incision. L5, like L6, is a small plate (the fabric is delicate, and the tracing of L6 on Plate 51 is 1: 1), and so the two Typhons on the plates are drawn at about the same scale as that on the aryballos, L4. Here, then, is another plate attributable to the hand of the alabastra and aryballoi by the Painter of Louvre E 574 independently of the Copenhagen plates, L11 and L12!.</page><page sequence="18">THE CHIMAERA GROUP AT CORINTH 71 But the Typhon on L5 has a beard of the Chimaera Painter's type (cf. X34) and a meandering line, not sharp zigzags, in the band across the shoulders; as on the Chimaera Painter's X29, the artists' companionship is apparent, and still more strongly in the tondo on the bottom of L5. Here the subject is indisputably a swan (as Callipolitis-Feytmans, who could examine it, as I did, said), a preening swan of the same type as those on the Chimaera Painter's X10, with raised wings and a fluffy breast. Just enough is preserved to prove that the neck curved round to bring the beak against the fluffy part of the neck. Half of a double-centered rosette is also preserved. We shall see that on plates in the tradition established by those of the Chimaera Painter, the Painter of Louvre E 574, who never used filling ornaments on his alabastra and aryballoi, adopted the rosettes along with the rest of the repertory. There is no reason to question the attribution of the Typhon because the swan so closely echoes those on X10 (in any case, with the head and tail and most of the wings lacking, connoisseurship is difficult) or to suggest that the companions shared the decoration of a single plate. Preening swans evidently were in the workshop repertory, like confronted horse protomai (see pp. 72, 97-98 below).57 The attribution of L5 does not rest solely on the other two Typhons, although they secure it. Another small, exquisite plate, L15, decorated on both sides and in the Chimaera Painter's tradition (with filling ornament in the field and with a beard of his type) was found in the excavations of the Greek Archaeological Service at Argos, reported in 1977.58 It is later than the foregoing, and, by linking L4, L5, and L6 with the Copenhagen plates, Lii and L12, its appearance supplied the last evidence needed to abolish the "Painter of the Copenhagen Sphinxes". The Argos plate, L15, shows Herakles wrestling with a Triton-at any rate, a hero wrestling with a fish-man, who has a full head of hair; I shall use the conventional names.59 It is certainly the most ambitious composition on any plate in the Chimaera Group.60 In the tondo on the bottom, a true eagle flies to right, holding a full-length snake in its beak. There are several rosettes in the field on the face of the plate and many on the bottom. The face ofthe rim is covered with black and red concentric bands. The Herakles and Triton are certainly by the same hand as the sphinxes on L1 1 and the komast on L12. Facial profiles, mustaches, eyes, ears, headbands, the outline of the beard around the cheek; the yoke across the shoulders and the elbow, knee, thigh-muscle, and ankle incisions on Herakles, Triton, and komast; the tightly drawn, elongated scales on Triton and sphinxes (cf. also the Typhons on L4 and L5)-all testify to the authorship of the Argos plate. Though Triton's beard is of the type invented by the Chimaera Painter, it juts forth in an improbable shelf 5 Swans could have come from the Columbus Painter's motif repertory; compare especially London, B.M. A 1399, CorVP, p. 85, A 1. Since this is a single swan on a plate, the Attic parallels (p. 68 and notes 50 and 51 above) must also be considered. Note that the artist's alabastra and aryballoi bear nothing alien to the tradition that he inherited for work on those shapes; the plates do, and this is one reason why, with only a few pieces, it was impossible to demonstrate adequately ("they must be" can never be an argument) that all were his. 58 See note 45, p. 67 above. 59 On the iconography of fish-men and for a summary of previous literature, see most recently R. Glynn, "Herakles, Nereus, and Triton: A Study of Iconography in Sixth-Century Athens," AJA 85, 1981, pp. 12 1- 132, pls. 21-23. 60 On plates like Payne's NC 1056, which I propose to exclude from the Group, see p. 112 below.</page><page sequence="19">72 PATRICIA LAWRENCE as on the Copenhagen sphinxes, L1i. The komastlike head on the bottom of Perachora II, no. 1970, L13, also is comparable with Triton's. On both Herakles and the komast, L12, the long, slender arms have no internal markings except for the elbows. Any temptation, prompted by Triton's beard, to extend the Chimaera Painter's career into Late Corinthian via this new plate, very different in composition from L11 and L12, must be forestalled. The Argos plate cannot be by the Chimaera Painter. The leg, knee, and elbow markings (cf XiO, X31-X34) are wrong, and the arms are too long and slender (even on his late pyxis, X39 [P1. 47:d], the arms of a Boread by the Chimaera Painter are stockier and the musculature full and characteristically marked). The heads of Herakles and Triton do not resemble those of the Louvre siren, X30, or the Boreads on X17, X26, X34, and X39, although the Boread on X34, like the Triton, has an open mouth.61 We may now assign to the Painter of Louvre E 574, also, the famous horse-protomai plate Munich 6449, L14. The attribution, which was suggested long ago, can be argued today a little more concretely. For the long lines parallel to the contour, defining bone on the horses' noses and muscle in their necks, compare the similar long line defining muscle in Herakles' thigh, L15. The horses' eyes are exactly like the eyes of Herakles, L15, and the sphinxes, L11, and the long locks in the mane are drawn with exactly the same wavy lines (the line having just the same tension) as the sphinxes' beards. The elbows of the horses are marked by the same configuration as the ankle of one of the sphinxes. The largest rosette on the face of the Argos plate is particularly like the rosette between the horse protomai. Note that this rosette, unlike those on the earlier U1 and X2, is placed exactly at the compass center of the plate. The attribution to the Painter of Louvre E 574 of one of the votive plaques from Penteskouphia, L16, is borne out by the evidence of L15. Although some of the Poseidon plaques are much later than the time of the Frangois Vase, this one certainly is not.62 The head of Poseidon compares most precisely with that of Herakles on L15, although the attribution (made initially on acquaintance with the Corinth fragment alone) was originally based on the faces of the Copenhagen sphinxes, Lli, which have a specialized, bony and elongated nose and more strongly protruding lips than Poseidon or Herakles. One fine, fairly large plate, L13, is problematic because, to the best of my knowledge, no one has been able to study it except from the pictures (Perachora II, no. 1970, pls. 80, 82) since before World War II. The attribution to the Painter of Louvre E 574 (i.e., to the hand of Ll 1) seems safe. The evolved, elaborate design and the tightly controlled incision in the floral decoration on the face of the plate (a four-lotus cross, the sepals extended to frame 61 This open mouth with protruding lips, like beetling brows, snub noses, and horrid hair in later Greek art, betokens a bestial component in the character represented. The locus classicus is the face of Nettos, contrasted with the tight-mouthed Herakles (as also on L15) on the Athens amphora, ABV, p. 4, no. 1, Paralipomena, p. 2, no. 6, with references to new illustrations, but the feature is common through the first half of the 6th century. 62 Geagan (1970, no. 6, p. 36, fig. 6; p. 37 and note 19) dates L16 to the "late sixth century". Any draped deity in profile, as early as the Antimenes Painter, as Exekias, even as early as Lydos, in comparison with this head and shoulders, will suffice to place it in the generation, instead, of Kleitias (or, very exactly, with the Herakles on L15). "Late sixth century" is the red-figure Pioneers and the Leagros Group, to whom this work would look as quaint as the Polyphemos amphora from Eleusis would look to Kleitias. The Poseidon even has "Volomandra locks": hair brushed back as, evidently, on that kouros.</page><page sequence="20">THE CHIMAERA GROUP AT CORINTH 73 double palmettes on small volutes) seem to ally this plate more closely than any other with L1i and L12. The equally fragmentary design on the bottom, only partly published, is tantalizing: man walking to left, with dog. The published tracing of the head is that of a komast (note also the short-sleeved garment); the picture should not resemble the approximately contemporary plaque signed by Timonidas,63 where the man is a serious hunter. What does it look like? Do the anatomical markings agree with those of the Argos Herakles, L15, and the komast on L12 (whose facial profile is fuller than appears in pictures, owing to the loss of glaze-paint)? Is the dog drawn compatibly (shoulder, forelegs, haunch) with the Munich horses, L14, and the felines by this hand? The tracing of the head has a tentative quality and interrupted lines, suggesting loss of paint and surface damage as well as fragmentary preservation. On the strength of the shape of the skull, the round eye, the nostril and mustache (but not their rounded shape), and the line of the shoulder, the komast is attributed to the same hand as that on L12 and (for the open mouth) the Triton on L15. Compare also the fleshy upper lip of the siren on L7. Pending autopsy, I have based no stylistic argument on this plate. A flat-bottomed aryballos, Gela G. 10, L17, remarkably broad bottomed, later than any other aryballos by a hand in the Chimaera Group, bears a Typhon whose face actually resembles the soft-contoured tracing of the man on L13. Rafn64 must be right to base the attribution to the Painter of Louvre E 574 primarily on the Copenhagen komast, L12 (her comparisons seem quite sufficient), because the Typhon on Mormino 319, L4, flanked by lions that guarantee its attribution to the same hand as L1, L2, and L7-L9, is of an entirely different type, based on a different model, without a single incised detail in common with the Gela Typhon, Li7. Indeed, if Lli and Li2 were not now proven to be by the Painter of Louvre E 574, the attribution of L17 to the same artist as L4 would be incredible: one Typhon faces left, the other right, one has sickle wings, the other outspread wings; one has a scale-pattern bodice with a zigzag band across the shoulders, the other a plain bodice, divided vertically, with a maeander band (matched only on the komast Li2); above all, one has snake coils decorated in the tradition of the Chimaera Group pX24, L5, L6) and coiled up below the body, the other plain coils spread out to left and right in S-curves below the wings. In fact, the Late Corinthian aryballos, L17, its potting also alien to that of the other flat-bottomed aryballoi, postdates the dissolution of the Chimaera Group as a working entity and shows its longest-lived member, in his dotage, using a Typhon type from some other source. Even the drawing suggests, if not an unsteady hand, deteriorating eyesight. A plate fragment, L3, Corinth C-72-244, presents a different kind of problem. As Pemberton's description shows, it is, so far as preserved, a typical Chimaera Group fragment, and the face of the winged panther protome has the proportions and all the markings of those on Lli, Li2, and L9. The fragment is so worn that the "shadow" of the glaze-paint contour is lost; only incised lines remain (P1. 51). Judging from the incised details, the face is less evolved, less specialized, probably earlier than its comparanda; also, the simple pattern of narrow rings on the bottom recurs on plates of no very advanced type by the Chimaera Painter. The incisions are heavier than they ought to be, and the 63 CorVP, p. 201, no. 2, pl. 84:2 a, b; AntDenk I, pl. 8, fig. 13. 64 1978, p. 159.</page><page sequence="21">74 PATRICIA LAWRENCE amoeboid forms around the eyes are drawn with ill-controlled, discontinuous lines, but their shape, like that of the wrinkles on the nose, is exactly correct for the Painter of Louvre E 574. With such a panther's face, the fragment should not be so early as the exquisitely drawn lions on Li, but throughout his career, this artist's forte was his fine, resilient, precise incised line, worthy of comparison with any Protocorinthian artist. If L3 is not an unaccountably awkward, minor work from his own hand (it would be, perhaps, the earliest of his plates to survive), it must be a strict copy of his work; I think that it is his (see note 218, p. 109 below). The Columbus Painter and the Painter of Louvre E 574 Amyx does not call the Columbus Painter the teacher of the Painter of Louvre E 574.65 I see, however, the same complete continuity between these two artists as between the Painter of Palermo 489 and the Columbus Painter.66 The Painter of Louvre E 574 has certain persistent habits that are inexplicable if they were not deeply ingrained during actual apprenticeship with the Columbus Painter: the way that the lion's eye with the double pouch below it fits the face; the very long lower jaw with a large eyetooth and long tongue; the recurving outline of the ruff; the shape of the shoulder (interestingly, derived from rather early lions by the Columbus Painter) with a double line dividing it; his use of white dots (alien to the rest of the Chimaera Group and not used on their plates even by the Painter of Louvre E 574); finally, the long line with an arc at the top, on the front of a feline's near foreleg, the most significant habit of all, formalized eventually as part of the unique configuration on the sphinxes and pantheresses of L1i and L12.67 Furthermore, the little siren on Li is still placed between the lions in the same way as the bird on the Columbus Painter's (rather early) Syracuse alabastron.68 The basic differences between the styles of the Chimaera Painter and the Painter of Louvre E 574 (barring innate qualities) can be stated succinctly. The Painter of Louvre E 574 adheres very faithfully to his heritage from the Columbus Painter.69 For the Chimaera Painter, the Columbus Painter's feline types were only a point of departure. The Painter of Louvre E 574, on his alabastra and aryballoi, gives no hint of interest in the motifs or decorative principles of Attic work; they are very purely Corinthian. The late plates, L14 and L15, with horse protomai and eagle with snake, are thus all the more remarkable (see p. 67 above), as if taking over the decoration of plates entailed its special repertory. Lii and L12 were influenced by something other than vase paintings, but 65 CorVP, p. 85, "Fine work, ... leading to the MC Painter of Louvre E 574"; ibid., p. 171, the Painter of Louvre E 574's "type of lion is derived from that of the EC Columbus Painter." Earlier (196 la, p. 14) Amyx had said, "The sequel to his style is found ... in the work of the Painter of Louvre E 574, as for example in the large alabastron which is the name-piece of that artist." 66 Amyx (CorVP, p. 85) calls the Painter of Palermo 489 "the Columbus Painter's great teacher" and calls attention to the alabastron in the Ludwig Collection, no. L-12, now in Basel, which, though by the great teacher, was easily mistaken for an early work of the Columbus Painter. 67 For the Columbus Painter's lions, see Amyx 1961 a, Beil. 6 and 7, and Ddlos X, no. 461, pls. 32, 66. 68 Syracuse, N.M. 34993; CorVP, p. 85, A 6. 69 For continuity over a comparable span of time (the Painter of Palermo 489 began in Transitional, the Painter of Louvre E 574 worked into LC), see Neeft's study (1984, pp. 133-170) of workshop continuity from the Dolphin Painter to the Herzegovina Painter.</page><page sequence="22">THE CHIMAERA GROUP AT CORINTH 75 whatever it was seems to have been Corinthian-at any rate, not Attic. The Painter of Louvre E 574 and the Chimaera Painter, certainly close companions, prove to be more independent as artists than Archaic Corinthian vase painters might be expected to be, more self-conscious as artists, that is, than most of their colleagues were. THE RIEHEN PAINTER (List R) For the Riehen Painter, there is only one new attribution, but his style, such as it is, needs to be characterized more carefully than it has been. There are two extreme tendencies in dealing with Corinthian vase painters: either to take some animal-frieze or aryballos hand and talk about his style and personality as if he were Matisse or Raphael or to treat all of them as if they were so many work units painting flowers on china in a factory. In reality, as in Attic red figure or in any later highly developed artisan tradition, a few were talented artists, whose style can be discerned in their vision and design as well as in their "handwriting"; I should claim as much for the Chimaera Painter and the Painter of Louvre E 574. Some hands were really just work units; they painted barely attributable kotylai and round aryballoi, silhouette-technique pottery, and the like. They must be sorted by handwriting analysis and, if we possess their products in quantity, by quasi-mechanical repetitions in their work.70 They do not bother with design or have any personal way of seeing things. Most vase painters fall between these extremes and should be considered accordingly. The Riehen Painter typifies good mediocrity. He draws competently and is not content merely to copy or to repeat ad nauseam (as, for example, the Patras Painter7l did). He seems to have taken interest in his work, which also reveals a certain vigor. But his "originality", though the way he draws is fairly easy to recognize, consists in novel combinations of what he learned from others; these are often striking. Amyx calls him "a close follower of the Painter of Louvre E 574"; R2 imitates that artist's work, but R1 imitates the early Chimaera Painter. The sphinxes on R3 and R4, although the Riehen Painter draws better than the Otterlo Painter, look as if he had been admiring also some work of that kind. R6 draws on late lions by the Chimaera Painter with elements from the Painter of Louvre E 574, but its horse and rider are unparalleled in the Chimaera Group. So are the flying eagles on R3; the eagle on L15 is in no way similar. His style is always bold, broad, and straightforward. Evidently, he never wanted to refine his design by calculating the placement of the double line dividing the feline shoulder as the Painter of Louvre E 574 did (L4, L7-L9). Did he notice the difference? On his aryballoi, he vacillates between figures in a void field (R1-R3) and the use of a few rosettes (R4, R6). The new attribution is that of R5, a plate in Heidelberg not yet fully published. Although L15 is almost certainly later than R5, the growing evidence for a shared repertory of tondo motifs in the Chimaera Group suggests that there may have been other, earlier flying-eagle plates by the two major artists. If so, the broad style and the direct, somewhat naive treatment of the eagle carrying dolphins must be the Riehen Painter's own, for the eagle on L15 is detailed and traditional, with late-7th-century prototypes. It is the eagle on L15, rather than those on R3 and R5, that belongs in the 70 Neeft (1984) has developed a useful methodology for dealing with unselfconscious hands. 71 CorVP, pp. 185-189; Corinth VII, ii, pp. 38-40.</page><page sequence="23">76 PATRICIA LAWRENCE same tradition as the KX Painter's.72 The eagles on R3 and R5 differ in type and posture, but the markings on the head and the rather unanatomical subdivisions of the wings and their feathers show that the hand is the same. Also, the broad and even distribution of incised lines, both on the birds and in the rosettes, is consistent with the rest of the Riehen Painter's work, and the somewhat antic, or naive, expression is precisely his. The Riehen Painter was a specialist in flat-bottomed aryballoi, associated with the Chimaera Group throughout his career. It is not surprising if occasionally he essayed a plate, just as the Chimaera Painter occasionally painted aryballoi. I had wondered if some of the floral plates might be his, but none of his aryballoi have floral centerpieces. Also, his line is too undisciplined for him to have been responsible for plates like K1-K3, and his own plate, R5, has different banding on the underside from any other plate in the Group. R5 also, and uniquely, is badly warped; we shall have to consider whether vase painters usually made the plates that they decorated. THE PAINTER OF GELA G. 9 (List G; PI. 53) Gela G. 9, G2, is an aryballos with panthers flanking a floral centerpiece, obviously modeled on one like the Chimaera Painter's X25. Now, just as the floral cross on X25 is similar in design to those on X11 and X12, that on G2 has the same design, based on four rings, as on G1 (Fig. 5, p. 125 below); and G3 (Fig. 6, p. 125 below), rather obviously by the same hand as G1, differs in having lotuses in place of two of the palmettes. G4 (PI. 53) preserves only a lotus flower, but that is perfectly consistent with the lotus on G3. Independent of any attribution, Gela G. 9, G2, is one of the globular-bodied flat- bottomed aryballoi with a maximum diameter falling rather low on the body, with neat tongues on the shoulder, with little or no filling ornament, that were favored by (though not confined to) the Chimaera Group. Its composition, with a floral cross instead of a winged creature between the felines, and its seated panther, with a raised forepaw, show that the Chimaera Painter rather than the Painter of Louvre E 574 inspired it. Corinth KP 2909, G4, is a lekanoid bowl rather than a plate. Here indeed is a hand singularly dependent on the Chimaera Painter, the only other one known so far to have worked on just that repertory of shapes: aryballoi, plates, and small lekanoid bowls. The drawing is competent but not very intelligent. The Painter of Gela G. 9 lacks the Riehen Painter's antic vigor. Between him and the Chimaera Painter is the chasm that separates neat, legible penmanship from a classic of calligraphy. His incisions make perfectly good Corinthian panthers but lack any awareness of design-that is, of proportions, of refined configuration, of intelligent structure. These observations are as true of the four floral crosses, compared with those on X1 (Fig. 4, p. 117 below), Xli, and X12, or K1-K3, as of the panthers. Palmettes and panthers are drawn with slackly curved lines that make their petals and paws seem rubbery.73 72 Schefold (1960, p. 138, III: 92) compared the Riehen eagle (R3 is the namepiece) with the KX Painter's lekanis; Rafn (1978, p. 189) followed his suggestion and accepted his dates. But P.3 is not so early as ca. 600 B.C.; it may be no earlier than the KX Painter's lekanis (here, too, Schefold's date, ca. 590, seems a little high), and its plump eagles are of a different type from the KX Painter's. 73 Benson (Corinth XV, iii, no. 753, p. 148, note 2) suggests that G1 and G3 are probably by the Chimaera Painter. For the reasons just given, I disagree.</page><page sequence="24">THE CHIMAERA GROUP AT CORINTH 77 THE PAINTER OF THE KAMEIROS PLATEs (List K; PI. 53) Of the six pieces given to this hand, one, the bowl in Delphi, K5, is taken on faith. No one seems to have seen it since the publication of Necrocorinthia. And Payne's note74 is laconic, "frag. with palmette complex, as in nos 1049-51 of the Chimaera Group." Was the Delphi bowl really like the plates Kl-K3, which have a unique pattern, a remarkable design, less a palmette cross than a composition of knotted tendril loops with four large and four small palmettes placed where the tendrils separate? Since I could not see it, I disregarded the Delphi bowl until, following a note of A. N. Stillwell's,75 we located K4 (PI. 53), now inventoried as Corinth KP 2910. The existence of a second fragment of a bowl of typical Chimaera Group fabric preserving the unique design of the three plates enhances the likelihood that the Delphi bowl also has the knotted design. This design is so idiosyncratic and the drawing so perfectly alike on K1-K4, although two of the plates have different ring patterns on the bottom and rather different profiles,76 that it is safe to conclude that they are by one hand.77 Like K1, the Apollonia plate, K3 bis, is only more careless than K2 and K3. The differing ring patterns on K1 and K2 are both of types used by the Chimaera Painter rather than the Painter of Louvre E 574 (L3, L10, L14), or the Riehen Painter (R5), or the hand of two plates close to the Columbus Painter (S2, S3). Ring patterns hardly sustain an attribution, but these seem to exclude, at least, the hands that used different ones; even the plates by the Painter of Gela G. 9 are distinctive to the extent of having very simple rings on the bottom: narrow rings in pairs, as on some of the Chimaera Painter's early plates (X1, X2, X4, X6, X16 [Fig. 1, p. 100 below]; also X31, X32) and on L3. K2 has broad bands, equally spaced, alternately red and black (cf. X9, Xli, X22, X28, X30, X38 [Fig. 1]), which no other hand in the Group is known, so far, to have used. K1 has bands similar to those on X7 and X37. Kl-K3 also have, each, eight very tiny plus-incised rosettes disposed among the palmettes and tendrils near the edge of the tondo; these also indicate a very close relationship to the Chimaera Painter, since they do not occur on vases attributable to other hands in the Group78 but on his own mature work (X30, X34, X35). We may never be sure whether the Painter of the Kameiros Plates is the Chimaera Painter himself, for whom we have no other floral plates assignable to his maturity, because this floral pattern is self-sufficient as a design, too elaborate for use between felines on an aryballos. My eyes argue that the drawing is his, and the highly structured, original, effective design ought to be his; the ring patterns and tiny rosettes prove that the plates are very close to him, closer than the plates by the Painter of Gela G. 9, but unless a double-faced plate with an attributable motif in the second tondo or an aryballos with a modified version of the knotted design as a centerpiece comes to light, I cannot quite demonstrate that these plates and bowls belong to the Chimaera Painter at the stage of X30-X34. 74 fecrocorinthia, under NC 1012, p. 312. 75 Corinth XV, iii, p. 147 (at bottom of second column). 76 Callipolitis-Feytmans 1962, nos. 57 and 59, p. 153, fig. 17. 77 Can it really be that we have trouble with the connoisseurship of floral patterns simply because they have no facial expressions, as the animals seem to have? Yet we see style in architecture. The complexity and possible variety in design and rendering are certainly as great for floral crosses as for goats and panthers. 78 There is one tiny rosette on R5, but it is less studied than these, not artfully disposed.</page><page sequence="25">78 PATRICIA LAWRENCE PAINTERS OF LEKANOID BoWLs The Painter of Corinth CP-2438 (List P; P1. 53) Nearly forty years ago, Amyx recognized, among fragments of pottery from the early excavations at Corinth, CP-2438, Pi, as a lekanoid bowl belonging to the Chimaera Group and good enough to be by one of the major hands.79 But the style was different, though the fabric was typical, and no other work by this hand was identified until KP 2915, P2 (P1. 53), was noticed in the pottery from the North Dump in the Potters' Quarter. Here is work at the same scale, rather large for its tondo, since these are bowls of the same size as X18, X35, and X36. P2 has the same splashy rosettes as on P1, incised at the same angles to their shape. It has the same penchant for internal incisions running parallel to the contour of the paint (the panther's skull and ear; the griffin's knobs and ear), and just the same careful, not very rapid, incised line. The style is quite distinct from the Chimaera Painter's, still farther from the studied elegance of the Painter of Louvre E 574, as is natural, since the production of lekanoid bowls in the Chimaera Group was the Chimaera Painter's department. The Painter of Corinth KP 1670 (List Q; Pls. 54 and 55) Very large lekanoid bowls, approaching a diameter of forty centimeters, appear in Corinth fairly late in MC; KP 1670, Q1, may be the earliest known. Several of the others are by the Painter of Athens 93 1, at a date when he was no longer the Dodwell Painter's loyal subject.80 His work in large tondos is elaborate, colorful, and tasteless, but its only possible antecedents are represented by Q1 and Q2. His interest in, or even fleeting association with, the Chimaera Group is independently attested by a plate fragment in Palermo, SlO, from the Demeter Malophoros sanctuary at Selinous. Q1 also, as all agree, is very closely related to the Chimaera Painter. It is an extremely important piece. Owing to its existing in partly nonjoining fragments, and to its long-delayed publication, everything previously in print about it requires correction or modification. The profile drawing in Corinth XV, iii, pl. 116 and personal examination, first, leave no doubt that it is a large bowl, and no plate; Stillwell was right, of course.81 Second, its major fragments all belong to it; no part of it belongs to a plate, instead.82 One fragment, badly worn, is problematic but seems to belong. It is not by the Chimaera Painter (as earlier Lawrence, followed by Amyx);83 its exterior frieze does not, stylistically, closely resemble that on the pyxis Hermitage 5551, X26 (Benson),84 but rather confirms what personal examination of the fabric and the drawing also require, that it is no earlier 79 Corinth VII, ii, no. 148, p. 45. 80 The Dodwell Painter and the Chimaera Painter seem to have been exactly contemporary; their hold on their companions is undone at about the same point, somewhat before the change to LC style. On the Painter of Athens 931, see Amyx 1971, pp. 21-29, and CorVP, pp. 205-210.

Therefore, the latter need not even be considered. There is no reason to think, although the animal-frieze manner is very different from the tondo-motif manner, that the interior and exterior are by different hands; the Painter of Athens 931 and the Attic painters of lekanides85 all decorated their bowls both inside and out. The figure in the tondo does resemble the Chimaera Painter's Berlin Boread, X34,86 though the latter is work at a much smaller scale, but it may be, rather, a Potnia Theron, as on X10.87 The double outline over the buttocks suggests that it is a Potnia, and there is plenty of space in the vast tondo for the height of a standing figure, rather than the Boread's Knielauf, and for a couple of swans or other animals. The absence or presence of a beard, not preserved, would be decisive; Boreads, however, often look backwards and hold their hand across their body, as on X34, and this figure doesn't, and their buttocks, because they are running, should be more bunched up and rounded than these are. Boread or Potnia, it is not by the same hand as X34 and X10. The vertical, parallel, wiggly incisions in the hair show the influence of the taste of the Painter of Louvre E 574. The partly preserved ear is stylistically distinct from both major artists' ears. On XIO and X34, respectively, the axis of the body bends slightly at the waist to impart conviction to walking and running; on X10 the waistband curves to suggest corporeality; on both X10 and X34 the kolpos falls in front of the waistband. These are rare master touches in the early 6th century. In each case, Q1 by contrast is rigid and formulaic, without, we must add, the genuine elegance of the Painter of Louvre E 574's formality, where the Chimaera Painter's winged figures are flexible and vigorous. Even the feathers and rosettes are slightly too dry when compared with X10 and X34 or, for that matter, with Lii. The goats in the exterior animal frieze of Q1 have generic configuration; so have those on the Chimaera Painter's pyxides. But Q1 has no complete felines, and only one of the goats on X2688 is quite so ordinary as those on Q1. Even he has a sturdier and more distinctive head and a walking gait dependent for its effect on his well articulated forelegs. The slenderer legs and more delicate head of the goats on Q1 suggest, like the winged figure in the tondo, that it is later than X26, but comparison with the animals on X39, which must be as late as Q1, still more strongly discourages making any close association. On X39, though their proportions are those of later animals, the goats (P1. 46:b) have remarkably well knit limbs and bodies, beside which those on Q1 are loose, boneless, and ordinary. Finally, the filling ornament on Q1 is all wrong; instead of being unusually dense for its date, with a high proportion of double-centered rosettes, it is fairly sparse and includes dot-and-ring fillers, which are alien to the Chimaera Group. I have not found another animal frieze by this hand, but the artist of Q1 was probably a painter of pyxides or oinochoai who worked on lekanoid bowls, perhaps briefly, late in Middle Corinthian, as 85 For the Attic bowls, see notes 35 and 38, p. 66 above. 86 For the style of X34, see pp. 61-62 above; for the relative date of the profile of the plate, see p. 103 below. 87 Even the figure standing in the tondo of a 29-centimeter plate, however, does not approach the scale of one in a 40-centimeter bowl. 88 Lawrence 1959, pl. 90: fig. 20.</page><page sequence="27">80 PATRICIA LAWRENCE (a little later still) the Painter of Athens 931 did. In other words, Q1 and Q2 belong to the Chimaera Group, but their artist perhaps is an outsider. Q2 is a small, thick fragment from the floor of a very large bowl like Q1. Since it comes from a trench in the Terracotta Factory in the Potters' Quarter, instead of the Road Deposit, and is not quite identical to Q1 in color or thickness, it almost certainly belongs to another bowl. Very little is preserved of the figure work, and that is puzzling, but the border pattern is exactly the same as on Qi: the meandering line has extremely long loops with characteristic curves (PI. 55). These ought never to have been confused with those in the Chimaera Painter's border patterns, where the loops are consistently shorter and tighter. The work is at the same, very large, scale as in the tondo of Q1. Q2 is valuable, however small and abraded, as evidence that Q1 was not a unique effort. THE STYLE OF SOME PLATES FROM SELINOUS (List S) A group of uninventoried fragments in Palermo, from the Demeter Malophoros sanctuary at Selinous, presents subtle problems.89 Three of the plate fragments, S4, S5, and S6, preserve part of a human head (two preserve part of a raised wing as well) but none the eye or the profile of the face. Two have the hair of the head or beard rendered in separate, rippling locks, and all three have fine, precise incisions, although rosettes, where preserved, are perfunctorily incised. Two of the fragments have black-figure work on the reverse: one a palmette festoon and, nearer the center, a band of three-row dicing (as on the otherwise dissimilar V2-V4). Many traits on S4-S6 can be referred to the Painter of Louvre E 574, but the line, though fine, seems timid, and their fragmentary preservation makes connoisseurship difficult. Similarly, the feline hindquarters on S7 are exactly in the manner of the Painter of Louvre E 574, but the structure is different, and the fine, timid incised work recalls that on S4-S6. All the plentiful Chimaera Group material from the Malophoros sanctuary that I have seen is atypical and by neither principal artist but evidently proper to the Group. Si, published by Gabrici (Payne's NC 1052), has unique decorative syntax, but its lion protomai are closely related to the Columbus Painter, to the hand of S2 and S3 (if that is not the Columbus Painter himself),90 and to the Painter of Louvre E 574. Even the syntax is arguably characteristic of the Group (see p. 67 above). Either S2 or S10 could be the plate intended by Payne at NC 1043, not attributed to the Chimaera Painter but listed directly following his feline plates. I incline to S2, because it preserves the lion's head, but it is a protome, which Payne usually named as such, and the crosshatched mane on S10 proves that it, too, was a lion. It is, however, a plate with white dots and by the Painter of Athens 931.91 Perhaps Payne entered either of them in the catalogue on the basis of incomplete notes, but, in fact, both fragments are rather marginal to the Group, and it 89 These are being studied for publication by Dr. Christiane Dehl. I owe my knowledge of them to the Soprintendente, Dr. Vincenzo Tusa. New excavation in the Malophoros sanctuary is under the direction of Dr. Sebastiano Tusa. 90 See p. 1 15 below. I have listed S3 with S2 because it is by the same hand as the Selinous plate fragment and thus represents one of the styles found at that excavation site, but this listing does not imply any suspicion as to its provenience, which, unfortunately, is unknown. 91 CorVed p. 212, A 18.</page><page sequence="28">THE CHIMAERA GROUP AT CORINTH 81 is not impossible that Payne saw some plate fragment closer to NC 1040-1042 than either of these. That the finds from a single sanctuary are consistently so distinctive (relative to the rest of Sicily itself) must have implications for the commercial organization responsible for the distribution of the pottery.92 For Chimaera Group work from Cyrene that could have similar implications, see L13 bis. THE CARROUSEL PAINTER (List V) I The lists G, K, P, and Q represent hands closely related to the Chimaera Painter, some or all of whose work is in the tondos of lekanoid bowls of the same kind as his, although Qi and Q2 are much larger. But the last of these hands may have worked with the Chimaera Group only briefly. In the Carrousel Painter's case, we are not sure. Only his early work, V1-V4, betrays direct contact with their work, and it is found on very small plates that Callipolitis-Feytmans did not include in the Chimaera Group. Her profile drawings are to scale and show how much larger CM 52-81 are than CM 8-10,93 but she did not give diameters or discuss the importance of one group of plates' being half again the diameter of the other. Allowing that the small plates have more perfunctory moldings, V2-V4, her CM 8-10, have profiles not very different from those of X7, her CM 53, or Xli, her CM 67 (on the development of profiles, see pp. 99-103 below). This is not to insist that they were made in the same shop, but they might have been. V1 does not yet show the influence of the Chimaera Painter; on V2-V4 it is unmistakable. These are the four pieces that are assigned unanimously to the Carrousel Painter, as such an artist without a past or a future, since all could have been made in less than five years. I am afraid that he also decorated V5 and V6 and quite possibly V7. Amyx lists these as "related" and as "poorer imitations of the style."94 I should assert that the poor imitator is the same hand. Of these, Tocra I, no. 299, V5, is the smallest, earliest, and closest to V3 and V4. The animals are still perky, and the goats still have the gait of those on V4. Filling ornament reappears, MC filling ornament now, as on the Chimaera Painter's pyxides, X17 and X26. The dicing around the central medallion and the rays on the rim have disappeared. V6 stands in the same relation to V5 as the latter to V4, larger, with larger animals that have quite lost the stuffed-toy character of those on V1-V4. But among its animals is a bird between the heads of a panther and a goat in the same position as on V4 (obverse)-and the bird is the same shape as that on the much earlier V2 (reverse)! V7 is a full-size plate (Diam. 0.292 m.); apart from its wretched animal frieze and medallion, it would pass as a good Chimaera Group plate, in every detail of its profile, the color of its half-round foot and rim moldings, and the narrow red and black rings on the underside; compare, e.g., K1 or X37 (Callipolitis-Feytmans 1962, fig. 17, CM 59 and 61). The animal frieze no longer resembles those on V4 and V5; it does resemble that 92 Similarly, after assessing the complexion of Corinthian pottery at Tocra, Boardman and Hayes observe, "So our Corinthian may have been imported mostly in large batches" (Tocra I, p. 21). 93 Callipolitis-Feytmans 1962, p. 149, fig. 15, and p. 153, fig. 17. 94 CorVP, p. 167. The other pieces, much better, that he lists as "near" or "related to" the Carrousel Painter all seem to me to be related, truly, but differently, as animal-frieze work sharing the Carrousel Painter's specific origins (see Berlin F 3929, CorVP, p. 166, B 1) rather than dependent on his own work.</page><page sequence="29">82 PATRICIA LAWRENCE on V6, but the animals are walking in the wrong direction, felines clockwise, ruminants counterclockwise, contrary to V1-V6. Perhaps another hand has taken over; if so, he has done just that, no more. Now, from V6 or V7 to Tocra I, no. 301, is another easy step, and the latter is a silhouette-frieze plate; no profile of it is provided, but silhouette plates quite commonly, if they are not small or very late, have profiles and rim banding very much as in the Chimaera Group.95 Remarkably, on Tocra I, no. 301, all but one of the animals again walk as they did for the Carrousel Painter (ruminants clockwise), and the bird reappears. It is by no means unlikely that the Carrousel Painter did the Tocra silhouette plate. It should be clear why, in the summary of conclusions, I suggested the apparent dichotomy that, as a painter, the Carrousel Painter might not qualify as a member of the Chimaera Group, while it is rather likely that a number of silhouette plates were fabricated in the Chimaera workshop. A Group may coincide largely with a Workshop; evidently it is not quite the same thing. CHRONOLOGY Periodization ("Is this still EC or already MC?") can be as misleading as the use of absolute dates. Frantois Villard,96 by proposing dates that let MC begin ten years before EC ends, allows a truer picture to be drawn, and, asJean Ducat made clear,97 those dates, actually very similar to Payne's for the periods that concern us here, are as good as presently can be obtained. It has become a cliche to question stylistically based dates by invoking young 95 This is true even at the end of MC: Boehlau 1899, p. 137, pl. V: 1. 96 See the center column, headed "Villard, Les vases grecs, 1956," in Ducat 1962, p. 182, Table II. 97 Ducat 1962, especially his conclusions, p. 182. Since I do not believe that a Lydian monarch necessarily would be constrained by having made diplomatic offerings at Delphi, for "le plus grand intervalle possible," from making war on any Greek city, which is Ducat's only reason for putting the destruction of Smyrna at ca. 595-590 B.C. instead of ca. 605-600 (p. 181); and since Alyattes' taking over from his father the war against the Milesians (p. 179) does not necessarily imply his concluding it instantly on coming to the throne, so that even 605 is an uncertain, if probable, terminus post quem; and since Ducat satisfactorily disposes of all other arguments for various proposed revisions, he most laudably concludes, "Nous nous garderons bien de proposer un autre systdme (un de plus!) pour remplacer celui de Payne.... Mais ce que l'on peut esperer c'est que les archeologues trouvent d'autres points de repere qui permettent de dater sufrement la ceramique de Corinthe" (p. 182). Query: What could be found to yield a dependable absolute date? As for Smyrna, the "end of the Middle Corinthian period" fragments from Pit 5 (Anderson 1958-1959, nos. 131-133, p. 149, pl. 28) are misdated; "end of EC, probably coinciding with the beginning of MC style", in my opinion, is a correct assessment. If this is "reoccupation" pottery, as published, it leaves very little time for abandonment. On the exhausted character of late EC, see Corinth VII, ii, An 75, p. 87 and pl. 107, which represents the stage in question though in a different stylistic tradition and on a different shape from the Smyrna examples. Late and terminal MC style, even when wretched, is different. Papaspyridi-Karouzou (1963, p. 122 and fig. 86) compared the Nessos Painter with the Dipylon kouros; this is a relative date. Whether the kouros is dated ca. 600 B.C. or later, the absolute-looking date will be found ultimately to be based on pottery, and the dates of the pottery on the familiar foundation dates and Near Eastern monarchs. In her slightly later summary of the literature, G. M. A. Richter (Korai, New York 1968, p. 26) reached conclusions similar to Ducat's and quoted Dunbabin's warning against "vicious precision".</page><page sequence="30">THE CHIMAERA GROUP AT CORINTH 83 and old, conservative and progressive artists. The argument has little substance, for old or conservative artists never have been loath to adopt a few ideas from new trends.98 It is equally true that at the time that Villard calls both EC and MC, ca. 600-590 B.C., when vase painters like the Dodwell Painter,99 the Medallion Painter,100 and the Chimaera Painter were forging MC style, an older artist, like the Columbus Painter, though all his later work contains telltale elements and ideas of the new style, and though he made some contribution to it himself, continued to design his animals and distribute his filling ornament in what must be called an EC style. Clarity on this point is basic to what follows; when I say that the Columbus Painter is an EC artist and that one of his alabastra (not the latest) is contemporary with one of the Chimaera Painter's plates, I am not saying that the Chimaera Painter "began in EC" and not saying that it is wrong to call the alabastron an EC pot. 101 THE RELATIVE CHRONOLOGY OF THE CHIMAERA GRouP Developments during the Chimaera Painter's Youth Two plates, V1 and V2, are certainly Early Corinthian in style, although the double foot molding on V2,102 like the ring foot on "Columbus" alabastra (see p. 84 below), is an innovation. Hopper called attention to the EC lotus and filling ornament on V1,103 and V2 is only a little more advanced. Since U1, poorly preserved and unavailable for autopsy, the earliest Corinthian plate with confronted horse protomai, has a plus-shaped rosette in the center and the horses look even earlier than those on X2, it probably also antedates the beginning of the Chimaera Painter's career. Placing that beginning at ca. 600 B.C., making the Chimaera Painter one of the origi- nators of MC style,104 follows from the very early characteristics of his first work, which his astonishing proficiency tends to mask. On X1, his earliest floral plate, the evidence of the profile (see p. 102 and Fig. 1, p. 100 below) is borne out by the few and fat petals of its lotuses and palmettes (Fig. 4, p. 117 below); the Columbus Painter's Oinanthe alabastron,105 probably not more than a decade later, has petals comparable rather with Xli. The floral fragments X13 and X14, if the rest of the design also resembled X1, could be equally early. What is new is the highly disciplined quality of the design.106 98 It is sometimes asserted that connoisseurs could not establish the contemporaneity of works reflecting different stylistic preferences if their documentation had been lost. Not true. For example, the stylistic evidence for contemporaneity at a date not far from A.D. 1400 and in Florence far outweighs in the trial reliefs for the north doors of its Baptistery the elements of Brunelleschi's independence and Ghiberti's conventionality. 99 CorVP, pp. 205-210. 100 CorVP, pp. 194-195. 101 The plates S2 and S3, which might prove to be his, are MC plates, but they are later than and in several ways different from the alabastra. I have not seen the Florence alabastron, CorVP, p. 86, A 11, which is singled out as especially late. 102 Callipolitis-Feytmans 1962, p. 125. 103 Perachora II, at no. 1943, p. 193. '10 See also Amyx 196 la, p. 14, but he makes the whole of the Columbus Painter antecedent. 105 CorVP, p. 86, A 12. 10 Corinth VII, ii, p. 85.</page><page sequence="31">84 PATRICIA LAWRENCE The horse protomai on X2, which has a profile like that of XI, only larger, not only still have manes of an EC type107 but also, like very early kouroi, are constructed to be graphically rational, to make a horse pattern that is convincing, not because it looks like a horse but because the pattern is clearly structured and the traits typifying a horse perfectly integrated. This "conceptual" way of drawing (or carving, or modeling) is Early Archaic. The last horse-protomai plate, L14, requires description in quite different terms. Both X1 and X2 on the bottom have only a pair of narrow rings near the center and a pair near the foot molding, all in plain glaze-paint. Distinguishable from the last two by their more developed ring patterns, slightly more sophisticated profiles, and altogether masterly drawing, six plates by the Chimaera Painter and the earliest work showing his influence are still extremely early and, I judge, all still closer to ca. 600 than to ca. 590 B.C.'08 These are X4-X9, V3, V4, and RI. The Cincinnati plate, X4, and X5, which is like it, must be the earliest of the plates displaying a feline, those on which the Chimaera Painter's fame rests. Which of the Columbus Painter's alabastra should be most nearly contemporary? The early ones, like Syracuse, M.N. 34993,109 have small-headed lions with short ruffs, and their mid-EC filling ornament also puts them out of consideration. Of the well published lions, those of London, B.M. A 1399 and Athens, N.M. 12721,110 with large heads, long ruffs, almost mannered shoulders, and abundant white-dot embellishment, seem latest; they do not even have double lines in the shoulder, and the filling ornament is most evolved. These, in fact, should be later than X4, where the ruff is a little shorter, the shoulders and neck are less hefty, and the leaf-shaped shoulder actually derives from early Columbus Painter lions, like those on Syracuse, M.N. 34993. The requisite development is found in the lions of the ring-footed "Columbus" alabastra, Delos B 6322 and Louvre MNB 629,1,i whose ruffs just overlap the shoulder, which is divided by a double line; their foreleg markings also are more similar to those on X4, and the sobriety of the style more consonant; white dots are absent. The ring-footed alabastron, unlike the flat-bottomed aryballos, was only a passing fad in Corinth;112 significantly, the experiment can be linked with the birth of a new style. The New York chimaera, X6, is placed next, because the eight rosettes, now all double centered (X4 has one simple rosette), are so similar; so is the plate itself. But the chimaera has a longer neck, shorter nose, shallower mouth, straighter tongue, a twice-divided 107 Like ]ecrocorinthia, p. 72, fig. 18:C and D, as opposed to fig. 18:E and F; this is not the only kind of EC mane (an enclosed area divided into horizontal or diagonal bands), but it is one that ceased to be used as MC style established itself. 108 In what follows, I shall use dates with what may seem "vicious precision" (note 97, p. 82 above), since a concise mode of expression is required. What is to be understood is that (a) I accept a chronology similar to Payne's and to that used for early Attic black figure, and (b) I use the "dates" ca. 600, ca. 590, and so on, as a graduated scale. This understanding of the only concise way of expressing development/time is implicit in every date that I give. 109 CorVP, p. 85, A 6. 110 CorVP, p. 85, A I and A 3. 1 CorVP, p. 86, A 13 and A 14. 12 Amyx 1961 a, p. 14, on their contemporary invention.</page><page sequence="32">THE CHIMAERA GROUP AT CORINTH 85 shoulder, and more angular haunches than the lioness on X4.113 Everything on X6 is a little more elegantly accomplished, on X4 a little more dynamically compact. Both still have the Columbus Painter's teardrop pouch below the lion's eye (so has X5), but on the chimaera the ruff is elaborated in the pattern characteristic of the Chimaera Painter's early lions.1 14 The Louvre lioness plate, X7, is smaller, but the decorative banding on the rim and around the floor is uniquely heavy and rich in added red. The rings on the bottom 15 also are experimental. The profile is exactly comparable with that of X6, but the lioness's head looks earlier than that of the New York chimaera; the powerful lower jaw and deep mouth, the eyebrow incision which only on X7 corresponds to the paint contour of the brow, the small round ear, all look very early, but the ruff and neck are longer than on X4, and so is the lioness's body. The red in the forelegs, 1 16 the red-dotted tail, and the fat (early) lotus bud all are unique, although the snake part on X6 also has red dots, and the absence of rosettes suggests an external influence. X8 is fragmentary and inadequately published, but the long-shanked forelegs and the treatment of the lioness's belly recommend placing it with X7."1 7 The Carrousel Painter's V3 and V4, whose profiles are early, 1 18 also belong here. The Carrousel Painter, who on V1 and V2 used so much nondescript filling ornament, on V3 uses only two large rosettes on the face and one on the bottom, all three carefully drawn and double centered; V4 has only a single double-centered rosette, in the frieze on the bottom. V3 and V4 also have smaller central medallions than V2 and rays with attenuated points, and one panther on the bottom of V4 is seated heraldically with a raised foreleg.119 All these traits show that they are later than V2; the tiny heraldic panther and, especially, the void field must reflect the same influence or shift in taste that was responsible for X7. The influence would have to be that of the Chimaera Painter, for the Painter of Louvre E 574 did not use raised forelegs, and his earliest surviving work must be a little later. The relationship of X9 to X4-X7 has already been discussed (p. 59 above) tojustify the attribution. This is the Chimaera Painter's earliest work with amoeboid forms below lions' eyes (PI. 39; his early plates show him rapidly replacing inherited formulas), the earliest that certainly has an elaborate composition of two lions, one repeated more naturalistically on X37. Here at a date still close to X2 and on a plate with an early MC profile, the 113 We cannot say whether the ruff overlapped the shoulder or was tucked behind it on X6 because the only important restoration on the plate is just there. 114 On the bottom, X4 adds to the two pairs of narrow rings inherited from plates like X2 a single narrow red ring at the center and another intermediate between the pairs of black rings. The very large bottom of X6 has three pairs of similar narrow black rings and between the inner pairs a red band equal in width to a black pair. 115 CVA, Louvre 6 [France 9], pl. 8 [392]:4. 116 The Louvre plates are free of retouches; all the added red is original. 117 The curious arrangement of the surviving parts suggests that the subject may have been two lionesses, perhaps as on X9. 118 Callipolitis-Feytmans 1962, pp. 125-126. 119 Ibid., p. 129, fig. 6, bottom.</page><page sequence="33">86 PATRICIA LAWRENCE artist already eliminates the manes, as on X37 (the design is fussy enough without them), but still draws sharp molars, as on X4, X5, and X7; the rosettes (so far as X9 is preserved) are already in the same places as on X37, although one might be dated ca. 595, the other ca. 580 B.C. On X9 as on the horse-protomai plate X2, however, the topknots are level; also, as those horses' forelegs are level and crossed symmetrically, these lions' tails intertwine in a symmetrical pattern and rise straight on axis, right between the heads, with their tips together, level, right between the rosettes. The later plate, X37, like the later horse-protomai plate, L14, modifies and naturalizes all this, while retaining the old compositional motif The Riehen Painter's R1, whose lions are directly inspired by such as on X4-X9, and by no others, cannot be appreciably later than these plates. It thus stands earlier than known aryballoi by the Chimaera Painter. X21, a fragment preserving only a panther's face (P1. 44), is obviously earlier than X25 and might, since the amoeboid forms under the eyes are still unspecialized and large as on X9, be placed here by the criterion of the incised work alone, but I have listed it closer to the complete aryballos, X25, because the missing body and floral centerpiece might not have looked quite so early as the face does.120 Developments during the Chimaera Painter's Early Maturiy His namepiece, L1, is surely the earliest work that we possess by the Painter of Louvre E 574; the size alone warns us not to place it too early relative to the later work of the Columbus Painter.121 At this point the lions on London, B.M. A 1399 and Athens, N.M. 12721,122 which, like L1, have white dots123 and a grandiose manner, are relevant. In the numerous, parallel incised arcs on the lion's muzzle (London) we may even see the pupil's influence on the teacher, who might well have been impressed but never sufficiently to discard his evolved but essentially EC filling ornament. The Painter of Louvre E 574, always faithful to his teacher's crosshatched mane and long-jawed lion face with a curling tongue, and to the shoulder divided by a double line, later refined the shape of the shoulder (L4, L7) and developed, step in step with the Chimaera Painter, the markings of the forelegs and their joint at the shoulder.124 Li, which is undeveloped in these respects, can be only a little later than X4-X7; it could be contemporary with X9. From the beginning, the artists worked in very different manners. The elegance and elongation on Li are innate in the Painter of Louvre E 574, not a sign of advanced date. The Zurich aryballos, R2,125 by the Riehen Painter, stands in the same relationship to Li as R1 does to X4-X9. The lion's head, shoulder, and forelegs presuppose the existence 120 Well I does not provide evidence for an exact chronological placement; Corinth XV, ii, p. 22; Corinth XV, iii, p. 7. 121 It is as tall as Ddlos X, no. 451, pls.

None of the Columbus Painter's alabastra is quite so tall. 122 CorVP, p. 85, A I and A 3. 123 The "ghosts" of white dots, bounded by parallel incised lines, are visible on Li but not in photographs. They are used less lavishly than on L7. 124 Six lions on three vases, Li, L4, and L7, have the same ruff, certainly his own invention; on L8 the lions' heads are not preserved. 125 R2 differs in shape and syntax from other flat-bottomed aryballoi in the Chimaera Group; it is also smaller: H. 0. 1 15. The height of the rest ranges from 0. 15 m. to more than 0. 1 7 m.</page><page sequence="34">THE CHIMAERA GROUP AT CORINTH 87 of lions as on Li; the hindquarters and tail are composed as on L7, an aryballos, but the simplicity of the foreleg markings and the shoulder require models very early in the career of the Painter of Louvre E 574, as on L1. The Selinous plate, S1, should be no later; the gorgoneion certainly is MC, and the lion protomai have ruffs that bespeak the activity of the Painter of Louvre E 574, but the horse protomai are still designed in terms similar to those of X2, and the lions' heads, apart from the ruffs, are perhaps more closely akin to those of the Columbus Painter.126 Similarly, another exceptional plate, remotely related to the Chimaera Group, has a very early-looking profile'27 and an early MC palmette chain on the rim. For the Chimaera Painter himself, this stage, probably centering on ca. 590 B.C.) is represented by X10-X12 and X15-X17. The profiles of these plates (see p. 102 below) are discernibly more developed than those of X4-X9. The Ny Carlsberg plate, X10, is placed first because its nearly complete preservation and ambitious figural decoration provide grounds for accurate relative placement. The Medallion Painter's great oinochoe in Palermo128 must be just contemporary; if its Potnia's head might be earlier, that of the sphinx beside her probably could not (its new elegance makes one remember that Li also is contemporary), and no other animal alien to the Chimaera Group is developmentally so comparable with the goat on the bottom of X10 as the ram facing an owl on the middle frieze of the Palermo oinochoe.129 Still, X10 could hardly be the earlier of the two, since the Chimaera Painter's Potnia has a composite headband and a separate tress of hair issuing from behind the ear. On the other hand, her skull, the separation of the neck from the underchin, and the placement of the ear all are very much less advanced than on the Medallion Painter's "classic MC" namepiece, Boston, M.EA. 12.422.130 A famous Potnia, no earlier than X10, is on Payne's NC 381,131 one of a very few alabastra larger than Li; once the process had begun, very little time would be required for the attractive late EC style of NC 380132 to become the garish and overladen travesty of NC 381. Its actual date must be close to that of X10, while NC 380 is probably earlier than the Columbus Painter's ring-footed alabastra.133 The Potnia's face on NC 381, indeed the whole style, has evolved from its EC beginnings; there is scarcely a hint of fresh 126 See p. 80 above. 127 Corinth C-64-388; Corinth VII, ii, no. 153, pl. 27. 128 CorVP p. 195, A 9, pl. 77. 129 Amyx 1961b, pl. 10:c. 30 CorVP, p. 195, A 3, pl. 76:a-c. 131 Ddlos X, no. 451 (see note 121, p. 86 above).

The Taucheira Painter is one hand in the Luxus Group; on the non-viability of "White-Dot Style" as a stylistic category, see CorVP, p. 87. 132 Ddlos X, no. 450, pl. XXXIII. This alabastron is unattributed in Amyx's Luxus Group (CorVP, p. 91, The Luxus Group: Unattributed Vases, no. 1); if I have understood his remarks (CorVP, p. 89, The Taucheira Painter) correctly, he thinks that Payne did not mean to say that NC 380 represents the starting point of "White-Dot Style"; there are many typographical errors in ]ecrocorinthia, but, as my own remarks show, I do not think that this is one of them. NC 380 (Dilos X, no. 450) is by a different hand, but I agree with Payne that its style was the starting point for the Luxus development. My current work in the Luxus Group promises clarification of the relative positions of NC 380 and 381. 133 CorVP p. 86, A 13-A 15.</page><page sequence="35">88 PATRICIA LAWRENCE MC ideas, and only mindlessness can account for the scrambled lines in the swans' wings. Swans significantly more comparable with those held by the Chimaera Painter's Potnia are seen on the Columbus Painter's late alabastra in London and Athens, just compared with Li.'34 The London swan has an elegance, different from all his others, that belongs to this time. All these parallels confirm the placement derived from the Chimaera Painter's goats alone (see pp. 61-62 above), that X10 falls between X6 and X28 but is closer to the former, as its goat's peculiar eyes, paralleled only on X2, would suggest. On X10, the evidence of the figure work is so many-sided and complete that the figure work must date the profile of the plate, which then can be used to control the placement of poorly preserved pieces. X10 is the first plate in the list with a comparatively level rim, not slanting as in EC (some Protocorinthian plates had nearly upright rims).'35 The floral plates X11 and X12 are near replicas, except that the curled tendrils (with red dots that recall those on the lioness's tail, X7, and the chimaera's snake, X6) are omitted on X12, where the lotus sepals also have a more pronounced outward curve, and all the petals are tipped with small nubs, which either go back to that on the bud of X7 or are borrowed from contemporary floral aryballoi among the later products of the Lion Group.'36 The Catania plate, accordingly, could be the later of the two, but the pattern on the bottom and the profile are unknown,'37 and so it is placed tentatively here with X11. The three almost equally spaced broad bands on the bottom of X11 already appeared on X9, but here the second band is overpainted red to complement the color on the foot and rim moldings. Where X1, X13, and X14 (PI. 38) had five petals on each of the preserved lotus and palmette, X1 1 has eight and nine on the lotuses, twelve and fourteen on the palmettes (which, however, are proportionately larger in this design); the Columbus Painter's late alabastron of Oinanthe has already been compared.'38 For such a large plate, X11 has a crudely turned profile, resembling V2 and V3 (only two thirds its size) in this as in the slanting, early MC, angle of the rim. The profile of X16 (Fig. 1, p. 100 below) shows that it cannot be much later than X9; this rim is only slightly more curved. Unfortunately, the center of the plate, with most of the sphinx's body and its wings, is lost, and the stylistic development hard to judge. The forelegs could be very early indeed, and the pattern of paired black and single red narrow bands on the bottom is that of X4. But the flame-shaped "Volomandra locks" over the brow, though in an undeveloped form compared with those on X30, should not be quite so early, and the squared-off termination of the fall of hair also is paralleled, in the 134 CorVP, p. 85, A 1 and A 3; Amyx 1961a, Beil. 6:1 and 2. 135 Callipolitis-Feytmans 1962, figs. 10-1 4; see also Corinth VII, ii, pl. 112. 136 CorVP, p. 118; the floral complexes with nubs on the petals are illustrated by Payne (Necrocorinthia, p. 146, fig. 53:B; p. 151, fig. 57:B and C; p. 152, fig. 59:A). 137 The plate, with X8, belongs to a votive deposit which is in storage in the Museo Communale and has received only preliminary publication. The deposit (Rizza 1960) includes a good deal of pottery later than either of these plates. 138 CorVP, p. 86, no. 12. In Attic, compare the floral cross on Vari Krater B (Papaspyridi-Karouzou 1963, pls. 19cr, 19p) with those of the next generation (Scheibler 1961, pp. 1-47), especially the amphora Louvre E 817 (ibid., p. 2, fig. 2, and p. 14, fig. 17). The floral work and sphinxes here, as Scheibler's list (p. 20) suggests, are just earlier than the Gorgon dinos, Louvre E 874. X11 could be as late as the amphora Louvre E 817; the floral work on the Gorgon dinos seems to me slightly later.</page><page sequence="36">THE CHIMAERA GROUP AT CORINTH 89 Group, only on X30.139 The drawing, on the other hand, is much more formal than on the namepiece, X28, or X30 (more nearly comparable with X10), and the sphinx's profile looks even earlier. On X15 (P1. 38), also, the drawing is formal and sturdy, resembling that on X16, and the squarish lotus flower could be quite early; too little is left of the griffin to suggest its relative position in terms of the relative development of this creature. The paired narrow rings on the bottom, so far as preserved, also are like those on X16, and their curvature shows that X15 was as large a plate. Another difficult placement,'40 that ofthe intact kotyle-pyxis X17 (Pls. 40, 41), can be reduced to similar terms; it is "still early" Chimaera Painter, bearing traits that preclude placing it much earlier or later. The vase, with its lid, cannot be nearly so late as Payne's NC 974A,141 the latest kotyle-pyxis known to him, which has a domed lid, squat body, and proportionately broad foot; its black-figure style also is advanced MC, and the palmette, lotus, and tendril ornament on the lid (the lotus with splayed calyx, splayed sepals) is much more advanced than the floral pieces on Xli and X12. It cannot be nearly so early as Payne's later-EC example, NC 700,142 where the conical lid complements the tall vase with a narrow foot. The lid of X17 is no longer conical but is only incipiently domed, while the vase is still fairly tall143 but broader footed than NC 700. The lid certainly belongs to the vase, so the relative date cannot be earlier than the frieze on the lid will allow; it is the animal frieze on the vase that looks very early and recalls the Carrousel Painter's V3 and V4. The lions on the lid of X17 are small, yet all have eyes fully surrounded by amoeboid shapes; on larger lions this feature appears first on X18. They have shallower mouths than any really early lion, comparable again with X18, and it is first on X18 that we see a really sharp-tipped leaf-shaped shoulder, which is used consistently on X17, sometimes divided by a double line, so that Hopper thought of the Dodwell Painter,144 and sometimes reduced to a sliver for want of space, but always in its developed form, not as on X4-X7 but as on X18, X28, and on X25 (Pls. 42:a, 43:a) and X29 (P1. 45:a), aryballoi in mature style, and on the pyxides with female heads, X26 and X39 (Pls. 47:a, b, 48:a, d). Where it has a double line, this fits the shoulder more as on the Painter of Louvre E 574's L4 and L7 than as on L1, where the placement of the double line still recalls the Columbus Painter's usual practice. Yet the vase shape of X17 urges placing it as early as possible, and the friezes of X26 are not only more consistent in style but also clearly related to work more mature than X18. The lekanoid bowl X18, then, exhibits innovations that, with its ruff borrowed from the Painter of Louvre E 574 (the sharp locks continued inside the ear are the Chimaera 139 Hair rendered in this way, in both Attic and Corinthian, however, is not new; it is, rather, old-fashioned. As a simplification of a vase-painterly rendering of one kind of Daedalic wig, it is commoner in the late 7th than in the early 6th century. 140 The present assessment supersedes my placement of the kotyle-pyxis as among the Chimaera Painter's earliest works (Lawrence 1959, p. 362; 1963, p. 185). 141 Copenhagen, N.M.

It is an ideal model for certain Attic lions with Ohrlock ruffs.145 It is also slightly more loosely drawn than any of the foregoing large felines. X19, a plate fragment from Kameiros in Bonn, preserves the lion's ear and part of the ruff, which is exactly like that on X18. The bottom has the broad bands of X9 and Xli. The rosette, like those on X18, is not quite so tightly drawn as on really early work. At this point, we may consider several pieces that cannot be early but seem less advanced than X25 or X28; several of them are fragments. X21 (P1. 44) is not only neater than X25, but the amoeboid shapes around the eyes look earlier,146 and the head from ear to ear is narrower. The plaque fragment from the Potters' Quarter, X23, preserves still less, but that little does not seem necessarily earlier than X28, though fastidiously executed. The double-sided plate fragment X24 might be as late as X28 and X30, but its style surely requires placing it considerably earlier than L5 and L6, for which it or similar plates will have been prototypes. The snake parts preserved on X24 are of the same kind, with scale borders along the sides of each trunk, as on L4-L6, but the borders on X24 are still rather wide, with proportionately large scales; compare Payne's NC 97 (Transitional) and NC 531 (EC).147 The smaller New York plate, X22, has a rather level, not especially early-looking profile. As with the connoisseurship, so for chronology, everything depends on the man's head (the pattern on the back is of a type148 that, once established, remained popular for a considerable time), and the head may be as close to X16 as to X30. Finally, L2, the aryballos that cleaning rescued for the Painter of Louvre E 574, has the fully MC composition with a full-size creature firmly planted on the same groundline as the flanking felines, as on L4 and L7, not a smaller bird or hare or diminutive siren, as in the tradition from the Painter of Palermo 489149 to the Columbus Painter and even to Li; that creature, furthermore, is a griffin-bird. On the other hand, the tolerably well preserved sphinx at right (P1. 50) quite lacks the sophisticated form that distinguishes L7 and L9; L4 has lions with meager bodies, but the sphinx's hindquarters on L2 are still more meager. Her head is closer to those on L7 and L9 than to that of the little siren on Li. 145 S.

Bakir 1981, pls. 11, 16, 19, 26, 46 provide a sampling of photographs that show this feature clearly. The Ankara spouted bowl, Baklr's no. A 19, probably represents direct borrowing from a lion by the Chimaera Painter at exactly the time of X18. I agree with Bakir (op. cit., p. 52) that it is specifically from the Chimaera Painter that Sophilos borrowed Corinthian elements. The enclosed sawtooth ruff was the invention of the Painter of Louvre E 574, but there is no hint of the latter artist's stylistic influence in Sophilos's work, and whatever the relationship amounted to in actuality, it was the Chimaera Painter who had real connections with his Attic contemporaries. 14 Those on X25 have been assimilated to the (originally Attic) amoeboid cells proper to lions' eyes, as on X18 and X28; those on X21 are designed for the frontal panther's face.

Fourteen other pieces are to be grouped with them, but the length of the list seems to testify rather to intense activity (or selective accidents of preservation) than to a long period. I suppose them all to have been made within a period expressible as ca. 590 to ca. 580 B.C. but without requiring a whole decade for the development that they represent. This is the time when the Chimaera Group is most obviously a working entity. The Gela aryballos, X25, already has been singled out for comparison with the Vienna chimaera plate, X28.150 The chimaera is better work; the Chimaera Painter did not handle strongly convex surfaces so happily as the Painter of Louvre E 574 and gave his best efforts to plates. But they tally in trait after trait and share a striking new sobriety due to the reduction or elimination of the pretty, double-curved contours that characterize the glaze-paint silhouettes on X4-X7 and even on X18. G2 presupposes an aryballos like X25 but not such as L4, L7, and X29; coming from the same site, it is not impossible (or even unlikely) that G2 and X25 left Corinth in a single shipload. R3 is a very similar vase, evidently by the same potter at about the same time, but its provenience is unknown. The triplet plates, K1-K3, two of them from Kameiros but the third from Corinth, with K3 bis and the bowl K4, whether or not they eventually prove to be by the Chimaera Painter, belong to this stage in the Group's development, as comparison with the lotus- and-palmette centerpieces on X25 (P1. 42:b) and X29 reveals. Like the felines, they are more boldly conceived and less deliberately pretty than their early MC predecessors X11 and X12. On K2, the pattern on the bottom of the plate is exactly as on Xli, X19, and X22; K1 has a different ring pattern that is equally typical of the Group. The profiles also differ.151 G1, G3, and G4 are less distinguished than X25; they have no traits of late MC but are just as remote from the early freshness of X1, so best placed here, especially since G1 preserves the same floral pattern as G2.152 The Hermitage pyxis, X26, must be contemporary with X25 and X28. That its female heads have been called "early MC" may mean either that its stylistic development is to be placed as close as possible to ca. 590 (and all the preceding development conceived as rapid evolution requiring not much more than a decade, as indeed is not impossible) or that the mold represents a type that was created somewhat earlier than its occurrence on this vase. 153 Certainly its plastic heads are of an earlier type than those on X39 (PI. 49). 150 Lawrence 1959, p. 352. 151 Callipolitis-Feytmans 1962, p. 143, fig. 17:57 (K2) and 59 (K1). The Louvre plate, K2, is the finest of the three in all respects. The correspondence of the concave back of the rim to its curved surface and the perfect toruses of the foot and rim moldings represent fine craftsmanship. 152 Amyx (CorVP, p. 174, no. 10) says that G3 is "like the foregoing" (K1-K3); its style and manner are indeed rather similar, but the pattern is built on rings instead of knotted loops; that is, on the design structure of G1, with lotuses substituted for two of the palmettes. Callipolitis-Feytmans (1962, p. 135) compares the "luxe d'entrelacs" of K1-K3 with Attic work; this has special relevance if they prove to be by the Chimaera Painter. 153 Students of terracotta figurines will vouch for the likelihood of the second alternative; when one dates such a head, it is the type from which the mold derives that is dated.</page><page sequence="39">92 PATRICIA LAWRENCE The siren painted on the shoulder, 154 if that part alone were preserved as a fragment, would be placed squarely in the middle of MC; the general character of the style is paralleled by the Dodwell Painter's broad-bottomed oinochoe in Rio dejaneiro rather than his early work, e.g., the Dodwell pyxis itself, or his latest style.'55 The attribution to the Chimaera Painter was based originally on comparisons with work at this stage,156 but the Boreads on X31-X33, not then available for study, are especially like that on the shoulder of X26.157 The "sobriety" and "weight" of the animals and the close similarity of the goats' heads to that on X28 also confirm its placement here. The fragment of a pyxis, X27, in as much as it preserves, resembles X26. The innovative character of the Vienna chimaera, X28, has always been recognized. It is still true that any lion's head with a ruff drawn in this way must reflect its artist's awareness of the Chimaera Painter's mature work. A technical observation suggests that X28 was the first, or one ofthe first, pieces on which he used it. The Chimaera Painter must have drawn very many felines by the time that he decorated the Vienna plate. Accordingly, it is not surprising that among all the masterly incised configurations on the plate there is no sign of preparatory sketching except in the innovative ruff, where, with raking light, indented sketching under the paint is clearly visible, and we can observe how the artist perfected the curvature and distribution of the individual locks in the final execution.158 The ruff really is new and special. The plate itself is finished with unusual care; it was perfectly recentered for turning and banding, the turning is exact, comparable, for once, with fine Attic work, it is the only plate in the Group with two grooves, instead of one, at the edge of the rim, and the banding is related to these grooves most precisely.'59 It is only a medium-sized plate, and the back has only the pattern of black and red broad bands (with carefully adjusted spacing, just as on X 1),160 but everything suggests that the artist took uncommon pains with it; justly it is his namepiece. Its profile, concomitantly, also may be regarded as classic for the Group and as marking the midpoint in MC development. Two pieces with lions' ruffs that presuppose that of X28 are S2 and S3, the strange plates surprisingly similar to the style of the Columbus Painter; otherwise, in the structure of the lions' heads and in the filling ornament, they are conservative work. The shape of the raised forepaws, however, and their markings are best paralleled on X25 (Pls. 42:a, 43:a). Similarly, the development of the amoeboid forms around the eyes on L3 presupposes panther faces as on X25 rather than X21 (PI. 44). It is doubtful, too, that any artist in the 154 Lawrence 1959, pl. 90: figs. 18, 19. 155 Amyx 1971, pis. 1 (the Dodwell pyxis), 6 (the Rio vase), 3 (late), and 4: fig. 1 (late). 156 Lawrence 1959, p. 355. 157 Ibid., pl. 91: figs. 21, 22. 158 On no other piece, under magnification and with the plate in hand, have I observed the artist similarly engaged in perfecting a design. 159 The grooves are not simple V-gouges; the inner face of each groove is vertical, perpendicular to the surface on which the plate rests, so that they provide two steps down to the round molding of the rim. The molding has red over black, as usual, but very accurately applied. Just above each groove on the surface of the rim is a black line, that above the outer groove less than one millimeter wide, that above the inner a little less than two. 160 To obtain the effect of painted and reserved bands all of the same width, the bands are widened slightly as the circles expand.</page><page sequence="40">THE CHIMAERA GROUP AT CORINTH 93 Group would have made the panther's head quite so wide between the ears at an earlier date. L3, unfortunately, preserves nothing of the rim profile, but the simple banding on the bottom does not require a late date, and the panther's head (P1. 51) is still far from the perfected manner of its comparandum on L1i or even the panthers on L9. The aryballoi L4 (P1. 52) and L7 by the Painter of Louvre E 574 bear lions which, if less magnificent than the pair on L1, are more refined and have more advanced details. The double line in the shoulder now responds exactly to the calculated curvature of the enclosure of the shoulder; the forelegs have perfect ladder markings comparable with those on X25161 and X29. Something like ladder markings, but tentative, occurs first on X4, but in their final, characteristic form they belong to this and later stages in the Chimaera Group, occurring even on one of the small lions on X26.162 The arched marking on the front of the foreleg, inherited from the Columbus Painter, in combination with ladder marks, appears first on L4 and L7; this compound configuration is conspicuous on all subsequent felines by the Painter of Louvre E 574 or directly influenced by his work. Otherwise the lions on L4 and L7 are conservative, retaining the enclosed sawtooth ruff, gaping jaws, and long, curling tongue based directly on the Columbus Painter's EC tradition. The aryballoi themselves resemble X25, G2, and R3. Another aryballos of the same kind is X29 (P1. 45); its relative chronological position is plain, since its lions are directly and immediately influenced by felines such as the chimaera on X28 and the lions on L4 and L7.163 The Chimaera Painter's aryballoi all have floral centerpieces,164 the two that are complete very similar; these seem to be contemporary with K1-K3. The Painter of Louvre E 574's L4 and L7 (like L2 and L9) have large figures between the felines: a siren (L7) developmentally comparable, in its proportions, with the Chimaera Painter's X30, and a Typhon (L4) which helps in dating L5 and L6. Yet another aryballos, the Riehen Painter's R4,165 can hardly be earlier than X29 and L7. The attribution of X30 was argued on its intimate relationship to X28.166 Now the evidence of the equally broad individual locks in the lions' ruffs on X29 and the equally solid bodily proportions of the siren on L7 may be added to confirm that this is also its relative chronological placement. The potter's work sets X30 apart; it has a single foot molding, and the rim slants upward. The upward slant is matched on the floral plate K1 (which is not for that feature to be thought earlier than its finer replica K2), but the whole fabric of X30 is atypical and unusually delicate, even compared with another plate, X37, that is equally small; we must allow for personal differences and experimentation. 161 Since the first publication of X25, a fragment in the forepart of the seated panther has disappeared; for these ladder markings, the original publication (reproduced in Necrocorinthia, p. 305, fig. 140 bis) must be consulted. 162 Lawrence 1959, pI. 90: fig. 19. 163 The Mormino aryballoi were separately acquired, and there is nothing to suggest that they came from one tomb, cemetery, or site. 164 The tip of a lotus petal in the expected position near the panther's face is preserved on X21. 165 Examining R4 I thought (without using ultraviolet light or any laboratory test) that the added red paint and perhaps also the glaze-paint had been touched up by a restorer, but I saw no evidence that the contours of the figures or the incisions had been affected. 166 Lawrence 1959, pp. 351-352.</page><page sequence="41">94 PATRICIA LAWRENCE The head of the Boread on X31 is very close to that of the male siren on X30. It is perhaps slightly later, since the eye is not quite so large, and the brow and waves framing the face are a little less boldly drawn. The development is towards the Berlin Boread, X34, but that plate represents something new (see below). The pattern of large scales on the bodice and the radiating lines in the skirt of the tunic on X31 are paralleled rather by the Boread on the Hermitage pyxis, X26. Both of these traits recur on the fragment X32, a near replica of X31; X33 also must be contemporary. These Boreads have exceptionally massive limbs, even for the Chimaera Painter. Labels are pernicious; "majestic" lions, "heavy" style, and "monumentality"'67 all have obscured real criteria and blurred distinctions in this context of Middle Corinthian. With the proviso that they are not labels, I would emphasize the boldness and sobriety of the formal design and drawing in this phase of the Chimaera Group's development. Developments Contemporary with the Chimaera Painter's Late Work The plates X34 and L5 (as well as L6) should be contemporary and later than the foregoing. At this point, if not before (if L3 is not earlier), both of the major artists were decorating plates, at a date which (if we respect Payne's placement of X39,168 a vase that is late in but not at the end of MC) will not be later than ca. 580 B.C. L5 preserves only the floor of a smallish plate, about the same size as X34, whose profile, with the rim strongly bent back and very hollow on the underside (cf. X38, and see p. 103 below), must be relatively late in MC. The attribution of X34 as certainly by the Chimaera Painter has been reviewed (pp. 61-62 above); the influence of the Painter of Louvre E 574, especially of his taste, can be admitted at this date, comparing L5 with X34 and in the light of the relationship of X29 to L7. The Boread on X34 is less vigorous and more carefully disposed in the tondo than those on X31-X33; the design is tightened up. The comparison with the Gorgon in the Corfu pediment,'69 with similar proportions and self-containment, suits only this one Boread by the Chimaera Painter. Those on X26 and X31-X33 are not trim enough, and the one on X39 (PI. 47:d) is too long limbed and loose-jointed, too naturalistic.170 The suggestion that his companion's personal taste, not Zeitgeist alone, affected the design of X34 is borne out by borrowed details, zigzags across the shoulders of the Chimaera Painter's Boread on X34, a meandering line in the same position on his companion's Typhon on L5. And they have used the same kind of beard (originally the Chimaera Painter's), but the one with straight and separated, the other with curved and contiguous locks. From now on, the majority of the Painter of Louvre E 574's work also will be on plates. 167 "Heavy style" was once used, not recently, by D. A. Amyx ("Corinthian Vases in the Hearst Collection at San Simeon," in University of California Publications in Classical Antiquiy 1, 1943 [pp. 207-232], pp. 217- 218); "majestic" isJ. L. Benson's (1956, p. 225, is its first appearance in English); I myself harped on "monumentality" and, incidentally, used the word imprecisely (1959, p. 349). Such tags tend to be quoted as if they had real meaning, then elevated to the status of specious "stylistic" properties or categories. 168 "Ca. 580-570", Necrocorinthia, p. 307, II, and at NC 892. 169 One good photograph is that in R.

The evolved type of griffin head on the derivative bowl P2 (P1. 53) also argues against clustering all the bowls around the date of X18. The fragments of larger lekanoid bowls (Q1 being larger than any of the early Attic lekanai from Anagyrous 171) should be no earlier. P1 has an elaborate panther mask. The animal friezes on Q1 (Pls. 54, 55) are unlikely to be either as late as those on X39 (Pls. 46-48) or contemporary with X26; they fall between the middle and late years of Middle Corinthian. The Boread or Potnia on Q1, with a long torso and hair in tresses (however they terminated), should not be earlier than X34 and L5.'72 Tentatively, the Riehen Painter's plate, R5, may be placed here. The drawing is a little freer than on R3 but much more disciplined than on R6, where the lions provide evidence of lateness. The profile of the plate,'73 with a level rim, need not be much later than X28; the inner foot molding is reduced but by no means as on L14. The treatment of the remarkable subject matter is so straightforward and unadorned that there is little to compare developmentally with more conventional work. The forelegs of the lions on X37 have Chimaera Group markings modified-no longer boxed and with discontinuous lines suggesting muscles and sinews-in the direction of naturalism. The same is true, in spite of their highly formal treatment, of the forelegs of the sphinxes and pantheresses on Lii and L12. The rim profile of X37 is strongly curved in section, though less extremely than those of X34 and X38. Most instructive in trying to grasp the change in Greek art that has come about between the dates of early MC and late MC, the date of this plate (already in the 570's?) is a comparison of X37 with X9. On X37, the right-hand lion is raised, which implies that he occupies real space behind the other; the crossed tails are no longer twisted (as if the artist had reflected that twisting was not only spatially impossible but physically painful) and, relative to the suspension holes in the rim, are no longer exactly vertical or exactly centered but lie in the left-hand half of the circle; the lion's topknot is no longer exaggerated, and the cavity of the mouth is small. If the drawing of the forelegs, at right, is confusing, it is because one leg is shown behind the other; so also with the jumbled hindquarters at the bottom. We can hardly doubt from what remains of each that X9 gave a more legible pattern and that by the date of X37 representation of what one sees and knows empirically had priority over a telling pattern. These two plates, like the horse-protomai plates, even if ancient craftsmen had nothing like pattern books, assure us that models existed in their practice, whether they sketched on the workplace walls, kept some of their products, simply remembered and could reproduce designs on demand-or all three variably. X38 is placed with X37 because its rim is most extremely curved in section and all that remains of the lion's legs resembles those on X37; their position shows that this lion was another traditional type, 171 Papaspyridi-Karouzou 1963, pp. 15-35; the diameters range from 0.305 m. to 0.325 m., except for the Panther Painter's Athens, N.M. 16356, D. 0.375 m. 172 U3, Rodin TC 899, to judge by the character of the shape and its sepaled palmettes, is probably to be placed here, but judgment is difficult without closer comparanda. 173 The plate is remarkably warped, but the character of the profile is not affected.</page><page sequence="43">96 PATRICIA LAWRENCE posed like the early chimaera on X6. The broad bands on the back are all black, as on X9 and X30 (the choice of somber banding has no chronological significance). Of all the Painter of Louvre E 574's work on closed vases, L8 and L9 most nearly approximate the manner of the famous plates Lii and L12. The forelegs are not longer than on Li but much straighter. The lions on L8 have their tails tucked into the haunch, as on L9, not crossed at the back of the vase. Comparison of L9 with L7 will make clearer than words can why the latter aryballos rather than L9 is aligned with X28 and X29. L8 and L9 represent a new departure; the fully mature style of the Painter of Louvre E 574 is a formal style, towards which this work is one stage. The Rhodes aryballos, U2, might be placed slightly earlier but for a striking trait that it shares with the Chimaera Painter's last work, on X37 and X39; the same trait occurs on R6. This is the enclosure of a lion's face with a wavy line. Until the Bonn pyxis, X39, could be studied closely, its dating had to rely on the molded heads, although the goat in one photograph looked very late. The chimaera and both lions on X39 (P1. 48:a, c, d), small as they are, have the wavy line around the face. The sphinxes have hair in tresses terminating in a rounded tip, as on the Copenhagen sphinxes, Lli, or the siren on L9. The long-legged Boread leans and moves to the right, breaking the pinwheel design that still sufficed to indicate motion on X34. Every other stroke or configuration in all these creatures is what the Chimaera Painter has drawn all his life (Pls. 47:b-d, 48), but in the lower frieze (Pls. 46:b, 47:a) the panthers depart from any known model within the Chimaera Group; the goats are a logical development of those on X26, with larger bodies and spindlier legs, characteristic of this date. 174 This pyxis is probably the latest surviving work by the Chimaera Painter (although there is nothing to prove that X37 and X38 are not as late). Payne's date for the pyxis, in the 570's, cannot be far wrong.175 The Chimaera Painter will have worked for about a quarter century. An identical chronology for Sophilos, obtained by Guven Bakir,176 is confirmed by and confirms the Chimaera Painter's, for both chronologies draw their evidence from both the potters' work and the painters', they were obtained independently, and both artists with their groups show the same development from exactly the end of Early Archaic through a period which is probably most of the first quarter of the 6th century. The Painter of Louvre E 574 at the Beginning of Late Corinthian The Copenhagen plates, Lii and L12, have profiles which must be quite late.177 Their independence oftraditional Chimaera Group practice (they abjure the use of rosettes 174 The near self-parody of some of the Geladakis Painter's animals at this date (e.g., JNecrocorinthia, pI. 29:8; Amyx, "The Geladakis Painter," Hesperia 25, 1956, pl. 28:b, c; Amyx 1971, pls. 11: 1, 12:2) is only an extreme example. 175 K. Wallenstein (Korinthische Plastik des 7. und 6. Jahrhunderts vor Christus, Bonn 1971, p. 49 [and note 172], p. 115, no. IV/A 14, pl. 9:3, 6) places it at 585/575 B.C., among "gesicherte Werke"-that is, he follows Payne for the relative date of both the plastic heads and the vase painting. He justly takes me to task (p. 176, note 172) for failing to distinguish chronologically the heads on X26 and X39. The pyxis Getty 88.AE. 105 (Neeft 1991, p. 50, AP-0) also has interesting heads, but it is not, in my opinion, by the Chimaera Painter. 176 G. Bakir 1981, p. 59. 177 Callipolitis-Feytmans 1962, p. 134; I would argue only that her CM 62 and CM 67 (X2 and Xli; p. 99, note 190, and p. 102 below) are different from the Copenhagen plates, her CM 63 and CM 64.</page><page sequence="44">THE CHIMAERA GROUP AT CORINTH 97 but use rays on the rim and seem to adopt designs alien to vase painting) might even suggest that the Painter of Louvre E 574 was at last free to follow his own bent in decorating plates, that so long as the Chimaera Painter was engaged in that work the younger master was somehow constrained by the practice of the elder (X34 and L5 are very much the same kind of plate, and X24 was probably a compositional prototype for L5 and L6). Besides, in terms of the Painter of Louvre E 574's own stylistic development, Lii and L12 seem later than L8 and L9, and the komast on the bottom of L12 can hardly be earlier than those on the Samos Painter's kotyle in Copenhagen.'78 The Syracuse plate with a siren, L10, although comparable in design with X30 and stylistically especially close to L7, cannot be much earlier than Lii, since the siren's hair and headbands are not matched in work earlier than its sphinxes. The same typological criteria make an earlier date unlikely for the fragment S5, and the palmette chain on S6 so closely corresponds to that on the lid of X39 as to confirm that the beard in separate rippling locks on the other side of the fragment also belongs to this time (S4 preserves too little for interpretation). The fragment by the Painter of Athens 931, SlO, may also be placed here, less because any of the traits that it preserves must be so late than because the comparanda on which the attribution rests179 belong to the end of MC, to the post-Dodwell Painter phase of its artist's career. The Perachora floral plate, L13, does not have rays on the rim but is described as hav- ing a profile comparable with that of Li 1 and incision "resembling incised metalwork." 180 The rosettes "with double incised centres" in the field around the man and dog on the bottom are paralleled on L15. Thus, unless L3 had none, Lii and L12 are the only figured plates in the Group altogether without filling ornament. Hopper's description also makes it plain that added red was amply applied (cf. the floral ornament on L8) and that the plate is beautifully finished, like LIi and L12. The "band overlaid with red" on the rim "at its junction with the horizontal portion" recurs on L14 (but on no plate by the Chimaera Painter), where L1 1 and L12 have three narrow lines, the outer two with added red. This is the taste of fine work at the outset of Late Corinthian. The Munich horse-protomai plate, L14, has the latest-looking profile among Chi- maera Group plates; the published drawing,'81 which looks extreme, actually softens the bend in the rim. Its banding also introduces striking novelties. The pairs of very fine lines in glaze-paint, as fine as in Protocorinthian work, on the face of the rim inside the groove and just before it bends to meet the floor of the plate, and on the floor coinciding with the four nail holes,182 are unique in the Group. Still more remarkable is the total 178 N.M. Chr. VIII 872; Payne's NC 952; Seeberg 1971, p. 38, no. 203; CorVP, p. 190, A 3; Lawrence 1984, pp. 59-64, pl. 21.

The same relative, but a lower absolute, date is given by Krantz and Lullies, CVA, Kassel 2 [Germany 38], pp. 11-23, pis. 49-57 [1849-1857]. 179 The Demeter Malophoros fragment, S10, is CorVP, p. 212, A 18; the best comparanda from Amyx's list for this painter are A 15 (Agrigento S. 2215) and A 16 bis (Ascona Market; later Basel Market), both large bowls which seem to have been inspired by such as Q1 and Q2. 180 R.J.

I agree. Both the reduced moldings and the minimal treatment of the underside (here truly the back of the plate) were a response to its intended special(?) use.</page><page sequence="45">98 PATRICIA LAWRENCE absence of black underpainting on the back of the plate: not only the two bands (scant pattern) and the foot moldings but the underside of the rim molding (its upper half does have glaze-paint under the red) are in red applied directly to the clay. Yet the face of L14 is very carefully banded; it is the differentiation that is novel. The timeworn comparison with the horses of the Francois Vase-all of them-is as valuable as ever; they must be contemporary. The Late Corinthian horses by artists like the Dionysios Painter,183 and their Attic comparanda, are clearly later; the majority (but not all) of the horses on Middle Corinthian cups and on kraters not in the red-ground technique seem discernibly less advanced.184 Therefore, this plate and the next are placed ca. 570 B.C. The difference between these horses and those on X2 is practically equivalent to the gulf between the Nessos Painter's or the Panther Painter's horse protomai and Kleitias's horses.185 By a date which brings us to the earliest kouroi in Richter's Tenea-Volomandra Group,186 the horse protomai on L14 are drawn so as to suggest solid, plastic forms, even muscles under skin; they hold their heads so that they seem to nod at each other, and their raised forelegs are those of creatures that prance. Only the traditional compositional scheme (and this may be its last appearance in mainland Greek art) is Early Archaic. The long-limbed Herakles on the Argos plate, L15, does not look earlier. The plates are hard to compare because L15, although a masterpiece, is a small plate, L14 a large one; they seem to be by different potters, too, and L15 has its own innovative peculiarity, the red and black banding that covers the face of the rim.187 The type of the eagle on the bottom of L15 confirms the suggestion that Attic and Corinthian flying eagles are related,188 but it seems unlikely that the type in question was native to Corinth. The KX Painter had magnificent and more closely similar prototypes in his own tradition.189 The relative chronology has still to be studied adequately, but 183 W E.

The really difficult question is the relative date of the Volomandra kouros (ibid., no. 63) himself, within a span estimated as ca. 570-550 B.C. 187 The band on the underside of the rim is paralleled on a fragment at Corinth, U5, which may be thought to have belonged to a late plate by the Painter of Louvre E 574 because it is very finely finished, has rays on the face of the rim, like Lli and Li2, and in profile looks like a slightly earlier (strongly curved, rather than bent) version of L14. 188 Schefold 1960, no.

Is the venerable design motif accountable for the profuse rosettes? After all, the same artist on L14 kept the central rosette that was traditional between the heads of horse protomai.190 The style of drawing, of course, is consistent with the date required by the profile face and bodily proportions of Herakles on the face of the plate. The bird, the snake, and the Triton all are adorned with the same very neat, elongated scales as on L5 and LIi. The fragments of a Poseidon plaque from Penteskouphia, L16, are so similar to the Argos Herakles that they must date from the same time, even allowing that part of their likeness resides in the dignity deemed appropriate both to the hero and to the god. Latest surely is L17, the Gela Typhon aryballos, a LC vase, weak but undeniably by the Painter of Louvre E 574. This pot does not belong with the Chimaera Group aryballoi, its attribution notwithstanding. Contemporaneously, the Laurion Painter191 was producing alabastra and aryballoi that presuppose the tradition of the Chimaera Group, but the Group as a working association no longer existed. No further original and germinal developments come from their tradition. Neither master was still active, and no succession such as gave continuity in Athens from Euthymides and Phintias to the Phiale Painter, through the Berlin Painter and his pupils, seems to have been provided for in Corinthian workshops. DEVELOPMENTAL CRITERIA FOR THE CHRONOLOGY OF CHImAERA GROUP PLATE PROFILES In her fundamental article of 1962, Callipolitis-Feytmans agreed specifically with two of my chronological placements published three years earlier. 192 The New York plate, X6, has a profile that places it at the beginning of Middle Corinthian, and the Mykonos plate, X37, is late Chimaera Painter and well on in the evolution of plates in the Group. Both of these opinions are fully confirmed now. She did not, however, distinguish sharply between X28 and X7 (her CM 52 and CM 53). We agree that X30 and K2 fall somewhere in the middle of MC and that L12 and L14 are contemporary with the beginning of LC. In other words, the outlines of development, as Rafn made clear,193 are not in question. It was, in fact, Callipolitis-Feytmans's work that prompted reexamination of the evolution of the several artists' black-figure styles, this time with twice as much material available to provide criteria and with the profiles and banding of the plates taken together with their figural decoration. All the evidence had to be considered at once. With the present results, conflicts can be resolved and, within the Chimaera Group, finer criteria for relative dating of profiles proposed. The early X6 is the largest plate in the Group, but others of the clearly early plates are also much larger than average, more than 28 centimeters in diameter (X4, X10, X16). 190 Papaspyridi-Karouzou 1963, no. 16366, pls. 36-38; no. 16361, pl. 67.

The Chimaera Group: profiles and banding (where preserved)</page><page sequence="49">102 PATRICIA LAWRENCE These large, early plates are rather heavy, and they have wide rims; they need them, lest on a large plate the rim seem small relative to its tondo. The widest, heaviest rims are on X6 and X2; the latter is the second largest and the heaviest of Chimaera Group plates. X4 and X6 guarantee that the large, heavy plates are early. Two of them, X2 and X4, have minimal moldings on the edge of the rim. Smaller early plates, X1, X7, X9, have narrower rims but otherwise are similar: (a) Early MC plates have slanting rims, that is, high clearance; the underside of the rim molding is much farther from the tabletop than the floor of the inside of the plate. (b) The rim is thick at the root to cover both of the foot moldings on the underside entirely (X1, X1 1), to nearly cover both, or to cover at least half of the inner molding (X7, X9, X16). (c) The foot moldings are not yet evolved to virtual half-round moldings (contrast K2194); they are usually rounded but not in strong relief Two plates, X9 and X10, have a thick-rooted rim trimmed back at the edge of the tondo; the result is a sharp vertical offset, perhaps transitional to a lighter rim. The Berkeley floral plate, X1 1, is large but incompetently turned. It resembles not L14 (contrast the rim moldings) but the tiny plate V2-remarkably, considering the 1 0-centimeter difference in their diameters.195 It could be the work of the same potter (or trimmer). Note that it has a slanting rim (high clearance) without resembling the (quite unrelated) profiles in the later Stavros Group.'96 In any case, we have shown above why the floral cross on X11 cannot be pushed very far into the 6th century.197 One of the foregoing, X10, otherwise like X9, has a more nearly level rim. In the period that may be called "still fairly early in MC", the slant of the rim is not consistent and at the root it covers about half of the inner foot molding. The rim and foot moldings are better rounded. The Vienna plate, X28, is the classic mid-MC Chimaera Group profile. X22, X30, K1, and K2 (the profile of K3 is not published) have approximately contemporary profiles; R5 is surely no earlier. This profile has developed from the type of X9 and X10. (a) The rim is level; on well made plates like X28 and K2, the floor of the inside of the plate is about the same distance from the tabletop as the underside of the rim molding. (b) The rim may still cover more than the outer molding (X28) but typically only a little more (K1, K2). (c) The moldings are well defined half-rounds. (d) Although the over- and underside of the rim are almost parallel in profile, there is no strong bend, no real hollowing out of the underside as on later plates; the rim is remarkably straight, usually level, still relatively heavy. 194 Callipolitis-Feytmans 1962, CM 57, p. 153.

These rims bend back, a late trait. 197 The other plate that Callipolitis-Feytmans places very late and I very early is X2, already discussed. It is simply unevolved, unspecialized. In hand, it is not at all like Lii and L12, which are large but very delicate, with the underside of the rim hollowed, with the rim not slanting (straight up and out) but bent back: beautiful late plates. X2, itself beautiful, is a great primitive hulk of a plate, like a slightly inexpert enlargement of X1. In X4 and X6, the large format has been mastered.</page><page sequence="50">THE CHIMAERA GROUP AT CORINTH 103 None of these plates is large; they average 26 centimeters in diameter.198 Remarkably, only early and late plates exceed 28 centimeters. X22 and X30 are small; the latter is slight in fabric with a slanting rim (high clearance), but its single foot molding is sharply defined, as on K2. The profile is very different from that of X1, which has the same diameter. I agree with Callipolitis-Feytmans in placing it at mid MC; the drawing matches X28 (see p. 91 above), and the potter's work is just rather peculiar. A Corinth fragment, U4, resembles it. The next stage is that of the Chimaera Painter's late plates, X34, X37, X38, and of the Painter of Louvre E 574's L6, which closely resembles X38. These plates also average 26 centimeters in diameter. (a) Instead of being level, the rim is curved, or arched, back, and since the over- and underside in profile are parallel, the underside is hollowed. The rim, therefore, may have very low clearance; on X38, the underside of the rim molding is nearer the tabletop than the interior floor of the plate is. (b) The root of the rim covers only the outer molding, and that barely. (c) The half-round moldings are still well defined, on X38 almost toruslike. The plates that are later than the Chimaera Painter's last work depart from the tradition implicit in the foregoing development. These are Lii, L12, L14, L15, U5, and M8. (a) When the rims have high clearance, they first rise well above the floor, then bend back; when they have low clearance (L14), the rims are bent back very abruptly. (b) The large plates, with diameters exceeding 28 centimeters, reappear and again have wide rims; in profile, these wide rims are the ones with the most extreme bend. (c) The smaller plates, L15, U5, are less extreme, but U5 has a remodeled rim molding, and, as on L14, its foot moldings are flattened and the inner one reduced. (d) A significant mark of lateness is the outer foot molding that rises so high on the exterior that it meets the underside of the rim at a point well above the surface of the plate's floor (always measuring from the tabletop). Contrast X2 (very early) with L12 and L14 (very late). The profile of the plate at the beginning of Late Corinthian is in process of radical remodeling. Callipolitis-Feytmans observed199 that the reduced foot moldings on L14, which has four nail holes on the perimeter of the tondo, would allow it to be secured more closely to the wall. Assuming that it was designed to be permanently affixed, its unique minimal banding on the bottom, without glaze-paint, is not to be interpreted as Late Corinthian "degeneracy". Whatever the special requirements for the extremely reduced moldings and banding on L14 (and its nail holes), these were not repeated on fully LC plates200 and cannot without reserve be regarded as developmentally significant.20' 198 Only K3, at Diam. 0.275 m., exceeds 27 centimeters. 199 Callipolitis-Feytmans 1962, CR 9, p. 157, fig. 20, followed in Corinth VII, ii, no. 212. 200 Note 182, p. 97 above. 201 Callipolitis-Feytmans 1962, p. 158, fig. 21.</page><page sequence="51">104 PATRICIA LAWRENCE DEFINITION OF THE CHIMAERA GROUP202 DESCRIPTION OF THE GROUP AS A WORKING ErNITY A clear idea of potters' workshops remains beyond our grasp. At least, it will require further excavation. There is strong evidence, however, that some artists worked very closely together. This is what Amyx and I meant when we called the Anaploga styles and the range of styles in the Potters' Quarter material "distinct segments" of the industry,203 together representing much less than the whole. At neither site is a pottery workshop properly preserved. At the Anaploga site, the construction of the Roman villa had removed any substantial earlier remains. At the Potters' Quarter (Fig. 3), the unmendable pottery from the Road Deposit (and at the south end of the southern part of the South Long Building) and from the North Dump accounts for many of the more significant black-figure styles. Wherever it came from, it was as a quantity of already mixed sherds that it was brought to be deposited. Some of it is misfired pottery, but unlike the almost wholly mendable potters' dump from the Anaploga Well, it evidently was not deposited direct from the workplace.204 Salmon's notion of the North Road Deposit's resulting from "casualties from the displays of wares for sale" is plainly untenable, while the speculation that follows is not merely "perhaps too fanciful" but altogether unrealistic.205 The North and South Long Buildings, as known, are little more than long west walls parallel to the Kypselid wall.206 Most of the Chimaera Group material is closely associated with the southern part of the South Long Building.207 See 202 A question can be raised concerning the criteria for including a plate in the Chimaera Group. X12 was excluded by Callipolitis-Feytmans (1962, p. 152, CM 34, and p. 164), evidently because its profile is unknown, even though its decoration is by the same hand as Xli. Xli was included in the Chimaera Group on the strength of its decoration (already assigned to the Chimaera Group by H. R. W. Smith, CVA, Berkeley 1 [U.S.A. 5], p. 17), although its profile is as crude as those of the Carrousel Painter's little plates, which were excluded. A plate from the Artemision, Thasos, is illustrated in profile (Callipolitis-Feytmans 1962, p. 151, fig. 16, p. 152, CM 31-32 and note 1) and listed in the same classe as X12, exemplaires isolies, depuis ke milieu du corinthien moyen. The tondo subject is a palmette-lotus cross, which I have not seen, but the profile seems to me to resemble those of X1 and X6 so closely (while the banding on the bottom, so far as preserved, is the broad bands of X9, Xli, X19, X22, X28, X30, K2, X38) that, first, unless the style of the palmette-and-lotus cross is alien, the Thasos Artemision plate should belong to the Chimaera Group (perhaps even, like X1 and X1 1-X14, to the Painter, or to some hand like the Painter of Gela G. 9, although he, so far, has no plates with broad bands on the bottom) and, second, it is not later MC but rather no later than plates like X9, X10, and X16, possibly earlier; its rim molding is like that on X1, whose early placement is confirmed by its almost EC-looking lotus and palmetto. 203 Corinth VII, ii, p. 69. 204 In the Northwest Angle Deposit and Well I, some shapes, especially kotylai, were mendable but others not. 205 Salmon 1984, p. 102. 206 Williams 1982, pp. 17-18, fig. 3. 207 "Trench F' included Wall E, the south end-wall of that building, and an area south of its south end; "Wall A' designated the southern stretch of the South Long Building's western wall; "Outside Wall A' is practically equivalent to the southern end of the South Road Deposit.

Besides, M6 probably belongs with these, because this is material that slid downhill when sections of the wall fell into the ravine. Most of the rest is from the North Dump: X1, L6, G1, G3, P2, M5, M7. The bowl M4 is half from the North Dump, half from the East Deposit, as the crow flies, more than 150 meters apart. The East Deposit may also be represented by Q2, which came from a lot tagged Tr. XXII and XXIV; the East Deposit lay at the east end of the latter. Finally, from all the pottery in Well I, only X14 and X21 belong to the Chimaera Group, and both are small fragments. M10, which is extremely marginal to the Group, came from the Rectangular South Pit. It is important to be careful in interpreting this distribution. It is probably safe to say, first, that all the material around the South Long Building came from one source, a very massive dump of broken pottery, and, second, that such a pile of dumped pottery probably indicates a cluster of potteries contributing to it (it does not belong to a single generation), and, third, that if pottery sherds to be used as road metal had not been available close by, something other than sherds would have been used instead. We may add that among the contributors were not only the Chimaera Group but other makers of plates (perhaps most of the makers of Corinthian plates) and makers of a large but limited range of other shapes and styles in no way specially related to the Chimaera Group. This means, as we found in the Anaploga Well, that specialists seem to have worked in clusters (including, in this case, makers of plates and bowls) but not systematically or exclusively. What the evidence does not either require or preclude is that they worked in the excavated area of the Potters' Quarter or, specifically, in the southwestern part of the South Long Building. If the pottery had been dumped directly from workshops inside Wall A, much, much more of it should have been mendable, and, as in the Terracotta Factory, we should expect some such pottery to have been found, no matter what the vicissitudes of the structure, within the building. We should also expect, if the full length of the Long Buildings had been potters' workplaces, gradually paving the way outside with their throwaways, that in the Road Deposits there would have been a succession of heavy concentrations of different shapes and styles as trench after trench (laid out west to east and working northward) moved up the walls and the road. Instead, the excavator found the material sufficiently uniform to be placed under a single rubric, remarking only208 that there was later pottery outside the North Building. In sum, the Potters' Quarter indicated that the Chimaera Group worked together at or very near that site. If they worked in the South Long Building, their primary dump was elsewhere than in the road (to which, in any case, Wall A preserved no doorways).209 length of the pottery-paved stretch between the Kypselid wall and the long buildings. See Figure 3; Corinth XV, i, pp. 15-20, pl. 51; Corinth XV, iii, pp. 4-8 and Plan of Deposits. The terminology, as in every excavation, developed as walls became buildings and areas were interpreted. The term "Road Deposit" does not occur in the field notebooks. "Wall A', "Trench F", "Wall E" come first; the "South Building" becomes "Long" only as excavation revealed a wall that seemed to continue Wall A. The densely packed pottery between the Kypselid wall and the two Long Buildings became "Road Deposit" only when the excavation could be interpreted as a whole. 208 Corinth XV, i, p. 21; XVx iii, p. 6. 209 Williams 1982, pp. 17-18.</page><page sequence="54">THE CHIMAERA GROUP AT CORINTH 107 The presence of water channels and the clay floor suitable for wedging clay210 do suggest that this structure, like the Terracotta Factory later, may have been at once residential and industrial,211 but we simply do not know the Long Buildings beyond the depth of a single room, and that rather poorly preserved. It is interesting that the only hands in the Group not represented anywhere around the South Building or in the North Dump are the Riehen Painter and the Carrousel Painter, but, again, the excavation was too restricted to allow much emphasis to be placed on the fact. After all, the Painter of Louvre E 574 is represented only by L6. On the other hand, the consistent contextual association with his work of lekanoid bowls, generically like X18, X21, X35, and X36 but not by the Chimaera Painter and much inferior (M3, M4, M6, M7), favored including the M list in the Group. If our notion of workshops is highly tentative, ideas concerning the economy of the industry and the r6le of export merchants are practically all speculative. Anyone looking for exploitative enterprise in antiquity can suggest that merchant entrepreneurs pushed potters to shoddy overproduction. The many secondary hands in Corinthian production could be seen as resulting from the exploitation of wives and children. Slavery can be urged by anyone convinced that the economy of Archaic tyrannies depended on it. There is no evidence to the contrary. The only solid evidence of any kind comes from the excavations of export sites (on Selinous and Tocra, see p. 81 above and note 92). Salmon212 is careful: "The colonists did not bring their taste for Corinthian with them.... The merchants must therefore have taken a deliberate decision to exploit the new market." The amount exported was very great. On the scale of an ancient economy, Corinth's pottery industry cannot have been unimportant, although work in more perishable, more valuable materials may have vied with it. We need not, however, and probably ought not to suppose that, because the industry was large by ancient standards, it had to be organized and overseen: by the tyrant, by merchant shippers, or by anyone else. Better models exist, describing the industrial economy of small to medium-sized urban centers. Where these thrive, there are hundreds of family-sized enterprises, some with a few employees and apprentices, exploiting local resources and providing the processed materials, component products, and finished products that the city's industries and trade require. The reciprocity of the small enterprises works organically but is not externally organized. That Corinth at the beginning of the 6th century had such an early urban (or small urban) industrial economy is speculative but accords well with both the unstructured early development of the city itself213 and with the likelihood that pottery workshops were scattered rather than concentrated only on the Potters' Quarter plateau. The discussion of the Chimaera Group that follows assumes as a working hypothesis this type of industrial economy, together with the evidence of the Potters' Quarter, as described. The evidence of emulative work and sustained quality suggests that artisans at 210 Corinth XV, i, pp. 16-17. 211 C. K. Williams ("The City of Corinth and Its Domestic Religion," Hesperia 50, 1981, pp. 408-421) makes clear that if it had not been a residence, it would not have contained stele shrines. 212 Salmon 1984, p. 112. 213 Salmon 1984, pp. 18-19.</page><page sequence="55">108 PATRICIA LAWRENCE the level of the Chimaera Group had a strong sense of the worth of their products and regarded themselves as artists, in a relatively modern sense of the word. At the outset, ca. 600 B.C., the Carrousel Painter and the Chimaera Painter may actually have worked together. Their animal-frieze work (V1-V4, X17) is related to the same kind of Early Corinthian pyxis,214 and both, however differently, worked on plates. Whether such a working relationship, if real, persisted depends on the attribution of the Tocra plates (pp. 81-82 above) to the Carrousel Painter and the importance we assign to the similarity of their profiles to those of plates by the Chimaera Painter. The Painter of Louvre E 574 would have to be deemed a major vase painter even if he had never come to work with the Chimaera Painter, and there is no sign that they did actually work together until after both their personal styles were well formed. The Chimaera Painter's initial choice of lion types based primarily on those of the Columbus Painter, ultimately on the Painter of Palermo 489, however, shows that, long before there is any evidence of their close association, he admired the tradition in which the Painter of Louvre E 574 was formed. We cannot suggest that the Chimaera Painter was also actually a pupil of the Columbus Painter, because we have no alabastron from his hand, and even his earliest lions, as on X4, require no closer contact than appreciative familiarity with the older artist's work, while his relationship to pyxis painters and his obvious interest in Attic work are alien to the Columbus Painter's tradition. It is difficult to avoid forming an idea of the young Chimaera Painter as a precocious, self-confident, inquisitive youth, generously endowed with native ability. I do not suppose that he and the Painter of Louvre E 574 were at any point unaware of each other's work; it may be taken for granted, I think, that every competent member of the industry knew what the others produced, regarding with professional interest anything novel or particularly attractive. This is why influence, as such, in the form of borrowed motifs, does not require the inclusion of the magpies in the Group; borrowed sawtooth ruffs on X18 and X19 do not necessarily mean that a working relationship was already established between the Painter of Louvre E 574 and the Chimaera Painter; the working relationship becomes a virtual certainty only when the former begins working on plates (L5 and L6, unless L3 is earlier) and the latter produces an aryballos like X29. Both X21 and X25 show nothing derived from the Painter of Louvre E 574, who inherited no panther type from the Columbus Painter (who did none); the Chimaera Group's panther face is the Chimaera Painter's design, and its earliest known occurrence is on X21.215 214 CorVP, p. 166, B 1. Another EC pyxis, Manchester III C 58 (Salmon 1984, p. 39; CorVP, p. 315, B 1 bis), also might stand behind both early Dodwellian pyxides and those by the Chimaera Painter and the early plates by the Carrousel Painter. 215 Benson (Corinth XV, iii, p. 156, at no. 796, note 1) seems to think the contrary; this is simply incorrect. In any case, the painter's "honor" (any artist's dignity) does not depend on "being first". Elsewhere ("The Populonia Painter," AJA 68, 1964, p. 172) he has written in a way that suggests zeal for the Painter of Louvre E 574. I hope to have shown throughout the present study that neither artist stands in any need of our zeal. It is simply a fact, even if one prefers the equally excellent Painter of Louvre E 574, that certain types, and among them the kind of plate that defines the Group, are proper instead to the Chimaera Painter. On some panthers in the Chimaera Group, including those on R4, G2, and X39, half-moon markings are used on the cheeks. These are common on flat-bottomed aryballoi and are only occasionally borrowed on work that belongs to the Chimaera Group.</page><page sequence="56">THE CHIMAERA GROUP AT CORINTH 109 If it is work on plates that defines the Chimaera Group, it is its production of flat- bottomed aryballoi that testifies to greater cohesiveness than the foregoing suggests. The Riehen Painter is the only hand to which they are proper; the Chimaera Painter has no ties with late EC aryballos specialists; the Columbus Painter and his predecessors did none. The Riehen Painter's stylistic dependence on the major hands, persistent as it is, might not suffice to make him a member of the Group (rather, a hanger-on), if the Chimaera Painter and his floral assistant, the Painter of Gela G. 9, and the Painter of Louvre E 574 had not taken to decorating aryballoi themselves: L7 and L9, in fact, are probably the finest flat-bottomed aryballoi ever made. Taken together, these facts show that the aryballoi and the Riehen Painter are integral to the Group. It is not surprising that they influenced other MC aryballoi; by the standards of aryballos painters, even the Riehen Painter looks distinguished. Perhaps the discovery of additional aryballoi, especially if they were rather early, would clarify the position of the Riehen Painter in the Chimaera Group. As it is, R1 seems to depend on early plates like X4, R2 on alabastra like L1, and the aryballoi by the major artists seem to represent their response to the Riehen Painter's successful adaptation of their felines to this other vase shape. The Chimaera Painter, who used rosettes on his plates, transferred them to his aryballoi; the Painter of Louvre E 574, who did not use them on Ll,216 retained a void field on the aryballoi. The evidence, so far as it goes, suggests that each plate painter also did all the subsidiary banding on his own plates. It is quite likely that they also usually made their own.217 The plates by the Riehen Painter and the Painter of Louvre E 574 are themselves different from those attributed to the Chimaera Painter. Plates are not difficult to throw; the quality of the profile depends at least equally on the turning (trimming on the wheel) of the plate when it is leather hard. Besides, as soon as leather-hard pottery has been turned and smoothed, it is ready for glaze-paint and incision;218 the banding on one side will be applied while the plate (centered on the wheel for turning and smoothing) is still in position. The natural (economical) procedure is to smooth the newly turned surface, then (a) apply all glaze-paint, both for banding and figure work, (b) execute incision, and (c) apply all added red, both in figure work and on banding; the time required for incision usually would be sufficient for the glaze-paint to have dried to the point that the red could be laid over it.219 I should not insist that the ancient craftsmen adhered consistently to the most efficient procedures, and very likely there were assistants and apprentices, but both the degree of consistency in the plates themselves and considerations of efficiency in manufacture suggest that the vase painters at least usually turned and banded the plates that bear their figure work.220 216 The Painter of Louvre E 574 did not get his taste for rosette-free grounds from the Columbus Painter. This taste may have become popular among several vase painters at the moment when we saw void fields also on work like X7 and (nearly void) V3 and V4, in artists who, before and after, liked rosettes. 217 We saw that the similar turning and patterns on the underside strengthen the possibility that K1-K5 are actually the Chimaera Painter's own. 218 The surprisingly ragged incised line on L3 could be due, simply, to the plate's having become too nearly dry before the incised work was executed. 219 The Copenhagen plates, Lii and L12, were closely studied in this connection and confirm the sequence; so does U9. 220 These remarks also apply to the bowls, and certainly vase painters could roll out their own clay plaques.</page><page sequence="57">110 PATRICIA LAWRENCE It is less obvious that flat-bottomed aryballoi were made by their painters. Not everyone can learn to throw narrow-necked globular pots; here, turning applies mostly to the foot of the vase, since a wall of the proper thickness must be produced directly by skill at the wheel from the soft, wet clay. If in ancient Corinth ceramicists were generally expected to make the vases they decorated, and training was geared to that expectation, then a man like the Riehen Painter could become an aryballos specialist through possessing that knack, and his association with the Chimaera Painter and the Painter of Louvre E 574 would make his specialty available to them. At present, it is much less safe to conclude that the aryballoi and plates were made in the same shop. The absence of the Riehen Painter from the Potters' Quarter material might not be accidental negative evidence. We cannot assume that workshop equals group. Artists could be closely associated for a couple of decades otherwise than by their workplace: they could be related as kin or by marriage; they could be close friends; their premises could be adjacent. If it is shape specialization that is linked with the physical workplace, the Chimaera Group's plates, bowls, and votive plaques represent one shop (as their distribution in the Potters' Quarter also suggested) and the aryballoi another. This hypothesis also provides the most plausible explanation for the Painter of Louvre E 574's continued work on alabastra (L8) and the Chimaera Painter's on pyxides (X26, X39) at the time in their careers when their principal association was with each other and both were working on plates as well as aryballoi. We saw that the Chimaera Painter's early link with the Carrousel Painter suggests his having come out of a late EC pyxis workshop, very possibly the same that formed the young Dodwell Painter, even though the Chimaera Painter's personal attrait was to Attic grandeur and, the closest thing to it in EC Corinth, the Columbus Painter's lions; his occasional pyxides, then, were made in that shop, or its succession. Similarly, the occasional later alabastra by the Painter of Louvre E 574 would be products of the alabastron shop where the Columbus Painter worked. Pyxides are quite alien to the plates, and in Middle Corinthian, alabastra and aryballoi evidently were not usually allied. The Columbus Painter, the Populonia Painter, and the Erlenmeyer Painter, for example, are "alabastron styles"; the Riehen Painter and the Otterlo Painter are "aryballos styles".22' If these ideas are viable, then it is very likely that the Painter of Louvre E 574's initial association in the Chimaera Group was with the Riehen Painter in the production of flat-bottomed aryballoi and that his exceptional ability and the evidently increasingly close association of these aryballos makers with the Chimaera Painter's plate-and-bowl shop drew him eventually into plate production. The Painter of Gela G. 9, on the other hand, seems to be merely an assistant to the Chimaera Painter. It is obvious that speaking of an aryballos shop perhaps "next door to" a plate-and- bowl shop not only goes beyond the evidence but is no more than a way of imagining what an abstract "close relationship" might have been in reality. Converting abstractions 221 CorVP pp. 85-86 (Columbus Painter), 160-162 (Erlenmeyer Painter), 162-163 (Populonia Painter), 172 (Riehen Painter), 177-180 (Otterlo Painter: 50 aryballoi, 5 alabastra). I do not include the Taucheira Painter (p. 89: two alabastra) and the Painter of Berlin F 1090 (pp. 175-177) in this list, since I have proposed that they are the same hand; all the flat-bottomed aryballoi, however, are in the Painter of Berlin F 1090 list (MC).</page><page sequence="58">THE CHIMAERA GROUP AT CORINTH 111 into concrete terms, however, is a most useful check on the validity of one's ideas, even when the concrete realities have to be contrived from knowledge of modern potteries and other artisan shops, both in Greece and abroad, and include social and psychological assumptions derived from modern rather than ancient Greeks. "Relationships", "ideas", and "influences" did not spread like viruses. Every development, every difference or similarity that we see, resulted from the opportunities and exigencies of that time and place, from the abilities and tempers and health, from the friendships and competition of the craftsmen. Concretely, the Otterlo Painter's relationship to the aryballoi of the Chimaera Group may have involved brief actual association222 but more probably competitive emulation, because his aryballoi seem to be by a different potter (again, himself?), and the short strokes among the petals on the shoulder are alien. Benson himself says that he "cannot be called a full-fledged member of the Group," his "independent" mind makes him "an associate who stayed somewhat on the periphery," his filling ornament is far less conservative than theirs, and, in his most characteristic floral patterns, "there is really nothing ... to recall the Chimaera Group as such."223 My purpose here is to demand that by "Group" we mean something concrete, evidence that several hands really worked together regularly for a prolonged period, in such a way that we speak not of their influencing each other but of shared habits. Now, the Otterlo Painter does not share the stylistic habits, the repertory of motifs, or, aryballoi apart, the repertory of shapes of the Chimaera Group.224 These criteria exclude the Erlenmeyer Painter225 still more drastically. If we speak of groups without such criteria in mind, not only will the art-historical concept of the Group lack weight and definition but also a historically false notion of the size and composition of working groups, as economic entities, will be propagated. Conversely, unrealistically rigid criteria will produce a fragmented picture, equally false. WORK TO BE EXCLUDED FROM THE CHIMAERA GROUP A great quantity of pottery that can be compared with the Chimaera Group, some of which was influenced by it, does not belong to it, if we understand "group" realistically.226 222 Note the spiral topknot and non-Chimaeroid structure of the sphinx (and, for that matter, the eagles) on the Riehen Painter's R3, besides the half-moon marks on the cheeks on R4. It is very obvious, however, that not only is the Otterlo Painter's floral work independent of the Chimaera Group but so also is his vigorous and amusing human anatomy. 223 Yet Benson's article (1971, pp. 13-24, pls. 1-5; the phrases quoted are from pp. 20-22) is entitled, 'A Floral Master of the Chimaera Group: The Otterlo Painter," and elsewhere in the article he speaks of this hand as part of the Chimaera Group. The possibility of "cross-influence with the Chimaera Painter himself" suggested by Benson on p. 21 is delusory because he attributed Gela G. 9 (G2) to the Otterlo Painter and his remarks depend on that piece. I accept the same attributions to the Otterlo Painter as Amyx (CorVP, pp. 177-180). 224 Later, at the date to which R6 is assigned, one of the aryballoi that Benson (1971, p. 18, pl. 5:8, 9) assigned to the Galera Painter exhibits late traits borrowed from the Chimaera Painter or Riehen Painter. 225 CorVP, pp. 160-162; Benson 1964, pp. 72-81, pls. 22-25. CorVP, p. 160, A 8, the Yale alabastron (Benson, loc. cit., pl. 22, fig. 2), alone is, of course, inspired by Li or a replica of it. 226 See also M. Robertson's discussion of Beazley's terms, in Beazley Addenda, pp. xi-xviii. We may use the term when we are not certain that a single workshop, literally, is involved but when an enduring working relationship is implied.</page><page sequence="59">112 PATRICIA LAWRENCE Picture Plates If Payne had not included one of these, NC 1056,227 in his Chimaera Group, no one, probably, would have thought of including others. Some Chimaera Group plates have vertical (Lii, L12, L14) or metopelike (X28) compositions. The picture plates differ in technique, using outline, and composition, using narrative, even literary, subjects which, unlike Herakles and Triton, for example, are alien to the vase painter's repertory of motifs. Thus Corinth CP-2645 and a plate in Athens, National Museum, from Perachora228 are better compared with the Gorgoneion Group229 and with each other than with the Chimaera Group. Now, the Akropolis plate, Payne's NC 1056, is of the same kind. The plate in Paris, Cabinet des Medailles,230 which I have not seen, is clearly another such; it is even inscribed. Callipolitis-Feytmans, however, who saw it, observes that Chiron's tail is treated similarly to the lions' ruffs on X6 and X7,231 so that this plate, as she says, may be closer to the Chimaera Group than the Akropolis one, which, as Stillwell saw, really does resemble Corinth KP 2058.232 Competitive Plates and Bowls Not all excellent Boreads in the tondos of MC plates and bowls belong to the Chimaera Group. The fragment Corinth KP 1455 a,233 separated from X33, is a good example. The Boread is slightly smaller and much slenderer than theirs, and the plate itself was a little lighter. The Boread on Corinth KP 2114,234 which may be by the same hand, is in a bowl, a thinner-walled bowl than those of the Chimaera Group. By another fine hand, Corinth C-65-449235 has a long-bodied, long-skirted Boread, with a non-Chimaeroid border pattern on the hem. Its fabric also is wrong; the clay differs in texture, it is fired orangish throughout, and the glaze-paint looks different from that seen on Chimaera Group plates and bowls. Without either scales or a vertical band on the upper garment, its Boread not only differs in style and proportions from those of the Chimaera Group but is of a different type and, perhaps, later. Similarly, as Hopper saw,236 a Perachora Boread, related to all the foregoing, is very different from X31, and, although we now have a griffin, X15, by the Chimaera Painter, a slenderer one on a Perachora plate237 does not belong to the Group, because its filling ornament and proportions are wrong. 227 CorVP, p. 173, no. 5. 228 Corinth VII, ii, no. 152, p. 46, pl. 27; Perachora II, no. 1958, pp. 195-196, pl. 81. 229 CorVP, pp. 194-204. 230 CorV p. 173, no. 6. 231 Callipolitis-Feytmans 1962, p. 136, where her reference to my "p. 358" seems to be a misprint. Hatching in alternating directions is perhaps commoner for horses' tails than for lions' ruffs, where it is confined to early work of the Chimaera Painter, but before dismissing the Paris plate I should like to see it, since a very elaborate Penteskouphia plaque, AntDenk I, pl. 7:11, seems to be somehow related to the late plates and plaque of the Painter of Louvre E 574 (L 1-L16), although not by his hand. 232 Corinth XV, iii, no. 747, p. 147, pl. 104. 233 Ibid., no. 755a, pl. 35. 234 Ibid., no. 772, pl. 36. 235 CorVP, p. 173, no. 10; Corinth XVIII, i, no. 241. 236 Perachora II, no. 1962, p. 196, pl. 82. 237 Ibid., no. 1966, pl. 82.</page><page sequence="60">THE CHIMAERA GROUP AT CORINTH 113 Fine flying eagles, as on Corinth KP 2790,238 need not be referred to that on L15, even when, as on Corinth KP 2918239 and KN 47,240 they are feathered. Each of these has its own distinctive style, and all are drawn at a smaller scale than the eagle on L15. Corinth KP 2065, as Stillwell observed,241 does recall styles in the Chimaera Group, but this thin fragment, as she said, may come from a cup. Not even every lion in a tondo can be referred to the Chimaera Painter. Benson is right that Corinth KP 2059 "looks curiously un-Corinthian, especially in the incisions of the head," and its little siren does not really resemble that on Louvre E 574.242 When it comes to floral crosses in tondos, which, once introduced, were evidently a great success, the criteria for inclusion in the Chimaera Group must be especially strict. The fabric of the plate or bowl must be like theirs, and the structure of the floral design and its drawing must agree with theirs. There are borderline cases, by which I mean plates like S8 and S9. The plate and its banding are approximately right, though not very elegant, and the structure of the lotus cross is free of alien elements, but the drawing is mediocre (wretched, to be blunt). Much better work, which has been referred to the Chimaera Group, must be excluded categorically.243 Also to be excluded, as firmly as the Otterlo Painter whose floral designs Benson compares, are a bowl in Corinth, KP 2061,244 and a plate from Perachora.245 The bowl is too thin, the tondo is too large relative to its diameter, and the lotus cross is structurally non-Chimaeroid.246 The drawing is undisciplined. 238 Corinth XV, iii, no. 1321, pl. 55. Again, it is Stillwell who correctly identified the vase shape: it is not a plaque but a plate because on the bottom (in the center) it preserves a dot (D. about 0.015 m.) and 0.020 m. from it (at several points where the edges of dot and band both are clearly preserved) a broad concentric band (W. at least 0.012 m.; the outer edge of the paint is lost because the clay is soft, orange, and powdery). Concentric decoration applied when the plate was centered upside down on the wheel is conclusive evidence. Many fine plates are too well finished for turning marks to be seen, even in the brightest light and under magnification. 239 Fragment from the floor of a plate. From the Potters' Quarter, Northwest Angle Deposit. Max. p. dim. 0.062 m. Pale clay (Munsell 2.5Y 8/2). No paint remains. The fragment preserves part of a neatly feathered creature in black figure, but with reference to what seems to be an eagle's claw the feathers would be growing towards the head. The incision is painstaking but less sure-handed than on L14.

This little plate tondo, dating as it does to the very beginning of MC, like the earliest horse-protomai plate, U1, probably does have some relationship to the formative Attic elements in the early work of the Chimaera Painter; he may not have been quite alone. But examination of the fragment shows that the fabric is as unlike the Chimaera Group as the style. The little siren is purely Corinthian, but the lion is glaringly Atticizing, not only in his facial type but in his relationship to the tondo. Here it is not decorative principles alone (see p. 67 above) but an entire tondo motif that has been borrowed, and not adapted but copied. 243 Corinth KP 1435, Corinth XV, iii, no. 756, pp. 148-149, pls. 35, 116. 244 Ibid., no. 769, note 3, p. 151, pl. 36. 245 Perachora II, no. 1973, pl. 76. 246 The bowl (Corinth XV, iii, no. 769) is compared, for shape, with KP 1670, Q1, but surely only most generically, for one has an estimated diameter of 0.22 m., the other of 0.39 m. (at least), and they differ extremely in weight.</page><page sequence="61">114 PATRICIA LAWRENCE Marginal Plates and Bowls A number of pieces are, like the floral plate S8, borderline cases. The shape and syntax are approximately those of the Chimaera Group, but the drawing, at least as much as is preserved, is by other and usually less distinctive hands. The only bowl from early excavations at Corinth that might be identified as Payne's NC 1013 is M1,247 roughly finished and crudely drawn. The large human head in the bowl M3 recalls the large motifs in P1 and P2 and the head of the Potnia or Boread in Q1 but also may adumbrate that by the Painter of Athens 931.248 The style is less striking than any of these. The siren, wearing a polos, with spread wings in M4, similarly, is in the tondo of a bowl like X35 but is drawn by a nondescript hand. The bowl M6 preserves a motif and filling ornament that relate it directly to X35, but the incisions are gross, and the raised forepaw of the Painter of Athens 93 1's sphinx protome, again,249 warns us that not every raised paw and double-centered rosette need belong to a Chimaera Group feline. M7 likewise is a well made bowl preserving part of a feline in the tondo, but the rib and shoulder markings so far as preserved are not those of our artists. M2 looks like a real Chimaera Group plate, even though the feline back and haunch have strange markings. On the other hand, M8, a plate with a fine LC profile, developed well beyond those of Lii and L12, preserves a sickle wing, probably of a sphinx, which seems closely related to the Painter of Louvre E 574, as on Lii. Some relationship is undeniable between the remnants of the Dodwell Painter's Group and the remnants of the Chimaera Group during the upheavals in the Corinthian potteries (admittedly, a tempest in a teapot) that accompanied the transition to Late Corinthian styles. We have a plate, S10, and several bowls by the Painter of Athens 931 and now a newly inventoried bowl, KP 2922,250 which may well be by the Geladakis Painter.251 Much of these artists' late work shows a new taste for single animals displayed in a delimited field, as on panel amphoras, at this moment borrowed from Attica. The Chimaera Group's tondos provide a similar field. If bowls alone were involved, they could have been inspired directly by contemporary Attic lekanides, although Attic has nothing quite like Q1, but the plate S10 and the Dodwellian bowls together suggest a general shuffling of habits and allegiances among Corinthian vase painters at the end of MC. This is not to say that the later Dodwellians "became members of" the Chimaera Group. Everyone involved, in this case, was nearing his dotage, and the Chimaera Group itself was about to break up. Likewise, fragments of a plate and a bowl have drawing in a style related to the Otterlo Painter (M9, M10). The rim of the bowl is not preserved; the plate is the same size as many in the Chimaera Group, but the rim covers less than the outer foot molding. The lotus cross is built on spokes radiating from a small medallion with two rows of dicing, 247 Corinth VII, ii, no. 149, pI. 26. 248 CorVP, p. 321, A 16 bis. 249 Ibid. 250 Fragment from the wall of a lekanoid bowl.

See p. 146 below, 11. 251 The Painter of Athens 931, CorVP, pp. 211, 321, A 13-A 16 bis; the Geladakis Painter, ibid., pp. 213-218.</page><page sequence="62">THE CHIMAERA GROUP AT CORINTH 115 and the zigzag in the lotus flower is in its center, not in a band across it. These may be more closely related to bowls like Corinth KP 2061252 than to the Chimaera Group. The Selinous plate S3, and its companion S2, unless they prove to be late work by the Columbus Painter himself, stand in a similarly dubious relationship to the Chimaera Group. The complete plate has dicing on the rim and careless banding (by the standards of the Chimaera Group); both are roughly finished, with turning marks left even in the tondo on the face of the plate. The rings on the bottom of S2 and S3 differ from those in the Chimaera Group but match each other.253 The ruff and raised forepaw of the lion protomai are certain evidence of the Chimaera Painter's influence, but the nondescript filling ornament is as alien as the diced rim, and but for their style these plates would be "merely related". The style is closer to the Columbus Painter's than is his own pupil's. The lion protome has his lower jaw with a huge tooth. The lines in its crosshatched mane cross at the same angle as his. The shoulder is that of his late lions with a double line placed as he placed it. The topknot and ear look like his. The filling ornament, atypical for MC (and S2 and S3 certainly are MC plates, even fully developed ones), looks like the deterioration of his late EC filling ornament. Now, if these plates should represent the old Columbus Painter, their relationship to the Chimaera Group would be much more intricate, especially if they were as late as the period when the Painter of Louvre E 574, his pupil, and the Chimaera Painter, who also owed him much, were collaborating most closely. In their own right, however, S2 and S3 are rather plates influenced by the Chimaera Group than part of it. A small fragment of a plate at Corinth, M5, with part of a feline shoulder and foreleg joint, seems to be related to S2 and S3, but too little is preserved for certainty, and the bands preserved on the bottom do not match theirs. Isolated Pieces Among the aryballoi listed by Payne in the series NC 821-860A, one, NC 830, in the Fogg Museum, was early associated with U2, Rhodes 5175,254 which belongs to the Chimaera Group. The publication of the panther on the other side of U2,255 however, shows that the Fogg panthers are by another hand, and nothing remains, since it is unlike X25, X29, L2, L4, L7, L9, Rl-R4, R6, and G2, to suggest special proximity to the Chimaera Group, who use sirens or griffins or florals between felines, not geese, and either filling ornament unlike that on the Fogg aryballos or none at all. Gela 7864 is a fragment of a conical oinochoe, and a Syracuse fragment long discussed in connection with the Chimaera Group looks like a lid.256 These are shapes remote from 252 See p. 113 above with note 244. 253 Since the Painter of Louvre E 574 and the Riehen Painter band their plate bottoms differently from the Chimaera Painter, this fact alone would not exclude these plates from the Group. 254 CorVP, p. 173, nos. 2 and 3. 255 Papapostolou 1968, pl. 45:y. 256 CorVP, p. 169, B 2 (the exact reference is MonAnt 46, 1963, col. 61, pl. 22:c); for the Syracuse fragment, ibid., p. 170, D 1, with earlier literature. P. Orsi (MonAnt 17, 1906 [= Gela, Rome 1906], cols. 612-614; ill. on cols. 615-616), while suggesting the possibility (he thought) of large lids being used as plates, placed them under a heading, "Tegami molto espansi e relative coperchi." See also the equally fine lid Corinth XV, iii,</page><page sequence="63">116 PATRICIA LAWRENCE the Chimaera Group. I mean to say that X17, X26, X27, and X39, if they were not by the Chimaera Painter, would themselves have no claim to relationship, since, as we have seen, the Chimaera Painter's occasional involvement with animal-frieze pyxides is not shared by the rest of the Group. Now, the Syracuse lid is lovely but without any isolable configuration typical of any Chimaera Group artist. The Gela conical oinochoe is work at the same level as X27 but, in my opinion, not related to the Chimaera Painter in any important way. With the larger body of material now at our disposal, we may lay down the rule that work on plates, bowls, plaques, flat-bottomed aryballoi, and perhaps large alabastra may be proper to the Group if it either is by one of its hands or, like U2 and U4, shares all its distinctive characteristics.257 Work on other shapes does not belong to the Group unless, astonishingly, it actually belongs to one of its painters. It may be argued that the late EC pyxis, Berlin, S.M. 3929,258 in a style ancestral to V1-V4 and X17, shows that the Carrousel and Chimaera Painters may even have come out of a pyxis workshop. They may have. Just as arguably, the Chimaera Painter may have married a girl whose father or brother made pyxides, incurring an obligation to help from time to time. All we can assert is that there was some tie with a pyxis specialist. That tie does not make pyxides, as such, ripe candidates for inclusion in the Group. Wherever or however the Chimaera Painter's style and practice were formed, it is the formed repertory, not his inception, that defines the Group that he headed. I have already argued (note 94, p. 81 above) that the Carrousel Painter is unworthy of the lovely fragments that are related to his style.259 The remaining piece to be disassociated from the Group is in a quite different category. It is a very beautiful Early Corinthian plate, Gela 16379, from Bitalemi, which Amyx calls "very close to the Painter".260 Our disagreement is implicit in what I take to be its date: early in Early Corinthian, because the feline has a C-arc tail, the bull has a relatively short body and long legs, the doe has a big head and an enormous ear, with a short neck, the panther also has a short neck, the other feline has a slender body proportioned like those of the Sphinx Painter at his best or the Polyteleia Painter,261 and all the animals walk prissily, as all nice Corinthian animals did well before the end of the 7th century. It is close to the Chimaera Painter in the sense that the latter would admire this work, with its really elegant design and austere reserved ground, but it may well be too early for him to have seen it new, even as a boy, and, apart from an enclosed shoulder and no. 391, pl. 21. Stillwell (op. cit., p. 150), discussing no. 763, anticipated my rejection (Lawrence 1959, p. 355) of the Syracuse piece; she also excluded it, as I do now, from the Group. 257 These include, for aryballoi and alabastra, the virtual elimination of filling ornament. 258 Note 214 above. 259 CorVP, p. 167, C 1, C 2, C 6, C 7.

W Van Buren, "Newsletter from Rome," AJA 68, 1964, p. 384), one would guess that there are other, unpublished Corinthian plates from this excavation of a Demeter sanctuary. In fact, X13, whose inventory number shows that it is from Orlandini's, not Orsi's, excavation, is one such. 261 CorVP, pp. 70-73 (Sphinx Painter), 73 (Polyteleia Painter; I believe that B 1, p. 73, is by the painter himself).</page><page sequence="64">THE CHIMAERA GROUP AT CORINTH 117 one boxed foreleg, it has nothing specifically ancestral to his style.

LISTS OF ATTRIBUTIONS Lists X (Chimaera Painter), L (Painter of Louvre E 574), R (Riehen Painter), and V (Carrousel Painter) are, so far as possible, in chronological order, irrespective of vase shape, which is given following the museum number. The short lists, G, K, P, Q, and S, cannot be taken developmentally. List U presents previously published pieces first. List M relegates to the end pieces most remote from the work in lists X and L. Groupings of important pieces that cannot at present be placed definitively are given two-letter designations (Kr and Cy). For lists according to vase shape, see CorVP, pp. 165-174. To avoid confusion with Amyx's use of A, B, C, and AP to distinguish degrees of proximity to a painter's style, I have used other letters to designate my lists. Amyx provides bibliography for each painter and vase (Neeft 1991, pp. 50-51, gives some additional publications; it reached me after the present study was completed and required no changes to my own lists); not to duplicate Amyx's lists uselessly, I have cited only the best or most generally accessible reproduction of each previously published piece. Finally, I have repeated, in square brackets, the names of scholars who made attributions confirmed here, including even my own name, so that new attributions are readily identifiable as such.

A plate of unknown provenience, S3, by the same hand as S2, is listed with them. S 1i, from another Sicilian site, Akragas, like these needs further study and is listed with them because, in the photograph available to me, the style seems light and scratchy compared with the principal hands.

Purplish added red preserved in only one place. Tondo: very large head of griffin or griffin-bird (protome?), with two round knobs on thin stems and the base of a very large ear. Field of tondo has a reddish stain. No paint remains on the exterior. 271 Fragment from floor. Thickness of floor just inside foot 0.0 13 m. Pale clay (Munsell lOYR 8-7/3). Crazed, flaking, dark gray glaze-paint. Added red. In the tondo, part of a large subject, puzzling because an area with parallel, diagonal lines, which might be the edge of a wing, falls infront of what seems to be a heavy leg, bent at the knee, while the area read as the outside (with a border pattern) of the skirt of a short chiton passes behind that leg. Not found in the same deposit as Q1 but certainly like it.</page><page sequence="75">128 PATRICIA LAWRENCE (three-row dicing).

SOME PLATES FROM CYRENE Fragments of two plates, once doubtless splendid, from Cyrene show a surer hand and more ambition than the foregoing. Their exact relationship to the Painter of Corinth KP 1670 or to the Painter of Louvre E 574 is at present undetermined. Both are double-sided with very large drawing on the bottom of the plate and painstaking use of a compass in the floral crosses on the face, evidently contemporary with L13 and L13 bis, Q1 and Q2. A third unattributed plate fragment from Cyrene (Kocybala [forthcoming], no. 195) should also belong to the Chimaera Group. Cyl. Cyrene Fragment of a plate. Palmette and tendrils (ending in compass-drawn rosette) from a floral cross. Bottom: part of mane (large flame locks) and shoulder of a lion. Kocybala (forthcoming), no. 192. Cy2. Cyrene Fragment of a plate. Petals of a palmette and tendrils, as the last but larger. Bottom: Haunch (of an ungulate?) to 1. Kocybala (forthcoming), no. 193.

Max. p. dim. 0.084 m. Pale clay, more orangish on bottom (Munsell 7.5YR 8-7/4). Crazed, charcoal-gray glaze-paint on interior, firm and dark red brown to nearly black on bottom. Added red. In tondo, part of back and haunch of feline to right (as its relation to border of tondo requires) with three incised arcs on back instead of two. Added red in haunch. Band (0.0015 m.) around tondo, red band at offset (accidental red dot in field). Bottom: at least inner foot molding was red over black, then reserved (0.002 m.), band (0.004 m.), reserved (0.002 m.), band (0.0025 m.), then reserved to break. 278 Wall fragment. Pale pinkish clay (Munsell 5YR 8/4). Red-brown glaze-paint. Added red and white banding over glaze-paint on exterior. In tondo, rear half of large human head to right (so that possibly another such faced it) with a bit of "Volomandra" forelock, compound headband, and most of ear. Behind the head, part of a simple rosette. 279 Joined fragments preserving profile of wall and rim (with part of handle) but not foot of lekanoid bowl. On interior, pale clay (Munsell 2.5Y 8/2); on exterior, variable and very pink, where glaze-paint is partly gone, partly dark gray, partly red brown. The polychromy added on the exterior is poorly preserved; it was wRw on lower exterior of the bowl. On interior, glaze-paint is mostly flaked away, in part brownish gray and crazed. In tondo, each group of fragments (note the distance from each other at which the left and right pieces were excavated) preserved about half of the sphinx or siren and one of the rosettes. The fragments at left (PI. 57), with some paint, are those from the "North Dump". 280 Fragment from floor. Pale clay (Munsell 1OYR 8/3). Crazed, gray glaze-paint with brown streaks (fugitive on bottom). No certain traces of added red. In tondo, part of shoulder and foreleg joint, with a little behind it, part of feline to 1.

Part of head and shoulders of man to left; bold style but unlike the Chimaera Painter. Fragments of other bowls, which in their preserved state seem less certainly relevant to the Chimaera Group, may be cited here. They are all from bowls of the same type as X18, X35, and X36, and all but the last are from the "North Dump" or the areas around the "South Long Building": Corinth, numbered sherds L1929-4-2, L1929-4-4, L1929-4-1 and 5 (from one bowl), L1929-4-7, L1930-1-1, and L1931-2-1 (Northwest Angle Deposit). 281 Fragment from the rim and wall. Max. p. dim. 0.074 m. Pale clay (Munsell 10YR 8/3). Brownish to gray glaze-paint. No added red. 282 Fragment preserving profile of floor, foot, and part of wall. Max. p. dim. 0.073 m. Very pale clay (Munsell 2.5Y 8/2). Crazed, gray glaze-paint. Pale, purplish added red. In tondo, parts of feline: slash ribs (with alternate interstices red) and part of shoulder are clearly legible. Good potter's work, but see also Corinth XV, iii, no. 769, pl. 36. 283 Fragment preserving part of floor and full profile of rim. Powdery, pinkish clay (Munsell 5YR 8/4). Darker and reddish traces of glaze-paint. Added red (evidently over glaze-paint) preserved only on moldings and in banding on back. At left side of tondo, sickle wing, probably of sphinx. Banding (uniform width 0.0035 m.): one inside groove on rim, three at its root (above, at, and inside offset). The rim molding and double foot molding are red. Bottom: two bands, 0.01 m. inside foot molding and 0.0025 m. apart, then blank to break. I have not seen an earlier plate that had all the bands painted with the same medium-sized brush, as here. 284 Fragment from floor with foot moldings. Clay reduced by fire (Munsell, about 7.5YR 7/2). Vestiges of glaze-paint are dark gray, of added red dull purple. In tondo, ringed center with two rows of dicing; to the outer ring, lotus blossoms are attached, as if on spokes, with buds(?) between them. On bottom, bands (W. about 0.003 m.) about 0.015 m. apart (not the nearly equal painted and reserved bands of X28 et al.). In profile, the rim "covers" less than the outer foot molding. This plate probably represents emulation of the Chimaera Group. It is much too large a plate for Callipolitis-Feytmans's CM Classe I (1962, p. 149, fig. 15) and clearly later. 285 Fragment preserving profile of foot with a little of floor and wall. Pale clay (Munsell 2.5Y 8/2). Crazed, dark gray glaze-paint. Traces of added red. In tondo, part of head and shoulders of a man to 1., with a large zigzag in the border across his shoulders.</page><page sequence="80">PLATE 38 THE CHIMAERA GROUP AT CORINTH 'All X5 (KP 2902) 3:2 X3(KP2903) 9:10 X15 (CP-3245) 5:6 X14Al92910y7) - .
