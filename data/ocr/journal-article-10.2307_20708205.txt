<plain_text><page sequence="1">Bear Imagery and Ritual in Northeast North America: An Update and Assessment of A. Irving HallowelPs Work Thomas E. Berres, David M. Stoibers, and David Mather ABSTRACT Over seventy years ago, A. Irving Hallowell called attention to the widespread distribution of bear ceremonialism among boreal cultures of northern Eurasia and North America. He showed that reverence for the bear was governed primarily by sociopsychological factors of possible great antiquity. This study draws on Hallowell's insights and uses a holistic approach to interpret bear imagery and ritual found in archaeological contexts for northeastern North America. Various data demonstrate the antiquity and variability of bear ceremonialism including the communal feasting of bear brains, ritual use of skull masks, public display of skulls in elevated positions, various expressions of symbolism in art, ritual disposal of post-cranial remains, and widespread distribution of bear clans with their associated rituals and leadership roles. Cross-culturally, the bear may signify a dangerous predatory animal opposed to humans while simultaneously looking and behaving like a person, thus representing a source of power as an other-than-human being. Do the resemblances in customs and beliefs connected with the bear in Eurasia and North America represent the result of convergent, but historically distinct developments, or is there any reason to believe that they may have originally sprung from common historical roots? [Hallowell 1926:156] In his extensive comparative survey of bear ceremonialism, Hallowell (1926) found that the geographic distribution of beliefs and customs regarding bears is widespread and deeply integrated in boreal hunting cultures of northern North America and Asia. Using what was subsequently termed an "ernie" approach, he shows that traditional peoples have a very close relationship with nature. This relationship is not just economic, but governed largely by social psychological factors (Barnouw 1963:147-151; Eliade 1964; Hallowell 1947; Radin 1937:193; Sapir 1966). All animals and natural phenomena are viewed as possessing life and power capable of good or evil. There is continuity, integration, and interaction between humans and animate nonhuman forms that exist in the cosmos (Morrison 2002:29; Redfield 1952). This system of interaction occurs across space and time with dreams, dances, myths, rituals, and songs having kinship, economic, religious, political, and aesthetic dimensions. Traditional small-scale societies were concerned with how the bear (and other animals) affected their welfare and, specifically, how they could placate and use its power for the maintenance of life.

Berres, David M. Stothers, and David Mather This study presents an update and reassessment of Hallowell's 1926 article (a summary of his doctoral dissertation) that appeared in American Anthropologist, which provided an initial assessment of bear ceremonialism from a primarily circum-polar perspective. New insights are given here on the temporal depth, widespread distribution, and rich variation of bear imagery and ceremonialism by using data from northeastern North America. The Northeast region as presented here stretches from the northwestern Lake Superior region south to the confluence of the Ohio and Mississippi Rivers and then east to the Atlantic Coast. The northern boundary is congruent with the southern edge of the boreal forest that stretches across Canada and Alaska. The American black bear (Ursus americanus) formerly flourished throughout the forested portions of the Northeast (Cleland 1966:163; Craighead 2000:64, 129) and figured prominently in the religious, social, and economic life of the Algonquian, Northern Iroquoian, and Siouan-speaking peoples such as the Winnebago and Mdewakanton Dakota. Hallowell (1926:71, 154) found scanty evidence for bear ceremonialism in the Central Algonquian region, and failed to report any among Northern Iroquoian speakers. Since his original study, however, there is mounting archaeological evidence showing the antiquity and rich variety of bear imagery and rituals, and their importance in the traditions of native cultures in this region. The importance of the black bear's head at rituals is documented in the archaeological record for feasts that involved the consumption of brains at the Carpenter Brook, Schwerdt, and Bell sites; the use of skull masks at the Williams Cemetery and Hind sites; and the public display of skulls on poles or hangings at sites in the Mille Lacs Locality (Figure 1). Creative expressions of bear symbolism also figure prominently in various artworks through time as traditional peoples sought the animals' powers through signs of reverence. The paucity or absence of post-cranial remains at settlements suggests the ceremonial disposal of a slain bear so that other bears might feel honored to be caught and killed, perhaps a sign of reverence through taboo. Ethnographic and ethnohistoric data regarding the widespread distribution of bear clans with their associated rituals and leadership roles provide additional evidence for the prominence of bears in the lives of traditional peoples. The Power of the Bear as an Other-Than-Human Person and Economic Resource An "Other-Than-Human Person" Native northeast peoples view the cosmos as a single, mutually interdependent reciprocal system (Morrison 2002) that humans cannot fully confront or have power over. Their religions may be understood in terms of the power both to deny death and to also allow one to live a meaningful life. It was in the peoples' paramount self-interest to be able to fend off evil and seek assistance from the powers around them. Although the meaning of "power" defies a concise</page><page sequence="3">Bear Imagery and Ritual in Northeast North America English definition, it is generally understood by the term "medicine" (Gill and Sullivan 1992:242) or as a synonym for a person of the other-than-human class (Hallowell 1960:44; Morrison 2002:48-49). The Algonquian term manitou, the Iroquoian orenda, and the Siouan wakanda all refer to it (Berres 2001:31). Following Radin's (1914) essay on the "Religion of the North American Indians," Hallowell (1960:44) rejected connotations such as supernatural, impersonal, and magical to describe power, to which he initially gave prominence in Algonquian religious life (see Morrison 2002:29). Manitou may appear in all things visible including human beings, animals, mythological creatures, rocks, trees, fire, phantoms, water, and earth; when audible, it may appear in the form of song or voice, whistling of the wind, or the crackling of the fire; when felt emotionally it may appear in a prayer, dream, or vision; or when manifesting its presence by a sign, it may be by lightning, a cloud, or even colors (Radin 1914:352-353; Tooker 1964:91; Volmar 1996:39). Like other animals, bears were thought to possess power as, in Hallowell's (1960) apt words, "other-than-human beings." Hallowell (1960:39, 43) notes that the Ojibwe (Chippewa) deemed some animals more significant than others, with the spiritual masters of the species often possessing the power of metamorphosis. Bears may have been perceived as especially attuned to power among many traditional peoples (Comeau 1996; Driver 1961:81; Volmar 1996:39; Wright 1987:3). Members of the family Ursidae elicited almost universal fear and reverence as the most powerful, adaptable, intelligent, dangerous, and nearly human of Figure 1. Archaeological sites with bear ritual remains.</page><page sequence="4">8 Thomas E. Berres, David M. S?o?hers, and David Mather the animals (Hallowell 1926:148-149; Sokolova 2000)?an appropriate symbol for power as personified by shamans as well as military and civil leaders. The American black bear's size is intimidating, with some adult males weighing 227 to 364 kg and measuring 1.5 to 1.8 m in length (Craighead 2000:129; Furtman 1998:35). Bears have attacked people, therefore eliciting human fears of being mauled, maimed, and even killed. Fear of this powerful animal, which both competed with and sometimes preyed upon humans, was partially responsible for various rituals, legends, and tales. For example, the Delaware have a legend of a dangerous giant bear called The Great Naked or Hairless Bear that attacked and ate the natives (Lenik 2002:174). Seneca stories regarding the bear monster Ganiagwaihegowa also illustrate this point. According to Curtin and Hewitt (1918:799): Ganiagwaihegowa ... is the name of a mythic monster which is described as a huge bear, being vulnerable only in the soles of its forefeet; keen of scent, it never allowed anything to escape that crossed its circular track or path; it was represented as hairless except as to its tail, and that it had over its forequarters a large ridge or fold of flesh. These characteristics sufficed to make this fanciful creature a source of abject terror. Native Americans also felt a special kinship with bears because of many shared morphological and behavioral characteristics, which lent the bears more readily to anthropomorphism than other animals. As Hallowell (1926:150) states, "the human qualities of bears may have also aroused awe, wonder, fear or some other emotional response which, in turn, gave rise to an attitude of veneration." Bears possess numerous human-like qualities: they often stand on their hind legs with their front legs hanging like arms and, occasionally, walk upright (Jackson 1961:315; Kurath 1964:66; Skinner 1914:203); they use their forepaws to manipulate objects; they are omnivorous with a diet similar to that of humans. A skinned bear carcass resembles a human corpse (Wallace 1949:39); and, because the bear is a plantigrade animal with broad soles and five digits, imprints left by its paws resemble human footprints more than those of other animals. The bones of the bear's front and hind paws are remarkably similar to the hand and foot bones of humans (Gilbert 1990:68). Their unpredictable disposition?timid, yet also quick-tempered and dangerous?was sometimes characteristic of bear clan members. For example, members of the Prairie Potawatomi bear clan were described as stalwart and quick-tempered, just like the bear (Landes 1963:579, 1970:225-226). The bear's prominence may thus be attributed to two opposite sets of meanings, signifying a dangerous, intelligent predatory animal opposed to people, while also seen as looking and behaving like a human. The union of these two opposed yet related beings provides an apt vehicle for religious themes (Douglas 1966:169; Willis 1990:8). Some underlying commonality or continuity is recognized in legends where bears become people and vice versa. Metamorphosis was considered possible because of the absence of sharply</page><page sequence="5">Bear Imagery and Ritual in Northeast North America differentiated animal and human categories. Bears like the Great White Bear of the Menominee, Waiabskinit Awase, were believed capable of transforming to human form, and vice versa. This was understood to be the source from which humans could enhance their personal power and that of the community for good orili (Curtis 1952; Hallowell 1960:34-40; Radin 1937:206; Wissler 1928:340). Economic Significance The economic significance of the bear may also be considered a source? though not a predominant one?of its power among many traditional peoples of the Northeast. Although Hallowell (1926:152-153) discounted the economic hypothesis because beaver and other game animals were thought to have greater value, historical documents of native Northeast groups contradict such claims (see Volmar 1996:37-38). The black bear has long been hunted for meat and hides; and parts such as skulls, brains, blood, paws, teeth, claws, and fat were commonly utilized as well (McCracken et al. 1995). Densmore (1929:44) reports that among the Ojibwe: The flesh of the bear was cut in strips about 6 inches wide and hung on a frame to dry. If intended for winter use, it frequently was put on high racks to freeze. When used it was cut up a little and boiled. Bear meat was liked because it was so fat. All parts of the bear were eaten or utilized. The head was considered a luxury. They singed it, removed the inside, and boiled it whole. The paws were singed, scraped, and boiled. The liver was good to eat and the intestines were so fat that the Chippewa cleaned them and fried them crisp. The stomach was filled with tallow, known as "bear's grease," which was used for seasoning... The gall was dried, mixed with cedar charcoal, and "pricked into the skin" as a remedy for rheumatism and other ailments. Wallace (1949:38) notes that the black bear was highly valued among the Delaware, especially during the winter: From New Year's time to spring, when the bear was hibernating, the Delawares hunted him intensively if not exclusively. Bear meat was eaten with gusto, and, being an oily meat, it was certainly suitable for a winter diet, as well as congenial to the Indian taste for greasy food. The Delawares were also fond of dried venison, pounded in a mortar, and dipped in bear's oil. Bear's oil, indeed, was a valuable product, stored and used for a variety of culinary recipes. Blankets were made of bear skin, and likewise shoes. Bear Feasts: Ethnographic and Ethnohistoric Evidence Communal rituals surrounding the bear hunt were cross-culturally prevalent as traditional peoples sought the animals' powers through signs of reverence.</page><page sequence="6">Thomas E. Berres, David M. Stothers, and David Mather Such rituals were often open to the community and focused on maintaining or increasing the supply of game, or preventing disease. After a bear was slain, rites were properly performed to appease the bear's spirit before and after the carcass was butchered for its highly valued meat, fat, hides, fur, and oil or grease (Blair 1911-1912:131-132; Casagrande 1952:113; Curtis 1952:182; Flannery and Chambers 1985:5, 8; Hallowell 1926:61-74; Wallace 1949:38). The display and consumption of edible bear parts took on a sacramental character to mark special occasions like the Delaware Big House Ceremony (Wallace 1949), the Bear Dance of the Mesquakie (Owen 1904:55-56), and the Cree eat-all feast (Flannery and Chambers 1985:5, 8-10). David Zeisberger (1910:140) reports that bear meat was particularly desirable as an offering to the dead: "To the spirits of the dead they offer both meat and drink-offerings. If it is to be a meat offering, which the doctors must decide in case of illness or accident, either a hog or a bear is killed for a feast and guests are invited." Characteristic of rituals, the display and consumption of bear meat and parts (food in general) was apparently meant to convey messages about or to the spirits as well as about the physiological, psychological, and sociological states of the participants (Berres 2001:44, 190; Rappaport 1971:66-67). The black bear's head held a special ritual significance at feasts among historic peoples of the Northeast (Blair 1911-1912:130-132). Several accounts attest to the head being cooked and brains consumed ceremonially at communal meals given by the Delaware (Grumet 2001:131), Mesquakie (Michelson 1928), Ojibwe (Henry 1809:138), Cree of Moose Fort (Skinner 1914:204), Menominee (Skinner 1915:213), Huron (Tooker 1964:72-73), and Iroquois (Fenton 1953:106-107). Devotion, social cooperation, and aesthetic considerations may have governed the presentation of the ritual food. Alanson Skinner recorded the following bear feast as performed by the Cree of Moose Fort: The head of the bear was first cut off and cooked, after which the men and boys of the camp sat down in a circle about it. A large stone pipe was laid beside the head and a plug of tobacco placed upon it. Then the man who had killed the bear arose from his place in the circle and filled the pipe with the tobacco, after which it was lighted and passed about the circle from left to right, the slayer smoking first. Each person had the alternative of smoking the pipe for several moments or merely taking a single puff before passing it on. After this the bear's head was passed about and everyone strove to bite out a piece of its flesh without touching it with his hands. [1914:204-205] Joseph Casagrande recounts a bear ceremonial event as told by an Ojibwe informant, John Quaderers, of the Lac Court Oreilles Reservation, Wisconsin: I killed a bear and a cub and spread out a mat and put the head and four paws on it. Then I put tobacco in front of the nose, and beads and ribbons and fancy stuff on his head. It stays that way four days.. .People come to visit the bear and bring things for it like a bowl of wild rice or maple sugar or syrup or</page><page sequence="7">Bear Imagery and Ritual in Northeast North America blueberries ... If this is done in the evening, the first person coming in the morning could eat the food on the mat . . . After the fourth day the head and paws would be cooked and eaten. [1952:114] The consumption of bear brains was an important part of Menominee ritual: "The neighbors are invited to take part, and while they eat the bear's flesh, the head is dished up separately and given to the braves. When the skull is cleaned they make a hole in the right temple to take out the brains, which are devoured in their turn." (Skinner 1915:213) After the bear feast, skulls were often cleaned and dried, and sometimes carefully painted with charcoal, vermilion, or other pigments. They were then placed in an elevated position (e.g., on tree branches, scaffolds, or special poles) often with tobacco and ribbons, as both symbolic displays of success and sacrificial offerings to the bears (Hallowell 1926:136-140). This was the custom of the Ojibwe (Skinner 1914:207), East Cree (Flannery and Chambers 1985:10; Skinner 1911:162-163, 1914:204), Swampy Cree (Preston 1964), and Menominee (Higgins 1990). Callender (1978b:685-686) reports that during the Midewiwin rituals of the Miami, "The director of the ceremony, accompanied by four elderly men and women, entered each lodge to announce its beginning. Bearskins whose heads were painted with green clay were placed on an altar and saluted by everyone who passed these." Prominence of the Bear's Head in Antiquity The importance of the black bear's head in ceremonies and rituals is clearly documented in the ethnographic record. Behaviors which can be recognized archaeologically included the consumption of brains at feasts, the public display of skulls on poles or other elevated areas, and the use of skull masks in ceremonies. Archaeological evidence of possible feasts involving the bear, especially the brain, has accumulated at sites across the Northeast from various time periods, involving both Northern Iroquoian and Algonquian peoples. William A. Ritchie (1947,1965:296) provided the first well-documented case of a bear feast as indicated by remains found at the Carpenter Brook site in Onondaga County, central New York (Figure 1). The midden at Carpenter Brook yielded seven to nine black bears, represented by skull and foot bones, in association with a smoking pipe, clay phallic effigy, and sherds from about two hundred cooking vessels, suggesting that the Late Woodland Owasco people (ca. a.D. 1000-1300) were involved in the disposal of bear feast remains. Ritchie (1950) reported further evidence of bear ceremonialism at the Palmer site, an Iroquois village in Monroe County, western New York. Elements associated with a possible adult female and an immature male exhibit charring (probably from roasting) and butcher marks, along with cranial damage from blows with a blunt object, were indicative of ceremonial killing, consumption, and disposition of the remains. The superior canines of the adult bear were extracted, probably for use as decorative devices.</page><page sequence="8">Thomas E. Berres, David M. Stothers, and David Mather Guilday et al. (1962:68) provide archaeological evidence of feasting at the Eschelman site (36LA12), in Lancaster County, Pennsylvania. This site is part of a historic Susquehannock village (a.D. 1600-1625), at which excavations of a midden produced skulls that were split with an axe for brain extraction. Two notable sites in the western Great Lakes region provide additional evidence suggesting ritual consumption of bear brains: the Schwerdt and Bell sites. Schwerdt is a fifteenth-century fishing camp located in the Lower Kalamazoo Valley, Allegan County, Michigan. Two black bear skulls were recovered from deep roasting/refuse pits located only about 20 m apart. Both skulls exhibited a large hole in the parietal/temporal portion of the cranium, suggesting the removal of brain tissue and, therefore, representing the remains of a communal feast. The differential disposal of bear remains was indicated by the absence of post-cranial elements (Higgins 1990). Parmalee (1963:66-67) and Wittry (1963:6) reported on the ritual consumption of bear brains at the Bell site (47WN9), the Grand Village of the Mesquakie, dating from about a.D. 1680 to 1730. This site is situated on the south shore of Big Lake Butte des Morts in Winnebago County, Wisconsin. Two complete black bear skulls, found in pits, displayed large holes in the parietal/temporal portion, suggesting removal of the brain tissue during feasts. The bear skull in Feature 28 was apparently associated with several human graves (Behm 1992:39), perhaps serving in communal "Feast of the Dead" ceremonies as practiced by seventeenth-century groups of the Upper Great Lakes area to honor the dead as intermediary beings (Hultkrantz 1981; Tooker 1964:135). Possible evidence of bear feasts also occurs at two sites in New Jersey. The Minisink site, a Late Woodland/Contact Period site in Sussex County, contained the remains of 14 black bears (Volmar 1996:41-42) while the Pahaquarra Site, a Late Woodland site in the upper Delaware River Valley, contained a black bear hum?rus, mandible, and maxilla fragment, in association with the skull of a child and abundant food remains in the same pit (Lenik 2002:174). /7/e Lacs Locality of East-Central Minnesota Powerful expressions of bear ceremonialism occur at late prehistoric sites within the Mille Lacs locality and its environs of east-central Minnesota, including Christensen Mound, Crace, and Elders'. These sites date to the Wahkon and Shakopee phases (ca. a.D. 1000-1680) (Gibbon 1975; Mather 2000), which apparently show continuity with the Mdewakanton Dakota. The black bear remains and their archaeological contexts are discussed below. The first archaeological evidence of bear ceremonialism in Minnesota came from the Christensen Mound site (21SH1/16), which is located on the western shore of Elk Lake in Sherburne County. In 1907, Newton Winchell, state geologist at the University of Minnesota, conducted excavations that focused on the linear earthworks. However, he also noted a concentration of bear cranial</page><page sequence="9">Bear Imagery and Ritual in Northeast North America bones and teeth eroding from the side of a wagon road about 15 m south of Mound 3. Winchell (1911:293) reports, The teeth found were perhaps 150 in number, all tusks, while in the jaw-bones were usually a nearly perfect set of smaller teeth. Some of the bones and some of the teeth had been blackened by fire . . . There were no long bones, nor any bones or teeth of other animals. The bear remains of Elk Lake gained greater publicity from another discovery made about forty years after Winchell's visit, a time when Mound 1 was being leveled for a parking lot. While excavating at the mound edge, the property owner encountered a large concentration of bear bones consisting primarily of mandibles. Louis Powell of the St. Paul Science Museum collected and recorded the finds. He speculated that feasts held by a protohistoric Dakota group involved both mound construction and ritual disposal of bear remains. His records also list such fauna as bison, lynx, eagle, and crane (Lukens 1963), animals revered by many tribes. Subsequently, Dr. Lloyd Wilford of the University of Minnesota obtained permission for salvage excavations. He excavated a block in the center of the mound where ten groups of secondary human burials were encountered, but associated artifact finds were few. The mound was assigned to the Kathio Focus, dating to early Late Woodland times (Wilford et al. 1969), which was supported by a radiocarbon date of A.D. 1110 ? 70 (Mather 2000). A remarkable aspect of the Christensen Mound fauna are the bear remains, which suggest the bear's religious significance among the Kathio community. Recent examination of this assemblage revealed a predominance of skull fragments. The mandibles alone account for a minimum of 105 bears. Although poorly represented, other skeletal elements include nine pelvis fragments, two ulna fragments, three atlases, and a few rib fragments. Notably absent are humeri, foot bones, and hind limbs. The body-part representation suggests special ritual disposal practices; a natural death assemblage would include nearly all of the individual's bones, especially the densest bones least subject to destruction by natural processes. The apparent gathering of selected remains and their interment in the mound, as part of a secondary burial process, coincides with the burial mode of the people found in the Christensen Mound. The deceased were presumably exposed on scaffolds or defleshed prior to interment of selected elements (usually skulls and long bones) in the mound. Other concentrations of bear remains have been recovered from the Crace site (21ML3), which is part of a larger complex of Middle and Late Woodland burial mounds and habitation components. It is located on the northwest side of Lake Onamia, one of the chain of lakes in the Rum River at the Lake Mille Lacs outlet. In 1972, University of Minnesota field school excavations under the direction of Guy Gibbon revealed evidence of bear ceremonialism in a pit found within a lakeshore midden. This feature contained burned and</page><page sequence="10">;?fif Thomas E. Berres, David M. Stothers, and David Mather fragmented remains of a minimum of 32 bears, with mandibles predominating. Postcranial elements are again present in significantly lower quantities. Gibbon (1975) suggested that the feature has a Late Woodland affiliation based on its close association with Kathio ceramics, thus being roughly contemporaneous with the rituals conducted at Christensen Mound. The Elders' site (21ML68) is situated along Lake Mille Lacs and dates to the Shakopee Phase (ca. a.d. 1300-1680). It was discovered in 1998 during investigations undertaken by the Mille Lacs Band of Ojibwe (Mather and McFarlane 1999). A large pit was found containing hundreds of bear skulls, providing a striking example of bear ceremonialism. The ritual pit, measuring about 4 5 m, was discovered immediately below the ground surface. The tops of bear skulls were visible at a 5-cm depth, with further excavations revealing a greater density of skulls immediately below. For example, portions of twenty skulls were visible at this depth within a 1 1 m unit placed at the eastern edge of the feature; the skulls were stacked at least three deep. By extrapolating the number of skulls mapped at the surface level with the pit's dimensions, it was estimated that this pit may contain as many as 500 bear skulls. It was not ethically responsible to excavate the entire feature given its incredibly complex and fragile nature and cultural importance. In consultation with the Mille Lacs band of Ojibwe elders and Dakota religious leaders, the project goals changed from excavation to preservation. A sample of bear teeth was removed during the initial excavations, and these have been ranked following Stiner's (1998) tooth-wear classification system. The results show an elderly population, with most teeth in the oldest age groups. Also, measurements of the teeth approach the upper limits for black bears according to Gordon (1977) and Graham (1991). The prevalence of large, old skulls suggests curation for display as hangings or placement on poles prior to ritual burial. The anatomical representation of bears at the Elders' site indicates an aspect of ceremonialism different from that at the Christensen Mound or Crace sites, with the absence of intact skulls at those sites essentially opposite of the Elders' site. As a whole, however, the three sites reflect a notable density of bear ceremonial customs within a small area of Mille Lacs. The data also illus trate some of the time depth, variation, and complexity of bear ceremonialism. Other sites in eastern North America provide additional evidence. Williams Cemetery Site (33W07a) of Northwestern Ohio A black bear cranium and several canine teeth were recovered from the Late Archaic/Transitional Woodland Williams Cemetery Complex (1000-600 b.c.), located on opposing terraces overlooking the Maumee River in northwestern Ohio. The complex consists of a contemporaneous crematory site on the north side of the Maumee River (Sidecut Crematory) as well as a cemetery on the opposing side (Williams Cemetery). The 1977 excavations at the Williams Cemetery (33W07a) by archaeologists from the University of Toledo revealed</page><page sequence="11">Bear Imagery and Ritual in Northeast North America 21 burial features containing the remains of a minimum of 656 to 1000 individuals, associated with abundant and exotic ritual items (e.g., bald eagle talon cores, polished bobcat femur, polished mountain lion ulna awls, conch shell beads [Abel et al. 2001]). One of the prominent ritual objects was a cut and drilled black bear skull frontal mask associated with Burial Feature 8, Layer 3 (Figure 2) (Abel et al. 2001:315, Figure 10; Stothers and Abel 1993). Three pairs of drilled holes for attachment of a hide occur along the frontal medial section. Two other black bear skull masks have been recovered from the Hind site (AdHk-1), a Terminal Archaic "Glacial K?me" cemetery located in the Thames Valley of southwestern Ontario (Donaldson and Wortner 1995:15,24). One pair of drilled holes for hide attachment occurs along the frontal medial section of each modified skull. The presence of bear skull masks at both sites may indicate that the societies were linked by bear clan identity, providing symbols for the continuity of the group and its power. Figure 2. Bear skull mask from the Williams Cemetery showing frontal view of cranium and interior portion with notching.</page><page sequence="12">Thomas E. Berres, David M. S?others, and David Mather Bear Costumes in Native Northeast Societies In many native Northeast tribes, the bear was often associated with shamanism and medicine rites (Kurath 1964:70). Shamans, having special access to power, would wear bear masks (skull or manufactured) and bearskin costumes in their rituals (Gill and Sullivan 1992:23). Masks are not just aesthetic objects, but instruments that affect the mind and senses in ritual performances (Jaeger 1943; Kurath 1960-1961:210; Speck 1950; Wissler 1928). According to Gill (1987:37-42), the mask and costume "provides a physical form in which the spiritual beings may manifest their presence . . . The full meaning is gained by looking through the eye-holes of the mask and seeing the effect it has on the world." The bear mask worn in front of the face creates anonymity for the wearer, thereby obscuring the human ego. The wearer therefore becomes an "other-than-human" being, as among the Iroquois (Blair 1911:49), Menominee (Curtis 1952:178, 180; Hoffman 1890), Ojibwe (Casagrande 1952:113), and Winnebago (Radin 1970:180, 277) where bears are Lower World beings possessing the power to cause or cure illness and who are revered in hunting and warfare activities. Among the Sauk, shamans were thought to be capable of transforming themselves into bears and other animals to destroy their enemies: Manitu'-we'siu are human beings who practice witchcraft, turning themselves into various animals, such as bears, fowls, dogs, wolves, turkeys, or owls in order to accomplish the destruction of their enemies by means of black magic. This is a very common belief among all the Central Algonkians, Southern Siouans and even the Iroquois and Algonkian tribes of the east [Skinner 1923:55]. Participation in a psychological drama could create awe among an assembled audience, perhaps involving words spoken and sung, dreams recounted, dances performed using mimicry, and the possible use of accessories including ornamenting costume. The special performance represents the power of the human imagination that helped to perpetuate religious traditions (Holsbeke 1996:11). Wissler (1928:346) states, "The bear plays a part in the mythologies of many peoples and so is impersonated with great frequency; sometimes the face of the bear is realistically carved in wood, to which the skin of a bear is attached; drawing this over his head, the savage will crouch and growl, and by skillful acting give a satisfactory representation of a bear." According to Gertrude Kurath (1960-1961:209-210), "The Iroquois, Cherokee, Mandan, and Meskwaki worship the bear and buffalo spirits by imitation of their behavior . . . Iroquois Bear and Buffalo dancers stoop and lumber like these beasts." The Iroquois Bear Dance forms part of the bear cult not included in Hallowell's (1926) work. The rite addresses the Great Spirit Bear, who initiates and can cure illness such as neurotic spasms, or who can fulfill dreams of the</page><page sequence="13">Bear Imagery and Ritual in Northeast North America bear (Kurath 1964:13, 67). The dance occurs at Midwinter medicine rites and private ceremonies, and involves "waddling and clomping in imitation of the bear and during song 9 communion with bear food, huckleberry or blackberry juice in a pail (Kurath 1964:13)." The bear mask and attached skin was a vital part of the bear shaman's costume. A prehistoric bear shaman figurine was recovered from Ohio Hopewell mortuary contexts at Newark, Licking County, Ohio (Dragoo and Wray 1964). Skillfully carved in limonitic schist, the head and attached hide of a bear covers the shaman. In 1615, Champlain saw a curing ceremony conducted by the Huron in which the medicine dancers wore bearskin suits (Kinietz 1940:140-141; Kurath 1964:70; Smith 1985:111). Speck (1950:56) reports that a party of twelve Munsee Delaware (Ontario) maskers dressed in bearskin or deerskin costumes visited houses to drive out disease by throwing ashes. Bear impersonator costumes were instrumental in the course of the annual Delaware Big House Ceremony called the Mask Spirit Dance. This Mask Spirit (misinghalikun, or Living Solid Face), dressed entirely in bearskin, served various community functions as the guardian of the game, master of disease, and control over anti-social behavior?thereby preserving life and health (Jaeger 1943:93; Speck 1950:35-38; Volmar 1996:39-40; Wallace 1949:42-43). Power of Bear Imagery:Tradition and Variation in Art The bear has stirred the creativity and imagination in native visual art from at least Late Archaic times across much of the Northeast; an art embedded in culture and not simply art produced for the sake of art alone (Eliade 1991; Rosman and Rubel 1995:230). Artwork, especially as pictography, provided traditional people the means of conveying history, myths, and stories through successive generations. Artists show the bear's power in graphic or sculptural imagery that both expresses beauty and serves as the instruments of a ritual process. Such artwork may reveal personal power as well as the strength of a well-ordered community because the artist works within the tradition of one's culture. Bear imagery could resonate in the collective memories of the community and beyond, and took many forms. Bear canine-tooth ornaments were created over thousands of years spanning Late Archaic through historic Native American times (Table 1). Archaeologists are most familiar with the presence of bear canine teeth at Hopewell cemeteries (Struever and Houart 1972:57). Mark Seeman (1979:372) stated that over one thousand bear canine-tooth ornaments had been recovered from Hopewell contexts as of the 1970s. The teeth were either whole, cut, or split longitudinally; grooved, polished, drilled with one or more holes for suspension; pearl-inlaid, pegged, incised, and/or carved (Struever and Houart 1972:59), and were so prized that their form was imitated in antler, bone, copper, marine shell, mica, and wood (Greber and Ruhl 1989:229; Herold 1971:87). They may have been worn as pendants, bracelets, or necklace</page><page sequence="14">Thomas E. Berres, David M. Stothers, and David Mather Table 1.

Cut halves of bear mandibles, and sometimes maxillas, also occur in Hopewell contexts. Some were polished, partially ground, and bored for</page><page sequence="17">Bear Imagery and Ritual in Northeast North America suspension as a pendant or necklace, or possibly attached to a breechcloth. Uncut mandibles may have been simply laid near or upon the bodies of deceased humans (Deuel 1952:169-170). Bear images were carved into blocks of argillite, claystone, and wood or sculpted from clay, with the creative three-dimensional transformations displaying a remarkably naturalistic style. Bear effigy artifacts have been found from southern New England to Maine (Volmar 1996:40). In Massachusetts, a bear's head adze blade found in North Andover was dated to the Archaic period, while three bear's head effigy pestles probably date from the Late Woodland (Ceramic) to the Historic Contact periods (ca. a.D. 950-1550) (Lenik 2002:141). A bear effigy also comes from the Haskell's site, a Maine Cemetery complex east of Penobscot Bay, Maine (Volmar 1996:42). Some of the finest technical work and artistic presentation were produced in sculpting the bowls of Hopewellian platform pipes. The precisely carved, smoothly polished pipes with bear effigies often occur as grave goods that probably expressed deep religious significance, as found at the Wilson Mound Group (Mound 6, Burial 9) in White County, Illinois (Neumann and Fowler 1952:200, Plate LXVIc) and the Cook's Farm Mound Group (Mound 10) in Scott County, Iowa (Gass 1877:95). The effigy pipes may have provided powerful visual symbols in communal rites that brought people together to experience mourning as well as a celebration of life. They likely served as instruments of a ritual process. According to Gill (1987:41): Effigy pipes were used by the Iroquoian and Algonkian peoples as aides in the concentration of thought; that is, they were instruments of meditation ... the meaning of the effigy pipe is inseparable from the act of smoking the pipe, from the relationship the smoker has with the spirit represented on the pipe. The communal sacrificial offerings were perhaps meant to either appease or communicate with other-than-human beings for their advice or help (Child and Child 1993:70-80). Bear paws also attained special symbolic meaning (Hallowell 1926:69, 70, 139; Skinner 1914:203-204, 206). Representational images include a five clawed, broad pawprint occurring in Ohio Hopewell visual art (Hall 1997:127-128). For example, a claw-and-footpad motif is incised in a human femur from the Hopewell type-site of southern Ohio (Willoughby 1916:Plate lb, c). Such motifs also appear in sheet-copper cutout ornaments, as found in Mound 25 of the Hopewell site, and the plan of a stone enclosure in Black Run, Ross County, Ohio (Hall 1997:Figure 15.3c). In north-central Ohio, two paw motifs were carved in an elk-antler handle recovered from a possible Hopewellian Esch phase (a.D. 1-500) human burial at the Baker II site, Sandusky County (Abel and Edwards 1990). Midewiwin (Grand Medicine Society) bags of the Great Lakes tribes were often made from a black bear's paw (Casagrande 1952:113; Driver 1961:422). Grizzly bear-claw necklaces were popular among nineteenth-century native groups of the eastern Plains and western Great Lakes, sometimes richly</page><page sequence="18">Thomas E. Berres, David M. Stothers, and David Mather ornamented with rare beads and mounted on an otter fur collar. Much longer than those of the black bear, the claws provided preeminent symbols of courage and accomplishment for the few people thought to have received power from the bear through a dream or vision. The necklaces were common among the Arikara, Assiniboine, Ioway, Menominee, Mesquakie, Oto, Osage, Pawnee, Ponca, Potawatomi, Santee Dakota, Sauk, and Winnebago (Feder and Chandler 1961; Skinner 1925:129). Bear Symbolism in Rock Art Rock art research was generally neglected in the Northeast until the 1960s and 1970s (Grant 1983:9-10), and thus is not discussed in Hallowell's work. Rock art traditions recorded across northeastern North America contain representational bear imagery apparently widely understood by many different societies. As long-term, in situ cultural artifacts, such art is assumed to have communicative intent (symbols of ideological, cosmological, and/or religious importance) rather than simply a decorative purpose (Diaz-Granados and Duncan 2000:189; Grant 1983:12-13; Lenik 2002:11; Rajnovich 1994:60-61, 159; Salzer 1997:49; Wellmann 1979:162). The similarities, especially in the bear-tracks motif, appear to represent shared concepts of power and respect given to this imposing animal and to communicate messages between the other-than-human being and people in cyclical time. Bear imagery is especially evident in rock art or, more specifically, as petroglyphs (designs engraved in a rock surface by incising, pecking, abrading, scratching, or a combination of these methods) and pictographs (paintings on stone). They are often located on rock outcrops, but also occur on boulders and within caves and rock shelters that may have been used as bears' dens and/or for human habitation (Table 2). Such sites may have functioned as sacred places, with strong public and private aspects, that were visible and accessible to many generations of people. One of the most common bear petroglyph designs in the Northeast is the bear track, which is apparently connected with hunting magic: to facilitate success in hunting or increase the supply of game. Campbell Grant (1967:56) noted that the bear tracks are often associated with other animal tracks, particularly deer and turkey. The track or paw is characterized by a circular motif representing the heel pad, and smaller circular motifs arranged in an arc above the larger circle representing the toe pads (Coy et al. 1997:157). This contrasts with the stylization of representational paw images in Plains rock art, often shown as rectangular paws with long, incised claws (Keyser and Klassen 2001:10, 180), indicative of grizzly tracks (Grant 1967:56). Other petroglyph sites show a simple outlined body form, which in one instance includes a heart line (Wellmann 1979:160, Figure 856), perhaps symbolizing the animal's spirit?a motif commonly seen on Southwestern pottery and also used in the historic period.

Here, the paintings (including deer, bison, moose, turtles, men in canoes, hands, and mythological beings like the Thunderbird and Great Serpent) are attributed to Algonquian-speaking peoples and interpreted as medicine (i.e., communication between the shaman and the manitou) (Rajnovich 1994:10-11). Bear profiles occur on vertical cliff faces above water where the realms of sky, earth, water, and underground meet (Rajnovich 1994:35-36). Postmortem Treatment of Bear Remains Hallowell's study (1926:136-140) provides ethnographic cases from the boreal area of eastern North America involving the special disposal of bear remains to objectify respect and promote good hunting. The post-cranial remains were often hung in a tree, thrown in a river or lake, burned, or buried, while the skull and paws were saved for religious veneration. His brief distributional survey demonstrates the psychological patterning of reverential handling of the bear skull and post-cranial remains evident among the Wabanaki, Montagnais Naskapi, Northern Saulteaux, East Cree, Tete de Boule, Timagami Ojibwe, Timiskaming Algonquin, Plains Ojibwe, Forest Potawatomi, and Menominee. Other Eastern and Central Algonquian groups also participated in such rituals. Among the Canadian Delaware, Wallace (1949:44) states, 'The ceremony [Bear Sacrifice Ceremony] was climaxed by the communal feasting on the slain bear's flesh, following which the bones and other remains were burned in the fire." Owen (1904:55) reported that the Mesquakie also burned the remains: "When it was killed ... they took the body to the encampment, where it was scalped and every portion except the scalp burned. This was</page><page sequence="21">Bear Imagery and Ritual in Northeast North America because the bear is such powerful medicine that, unless one has been killed and burned as a sacrifice, all the animals killed or hurt by the hunter will at once be healed and run away." Although psychological questions were of interest to Hallowell, his dissertation topic did not provide an opportunity to explore them, especially with regard to postmortem ceremonies (Darnell 1977:22). What is the deep underlying motivation of such rites, and how are the practices other than general veneration similar or different? Native peoples were concerned with how the animals around them affected their life. Although an animal was consumed, its soul was considered immortal and wielded such power as to prevent others of its species from being captured by hunters unless appeased by ritually compensating nature (Boas 1914:405; Flannery and Chambers 1985:5; Skinner 1914:203). One must retain the good will (blessings) of the animals through proper rituals for survival (Hallowell 1960). Strict observance of various proscriptions, combined under taboo, was conducted to restore the equilibrium and status quo (Steiner 1956). Taboos functioned to maintain a balance between cultural systems and the world by controlling and channeling human interaction, and by increasing group responsibility (Boas 1910:368; Radin 1920:212; Wallace 1966:106). Each individual was bound by such systems because violation might be disastrous for the entire community (Child and Child 1993:137). Engaging in what is strictly prohibited behavior could result in the disappearance of members of the offended species, leading to starvation or serious illness. Ritual hangings of game animal bones (including bear) in trees or in other elevated places have been documented for the Rupert House band of Swampy Cree, James Bay, Province of Quebec, Canada (Preston 1964) and the Rock Cree of northern Manitoba and Saskatchewan (Brightman 1993). Brightman (1993:119) reports other motivations for the ritual hangings among the Rock Cree, including the fact that they preclude the danger of women stepping over the remains. It also signifies the family's foraging success and industry as a form of conspicuous consumption. In many cases, the reverential disposal of remains was probably implemented to keep dogs (also coyotes, foxes, wolves, and other scavengers) from gnawing or even touching the bones to avoid offending the bear involved (Boas 1910:368; Brightman 1993:119; Preston 1964), which is noted in Hallowell's cross-cultural study. Most historic Great Lakes groups disdained ordinary dogs (Driver 1961:81), perhaps because they were scavengers of carrion and human scraps (Hultkrantz 1981:124) or because they were reared as a common food source and work animal (contrasting with dogs specially reared for sacrifice, eaten in ceremonies associated with warfare or secret society performances, or consumed at clan festivals) (Skinner 1924:53). The widespread scarcity or absence of post-cranial bear remains in the archaeological record is indicative of their reverential disposal. Bear ceremonialism would often exclude the post-cranial remains from the record because they were probably kept together and deposited away from the settlement unlike most other game species. Those elements that are found</page><page sequence="22">Thomas E. Berres, David M. Stothers, and David Mather Table 3. Bear Clans Identified with Historie Groups in the Northeast.

Various scholars have reported that this pattern is suggestive of religious significance (e.g., Guilday et al. 1962:65; Higgins 1990:163-165; Lenik 2002:173; Parmalee 1959:86, 94; Pr?fer and Shane 1970:191; Ritchie 1947:70-71; Volmar 1996:40-41). Bear Clans of the Northeast: Continuity and Variation Historically, bear clans were rather widely distributed among northeast tribal societies (Table 3) (Barbeau 1917:395; Swanton 1979:655). These societies are south of Hallowell's focus of study, the northern Boreal area of North America. This distribution may be partially attributed to the environment, with the black bear formerly flourishing throughout the forested portions of this region. The clan is often named for the totem animal that is considered its guardian spirit, thus taken from local animals with which members have a special relationship. Fairly common forms used to symbolize social groups are mammals (bear, beaver, bison, deer, dog, elk, fox, lynx, moose, muskrat, raccoon, porcupine, wolf), fish (bullhead, catfish, sturgeon), birds (blackbird, crane, duck, eagle, goose, hawk, heron, turkey), turtles, and snakes. The presence or absence and ranking or grading of animals differed from one society to the next (Swanton 1979:655-657). Each clan is different from the others, just as animal species are different (Rosman and Rubel 1995:63-64). A clan is a corporate kinship group whose members are considered blood relatives and claim descent from a common ancestral spirit, but who may not know their precise genealogical relationship. The ancestor may be a phenomenon, plant, or a totemic animal (a bear in this case) that symbolizes the socio-religious unity and identity of the members, distinguishing them from other groups (Fletcher 1911). The clan is a source of power and the most important social entity to which a person belongs. It consists of members of two or more lineages with their specific kinship terminologies, rituals, and symbols used to signify clan identity (Callender 1962:27-31; Hudson 1976:192-193; Tooker 1971:360-362). Admission to secret societies or other ritual organizations was often restricted by clan affiliation (Gill and Sullivan 1992:49). Each clan may be represented by different symbols (Grant 1967:38; Rosman and Rubel 1995:63). For example, power was associated with medicine bundles containing one or more charms, amulets, and fetishes, which were used in clan rituals for many northeast peoples (Child and Child 1993:16-17; Harrington 1914; Rajnovich 1994:123-125; Tooker 1971:362; Volmar 1996:40). Some bear effigies, claws, or teeth found in archaeological contexts may have been associated with such bundles. Skinner (1924:144) reports on the contents of the Bear Bundle of a Prairie Potawatomie bear clan: It is said that the sacred bundle of the Bear clan should contain, besides other articles, several large bone war clubs [sic], grizzly claw amulets, and some bone daggers, called "bear needles." The Bear clan people can and do use porcu pine hairs or bristles to shoot people magically, and some are in the bundle. In</page><page sequence="24">28 Thomas E. Berres, David M. Stothers, and David Mather the bundle also are some dried mukopin or "bear-potatoes." These are used as medicine in doctoring wounds. An acorn is said to be carved on the war clubs, as an emblem of the bears. Bear effigy mounds (along with turtle, bird, lizard, panther, and other forms) are associated with the Late Woodland Effigy Mound culture (a.D. 750-1200/1250) of southern Wisconsin. Bear effigy mounds may have served as symbols of the Bear clan, perhaps linked to the historic Winnebago (see Lathrop 1910:337-339; Radin 1970:50-51). Homage is ceremonially rendered to the special power represented by the totemic animal?Hallowell's (1960) "other-than-human person." Alice Fletcher (1911:260) notes, "The unification and strength of the clan and tribal structure depended largely on the restraining fear of supernatural punishment by the 'totemic' powers." Fear and a need to share its power provided the impetus for special rituals performed before and after killing a bear and the associated taboos concerning the handling of its remains. The bear totem provided a means of closely linking the world of animals to that of humans, with rituals, myths, and stories emphasizing the cooperation and continuity of nature necessary for a balanced, harmonious universe. Bears are credited with the ability to understand human speech, and are often addressed by a kinship term as if it were a relative (Driver 1961:81; Sokolova 2000:122), such as "our grandfather" among the Delaware (Wallace 1949:39). Hallowell (1960) states, "the relation between a human child and a human grandfather is functionally patterned in the same way as the relation between human beings and grandfathers of an other-than-human class." A Fox informant of William Jones (1911:216) described the special relationship with his totem: There is no difference between a bear and one who goes by the name of a bear; both are the same, they are like brothers and sisters... Bears are present at all gatherings of the Bear people; they are not always visible, but yet they are there, and their presence is always felt. Bears, and people of the Bear name, are still brothers and sisters. That is the way the manitou willed it in the beginning, and that is the way it shall always be. Most clans chose their own leaders. The leaders were responsible for internal sociopolitical and religious affairs and acted as representatives to larger sociopolitical units like the village, tribe, or confederacy (Tooker 1971:360 -361). But the prominence of the bear in societies is reflected in the vital leadership roles or functions of bear clans across northeastern North America. They often involved either civil leadership (e.g., Huron, Mahican, Ojibwe, Menominee, and Ottawa) or medicine (e.g., Oneida, Onondaga, and Seneca), although they served both religious and secular leadership roles among the Winnebago (Radin 1970:178, 180).</page><page sequence="25">Bear Imagery and Ritual in Northeast North America The widespread distribution of bear clans with their associated totemic symbols, rituals, and leadership roles provides additional evidence for the prominence of bears in the lives of traditional people in the Northeast. Clans are a reflection of existential reality where there is interdependence between human beings and animals, culture and nature, and social and religious institutions (Willis 1990:6). They also suggest a common geographic origin in antiquity (Barbeau 1917:405; Olson 1933; Tooker 1971), with a range of variation between cultures in time and space. Conclusions One of the most prominent socio-religious traditions in North America was the reverence afforded the bear as noted in the seminal work of A. Irving Hallowell (1926). Hallowell (1926:154) defined it as a stable configuration of customs prevalent among the northern Boreal hunting peoples of Eurasia and North America, with a few individual traits distributed elsewhere to the north and south. This study has shown that bear imagery and ritual were dom inant and enduring across much of the Northeast, thus not geographically restricted as originally defined by Hallowell. Our data does appear to support Hallowell's historical-geographic hypothesis, which purports that bear ceremonialism in North America is the result of the migration of ancient boreal hunting groups from Eurasia and the diffusion of traits from this spreading population. There was a complex of customs common to past cultures that stem from a respectful attitude to the bear including the ceremonial display of the skulls in elevated positions and ritual disposal of post-cranial remains (Hallowell 1926:154). The great variation in the evidence presented in this study indicates that regional and local religions incorporated bears into their symbolic repertoire independently. Such evidence supports Hallowell's (1926:4-5) claims that the utilitarian and psychological aspects of such behavior grew together in each culture, with variation in each area. However, the complex meanings of bear imagery and ritual within each culture, and their changing character, have yet to be fully explored. The types of power acknowledged, and how they were conceptualized by a given culture, were a reflection of the environment, subsistence strategies, and that culture's specific worldview (Comeau 1996; Wallace 1966:110-112). For example, Hallowell found the bear cult was linked strictly to hunting success among the northern Boreal foraging societies. But among Iroquois people, who are agricultural, the healing power of the bear is important. The interdependence between human beings and other-than-human persons characterizes the worldview of most traditional, small-scale societies in the Northern Hemisphere (Casagrande 1952:114-115). Bear ceremonialism, along with numerous other rituals, enabled many traditional peoples to orient themselves in a centered, coherently structured, meaningful universe. The bonds of social cooperation could be strengthened by their public acceptance.</page><page sequence="26">Thomas E. Berres, David M. Stothers, and David Mather Conformity to bear rituals was emphasized and reiterated by community elders as the necessary and proper behavior for continued success in hunting or curing injuries and illnesses, particularly among peoples of the Northeast (Casagrande 1952:117; Radin 1970:180; Skinner 1914:203, Smith 1985:110-111; Wallace 1949:42-43). Thus, they express anxiety over the continuity of the food supply and the realization that taking life is dangerous for humans as well as for the powerful other-than-human beings who inspire and protect all life. Such concerns may explain why reverence afforded the bear remained intact even in the face of acculturation among such groups as the Forest Potawatomi (Salzer 1972), Cayuga (Dodge 1949), East Cree (Flannery and Chambers 1985), Montagnais-Naskapi (Speck 1935), Delaware (Wallace 1949:38), Ojibwe (Casagrande 1952), Huron-Wyandot, and Ottawa (Smith 1985). Bear rituals and beliefs must be protected against skepticism to ensure health and prosperity (see Douglas 1966:174-175). HallowelTs theoretical contributions are highly relevant to the interpretation of Native American religious traditions. Such traditions are real, practical, and collective ways of knowing the world as an intentional, interactive system, where being can be defined as homo religiosus (Morrison 2002:7-8). Scholars must acknowledge the profound differences that exist between religions such as Christianity, and those practiced by Native Americans (Gill 1987:8). The categories of rational thought are different and "we must rebuild the specific content of these categories upon the foundation of their beliefs, not ours (Hallowell 1926:9-10; emphasis in original)." Exploring the complex meaning of Native American religious traditions presents a major challenge to archaeologists and religious scholars alike.
