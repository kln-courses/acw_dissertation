<plain_text><page sequence="1">Rembrandt's Faust in his Study Reconsidered: A Record of Jewish Patronage and Mysticism in Mid-Seventeenth-Century Amsterdam Deni Mclntosh McHenry Rembrandt van Rijn's etching most commonly referred to as Faust in his Study (ca. 1650-53; Fig. 1) has long challenged interpretation. The artist left no record of a title, and there are few pictorial clues as to the exact subject. Consequently, a large body of scholarly literature has been devoted to explaining the specific relationship between the standing male figure in the print and the apparition toward which his gaze is directed. Interpretations have ranged from a discussion of alchemy and magic, to the inspiration of a play after the legend of Dr. Faustus. The most convincing and widely accepted theory to date has been that of Henri van de Waal, who in 1964 associated Rembrandt's etching with the doctrines of a Dutch immigrant religious sect founded by Faustus Socinus.1 After briefly summarizing earlier interpretations, I will challenge van de Waal's argument and propose a new reading of Rembrandt's etching based upon the artist's acquaintance with some of Amsterdam's most prominent Jewish citizens. More specifically, I will argue that the standing figure and apparition, and the nature of their confrontation, conform to contemporaneous debates concerning Jewish mysticism. A rich, first-state impression oí Faust in his Study is owned by the 'ale University Art Gallery.2 The print depicts a male figure who has just risen from his chair to confront an apparition framed in a window. Pointing at a mirror into which the male figure gazes, this apparition displays not a face but rather a disk of concentric circles which, reading clockwise from bottom to top, contain the inscription: INRI ADAM TE DAGLRAM AMRTET ALGAR ALGASTNA The encounter takes place in what appears to be a study, furnished with table, books, papers, reading stand, globe, human skull, and, at the left edge of 9 the image, an embroidered, fringed cloth draped over a rod. Recorded attempts to decipher the precise meaning of the inscription in Rembrandt's print are numerous. 3 In general, however, it is widely accepted that the origin of such an inscription and its method of permutation lie in practices prescribed by the Kabbalah, the doctrinal source of Jewish mysticism. The Kabbalah is an esoteric system of interpretation of the Scriptures that is believed to have been taught by God to the angels. At first handed down through the Jewish patriarchy by oral tradition, the doctrine was eventually written into Jewish scriptures. The Kabbalah attempts to explain such questions as the nature of the Supreme Being, the origin of the universe, the creation and nature of angels, and the destiny of man. 4 To insure the secrecy of its doctrine from the uninitiated, the Kabbalah employs systems by which words are cloaked in numerical values or rearranged to form anagrams. 5 The words created by such permutations were believed to carry special spiritual or mystical significance and were often used as or within prayers. In Rembrandt's circular inscription, for example, the ancient kabbalistic notarikon, agla, appears twice in mirror image. AGLA derives from the Schemone essre, the most frequent prayer in the Jewish rites.6 Debate over the meaning of the inscription was complicated by H. M. Rotermund's discovery of two amulet stamps whose inscriptions are identical to Rembrandt's. Published in Ellen Ettlinger's 1958 article on Faust in his Study, they were taken from amulets belonging to Elias Brackenhoffer (1618-82) of Strassbourg and preserved in Vienna as illustrations to a collector's album. 1 Although the album did not translate the inscriptions on any of the amulets illustrated, it did describe them as a group, as efficacious charms to be worn for protection in battle. Their association with incantation or magic led Ettlinger to interpret Rembrandt's etching as a depiction of a magician in</page><page sequence="2">Fig. 2 Pieter Bruegel, The Alchemist , 1558. Pen and brown ink. Kupferstichkabinett der Staatlichen Museen, Berlin-Dahlem. his laboratory, who has just succeeded in summoning a spirit by means of a spell.8 Two related interpretations oí Faust in his Study derived, in part, from titles given the print in early catalogues. The first of these, a reference to a "practiserende Alchimist" in Clement de Jonghe's 1679 inventory of his collection, has long been supposed to refer to Rembrandt's etching, fueling speculation that the print depicts an alchemist in his laboratory. 9 The second interpretation arose from descriptions of the print as "Dr. Faustus," leading to the identification of the standing figure as the German magician, alchemist, and astrologer, Johann Faust (ca. 1480-1538).10 Throughout the Middle Ages and Renaissance, the practice of alchemy enjoyed considerable popularity and respect. Principally concerned with discovering methods of transmuting base metals to gold and with finding an elixir for prolonging life, it eventually took on connotations of magic and sorcery. By the early seventeenth century, however, alchemy had experienced a decline in prestige with the advent of chemistry as we know it today. 1 1 Accordingly, such Netherlandish artists as Pieter Bruegel (ca. 1525/30-69; Fig. 2) and David Teniers (1582-1649) depicted the alchemist in a typically cluttered and disheveled laboratory, surrounded by the pseudoscienti fie paraphernelia of his trade. Bruegel s drawing presents the most negative view of the alchemist as one who squandered family funds and generally neglected his household. In marked contrast, Rembrandt reduces the elements of his composition to emphasize the confrontation between the standing male figure and the apparition. The tension of this moment is accentuated by the artists exploitation of dramatic contrasts of bright light and deep shadow, resulting in a mood of serious portent quite inconsistent with prevailing attitudes toward alchemy. The alchemical interpretation of Faust in his Study suffers as well from the conspicuous 10 absence of such vital props as the alchemist s fire and bellows, or his glass vials and tubing. The tale of the German magician Dr. Faustus, who sold his soul to the devil in exchange for youth, knowledge, and power, was popularized in the eighteenth century by Goethe. A well-known version by Christopher Marlowe appeared as early as 1588, depicting the doctor as a scoundrel justly condemned to eternal damnation. It has been suggested that a Dutch version of Marlowe's play, performed in Amsterdam in the mid-seventeenth century, served as the inspiration for Rembrandt's etching.12 This theory claims that the print depicts the moment when Faustus' guardian angel intervenes between him and the devil in an attempt to save Faustus soul. As Henri van de Waal has pointed out, however, unlike other seventeenth- century versions of the subject, Rembrandt's image omits both the devil and the guardian angel.1 3 Rightly discounting previous interpretations as inadequate, van de Waal identified the recorded title of "Dr. Faustus" as a reference to Faustus Socinus, the sixteenth-century Italian founder of the Socinian religious sect, and argued that the print was commissioned by Dutch Socinians who had emigrated from Poland in the mid-seventeenth century to escape persecution. ^ Polish Catholic opposition to their presence arose, principally, from their disavowal of the Trinity and their denial of Christ's divine nature, which reduced his importance to the example he set for right conduct. In his article, van de Waal presented a sixteenth- century woodcut by Lucas Cranach as a prototype for Rembrandt's etching.^ Taken from a 1529 German edition of Luther's translation of the New Testament, the print depicts the Evangelist Mathew writing in his study under the inspiration of an angel holding a small mirror. Van de Waal contended that Rembrandt applied the traditional parallel drawn between Luther and St. Mathew as inspired authors to Faustus Socinus as well. And by</page><page sequence="3">claiming that it was a "dangerous venture" in Holland to openly declare membership in the Socinian sect, he proposed that the Socinians had assigned the title of "Dr. Faustus" to the print in order to disguise, but not entirely conceal, the true meaning of the image as a tribute to their founder. l6 Socinus' anti-trinitarian doctrine is presented, van de Waal argued, by Rembrandt's substitution of a monogram of Christ (inri) for the dove, symbolizing the Holy Ghost, in the Cranach woodcut. Completing the comparison between the two images, he further theorized that Rembrandt's etching had been commissioned as an illustration for a Socinian text, just as Cranach s woodcut was for a Lutheran publication. Closer scrutiny of Socinian doctrine and the sect's reception as immigrants in the Dutch United Provinces, however, severely compromises van de Waal's arguments. Commentaries on Socinian doctrine, as set forth in the Racovian Catechism (1605), a collection of Socinus' teachings, reveal sharp differences between it and Lutheran ideology.17 The two depart most dramatically in their approach to the authority of Scripture and the idea of faith. While Luther did not recognize divine authority that was not apprehended by faith alone, Socinian doctrine attempted to establish the authority of Scripture with no appeal to faith whatsoever. In its place, Socinus advocated the use of reason or "rectoe rationis,"18 an intellectual process that recognized proposed truths only insofar as they were adaptable to logical, propositional form. Socinian adherence to an intellectual, rational approach to Scripture differs markedly from Lutheran advocacy of an unqualified belief in Scripture through faith alone. Furthermore, the Socinian emphasis upon reason, rationalization, and truth that could only be extracted through logical systems directly opposes the presence of the 11 apparition in Rembrandt's etching. This enigmatic, incorporeal specter, made more mysterious by the inclusion of a puzzling, kabbalistic anagram, hardly conforms to Socinus' rationalism. Equally tenuous is van de Waal's proposal that inri was appropriate as a Socinian substitution for the Holy Ghost. The four Gospels of the New Testament mention inri as the symbol hung on Christ's cross by order of Pontius Pilate to announce the crime for which he was condemned. Taken from the Latin "Jesus Nazarenus Rex Judaeorum," or "Jesus of Nazareth, King of the Jews," the monogram or entire phrase were frequently included in paintings or prints as part of the iconography of the Crucifixion. As a reminder of Christ's Passion, inri also alluded to the Atonement, or humankind's reconciliation with God through Christ's sacrifice. Socinian doctrine, however, specifically denied the necessity of the Atonement and viewed the burden of sin as something to be left strictly between the individual and God. X9 Finally, van de Waal's argument that the title of "Dr. Faustus" served as a Socinian attempt to conceal the true subject of the print, thereby avoiding persecution, needs substantiation. He was correct in pointing out the ideological challenges facing the sect in Holland.20 During the first half of the century, Dutch Calvinists made numerous attempts to halt the growing influence of the Socinians.21 Typical of the Dutch reputation for religious tolerance, however, enforcement of any official edicts directed against the Socinians and their Dutch Remonstrant and Mennonite sympathizers was largely neglected. In fact, by mid-century Socinianism was spreading rapidly among the Dutch; and Socinian books were being printed, translated, and published in Holland.22 As a result, Faustus Socinus' rationalistic doctrine has been credited with a liberalization of the</page><page sequence="4">Fig- 3 Rembrandt van Rijn, The Angel Leav- ing Tobias and his Family, 1637.

Reformed Church in seventeenth-century Holland.2 3 Given the weaknesses in the magical/alchemical, Faust ian, and Socinian interpretations of Rembrandt's etching, how then are we to attempt to understand the motivating circumstances behind the image? The general subject, after all, was not a new one for Rembrandt. Van de Waal has discussed Rembrandt's attraction to the theme of the scholar in his study, a category to which the etching may be assigned. 24 And as Julius Held has pointed out, the "apparition of a deity to mortals"^ occurs frequently in Rembrandt's oeuvre in such works as The Angel Leaving Tobias and his Family (1637; Fig. 3) and The Evangelist Mat hew Inspired by the Angel (1661). Yet Rembrandt's etching does not conform to his most typical presentations of either theme. While his manipulation of light and shade to create a mood of scholarly reverie or dramatic spiritual visitation is consistent here, most of Rembrandt's scholars remain uninterrupted in their meditation, and his angelic apparitions appear corporeally. Most of the latter, in fact, would pass for seventeenth- century Dutch citizens outfitted in contemporary versions of angelic robes. Faust in his Study, however, presents a scholar who has risen abruptly from his work to confront an apparition that is, but for its pointing hand, vague and incorporeal. Moreover, it includes a mysterious kabbalistic inscription that has defied, rather than invited translation. 12 The indisputable tie between this inscription and the Jewish Kabbalah implicates the Jews of Amsterdam in a definitive interpretation of Faust in his Study. Most accounts of Rembrandt's association with Amsterdam's Jewish community begin with a description of the location of his home along the Breestraat. Rembrandt (1606-69) lived in the "Broad Street" from 1632 to 1636, and again from 1639 to 1658 when the area was populated with successful artists and merchants. Among this group was a large number of well-to-do, aristocratic Spanish and Portuguese Jews who had fled the persecution of the Inquisition to take advantage of religious tolerance in the United Provinces.26 Prints such as Rembrandt's Jews in the Synagogue (1648; Fig. 4) attest to his general interest in this segment of Amsterdam's diverse population. We also know that he enjoyed Jewish patronage through the portraits he created of such prominent personalities as the physician, Ephraim Bonus (1647; Fig. 5).

The Fritz Achelis Memorial Collection, Gift of Frederic George Achelis, B.A. 1907. 1925.124 Jewish citizen of Amsterdam was established with the rabbi and scholar, Menasseh ben Israel (1604-57), whose portrait Rembrandt etched in 1636. Menasseh, who lived opposite Rembrandt on the Breestraat, was the son of a Sephardic Jew who had fled persecution in Portugal.27 He was a precocious scholar who at the age of eighteen had published a Hebrew grammar, the first of a long series of translations and commentaries on Jewish doctrine.28 Menasseh s scholarly reputation was quickly established among both Jews and Christians. A teacher and rabbi at the synagogue in Rembrandt's neighborhood, he opened the first Jewish printing press in Holland in 1627. Its first publication was a prayerbook in the popular miniature format, similar in size to those occasionally held by the subjects of contemporary Jewish portraits, and to the small book in the foreground of Faust in his Study. One of Rembrandt's earliest contacts with Menasseh is represented by the artists Belshazzars Feast (1635; Fig. 6). The painting illustrates the Old Testament account of the prophesy, in the form of a mysterious inscription, of the imminent doom of the Babylonian King Belshazzar. 29 Called in to decipher the divine message, Daniel was finally able to do so by reading it vertically from the upper right instead of horizontally, as is normally done with Hebrew. According to Gary Schwartz, "In 1635, there was only one man in the world who believed that the divine warning to the King of Babylon took exactly that shape: Menasseh ben Israel. "3° Although Schwartz's statement may be extreme in its complete segregation of Menasseh from the rest of the scholarly, rabbinical world, his argument that Menasseh knew the specifics of the secret translation is borne out by a publication of Menasseh 's in 1639. Entitled Determina vitae, the book reproduces exactly the inscription from 13 Rembrandt's painting and includes a detailed solution to the puzzle of its translation. The scholarly consensus is that Rembrandt must have received guidance from Menasseh in the accurate rendering of such an esoteric, kabbalistic inscription. 3 J It is instructive to note here that the character of the apparition in both Belshazzars Feast and Faust in his Study conforms to Jewish doctrine concerning representations of such subjects. In contrast to the common Christian practice of representing God, angels &gt; or spirits in pictorial form, Judaism forbade such illustrations. Adhering strictly to the Second Commandment, it insisted upon the incorporeality of God and all intermediaries as emphasized in the Torah: 'And the Lord spoke to you out of the midst of the fire. You heard the voice of words but you saw no form, only a voice "32 This reference to a voice and words alone is applicable, in fact, to both the painting and the print, which might be said to represent a voice visually by means of an inscription. The Jewish ban upon visual representations of God is demonstrated clearly in yet another, later work by Rembrandt, this one irrefutably connected with Menasseh ben Israel. Menasseh s interest in prophesy, particularly messianic prophesy, culminated in a 1655 publication entitled Piedra Gloriosa. The text combined three Old Testament stories concerning biblical stones that Menasseh interpreted to be symbols of the coming of the Messiah. 33 Rembrandt etched four illustrations for this book, one of which depicts Daniel's vision of the Four Beasts. In the second edition oí Piedra Gloriosa, Rembrandt's original etchings were</page><page sequence="6">replaced by substantially altered restrikes. 34 Significantly, the anthropomorphic form of God in Daniel's Vision was replaced by a halo of light. Clearly a substantial portion of the Dutch Jewish population insisted on adherence to the pictorial restrictions set forth in the Second Commandment. The subject of dress has not been accorded any particular attention in the most recent scholarly discussions oí Faust in his Study. Van de Waal, for example, proposed only that the standing figures dress conforms generally to that of a seventeenth- century scholar. 3 5 Yet this figure, who was described in 1916 as "wearing a traditional Jewish bonet and ... ritual thaleb"36 or prayer shawl, can be more definitively identified as a Jewish scholar or rabbi. Rembrandt had included such a bonet and shawl on the Jewish Pharisee and High Priest in the foreground oíEcce Homo (1636; Fig. 7); and prints commemorating the opening of Amsterdam s synagogues in the mid-seventeenth century depict male Jews with such traditional shawls draped appropriately over their heads. These garments were also worn over the shoulders during daily prayer. 37 Traditionally, the thaleb was white and fringed, with embroidered decoration and black or blue stripes woven into the fabric. 38 This description, which varied little throughout Jewish history or across geographical regions, closely matches the cloth draped over a rod in Faust in his Study. The prominence given to such a garment not only emphasizes the scholars religious affiliation, but alludes to the act of prayer, as well. 39 What, then, is the specific relationship between this Jewish scholar or rabbi and the enigmatic apparition before him? Clearly the answer must lie in the kabbalistic inscription whose anagrams have long puzzled Rembrandt scholars. Kabbalistic amulets, such as the one that appears to have served as the model for Rembrandt's circular inscription, typically contained the names of God and the angels. As van de Waal has pointed out, Rembrandt's inscription includes permutations of the holy word agla, as well as the anagram AMRTET, derived from Tetragrammaton, the Jewish name for God. 4° More obvious is the appearance of adam, who as the first recipient of the Kabbalah was accorded an elevated status in the spiritual hierarchy. Such anagrams were believed to contain a divine essence reflecting the mysterious nature of God. Through their utterance, the initiate of Kabbalah sought to achieve a state of</page><page sequence="7">Fig. 6 Rembrandt van Rijn, Belshazzar's Feast, 1635. Oil on canvas.

Rijksprentenkabinet, Rijksmuseum, Amsterdam. spiritual consciousness and, in fact, to communicate with or summon spirits or angels. 4 I In this context, I must point out that no other discussion of Rembrandt's print has considered the significance of interpreting amrtet as a permutation of the name of the angel, Metatron. ("Metatron" can be extracted by a rearrangement of the letters of amrtet in the same manner as "Tetragrammaton." In this case, however, fewer letters are left out of the original word: amrtet = TETRAgraMmaton, or = METATRon). Metatron was accorded a special position in the hierarchy of angels as the divine scribe and messenger, second only to God.«2 He was, in fact, sometimes described as the visible manifestation of God on earth. 43 If Metatron is the angelic messenger in Rembrandt's etching, his presence is particularly significant because of his close association with mystical prayer that was expected to induce prophesy. Although a wide body of kabbalistic literature had been devoted to methods of prayer in general, mystical prophetic prayer in the seventeenth century was based largely upon the theories of Isaac Luria. Luria was a sixteenth- century Palestinian Jew who believed that the practice of meditation and prayer, over time, would culminate in the appearance of the Messiah. 44 Menasseh ben Israel, whose own interest in messianic prophesy is exemplified in the Piedra Gloriosa, was familiar with Luria's theories. 45 The process of prophetic, kabbalistic prayer began with a meditation upon the divine names of God and the angels in order to achieve an elevation of the soul. As a result, the subject could expect to see "flashes of light" and, in certain stages, would experience a personal identification with the angelic messenger, Metatron, who served as a sort of spiritual guide.46 The Kabbalah defines this experience of a convergence of the spirit of man and angel as one in which a man "sees the form of his own self standing before him and relating the 15 future to him."47 Such a description would account for Rembrandt's inclusion of a mirror held to reflect the face of the Jewish scholar. The kabbalistic term for prophesy through prayer is, in fact, the "Luminous Mirror,"48 symbolizing the concept of a higher form of knowledge achieved through a return to the light that originates from God. Although guidebooks were available to initiate the experience of mystical vision and prophesy through prayer, they were as a rule suppressed or preserved in manuscript form only, most likely in an attempt to insure the secrecy of kabbalistic practices. It is therefore interesting to note that the one book actually published on the subject, Berit Menuhah, was published in Amsterdam in 1648, just prior to the appearance of Rembrandt's etching. 49 Jewish interest in Metatron and prophetic, mystical prayer in the mid-seventeenth century coincided with a doctrinal debate in Amsterdam that may have prompted the appearance of Rembrandt's etching. The antagonist in this controversy, which concerned the verifiability of supernatural occurrences, was Baruch Spinoza, a young Jew who, significantly, was a student of Menasseh ben Israel. Spinoza began to attract attention in the late 1640s as a student at the Portuguese synagogue school behind the Breestraat where Rembrandt and Menasseh lived. His persistent questioning of traditional Jewish doctrine ultimately led him to deny the immortality of the soul; the possibility of divine revelation; and the existence of devils, angels, and all manner of spiritual visitations. 5° Spinoza's</page><page sequence="8">supporters were eventually conflated with their ideological precursors, the Sadducees, who first organized as a sect in the second century, B.c. The Sadducees sought to bring God down to the level of mankind by rejecting all supernatural beliefs. 5 1 In adopting their rationalistic inclination, Spinoza argued the preeminence of natural law and order over divine law. Intense debate and opposition within the Jewish community ultimately resulted in his excommunication in 1656. Spinoza's heretical stance actually represented the culmination of a series of heterodox controversies in Amsterdam. A generation prior to Rembrandt's, Uriel de Costa had twice been expelled for denying the immortality of the soul and divine revelation. Menasseh ben Israel was among those who reacted, at the time, with conviction and immediacy against such views. His publication in 1636 of De Resurrectione Mortuorum (The Resurrection of the Dead) refers more than once to Uriel de Costas opinions. 52 Objecting strongly to Sadducean rationalism, Menasseh cited kabbalistic opinion and current mystical concepts in his defense of supernatural events. There is reason to believe that Menasseh chose a similar method of rebuttal to Spinoza's challenge to Jewish rabbinical authority in the early 1650s. Just prior to his treatise on messianic prophesy, Menasseh wrote a book in Hebrew entitled Nishmat Hayyim. Published in Amsterdam in 165 1, hence contemporaneous with Rembrandt's Faust in his Study, the Nishmat represented a significant departure from Menasseh s earlier work. Although the author had taken a firm stance against the rationalism of the Sadducees and was well acquainted with kabbalistic mysticism, his own publications tended to be rather conservative scholarly commentaries. The Nishmat Hayyim, however, delved so deeply into kabbalistic literature that, according to Menasseh s biographer, "the Jewish scholar was revealed as crassly superstitious. "53 Among other subjects familiar to 16 kabbalistic mysticism, the Nishmat defended the transmigration of souls; the existence of all manner of ghosts, spirits, and angels; and the significance of prophetic dreams and visions. 54 Because of their close proximity in mood, subject, and date, it is tempting if not absolutely conclusive to suggest a connection between Rembrandt's etching and Menasseh s book. Even if Menasseh had not commissioned the print with Nishmat Hayyim specifically in mind, he and his rabbinical circle would certainly have welcomed such an image in the face of an intense debate with the Sadducees over supernatural visitation. Their interest in prophetic prayer and its references to the use of kabbalistic permutations of divine names, the "Luminous Mirror," and angels who act as spiritual guides, would have all found confirmation in Rembrandt's image. Furthermore, the very enigmatic qualities of the print would have satisfied the demands of a doctrine based fundamentally on systems that are deliberately illogical, irrational, and secretive. 5 5 The prints success at closely approximating the spirit and tenets of Jewish mysticism attests to Rembrandt's willingness to accommodate a diverse patronage. As Gary Schwartz's study of Rembrandt's patronage has demonstrated, the artists commissions covered a wide range of oftentimes conflicting ideologies, including those of Remonstrants, Mennonites, Calvinists, Catholics, and Jews. 56 In this process, Jan Bialostocki has proposed that Rembrandt worked within a vocabulary of preferred themes that were adapted, sometimes in very subtle ways, to the particular religious or philosophical expectations of a specific group or individual. 57 Faust in his Study clearly supports such an overview of Rembrandt's oeuvre. While it qualifies for inclusion in such broad thematic categories as the scholar in his study, or a divine apparition, the prints specific</page><page sequence="9">meaning is more accurately located in Rembrandt's response to a particular patron and moment in time. Evidence, at the very least, of the artists professional association with and interest in the Jewish population of seventeenth-century Amsterdam, it is arguably attributable to the patronage of Menasseh ben Israel and the defense of Jewish mysticism.

This is not to imply that Judaism lacks a rich tradition in the pictorial arts. As Kaniel explains, "Judaism does not oppose visual or representational art, which was found even in ancient Jewish houses of worship. Artistic activity was encouraged, provided that it did not lead to idolatry or impair the unsullied belief in a non-corporeal Creator. The artistic embellishment of Jewish ceremonial art was especially encouraged" (11). 33 For a discussion of the messianic message contained in the Piedra Gloriosa, see Henri van de Waal, "Rembrandt's Etchings for Menasseh ben Israel's Piedra Gloriosa, " in Steps Toward Rembrandt (Amsterdam: North Holland Publishing Co., 1974), 115. 34 Ibid., 118, 123. The restrikes of Rembrandt's etchings were altered by Salom Italia, a Jewish book-printer from Mantua, who worked in Amsterdam from 164 1 to 1694 and etched a portrait of Menasseh in 1642. 35 Van de Waal, "Rembrandt's Faust Etching," 7. 36 André-Charles Coppier, "Rembrandt et Spinoza," Revue des Deux Mondes 31 (19 16), 167. 37 Encyclopedia Judaica 15 (Jerusalem: Keter Publishing House Ltd., 1971), s.v. "Tallit." 38 Idem. 39 As this article went to press, I discovered illustrations and a brief discussion of another Jewish liturgical object that relates directly to both Faust in his Study and Belshazzars Feast. Unique to these two images in Rembrandt's oeuvre is the motif of the hand, pointing out a written text revealed through supernatural intervention. This motif was most likely taken from the real-life Jewish practice of using Torah pointers. With few exceptions, these pointers consisted of a gold or silver stem, terminating in a miniature hand with extended index finger. They served to guide the readers eyes through a sacred text, while protecting it from the touch of human hands. Apart from Rembrandt's incorporation of this motif, it is also interesting to note that the standing figure in Faust in his Study holds an implement comparable in size to a Torah pointer. Were this intended to be read as a writing implement, surely Rembrandt would have included the obligatory inkwell in the image. For illustrations and a brief discussion of the Torah pointer, see Jay Weinstein, A Collector's Guide to Judaica (London: Thames and Hudson, 1985), 95; and Cecil Roth, Jewish Art: An Illustrated History, rev. ed. Bezalel Narkiss (Greenwich, Conn.: New York Graphic Society Ltd., 1971), 123, fig. 118. 40 The "Tetragrammaton" is the term for the personal name of the God of Israel, which is written in the Hebrew Bible with the four consonants yhwh, pronounced "Yahweh." See van de Waal, "Rembrandt's Faust Etching," 10; and Encyclopedia Judaica 7, s.v. "Names of God: Divine Epithets." 41 Bernstein, 17. 18</page><page sequence="11">42 Encyclopedia Judaica io, s.v.

"Kabbalah: The Mystic Way." 47 Idem. 48 Also interesting in regard to the Jewish scholar's gaze into a mirror is the significance accorded by the Kabbalah (the Book of Zohar, in particular) to the physiognomy of the face and its reflection of the character of the soul. According to Christian Ginsburg: '"The features of the face change according to the form which is peculiar to the inward face of the spirit. It is the spirit which produces all those physiognomical peculiarities known to the wise; and it is only through the spirit that the features have any meaning. All those spirits and souls which proceed from Eden (i.e. the highest wisdom) have a peculiar form, which is reflected in the face.' {Zohar, ii, 73b) The face thus lighted up by the peculiar spirit inhabiting the body, is the mirror of the soul; and the formation of the head indicates the character and temper of man" (117-20). 49 Encyclopedia Judaica 10, s.v. "Kabbalah: The Mystic Way." 50 W R. Valentier, Rembrandt and S pinoza (London: Phaidon Press, 1957), 19, 20. See also Encyclopedia Judaica 15, s.v.

" 52 Roth, 92, 93. 53 Ibid, 99. 54 Ibid., 98-99. 55 The only aspect of the kabbalistic inscription that does not readily conform to a Jewish interpretation is the four letters at the center of the circle, proposed to be read as inri. If inri refers, as previously mentioned, to the phrase, "Jesus of Nazareth, King of the Jews," must we necessarily infer a Christian, or more specifically a Socinian association? Unlike the traditional Christian "Chi Rho" monogram, the phrase does not, after all, refer to Christ's divinity. Might not the Socinian belief that Christ was not the true Son of God but, rather, an exemplary model of right conduct, be just as easily adapted to a Jewish point of view? 56 Schwartz, in particular 105, 158, 175-76, 181-82. 57 Jan Bialostocki, 'A New Look at Rembrandt Iconography," Artibus H istoriae, 1984, no. 10:9-19. Among other things, Bialostocki discusses his 1957 study in which he suggests that Rembrandt began his creative process focusing upon a "broad encompassing theme" which only later "crystalized into shape as a concrete historical theme" (13). Specific mention of "the scholar in his study" is made in regard to this themes interpretation as "allegories of wisdom, scholarship, or erudition in human or divine matters" (18). Deni McIntosh McHenry, a curatorial research assistant at the Nelson- Atkins Museum of Art, will also be teaching at the Kansas City Art Institute in the fall. 19</page></plain_text>
