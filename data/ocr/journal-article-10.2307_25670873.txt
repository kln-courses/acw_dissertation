<plain_text><page sequence="1">Rock Painting Depicting Re-incursion of Bison onto the South Texas Plains: Painted Indian Cave, Pedernales River, Blanco County, Texas Emily Brock, Charles Hixson, Tom Guilderson, Priscilla Murr, and Marvin W. Rowe We extracted carbon from a sample removed from a small, non-descript, solid monochrome picto graph at Painted Indian Cave site on the Pedernales River, Blanco County, Texas (41BC1). It contains red iron oxide pigment and is approximately 10-20 cm in size. The sample was taken with a surgical scalpel with a new blade. Plasma-chemistry was utilized to extract the organic carbon, without getting contamination from inorganic carbon-bearing minerals, calcite and calcium oxalate. Because the back ground of organic carbon in nearby unpainted rock (limestone) was negligible, the age should be reli able. Further, it is supported by archaeological inference. However, as always with only a single radio carbon date, especially with minimal carbon extracted, caution is advised pending further study. Radio carbon analysis at the Center for Accelerator Mass Spectrometry of the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory indicated an age of 770 ? 50 years BP. The age is consistent with the image of a bison within the small cave. The depiction of the bison probably corresponds with the earliest Late Prehistoric sightings of bison as they re-entered the south Plains of Texas in larger numbers. Keywords: rock painting; plasma-chemical extraction; radiocarbon dating; Late Prehistoric bi son; central Texas Plains The advent of accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS) as a tool for measuring radiocarbon greatly reduced the amount of carbon necessary for analy sis (Bennett et al. 1977; Muller 1977; Nelson et al. 1977) so that we can often get reliable dates even on the extremely small amounts of carbon that can be extracted from rock paintings (e.g., Jensen et al. 2004; Rowe 2001, 2004 and references therein from the Texas A&amp;M University laboratory; Russ et al. 1990; Scott et al. 2005; Steelman et al. 2004, 2005). On the north bank of the Pedernales River in Blanco County of central Texas, there is a small limestone cave (41BC1) called Painted Indian Cave that contains at least ten separate pictographic im ages. The paintings are faded red monochrome that utilize iron oxide (ocher) as pigment. The site is unusual in two ways: (1) no other rock paintings or petroglyphs are recorded in that county and (2) the depiction of a bison there. The paintings are all in red ocher and are about 25 cm or less in size. Depicted are, among otfier images, a bison (shown in Figure 1), three anthropomorphic figures (one of which is illustrated in Figure 2), and geometric Emily Brock, Department of Chemistry, Texas A&amp;M University, P.

All the paintings ap pear to be made from the same, or very similar, paint and were probably painted over a short span of time. Figure 1. Image of a bison at Painted Indian Cave painted with red ocher. The image is approximately 20 cm long. Bison im ages are rare in Texas rock images. Photograph by Dina Newcomb. The cave is a single roughly circular chamber about 9 m in diameter and about 2 m high in the center. One can access the cave by either of two entrances. A meter or so to the west of the larger entrance, which is on the south side facing the river, the second entrance is a crevice about 2 m high. The floor slopes up towards the rear of the cave where it meets the sharply rising back wall. There are no archaeological deposits in the cave. No firm inference could be made a priori about the age of the paintings at 41BC1, except that they are relatively recent. The first clue, the fact that the cave is sometimes flooded by the Pedernales River, in itself argues against great antiquity; one would simply not expect pictographs to survive for millennia. Based on that fact alone, Turpin sur mised that the pictographs there were probably Late Prehistoric to Historic in age (Solveig A. Turpin, personal communication 2004). Furthermore, Ron Ralph (2002) in his State Report, listed the time period of occupation as "perhaps Late Historic". Because the cave has no obviously Historic-age paintings, i.e., horses, churches, etc., Late Prehis toric is preferred here. In addition, the iconogra phy suggested to Turpin that the paintings were not older than Late Prehistoric (Solveig A. Turpin, personal communication 2004). Another clue, es pecially since this is an isolated areal occurrence of rock imagery, was the depiction of a bison. There is copious evidence for the presence of bison in the central plains of Texas during the Late Prehis toric period and more recently (Black and McGraw 1997; Buehler 1997; Creel et al. 1990; Huebner 1991; Quigg 1997; Johnson 1994; Ricklis 1989, 1992, 1996; Ricklis and Collins 1994:181). The depiction of a bison image, then, is consistent with a Late Prehistoric occurrence. We will see that the radiocarbon date we obtained at 41BC1 falls in the Late Prehistoric era, thus supporting the validity of this interpretation for its age. Archaeologists have long considered central Texas an archaeological region separate from oth ers in the state; however, its boundaries have been Figure 2.

Photograph by Dina Newcomb. 200</page><page sequence="3">Brock et al. Bison Rock Painting imprecisely and somewhat arbitrarily drawn (Black et al. 1997). Nearly all researchers agree that the region includes most, if not all, of the eastern Edwards Plateau, as well as the Blackland Prairie to the east and the Ll ano Uplift and the Lampasas Cut Plains to the north. As far as aboriginal rock imagery is concerned, the central Texas archaeologi cal region has more recorded sites than re gions to the north, south, and east (where suitable rock exposures are scarce), but far less than those to the west and southwest. That is not to say that rock imagery sites are common in central Texas, especially when compared to the adjacent Lower Pecos re gion. They are rare in the eastern half of the Edwards Plateau where 41BC1 is located. Most rock imagery sites in the region con tain only a small number of pictographs or, more rarely, petroglyphs, nearly all of which are poorly preserved. Either too few images are available from a regional perspective to establish formal rock imagery styles, as has been done for the Lower Pecos River region (Kirkland andNewcomb 1967; Turpin 1984,1986,1990), or the area has not been sufficiently studied in a com prehensive fashion. In any case, no detailed rock imagery chronology has been attempted for the current study area. Clearly some figurative picto graphs were painted in the larger region during the Historic period because they depict people on horseback or other images showing familiarity with European culture. This is the case for numerous elements at Paint Rock, a major rock painting site in the region located 150 miles northwest of 41BC1 near present-day San Angelo, but the vast major ity of the region's rock imagery cannot be assigned to any particular archaeological time period. Paint Rock probably contains Late Prehistoric rock paint ings as well (Solveig A. Turpin, personal commu nication 2004). Site 41 BC 1 was not included in A. T. Jackson's pioneering survey of Texas rock imagery (Jackson 1938), which listed 57 other sites in central Texas. Nor was it recorded by Forrest Kirkland when he was producing watercolor renditions of rock paint ing panels at many sites in Texas in the 1930s (Kirkland and Newcomb 1967). These omissions Figure 3. Geometric image at Painted Indian Cave painted with red ocher. Each rectangle is about 5 cm high. Photograph by Peter Szabo. are probably due to the fact that these investiga tors went to areas of dense concentrations of rock imagery. The Blanco County Painted Indian Cave (41BC1) had long been a local landmark (Thomp son and Frasier 1996) when Edward Jelks recorded the site in 1950, the first archaeologist known to visit the cave. Later visitors provided the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory (TARL) in Austin with additional drawings and photographs of the pictographs (TARL files). They show little deterioration of the paintings since Jelks took pho tographs of them over a half century ago, even though floodwaters from the Pedernales River have entered the cave on occasion. EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURE Starting over a decade and a half ago (Russ et al. 1990), a plasma-chemical technique was de veloped in the Texas A&amp;M University laboratory for extraction of very minute amounts of organic carbon, permitting prehistoric rock paintings to be radiocarbon dated with AMS (see Rowe 2001, 2004 for a summary of dates through those times). The plasma technique was used here for the date on a red painting from Painted Indian Cave (41BC1), a site west of Austin, Texas, on the north shore of the Pedernales River. 201</page><page sequence="4">PLAINS ANTHROPOLOGIST VOL. 51, NO. 198, 2006 Sample collection The paint sample was collected by Marvin W. Rowe. Rubber gloves were worn during sample collection that involved scraping multiple small samples from the wall with a new scalpel blade. The sample was collected on and wrapped in alu minum foil and then placed into a labeled plastic bag. A background sample was collected in the same way from unpainted rock near the image sampled. The samples were examined critically under light microscope for any impurities. Close inspection revealed small pieces of root and other non-pigment materials, which were removed us ing sterile tweezers; no other pretreatment tech niques were undertaken as they are deemed un necessary in our technique. The red pigment sample and the background rock samples were crushed into a fine powder using a mortar and pestle. The samples were transferred to a sterile container and stored in a desiccator until introduced into the sample chamber of the plasma system. Hedges et al. (1998:36) reported that "the rou tine acid treatment had not dissolved all the ox alate present" in rock painting samples from Ar gentina that had charcoal pigments. Oxalate de posits are common on rock paintings (e.g., Chaffee et al. 1994; Russ et al. 1996, 1999; Rowe and Steelman 2003; Steelman et al. 2002; Watchman 1991). Armitage et al. (2001) also concluded that the traditional acid clean up did not remove all the oxalate minerals from a sample from Guatemala when they used the traditional combustion ap proach for extraction of the carbon to be dated. That means that extreme care should be taken in non plasma-chemical techniques that utilize high temperature combustion after acid-alkali-acid pre treatments for high oxalate samples. With the plasma technique (Hyman and Rowe 1997a, b; 1998 and references therein), the routine acid treat ment is unnecessary. Thus, one of the main advan tages of our technique is that the presence of inor ganic carbon in the forms of carbonates and ox alates does not affect dating results; the plasmas leave those potentially contaminating minerals undisturbed (Chaffee et al. 1994). Plasma-chemical extraction Radio-frequency generated low-temperature (&lt;150?C), low-pressure (1 torr) oxygen plasmas, coupled with high vacuum techniques, were used to remove organic matter from the paint sample leaving the substrate rock and carbonate/oxalate accretions intact. Our early studies established the necessity for cleaning the plasma extraction sys tem with oxygen plasmas before sample insertion to rid surfaces of possible contamination. Then after a sample was loaded into the plasma cham ber, the chamber was evacuated and then ultra-high purity argon was leaked in to a thermocouple pres sure of ~ 0.2 torr (actual pressure ~1.0 torr). Low power (40 watt) argon-plasmas were run on each sample to remove adsorbed carbon dioxide by in elastic collision of the unreactive, but high energy, argon atoms and ions. This process was repeated until the amount of carbon desorbed by the plasma was O.001 mg. This amount of carbon has a small to negligible effect on pictograph age because of the typical AMS backgrounds and the volume of carbon dioxide we collected from the paint sample from 41BC1. Blanks from the Texas A&amp;M labora tory run at the Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organization accelerator mass spec trometry produced results that introduced "a neg ligible amount of modern carbon" ... compared to "our graphitisation process [that] introduces about 0.0009 mg modern carbon." (E. Lawson, Leader, ANTARES AMS Centre, ANSTO, PBM1, Menai, NSW 2234, Australia, personal communication 1998). Samples were then oxidized in a low-tem perature plasma. The gaseous carbon dioxide pro duced by the plasma oxidation of organic material in the charcoal from the paints was collected and its pressure measured after the H20 produced in the plasma reaction was removed by freezing. The carbon dioxide was then frozen at -194?C, sealed into a 6 mm diameter borosilicate glass finger, and sent to the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory's Center for Accelerator Mass Spec trometry facility for 14C analysis of the organic material extracted from the rock paintings. The sample was too small to permit measurement of the 13C; a value for typical wood of 13C = -25%o was used as has been done for almost all our pic tograph dates so far (Rowe 2001, 2004, 2005). The process has successfully (apparently at least, within the range of ages given by the archaeo logical inferences for the samples studied) dated 202</page><page sequence="5">Brock et al.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION Using an oxygen plasma as described above, we extracted organic material from a non-descript red ocher pictograph sample taken at Painted In dian Cave, 41BC1; it yielded an accelerator mass spectrometric (AMS) radiocarbon measurement of 770 ? 50 years BP. Calibration was performed us ing OxCal v3.5 (Bronk Ramsey 2000; based on data of Stuiver et al. 1998). The radiocarbon date and calibration of the pictograph dated here is shown in Table 1. It is impossible to ascertain what image the painter may have had in mind with this painting. However, another image very nearby in the same small cave clearly depicts a bison and has red paint that appears indistinguishable by our visual exami nation (Figure 1). This is an isolated rock painting site in a region where rock imagery sites are rare. The site is further uncommon simply because of the depiction of a bison. Klaus Wellman states in his large compendium on North American rock art (1979:138) that bison are rare in Texas rock imag ery. The site contains only red pigment of the same hue. We saw no evidence of multiple episodes of painting, nor of over-painting. Most likely, the paintings were the result of a single or short paint ing period at this site; thus the paintings are prob ably of similar age. The age of the nondescript pic tograph falls within a period, and a geographic lo cation, well known to contain bison (Buehler 1997; Creel, et al. 1990; Huebner 1991; Johnson 1994; Quigg 1997; Ricklis and Collins 1994). Of these several references, the review paper of Huebner (1991) is of most direct interest for our purposes. He used a combination of "low-tech" presence/ absence data, "high tech" stable isotope analyses, and analysis of historic documents in his synthesis and concluded, "The remains of Bison bison show a dramatic increase in archaeological faunal col lections from sites in southern Texas post-dating 750 BP (ca. A.D. 1200)" (Huebner 1991:343). And further, "Bison populations appear to be wide spread in southern Texas during the Late Prehis toric." ... "Bison exploitation appears primarily in association with the Toyah horizon ..." (Huebner 1991:347). Huebner (1991:351) further states, "It is possible that bison were present in southern Texas prior to 750 BP, but at such low numbers that they have not been recognized in the archaeo logical record." Ricklis (1989) conducted four radiocarbon assays from the Coastal Plain site 41RF21 that pro vide dates on bison availability: 750 ? 100 (TX 6126), 720 ? 190 (TX-6124), 790 ? 70 (TX-6125) and 760 ? 130 (TX-6127). These radiocarbon dates were corrected for 13C. It is not likely to be a coin cidence that these earliest dates for bison flores cence in the southern Plains of Texas statistically overlap with the date of 770 ? 50 BP that we ob tained for the Painted Indian Cave pictograph that appears to be associated with the bison pictograph. It seems likely that the author of the bison picto graph recorded an early sighting of bison in the area. This is the only bison image in Texas radio carbon dated to the Late Prehistoric period. Fur thermore, the known presence ofbison in the Late Prehistoric supports the date of 770 ? 50 years BP that we obtained.
