However, the ability of birds to distinguish between mammal alarm calls has not been investi- gated. Diana monkeys (Cercopithecus diana) produce different alarm calls to two predators: crowned eagles (Stephanoaetus coronatus) and leopards (Panthera pardus). Yellow-casqued hornbills (Ceratogymna elata) are vulnerable to predation by crowned eagles but are not preyed on by leopards and might therefore be expected to respond to the Diana monkey eagle alarm call but not to the leopard alarm call. We compared responses of hornbills to playback of eagle shrieks, leopard growls, Diana monkey eagle alarm calls and Diana monkey leopard alarm calls and found that they distinguished appropriately between the two pred- ator vocalizations as well as between the two Diana monkey alarm calls. We discuss possible mechanisms leading to these responses. Keywords: interspecific communication; anti-predator behaviour; Ivory Coast; primates; associative learning; habituation 1. INTRODUCTION Some mammals have been found to obtain information from the vocalizations of other species. Thus, various pri- mates distinguish between and respond appropriately to the alarm calls of other primate species and of birds, as well as those of conspecifics (Seyfarth et al. 1980; Sey- farth &amp; Cheney 1990; Zuberbtihler 2000a). Some other mammal species have also been shown to respond appro- priately to the calls of potential predators (Zuberbtihler 2000b; Deecke et al. 2002) and of birds (Rasa 1983; Isack &amp; Reyer 1989). Equivalent studies of birds have been more limited. While some birds have been found to respond appropriately to other species' alarm calls (Vieth et al. 1980; Nuechterlein 1981), there have been no stud- ies of the abilities of wild birds to distinguish between the different alarm calls of another species. Diana monkeys (Cercopithecus diana) produce different alarm calls to two of their main predators in West African forests: crowned eagles (Stephanoaetus coronatus) and leo- pards (Panthera pardus) (Zuberbiihler et al. 1997). Yellow- casqued hornbills (Ceratogymna elata) are sympatric with both Diana monkeys and these two predators in many parts of their range. They are among the largest birds in the forest (mass of ca. 2 kg; Kemp 1995) and may be vul- nerable to similar predators to Diana monkeys (mass of 2.2-7.5 kg; Kingdon 1997). Crowned eagles prey on hornbills, although they feed mostly on primates and small ungulates (Keith 1969; Mitani et al. 2001; Shultz 2002). However, leopards feed almost entirely on mammals (Hoppe-Dominik 1984; Ray &amp; Sunquist 2001; Zuber- biihler &amp; Jenny 2002). While leopards do sometimes climb up to the canopy, where hornbills spend much of their time (Bshary &amp; No? 1997), and hornbills occasionally feed on the ground (H. J. Rainey, unpublished data), these are rare events. As eagles prey on hornbills, we predicted that hornbills would respond to their calls. Similarly, as leopards are not thought to prey on hornbills, the birds should not respond to their calls. An appropriate response to a predator, including the production of alarm calls, may benefit both the individual calling and its relatives (Maynard Smith 1965; Charnov &amp; Krebs 1975). Conversely, it would be of no benefit to hornbills to respond to leopard vocaliza- tions if they are not subject to predation by leopards, and could even be costly if their response revealed their pres- ence to another predator (Mougeot &amp; Bretagnolle 2000) or reduced the time available for feeding (Caraco et al. 1980). The most appropriate response of a prey species to the presence of a predator depends on the hunting behaviour of the predator. Eagles and leopards use surprise during an attack (Zuberbtihler et al. 1999b; Shultz 2001). We predicted that hornbills would respond to the presence of a surprise predator by attempting to locate it and monitor its movements, thereby removing the element of surprise and reducing the chances of a successful attack (Curio 1978; Klump &amp; Shalter 1984; Gautier-Hion &amp; Tutin 1988). Hornbills in Ivory Coast mob crowned eagles by calling and approaching the predator (S. Shultz, unpub- lished data). We also predicted that hornbills would pro- duce alarm calls to alert others to the presence of the predator (Frankenberg 1981) or to signal that it has been detected (the 'perception advertisement' hypothesis; Curio 1978). Zuberbtihler et al. (1999b) showed that pri- mate alarm calls deterred leopards from hunting and caused them to leave the area. There is also some evidence that crowned eagles are deterred from hunting on hearing Diana monkey alarm calls (Shultz 2001). As hornbills are often found close to Diana monkeys, sometimes feeding in the same trees, they are likely to hear each other's calls frequently. They may, therefore, associ- ate the two different Diana monkey alarm calls with the presence of the corresponding predators and thus come to respond appropriately. As eagles (but not leopards) are * Author for correspondence (hjr3@st-andrews.ac.uk). Proc. R. Soc. Lond.

MATERIAL AND METHODS (a) Study site H.J.R. carried out the fieldwork in TaY and Mont Peko National Parks, Ivory Coast, between October 2001 and May 2002 inclusive. In Tal, the work was based in two areas: ca. 70 km2 around the Centre de Recherche en Ecologie (5050' N, 7'21' W) and ca. 25 km2 near the Ecotel at Guiroutou (5'24' N, 7'15' W). In Mont Peko, the area covered was ca. 15 km2 in the north of the park near Goenie (7'06' N, 7'16' W). (b) Selecting hornbill flocks The observer located yellow-casqued hornbills during system- atic searching by listening for their vocalizations and noisy wing- beats and occasionally by direct observations (both forests are dense and visibility is limited). To maximize the independence of each playback trial, playbacks were separated spatially by at least 500 m or, if within 500 m, temporally by at least four months to reduce the chance of hornbills becoming habitu- ated to a particular stimulus type. This is a realistic separation as natural predators such as the crowned eagle can attack a sin- gle monkey group several times in a day (Zuberbiihler et al. 1997). We worked at three different sites, and hornbills range and migrate widely both within and between seasons (Poonswad &amp; Tsuji 1994; Holbrook et al. 2002), so, although the hornbills could not be recognized individually, it is highly unlikely that any two trials involved the same individual. (c) Playback protocol Pilot work in Mont Peko found that hornbills have low calling rates, reduced activity and low response rates before 07.00 and after 13.00, so all the experiments took place between these times. When a flock was located, the observer approached to within 50 m so that the vocalization played back was close enough to be of immediate importance to the birds. The speaker was placed at a height of ca. 2 m above the ground to reduce attenuation of the sound. Diana monkeys and both species of predator can be found at ground level (H. J. Rainey and K. Zuberbtihler, unpublished data). The experiment was begun only if there was no predator present and if alarm calls had not been produced by hornbills, primates or other animals in the area within 10 min of the start of recording and if the birds had not responded to the observer's approach. If hornbills noticed the observer they often flew off. Once a hornbill flock had been approached, an adult individ- ual, usually a male, was located and notes were taken of its behaviour. Adult females were selected only if they could be dis- tinguished clearly from immature birds using both vocal behav- iour and plumage (Kemp 1995; H. J. Rainey, unpublished data). We focused on adult individuals, as they were more likely to have experienced interactions between Diana monkeys and predators. Yellow-casqued hornbill flocks consist of small family groups containing at least one adult male and one adult female with one or two immature birds. Occasionally individual birds or pairs were located, and on one occasion a flock of more than 30 birds was encountered feeding on flying ants or termites. In all but six playback tests an adult male was present in the flock and targeted for observations. The following four categories of vocalization were used as playback stimuli: (i) crowned eagle shrieks-15 s of continuous recording; (ii) leopard growls-15 s of continuous recording; (iii) Diana monkey alarm calls in response to a crowned eagle--15 s of recordings containing three calls; (iv) Diana monkey alarm calls in response to a leopard-15 s of recordings containing four calls (this call consists of fewer syllables than the Diana monkey eagle alarm call; Zuberbiihler et al. 1997). Crowned eagle shrieks were obtained from commercial rec- ordings (Chappuis 2001) and leopard growls from the National Sound Archive, London. Diana monkey alarm calls of both types had been recorded by K.Z. in Tai (see Zuberbtihler et al. (1997) for spectrograms of all four stimuli). Eagle shrieks and leopard growls from different individuals were natural sequences each lasting 15 s. We used alarm call sequences from six differ- ent male Diana monkeys; three of these were eagle alarm calls and three were leopard alarm calls. Three or four calls (see above) from an individual calling sequence were selected for each playback exemplar. We used three different exemplars of each category to avoid pseudoreplication (Kroodsma 1989). We carried out a total of 34 playback trials: four in Mont Peko and 30 in Tai. One recording was corrupted and could not be used for analysis although observational data were obtained from this trial. After 5 min of tape recording and behavioural obser- vations, one of the stimuli was played back for a total of 15 s, followed by a further 5 min of recording and observations. Proc. R. Soc. Lond.

(d) Observational notes We noted the times at which the focal individual called, and this allowed us to separate its calls from those of other individ- uals. Yellow-casqued hornbill calls often have resonant harmon- ics and are nasal in tone (see figure 1). As hornbills have noisy wingbeats it was possible to follow their movements even when dense vegetation limited visual observation. We made notes on the focal bird's movements with respect to the playback site and on the behaviour before and after playback. Classification of movement as being towards or away from the playback site was based on the first movement between branches or trees (rather than along a branch). The rationale for this was that, as greater effort is generally needed to move between branches than along a branch, such movement would be more likely to relate to the stimulus. The direction of movement was classed as being in the 180' segment towards or away from the playback site. In fact, almost all movements were at a narrow angle to the playback site. (e) Equipment The stimuli were played back from a Goodmans GCD506R CD player through a Nagra DSM loudspeaker amplifier. Peak amplitudes of each stimulus were standardized at ca. 95 dB with a Tenma Sound Level Meter 72-6604, A-weighting, at 1 m from the speaker. Audible responses were recorded using a Sony WMD6C Professional Walkman with a Sennheiser ME66 microphone. MINITAB 12 was used for statistical analysis. Rec- ordings of calls were displayed as spectrograms with Avisoft- SASLAB PRO V. 3.9 on which individual calls could be counted. 3.

Post-hoc non-parametric multiple comparison (Zar 1999) showed that hornbills called significantly more after play- back of eagle shrieks than after playback of leopard growls (Q4 = 8.22, n = 11,7, p &lt; 0.001). Similarly, hornbills called significantly more after playback of Diana monkey eagle alarm calls than after playback of Diana monkey leo- pard alarm calls (Q4 = 8.39, n = 8,7, p &lt; 0.001). (b) Locomotor behaviour As figure 3 shows, hornbills approached the playback site significantly more often in response to playback of eagle shrieks than playback of leopard growls (Fisher's exact test: n = 12,7, p = 0.03). Hornbills also approached the playback site more often in response to playback of the Diana monkey eagle alarm call than the Diana monkey leopard alarm call (Fisher's exact test: n = 8,7, p = 0.006). No differences between approaches to eagle shrieks and Diana monkey eagle alarm calls (Fisher's exact test: n= 12,8, p = 0.26) nor between approaches to leopard growls and Diana monkey leopard alarm calls were found (Fisher's exact test: n = 7,7, p = 1; figure 3). 4. DISCUSSION Our results indicate that yellow-casqued hornbills dis- tinguish between predator vocalizations and between the corresponding alarm calls of the sympatric Diana monkey. Both vocal and locomotor responses of hornbills to play- back of eagle shrieks and Diana monkey eagle alarm calls were significantly different from the responses to playback of leopard growls and Diana monkey leopard alarm calls. This is the first time, to our knowledge, that a bird has been shown to distinguish between the alarm calls of any other species and the first time that they have been found to distinguish between mammal calls of any type. The Proc. R. Soc. Lond. B (2004)</page><page sequence="4">758 H. J. Rainey and others Hornbills can distinguish between primate alarm calls result is particularly intriguing as the two Diana monkey alarm calls are acoustically very similar (see Zuberbtihler et al. 1997). Our sample sizes were small, and the statistical analyses may have had low power to detect significant results (Thomas &amp; Juanes 1996). However, we had matched con- trols (eagle to leopard and Diana monkey eagle call to Diana monkey leopard call), which also had small sample sizes, yet the effects were still significant. This indicates that, despite this low power, the responses varied between the different playback categories. We could not test for a difference between the responses of male and female horn- bills to the different stimuli as sample sizes were too small. However, both sexes exhibited all types of response so it is probable that they respond similarly. The hornbills also showed similar variation in responses to the four trials in Mont Peko and this indicates that, despite the small sam- ple size, the responses here were representative. The 'perception advertisement' hypothesis (Curio 1978) suggests that animals may produce alarm calls when they detect a predator because this indicates to the pred- ator that it has been detected and that it has lost the element of surprise. An attack would therefore probably fail, and the predator would best abandon the attack. This may explain the tendency of hornbills, and of primates (Gautier-Hion &amp; Tutin 1988; Zuberbtihler et al. 1997), to approach the predator as it demonstrates more clearly to the predator that it has been located. There were indi- cations that hornbills tended to approach the playback site more often after playback of Diana monkey eagle alarm calls than after playback of eagle shrieks (figure 3). This difference was not significant but could indicate that, because alarm calls unlike predator calls do not indicate the precise location of the predator (Van der Veen 2002), the hornbills may best locate the predator by approaching the alarm call. This may help the bird to decide in which direction to flee or whether or not to mob the predator. It is therefore possible that hornbills are advertising per- ception to the predator (Curio 1978) and that the alarm signals may not be directed at kin (Maynard Smith 1965). How do hornbills acquire the ability to distinguish between the four different types of vocalizations? Animal learning theory offers a number of mechanisms that may be responsible for the birds' knowledge. First, many mature birds will have experienced attacks by crowned eagles, either directly or indirectly by observing other nearby individuals being attacked. As both eagle shrieks and Diana monkey eagle alarm calls reliably predict the presence of a crowned eagle in the immediate vicinity, both stimuli will quickly become associated with eagle presence through associative learning. Second, young birds may learn to respond to the eagle shrieks and Diana monkey eagle alarm calls by observing other, more experi- enced, flock members reacting to these calls, even in the absence of direct contact with the predator. Observing other individuals engaging in anti-predator behaviour is a powerful stimulus and a reliable source for rapid learning (Curio et al. 1978; Vieth et al. 1980; Frankenberg 1981). As leopards do not attack hornbills, no such learning will take place, and consequently both leopard growls and Diana monkey leopard alarm calls will not come to elicit responses in hornbills. An alternative hypothesis states that hornbills will call spontaneously in response to any loud stimulus, but through individual experience they selectively habituate to those stimuli that do not predict the presence of a species that preys on them (i.e. leopard growls and Diana monkey leopard alarm calls; see Deecke et al. 2002). Our findings suggest that eagle shrieks and Diana mon- key eagle alarm calls are functionally equivalent for horn- bills (Schusterman &amp; Gisiner 1997), in the sense that they both predict the presence of a crowned eagle. But are they linked to a mental representation of the predator, as has been claimed for non-human primates (Zuberbtihler et al. 1999a)? We can say little yet about the mental processes that underlie the birds' responses. What is remarkable is that, although the acoustic differences between the two types of Diana monkey alarm calls are very subtle, the hornbills respond differently to them, demonstrating how active these animals are in their pursuit of important infor- mation, to the extent of eavesdropping on signals that are not intended for them.
