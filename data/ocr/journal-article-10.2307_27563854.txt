<plain_text><page sequence="1">A Sourcebook of Nasca Ceramic Iconography: Reading a Culture through Its Art. Donald A. Proulx. Iowa City: University of Iowa Press, 2006. 236 pp. KEVIN J. VAUGHN Purdue University Throughout his nearly 40-year career, Donald Proulx has been anthropology's foremost expert on Nasca iconogra phy. This book, an incredible resource for students and pro fessionals, represents the culmination of this long career. The goal of the book is to describe and explain the major themes of Nasca iconography. Although he uses it to order the ceramic art chronologically, in this book Proulx does not provide a detailed description of the partially published "Dawson seriation" that most Andeanists use. Presumably (and this reviewer hopes), this is the next big project. The book is divided into six chapters and includes over 300 illustrations and 40 full-color plates. It is care fully edited and well indexed. Chapter 1 provides a brief introduction to the Nasca culture. Proulx writes clearly,</page><page sequence="2">Single Reviews 777 and the general reader will get a good sense of ancient Nasca with this introductory chapter. Chapter 2 provides a summary of Nasca pottery technology and its major canons. In chapter 3, Proulx provides a very useful histori cal context including discovery of the Nasca style and the efforts that professionals have made to place the pottery into a coherent chronology. The historical context provided gives perspective on how long enthusiasts have been study ing Nasca pottery without a comprehensive resource mak ing the current publication all the more important. While Proulx's focus is not on seriation, the detailed description of each phase of the Dawson seriation is tremendously valu able. Chapter 4 is a discussion of the various approaches to the interpretation of Nasca art, including art his tory, archaeology, ethnographic analogy, and comparative mythology. The bulk of the book is found in chapter 5, a de scription and interpretation of the major themes in Nasca iconography. The chapter is 130 pages long (making up more than half the length of the book) with 324 fig ures; it is a tour de force of the 40 major motifs found in Nasca art. Any researcher of Nasca ceramic iconogra phy is struck immediately by the complexity of the an cient art. Proulx's categorization of these major motifs into 325 precise subvarieties is a testament to this complex ity. Each subvariety is given a descriptive name that can be somewhat cumbersome (e.g., "The Spectacled Prolifer ous Anthropomorphic Mythical Being with Full Signifier" and "Mythical Spotted Cat with Anthropomorphic Mythi cal Being Features") and a code (e.g., AMB-6-A-2 and SC 6, respectively), and is described including the elements of the form, the phases in which each are found, and an interpretation of the major themes. The interpretation of each major theme (e.g., the Killer Whale and the "Horrible Bird") is very helpful. Each subvariety is illustrated with a full description. The illustrations are spectacular, but I was a bit disappointed to find that they were not labeled with the phase to which each dates, as this would have been valuable. The concluding chapter called "New Insights on Nasca Society" is an attempt to reconstruct Nasca society based on the iconography deciphered in this book by relating it to what we find in the archaeological record. Proulx chooses to focus on several issues but, not surprisingly, the major em phasis is on Nasca religion, as this is the predominant theme featured in the iconography. As a specialist, I found my self disagreeing with some of his conclusions. For example, his interpretation of Cahuachi as an empty ceremonial cen ter does not take into account more recent interpretations by field archaeologists who currently work in Nasca. Fur thermore, given the recent spate of archaeology conducted in the region, in my opinion, archaeological approaches to understanding Nasca art could have been emphasized in greater detail. This was surely not an oversight by Proulx, the editors, or the reviewers but, rather, a function of the length of time it takes to publish a monograph like this, preventing the incorporation of recent fieldwork. Despite these minor quibbles, this book will be an ex ceptionally valuable resource to practitioners and students of Nasca archaeology. It is an essential addition to the library of all Andeanists and any student of ancient art. Proulx writes accessibly to both the general reader as well as to the specialist and has produced a beautifully illustrated vol ume rich with description of the complex iconography of this pre-Hispanic culture.</page></plain_text>
