<plain_text><page sequence="1">Theories from Elsewhere. Donna Haraway. The Haraway Reader. New York: Routledge, 2004. viii + 352 pp. $27.95 pbk. From technophobes and phallocrats to posthuman postfeminist cyborgs and clones, the alien terrains of Haraway's theoretical journeys are populated with wondrous aliens, daring collective-action protagonists, maddening scientists, and unwitting dupes to the patriarchal system; the latter group, we quickly come to realize, usually includes ourselves. Even her cross-species companions (the less enlightened term being "dogs") have a critical role to play in the infiltration of the omnipresent reality-constructing narratives of the biological sciences. Continually navigating the demilitarized zone between science and culture, Haraway always seems to locate what philosopher Michel Serres terms that "rare and narrow passage" between the hard sciences and the sciences of "man" where cultural critique prospers (Hermes: Literature, Science, Philosophy, ed. Josue V. Harari and David F. Bell [Baltimore: Johns Hopkins UP, 1982], 18). Haraway's playfully erotic and ironic titles set the stage and standard for what might be called "(self-)reflective/slash theory." Included in the current volume are a vast array of Haraway's most influential and intriguing works. The Haraway Reader begins with the foundational, and often cited, "Manifesto for</page><page sequence="2">BOOKS IN REVIEW 183 Cyborgs" (1985, rev. 1991) where she laid the foundation for a (post-) feminist (post-) human; and capping off the collection is an interview conducted in two parts by Nina Lykke, Randy Markussen, and Finn Olsean playfully entitled "Cyborgs, Coyotes, and Dogs: A Kinship of Feminist Figurations and There Are Always More Things Going on Than You Thought! Methodologies as Thinking Technologies" (2004). These two very different, yet strangely similar, discourses on the posthuman frame a fantastic collection of essays that explores the range and depth of Haraway's intellectual journey through postmodemism and postmodern science. "Ecce Homo, Ain't (Ar'n't) I a Woman, and Inappropriate/d Others: The Human in a Posthuman Landscape" (1992), "The Promises of Monsters: A Regenerative Politics for Inappropriate/d Others" (1992), and "Otherworldly Conversations; Terran Topics; Local Terms" (1995): each of Haraway's writings in its own way interrogates transgressive subjectivities within the dominant framework of oppressive patriarchy and the ability of individuals and collectives to create (or discover) fresh ground from which to speak. Two essays directly address the anthropomorphic essentialism of zoology and genetics via forays through the American Museum of Natural History in New York City and the impulses of primate studies: "Teddy Bear Patriarchy: Taxidermy in the Garden of Eden, New York City, 1908-1936" (1984-1985) and "Morphing in the Order: Flexible Strategies, Feminist Science Studies, and Primate Revisions" (2000). The remaining selections-entitled "Race: Universal Donors in a Vampire Culture: It's All in the Family: Biological Kinship Categories in the Twentieth-Century United States" (1995); "Modest_Witness @Second_Millennium" (1999); and "Cyborgs to Companion Species: Reconfiguring Kinship in Technoscience" (2004)-further expand the potential for posthuman and postgender transfigurations. (Haraway later rejects the term "postgender" in "Cyborgs, Coyotes, and Dogs.") Haraway's almost alien use of language not only defies traditional summary, but also belies the conflicting impulses of the scientist, the philosopher, the linguist, and the feminist, to name a very few of the discourses that she actively disassembles and reinvents in new configurations. She channels her theoretical journeys to Elsewhere and back for the reader so that we travel with her through potentialities of subjectivity that create the context for a grand out-of-body experience, where our vision is turned back on the made-world, re-made now unfamiliar and strange through altered perspective. As Michel Foucault's reading of Jeremy Bentham's panopticon has dominated his other critical concerns, so has Haraway's feminist cyborg become the 300-pound gorilla of technology-based posthumanism in sf criticism. This is not to question the merits or importance of "Manifesto for Cyborgs." In fact, as all the references to her essay suggest, Haraway's cyborg is a natural match for sf criticism and theory, since it draws deeply from the wellspring of both science theory and prospective fiction. It is unfortunate, however, that Haraway's other trains of thought are currently under-represented in sf studies when the potential application of her full body of work demonstrates great promise for interpretations of sf both as the proponent of particular scientific</page><page sequence="3">184 SCIENCE FICTION STUDIES, VOLUME 33 (2006) discourses and as culturally transgressive narratives. Her ironic engagement with science and fiction opens the door for myriad critiques of these as mutually supporting myth-making enterprises. Haraway's work-particularly as collected and presented in this volume-is at the very thin edge of the razor where so- called "fact" and "fiction" meet. In fact, her most common argument in the essays included in this volume is that the narratives of science are fictions. The very best of science fiction (she most often refers to authors such as Vonda McIntyre and Octavia Butler) does not simply propagate science theory but, rather, speaks to the nature of science as a grand phallocratic nightmare of our culture and an all-inclusive oppressive force in need of critique. Haraway's continually developing thought is a wonderfully noisy repository for future sf criticism, and through her re-vision we become our own revealing multi-faceted mirror. The best theorists, whether they look forward or back, have always served as fertile soil for the creative writer, and Haraway is arguably the best theorist of the biological sciences and certainly the most consistently radical and far- seeing. It would not be inappropriate to refer to Haraway as a science-fiction writer; nor, I think, would she be offended by the title. Take, for instance, a typical phrase from "Otherworldly Conversations ": "They had enough problems with all those heavy metals and organic solvents in those lakes without having to take sides in our ideological struggles too. Forced to live in our ethno-specific constructions of nature, the birds could ill afford the luxury of getting embroiled in what counts as natural for the nearby community" (129). Or consider this passage from "Modest_Witness": "Time and space organize each other in variable relationships that show any claim to totality, be it the New World Order, Inc., the Second-Millennium, or the modern world, to be an ideological gambit linked to struggles to impose bodily/spatial/temporal organizations" (241). At every turn the manifestations of her alien/ating language reveal our bodies, our world, and our universe to be a construction of narrative. This volume is not only the best possible introduction to the depth of Haraway's influential work, but also an homage to the breadth and permeability of her "elsewhere" into everyday life. Hers is a living viral text that permeates and inhabits every body it meets. For the reader coming fresh to Haraway's against-the-grain journey through the post-enlightenment world, consider The Haraway Reader the essential introduction to the most representative texts astutely chosen both for their past influence and their ongoing impact on cultural studies.-C.
