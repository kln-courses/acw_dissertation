Author for correspondence: Salvatore Cozzolino, cozzolin@unina.it Abstract An exceptionally wide range of systematic data has been accumulated on subtribe Orchidinae, which dominates the European orchid flora. Despite (or perhaps because of) this wealth of information, delimitation of genera within the subtribe continues to prompt extensive debate among taxonomists. Here, we use the controversial genus Orchis s.l. as a case-study to explore the broader issues that surround the definition and circumscription of genera, and suggest a new approach to selecting among competing formal classifications that focuses on the biological cohesion of the resulting taxa. Levels of postzygotic reproductive isolation, assessed as differential embryo mortality through extensive artificial crosses between species, are compared with three taxonomic treatments: a pre-cladistic morphological classification permitting polyphyly; a cladistic classification generated by applying monophyly to Internal Transcribed Spacer sequences; and a 'post-cladistic' classifica- tion that aimed to compromise between morphological and molecular differences and permitted paraphyly. The monophyletic cladistic classification is by far the most consistent with levels of postzygotic isolation through embryo mortality. Reproduc- tive isolation, sequence divergence and morphological similarity can all usefully be quantitatively compared with formal classifications, though floral morphology in orchids offers a high risk of rapid co-evolutionary divergence with pollinator guilds, often generating spurious monospecific 'genera'. Best practice in taxonomy reflects reciprocal illumination between key biological datasets and formal classifications, pursued in a rigorous framework of precise definitions of taxa and well- founded evolutionary-phylogenetic concepts.

The frog remains. (J. Rostand, quoted in F. Jacob, The Possible and the Actual) Relationship between species concepts and taxonomy. - Although much controversy surrounds the question of which kind of entity constitutes the most fundamental unit of evolution (current opinions range from individual organ- isms through populations and metapopulations to entire spe- cies), there is general agreement among systematists that the species is the fundamental unit of taxonomy and formal classification, at least for eukaryotes. However, no topic has prompted more heated debate during the last three centuries than how best to define a species, resulting in a plethora of species concepts (e.g., Hey, 2001; Pigliucci, 2003; Rieseberg &amp; al., 2006). Mayden's (1997) detailed review identified no fewer than 26 species concepts and several more have since been described. Bateman &amp; al. (2010) recently argued that, at least for higher plants, this multitude of species concepts can usefully be distilled into just three basic practical approaches useful for taxonomical purposes: (1) Assessment of similarity (hereafter referred to as simi- larity). Similarity in morphological appearance has been the mainstay of systematic biology for most of its history, typically assessed by comparing 'unknowns' found in the field with named specimens held in herbaria. The recent molecular genet- ics revolution offers the opportunity of obtaining selected DNA sequences from 'unknowns' and comparing them statistically with 'knowns' held in databases such as GenBank; this process, termed DNA barcoding (e.g., Hollingsworth &amp; al., 2009), also effectively relies on overall similarity, but this time in base-pair sequences rather than morphology. (2) Estimation of reproductive isolation levels among members of related biological groups (hereafter referred to as reproductive isolation). Reproductive isolation lies at the root of various 'biological' species concepts (e.g., Coyne &amp; Orr, 2004). These were diversified and popularised as a result of the 'modern synthesis', using genetic data to infer the amount and nature of gene flow that had occurred between individuals, populations and/or species in their recent past. An alternative, though arguably complementary, approach is to directly meas- ure present gene flow, through field observations of pollination to assess premating gene flow and/or experimental crossing to assess postmating gene flow. (3) Discovery of monophyletic groups (hereafter referred to as monophyly). A monophyletic group encompasses all of the known descendants of a single presumed ancestor. Employ- ing monophyly as a taxonomic criterion relies on the recent 1754</page><page sequence="2">TAXON 59 (6) • December 2010: 1754-1764 Scopece &amp; al. • Testing generic delimitation in Orchidinae enthusiasm for building evolutionary trees from quantified data matrices representing morphological characters or, more often, DNA sequences. By using the definition of a clade as a group of biological entities that encompasses all known de- scendants of a single presumed ancestor, formalised within the explicit framework of a repeatedly dichotomous tree (e.g., Hen- nig, 1966), monophyly at least superficially appears relatively objective. Bateman (2009) suggested the following protocol of prioritised stages for converting a phylogeny into a formal classification: (a) recognise only monophyletic groups; (b) di- vide the tree at comparatively robust branches to provide both equality of support for taxa of equal rank and stability of the overall classification; (c) minimise the proportion of branches requiring more than one change of rank; and (d) minimise the need to create new Linnean names or create new combinations of existing names. All three approaches described above are constantly vul- nerable to the criticism, universal in science, that insufficient data have been collected to ensure that reliable conclusions are drawn. Moreover, all three approaches require decision-making on the part of the taxonomist. At the species level, how much similarity is required for two individuals to be considered conspecific? What level of reproductive isolation can be per- mitted if two individuals are to be considered conspecific? Or which branch in a phylogenetic tree should be labelled as constituting a speciation event? Most importantly, there is no guarantee that these three approaches will yield congruent re- sults, thereby forcing the taxonomist to prioritise them when delimiting taxa. It is this dilemma that lies at the root of the present study, though for practical reasons we have chosen to focus primarily on the circumscription of genera rather than species. Although some systematists regard genera and other supraspecific ranks as wholly artificial constructs, we perceive the practical challenges of delimiting species and delimiting genera as comparable and relying on the same categories of biological data. Genera should possess sufficient biological cohesion to be strongly predictive of the biological properties of their constituent species. Dynamic taxonomy of Orchidaceae subtribe Orchidinae. - Factors that have placed the orchid family at the forefront of conceptual debates in taxonomy and evolutionary biology include its global distribution, exceptional species diversity, distinctive floral morphology (and its consequent horticultural importance), and strong co-evolutionary relationships with both pollinators and mycorrhizal fungi (e.g., Dressier, 1993; Pridgeon &amp; al., 1999; Rudall &amp; Bateman, 2002; Jersaková &amp; al, 2006; Waterman &amp; Bidartondo, 2008). These factors have led to an unusually large number of orchid aficionados, both professional and amateur. In addition, although angiosperm- wide molecular phylogenetic classification has thus far reached down to the level of family (APG, 1998, 2009; Qiu &amp; al., 1999), studies in a few especially favoured angiosperm families have recently graduated to the level of genus; Orchidaceae is one such family (Bateman &amp; al., 1997, 2003; Aceto &amp; al, 1999; Cameron &amp; al, 1999; Chase, 1999; Freudenstein &amp; al., 2000; Kores &amp; al., 2001; summarised in Pridgeon &amp; al., 1999 et seq.). The impressive volume of data and publications have prompted strong debates between proponents of phylogeneti- cally based classifications and systematists who advocate other approaches, the majority seeking to preserve greater propor- tions of classifications that preceded the molecular cladistic revolution. Nowhere have these debates been more intense than in the classification of subtribe Orchidinae (Fig. 1), which dominates the temperate Eurasian orchid flora (e.g., Pridgeon &amp; al., 2001). Many contributions of varying degrees of conceptual rigour have been made to the discussion in the 13 years that have elapsed since the first reasonably well-sampled DNA- based phylogenies of the subtribe were published (Bateman &amp; al, 1997, 2003; Pridgeon &amp; al., 1997; Aceto &amp; al., 1999; Coz- zolino &amp; al., 2001). The most recent challenge to be issued, by Tyteca &amp; Klein (2008), expressly rejected the pre-eminence of monophyly and instead attempted a compromise classification that balanced several kinds of taxonomic information. This contribution attracted a rapid, detailed and critical response from Bateman (2009), who restated in greater detail and more explicit terms the conceptual justifications underpinning the monophyletic genera delimited by Bateman &amp; al. (1997, 2003). Systematically addressing each contentious genus, Bateman (2009) concluded that the majority of the disagreements oc- curred when molecular data suggested that a supposedly unu- sually morphologically distinct genus, containing one or at most a modest number of morphologically similar species, is shown by molecular data to be phylogenetically nested within a more species-rich and morphologically diverse genus, render- ing it paraphyletic and thus forcing amalgamation of the two former genera. Examples include the inclusion of Coeloglos- sum within Dactylorhiza, Nigritella within Gymnadenia, and Aceras within Orchis. The genus Orchis as a case study. - The most extensive generic redelimitations, required to accommodate molecularly perceived monophyly, concerned what is most commonly (but wrongly) described as the 'traditional' genus Orchis. In fact, as detailed by Vermeulen (1947) and Bateman &amp; al. (1997), the spectrum of species placed within the genus Orchis has constantly waxed and waned, often radically. Orchis was first described by Linnaeus (1737, 1753) but was soon profoundly redelimited by several authoritative treatments early in the nineteenth century (Swartz, 1800; Brown, 1810, 1813; Richard, 1818). If there was ever a period of relative genus-level stabil- ity in Orchidinae, it extended only from Vermeulen (1947) to what was effectively the reproduction of Vermeulen's earlier work in the highly influential Flora Europaea (Moore, 1980). The main problem presented by the 'traditional' circum- scription of Orchis (sensu Vermeulen, 1947; Moore, 1980) is that molecular phylogenetic data clearly show it to be triphy- letic, separated by several other morphologically and molec- ularly distinct genera that are comparatively uncontentious (Ophrys, Serapias, Himantoglossum, Stevenielld) and placed phylogenetically immediately above the genera Traunstein- era, Chamorchis, Pseudorchis, Platanthera, Gymnadenia and Dactylorhiza. In order to achieve monophyly of all genera of Orchidinae, Bateman &amp; al. (1997) redelimited a monophyletic Orchis s.str. but transferred about half of its species to other 1755</page><page sequence="3">Scopece &amp; al. • Testing generic delimitation in Orchidinae TAXON 59 (6) • December 2010: 1754-1764 genera, apportioning some to the genus Anacamptis s.L, which had previously contained only the reproductively specialised lepidopteran-pollinated A. pyramidalis, and the remainder to the genus Neotinea s.L, which had previously contained only the reproductively specialised autogam N. maculata. This molecularly supported fusion of supposedly morphologically disparate species continues to cause considerable controversy, despite subsequent support for the redelimited genera from ontogenetic, micromorphological (e.g., Barone Lumaga &amp; al., 2006; Gamarra &amp; al, 2007) and, most pertinently, natural hy- bridisation data (e.g., Klein, 2004; Kretzschmar &amp; al, 2007; Tyteca &amp; Klein, 2008). Bateman &amp; al. (1997) considered further dividing the pared-down Orchis s.str. into two genera, separating off the O. máscula, O. spitzelii and O. quadripunctata groups as a new genus in order to leave Orchis sensu strictissimo (s.ss.) repre- sented only by species with anthropomorphic flowers, such as O. simia and O. anthropophora (the former genus Aceras). They eventually rejected this option because (1) the available molecular data suggested paraphyly of the anthropomorphic Orchis species (O. anthropophora and O. italica appeared to be sequential sisters to all remaining species of Orchis s.str.: Fig. 2), and (2) the molecular branches within Orchis s.ss. were shorter than those subtending bona fide genera of Orchidinae (Bateman, 2007, 2009). However, genus-level separation of these two species groups (treated as subgenera by Kretzschmar &amp; al., 2007) was formally and repeatedly advocated by Tyteca &amp; Klein (2008, 2009), who assigned the non-anthropomorphic species of Orchis s.str. to their new genus, Androrchis. Present study: reproductive isolation as a test of for- mal classifications. - Here, we use the ongoing taxonomic controversy surrounding Orchis s.L to explore and promote a new test of the relative strengths of competing classifications - one that gives a more prominent and explicit role to estimated levels of reproductive isolation. Specifically, operating within a phylogenetic framework, we have combined artificial cross- ing experiments with comparable data from the literature to quantify levels of postzygotic isolation among a substantial sample of the species encompassed within Orchidinae, in order to address the following questions: Fig. 1.

(1) Is the difference in average levels of reproductive iso- lation between intrageneric and intergeneric crosses greater in the competing monophyletic (Bateman &amp; al., 1997, 2003) or 'traditional' non-monophyletic (Vermeulen, 1947; Moore, 1980) generic circumscriptions of Orchis, Anacamptis and Neotineal (2) Is there a difference in levels of reproductive isolation between and within the putative genera Orchis s.ss. and An- drorchis advocated by Tyteca &amp; Klein (2008, 2009)? (3) Do similar levels of reproductive isolation show a linear positive correlation with similar amounts of molecular divergence, or do they reflect at least partially independent and potentially sequential processes? (cf. Bateman, 2009). We then re-examine the relative merits and applications oí reproductive isolation relative to monophyly and similarity, considering also whether the test of the biological robustness of classifications advocated here is generally applicable to plant systematics. ■ MATERIALS AND METHODS Postzygotic isolation data. - For the present study we utilise data previously published by Scopece &amp; al. (2007, 2008), as well as new results from additional experimental crosses. During the Springs of 2005 and 2006 we performed hand- pollination experiments between species belonging to five gen- era (sensu Bateman &amp; al., 1997, 2003) of subtribe Orchidinae: Platanthera s.L, Dactylorhiza s.L, Himantoglossum s.l., Sera- pias and Ophrys (Table 1). Applying the method described by Scopece &amp; al. (2007), we used seed viability values resulting from these crosses to calculate a postzygotic isolation index for each species pair via the formula: 1 - (percentage of viable seeds produced in interspecific crosses / percentage of viable seeds produced in intraspecific crosses). We selected from the published data (Scopece &amp; al, 2007, 2008) only the interspecific crosses between species belonging to the expanded Anacamptis s.l., expanded Neotinea s.l. and restricted Orchis s.str. (sensu Bateman &amp; al., 1997, 2003). The resulting data matrix summarised the outcomes of 113 species pairs that together involved 17 species: 6 from the expanded Anacamptis s.L, 3 from the expanded Neotinea s.l., and 8 from the restricted Orchis s.str. (voucher numbers are reported in the Appendix). Intra- and intergeneric relationships. - To assess the relative merits of contrasting views on intra- and intergeneric relationships in Orchidinae we compared intra- and interge- neric postzygotic isolation indices against three classifications (summarised in Table 1, with exemplars illustrated in Fig. 1): (1) The 'traditional', pre-cladistic treatment of Moore (1980) considered all species to belong to Orchis s.l. (Fig. 1C-E, G-H) except three monospecific genera whose identi- fication was rendered unambiguous by the fact that they pos- sessed at least one distinctive morphological character state (see Discussion): Neotinea maculata (small autogamous flow- ers: Fig. IA), Aceras anthropophorum (wide spur reduced to a vestigial state: Fig. IB) and Anacamptis pyramidalis (long, narrow spur whose entrance is bracketed by vertical flanges: Fig. IF). Subsequently, molecular phylogenetic studies clearly showed Orchis s.l. to be triphyletic, and two of its three con- stituent groups to be rendered paraphyletic by recognition of the monospecific genera Neotinea and Anacamptis. For ease of reference, this classification is henceforth termed the poly- phyletic classification. (2) The cladistic treatment of Bateman &amp; al. (1997, 2003; see also Bateman, 2007, 2009) applied monophyly to ITS phy- logenies and hence transferred several species from the tradi- tional, triphyletic Orchis s.l. io Anacamptis s.l. (Fig. 1F-H) and several more to Neotinea s.l. (Fig. 1A-B), thereby rendering each genus polyspecific in this classification. In compensation for these losses, Aceras was incorporated into the reduced Or- chis s.str. (Fig. 1B-D). The resulting thfee monophyletic genera (Table 1) constitute the monophyletic classification. (3) The 'post-cladistic' treatment of Tyteca &amp; Klein (2008) gave greater emphasis to perceived morphological difference, rejecting polyphyly but explicitly permitting recognition of paraphyletic genera. They retained a monospecific Neotinea (Fig. 1 A) but the remaining species allocated to Neotinea s.l. by Bateman &amp; al. (1997, 2003) were redelimited as a new mono- phyletic genus, Odontorchis (Fig. IE). Tyteca &amp; Klein similarly retained a monospecific Anacamptis (Fig. IF) but the remain- ing species allocated to Anacamptis s.l. by Bateman &amp; al. were redelimited as a new paraphyletic genus, Herorchis (Fig. 1G-H) (only later did these authors realise the nomenclatural hornets nest that they had disturbed: Tyteca &amp; Klein, 2009). Although they agreed with Bateman &amp; al. that the monospecific Aceras should be incorporated within a reduced Orchis s.str., Tyteca &amp; Klein further divided Orchis s.str. into two genera. 1757</page><page sequence="5">Scopece &amp; al. • Testing generic delimitation in Orchidinae TAXON 59 (6) • December 2010: 1754-1764 In ITS phylogenies (Fig. 2) the anthropomorphic-flowered Orchis sensu strictissimo (Fig. 1B-C) appears paraphyletic to an unequivocally monophyletic new genus, the non-anthro- pomorphic-flowered Andr orchis (Fig. ID). As two of the six resulting genera are paraphyletic, for ease of reference, this is termed the paraphyletic classification. For each of classifications 1-3 we compared the level of postzygotic isolation of intergeneric species pairs belonging to the different circumscriptions of the genera Anacamptis, Neotinea and Orchis with those involving five other related, but less taxonomically contentious, genera of subtribe Orchidi- nae: Platanthera, Dactylorhiza, Himantoglossum, Serapias and Ophrys. To test the validity of the arguably single-species genera Aceras - monospecific in classification 1 - and Anacamptis - monospecific in classifications 1 and 3 - we estimated the strength of postzygotic isolation between the unique members of these two monospecific genera and their newly congeneric species. Specifically, we estimated (a) the strength of postzy- gotic isolation between Aceras anthropophorum and the mem- bers of the reduced genus Orchis s.str., and (b) the strength of postzygotic isolation between Anacamptis pyramidalis and the members of the expanded genus Anacamptis s.L These two estimates were compared with the strength of postzygotic isolation among species within Orchis s.str. and within the expanded Anacamptis s.L, respectively. Furthermore, to test the suitability of the new genera delimitation, these two estimates were also compared with the strength of postzygotic isolation between intergeneric crosses among Orchis s.str., expanded Anacamptis s.L and expanded Neotinea s.L. We were unable to perform this comparison for the monospecific genus Neotinea because TV. maculata is autogamous (or even cleistogamous: Duffy &amp; al., 2009) and consequently is unsuitable for crossing experiments. In addition, to assess whether postzygotic isolation data support a further subdivision of the genus Orchis s.str. into two genera, as advocated by Tyteca &amp; Klein (2008), we tested the differences in the strength of postzygotic isolation within and between the two main groups, namely the anthropomorphic Orchis italica clade (including O. anthropophora, O. italica, O. purpurea, O. simia = Orchis sensu strictissimo of Tyteca &amp; Klein), and the Orchis máscula clade (including O. máscula, O. paucißora, O. provincialis, O. quadripunctata = Androrchis ofTyteca&amp; Klein). Finally, to test whether different levels of postzygotic iso- lation are only a consequence of different genetic distances among species, we compared inter- and intrageneric postzy- gotic isolation over the same spectrum of genetic distances calculated as described in Scopece &amp; al. (2007), using data from the ribosomal Internal Transcribed Spacer regions (the ITS1-5.8S-ITS2 assembly). This analysis was restricted to the newly expanded Anacamptis s.L, as only this genus shows a majority of intrageneric distances that are comparable with intergeneric distances in Orchidinae. All statistical analyses were performed using the SPSS 13.0 statistical package (SPSS Inc., Chicago, Illinois, U.S.A.). Because our data were not normally distributed, we used the two-tailed non-parametric Mann Whitney U-Test to determine significance in the mean differences with the significance level set to 0.01 (Bonferroni correction).

Within fruits, mean values of seed viability (used for calculation of embryo mortality index) ranged from 0% to 2.33%, averaging 0.62% (Table 2). The consistently high levels of postzygotic isolation for crosses between the five non-Orchis genera (Fig. 3A) pro- vided a valuable yardstick for the remaining analyses. The traditional polyphyletic classification (Moore, 1980: all species belonging to Orchis s.l. except Neotinea maculata, Aceras anthropophorum and Anacamptis pyramidalis) yielded no significant difference in the strength of postzygotic isolation of intra- versus intergeneric species pairs (Mann Whitney U= 1048.5, P = 0.561: Fig. 3B). In contrast, comparison of intra- and intergeneric species pairs using the monophyletic three-genus classification of Bateman &amp; al. (1997, 2003) yielded a highly significant difference; with the exception of Neotinea ustulata x Orchis quadripunctata and N. láctea x Anacamptis palustris, intergeneric species were far more isolated than intrageneric pairs (Mann Whitney U= 147.5, P &lt; 0.001: Fig. 3C). We also found that levels of postzygotic isolation in the in- tergeneric crosses involving Anacamptis s.l., Neotinea s.l. and Orchis s.str. (as delimited by Bateman &amp; al., 1997) were not significantly different from those of the intergeneric crosses involving the five other morphologically and molecularly distinct, but less contentious, genera of Orchidinae that we investigated (Mann Whitney t/ = 216.0, P = 0.512: Fig. 3A, C, Table 2). Despite their unambiguous morphological differentia- tion, the strength of postzygotic isolation separating Aceras anthropophorum from the other Orchis s.str. (sensu Bateman &amp; al., 1997) was not significantly different from that separating the remaining species of Orchis s.str. (Mann Whitney U= 44.0, P = 0.537). Similarly, postzygotic isolation between A. pyrami- dalis and the other species of Anacamptis s.l. (sensu Bateman &amp; al., 1997) was not different from that observed among other species of Anacamptis s.l. (Mann Whitney U= 11.0, P = 0.099). Moreover, the strength of postzygotic isolation in crosses be- tween Aceras anthropophorum or Anacamptis pyramidalis and species treated as their congeners in the monophyletic clas- sification (Bateman &amp; al., 1997) was significantly lower than that of intergeneric crosses (for Aceras anthropophorum: Mann Whitney U= 15.5, P &lt; 0.001; for Anacamptis pyramidalis: Mann Whitney U= 4.0, P &lt; 0.001). Moving on to consider the paraphyletic classification, the strength of postzygotic isolation within Orchis sensu strictis- simo and Androrchis (sensu Tyteca &amp; Klein, 2008) was sub- stantially lower than between these putative genera (Mann Whitney U = 20.5, P = 0.003), the sole exception being the relatively high degree of isolation shown by O. provincialis x pauciflora. However, the strength of postzygotic isolation between Androrchis and Orchis s.ss. (sensu Tyteca &amp; Klein, 2008: cf. Fig. 3C-D) was in turn significantly lower than that for crosses regarded as intergeneric in the monophyletic clas- sification (Mann Whitney U= 49.0, P &lt; 0.001) and not signifi- cantly greater than intrageneric crosses (Mann Whitney U = 260.5, P = 0.323). We selected 6 intrageneric and 15 intergeneric species pairs involving species of the expanded genus Anacamptis s.l. (Bateman &amp; al., 1997) for comparison within a common inter- val of molecular divergence. Although mean genetic distance between the two categories of crosses was not significantly different (Mann Whitney U = 29.0, P = 0.235), intrageneric species pairs were significantly less isolated than intergeneric pairs (Mann Whitney U= 10.5, P = 0.004), rejecting the hy- pothesis that there exists a linear relationship between degrees of sequence divergence and postzygotic reproductive isolation among genera. ■ DISCUSSION Postzygotic isolation offers a highly successful test of the relative merits of competing formal classifications. - In this study, we used postzygotic isolation values to compare the relative merits of genus-level boundaries in three competing classifications of a controversial group of Mediterranean or- chids that has undergone several radical taxonomic reassess- ments in recent years (cf. Moore, 1980; Bateman &amp; al., 1997; Bateman, 2007, 2009; Tyteca &amp; Klein, 2008, 2009; Delforge, 2009: Table 1). We focused on a postzygotic isolation stage, defined as embryo mortality, that has recently been shown to evolve after the emergence of earlier postzygotic isolation stages, specifically hybrid sterility and inviability (Scopece &amp; al., 2008).

We consider this approach to testing pre-existing classifi- cations to have proven remarkably successful, at least for this case-study. The traditional, polyphyletic classification (Moore, 1980) yielded strikingly similar postzygotic isolation profiles for intrageneric and intergeneric crosses (Fig. 3B), with high mean values but large variances and ranges, suggesting that both taxonomic categories are highly heterogeneous. Together, the similarity and heterogeneity of the two profiles show that the genus-level circumscription is far from optimal; isolation cannot be used to distinguish genera from species in this clas- sification. They contrast with intergeneric isolation among the five non-contentious genera (Table 2), which reliably show postzygotic isolation values of at least 0.95. We also wished to explore the highly individualistic classification of Orchis s.l. presented in Delforge's (2006) popular monograph of European orchids. In its most recent formulation (Delforge, 2009), this treatment most closely resembles the traditional polyphyletic classification 1, except that the traditional monospecific genus Aceras is included within Orchis, as in classifications 2 and 3, and that the genus Herorchis, founded in classification 3, is further divided into four smaller genera that average only three species each. Unfortunately, we lacked crosses involving species from some of these novel 'micro-genera', and so could not comprehensively assess their validity. In contrast, the monophyletic classification based on ITS phylogenies (Bateman &amp; al., 1997, 2003) shows strongly con- trasting intra- and intergeneric isolation profiles (Fig. 3C). With the exception of a small proportion of outlying crosses, isolation in genera formerly ascribed to Orchis s.l. as redelimited by Bateman &amp; al. is as high as that observed in the other, non- contentious genera examined (cf. Fig. 3C, right column versus Fig. 3A). In contrast, intrageneric crosses are comparatively fer- tile, averaging 0.5 ±0.04. Hence, in this classification, there is a clear distinction between partial isolation among intrageneric species and near-complete isolation among intergeneric spe- cies. Moreover, the strength of postzygotic isolation separating 'Aceras' anthropophorum and Anacamptis pyramidalis from their congeneric species within the monophyletic classification was similar to those found separating species within Orchis s.str. and within the expanded Anacamptis s.l., respectively. Lastly, we tested the genus-level separation between two groups advocated in the paraphyletic classification of Tyteca &amp; Klein (2008, 2009) within Orchis s.str. as delimited by Bate- man &amp; al. (1997, 2003); that is, between Orchis s.ss. and An- drorchis (arrow 1 on Fig. 2). Here, crosses between Orchis s.ss. and Androrchis yielded an isolation profile similar to that of intrageneric crosses in the Bateman &amp; al. classification, sug- gesting that the case for erecting Androrchis as a separate genus is weak. Crosses within Orchis s.ss. and within Androrchis predictably had much lower levels of isolation; these were ap- proximately equal, though Androrchis appears less heterogene- ous than Orchis s.ss.

In this context, it would be useful to perform further crosses in order to test Bate- man's (2009) suggestion that there are not two potential sec- tions within Orchis s.str. but rather three: Orchis s.ss. plus the O. mascula-O. provincialis and O. spitzelii-O. quadripunctata groups that together constitute 'Androrchis' of Tyteca &amp; Klein (2008, 2009) (arrow 2 in Fig. 2). Insufficient artificial crosses are presently available to test this hypothesis. However, if cred- ible reports of natural hybrids are adjusted to exclude potential parents with non-overlapping geographical ranges (figure 414.1 of Kretzschmar &amp; al., 2007), the proportion of potential species pairs yielding hybrids is 68% within the O. mascula-O. pro- vincialis group, 44% within the O. spitzelii-O. quadripunctata group, and a surprisingly high 48% between the two groups. This evidence suggests that the modest sequence divergence evident at arrow 2 in Fig. 2 is not reflected in greatly increased reproductive isolation, though it is also noteworthy that hybrid swarms occasionally form within the two groups but never between them. From the viewpoint of postzygotic isolation, the monophy- letic Bateman &amp; al. (1997) classification of three monophyletic and polyspecifíc genera best captures the biological reality of this group and more accurately reflects natural categories. Why, then, has the Bateman &amp; al. (1997) classification not been universally accepted in the 13 years since it was first proposed (reviewed by Bateman, 2007, 2009)? Can intimate relationships with pollinators decouple morphological and genetic divergence? - The obvious an- swer to this question lies in the properties of morphological characters and how such characters have been utilised taxo- nomically. Despite the availability of cytogenetic and ecologi- cal information, the traditional polyphyletic classification re- lied largely on morphology. There have in the past been heated debates between two schools who have quantified morphology; specifically, pheneticists, who rely on similarity between spe- cies, and cladists, who rely on degrees of divergence follow- ing the construction of phylogenetic trees using parsimony (e.g., Patterson, 1999). However, no morphological cladistic phylogeny of Orchidinae has yet been published, and phenetic studies that ordinate morphometric data have been confined to individual genera within Orchidinae such as Dactylorhiza (e.g., Bateman &amp; Denholm, 1983 et seq.; Tyteca &amp; Gathoye, 1989) and Ophrys (e.g., Devey, 2007). Thus, the desired quantitative comparison has never been made. One of us (RMB) has, over the last 30 years, gradually accumulated large morphometric data matrices on several groups within Orchidinae: Dactylorhiza s.l. (including Coelo- glossum), Gymnadenia s.l. (including Nigritella),Pseudorchis, Platanthera, Ophrys, Neotinea s.l. and Orchis s.ss. (includ- ing Aceras), but not yet Anacamptis s.l. or 'Androrchis9. Pre- liminary results suggest that the supposed monotypic genera (Coeloglossum within Dactylorhiza s.l., Aceras within Orchis s.str., Neotinea maculata within Neotinea s.l., Anacamptis pyramidalis within Anacamptis s.l.) are not greatly more di- vergent from their congeners in overall morphology. Rather, it is primarily the possession of very few but, crucially, very distinctive autapomorphies (unique derived character states) that encouraged traditional morphological taxonomists to seg- regate these species as monospecific genera: wide spur reduced to a near-vestigial state and reduced lateral labellum lobes in { Coeloglossum' viride (Box &amp; al., 2008), wide spur reduced to a vestigial state in 'Aceras' anthropophorum (Fig. IB), small autogamous flowers in Neotinea maculata (Fig. 1 A), and long, narrow spur whose entrance is bracketed by vertical flanges in Anacamptis pyramidalis (Fig. IF). Such unambiguous char- acter states permit equally unambiguous identification in both the field and the herbarium. This floral differentiation is most likely the result of polli- nation shifts that occurred in these species from ancestors that, on phylogenetic evidence, possessed medium-length saccate spurs (Bell &amp; al, 2009) and were pollinated dominantly by hymenopterans that, with the possible exception of the ancestor of 'Coeloglossum', were food-deceptive. From this species- rich assemblage of species with plesiomorphic flowers and plesiomorphic pollination strategies have arisen Dactylorhiza {Coeloglossum) viridis, which has adapted its flowers to a wider range of nectar-seeking pollinators, Anacamptis pyramidalis, which has adapted its floral traits to lepidopterans, and Orchis {Aceras) anthropophora, which has adapted its floral traits to coleopterans (Van der Cingel, 1995). Clearly, these plant-pol- linator relationships are imperfect and permit genetic leakage, otherwise natural hybrids would not occur between species ostensibly possessing contrasting pollination syndromes (Bate- man &amp; al., 2010). Nonetheless, shifts to a different dominant pollinator guild can occur rapidly (Cozzolino &amp; Widmer, 2005) and lead to strong and highly iterative convergence. For ex- ample, within tribe Orchideae there have been several origins of moth-pollinated lineages possessing white, long-spurred, nectariferous flowers. In the case of hymenopteran pollination in the three groups that constitute Orchis s.l., one could make a case for either floral plesiomorphy (Bateman &amp; al., 1997, 2003; Pridgeon &amp; al., 1997; Bateman, 2007, 2009) or convergence (Cozzolino &amp; al., 2001). Both phenomena inevitably hamper interpretation of relationships and inference of ancestry, and mean that a strong positive correlation between degrees of sequence divergence and morphological divergence is by no means guaranteed (Aceto &amp; al., 1999; Chase, 1999). A linear positive correlation cannot be expected be- tween reproductive isolation and sequence divergence among genera. - In Orchidinae, the strength of postzygotic isolation among species shows a strong positive correlation with their genetic distance as assessed through degrees of di- vergence in parsimony trees based on ITS sequences (Scopece &amp; al., 2007, 2008; Cozzolino &amp; Scopece, 2008). Consequently, our analyses of intra- and intergeneric postzygotic isolation also broadly reflect the degree of genetic divergence among species as assessed in the ITS gene tree (sensu Doyle, 1997; Degnan &amp; Rosenburg, 2009). However, although these analy- ses can give insights into intra- and intergeneric relationships, they do not unambiguously inform us whether the processes that lead to the formation of bona fide genera - that is, genera confined to monophyly and optimised for molecular divergence 1761</page><page sequence="9">Scopece &amp; al. • Testing generic delimitation in Orchidinae TAXON 59 (6) • December 2010: 1754-1764 and reproductive isolation - are different from those that pro- duce species. Indeed, it is theoretically possible that the gaps in postzygotic isolation that we have identified among genera (i.e., with higher intergeneric versus intrageneric postzygotic isolation) can arise because early-formed species within each of the three monophyletic genera recognised in classification 2 are more likely to become extinct than later-formed species. Under this scenario, genera encompass species of recent diver- gence (i.e., more genetically similar) and the extinction of early- divergent species within each lineage produces a perceived break in genetic continuity and consequently an increased level of postzygotic isolation. Nonetheless, our study of the expanded genus Anacamp- tis s.l. showed that, even when genetic distances are similar, postzygotic isolation can be substantially higher in intergeneric than in intrageneric species pairs. This observation suggests that increasing reproductive isolation between these genera did not always evolve as a simple linear by-product of increasing genetic divergence among species, but more likely as a conse- quence of the evolutionary changes that caused the origin of these groups through cladogenesis. It is therefore noteworthy that the three clades into which the traditional Orchis s.l. of Moore (1980) was divided by Bateman &amp; al. (1997, 2003) show reliable differences in their karyotypes. The revised Orchis s.str. (including the old genus Aceras) has a basic diploid chro- mosome number of 42, the expanded genus Neotinea s.l. (in- cluding the previously monospecific genus Neotinea) has a basic diploid number of 42 plus one B-chromosome, and the expanded genus Anacamptis s.l. (including the previously mon- ospecific genus Anacamptis) has a basic and derived diploid number of 36 or, more rarely, 32 that characterises a clade that also includes Himantoglossum plus Steveniella, Serapias and Ophrys (Pridgeon &amp; al., 1997; D'Emerico, 2001; Bateman &amp; al, 2003; Tyteca &amp; Klein, 2008; Bateman, 2009). The genus-level diversification in the more derived portion of Orchidinae that, among other consequences, separated the three molecularly distinct lineages formerly assigned to the traditional Orchis s.l., could thus be due to large chromosomal rearrangements. Their fixation within lineages (Levin, 2002) most likely immediately and strongly reduced the capability of species belonging to different lineages to interbreed. It is important to note that, thus far, we have considered only postzygotic isolation based on embryo mortality, which is the third and last phase of reproductive isolation to develop, after first partial hybrid sterility and then hybrid inviability. For example, Scopece &amp; al. (2008) argued that Orchis máscula and O. pauciflora, which have similar ITS sequences and co-occur in 'Androrchis' (Fig. 2), are separated only by partial hybrid ste- rility, whereas O. máscula is separated from species in Orchis s.ss. such as O. simia by hybrid inviability. Only at the level of comparison of bona fide genera, such as Orchis s.str. versus Neotinea s.l. versus Anacamptis s.l., is postzygotic isolation through embryo mortality dominant. In this context, it would be helpful to better understand the three intergeneric crosses we detected that had unexpectedly low postzygotic isolation (as also reported in Glycine by Moyle &amp; al., 2004) (Fig. 3C), none of which share the same parental species. Similarly, thus far, 1762 we have considered only artificial rather than natural hybrids. The great rarity of natural hybrids (Klein, 2004; Kretzschmar &amp; al., 2007) between members of the Androrchis and Orchis s.ss. (sensu Tyteca &amp; Klein, 2008, 2009) suggests the presence of a strong early-emerging postzygotic isolation stage, pre- sumably hybrid inviability (Scopece &amp; al, 2008), that confers on these two groups a degree of distinctiveness. However, a similar level of postzygotic isolation (i.e., hybrid inviability) has been reported between congeneric species pairs that are both grouped within Androrchis but have not generated any credible reports of natural hybrids, such as Orchis máscula and O. quadripunctata (Klein, 2004; Kretzschmar &amp; al., 2007). Such observations reinforce our earlier assertion that hy- brid inviability evolves before embryo mortality (Scopece &amp; al., 2008). Determining which of the three phases of reproduc- tive isolation has been achieved by a lineage could be used to help arbitrate among other taxonomic disagreements within Orchidinae: whether the monospecific genera Neolindleya camtschatica and/or Amerorchis rotundifolia should be sub- sumed into Galearis (Efimov &amp; al., 2009), whether Traun- steinera should be subsumed into its sister genus, Chamorchis (Bateman, 2009), and whether there is sufficient genetic leak- age between Dactylorhiza s.l. and Gymnadenia s.l. to justify amalgamation of these genera (Bateman &amp; al., 2003; Bateman, 2009). More importantly, we consider these principles to be generally applicable to challenges in higher plant taxonomy. ■ CONCLUSIONS It is often stated that genera are arbitrary groups of species established for human convenience rather than real biological entities, and that by definition their delimitation depends en- tirely on the subjective opinion of the taxonomist ('authoritar- ian' sensu Bateman, 2009). Such arbitrariness would impede the establishment of widely accepted definitions of taxonomic ranks and the criteria that should be met in order to delimit them; it would also help to explain the often long-standing debates among taxonomists studying groups such as subtribe Orchidinae (cf. Moore, 1980; Bateman &amp; al., 1997, 2003; Bate- man, 2007, 2009; Tyteca &amp; Klein, 2008, 2009; Delforge, 2009). Any novel methodology that improves the objectivity and bio- logical reality of the genera delimited by plant taxonomists, and so increases the probability of establishing a well-founded consensus classification for use by other biologists and conser- vationists, must surely be welcomed. Our results show strong agreement between postzygotic isolation and a molecular-based monophyletic classification, and suggest that postzygotic isolation data can be used as a criterion for more meaningful delimitation of genera in taxo- nomically controversial groups such as Mediterranean orchids (cf. Stebbins, 1969; Sundermann, 1975; Gill &amp; al., 2005). We advocate further research to better gauge the relative sequence of acquisition of partial hybrid sterility, hybrid inviability, em- bryo mortality and substantial sequence divergence in genie regions routinely used in molecular systematics such as ITS and various plastid regions. Nonetheless, we believe that adding a</page><page sequence="10">TAXON 59 (6) • December 2010: 1754-1764 Scopece &amp; al. • Testing generic delimitation in Orchidinae criterion to higher taxonomic ranks that pertains to reproduc- tive isolation, and thus to the various biological species con- cepts (reviewed by Mayden, 1997), already offers a significant step forward. However, we should make clear that we are not advocating reproductive isolation as the sole, or even the pre- eminent, criterion for delimiting genera. We consider these phenomena as a necessary pre-requisite for delimiting genera but insufficient in itself (we would not, for example, wish to be obliged to erect every autogamous orchid species as a new genus: Bateman, 2009). We have instead linked our approach to delimiting genera to a combination of substantial sequence divergence and reproductive isolation through embryo mortal- ity, both considered within the constraint of monophyly. We are seeking approaches that offer the potential to bridge the gaps between the three cornerstones of modern plant taxonomy identified by Bateman &amp; al. (2010): similarity, monophyly (sup- ported by comparison of phylogenetic branch lengths) and re- productive isolation. We believe that the approach used here of comparing competing multiple classifications generated using different criteria and/or different categories of data against one or more quantitative datasets (e.g., morphometric distances, molecular phylogenetic distances and, of course, degree of re- productive isolation) represents an effective means of explicitly evaluating, and potentially integrating, these contrasting data sources. Importantly, this approach maintains complete separa- tion between datasets for phytogeny reconstruction and those estimating reproductive isolation. This separation allows each dataset to legitimately test the other, while also avoiding the contentious issue of whether reproductive isolation constitutes a valid phylogenetic character. In theory, it would be possible to conduct iterative experiments, exploring every possible com- bination of the study species into different genera, with the aim of optimising the eventual classification against levels of reproductive isolation, sequence divergence or morphological similarity, just as selecting among sets of trees using parsimony optimises (i.e., minimises) tree length in phylogenetics. ■ ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS The authors thank three anonymous reviewers and P.
