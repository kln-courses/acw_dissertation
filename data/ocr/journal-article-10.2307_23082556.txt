<plain_text><page sequence="1">CURRENT RESEARCH IN INFANT DEVELOPMENT1 Irving E. Sigel* The Merrill-Palmer Institute The following papers2 reflect the continued trend of interweaving biological and psychological variables in the study of infant behavior (Sigel, 1962). The papers by Dr. Richmond, Drs. Lipton and Stein schneider, and Drs. Caldwell and Hersher, represent the combined team efforts of pediatricians and psychologists. All of these investigators are as sociated with the Upstate Medical Center of the State University of New York, at Syracuse. On the other hand, the paper by Dr. Bell of the National Institute of Mental Health represents a psychologist's singlehanded effort to pose an issue that integrates variables from psychology, sociology, and medicine. Many studies espousing an interdisciplinary approach have voiced dif ficulty in integrating the various yet relevant disciplines within a coherent conceptual system. The search for conceptual unity is a necessary require ment for the investigations to be truly interdisciplinary. The alternative is to provide a multidisciplinary approach, in which many disciplines converge upon a single problem or aspects of the problem. The papers of the Syracuse group reflect a provocative and fruitful approach, multidisciplinary in na ture, allowing for identifiable contributions of each of the disciplines. Each of these papers converges on the problem of identifying and assessing the consequences of ecological imbalance. Dr. Richmond defines ecological imbalance as inappropriate caretaking of the infant. The point of departure is physiologic, since the infant is identified as a primary physio logical being. Anthropomorphism is thereby reduced, if not eliminated. An optimal balance is an assumed requirement for growth and develop ment. The evidence presented in Dr. Upton's paper, as well as in Dr. Caldwell's, enables us to make such an inference. One of the important implications of Dr. Richmond's remarks is that he and his colleagues will be able to identify the necessary and sufficient conditions for optimal growth and development. There is need to specify how much stimulation is optimal. * Chairman of Research, The Merrill-Palmer Institute, 71 East Ferry Avenue, Detroit, Michigan 48202.

In addition, it is necessary to determine what areas of mother-child interaction provide the necessary stimulation. In general, the findings and implications that are raised in Dr. Richmond's paper are crucial in the analysis of the care-taking functions. Starting from the proposition that ecological imbalance is a crucial de terminant of a host of physiological and psychological consequences, such as colitis, ulcers, depressions, etc., the investigators are interested in tracing how such negative consequences follow. Drs. Lipton and Steinschneider present the basic methodological and substantive matters in their paper. By adopting the notion that psychologic explanations were insufficient to ex plain enuresis, rumination or peptic ulcers, the search was directed for relevant physiological systems. Studies investigating the autonomic nervous system ensued. Lipton and Steinschneider provide us with the necessary material with which to begin thinking about the significance of particular physical stimulations on a number of response systems. The range of re sponse patterns in the visceral system identified by these investigators add to our knowledge of content and method regarding the early behaviors of infants. Since the ecological imbalance is defined in terms of child-care condi tions, then it is necessary to study caretaking patterns of behaviors. Drs. Caldwell and Hersher have proceeded to study caretaking patterns by ex amining the differences in child behavior when the child is attended to by the same mother figure (monomatric) or many (polymatric). Within a Murray need system framework, Caldwell and Hersher have studied the mothers and their babies at age 6 and 12 months. They have identified dif ferences between these two child-care conditions over the time periods studied. The three papers offer an excellent illustration of the type of multi disciplinary study in which a common problem is viewed from more than one vantage point. We see how studies within the disciplines—physiology, pediatrics, and psychology—can interweave and work together while still retaining their individualized methodologies and conceptual framework. Dr. Bell's paper, in contrast to the three previous ones, shows us a way to study the coping behavior of children in a family setting. This procedure implies a socio-psychological view, coupled with the identification of the particular disability of the child. In effect, he proposes that we can learn about the various adjustive techniques family members employ to cope with a physically deviant member and how the family behavior influences the particular child. Such an approach, Dr. Bell proposes, extends the possi bilities of studying coping ability, in a way not otherwise possible. This paper has implications for interaction analyses by which to gain further insights into variations and potentials of the children's coping behavior.</page><page sequence="3">Current Research in Infant Development Thus four papers are presented here which contain substantial and methodological content that is relevant to research and the study of infant development. These materials are offered to provide stimulation to re searchers and teachers in that field. REFERENCES SiGEL, Ι. E. (Ed.).
