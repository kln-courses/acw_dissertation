Verse from poem by Rose Terry Cooke in one of Brevoort Butler's notebooks, included with pressed flowers. Background, Theory, and Method of Analysis. This entry focuses on the meaning of a "sound" for late pre-Columbian peoples of the Mississippi Valley, through an examination of five small ceramic container rattles in anthro- or zoomorphic shapes originally affixed to the rims of pottery vessels from Lake George, a large mound-plaza site in the Yazoo-Mississippi River Delta, occupied between 800 and 1600 CE [figs. 1-5]. There are five questions about these rattles that I will try to answer: (1) Were they intentionally made? (2) If intentional, where and when were they made? (3) Who used them and how? (4) What were they used for? And, (5) what did the sounds they make mean? My approach is archeological and ethnographical, the latter informed by consultation with a Muscogee potter, Valerie Hanks-Goetz, and a Cherokee craftsperson, Theresa Horn, both with lineage ties to pre-Columbian Native Americans of the Mississippi River Valley, and individuals steeped in cultural revivals and craft replications of their respective people. The five effigy rattles (here also called adorno rattles1) comprise part of a collection of Native American artifacts acquired by a southern farmer, Brevoort Butler, in the late nineteenth century (now housed in the Capers Building of the Mississippi Department of Archives and History [MDAH]).2 According to Butler's notes, he found a total of eleven effigy heads at or around Lake George between 1889 and 1891. This infor- mation is contained in three documents pertaining to his finds, but the catalogue numbers used in the docu- ments do not match. More curiously, in only one of his lists does Butler indicate any of the effigy heads rattle, and he describes this aspect for only one of them. Nevertheless, there is no doubt that the adornos examined are five of the eleven Butler found. In fact, according to a synthesis of the notes, they were all likely gathered from one mound at the edge of the lake, probably one of the seven modest mounds (likely domicile) located there (named by archaeologists, N, O, P, Q, R, S, T).3 It is worth noting that the five rattles were items Butler personally found, and as a result they are among the first known artifacts ever collected at Lake George. Scientific investigations did not begin there until C.B. Moore's 1908 excavation.4 The Lake George Site. Lake George (in the past also called the Holly Bluff Site) is a large pre-Columbian mound-plaza center in west central Mississippi, now consisting of some twenty-five earthworks, a few especially prominent in size [fig. 6]. It is located on the western edge of Yazoo County in the Yazoo River Basin of the Mississippi-Yazoo Delta, on the south shore of Lake George, less than a kilometer from where the lake joins the Sunflower River, and not far from the banks of the Yazoo River and the Mississippi River distributary, Deer Creek, both, along with the Sunflower, allowing near complete water access throughout the Delta. The site is approximately half way between Memphis, Tennessee, and New Orleans, Louisiana [fig. 7]. © 2011 Research Center for Music Iconography CUNY 231</page><page sequence="2">Mark Howell, Sonic-Iconic Examination of Adorno Rattles from the Mississippian-Era Lake George Site 1-5.

Lake George site, with a representation of mounds and earthen wall. Computer drawing by author. Added to its proximity to major water transportation routes, the settlement's access to nearby fertile land and location on natural levee surface, 3-5 meters above flood plain levels, allowed Lake George to take advantage of cultural developments that occurred in the Lower Mississippi Valley in the millennia immedia- tely preceding European contact.5 There is evidence of settlement at the Lake George site extending to Late Archaic, or Poverty Point times (1500-500 BCE), but its emergence as a regional power did not begin until over 1000 years later. During this period, ca. 800-1600 CE, Lake George grew from a modest village of the Bay town period (400-800 CE) to one of the largest towns of the Mississip- pian period (1200-1600 CE). In between, it was a participant in Coles Creek culture (1000-1200 CE). In the last few centuries preceding European explo- ration in the area (starting in 1541 CE) it was, in fact, one of the most sizeable settlements in eastern North America. At its peak there were more than thirty mounds in a downtown area that was demarcated on three sides by an earthen wall and moat stretching some 1000 meters a side. The fourth side faced George Lake. Its primary mound was over 21.5 meters high and covered over two acres in area. On either side of it were two large plazas, one facing west and the other east. The only other comparable Mississippian settlement known to have been constructed in this particular arrangement is the site of Winterville, some 80 kilometers north [fig. 8]. Estimates of population vary, but figures exceeding a thousand are reasonable. Cultural florescence at Lake George began during what is called the late Crippen Point phase of the Coles Creek Period (1000-1200 CE), when elite burial practices and platform mound construction possibly influenced Mis- sissippian ideas developing at its founding center, Cahokia, located across the river from modern St. Louis. Cahokia and affiliated nearby Midwestern mound sites incorporated elements from various precocious groups in the Americas, like southern Coles Creek peoples, and merged them with their own ideas to fashion Mississippian society by 1050 CE. Minimally, this cul- ture is characterized by wall-trench building construction, shell-tempered pottery, and intensive exploitation of maize agriculture. 7.

Belief systems of the Mississippians find precedent in earlier practices of eastern woodlands people, but they transformed many of these into a self referencing world view that was disseminated, along with mate- rial culture, throughout the Mississippi River Valley and its tributary river systems. By 1200 CE Coles Creek aligned Lake George became very Mississippianized (a hybridization called Plaquemine), so much so, that one theory holds that immigrants or refugees from Cahokia moved en-masse to the Yazoo Delta city some- time in the thirteenth century. True or not, after that time, Lake George was a full participant in Mississippian society until the town was slowly abandoned during the period of early European exploration. How the Five Adorno Rattles Were Made. Unlike Amerindians in some other areas, those in the southeast did not continue their pottery traditions long after contact, preferring instead to barter for Euro- pean cooking and serving ware. Much information about precontact ceramic manufacture; therefore, has been lost. Even so, archaeology and early ethnohistoric accounts are in agreement that Mississippi Valley pottery was made using the coil technique; first stacking lengths of wet clay on top of one another, and then kneading those together by hand or by use of small wooden paddles. After being formed into a desired shape the worked object was left in the sun for up to several weeks to dry before being placed in an open pit for firing at 760-1100 degrees Celsius. Decorations, such as incising, engraving, or paint, would be applied at various stages of manufacture, and in the case of effigy rattles, the cavity destined to contain the pellets would be molded hollow and placed onto a vessel rim before firing. Muscogee potter Valerie Hanks-Goetz believes that the cavity of one of the Lake George adornos was made hollow by molding wet clay around a finger, a method she sometimes uses.6 She thinks this is the case for the adorno called hooded duck, because she sees a finger nail mark in its x-ray [fig. 9]. 7 234</page><page sequence="5">Music in Art XXXVI/ 1-2 (2011) 9. X-ray of Lake George adorno rattle called hooded duck (head) showing a possible fingernail mark and organic residue.

Adorno cavities intended to rattle would be filled with pellets, which themselves were dried in the sun for many days before insertion. The Lake George examples were undoubtedly made of clay, as a 760-1100 degree fire would burn up alternatives like seeds, and would crack rock (leaving visible fracture lines that are not evident in the x-rays). It is possible that the pellets were also wrapped in grass or some other malleable organic material to keep them from reattaching to the cavity walls during firing. In fact, the same x-ray of hooded duck indicates possible burned residue from organic material still bunched around the pellets [fig. 9]. None of the Lake George effigy rattles have vent holes, and without these a hollowed object stands the risk of exploding from trapped heat during firing. It was the lack of a vent hole that suggested unintentionali- ty of function when I first examined the artifacts; perhaps they rattled by mistake. But after viewing the x- rays, I am convinced, as is Goetz, that the adornos were intentionally made to sound, proof being the well- formed and smoothed cavities and pellets found in all five adornos. Status of the Five Adorno Rattles as Found. All of the container (hollow) parts of the five Lake George adorno rattles are thumb to half-fist size and were shaped to depict zoomorphic or anthropomorphic heads. These heads were recovered largely intact and their separation from parent vessels; plates, jars, bottles, but more likely bowls, was at their respective necks.8 One might suppose that a half-fist-sized attachment of fired clay affixed to a larger ceramic object would separate at the neck, as this is the most exposed and seemingly structurally weakest part of the object. But according to Goetz, a Mississippian-style bowl affixed with a protuberance, like an adorno, would normally break vertically to include a portion of the vessel to which it was attached; more typically including a tell-tale V-shaped pottery sherd fastened to the neck [fig. 10]. 9 If true, an adorno recovered in-situ without this attached V-section might be indicative of an adorno that was intentionally broken prior to deposit. 235</page><page sequence="6">Mark Howell, Sonic-Iconic Examination of Adorno Rattles from the Mississippian-Era Lake George Site 10. Bowl showing fracture lines for a detached adorno. Computer drawing by author. One, arguably two, of the five adorno rattles is in the shape of a human head, with a conspicuous top- knot hair style in the back, a style often found on figurines and other representations done in various media in Mississippian contexts [fig. 11]. The other four (or three) likely depict the heads of animals that lived in the Yazoo-Mississippi Delta during the time of human occupation at Lake George. That said, such represen- tation does not preclude one or more of the adornos as additionally, or exclusively, representing entities that had no corporal existence. The five adorno rattles appear to have been molded to represent their respective heads realistically, in spite of the fact that three are vague enough in design and/ or execution - to this author - to make identifica- tion problematic. Using Butler's terms, the adornos represent the heads of (1) a human (fig. 11, described above); (2) owl [fig. 12] - although it could be a feline, turtle, or frog; (3) otter [fig. 13] - although it could be a feline, or a human with a top knot; (4) duck [fig. 14] - although it could be another aviary; and a (5) hooded duck [fig. 15] - although it could be a merganser or some other aviary.10 The zoomorphs depicted, if correctly identified, are liminal animals that traverse between two or more of the three Mississippian worlds - the above, the middle, and the below. According to ethnography and ethnohistory, such animal manifestations are dangerous spirits, but if harnessed by humans they can bestow extraordinary powers on their handlers.11 For this reason, the entities may represent clan symbols or totems used to empower and segregate one social group from another. Even the human(s) represented could depict spirits that functioned similarly to clan protectors, one such being the Wind Spirit, which remained a power symbol for post-Conquest Mississippians and their descendents well into the modern era.12 Records of Adorno Rattles in the Mississippi V alley. An important point that perhaps should have been made earlier is that in addition to rattling adornos there are many more non-rattling ones, very similar in appearance, if not function. Possibly due to their comparative ease of manufacture they outnumber rattling ones by a wide margin. To my knowledge, there has been no survey of Amerindian adornos, rattling or otherwise; but site reports and collections indicate that they were somewhat common objects in the Mississippian world.13 Regrettably, in many such collections one cannot know for sure which number rattled (without tactile examination) as this sounding aspect has not always been documented. Butler himself failed 236</page><page sequence="7">Music in Art XXXVI/ 1-2 (2011) 11-15. Lake George adorno rattles listed as human (head); owl (head); otter (head); duck (head); duck (head). Line drawings by author. to mention that four of the eleven adornos he recovered from Lake George were sound makers. As noted earlier, he stated this fact for one of the five. Pictures of adornos will sometimes give a clue in the negative, as some shown are obviously solid in construction. However, there are still a number where this cannot be clearly determined. Reports and collections from sites throughout the Mississippian landscape, nevertheless, list a sufficient number of rattling adornos to make clear that they were somewhat scarce but not unknown.14 Though relatively rare in Southeastern and Midwestern archaeological records, rattling adornos com- prise one of the more common indigenous pan-cultural soundmakers in the Western Hemisphere. They have been found at archaeological sites of various temporalities in South America, Central America, Mexico, and the United States. Figure 16 shows a Guatemalan Maya example. But though known for earlier and contem- porary epochs in other areas, they appear limited to pre-Mississippian or Mississippian-era sites in what is now the eastern U.S. According to John Kelly, staff archaeologist at Cahokia, rattling adornos peak in number 237</page><page sequence="8">Mark Howell, Sonic-Iconic Examination of Adorno Rattles from the Mississippian-Era Lake George Site 16.

Photograph by author. between the years 1200 and 1400 CE, or the mid-to-late Mississippian era. Other archaeologists working in the valley confirm this general time line of use.15 Proof can be found in the artifacts themselves. Four of the five Lake George effigy rattles are tempered exclusively with crushed river mussel shell, a primary diagnostic of the Mississippian culture. The exception- and this is significant- is the human head copy, which is tem- pered with bits of grog, re-used fired clay mixed with shell [fig.ll] . Grog tempering is diagnostic of the Coles Creek period (1000-1200 CE), and grog plus shell suggests manufacture during a period of cultural transition. The combined temper implies that the rattle was made immediately prior to, or just after Lake George had come under the influence of Mississippians.16 Also, the human head adorno's earlier manufacture hints that the development of rattling effigies as perhaps originating at Lake George, or at some other site affiliated with Coles Creek Culture, although this does not mean that the rim adorno itself was invented at the site. In fact, found at the large Mississippian cen- ter, Moundville (near Tuscaloosa, Alabama), were a handful of limestone bowls with non-hollowed bird effi- gies. This could indicate that the compounding of vessel with effigy is a pre-ceramic concept; and if so, the idea and manufacture could date to one or two millennia before the beginning of the modern era. The lack of a proper survey and evidence of invention notwithstanding, the five rattling ceramic adornos from Lake George constitute one of, if not the largest, known number of this type of soundmaker from a single site in the eastern U.S. Documentation Procedures. I measured, drew, photographed, and recorded the sounds of the effigy rattles (using a minidisk recorder and a dB meter), on 17 April 2009, at the MDAH archaeological workshop (located in the basement of the Capers Building in Jackson, Mississippi). In July, I had them x-rayed at the dental office of Drs. James and Mellisa Taylor (in Cleveland, Mississippi) to allow a view of their interiors. Later I analyzed the sounds they produced with a pitch and dB waveform program called Amadeus II. Voice level used for volume comparison at the recording session was 67 dBs and all five of the rattles sounded lower in volume than this average, with a mean dB of 61. Arranged in volume from softest to loudest, the Lake George adorno dB levels, along with pellet numbers are: 238</page><page sequence="9">Music in Art XXXVI/ 1-2 (2011) 17-21.

Owl is the loudest; it also has the largest number of pellets, and at the mean size. The other two adornos, hooded duck and human are different from the rest in having pellets of varied sizes, with the larger pellets, 15 and 12 mm respectively, being the largest of any in the sample. Nevertheless, these two also had smaller pellets, some less in size than the mean. Therefore, human and hooded duck each contained as much or slightly more pellets when compared to the two effigies having the lowest volume levels, otter and duck; but less than the one with the loudest, owl. The conclusion, not surprisingly, is that the larger the number and/ or size of the pellets in an adorno cavity the louder the vo- lume of the rattle sound. Though seemingly unremarkable, this proves that the makers knew how loud or soft their rattles would be before manufacture. Such cognitive decisions concerning amplitude suggest a reason for the volumes chosen. I also conducted a number of dB tests on a rattling effigy bowl copy Valerie Hanks-Goetz made [fig. 22]. As with the Lake George adornos, voice level at the time of measurement (27 April 2010) was 67 dBs. In these experiments I recorded the amplitude level of the bowl copy containing various materials in different quan- tities, but beginning with the bowl empty. In this state the dB reading was 63, with the cavity of the bowl clearly amplifying the sound in the manner of a loudspeaker. Next I filled the bowl % of the way with dried corn.17 The decibel reading was 65 (and along with the following example, the loudest in the experiment), but the rattling of the corn kernels was louder than the pellet rattles in the effigy head. Next I filled the bowl 1/4 of the way with dried corn. With this level of corn the decibel reading remained at 65, but I could make out the sound of the clay pellets in the audio mix. After the dried corn, I added corn meal, and recorded at both % full and at Va full. The decibel reading for the former was 61 dBs, and for the latter, 62 dBs. In these two experiments I heard the sound of the bowl copy as decidedly muffled. Finally, I filled the bowl with water; and recorded at % full and at Va full. In both cases there was no rattle sound at all. Moreover, it was difficult to move the bowl so as to activate the pellet rattles without spilling significant amounts of water. As a result, I surmise that material(s) placed in the bowl cavity would have a significant impact on the sound of the effigy bowl. The clearest rattle sound occurred when there was nothing in the bowl; and if a rattling sound was meant to be heard, at some point in its use a vessel that was empty may have been specified. The frequency waves for each adorno rattle scattered across the wave-form spectrum indicating only indefinite pitches. In other words, there was no discernable pitch center for any rattle in the sample, which is typical for soundmakers generating wildly fluctuating overtones. As a whole, the relative quiet volume level is the most conspicuous audio aspect of the five Lake George adorno rattles. In fact it is hard to imagine how they would have been heard in situations involving groups engaged in activities producing volume at or above normal volume levels. Theort ABOUT Use(s). Goetz offered an explanation for the low volume of the rattles based on present Muscogee cultural practices, indicating a connection between effigy rattles and leg rattles.18 She says that the soft sounds produced by the latter mimic the soft volume of a heartbeat; elaborating, "Imagine for a moment at our square grounds, the complete silence. In this silence, forty women standing waiting to hear the rhythm of the (tortoise-shell leg) rattle (initiated by the lead female dancer), and then gently patting the ground with their feet in time as they start to hear it. It is like laying your head on someone's chest and hearing their heart beat. This will sound a little dramatic, but it is as if your heart begins to beat with the sound. It is a true 240</page><page sequence="11">Music in Art XXXVI/ 1-2 (2011) 22. Ceramic copy of Mississippian-style effigy bowl with rattling adorno. Copy made by Valerie Hanks-Goetz. Photograph by author. symbol of one community. Let me add, not everyone has to hear the rattle, it sets the rhythm for those who can hear it and their feet pat the beat for those who cannot. Sound wise, the quiet volume of the adorno rattles is the right volume for a heart beat/' Teresa Horn, a Cherokee craftsperson, expands on Goetz' s asser- tion, claiming the sound of the adorno rattle represents the heartbeat of the clan animal depicted.19 What is more, the rattling, in effect, brings the animal to life. In other words, adorno rattles would be initially rattled to start the animals' heart, and conversely, the effigy rattle's destruction, symbolized by the termination of its sound, would represent its death.20 Native traditions are dynamic, of course, and what Goetz and Horn detail from traditions today lack evidence in the archaeological record. But there remain cultural metaphors that transcend time. These may have even more durability in non-literate societies, such as Mississippian, and particularly durable would be traditions accompanying ceremony.21 There will be more on this shortly. For Goetz, the Lake George ador- no rattle volume mimics the volume of a heartbeat, but also the rhythms induced by shaking the vessel in a metronomic pattern - through dancing - causes it to mimic the beat of the regular occurring pulse of a beating heart. An interesting aspect of adornos whose meaning may be revealed by archaeology is their location on vessel rims. Some were made so that the entity faces in and some so that the entity faces out. Viewed as a composition these different placements present contradictory messages. When the adorno faces in towards the vessel, the latter part of the object takes on the appearance of a stomach, as if an offering contained in it has been digested by the animal depicted by the effigy. When the adorno faces away, the vessel takes on the appearance of a back (even though concave), as if the animal depicted is carrying the offering. These diffe- rences may be quite significant as concerns function. In one case the entity represented is stationary, and in the other it is mobile. All of the rattling adornos with the effigy still attached to vessels that I have seen face out. Regrettably, the breaks along the necks of the Lake George adornos do not prove directionality of effigy placement on parent vessels, and thus it is unclear if these all faced out as do known whole-vessel examples. 241</page><page sequence="12">Mark Howell, Sonic-Iconic Examination of Adorno Rattles from the Mississippian-Era Lake George Site It is also worth noting that more than a few of the intact vessels affixed with adornos have two different entities represented, usually one opposite the other. In fact, there are examples of smaller ones placed on top of larger ones. There is even a bowl from the St. Francis River (Arkansas) area that has two rattling adornos, opposite each other (both are heads, representing the mythical "cat serpent").22 However, this is the only example I know of a compound rattling vessel. Ceremonies. What was the activity for which the Lake George adorno rattles were used, and what is more, could this activity have contributed to the status of the objects as found, i.e. having been separated from parent ceramic vessels? Goetz offers an opinion, again based on the cultural traditions of her people.23 "Each busk, or celebration of the maturation of the corn crop, is preceded by a time of fasting and prayer. At the end of the busk is a ceremonial time of dance, making of medicine, and other ceremonial things. But before 'break fasť is a gift of foods to the fire. Today, the offering is on paper plates, but I can imagine in the past the use of the ceramic bowls, rattling as the body moves with the dance of the clans carrying food to be presented to the fire. The bowls would be destroyed by the heat to insure that they would never be used again." In this scenario, archaeologically recovered adorno rattles might be expected to be attached to a section of a bowl or plate with a V-shaped sherd (as based on Goetz' s conclusions of the breakage patterns of Mississippian pottery [fig. 10]). Our five do not have this V-section, perhaps meaning that they contained no food offering; if in fact they were given to a New Fire in ceremony. Moreover, none appear to have suffered much damage, if any, by fire. According to Goetz, an additional part of the Muscogee New Year celebration as practiced today, is a cleansing of the home, heart, and mind.24 "All the grudges, hard feelings and 'dirt' of the Old Year are to be swept up along with the dirt in the home and burned in the Old Fire. The vessels carrying the 'dirt' of the Old Year are destroyed when the fire dies out so that this 'dirt' cannot continue into the New Year. Unlike for the food offering, the destructions in this ceremony are accelerated by probing staffs handled by men tending the fire." It is possible in Lake George examples that fire-tenders might have customarily knocked off the effigy heads with their staffs as part of the ritual destruction of Old- Year offerings. As rattles are part of the material culture, archaeologists may be able to answer this question through evidence of methods and points of destruction, and exposure to fire. What my experiments with an effigy bowl copy proved, is that any item(s) placed in the cavity of bowl would negatively affect rattling volume levels. As I mentioned, this led me to surmise that in the past the bowls may have been offered for sacrifice empty; or perhaps, the material(s) contained in them was dumped into a ceremonial fire before or without the bowls themselves. Whaťs more, even though rattling adornos clearly were made to rattle, and could be heard under certain circumstances, it is possible that their use in this capacity was not emphasized or may have even been nullified, say by filling them with water. If so, it is possible that the sounds of the Mississippian adorno rattles were intended to be heard by the ancestors or the gods alone, in which case their physical sound may not have mattered. CONCLUSION. In this paper there were five questions about five adorno rattles for which I sought answers. (1) Were the five intentionally made to rattle? I conclude that they were. This is indicated by x-rays showing the well-formed smoothness of the cavities and the pellets. Pellets in one rattle, hooded duck, in fact, may have been wrapped to separate them from the container walls during the ceramic manufacturing pro- cesses. (2) Where and when were they made? It is likely that at least one (the human head) was made at Lake George. This is because its temper is a combination of grog and shell, a unique ceramic formula for Coles Creek sites transitioning to Mississippian ones, such as Lake George. The other four adornos would need additional tests to confirm origin, but a good guess is that they too are local to Lake George. Furthermore, because Lake George has so many adorno rattles, as compared to those known from other sites, and because one of these rattles possibly predates Mississippian influence, these sounding objects may have been a specialty of the site. (3) Who used them and how? There is no conclusive answer to this question, although if they were found on a modest house mound near the mouth of the lake, as Butler's notes indicate, they may have been made for use by residents of the house. More likely, the effigies and the vessels they were attached to were destroyed at this location, possibly in ceremony. It is worth noting that the lake-side of the site is its oldest occupational area and as a result there may have been some significance attached to this locale because 242</page><page sequence="13">Music in Art XXXVI/ 1-2 (2011) of its age. Unfortunately, as the 1960s Lake George excavation by Harvard archaeologists Williams and Brain focused on only one house mound in the area, and as Butler does not specify the mound where these five adornos were found, specific provenience for the adornos is lacking.25 (4) What were they used for? Goetz and Horn answer by suggesting use in communal ceremonies, as this is where rattling is combined with offerings in southeastern Amerindian communities today. But this cannot be proved at present for Lake George times. And finally, (5) what did the sounds they make mean? There is no conclusive answer to this question either, as the original sounds have long been silenced. But Goetz and Horn suggest that the soft sounds of the five Lake George adorno rattles may have been used to mimic the soft sounds of heartbeats. More specifically, Horn stresses that they were the actual heartbeats of the clan entities depicted. To conclude; in this study I have looked into the nature of a sound. A sound heard in pre-Columbian America, a soft rattling sound emanating from anthro- and zoormorphic entities of clay made by people in a culture that flourished in the Southeast and Midwest of what is now the United States between 1050 and 1600 CE. My Amerindian friends believe their deductions about heartbeats and year end ceremonies are correct. And it is true that these women are steeped in the traditions of their ancestors. But their predecessor lived many hundreds of years ago and since that time their descendants have had to adapt to quickly changing life way s very different from those of the builders of Lake George. In light of these changes are the answers to my questions as given by Goetz and Horn any more reliable than those that could be supplied by you, or me, or someone else. Perhaps not, but the conclusions these women independently reach are at least informed by a tradition and method of acquiring knowledge. Among Amerindians whose traditional societies were without writing, continual re-imagining of culture was and remains an imperative. Native American cultures continue to exist only by being acted out, conversed about, and realized in speech and behavior. The anthropologist Karl Kroeber has stated that if the descendants of a pre-literate people stop talking about their culture, it vanishes.26 One suspects that it is the dynamic nature of talking across generations that underpins the quality of explanations. I would add that as listening is an active part of talking, listening for the soft sounds of a rattle or a clan animal heartbeat also transcends generations. Notes An earlier version of the paper was presented at the eleventh conference of the ICTM Study Group for Music Archaeology "Drawing on the Musical Past: Music Iconology, Instrument Making, and Experimental Playing in Music Archaeology,,/ held at the Graduate Center of the City University of New York, 23-26 September 2009. 1 Other names given to these objects are rim riders and rim effigies. 2 Butler's collection is divided between the Mississippi De- partment of Archives and History (MDAH) and the American Museum of Natural History. Harvard University has a few eigh- teenth-century glass trade beads that were donated by MDAH from part of its collection. 3 Butler, who had been a Colonel in the United States military, was living in Enola, Mississippi, in 1893, when he began his correspondence with the MDAH. Other addresses in his correspondences include Brevoort, Mississippi; the Brevoort But- ler Estate, Mississippi; and Lake George Plantation, Mississippl. (None of the last three now exists.) According to his notes, Butler collected //relics,/ from all over the world, which in addition to archaeological artifacts included stamps, coins, rocks, and mine- rals, and in one infamous case a fake Egyptian mummy (although Butler apparently believed it to be real). He or his estate donated or sold MDAH 58 boxes and crates of items, including archaeo- logical material that originated in Mississippl. Butler kept ex- tensive notes on his collection, even if some of his notes contradict those pertaining to the same materials in other notebooks. Nevertheless, regarding his Native American artifacts, his notes typically include an assigned catalogue number, the state (of the United States of America) found (if from the USA), a short description of the object, some of its dimensions, the material it was made from, where it was found, and often by whom. In some cases he even included a small drawing of the artifact next to his catalogue number. The majority of his Mississippi artifacts origi- nated in Yazoo County, the county he resided in for most, if not all, of his adult life. Most of his other Mississippi collection came from adjacent counties in the Delta or those in the nearby bluffs. 4 Clarence B.

Some of these types transcend categories, but to my knowledge only the rim effigy type rattle. 9 V.

Hathcock claims that the wood duck is the most popular subject for effigy rims. 11 Dennis Tedlock and Barbara Tedlock, eds., Teachings from the American Earth: Indian Religion and Philosophy (New York: Live- right Press, 1992), 201-202.

Hanks-Goetz, personal communication, August 2009. 13 See Ray Hathcock, Ancient Indian Pottery of the Mississippi River Valley. His picture book of Mississippian-era ceramic objects includes enough photographs of rattling and non-rattling adornos in the context of other pottery objects to currently rank as a survey. Hathcock7 s publication features ceramic artifacts from what is termed the Middle Mississippi River Valley (delineated on the south and north by the junctions of the Arkansas and Illinois Rivers respectively); an area that archaeologists regard as the heartland of the Mississippian culture (particularly as it includes the environs of Cahokia). Of the 600 pottery examples of all categories listed in the book, approximately 100 are bowls with rim adornos (a handful of these 100 could be considered other category types). Of that 100, four are described as rattling. Therefore, some 16% of this large pottery collection consists of effigy bowls, with .04% of that number constituting the rattling variety, or .006% of the ceramic artifact total. For comparison, of the 70 ceramic artifacts in the Winterville Mounds Museum, seven are bowls with solid adornos, or 10%, and there are no rattling ones. That none of the Winterville effigies rattle and that only .04 % of those in the Hathcock book do indicates the scarcity of the soundmaking variety. 14 Some of these are Kinkaid (Illinois), Cahokia (Illinois), Sikeston Ridge (Missouri), Belle Meade (Mississippi), and assort- ed St. Francis River sites (Arkansas). 15 Additional authorities consulted on adorno rattles in the Mississippi River Valley include: Sherry Stinson, avocational archaeologist, Belzoni, Mississippi; John Conaway, staff archaeol- ogist with the MDAH, Clarksdale, Mississippi; Timothy Pauketat, Professor, Department of Anthropology, University of Illinois; and Janet Ford, Associate Professor, Department of Anthropol- ogy, University of Mississippl. All four have encountered effigy rattles in their archaeology and/ or curatorial work. And although many reports on large Mississippian sites reviewed for this chapter do not list adorno rattles, I suspect that most had some. In cases where they are fragmentary their remains may have been misidentified. 16 Thermoluminescense, a chemical method used to date ce- ramics, could pin point not only the time but the place of manu- facture - or at least where the clay came from - but this is a some- what expensive process and requires partial destruction of the object. 17 Dried corn, corn meal, and water were selected because they may have been offered in Mississippian ritual (s). 18 V.
