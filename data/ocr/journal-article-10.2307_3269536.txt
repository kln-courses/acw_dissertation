<plain_text><page sequence="1">Numen, Vol. XXV, Fasc. 3 THE RELIGIOUS SIGNIFICANCE OF DIVINE MULTIPLE BODY PARTS IN THE ATHARVA VEDA I It is well known that multiple body parts is one of the most charac- teristic features attributed to the divine in Indian art. Less well known is that this iconographic convention has an extensive literary usage prior to its plastic appearance around the Christian era. From the outset of its literary usage, the range of divinity described with multiple body parts and forms is noticeably restricted. In the Rig Veda, the earliest text within the Vedic tradition, the multiplicity convention mainly defines those deities associated with the act of cosmic crea- tion. 1 Of the several creation theories set forth in the Rig Veda, 2 one cosmogonic view concurs well with the divine multiplicity image. This mythopoeic view understands cosmic creation as an intensification of the human birth-giving process. Just as a mother gives birth by emitting from her own body the completely structured form, so a creator god emits from his own being the forms that comprise the phenomenal world. A creator god is able to emit, or 'give birth' as it were, to the universe because he encloses within himself the totality of parts and forms comprising phenomenal diversity. 3 Cosmic partu- rition is thus the underlying religious significance of divine multiple bodily parts and forms in the Rig Veda. 4 The present study aims to isolate the multiplicity references in the 1 Doris Srinivasan, "The Religious Significance of Multiple Bodily Parts to Denote the Divine: Findings from the Rig Veda", Asiatische Studien, XXIX, 2 (I975), 137-I79--hereafter cited as "RV Multiplicity". 2 W. Norman Brown, "Theories of Creation in the Rig Veda", JAOS 85 (1965), 23-34. 3 Srinivasan, "RV Multiplicity", 178. 4 Possibly the theory of cosmic parturition goes back to an Indo-Iranian stratum. Note the idea (cited by J. de Menasce "Le temoignage de Jayhdni sur le mazdeisme", Donum natalicium H. S. Nyberg oblatum [Uppsala, 19541, p. 52), that Ohrmazd (the later form of Ahura Mazda) produces the whole world out of himself. Divine multiplicity also appears in the Avesta. For example, Mithra, in Mihir Yasht XXI. 82, has " thousand senses" [ears?] "and ten thousand eyes..." (see James Darmesteter, The Zend-Avesta, in Sacred Books of the East 32 [1883], Pt. 2, 139-140; fn. I, p.

Second, this study (allied to the investigation of a broader problem) is undertaken to advance a general understanding of the religious significance of multiple bodily parts and forms in Vedic literary developments of the first millennium B.C. 5 In both respects, the AV is most instructive. The importance of the AV for the purposes of this study lies in the extraordinary span of the material. Although the AV is assuredly younger in compilation than the Rig Veda (RV), it contains themes that are undoubtedly older than many rgvedic subjects. 6 At the same time, about one seventh of the AV consists of passages parallel with the RV; however, the AV sam.hita often amplifies upon the material shared-in variant wordings or word order-with the RV sa.mhiti. In the area of cosmogonic speculation, the AV does more than en- large upon the speculative thoughts in the RV; the AV invents a variety of creative Powers and details concerning their omnipotent quality, their creative activity, the relationship between the Power and the empiric world and the possibility of gaining knowledge of the Powers, which surpass in originality and speculative complexity the Rig Vedic cosmogonic notions. 7 The degree of complexity approxi- mates the speculations 8 of the Yajur Veda Samrhitis and the main Brdhmanas. 9 Indeed, the level of cosmogonic speculation in the hymns of the AV may best be described as pre-Upanisadic, and as such, leading into the ferment of thought represented by the oldest of these philo- 5 A series of philological inquiries into the religious significance of multiple bodily parts in Vedic texts is part of a larger study in progress and dealing with the religious significance of the multiplicity convention in early Indian art. The philological analyses terminate with texts dating roughly to the beginning of the Christian era. This terminus ad quem coincides with the regular appearance in Indian iconography of the multiplicity convention. 6 Jan Gonda (Vedic Literature, Vol. I, fasc. I, in A History of Indian Litera- ture [Wiesbaden, 19751, P. 275), rightly cautions us to "distinguish between the time at which poems were composed, the periods in which their component parts or the ideas expressed were moulded into concrete form... and the period of ultimate codification...". 7 Cf.

Speculative content is only a small portion of the AV. The samhitd consists mainly of magical and ritual formulas. 12 It is in these hymns that herbs, plants, grains, amulets, animals, etc. are attributed divinity and addressed to appease evil, bless the sacrificer and curse his ene- mies. While such prayers and charms are present in the other samhitds, they are more prevalent in the AV. References to multiple bodily parts and forms occur in the speculative, magical and ritualistic hymns of the AV. These references were collected in the following manner: I. Numerical terms were checked in W. D. Whitney, Index Verborum to the published text of the Atharva-Veda (New Haven, 1881), for possible nominal, adjectival or compound usage with the bodily parts or forms of a deity, divine principle, or magical entity. 2. Collective terms such as visva-, puru-, visvatas were checked in the same way. 3. Scanned also in the Index were terms (e.g. tanai-, dhaman-, ripa-, naman-) which when declined in the plural denote or imply multiple bodies or forms of divine beings, principles and magical entities. In this way, around 55 multiplicity references were noted in the ?aunakiya recension of the Atharva Veda (hereafter AV?). 13 About 10 N. J.

It should be clear from the above methodological statement, that Whitney's Index</page><page sequence="4">196 Doris Srinivasan two-thirds of these passages deal with cosmogonic or cosmographic themes. There is a high degree of correlation between the significance of the multiplicity references in these passages and the above mentioned Rig Vedic findings. As will be shown in Section II below, almost every divinity described with the multiplicity convention is either a creator god already associated with the convention in the RV, or a creative principle specifically invented by the Atharvan poets to ex- press their speculative probings. Further, the theory of creation as cosmic parturition also continues. Section III contains an analysis of those multiplicity passages appearing in the magic saiktas. In these passages the multiplicity image is not applied to a creator god; never- theless its meaning in these references reflects its meaning in the cosmogonic and cosmographic contexts. II A considerable number of the AV divinities denoted by multiple bodily parts and forms stem from the older stratum of Rig Vedic thought. Varuna, Rudra, Indra, Agni, Sfirya, Tvastr and a Cosmic Bull are already represented with multiple parts and forms in their capacity as part of a particular group of creator gods. In the RV, these gods belong to a group of deities called Asuras. Though the subject of much controversy, the meaning of the term asura- appears to be 'a being', in particular 'a High Being' possessing asu- ('life, vital energy'). 14 In the RV, asura- is not solely applied to gods; it may equally well designate a demon, thus indicating the original ambivalent served as the primary tool in finding AV multiplicity references. As this is an index of the words in the AVS recension, the present paper likewise reflects this emphasis. However, variant readings are noted as found in the Kashmirian AVP, edited and emended by L. C. Barret, The Kashmirian A tharva Veda in JAOS 26-50 (Bks. 1-15); (Bk. 6 in JAOS 34 by Edgerton); Bks. 16 and 17 in AOS 9 (New Haven, 1936); Bk. 18 in JAOS 58; Bks. I9 and 20 in AOS 18 (New Haven, 1940). The Orissa ms. of the AVP, edited by D. Bhattacharyya, Paippaldda Samhitd of the Atharvaveda I (Book I), Calcutta, 1964; II (Books II-IV) Calcutta, 1970, has not been available to me. For a comparison between Book I of the AVS and Book I of the AVP (both Orissan and Kashmirian mss.), see L. Renou, "Notes sur la version 'Paippaldda' de l'Atharva-Veda", Journ. Asiatique, vol. 252 (1964), 421-450; vol. 253 (1965), 15-42. 14 The term asura- may be understood as derived from the noun asu- plus the suffix -ra-.

This power is often referred to by the term maya-. 16 Maya enables an Asura to create phenomenal forms (raipas). 17 The forms thus created may be the material forms in the empiric world, or they may be the visible outer forms or manifestations of the supreme being. Already within the RV, this group of creator gods is supplanted in the younger sections by demi- urges whose creative energy, no longer dependent upon maya, is stimulated by the power of the Vedic sacrifice. 18 It is thus of con- siderable interest that the AV retains numerous references to the multiple body parts and forms of gods who in the RV represent an older layer of thought on cosmogony and divine manifestation. A word about the use of asura- in the AV. Its predominant usage, in the plural, is to designate a demonic group at conflict with the Vedic gods. 19 However, a degree of ambivalence still adheres to the term. A few plural occurrences refer to benevolent High Beings capable of wielding creative power. In AV? 6.1o8.3 Asuras are said to have wisdom; in AV 10.10.26 (AVP 16.Io9 which reads surah) and 8.9.24 (AVP 16.20) they are included in a series enumerating positive creatures inhabiting the ordered Vedic universe. Three references link Asuras with maya. Asuras, says AV? 8.10.22 (AVP 16.135) subsist on maya; the compound asuramaya- used in AV 3.9.4 (AVP 3.7-5) shows the close connection the Atharvans made between the two con- cepts. Further, AV 6.72.1 indicates acquaintance with the notion that 15 This was first pointed out by A. Bergaigne, La Religion Vidique III (Paris, 1883), 67-88. 16 Maya has been defined in the Veda as "incomprehensible insight, wisdom, judgment and power enabling its possessor to create something or to do some- thing ascribed to mighty beings". (J. Gonda, Four Studies in the Language of the Veda [The Hague, 1959], p. 126). 17 See Srinivasan, "RV Multiplicity", 143-162. Several verses to Indra (called asura in RV 1.174.1; 8.90.6, etc.) give clear indication of the power of mayd. RV 3.53.8 ab says that Indra is in the habit of becoming every riepa, in effecting mayds around his own body, and verse RV 6.47.I8c says that this characteristic of Indra's-to be 'multiform' (pururapa-)-is due to his mayas. Given the basic meaning of maya, it must be inferred that maya in these verses applies to the special ability of a divine Being to create ripa. 18 Cf. Brown, "Theories", 26-27. 19 Asura- is used in this sense in AVS 2.27.3,4; 4.23.5; 6.7.2,3; 8.5.3; 9.2.I7,18; 10.3.2,II; io.6.Io; I1.5.7.</page><page sequence="6">198 Doris Srinivasan the maya of an Asura can create wondrous forms (v'pus-). 20 When used in the singular, the majority of references denote a deity. 21 Among those Rig Vedic asura gods designated with multiple bodily parts who continue to be similarly described in the AV, Agni and Varuna are foremost. A. Varuna The Atharva Veda maintains the exaltedness attributed to Varuna in the RV. 22 Varuna is the great ruler (AVg 4.16.1), the best among the gods (AVg 6.21.2). As in the RV, he is the asura par excellence (AV I.Io.I; 4.15.12; 5.11.). 23 He is the son of the goddess Aditi (AV 5.1.9) herself an Asura, whose prominent Vedic characteristics are conception and motherhood. 24 But only rarely is Varuna a creator of forms (e.g. AV 5.1.8.). Probably his dominant trait in the AV is his sovereignty which extends everywhere (cf. AV 4.16.3, 5). Varuna's majestic and all-comprehensive nature is expressed by the god's omniscience, and this trait is represented by a multiplicity of eyes. Since sight often correlates with wisdom, 25 a limitless number of eyes symbolizes Varuna's infinite knowledge. Thus in the RV, Varuna is said to have 'a thousand eyes' (7.34.Io viruna... 20 AVS 6.72 represents a typical magic sakta.

Whitney, Atharva-Veda Sainhita, Vol. I [Cambridge, 19051, 335-hereafter cited as: Whitney, A V) as a black snake which spreads itself making wondrous forms by means of the Asura's maya. For a discussion on the erotic in the AV, see Shende, Religion, Chap. II. 21 The only example of a demonic Asura (sing.) is in AV 8.6.5. 22 Cf. N. J. Shende, The Foundations of the Atharvanic Religion, (Poona, 1949), Pp. 280-285. A different view expressed by A. A. Macdonell (Vedic Mythology [Strassburg, 18971, pp. 25-26) is too limited. 23 Interestingly, all these passages are in what is generally regarded as the original AVS. 24 These characteristics form the basis for an AV multiplicity reference to her. Aditi is the mother of the Adityas (Macdonell, Vedic Myth. p. 122); the Adityas form part of the Asura class of divine beings (W. Norman Brown, "The Creation Myth of the Rig Veda," JAOS 62 [1942], 88). Although the number of Aditi's offspring fluctuate in the Vedas (see A. Hillebrandt, Vecdische Mythologie II, reprint of 2nd. ed. [Hildesheim, 1965] 87ff.), there are references in the RV (10.72.8), AVS (8.9.21) and 1B (III. 1.3.2) to the eight sons of Aditi. In consequent, AVS 8.9.21c assigns eight wombs (aqtayoni-) to the goddess; AVP (16.19) has the variant reading aftau dhadmni. 25 Cf. J.

AV 10.10.28 27 (AVP 16.1o9) mentions the three tongues that shine within the mouth of Varuna, and of these the one which glistens in the middle is the Cow (va&amp;id-, probably 'a barren cow', usually reserved for Brahmans either for their honorarium or for sacrificial offering 28). Vala in this hymn becomes transfigured, upon being offered, into an omnipotent divinity; she becomes the Urgrund out of which the universe is shaped. 29 The meaning of 'three tongues' and the significance of vasa- as the third tongue can only be surmised. Perhaps the 'tongues' represent 'fire'; in RV 3.20.2 Agni's three tongues probably represent the fires on each of the three fire altars. 30 In support of the fire image are the verbs Vdi and Vraf" ('to glisten, shine, glitter, reign' 31) used in AV? 10.10.28. However there is difficulty in pursuing this image further as Varuna is not closely connected with the fire or the sacrifice in the RV or AV. It is more likely that the 'three tongues' somehow emphasize the greatness of Varuna. The number 'three' signifies 'totality' and 'completeness'; 32 perhaps Varuna comprises the entire cosmic material of which the Cow forms a third. An analogy between a mouth enclosing a tongue and Varuna enclosing the world (usually considered tripartite33) may 26 The number 'a thousand' (sahasra-) expresses the notion of 'limitless, total' (cf.

Varuna's ability to encompass the Cow is reite- rated in the same hymn where she is said to have 'entered into the belly of Varuna'. 34 B. Rudra Like Varuna, Rudra is characterized by omniscience; the god is described with 'a thousand eyes' (sahasraksa-) more frequently than any other AV deity (AVe 11.2.3, 7, 17 = AVP 16.1o4 and 105 with variants for vs. 7). AV 11.2.17 elaborates on Rudra's infinite knowledge calling him "manifoldly wise" (bahudhd vipas'cit-) and "overseeing all" (Bloomfield, AV [see fn. 35], I57). Bhava and 8arva, who in the Yajur Veda are absorbed into the godhead Rudra, but who remain separate though closely associated with him in the AV (e.g. AVH 11.2.14, 16) are likewise called 'thousand eyed' (AVg 4.28.3; epithet omitted in AVP 4.37) undoubtedly to accentuate their affinity to Rudra. 35 The power of omniscience, though not attributed to Rudra in the RV, harmonizes well with one facet of this ambivalent Vedic god. 36 In the RV, the asura-power is an intrinsic part of Rudra's nature (see RV 2.33-9). As such he is considered a High Being, endowed with special vital power and energy (ugra-37), and capable of creating multiple outer forms (pururaipa-) which may be considered his phe- nomenal manifestations (2.33.9; see Srinivasan, "RV Multiplicity", I64ff). 38 His dominion over the world (of which he is 'the father' Verhandelingen der Koninklijke Nederlandse Akademie van Wetenschappen, afd.

Henry, Les Livres X, XI et XII de l'Atharva-Veda (Paris, 1896), pp. 37; 88. 35 The distinction in the AV between Rudra on the one hand and Bhava and Sarva on the other is well summarized by R. G. Bhandarkar, VaiS.navism, Saivism and Minor Religious Systems (Strassburg, 1913), par. 80. Gonda opines (Savayajilas, 362) that Bhava and Sarva are popular divinities. M. Bloomfield (Hymns of the Atharva-Veda in Sacred Books of the East 42, repr. [Delhi, 1964], 618-hereafter cited as Bloomfield, A V) believes them to be embodi- ments (miarti) of Rudra and not separate deities. So also Shende (Foundations, p. 278) who understands Bhava and Sarva to represent the creator and destroyer aspects of Rudra. 36 Cf. J. Gonda, Vimnuism and Sivaism (London, 1970), pp. 1-17. 37 See J. Gonda, Ancient-Indian ojas, Latin *augos and the Indo-European nouns in -es-/-os (Utrecht, 1952); Gonda, SavayajRas, 421. 38 AVS 7.87.1 (AVP 20.32 with variants) states that Rudra is in fire, within waters and has entered (a Vvis) herbs and plants. The verse thus testifies to the</page><page sequence="9">Divine Multiple Body Parts in the Atharva Veda 201 RV 6.49.10 and 'master' f~ana- 2.33-9) continues to be expounded in the AV. AV, 11.2.10, in addressing Rudra as Ugra (an epithet later applied to ?iva) states: 'Thine are the four directions, thine is the sky, thine is the earth, O Ugra, thine is this spacious atmosphere. Thine is all this which has spirit (atman-) and which is breathing upon earth.' As this verse shows, the AV assigns new dimensions to the Rudra image; the majestic side of Rudra becomes intensified (as does the destructive side, illustrated in other verses of this hymn 39). With this increase in grandeur, omniscience may well come to be ascribed to Rudra. It may also be the result of Rudra's identification with Agni in the AV (e.g. AV 7.87.1). The fusion of Agni-Rudra (important in the steady rise of Rudra) is an Atharvanic innovation. In the RV, omniscience is central to Agni's nature and this trait causes Agni to have 'a thousand eyes' (e.g. 10.79.5; 1.79.12; see Srinivasan, "RV Multiplicity," 158). Perhaps as Agni and Rudra merge in the AV, Agni's omniscience comes to be attributed to Rudra. It is certainly noteworthy in this connection that in the AV Agni loses the attribute. C. Indra As noted above (see fn. 17), the RV describes Indra's ability to be 'multiform' (pururaipa-) that is, to have the capacity to create or project multiple phenomenal forms which are the visible manifesta- tions of his transcendental powers. The AV sustains this image. In AV? 6.99.1 Indra is called purinaman- 'the many-named One.' Purunaman is congruent with the concept pururfipa. A 'name' desig- nates a distinct apprehensible existence which is concretized in 'a form'; together 'name and form' express phenomenal individuality. 40 A variety of Indra's forms are mentioned in AV? 17.1.13 where each belief that Rudra's transcendent power can be revealed in externality by trans- posing itself (i.e., 'entering') into a tangible form. The verb dV vi' is often used to describe the 'entering' of a power into a phenomenal form; the form then constitutes the visible location wherein the power is manifested (i.e., dhaman). A V vil is frequently used in this manner to show the transposition of Soma's power into the form of soma juice (see Srinivasan, "RV Multiplicity", 154). Other examples cited by Gonda (Savayajfias, p. 289) are illness entering the human body (AV 1.12.3), brdhman entering into the structure of man (AV 10.2.33), speech in heaven and earth (RV 10.125.6 = AV 4.30.5); see also AV 3.29.7; 5-1.2; 7.82.4; 10.7.35. 39 Bhandarkar, Vaisnavism, Saivism, par. 81. 40 See M. Falk, Nama-riipa and dharma-rfpa (Calcutta, 1943), Chaps. I and II.</page><page sequence="10">202 Doris Srinivasan one is called a different 'body' (taniJ- 41) of the god. Thus, Indra is said to have a 'body' in the waters, and others on earth, within fire, in soma (called 'the heaven-knowing' or 'heaven-winning [svarvid-] purified One') and in the atmosphere. 42 Indra's ability to project phenomenal forms is also implied in AV I17.1.I0. In this verse Indra has a dear location (dhaman-, i.e. a place, being or phenomenon 43) wherein Indra's transcendental power manifests itself. Dhaman not only refers to a phenomenal location wherein the presence of the numinous is experienced, it also refers to the particular way the numen locates or projects a mode of its nature into externality. 44 Thus Indra, in these AV verses, is portrayed as a divinity capable of projecting different manifest forms which are the visible locations of his numinous powers. 45 D. Agni Regarding Agni, the AV continues the multiplicity images of the RV, although the latter provides many more penetrating details. In the 41 Tanzi primarily designates the corporeal body of a person (A. B. Keith, The Religion and Philosophy of the Veda and Upanishads, Vol. II [Cambridge, Mass., 19251, 486). In AVS 17.1.13 tan?i- connotes a particular manifestation or 'aspect' of the divine. So also in AVS 9.2.25 the tan-as of Kama seem to be man's dhis ('thoughts').# Tanit- may also denote a body assumed by the deceased upon entering heaven (K. G. Geldner, Der Rig-Veda Vol. III [Cambridge, Mass., 1951] ad 10.15.14 d). Cf. L. Renou, Ptudes Vediques et Pdnindennes IV (Paris, 1958), 20:"tanui est souvent ... 'corps mystique". This series is hereafter cited as EVP. R. N. Dandekar ("God in Hindu Thought", Annals of the Bhandarkar Oriental Res. Inst., Golden Jubilee Vol. [1968], 458) notes that tanfis are "appearances in certain specific aspects which latter may be co-existent (this concept having been developed more particularly in Saivism)". 42 Maghavan (a frequent epithet of Indra) is assigned 'a hundred bodies' in AV 13.4.44. However, these tangis may belong to Rohita, who in this hymn is identified with many different gods, including Indra (AVg 13.4.2). It may be surmised from Keith's summary of Indra in the Vedas (Rel. and Phil., Chap. 9) that it becomes characteristic for Indra to take on deceptive forms. He assumes different female forms for love of a woman (AVg 7.38.2; the Subrahmanyd litany [JB II. 79; SB III. 3-4.18]); or different animal forms including that of a ram (also in the Subrahmanya litany; see Keith, ibid., p. 133).

These three natural phenomena are considered to be the visible locations of Agni's transcendental 'Fire' power. 47 As terrestial fire, Agni is believed to be present in both domestic fires and the three ritual fires situated in each of the Vedic altars. In this way, three bodily parts and forms are characteristically associated with Agni in the RV. Some of these Rig Vedic notions are reflected in AV 5.27.1. Pada Id calls him an Asura, Son of Himself (tdnandpat-) and many-handed (bhdripdnii-). Agni is Tanainapat in the sense that the numinous Fire power gives rise to the 'son' which is the phenomenal fire form (tana-). 48 Bharipani- (AVP 9.1 reads vilvavedas- 'possessed of all knowledge') may connote 'liberality' as does another epithet of Agni, dravinodd ("Giver of Wealth", AV? 19.3.2). The tanais of Agni are several times mentioned in AV verses. The auspicious tanais in AV 18.2.8 are clearly associated with the cre- matory flames which carry the corpse to a yonder 'place of the pious' (sukf.tdm u lokdm). In AV? 19.3.2 Agni is asked to come to the wor- shipper with all his tanfis. Agni's triple forms continue to be alluded to. In AV` 18.4.11, he is "triply-disposed" (tredhd Whitney, AV II, 874), and it is likely that the 'three-named One' (i.e. the One having three forms) in AV? 6.74.3 is Agni. 49 AV? 13.3.21 speaks of Agni's triple birthplace; here Agni is probably identified with Rohita, the supreme god of all the hymns in Book 13. 50 AVS 13.1.12 presents a similar case. Verse 46 Srinivasan, "RV Multiplicity", 157-162. 47 For details on Agni's complex transcendental nature, see Srinivasan, ibid. 48 So also J. Gonda, Die Religionen Indiens I (Stuttgart, I96O), 72; Cf. Keith, Rel. and Phil. I, 166. 49 So also Whitney (AV I, 337 who cites this as the only occurrence of trinaman-) and Bloomfield (AV, 135). Sdyana understands the threefold fire of the earth, atmosphere and sky, or the threefold fire of the sacrifice. Cf. RV 3.20.3 where Agni is said to have 'many names'. 50 For a discussion on Rohita in Bk. 13, see below. The triple births of the gods (deva-) mentioned in verse 21 recall the traditional Vedic classification of deities as terrestial, atmospheric and celestial (see Macdonell, Vedic Myth. p. 19).</page><page sequence="12">204 Doris Srinivasan 12, addressed to 'the thousandhorned bull, Jitavedas', certainly appears to invoke Agni. Jdtavedas (lit. 'knowing all created beings') is an epithet closely associated with Agni in the RV and AV; also Agni is 'a bull with a thousand horns' in RV 5.1.8 and possibly RV 7.55.7 (= AV 4.5.1 51). However, the hymn extols Rohita's superiority over many gods including Agni (see vs. 25; cf. AV I13.3.13). Probably vs. 12 assumes an identity between Agni and Rohita who has absorbed the epithets and powers of the former. 52 Terrestial fire accounts for additional multiplicity imagery. As the flaming fire extends on all sides, so Agni, praised as the earthly fire, is said to be facing in every direction (visvatomukha-; AV 4-33.6a = RV I.97.6a). 53 The sacrificial flames receiving the ritual offering are spoken of as 'the seven mouths' of Agni. 54 The number 'seven' has sacerdotal associations; 55 for example, there are seven officiating priests. The ritualistic connotation of 'seven' probably accounts for the symbolism in AV 4.39.1o0. This symbolism is carried further in that the flames are also conceived as Agni's multiple tongues (cf. AV? 6.76.1, in AVP 19.15). Already in the RV, Agni's 'flame' is meta- phorically referred to as his 'tongue' (cf. RV 2.1.13) and his three tongues in RV 3.20.2 probably represent the fires in the three altars. E. ?yena The heavenly eagle (Syena), deity of AV8 7.41 is a symbol of the sun. 56 Verse 2 (occurring in AVP 20.9 with some variants) describes the bird as 'a thousand-footed' (sahasrapad-) and 'hundred-wombed' (satayoni-). Sahasrapad- occurs as an epithet of Stirya in RV 8.69.16 51 Inasmuch as 'horns' are the metaphorical equivalent of 'flames' (Nighantu I.17), the multiplicity image attributes 'limitless fire power' to Agni in the Rig Vedic verses and to Agni/Rohita in AVS 13.1.12. 52 Renou (ETVP II, 86) and Bloomfield (AV ad 13.1) recognize the close association between Agni and Rohita, but they vacillate in advocating the iden- tification of Agni with Rohita. 53 Cf. Srinivasan, "RV Multiplicity", 162.

It is likely therefore that being 'a hundred- wombed' connotes the limitless capacity for imparting life which is allied to conferment of vigor. 58 In sum, the eagle as depicted in AV? 7.41.2b symbolizes the unlimited radiant power of the sun which has a limitless capacity for creation and can bestow vigor. Cosmic parturition, the theory responsible for the divine multi- plicity imagery in the RV, continues as a creation theory in the AV. Indeed the AV gives clear demonstration of the analogy between human and cosmic conception. AV? 14.2 is a hymn describing nuptial cere- monies. Verse 32 is used in Kau0ika suitra 79.6 59 when a bride enters the nuptial bed; the verse appears to be a blessing upon the bride for abundant offspring. She is described in 32cd as being 'all-formed (vilvarapa-) with greatness, rich in future offspring' and instructed to unite with her husband to produce the desired progeny. Evidently the female is vizvarapa- because the forms of future offspring are thought to be within her. An explanation of how the forms get inside the female's womb is given in verse 5 of AV 5.25, a hymn for success- ful conception; 60 here it is indicated that the great Fashioner or 57 On pad as 'foot' and 'ray' of the sun, see Srinivasan, "RV Multiplicity," 162-163. M. Bloomfield ("The Legend of Soma and the Eagle", JAOS 16 [18941, 12-13) considers the 'eagle' as 'lightning-fire', observing that nrcaks.h in v. 2 points directly to Agni, and s'ivah (in v. I) may also show Agni on the way to assimilation with Rudra-Siva. However, Agni is also solar fire. Further, the epithet sahasrapad- occurs neither in the RV or the AV in connection with Agni in his lightning form. S5yana on sahasrapad- in AV 7.41.2: a thousand rays. 58 Sdyana on 'atayonih in AV 7.41.2: atasya aparimitasya karyasya karanabhitah aparimitaphalasya misrayita va. Note that Sayana assumes, quite rightly, that data in this compound does not indicate a numerical concept, but rather attributes the notion of 'boundlessness' to the noun. Thus .data- has the same connotations as sahasra- when used in conjunction with a multiple bodily part or form. 59 The Kau'ika-Sfitra, the most valuable accessory text of the AV, joins the AVS recension and deals with material usually considered in the Grhya-Sfitras. The Kaus. S. is frequently an excellent indicator of the ritual application of Saunakiya verses as mantras and rites are closely correlated (Gonda, Vedic Literature, p. 278). 60 KauJ. S. 35.5 quotes the hymn in a ceremony for conception of a male (pum.nsavana).</page><page sequence="14">206 Doris Srinivasan Carpenter, Tvastr, fashions (VPpi, also 'to hew out,' or 'to carve') the forms (rf7pa-) within the womb. Tvastr, one of the oldest demiurges in the Rig Veda, is eminently suited for this extraordinary deed since on a cosmic level he engages in similar activity: 61 he fashions (Vpis~ AV 5-12.9) with forms heaven and earth and all beings (bh~vanani viMva). 62 AV 18.1.5 elaborates further saying that Tvastr is himself visvaraipa-, and that he, the vivifier, contains in his own womb male and female forms. 63 The implication, of course, is that these forms are emitted into externality by the god. AV8 6.78 (occurring in AVP 19.16), a hymn employed by Kaus. S. (78.10o, 14) in marriage cere- monies also emphasizes Tvastr's ability to emit forms. Verse 3 says that Tvastr 'generated' (jan) the wife as well as the man destined to be her husband. These notions on cosmic creation relate closely to those on human conception. On the cosmic plane, Tvastr is viLvaraipa- because his womb contains all potential phenomenal forms; on the human plane, the bride is called vi.varcapa- for essentially the same reason. Cosmogony is therefore viewed as an intensification of human parturition; this view the AV inherits from the RV. AV 9.4 (AVP 16.24-26 64) gives further evidence that the AV is familiar with the notion of cosmic parturition caused by an omniform creator. The hymn refers to a Cosmic Bull who is there in the beginning 61 Note that TvaStr is, in the RV, an asura who possesses maya. Cf. RV 10.53.9. 62 The etymological meaning of bhuvana- appears to be "the place of becoming", an idea which may include that of 'place (or persons) in which becoming (prospering, growing, being, existing) takes place or has taken place" (J. Gonda, "Bhuvana-", Vishveshvaranand Indological Journal, Vol. 5, [1967], 47.). Vilva- frequently combines with bhuvana-; it serves as "the adjective for analytical and enumerative totality" according to Gonda (ibid., p. 49). Thus bhuvandni visva refers to all living creatures in the world. On Tvastr's creativity cf. Hillebrandt, Vedische Mythologie II, 381; Srinivasan, "RV Multiplicity", 143ff.

Then only he and the Waters existed, or as pdda 2a says, in referring to the primeval Bull: 'He... in the beginning became the counterpart (pratim&amp;) of the Waters'. These Waters are the fertilizing Cosmic Waters, and in being their 'counterpart' the Bull is likewise established as a primordial fertilizing force. In this capacity he is visvarapa- (vs. 22 65). The significance of the epithet is reaffirmed in the first verse of this hymn where the Bull is described as an 'impetuous 66 Bull, full of milk and bearing all forms in his bellies' (pl.). 67 Thus the Cosmic Bull, much like Tvastr, carries all forms of phenomenal reality in his several bellies (vaksadnd-) which may be likened to female breasts or wombs. 68 But several seemingly contra- dictory features are here ascribed to the Cosmic Bull: in being both impetuous and possessed of milk and womb-like bellies, he is asso- ciated with both masculine and feminine attributes. Verse 3ab continues the bi-sexual imagery: 'a male [yet] pregnant, strong, 69 rich in milk, the Bull carries a vessel of wealth'. 70 Evidently, the Cosmic Bull is conceived to be an androgynous being, carrying in his wombs all phenomenal forms which the poet calls his 'vessel of wealth'. The aim is to define a primordial self-seminating force empowered to conceive forms. 71 The Cosmic Bull, pregnant with phenomenality is offered by the 65 An actual sacrificial bull, subject of the entire hymn, is identified in vs. 22 with the Cosmic Bull who is 'of tawny form, of the atmosphere [is this his divine station? On nabhasa- Gonda (The Savayajias, p. 322): "of the nature of clouds"], possessing energy, the virile strength of Indra, omniform...'. Although one term (ryabhd-) is used throughout AVS 9.4 to designate this bull, the animal is seen from three different aspects; these are ritually and esoterically connected within the hymn. In verses 9, I8, 19 the bull appears to be the animal presented as a gift to the Brahman[s]; however, 'the bull' as sacrificial victim is never far from view (cf. vss. Id. [see Renou, EVP II, 94]; 6cd [see Gonda, Savayaifias, p. 314 ad vs. 6]; Io). In addition, the animal is mystically conceived as a divine being of extraordinary power (cf. 9.4.7). Most important in this connection, the sacrificial bull is identified with the primeval Cosmic Bull. 66 For tvesa- cf. J. Gonda, Epithets in the .?gveda ('s-Gravenhage, I959), pp. 73 and I6o. 67 lab: sdhasrds tvead r'.abhdh. pdyasvan visva riYipini vaks.dnasu bibhrat. 68 On vakcdina, cf.

The outcome of the primordial sacri- fice, though this must be deduced, is the creation of the world. The hymn nowhere indicates the outcome; perhaps that theme was con- sidered tangential to the major ritual applications of the AV text. 74 However, this interpretation seems assured because of the close corre- lation between the AV Cosmic Bull and a mythic Bull in the RV who is instrumental in fostering creation. The RV knows of an Asura Bull who also bears the name visvaripa- (RV 3.38.4). This Bull too is androgynous; RV 3.38.7 calls him a Bull-Cow, and in RV 3.56.3 he is said to have three bellies (tripljasyd-) and three udders. Clearly the AV Cosmic Bull is drawn along lines very similar to the RV Asura Bull. 75 Indeed the AV is familiar with the Rig Vedic Bull; RV 3.38.4 is repeated in AV 4.8.3 (with one minor variant). 76 In the RV, gods also act upon the Asura Bull. These gods, possessing mdaya (i.e. mayin-) bring out (ni /ma lit. 'measure out') from the Asura Bull the multiform phenomenal world. 77 Though the Asura Bull remains passive during the actual emission of phenomenal forms, he symbolizes the primeval raw material out of which the world is shaped. 78 This symbolism should also adhere to the AV Cosmic Bull. Since both samhitds are acquainted with a similar omniform, androgynous primordial Bull, the activities attributed to him in the RV probably continue to be valid in the AV. 72 See also Renou, EVP II, 94. 73 Gonda's translation of vydkalpayan is followed here (Savayajfias pp. Ioo and 320). 74 The entire text is, recited in Kau'. S. 66, 18 in connection with a bullsava. AV 9.4 is also quoted in Kau'. S. 24, 19 in a ceremony (vrr-otsarga) for turning loose among the cows a stud bull. Kaus. S. 19, I includes the hymn among charms to secure prosperity and gain fecundity of cows. Kau'. S. 24, 23 advises the use of this hymn while offering a white bull to Indra if a man wishes to achieve a successful undertaking. 75 For further comparisons see Gonda, Savayajiias, p. 323 ad St. 22. 76 In the typical AV fashion of using mythic themes for practical purposes, this verse, which in the RV extols the greatness of a primordial creator, is used to extol a king in the rijasfiya ceremony in Kaus. 17.Iff. and V~it. 36.7. 77 See Srinivasan, "RV Multiplicity", 147-148.

In the Rig Veda, the Asura Bull re- presents a more ancient image of primeval matter; Purusa, the Cosmic Male of RV io.9o, represents the younger version which retains certain essential features found in the older. 79 It is thus particularly interesting to observe with Renou so that the AV Cosmic Bull, in being 'dismembered' (cf. AV 9.4 12-16) as well as 'assembled' 81 (9.4.8) is reminiscent of Purusa in the Purusas-ikta. III The next set of AV hymns is also concerned with an omniform creator who 'gives birth' to the cosmos. However AV 10.7 and 8 (dedicated to Skambha) and AV 13.1-4 (dedicated to Rohita) go beyond demonstrating continuity with Rig Vedic notions on cosmo- gony and divine multiplicity. These hymns incorporate the multi- plicity image in speculative developments which anticipate Upanisadic thought. Skambha (lit. 'prop, support, pillar') is the fulcrum at the center of the universe. As such, Skambha symbolizes the axis mundi, the pillar which links as well as supports heaven and earth (cf. 10.7.35; 10.8.2). Skambha also maintains the atmosphere and the six direc- tions; indeed the pillar has entered the whole of creation (bhitvana-; 82 cf. 10.7.35). Praised thus in AV 10.7 and 8, 83 Skambha epitomizes a new series of figurative concepts which express more abstractly than do Rig Vedic demiurges the supreme power originating and sustaining the cosmos. 84 AV 10.7.22 summarizes well Skambha's 79 Srinivasan, "RV Multiplicity", 171-172. 80 Renou, E VP II, 94. 81 sdmnbhrta-, cf. Gonda, Savayajiias, pp. 315-316. 82 See Gonda, "Bhuvana-", 49. On AV Io.7-35d, see fn. 112. 83 It should be noted that while AV io.8 agrees in some areas with 10.7 (e.g., number of verses, word usage, homage to Skambha in the first two verses), the main theme of this hymn is the nature of brdhman behind phenomenal diversity (L. Renou, EVP II, 84; Renou, Hymnes speculatifs du Vida [Paris, 1956], p. 263ff.). The AV scholar N. J. Shende (Rel. and Phil. of A V, p. 2Io), in summarizing the meaning of brdhman in the AV, states that on the whole "the word stands for the magical act or the mysterious power which arises out of that act in the priest and which pervades man and the universe" 84 Some other typical AV First Principles are: Kala (Time) 19.53, 54 (in 19.53.1 Kala is 'thousand-eyed', i.e., 'omniscient'); Prina (Vital Breath) I1.4; KUma (Desire) 9.2; Rohita (The Ruddy One) 13.1-4; Brahmacarin (the chaste Vedic student) 11.5; UcchiSta (the remnant of the sacrificial food) 11.7; also PuruSa (19.6) and Virdj (8.9, io). 14</page><page sequence="18">210 Doris Srinivasan comprehensive power; the verse implies that the totality of existence (all divinity, all time, all space) is within the cosmic pillar. ss5 These mystic beliefs prefigure Upanisadic themes, as do Skambha's iden- tification with brdhman83 (1O.7.17; 86 32-34; s6 36) and atmdn (lo.8.44). 87 The speculative thrust of these hymns may well have been their primary intent; with verses often resembling the brahmodya style, 88 hymns 1o.7 and 8 scarcely served any ritual use whatso- ever. 89 For all its abstract tendencies, Skambha still retains traces of anthropomorphism. In being described with two hands, two feet, a voice, ear and eye (Io.7.39), a head (Io.7.I8), mouth (10.7.19, 33) tongue (lo.7.I9) and veins (lo.7.16) etc., Skambha assuredly has the traits of a person viewed as the chief stabilizing force of the cosmos. 90 Skambha is also the generative force; the hymns make quite clear that all of existence has been emitted from the body of Skambha. AV 10.7 begins with a set of riddles, each one asking in which of Skambha's limbs a particular element of the world resides (e.g. vss. I, 3, 13), or from which limb arose a particular aspect of phenomenality (vss. 2, 20). The answer to these questions shows that Skambha, within whose body all elements were set prior to creation, represents the primeval raw material which formed the world. To isolate one such sequence from the hymn: vs. 2 From which limb of his does fire blaze ? From which limb does Mdtari'van (the wind) blow? From which limb does the moon measure out ? Measuring out a limb of the great Skambha? 85 See Gonda, Loka, p. 58. 86 Cf. Renou, EVP II, 83; Paul Deussen, Geschichte der Philosophie I, I (Leipzig, 1920), 312.

S. does not notice either hymn; io.8.42 is used in the Vaitana Sfitra. 90 According to Renou (Hymnes speculatifs, p. 261) the notion of a cosmic pillar (Skambha) dates from the ancient Rig Vedic hymns describing how in the beginning heaven and earth were separated and stabilized by a creator god.</page><page sequence="19">Divine Multiple Body Parts in the Atharva Veda 211 vs. 3 In which limb of his does the earth abide?

Thus in the manner of the ancient Cosmic Bull and Tvastr, Skambha is a cosmic power containing within itself the diversity of phenomenal reality. AV Io.8.2cd says this well: "In Skambha [dwells] this whole universe, possessed of self (atmanvat)--What breathes and blinks the eye." 92 And like those ancient powers, Skambha is also called vilvarlapa-. The epithet occurs in 1o.7.8; the context of that verse indicates that phenomenality resulted when it was emitted (Vs.rj) from Vi'variipa by an agent, Prajapati. 93 The verb Vs.ri is signi- ficant; it emphasizes that creation occurred by the process of emis- sion. 94 In that Skambha is portrayed as a passive creative power, 91 V. Henry (Les Livres X...XII, p. 26) translates pidas ab: "Celui dont l'ceil est le Soleil / et [l'autre ceil] la Lune aux constantes renaissances.. .". On this verse cf. Lindenau, "Skambha-Hymnen", 250. 92 R. C. Zaehner, Hindu Scriptures (London, New York, 1966), p. 23. 93 The idea is not, as Gonda (Savayajilas, p. 332) and Henry (Les Livres X..., p. 23) would have it, that the creation is called 'omniform'. 94 Narendra N. Bhattacharyya (History of Indian Cosmogonical Ideas [New Delhi, 1971], p. 4) observes that in Vedic literature the creative process may be conceived "as a procreative process, and in this connection we frequently</page><page sequence="20">212 Doris Srinivasan activated into cosmic parturition when an agent initiates the process, there appears to be an additional similarity among Skambha, the Cosmic Bull, and Purusa. 95 The similarity is further strengthened by allusions to the sacrificial dismemberment of Skambha throughout AV 10.7. As Renou points out, 96 the entire series of questions which seek to associate different limbs of Skambha with different cosmic phenomena bespeak of the dismemberment of a sacrificial victim. Spe- cifically, compare the following Skambha and Purusa vss: AV 10.7.20 with RV 10.9O.9; AV 10.7-33, 34 with RV 10.90.13. 97 Whereas Skambha has the characteristics of a passive creative force, Prajipati seems to represent the activator. Verse 7 of 10.7, wherein the pillar imagery of Skambha dominates, remarks well on the interaction between active creator and inactive primeval matter; the verse indicates that Prajapati maintained all the worlds after having propped them upon Skambha. Prajapati, who is to become the major demiurge of the entire Brdhmana period, 98 appears already in the late Rig Vedic hymns as a protector and creator of living things. The term prajapati- 'Lord of Creatures,' occurs four times in Book Io as the name of a distinct deity. Indeed RV 10.121 is a celebration of the generative powers of Prajipati, who is thought to come into being as a golden germ (hiranyagarbha 99). The AV continues to elaborate on Prajapati's creative force. AV 7.19.1 says that he generates (Vijan) creatures, and AV 7.80.3 (= RV 10.121.1o with variants) names the god as come across such terms as jan, sri, garbha, retas, etc.". For example, note the root V jan in AV Io.8.7c and 13c; AV 7.19.1; AV 7.80.3. 95 See Srinivasan, "RV Multiplicity", 172, for PuruSa as the omniform raw material from which others generate phenomenal forms. 96 EVP II, 82. 97 For Renou ("Etudes Vediques", p. 46) Skambha is a basic symbol of Purusa; he cites other vss. of comparison. The sacrificial theme is also evidenced in AV 10.7, by the use of ritualistic terms in verse 36a; it is stated that Skambha was born from Srama- (the toil of ritual austerity) and tapas- (devotional heat from ritual activity; cf. C. J. Blair, Heat in the Rig Veda and Atharva Veda (New Haven, I96I), pp. 9; 70; 78. 98 For references to Prajdpati in cosmogonic myths see Keith, Rel. and Philo. I, 207; N. N.

It is thus entirely in keeping with Prajipati's function that he is, in the Skambha hymns, the agent who unfolds primeval matter. Prajapati however did not create himself. Skambha did. And as AV 10.7.28 intimates, it is erroneous to think otherwise: 'Men [think they] know the Golden Germ (hiranyagarbha) as the unutterable su- preme; [But it is] Skambha who in the beginning emitted it, the gold within the world'. 100 That is, Skambha emitted Prajapati, who until the time of 'birth' was nurtured in his womb (cf. AV Io.8.13a). Clearly the imagery of cosmic parturition continues to be closely adhered to. It is equally clear that this symbolism conveys a new speculative position. The position understands the personal creator to be the first produced of primordial matter but not the supreme creative force. This role is reserved for primordial matter. Thus mythically, it is visvarilpa, the source and sustaining force of all diverse life on earth (cf. AV io.8.1I 101). Skambha is second to none. 102 Indeed the progenitor, Prajdpati, is but a fraction of the cosmic mass. AV 10.7.26 says it mythically yet succinctly: 'When Skambha, generating, evolved the Ancient One 103 then men knew by analogy 104 the one limb of Skambha to be the Ancient One'. 105 From the foregoing it is evident that Skambha is both an active and a passive procreative force. Skambha is the first creator who gives birth to the second, who in turn takes over the creation process. This way of conceptualizing the supreme creative force is not found in the RV. It is a schema to develop importantly in the Upanisads, 106 the 100 The translation follows the emphasis Zaehner (Hindu Scriptures, p. 21) has given this verse. 101 io.8.iI: What stirs, flies, and what stands What came into being breathing, not breathing, winking That, Visvarfipa, sustained the earth That, combining becomes just One. 102 Deussen, Geschichte I, I, 312 has already noted that the Skambha hymns postulate a principle superior to Prajipati which supports the whole cosmos. 103 Purana- cf.

New also is the epistemological emphasis. The RV hesitatingly explores the possibility of knowing the Supreme. 110 But aside from the seminal Purusasfikta, Rig Vedic speculative hymns express a desire to know more about how the world was created than the essential nature of who created it. In some of the AV speculative hymns however, there is a preoccupation with this question. AV 10.7 and 8 fall into this category; knowledge of the underlying power of the universe, be it Skambha (10.7) or brdhman (io.8, see fn. 83) is the real theme of these hymns. For example, sixteen verses of 10.7 end in the repeated inquiry into the essential nature of Skambha. 111 An answer to this question, or rather a way to obtain an answer, is suggested within the hymn; it can be discerned from the following pattern of thoughts found throughout the text: It is repeatedly affirmed, as a logical consequent of being visvaripa, that everything, all worlds, are within Skambha (e.g. AV 10.7.22; 29a; IO.8.2c). The corollary, namely that all material forms partake of the same original source, may be found in IO.7-35d: 'Skambha has entered this whole creation'. 112 The precise correspon- 107 Cf. XII. 231-233 wherein creation of the universe is described in two stages. First Brahman creates the physical and psychical elements (intellect, mind) and then the five elements of ether, earth, water, fire, air. As these cannot further the process of creation they continue to form the first organic body- Prajdpati. Prajipati, the personal creator then brings forth all living things. 108 E.g. ViSnu Purana, transl. by H. H. Wilson (London, 1840), Book I, Chap. II. 109 The navel represents the center as the place of generation. Already in the AV, the middle is the place of the procreative source; Skambha as yaksad is situated in the middle of the universe (AV 10.7.38; io.8.15). See J. Gonda, Aspects of Early Visnuism (Utrecht, 1954), Chap. XI on ViSnu's navel. 110 Cf. W. Norman Brown, "Theories", 25. 111 skambhdm, ta'm brahi katamdh svid evd sd'h. 112 skambhd iddmn vilvamn bhivanam a vivesa. On the significance of a Vvis see fn. 38. The above translation tallies with that of Zaehner (Hindu Scriptures, p. 22), A. Ludwig (Der Rigveda III, 402), Lindenau, "Skambha-Hymnen", 239, and V. Henry (Les Livres X..., p. 26). However, following the padap~tha reading skambhe, Whitney (A V II, p. 594), Renou (Hymnes speculatifs, p. 162) and Gonda ("Bhuvana-", 49) render this line as: into Skambha has entered this whole creation. Because of the connotations of a Vvis, I consider the chief sig- nificance of the line to be that Skambha is manifest in all phenomenality because all has emanated from his being. Note other examples where Skambha 'enters' (pra Vvil 10.7.8, 9; cf. 10.8.28) into externality.</page><page sequence="23">Divine Multiple Body Parts in the Atharva Veda 215 dence between outer forms and original source (i.e. which phenomenon corresponds to which 'limb' of Skambha) is however a mystery. Those verses seeking to identify a particular outer form with a specific 'limb' of Skambha really aim to 'reconstruct' Skambha, as it were, in an effort to penetrate that mystery. Simultaneously it is acknowledged that the totality of Skambha cannot be fathomed by a method seeking correspondences. Were every form traced back to a 'limb' of Skambha, his complete structure would still elude comprehension because Skambha is greater than the sum of the forms he gave rise to. 'What [is] the highest, the lowest, and what [is] the middle 113 that Prajdpati emitted from Viivarfipa ? By how much did Skambha enter therein? What he did not enter, how much was that?' So asks 10.7.8. The same idea is expressed in io.8.13 which says that with half [of Skambha?] Prajipati generated all creation. But, the verse concludes, what of his other half, what is the sign of that? 114 In this way it is implied that empiric know- ledge can never attain complete knowledge of the original source. Instead, it is implied in 10.7.17, a graduated series of intuitive analogies build up to the knowledge of Skambha: 'They who know brdhman in man know Paramesthin (the highest one); who knows Paramesthin and who knows Prajapati, they who know the chief br{hman-power, they know Skambha on that account (anusamviduh; cf. 10.7.26). Although the import of the verse is obscure 115, it is nevertheless apparent that a non-empirical mode of inquiry into the nature of the supreme is being attempted. IV The Rohita hymns show the multiplicity concept as implicit in Vedic notions on cosmogony, cosmography and the origin of living things. The creative force originating the cosmos and all life is Rohita, symbolic of 'the red' (ascending) sun. 116 The term rohita already 113 The three positions most likely refer to the sky, earth and atmosphere respectively. 114 The same question is asked in io.8. 7cd; cf. AV II.4.22cd. 115 The critical word, anusdmviduh., does not occur in any other Samhitds, Brahmanas or UpaniSads according to the Vedic Word-Concordance ed. Visva- Bandhu ?dstri, publ. by V. V. R. Inst. (Hosiapur, 1935- ). Cf. Deussen, Ge- schichte, 312. 116 The epithet rohita-, signifying 'the ruddy one' can also play punningly with derivatives and forms of the root Vruh 'to ascend, to mount'.</page><page sequence="24">216 Doris Srinivasan appears in the RV; it is used exclusively there as an attribute desig- nating the color of horses; nowhere is it applied directly to the sun. Thus Rohita appears to be an independent invention of the poets of the AV to advance their inquiries into the nature of supreme power. 117 Of the four Rohita hymns in AV? Book 13, l18 this theme is best developed in the initial hymn. The opening verse of 13.1 declares Rohita to be the supreme creator of the universe in that 'he gave birth (V jan 119) to all this.' 120 The allusion to cosmic parturition is sustained in pdda 6a which says that Rohita gave birth (Vjan) to heaven and earth. AV 13.2.26d also specifies that Rohita generates (V/jan) these two spheres. 121 In this way Rohita continues to create and stabilize the universe. 'Rohita stabilized heaven and earth, 122 by 117 In the context of the present discussion, it i's not relevant to dwell on another function of Rohita in these hymns, namely as patron of royal power. M. Bloomfield has pointed out the resemblance between images of royal power (especially the rajasiya) and solar images occurring in AV 13.1 ("Contri- butions to the Interpretation of the Veda", AJP 12 [18gi9] 429-443). F. Edgerton, "Atharva-Veda 13.1.1o", Indological Studies in Honor of W. Nornman Brown, in AOS 47 (New Haven, 1962), p. 56, takes hymn 13.1 to be, among other things, a charm for a king. Cf. also Renou (Hymnes speculatifs, p. 270) on examples of how this double theme runs through 13.1. Actually Renou believes that 13.1 portrays the main deity as Sun-King-brdhman (EVP II, 89). 118 Note that AVP has only two Rohita hymns in Book XVIII, and isolated verses in AVP Books 4 and 20; see Whitney AV II ad 13.1-3. 119 Cf. fn. 94. 120 AVP 18.15.1 reads visvabhrtarm for visvam idam. 121 AV 13.2.26 is, with considerable variations, RV 10.81.3, a verse rich in multiplicity references (see Srinivasan,, "RV Multiplicity", 169ff.). In both the AV and RV verses, the multiplicity references define divinities as creator gods filled with the forms to be emitted into externality. 122 Rohita stabilized heaven and earth with Aja Ekapad (cf. 13.1.6). The name of this minor deity has been interpreted in a variety of ways. Bohtlingk and Roth, following Yd.ska, take aja from V aj 'to drive' and understand the name as 'the one-footed (i.e., ekapad) driver'. The name is rendered by Bloomfield and Whitney (in their AV translations) as well as Keith (Rel. and Philo. I, 62) and Hermann Oldenberg, (Die Religion des Veda [Stuttgart und Berlin, 19231, p. 70) as 'one-footed goat' (aia). Renou (Hymnes speculatifs, p. 204), Ludwig (Der Rig-Veda III, 537), K. Geldner in his RV translation, and A. Bergaigne La Religion Vidique III [Paris, 1883], 20-25) take aja from Van 'to be born' with the privative 'a' and understand the name as 'the one-footed unborn One.' In the AV context, I consider this the, best interpretation. Aja Ekapad functions in AV 13.1.6 as a cosmic pillar holding the worlds apart. P. E. Dumont "The Indic God Aja Ekapid, the one-legged goat", JAOS 53 [I9331, 326-334, also considers the one foot as a sort of pillar supporting the sun; he believes Aja Ekapdd represents the sun. R. N. Dandekar, "Universe in Vedic Thought", India</page><page sequence="25">Divine Multiple Body Parts in the Atharva Veda 217 him the celestial realm of light (svar 123) was firmly fixed, by him the vault of heaven (ndka-) (was firmly fixed). By him the atmosphere (antdriksa-) (and) the spaces (rdjas-) were measured out; 124 through him the gods found immortality' 125 (AVg 13.1.7). The considerable significance of this verse lies in its clear description of the various cosmic spheres generated and maintained by Rohita; together they com- prise the Vedic phenomenal and transcendental regions. The Vedic phenomenal world was considered tripartite; the divi- sions, well indicated in AV8 12.3.20, are earth (pyrthivi), atmosphere (antariksa) and the sky (div). 126 The shape of this world inhabited by men and gods is hemispherical or as AV8 10.8.9 says, it is like a bowl with a horizontal opening and its bottom upward turned. 127 The sky, clearly a heavenly arc, has its delimitations; it is bonded on Maior (J. Gonda Festschrift), Leiden, 1972), page 98, shares this view on the symbolism of the one foot; Bergaigne likewise considers Aja Ekapad as the supporter of the world. Although Aja Ekapdd is a very minor figure, the function he embodies is vital in the schema of Vedic cosmography. As noted below, the Vedic organized world is considered hemispherical. A concern that the sky remain arched above the earth is demonstrated from the earliest Rig Vedic creation myth onward: one of the first acts performed by the demiurge Indra is to separate heaven and earth, and support the sky to keep it from falling (cf. RV 5.29.4; 2.17.5). Other divinities besides Aja Ekapad symbolize this cosmic support. In the RV it is significant that Visnu holds apart heaven and earth and fastens the earth all about with pegs (RV 7.99.3). (In the Mahibharata, Aja is a name of Vi.nu [MhBh III, 3, 6; XIII, 149, 95 vulg.]). In the AV, Skambha is the supreme principle conceived as Cosmic Pillar. Interestingly, some images Skambha is compared to, such as the yakd (in AV 10.7.38) and the tree (also 10.7.38; on the tree of life as a central world pillar, cf. F. B. J. Kuiper, "Cosmogony and Conception: A Query", History of Religions Io [1970], I24ff.) are also conceived as central axes. 123 Cf. AV I13.2.39d: Rohita produced the svar; AVP 18.24.7 reads rohito jyotir ucyate. 124 viVmnd i.e., 'were produced or established'; cf. Gonda, "Maya", pp. 170, 178. 125 Presumably the gods found immortality in the svar, the navel of immortality (see AVS 4.11.6). 126 The visible tripartite worlds are called lokas (e.g., AV\ 12.3.20) and these are very often mentioned; see Gonda, Loka, 55, 62, 91-92. 127 Below this region exists a chaotic, unorganized realm similar in concept to the Western notion of Hell. See W. Norman Brown, "The Rigvedic Equivalent for Hell", JAOS 61 (I941), 76-80o; Kirfel, Kosmographie, pp. 51-52. Perhaps another visualization of the world's shape is given in RV 2.27.15, where heaven and earth each form the two halves of the sphere.</page><page sequence="26">2I8 Doris Srinivasan top by a vault, the nika, 128 marking the boundary of the visible world. 129 Over the naka is found the svar, another heavenly realm distinct and different from the visible sky. This cosmological progres- sion is best described in AV 4.14.13: 'From the back of the earth (prthivyd) I have ascended to the atmosphere (antdriksam); from the atmosphere I have ascended to the sky (divam); from the back of the vault of the sky (divd ndkasya prs.thdt) I have gone to heaven (svar), to light (jy6tih).' The heavenly regions above and below the naka are different with respect to light. The svar as AV 4.14.3 indicates, is a region of light; indeed this place seems to be the source of the light of the sun (cf. AV? 16.9.3). The radiance of the region above the naka is contrasted with the 'darkness' below (cf. AVS 9.5.I; 130 see also AV 7.53-7). The space above the earth is usually denoted by rajas. This space was considered darker than the one which was attached to heaven. 131 Further, the region above the naka is hieratically superior to the region below. The svar is considered the center of immortality (cf. AV? 4.11.6) and the invisible realm where- from originates divine manifestations. 132 This region filled with great celestial light is 'the highest heaven' (parama- vyoman-; cf. RV 4.50.4. and Srinivasan, "RV Multiplicity," 175-176) and is therefore often designated by expressions which insist upon its physical and religious superiority. 133 In that all these cosmic regions are mentioned in AV? 128 There is a tendency to multiply the number of vaults, just as there is a tendency to multiply each of the other lokas. For trindka- in the A-V, see 9.5.10 (and cf. Gonda's remarks in The Savayajfias, p. 251); 19.27.4. Cf. RV 9.113.9, where trinaka- is a synonym for tridiva-. W. Kirfel (Kosmographie, p. 4) conjectures that three earths, / atmospheres and heavens may have developed as other heavens in addition to the visible heaven came to be postulated. Thereupon three earths, etc. were postulated to parallel the development of three heavens. For discussions on the multiple system of lokas see Kirfel; R. N. Dandekar, "Universe in Vedic Thought"; D. C. Sircar, Cosmography and Geography in Early Indian Literature (Calcutta, I967). 129 Keith, Rel. and Philo. I, 77. 130 On tamsdiisi see Gonda, The Savayajiias, p. 242. 131 Dandekar, "Universe", p. IoI, but also see his fn. 8, p. IoI. 132 Srinivasan, "RV Multiplicity", 174-177. 133 E.g., AV 17.6; 18.3.58; 19.53-3. For RV examples, see Srinivasan, "RV Multiplicity", 175. The reader will observe a great amount of condensation in the above cosmographic account. The subject proper of Vedic cosmography is complex and falls outside the present discussion. Needed are more than the few excellent studies devoted to this subject (e.g., Kirfel's Kosmographie der Inder; Gonda's</page><page sequence="27">Divine Multiple Body Parts in the Atharva Veda 219 13.1.7, the intent of that verse is to portray Rohita as both the creator and preserver of the entire organized Vedic universe. Having created the structure of the organized universe, Rohita con- tinues, by cosmic parturition, to project all phenomenal forms into the visible world. 'Rohita has stood high above the naka generating all forms (visva rapdni), the young sage' (AVg 13.1.11). The implication is of course that Rohita is omniform and that he initiates the emission process from the svar; the region (called paramd- vybman- in AV? 13.1.44) is said to be Rohita's abode. 134 The capacity of the creator to generate forms is inexhaustible as his structure comprises 'a hundred bodies' (tana- AV I13.4-44), indeed an innumerable number of bodies (cf. AV ~13.4-45). The idea is that the essence of the creator is composed of a limitless potentiality to give rise to phenomenal forms. Thus Rohita may be said to have an un- limited number of 'births' (cf. AV? 13.1.37 where the specification 'loo7' connotes 'a limitless number'). There is some indication that the power Rohita uses to create forms is mayd. AV? 13.2.3 states that by means of maya Rohita makes day and night of diverse forms (i.e. of diverse colors 135). The relationship between cosmography and the origin of phenomenal forms traced in the Rohita hymns is already evident in the RV. Rig Vedic notions on cosmography and divine manifestation correspond with the ideas expressed in the Rohita verses. In the RV, it is in the hymns to Soma that these ideas are expressed most clearly. Soma verses indicate that the omniform creator exists in the region above the naka, and that it is from this region that the divinity projects into the world below the naka those phenomenal forms which are the locations of its numinous power(s). 136 It is noteworthy that both the Soma and Rohita references make similar basic assumptions relating to the mul- tiplicity concept. These are: Loka; Dandekar's "Universe"; H. Liiders' Varuna I [G6ttingen, 1951], esp. Chaps. II-IV. A thorough understanding of the relationship between the phenomenal world and the transcendental sphere will, I believe, elucidate a series of sophisti- cated notions showing the Vedic gods to be the visible manifestations of in- visible natural forces and not the personification of such forces. 134 It is also the exclusive realm of Skambha-brdhman in AVS Io.8.I. 135 In AVS 19.49.4 Ratri, goddess of Night, makes herself many forms (i.e., many successions of nights) when she appears. 136 See Srinivasan, "RV Multiplicity", 153-156; 174ff.</page><page sequence="28">220 Doris Srinivasan I. that it is in the region above the naka that the omniform (vinvariipa-) creator exists, 2. that phenomenal forms originate from this sphere, 3. that these forms enter the regions below the naka when emitted by the omniform creator. It must be assumed that we have here a fundamental Vedic theory explaining the nature of creation and creator, the origin of material forms, and the existence of divine manifestations within the visible tripartite world of Vedic man. The Rohita material, in addition to completely endorsing Rig Vedic cosmogonic and cosmographic notions, also exhibits speculative posi- tions which anticipate Upanisadic thought. One significant development is that Rohita is said to have made all that has soul (atman; AVS 13.1.52). Another is that Rohita is identified as being brdhman (AVS 13.1.33). 137 The idea that Rohita is a unifying principle is yet an- other; this is suggested in the last hymn of the Rohita series. The theme of the entire AV? 13.4 is an identification of Rohita (though not specifically named) with the outer world, in particular with divine powers and natural and cosmic phenomena. V Approximately seventeen of the AV multiplicity references describe the multiple body parts of some non-anthropomorphic entity. While such occurrences are not absent in the RV (for example RV Io.I61.3 [= AV 3.11-3 with some variations] speaks of 'the thousand-eyed oblation') in the AV these references are more frequent and more developed. Multiplicity is ascribed to fearsome and inauspicious things such as witchcraft, curses, worms, demons; it is ascribed to things having beneficial magical properties such as amulets and plants, or it may be ascribed to ritual objects such as the sacrificial goat, the Brahman's cow, the ricemess offering. Apparently, the multiplicity feature does not of itself have good or evil connotations. The above mentioned 137 Possibly brdhman in AVS 13.2.13 also refers to Rohita. The multiplicity re- ference tripdd brdhma pururdpam (AV 9.o0.19) probably denotes the three- footed g5yatri verse which is many-formed (i.e., consisting of different stanzas in g5yatri meter); see Edgerton, ("Atharva-Veda 13.1.10", p. 57) who takes the phrase as a reference to the gdyatri-savitrI.</page><page sequence="29">Divine Multiple Body Parts in the Atharva Veda 221 oblation is thousand-eyed, but so is the curse (AV 6.37.1); demons may be viewed as two-mouthed creatures (AVg 8.6.22) but so too is the Brahman's cow (AVg 5.19.7 138). It is the special distinction of the Brdhman in AV? 4.6.1 to be born first with ten heads and ten mouths; whatever else may be the significance of this image, 139 the student of Indian mythology is well aware that the demon Rdvana in the Ramayana is both a Brdhman and has ten heads. All these passages support the observation that possession of multiple body parts is free from moral distinctions. Why it may be asked should body parts be ascribed to non-corporeal or non-anthropomorphic things? What function does the convention serve in these applications? In the main, the multiplicity convention attributes to the non-anthropomorphic entity a meaning related to that which this convention has when modifying a deity. Thus, for example, it is well recognized that attributing 'a thousand eyes' to a deity is a way of predicating 'omniscience'. 140 Similarly the power of complete knowledge appears to adhere to those cases where 'a thousand eyes' are ascribed to non-anthropomorphic entities. The jafigida amulet which is thousand-eyed is believed to have the ability to vanquish by its watchfulness (pratibodhd- AV? I9-35-3). The varana amulet, surely on account of its all-seeing/all-knowing properties 141 has the uncanny power to be both a universal cure and ruinous to enemies (AVg 10.3-3). The thousand-eyed oblation, also having hundredfold (i.e. unlimited) strength and promoting a hundredfold life, has the power to restore life and remove obstacles (cf. AV 3.11.3). The thousand-eyed curse of AV 6.37.1 can seek after the sacrificer's curser; having complete 138 AV 5.19.7 details the calamity that befalls the killer of a Brahman's cow. A cow thus killed becomes eight-footed, four-eyed, four-eared, four-jawed, two- mouthed, two-tongued and shakes down the kingdom of the oppressor of the Brahman. The bodily parts mainly are doubles of the normal number; perhaps the multiplex image represents the victimized Brahman's cow transfigured into a formidable power capable of causing the destruction olf the offender. In AVS 11.1.19, the thousand-backed rice-mess may also represent the transfigured uni- versal form of the offering existing 'in the world of meritorious work'. Saiyana glosses sahasraprsthah as sahasravayavah (in I I.I.19) and sahasras'arirah (in v. 20). Possibly vilvaripa- in AVS 4.14.9 signifies the transfigured sacrificed goat. 139 Cf. Bloomfield, A V, 374. 140 See under Varuna, Soma, Agni, Sfirya in Srinivasan, "RV Multiplicity", and in the AV, see under Varun.a and Rudcra. 141 See fn. 25.</page><page sequence="30">222 Doris Srinivasan perspicuity, the curse can be expected to fall upon the enemy of the sacrificer and not on another (cf. AVS 6.37.2). It is the same with the thousand-eyed immortal evil which the sacrificer instructs to strike only whom he hates (AVg 6.26.3); with its total knowledge, evil in- fallibly knows whom to harm and whom to spare. 142 One must ima- gine that the practice of magic and sorcery would be unthinkable were not some discriminatory quality attributed to the instrument of magic. This may account for the rather frequent use of the epithet 'thousand- eyed' with non-corporeal things. Further, both non-corporeal and non-anthropomorphic entities are several times described as being 'omniform' (vivariipa-). When applied to demiurges and first principles, vilvaraipa- bespeaks of their pre- eminent creative capacity. When applied to non-anthropomorphic en- tities, their life-giving and life-sustaining powers are emphasized. AV? 6.59.3 illustrates well this use of vis'varapa-. In this verse the arundhati plant is both vi'vdrappam and fivaldm, that is, 'omniform' and 'full of life' in the sense of 'life-giving.' So, too, in AV I10.I.I, 2, 24 viSvarapa- applies to the product of the sorcerer and means 'vivifying.' 143 In a similar vein, a heavenly milk cow may be called both zvi*var7apd- and kdmadligha ('yielding wishes') in that she has the animating power which quickens desires to fruition (AV8 9.5.10). 144 The disease causing worm of AV8 2.32.2 is all-formed (vilvarapa-), four-eyed, 145 variegated and whitish; vilsvariipa- probably connotes 'existing in all varieties.' 146 Kuhn's 147 discussion, on this and the related verse AV8 5.23.9 148 lays special emphasis on Vedic and Germanic charms 142 Bloomfield, A V 474. 143 Gonda, The SavayajRas, p. 323. 144 On this vs. cf. Gonda. The Savayajiias, pp. 92; 251. 145 'Four-eyed' could signify 'all-seeing' (e.g., RV 1.31.13 discussed in Srini- vasan, "RV Multiplicity", 162) or, 'with spots over the eyes,' (see Bloomfield, AV ad stanza 2, p. 318). 146 So also Siyaina who glosses the term as ndnakaram. 147 A. Kuhn, "Indische und germanische Segensspriiche", Zeitschrift fiir Vergleichende Sprachforschung XIII (1864), 135ff. 148 AVS 5.23.9 bcd = AVS 2.32.2bcd. Pada ga describes the worm as having three heads (triAiradn-) and being triple-humped (trikakuid-). Trif~rw'dn- is not repeated in the AV; trikakuid- recurs only in AVS 4.9.8 where it describes a mountain. In the RV, tri.irm.dn- is the exclusive epithet of the demon Vi'varfipa, son of Tvastr. Perhaps in 5.23.9a the epithet alludes to the menacing aspect of the worm. Another instance where multiple bodily parts may represent the ominous nature of something occurs in AVS 8.6.22: the demon capable of harming the pregnant woman is described as! two-mouthed, four-eyed, five-footed and fingerless.</page><page sequence="31">Divine Multiple Body Parts in the Atharva Veda 223 which distinguish different types of harmful worms. In a related sense, the plants are said in AV? 8.7.8 to bear 'a thousand names,' that is, they exist in 'a thousand (i.e. limitless) varieties'. 149 VI We may conclude by drawing attention to several important contri- butions the AV makes towards the understanding of the religious sig- nificance of multiple body parts. The AV demonstrates that when multiple body parts and forms are ascribed to the divine, that deity, in nearly every case, is associated with creation on a cosmic scale. The AV thus strongly endorses the basic symbolic value which the RV attributes to the multiplicity con- vention. Important, however, for our broader study is to note the areas wherein the two samhitds work differently with the basic concept; these differences allow for greater insight into the concept. Whereas the Rig Vedic verses mentioning multiplicity demonstrate a remarkable internal consistency permitting of three discreet, secondary definitions (Srinivasan, "RV Multiplicity," 140) the Atharva Veda references employ the basic concept in conjunction with pre-Upanisadic specu- lative notions. Combining evidence mainly from the Skambha and Rohita material, it is seen that an omniform (vilvaraipa-) creator, who gene- rates (Vjan) creation (i.e. who emits [Vsrjl the universe by an act of cosmic parturition) is identified with brcihman. He is also brought into association with dtman in being either identical to atman (Skambha), or in creating all that has atman (Rohita). Further, the omniform creator is a unifying force, the source of all phenomenality, and the object of the search for knowledge into the underlying power of the universe. Thus the Atharva Veda, in linking the basic Rig Vedic multiplicity concept with more advanced speculative notions, opens the possibility that much of the original significance of multiple bodily parts and forms continues intact in the oldest Upanisadic material. If, upon analysis of the pertinent Upanisads, this proves to be so, it would go a long way towards understanding the religious significance of early Indian devotional icons. 150 149 J. Gonda, Notes on Names and the Name of God in Ancient India (Am- sterdam, London, 1970), p. 14. According to Gonda "a name is a form or a mode of existence". 150 The UpaniSads begin, of course, to approach closer in time the plastic</page><page sequence="32">224 Doris Srinivasan Since devotional icons of (Rudra-) Siva are, from the outset, re- presented with multiple body parts, it is worthwhile to summarize sig- nificant developments of Rudra in the AV, especially with regard to the multiplicity convention. Rudra is still a minor god in the AV, being mentioned only 55 times in the hymns. However, his growing stature is discernible. One factor in the rise of Rudra is his intensified ambivalence, as both heightened destructive and benign traits are as- cribed to him. 151 Another factor is his fusion with Agni whereby, the quality of omniscience may have shifted over to Rudra. In the AV, Rudra indeed exemplifies omniscience, being more frequently called 'thousand-eyed' than the other gods with whom he shares this quality (Bhava and 'arva; Kala; Varuna). It should be emphasized that the power of omniscience in the RV implies additional exaltedness. The Rig Vedic verses describing omniscient Varuna indicate that the all-knowing god is posited in an invisible sphere above the naka wherefrom he 'sees' both phenomenal things below as well as trans- cendental things. 152 It may be assumed that this conceptualization also adheres to omniscient Rudra in the AV, and that his station too is in the highest heaven. Certainly the image fits Rudra's role as creator god in the RV, and the increasing majesty of his personage in the AV. appearance of the convention. The older Upanisads date c. 6th-3rd C. B.C. and the seminal gvetd.vatara Upanisad was probably compiled sometime between the 5th and 4th C. B.C., coming after the Brhadaranyaka and Chandogya Upanisads and preceding the Bhagavad Gitid. 151 Bhandarkar, Vai.navism, Saivism, pp. 104-105. 152 Cf.
