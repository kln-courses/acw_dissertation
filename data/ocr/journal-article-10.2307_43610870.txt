Geographically diverse articles provide a range of theoretical or ethical perspectives, from the traditional to the mischievous or subversive, and aim to offer new insights into the worlds in which we live. The journal will publish challenging ethnography and push hard at the boundaries of the discipline in addition to examining or incorporating fields - from economics to neuroscience - with which anthropology has long been in dialogue. The original remit of the journal, as an in-house publication based at Cambridge University, was to provide a space in which innovative material and ideas could be tested; the new Cambridge Anthropology builds on that tradition to produce new analytical tool-kits for anthropology or to take all such intellectual exploration to task. Published twice a year, the journal features articles and book reviews in addition to an occasional 'Reflections and Commentary' section. Proposals for special issues and review articles are also welcomed. 2012 © Cambridge Anthropology ISSN 0305-7674 (Print) • ISSN 2047-7716 (Online) All rights reserved.
