<plain_text><page sequence="1">Sympathy in Mind (1876-1900) Susan Lanzoni In the April 1884 issue of Mind, William James published his influential account of emotion, which stressed the bodily and physiological constitu- tion of various feeling-states.1 The article reflected new trends in physiologi- cal psychology, but came under attack by numerous respondents in the journal who argued that there was more to the emotions than physiology.2 As the evolutionary psychologist Hiram Stanley intoned, "emotions in the higher stages are filled out by knowledge and will."3 Many noted that the higher emotions - aesthetic sentiments, sympathy, pity, envy, love - were not marked by clear physiological changes. Charles Darwin had observed that love was not discernable by prominent facial expressions.4 There was also little agreement as to how to divide sentiments from appetites, af- fections, and passions.

Sympathy was most often understood to be a kind of tenderheartedness linked to, but distinct from love. At the same time, sympathy was tethered to a variety of moral and epistemological ends - as a cornerstone in evolutionary ethics, an ele- ment in aesthetic appreciation, and even as a source for knowledge of other minds. Sympathy had had a prominent place in eighteenth-century theories of aesthetics, moral sentiments and taste, in the writings of Adam Smith and Edmund Burke. In the late Victorian period, theories of sympathy drew on this lineage and increasingly became tinged with evolutionary and devel- opmental features. Although sympathy in the Victorian period has gained the attention of literary scholars, historians of the mind sciences have not paid it much due, even though its psychological origins and moral correlates were of sus- tained interest in this period.6 Stefan Collini has argued that British intellec- tual culture was intrigued by the interplay of egoistic and altruistic tendencies, and the birth of a number of ethical societies in the final two decades of the century attests to the increased emphasis on the moral di- mensions of sympathy.7 Anti-vivisection movements and societies for the prevention of cruelty to animals and children, often with appeals to sympa- thy, gained adherents in this period in Britain and America.8 In one study, 5 Alexander F.

Darwin believed that sympathy had been ex- tended to those of the same nation, and prescriptively wrote that it should extend to all nations and races, as well as the imbecile and the maimed. Darwin was echoing here the broader enlightenment sentimentalist tradi- tion that linked the feeling of sympathy to a conception of humanity.10 In the pages of the British professional psychological and philosophical journal Mind, sympathy was under scrutiny by scholars in evolutionary and developmental psychology, ethics, and aesthetics. This journal, first pub- lished in 1876, and funded by Alexander Bain, examined new trends in physiological and scientific psychology and sought a broad philosophical framework for the understanding of mental life.11 It played a mediating role in the overlapping discussions of science and philosophy and published on a diverse array of topics. Although Mind saw itself as a specialized journal for psychology and philosophy, it was founded at an historical moment when discussions of the mind were not narrowly portioned out to the psy- chological sciences, as would increasingly be the case after 1900. Indeed, the experimental psychological laboratory emerged as a new scientific insti- tation in America before the Second World War (Baltimore, Md.: Johns Hopkins Univer- sity Press, 1995), 27-50. 9F.

Specialization in the late Victorian age on topics relating to the mind was downright eclectic: during the editorships of George Croom Robertson (1876-1892) and of G.F. Stout (1892-1920), Mind published on physiological, evolutionary and associationist psychologies, logic, aesthetics, ethics, idealism, and natu- ralism. It was also open to trends in Continental philosophy, evidenced by a large number of reviews of German and French works.12 This essay examines contributions to Mind in the years prior to 1900 that considered sympathy variously as a form of psychological imitation, an instinct, an aesthetic or epistemological capacity, or a cornerstone for ethics. Sympathy was an entity that impacted many aspects of mental life, and thus lent itself to the diversity of approaches published in Mind. Al- though sympathy was acknowledged to possess physiological underpin- nings, it was not often described as movements of the nerves or the coordination of different bodily systems, as had been popular in the seven- teenth century and earlier.13 Rather, organic forms of sympathy were under- stood as a basic form of emotional imitation that could be empirically tracked in early infant life.14 For evolutionary ethicists Herbert Spencer and Leslie Stephen, sympathy was deemed an instinct that could be translated into altruistic behaviors. Henry Sidgwick and other critics, however, were less sanguine about this direct route from the sympathetic instinct to the performance of ethical actions. Sympathy also played an important role in aesthetics, highlighting the shared emotional response to an art object in distinction to an individual, sensual pleasure. James Sully deemed this shared response the sine qua non for aesthetics. Editors of the journal Mind were cognizant of developments in Continental circles, and published reviews of works in German psycho- logical aesthetics, particularly those of the Munich philosopher and psy- chologist Theodor Lipps.15 Prior to 1900, psychologists tended to translate 12 J.

Titchener shifted the discourse of sympathy to that of empathy in psychological aesthetics in the early twentieth century.17 In the latter decades of the nineteenth century, however, sympathy reigned supreme in the Anglo-American intellectual world as a vital social emotion, one that had organic or physiological ele- ments, but that also extended into the realms of ethics and aesthetics. The journal Mind and its eclectic contributions thus provide an excellent lens for viewing the centrality of the social emotion of sympathy to moral, aes- thetic, and psychological discourse of the era. SYMPATHY AND EVOLUTIONARY ETHICS The very first issue of Mind appearing in January 1876 featured a debate between Herbert Spencer and the Cambridge moral philosopher Henry Sid- gwick on the usefulness of evolutionary models for ethics. Spencer argued that evolutionary principles could form a buttress to ethics rather than a threat, contributing to a "literature of reassurance" in the words of histo- rian Roger Smith, which sought to rescue a moral compass from evolution- ary science.18 In this first issue, Spencer outlined a program for the study of comparative psychology: an inquiry into the mental evolution of different human types, with attention to gender and race.19 Differences in mental mass, complexity and development across different "races" were to be cata- logued. He contrasted the emotions of impulsivity and sympathy, and saw ische Einfuhlung" published in Zeitschrift fiir Psychologie und Physiologie der Sinnesor- gane appears in Mind New Series 9, no. 36 (1900): 562-63, and referred to sympathetische Einfuhlung as cosentient sympathy. 16 Even Lipps used the terms sympathy and Einfuhlung interchangeably.

Impulsivity resulted from the simple, reflex-oriented na- ture of the fleeting emotions, whereas sympathy, unlike a simple passion, entailed what Spencer called "imaginations of consequences."20 Sympathy thus marked a higher evolutionary stage of sociality, and was present to a greater degree in the civilized as compared to the "lower races." For Spencer, sympathy developed through the interplay between the individual and social state and was the source of the most elevated altruistic emotions - pity, generosity, and justice - the latest developments in mental evolution.21 The evolutionary selection of altruistic traits took place through a combination of natural selection of the family, group selection and inherited habit. The end of evolution was a society measured by the utilitarian notion of achieving the greatest happiness for all.22 This view of ethics with an eye towards the social organism was echoed by James Seth and Leslie Stephen, who deemed sympathetic feelings a sign of intelligence in the higher animals, and the glue for the social organism. As Stephen put it in his 1882 Science of Ethics, the "sympathetic being becomes in virtue of his sympathies, a constituent part of a larger organization. He is no more intelligible by himself alone than the limb is in all its properties intelligible without reference to the body."23 Darwin, along with comparative psychologists George Romanes and Lloyd Morgan, viewed sympathy as an important social instinct, finding ample evidence for it in the animal kingdom.24 Although Darwin ques- tioned the extent to which one could understand the mental life of animals ("Who can say what cows feel, when they surround and stare intently on a dying or dead companion?"), he provided anecdotes of social animals showing love, performing good deeds for each other, and sympathizing with each other's distress.25 He cited cases of birds feeding a blind pelican, dogs licking a sick cat, a dog attacking someone who attacked his master; and a monkey trying to scare off a baboon that was attacking his keeper. Social instincts led an animal to feel sympathy for others in his group, 20 Ibid., 12-13. 21 Ibid., 19. 22 Robert J.

When coupled with language, and the ability to remember and image past actions, the social instincts could form the basis of a moral guide to action, according to the dictates of the community. Most intellectuals of this period confidently claimed that sympathies had become more refined in their day and age, and would continue to un- dergo development through the workings of mental evolution and civiliza- tion. Darwin optimistically noted that social instincts had not become weaker over time, and through habits, which had become fixed through inheritance, along with the process of natural selection mostly for groups, one could look towards a hopeful future where "virtue will be trium- phant."26 Although a sympathetic individual who sacrificed his life for oth- ers would be unable to sire progeny, Darwin speculated that a tribe composed of more sympathetic members than another tribe would thrive through the process of natural selection.27 Both Darwin and Spencer em- ployed the use-inheritance argument - that social adaptations made across a life-span could be transmitted to future generations - which was com- monly invoked to explain the evolution of mental and emotional capaci- ties.28 Leslie Stephen argued that as a society became more civilized, its ability to reason developed, leading to a better understanding of human relations, and consequently an increase in sympathy. Thinking about others thus stimulated sympathy.29 Bain commented that clemency to conquered races and to lower animals were signs of the presence of sympathy in contempo- rary culture.30 The idealist Bradley remarked that current interest in the lower animals marked an increase in sympathy as compared to the preced- ing generation. He attributed this widening of sympathy not to intellectual development, but to a shift of attention and practical interest. Spencer con- fidently claimed that as social evolution advanced, sympathy would in- crease due to the greater capacity to express feeling, and an increased susceptibility to expression by observers.31 Those with a higher moral na- 26 Ibid., 104. 27 Darwin, Descent of Man, 163, 82. 28 Henrika Kuklick, The Savage Within: The Social History of British Anthropology, 1885-1945 (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1992), 81; George W.

Henry Sidgwick, however, did not see mental and social evolution as proceeding so smoothly. He questioned Spencer's presumption that there was harmony between the interests of the individual and the group, as well as between the greatest happiness principle of the utilitarians and the pres- ervation of life. In the first issue of Mind, Sidgwick took Spencer to task for claiming that evolution meant the increase in happiness according to utilitarian principles, or pleasure over pain in sentient existence. He also doubted if evolution necessarily provided a greater fit of the organism to its environment. For instance, a more sensitive being with greater responsive- ness to the environment might not be the most vital sort.32 The evolutionist also supposed that the sympathetic emotions would guarantee the greatest happiness. Yet even those possessed of a "roseate optimism" could not deny conflicts between what was pleasant and what preserved life, and what served individual well-being versus the greater good.33 Indeed, the choice seemed to be between an ethics based on the 'natural' moral sentiments, and one based on a rational calculus of the greatest happiness principle. What was one to do when there was conflict? Sidgwick did not disagree that the laws of sympathy were vital to un- derstanding humans as social beings, but he saw such laws as limited for the rational assessment of moral action.34 Indeed, moral sentiments were based in the sympathetic recognition of the emotions of others; one could derive pleasure and pain from the mere representation of the other's pleasure and pain. For Sidgwick, this was a plausible account of the origins of morality "in a race of animals, gregarious, sympathetic, and semi-rational . . ."35 He allowed that altruistic desire was based in sympathy and was "natural" to humans, but there remained conflict between self-interest and the welfare of society, as he pointed out again in his 1882 review of Leslie Stephen's Science of Ethics in Mind.36 For Stephen, society was not a mere aggregate of individuals, but an organism, and it was this "social tissue" that was undergoing evolution. Sidgwick's objection was that the metaphors of so- cial welfare and well-being obscured the basic evolutionary reality that 32 Sidgwick, "The Theory of Evolution in its Application to Practice," Mind 1, no. 1 (1876): 57-67, 54. 33 Ibid., 65. 34 Sidgwick, "The Historical Method," Mind 11, no. 42 (1886): 203-19, 212 35 Sidgwick "The Theory of Evolution in its Application to Practice," 66. 36 Sidgwick, Review of "The Science of Ethics" by Leslie Stephen, Mind 7, no. 28 (1882): 572-86, 579. 272</page><page sequence="9">Lanzoni ♦ The Journal Mind in its Early Years, 1876-1920 it was only the fittest individual who survived. Sidgwick concluded that Stephen did not seriously take into account conflict between the individual and society: "we cannot therefore argue that the precise development of sympathy which will be most useful to society will also be most conducive to the happiness of the sympathetic individual."37 Sympathy, as felt by an individual, then, did not always serve the interests of society. The rational requirements for action was the critical factor in ethics, not the evolutionary and empirical presence of sentiments of sympathy, which supposedly led 'naturally' to altruistic actions.38 In a later contribu- tion to Mind on "Unreasonable Action," Sidgwick disagreed with various proponents of the emotional basis for ethical action. Moral sentiment had to be more than merely a complex emotion composed of a pleasure-pain calculus and the sympathetic identification with others regarding painful consequences of bad actions. As he argued, moral sentiment must also en- tail an explicit or implicit judgment of an action that ought, or ought not to be performed.39 Even a higher emotion like sympathy was not sufficient, in itself, for moral action. Similarly, the ethicist James Seth at Edinburgh University expressly denied that the animal feeling of sympathy could be identified with, or be the evolutionary precursor to moral sympathy.40 For Seth, a self-conscious being had to posit a good end as a moral value, and although this end might contain aspects of the basic animal feeling, it ex- tended far beyond this feeling to the realm of duty and obligation.41 Seth also disagreed with Spencer's and Stephen's hedonistic calculus that the index of pleasure or happiness could signal what was life-preserving, and said he preferred Darwin's fragmentary ethics.42 Other critics of evolutionary ethical models argued that a natural sci- ence of man was simply unable to account for the existence of a spiritual principle, an argument put forward by the Oxford moral philosopher T.H. Green and the evolutionist Alfred Russel Wallace. Although Wallace al- leged that the forces of natural selection contributed to the evolution of the human body, moral and intelligent faculties were products of the world of spirit and beyond the reach of natural selection.43 Sidgwick and Seth, in 37 Sidgwick, "Review of the "Science of Ethics," 1882, 583. 38 For a useful summary of Sidgwick's objections see Richards, 319-23. 39 H.

SYMPATHY AS IMITATION AND/OR RESPONSE Contributors to Mind were simply not in agreement as to the definition of sympathy, or how it operated. It could be seen variously as instinctive, imitative, or as a considered conscious response. In his 1859 Emotions and the Willy Alexander Bain identified two stages of sympathy. The first oc- curred when one assumed a state, movement or action of another by mak- ing an association between one's actual movements and the perception of movements in another. This was a physical, imitative process that could often be infectious, especially when transmitted by those who could vividly manifest their emotion. Bain noted that the sympathetic impulse was wider than the tender affections, "for whenever we see strong emotion mani- fested, we feel ourselves carried away by the current, although our tender feelings would point some other way."44 The second stage completed the act of sympathy, with the assumption of a mental state similar to the other's mental state. According to Bain's associationist scheme, once the outward signs of emotion were taken on, they created a wave that penetrated into the conscious mind, thus completing the process of sympathizing with other minds.45 Bain understood sympathy to arise by association through the pain-pleasure vector. For instance, if one heard reports of others being hun- gry and cold, one could recollect instances in which one had had similar experiences, and then would enter into "sympathetic unison with the suf- ferer."46 If Bain put forth an associative theory of sympathy, Charles Darwin and the American psychologist James Mark Baldwin stressed its instinctive elements. Darwin presented empirical evidence for the early presence of sympathy in child development in "A Biographical Sketch of an Infant" published in Mind in 1877. This study was published from notes on his tions (London: Macmillan and Co., 1891), 469-78; Review of "Darwinism: An Exposi- tion of the Theory of Natural Selection, with some of its Applications by Alfred Russel Wallace," Mind 14, no. 55 (1889): 448-49. 44 Bain, The Emotions and the Will (1859), 217. 45 Ibid., 216. 46 Ibid., 217. 274</page><page sequence="11">Lanzoni ♦ The Journal Mind in its Early Years, 1876-1920 own child taken thirty-seven years earlier.47 He identified the first evidence of the feeling of sympathy in his infant at 6 months and 1 1 days, which comprised a mirroring response to his nanny - the baby looked sad upon the nurse's pretending to cry.48 Darwin critiqued Bain's associationist view of sympathy, wondering how this mechanism could account for the in- creased sympathy that was directed towards loved objects.49 For Darwin, sympathy was an instinct that gave one direct pleasure and emerged most vividly from the connection or alliance to the person suffering, and not merely from the idea of suffering. He allowed that sympathy may have first developed through association, but over time it had become an instinct. Bain acknowledged that some manifestations of feeling were instinctually copied in others, but argued that most forms of expression were acquired through the child's associative learning.50 For the genetic psychologist J. Mark Baldwin, sympathy was simply the "imitative emotion par excellence."51 In his 1895 contribution to Mind, he identified the mechanism of imitation as the key to many cognitive abili- ties. Imitation functioned as the central law of the progressive interaction of the organism and the environment, a kind of transference from the world to the mind. Baldwin disagreed with Bain that imitation could only be a conscious, voluntary process developed according to the laws of inducing pleasure and pain.52 Bain had claimed that because imitation emerged in the second half of the first year of an infant's life, it was not early enough to be deemed an instinct. For Baldwin, in contrast, imitation was closely allied to suggestion and both operated on "lower, less volitional types of minds."53 The organic form of sympathy (in distinction to its reflective form) was an instinct, which manifested in imitative responses to the world of objects by an infant in the first half of the first year of life. Baldwin described two sympathetic emotional responses in his own child at the age of five months: His child began to weep when she perceived a bottle-cork being pinched, and when she saw a picture of a man bowed with head and feet in stocks. These images were coupled in an unconscious way to her 47 Darwin, "A Biographical Sketch of an Infant," Mind 2, no. 7 (1877): 285-94, 285; Neary(2001),64. 48 Darwin, "A Biographical Sketch of an Infant," 289. 49 Darwin, Descent of Man, 81. 50 Bain, The Emotions and the Will (1859), 211. 51 J.

In a nod to the James-Lange theory of emotion, Baldwin speculated that it was also possible that seeing emotion in another stimulated motor expres- sion, which then aroused the emotional state. As the historian Ruth Leys has argued, the theory of imitation (and its close relation to sympathy and suggestion) was a prominent feature of so- cial thought in the United States in the early years of the twentieth century.54 As Baldwin put it, "Imitation is then the method by which our living milieu in all its aspects gets carried over and reproduced within us."55 One's self was built up through a series of imitations of others, and one could under- stand another's suggestion or demand "because it represents a part of my- self, inasmuch as I have become what I am in part through my sympathy with you and imitation of you."56 Here, sympathy and imitation worked together to form the self, sympathy being the emotional concomitant to the more general process of imitation. Viewed as emotional imitation, however, sympathy could hold dan- gers; it could easily slide into mere contagion, or the rule of the crowd. Bain had likened forms of imitative sympathy to mesmeric sleep, and cautioned that a patient in bad health should not be exposed to violent emotions, which the patient could easily take on.57 As sympathy was the mechanism through which one was subject to the influence of other minds, it could lead to conservative trends, a squelching of innovation and a tendency to overlook one's real, inner feelings.58 Bain claimed that mutual sympathy between members of a school class could serve as an impetus to learning, although there remained the danger that it could merely result in medioc- rity.59 Helen Bosanquet noted in Mind that she was relieved that the interest in imitation was not prominent in England, where, "intelligent co-opera- tion and organized response are far more operative than in either France or America."60 Her husband, Bernard Bosanquet, concurred, arguing that the 54 Ruth Leys, "Mead's Voices: Imitation as Foundation; or, the Struggle against Mimesis," in Modernist Impulses in the Human Sciences, 1870-1930, ed.

These diverse re- sponses made sympathy problematic as the fount of a system of ethics. Sidgwick argued that sympathy directed toward another's pain was not necessarily imitative, and involved a possible number of responses: one could take pleasure in others' pain when in a malevolent mood, feel excite- ment in hearing the narrative of other's pain, or respond with no percepti- ble emotion.62 Bain agreed that sympathy did not directly follow the representation of other's pain, as sometimes a malevolent pleasure in the other's pain could intrude.63 Darwin pointed out that although sympathy and its expression in tears were instinctual responses, they were also mallea- ble. Responses could be restrained, usually more for one's own sake than for others. He thus acknowledged the importance of experience and habit in shaping sympathetic emotion.64 In recollection, for instance, the instinct of sympathy was stronger than other instincts, leading to remorse and dis- satisfaction with oneself - the workings of conscience. And Stephen, who had argued for the moral reach of sympathy, admitted that the primary sympathy one felt for others could be modified in a thousand ways, but he reassured his readers that the direct and normal case marked out a path from sympathy to genuine altruism.65 Equating sympathy with imitation thus did not take into account its reflective or responsive aspects. F. H. Bradley limited the imitation of others to a rudimentary sympathy - "the expression of a feeling by another person produces in my mind the feeling which I have similarly expressed."66 What was important was whether this basic sympathy translated into concern for the other. Helen Bosanquet also stressed the reflective aspect of sympathy: "True, the possibility of sympathy lies in the knowledge of how I feel; but if that knowledge is to become sympathy it must cease to be echo and become response."67 To make a distinction between imitation and response, Hiram 61 Bernard Bosanquet, "Social Automatism and the Imitation Theory" Mind, New Series, 8, no. 30 (1899): 167-75, 171 62 Sidgwick, "Review of the "Science of Ethics," (1882), 579. 63 Bain, "On some Points in Ethics" Mind 8, no. 29 (1883): 49-68, 60. 64 Darwin, The Descent of Man, 86. 65 Stephen, Science of Ethics, 239. 66 F.

As he put it, pity allowed one to have an emotion about an emotion.68 Baldwin too had discussed reflective sympathy as a genetic development emerging from the organic variety in his 1897 study of social psychology: In organic sympathy, the relation is a matter of organic reaction due to natural selection, we may suppose; reflective sympathy reaf- firms the social value of the reaction, utilizes it, and in discovering the relations of persons for itself, in a reflective and critical way, goes on to refine the reactions and embody them in the institutions of social life.69 For Baldwin, sympathetic imitation, in itself, was insufficient for the devel- opment of ethical principles, which emerged through obedience to the law- giving personality.70 As these accounts show, then, sympathy was a divided entity - an organic feeling or instinct, as well as a considered response to another's suffering. SYMPATHY AS EPISTEMOLOGY Although the ethical import of sympathy held center stage in the pages of Mind, some contributors pointed out that sympathy was closely entwined with cognition, and could yield knowledge of other minds. In order to think about and represent others' feelings, according to Stephen, one had to en- gage an intellectual apprehension of other sentient beings: "Put yourself in his place" is not merely a moral precept; it is a logical rule implied in the earliest germs of reason as a description of reasoning itself, so far as it deals with other sentient beings. To know that a man has certain feelings is to have representative feel- ings, not equal in intensity, but identical in kind. Sympathy and reason have so far an identical factor - each implies the other.71 68 Hiram M.

Bain argued that sympathy paralleled self-consciousness in "enabling us to know other men, as self- consciousness enables us to comply with the precept 'know thyself.' "75 Al- though Bain had helped usher in an associationist psychology with physio- logical leanings in the 1850s, by the 1890s he stressed the importance of introspection for the study of emotion, calling it "the alpha and omega of psychological inquiry."76 Introspection was necessary to break up the com- plex and plural elements of one's emotional nature into constituent parts, and it was useful for a sympathetic appraisal of others' emotional and men- tal states.77 In order to fully understand the expressions of others, one had to validate them in reference to one's own inner consciousness.78 Through the concurrent workings of introspection and sympathy, the full sequence of mental events both in oneself and in others could be understood. A sympathetic approach to other minds was also necessary for an evo- lutionary psychology of feeling. The psychologist Hiram M. Stanley pointed out in Mind that feeling should be understood as the "purely sub- jective factor in consciousness."79 In his 1895 Studies in the Evolutionary Psychology of Feelings Stanley argued that it was only "a trained and sym- pathetic mind" that could to some extent project itself into the mind's earli- est stages. Understanding feeling was a confluence of both knowledge and experience: "To know the fact we must have the fact, we must be what we know."80 One needed special means to understand another's experience; 72 Ibid., 237. 73 Ibid., 230. 74 Sidgwick, Review of "Science of Ethics," 578. 75 Bain, Emotions and the Will, 221. 76 Alexander Bain, "The Respective Spheres and Mutual Helps of Introspection and Psy- chophysical Experiment in Psychology," Mind! no.5 (1893): 45; Rick Rylance, Victorian Psychology and British Culture 1850-1880 (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2000), 173, 202. 77 Bain, "The Respective Spheres" (1893), 42. 78 Ibid., 48. 79 H.

However, sympathetic knowledge was limited. For example, a man could never have maternal feelings, so that such feelings would be "beyond his scientific anal- ysis."81 Given these epistemological constraints, Stanley concluded pessi- mistically, "There is then, I think, a vast range of psychic life which must for ever lie wholly hidden from us, either as infinitely below or infinitely above us. . . ."82 Others saw the sympathetic understanding of other minds as more ac- cessible and trustworthy. The psychologist Sophie Bryant, one of the first women to receive a doctorate of science in England, wrote that sympathy could, in a direct way, shed light on others' mental states. Bryant was head of the North London Collegiate School from 1895-1918, and conducted association tests in the informal experimental psychological laboratory set up with James McKeen Cattell at Cambridge University. In an 1895 contri- bution to Mind, she described sympathy as a means of knowing or an intu- ition that took place outside of the realm of consciousness. Intuition was an emotional imitativeness, whereby, in a model similar to Bain's, one first physically imitated the signs of the feeling of the other, and this bodily mirroring in turn led to emotional involvement. It was a skill requiring accurate observation, proficiency of imagination, and muscular mobility, and those that possessed such traits had an "intuitive gift."83 Once emo- tional imitativeness was achieved, sympathy could result from the harmony of the other's feelings with one's self, resulting in a "joyful expansion of self beyond self."84 Antipathy was based on the same initial stage of emotional imitativeness, but was followed by a negative physical reverberation, or revulsion towards the other. Revulsion resulted from the incongruity of the imitated feelings with one's moral ideal. Those who were prone to imitation but incapable of deep sympathies or antipathies were impressionable char- acters who lacked individuality and were "an instrument on which any other can play any tune."85 At the same time, the state in which one merely echoed another's feelings without strong antipathy or sympathy lent itself well to study, thus forming a basis for an epistemology of the other.86 Some were more attuned to the epistemological flaws in the sympa- 81 Ibid., 6. 82 Ibid. 83 Sophie Bryant, "Antipathy and Sympathy," Mind 4, no. 15 (1895): 365-70, 369. 84 Ibid., 366. 85 Ibid., 370. 86 Ibid., 368. 280</page><page sequence="17">Lanzoni ♦ The journal Mind in its Early Years, 1876-1920 thetic appraisal of others. James Sully, Professor of Mind and Logic at Uni- versity College in London agreed with Bryant that the "immediate intuition of others' feelings or thoughts" was not a conscious process. But reading or interpreting the mental states of others could be extremely faulty, especially for those of a "highly sympathetic nature" who were "eager for the re- sponse of another mind."87 In his 1881 contribution to Mind, he described errors of understanding others such as assuming that an actor's simulated emotion was true, or misinterpreting a slight peculiarity of someone's fea- tures as expressive of an emotion, for instance, an elevated eyebrow.88 These errors paralleled the difficulties in introspecting one's own feelings, where unskilled practitioners might falsely attribute internal feelings to some external event, or fail to see inferences in an emotion, and deem it an intuitive emotion.89 Bryant did concede that there was an ever present possibility of misreading others - a pseudo-sympathy - which was merely an imaginative projection of one's own sorrows and joys into another's mind. The prospect for sympathetic knowledge of others was closely linked to the reliability of introspection for these philosophers and psychologists. Yet, it was also the case that sympathetic responses could provide a window onto one's own unconscious processes, which were unavailable through normal processes of introspection. As Bryant put it, "Instincts in ourselves of which we are unconscious, having never given them play, will make us sympathize with others manifesting them."90 Social sympathies then offered epistemological clues to the individual psyche, as "we can read much of our unconscious nature in our social consciousness."91 Sympathetic knowledge, in this instance, was not only a tool for knowing the other, but providing a means for accessing the deeper recesses of the self. SYMPATHY AND AESTHETICS If sympathetic knowledge of other minds was, for many, a questionable scientific epistemology, sympathy could more reliably function as an inter- subjective foundation for aesthetics.

Along with imitation and ambition, sympathy was for Burke a social passion, one that undergirded both the appraisal of others and the functioning of imagination in aesthetic re- sponse.93 Contributors to Mind were anxious not to lose sight of the social as- pects of aesthetics in an atmosphere where aesthetics was increasingly grounded in a physiology of pleasure. In his 1877 review of Grant Allen's Physiological Aesthetics in Mind, Sully allowed that the social view of aes- thetics was limited in its appraisal of beauty, content, and the formal as- pects of art, yet a science of aesthetics nonetheless required a psychology that did not center on a subjective or individual appraisal of aesthetic feel- ings.94 Sully also reviewed the French philosopher Jean-Marie Guyau's writings on art and education, warning that art should not be understood solely a means for socializing emotion. At the same time he claimed that Guyau's work was located on the "foremost wave-crest of our new scien- tific thought."95 Guyau's emphasis on the sympathetic character of aesthetic phenomena coincided with the development of a science of sociology in the work of Emile Durkheim in the 1890s.96 Although Sully did not embrace Guyau's thorough-going sociology of aesthetics, he did emphasize the im- portance of sociality linked to evolutionary development, or "the reciprocal actions of many minds in the social organism."97 These laws of mental de- velopment in the race could provide an inter subjective, scientific foundation for aesthetics by pinpointing the "uniformities of pleasurable and painful experience which are to be observed among our bodily tastes."98 In this light, Sully cautioned against individual aesthetic interpretation, 92 Sully, "Review of Physiological Aesthetics," by Grant Allen, Mind 2. no. 7 (1877): 387-92, 392. 93 Edmund Burke, A Philosophical Enquiry into the Origin of our Ideas of the Sublime and Beautiful (Cambridge: Chadwyck-Healey, 1999).

It was an error made by those who were drawn to soli- tude and those with a strong emotional predisposition: The lonely communer with nature, though he has turned his back on human sympathizers, tends to spread his deepest feelings over his inanimate surroundings. His longing, his sadness, his momen- tary delights seem to flash back upon him from the face of nature as from a mirror. And it is this strong emotional craving for sym- pathy which so often underlies those quaint poetic transforma- tions of natural objects into living forms on which I had occasion to dwell when speaking of illusions of sense." In contrast to this individual approach, aesthetics should offer social, not personal gratification, as it engaged social emotions in a public and sympa- thetic form. The public character of aesthetics ensured the intersection of the ethical and the aesthetic because, in Sully's view, an immoral or anti- social sentiment would not be aesthetically appreciated.100 For Bain as well, shared feeling was a critical feature of aesthetics: "We feel drawn by sympathy towards one who has attended to the same objects as ourselves, or who has seized and put into vivid prominence what we have felt without expressing to ourselves."101 Indeed, feeling was critical to aesthetics for Bain, as the intensity of feeling contributed to the depth and quality of the imagination.102 Aesthetic sympathy entailed an experienced synchrony with other viewers or the artist's perception of the world. Al- though Henry Rutgers Marshall emphasized the importance of hedonics in aesthetics, he also acknowledged that an individual's pleasure in an aes- thetic object was intensified by the sympathetic knowledge that others re- sponded in a similar way.103 This element was important in all art of a higher sort.104 The sympathetic sharing of pleasure classified touch as non- aesthetic, and perfumery and cookery as only limited arts because they 99 Sully, "Illusions of Introspection" (1881), 7. 100 Sully, "Art and Psychology" (1876), 473. 101 Bain, Emotions and the Will (1859), 226. 102 Alexander Bain, Practical Essays (London: Longmans, Green, &amp; Co., 1884), 15-16. 103 H.

Similar views were voiced by the industrial design educator William Smith who adopted an associative model of sympathy and imitation, through which, "The ex- perience of others is copied . . . the narrow subjectivity, the abstract self- reference of the animal's primal life has been transcended."105 Sympathy then afforded an extension of the self's aesthetic feelings to others, and was one way to argue for a scientific or objective aesthetics. A strictly objective aesthetics had its limits, however, and Sully pointed to differences in aesthetic feelings that he attributed to nationality, histori- cal development, and even to differences between cultivated persons.106 Marshall pointed out aesthetic differences due to race, life and habit, na- tional life, tribes, families, wealth, age, among others.107 Psychological study could help form aesthetic standards that were not absolute then, but relatively stable and unchangeable.108 For Sully, the study of mental evolu- tion would provide laws of growth that could in turn provide aesthetic standards, as "it may assist us in determining the greater and the less, the superior and the inferior, among artistic results."109 CONCLUSION Henry Rutgers Marshall's 1892 claim that sympathetic impulses were "so important to our modern social life" was supported by a diverse array of contributors to Mind in the late nineteenth century.110 Most Anglo-Ameri- can intellectuals of the period saw sympathy as a core element of human nature, and agreed with Bain that it was "a fact of our constitution."111 Sympathy was a powerful emotion enlisted to serve many agendas: it pro- vided an evolutionary basis for ethics, offered a model of emotional imita- tion, and was instrumental to sociality. It was also a means for gaining psychological knowledge of others, and could ground a scientific aesthetics. Far more than merely a tender emotion expressed towards others, sympa- thy installed the social at the heart of the individual.

Bain believed that primitive cultures had limited quantities of it; for instance, Siberians did not exhibit sympathy for the lower animals, evidenced by the delight of Siberian boys in the act of burning a dog alive.112 Stephen concurred with Bain that a savage would throw a crying baby to the ground because of "torpid sympathy."113 Although Darwin acknowledged that such dreadful sentiments were also present in developed societies, as the universal practice of slavery demonstrated, he thought that the savage races still possessed a lower standard of morality than that of the civilized European.114 Presum- ably then, the European could call upon a cultivated sympathy to reject heinous impulses, and could extend sympathy to others beyond his or her own immediate community. If the primitive suffered from a want of sympathy, sympathetic excess was to some extent coded as feminine: it was a Victorian commonplace that women were better endowed with altruistic and sympathetic senti- ments than men, a view shared by Darwin, Romanes and other evolution- ists.115 In a tradition stretching back to the time of Erasmus Darwin, women played an important role in the tradition of the teaching of sympathy to children, especially for non-human animals.116 Indeed, Bryant presented the womanly ideal as centered on sympathy, and only secondarily on strength.117 Excessive sympathy was opposed to sober scientific inquiry and the pursuit of truth, an argument often used to combat the anti-vivisection- ists.118 Sympathy was nonetheless fundamental to the moral lives of both men and women, and to this end Stephen could decry excessive sentiment and emotion as unmanly, while championing sympathy as inherently ratio- nal and at the core of ethics.119 Sympathy played such an important role in intellectual culture pre- cisely because it could combat the dangers of the asocial and the immoral: as Darwin put it, without social instincts, one would be an "unnatural 112 Bain, "Is there Such a Thing as Pure Malevolence?"

G. F. Stout, who was to become the editor of Mind in 1892, firmly rejected Maudsley's pessimism and materialism, noting in a review of Maudsley's Body and Willy that his vision of cosmic degeneration resulting in the failure of the sun's light was merely prophetic folly.121 Yet increasingly, supporters of the moral aspects of sympathy had to defend its efficacy in the face of theories of degeneration and the workings of the malevolent instincts. In the pages of Mind, Stephen, Bradley, and Sully explained that malevolence was not a pure emotion, but was secondarily derived from power, self-assertion, or from an evolutionary means of self-protection.122 Bain, however, took a much less sanguine view, deeming malevolence an elemental part of human nature.123 His catalogue of malevolent acts ranged from comedy, teasing, and degradation, to spectacles of torture and suffering, all of which could bring delight to their perpetrators or spectators: certain modes of suffering, such as the starvation of the unof- fending, grate upon our cultivated sympathies, and are objection- able on that ground. With nothing more abnormal than dullness of sympathy, which is so abundantly exemplified in the history of mankind, the starvation of any number of unoffending creatures, would be extremely enjoyable. The sight of physical torture is as bad as starvation, if not worse, and that has given ecstasy to mil- lions.124 It lay to sympathy to resist such terrible pleasures.
