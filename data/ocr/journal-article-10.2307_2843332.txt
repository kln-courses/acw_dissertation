<plain_text><page sequence="1">20 NOTES ON THE CUSTOMS AND BELIEFS OF THE WA-GIRIAMA, ETC., BRITISH EAST AFRICA. BY CAPTAIN W. E. H. BARRETT, Assistant Native Affairs. [INTRODUCTORY NOTE BY C. W. HOBLEY, C.M.G. THE Giriama people inhabit a strip of country commencing some ten to fifteen miles inland from the east coast between Kilifi and the Sabaki River. They are, as far as is known, a pure Bantu race, and very closely resemble the Wa-Duruma and Wa-Diga who live further south. Like the Duruma people they erect monu- ments at the graves of their relatives and these are often anthropomorphic in ,character.] Marriage, etc. WHEN a father considers it is time his son married, he tells him to look for a wife. The young man will look about for a suitable girl, and when he has found her informs her eldest brother that he wishes to marry her. He will then proceed to the brother's house accompanied by two or three of hiis male friends. The girl is sent for and arrives with two or three girl friends. Her brother asks her if she wishes to marry her suitor. If she declines the honour the matter is finished. If the girl consents, the suitor for her hand will return to his home. For the next three days he will come and see her, both his friends and hers being together -with them. On returning home the third evening he will tell his father that he -wishes to marry a certain girl, tells his father her nanme, and asks him to take some tembo (beer) to her father and arrange matters. The following morning the old man will proceed to the girl?s father's house, taking with him a small gourd of tembo, and handing him the tembo, tells him the object of his visit. The recipient places the temnbo in an earthen cooking pot, and then sends for his daughter. On her arrival he hands her a small drinking bowl (mboko) and asks her if she wishes to marry the young man in question. If she now declines to do so, the tembo is returned to the suitor's father and the matter is finished. If she consents, her father tells her to dip her mboko into the tembo and to drink.</page><page sequence="2">CAPTAIN W. E. H. BARRETT.-NOteS on the Customs of the Wa-Giriama, etc. 21 She takes a sip at the tembo and hands the mboko to her father, who again asks her if she is sure that she wishes to marry. If she says "No," the matter ends here, and the tembo is returned to the suitor's father. If she consents to the marriage she quits the house, and leaves the old men together. At this conference other elders are also present, friends of both parties. After the girl's departure the old men drink the tembo and eat food, which her father had prepared for them. Three or four days later the father of the young man takes two or three more gourds of tembo to the girl's father, which is drunk by them and their friends. After a few days he takes one more gourd of tembo to the girl's father, and this is drunk by those present. On this occasion before going liome the suitor's father will leave with the father of the girl a knife, hoe or other article, saying that on such and such a date he will bring the property to be paid for the daughter. On the day named by him he brings the property agreed upon, and hands it over to the girl's father. After a few days he will bring one or two more gourds of tembbo. A few days later he brings one gourd of tembo; when this has been drunk by those assembled, he informs the girl's father that he now wants his son to be given his bride. The girl's father now gives some small article to the suitor's father, and tells him that on such and such a day he will hand over his daughter The evening before the da-y arranged the suitor will proceed to his sweetheart's village, and that night he will sleep there. Early the next morning the bride is handed over to her husband by her father. Before she leaves her father's village, the old man spills a little tembo on the ground and tells her to obey her husband in all things; afterwards sipping a little water into his mouth he spits it over her. His daughter then puts her lips up to his, and he lets a little water run from his mouth into hers; this is said to bring her luck in her married life. This ceremony finished the bridegroom takes his wife to his house, and their friends go with them. The bride is clothed from her shoulders downwards in a long red or black cloth. The bridegroom must always appear in person to take his bride; he cannot be represented by a proxy. The day after the inarriage the husband kills a goat, and cutting off a piece of skin from its forehead, makes it into an amulet and gives it to his wife, who wears it on her left arm. The flesh of the goat is then eaten by those present, and a great deal of tembo is drunk. The total amount of tembo given to the father of the girl for her hand in nlarriage is fifteen gourds (kiama). Only a certain number, however, are given before the marriage, and the balance may be paid at any time. In the event of a woman deserting her husband, he must pay up any balance of the fifteen kiama there may be remaining before be can claim the children of the marriage. The sexes are not allowed free sexual intercourse with each other before marriage as in some tribes. Many of the women have male friends, but this is unknown, as a rule, to their husbands. If a man is caught committing - adultery</page><page sequence="3">22 CAPTAIN W. E. H. BARRETT.-NVOteS on the Customs and with another man's wife, he must pay up a fine of ten goats to the injured hiusband. Friends sometimes make an agreement which allows them to sleep in each other's houses, and with each other's wives. All of the parties, however, must agree to this. It sometimes happens that the wife of A is willing to sleep with B, but the wife of B objects to sleep with A. The friendship between A and B is promptly broken off, as it is considered to be dangerous to be friends any longer. 'These agreements are made after, and not before marriage. Wives are obtained by purchase, and a man is allowed to have as many wives as he can afford to buy. A man likes to get as many wives as possible, as they work for him and bear him children. The main object of every Giriama is to have as many children as possible. A man cohabits with his wife immediately after marriage. Men abstain from cohabiting with their wives during menstruation. In the event of the death of relations of either party, they will nlot cohabit until the seven days of mourning (hanga) are passed. Also for twelve days after a woman has borne a child. During war time men do not cohabit with their wives, as they say it brings bad luck to them. They believe that if they do cohabit with their wives during war time that they will be unable to kill any of their enemies, and that if they themselves receive a trifling wound it will prove fatal. Husbands sometimes exchange their wives, but the women must agree to this. Any children born before the exchange took place are the property of the first husband. If the woman is enceinte at the time of the exchange, the child, after it has been born and weaned, will be returned to the first husband. Women do not as a rule hold conversation with their father-in-law, as it is considered that they have nothing to talk to him about. If she has any complaints to make against her husband she makes them to his mother. A husband converses with his mother-in-law about his household affairs. No restrictions are placed on the social intercourse of brothers and sisters. If a child is born feet foremost, it is smothered. The reasons given for this practice are that if the infant is permitted to live, their crops will all wither up from drought, their cattle will die, and mnany other evils befall them. In cases where a child's parents die, and he has no known relations living, he will be adopted by other people, and is looked upon as their child. Blood relations are not allowed to marry. The reason given for this prohibition is that it would create quarrels in the family. Members of the same clan are also forbidden to marry. All males are circumcised, some as infants, others as boys, and others wait until they reach the age of manhood. When several youths are circumcised at the same time, a number of goats will be killed and a big feast held. For seven days after they have been circumcised, the patients will sleep out in the bush near their village, a roof of boughs and grass having been erected to shelter them from the sun and rain. Food is taken to them by their mothers. The severed foreskin is thrown away.</page><page sequence="4">Beliefs of the Wa-Giriama, etc., British East Africa. 23 Sometimes one sees women with small scars cut on their stomachs. These scars are said to add to their beauty. The usual price paid for a wife is five head of cattle. Death, nurder, burial, etc. If an apparently healthy person dies suddenly, the relations of the deceased will go to an mganga (doctor) and ask him if death was due to natural causes or otherwise. If the mganga after making medicine decides that deceased has been killed he will name a certain person as the murderer. This individualis promptly seized by the relations of deceased, and ordered to pay up koreh (if deceased was a male he must hand over two males, if a female he must hand over two females) to them. If he denies his guilt, he has to go through a test called keraho cha fisi. The mgagtga, accompanied by another man, proceeds into the bush and collects the roots and leaves of the mbareh, a small shrub. When they have gathered sufficient they return, and placing the roots and leaves in a kinu (= mortar) (wooden receptacle used by women for breaking up corn in) pour water on them and smash them up with a pole. When the juice from the roots and leaves has become sufficiently mixed up in the water, the mixture is poured into a kifrtvz (coconut shell) and given by the mganga to the accused to drink, at the same time telling him that if he is innocent there is no danger in drinking, but that if he is guilty he will die. If accused declines to drink he is killed by deceased's relations, sometimes by strangulation, and at others by arrow or knife. If a female child dies within three days of birth, or a male child within four days of birth, or a child is still-born, the corpse is buried in the house under the place where the water bowls stand. All other persons with a few exceptions are buried in the village not far from the house where they died. When anyone dies, all ornaments, etc., are taken off the corpse, which is then washed in cold water, if a male by his brother, if a female by her mother or grandmother, and the head is shaved by a friend. The corpse is then clothed in new garments, and afterwards entirely wrapped up in a white cloth. It is then placed on a mat and carried to the grave which has been dug to receive it. Males are placed in the grave lying on their right side, and females lying on their left side. Only one corpse is placed in one grave. Monuments raised in memory of the dead by the Wa-Giriama are of two kinds: (1) Vigango, which are figures which are carved out of flat pieces of wood about 2 inches thick, and about 5 feet in length and 9 inches in breadth. (2) Koma, which are short pieces of stick. These monuments are sometimes placed in an upright position at the head of a deceased's grave, and at others are placed in some prominent part of the village. A coconut bowl is placed at the foot of each and in front of it.</page><page sequence="5">24 CAPTAIN W. E. H. BARRETT.-Notes on the Cutstoms and No. 1 is only used if a rich man, or one of his relations have died, and on the day on which it is erected a large feast has to be held, and several sheep or a bullock killed. These animals are killed close to the spot on which the monu- ment stands, and their blood is allowed to flow into the coconut bowl, and on to the figure itself; tembo (beer) is also placed in the bowl. No. 2.-If the relations of the deceased are too poor to afford a big feast, they plant a short piece of stick in the ground and tie a small piece of cloth round it, placing a coconut bowl at its foot. A small feast is held and one or two fowls killed, the blood running into the bowl and on to the kikango. Some tembo is poured into the bowl, as in case No. 1. These monuments are said to represent the deceased. Li No. 1.No. C. Piece of cloth. B. Piece of goat skin. A. Coconut bowl. A. Coconut howl. If at some future date any of the dead person's relatives are taken ill, they go to a witch doctor, who sometimes tells them that their sickness is due to the fact that the koma (ghost) of one of their deceased relations is hungry. A goat is then killed close to his or her monument as the case may be, and the blood flows into the coconut bowl. Tembo is then placed in the bowl. This is done to appease the ghost of the deceased. A piece of skin from the head of the goat is then tied round the monument. .Always before drinking tembo in the village where a monument stands, the deceased's relations will place a little of it in the coconut bowl at the foot of the kikango. Suicides are buried in the same manner as other people. If a man is killed when away from his village, he is buried near the spot where he died. Women will sometimes, after deserting their husbands, kill their children to avoid having to hand them back to their father.</page><page sequence="6">Beliefs of the Wa-Giriama, etc., British East Africa. 25 The Wa-Giriama say that suicides among both men and women occur at intervals. The women hang themselves with the cord which they have used round their waists to support their mcarinda (short skirt). Corpses are carried out of the house through the door, and no special openinig is made in the house for carrying them through. The ghosts of the departed are feared, and it is to propitiate these that vigango and koma are erected, and a coconut bowl placed at their feet, into which tembo and the blood of slaughtered animals and fowls are poured. These offerings are made in order to prevent the ghosts of the departed from bringing ill-luck on the village. If a man dies, his relations stop in his house for five days after his death, and if a female dies, her relations stop in her house for four days after her death. Food, water, etc., is brought to them by their friends. They are of course allowed out for purposes of nature. If a wife dies, her husband wears new white cloth for one month, and puts no grease on his body for thlat period. If a husband dies, his wife wears a new white mrcarinda (female dress) and puts no grease on her body until she marries again. Persons who have handled a corpse are not regarded as unclean, but they wash their hands before eating food for the first time, after handling a dead body. The WATa-Giriama do not believe in any form of resurrection. If one man murders another he must pay up koreh to the relations of the deceased (two males if deceased person a male, and two females if deceased person a female). If he refuses. to do this he is killed by deceased's relations, or one of deceased's clan. If a murderer escapes, one of his clan is killed. This brings about a fight between the two clans, which is eventually stopped by the elders on both sides meeting and settling the dispute. A man who has killed in war a man of another tribe, such as Masai or Galla, always uses his left hand to pass his cup to his lips when drinking tembo. Property, inheritance, slaves. Each man places a boundary mark round his shamba or plantation. Sometimes a boundary consists of a path, at others small sticks, etc., are put down to mark the boundary. On the death of a man his land belongs nominally to his eldest son, but in reality all the sons have an equal share in it. They all work the land, and the produce from it is equally divided amongst them. In case of a quarrel amongst them, the land is equally divided up and each takes his share. If a man dies leaving no sons, his land is divided up amongst his brothers. Women are not permitted to inherit any property except ornaments left by their deceased relations. If a man dies and leaves only a son, who is a child, the eldest brother of the deceased takes over his brother's property and looks after it until his nephew is old enough to look after his own affairs. When the day to hand over the property</page><page sequence="7">26 CAPTAIN W. E. H. BARRETT.-NVOteS on the Customs and arrives, the corn, etc., in the village obtained from the shamba (plantation) is divided up amongst those who worked it. The shamba is then handed over to the son of deceased. All profit made on the shamba before this date goes to the people who worked it. A shamnba always remains the property of the man who first started it unless he sells it. Even if he deserts it for many years it still belongs to him, and if at any time he hears that someone else is working it, he can go to that person and order him to pay for the land, or else leave it alone. Forest or bush is anybody's property, and all have grazing rights there. Shambas are sold according to their size. Relations living in the same village, as a rule, all cuiltivate one shamba. The value of a house for a husband and family is Rs. 4 or Rs. 5 according to its size. As a protection against the theft of crops, medicine is planted there; it is called a kiapo, or oath. On the death of an elder, his slaves used to be given the choice of becoming the property of any of the deceased's sons they preferred. The majority of slaves were formerly bought from Arabs and Swahilis. Children from parents, one of whom is a slave, have the samie status as any other children. Food, stock, etc. The chief crops to be found in the Giriama country are :-Mohindi (Indian corn), mawele (millet), wimbi (eleusine), iunde (beans), mtama (sorghum), sim sirn (sesamum), pojo (pulse), and mpunga (rice). Nunmbers of Wa-Giriama grow coconuts. Males and females are both allowed to eat the same kinds of food. Both are permitted to eat anything they fancy except in certain cases of sickness, when the ?nganga forbids certain foods. Grain, etc., is stored on wooden platforms (lutzaga) built in the house, and fires are usually lighted under these to prevent the stores from getting mouldy. The Wa-Giriama do not appear to possess a large quantity of cattle, but have a fair number of goats and sheep. They also keep fowls, and in many villages ducks are to be found. It is only at very important feasts that cattle are killed, for minor feasts goats and even chickens are killed. Numbers of Wa-Giriama will not eat sheep wlhen suffering from a disease called safura, as they say that the flesh of sheep increases the sickness. The manner of killing the stock is by cutting the throats. Cattle are tended by males, but are milked by both males and femalea. The Wa-Giriama have no objection to selling their milk to strangers. They themselves drink both fresh and sour milk, and do not boil it. Cattle are known by cuts on the ears, and by brandings on the body. The Wa-Giriama do not object to [the young of] an animal serving its own mother if nlecessary. They do not consider that the progeny will be weaklings. The Wa-Giriamna are extremely fond of drink, and make tembo (beer) from the ;oconut palm, rnkoma (hypharne palm), wimbi (honey, sugar-cane), mtamna and mtohindi. They prefer the tembo made from the coconut palm, as it is the strongest.</page><page sequence="8">Beliefs of the Wa-GCiriama, etc., British East Africa. 27 When several men go hunting together the hide and horlns are the property of the man first wounding the beast. The meat is divided up amongst them. If an elephant is killed the man who first wounded it takes one tusk, the other is sold and the money obtained divided up equally among the other hunters. Husbands and wives eat together, but male children eat with their father and female children with their mother. Cannibalism is not practised. When a bullock or goat is killed, its blood is collected in a bowl, and then placed in a cooking pot and eooked with the flesh of the animal. The cooked blood and meat are eaten together. The Wa-Giriama seem to be very fond of their dogs, which in the majority of cases appear to be well fed. Often one sees these animals decorated with bells, or collars made of sheep skin. They say the dogs are very useful to them in keeping monkeys and other animals away from their crops. One also frequently finds cats in the villages. Fire. Fire is produced by friction made between two sticks, one hard (,7mkerindi) and ,one softer (mrulumeh). Both these sticks are obtained from the mukerinidi tree, but the one called after the tree is hardened in the fire, and the mulurneh is only dried in the sun. A hole about i inch in diameter and about the same depth is bored in -the mukerindi fire stick, the point of the mulumreh is then placed in the hole, and friction obtained by twisting the latter round backwards and forwards between the palms of the hands until fire is produced. Fire is inade by any male capable of making it. Dance held to cqure a person possessed of a devil. 0 0 0 o Q Q = Males other than drummers.

The sick man said to be possessed of the devil sits down near a small fire, his ,entire body hidden by a large white cloth. Sitting near to him are the drummers -and his male friends; on the opposite side of the fire sits a female witch doctor with a number of other women. If witch doctor is a male he sits with males. The ,drummers beat the drums, and the remainder of the people chant; for some time the sick man remains perfectly still but after about half an hour or so his head 7begins to sway about, and he starts trembling, at first slightly, and then violently.</page><page sequence="9">28 CAPTAIN W. E. H. BARRETT.-IOteS on the Customs and After a very violent fit of trembling and shakina about, the drumming and chanting ceases, and the white cloth is removed from the patient, and a white kanz'a, white sleeveless coat and white cap are placed on him; this is only done if the devil inside him is said to be a Swahili one. Drumming and chanting then start afresh, and the patient then starts his trembling fits again. After a short while the drumming ceases, and the witch doctor comes and sits in front of him and converses with the devil, asking it what it wants. If it asks for anything such as goat or fowl, they are brought and presented to it. Finally, the devil is said to be driven out of the patient, who then rises and dances wildly about in front of the drummers, waving a knife, which is handed to him by one of his friends. The dance is then continued until all become tired, when they retire to their respective houses. Sometimes, when one devil has left a person, a devil of another tribe, such as Somali or Barawa, enters him, and the same procedure is gone through as with the first. Different clothes, however, are placed on the patient for the different devils. For instance, a red tarbush (fez) bound round with cloth will be placed on his head if a Barawa devil has entered him. Mchele dance. Figure No. 1.-The dancers, male and female, move slowly round in a circle, one behind the other, men forming one-half of the perimeter of this circle and women the other half. They move as follows:-The left foot is advanced about six inches and the right foot is then brought up to it: during this figure the arms are swung backwards and forwards, keeping time with the movements of the feet, and the knees are bent. Drums are beaten the whole time. When the dancers get tired they break off and form up for Figure No. 2. Figure, No. 2.-The women line up together, and the men line up facing them, a few feet away. Drums then start beating, and the women advance with the same step as in Figure 1. When they reach the men they start retiring by drawing back the left foot about six inches, and then drawing the right back to it. While the women are retiring, the men advance in the same manner as the women advanced. After retiring a few paces the women stop and allow the men to catch them up. On reaching the women each male rubs his lips or cheeks against the forehead of the woman opposite to him. The women then retire again, and the men advance. On reaching, the place where they first lined up the women halt. and the men retire. After a few moments' pause the women advance again and the same procedure is adopted. They continue to dance until they get tired.</page><page sequence="10">Belie/s of the Wa-Giriamna, etc., British East Africa. 29 NOTES ON THE WA-SANIA. [INTRODUCTORY NOTE, BY C. W. HOBLEY, C.M.G. THE Wa-Sania are of the aboriginal tribes of East Africa, and I believe it may be safely asserted that their origin is unknown. They are dotted about the flat bush country, some distance inland from the N. bank of the Sabaki to about the latitude of Port Durnford; this area was formerly occupied by the Gallas, and the Wa- Sania fell into the position of serfs to them, and some still owe alleg,iance to Galla families to this day. During the last fifty years, however, the Somalis have pushed the Gallas southwards, and it is alleged that numbers of the Wa-Sania have allied themselves with the invading, Somalis. Their customs reflect their long association with the Gallas, and it is hoped that further research will bring to light some trace of their abandoned language, as this might give us some clue to their descent. Captain Barrett gives a few of their folk tales, and in Nos. 4 and 5 our old African friends, the hare and the chameleon, turn up again as cunning as ever. Story No. 6 bears a close resemblance to one I discovered among the A-Kamba and published by the Cambridge Press, but the part of the Ndundu is played by the tortoise.] The Wa-Sania are divided into the following clans:- Gulu. Sabali. Agudeh. Garnado. Sunkana. HIujejh. Mundoyu. Illani. Wayu. Kariu. Irdid. Bolazu. Kujega. Arusi. Gullug. Menta. Buddi. Nurtu. Of these the most important is the Gamado, followed by the Illani and Gulu, the remainder of the tribes are all equal to each other. At present the three most important chiefs among the Wa-Sania are (1) Bashora Burrtum of the Gamado clan. (2) Mataida of the Illani clan. (3) Godana of the Gulu clan. Formerly the Wa-Sania had a language of their own, but they now talk the Galla language, and have forgotten their owln. The Wa-Sania drink the blood of all the larger game aniamals they kill, such as elephants, rhinoceros, buffaloes, also that of bullocks, sheep, and goats. Intercourse of sexes, marriage, etc. A girl lives in the house of her father and mother uintil lher first menstruation is over. As soorn as blood shows itself the father will at once leave the house, alnd</page><page sequence="11">30 CAPTAIN W. E. H. BARRETT.-NOteS on the Customs anbd does not enter it again until the menstruation is over. The girl remains in the house, and is attended to by her mother, and no male is permitted to see her. If for purposes of nature she is obliged to leave the house, she covers her face with a cloth, so that those outside may not see her face. On the day menstruation ceases the girl's body is rubbed over with sim-simr oil or samli (ghee), mixed up with ]itoh, kc'/,chiri, karafu (scents bought from Indian traders), and she is given new clothes, beads, and also brass wire to wind round her arms. From that day she nio longer lives in her parents' house, but in a separate house, which is occupied by other girls of her own age. She lives in this house until she marries. During the first menstruation of a girl she eats apart from the others. When male children reach the age of about five years they sleep out in the open, except during rain, when they are permitted to sleep in their parents' house, or if they are sick, when a small house is built for them. Before marriage the young men and girls carry on the practice of lukh, that is to say, the youths are allowed to insert the penis between the girl's legs and sleep with them in this fashion; but they are not allowed to penetrate the vagina. I believe that the same practice exists amongst other tribes in British East Africa. Blood relations are not permitted to marry each other. The Wa-Sania are polygamous, but are not pernlitted to marry more than three wives, as it is considered that no man is able to provide food, etc., for more than this number. Wives are obtained by purchase. When a young inan wishes to marry a certain girl he will inform his father of the fact. His father will proceed to the girl's father, taking with him a nmurra (about three pounds) of tobacco and a k7roh (small barrel) of honey, and tell him that his son wishes to marry his daughter. If the girl consents to the marriage, the father of the suitor returns to his own house, and for some time after this continues to take tembo (native beer) to the father of the girl. When her father is satisfied with the amount of temnbo he has received, he tells the father of the suitor that he is contented that the marriage should take place. The father of the suitor now presents the girl's father with forty rupees (formerly eighty hands of cotton cloth) and six (buchuim or kidund,) of tembo. The two fathers now arrange a date for the wedding. Early on the morning of the appointed day the women living in the girl's village will build a hut of sticks and grass, which is entered by the bride and bridegroom on the arrival of the latter. Both have previously dressed themselves up in new clothes, and smeared their bodies with sim-sim, or ghee, mixed with scent. The bride also takes with her a coconut-shell full of honey. The bride's friends accompany her into the house, and for several days they all sleep there. After this their friends go home and leave them together. On the eighth day the bride pours the honey from the coco- nut shell into an earthen cooking pot, and, having mixed it up well with water, gives it to all the children of the village. Duiring this time the husband does not cohabit with his wife. The husband lives with his wife's people until the first child is born, when he returins to his</page><page sequence="12">Beliefs of the Wa-Giriama, etc., British East Africa. 31 father's village, taking wife and child with him. After the birth the husband must present the father of the girl with one large elephant tusk. On the day of the wedding dances and feasts are held. Among the Wa-Sania each wife has her own house, and the husband sleeps in turn in the house of each. Men do not cohabit with their wives during menstrua- tion, ninth month of pregnancy, or after child-birth until the child is weaned, and during hunting. They do not cohabit during the ninth month, as they say the child is likely to be killed; after child-birth until the child is weaned, as they say the milk supply of the mother will run short; while hunting, as they say the man will have bad luck, and see no animals to kill. When a man visits the house of a friend the latter will usually permit him to sleep in one of his wives' houses if he wishes to stop the night. On the death of a man his widows becomne the property of the eldest brother of the deceased. If this brother has already three wives, he will hand the women over to other men; but any children born by these women are his property. Women and children are well treated as a rule. If a wife is ill-treated by her husband, her father, or other male relations, will take her away from him. She will be handed back to him if he brings her a present of tembo for her relations and promises not to ill-treat her in the future. If a wife deserts her husband her father does not return any property he has been paid for her; but if she re-marries, her new husband must pay to her former husband the same amount of property as he (the former husband) originally paid to her father for her. If she does not marry again, any children she bears are the property of her husband. Old people are treated with respect. During the period of menstruation a husband may sleep in the same house as his wife, but must not cohabit with Irer, as the Wa-Sania believe that if a man cohabits with a menstruous woman he will become weak. Birth. Children are much desired bv the Wa-Sania. About one month after a female child is born the edges of the child's pudenda are cut by a woman with a kardu (razor). The raw edges are then placed together, and the child's legs are tightly strapped together so that the raw surfaces of the parts grow together, leaving only a small hole to allow the child to micturate. When the flesh has become united, the child's legs are untied. After the birth of her first child the mother remains in her house for three weeks, only leaving it for purposes of nature. When it is necessary for her to leave her home she covers her face with a cloth. After the birth of other children, say the second and third, the mother remains indoors for two weeks. She will, however, remain indoors for seven days only after birth of any children after the third. During the period of seclusion after the birth of a child the mother eats only honey mixed with hot water. During this time the husband does not live in the louse, but with a friend or with another wife. The mother is looked after by one</page><page sequence="13">32 CAPTAIN W. E. H. BARRETT.-Notes on the Customs antd ,of her female relations. On the day the mother leaves the house after the birth of a child a dance is held, but the dancing is not accompanied by feasting. On this day the infanlt is named. The first male child born is named after the grandfather ,on his father's side, and the first female born is namied after her grandmother oni the father's side. The second inale born is namned after the eldest brother of the grandmother on the father's side. The second fenmale born is named after the wife of the eldest brother of grandmother on the father's side. The third male is named after the eldest uncle on the father's side. The third female is named after the eldest aunt on the father's side. If the father has no brothers or sisters the third male will be named after the eldest brother of the mother; the third female will -be named after the eldest sister of the mother. The child's head is shaved on the day that the navel string separates from its -mother. The navel string is then tied up with freshly cut hair from the child's head in a cloth worn by the child, and is left there until the day the child can walk. On that day the navel string and hair are taken by the child's father and thrown into a running stream. Children born feet first are taken out and left to die in the bush. Children are suckled for about a year. If the mother dies, it will be handed over to one of the mother's female relations to suckle. When the child is weaned the father will give a present of cloth to the woman who has weaned it. Males are circumcised when they reach the age of three or four years. They Xare circumcised by a kiriz (doctor), and much temtbo is drunk on the circumcision day. After the operation the patients remain in the house until they have Tecovered, and for the first seven days are given honey mixed with a very little water. The Wa-Sania do not chip, file, or take out their teeth unless suffering from toothache, when the painful tooth will be extracted. Males have one small hole bored in the lobe of each ear when about two and a-half years old. At about the same age females have one hole bored in the lobe of each ear, and also one at the top of each. Property. Every clan has its particular mark for the identification of property, and each member has in addition his own private mark. They are very particular in -putting both marks on their arrows, so that in the event of their wounding a beast which afterwards died, everyolle who saw the arrow sticking in it would know who had killed it, and in consequence whose property it was. If a man wounds an elephant which subsequently dies, and another man findino the dead beast steals the tusks, the man whose property the tusks really are, will, if he hears of the theft, go to the thief and tell him to hand over the stolen property. If he denies the theft he must go with the accuser to the place where the elephant died, and placing his right hand on its skull, say, " If I have stolen the tusks which belong to the accuser, may I die." The Wa-Sania are very afraid</page><page sequence="14">Beliefs of the Wct-Gairiama, etc., British PEast A/rica. 33 of taking this oath, so the thief rather than take it usually hands over the stolen property. A person finding a dead elephant with an arrow of another man's in it will report the fact to him, and receives a reward which varies froin two rupees to twenty, according to the size of the tusks. The flesh of the dead beast is common property. The man firing the first shot into an elephant keeps one tusk if the beast is eventually killed, the other is sold and the proceeds divided up amongst the remaining hunters. Property descends to sons, the elder ones getting a larger share than the younger. If there are no sons the property would all go to the eldest brother of the deceased. - Women are not allowed to inherit property. Formerly the Wa-Sania owned slaves, who were bought from the Arabs. These people, however, were treated more as friends than slaves, and freely intermarried with the Wa-Sania. Children by parents, one of whom was a slave, have the same status as other children. Eire. Fire is produced by friction made between two sticks, one hard and the other somewhat softer. A hole about inch in diameter is made in the hard stick and the point of the softer one is then placed in it, and friction made by twisting the latter round backwards and forwards between the palms of the hands until fire is produced. The hard fire stick is called funyuo, and the softer onie ctahuim; both are obtained from the hoheh tree. Food. Wa-Sania do not eat fish or any carnivorous animal, neither do they eat baboons, mionkeys, ostriches, or the stomach of the elephant or rhinoceros. Women are forbidden to eat pig or zebra. They do not store food for future use, and in consequence are frequently hungry. They drink tembo prepared from honey, and from the juice of the hypharne or borassus palm. They also buy tembo made by Swahilis and others from the coconut palm. Men and women eat separately. Male and female children eat together until they are about two years old; the boys will then eat with their fathers and the girls with their mothers. -Death. When a person dies the corpse is washed in cold water; if a male by a male of the same age as deceased, and if a female by a female of the same age. The above only applies to grown up people. If a child dies, a grown up person of the same sex will wash the corpse. After the corpse is washed it is wrapped up in a white cloth and laid on a grass mat; it is then carried by men to the grave which has been prepared for it in the bush near the village. The grass mat is laid VOL. XLI. D</page><page sequence="15">34 CAPTAIN W. E. H. BARRETT.-Notes on the Customs anLd at the bottom of the grave and small upright sticks are driven into the ground and close together round its edaes; the corpse is laid on this mat and covered over by another mat. Earth is then filled in. Before the burial all the ornaments of deceased are taken off the body. Men are buried lying on their right side and women on their left. If a child is stillborn or dies before it is eight days old it is buried in the house by the women; males do not attend its funeral. Female children under eight days old are buried in the left half of the house as one enters the door, and males on the right half. On the death of a child seven days' mourning are observed, but for an adult days of mourning vary from two to seven. During days of mourning for a wife and until he re-marries, a husband will wear round his neck the bead ornaments formerly worn by his wife, and does not grease his body. During days of mourning for a husband a widow will wear his bow string tied rounld her neck, and does not grease her body. If an adult person dies in a house the house is broken down. Formerly the whole village was deserted, but in these days the occupants remain in it. After handling a corpse a M'Sania will wash his hands. Immediately after a burial all the males present will wash their hands and feet. On the day on which the period of mourning finishes, the males of the village have their heads shaved. The Wa-Sania do not believe in any form of resurrection. Persons killed by wild animals in the bush are not buried, as they say that if the corpse is buried many more of them will be killed in a similar manlier. Murder. If a man kills a man he must give one female to the relations of the deceased; if a female is killed two females must be given to the relations of the deceased. If the murderer refuises to pay up he is lkilled in the same manner that he killed his victim. If a wife commits a murder and her husband refuses to pay up the fine, he is killed, the woman is not punished. If a manl escapes after committing murder and gets away altogether, his nearest male relation will be called upon to pay up the fine; if he refuses he is killed. If the murderer has no male relations his clan will be called upoln to pay the fine; if they refuse, one of their male members is killed by miembers of the clan of the deceased. If a murderer pays up the fine he will buy a sheep and kill it. A feast is made, which is attended by the male relationis of deceased and others. As soon as the animal is killed, its stomach is cut open by the murderer. All those present of the murderer's clan and of the clan of deceased will dip their left hands into the blood in the sheep's stomach, and each clan will sprinkle blood over the members of the other. Blood Brotherhood. The Wa-Sania only make blood brotherhood with the Wa-Giriama. A goat is brought by one of the parties to the spot where the ceremony is to take place.</page><page sequence="16">Beliefs of the Wa-Giriama, etc., British East Africa. 35 The Giriama will seize it by the hind legs and the M'Sania by its forelegs and the father of one of them will cut its throat with a knife. If neither of them has a father living7 the goat will be killed by the head Giriama present. The contracting parties now sit down opposite each other and each man will make two cuts on the breast bone of the other with a knife so that blood flows In the meantime the man who killed the goat has taken out its liver and is roasting it at the fire. When the meat is slightly cooked he cuts off two pieces from it and hands one to each of the contracting parties, who take it and rub it in the blood on their own chest. Each of these will now hand his piece of meat to the other and promises to help him in everything, and in future to look upon him as his brother. Each eats the meat smeared with the blood of the other, and the ceremony is finished. Chieftainship. The Wa-Sania are governed by one principal chief, and chiefs over each clan, the former beina a member of the Gamada clan. On the death of the chief the chieftainship will descend to his eldest brother, or to his eldest son if he has no brother. If the chief is a minor the elders will elect a man to look after affairs until he becomes a man. A chief is assisted in his councils by his elders, but it is he who finally gives a decision on any matter. The successor to chieftainship will take over his duties at the first waning of the moon after the death of the former chief. On this day he wears a kitamtbi cloth from his waist to his ankles, a dark cloth over his shoulders and a white turban round his head; in his right hand he carries a kilunqdu of honey beer. A bullock is killed by him with his own hand and a feast and dance held. All present eat of the meat, but the youno men and children do not dance or drink beer. The dancing is done by the old men and the women. Miscellaneous. The Wa-Sania year starts in April and consists of twelve months, divided up into three periods of four months each. The 1st period is called Gunn. 2nd ,, ,, Adolaia. 3rd ,, ,, Huggaie. Count is kept of the days by making a notch in a stick for each day. When the month is finished the stick is placed aside and a fresh one started. Time is calculated by the sun. A rainbow is called Uleh TVakat, which means God's bow. When an eclipse of the moon occurs they say it has fallen into water, and on these occasions the women dance until it reappears again; during an eclipse of the moon men do not cohabit with women. Blood of a human being accidentally shed is covered up with earth, as it is considered to bring bad luck to others who look at it. If a person sneezes many times it is said that someone is saying evil things of D 2</page><page sequence="17">36 CAPTAIN W. E. H. BARRETT.-NOteS on the Customs and the sneezer; if a person sneezes only once it is believed that someone is speaking well of him. A person is said to yawn because he is either sleepy or hungry. The Wa-Sania most strongly object to being counted, as they believe that one of those who were counted would die shortly afterwards. The Wa-Sania say that God first made one man who lived for a long time alone. At one period of his existence there was darkness for seven days, and towards the end of these days the man, feeling very lonely, called out and beseeched God to bring him a companion; having called on God he stretched out his hand and felt soniething lying near him, and on the eighth day when the darkness passed away he saw that God had brought him a woman to be his mate. People are not allowed to cross over each other's shadows. They consider it is a bad thing to step over the body of a sleeping person, as if the latter is sick the same sickness will lay hold of the one who steps over the sleeper and vice versd. Nails are kept short to prevent them from splitting. Pieces cut off from the nails are buried in the ground on the spot where they were cut, as they say that these pieces are portions of their bodies. If a person loses any part of his body, such as an arm or a leg, it is buried in the ground, but without rites. When a child loses its milk teeth it will stand up in the village with its leg,s apart, and taking the teeth in its hand will bend downr, and throw the teeth between its legs and say " go to the place we both came from when I was born." When a man spits he will cover the spittle up with earth. When spittle accidentally falls oni another person it is said to be a sign that the two people are friendly disposed towards one another. If an earthquake occurs the Wa-Sania hold a dance and much beer is drunk by the men and women; a fire is lighted and iuban scent is placed on it as an offering to appease the anger of Lafatamunuk, a supposed devil, who is said to live in the centre of the earth; they say that unless this offering is made a famine will occur. They say that thunder is caused by God running along the tops of the clouds and shaking the dried skin of some immense animal. They believe that God's wife at times waves her arms about and that lightning is the glint from the ornaments worn on them. Before he enters the married state a man is not permitted to grow a beard. Men shave the hair round their private parts and women pull out the hair growing there. Wa-Sania always keep the hair of their heads fairly short. Wa-Sania do not make any iron implements. Knives and arrow-heads are bought from Swahilis and others. There are two or three permanent villages inhabited by the Wa-Sania, but as. a rule they do not build permanent huts. Their habitations are small, round in shape, and made of grass and boughs. Wa-Sania do not trade amongst themselves, but with the Wa-Giriama, Swahilis and other people, exchanging ivory and rubber for rupees or food. Formerly cotton cloth passed for money among them, but now they all know</page><page sequence="18">Beliefs of the Wa-Giriama, etc., British East Africa. 37 the value of the rupee. They are as a rule most generous to each other, and one person obtaining inoney usually keeps only a portion for himself, and divides the remainder up amongst his relations and friends. The Wa-Sania believe that formerly human beings did not die until one day a lizard (Diblehl) appeared and said to them, " All of you know that the moon dies and rises again, but human beings will die and rise no more." They say that from that day human beings commenced to die. They say that formerly the Wa-Sania did not marry until one day one of their elders, calling a meeting of the tribe, pointed out to them that they were like animals, knowing no father or mother. The matter was discussed by those present and they decided to marry. They say that originally they always ate meat raw, until a woman on going to gather firewood found a dead rhinoceros which had killed itself by running on to a stake; near the carcass she saw a fire, and cutting off some flesh from the dead beast, cooked and ate it. From that day the tribe started cooking meat. Originally all the tribes of the earth are said to have known only one language, but during a severe famine everyone went mad and wandered in all directions, jabbering strange words, and thus the different languages started. Fairy Tales. One day a small sea bird was hopping about close to the sea when the tide was on the ebb, picking up food, it was accosted by an elephant who asked it what it was doing. " Oh," said the bird, " can't you see I am drinking water; if you wait a bit you will observe that the sea gets less." The elephant waited for a while and saw that the water gradually receded from the shore. Before he left, the bird said, " Come back to-morrow and I will be sick and throw out all the water from my stomach," at the same time mentioning, an hour at which it knew that the tide would be on the flow. At the appointed time the two met near the shore, and the bird flying to the edge of the sea alighted and commenced hopping about pretending to be sick the whole time, and the elephant marvelling greatly, saw the water gradually increase. After a time the bird turning to the elephant said, " Yesterday you saw that I who am so small and insignificant was able to drink a large quantity of water. Surely you who are so immenise will be able to drink the sea dry! " The elephant, not wishing to be outdone by a small bird, started drinking the salt water, and -in a short time died from the effects. The bird then flew off' laughing at the elephant's foolishness. (2.) One day a lion went to his friend the hare, whom he knew to be very clever, and told him that unless he could catch some game to eat he would shortly die of hunger. The hare said to him, " I will invite a number of animals to come here I It is usually the lizard who brings this message where the myth is found, the chameleon having been previously sent to announce the men will revive.-G. W.</page><page sequence="19">38 CAPTAIN W. E. H. BARRETT.-Notes on the Custonis and for a dance, but first of all I must bury you in the sand." The lion agreed, and the hare, having first buried him, went out and asked several animals to come and join in a dance he was giving; some of them accepted his invitation and followed him to a spot near where the lion lay buried. When the assembled guests were busy dancing the lion rose up from his place of concealment anld killed as many as he wanted. Having thanked the hare for his assistance he commenced to satisfy his hunger. (3.) Very many years ago fire and water were friends. One day, however, a fire was sitting near some water, when the latter rose up and extinguished it. From that day to this fire has been afraid of water, and avoids going near it if possible. (4.) Once during a drought all the beasts of the jungle met together to consider what steps they should take to get water. All agreed that they would help to dig a large well, except the hare, who was lazy, and did not want to work. The other animals were very anary, and told him that if he would not assist them he would not be allowed to drink from their well. The hare replied that if he wanted water he could always get it. When the well was completed, the hare, who was very thirsty, taking, with him a pot of honey, proceeded to the well, where he saw a young elephant keeping guard. On seeing him the elephant asked him for some honey; the hare replied, " I will give you honey if you will allow me to drink, but as I am afraid you will catch me when I am drinking, you nmust first of all let me tie up your hind legs." The elephant agreed, and the hare having securely fastened his hind legs, gave himi a little honiey. He then proceeded to drink as much water as he wanted; having done this he threw earth into the water and made it as dirty as possible. The elephant was very angry but could do nothing as his legs were tied. In the evening the aninmals came to drink and found him still tied up, and the water filthy. The young elephant's father was very angry, and beat his son severely for allowing himself to be fooled by their colmmon enemy the hare. The following day the. lion was left in charge, but he, too, was unable to resist the honey cunningly offered him by the hare, and allowed himself to be tied up, and the animals coming for their evening drink found him lying helpless, and the water as dirty as before. On the third day the elephant ordered a turtle to conceal himself in the water, and if the hare came to drink to seize hold of him. About mid-day the hare came to the well, aild satisfying himself that nobody was about, went down to drink. As soon as he put his paw into the water the turtle seized it in his mouth and held on tightly until the evenirng. When the elephant arrived he laughed loudly on seeing that his ruse had succeeded, and at last the wily hare had been caught. He then started off to get some rope with which to tie the captive up. The hare, however, said, " Don't bother to go and get rope, there are plenty of banana trees here, tie me up with strips taken from their leaves." The</page><page sequence="20">Beliefs of the Wa-Giriama, etc. British East Africa. 39 elephant did so, and leaving the hare lying in the sun went off to search for a stick with which to beat him. While he was away the sun rapidly dried up the leaves with which the hare was bound and made them so brittle that he was able to break them without much effort, and he ran off. When the elephant returned he found that his captive had disappeared. (5.) Many years ago a dispute arose amongst all the animals and reptiles as to who should be king over themi. After a lot of talk it was arranged that they should all start from a certain spot and race to a fallen tree trunk, which they all knew of in the' forest. When they had assembled at the starting-point the chameleon climrbed up a bush just behind the waterbuck and seized hold of its tail. On the word being given to start, the waterbuck dashed off, easily reached the winning-post first, an(d turned round to laugh at the others, whereupon the chameleon jumped on the tree trunk and called out, "Why are you laughing, can't you see that I am here before you ?' The waterbuck turning round, to his amazeinent found the chameleon sitting on the winning-post. He, however, acknowledged that he was beaten and the chameleon was appointed king. (6.) A lion who lived near a small forest bird called Nduindu was continually laughing at the latter, who he said had a feeble voice. This annoyed the Ndundu, who one day told the lion that when he proceeded to hunt game the next day he would accompany him and arranged with him that immediately the lion killed anything they would both cry out, and their respective wives on hearing their husband's call would cook their dinners. That evening the Ndundu called together all his relations, and arranged with them that when he and the lion went off to hunt the following day, they should fly after them and distribute themselves along the way, so that when he called out, the one nearest him would be able to hear, and call out to the next and so on until his wife heard the cry. The next morning the lion and Ndundu went off, and, ulnknown to the formner, were followed by the latter's relations. After travelling, a long distance, the lion killed a zebra and at once emitted three terrific roars; the Ndundu also chirped three times, and the chirps were heard by his relations nearest him, who passed it on, until his wife hearing the cry, cooked her husband's dinner. When the lion had satisfied his hunger he and his companions went home. On their arrival they found that the Ndundu's wife had prepared her husband's dinner, but the lioness had prepared none. The lion was very angry and scolded his wife, who replied that she had not heard him roar or she would have cooked food for him. The Ndundu's wife, however, said she had heard her husband's call a long while ago, and on hearing it had started preparing the food. The lion was very annoyed to find, as he imagined, that the Ndundu's voice was louder than his, but in the future did not aggravate the bird by laughing at him.</page></plain_text>
