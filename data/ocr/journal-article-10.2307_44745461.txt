Copyright © 2003 SAE International ABSTRACT This study presents an efficient method for forensic engineers to determine the maximum forward head, hip and knee velocities of automobile occupants who are restrained by seat belts during frontal impacts. The ratios of the peak head, hip and knee velocities as a function of the impact speed change were determined from a combination of previous research data. The time and location at which the peak velocities occur are also presented. In addition, the head velocity profile as a function of head displacement was quantified for the lap and torso restraint case. The compiled head, hip and knee velocities may be utilized in order to assess seat belt usage and benefit. The results of this study may be referenced to aid in modeling the motion of vehicle occupants in frontal impacts for a range of impact severities. INTRODUCTION The head, hip and knee displacement of restrained occupants in frontal collisions was previously presented by Araszewski, et al. [1, 2]. These previous studies derived relations for the occupant's head, hip, and knee displacement as a function of impact speed change. This current study has allowed the peak velocity of the head, hip, and knees of a restrained occupant to also be quantified as a function of impact speed change. The results presented here are based on data from previous impact test studies. The main emphasis for this research study was to determine the ratio of the maximum head, hip and knee velocity as a function of the impact speed change. Other objectives were to identify at what position during the head, hip and knee displacement the maximum velocity occurred. In addition, the time at which the maximum velocity occurred with respect to the peak head, hip and knee displacement time duration was determined when the available data permitted. All of the presented head, hip, and knee velocities were referenced with respect to the vehicle interior. As a secondary comparison, the characteristic differences of lap and torso (3-point) seat belts were compared to those of lap only (2-point) seat belts. Unfortunately, data was limited for the occupants restrained by lap only seat belts. In order for forensic engineers to technically assess if an occupant in a motor vehicle collision was restrained by the available seat belt assembly, the occupant motion must be determined and modeled. However, if the benefit of seat belt usage is also to be determined, then the restrained case must be compared to the unrestrained case. This study condenses data available from various research publications that document restrained occupant head, hip and knee kinematics during frontal impact tests. A range of test geometries and seat belt configurations were considered. Correlations between the impact severity and the maximum resulting head, hip and knee velocities, with respect to the vehicle interior, were developed and are presented. The results of this study may be referenced in conjunction with previous research studies by Araszewski, et al. [1, 2] that provides a means to determine the maximum amount of head, hip and knee displacements expected by a restrained occupant in a frontal collision. This study allows the peak contact velocity between the occupant and the vehicle interior to be technically determined for frontal impacts at various impact severities. Thus, the body motion of restrained occupants may be more thoroughly modeled. REVIEW OF LITERATURE The velocity profiles of the various components of the occupant body would most ideally be determined by conducting extensive crash testing with randomly selected human subjects in various vehicles. Clearly, this type of testing is not feasible; therefore, data from published impact tests were reviewed and amalgamated for this current study. 866</page><page sequence="2">There are numerous published studies available [3-20] which discuss the kinematics of restrained occupants in impact tests; a thorough review of this literature was conducted. Of the numerous studies that discuss the occupant kinematics of restrained subjects, many of the studies provided discussion and quantification of the head displacement or velocity. Fewer of these studies quantified the amount of hip displacement or velocity of restrained occupants in frontal impacts. Only a limited number of these studies quantified the amount of knee displacement or velocity of restrained occupants involved in frontal impacts. For the purpose of this study, the literature that quantified the head, hip and knee velocities of restrained occupants involved in frontal impacts were referenced. In the referenced studies, most of the subjects were restrained by lap and torso (3-point) seat belts, which is typical of seat belts installed in production type automobiles. Some limited data was available for subjects restrained by lap only (2-point) seat belts. The referenced data utilized a variety of test subjects, including anthropometric test devices (ATD or dummies) and human male subjects. The ATD that were tested included: Part 572, Hybrid II, and Hybrid III dummies. The human subjects that were tested ranged in size and stature. The seat belt types included fixed anchorage point seat belts and fixed/retractable seat belt assembly mechanisms. METHODS The head, hip and knee velocity data were separately analyzed in order to observe trends and relations within each data set. Although there was sufficient head velocity data to conduct statistical analyses, segments of the hip and knee velocity data was limited; thus, only some specific trends could be identified for the hip and knee velocity profiles. In order to easily apply these results for accident reconstruction purposes, ratios of the velocity parameters were pursued over a range of impact speeds. Since the data sets varied over a range of impact speed changes, easy comparison of the available data was made possible by analyzing the peak head velocity, with respect to the vehicle interior, as a ratio of the impact speed change. In addition, since the time duration of the occupant displacement varied between the tests, the time comparison was also conducted by analyzing the time at which the maximum velocity occurred as a ratio of the total time duration of occupant displacement. Analysis of the displacement relation with respect to velocity was also conducted by considering the position of the head when it achieved maximum velocity as ratios of the maximum forward and total peak head displacements. The specific ratios were defined as: rp 1 ~~ V (max) rp 1 RATIO ~~ (-1) Di PEAK ! v T/ _ (max) V RATIO _ - Av (2) p fļ ^ Forward iy max) ** Oratio ~ ~j (3) " Forward {PEAK } n _ d D(V max) , 4 RATIO _ - (4) , 4 " PEAK Where: T/mtïo is the time ratio, tV(max) is the time at maximum (head, hip or knee) velocity, tD(PEAK) is the total time to peak displacement, V ratio is the velocity ratio, V(max) is the maximum (head, hip or knee) velocity, Av is the impact speed change, FDrajto is the forward displacement ratio, dForward(Vmax) is the forward (head, hip or knee) displacement distance at maximum (head, hip or knee) velocity, dForward(PEAK) is the maximum forward (head, hip or knee) displacement distance, DraT10 is the total displacement ratio, dD(Vmax) is the total (head, hip or knee) displacement distance at maximum velocity, dFEAK is the total peak (head, hip or knee) displacement distance. The referenced data was selected to represent occupant displacement tests that did not involve occupant contact with vehicle interiors. This was necessary to ensure that the referenced test data was not affected by external forces applied to the occupants head, hips, or knees. An example of the typical occupant displacement with lap and torso seat belt restraint is shown in Figure 1 . Figure 1 - Typical Head, Hip and Knee Displacement with Lap and Torso Restraint 867</page><page sequence="3">RESULTS HEAD VELOCITY PROFILE WITH LAP AND TORSO SEAT BELT RESTRAINT The characteristics of the head velocity profile were determined from a total of seven different studies, incorporating 29 tests. The impact speed changes of the tests ranged from 21 to 60 km/h (5.8 to 16.7 m/s) and were conducted with a range of impact configurations using human and ATD subjects. The data of head velocity ratios as a function of impact speed change is illustrated in Figure A1 of Appendix A. Table 1 summarizes the statistical relations between the considered ratios. The head velocity data indicates that on average, the head of a lap and torso restrained occupant achieves a peak velocity (with respect to the vehicle interior) of 66% of the impact speed change. This peak velocity occurs after the head has been displaced 62% of its total displacement. The peak head velocity also corresponds to a position of 71% of the forward head displacement. Table 1 - Ratios of head velocity profiles with lap and torso seat belt restraint The complete head velocity profile as a function of total displacement is only available for a limited number of impact tests. However, general trends can be derived from the available data. The head velocity, relative to the vehicle interior, is initially zero. The head velocity then peaks at the position that corresponds to the total displacement ratio. In addition, the head velocity can be 1 Time Ratio = Time at maximum velocity / Total time 2 Velocity Ratio = Maximum velocity / Impact speed change 3 Forward Displacement Ratio = Forward displacement at maximum velocity / Maximum forward displacement 4 Total Displacement Ratio = Total displacement at maximum velocity / Total peak displacement 5 SD = standard deviation defined by a 2nd order polynomial that passes through the origin, but is only valid until peak head displacement is achieved. To solve mathematically, let the head velocity profile be defined using constants A and B as follows: v = Ad 2 + Bd (5) Where v is the head velocity in [m/s], d is the head displacement in [m]; A and B are constant coefficients that can be determined by differentiating and setting constraints (di and v2). ^=0 =&gt;&lt;/=-*. &lt;6&gt; dd 2 A dl = (P RATIO^ PEAK ^ V2 ~ ty RATIO ^ dpEAK(head) = 0-027 Av +0.14 (9) Where dPEAK(head) is the typical peak head displacement in [m] and Av is the impact speed change in [m/s]. Dratio is the total head displacement ratio and Vratio is the head velocity ratio. It is noted that equations 7 and 8 are constraints derived from this study while equation 9 is a parameter obtained from the maximum head displacement study [1]. Using the above equations, the A and B coefficients can be determined. A (F RATIO [(ß«4™X»-»27Av+0.14)r &lt;10) ß 2 (V ratio (-j-j) (A«™X0-027AV + 0.14) Thus, the A and B coefficients can be solved in terms of the impact speed change, in addition to the head velocity ratio and the total head displacement ratio. Therefore, for a known impact speed change, the head velocity profile can be determined in terms of the head displacement. Table 2 provides the calculated A and B coefficients for a range of impact speed changes with total head displacement and head velocity ratios of 0.62 and 0.66, respectively. 868 ■ (Tratio) Ratio1 Time a 0 Velocity (VraTIO) Ratio2 Head (FDrątio) Forward Ratio3 Displ.

Figures B1 through B4 are test data reproduced from Patrick [3], Viano [4], Biss [16], and Shimamura [9], respectively. Also illustrated on the figures in Appendix B are the head velocity profiles that were mathematically derived from this study and defined by equations 5 through 1 1 . It can be seen that the mathematical model tends to slightly under-predict the head velocity at the initial phase of head movement, but appears to be a reasonable model to approximate the average head velocity profile with respect to the head trajectory path. HIP VELOCITY PROFILE WITH LAP AND TORSO SEAT BELT RESTRAINT The characteristics of the hip velocity profile were determined from three different studies, incorporating 20 data sets. The impact speed changes of the tests ranged from 21 to 35 km/h (5.8 to 9.7 m/s) and were conducted with varying impact configurations using human and ATD subjects. In a frontal impact where an occupant is restrained by a lap and torso seat belt, the occupant's entire body moves forward until resisted by the seat belt assembly. The occupant's hips, or H-point, tend to move forward and downward in a relatively linear path. The occupant's hip motion is restricted as the lap portion of the seat belt webbing stretches and opposes the load forces. The data of hip velocity ratios as a function of impact speed change is illustrated in Figure A3 of Appendix A. Table 3 summarizes the statistical relations between the considered ratios for hip velocity. Table 3 - Ratios of hip velocity profiles with lap and torso seat belt restraint The hip velocity data indicates that on average, the hip of a properly restrained occupant achieves a peak velocity (with respect to the vehicle interior) of 35% of the impact speed change. This peak velocity occurs after the hip has been displaced 84% of the total hip displacement. The peak hip velocity also corresponds to a position of 78% of the forward hip displacement. There was insufficient hip velocity data available to determine the typical velocity profile for the hip movement or derive a mathematical relation for the hip velocity trajectory. KNEE VELOCITY PROFILE WITH LAP AND TORSO SEAT BELT RESTRAINT The characteristics of the knee velocity profile were determined from only one study, incorporating 18 data sets. The impact speed changes of the tests were nominally about 24 km/h (6.7 m/s) and were conducted using human subjects. The data of knee velocity ratios as a function of impact speed change is illustrated in Figure A5 of Appendix A. Table 4 summarizes the statistical relations between the considered ratios for knee velocity. Due to a lack of data, only the relation between the knee velocity and the impact speed change could be determined from the data sets; the ratio of time and displacement could not be assessed as data was not available. Additional data, similar to that of the head trajectory data, would be required for the knee trajectory; unfortunately, the referenced studies did not provide this data. The knee velocity data indicates that on average, the knee of a properly restrained occupant achieves a peak velocity (with respect to the vehicle interior) of 33% of the impact speed change. There was no data available to determine where along the displacement trajectory that the peak knee velocity occurred. 6 n/a = Insufficient data available 869 Impact Speed A B Change [mV] [s'1] [m/s] 6 -113.0 42.3 7 -111.0 45.3 8 -108.4 47.8 9 -105.3 50.0 10 -102.1 51.9 1 1 -98.9 53.6 12 -95.7 55.1 13 -92.6 56.4 ■ Timo Ratio Velocity Ratio Hip Forward Displ.

Additional data and/or testing would be beneficial to determine the time and displacement ratios for the knee trajectories and characteristics. However, trends for the knee trajectories may be derived from the hip data characteristics; this is further discussed in the discussion section of this paper. HEAD, HIP, AND KNEE VELOCITY PROFILES WITH LAP BELT RESTRAINT In addition to the lap and torso restraint systems, some vehicles still in current use are equipped with lap seat belts in some seating positions. The available data was analyzed in order to compare the lap and torso restraint with the lap only restraint systems. The lap only restraint data was more limited than the available lap and torso restraint system data. Moreover, the lap only restraint system data was obtained from only two studies, one that utilized human male subjects while the other study used test dummies that were very rudimentary by current standards. Thus, the presented lap only restraint data is purely intended to provide a general overview. Additional data is required to develop more accurate trends, specifically for the head velocity ratio as resulting from lap only restraint usage. The ratios of the peak head, hip and knee velocities compared to the impact speed change while using lap only restraint was calculated and is tabulated in Table 5. The limited data suggest that the peak head velocities achieved with lap only restraint was on average equivalent to 80% of the impact speed change. Both the peak hip and knee velocities achieved with lap only restraint was on average equivalent to 35% of the impact speed change. It is noted that the hip and knee results for the lap only cases were similar and consistent with the results derived from the lap and torso seat belt restraint data. Table 5 - Ratios of Head, Hip, and Knee Velocity Profiles with Lap Belt Restraint The head, hip and knee velocity ratio data with lap only restraint are appended and presented in Figures A2, A4, and A6, respectively. DISCUSSION The results presented in this study were derived from impact test data with occupants restrained by lap and torso seat belt assemblies and lap only restraint systems. If an occupant is unrestrained, then there is no significant energy loss from the occupant until interior contact occurs; thus, the peak head, hip and knee velocities will approximately correspond to the impact speed change. If seat belt restraint is utilized, then a portion of the kinetic energy is removed from the occupant. The peak velocity data indicates that proper usage of the lap and torso seat belt will significantly reduce the peak velocities achieved by the head, hip, and knees in a frontal impact. The results of this study provide a numeric relation between the impact speed change and the resultant peak head, hip and knee velocities for restrained occupants. The results are derived from data from a variety of sources that utilize various test configurations over a range of impact speed changes. Since there is some variance associated with the referenced data and thus also the model, discretion must be used when applying the data to specific impact scenarios. The available knee velocity data was limited due to a lack of sufficient test data; however, the available knee data yielded similar results as the available hip velocity data. These results are consistent with the geometry and displacement expected from the knee and hip of a restrained occupant. As the hip and knee joints can be modeled as being linked by a relatively rigid linkage bar and since the resultant displacement is relatively linear [2], the resulting hip and knee velocity profiles are likely dependent on one another. Therefore, the knee velocity data may be extrapolated from the hip velocity data when addition reference is required. 870 Average 0.33 SD 0.05 Maximum 0.41 Minimum 0.25 Samples 18 Head Hip Knee ESKigcgg Velocity Velocity Velocity Ratio Ratio Ratio Average 0.80 0.35 0.35 SD 0.11 0.08 0.04 Maximum 1.16 0.52 0.43 Minimum 0.65 0.27 0.28 Samples 15 15 14</page><page sequence="6">Comparison of resulting hip and knee velocities from lap only seat belt configurations suggests that the findings of this study may also be applied to lap only seat belt cases. Seat belt studies by Shimamura et al. [9] suggests that the lap and torso portions of the seat belt are independently loaded during impact and thus may be considered to be independent of one another. Chandler, et al. [7], conducted sled tests with subjects restrained by lap and torso seat belts and lap only seat belts. The knee and hip velocities resulting from the two different seat belt configurations were consistent and similar with one another. It is also noted that there was no discernable difference between the resulting displacements of the knees and hips when restrained by lap and torso seat belts and lap only seat belts at similar impact speed changes. Since the presence of the torso portion of the seat belt had no detectable effect on the knee or hip motion, the Chandler data may also suggest that the torso and lap portions of the seat belt act independently of one another when restraining the hip and knee motion of an occupant. Therefore, the hip and knee relations presented in this study are likely applicable for both lap and torso and lap only seat belt configurations. This finding is consistent with the knee displacement study [2] that concluded that there is no distinctive difference between the knee displacement for the 3-point and 2-point restraint cases at a particular impact speed change. The similarities and consistencies between the hip and knee velocity ratios with the lap and torso restraint and lap only restraint are illustrated in Figures A7 and A8. Figures A7 and A8 are presented in Appendix A and show that there is no clear distinction between the two seat belt restraint types for the considered velocity ratios. Since the displacements are similar and the velocity ratios are similar, it may be appropriate to consider that the knee velocity and hip velocity versus displacement profiles are also similar. As expected, there is a significant difference in the resulting head velocity when lap and torso or lap only restraint systems are considered. It is also noted that for only one test with lap restraint, the peak head velocity was greater than the impact speed change. This test utilized an Alderson test dummy. It is noted that the Alderson test dummy did not model the human kinematics as accurately as modern test dummies; this may be the source of the discrepancy that was observed with the head velocity ratio for the lap only restraint. The human test data suggests that the head velocity is reduced by the lap belt; however, the test dummy results suggest that the head velocity is increased due to the rotational effect of the lap only restraint. This effect was also noted in a study by Daniel, et al. [20], in which it is suggested that the head velocity may surpass the impact speed change if only a lap seat belt is used. This discrepancy is also commented on within the study by Chandler, et al. [7], and may be due to the specific test dummy used for the studies. It appears that the increased head velocity may be attributed to the early generation test dummy which did not replicate the human motion as accurately as current test dummies. However, more data is required to verify this effect on the head velocity when lap only restraint is used. CONCLUSIONS This study amalgamated data from various research studies that investigated head, hip and knee velocities of occupants restrained by lap and torso (3-point) seat belts and lap only (2-point) seat belts during frontal impacts. These velocities were referenced with respect to the vehicle interior. Relationships between the head, hip and knee velocities as a ratio of the impact speed change were determined. The derived relationships considered both lap and torso restraint and lap only restraint. These results can be used to compare the peak velocities of the occupant when restrained and compared to the impact speed change. In addition, the head velocity profile as a function of head displacement was quantified for the lap and torso restraint case. Therefore, these velocity relationships will provide secondary information for accident reconstruction applications when the benefits of seat belt restraint are assessed. RECOMMENDATIONS It is recommended that future seat belt studies continue to consider various test parameters and configurations over a range of impact speed changes and impact directions. It is also recommended that further research consider the influence of occupant stature and weight to be studied. In addition, a larger set of test data may provide supplementary insight.
