Yet a simple and straightforward introduction to the subject is hard to come by, due especially to confusion over the issue of materialism versus idealism. The following is a meth- odological primer in the dialectic of capital, a Marxian economic theory dialectically stated. Just as Hegel's "logic coincided with metaphysics," Marx's "coincides with economics." ECONOMIC THEORY CONSTITUTES a dialec- tical, not an axiomatic, system. Although some important features of the dialectic have already been discussed else- where, a more systematic treatment of the subject, specifically of the Hegelian-Marxian version of the dialectic, may be in order. Of course, many explanations of this type of dialectic are available in Marxist lit- erature, but unfortunately not all of them are dependable. In fact, some of them are more misleading than informative. Part of the difficulty stems from the fact that a dialectic cannot be explained generally, or in the abstract, since it is not a strictly formal (abstract-general) logic but rather a formal-substantive (concrete-synthetic) one. It, in other words, constitutes a teleological rather than a tautological system. In a dialectical exposition we often talk of proceeding from abstract to con- crete. This means that we advance from an emptier and less specified concept to a more "enriched" and specified one. Here "concrete" does not mean "concrete-empirical" or "concrete-historical"; it means 434</page><page sequence="2">DIALECTICS OF CAPITAL 435 "concrete-synthetic" in the sense of "containing more specifications of the subject" Perhaps it is useful to begin with the three fundamental character- istics of the Hegelian-Marxian dialectic: 1) it believes that "the truth is the whole"; 2) it claims the identity of the subject and the object; 3) it proceeds by synthesizing "contradictions" through the triad of thesis, antithesis and synthesis. The first two characteristics refer to the struc- ture of the dialectic, and the third to its procedural aspect. We know from our daily experience that a partial story is ulti- mately undependable. Only an unwise parent tries to settle a dispute between children on the basis of one party's tattle-taling. In order to be fair, he or she must listen to both parties concerned, and "synthe- size" the whole story. A law court operates on the same principle. It does not pronounce its verdict until it believes it has been informed of "the whole truth" with regard to the case. Although human errors are unavoidable and the court oftentimes comes to a wrong decision on the basis of inconclusive evidence, it does not, in principle, ac- cept tentative conjectures or refutable (falsifiable) hypotheses. The reason is simple. We know that for something to be really true, it must be absolutely or conclusively established to be true. A tentative hy- pothesis which we conventionally accept for the time being, "relative to the present state of our knowledge," does not qualify as the real truth. The dialectic takes the same view in its logical synthesis of an entire story. It does not accept a conclusion based on tentative as- sumptions, hypotheses or conjectures. The result of a dialectical inves- tigation must, in other words, stand on its own without depending on any axiom or postulate. The subject matter, or the object of study, must be made "self-explanatory" within the system in the sense that it leaves no unknowable or unexplainable "thing-in-itself." The logic ofthat system must, therefore, be inherent in it rather than imposed on it from the outside. That sort of self-explaining system is what Hegel called the "concrete logical idea." To bring out this character, I would say that the dialectic is "autobiographical." An autobiographi- cal story can be told on'y from within, and not from without. Since the dialectic is autobiographical, it must have a story-teller or a subject It is important to identify who is telling us the story. In the case of Hegel, the Absolute (God or the Christian logos) is the subject of the dialectic; in the case of Marx, it is capital. This important point</page><page sequence="3">436 SCIENCE àf SOCIETY is often overlooked by Marxian materialists. In their eagerness to "abol- ish" Hegel's idealist concept of the Absolute, they do not stop to think what materialist subject they should put in its place. Engels, Lenin and the whole school of "dialectical materialists" put Nature (or matter) in place of the Absolute without much reflection. But their project, as it turned out, was a complete non-starter. It had to fail because Nature (or matter) does not come forward to tell us its own story. Since it is not "autobiographical," a dialectic of Nature (or of matter) is an im- possibility. Nature passively sits out there and waits to be scrutinized, dissected, analyzed and described by us from the outside. A dialectical subject must originate in human beings, yet it must also transcend us. Hegel's Absolute satisfies both conditions. For, as Feuer- bach claimed, the Absolute is nothing but the "infinitization (or absolu tization)" of human virtues. We human beings are good, wise, powerful, etc., only to some extent, and never infinitely or absolutely so. If, however, these desirable human characteristics are "infinitized" or "absolutized" in our mind, we can conceive of God, or the Abso- lute. Thus instead of God creating us in his image, we, human be- ings, create God in our image. This is Feuerbach's well-known thesis of anthropomorphism. In this light, it is readily understandable why God privileges us, i.e., human beings, as his agents. He must reveal himself through us. We, human beings, for our part, understand the nature (logic) of the Absolute {i.e., the divine wisdom or Reason) because it is nothing but the extrapolation of our own "essence." The religious teaching that God always gives us his grace and allows us to comprehend his intentions and designs is expressed "philosophi- cally," in the case of Hegel, by the thesis that the Absolute reveals itself completely to our finite reason. We do not create Nature or matter by "self-idealization," i.e., by the process of infinitization of our own virtues. Nature, therefore, has no teleology to reveal to us. We can never know it completely. We can only gain partial knowledge of its behavior by constantly observ- ing it from the outside. Nature does not privilege us by selecting us as its agent and letting us play out its logic. Although we belong to Nature, we have not created it. Consequently, we cannot see its logic from the inside, nor can we grasp it as a totality, i.e., as a "concrete logical idea." The "thing-in-itself " of Nature always remains beyond our reach. In other words, Nature or matter cannot be the subject of</page><page sequence="4">DIALECTICS OF CAPITAL 437 a materialist dialectic. If so, what else can the subject of a materialis- tic dialectic be? My answer is that it can be "capital." Capital originates in our own "economic motives," even though it transcends us because in it these human traits are already "made infi- nite and absolute." Through the creation of capital our economic motives are "one-dimensionalized." Since, however, capital is obtained by our own "self-idealization," we comprehend it completely. All we have to do is to ask ourselves what we would do, if we pursued our own "eco- nomic" goals single-mindedly at the expense of all other considerations, i.e., if we behaved as mere "bearers of economic categories." In fact, that is how we learn the basics of economic theory. The present claim is equivalent to saying that capital, as the dialectical subject, reveals itself to us totally. Since capital is a product of our "self-idealization," it con- tains nothing that we cannot really comprehend. The identity of the subject and the object is the immediate con- sequence of this fact. In the dialectic, capital tells us its own story. Having transcended us and our limitations, capital now possesses its own identity separate from us. It has become the object, in the sense that it has gone beyond our finite subjectivity. Yet we can fully under- stand how capital "thinks" because its "logic" is only an extended version of our own thought. In other words, we are privy to the sub- jectivity of capital. Our finite subjectivity and capital's infinite sub- jectivity are different, and yet they are connected by what Marx called the "force of abstraction" (Marx, 1958, 8). By being "subsumed" under capital and becoming its agent, we can think like capital. It is interesting to recall that "logic coincides with metaphysics" according to Hegel (Wallace, 1975, 36). All metaphysical categories represent characteristics of the Absolute, i.e., purified human nature. The dialectic of the Absolute explains them in a logical order. We can similarly claim that "logic coincides with economics," meaning that all economic categories represent characteristics of capital, i.e., our economic motives "made infinite." In other words, the dialectic of capital is economic theory, and nothing else can be. Economic theory must, therefore, expose the logic or capital completely. The method of this complete exposition is the dialectic which proceeds by the triadic steps of thesis, antithesis and synthesis. A dialectical system is a self-definition in the sense that the subject of the dialectic defines (specifies) itself completely. The definition,</page><page sequence="5">438 SCIENCE &amp; SOCIETY however, cannot be completed at one fell swoop. Instead the subject must be defined and redefined a great number of times, as we go through the many layers of its existence. As the level of discussion proceeds from abstract to concrete, the same concept returns many times, and each time it becomes more specified. The process ends only when it is fully synthesized or completely specified, all its layers being exposed. The easiest way to understand the nature of this method is to think of how a painter works on a portrait. When he first begins with a few broad outlines, it is hard to recognize whose picture is being created. As he gradually adds details, however, the resemblance to the person who is sitting for him becomes increasingly clear. When the picture is completed, there is no longer any doubt as to whose portrait has been painted. Even in the first few of his bold brush strokes, however, the painter presupposes (has in his mind) the end result. He is aware that the spaces which he now leaves empty will be filled with elaborate detail in due course. In synthesizing something dialectically, we proceed in the same way. First we begin with broad contours, which pre-assign the spaces into which further details (or specifications) will be introduced later. Let us, at this point, consider the famous Hegelian triad of "being, naught and becoming." The following illustration may clarify the dialectical meaning of "contradiction" and its synthesis. Suppose that I ask a friend of mine the question: "Have you got a child?" If the answer is 'Yes, I have one" (being) and "No, I have none" (non-being) at the same time, it is contradictory in the formal-logical sense. Either my friend is mentally confused or he does not seriously want to an- swer my question. Obviously such a contradiction cannot be synthe- sized, overcome or resolved. For it is not a dialectical contradiction. Yet many self-appointed exponents of the dialectic come forward with the false exegesis that precisely this elusiveness illustrates what Hegel calls "becoming." That most decidedly is not the case. When the friend answers my query with 'Yes, I have" (being) , he has not yet specified his child at all. The child may, therefore, be a boy or a girl, a one-year old infant or an uncontrollable teenager, a whiz kid or mentally retarded, i.e., anything that a child can be. It is this absence of any specification that is called "nothing" or "naught." Indeed, without any further information other than merely that he exists, the child means absolutely "nothing" to me. If I were to open</page><page sequence="6">DIALECTICS OF CAPITAL 439 his file, it would remain totally blank, except for a hypothetical name that I may decide to give him for convenience. Yet I cannot ignore the fact that there is a child in my friend's family. This constitutes the dialectical contradiction. "Becoming" means, in the present case, that I may ask more questions and begin to complete a meaningful file of the child, or I may simply forget about it. I am formally free to let the child "come to be" or "pass away." Since, from a formal point of view, there is no compelling reason for me to opt for either of the two alternatives, the state of "becoming" is said to be fluid and unstable. However, so long as my original question was not asked frivolously, and was moti- vated by genuine curiosity, I will seek more information about that child. If my friend responds to my further questioning, his child will not remain a pure being, but will become a determinate (or speci- fied) being. At the same time my thought of the child moves from one level of abstraction to another, i.e., it progresses one step forward in its dialectical journey from abstract to concrete. Soon I shall ob- tain a more synthetic idea of the child, insofar as that is possible from an external description. Once his file is thus complete, I may now wish to meet the child personally for an in-depth study of his charac- ter or inner motivation, subjecting him to further, more probing ques- tioning. At that point, I seek his "essence," having already confirmed his "being." From the above example, it is apparent that dialectical "contra- diction" is quite different from "contradiction" in the sense of for- mal logic. The dialectic clearly does not offend the so-called principle of non-contradiction in formal logic. A dialectical contradiction arises when a concept is posed without adequate specification. The concept itself demands more specification, which is not yet available. That constitutes a dialectical contradiction. To specify or determine some- thing, however, is to relate it to something other than itself. For in- stance, a child can be a boy or a girl. To say that it is a boy means that it is not a girl. We thus determine the concept, in this case, by ex- cluding its other possibility. This is in keeping with the well-known Spinozan contention that "all determination is a negation." Unfortunately, an incorrect, and commonly encountered, expla- nation of the triad reverses this procedure and glorifies the mere tru- ism that a boy (thesis) and a girl (antithesis) are both a child (synthe-</page><page sequence="7">440 SCIENCE à? SOCIETY sis). That, however, would be to move from the concrete (more speci- fied) to the abstract (less specified) . There is nothing dialectical in such a proposition. In the above illustration, by contrast. I first find out that there is a child. Next I ask a question to determine whether it is a boy or a girl. Once told that it is a boy, I then ask a further question to determine, for instance, what sort of age bracket he belongs to. Hav- ing received this information, I next try to determine whether he is an extrovert or an introvert, etc. By proceeding in this fashion, I get to know what the child is like. I am in effect writing a "biography" of the child. If, however, there exists a systematic questionnaire, or method of exhaustive questioning, ready for use by everyone, my task will be simplified. If the "child" himself is mature enough, he can be his own interviewer and respondent with a help of this questionnaire. In other words, he can write his own "autobiography." The greatness of Hegel lies in discovering such a systematic question- naire for the first time. He was, according to Marx, "the first to present the general forms of working of the dialectic in a comprehensive and conscious manner" (Marx, 1958, 29). By simply responding to the questionnaire that Hegel designed, a dialectical subject is made to reveal its full "autobiography." That questionnaire consists of the three doctrines of Being, Essence and the Notion. The doctrine of Being is further divided into quality, quantity and measure. Roughly speaking, the dialectical subject (say, my friend's child) is specified externally in this doctrine, by the method of "be- coming (transition)" or "passing over from one form to another." For instance, "the child" becomes "a boy," who becomes "a teenager," who becomes "an extrovert type," who becomes "a talented musician," etc. All items of information are put in the file of the child, which is in three parts. In the first part (quality), we find out what sort of a child he is ( Was für an Kind ist es?), i.e., his being-for-self {Fürsichsein). Suppose that he is musically talented. Then, in the second part (quantity) of the file, we find out how his immanent talent is recognized, tested and measured externally by society. Finally, the last part of his file (mea- sure) explains how the inner talent and its external recognition com- bine to enable the child to grow into a full-fledged musician. At this point we enter the doctrine of Essence, which consists of the ground, appearance and actuality. This doctrine corresponds to the phase of internal specification of the subject. The dialectical</page><page sequence="8">DIALECTICS OF CAPITAL 441 method at work here is often called "reflection (grounding) ," which we may also call "internalization." In this case the dialectical subject does not simply delimit itself by excluding or circumventing what is other than itself, but rather "internalizes" the opposing factors in a more positive and conciliatory fashion. For instance, the child may have inherited great musical talent from his forefathers, yet his fam- ily condition may not have been affluent enough to provide him with proper training in classical music. Under the circumstances he may have decided to adopt a simpler instrument and so developed into a popular musician. He thus preserves his talent (ground), but makes appropriate adaptations to the surrounding conditions (appearance) and establishes himself as a solid musician (actuality) . We then move to the last chapter of his autobiography, the doc- trine of the Notion. We now look at the boy who has established him- self as a popular musician. How does he fare and survive in this world? The doctrine is divided into the subjective notion, the object and the idea (Idee), and the dialectical method at work here is that of "devel- opment or unfolding (Entfaltung)." For example, our musician must regulate his life according to his own principles or self-imposed disci- pline (the subjective notion). The principles must be systematic and consistent; they must also serve his purpose. His life, however, cannot be completely regulated by his principles alone. There are other facts of life which go beyond the purview of his subjective principles. Since they (the object) cannot be ignored, he must find ways to reconcile himself with their requirements. For example, in planning a concert trip, he cannot ignore business considerations nor can he forget about how his parents and siblings feel about it. He may have to make cer- tain necessary concessions. Only when he has learned the wisdom of harmonizing his subjective principles with the objective conditions that constrain them, do we get the real "idea" of the person. The present illustration is not meant to be a rigorous interpreta- tion of Hegel's Logic. Far from that. However, what I wish above all to bring out with this exercise is that the Hegelian dialectic is not a mystical doctrine beyond the grasp of ordinary mortals. On the con- trary, it is a very natural mode of thinking that we all practice in our daily life, whether we are conscious of it or not. For the dialectic is nothing but a system of our own "thought-forms or thought deter- minations." Our next task is to show how the same thought pattern is used to expose the concept of capital dialectically. In this case, we</page><page sequence="9">442 SCIENCE &amp; SOCIETY can afford to be a little more rigorous and precise in our interpreta- tion of the dialectic. The dialectic of capital too consists of the three doctrines of circula- tion, production and distribution. The dialectical methods used in those doctrines are respectively, becoming, internalization, and un- folding. The guiding force of the dialectic of capital is the contradic- tion between value and use-values. Capital, the dialectical subject, reveals itself step by step by letting "value," its most abstract specifi- cation, prevail over "use-values" which represent everything "other" than capital. The doctrine of circulation. If you ask capital: "What are you first of all, prior to all further specifications?," it will answer: "I am abstract- general (i.e., commodity-economic or mercantile) wealth regardless of its concrete-specific or material property which satisfies you in one particular way or another." That abstract-general side of wealth is called "value" as opposed to the concrete-specific side, which is called "use-value." The simplest context in which the two "contradictory" terms appear, co-existing side by side, is the "commodity." That is why Marx says: "The wealth of bourgeois society, at first sight, presents itself as an immense accumulation of commodities, its unit being a single commodity" (Marx, 1904, 19). The value of a commodity cannot be seen. It is buried underneath the correlative use-value of the commodity. To overcome that restric- tion, value expresses itself in the form of a price, i.e., in a definite quantity of the use-value of another commodity. By adopting the use- value of another commodity, it frees itself, as it were, from its own correlative use-value with which it has to co-habit in the same com- modity. Thus it seeks solution outside that commodity. This kind of procedure illustrates the method of transition or becoming. The expression of value in terms of commodities itself gives rise to money. Money is the commodity (such as gold) in the use-value of which all other commodities express their value. By virtue of this fact money purchases other commodities without qualitative restriction, and, in so doing, measures their value. It also takes the forms of ac- tive (transactions) money and idle money. The latter is money which stays outside the sphere of commodity circulation, awaiting the op- portunity to become capital.</page><page sequence="10">DIALECTICS OF CAPITAL 443 Capital is an operation that renders a sum of money into a greater sum of money by adopting the three forms. These are merchant, money- lending and industrial capital. The operation of the first is the most severely constrained by use-values, since the merchant is a middleman caught between producers and consumers. The last form can operate with the maximum of freedom from use-value restrictions, since an industrialist can, in principle, produce any use-value of his choice, pro- vided that labor-power is available to him as a commodity. The doctrine of production. Once the form of industrial capital is well established, a completely new type of "contradiction between value and use-values" arises. This one is between capital as a form of "chrematistic" (value augmentation) and supra-historic "real eco- nomic life," that is to say, the production of use-values in general, which it subsumes. This time the contradiction is solved by a more adequate and secure subsumption of the real economy under the form of value augmentation. The real economic life common to all societies is "internalized" by the chrematistic form of capital. Use-values must be produced in all societies. Under capitalism, however, they are produced only as the reflection (or Schattenseite) of the production of surplus value. Commodities are produced for the surplus value that they contain, and not directly for their use-values. The production of surplus value requires a development of the spe- cifically capitalist method of production, which is most typically rep- resented by factories equipped with machines. The use of machines entails the increasing perfection of labor-power as a commodity. The capitalist production of commodities, however, does not occur only inside the factory. What occurs inside it is controlled and regulated by what takes place outside it. In this doctrine, the production of commodities as value, which contains surplus value, is studied in all its aspects, i.e., inside the fac- tory (as the production-process of capital), outside the factory (as the circulation-process of capital) , and as the continuing activity of the aggregate-social capital (the reproduction-process of capital). The purpose of this doctrine is to establish the capitalist mode of pro- duction as a self-dependent system of commodity production, con- sistent with the supra-historic norms of real economic life. In other words, it is to show that capitalism constitutes a real historical soci- ety, rather than a mere toy model which we arbitrarily invent.</page><page sequence="11">444 SCIENCE &amp; SOCIETY The doctrine of distribution. Once the viability and reproducibili ty of surplus value production is demonstrated, capital then proceeds to develop its own market, the capitalist market. Although every com- modity is always produced as value, i.e., indifferently to use-values, each commodity is nonetheless a distinct use-value, the production of which requires a specific technique. Sometimes, more than one technique is employed in the production of a particular use-value. At this point the "contradiction between value and use-values" arises in yet another form. This time it is a contradiction between the capitalist indifference to use-values and the unavoidability of techni- cal variations in their production. Such a contradiction will be rec- onciled by the dialectic of unfolding or development, a method which is specific to the doctrine of distribution. In the capitalist market, the surplus value that capital as a whole has produced is distributed to individual units of capital in propor- tion to the magnitude of its advance, and this involves the formation of the general rate of profit and production-prices (equilibrium prices) that deviate from values (the theory of profit) . Industrial capi- tal, however, is not the only partaker of surplus value. Although land does not directly participate in the production of value, it is never- theless an indispensable factor in the production of use-values. Hence capital must cede part of surplus value to landed property, which collects various forms of rent (the theory of rent). The ownership of land entitles one to a stream of periodic revenues as rent. The experience of sharing surplus value with landed property in this manner enables capital to reconceptualize itself as an asset or property. As a property, capital too is automatically entitled to a stream of interest revenues. Interest-bearing capital is the most synthetic and complete concept of capital (the theory of interest). This concept, however, can be reached only after industrial capital delegates its circulatory functions to loan-capital and commercial capital. These two forms of capital assist the surplus value production of industrial capital indirectly. By providing credit, loan-capital enables industrial capital to buy commodities which it would otherwise not be able to purchase. By taking over the difficult and time-consuming operation of selling commodities from industrial capital, commercial capital enables it to concentrate on the production of surplus value. In all these cases, capital tries to distance itself from the produc- tion of use-values. The first principle of the distribution of surplus</page><page sequence="12">DIALECTICS OF CAPITAL 445 value as profit enables all units of industrial capital, regardless of the specific use-value they happen to be producing, to be equally re- warded in proportion to the magnitude of capital advanced. The second explains how surplus value may be shared between agricul- ture which is land-intensive and non-agriculture which is not. The last principle of distribution shows how all capitalists, whether en- gaged productively in industry (production of use-values) or unpro- ductively in commerce and finance, may equally partake of the exist- ing pool of surplus value in the form of interest, rather than of profit, in proportion to the magnitude of the ownership of capital. The above explains the structure of the dialectic of capital in a very condensed form. An uncanny homomorphism between Hegel's Logic and the dialectic of capital may be noticed. That, however, is not strange to me. For the dialectical subject is always part of ourselves, though magnified and extended. There must be only one way to let such a subject expose itself totally and systematically, and that is the dialectical way. 5-19-2 Nishiogikita Suginamiku Tokyo 157-0042 Japan REFERENCES Marx, Karl. 1904.
