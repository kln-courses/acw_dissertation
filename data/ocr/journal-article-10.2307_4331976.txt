Thinking with Animals, the editors maintain in their introduction, is a collection of essays that addresses the fact of anthropomorphism not its value, positive or negative. The diversity of themes treated, however, would suggest that the volume is not about the fact, but about thefacts of anthropomorphism. Indeed, a significant contribution of the collec- tion is to show - via its wide variety of subject matter and analyses - that anthropomorphism does not have a uniform meaning, in substance or value. In Hindu mythology, one contribution contends, animals are anthropomorphized in order to crystallize human archetypes, and hu- mans (and gods) are zoomorphized to tell moral tales or uncover the human unconscious. In another essay, anthropomorphism is shown to be shared, though distinctly conceived, by thinkers as different as medieval angelologists and nineteenth-century comparative psycholo- gists. During the Victorian period, it is argued that the laboratory practice of vivisection entailed the "disciplined disregard" of the ani- mal's feelings or perspective - the reverse of anthropomorphism. (The neologism for this is "anthropodenial," viz., denying human mental traits where they ought to be attributed.) One contributor describes experiments designed to test if chimpanzees have a theory of mind - beliefs about the beliefs of others - and argues that anthropomorphism should be neither cavalierly endorsed nor dogmatically rejected, but scientifically assessed whenever possible. Another essay presents an</page><page sequence="2">BOOK REVIEWS 625 original perspective on pet-ownership: we owe the very existence of our companion animals to our incorrigible inclination to anthropomor- phize, for by attributing intricate thoughts and feelings to them we opened the door to include them in our world. Anthropomorphism is consciously exploited in advertising imagery, one author contends, to hook the spectator to the animals represented; the emotional-concep- tual hook serves, in turn, to promote a homogenizing global consumer culture. Finally, the cause of conservation - at least in the case of charismatic mammals like elephants and orangutans - is shown to benefit from anthropomorphic depictions of animal individuality, society, culture, and subjective experience; the intrinsic complexity of animals' lives, coupled with the increasing importance of media to de- liver their stories to the public, has allowed scientists to drop the taboo of anthropomorphism and/or openly challenge it. So is there any essence to "anthropomorphism" beneath such a ga- mut of expressions and practices? Anthropomorphism is defined as that overture by which we perceive - distortedly, accurately, or always incompletely - that "animal minds" are akin to "human minds." The volume underscores that beyond this vague generality, its meaning has been obscure. But obscure has not been the performative force of the term: the charge of anthropomorphism has been deployed to discredit or deride representations that blur the boundary between human and animal lives. But even this use is increasingly being eclipsed in the wake of Darwinian continuity, the emergence of cognitive ethology, and a growing realization that our separatist arrogance has been of disservice to the world. Has the derogatory sense of anthropomorphism finally been super- seded? Not quite - for anthropomorphic representations span the spectrum from sophisticated to naive, from realistically warranted to purely projected. How can we distinguish between divergent qualities of representations when it comes to seeing ourselves reflected in animals? One interesting way to approach this quandary is provided in the col- lection: it involves investigating the relationship between anthropocen- trism and anthropomorphism. Is the impulse to see (or emphasize) the similarities we share with animals derived from our narrow self-cen- teredness, or does it stem from a desire to break from our species provincialism? In other words, is anthropomorphism motivated by vanity or by transcendence? It is a virtue of the volume to pose this key question explicitly. If we narcissistically take our emotional, rational, and moral capacities as frozen givens, and then strive to impose them on ani- mals, we are likely to get incoherent or grotesque reflections back -</page><page sequence="3">626 BOOK REVIEWS chimpanzees with a "theory of mind," dogs bred to suffer from clinical- level separation-anxiety, or once-captive orangutans subsisting in a sad limbo between their anthropomorphized and wild selves. But if our motive in seeing a looking-glass in animal life is transcendence, then our predilection for anthropomorphism can become a bridge to step us through into worlds that are exquisitely different, in all their similarity, from our own. We get gifts from our animal stories, then, that melt our rigid grandiosity and change us. But is this enterprise of transcendence doomed to failure - an impossible dream - as one author suggests? Yes, if it requires becoming the animal and experiencing its subjectivity firsthand. But "going native" with animals fortunately is not about changing our DNA. It is a practice of intimacy, attention, and careful thinking - seen in the work of many scientists, conservationists, natu- ralists, and people with their animals - that yields transformative insights.
