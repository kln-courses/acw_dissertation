It has been posited that the Church represents the fastest-growing religion of the last one hundred fifty years. See Rodney Stark &amp; Reid L. Neilson, The Rise of Mormonism, passim (Colum. U.

But see Peggy Fletcher Stack, Keeping members a challenge for LDS church, Salt Lake Trib. (July 26, 2006) (available at http://www.sltrib.com/ci_2890645 (noting critics of Stark's claims and recent declines in membership retention).

This historical nickname was coined by outsiders in the 1830s, and is derived from Church members' usage of a book of scripture called The Book of Mormon (see infra n. 30). The name has stuck, despite the efforts of some Church leaders who think it is reminiscent of epithets historically given to other persecuted social subclasses. Church members prefer the term "Latter day Saints" to clarify that they do not worship a god named Mormon. However, I and most Church members I know draw no offense from the more-widespread term. I will use "Mormons" throughout?for brevity if nothing else. It is important to note that throughout this paper, when I use the term "Mormon" (unless I specifically say otherwise), I mean one who believes the majority of tenets of the Mormon faith, who attends meetings, and who is generally "in good standing" with the Church. Because the purpose of this paper is to analyze the environmental ethic of the Church and how faithful adherents follow that ethic, the opinion of an ex-Mormon or lax-Mormon would not be very helpful. 5. Deseret Morning News, 2008 Church Almanac 188, 190, 213, 215, 245, 273, 297 (2008) (using 2006 data). Baptized Church members are noted on official membership records unless and until they either are excommunicated from the Church (i.e., officially expelled?a drastic measure) or they formally request to be removed. Therefore, it is important to note that these statistics are overestimates of people who are actively involved in the Church; the extent of the discrepancy is unknown. 6.

Because the membership records of the Church are not public, there is no way of confirming the list of Mormon lawmakers short of personally asking each one, and there is obviously no way of defining the varying levels of "devoutness" for each. Therefore, these lists are unofficial and unconfirmed, but include those who are generally known on Capitol Hill as being (at least in name) members of the Church. 7. As discussed further infra Sect. II.B.2, recent Massachusetts Governor and Mormon Mitt Romney retired from the 2008 GOP primary race on Feb. 7, 2008.</page><page sequence="3">673] AN EARTH USED WITH JUDGMENT 675 their numbers are growing worldwide. Such a substantial social cohort would seem to merit close observation by pundits, politicians, and the public at large; yet Mormons, as a group, rarely receive such attention.8 Why is hard to say, though one could propose a few reasons. First, Mormons vote less as a bloc (and therefore have less-focused political power) than some believe.9 A second reason, some might claim, could be a reduced political concern over religious fanaticism generally.10 A possible third reason could be a general leeriness on the part of local leaders to organize or promote activities in a way that might imply a Church blessing?despite Church leaders' encouragement of such civic involvement.11 Whatever the reason, Mormons, as a group, fly largely 8. This is, however, a modern development. As discussed further infra Sect. ILA, during the late 1800s politicians watched Mormons more closely than perhaps any other single religious group at the time. 9. Although most Mormons are socially conservative, and there are certainly more Mormon Republicans than Democrats, the type and strength of conservatism varies greatly, particularly outside of the Western states (and internationally). Perhaps no Mormon exemplifies variance from the Mormon-Republican-cowboy caricature more than Senate Majority Leader, and staunch Democrat, Harry Reid. See also infra Sect. II.B.3. Representative Rob Bishop (R-UT) described the political split of Mormons this way: Mormons generally, and in Utah in particular, were pretty evenly split between Democrats and Republicans through the 1950s. But they were always conservative. The shift [from mixed to mostly Republican] happened in Utah when Democrats took a decidedly liberal turn. That hasn't really changed. Partisanship has changed, but Mormons remain usually more conservative politically than otherwise. If Democrats became more conservative, there would be more Mormon Democrats. Interview with Rob Bishop, Representative from Utah (June 28, 2007). 10. One would hope that the days of voters accusing a political candidate of blindly and reflexively imposing the will of his church's leaders upon his constituency, as many did John F. Kennedy, are long gone. See generally Thomas J. Carty, A Catholic in the White House?: Religion, Politics, and John F. Kennedy's Presidential Campaign (Palgrave Macmillan 2004). Unfortunately, as recent events have proved, such vulgar biases are as present as ever. One recalls the media circus that followed presidential candidate John Kerry every Sunday for weeks, waiting to see whether the pro-choice Catholic would receive communion. See Laurie Goodstein, Politicians Face Bishops' Censure in Abortion Rift, N.Y. Times Al (June 19, 2004). Mitt Romney experienced much more vitriolic bigotry throughout his campaign. See Scott Helman, Rival Camps Take Aim at Romney 's Religion, Boston Globe (June 21, 2007) (available at http://vvww.boston.com/news/nation/articles/2007/06/21/rival_camps_take_aim_at__romneys_relig ion) (highlighting competing candidates' campaigns' attacks on Romney's religion early in the race); Suzanne Sataline, Tabernacle on Trial: Mormons Dismayed by Harsh Spotlight, Wall St. J.

For a further discussion of Romney's candidacy, see infra Sect. II.B.4. I, for one, was already well acquainted with the queer and vehement anti-Romney biases stemming from his religion: I lived in Cambridge, Massachusetts during Romney's 2002 Gubernatorial campaign, and I vividly remember the day I saw a "NO MORMON GOVERNOR" sign in a Harvard Square shop window. 11.

ILA (discussing the</page><page sequence="4">676 JOURNAL OF LAW &amp; RELIGION [Vol. XXIII under the political radar. But Mormon constituency has not always been as muted, and is again becoming less so since Romney's presidential bid.12 This is appropriate; the fact that Mormons comprise a politically diverse group should not prevent an analysis of the beliefs they share?beliefs that could underscore their individual philosophy or approach to social and inevitably legal policy issues. The influence of Mormon theology and practice on environmental issues is a particularly undeveloped subject. "The political influence of Mormonism ... is indeed little known and inadequately acknowledged by most environmentalists."13 Recently, the United States Environmental Protection Agency was headed by Michael Leavitt, a devout Mormon. Did Leavitt's membership in the Church affect his policies while there? Could it have? Should it have? If Mitt Romney had become president in 2008, would his membership in the Church have affected his environmental policy? What is the Mormon faith's environmental ethic, anyway? Do Mormons apply that ethic to their view of environmental laws? This paper attempts to address some of these questions. This paper will not presume to say whether Mormons make good environmentalists in practice?that is up to the reader to decide, based on her own understanding of what makes a "good environmentalist." Rather, the goal of this paper is more fundamental: to ask whether Mormons make good environmentalists in theory, and to postulate how they might be better in practice. Two general approaches will be used. First, the paper will explicate the environmental teachings of the Mormon faith: What scriptures or doctrines could a Mormon cite if asked, "How does your religion say you should treat the earth?" Second, the paper will share examples of historical and present-day Mormons of enviro-political influence. With this background, one could effectively postulate what is, may be, and perhaps should be the relationship between Mormons, their religion, their environs, and the laws that protect them. Section I provides insight into Mormon religious doctrine. First, some general doctrines and practices that have environmental implications and ramifications are discussed. Second, the actual environmental teachings of the Mormon faith are explicated, both as historical and modern Church's relationship with American politics). 12.

Section II describes how Mormons interact with and within governments, both historically and today, domestic and abroad. First, by way of background, the general attitude of the Church towards the United States government is discussed and the development of a modern Mormon political ethic is described. Then three instances in which Mormons across the globe have been or could be particularly enviro politically influential are profiled: the settling of the Utah territory; the engagement of American Mormon politicians in environmental issues during the last century; and the development of a significant Mormon population in Polynesia. Finally, this paper concludes with a call for responsible stewardship to guide the future of Mormon environmental influence. I. The Morman Faith and the Environment Mormon doctrine, as scholars know, is unique among Christianity on some fundamental levels. Less known, and often overlooked by members, are its environmental teachings. This section reveals the environmental aspects of the faith, from the abstract to the specific, from the nascent to the recent. First, fundamental doctrines with environmental implications are highlighted, and then explicit environmental doctrine is discussed in detail.14 After considering Mormon doctrine, the Church's and its members' positions on environmental laws and policies can be more readily understood. A. Broad "Green" Doctrine and Practices "We are a peculiar people; we are a congregation of true believers who are unique and different from all others . . . ."15 Mormons are similar to other Christians in many beliefs, as well as practices. They believe that we are children of a loving God, on earth to pass a moral test, that God sent his son, Jesus Christ, to expiate our 14. Where a source discussing the Church's teachings is available, I cite to it in the following order of preference: statements of prophet-presidents; official modern Church publications (Ensign, New Era, et al.), which include statements of other Church leaders; statements of noted Mormon philosophers, authors and professors. As in any religion, it is impossible to divulge beliefs without somehow also interpreting them, and perhaps not every Mormon would agree with the way I present the doctrines in this section. However, I actively avoid any interpretation of Church beliefs that would not, I believe, merit agreement from the overwhelming majority of Church members. 15. Bruce R. McConkie, The Mystery of Mormonism, Ensign 53, 53 (Nov. 1979).</page><page sequence="6">678 JOURNAL OF LAW &amp; RELLGLON [Vol. XXIII shortcomings, and so on.16 There are also, of course, beliefs that significantly distinguish the Mormon faith from most other Christians, differences that have engendered debate both scholarly and pedestrian.17 Two unique doctrines, though not specifically environmental, are particularly important for our purposes here: a specific health code known as the "Word of Wisdom," and the Mormon belief in the Godlike potential of man. Finally, in addition to these unique doctrines, two Church practices glint at a green ethic. Mormons believe that Church presidents, including the current president Thomas S. Monson, are literally prophets.18 One can thus understand why Mormons take all Church leaders' instructions very seriously.19 One of these instructions is a code of health for modern Mormon living. Revealed to Joseph Smith in 1833, it has become 16. See generally The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, http://www.mormon.org (accessed Feb. 2, 2008) (general Mormon doctrine); The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, http://www.lds.org (accessed Feb. 2, 2008) (same). 17. As Mormon scholar Hugh Nibley put it, "Mormonism, though emphatically Christian, is neither Catholic or [sic] Protestant, and ... it defies identification with or absorption by any other movement." Hugh Nibley, In the Party But Not Of the Party, in The Collected Works of Hugh Nibley Vol. 13: Brother Brigham Challenges the Saints 127 (Don E. Norton &amp; Shirley S. Ricks eds., Deseret Bk. Co. 1994) [hereinafter Brother Brigham]. Unique aspects include a belief that God, Christ, and the Holy Spirit are distinct personages (as opposed to a chimeric trinity); a belief that the family unit can, under proper authority, extend eternally as a unit; a belief that all males may hold priesthood authority (not just a select clergy); and many others. 18. Monson receives revelation from God and passes it along to current Church members, just as Moses did for the liberated Israelites. The words of modern prophets are accorded weight equal to those of Isaiah or Elijah?or even more weight because the instruction is more recent and individualized. See e.g. The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, Gospel Principles, ch. 9 ("Prophets of God"), http://lds.org/ldsorg/v/index.jsp?vgnextoid^32c41b08?38c 010 VgnVCM 1000004d82620aRCRD&amp;locale=0&amp;sourceId=0cba7befabc2011 OVgnVCM 1000001 76f620a_ (accessed Feb. 21, 2008). Because of this view, I use the terms "prophet," "president," and "prophet-president" interchangeably. 19. Admittedly, it can be hard to tell when Monson speaks merely as a mortal octogenarian and when he speaks as the mouthpiece of the Almighty. The Catholic church attempts to deal with this dilemma via the doctrine of the infallibility of the Pope. In my limited understanding, the Pope speaks literally for God when discussing the doctrines of the Catholic church. In any event, this is an accurate description of Mormons' respect towards the words of their prophet regarding their religion. The problem lies in defining when the prophet is actually speaking about religion?one could argue that every time Monson speaks, he is discussing religion. For a collection of critical essays on Mormon prophets and such dilemmas, see the articles in 22 Sunstone (July-Aug. 1980). It is perhaps appropriate here to briefly describe the Church leadership structure. The President is assisted by two counselors and twelve "apostles," whose words are given great weight, though perhaps not quite as much as the prophet-president's. This "Quorum of the Twelve" is in turn assisted by several hundred men with various responsibilities throughout the world, divided into groups of seventy?something akin to the Catholic College of Cardinals. New apostles are nearly always selected from these "Seventies," and a new prophet has historically been the most-tenured apostle?though all appointments are ostensibly made by revelation and inspiration.</page><page sequence="7">673] AN EARTH USED WLTH JUDGMENT 679 known as the "Word of Wisdom," heavenly instruction on the way one is to care for one's body.20 The original passage forbad the use of tobacco (except to heal cattle) and "strong drink" (now interpreted to mean alcohol, coffee, and tea).21 Less known to outsiders, Mormons are also instructed to eat meat "sparingly," to eat seasonal grains and fruits, and to use "all wholesome herbs."22 What this teaching demonstrates is a Mormon awareness, indeed an obligation to remember, that one's "spiritual and physical health are interdependent and that health of spirit and body is contingent on an ethical relationship of moderation to other living forms created by God."23 Such an ethic of moderation in interaction with the earth could easily be extended into a perceived role as a "low-impact," environmentally-conscious species. The other doctrine unique to the Mormon faith and important here is that of the divine potential of mankind. Although many religions teach that mankind is made "in the image of God," each person with a spark of the divine, few take this principle as far as Mormons do. Mormons believe that people are literally spiritual children of God, with the potential to become Gods and create worlds of our own?a heretical belief to some other Christians. Whether this potential is reached depends on how one lives in this life, including vis-?-vis one's stewardship of this earth. "We are being tested to demonstrate to the heavens, to ourselves, and to our fellows just how we would treat the things of a glorious and beautiful world if they were given to us as our very own."24 "[I]f [a man] does not act in a godlike manner [in this life], he will never be entrusted with a creation of his own, worlds without end."25 Obviously, such a divine reward is an incentive to exercise good 20.

Aside from its doctrine, two of the Church's unique practices have green implications and are worth mentioning. First, foremost among the Church's secular ventures is cattle-ranching: [The Church] owns over 150 farms and ranches (including Florida's 312,000-acre Deseret Ranch, the largest cattle ranch in the United States); the Church's one million acres in holdings make it one of the country's largest landowners and a major player in agribusiness.26 Second, in connection with a strong historical focus on emergency preparedness, the Church has also traditionally been involved in supplying food storage for its members, such as running bee colonies for honey and operating canneries. Although these efforts have diminished with greater commercial availability of freeze-dried goods, the Church still urges its members to keep a one-year's food supply, prepare a seventy-two-hour emergency kit, and grow a garden.27 These doctrines and practices provide a backdrop for the Mormon faith's specific doctrines regarding mankind's relationship with the earth. B. Specific Environmental Doctrine "Verily I say, that inasmuch as ye [keep these commandments], the fulness of the earth is yours. . . ,"28 Armed with knowledge of some general Mormon doctrines and activities with environmental implications, we can explore explicit environmental teachings from both ancient and modern sources. 1. Ancient Scripture and Early Church Supplements: Stewardship, Natural Resources, and the Soul 26. Foltz, supra n. 13, at 3 (citation omitted). On a personal note, I grew up quite near the Deseret Ranch, knew Mormon ranchers that worked there, and attended Church activities there as a teenager. The next-largest ranching property owned by the Church appears to be the Deseret Land and Livestock Company in Woodruff, Utah.

D&amp;C 59:16.</page><page sequence="9">673] AN EARTH USED WLTH JUDGMENT 681 Mormons use the New and Old Testaments of the Bible, but supplement them directly and indirectly in several ways. First, Joseph Smith "re-translated" select parts of the Bible. Second, Mormons use two additional works as ancient scripture.30 Finally, Joseph Smith's collected revelations serve as a set of nineteenth-century "scripture."31 A review of relevant doctrine from these sources gives insight into the Mormon environmental ethic. Specifically, three environmental teachings are given in Mormon scripture: a role as stewards, a perspective on the supply of the earth's resources, and an expansive view of the soul. Stewardship The Mormon reading of the Bible does not differ substantially from that of any other Judeo-Christian when it comes to mankind's relationship with the earth. For example, Mormons, like other Christians, cite God's initial description of the earth and the life upon it as "good" (nay, "very good")32 to remind us that the environment has inherent value.33 However, Church leaders have taken this principle even further by using the Bible to define a stewardship over the environment: The [Bible] says that all life upon the earth was delivered into the hand of man, and that the Lord placed man in charge of all things, both moving creatures and green herbs [as reaffirmed in the story of Noah and the Ark found in Genesis 9:2-3]. These verses signify a reaffirmation and renewal unto Noah of the environmental responsibility that had been placed upon Adam and his posterity.34 Joseph Smith shifted this call of stewardship from implicit philosophy to divine instruction by revealing the following: "[I]t is 29. The Pearl of Great Price [hereinafter PoGP] Articles of Faith 1:8 ("We believe the Bible to be the word of God as far as it is translated correctly . . . ."). Mormons universally use the King James Version of the Bible. 30. The two additional collections are The Pearl of Great Price (consisting of 2 primary books) and The Book of Mormon: Another Testament of Jesus Christ [hereinafter BoM] (consisting of 15 books). According to Mormon belief, each was received and translated by Joseph Smith from ancient scrolls and the Bible (in the case of the PoGP) and from gold plates (in the case of the BoM). For the sake of consistency and to better reflect the Mormon view of these collections as scripture, they are cited herein in a format similar to that for citation of the Bible: [PoGP or BoM] (book) (chapter) (verse(s)). 31. See the discussion of The Doctrine and Covenants, supra n. 1. 32. See Gen 1:31 (all Biblical citations are taken from the King James version). 33. See e.g. Russell M.

Mormons give great weight to Joseph Smith's re-translation of select parts of the Bible, and some alterations dramatically influence environmental doctrine. One important addition to the stewardship doctrine resulted from the re-translation of God's promise to Noah never to flood the earth again: I will establish my covenant with you; neither shall all flesh be cut off any more by the waters of a flood; neither shall there any more be a flood to destroy the earth. And the bow shall be in the cloud; and I will look upon it, that I may remember the everlasting covenant. . . ,37 I will establish my covenant with you; neither shall all flesh be cut off any more by the waters of a flood; neither shall there any more be a flood to destroy the earth.

That is to say, . . . when the Lord comes again, . . . the earth will return to its [Edenic] paradisiacal state and be renewed. It will be made new again; it will become a new heaven and a new earth whereon dwelleth righteousness.39 In other words, "[t]he earth is the home [God] has prepared for us" after this life?it will be our heaven.40 But it must "be sanctified from all unrighteousness, that it may be prepared for th[is] celestial glory."41 Modern leaders have also made clear whose job it is to sanctify the earth: "Who but man shall remove the foul blot, and restore all things to their primeval purity and innocence?"42 Because the "fallen" state of the earth is at least partially mankind's fault,43 Mormon doctrine preaches a responsibility to respect and care for the earth man will re-inherit. In fact, Joseph Smith taught that environmental care is more than a responsibility to care for a world with celestial potential?it is a requirement to reach one's own potential for godhood:44 Joseph Smith viewed stewardship for the creation not only as a responsibility, but also as congruent with the attributes of god-like love, which seeks the eternal progression and general well-being of all life. Latter-day Saints are challenged to emulate this love.45 Smith expressed this view powerfully and poetically: How will the serpent ever lose its venom, while the servants of God possess the same [venomous] disposition, and continue to make war upon [the earth]? Men must become harmless before 39. Bruce R. McConkie, Christ and the Creation, Ensign 9 (June 1982) (quoting PoGP Articles of Faith 1:10). This doctrine is actually quite complex, as Mormons believe in multiple "heavens," the population of each being decided after a millennial era here on the earth? something post-"normal" life, yet pre-"judgment day." The exact details of the paradisiacal earth and mankind's re-inheritance of it are unnecessary to detail here; suffice it to say that Mormons believe that the earth will have a continued role to play after mortal life has ended. 40.

"Un "limited Natural Resources Perhaps the most well-known and oft-quoted passage of Mormon environmental scripture?by Mormons and detractors?is found in The Doctrine and Covenants and concerns the nature and supply of natural resources: "For the earth is full, and there is enough and to spare. . . ."4? Modern Mormon leaders have said that this is true no matter how many inhabit the earth?the Church has remained adamantly opposed to the position that the world is, or even can be, overpopulated.48 Some have criticized this position as one made in fatuous environmental ignorance,49 and such criticism would be well-deserved? if not for the conditional nature of the Church's position. The context of this scriptural passage, often overlooked (by detractors and some Mormons alike), is one of chastisement for those unwilling to share their wealth with the less fortunate,50 implying that the earth's resources are sufficient whatever the population, but only if managed wisely. The Church has reiterated this point recently: [A] more relevant issue than population density is how we use the resources God has given us to support the population now and in the future. . . . "The enemy of human happiness as well as the cause of poverty and starvation is not the birth of children .... It is the failure of people to do with the earth what God could teach them to do if only they would ask and then obey."51 46. Id.

The Nature of the Soul Further insight into Mormons' view of the earth is gained by examining the supplemental "Biblical" text called the Pearl of Great Price. This text contains additional teachings of the prophets Moses and Abraham, translated by Joseph Smith from the Bible and from Egyptian papyrus scrolls found in 1835, respectively.52 The revealed teachings found in Moses expose a tie between man and earth even stronger than the Old Testament provides. After giving an account of the creation indistinguishable from that in Genesis, the book then expounds: For I, the Lord God, created all [these] things . . . spiritually, before they were naturally upon the face of the earth. And out of the ground made I, the Lord God, to grow every tree, naturally, that is pleasant to the sight of man. . . . And it became also a living soul. For it was spiritual in the day that I created it; for it remaineth in the sphere in which I, God, created it. . . . And out of the ground I, the Lord God, formed every beast of the field, and every fowl of the air . . . and they were also living souls; for I, God, breathed into them the breath of life. . . ,53 Later, the book describes a vision Enoch had of the end of time: And it came to pass that Enoch looked upon the earth; and he heard a voice from the bowels thereof, saying "Wo, wo is me, the mother of men; I am pained, I am weary. . . . When shall I rest, and be cleansed from the filthiness which is gone forth out of me? When will my Creator sanctify me, that I may rest. . .?"54 Even if one interprets this passage as referring to spiritual rather than chemical "pollution," the humanization of mother earth, along with all flora and fauna, has its own environmental implications: Every plant, every animal?and impliedly even the earth itself, which awaits a paradisiacal renewal?has a "soul."55 As a result, all will be resurrected 52.

This is a particularly notable belief because Mormons give deep meaning to the term "soul." Mormons believe that the "soul," far from being something abstract such as innate goodness or divinity, is the literal sum of spirit and body, and the object of salvation. See D&amp;C</page><page sequence="14">686 JOURNAL OF LAW &amp; RELIGION [Vol. XXIII at the judgment day. Prophets of the Church, from Joseph Smith to Brigham Young to the present-day Church leaders, have affirmed and reaffirmed these beliefs.57 This belief that God "created all things . . . spiritually, before they were naturally upon the face of the earth"58 is fairly unique among Christianity. Most Christians view man as having a monopoly on eternal progression, and consider a belief in the divinity of plants, animals, and Gaia impious. But although this superficially anthropomorphic belief is similar to pagan animism and pantheism, it is neither.59 Rather, it establishes an eternally welded link between mankind and nature?a common spiritual ancestry. Plant and animal, woman and man existed before this life, and each has a divine and interconnected purpose. Further, Joseph Smith revealed that this link must be kept strong for our own good: "The elements are eternal, and spirit and [physical] elementfs], inseparably connected, receive a fullness of joy; And when separated, man cannot receive a fullness of joy."60 This belief gives Mormons unique theological potential to have a 88:15 ("[T]he spirit and the body are the soul of man."); PoGP Abraham 5:7 ("[M]an became a living soul" after combining his spirit and body); Marion G. Romney, We Are Children of God, Ensign 3 (Sept. 1984) (discussing Mormon beliefs about the origin and fate of the soul). Mormons also believe that each person was an "intelligence" before their body and spirit were "organized"; the extent to which plants, animals, and the earth also were "intelligences" is unclear. The obvious question of the role evolution plays in this theology has been left unanswered by Church leaders. See infra n. 275. 56. See D&amp;C 29:24-25 ("[A]ll things shall become new, even the heaven and the earth, and the fullness thereof, both men and beasts, the fowls of the air, and the fishes of the sea . . . ."); id. at 77:2-3 (interpreting Saint John's teachings in Revelation as meaning that all creations will "enjoy[] . . . their eternal felicity"). 57. See Thomas G. Alexander, Stewardship and Enterprise: The LDS Church and the Wasatch Oasis Environment, 1847-1930, in Stewardship and the Creation: LDS Perspectives on the Environment (George B.

Something not explicitly addressed by this paper, but a subject that merits further discussion, is the implication of this belief on animal rights theory, law, and policy in the minds of, and jurisdictions populated by, Mormon judges, politicians, and voters. 58.

Some might say that this passage refers only to the doctrine that resurrection consists of the reunification of body and spirit (discussed supra n. 55). While that is clearly the primary purpose from the context, the obvious element of care for that body implies a need for oneness with one's environment. See id. at 93:35 (commanding man to care for his body).</page><page sequence="15">673] AN EARTH USED WITH JUDGMENT 687 committed relationship with their environment. Other Mormon scriptures also reveal glints of an environmental awareness. The Book of Mormon relates stories of recovery from deforestation61 and of people being healed "because of the excellent qualities of the many plants and roots which God had prepared to remove the cause of diseases."62 The book of Abraham teaches that Adam took part in the creation by meeting and naming every animal individually.63 Although there is no clear definition, perhaps even delineation, of Mormon environmental doctrine that can be drawn from scripture, a few things are clear. God has given us the earth's resources to be used, but commands that they be managed with wisdom and prudence. The reason is twofold. First, they will only be sufficient if so managed. Second, we share with them (flora, fauna, and the earth itself) a link to God. This link will continue, and mankind's inheritance of the earth extends, beyond mortality. Thus, man is commanded to acknowledge, develop, and preserve this intimate relationship with nature?to be a good steward?for his own good. "[C]are for the creation is not only conducive with, but essential to being a faithful son and daughter of God."64 2. Modern Instruction and Translation Into Action: From Explicit Instructions to Bromidic Principles None of the historical environmental doctrines discussed have been revoked or altered since they were revealed. Modern prophets continue to affirm these environmental doctrines, with new teachings also considered "scripture" by Mormons.65 The most recent article to address the subject of the earth in the primary official Church magazine, the Ensign, serves as a typical example of the type of modern Mormon environmental instruction. 61. See BoM Helaman 3:5-7, 9-10. "And the people . . . did suffer whatsoever tree should spring up upon the face of the land that it should grow up, that in time they might have timber . . . ."

Mormons have a broad definition of scripture: "[Whatsoever [Church leaders] shall speak when moved upon by the Holy Ghost shall be scripture . . . ." D&amp;C 68:4. Having living prophets sometimes complicates the issue, as mentioned supra, n. 19, by seemingly requiring some distinction between their lectures to the Church as a whole and their words in more individualized and casual settings?even though presumably the prophet is always "moved upon by the Holy Ghost."</page><page sequence="16">688 JOURNAL OF LAW &amp; RELIGION [Vol. XXIII After relating a personal story of a memorable nature hike?"That sunrise was, for me, an intensely religious experience"?the Church leader says that the earth holds valuable lessons for our day.66 "We can draw three lessons from nature's grandeur: first, God exists; second, God is powerful; and third, God loves us."67 After expounding on how the earth teaches these truths, the leader shifts to mankind's resultant duties: "[B]y virtue of living upon the earth we shoulder two responsibilities. The first is to care for our beautiful home [and the second is to be grateful for it]."68 But when it comes time to explicate that duty of care, the instruction is anything but prolix: Humanity as a whole is doing a poor job of caring for the earth. Individually, we can do better. We can, of course, not litter. In fact, we can help pick up after those who do. We can practice conservation of resources where possible. All of our actions can display respect for the creations of God.69 Church officials, as evident, nearly always stop short of actually urging activism, or even actual policies, choosing instead to end in simple suggestions and affirmative platitudes of the importance of remembering our stewardship over the earth and our mutual creator. Although translation of environmental doctrine into action by individual members is the subject of the next section, it is worth mentioning that modern official Church publications have occasionally been more strongly worded?more explicit in a call for environmental protection. In the summer of 1971, in the infancy of the modern environmental era, a lengthy article entitled Our Deteriorating Environment appeared in the Ensign.70 In it, a Church member (not then a Church leader)71 declared that the world's "wondrous wild creatures?and even man himself?are threatened by the erosive forces that reduce the quality of 66.

Although Morrison was not then a general Church leader, the President and his counselors are said to have complete editorial control over the Church magazines. Therefore, anything printed in any of the official Church magazines is commonly viewed?rightly or wrongly?as at least official Church advice, if not more.

Citing "widespread agreement that in our mindless rush toward material prosperity we have unbalanced" the delicate circle of life, "plundering] our planet and despoil[ing] our environment," he condemned "the state of affairs in North America."73 The article was strongly worded, even by today's standards: "[P]ure air has become a thing of the past, as it has been replaced by choking, irritating, eye burning smog"; "Lake Erie, for practical purposes, has become a giant cesspool"; "[M]ercury pollution of inland waters has been widespread"; etc.74 The article certainly seemed to cross the line into political advocacy: More and more industries are recognizing their corporate responsibility to protect the environment. Most important, ordinary citizens have become concerned and are demanding an end to the pillage and exploitation of our environment. To be effective, action by individuals, industry, and government to control and limit pollution must consider the basic causes of the problem.75 And what were the causes of the problem? They were "primarily moral and spiritual problems, rather than problems of technology": materialism, scientific rationalism, environmental isolationism, and generational isolationism.76 "The serious ecological problems which face us have as their basis a disordered spirituality; they can be cured and prevented only by a reorientation toward the proper purpose of life [as taught by the Mormon faith]."77 Environmental activism has occasionally crept through in other Church publications as well. A few years after the abovementioned article, an article in the Church's magazine for teenagers said that "[m]any places in our world are ... in danger of being made unfit for life?any kind of life! The reason? Man is polluting the environment, destroying the ecological system."78 Such references were not confined to the budding environmental awareness of the late sixties and early 72.

In 1981, the Church devoted an entire article in its children's magazine to explain what acid rain was?"a sad case of man's transgression of the laws of nature."79 In the early nineties, one article said global warming no longer merited skepticism and asked Church members, "What will our answer be when the Lord asks how we treated the earth?this gift he gave us gladly and which he asks us to use with gladness?"80 The article then listed ways to help "take better care of the earth," including recycling, boycotting environmentally damaging products, and gardening.81 A later article repeated many of these suggestions. The vigorous, even activist tone of these articles, only tangentially related to fundamental Mormon theological doctrine, is rare in Church magazines.83 There has been very little, if any, substantive environmental instruction from the Church in the last decade?even the last century. Although some have claimed this is due to modern Church leaders who do not care enough about environmental problems,84 it is also possible that the paucity of explicit environmental instruction is merely a result of modern Church leaders' belief in teaching "principles," not "practices."85 Monson and his counselors seem content simply to say "it is not meet that I should command in all things,"86 choosing instead to teach righteous environmental principles, and let Church members decide for themselves how to implement them. As the next Section will discuss, this approach?giving principles but not directives?has had mixed results, environmentally speaking. The Mormon environmental principle has been made clear: "As beneficiaries of the divine Creation, what shall we do? We should care 79. Sherwood B. Idso, Acid Rain, Friend 18, 18-19 (May 1981). 80. G.

II. The Mormon Politic and the Environment Given the strong environmental vein running through many of the Mormon faith's teachings, one might expect devout Mormons to be dedicated to preserving the earth they are eternally linked to. Some are. Yet many critics believe the average Mormon is at best indifferent to environmental causes. In fact, "[t]he perceived divide between [environmentalism and Mormon beliefs] has all but shut down the possibility of dialogue."88 The division can indeed be quite contentious: Some Mormons dismiss the political causes of environmentalists as being the fears of faithless hedonists, just as otherwise responsible environmental scholars and activists sometimes perpetuate myths and inaccuracies about what they perceive to be the anti-ecological stance of [the Church].89 Are Mormons dismissive of environmental concerns, despite their faith's teachings? Do Mormons support or denounce efforts to protect the environment? This section analyzes these questions, first with general observations of Mormons in politics (specifically, American politics), and then a more-focused historical analysis of some key Mormon enviro-political impacts across the world. A. Mormons and U.S. Politics: A Brief History "[There are those who] enquire, 'are there any Democrats here? Are there any Republicans here?' We do not care who rules; we are satisfied with God, who setteth up one man, and casteth down another."90 Mormons believe in the principle of civil law. "We believe in being subject to kings, presidents, rulers, and magistrates, in obeying, 87. Nelson, supra n. 33. 88. Handley, supra n. 23, at 187. 89. Id. 90.

Dionne) (discussing historic vacillations in Mormon political leaning).</page><page sequence="20">692 JOURNAL OF LAW &amp; RELIGION [Vol. XXIII honoring, and sustaining the law."91 This general appreciation and support of government has developed in many Mormons a desire to enter public service, something Church leaders have always strongly encouraged: [A] s in the past, we urge members of the Church to be full participants in political, governmental, and community affairs. Members of the Church are under special obligations to seek out and then uphold those leaders who are wise, good, and honest. Thus, we strongly urge men and women to be willing to serve on school boards, city and county councils and commissions, state legislatures, and other high offices of either election or appointment, including involvement in the political party of their choice.92 Mormons of both parties have taken up the charge, and the resultant Mormon statistical overrepresentation in politics93 is one impetus for this paper. But Mormons and government have not always had such a happy marriage.94 During the early church's struggles with mobs and abuse? first in Ohio, then Missouri, and then Illinois?Mormons were eager to use politics as a way to stop their growing persecution.95 Although the first Mormons traditionally voted Democrat, there were several vacillations between Democrat and Whig candidates in the late 1830s and early 1840s. "Their single issue was protection from mobs. . . . The usual party loyalties meant nothing."96 This is not surprising, given the color of law mobs obtained when the Governor of Missouri authorized the use of military force to expel or eradicate Mormons from the state in 1838.97 Because Mormons at that time effectively voted as a bloc, their 91.

After the last perceived "betrayal" at the voting booths, this one against the Whigs who controlled much of the Illinois press, the state "opened the spigots" and anti-Mormon rhetoric again escalated into abuse.99 The maltreatment of the Mormon community culminated infamously in an ill-fated run at the 1844 United States presidency by a frustrated Joseph Smith (though some have argued the attempt was more symbolic than serious).100 When that effort fizzled and then was trumped by Smith's murder,101 when the persecution in Illinois escalated to match that of the hated Missourians, and when pleas to the federal government to stop the incessant persecution failed to move Congress or the President (Van Buren or Harrison) to intervene,102 Church leaders and members had little choice but to get as far away from other Americans as possible. Utah would be their new home.103 At the time, the area belonged to Mexico, and though it was ceded to the United States soon after Mormons arrived, it retained its designation as Ute "Indian land."104 The Church had a fragile relationship with the United States during the Utah-territory days. After Mormons sent missionaries to preach to the Native Americans of the western plains, Americans accused the Mormons of building a treasonous alliance with the savages.105 Contemporary accounts of Mormons' disloyalty to America were often extreme.106 Congress passed laws openly aimed at making it Mormons ' Forced Removal to Illinois, in A City of Refuge: Quincy, Illinois 1 (Susan Easton Black &amp; Richard E.

The emigrants were certainly afraid of and angry at the citizens of the various states that had attempted a Mormon genocide, but their problem was not so much with America?just Americans. In fact, Mormons then (as now) believed that the Constitution was an inspired document, and that America literally was a nation established under and guided by Government, and in event of failure teach their children to pursue that purpose after them. J.H. Beadle, Life in Utah; or, the Mysteries and Crimes of Mormonism, Being an Expos? of the Secret Rites and Ceremonies of the Latter-Day Saints 497 (Nati. Publg. Co. c.1870). The accuracy of such an account is difficult to verify. As acknowledged during Reed Smoot's Senate hearings (discussed infra at pp. 702-703), the temple ceremony at the time did include an oath to pray for God to take vengeance upon those who murdered Joseph Smith. U.S. Sen. Doc. 486 (59th Congress, 1st Session) Proceedings Before the Committee on Privileges and Elections of the United States Senate in the Matter of the Protests Against the Right of Hon. Reed Smoot, a Senator from the State of Utah, to hold his Seat (Govt. Printing Off, 1906) vol. 1, 6-7. However, Beadle's claim that they also swore to "do all in their power towards the overthrow of that Government," and that overt treasonous planning was afoot, is much more debatable, and even specious. In my view, the bias of his account seems obvious from the book's title. Mormons certainly were upset at the government that had abandoned them and allowed their prophet to be murdered, a hatred that carried on for some time. See Durham, supra n. 99, at 144 ("[Brigham Young] roundly cursed the murderers of Joseph Smith as well as 'all the governors and presidents of the U.S.A.' and voiced his opinion that... 'if [the government] ever sent any men to interfere with us here they shall have there [sic] throats cut &amp; sent to Hell.'"). However, this anger never, as Beadle claimed, seemed to boil into an active desire to overthrow the United States government?it was merely a desire to be left alone. See id. at 157-158 (quoting Brigham Young as saying later, in 1856, "All we care about is . . . for them [the federal government] to let us alone, to keep away their trash and officers so far as possible, to give us our admission into the Union just as we are . . ."). For a later description of Mormon temple ceremonies, compare the following account (the accuracy of which I can personally attest to): "No jot, iota, or tittle of the temple rites is otherwise than uplifting and sanctifying. In every detail [the ceremonies] contribute^ to covenants of morality of life, consecration of person to high ideals, devotion to truth, patriotism to nation, and allegiance to God." James E.

This may seem in bad taste for a mere territory, but the Governor claims that she [Utah] is "a part of the grand confederacy which has so long embellished the national galaxy" so there is no more to be said [of rumored treason].112 Relations with outsiders aside, Mormons?or more specifically, Young?began to raise a highly organized, stable society out of the dust of the Great Basin desert. Mormons established organized villages, dividing land and resources amongst themselves under Church leadership.113 Within a few weeks of the first Mormon settlers' arrival, the settlement included "twenty-nine log houses in [a] walled fort" as well as "a blacksmith shop," "a storehouse," and "a public yard for the production of bricks."114 At such a rate, it is no surprise that within a few years, in the summer of 1851, the first official Legislative Assembly was held, "embracing the usual range of legislative action"?public education, road construction, establishing a judiciary, etc.115 A new state was on the horizon.116 Fast-forward a sesquicentenary, and one now finds Mormons "embracing the usual range of legislative action" beyond Utah.117 Despite the political success of certain individual Mormons, some of whom will be discussed in the next Section, the Church has refused to endorse candidates for many decades118 and remained remarkably silent 111.

Is this a contradiction?"120 Perhaps. The Church may remain out of politics, but Mormon politicians have no such luxury. With their broad influence, the question then becomes how this influence has been used on weighty political issues?such as the environment. B. Mormons and Their Environments: Profiles of Influence 1. Brigham Young and the Utah Frontier "The soil, the air, the water [of our new home] are all pure and healthy. Do not suffer them to become polluted with wickedness."121 discussed supra n. 25, the first Mormons voted as directed by their leaders. It is unclear when this practice stopped. Senator Bob Bennett, a long-time Mormon politician, recalled his first encounter with the Church's political impartiality as follows: [I]n the 1962 campaign [for a senate primary], Reed Benson (then-Elder [and later prophet Ezra] Benson's son) did a significant amount of campaigning in church buildings .... [Later that year,] after losing the primary . . . Reed joined the John Birch Society. The church issued two formal statements in the form of a First-Presidency statement printed on the front page of the Deseret News: The first one saying it's inappropriate to use church buildings for campaign purposes?and that was widely interpreted as being a slap at Reed?and the second one [saying] that the church was not aligned with the John Birch Society, and that members were free to join the John Birch Society or free to stay away from the John Birch Society either way, and my guess is that the "tightening on the reigns" [on the Church's involvement in politics began there, though I could be mistaken].

He was also an environmentalist. "It is one of the most happifying subjects that can be named, for a person . . . [to] understand the design of the Great Maker of this beautiful creation."122 He taught that such understanding comes only through divine insight: "When the Spirit inspires a man, his mind is opened to behold the beauty, order and glory of the creation of this earth."123 And once such understanding of natural resources is gained, he urged "[i]t is not our privilege to waste the Lord's substance."124 From the beginning, Young led the Church members in an environmentally sensitive manner. During the trek west, he "advised the brethren not to kill any more buffalo or other game until the meat was needed."125 This was in 1847, four decades before Buffalo Bill Cody and others gained fame for slaughtering thousands upon thousands of the animals for sport.126 He also urged caution to avoid starting and spreading wildfires, and was always the last one to leave a camp or celebration to "see that the fires are all well put out."127 Once they reached the Salt Lake valley, Mormons began to spread and develop like such a wildfire. This growth involved a rapacious use of resources. The new settlers and the continuous flow of immigrants brought with them greater and greater hordes of cattle, sheep, and hungry children. Inevitably, this growth in the relatively arid valley erased tree lines and damaged delicate watersheds within a few decades 122.

On the contrary, he was "keenly aware of. . . the awful responsibility that weighed upon anyone who presumed to alter the face of nature and create an environment in which generations yet unborn would be obliged to live."130 Throughout his tenure as prophet and governor,131 Young tried to manage this responsibility of conservation via both roles. Through his role as prophet, he preached to Church members on the environment, and had subordinate religious leaders do the same. In a Church-wide address in 1865, decades before the worst vegetative damage was done to the mountain watersheds, one of Young's apostles "deplored the destruction of vegetation in the valleys. . . [and] chastised the people for the damage caused by overgrazing."132 Young also used civil tools to manage Utah's resources, and did so right from the start. During the first winter in the Utah Valley, he established a council to run the fledgling community (while he returned east to assist other caravans). The council "passed laws regulating the use of timber and water"?the first environmental laws of the Utah territory.133 "And They Had All Things Common Among Them "134 Young understood the limited nature of resources: "There are the elements that belong to this globe, and no more. [A]ll our commercial transactions must be confined to this little earth and its wealth cannot be increased or diminished."135 He also understood that limited resources 128.

His approach to managing these resources was to make them common property under Church control, thus limiting Mormon settlers' exploitative power to only as many resources as the Church gave them. Community property ownership was (and is) considered divine instruction to Mormons?known as "the law of consecration."136 Viewed as "the Lord's perfect economic program,"137 the practice began in Ohio within the first year of the Church's existence.138 Initiated to care for increasing numbers of poor converts,139 it worked simply: Church members gave title of their property to the Church, which then re-deeded property back to the members under orders to make the most of that property.140 In Young's view, those who did not utilize their lease on the land did not deserve to keep it. Reciting the foundational property law principle that land belongs in productive hands, he said "a man has no right with property, which, according to the laws of the land, legally belongs to him, if he does not want to use it... to do good to himself and his fellow-man."141 His declaration against property ownership was clear and firm: "Do not obey the lusts of the flesh, the lusts of the eye, and the groveling grasping after property."142 Instead, remember that "whatever you have, it is the Lord's. You own nothing, I on the Environment, in Brother Brigham, supra n. 17, at 38-39). 136. Originally, as discussed infra this section, the instruction was literal and explicit: Mormons were asked to give title to all property to the Church. The modern instruction is technically the same, but the level of personal sacrifice demanded is simply less. In other words, Mormons were and are asked simply to be willing and able to make such a sacrifice if asked: "The law of consecration is that we consecrate our time, our talents, and our money and property to the cause of the Church: such are to be available to the extent they are needed to further the Lord's interests on earth." Bruce R. McConkie, Obedience, Consecration, and Sacrifice, Ensign 50 (May 1975). Such complete sacrifice is not asked of modern Mormons simply because it is not needed any more: We are not always called upon to live the whole law of consecration and give all of our time, talents, and means to the building up of the Lord's earthly kingdom. Few of us are called upon to sacrifice much of what we possess, and at the moment there is only an occasional martyr in the cause of revealed religion. Id.

Young extended common property ownership beyond the land? water was controlled by the Church as well. Traditional riparian-rights were cast aside and "the water belonged to no one, and the flow of streams out of the mountains was parceled out to benefit the greatest number of people."144 Young administered the system as he did the land divisions?by putting local Church leaders in charge of irrigation projects. "[T]here were few precedents for them to go by. [T]he Mormons were the first in North America to try [irrigation] on a large scale and make it succeed."145 Development of arid-environment irrigation techniques would become one of Mormon settlers' greatest legacies.146 Disappointing Legacies: Consequences of Divine Rights and Subjugation Other environmental legacies of Young and the Mormon pioneers are less clear. One contemporary noted that We must not forget that these occupants hold themselves the Lord's stewards, who are bound to look after his interest, by making any unfruitful portion of the heritage produce food for his saints?[making the land] doubly theirs, by right divine and subjugation.147 The dual and conflicting nature of Mormons' view of their Wasatch oasis?that its resources were there both to preserve for future generations and to extract what was needed to generate that posterity? resulted in mixed, even detrimental, environmental results. The most public of Utah's modern environmental troubles is air pollution, a danger which Young preached against long before it became an issue: "[G]ood pure air is the greatest sustainer of animal life."148 143. Brigham Young, Journal of Discourses 10:298 (quoted in Hugh Nibley, Brigham Young on the Environment, in Brother Brigham, supra n. 17, at 33).

Salt Lake City had become the rival of Pittsburgh, Cincinnati, Chicago, and St. Louis as a smoke-plagued sinkhole,"152 and the mining and smelter industries had left scars on Utah's environment that the United States Environmental Protection Agency is still trying to remove.153 Despite his preaching against mining, Young himself could be blamed for other Utah environmental problems. One way he felt the Church members could repent from and minimize their impact on the earth was to increase biological diversity?"to beautify the whole face of the earth, until it shall become like the garden of Eden."154 To Young, this meant promoting importation of alien flora and fauna to the region, while at the same time urging protection of the species already there.155 The primary problem was that Mormons listened to Young's first suggestion, importing new crops and fauna, but did little to implement his second suggestion to protect habitats. Young is somewhat shielded from criticism because the ecological dangers of alien induction were not yet known; nevertheless, the results of his "beautification" were anything but beautiful, environmentally. The resulting alien boom and loss of native species eventually led to crop failures and major wildfire problems.156 In general, however, Mormon pioneers' environmental failings happened in spite of, not because of, Brigham Young.

With his death in 1877, "some measure of the communitarian utopia passed on as well."157 Private ownership of property was allowed even before he died, in approximately 1869.158 The territorial legislature soon granted county officials more independence in determining water use, and "[individual property rights in water rapidly replaced community need and the general welfare in the allocation of water rights."159 Overgrazing exploded across the undeveloped mountainsides.160 Young's aspirations of saintly environmental harmony seemingly disappeared with him. Although Utahans eventually saw the error of their ways and voted in 1902 to restrict access to the mountainsides, the damage to the watersheds had already been done and eventually resulted in serious flooding in the 1920s and '30s.161 Tension between farmers and wolf conservation activists was and remains thick.162 Despite Young's environmental leadership, despite his simple message?"We should love the earth"163?the balance between preservation and exploitation was one that early Mormons failed to find either under his tutelage or after his demise. 2.

Smoot (R-UT) was elected to the United States Senate in 1903, and served for thirty years.167 He was the only Church apostle to simultaneously serve as United States Senator, a duality that greatly upset his colleagues on Capitol Hill. Protestant politicians moved to exclude him from service because of it, subjecting him to four years of at-times wincingly bigoted Senate investigative hearings, but Smoot eventually prevailed.168 This attack did not damper Smoot's determination to tackle controversial issues, especially environmental ones, as he saw fit?party lines and regional loyalty be damned: [A] s a business-minded conservationist, Reed Smoot bucked the anger of legislators from surrounding western states . . . who wanted to destroy the Forest Service. Supporting Theodore Roosevelt's and Gifford Pinchot's programs of utilitarian conservation, Smoot promoted the establishment of national forests to protect watersheds and to regulate grazing and logging.169 Arguably learning from the mistakes of the pioneers of the previous generation, Smoot believed "that national forests offered necessary protection to . . . resources and to valuable watersheds," and dedicated much of his time in the Senate to federal land-use issues.170 He gained a reputation as a skillful and hard-working politician,171 and 165.

He became an apostle of the Church in 1943 and served under President Eisenhower as Secretary of Agriculture from 1953 to the end of the administration, thus becoming the second Church apostle to simultaneously serve in a major U.S. political capacity.173 Benson wore his faith on his sleeve, establishing a practice that all Cabinet meetings be started with a prayer.174 As part of his "General Statement on Agricultural Policy" he said, "The supreme test of any government policy, agricultural or other, should be 'How will it affect the character, morale, and well-being of our people?'"175 He gained notoriety for vociferously opposing agriculture subsidies despite heavy pressure to do so during plummeting prices post-World War II.176 Benson traveled the globe and was one of the most prominent agricultural agents of the twentieth century, even making the cover of Time magazine.177 He authored two influential books on American to promote an environmental agenda: [Wednesday, January 17, 1912:] The first meeting of [the Committee on] Public Lands was held since my appointment as Chairman.

Smoot and Benson thus serve as early examples of enviro-politically influential Mormons; we have even more examples today. The Modern Mormon Congress Mormons now comprise more than five percent of six states and at least one percent of fourteen others, making them more influential than ever before.180 But perhaps even more influential is the statistical overrepresentation of Mormons in the chambers of Capitol Hill. The five current Mormon Senators are all from the West, but run the gamut in political stripe.181 Dogmatic Harry Reid (D-NV) now serves as Majority leader,182 while ranking Judiciary Committee member Orrin Hatch (R-UT) enters his fourth decade of Senatorial service. books on the subject, including The Red Carpet (Bookcraft 1962), Title of Liberty (Deseret Bk.

The other two Senators are also Republicans: Bob Bennett (UT) and Mike Crapo (ID).183 Not one acknowledges his religion explicitly on his website?nor does any of the dozen Mormon members of the House. The extent to which their religion influences their voting is, of course, impossible to know, perhaps even by them. But glimpses into the views of Mormon politicians on the role of religion in environmental policy are possible. When he was asked whether Mormon teachings played any role in his views of environmental policy, Senator Bennett replied, simply, "Frankly, I had never given that any thought."184 He agreed that the Church has been muted on the subject, adding In all of my conversations with [Church leaders]?and the Church is my largest single constituent, so ... it is inevitable that I'm going to have a number of conversations with that constituent? it's never come up.185 In his own thoughtful search for a Mormon environmental ethic, Senator Bennett could only cite the scripture that inspired the title of this paper,186 summarizing its meaning for him as follows: The lord created the earth for man. The things that come out of the earth are for the use of man?for food, for raiment, for clothing, for shelter, and so on. That's it. There's no specific reference to use of the coal to stay warm or the iron ore to build buildings.187 He is left with less divine sources of inspiration for environmental policy specifics?like committee reports and his constituents. When they were asked to formulate the Mormon environmental ethic in their own words, Representatives Chris Cannon and Rob Bishop (R-UT) each immediately used the term "stewardship."188 "The purpose is to use the earth's resources, but do so wisely, without damaging the earth," Cannon said.189 As for the Church's involvement in environmental politicking, Bishop pointed out that the Church once made statements opposing the MX missile system and (more recently) nuclear fuel rod storage, but is much more reluctant to intervene 183.

Church leaders can't do that now." Citing a more specific example, he continued: Until 1985, Mormons ran every Utah irrigation project. Now we have different organizations running things. The Church would never say [today] "irrigate this way." It says "do what works best." We have more access now to information and expertise, so the Church doesn't need to get involved.191 Bennett, Cannon, and Bishop all thought Deseret192 culture plays a bigger role in their Mormon constituents' environmental leanings than does religion. "I find no difference in environmental attitudes between Mormons and non-Mormons, between Utahans and Idahoans, etc.," said Bennett. "The people who have a history in their families of working on the land have a visceral hatred for the environmental movement and vice versa."193 He added with a chuckle, "[such opinions] have nothing to do with whether or not they have a temple recommend. It's very strongly cultural."194 Many others have agreed with this assessment of the motivation behind western Mormon environmentalist thought. Mormon ranchers, loggers, and Forest Services employees echo the sentiment that ranchers are the true environmentalists.195 190. Interview with Representative Rob Bishop, supra n. 83. 191.

Bennett passionately added the following anecdotes of farming constituents: I was startled to have a group of Utah constituents, mainly women, who came back here to lobby against some of the environmental proposals coming out of the Clinton administration, saying "this is affecting our livelihoods, this is affecting our homes . . . ." They were told in another office (obviously not a western senator), "You have no right to live on that land. We're delighted to hear that our policies are driving you bankrupt and that you will be forced to move to a city where you belong." I've quoted often ... the statement that occurred to me early in my campaign ... in Monticello. I was having dinner with a group of activists. ... As we were walking out, one of the women said "Bob, look around. What do you see?" I hadn't the slightest idea what she was talking about, so I look around. She said "It's pristine, isn't it?"

This is true both of Utah specific legislation and national environmental programs.199 Such a critique may or may not be accurate, but whether Mormon lawmakers back the best environmental laws or fight against them it is doubtful their faith provides the primary impetus.

After serving as Utah's Governor for several terms, Leavitt served as Administrator of the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) from late 2003 until mid-2005.200 The Administration that appointed him praised his successes.201 Leavitt argued that his cap-and-trade acid rain program had reduced pollution some six million tons.202 Not everyone was so positive, of course. Some environmental groups complained that he was too lax in prosecuting environmental lawbreakers.203 However, Leavitt was far less criticized by environmentalists than many previous Republican EPA Administrators (and certainly less hated than the Bush Administration that appointed him). The Clean Air Diesel proposal, in particular, represented a breath of fresh air to downtrodden environmentalists who had been fighting uphill battles for years.204 Leavitt accomplished this spirit of comity with good politicking, and developed a reputation for having an open ear and mind.205 People working under Leavitt also 200. On a personal note, I attended the same congregation as Mr. Leavitt on a few occasions during my first year of law school. I did not know him well, however, and only spoke with him briefly, on one occasion. 201.

News BI (Nov. 16. 2004). 204. Amazingly, the new regulations, signed by Leavitt. . . , pleased nearly everyone. Environmental groups and manufacturers of diesel engines are both happy. The oil industry and state air pollution control authorities are equally gladdened. The EPA deserves high praise for this accomplishment. Opinion, Diesel Emission Rules Are Breath of Fresh Air, The Republican A8 (May 12, 2004). 205. One commentator described the process leading to the Clean Air Diesel Proposal and praised Leavitt: What officials did was to invite everyone into the room and ask them what they wanted. That's unusual enough these days. Then they went one step further. They actually listened. Environmental groups wanted the amount of sulfur in diesel fuel greatly reduced. The oil industry and engine manufacturers said they could accomplish that, but not as quickly as the environmentalists desired. So a compromise was worked out. The resultant decrease in pollution will save an estimated 12,000 lives each year. [It will</page><page sequence="38">710 JOURNAL OF LAW &amp; RELIGION [Vol. XXIII appreciated this approach.206 Although it was generally known that Leavitt was Mormon, he did not often discuss religion at work, at least not in the context of environmental policy. He also appeared to draw from his western heritage more than his religion: "Everything he spoke about was in keeping with the viewpoint of the Republican administration, coupled with his deep respect for the environment being from the West (and possibly because of his religion)."207 Leavitt accomplished much in his brief tenure at the EPA, successfully negotiating with environmental groups while unflinchingly backing the Bush Administration. Whatever his environmental legacy will be, "Leavitt conveyed a passion for the environment that was infectious. Whether that was due to his religion or not, I could not say."208 Another passionate Mormon and former Governor has also gained prominence recently after running for the 2008 presidency: Mitt Romney. Commentators had contemplated his run for years and asked "Are we ready for a Mormon President?"209 The resounding answer was no.210 Nationwide polls in 2006 declared that thirty-seven percent of Americans would not vote for a Mormon; towards the end of Romney's campaign, that fraction rose to half.211 Romney's detractors repeatedly tried to use his faith negatively,212 and Romney spent significant energy also] cut by 6,000 the number of asthma-related hospital visits by children and will result in 15,000 fewer heart attacks annually.

If you bring people together and listen to them, you might actually manage to clear the air. Id. 206. As one former EPA employee put it, there was a general sense at EPA while Leavitt was Administrator that it was a very positive place to work, that Leavitt truly enjoyed working on the environmental issues, and that we were doing something good for the environment?regardless of whether [we] agreed with [President] Bush's environmental policy.

What would this Mormon have done as President to protect it?214 Romney threw off some of his early political critics by beginning his gubernatorial campaign with a seemingly strong environmental ethic. He promised "to make it more difficult for developers to gobble up these green spaces."215 Even more surprising to Massachusetts lawmakers was his choice to fill the newly-created position over state transportation, housing, and environmental issues (Chief of Commonwealth Development): with left-leaning independent environmentalist Doug Foy.216 The "unprecedented" move to place a well-known environmental advocate in a development office was praised by environmentalists as a clear sign of Romney's intent to buck Beacon Hill cronyism.217 His time as Governor gave evidence for both pro- and anti environmental predictions. While Romney said he was "unsure whether climate change is occurring and whether human activity is causing it," he preferred to play it safe and err on the side of overprotection with his Climate Protection Plan: "If climate change is happening, the actions we take will help," Romney wrote: If climate change is largely caused by human action, this will really help. If we learn decades from now that climate change isn't happening, these actions will still help our economy, our quality of life, and the quality of our environment.218 The Plan's goals were similar to those of the Kyoto Protocol, but the methodology involved primarily voluntary and cooperative efforts, 213.

During his presidential campaign, he repeatedly remarked that he believed that climate change was real and that human activity is probably contributing to it.222 Other environmental issues cropped up during Romney's tenure and campaign, and though his response has not always been viewed by environmentalists with applause, it is clear he is thoughtful about the issues.223 What is certainly not clear is to what extent Romney's environmental policy stemmed from his religion. Romney publicly stressed that his duty lies to his constituents first and foremost, attempting to mollify detractors by promising that "the requirements of his faith would never overcome his political obligations."224 The Church has been outspoken in the same vein for over a century. Romney's situation was nothing new. Joseph Smith's nephew, Joseph F. Smith, was called to testify during the abovementioned Senator Smoot hearings. Then the sixth president of the Church, Smith was asked repeatedly whether Smoot would be obligated to follow his (Smith's?the prophet's) commands. Smith replied that Smoot's only obligation was to his conscience and to his constituency.

The Church's position has remained so ever since.226 Romney, like every Mormon in public service, must make his own decisions. Mormons, environmentalists, and Mormon environmentalists should try to carefully determine how every politician (Mormon or not) would shape America's environmental policy?whether that policy would be guided by that person's religion explicitly, implicitly, or not at all.227 But the Church is now truly a global religion, and Mormon citizens make such decisions in democratic nations across the world.

International Environmental Potential: a Polynesian Case Study "[T]he gospel [shall] roll forth unto the ends of the earth, as the stone which is cut out of the mountain without hands shall roll forth, until it has filled the whole earth."228 Building Island Mormons Unbeknownst to many Americans, there is an astonishingly large faction of Mormons in Polynesia. The three highest national concentrations of Mormons in the world are Tonga (forty-six percent), Samoa (thirty-six percent), and American Samoa (over twenty-four percent)?staggering numbers compared to America's two percent.229 A half-dozen other Pacific-island nations have populations that are at least seven percent Mormon.230 The potential impact of Mormons on environmental laws is therefore that much greater in this region of the earth.

For example, for several years after missionaries first arrived, King Kamehameha V of Hawaii refused to allow the Church to establish a colony there; relations healed after Church missionaries continued to serve the people and showed no hostility.232 The translation of still developing Mormon environmental doctrine and practices to an island culture led to doctrinal dilemmas as well. There was some concern of missionaries, for example, "[a]mong the Tuamotuan Saints, [where] there had arisen 'much contention' over the 'practice of eating dogs,'" and whether it could be squared with the Word of Wisdom.233 Such disputes occasionally escalated into serious rifts between local Church leaders and their new congregations.234 In general, however, the missionaries had great success. Although it may seem strange that a brand-new American religion could so quickly penetrate such a radically different culture, one must remember that Mormons were not the first Christian missionaries to visit the islands; much of the progression (or penetration, depending on one's perspective) of Polynesian culture had happened prior to the Mormons' arrival.235 A Shared Environmental Ethic One reason posited for the success of the missionary effort was that, on a fundamental level, the environmental ethics of the two cultures seemed to fall hand-in-hand. "Maori belief in a lively and present interaction between the spiritual and natural realms" found no home in "[t]he [traditional] Christian rationalism of the Pakeha [non-native], which downplayed, if not denied, such interactions."236 Mormonism, on the other hand, was more congruent to Maori tradition: "Latter-day Saint missionaries to Aotearoa encountered a people every bit as believing and accustomed to spiritual [-nature] experience as they were."237 231.

Polynesian [Latter-day] Saints feel a depth of connection, a sense of belonging as members of the . . . Church. [T]he restored gospel confirms traditional cultural beliefs in the connection between heaven and earth, spiritual and physical existences.238 One Mormon Hawaiian scholar further explicates this link: Mormons are uniquely qualified to appreciate the deep ties which bind native Hawaiians to their land and culture. . . . God is both the Gardener and the mana or life force that fills the garden. For an Hawaiian, then, communion with God entails reverence for one's garden paradise or land, for land is life, and Hawaiians are kama'aina, children of the land.239 In the scholar's opinion, however, despite the Mormon faith's environmental ethic, "[f]or most haole [non-native] Mormons,. . . land lacks sacred qualities and God is strictly a Gardener . . . ."240 He argues a stronger link between the two is needed for non-island Mormons. Environmental Policy in a Mormon Polynesia Has the fact that Polynesians took to Mormonism?which they called "a nature-friendly religion"241?played any role in environmental policy? This is a difficult question, primarily because the Church was present long before environmental laws and treaties were common, and certainly before the term "comparative environmental law" was coined. Polynesians have long practiced resource management, and such "[traditional management practices were either related to some religious or superstitious beliefs, or were clearly intended to conserve resources" since before Mormons arrived.242 Various historical conservation practices included land and reef tenure systems; "taboos" or quotas on certain species, seasons, and habitats; and soil replenishment techniques.243 Pacific islanders did not run environmental utopias, 238.

"[T]he traditional Pacific way of life incorporated aspects of both exploitation and conservation," and Polynesians were at times "forced to develop response measures to correct the ecological imbalances that they had caused."244 Still, islanders sustained a relatively "delicate balance between humans and nature . . . prior to Western influence."245 Although individual island-nations have always had these traditions, modern environmental policy really began in Polynesia as a united, regional venture: first with a collective Forum Fisheries Agency in 1979, and then with the South Pacific Regional Environment Program in 1982.246 This was really the only way to operate: "Notwithstanding the diversity of the region, environmental problems confronting the Asia-Pacific region are of such magnitude that greater cooperation is inevitable."247 By the time Mormons arrived in Polynesia, the whaling industry and other Christian missionaries had solidified colonization as the future of the South Pacific; in fact, it had already begun.248 Mormons gained political influence in the islands, some held quite significant positions.249 Still, whether because Polynesians saw Mormons as bringing nothing new to the environmental-policy table or for some other reason, there was no discernable environmental effect from the wave of Mormon conversion. And nowadays, even if there were some effect of doctrine on the substantial Mormon electorate, it would likely be diluted and obscured by the multinational nature of the environmental policies. Islanders of Influence No matter the influence of the masses, some individual Mormons have gained notoriety as influential Polynesian environmentalists.

Cox is not shy about his faith's influence on his work: As a young boy, I prayed that God would protect the plants and animals of the world. I realized that a lot of the plants and animals in wild settings had no voice or protection. So, what became prayers of a young boy become a guiding focus of my work now.251 Cox's activism has been of intense personal dedication and sacrifice: He offered to sell his home and car to raise money for a new school so the village of Falealupo, Western Samoa would not have to sell 12,000 hectares of rain forest. He even "ran several kilometers down the road, machete in hand, and chased the loggers away" to convince village chiefs of his sincerity.252 Cox was later awarded the international Goldman Environmental Prize for his efforts, was a dean at Church sponsored Brigham Young University;253 founded the primary island preservation organization,254 and is now one of the world's preeminent experts in ethnobotany.255 Does his faith continue to guide his efforts? When asked, he says, simply, "As a devout Mormon . . . [my] work is based on the belief that all life is sacred."256 Another notable Polynesian Mormon of influence is United States Congressman Eni F.H. Faleomavaega, the Democratic delegate from American Samoa.257 Serving in his position since 1988, Faleomavaega sits on the Fisheries Conservation, Wildlife and Oceans and Energy and Mineral Resources Subcommittees, and is the ranking Democrat on the House Committee on International Relations.258 He has taken a lead on 250.

With such a large population of Mormons, being a Church member also has important secondary social and political benefits.261 In some cases, the religious bond is even stronger than the cultural. As one Mormon Samoan college student said, "The stake president [a regional Church leader] has as much, if not more, prestige than a [political] chief."262 Thus, the Church certainly has the potential to greatly influence environmental policies of the region. Other religions in Polynesia already do so: [C]hurches are some of the most influential authorities in Pacific Island communities. Condemnation of nuclear testing, toxic waste dumping, and incineration of chemical munitions by a body such as the Pacific Conference of Churches [of which the Mormon Church is not a member] strongly influences most Pacific Islanders because of the respect accorded religious leaders. Thus, the involvement of [a] church as a powerful environmental advocate is probably one of the most important means of increasing public awareness and activating local groups to participate in preserving the South Pacific environment.2 3 The Mormon Church has not followed suit, at least on a large scale. Given the particular power of religion over Polynesian policy, a greater potential exists for application of Mormon environmental doctrine on the South Pacific environs. Perhaps Mormons there and around the world should make their voices heard and do more towards this end. 2, 2008). 259. H.R. 4788 (2006). 260. H.Res 692 (2006); H.Res 905 (2006). 261.

Imagine what the LDS Church could accomplish if it became an advocate of environmental protection."264 Two things have hopefully been made clear by this paper. First, there is a strong environmental ethic running through much of the Mormon faith. Second, Mormons have an obligation to implement this ethic in their communities. Church members have interpreted this obligation of effectuation in dramatically different ways, but, if nothing else, it is at least an obligation to vote for laws that improve the human and environmental condition. Sacred and Secular Responsibilities "Mormonism, like all religious traditions, struggles to live up to its highest ideals, but... an environmental ethic is prevalent in virtually every corner of LDS revelations and scriptures."265 Mormons believe their link with nature to be one that began before the world was and will continue into the next life. This link constitutes a stewardship over the earth, a dominion that must be exercised with righteousness.266 This stewardship extends to one's relationship with plant, animal, self and the global ecosystem. A failure to properly exercise this stewardship could be penalized in the next life, when the time comes for Mormons to utilize a perfected earth and to create and manage worlds of their own. The way to exercise this stewardship must be through the implementation of environmental policies. The Church's frequent reminders to be active in politics and to be "anxiously engaged in a good cause" have at times explicitly included environmental activism?if they hadn't, the environmental doctrines of the faith would be mere platitudes. Mormons are therefore urged to carry their doctrines to the ends of the earth and change all of it for the better, both its people and its environments. A Call to Action Mormons are aware of these environmental doctrines but have been 264. Woodruff, supra n. 251. 265.

In part, this is natural. "Almost invariably, the practices [of a theology] fall short of the ideals," and environmental practices are no exception.267 Mormons have internalized and activated some of this ethic?they follow a code of healthy living, they preach garden-growing?but this superficial morality has never fully developed into a broad-based Mormon culture of conservationism. This is especially disappointing, considering the potential. Whether viewed as a culture or religion, Mormons (like all cohorts of their size) "have an influence over elected officials, public servants, and the general acceptance of actions taking place in [their] world,"268 yet they have generally failed to use this influence for the benefit of the environment. One study found that the average Mormon citizen is actually more concerned for the environment than the average non-Mormon.269 However, the study also found that Mormons are less likely to be willing to act upon that concern by monetarily supporting the environment (either through environmental taxes or directly to environmental groups).270 Mormons can obviously do a better job of fulfilling both aspects of their charge of stewardship. Concern without more is moot and contrary to Church urgings of active political involvement and support of worthy causes. Other Christian religions have similar messages of active involvement in environmental causes, yet many have taken theirs farther than the Mormon Church. The United Church of Christ has taken a leadership role in the environmental justice movement.271 The Presbyterian Church has strongly urged its adherents to become carbon neutral in order to stem climate change.272 The World Council of Churches, representing nearly a half a billion Christians, has been outspoken and omnipresent at environmental debates at the national and international level for decades.273 Yet the Mormon Church remains officially silent, offering no explicit instruction on the specific policy mechanisms Church members should choose to carry out the 267.

This does not appear likely to change soon,275 leaving Church members to apply the Mormon environmental ethic without formal policy guidance. Many Mormons, particularly in the west, have displayed a "natural tendency to balk at the concept[] of legislated wilderness" in so interpreting.276 Yet this tendency did not exist in some historical Mormon lawmakers: [T]he modern "wise use" movement would undoubtedly shun [early twentieth-century Utah politician Sylvester] Cannon's vision, which included heavy doses of governmental regulation, land purchases by the federal government, and strong limits on the use of private property.277 Many modern Mormons would likely pooh-pooh water and land rationing as established by Brigham Young,278 or the curtailment of 274. The modern Church's tertiary business and charitable efforts do not give any more guidance. One example one might review, though still ambiguous, would be the Church's choice to provide disaster aid to tsunami victims in 2006 by replacing their fishing equipment, rather than by some other, arguably more eco-friendly support. See Fishermen Return to Sea After Church Donation, press release (Oct. 19, 2006), http://www.lds.0rg/ldsnewsroom/v/index.jsp?vgnextoid= 81 d522526078ft&gt; 10 Vgn VCM100000176f620aRCRD&amp;vgnextchannel-9ae411154963d010 Vgn VC M1000004e94610aRCRD (accessed Feb. 2, 2008). 275. I cannot, of course, predict the course Mormon leaders will steer. The Mormon congressmen interviewed all predicted that the Church would never (or at least not soon) make any statement on environmental issues, much less urge a course of action. Interviews with Senator Bob Bennett, Representative Rob Bishop, and Representative Chris Cannon, supra n.83. The Church was under intense social pressure during the early twentieth century (as were all religions of the era) to make an official statement regarding evolution. After much debate, including among Church leaders, the Church released official statements on the issue in 1909 and 1925?which were carefully worded and remarkably ambiguous, especially considering the fiery anti-evolution statements of many religious leaders at the time. See William E. Evenson &amp; Duane E. Jeffery, Mormonism and Evolution: The Authoritative LDS Statements 13-25, 29-33 (Kofford Books 2005). If the rugged men who led the Church in 1909 could find such restraint during that volatile debate, it seems to me unlikely that modern leaders will begin an outspoken crusade against pollution. Nevertheless, the Church has responded and I predict will continue to respond to what it perceives as theological threats. An affirmative example was the release of an official, even canonized, statement, The Family: A Proclamation to the World, explicitly in response to a perceived deterioration of the family (and clearly in response to loosened sexual mores, same-sex marriage movements, and abortion). See generally Henry B. Eyring, The Family, Ensign 10 (Feb. 1998) (discussing each paragraph of the Proclamation). A negative example was the retraction of the practice of polygamy in 1890, which, although purportedly divinely inspired, was surely in part a response to explicit threats from the United States. See Note, Elizabeth Harmer-Dionne, Once a Peculiar People: Cognitive Dissonance and the Suppression of Mormon Polygamy as a Case Study Negating the Belief-Action Distinction, 50 Stan. L. Rev. 1295 (1998) (arguing that the criminalization of polygamy effectively forced a change in Mormon belief). Only time will tell whether an environmental issue could rise to such a level in the Mormon leadership's eyes. 276. Hafen, supra n. 196, at 23. 277. Alexander, supra n. 165. 278.

Striking such a balance is always a difficult challenge, and everyone?even those following the same underlying doctrines?will strike a different balance. The conflicting roles of the Mormon environmentalist are evinced in the many examples of Mormons exercising influence over the environment and balancing its regulation in vastly different ways. One should be cognizant of this variation before criticizing any Mormon as either too pro- or anti environmental, as has so often occurred.282 While acknowledging that a variety of balances may be struck, however, I believe that most Mormons have not even thought about the balance at all.283 I do not presume to say Mormons should strike a better balance. I do not need to say this; the doctrine is sufficient that if Mormons but stop to consider the balance in the first place, we will be well on our way to exercising proper stewardship. As another Mormon environmentalist once said, "I retain the na?ve belief that the more of us who seek to engage the question of what constitutes right living in relationship toward God's creation, the more likely we are as a human family to be wise stewards."284 Some Mormons have considered that question and achieved a better balance by promoting environmentally conscious policies?to use the earth's resources, but to do so "with judgment, not to excess."285 All should so act: "Individual Church members . . . need to become involved in local, state, and national environmental issues and exercise their agency as stewards."286 Only by 279.
