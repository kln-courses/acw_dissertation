CROSS-CULTURAL APPROACH Z. A. ALOIANE (Budapest) Since demonology has been rooted in the animistic Past, it includes a respective system of images, forms and practical actions. The most characteristic of primi- tive religion and the best for the comparison of demoniac superstitions in Islam and other faiths are morphological types of evil forces. The morphological types refer to the following images: anthropomorphic, zoomorphic, anthropozoomorphic, zeromorphic (incorporeal), and amorphic (in- definite). The different nature of the jinn was expressed by the Prophet either. According to one of the hadiths , Muhammad indicated on three kinds of the jinn as they were created by God: crawling beings, including snakes, spirits like wind in the air, and the jinn who look like sons of Adam.1 Due to the constant borrowings, innovations and contradictory changes occurring throughout the whole of Islamic history, three of these types appear to be more clearly represented. These are: amorphism, anthropomorphism, and zoomorphism. We believe that anthropomorphism, which is examined in the present paper, shows the cross-cultural nature of the Islamic pandemonium in a more systematic and historically founded way. Keeping in mind the famous warning of the Russian classical writer that 'nobody can fill immensity', not all of the religions and cultures chosen for parallels take an equal place in the present paper. On the philosophical level anthropomorphism has advantages over other kinds of representations. We believe that the remark made by J. Duchesne- Guillemin on a late Zoroastrian example has a general application. When speak- ing of anthropomorphic images of Ahriman in Pahlavi texts, the scholar noted: "The moralistic conception tended to reduce man's struggle with Ahriman to a spiritual combat within his own soul portraits of Ahriman in human shape".2 1 Fawwaz 'U., 'Alam al- jinn fi zaw' al-Kitab wa-s-Sunna [The World of the Jinn in the Light of the Book and the Sunna].

ALOIANE The Bogomilian Tainata Kniga contains the same idea telling that Satan created man in his own image.3 From the first look, Dostoevsky's hero says an opposite thing, that is, that "man created the Devil in his own image and likeness".4 Nevertheless, essen- tially this is the expression of the idea of combat between Evil and Virtue within human soul, which has been depicted in mythology as anthropomorphic demons. Presumably, some demons were indeed 'underdeveloped' spirits. As it has been indicated by many scholars, the jinn as such are transportation of the pre- Islamic spirits which surrounded the Bedouin in his everyday life. This appears to be an echo of animistic beliefs, which still is an essential element in many popular superstitions. Since social life of ancient people was strictly concen- trated in clans and amongst kinsmen, this idea was applied to the jinn either. Therefore, the world of the jinn in the mind of the desert Arabs echoed their own in its organization. These demons were united in tribes with tribal laws and names, such as Shaisaban, Banu Ghanam, Banu Ghazwan, 'Asl, 'Usr, Shakk. The medieval authors also inform us of their chieftains. In the hadiths the Prophet mentions 15 tribes of the jinn. Moreover, two of those tribes were said to have listened to Muhammad reading the Qur'an at night.5 One has to distinguish the two phenomena, that is, anthropomorphism and the demonization of humans. Anthropomorphism is a human representation, per- sonification or emanation of Evil. It is a different thing to view a man or a group of men as influenced by demons and thus indirect evil-doers. The latter usually happens as a result of temptation or human intercourse with demons. Such a con- tact, taking place either voluntarily, or under compulsion, leads to similar conse- quences. From the text of the Qur'an it is not clear which of these two, anthropo- morphism or demonization of humans, is meant while speaking of the shaiatin amongst men and the positive jinn who follow one of three monotheistic religions: "Thus have We appointed unto every Prophet an adversary - shaiatin of humankind and jinn who inspire in one another plausible discourse through guile. If thy Lord willed, they would not do so; so leave them alone with their devising" (6. 1 12).6 However, on the ground of Islamic tradition and other Near Eastern cul- tures some elements should be clarified. The shaiatin of humankind and the jinn were examined by many Muslim authors. Summarising their opinions and the linguistic semantics of this expres- 3 J. Ivanov, Bogomilski knigi i legendi. Ed. by D.

Sometimes, such persons were connected with demoniac world by their origin. As it is well-known, the idea of possibility for humans and demons to copulate with each other has a long history. Thus, according to the Kabbalah, male demons, the incubi , copulate with women, whereas the female succubi cohabit with men.8 In Islam there were even marriages between these two of God's creations. As late as the early 20th century the famous al-Azhar Univer- sity at Cairo issued books discussing the juridical questions concerning such marriages. Although the theologians disapproved this, they could not find direct prohibitions in the Qur'an and hadiths. The difference between Islamic and Judeo-Christian understanding of the sexual contacts between humans and demons was the following. While intercourse with the incubi and succubi gave a birth to Cain , monsters, and demons, the offspring of a ymra'-human pair were predominantly talented people and great historical personalities.9 Thus, part of the shaiatin of humankind could have been seen as begotten by demons. In general, the viewing demoniac beings in human shape was not new in the history of ideas. Although we do not state the Islamic simplification of certain Zoroastrian-Manichaean concepts, the following quotation may not be senseless. The passage from the Zoroastrian book Minu Khrad composed in the first centuries A. D. introduces us to the classification of all humans: "A man is that who is undoubtful of the creati veness of Hormezd (Ahura Mazda), and the destructiveness of Aharman (Ahriman), and the existence of the resurrection... and his belief is in one, pure, good religion of the Mazdayasnians (Zoroastrians)... A semi-man is that who performs the affairs of the world and the spirit, by his own desire. . . be it the duties and good works which are the will of Hormezd , and be it what is by the will of Aharman... A semi-demon is that, in whom is only the name of humanity and the human race, otherwise in very deed and action he is like a two-legged demon; he understands no world, and no spirit; he understands no heaven, and no hell; and he also considers not the accountability which is on the soul".10 7 Fawwaz, op. cit., 76. In Christianity people with similar features were regarded not as anthropomorphic demons, but as possessed by evil forces. See: Orlov M. A., Istorija snošenij čeloveka s d'javolom.

ALOIANE This division of the people is supposed to affect the Manichaean classifi- cation of mankind into the Elect, Hearers, and Sinners.11 We believe that such a kind of people could have indirectly become related to the Islamic concept, belonging to one great 'supercultural' region of the Middle East. Although there are no proved facts of influence, the following scheme illustrates parallels in anthropomorphic concepts: Zoroastrianism: MEN SEMI-MEN SEMI-DEMONS I I I Manichaeism: ELECT HEARERS SINNERS I I I Islam: BELIEVERS NON-BEUEVERS SHAIATIN AMONGST HUMANKIND With regard to the demonization of humans, which is the shaiatin s entry, there are several ways and consequences of this. The linguistic description of this fact is the word majnun, which may be translated as 'possessed by the jinn', then - 'mad'. In this case the terms shaiatin and jinn are interchangeable, since an artificial word from the not purely Arabic word shaiatin could sound very heavy.12 Epilepsy was seen by the Muslim scholars as an obvious evidence of the shaiatin' s or jinn's entry. Even the Mutazilite author 'Abd al-Jabar al-Hamadani was prone to agree with such explanation made at different times by at-Tabari, al-Qurtubi, Ibn Kathira and others. This concept concerning the nature of epilepsy was in general composed by the famous medieval philosopher Ibn Taymiya and his disciple Ibn al-Qayim. They systematised the information provided in the shari'a and the arguments of Imam Ahmad b. Hanbal and his son 'Abdallah. Thus, the following expression of the Prophet also was taken into consideration: "ash-Shaitan steps through the human body by the bloodstream". Two essential points which here should be mentioned are the grounding of the concept of epilepsy on the Gospel, and the incorporeal image of demons entering human flesh.13 The word majnun is, probably, the best of all these known from the Arabic, Persian, Kurdish, and Turkic literatures due to the famous Majnun who fell into boundless love with Layla/Leyli. The view that extreme love was pri- marily by the Arabs understood as an abnormal, unusual and extraordinary phe- nomenon, then as a kind of demonization of humans, is never expressed as such, 1 1 Ibid. The following early Zoroastrian human identification with demons had not direct impact on the further religious thought. That is the Avestan idea that homosexual men were equated with the daevas (Vd. VIII, 26, 27). 12 To the best of our judgement, the most complete expression of the covert idea of majnun are two Russian equivalents, besnovaty (from the word bes) and oderiimy ('possessed'), as well as a common Iranian analogue dtwane (from diw). 13 U. Fawwaz gives the detailed story of the nature of this disaster (Fawwaz, op. cit., 255- 258). Acta Orient. Hung. XUX. 1996</page><page sequence="5">ANTHROPOMORPHIC REPRESENTATION OF EVIL IN ISLAM 427 but is always implied. Since the Arabs could not explain love in a rational way, they saw in it the influence of supernatural forces. This standpoint appears to be put in the framework of the general belief in the demoniac cause of extraordi- nary events and phenomena. One must be careful in linking such an Arabic explanation with the early Christian outlook that human love is the inspiration of the Devil aimed to destroy confession. Thus, even if the results in the Arabo- Islamic and Christian cases are similar, that is, the demoniac nature of human love, the processes evolved in different ways. The fact is that Christianity "condemned flesh, and covered love with shame... the act of love, personified in Hellenism by the brightest and the most handsome deities, was declared by Christianity as a noxious vileness..."14 In addition, Islam never approved celi- bacy as an act of pure confession. The other element, the shaiatin' s inspiration of adultery, later came into existence, and this does not deal with the origin of viewpoint concerning love. The following example is poetry and soothsaying. According to the view- point of the jahiliya, poets (sha'ir, PI. shu'ara') and popular soothsayers (kahin, PI. kuhhan, kuhana ) are close to each other in the sense of the shaiatin' s inspiration. These two kinds of contacts with supernatural forces served as an accusation against the Prophet's sermon. The Meccan nobility sceptically asked: "Shall we forsake our gods for a mad poet?" (37. 35/36).' 5 That is why Muhammad many times denied that he was either possessed by demons, a poet, or a soothsayer (21. 5; 26. 221-224; 52. 29; 68. 2; 69. 38-42; 81. 19, 22, 25). 16 Undoubtedly, the fact that such a popular amongst the Arabs phenomenon as poetry could have a demoniac nature, underlines the complicated nature of the demonological issue. This viewpoint remained long after settlement of the normative Islamic outlook. Thus, the poet Jarir wrote: "On the days, when because of my love poems the people call me ash- Shaitan The girls love me so passionately, as if I indeed were ash-Shaitan" .17 The general explanation here could be that the extraordinary abilities of falling into love, of soothsayers, and of poets in the eyes of 'normal' or rather 'ordi- nary' people were caused by their contact with supernatural, chiefly evil, forces.18 14 Amfiteatrov, op. cit., 94. 15 In Arabic li sha'irin majnunin ('for a mad poet') . See also: 52. 30. 16 It is interesting that Slavic demonology knew the soothsaying demon Veshchy. See: T. Wróblewski Démony. In: Sfownik Starozytnošci Siowianskich. Vol. I. Ed. W. Kowalenko, G. Labuda, andT. Lehr-Splawinski. Wroclaw 1962, 336. 17 Fawwaz, op. cit., 76, 464. 18 No doubt that the following statement deals with a very different period and cultural background. However, typologically comparative understanding of extraordinary man was shared Acta Orient. Hung. XUX, 1996</page><page sequence="6">428 Z. A. ALOIANE Essentially the demoniac character of poetical and soothsaying abilities can be considered together with the old view of the nature of arts and beauty.19 From the examples of different cultural systems we can choose three. The first is from Kurdish folklore. The greatest epos Mem û Zîn is said to be recounted by the assembly of the jinn : by the order of their mír (chief), the musician demons sing this story.20 The second example is as follows. While describing the desert Lop, full of evil spirits, in the Turkic land, Marco Polo mentioned musical sounds in the air.21 Besides, it was said that in Norway, in the river called 'Black', evil spirits presage the death of a nobleman by playing on musical instruments.22 Thus, the shaiatin amongst humankind refer to either the anthropomorphic demons, or to the people inspired by evil spirits. A different situation occurs in the case of the jinn who, according to Islam, have a choice to adopt one of the three monotheistic religions, or to stay infidels (46. 28/29-31/32; 72. 1-17). These jinn in addition to their right to choose a religion also could, within Islam, belong to different madhahib (Sg. madhhab, 'school').23 Generally, the idea of good, or at least non-harmful, demons is known in many traditions. Thus, the Roman genie, which could have been prototypes for the jinn, were both good and evil. Amongst other possible examples we may indicate less known forest and some house demons of Northern Russian superstitions, which also have 'positive' images.24 Moreover, even evil forces sometimes could be patrons of some territories and professional groups, as it took place in Taiwan. There, the deities of epidemics and disasters, Van' e (the 'Honoured Lords'), combined divine and demoniac elements.25 Nevertheless, the concept of humankind jinn in Islam goes beyond the superstition of good demons. The interpretation made by some scholars suggests that the information of the jinn who follow a religion and a madhhab, and to whom the Prophet read the Qur'an, refers to foreigners. Thus, M. M. Pickthall describes the jinn in sura by Fyodor Dostoevsky. For him, as for Friedrich Nietzsche, extraordinary man or overman is moved behind the others by will. But while Nietzsche's will to power is the source of liberation, Dostoevsky situated in this isolating vitalistic dynamism the origin of evil. (Stoeber, op. cit., 27-28). Moreover, in the modern Jewish religious philosophy, will to power is characterised as a 'radical evil'. See: Seeskin, K. R., The Perfection of God and the Presence of Evil. In: Judaism. A Quarterly Journal of Jewish Life and Thought 31 (1982) 210. 19 There should be differentiation between this idea and the role of religious and demoniac images in the development of arts and science. 20 Zargotina K'urda.

M. Pickthall writes: "The meaning of the word jinn in the Koran has exercised the minds of Muslim commentators, ancient and modern. Mr. Ya'qub Hasan of Madras, in the first volume' of a remarkable work in Urdu, Kitabu ' l-Huda , shows that it has at least three meanings in the Koran and that one of those meanings is something akin to 'clever foreigners' as in the case of the Jinn who worked for Solomon. But undoubtedly the first and obvious meaning is 'elemental spirits' . . ."28 In order to analyse this comment which covers the whole subject of the anthropomorphic jinn we have to underline three major connotations of the term: - 'elemental spirits'; - 'foreigners'; - 'clever foreigners', i.e. non-Arabian Jews. The correlations between natural spirits and foreigners was revealed by R. Smith. The scholar verified that the jinn as spirits were outsiders of a tribe, a tribal coalition, or a group of Bedouins. Therefore, in conformity with the desert law they were viewed as enemies.29 Consequently, the elemental spirits and foreigners had a common essence as outsiders in social life. Furthermore, the foreigners are supposed to speak different languages. That is why Melek-e Taus ('The Peacock Angel'), which is worshipped by the Yezidi Kurds and which possesses another name, Jin Teyar ('The Flying Jinn'), knows 72 languages.30 The Mandaean demons also are good linguists, and the Sacred Book Ginza Rba says: "The King of Darkness knows all the languages in the Universe".31 The Kephalaia gives us the similar information on the King of Darkness, who understands the speeches and languages of his five worlds.32 To the same typological paradigm belongs the sudden knowledge of previously unknown languages in medieval Europe, which was blamed on contacts with the Devil.33 In summary, this capability of demoniac beings and their Master should 26 Holy Qur'an, op. cit., 242, ff. 27 Ibid., 330, ff. 28 Ibid., 386, introd. to 72. 29 Yakimovich, op. cit., 20. 30 The number corresponds with the traditional accounting of peoples: 70 in the Old Testament, 72 in Islamic tradition, and 72 plus the Yezidis in the respective view. Besides, the Yezidi Kurds have the main appeal: "Let God be helpful to 72 nations, and then to us, Yezidis". 31 E. S. Drower, The Mandaeans of Iraq and Iran.

ALOIANE not be isolated from the system of features common to both God and His Adversary.34 Furthermore, these foreigners, besides linguistic talent should have knowl- edge of other things which the insiders lack. Thus, we can reconstruct the following chain: Spirit -) Outsider - &gt; Clever Foreigner Thereafter, even being clever, outsiders often come as foes. This gave birth to the identification of demons with hostile people. The following exam- ples relate to Islamic history. The Ahl-e Haqq Kurds having partly Shi' ite background shared their hatred for those whom they defined as usurpers of power - the three first caliphs, Abu Bakr, 'Umar, and 'Uthman. Therefore, these persons together with five other hostile persons in Shi' ism under the Kurdisised names constituted Ahl-e Haqq' s 'Eight Commanders of Darkness'.35 For the Mandaeans, the legendary ancestor of the Arabs Isma'ïUlshmael became a prototype of the demon called Simiaiil with the variant Simiaiil Satana .36 The last example rather refers to the non-Arabian Jews as the jinn. The matter is that AzazeÙ'Azazil who was one of the mythohistorical prototypes of Iblis, himself takes roots from famous being Seth (also called Setesh, Setekh). The cult of Seth, associated with the Canaanite Baal, was full of vicissitudes in different periods. Once respected by people and pharaohs, at the decline of ancient Egyptian history, i.e. after close of the New Kingdom, or not earlier than 1085 B. C., he was identified as the god of the eastern, mainly Semitic, invaders of Egypt. Revulsion at Seth as the murderer of his brother Osiris transferred to the people associated with him due to the analogue of Seth, the Jewish divinity Azazel. The Egyptians began to equate god Seth with Evil and its personification, the demon Appepi, or Typhon. Thereafter, the Jews witnessed the phenomenon which can be conventionally called the earliest kind of anti-Semitism.37 34 The demons are supposed to be headed by the adversary of God, the idea of whom came in Islam through Judeo-Christian tradition. The latter, in turn, adopted it from Zoroastrianism (Duchesne-Guillemin, op. cit., 672). At time, negative features, from human point of view, which belonged to God, became ascribed to the Devil. However, some attributes remained common to both God and His Adversary (Smagina, op. cit., 47-56). 35 Hamzeh'ee, op. cit., 270. 36 DrowerE. S., Macuch R., A Mandaic Dictionary.

Thus, the Mandaean angel lahudaiil is a personification of the Jewry.38 This angel could be compared with Michael in the same role. In the Slavic world, the similar process of demonization of victorious enemies is to be found amongst the Western Slavs. Thus, there is a demon whose name, to our mind, echoes Turkic Kara-Klobuks ('Black Klobuks'): Klobuk in Mazovia, Chobold in Pomerania, and Kobold in Lusatia.39 The Czech writer of the 15th century described how the devilish Germans had been driven out of the Slavonic monastery.40 Moreover, the Serbian, Bulgarian, and Russian demonol- ogy expressed the general attitude towards hostile peoples, by distinguishing the demons called vrag ('the enemy') and nedrug ('the foe')41 The last example is related to a different region. With the breakig of the Treaty of Limerick by the English in 1691 the Irish Catholics descended into a persecuted position. Then, one of the greatest Irish poets Egan O'Rahilly (1670- 1726) wrote: "That foreign devils have made our land a tomb".42 Thus, we have in different traditions representations of Jews as people of Evil, Arabs as sons of the Devil, anti-Shi'ite Islamic figures as 'Commanders of Darkness', and Turkic Black Klobuks as demons, the devilish Germans and English, and the demons with the names 'the enemy', and 'the foe'. In broader terms, these examples conform with the general phenomenon of the cloaking of foes in mysterious, or just poetical images. Hence, there are proverbs like the Arabic, "there are three misfortunes in the world - rats, locusts, and the Kurds" and many lengthy Russian sayings concerning the Tartars. However, in the historical prospective, the demonization of temporary opponents never leads to the willing results. This was expressed by the modern Jewish theological author: "Ironically, the Satanites whom man seeks to destroy include his own group. For man in turn becomes a Satanite for all those whom he calls Satanites".43 The Standard Jewish Encyclopedia . Ed. C.
