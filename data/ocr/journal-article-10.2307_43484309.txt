<plain_text><page sequence="1">KUŠANA VARĀHA SCULPTURE • • by Dr. N. P. JOSHI Curator , Archaeological Museum, Malhurã A new acquisition in Mathurã Museum As is believed by the followers of the Brahmanical faith Visņu, the protector, manifested himself from time to time to save the world from the clutches of respective demons. Lists of these incarnations appear in different classical works (1) though they do not agree with each other in details. Even the number of the incarnations varies from seven to twenty four. In spite of their other differences no authority has failed to make a mention of the Boar incarnation (Varāha, Yajña-Varaha, Śaukara, etc.). Rather some of them as Rãmãyana , Br ahma-P urāna, Skanda-Purāņa , Bhãgavata at one place, give him the first position in their lists. Though these incarnations find profuse mention in literature, in the field of sculptures their antiquity can not be considerably traced back. For example, we do not know of any sculpture related with Rāma and the episodes of Rãmãyana , which can definitely be attributed to pre- Gupta period, that is, before fifth Century A.D. The other most important incarn- ation is that of Krsņa. He is for the first time seen in a very few sculptures (2) and (1) Vãlmikíya Rãmãyana , Yuddha. 117.12-31 Mahābhārata, Šānli. 339.103-4.

Balarāma was of course worshipped right from the Śuńga age (C. 2nd Cent. B. C.) (2). No other incarnation in sculptures was yet known to have existed in pre-Gupta period. Worship of the Varāha incarnation gained popularity in the Gupta age. Colossal Varāha image from Udayagiri in Madhya Pradesh, another inscribed Varāha dated in the first regional year of Hūņa ruler Toramāņa (3) (close of sixth century A.D.) and so many other images of the same and subsequent ages can be cited in support of the above statement. Even some of the inscriptions of the Gupta age open with salu- ations to Varāha. It is quite clear that Varāha could not have achieved this wide popularity in one or two centuries. There must have been some traditions current behind it, and with coming of the Parama-Bhãgavaia rulers like the Guptas on throne, it gained strength. Existence of this tradition was only an assumption, as there was no sculptural evidence available in its support, and we have to rely on literary evi- dences only. Acquisition of a Kusāņa-Vāraha image in anthropomorphic form in the Archaeological Museum, Mathurā, therefore bridges up an important gap and takes back the antiquity of Varāha worship by at least two hundred years. The present sculpture (Museum accession No. 65.15) is a fragmentary slab (size 1' 21/4" X 1'4") of weather beaten buff coloured stone hailing from some unknown place. According to the dealer, who brought it, it was found from the river Yamuna near Mathurā, but the authenticity of such statements is always open to doubts. The slab shows four human figures in all. The one to the proper left is obviously a devotee with folded hands as is clear from his size and pose. The field over his head is occupied by a mountain. Next to him stands a four handed headless male figure, with two normal hand placed akimbo (kalyavalambi). In his upper two hands there are two discs embossed with a motif depicting Sun-god with his two horses. The figure has turned its face to the left. Exactly near the face, which is now mutilated, appears a small female figure carrying a bud like object in her right hand. The male figure has got a tight floral garland and the famous Srîvatsa mark on its chest. He puts on a waist band (kãyabandhana) and dhoti- with its ends gathered together and suspended in between the two legs so as to reach the ground. In this case armlets and bracelets serve as the ornaments. Though headless the four hands, the floral garland, Srīvatsa symbol on chest, appearance of female figure, obviously the Earth or Prthvī over the left shoulder near the face, and the very pose of his standing help us to identify the deity as Varāha with all certainty. Behind the boar there appear two male figures. One with close fitting tunic (1) U. P. Shah, Terracottas from Bikaner State, Lalit Kalã, No. 8, Oct. 1960, ff. 55-6*2. Pi. XXI, figs. 1 and 2.

The other one in half-reclining pose is a princely figure with a fluted headgear. It is preserved only up to the waist. In the extreme right lower corner only a left foot of some bigger human figure is also seen. Obviously the reclining figure and the warrior formed part of some scene which once appeared just to the right of Varāha. The lower rim of the slab bears a fragmentary inscription in the Brāhmī script of about 2nd Century A.D. It appears that the inscription recorded installation perhaps of this image by somebody, whose names are now gone. The inscription can be read as follows: -...ta sāmikā pratisthāpita...katiprīyatam bhagavām | Though nothing of any importance can be made out from the record it definitely helps us to ascertain the date of the sculpture. From iconographie and artitistic point of view, the present sculpture is important for the following special features: 1) Appearance of Šrīvatsa Though Šrīvatsa on chest is taken to be an important emblem of Visņu, it does not appear in the Kusāņa figures of that deity from Mathurā. In the contemporary Tirthańkara figures it invariably appears on the chest. In the figures of the Buddha and Bodhisattvas of the Kusāņa period it makes its appearance on finger tips (1) of hands and feet. It being one of the important eight auspicious signs and one of the signs of a 'Greatman' had become a common art motif. In case of Udayagiri Varā- ha (2), one can see this sign on his chest. On basis of our present sculpture it can be safely assumed that though not with Visņu, it had its association with Varāha right from the Kusāņa age. 2) Female figure to the left near the face . This is obviously the Earth or Prthvī, which was taken out of the ocean by Varāha. Her appearance is normally an indispensable feature of Varāha images, both in their normal and anthropomorphic forms. The great Boar (Mahāvarāha) according to the legend held up the Earth (Prthvī) concealed under waters with his tusk (3)- left elbow according to some later works (4). In the present sculpture the Earth in anthropomorphic form is definitely to the left side and was probably supported by the left tusk. Here she is seen carrying some bud like object in her right hand. This again finds mention in a much later work, viz. Abhilasitãrtha- (1) N. P.

JOSH I cinlāmaņi or Mãnasollãsa , in its chapter on iconography which describes her as carrying a blue lotus (1). 3) The two Sun figures . This is peculiar feature that instead of having his normal emblems in his hands, he is holding two discs embossed with sun with his two horses. Existence of sun is difficult to explain but perhaps the sun here represents the Kãla or Time, which has been associated with the Mahāvarāha in the Matsya-and Padma-Purāņa. The Matsya-Puräna calls him 'Holder of the Eye of Day and night ( Ahorãtre-ksana dha- rahy (2), while the Padma mentions the God as Time personified ( Kãla-Kãsíhã - nimesãdi kãlarúpãya) (3). It is also interesting to note that representation of Sun seated with his two horses is a well-known Kusāņa feature. For comparison mention must be made of the famous Scythian Sürya image of about 1st Cent. A.D., now exhibited in the galleries of the Archaeological Museum, Mathurã (4). In the Kusāņa art Sun with his two horses similar to the one in the present sculpture had come to be used as a decorative motif. In one specimen now housed in the State Museum, Lucknow, for example, the forehead pendant of a female head bears the same embossing (5). 4) The floral garland . The long garland reaching the knees (āpāda-lambinī vanamãlã) is invariably associated with Visņu both in literature and sculpture. In the latter case it is seen only in the Gupta and post-Gupta periods. In the earlier representation of Visņu - say of Kusāņa age in Mathurā- he is seen with a small collar like garland with a central pendant (6). This is obviously the earlier form of vanamālā, so much so that this collar like garland has not only the flowers but sometimes the long leaves as well (7). In the present Varāha sculpture the tradition of having tight collar like floral wreath has been followed. Depiction of flowers in the wreath is also typic- ally Kusāņa. 5) Other Kusāņa motifs . Apart from the epigraphical grounds and the sun motif there are other features also, which are clearly Kusāņa. They can be summarised as below: (A) Carving of human bodies and faces. (B) Waist band (kãyabandhana) of the Boar. (1) Mānasollāsa, Vimšati 3, Gh. 1. 701, nīlotpaladharām devim uparisthāt prakalpayet. (2) Matsya Purāņa (Mor Ed.), 247. 68. (3) Padma Purāņa (Mor Ed.)

(E) Depiction of rocks (2) and trees. The above discussion would thus show that the slab under consideration can definitely be attributed to the Kusāņa age and throws a welcome light on the preval- ance of Vaisņava cult in that age. This has also taken back by two centuries the introduction of Varāha images in the field of Brahmanical sculptures. (1) Compare, V. A. Smith, Jain Stūpa and Other Antiquities of Mathura , Pis.
