It examines transitions from totemic “nature  religions” to male-dominated and hierarchical belief systems,  and considers how these intersected with shifts to settlement  and agriculture, differentiated gender roles, and stratified socio- political arrangements. With developments in farming, enlarging  societies moved from egalitarian partnerships with other species  and ecosystems to more directive interactions. Irrigation chan- neled water into human interests. Initially seen as embodying fe- male principles, it became the gift of male religious beings. From  being a common good, it became subject to male property rights.  Long understood as the substance of social and spiritual regen- eration, it was reframed as an economic “asset.” Observing these  transformations, the article also considers long-term contraflows:  indigenous struggles; subaltern religions; and environmentalist  and feminist challenges to sociopolitical inequalities.  Through a focus on water and gender, this article considers critical tran- sitions in the historical trajectories of most societies, from animistic and  poly theistic “nature religions,” which venerated localized female, male, and  A number of my former colleagues in New Zealand provided positive input to this work in its early  stages: Kathryn Rountree, Maureen Molloy, Christine Dureau, Mark Busse, and Claudia Gross. In  Durham, Douglas Davies, a leading scholar in this area, was immensely kind in providing extensive  feedback on a later draft. I am also grateful both to him and to Marilyn Strathern for encouraging  conversations about “big-picture” thinking. And I would like to thank the anonymous reviewers for  their encouraging, meticulous, and helpful comments. -85- </page> <page sequence="2"> 86 Journal of Feminist Studies in Religion 30.1 androgynous forces, to increasingly male-dominated and hierarchical belief  systems, which valorized more distant religious figures. These transitions in- tersected with shifts from hunting and gathering to settlement and agricul- ture, changes in gender roles, and the emergence of stratified sociopolitical  arrangements. As technologies such as irrigation developed and societies en- larged, human-environmental relations also moved away from egalitarian and  reciprocal partnerships with other species and ecosystems to more directive  interactions.  These cosmological and material changes are readily apparent in the his- tory of water. Often seen initially as an embodiment of female principles, water  became the gift of powerful male religious beings. From being owned collec- tively, it became the focus of primarily male property rights and control. From  being understood as the substance of social and spiritual regeneration, it be- came an economic “asset.” In tracing these patterns, the article also highlights  long-standing ideological flows between indigenous people’s struggles to main- tain their own lifeways; the attempts of subaltern religious groups to reestablish  more equitable social and human-environmental relations; conservation move- ments’ hopes for more sustainable coexistence with other species; and feminist  challenges to sociopolitical inequalities. Methodological Terrains Rather than focusing on a particular historical or cultural context, this ar- ticle considers seemingly recurring patterns across them. There are limitations  to this interdisciplinary “big-picture” perspective. Unless vast and encyclope- dic, it elides the evidential grounding provided by more specific historical and  ethnographic approaches, subsuming a host of historicalities, particularities,  and diversities. It is openly comparative, resisting pressures to theorize social  change only through a frame of historical and cultural relativity.1 It cannot en- gage more than fleetingly with complex debates about particular spatio-tempo- ral contexts. However, what the big-picture approach can do is trace patterns  and cross-connections that are difficult to discern through closer analyses. It can  provide insights and raise critical (and exciting) questions about gender rela-  1 I have suggested elsewhere that the acknowledgment of a broadly comparative theoretical  framework and an appreciation of cultural and historical specificities are/should be intellectually  complementary rather than mutually exclusive. It is commonly assumed that only cultural relativity  can be ethical. But debates on ethics have raised the point that cultural relativity can also be seen as  an abdication of wider responsibilities. Given that gender inequalities recur across cultural and his- torical boundaries, it may be that comparison can also be “ethical.” See Veronica Strang, “Common  Senses: Water, Sensory Experience, and the Generation of Meaning,” Journal of Material Culture  10, no. 1 (2005): 93–121; and Pat Caplan, ed., The Ethics of Anthropology: Debates and Dilemmas  (New York: Routledge, 2003). </page> <page sequence="3"> Strang: Lording It Over the Goddess 87 tions, long-term trajectories of human development, and recursive relationships  between social, cosmological, and technological changes.  There is both a methodological and political case for this approach:  discipline-based scholarship mines specific historical periods and cultural con- texts to reach deep understandings. While such depth is vital, it is equally im- portant, from time to time, to draw on more diverse areas of knowledge to ask  larger, more general questions. Why do gender inequalities recur across time  and space? How do technological changes articulate with changing cosmologi- cal precepts? What has caused human-environmental relationships to become  so exploitative? Methodologically, such questions require interdisciplinary ap- proaches and cross-cultural conversations. And, politically, to achieve change,  we need to understand how and why human societies repeat patterns of devel- opment that, no matter how persistent, are socially and ecologically unsustain- able and unjust.  Through a Glass Darkly Prehistory can only be seen “through a glass, darkly,”2 but archaeological  evidence suggests some broad commonalities. Clans of hunter-gatherers, gov- erned by all their (male and female) elders, inhabited sentient cultural land- scapes containing numerous and variously gendered spiritual beings and forces  that were simultaneously potent, beneficent, and dangerous. This animated ma- terial world responded to human actions, providing resources, offering protec- tion, or dispensing punishment when laws were violated. Deities took totemic  forms as animals or elements of the environment. Sculptures and images made  between approximately 30,000 BCE and 10,000 BCE also depicted female  forms, the meanings of which have been intensely debated.3 With little explana- tory record, these debates can never be completely resolved, but the persistent  presence of female beings in prehistoric iconography suggests, at least, some  cosmological gender complementarity.  Archaeological and early documentary records also contain multiple ser- pentine figures, sometimes male, sometimes female, sometimes neither or  both.4 Their form mirrors water’s fluid characteristics, and it would appear  that aspects of the environment have often been symbolically gendered ac-  2 1 Corinthians 13:12 (KJV).  3 The most well-known are the Venus of Willendorf, a limestone figure discovered at a Pa- laeolithic site in Austria; the Venus of Lespugue, a mammoth-ivory figure found in the cave of  Les Rideaux; and the Venus of Lausell, a similarly ancient carving at the entrance to a cave in the  Dordogne.  4 Asit Biswas, History of Hydrology (Amsterdam: North-Holland, American Elsevier, 1970);  and Karl Butzer, Early Hydraulic Civilization in Egypt (Chicago: University of Chicago Press,  1976).  </page> <page sequence="4"> 88 Journal of Feminist Studies in Religion 30.1 cording to their particular attributes.5 Thus water sources were often seen as  embodying “feminine” principles, homologously echoing women’s containment  of fluid, life-sustaining places. There are, of course, many cultural variations:  each spatio-temporal context—the inhabitance of arid or well-watered areas,  the nomadic flexibilities of pastoralism, or agricultural needs for reliable water  sources—has brought its own particular ways of using and venerating water.6  However, there are also undercurrents of commonality in each specifically cul- tural adaptation, and recurrent patterns in their developments over time.  In their multiplicity and relative gender equality, the deities inhabiting  early cultural landscapes demonstrate Èmile Durkheim’s maxim that societies  compose their gods in their own images.7 Hunter-gatherers with gerontocratic,  egalitarian forms of leadership would therefore be expected to have multiple  and variously gendered spiritual representatives—an expectation supported by  the traditional beliefs of contemporary hunter-gatherer groups. More hierar- chical social arrangements tend to generate fewer and more powerful beings,  which decrease in number as government centralizes. Thus archaeologist and  historian James Breasted suggested that “monotheism appears when people  have before them a model of a powerful, centralized government.”8   5 Because humans “use the world to think with” cognitively and metaphorically, the mate- rial properties of water have tended to manifest serpentine water-like beings, often being depicted  as shining and/or multicolored, fluid, and ephemeral in form. See Claude Lévi-Strauss, Totemism  (Boston: Beacon Press, 1963), 89; George Lakoff and Mark Johnson, Metaphors We Live By (Chi- cago: University of Chicago Press, 1980); and Strang, “Common Senses.”   6 There are many specifically located historical and ethnographic accounts, but some useful  examples include Bruno David and Julian Thomas, eds., Handbook of Landscape Archaeology,  World Archaeological Congress (WAC) Research Handbook Series (Walnut Creek, CA: Left Coast  Press, 2008); Paul D’Arcy, The People of the Sea: Environment, Identity, and History in Oceania  (Honolulu: University of Hawaii Press, 2006); Kathleen Galvin, “Transitions: Pastoralists Living with  Change,” Annual Review of Anthropology 38 (2009): 185–98; and Elizabeth Shove, Comfort, Clean- liness, and Convenience: The Social Organization of Normality (Oxford: Berg, 2003).  7 Èmile Durkheim observed that classificatory systems are “modelled on the social organisa- tion,” thus “the essential categories of thought may be the product of social factors” (The Elementary  Forms of the Religious Life [1915; repr., London: Allen and Unwin, 1968], 145). Talcott Parsons  notes that this enabled Durkheim to conclude that “society is always the real object of religious  veneration” (“The Theoretical Development of the Sociology of Religion,” in Essays on Sociological  Theory Pure and Applied [Glencoe, IL: Free Press, 1949], 197–211, 206). And Swanson’s view is  that “the relation of men to their society is like that of the worshipper to his god” (Guy Swanson,  The Birth of the Gods: The Origin of Primitive Beliefs [Ann Arbor: University of Michigan Press,  1968], 15). As Arthur Hocart commented, “myth, ritual and social organisation are inseparably con- nected and cannot profitably be studied apart” (The Life-Giving Myth and Other Essays [1952;  repr., London: Methuen, 1970], xi).   8 James Breasted, The Dawn of Conscience (New York: Charles Scribner’s Sons, 1933),  quoted in Swanson, Birth of the Gods, 75. This resonates with Sigmund Freud’s hypothesis that  monotheism came out of Egypt with Moses, despite its prevailing polytheism, as “the reflection of  a Pharaoh autocratically governing a great world Empire.” He also noted that many early societies  had more powerful creator beings as a backdrop to more localized polytheistic arrangements. See  </page> <page sequence="5"> Strang: Lording It Over the Goddess 89 This is a recursive relationship: cosmological beliefs serve to affirm and  uphold sociopolitical arrangements and vice versa. But it is a triangular rather  than linear relationship: beliefs and values are manifested in practice, and when  practices change, it follows that religious and political arrangements will also be  affected. Thus—though this transition seems to have occurred only when ag- riculture advanced well beyond early small-scale horticulture—sociologist and  social psychologist Guy Swanson highlights a critical link between technology  and religion in the parallel emergence of monotheistic beliefs and “societies  which have the most stable sources of food, namely a settled agriculture,” ob- serving that “complexity of social organization requires increased resources to  permit its appearance and sustain its functioning.”9 By examining the dynamic relationships between cosmological understand- ings, sociopolitical arrangements, and material practices, this article considers  how human adaptive processes have reshaped gender relations. The intention is  neither to suggest a linear evolutionary perspective nor to essentialize gender. I  merely observe that among the varied rates and trajectories of change in multi- ple societies there appear to be some broader and consistent patterns in move- ments from flat political structures and animistic “nature religions” to more  hierarchical, sociopolitical arrangements in which power and status accrued  to men, human agency superseded that of the environment, and cosmological  explanations of the world produced increasingly humanized (and increasingly  unequal) male and female deities, until even these were replaced by patriarchal  monotheism. I suggest that people’s relationships with water, and the develop- ment of more directive ways of engaging with it, have been critical in enabling  these changes. And I ask what it would take to regain more egalitarian social,  religious, and environmental relations.  From Hydrolatry to Idolatry Water is central to every aspect of human life. Prehistoric societies clus- tered near resource-rich wetlands, lakes, rivers, and seashores and migrated  along waterways and shorelines. The remnants of their art and material culture  illustrate that water has always featured prominently in people’s religious be- liefs. Water’s core meanings as a life-giving, generative element have pertained,  even as people’s ways of being in the world have altered radically across time  Sigmund Freud, Moses and Monotheism: Three Essays, ed. and trans. James Strachey (London:  Hogarth Press, 1974), 105.  9 Swanson’s theories suggest a rather linear evolutionary movement from simple to complex  societies (Birth of the Gods, 11). With diverse societal trajectories in mind, I would frame this more  as an issue of scale, with enlarging societies tending to require/enable regional or national gover- nance, and new economic practices requiring greater specialization and diversity. </page> <page sequence="6"> 90 Journal of Feminist Studies in Religion 30.1 and space.10 Equally persistent is a keen awareness of water’s “dark” side: it can  submerge or sweep away; dangers lie in its depths.  Rock art in various parts of the world suggests that the earliest  hunter-gatherer societies practiced hydrolatry—valorizing water’s life-giving  properties and propitiating powerful water beings. Water was thus the great  generative element in an animated, sentient environment seen as having agency  equal or superior to that of its human inhabitants. It appeared in multiple origin  myths as a life-creating force. For contemporary hunter-gatherers water has  retained precisely this role: for example, the cos- mologies of Aboriginal Australians have focused on  the Rainbow Serpent for millennia.11  Figures 1 and 2.

The Rainbow Serpent also  appears in recent and contemporary art, as in this bark painting from Western  Arnhem Land by the Kunwinjku artist Yirawala, which depicts the Rainbow  Serpent Ngalyod giving birth to Aboriginal people. Courtesy of Pitt Rivers  Museum, Oxford.  Composed of water, the serpent created all human, animal, and plant spe- cies in the Dreamtime. It remains in the land, continuing to generate human  spirit beings and the resources on which they depend. This focus on water as  an original animating force echoes early belief systems elsewhere. For example,   10 Veronica Strang, The Meaning of Water (Oxford: Berg, 2004).  11 Comparable imagery in prehistoric cave art in Malawi depicts rainbows and serpent beings,  and these also appear in traditional local stories about the water/mother goddess Makewana, or the  serpent Napolo, who causes floods and landslides (Veronica Strang, field notes 2013, in author’s  possession).  </page> <page sequence="7"> Strang: Lording It Over the Goddess 91 the Ur-Babylonians believed the earth was created out of the primordial waters  of Nu ̄n, and that such waters still surged below it.12 Egyptian mythology de- scribes what historian Simon Schama calls a “(literally) seminal fable” of Osiris  and the Nile.13  In a pre-Christian European context, Celtic tribes, dependent on a small- scale mixed economy, made sacrifices at holy wells that provided access to fluid  “feminine” forces, surrounded by complementary “masculine” groves of trees.  Roman records of the invasion of Britain provide some details, with the poet  Lucan (39–65 CE) describing a “Druid grove” and “barbaric” ritual practic- es.14 The gender complementarity in these ancient cultural landscapes is also  demonstrated in their nomenclature: many rivers were seen to embody spe- cific female deities such as Sinann (the River Shannon) and Sequana (the River  Seine).15 Wooden and stone henges, whose design may have drawn inspiration  from a notion of “groves,” were commonly built with avenues leading to related  water bodies into which worshipers cast votive offerings.16  A Rising Tide In the millennia preceding Christianity, some human societies settled and  domesticated plants more systematically, with agriculture emerging in the Near  East from approximately 8000 to 3000 BCE. They also began to engage with  water directively. At first, this entailed only subtle material alterations: in south- west Asia and Papua New Guinea, for example, they modified swamps to assist  the growth of taro. At around 6,000 BCE, more intensive rice cultivation ap- peared in China and other parts of Asia, as Neolithic societies used stone tools  and digging sticks to build levees to impound receding floods.17  But simply capitalizing on floods in relatively minor ways did not initiate  radical changes in gender or power relations.

Dating from approximately 3200 BCE,  illustrations of King Scorpion cutting the first irrigation channel in Egypt signal  the emergence of more complex and ambitious irrigation schemes.21 Initially, these new irrigators worked with seasonal flows, measuring an- nual floods and coordinating economic activities with the natural movements of  water through the environment. But the expansion of agriculture had significant  social effects: the investment of labor in irrigation schemes, fields, and crops  required new forms of land and property ownership.22 Clans and their limited  common property regimes were replaced by more fragmented family units with  increasingly male lines of inheritance.23 There were new “domestic” and “pub- lic” spaces and greater divergence in gender roles. Larger-scale water manage- ment and economic activity also encouraged regional and more hierarchical  political arrangements, and, with the establishment of increasingly patriarchal  systems, both women and “nature” were increasingly treated as subservient to  male “culture.” Thus Herodotus (writing around 440 BCE) recorded that by  3,000 BCE, the first Egyptian pharaoh, King Menes, was established and build- ing the first dam on the Nile, supporting historian Karl Wittfogel’s observation  that political power is coterminous with the control of water resources.24  Power is also central to human-environmental relations. As technological  developments enabled societies to be more directive, there was a shift in agency  between humans and their material environments (and other species). Hunt- er-gatherers had subtly maximized their resource use and their activities (for  example, hunting megafauna, or clearing landscapes with fire); this had some   18 Marija Gimbutas, Shan Winn, and Daniel Shimabuku, Achilleion: a Neolithic Settlement in  Thessaly, Greece, 6400–5600 B.C.

But the introduction of irrigation was critical: with  sophisticated technologies for directing water into human endeavors—dams,  channels, qanats,25 water-lifting machines,26 and waterwheels—a more empow- ered and human-focused relationship with the material world and its other in- habitants emerged.  The religious veneration of water and “nature beings” maintained some  momentum, and such deities remained located in the material environment,  inhabiting specific rivers and lakes, circulating hydrologically, or manifesting  in mountains and trees. The early Romans, for example, celebrated river god- desses such as Minerva with well-dressing rituals called Fontanalia. But such  cosmologies were undergoing important changes. Where societies developed  irrigation, deities were decreasingly represented as animistic serpent beings,  generalized earthy greenness, or totemic animal and bird species; instead, they  began to take on more humanized and more specifically gendered persona.27  The Greeks retained a vision of a generative “world stream” O ̄keanós, a ser- pentine water cycle that united earth and sky and was the source of all freshwa- ter rivers.28 But early Greek art and material culture provides a rich evidential  record of both nonhuman and human, female, male, and androgynous deities.29  In Rome, too, innovative water technologies flourished,30 and, in a move with  long-term consequences in reframing water as a “resource,” the Romans also  created legal and bureaucratic systems for managing water.31 Imperial hege- mony served to export these ideas and material culture: thus, conquered Celtic   25 Qanats were developed on the Iranian peninsula in the first century CE. An influential early  technology for transporting irrigation water in arid regions, they consisted of vertical shafts linked by  underground canals.   26 King Sennacherib (705–681 BCE) not only dammed the Euphrates but also invented  water-lifting machines, enabling Assyria to produce cotton—one of the thirstiest crops in the world  (Biswas, History of Hydrology, 26).  27 Some signs of gender complementarity remained in hermaphrodite figures. For example,  an early Egyptian Nile deity, Hapi, was “depicted as a fat, bearded man with full breasts from which  gushed the life giving water” (Biswas, History of Hydrology, 109).  28 Norman Austin, Meaning and Being in Myth (University Park: Pennsylvania State Univer- sity Press, 1989).   29 Robert Graves, The Greek Myths (1955; repr., London: Penguin, 1992).   30 Rome’s first aqueduct, the Aqua Appia, was commissioned in 312 BCE by censor Appius  Claudius Caecus.  31 As Christer Bruun points out, earlier legal systems dealt with water management, but,  “among the Romans, law became a system of thought. Other ancient societies too had their laws,  even collections of laws. The oldest legal code known to us, and surely the most famous one, is the  Code of Hammurabi (of Babylon), from shortly before 1750 BCE . . . §55: ‘If a man has opened  his trench for irrigation (and) has been slack and so has let the waters carry away (the soil on) his  neighbour’s field, he shall pay corn [grain] corresponding to (the amount of the crop which) his  neighbour (has raised)’ ” (“Imperial Power, Legislation, and Water Management in the Roman  Empire,” Insights, Journal of the Institute of Advanced Study 3, no. 10 [2010]: 1–24, quotation  on 4). </page> <page sequence="10"> 94 Journal of Feminist Studies in Religion 30.1 tribes in Britain, such as the “water dwelling” Durotriges in Dorset, found  themselves enslaved on the treadmills of Roman waterwheels, while their local  Figure 3.

Photo by author. water beings were renamed for goddesses in a Roman pantheon inhabited, like  that of the Greeks, with increasingly humanized deities.  It has been posited that in these and other early religious pantheons “god- dess worship” sometimes superseded the veneration of masculine deities. Poet  and writer on antiquity Robert Graves claimed that contemporaneous human  societies shared “a homogenous system of religious ideas, based on the worship  of the many-titled Mother Goddess.”32 The notion of a matriarchal golden age of  gynocracy had considerable appeal, particularly to the founders of the contem- porary Goddess movement.33 As what theologian Melissa Raphael describes as  an “emancipatory metaphor”34 it continues to inspire goddess-focused religions;  however, it has been heavily critiqued in the academy.35 It is not the object here   32 Graves, Greek Myths, 13.

So why did this  veneration of the feminine decline? With agricultural development, women continued to be centrally involved  in water use, but were increasingly confined to domestic roles as “water car- riers,” a vision that was to dominate the classical era, simultaneously defining  women’s labor while retaining earlier notions of water’s generative power. Water  management, conversely, became a primarily male domain that required wider  political coordination as technology expanded.  In developing humanized forms of polytheism, cosmological beliefs reflected  these more directive human-environmental relationships. Indo-European cul- tures had encouraged the patriarchy of Greek and Scandinavian religions, but  this shift in agency was not confined to Europe. Asian religions, though still  valorizing dragons and water serpents, also became populated by humanized  gods and goddesses who moved rivers and seas, sent or withheld rain depending  on whether they were sufficiently propitiated, and expressed their disapproval  with storms and floods. The Great Yu, for example, first “harnessed the water”  in China:  Yu the Great, is said to have brought civilization to China. . . . His great  achievement was to allow the waters of the Huanghe to flow through nar- row defiles. The river was blocked by high mountains, so the gods sent  Yu to put the territory in order. Not only did he master the Huanghe,  but also all the rivers in China. . . . After completing these Herculean  works, [he] was allowed to found the first dynasty in Chinese history, the  Xia (2207–1766 BCE).36 Though humanized, female water deities remained powerful in some areas. In  Bali, for instance, traditional irrigation schemes still fall under the authority  of water goddesses, whose worship (albeit led by male priests) mediates the  distribution of water to small rice-growing communities.37 But female deities  fared less well in larger societies where irrigation enabled intensified agricul- tural production, population growth, and urbanization.

Rivers changed gender, acquiring  male river gods and masculine “dynamism.”40 Thus, though this has been dis- puted, historian Joseph Campbell suggests that Zeus, whose gentler persona as a  serpent was portrayed in Athenian votive tablets as Zeus Meilichios “the Kindly  God,” became a serpent-slaying warrior god.41 Other powerful female water  deities of the pre-Hellenic period came to be represented as “monstrous”: the  Harpies surged up out of Stygian depths to snatch food from the hungry; Scylla  and Charybdis drowned sailors; and Medusa (who retained distinctive serpen- tine elements) turned her adversaries to stone.42 In this way, the power of water  and nature was cast as an adversary to be conquered and forced into service.  From approximately 1500 BCE into the earliest centuries CE, there was  a florescence of male culture-hero, super-hero gods whose sole purpose was to  slay the powerful water serpent beings that had preceded them. In Babylonia,  Marduk prevailed over the serpent Tiamat, “a female spirit of primeval chaos.”43  In Greek mythology, Zeus slew Typhon, the serpent child of the Earth goddess  Gaia, assuring the reign of the Olympian gods. Perseus killed a sea monster   38 Benedict Anderson, Imagined Communities: Reflections on the Origins and Spread of Na- tionalism (London, New York: Verso, 1991).   39 The disembedding of social and spiritual being from local environments has major socio- political implications. Thus the removal of previously localized deities to “otherworld” locations such  as Olympus, Valhalla, and so on can be interpreted in Durkheimian terms as a key indicator of the  emergence of more centralized and hierarchical political forms and greater social and ecological  alienation. See Karl Polanyi, The Great Transformation (Boston: Beacon Press, 1957).   40 Swamps and wetlands were simultaneously feminized and reframed as disorderly, danger- ous “nether regions” (Rodney Giblett, Postmodern Wetlands: Culture, History, Ecology [Edinburgh:  Edinburgh University Press, 1996], 87).   41 Joseph Campbell, Creative Mythology (New York: Arkana, 1968). Classicist Barbara Grazi- osi (personal communication) observes that the serpentine Zeus Meilichios may not have preceded  the male “sky god” persona of this deity. It is probably unwise, in any case, to assume simple linear  transitions from one form to another: the reality was undoubtedly messier and more complex. How- ever, it is reasonable to note that the male persona of Zeus (which may have been a complementary  aspect of earlier forms) appears to have become the more dominant representation over time.  42 David Gilmore, Monsters: Evil Beings, Mythical Beasts, and All Manner of Imaginary  Terrors (Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania Press, 2003), 38–41; Miriam Robbins Dexter,  “The Frightful Goddess: Birds, Snakes, and Witches,” in Varia on the Indo-European Past:  Papers in Memory of Marija Gimbutas, ed.

Saint George, Saint Michael, Saint Patrick,  and others all dispatched powerful serpent (and invariably water-related) be- ings.47 These efforts crystallized in the Garden of Eden with the ultimate re- pudiation not just of the serpent but of Nature itself. Ortner presents this as  the basis for a vital conceptual separation between wild, untamed, and female  Nature and purportedly rational, enlightened male Culture.48 Though the for- mulation of more dualistic cosmological models was not as clear-cut as this  suggests, having much earlier temporal roots, the more distinct “othering” of  the nonh uman in the emerging monotheisms was a critical development in  human-environmental relationships, and similarly important in affirming more  polarized and unequal notions of gender.49 Origin myths were reformed accordingly, superimposing directive patri- archal figures. Thus Plato’s rendition of Greek creation stories, in Timaeus’s  Dialogue, describes primal unformed matter that is both a receptacle and a  “nurse.” “He imagines a disembodied male mind as divine architect, or Demi- urgos, shaping this matter into the cosmos.”50 In the biblical narratives of Gen- esis, God quells the chaotically primal waters. The Deluge remains as a violent  punishment for human sin, but is also reframed as a cleansing God-directed  baptism of the world. There is a plethora of biblical imagery describing how  water streams down from the Temple, rains down to fertilize the soil as a gift  from a magnanimous God, or is withheld when He is displeased.  Just as Nature was recast as the subject of male agency, so too were women.  “Exclusively male God-language”51 established religious practices in which   47 Being imaginatively composed of water and its hydrological movements, cosmological ser- pent beings are associated with water in multiple cultural narratives: they inhabit oceans or rivers,  dwell in swamps, caves, or underground places, or are found in clouds and rain.   48 Sherry Ortner, “Is Female to Nature as Male Is to Culture?” in Women, Culture, and So- ciety, ed.

Some cultural con- texts contain multiple potential gender-identity positions along this continuum, and considerable  license to shift between its polarities. However, where dualistic notions dominate, more centrally  located or ambiguous identities have tended to become “abominations” (Douglas Davies, personal  communication with author, 2013).   50 Rosemary Ruether, “Ecofeminism: Symbolic and Social Connections of the Oppression of  Women and the Domination of Nature,” in Ecofeminism and the Sacred, ed.

As feminist writer  Barbara Walker says, “Diana’s cult was so widespread in the pagan world that  early Christians viewed her as their major rival, which was why she later became  ‘Queen of Witches.’ ”55  A medieval desire to repudiate religions valorizing fertility, fecundity, and  “base human nature” encouraged punitive forms of asceticism that repressed  sexual and sensory impulses.

To be seen as having any place in this scheme,  women had to reject their sexuality.56 As anthropologist and theologian Douglas  Davies observes, men too had to be celibate in order to achieve spiritual status.  He also points out that these ideas had an important hydrological dimension:  waterless, “lifeless” desert became a space for purification, and, in the Acts of  the Apostles, notions of blood and fluid as generative substances were replaced  by an idea of generative “spirit.”57 Cartesian intellectual dualism served a similar purpose, separating the en- lightened “rational” mind from the uncultured body. These inner-directed du- alisms were externalized “epigenetically”58 in the hope that either a patriarchal  deity and/or Culture would similarly control unruly and fecund Nature herself,  making her a compliant servant to “mankind” through carefully channeled gen- erative processes.  The history of malignant waters is long. Old church fathers such as Origen,  Jerome, and Chrysostom believed that nature and all external materialities were  diabolic and in need of combating. In the words of Chrysostom, one had to  bring “the beast under control” by “banishing the flood of unworthy passions.”  Aquinas, too, preached the necessity of human domination over the rest of the  world.59 The belief that Nature must be tamed was fully expressed in water manage- ment. The Domesday Book (1086) records water mills along almost every mile  of the rivers in southern England. Through the Middle Ages, environmentally  directive technologies increased exponentially. Water pumps, bores, pipes, and  canals became central to economic production. Wetlands, formerly treasured  for their rich resources, were recast as fetid and feminized “nether regions” and  drained to enlarge agricultural areas.60 In urban settlements, where butchery,  tanning, and other nascent industries spewed pollution into streams, water be- came undrinkable and was seen, increasingly, as the source of miasma and dis- ease.61 Such negative views echoed long-standing fears about water’s potential   56 Ruether, Ecofeminism.  57 Dualism had its own complexities: religious celibates were to some extent degendered,  forming a kind of third category. And, though monotheistic, Christianity configured God the Father,  the Son, and the Holy Spirit in triadic form (Douglas Davies, personal communication with author,  2013).   58 Georg Hegel, The Phenomenology of Spirit, trans.

Thus, in the 1300s, as the plague decimated popula- tions across Europe, people rushed to bathe in rivers (for example the Stour in  Dorset) believed to have curative properties.62  Christianized holy wells retained their (saintly) healing powers until the  1500s, when the Reformation, in particular Calvinism, attacked beliefs in holy  water and wells as “popish magic and superstition.”63 There were campaigns  to use such places for profane purposes, for instance redeploying holy water  stoups as pig-feeding troughs, but religious historian Terje Oestigaard observes  that “even though the Reformation tried to end water worship, the cult was  so important and such an intrinsic part of culture and religion that it contin- ued for centuries, with nobles and commoners alike making pilgrimages to the  holy wells with the aim of attaining long life and prosperity.”64 It was with the  Reformation, too, that the institution of marriage became normative, providing  new opportunities for dualism in ideas about gender and status.65 Thus, once  again, cosmological changes intersected with shifting social arrangements and  material practices.  The God in the Machine The rejection of ideas that spiritual power and agency was located in water,  and the growing instrumentality of human relations with it, was tied closely  to the advancement of science, which introduced a new form of patriarchy.  Building on Greek philosophers’ efforts to understand the material world, pri- marily male scholars sought to investigate water’s properties. This constituted  a further shift in agency and control, bifurcating the world into active subject  and passive object, as Australian ecofeminist Val Plumwood says, “in a way that  refuses objects elements of commonality, mind, or intentionality.”66 Historian  Gary Deason describes the emergence of a mechanistic view of Nature: “The  mechanical view rested on a single, fundamental assumption: matter is passive.   62 Strang, Meaning of Water.  63 Arthur Gribben, Holy Wells and Sacred Water Sources in Britain and England, an Anno- tated Bibliography (London: Garland, 1992), 4, 16.   64 Terje Oestigaard, “The Topography of Holy Water in England after the Reformation,” in  The Ideas of Water from Antiquity to Modern Times, ed.

Thus ecology was recast as  technology, providing a basis for a “radical discontinuity” between humans (as  the sole possessors of reason) and nonhuman Nature68 (though at the time, of  course, “reason” was seen as the province of only half of the human population).  This shift in human-environmental relations brought “an increasing em- phasis on the utility of natural things” to meet human needs and divine purpos- es.69 The new cosmological framework of the Enlightenment brought more ab- stract and objective “religions” composed along “essentially rationalist lines.”70  Polyvalent concepts of Nature in the Renaissance came to be dominated by  Immanuel Kant’s notions of “pure” and “practical” reason and Sir Francis Ba- con’s “inward instinct.” “Nature according to this view is simply another mode  of divine operation . . . divine power pervades nature itself.”71 Thus, as Davies  says, “the Psalms dwell quite specifically on the wonders of God’s work in nature  . . . it is an expression of God’s will and power.”72  The assertion of absolute divine authority required the eradication of  “witchcraft,” “superstition,” and “heresy.” Even as scientific understandings  leapt forward in the postmedieval period, the church made continued efforts  to erase the last traces of nature religions that venerated and ascribed agency  to an animate material world. Major scientific discoveries were interspersed by  punitive repressions of subaltern cosmologies.73 Thus Galileo’s publication of  Two New Sciences in 1638 and René Descartes’s Principia Philosophiae in 1644  preceded the Rouen witch trials of 1670. Sir Isaac Newton published Principia  in 1687 and Optics in 1704. In 1717, Edmond Halley revealed Earth’s place in  the stars. Yet the burning, hanging, drowning and beheading of (mostly female)  “witches” continued throughout the eighteenth and even into the early nine- teenth century: five were sentenced to death in Lyons in 1745; in Switzerland,  Anna Göldi was beheaded in 1782; in 1789, Giovanna Bonnano was hanged in  Italy; Maria da Conceição was executed in Brazil in 1798; a Native American   67 Gary Deason, “Reformation Theology and the Mechanistic Concept of Nature,” in God and  Nature: Historical Essays on the Encounter between Christianity and Science, ed.

Though  some major holy wells, such as Lourdes, continued to be the focus of pilgrim- ages, in the 1700–1800s, the majority became health spas,75 although it could be  argued that even this scientific conversion to being “recreational” places merely  reframed their original meanings in a secular idiom. Another important change that came with monotheism and “enlightened”  rationality was a shift toward individuated forms of resource ownership, which  required commensurately individual constructions of social identity. Although  water, being elusive in its material nature, continued to be seen as a common  good, land and resources were rapidly enclosed and privatized, falling almost  exclusively into male hands and lines of inheritance. Thus, over time, women,  who had been elders in common with men, had been party to collective forms  of ownership, had jointly upheld lexicons of knowledge, and had been repre- sented by powerful female deities, found themselves increasingly propertyless,  voteless, and voiceless as men controlled the land and resources, the knowledge  bases of religion and science, political processes, and public discourse.  Land and resource enclosures were driven by intensifying economic prac- tices and population growth. Such pressures for expansion encouraged wide- spread exploration and colonization. A patriarchal religious cosmology, in which  male Culture strove for dominance over Nature, was readily extended to clas- sifying “the other” (that is to say putatively “primitive” societies) as part of that  unruly feminized chaos requiring “civilization.” Having worked hard to excise  nature religions from their own industrializing societies, monotheistic patriar- chies therefore extended their evangelical efforts to dissuade “savage” societies  from worshiping water, trees, animistic beings, and the like. And science, too,  emerging to occupy center stage, would help disabuse them of these foolish  “superstitions.” From the 1500s on,76 hegemonic colonial enterprises stretched to encom- pass entire continents, simultaneously appropriating land and resources and  requiring their inhabitants to conform to new religious and scientific modes   74 Alan Kors and Edward Peters suggest that approximately fifty thousand “witches” were ex- ecuted in Europe and America, 75 to 80 percent of whom were women (Alan Kors and Edward  Peters, Witchcraft in Europe, 400–1700: A Documentary History [Pennsylvania: University of  Pennsylvania Press, 2001]).  75 Susan Anderson and Bruce Tabb, eds., Water, Leisure, and Culture: European Historical  Perspectives (Oxford: Berg, 2002).  76 There were earlier efforts to impose religious changes on conquered peoples (this being a  feature of most colonial invasions), as well as upsurges of conflict between the major monotheistic  religions, for example, in the Crusades. But the technology that enabled major oceanic voyages and  produced massive disparity in military strength permitted far more ambitious colonial enterprises.  </page> <page sequence="20"> 104 Journal of Feminist Studies in Religion 30.1 of thought. Indigenous people became subject to larger, more hierarchical ar- rangements in which, along with women and children, they found themselves  at the bottom of a social heap in which more power was held by even the lowest  classes of European men. White male elites dominated political life, and all  were ruled, ultimately, by a male God and His representative monarch.  Also exported to the colonies was a very different human-environmental  relationship: “In Western society, the application of science to technical con- trol over nature marched hand in hand with colonialism.”77 While many place- based indigenous peoples had maintained localized, relatively egalitarian en- gagements with their surroundings, imposed economic modes were much more  instrumentalist, applying, in both cosmological and technical forms, a vision in  which “Mankind” was expected to hold the balance of power and agency. The concept of “the environment” itself underlines the reclassification of  the nonhuman world as “other.” Such objectification is fundamentally alien- ating,78 and there are key relational differences between societies that dwell  “within the sphere” of their material surroundings, and those for whom the  earth is a “globe” to be acted upon.79 The latter view assumes ownership and au- thority, supporting Plumwood’s earlier argument that Nature-Culture dualism  produces unequal social dichotomies and alienation from nonhuman species.80  Such concerns, articulated by the feminists and conservationists of the 1960s  and 1970s, echoed the Romanticism of the late 1800s, which was similarly crit- ical both of social elites and the “rationalization” of nature.81  But patterns of change have intellectual and material momentum. In pri- marily masculine colonial enterprises, patriarchal beliefs and values asserted  their authority despite humanitarian critiques and indigenous resistance.82 Mis- sionary evangelism was not just directed at conquered societies: there was an  equally zealous technological Crusade to tame and dominate the “wilderness”  of “virgin territory.”83 Nowhere was this more apparent than in colonizers’ ef-  77 Ruether, Ecofeminism, 329.  78 Phillipe Descola and Gisli Palsson, Nature and Society: Anthropological Perspectives  (London: Routledge, 1996); and Veronica Strang, “Knowing Me, Knowing You: Aboriginal and  Euro-Australian Concepts of Nature as Self and Other,” Worldviews 9, no. 1 (2005): 25–56.   79 Tim Ingold, The Perception of the Environment (London, New York: Routledge, 2000).

The in- visible and illimitable waters of Australia are now being revealed and  redeemed, in affinity with our fertile soils to be a habitation for man- kind. . . . the sweeping floods lost in sea and sand, can all be saved. . . .  Australia Felix was an arid waste, a hell of heat and flies. . . . The Lord  gave the rains and rivers only to dry them up and take them back again.  One man questioned the divine Creator’s plan, a Glasgow Scot named  Hugh McColl. . . . Irrigation was his cry.86 This modern serpent slayer/water conqueror linked up with another Australian  hero, Alfred Deakin, who “looked far into the future and saw ‘the bare and  blinding desert transmuted by industry and intelligence into orchards and fields  of waving grain.’ . . . The Victorian Government listened with interests to the  youthful St Paul, approved his plan and set him to achieve the miracle.”87 Hill’s  account describes the “Miracle of the Murray,” the “Apostles of Irrigation,” and  a vision of “Utopia on the Murray.” There are biblical “Years of the Locust,”  “Gentle Rain from Heaven,” and sometimes punitive “Acts of God.” But as  McColl’s reported willingness to “question the divine Creator’s plan” attests,  this was not just an assertion of monotheistic authority; rather, it was equally an  instrumental vision of human (male) agency, in which “the environment” was an  object of material subordination.  The twentieth-century secularization of water heavily submerged its reli- gious meanings. As H2O philosopher Ivan Illich argues, it became “not water,  but a stuff which industrial society creates. . . . [T]he twentieth century has  transmogrified water into a fluid with which archetypal waters cannot be  mixed.”88 Core generative meanings were still celebrated in the lakes and elab-  84 Accounts of European settlement in Australia and New Zealand show that freshwater re- sources (which also tended to be important sacred sites for indigenous populations) were always  the first priority for colonists.

The construction of  urban water-supply systems expressed the agency and moral rectitude of Victo- rian philanthropists. But, as these examples suggest, the process of controlling  water—abstracting it, treating it chemically, redistributing it through sophisti- cated distribution schemes—had acculturated it sufficiently that it was more  readily imagined as a product of human, primarily male, actors: engineers,  chemists, and water managers.  Though secularity is often presented as diametrically opposed to religious  thinking, Durkheim’s view of religious cosmologies as a mirror of sociop olitical  arrangements can be as readily applied to scientific understandings of the world.  There is coherence between the authority of science and that presented by pa- triarchal monotheism. Both, in effect, place “expert” knowledge and the agency  of events in male human hands and support hierarchies of power in which  women and nonhumans are disempowered. Both are upheld by what political  scientist Niamh Reilly calls “oppressive discursive practices” that enable subju- gation and exploitation.89 By separating Culture and Nature, both encourage an  instrumental approach in which both people and things are only valuable if they  are “productive” in the right way. Such utilitarianism is exemplified by recent  ideas about “ecosystem services” in which each aspect of ecology, each species  and biological process, is measured to see how much (and whether) it serves  human needs and those of a neoliberal market.   89 Niamh Reilly, “Rethinking the Interplay of Feminism and Secularism in a Neo-secular  Age,” Feminist Review 97 (2011): 5–31.

In the last two centuries, there has been rising ten- sion between long-standing views of water as a common good,90 and efforts to  privatize it as a commercial resource (a process still dependent on the Roman  law that operationalized water management in the first place). In Britain, efforts  by Victorian water companies to take over municipal roles as water suppliers  were pushed back by postwar nationalization; then, in the 1980s, such collective  thinking was overridden by Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher’s determina- tion to privatize the water industry. This generated massive public resentment,  though resistance to this move stopped short of the violent protests that success- fully repelled similar efforts in Bolivia.91 Such processes of marketization have  been repeated internationally.92 A major result of this economic neoc olonialism  is that an increasing percentage of the world’s freshwater resources is now  owned by transnational corporations and their (usually male) shareh olders and  directors, and physically controlled by their—again, usually male—hydrologists  and engineers, whose enthusiasm for dams and other schemes for water im- poundment and redirection remains undiminished despite intensifying protests  about their social and ecological impacts.93  Although this is the briefest of sketches, in a long-term, cross-cultural view  of human relations with water, it is possible to discern some coherent patterns.  These show how religious and secular cosmologies, sociopolitical arrangements,  and material practices have articulated, over time, to elevate men in industri- alized societies to “Lord it over the Goddess,” subjugating women and less  powerful societies, and asserting male ownership and agency in relation to the  physical world, its resources, and its nonhuman inhabitants.  90  Following a lengthy campaign to formalize human rights to clean water and sanitation, the  UN General Assembly adopted a resolution to this effect in July 2010.

The introduc- tion of “water trading” in Australia in the 1990s privatized water allocations, reconstructing them as  commercial assets. One result was to awaken “sleeper” licenses and increase water impoundment  and use, rather than delivering the promised ecologically positive market efficiencies (Veronica  Strang, Gardening the World: Agency, Identity, and the Ownership of Water [Oxford: Berghahn,  2009]).   93 Veronica Strang, “Dam Nation: Cubbie Station and the Waters of the Darling,” in The  Social Life of Water in a Time of Crisis, ed.

This shows simi- larly consistent links between subaltern “nature religions” valorizing feminine  principles; egalitarian political arrangements; and a relational ethic that frames  human and nonhuman kinds in more reciprocal terms. Visions of human and  nonhuman equity flow readily between feminism, the civil rights movement,  and environmentalism.94 It is easy to forget, with the incorporation (some would  say appropriation) of the green movement into scientific discourses, that envi- ronmentalism used to be more radically concerned with sociopolitical relations.  The relevance of gender parity in maintaining other equal partnerships—with  different cultural groups, with other species—seems to have eluded male writ- ers who have critiqued the alienation of humankind from Nature.95 But it was  clearly foundational to the ideas of ecofeminists such as Mary Daly and Char- lene Spretnak, and concurs with Susan Griffin’s observation that there is a paral- lel between the oppression of women and the exploitation of Nature96: “We see  the devastation of the earth and her beings by the corporate warriors as feminist  concerns. It is the same masculinist mentality which would deny us our right to  our own bodies and our own sexuality, and which depends on multiple systems  of dominance and state power to have its way.”97 A long view of human adaptations also suggests that contemporary ideo- logical countermovements come from deep sources, welling up from prehis- toric forms of hydrolatry and persisting over time through multiple changes in  form. The recognition that subaltern ideas have ancient cosmological anteced- ents usefully challenges assumptions that contemporary feminism is intrinsi- cally at odds with spirituality. In Western societies there has been a significant  shift away from conventional religions to more diverse forms of spirituality, and  sociologist Peter Berger argues that the world is “de-secularizing” in new di- rections.98 Another sociologist, Kristen Aune, observes that contemporary fem-  94 Greta Gaard, Ecofeminism: Women, Animals, Nature (Philadelphia: Temple University  Press, 1993).   95 Descola and Palsson, Nature and Society; and Ingold, Perceptions of the Environment. One  might add to this list James Lovelock, whose efforts to present humankind as the brains of the planet  are integrative, but conform to particular ideas about human “rational” superiority (The Ages of  Gaia: A Biography of Our Living Earth [New York and London: W. W. Norton, 1988]). This un- derlines Plumwood’s point that the nonreflexive views of “ecoguardian” scientists tend to entrench  rather than challenge anthropocentrism (Environmental Culture, 68).  96 Mary Daly, Gyn/Ecology: The Metaethics of Radical Feminism (Boston: Beacon Press,  1978); Charlene Spretnak, Lost Goddesses of Early Greece: A Collection of Pre-Hellenic Myths  (1978; repr., Boston: Beacon Press, 1992); and Griffin, Women and Nature.  97 Maria Mies and Vandana Shiva, Ecofeminism (Halifax, Nova Scotia: Fernwood, 1993), 14.  98 Paul Heelas et al., The Spiritual Revolution: Why Religion Is Giving Way to Spirituality  (Oxford: Blackwell, 2005); and Peter Berger, The Desecularization of the World: The Resurgence  of Religion in World Politics (Grand Rapids: Eerdmans, 1999).

Ancient holy wells not only continue to serve as a wellsprings for sub- altern religious ideas101 but are also now the focus of increasing numbers of con- temporary “well-dressing” rituals, led by women to strengthen local communi- ties across Britain.102 And women are major participants in the rising numbers  of conservation groups hoping to regain some control over the management of  local waterways.103  Countermovements hoping to effect change need to address each part of  the recursive triangle. They can demand new social and political arrangements  and take action to address material inequities in areas such as the ownership,  management, and control of water resources. But they also need to recognize  the critical centrality of cosmological beliefs and values that valorize equity and  complementarity in gender and environmental relations. In the last decade,  it has become clear that sympathetic countermovements are beginning to co- alesce, using globalization itself, and globalized media, to challenge dominant  beliefs, values, and practices. The result is an increasingly vocal critique of patri- archal, market-driven rule and techno-managerial instrumentality, and an array  of active demands for social and environmental justice. This coalescence raises,  for the first time, the potential to create more than localized groundswells that  are readily suppressed or ignored. But to make the necessary connections, to  realize this potential, it is vital to pay attention to how similar patterns resonate  across time and space.
