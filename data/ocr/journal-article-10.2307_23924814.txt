Oxford and New York: Oxford University Press, 2012. Pp. xx, 198; 14 color illus., 73 black and-white illus. In Nectar and Illusion Henry Maguire returns to themes introduced in his 1987 study Earth and Ocean: The Terrestrial World in Early Byzantine Art and extends these into an analysis that embraces the representation in Byzantine art and literature of subjects taken from nature. This book is wide-ranging, encom passing materials from Late Antiquity through the late Byzantine era and from all parts of the ever-shifting territories of that empire. Although the texts presented are wide-ranging, it is theological writings, rhetorical set pieces, and church decora tion that find a privileged place in this discussion. Nectar and Illusion continues an interest that has shaped Maguire's extensive, influential, and important scholar ship—namely, the investigation of the potential and the limits of the correlation of art and literature. More specifically, the topic that shapes this book invites us to pay attention to the sometimes overlooked, perhaps marginal, play of nature in Byzantine art that is primarily considered in terms of its narrative, theocentric, and anthropocentric subject matter. In his introduction Maguire describes the focus of the book in the fol lowing terms: "the book aims to study the changing Byzantine attitude toward the place of terrestrial nature in Christian art and literature. It will attempt to account for the relative weight given to nature-derived and anthropomorphic images in Byzantine art of different times and contexts and to show how the Byzantines embraced or distanced nature through the manner of its representa tion, whether verbal or visual (4)." It is a description that suggests the binary tensions that will continue to define this study: "nature-derived" and "anthro pomorphic" are set in opposition to one another; nature may be "embraced" or "distanced" at different times and in different places. This quality is reiter ated in the titles of the chapters that follow upon this introduction: "Nature and Idolatry," "Nature and Rhetoric," "Nature and Metaphor," "Nature and Abstraction," and "Nature and Architecture." These are suggestive pairings, introducing various means by which an understanding of verbal and visual representations of nature could be inflected. In chapter 1, "Nature and Idolatry," Maguire returns to materials made familiar in Earth and Ocean. In the present study he first identifies a rich presence of images drawn from nature in church decorations of the fifth and sixth centuries,</page><page sequence="2">318 Reviews even as many church fathers were expressing concern regarding the worship of created things, a worship that they identified with idolatry. This tension was exac erbated during the era of iconoclasm, when images of nature (already opened to distrust) were now associated with iconoclastic visual choices and so doubly open to condemnation. As a result, the period after iconoclasm witnessed a predomi nance of anthropocentric imagery and a sharp diminishment in the presence of subjects drawn from nature. As the author writes, "But to keep these holy portraits, they had to jettison the profane imagery of the natural world (38)." This point will be further developed in chapter 4. In chapter 2, "Nature and Rhetoric," it is argued that the perception of nature is further complicated by the distrust provoked by the medium of rhetoric, which most commonly represented nature to a Byzantine audience. Only in the twelfth century, following upon an understanding that nature had been redeemed by the incarnation, are positive images of nature again found in works of art. Nonetheless, the overall tone of this chapter suggests that "rhetorical treatments of nature were regarded with suspicion and often were accompanied by disclaimers or by material that would neutralize their glorification of terrestrial phenomena (66)"—a pattern that was only occasionally broken by the celebration of nature that could some times be found in such subjects as the Annunciation to the Virgin or the Annuncia tion to St. Anne. "Nature and Metaphor," the topic that shapes chapter 3, continues the analy sis of the correlation of art and rhetoric. Here Maguire notes that natural metaphors remain prevalent in literature, but are far less common in the arts. The author argues that this reluctance may derive from the influence of Canon 82 of the Quinisext Council (691-92), which argued that it was no longer appropriate to show Christ in the symbolic form of the lamb (86-88). It is a text that reminds us of the power of visual representation in Byzantium and of the possible significance of visual choices for that culture. As Maguire shows, for most of the history of Byzantium the legacy of a distrust of nature led to the absence of rich natural imagery in more public works of art. This point is especially clear when the relative absence of natural imagery from the extensive cycles of decoration representing the Akathis tos Hymn stands in sharp contrast to the abundant natural metaphors to be found within the text of that hymn (91-92). Maguire returns to the importance of the iconoclastic era when he argues in chapter 4 ("Nature and Abstraction") that prior to that era, nature was depicted with great specificity in Byzantine church decorations. In contrast, the era fol lowing the iconoclastic age only presented natural images in a less defined, more abstract manner. This change is strikingly different from the treatment of the human body during this same period. In particular, the bodies of the saints were precisely described in their images, creating a spiritual taxonomy to rival the herbals that</page><page sequence="3">Reviews 319 survive from Late Antiquity.1 Maguire's point is a reminder that the modern cor relation of abstraction with spirituality may not be appropriate for understanding Byzantine art. Chapter 5 asks the reader to reconsider the role of architecture in Byzantine images. In "Nature and Architecture" Maguire argues that architecture rather than nature came to define the terrestrial world. While it is probably correct to argue that this provides a means of imagining the terrestrial world, it could be suggested that this is less a rejection of the problematic natural world than an expression of an all-too human and urban perception of the world. Nectar and Illusion thus presents a series of essays that open perspectives on the role of nature in Byzantine art. This volume succeeds in making us look away from the narrative or portrait content of much of this art. To a great extent, it does this by analyzing texts and images that belong at an elite level of this soci ety. The material introduced is wide-ranging and sweeps back and forth across the many centuries of Byzantium's history and art, seeking to open questions that invite the development of more specific enquiries. One of the insistent notes throughout this study is that the conceptualization of the image over the course of the iconoclastic crisis of the eighth and ninth centuries provides the grounds for a clear demarcation between what was possible in the art of the early Byz antine era and the art of medieval Byzantium. Many issues arise from this: how do we account for those concepts drawn from the earlier period and rearticulated during the crisis? How do we assess the influence of a theological discussion on artistic production? How do we accommodate the contested and evolving legacy of iconophile doctrine as it played out in medieval Byzantium? Similarly, given the importance placed upon a greater abstraction in the depiction of nature in the post-iconoclastic era, there is a need to enquire further into what is meant by such abstraction, or rather, to ask for who is the abstraction described by the art historian an abstraction? Is abstraction thinkable for a Byzantine audi ence? Furthermore, Maguire's book is constructed around the manifestations of nature in literature and art. What would happen if we were to introduce some of the threads set aside at the outset of this study—namely, the manner in which philosophical or scientific texts define nature—or if we were to consider how the economic implications of the natural world might condition its presentation in visual or verbal media? Above all, the implications of the binary structure that has shaped this rich book need further unpacking even as the manifold opposi tions generated provide suggestive insight into the materials under discussion. For example, how do we distinguish between living things and human beings in creation? How is one to keep both negative and positive perceptions of nature in play? Why can literature sustain natural metaphors while the visual arts cannot? Is the human body necessarily representable in categorical terms that cannot be</page><page sequence="4">320 Reviews applied to the natural world? Is the implicit and absolute distinction between the spiritual and the terrestrial that organizes these questions and this material so clear? At the end of such a stimulating and provocative read, it is surprising that more extensive studies on this topic have not been written. It is to be expected that more will follow upon this groundbreaking work. Charles Barber Princeton University NOTES 1.
