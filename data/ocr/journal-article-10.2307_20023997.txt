<plain_text><page sequence="1">M. I. FINLEY Archaeology and History Momigliano began his elegant obituary of Mikhail Rostovtzeff by recalling the "unforgettable impression" made on students of his ( and my ) generation by the publication in 1926 of the Social and Economic History of the Roman Empire: All seemed, and indeed was, extraordinary in the book. Even the external appearance was unusual. We were accustomed to books on an cient history where the archaeological evidence, if used at all, was never presented and explained to the reader. Here a lavish series of plates intro duced us directly to the archaeological evidence; and the caption of each plate really made us understand what one could learn from apparently insignificant items . . . Rostovtzeff delighted and surprised us by what seemed to us his uncanny gift of calling ancient things to life. He guided us through the streets of Rome, Pompeii, N?mes and Tr?ves and showed how the ancients had lived.1 Half a century later the situation has radically altered in some respects. Although there are still too many books written about ancient history in which the archaeological evidence receives no more than lip service, not merely in the presentation but also in the historian's own study, it is also true that classical and Near East ern historians, as a whole, are much more conscious of, and knowl edgeable about, archaeological evidence than they were when Ros tovtzefFs book appeared.2 If it is hard to think of anyone since who possesses his gift of the illuminating caption, that is sad but not very significant. What is serious is that the demands made by historians of antiquity upon archaeology, and the methods of employing and presenting archaeological evidence in ancient history, have not ad vanced much beyond what was possible for Rostovtzeff, and often lag behind. Yet in the same half-century archaeology itself, at its best, has advanced immeasurably, and historians ought to have advanced with it. 168</page><page sequence="2">Archaeology and History However, it is not my intention in this essay to produce a catalogue of grievances along these lines; it would soon become boring and unilluminating. Looking to the future, there are two central ques tions, in my judgment. The first is whether current trends in archaeol ogy are departing so far from the kinds of questions historians have traditionally put to archaeologists that the gap between the two will soon be widened rather than narrowed. That will be my con cern in the first section; to my mind, at least, there is a close kinship with the problems created by the trend toward "serial history" ( by whatever name it is called ) dealt with elsewhere in the present volume. Then I shall go to my second question, limited to classical archaeology alone: What is it that the classical historian ought to be asking of archaeological evidence today, and how successfully are the archaeologists, from their side, adjusting their own older aims and techniques to these new demands? Implicit in this discus sion is the assumption that contemporary historians, even of an tiquity, are asking new kinds of questions. Anyone who is happy with kings and battles or with "calling ancient things to life" (I deliberately resort to a caricature) will find the discussion wholly irrelevant. I In common with other disciplines in the humanities and social studies, archaeology gives the appearance of being in a crisis. That is attested by the spate of books and articles with such titles as New Perspectives in Archaeology.3 At the simplest level, there is a strong reaction within the discipline against the familiar excursions into prehistoric religion, economics, or art appreciation that are neither grounded in, nor controlled by, theory or adequate knowl edge. There is a new mood of austerity, even of pessimism. It may seem "hard doctrine to some people," writes Stuart Piggott, but "the observational data of prehistory seem to me in almost every way to be more ambiguous, and more capable of varied interpreta tions, than the normal run of material available to historians. What we have at our disposal, as prehistorians, is the accidentally sur viving durable remnants of material culture, which we interpret as best we may, and inevitably the peculiar quality of this evidence dictates the sort of information we can obtain from it. Furthermore, we interpret the evidence in terms of our own intellectual make-up, conditioned as it is by the period and culture within which we were 169</page><page sequence="3">DAEDALUS brought up, our social and cultural background, our current assump tions and presuppositions, and our age and status."4 One example demonstrating the urgent necessity for such "hard doctrine" merits examination?the remarkable fable of the Great Mother Goddess. For Jacquetta Hawkes that goddess was so omni present and omnipotent in Bronze Age (Minoan) Crete that the civilization itself is labeled a "predominantly feminine force." The case rests on a group of small Neolithic figurines, averaging less than two inches in height, which she describes as follows: "The material evidences of the religious life of these Stone Age farmers consist very largely of formalized statuettes of women (carved or modelled) which they kept in their homes or sometimes provided with sacred houses of their own. In making these images they called attention to the reproductive function, giving them huge breasts and buttocks, and often the mountainous bellies of advanced preg nancy. Moreover they usually set them in a squatting position, which at that time may have been the accepted position for childbirth."5 Apart from Miss Hawkes's private fancy about feminine and mas culine forces in civilizations, her interpretation of the figurines is a restatement of what had become virtually received doctrine in archaeology.6 It has now been shattered beyond hope of rescue by the publication of Peter Ucko's book on the figurines.7 The total number of Neolithic Cretan anthropomorphic figurines known by 1969 was 103. Of these, only 28 are certainly female, 5 male, and 28 sexless; the remainder cannot be classified, primarily because of their fragmentary state. They sit, stand, kneel, and crouch as well as squat. "The majority of female figures have close set breasts which are flat and small and which project very little from the body," and anyway the assessment "is almost always largely subjective." Only two figurines have come from houses any where in Crete, none from any structure which can be identified as a shrine. Usually the find site can be described only as "general habitation debris." And there are also numerous animal figurines. The received view is thus an extreme case of the type that D. L. Clarke, a leading Young Turk in the field, criticized when he wrote, "The degree of confidence that we are logically justified in placing in many archaeological generalizations is often undermined by failure to specify the proportion of observed cases, the variety of circumstances or the existence of conflicting examples."8 The wonder is that no one before Ucko had bothered to examine systematically all the 103 Cretan figurines.9 Now "archaeologists and students of 170</page><page sequence="4">Archaeology and History prehistoric religion" are asked to "overhaul present theories very critically."10 Beyond doubt they must, but it is not mere Besser wisserei to point out that some of us?archaeologists as well as historians and anthropologists?have been challenging the Mother Goddess for years. Even without Ucko's breakdown, other methodo logical objections had been raised?for instance, that the Mother Goddess devotees made no effort to explain the complete disap pearance of these figurines in the Minoan period, and offered no foundation for their vast superstructure other than the vaguest subjective verbiage about the "meaning" of big breasts and heavy buttocks. It should be recorded that Ucko had published his Cretan analysis as early as 1962 in the authoritative official organ of the Royal Anthropological Institute,11 with little visible impact. How, then, do we interpret such remains as the anthropomorphic figurines? The archaeological Young Turks reject Piggott's kind of pessimism. "The argument," writes L. R. Binford, "that archaeolo gists must limit their knowledge to features of material culture is open to serious question; and second, the dichotomy between ma terial and nonmaterial aspects of culture itself and the relevance of this dichotomy for a proposed hierarchy of reliability have also been the subject of critical discussion ... It is virtually impossible to imagine that any given cultural item functioned in a socio-cultural system independent of the operation of 'non-material' variables. Every item has its history within a socio-cultural system?its phases of procurement of raw material, manufacture, use, and final discard ing . . . There is every reason to expect that the empirical properties of artifacts and their arrangement in the archaeological record will exhibit attributes which can inform on different phases of the arti fact's life history" ( my italics ) .12 Of course no one imagines that cultural items function inde pendently, least of all the pessimists whom Binford is attacking. The issue lies in the final sentence I have quoted. Is there any reason to expect what Binford expects, and significantly can offer only as an expectation rather than as a proposition for which there is available evidence? On the contrary, there is sufficient evidence that identical artifacts and arrangements of artifacts can result from different socioeconomic arrangements of procurement, manufacture, or distribution. For example, we know from the chance preservation of accounts inscribed on stone, that the most delicate stone carving on the temple in Athens known as the Erechtheum was produced by free men and slaves working side by side at the end of the fifth 171</page><page sequence="5">D DALUS century b.c. Nothing in the material remains (the carving itself) could have told us that. On the other hand, the surviving accounts of the temple of Apollo at Epidaurus, built thirty or forty years later, are of such a nature that the labor force is not specified. How does Binford imagine it will be possible to discover whether or not slaves were employed, at the highest skill level, on that temple?13 The most radical, elaborate, and sometimes brilliant argumenta tion will be found in Clarke's Analytical Archaeology already men tioned. For Clarke the crisis in archaeology is most obviously ex posed by the attempt to produce "imitation history books."14 His objective is to establish archaeology "as a discipline in its own right, concerned with archaeological data which it clusters in archaeologi cal entities displaying certain archaeological processes and studied in terms of archaeological aims, concepts and procedures . . . The entities, processes, aims, procedures and concepts of archaeology have a validity of their own in reference to the archaeological frame and despite their generation by?and partial correlation with?for mer social and historic entities."15 The "fundamental" archaeological entities are "the attribute, artefact, the artefact-type, the assemblage, the culture and the culture group."16 The major aims of the dis cipline are (1) "the definition of the fundamental entities"; (2) "the search for repeated similarities or regularities in form, function, association, or developmental sequence amongst the particular enti ties from every area, period and environment"; (3) "the develop ment of higher category knowledge or principles that synthesize and correlate the material at hand whilst possessing a high predic tive value. The development of increasingly comprehensive and informative general models and hypotheses."17 We know where we are now; the familiar polemic of the social scientist against history has been carried back into prehistory, though I am unable to discover in his more than six hundred pages what he means by "a general archaeological theory." Insofar as Clarke rests on a tautology?"an archaeological culture is not a racial group, nor a historic tribe, nor a linguistic unit, it is simply an archaeological culture"18?his sophisticated statistical procedures, requiring exten sive use of computers, will no doubt enhance and refine archaeologi cal inquiry considerably. However, it is apparent that he does not wish to be taken too literally. That is revealed by the way the word "function" creeps into the second of the "aims," and by the conven tional admission of social anthropology into the exclusive club.19 When he speaks of "religious data" and "religious artefacts," and 172</page><page sequence="6">Archaeology and History writes a short paragraph about Minoan Crete that includes such phrases as "embalmed within the conservative memory of the re ligious subsystem," "the later Minoan idealized bull cult," "a religious memory' or a cultural 'dream' of such a former trajectory,"20 one is entitled to protest not only that he has abandoned "archaeological procedures" but that he has descended to the excesses of the Mother Goddess fable.21 Furthermore, when Clarke leaves prehistory for periods for which there is some documentation, other than archaeological, he is sur prisingly happy if his archaeological analysis seems occasionally to coincide with written documentary evidence. I say "seems to" be cause it does not always do so as he claims, and because when it does, the coincidence is illusory. Of the former failing, I merely cite the inaccuracy and the misunderstanding of the nature of such Greek sources as Homer, Herodotus, and Eratosthenes, which per vade the paragraph that is supposed to provide literary substantia tion of his account of Hallstatt assemblages from the ninth to the fifth centuries b.c.22 For the second, there is a more significant example. Clarke reports a computerized analysis of more than one thousand "burial assemblages of weaponry and harness artefacts" of Turkic-speaking nomads between about a.d. 900 and 1300. The analysis produced a diachronic classification into four main groups, the transition to the fourth being marked by the replacement of horse gear in the women's graves by "distinctive new Mongolian types . . . earrings, mirrors, birch-bark head-dresses." "Historically," Clarke adds, "and by coin evidence it was possible to associate this change with the period of the Golden Horde invasions."23 Though the observations are no doubt accurate, the obvious comment is that, granting the Mongolian character of the objects can be estab lished from the objects themselves, no "archaeological procedures" would have revealed the "Golden Horde invasions," as Clarke's own wording concedes. Why, then, does he resort to what he has earlier labeled, pejoratively, a "nostalgic retreat into historiog raphy"? Why does he not leave the final transition as "unhistorio graphical" as the other three, for which there appear to be no dis tracting coins or documents? These questions raise the fundamental one of the purpose of the exercise. Why expend effort and financial resources to sort out in a time-series some four hundred years of burial assemblages?or to sort out, in any fashion, any group of past phenomena, prehistoric or historic? Is it only in order to achieve a more or less abstract classifi 173</page><page sequence="7">DAEDALUS cation of objects? To ask the question is to answer it. No one can make a claim for such a bloodless procedure, beyond the aesthetic one that can equally be made of a game of chess, the claim that ele gant precision has value for its own sake. Unless one is prepared, in the study of the past, to abandon all interest in change, growth, evo lution, in institutions, events, or the interrelationships among the dif ferent aspects of human society, I see no virtue in the insistence that any one type of evidence, or one type of analytical procedure, must be isolated from all other types?no virtue, in short, in Clarke's "va lidity of their own despite their correlation with social and historical entities." No more do I see any virtue, as I have already said, in the practice of historians who similarly neglect archaeological materials. And perhaps I should repeat that, on all available evidence, it is impossible to infer social arrangements or institutions, attitudes or beliefs from material objects alone. None of this is an argument against more and better quantifica tion of evidence. But it is an argument against the view, sometimes expressed explicitly, that what cannot be quantified cannot be dealt with at all, that only quantification produces "scientific" (as distinct from "subjective" or "ideological") analysis and results. The objection is simply that large areas of human behavior thereby disappear from the "scientist's" view altogether, including all histori cal events or series of events. This is the point at which I believe the Young Turks in archaeology and in history meet. Historical demographers are now able to provide complicated graphs of the trends in life expectancy, size of family, illegitimacy over long periods of time. These are important data for the history of the family, but they are not equal to the history of the family, and never will be. Likewise, it is interesting to know that central Asian women took horse gear to the grave with them in one period, and in another preferred earrings and mirrors, but no table of correlations will reveal the thinking and the value judgments behind the habits.24 Admittedly the latter kind of interest requires speculation, with a low coefficient of reliability, and explanations cannot be verified in the same way as frequency tables can be, but that seems insuffi cient ground for dismissing serious, disciplined efforts as mere "counterfeit history." II It is self-evident that the potential contribution of archaeology 174</page><page sequence="8">Archaeology and History to history is, in a rough way, inversely proportionate to the quantity and quality of the available written sources. It is also self-evident that the line between prehistory and history is not a sharp one, that for centuries after the introduction of writing, the historian's evi dence remains almost exclusively archaeological, at least for some civilizations, notably the Greek and the Roman. Perhaps the most frustrating example is that of the Etruscans: despite some 10,000 more or less deciphered texts and a considerable, though late and distorted, Roman tradition behind them, assemblages of artifacts remain not only the base of all accounts but nearly the whole of the evidence. An Etruscan tomb is nothing more than an assemblage of artifacts, despite the sophistication of the technology or of the wall-paintings, so long as there is no adequate literary key to the conventions and values represented by the artifacts. Nowhere is Piggott's hard doctrine more necessary, and nowhere is it more systematically ignored in a continuous outpouring of "counterfeit history"?with notable exceptions that need not be named here, though I cannot refrain from noting that what needs to be said in protest against the methods that produce that counterfeit history will be found in Massimo Pallottino's The Etruscans.25 For the earliest historical periods, an extraordinary complication is introduced by oral tradition and historical legends. The problem is then not simply one of correlating archaeological and literary evi dence but of using archaeology to assess whether, and how far, the literature has any worth at all. How difficult that is, and how little agreement has been reached so far, in large part because of unclarity about the canons of discrimination, are clear from the current de bates about the Minoan and Mycenaean civilizations and the Trojan War.26 Apart from the anomalous Linear B tablets, there is no con temporary written evidence for this long period, and it remains the ?province of the prehistorian rather than of the historian; in the final analysis the work is one of reconstruction from archaeology, even if one is prepared to take more from the legends than I am. The earliest Roman history presents a different situation, because it began late enough to fall within the period of literacy and be cause the Roman traditions about their origins, unlike the Greek, have the external appearance of a very detailed history, full of nar rative and of constitutional and institutional information ordered in a coherent time sequence. Roman history cannot be said to begin before the period of Etruscan rule, the sixth century b.c., and the contemporary documentation for the following century, the first 175</page><page sequence="9">DAEDALUS period of independence, though scrappy, includes annalistic frag ments and the Twelve Tables.27 The "histories" are of course very late?the early books of Livy, who died in a.d. 17, and of his con temporary, Dionysius of Halicarnassus, and several lives by Plu tarch, still later by about a century?and largely fictitious. However, Theodor Mommsen and others had already demonstrated, long be fore there was any relevant archaeology of value, that there are techniques by which some data could be pulled out, chiefly in the constitutional, legal, and religious spheres, to which one could with some confidence attach the name of genuine history. Today we have available a full synthesis of the archaeology of early Rome and its environs, unrivaled in Graeco-Roman archaeology in its complete ness, and it is important to assess its impact on the received view of early Roman history.28 In the first place, by itself it reveals perhaps less than some had hoped, in broad terms that sixth and fifth cen tury Rome was a fairly primitive village, with strong Etruscan traits, far removed from the great Livian Rome of the kings and early Republic, but one that was rising in its material level and its size by the end of the fifth century. In the second place, archaeology has confirmed the chronological outlines of the tradition?that is to say, historians are satisfied that it has, whereas the individual archaeolo gists most directly involved in the discussion insist, for some reason I am unable to fathom, that the literary chronology must be down dated by about half a century.29 And in the third place, we are in all other respects left with no tools of analysis other than those in herited from the nineteenth century, refined, occasionally supple mented by new epigraphic fragments, checked by modern com parative studies, but unchanged in their fundamental nature. From this particular, pessimistic report it is tempting to draw the rather paradoxical conclusion that the contribution of archaeology to history becomes greater as the volume and reliability of non archaeological evidence increase ( until the latter reaches the volume and nature of modern, even early modern, documentation ). There is truth in that proposition, I believe, but not the whole truth, as I shall illustrate in a moment. It would be pointless to catalogue the many important contributions archaeology has in fact made to our knowledge of ancient history. Instead, I have selected three further examples that raise major problems about future possibilities and needs, examples that fall within the field of economic history. The first example is at the same time a demonstration of the lim its of my paradoxical proposition?the history of what is convention n?</page><page sequence="10">Archaeology and History ally called Greek "colonization," in reality the history of Greek ex pansion between about 1000 and 550 b.c., to Asia Minor and the coastal areas surrounding the Black Sea in the east, to southern Italy, Sicily, and along both shores of the Mediterranean in the west. The Greek tradition, scattered in a multitude of writers from Herodotus to Eusebius, consists of a chronological framework ( and by the end in very precise dates ), anachronistic propaganda on be half of the Delphic oracle, and anecdotes. No history of coloniza tion was possible on that basis. Archaeology has confirmed the chron ological frame, though of course not the precise dates ( as with early Rome), but it has also achieved very much more. In combination with the literary materials, it has made possible a kind of history, not a narrative political account but a picture of settlement, growth, and movement, of urban organization, of trade and manufacture, of relations with the native populations, of cults and temples. The pic ture exists only in broad outlines, it is very incomplete, much is un certain and controversial, but hardly any of it could be derived from the ancient traditions alone?or from the archaeology alone.30 The lines of further archaeological exploration are now clear?and so are the difficulties and weaknesses in our methods of interpretation.31 The second example is the history of money and coinage in an tiquity. Systematic study began in the eighteenth century, but it was dominated, almost monopolized, by the interests of collectors until the last few decades, and that interest still retains a strong hold. However, the function of coins, as distinct from their rarity or their aesthetics, has become an increasingly prominent subject of research, and the results have been considerable. Discussions of money and coinage are uncommon in both Greek and Roman literature; only from the coin finds can significant conclusions be drawn about the volume of minting, for example, or the circulation of coin. As a pre liminary step, it was necessary to devise better techniques for dating Greek coins than the aesthetic canons that once prevailed ( since the coins lack dates and, before the Hellenistic period, portraits), and this has been achieved by intensive studies of the dies. It was also necessary to appreciate that coin hoards, not excavation coins, are the fundamental source of material; that hoards must therefore be published promptly and completely; that they must be subjected to proper, and not partial, statistical analysis. Other recent advances need not be enumerated. Nor need it be argued that what we now know, or think we know, about monetary history, as about the history of colonization, rests on archaeological evidence but not on 177</page><page sequence="11">D DALUS "archaeological" analysis. And the interpretation of the archaeologi cal evidence is the point at which the dialogue between historians, numismatists, and archaeologists is still unsatisfactory.32 My third example is a curiosity?the perverse refusal by some distinguished experts in the history of technology to permit either the historian or his documentation to make a contribution. They pre fer to write the history of technology largely, if not solely, from the artifacts, carrying Clarke's psychology to a reductio ad absurdum, without the saving grace of his rigorous techniques. The conse quences can be exemplified by comparing the first two volumes of the much praised A History of Technology, edited by Charles Singer and others,33 with the painstaking, often unrewarding, but always more fruitful and more accurate studies during the past decade or so, by scholars who combine the archaeological and documentary evidence in an investigation of agricultural technology in Gaul and other parts of the western Roman Empire.34 It will be apparent that much of what I have been calling an advance has been the consequence of a new focus, of new historical interests, and of new questions that the historian had not earlier put to himself, and therefore not to the archaeologists either. What do we now wish from the archaeologist, and, more narrowly, what have the new ways to offer to the ancient historian? Immediately I must express my belief that the rapid develop ment and application of sophisticated scientific techniques provide only a small part of the answer. Of course they have proved valu able, especially in locating the most promising places to explore. A more interesting example, providing stimulating implications, is the spectroscopic analysis which revealed that the obsidian (volcanic glass ) used for tools, by 6000 b.c. at the latest, in a region extending from southern Macedonia to Crete, all came from the island of Melos, where on present evidence there was no settlement for several thou sand years after the obsidian mining began.35 Or, as an example from the historical era, it is not yet possible to determine the source of the marble used in any specific Greek statue or building. The usual, and casual, statements about marble sources in archaeological reports turn out often to have been mere guesses of no value. However, new techniques open up the possibility in the future of answering a com plex of questions of the highest interest for social and economic history?questions such as: How much weight was given to costs, especially transport costs, in the decision to select one marble rather than another for any given temple, as against other considerations, 178</page><page sequence="12">Archaeology and History political, technological (the preference of the architect and the masons ), or aesthetic? Until now the information has been so lack ing that it has been pointless to tackle such a question ( and indeed no adequate study of quarries in antiquity has ever been under taken). Now the possibility exists, but its realization will require laborious examination on a large scale of widely scattered artifacts and of marble outcroppings.36 A note of caution about carbon-14 dating is also necessary here. It is a familiar complaint of prehistorians that classical archaeolo gists do not make proper use of this most widely known of all the new scientific techniques?an unjustified complaint. In the first place, the accumulated experience with carbon-14 dating has re vealed more eccentricities and complexities in the method than had originally been suspected. "The archaeologist," Clarke warns us, "can rarely, if ever, date excavated strata and their assemblages to precise points in time?all archaeological dates are relative, even the so-called absolute isotope decay darings."37 Furthermore, relative dates, or dates ?50 or 100 years, are virtually useless for the late Bronze Age, let alone the historical age. They will not help resolve such current controversies as the date of the destruction of Cnossus, the connection between the volcanic explosion at Santorini and the destruction of sites in eastern Crete, the dates of the earliest Greek colonies in southern Italy and Sicily. In the end, what ancient historians now require of archaeo logists is something much simpler, much more primitive?a willing ness to devote themselves to precisely formulated historical ques tions and a far greater consciousness of the value of statistics, for which pencil and paper and elementary numeracy are on the whole sufficient, though a simple computer would do no harm. Rostovtzeff made the point directly a generation ago. In discussing the extra ordinary position of Hellenistic Rhodes as the greatest entrepot and financial center, and perhaps the wealthiest city, of the Mediter ranean world, he wrote: We have only slight knowledge regarding the volume and the charac ter of the Rhodian transit trade. I have discussed the evidence which refers to it above and I have mentioned the stamped jar-handles of Rhodes and Cnidus, and the problems connected with them. One of the most important of these problems is that of their respective dates. A full catalogue of Rhodian stamps will certainly help us to establish their chronology. Some progress has been made in this direction. We are able to date a considerable group of stamps found at Pergamon (220 to 180). Another group of stamps found at Carthage is certainly earlier than the 179</page><page sequence="13">D DALUS year of the destruction of the city. Thus we have some indications with regard to those stamps which belong to the period between 220 and 146 b.c. . . . We require comparative statistics of the various stamps for each place where Rhodian stamps have been found in order to determine whether modern scholars are right in assuming that the Rhodian stamps of the period 220 to 146 are the most common stamps in all the centers of Rhodian commercial activity. As things stand, we must confine our selves to some very general statements [my italics].38 That was published in 1941. We still await the full catalogue and the comparative statistics, and we are still confined to very gen eral statements.59 The reluctance of archaeologists to embark on such projects ( comparable to the analysis of marbles I have already mentioned ) deserves sympathetic understanding. Archaeology is an expensive activity; patrons are chiefly attracted by the prospect of museum pieces, or of a public sensation. Presumably that is the psychological explanation of the fact that complete catalogues and comparative statistics are becoming increasingly common for coins, geometric pottery, archaic Greek sculpture, and the like, whereas Gjerstad's catalogue of the archaeology of early Rome remains an exception, the catalogue of Rhodian jar-stamps still a desideratum. Yet it is an explanation the historian cannot accept?and he is not by profession competent to do the work himself.40 Nor is it the whole explanation. A few years ago Snodgrass collected all the identifi able remains of cutting tools and weapons found in mainland Greece (excluding Macedonia) that could be dated in the period ca. 1050-900 b.c. His tabulation of these finds follows:41 Bronze Iron Swords 1 20+ Spearheads 8 30+ Daggers 2 8 Knives 0 15+ Axe-heads 0 4 No sensation there, yet this simple table answers a question that had not been posed in quite that way before, while vague statements were based on the Homeric poems and guesswork: How rapid was the shift from bronze to iron, not "in general," but in the decisive weapons and implements? Once the chronological question was formulated that way, the only correct way, no alternative re mained, if one wished an answer, to the total collection and tabula tion of the evidence. 180</page><page sequence="14">Archaeology and History That illustration?and I hasten to add that there are others?ex plains why I rank an interest in precise historical questions on a par with numeracy and closer attention to statistics in stating what I consider to be the urgent requirement in the immediate future. My own experience suggests that Snodgrass' task was exacerbated by the poor state of the archaeology and the archaeological report ing with respect to graves and grave-goods. I have twice in recent years tried to use such evidence, first for the complicated and ill understood linguistic situation in Roman Sicily, then for the history of military grave-goods in Greece during the late Bronze Age and the subsequent "Dark Age." Both times I was reduced to impres sionistic remarks and to complaints, much like those of Rostovtzeff about the Rhodian jar-stamps. In too few cemeteries have both the excavation and the subsequent publication been systematic and complete.42 Worse still, it would require a large research project on its own merely to collect the bibliography. Whereas the historian of Anglo-Saxon England has Audrey Meaney's Gazetter of Early An glo-Saxon Burial Sites,43 I know of no comparable guide to any district of Greece or any province of the Roman Empire.44 We have thus come full circle to Ucko and the Mother Goddess. To multiply examples further would be pointless.45 But it is nec essary to look at the other side, at the historian's needs from the viewpoint of the archaeologist.46 One common objection can be dis missed out of hand: classification and chronology are still uncer tain, it is argued, and until they are fixed more firmly, historical questions must wait. That is nothing but Cornford's Principle of Unripe Time. More serious is the plea that archaeologists are al ready overworked, that there is so much excavation still to be done, that publication would be even further delayed. There is no an swer to that, only a choice of values. Of what use, I should reply, is the vast outpouring of annual reports on the year's work from which nothing emerges except the occasional isolated fact, often canceled or corrected in the next year's work or the third or the fourth year's? Of what use are more and more excavations when so many older ones have not been fully reported, and no small number have not been published at all? And, finally, of what use is archaeology anyway, apart from the museum pieces that sometimes come out of the debris, if it leads to nothing more than reports? One solution that is being mooted to the genuine difficulty cre ated by overwork, insufficient manpower, and insufficient funds is the employment of good sampling techniques. I must demur. No 181</page><page sequence="15">DAEDALUS sampling technique is "good" except in terms of a predetermined range of questions. It would be a bold archaeologist who believed he could anticipate the questions another archaeologist or a his torian might ask a decade or a generation later, as the result of new interests or new results from older researches. Computer experi ence has produced examples enough of the unfortunate conse quences, in just this respect, of insufficient anticipation of the pos sibilities at the coding stage. A similar failure in archaeology is more harmful, because it is in the nature of archaeological exca vation literally to destroy?to destroy forever?whatever is dug up and neither fully recorded nor preserved.47 There is of course the crushing retort: tu quoque. That I accept, as I have already indicated. Ancient historians are also too often satisfied with impressions, too often nonnumerate and nonquanti tative, too often imprecise in the questions they put to themselves, about documentary as about archaeological evidence.48 Ill The Greek city of Akragas (modern Agrigento) in Sicily was famed for its wealth and its conspicuous consumption in the fifth century b.c. The visible symbol that still survives is the number and quality of its stone temples, perhaps ten of which were constructed in that one century. Ten is an extraordinary number and there are interesting social problems to be studied. But what is a fair stand ard for temple construction in this period? To answer that ques tion today would involve one in a massive research operation, for the reasons I have already given?the absence of gazetters, and, as I discovered when I looked at the question, of easily available sum mary statistics even for such major cities as Corinth or Miletus. In the absence of literary or epigraphical documentation, only archae ology can provide the figures (with an admitted margin of error), and the archaeologists have not done so. Temples are not paltry grave-goods; they are central to Greek art history and the volume of publications on the subject grows annually, but always by ex ample alone. I have introduced this illustration in closing not just to introduce one more complaint, but to pile a second paradox onto my earlier paradoxical half-truth. If it is often the case that the usefulness of archaeology to history increases with an increase in documenta tion, it is also the case that certain kinds of documentation render 182</page><page sequence="16">Archaeology and History archaeology more or less unnecessary. If one posed the Akragas question for the Middle Ages, one would find the answer in papal and diocesan records. And one final example. By an ingenious cal culation, based wholly on the results of stylistic analysis of re mains, R. M. Cook recently arrived at a reasonable estimate of the number of men engaged in the Athenian fine pottery industry in the fifth century b.c.49 That was an important contribution to eco nomic history. The same question about the English potteries in 1800 would be answered with far greater precision, and with a breakdown by skills and functions which remains out of reach for Athens, simply by going to the pottery archives. It is hardly sur prising, therefore, that the relatively new field of industrial ar chaeology remains a backwater. I should be much more surprised if it ever turns out to be more than that.

Indeed, my objections are strengthened by the pernicious influence this work continues to exercise; the very recent Technology in the Ancient World (London: Allen Lane Penguin, 1970), a popular introduction by an acknowledged expert, H. Hodges, for which the "two main sources" are the Singer volumes and R. J. Forbes's multi-volume Studies in Ancient Technology (Leiden: Brill, 1955-), reveals little interest in nonarchaeological evidence, and, it appears from the text, little acquaintance. Forbes, I hasten to add, does not belong to this school of thought. 34. See M. Renard, Technique et agriculture en pays tr?vire et r?mois (Brus sels: Latomus, 1959); J.
