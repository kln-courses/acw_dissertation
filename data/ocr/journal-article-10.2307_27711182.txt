<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Temptation of Milton's Eve: "Words, Impregn'd / With Reason" William G. Riggs, Boston University "Out of my sight, thou Serpent" (X. 867). In this harsh repudiation of Eve, fallen Adam's name-calling contrasts with his prelapsarian naming of the animals ("I nam'd them, as they pass'd, and understood / Thir Nature" [VIII. 352-53]) and has been taken to mark the advent of a language defective in the relation of word to thing?a defect seventeenth-century linguists had hoped to repair. But here, with Adam's domestic fustian, complications of truth and error suggest in Milton a more profound un derstanding of mental life than one will find in the taxonomic efforts of most early reformers. Adam's mis-naming expresses an effort of clarifi cation in which both fact (Eve's seduction by the serpent) and the emo tional reality of loss are made bearable by the creation of a coherent world (ironically, a recovered paradise of semantic accuracy) in which Eve's "shape, / Like his, and color Serpentine may show / [Her] inward fraud" (X. 870-71). But of course Adam's self-satisfying mot juste does not clarify, and the way language participates in his distortion of truth?here a mis-naming which is both metaphor and literal wish?might well seem relevant to a poet burdened by the logic of his own story with the conse quences of Adam's sin.1 Did Milton's powerful sense of fallen deficiency extend to his own lin guistic means? The suggestion has been frequently made and is sup ported by the fact of his familiarity with contemporary efforts of lan guage reform. Placed in this context, Paradise Lost can be seen to offer Milton a special opportunity to consider the original condition of the human intellect and to contemplate?indeed (if he chose) to fabricate? 1 Milton's poetry is quoted from John Milton: Complete Poems and Major Prose, ed. Merritt Y. Hughes (Indianapolis: Odyssey Press, 1957). Milton's prose will be quoted from Complete Prose Works of John Milton, ed. Don M. Wolfe et al., 8 vols. (New Haven: Yale Univ.

Milton did not, however, entertain simple hopes for edenic recoveries based on rationalist agendas?not, certainly, after the failures which attended the Restoration of Charles and not even earlier in the period of his marginal participation in con temporary efforts of pedagogical reform.2 His attitudes toward the high est uses of language refer always to something more than natural rea son: they refer to the literal belief in poetic inspiration he frequently proclaims in verse and prose; they refer also, as Georgia Christopher has urged, to the distinctly verbal sense of God's Word propounded by Ref ormation theologians (Luther and Calvin most notably);3 and they refer ultimately to an apocalyptic moment when God's creatures "May rightly answer" "with undiscording voice" ("Ata Solemn Music," 11. 18, 17). In timations of this final recovery are the gift of inspiration: an apprehen sion of the Word aided by the Spirit within. To "hear" God's Word and to speak responsively was a primary labor of faith for fallen men; in Mil ton's mind, I will suggest, it was a labor not absent from paradise itself. 2 In Of Education, for example, Milton declines to embrace Samuel Hartlib's Comenian project. For an assessment of Milton's linguistic attitudes in the context of contemporary reform, see Stanley E. Fish, Surprised by Sin: The Reader in "Paradise Lost" (New York: Mac millan, 1967), pp. 107-30.Jackson I. Cope has reviewed the significance to Milton of Ramism and its attendant linguistic and religious attitudes in The Metaphoric Structure of 'Paradise Lost" (Baltimore: Johns Hopkins Univ. Press, 1962), pp. 27-49. Since Cope and Fish, the issue of language in Milton has generated considerable discussion: Kathleen M. Swaim, in her wide-ranging study, Before and After the Fall: Contrasting Modes in 'Paradise Lost" (Amherst: Univ. of Massachusetts Press, 1986), has, like Cope, considered the relevance of Ramism to Milton's linguistic and epistemological concerns; Georgia B. Christopher's important study, Milton and the Science of the Saints (Princeton: Princeton Univ. Press, 1982), relates Milton to a Reformation epistemology in which the relation of language to the Word is fundamental; a Protestant "theology of the Word" (p. 17) is also central to Robert L. Entzminger's Divine Word: Milton and the Redemption of Language (Pittsburgh: Univ. of Pittsburgh Press, 1985). Leonard Mustazza's "Such Prompt Eloquence: "Language as Agency and Character in Milton's Ep ics (Lewisburg: Bucknell Univ. Press, 1988) lacks the conceptual center provided by Chris topher and Entzminger. To Leonard's recent study I am grateful for an enriching of my sense of the subject we share. His emphasis on naming complements my concern with the relation of language to cognition, but our commentaries overlap very little. Earlier studies by Anne Ferry, Milton's Epic Voice: The Narrator in "Paradise Lost" (Cambridge, Mass.: Harvard Univ. Press, 1963) and Milton and the Miltonic Dryden (Cambridge, Mass.: Harvard Univ. Press, 1968), offer important discussions of Milton's language, as does Patricia A. Parker's chapter on Milton in Inescapabable Romance: Studies in the Poetics of a Mode (Princeton: Prince ton Univ. Press, 1979)- See also John Guillory, Poetic Authority: Spenser, Milton, and Literary History (New York: Columbia Univ.

The paradise of "At a Solemn Music" may foreground the "perfect Diapason" (1. 23) of Unf?llen creatures, but the paradise of Paradise Lost is as much a description of human vulnerability as it is a model of what fallen creatures might hope to recover. The "in nocent" misdirections of our first parents (Adam's uxoriousness, Eve's ambition) express Milton's final unwillingness (or inability) to portray any human condition free of tension, error, and genuine moral choice. With respect to the rational retrieval of linguistic purity, Milton, un moved in the forties by such prospects, comes in Paradise Lost to present the supposed referent of these hopes?the Unf?llen language of Adam? as in fact participatory in the original catastrophe. How intimately the quality of edenic language and the mechanisms of thought it expresses are involved in the moral tensions of Milton's paradise is my subject here. It is a subject I find fully addressed in Milton's story, and it is a subject I find most searchingly dramatized in the temptation and fall of Eve.4 Paradise Lost, like many myths, seeks explanation in stories of origin. For Eve and Adam Milton invents two brief, aboriginal narratives which define female and male and respond with remarkable directness to an imagined experience of waking up for the first time adult and human.5 Born second, Eve tells her story first. She is responding to Adam's ini tial speech in the poem, a speech which has recalled ("for well thou know'st" [IV. 426]) the already imparted truth of their mutual condition in paradise. While this acknowledged repetition serves an obvious ex pository function, it also introduces us to the character of Adam and Eve's discourse?a discourse which continually builds on what is already 4Paradise Lost presents neither a developed theory of knowledge nor a complicated lin guistics. One may, indeed, turn elsewhere for Milton's views of these matters, most obviously to The Art of Logic (see note 14). But the poem conveys its own sense of mind and language, the coherences of which are fundamental to the myth of origin it constructs. Poststructur alist critical theory, it will be recognized, provides access to the questions of language I open here. By declining this access I am not seeking to deny its claim to interest. 5Eve's awakening and Adam's have been much discussed. For a range of recent com ment, see Fish, pp. 216-32; Lee A.

Already here in the "new utterance" (TV. 410) of Adam, a partial version of truth is being shaped to the fond domesticity of the moment: though their life together is his subject, Adam declines to mention his own superior membership. But what he omits Eve is eager to supply: Adam is " [preeminent by so much odds" (IV. 447); her own condition, blessed with such a partner, is "hap pier" than his in that he can find no "[l]ike consort" to himself (IV. 440-48). This "happiness," thus expressed, has offended many modern readers, but Adam's superiority to Eve is an issue vexed not just by mod ern response to the patriarchal assumptions of Milton's century; in her affectionate reply to what Adam has neglected to mention, Eve's enthu siasm, even more than her husband's kindly (and patronizing) suppres sion of their inequality, distorts: a "[l]ike consort" is what Adam has asked for and received from God, "exactly to [his] heart's desire" (see VIII. 357-451)- In the happy accords, then, of the poem's first human conversation a tension may be felt, a kindly pressure to misrepresent the reality of a marriage of peculiarly unequal equals, a marriage, indeed, whose dynamic has originated in error and whose first recorded words? "Return fair Eve" (TV. 481)?register loss. Eve's life, as she now tells it, has begun with a portentous mistake. Cre ated in response to Adam's erotic need, she has herself mistaken the proper object of desire. That Milton can make an original moment so conceived seem at all innocent is a tribute to his ability to capture in Eve an enthusiasm for new life; but the charm of Eve's beginning is fragile, the moment of her story being poised against cultural materials heavy with moral implication?the myth of Narcissus, Genesis itself?known stories with known endings which ask for a definitive reading of this be ginning. In the question of gender, the definition Milton supplies is more complex than is sometimes supposed: it is as much a matter of mind?of how men and women each comprehend the world?as of physical difference, emotional temperament, and hierarchical privilege. Having found herself "repos'd / Under a shade on flow'rs," Eve, as she recalls it, has begun her life by "wond'ring where / And what I was, whence thither brought, and how" (IV 450-52). In his parallel account, Adam will wonder "from what cause" (VIII. 270), and Eve's neglect of this question is significant.6 It narrows the range of her initial curiosity to her immediate surroundings and to herself, and it is toward an articula te Eve reports only Adam's later instruction that she is "of" him (IV 482). Satan, notably, refuses to acknowledge the cause of his being (V. 853-63).</page><page sequence="5">The Temptation of Milton's Eve 369 tion of these?object to object, subject to object?that she instinctively moves: Not distant far from thence a murmuring sound Of waters issu'd from a Cave and spread Into a liquid Plain, then stood unmov'd Pure as th' expanse of Heav'n; I thither went With unexperienc't thought, and laid me down On the green bank, to look into the clear Smooth Lake, that to me seem'd another Sky. (IV. 453-59) This "innocent" account of things seen and heard is by no means simple. It is organized?as indeed is the whole of Eve's first experience of sense and mind?in a way which establishes her cognitive signature in the poem. The organization is fundamentally conjunctive: things seen?lake and sky?are found similar, similarity being an instinctive discovery of "unexperienc't thought" which, in the retelling, results in a complex figure: "liquid Plain." Eve's disposition to perceive similarities in the ob jects of her attention seems an altogether natural response to the ques tion of what a newly awakened intelligence might do, but it is also a disposition of mind which can produce surprising conjunctions. To say "a murmuring sound / Of waters issu'd from a Cave" (compare Adam's "liquid Lapse of murmuring Streams" [VIII. 263]) is to ignore or sup press a distinction between a cause (waters which, in fact, issue from the cave) and its effect (sound)?a suppression relatable to Eve's initial neglect to question a cause.7 To emphasize causality is to acknowledge disjunction, causes being distinct from effects; the emphasis of Eve's thought and expression lies elsewhere. She displays a conjunctive play of mind which can be called fanciful (even "poetic") in a sense Mil ton would have both understood and approached with caution.8 When Eve's "liquid Plain" stands "unmov'd / Pure as th' expanse of Heaven," a sense of the harmony of matter and spirit is embraced "poetically" ("unmov'd / Pure") with a spontaneous conviction untroubled by con 7 Such suppression of normal distinction has suggested to some the special harmony of edenic life (see, e.g., the paradisal "airs" which both breathe "the smell of field and grove" and, with reference to choiring birds, "attune / The trembling leaves" [IV. 264-66]). The "problem" of Eve's "sound / Of waters" has been much noted. See in particular Christo pher Ricks (Milton's Grand Style [Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1964], pp. 100-2), who relates the water-sound conflation to Eve's conjoining of lake and sky. 8The associations of Eve with fancy and Adam with reason are familiar in commentary on Paradise Lost. For an instructive recent account see Swaim, esp. pp. 227-28. Milton's own cautions about fancy can be located early in his lines "On Shakespeare" ("fancy's child" in "L'Allegro") whose work is ambivalently praised for "bereaving" "our fancy of itself" and "mak[ing] us Marble with too much conceiving" (11. 13-14). This odd compliment is not, of course, a rejection of fancy which elsewhere can appear as the "High fantasy" which anticipates apocalyptic vision ("At a Solemn Music").</page><page sequence="6">370 Biggs cern for careful distinction. And indeed what Eve suddenly apprehends is a truth: for Milton the harmony of matter and spirit is real. But dis junction also discovers truth, the need to recognize and accept this being one important lesson of Eve's story. Milton's allusion to the myth of Narcissus makes this point initially. What I wish to notice especially is Milton's juxtaposition of this monitory allusion with his characterization in Eve of a mind drawn to organiza tions based on similarity, reluctant to dwell on difference, eager to see the world as one. This impulse ("desire," I will suggest, is the appropri ate word) extends in Eve to an ignored distinction between perceiver and perceived, subject and object. Thus Eve, looking into "the clear / Smooth Lake," sees not only "another Sky" but herself. Self-endearment, so Milton's allusion to Narcissus suggests, is partner with fancy; indeed, the suggestion may be that self-endearment is fancy's motive.9 Thought and desire are the central issues of Eve's story. The reflection in the lake becomes the object of Eve's desire, and the lesson she must learn?to accept a new erotic object?is also a correction of her dispo sition of mind. What she must learn to favor in Adam is something dif ferent?a choice she resists. Eve is "warn'd" by a divine voice that the "looks / Of sympathy and love" she has enjoyed have been her own and is led to Adam whom she discovers to be "less fair, / Less winning soft, less amiably mild, / Than that smooth wat'ry image" (IV. 467, 464-65, 478-80). In Adam, though she is told he is a true reflection, Eve recog nizes difference and rejects it: "back I turn'd" (IV. 480). More than the allusion to Narcissus, this gesture of refusal, the turning back ("Return fair Eve"), intrudes on the easy charm of Eve's story, quickening its pace and introducing an element of violence. Eve ("fair Creature") must be led, not without coercion ("thy gentle hand / Seiz'd mine"), to her con dition as a creature, and her acceptance of this condition requires "yield ing" to what in Adam is distinct from herself and superior (IV. 488-89): ... I yielded, and from that time see How beauty is excell'd by manly grace And wisdom, which alone is truly fair. (IV. 489-91) To accept Adam as the proper object of desire, Eve must be led to accept something different, something she was disposed by initial (and natural) inclination to reject, something to which she must now submit. Yet at the same time, lest Eve's reluctance seem less than "sweet," her submission 9 When, in Milton's famous description of paradise, nature holds the mirror up to nature (IV. 260-63), the reflected image is, like a poet, "with Myrtle crown'd." The suggestion in this that art, unlike nature, mirrors the artist would seem to anticipate Eve's "narcissistic" beginning.</page><page sequence="7">The Temptation of Mutons Eve 371 too forced, Milton supplies her with an instinctive enthusiasm for discov ery. Difference is new, and Eve endorses its masculine manifestation with an emphasis even Milton will not always allow: "manly grace / And wis dom which alone is truly fair." A balance is thus achieved between reluc tance and enthusiasm which serves for the moment to suggest a conjugal harmony, but the opposing impulses of this balance both have an un happy future: sudden enthusiasms for the singularly new and distinct will serve Eve as badly in her encounter with the "miracle" (IX. 562) of a talking serpent as will her prevailing inclination to see in the world a mirror of herself. Adam's own story of awakening in Book VIII recalls Eve's and serves as a timely focus for issues of mind, gender, and language which are soon to play out in the poem's climax. Whereas Eve, first harmonizing her world by the perception of likeness, gravitates toward self-contemplation and self-love, new-awakened Adam acknowledges more readily than she things distinct from himself. Indeed, his initial idea of God comes as a conclusion based on such a distinction: "[n]ot of myself; by some great Maker then" (VIII. 278). Whereas Eve quickly finds herself prostrate at the edge of Narcissus's pool, Adam "[s]traight" turns his "wondering eyes" "toward Heav'n" (VIII. 257), springs "upright" "[b]y quick instinc tive motion" (VIII. 259-60) and beholds a world apart and o/parts: "Hill, Dale, and shady Woods, and sunny Plains" (VIII. 262). Only "then," having borne witness to the world at large, does he "peruse" himself, a "[s]urvey" (VIII. 267-68) which immediately prompts questions of his own being: who, where, from what cause? To answer these questions Adam instinctively turns back to the presences which share his world: Thou Sun, said I, fair Light, And thou enlight'n'd Earth, so fresh and gay, Ye Hills and Dales, ye Rivers, Woods, and Plains And ye that live and move, fair Creatures, tell, Tell, if ye saw, how came I thus, how here? (VIII. 273-77) Like Eve, Adam seeks an answering sympathy, but the world he addresses is one of distinct entities, listed not conjoined, powers he wishes to in voke and engage in dialogue. The impulse is characteristic of Adam who is, indeed, indulging it now as he tells his story of origin to Raphael. Eve, who has remained silent during her first experiences of life, seems (at her presumed best) content to commune with Adam.10 The narrowness 10Until her encounter with the Serpent, we do not hear Eve speak (except in chorus with Adam) to anyone save her spouse, though at V. 395 "discourse" with Raphael is reported.</page><page sequence="8">372 Riggs of such contentment will register on the morning of the fall and create sympathies for Eve's rebellion that are difficult to resist. If Eve is to relin quish her original mirror for her spouse, why should her adventure into the world of difference end with him? Milton's gendered contrast in mental dispositions is not, of course, absolute. If Eve's first impulse is to embrace the sameness of things, she can obviously be led to acknowledge other ways of seeing. Adam too understands readily that the processes of thought and discourse involve both comparison and distinction, an understanding which has been ini tially exercised "for trial only" (VIII. 447) by God in an argument ("ce lestial Colloquy sublime" [VIII. 455] ) which Adam is allowed to win?the prize being Eve. This argument, recounted in Book VIII, dramatizes the fundamental processes of rational discourse about to be subverted in Book IX by desires which are themselves an elemental force in human intellection. Adam, as he relates the event to Raphael, has come to feel alone in a world wherein he is distinguished as lord and master. The uniqueness he has been so quick to perceive has left him unsatisfied; he seeks connec tion ("In solitude / What happiness" [VIII. 364-65]), taking his cue from comparison of himself with the animals who have just passed before him "two and two" (VIII. 350) to receive their names. God, in response to Adam's sense of solitude, urges this likeness to the animals; in that the animals "know, / And reason not contemptibly" (VIII. 373-74) they may serve as Adam's companions. Replying, Adam now insists on the differ ence between man and beast, seizing as he does so on the animals' al ready consorting "fitly ... in pairs" as a reason additional to hierarchical disparity why "brute / Cannot be human consort" (VIII. 394, 391-92). In stressing his distinctness from the animals (while at the same time taking his cue from their pairing), Adam compares himself to God: "Hast thou not made me here thy substitute ... ?" (VIII. 381), and God, responding, tweaks Adam with the audacity of such comparison by point ing out that He, "alone / From all Eternity," has no consort and must therefore lack the "nice and subtle happiness" Adam is proposing for himself (VIII. 399-406). Thus patronized, Adam responds submissively; having urged his likeness to God, he now acknowledges the crucial dif ference and wins thereby his point: Thou in thyself art perfet, and in thee Is no d?ficience found; not so is Man. . . . No need that thou Shouldst propagate, already infinite; And through all numbers absolute, though One; But Man by number is to manifest His single imperfection, and beget</page><page sequence="9">The Temptation of Mutons Eve 373 Like of his like, his Image multipli'd, In unity defective, which requires Collateral love, and dearest amity. (VIII. 415-26) With this acknowledgment of man's defectiveness "[i]n unity," Adam concludes a dialogue in which his ability to "judge of fit and meet" (VIII. 448) consists entirely of responding to and adjusting similarities and differences; the dialogue proceeds in terms of comparisons and dis tinctions between Adam, the animals, and God. This is my primary point. It can readily be seen, however, that the similarities and differences be ing here adjusted are also the realities of Milton's poem and that the logical procedures of Adam's discourse are, therefore, appropriate to the comprehension of what is. Adam is like and unlike the animals, like and unlike God. The creaturely defect in unity which distinguishes him from God is something he seeks to repair in the conjunction of marriage; in desiring Eve, Adam longs for a union which is both creaturely (different from God) and a proper imitation of God-head (like God). As Milton presents them, then, the natural mechanisms of human thought provide ideal access to a comprehension of being, though as the progressive corrections of Adam's colloquy with God indicate, misapprehension?a comparison which ignores distinction, a distinction blind to similarity? is a constant possibility. Being, as Raphael propounds it to Adam in Book V, consists precisely of a structure of similarities and differences. The "various forms, various degrees / Of substance" which comprise God's universal hierarchy cohere not just in a material sameness ("one first matter all" [V 472-74]) but in a sameness based on duplication, a point made when Raphael, distinguishing intelligential from rational substances, tells Adam that "both contain / Within them every lower faculty" (V 409-10). Higher levels of being, he thus maintains, compre hend ("contain") everything that lies below them within a greater inclu siveness which itself constitutes their distinctiveness. Raphael is describ ing the structure of being as both a hierarchy of differences and a tissue of analogy, a vision surely related to his later intimation to Adam that "Earth [may] / Be but the shadow of Heav'n, and things therein / Each to other like" (V 574-76).n Adam and Eve are created to comprehend such things; the conjunctive and disjunctive functions of their natural reason fit the structure of reality. The processes of intellect displayed by Milton in his two accounts of human origin are explained by Adam in his effort to account for Eve's 11 Raphael's description of universal order may be thought to reflect a Ramist emphasis on organization by genera and species. See note 14 below.</page><page sequence="10">374 Riggs Satanic dream. This explanation, while brief, is much noted, and its rele vance here will have no doubt been anticipated: . . . know that in the Soul Are many lesser Faculties that serve Reason as chief; among these Fancy next Her office holds; of all external things, Which the five watchful Senses represent, She forms Imaginations, Aery shapes, Which Reason joining or disjoining, frames All what we affirm or what deny, and call Our knowledge or opinion; then retires Into her private Cell when Nature rests. Oft in her absence mimic Fancy wakes To imitate her; but misjoining shapes, Wild work produces oft, and most in dreams, 111 matching words and deeds long past or late. (V. 100-13) While Adam is here ignorant of Satan's inspiring presence at Eve's ear, his description of Fancy's usurpation of Reason's function of "joining and disjoining" ("111 matching words and deeds long past or late") is appropriate to the content of her dream and suggests, thereby, an easy alliance between Fancy and the Devil who has, indeed, been portrayed "Assaying ... to reach / The Organs of her Fancy, and with them forge illusions" (IV 801-3; my emphasis). Satan works through man's natural faculties, the functions of which must therefore be significant in Milton's consideration of human fallibility?significant and also standard in the epistemology of Milton's age.12 Most modern commentary on Adam's speech refers us to commonplaces of Renaissance faculty psychology; so too Adam's voiced concern with the usurping power of fancy serves to authorize seventeenth-century warnings against the delusive effects of such things as poetry. Bacon, to pick an obvious contemporary authority, could voice Adamic concern that "imagination . . . being not tied to the limits of matter, may of pleasure join that which nature hath severed, and sever that which nature hath joined, and so make unlawful matches and divorces of things."13 Bacon's subject here is poetry, and his warning, if we embrace Milton's aboriginal myth, would originate in Adam's sense of 12See Swaim's account (pp. 224-38) and her useful bibliography. Swaim's view "that Adam's reason needs and is incomplete without Eve's fanciful nature" (p. 228) anticipates my own (as does her discussion of V. 100-13) but suggests, I think, that reason is too exclu sively an Adamic virtue. Swaim also appears to read "mimic Fancy" as a faculty distinct from fancy (p. 229). I take the adjective to describe a function of fancy itself, the function Satan is employing. 13 Quoted (from The Advancement of Learning, [The Works of Francis Bacon, ed.

The oddity, however, serves to emphasize how deeply Milton felt his story as a warning and how central the issue of what Bacon calls "mismatching" is to the cautionary empha sis of Paradise Lost. From the first introduction of its human protagonists, and most particularly in the story of Eve's awakening, the poem's ten sions have been related to intellectual errors which may be attributed to fancy. Adam's morning-after explanation of how Eve's mind may have participated in the " [w]ild work" of her dream abstracts a conception of the human mind already displayed in her account of origin, an account which looks forward and back in the poem and in our culture. Eve's beginning, of course, points most urgently to her participation in the fall, which to consider we must return to the nexus of thought and language. In an early apostrophe to his native tongue ("At a Vacation Exercise," 11. 17-25) Milton adopts the conventional metaphor of lan guage as the clothing of thought; later, in The Art of Logic, he would trans mit without qualification the notion that "reason can be used, and even used extensively, without speech" (CP, 8:216). But if Milton could some times allow himself to consider language as an instrumental conveyance 14While Adam's description of reason's way with relation repeats the commonplaces of faculty psychology (in particular the reason's general function of sorting information on the basis of similarity and dissimilarity), it also characterizes the essential mechanisms of Ramist logic, the influence of which extended to Milton. Ramism, as Milton transmitted it in his Art of Logic (produced in the 1640s and published in 1672), systematizes what is natural to mental life, natural procedures being one of its central claims. Notorious for dichoto mizations, Ramist logic organizes subjects (and by implication reality itself) by the subdivi sion of general categories into more particular and usually dichotomous subcategories. Adam's statement about "joining and disjoining" describes such an operation exactly: to dichotomize subject A into B and C in the Ramist manner, one asserts both that B and C are disjoined (often as contraries) and joined in A, the more general heading (cf. Raphael's description of higher levels of being "containing" lower levels). But while Ramist concep tions of logical process are throughout binary (yes/no, joined/disjoined), one need not, I think, read Paradise Lost for a systematic application of a Ramist principles. Adam's expla nation is general enough to have seemed unexceptional (and therefore seminal) to anyone familiar with traditional notions of discourse, from Plato to Hobbes; indeed his statement seems almost inevitable once an epistemological question has been asked. See, however, Jacobus, pp. 119-66, and especially Swaim's authoritative study. For my own view of Milton's relation to Ramism, see "Poetry and Method in Milton's Of Education," Studies in Philology, 89 (1992), 445-69.</page><page sequence="12">376 Riggs subsequent to thought ("but the instrument convaying to us things use full to be known" [CP, 2:369]), he was also aware of the power of lan guage to lead thought, an awareness evident not only in the exalted claims he frequently made for poetry but in his persistent association of villainy with false eloquence and his sensitivity to the dangers of self intoxication for those possessed of linguistic pretensions. Indeed the remarkable reticences of Milton's own poetic career?the deferral, no tably, of a main project which is so insistent a gesture in the early po etry?seem determined in part by a concern for the self-deluding poten tial of his own remarkable talent for words?a concern which continues to register in his invocations to the Muse in Paradise Lost where the sense of linguistic ease, of "unpremeditated" (IX. 24) utterance, becomes at last a matter only of faith in the acknowledgment that his poem, his great temple of words, might "all be mine" (IX. 46), self-raised and therefore, "as once / Bellerophon" (VII. 17-18), self-destructive. Intellectual ambition is, of course, a central theme in Paradise Lost; in Milton's Eden the exhilaration of new knowledge confronts the caution ary lesson of place. That an exhilaration of expression should be simi larly subject to restraint is perhaps less obvious. In the "prompt elo quence" (V 149) of our parents' great morning prayer, for instance, the spontaneous power of edenic utterance to set the universe spinning in celebration of God might seem a full display of innate linguistic adequacy. But the linguistic liberty there celebrated?a "various style" (V 146) to correspond to the "[vjariety without end" (VII. 542) of cre ation?is not absolute. The hymn, descending as it does through "vari ous degrees / Of Substance" (V 473-74), addresses an ordered universe, its "strains" are not unlicensed but "fit" (V 148), its beginning an ac knowledgement of linguistic inadequacy: These are thy glorious works, Parent of good, Almighty, thine this universal Frame, Thus wondrous fair; thyself how wondrous then! Unspeakable. ... (V. 153-56) As with Milton himself so with Adam and Eve a declaration of limit and the invocation of mediating aid are the enabling conditions of linguistic power ("Speak yee who best can tell, ye Sons of Light" [V 160]), and as with intellectual inquiry so with verbal expression the freedoms of Mil ton's paradise are not absolute. With some sense, then, of linguistic limi tation in Milton's Eden, we may turn to Eve at her most beautiful poetic moment. As the evening of Satan's first day in paradise approaches, Eve cele brates the "sweetness" of her life with Adam:</page><page sequence="13">The Temptation of Mutons Eve yjl With thee conversing I forget all time, All seasons and thir change, all please alike. Sweet is the breath of morn, her rising sweet, With charm of earliest Birds; pleasant the Sun When first on this delightful Land he spreads His orient Beams, on herb, tree, fruit, and flow'r, Glist'ring with dew; fragrant the fertile earth After soft showers; and sweet the coming on Of grateful Ev'ning mild, then silent Night With this her solemn Bird and this fair Moon, And these the Gems of Heav'n, her starry train: But neither breath of Morn when she ascends With charm of earliest Birds, nor rising Sun On this delightful land, nor herb, fruit, flow'r, Glist'ring with dew, nor fragrance after showers, Nor grateful Ev'ning mild, nor silent Night With this her solemn Bird, nor walk by Moon, Or glittering Star-light without thee is sweet. (IV. 639-56) This lavish encomium bears the special stamp of Eve's sensibility as mani fested in her first moments of life. The sympathetic "joining" which leads initially to her own reflected image here reappears in the funda mental assertion of her poem?"All . . . alike"?and in the anthropo morphic coloring she applies to her "sweet" world, a world which re flects her own image and Adam's. For Eve the world is sexual; gender defines the relation of its aspects. Later, from the loftiness of an angelic perspective, Raphael will endorse the justness of this view (VIII. 140-52), but if Eve has here apprehended a truth, it is an apprehension exactly suited to the leading tendency of her intellect. "[T]he fertile earth," "fragrant . . . after soft showers," suggests the gentle pressure of fe male reluctance ("sweet reluctant amorous delay" [IV 311]); the "morn" ("the breath . . . her rising") is graciously Eve-like, as is "this delight ful Land" on which an Adamic sun "spreads / His orient beams." The "sweetness" of the feminized "morn" is applied to "grateful Ev'ning mild" (Eve's name may perhaps be heard) and the presences of "silent Night / With this her solemn Bird and this fair Moon, / And these the Gems of Heav'n, her starry train" are both feminine and imperial. This feminine coloration is altogether attractive and suggests no censurable confusion on Eve's part. Her picture of things is, indeed, so close as to seem an echo of the narrator's own description of "the Moon / Rising in clouded Majesty, at length / Apparent Queen" (IV 606-8)?an imme diate anticipation of Eve's words which serves to authorize her anthro pocentric procedures. But as the narrator's description of the moon is marked as fanciful ("Apparent Queen") this authorization seems also a comment on the character of Eve's language which is, throughout, more</page><page sequence="14">378 Riggs "poetic" than Adam's. We have a context for considering mental and linguistic fancy, one established by Eve's initial error. The peculiar fea tures of Eve's lovely tribute to Adam are remarkably responsive to this context. The often noted structural feature of Eve's poem is the da capo repeti tion in which those things listed as "sweet" with Adam (11. 641-49) are re-listed (11. 650-56) as not sweet without him. Eve's self-quotation can surely be described as an echo, a structure (and a mythical allusion) which directs us back to the "narcissism" of Eve's initial experience and may encourage, thereby, a less than generous response to what in so many ways is a moment openly soliciting our admiration for Eve. We might say, for example, that Eve's self-quotation suggests an attraction to her own words (they are attractive) and that this attraction hints at a self involvement notably at odds with the gesture of offering "all" to Adam. We can also wonder at the progress of a song which manages to move (if one ignores the logic of its turn to the negative) from an expression of union ("[w]ith thee") to an expression of separation ("without thee"), and even when we credit the logic of the negative, "nothing is sweet with out you" seems, in its foregrounding of absence, a more troubling affir mation than the one Eve began with. Such responses, to be sure, depend on a concern for where Eve is headed and in fact seem urgent only in retrospect when Satan, visiting Eve's slumbers, appeals to her own self quoted words in a dream.15 The link between Eve's dream and her tribute to Adam is the question which follows?it would seem by free association?from what she has observed of the sweetness of her world: "But wherefore all night long shine these, for whom"? (IV. 657). For whom, that is, shine "the Gems of Heav'n, her starry train?" An answer to this question has in fact been supplied by her own formulation: they shine for "her," they are "her starry train;" but the referent for "her" is less than clear. The pronoun may be supposed to refer to "this fair Moon" whose imperial status has already been suggested by the narrator forty-five lines back ("Apparent Queen"), or it may refer (more readily) to "silent Night" who, in an altogether natural sequence, would then seem accompanied by "her sol emn Bird," her moon, and "her starry train." The question would seem hardly pressing were it not precisely the question Eve asks: "for whom?" Moreover, the question, thus raised, allows another answer, one encour aged by the anthropomorphism which has peopled Eve's world with feminine presences. This is the answer Satan will supply in Eve's dream: they shine for "thee:" 15Parker, pp. 114-23, usefully connects Eve's serenade and her dream.</page><page sequence="15">The Temptation of Mutons Eve 379 Why sleep'st thou Eve? now is the pleasant time, The cool, the silent, save where silence yields To the night-warbling Bird, that now awake Tunes sweetest his love-labor'd song; now reigns Full Orb'd the Moon, and with more pleasing light Shadowy sets off the face of things; in vain, If none regard; Heav'n wakes with all his eyes, Whom to behold but thee, Nature's desire, In whose sight all things joy, with ravishment Attracted by thy beauty still to gaze. (V. 38-47) Adam is certainly right, the morning after, to discover in Eve's dream "resemblances . . . / Of our last Ev'ning's talk" (V 114-15) produced, as he suggests, by "misjoining." Satan, applying himself to Eve's fancy (de sire) , creates from the language of her own serenade a fully self-centered version of her relation to the world. The courtly erotics of Eve's anthro pomorphic metaphors ("the Gems of Heav'n, her starry train") are here literalized with Eve displacing the feminine presences of her song and becoming herself the object of "all. . . eyes." Such adoration, which can serve only to promote a similar response in herself, should be related to Eve's first waking moments. Then it was Adam who drew Eve from the self-absorption of the "answering looks / Of sympathy and love" that gazed back at her from the "Smooth lake." Now, under the pressure of Satan's presence, a regression may be felt?not least in the fact that the dream-voice Eve has supposed was Adam's is in fact the echo of her own. In this confusion of spouse and self Eve's initial lesson in difference ap pears unsecured. What here deserves special notice is the authority Eve's dream attains by echo, the appeal of which (already evident in the structure of Eve's tribute to Adam) may suggest the persuasive power of words registered and heard again. Evil thoughts, in Adam's famous assessment, "into the mind of God or Man / May come and go, so unapprov'd, and leave / No spot or blame behind" (V 117-19), but thoughts articulated?so Eve's experience of her own words argues?constitute a significant gesture to ward choice. The importance of language in Eve's subsequent tempta tion supports this suggestion. On the morning of the fall, Eve's new proposal to pursue her garden ing labors alone begins, in the manner of her dream, with a repetition of things previously spoken, this time by Adam for whom the prospect of early morning work has argued the need for early retiring: Tomorrow ere fresh Morning streak the East With first approach of light, we must be ris'n, And at our pleasant labor, to reform Yon flow'ry Arbors, yonder Alleys green,</page><page sequence="16">380 Riggs Our walk at noon, with branches overgrown, That mock our scant manuring, and require More hands than ours to lop thir wanton growth. (IV. 623-29) Eve's echo of Adam's urgings is too exact not to be pointed: Adam, well may we labor still to dress This Garden, still to tend Plant, Herb and Flow'r, Our pleasant task enjoin d, but till more hands Aid us, the work under our labor grows, Luxurious by restraint; what we by day Lop overgrown, or prune, or prop, or bind, One night or two with wanton growth derides Tending to wild. (IX. 205-12) Here the repetition of key phrases?"pleasant labor," "[m]ore hands," "wanton growth"?suggests an appeal to the authority of what might, within the now brief span of human history, be called an oral tradition: as you said, so now say I. The point, however, is that such authority as may adhere in the words of this tradition is an uncertain thing. By echo ing Adam's description of nature, Eve lends weight to her statement, but the tenor and tone of what she says are far different from Adam's almost playful urging of reasons why they should together seek the nightly re pose which will, in its connubial way, promote an acquiring of "[m]ore hands." Indeed, Eve's purpose?"Let us divide" (IX. 214) ?is exactly op posite to Adam's and expresses her increasingly urgent adventure into the heady world of difference?an adventure which returns her, para doxically, to the self-absorption of her first experience. This return is significant in Milton's understanding of human psychol ogy. What Eve has now made of her initial lesson of difference is a hostile (and self-serving) relationship. Nothing remains of Adam's good humor in Eve's version of "wanton" nature; nature, in its aggressive growth, holds her in serious "derision." One need not, I think, appeal to mod ern theories of narcissism to understand that her defensive hostility is a reassertion of self-love in a world now recognized as distinct and lim iting; Milton's own considerable experience of self-esteem and failure prepared him to understand this?with considerable feeling. Earlier in his career his most telling artistic response to the recognition of self limitation had been a protective exclusivity: "the sage / And serious doc trine of Virginity" (Comus, 11. 786-87). In Paradise Lost he imagines in the idea of marriage a more mature compromise between the compet ing claims of self-love and the self-limiting presence of the other. "Oft times," as Raphael puts it in offering marriage counsel to Adam, "noth ing profits more / Than self-esteem" (VIII. 571-72); but oft-times?wit</page><page sequence="17">The Temptation of Mutons Eve 381 ness Eve?not. The marriage of individuals is a compromise, as Milton saw, which creates inevitable tension?a tension here felt most sharply by Eve who, the "inferior" partner with more difficult access to self esteem, seems more than Adam the psychological protagonist o? Paradise Lost. That Eve's hostile relation to "wanton" nature rearranges her ear lier attraction to herself is most obvious in the fact that the enemy she here isolates remains in its "wanton" opposition an image of herself. It is her own impulse to growth, on this the last day of innocence, that she imputes to a nature growing, as she puts it in words describing her own sense of constrained energy, "[l]uxurious by restraint." At once divided from her garden world and gesturing toward union (indeed complicity) with it, Eve's condition is powerfully volatile. Adam initially responds to Eve's new proposal by appealing, as did she, to the history of their shared discourse; he begins ("Sole Eve, Associate sole .../... above all living Creatures dear" [IX. 227-28]) by recalling the first words we have heard him speak ("Sole partner and sole part of all these joys / Dearer thyself than all" [IV 411-12]), and he proceeds with a rearticulation of their condition as creatures and the behavior appropriate to it, recurring as he does so to the hands ("joint hands," "younger hands" [IX. 244, 246]) which are at issue in Eve's r??valuation of the labor problem in paradise. The insufficiency of hands, which for Adam urged a procreative coupling, has become for Eve the occasion ("until more hands") for independent effort. Adam attempts to bring the matter of hands back to mutuality and children, but what Eve is dis posed to hear in this, the most "domestic" (IX. 318) of Adam's three responses to her proposal, are his brief concession to her point of view ("solitude sometimes is best society" [IX. 249]) and those aspects of his concern which emphasize their difference, her inferiority: The Wife, where danger or dishonor lurks, Safest and seemliest by her Husband stays, Who guards her, or with her the worst endures. (IX. 267-69) As their argument heats up, Adam's language will modulate impressively away from such evasive sententiousness to, finally, a God-like definitive ness (IX. 343-68), but his reluctance to command (anticipated here in the way he amends "guards her" to "with her . . . endures") is serious, and his rhetorical effort has less effect on Eve, whose intransigence only increases as things proceed, than on himself. Indeed, one can say of this debate that the exercise of speech has far more effect on speakers than on auditors. Eve, adopting a diction appropriate to Raphael's recent account of the war in Heaven, transforms herself into the warfaring Christian:</page><page sequence="18">382 Riggs How are we happy, still in fear of harm? But harm precedes not sin: only our Foe Tempting affronts us with his foul esteem Of our integrity; his foul esteem Sticks no dishonor on our Front, but turns Foul on himself. (IX. 326-31)16 Adam, burdened by the demands of executive fiat, collapses into linguis tic disarray: Seek not temptation.. . . Wouldst thou approve thy constancy, approve First thy obedience; th' other who can know, Not seeing thee attempted, who attest? But if thou think, trial unsought may find Us both securer than thus warn'd thou seem'st, Go; for thy stay, not free, absents thee more. (IX. 364-72) The tortuous syntax that follows Adam's command marks his capitu lation to, among other things, nonsense. Eve is not sallying forth to strengthen virtue and increase watchfulness; she is in fact imagining her independence as simple liberation, even as a way of avoiding the enemy ("The willinger I go, nor much expect / A Foe so proud will first the weaker seek" [IX. 382-83] ). When Adam regains his linguistic feet ("Go; for thy stay, not free, absents thee more"), he no longer speaks with God like authority; he has instead, resorting to paradox, recast himself as an injured and petulant lover. With hindsight it is hard not to see in Adam and Eve's morning argu ment a powerful indictment of human reason and the language which attends it. The language of paradise here fails to promote best choices. In his efforts to dissuade Eve, Adam is able to summon up a clear state ment of what is and should be, but the force of articulated truth does not suppress powerful desires, neither Eve's nor his own. For Eve, speech serves to express feelings of constriction which, as she utters them, are valorized by the inevitable self-satisfaction of coherent utterance: "Frail is our happiness, if this be so, / And Eden were no Eden thus expos'd" (IX. 340-41). In such triumphant rhetoric, we hear her increasingly self convinced?and, for better or worse, convincing. Clearly it was not just the fall that had, for Milton, created the delusive and self-delusive force of language, and this misuse of language in paradise?so evident here in the morning argument?is nowhere more emphatically foregrounded 16Eve is also echoing Adam: "misdeem not then, / If such affront I labor to avert" (IX. 301-2). Milton frequently uses "front" in a military context (I. 563; II. 683; II. 716: rV. 865; VI. 105; VI. 558; VI. 611; XII. 592; XII. 632).</page><page sequence="19">The Temptation of Mutons Eve 383 than in what follows. Eve, having won her point, soon loses to a serpent whose "miracle" (IX. 562) is speech.17 The loss, of course, is initially experienced as the recovery of a whole ness and adequacy felt prior to the advent of Adam who first appeared to Eve bearing the lesson of difference, inferiority, and dependency. As serpent, Satan need only supply an answering sympathy to the wish for this recovery, and his method is brilliantly matched to the original dis position of mind which remains a part of the wish. He appeals to Eve's "fancy," to her impulse to conjoin, to her self-centering attraction to the world as mirror or extension of herself. This appeal is basic to the struc ture of Satan's argument (to be God-like you should be snake-like: eat the fruit) ,18 but it is also subtly displayed in the verbal aspect of Satan's ser pentine art. His overt argument?the fruit is good not deadly, it elevates, increases knowledge, promotes freedom, witness me?is supported by a language which plays off the history of edenic utterance and utilizes, as a source of appeal, Eve's easy attraction to similitude and echo. The episode as a whole echoes, of course, Eve's Satanic dream which was in turn echoing the language of her evening tribute to Adam. That a linguistic strategy continues to be employed by Satan Milton does not spare to emphasize. The serpentine disguise itself (entered "in at his Mouth" [IX. 187]) is heavy with linguistic implication, the creature's physical gestures?"[insinuating" (IV 348), "voluble" (IX. 436), "re dundant" (IX. 503), [w]ith tract oblique" (IX. 510)?being apposite to the style of "Serpent Tongue / Organic" (IX. 529-30) :19 Wonder not, sovran Mistress, if perhaps Thou canst, who are sole Wonder, much less arm Thy looks, the Heav'n of mildness with disdain, ZXspleas'd that / approach thee thus, and gaze Insatiate, I thus single, nor have fear'd Thy awful brow, more awful thus retir'd. Fairest resemblance of thy Maker fair, Thee all things living gaze on, all things thine By gift, and thy Celestial Beauty adore With ravishment beheld, there best beheld Where universally admir'd. (IX. 532-42; my emphases) 17Christopher, p. 160, calls the temptation episode a "logomachy." Leonard discusses the temptation as a "corrupting of Eve's language" (p. 192; see pp. 199-213). For a remark ably different view of the separation colloquy (" 'a mutuall help to piety' ") see McColley, pp. 140-86. 18 Cf. Adam who gains a wife by distinguishing himself both from beast and God. 19See Ricks, p. 108, on "voluble" and "insinuating."</page><page sequence="20">384 Riggs Anyone with an ear for Milton's poetic manner will hear it in these lines. He "learned early," as William Riley Parker puts it, "his characteristic tricks of echo and repetition,"20 nor did he hesitate to extend the re sources of his accomplishment to Satan?as auditors more experienced than Eve have felt. But here it seems fair to insist that a characteristic of Miltonic eloquence is being exaggerated for the special occasion. The insistent redundancies of this speech, the wave-like rhythm (cf. volubilis) created by repetition, replicate the insinuations of a serpentine presence and seem fashioned to Eve's taste for the satisfactions of echo?satisfac tions which urge a special affinity between Eve and the serpent: "Wonder not, sovran Mistress . . . who are sole Wonder." Logically, this statement distinguishes: Eve is a wonder; the serpent is not. But the distinction is overridden by the repetition of "Wonder" which encourages a sense of kinship between Eve and what she supposes the talking serpent (also) to be?like herself a "miracle," a "wonder:" Redouble then this miracle, and say, How cam'st thou speakable of mute, and how To me so friendly grown above the rest Of brutal kind, that daily are in sight? Say, for such wonder claims attention due. (IX. 562-66) The "wonderful" serpent now represents himself to Eve as an emissary of "all things," all of which adore her "Celestial Beauty." It is a power fully familiar arrangement. Eve ("sole Wonder"), encountering a re sponsive "wonder" which now, "redoubling," speaks for everything, is again offered the mirror of her first experience wherein the world had reduced itself to "answering looks / Of sympathy and love" (IV. 464-65). Universal admiration, unimpeded self-esteem, the promises of Eve's Sa tanic dream, are being once more proffered in the redundancy of Satan's articulation. He begins with wonder adoring wonder; he ends his initial speech promising a divine mirror of admiration, Eve a "Goddess among Gods, ador'd and serv'd / By Angels numberless, [her] daily train" (IX. 547-48). The promise echoes back through Eve's dream of heaven's beholding her "with all his eyes" (V, 44) to her own version of an impe rial night (or moon) attended by "the Gems of Heav'n, her starry train" (IV. 649). The echoing song Satan now sings has, in short, the seductive ness of an old refrain. The self-approval Eve longs for is omnivorous in its aspirations. To be come "universal Dame" (IX. 612), as the serpent calls her, she must be at once the object of admiration and the subject. The admiring universe must also be herself, and her preliminary gestures toward such Godhead 20William Riley Parker, Milton, 2 vols. (New York: Oxford Univ. Press, 1968), 1: 42.</page><page sequence="21">The Temptation of Milton's Eve 385 consist in identifying herself with the things which both promote and impede her desires?with the serpent whom she will imitate, with God and His interdiction (which she must somehow appropriate and neutral ize), and with the forbidden tree with which she will invent a special relationship. Her resource, following Satan's lead, is a language which promotes in extra-rational ways (as with the word, "wonder") the col lapsing of important distinctions between self and other. The first crisis of her negotiations with the serpent occurs as she is led to the tree in question. She must, perforce, acknowledge it an obstacle to desire: Serpent, we might have spar'd our coming hither, Fruitless to mee, though Fruit be here to excess, The credit of whose virtue rest with thee, Wondrous indeed, if cause of such effects. (IX. 647-50) But Eve's distinction between tree and self is at best half-hearted, the tree being included in the morning's ensemble of "wonders" and identified with her condition by the play of verbal wit: "Fruitless to mee."21 One may note here the enlivening of a dead metaphor (for Eve, given the prohibitive circumstance, the tree is literally without fruit), but this pri mary sense of "Fruitless" is radically unstable, referring as it does to a fruitful tree. It is in fact Eve, deprived of the tree's fruit, who feels "Fruit less;" her word for the tree is self-description, self-description that strikes at the heart of her sense of self as she has come to understand it: Hail Mother of Mankind, whose fruitful Womb Shall fill the World more numerous with thy Sons Than with these various fruits the Trees of God Have heap'd this Table. (V. 388-91) Thus Raphael, about to share the abundance of Eve's hospitable board, has encouraged Eve to imagine herself tree-like. Now, in the presence of this "[l]oaden" (IX. 577) tree?like Eve the desired object of "[a] 11" (IX. 592)?"fruitful" Eve suffers a sense of deprivation deepened by its contradiction of what she knows to be her place in the world. But the emo tional logic of "Fruitless," taken as self-description, suggests a ready rem edy for this sense of diminished selfhood. It is the remedy Satan urges. To embrace the serpent's offer Eve must of course confront another obstacle, the word of God itself: But of this Tree we may not taste nor touch; God so commanded, and left that Command Sole Daughter of his voice; the rest, we live Law to ourselves, our Reason is our Law. (IX. 651-54) 21 Ricks, pp. 73-74, notices also a pun on "to excess" but credits it to Milton not Eve.</page><page sequence="22">386 Riggs Eve's metaphor here, "Daughter of his voice," translates Bat Kol from the Hebrew. It is a striking expression and Milton's reaching for it at this juncture seems strongly pointed. Bat Kol, a disembodied voice of divine origin or reference, was understood as the Hebraic name for echo, a meaning which plays against Eve's situation in complex ways.22 As a de scription voiced by Eve of God's command, "Sole Daughter of his voice" responds first to her established tendency to refer things to herself; it also, in its analogical peculiarity (command/daughter), suggests the dif ficulty she is struggling with in her encounter with the tree. God's pro hibition has been reduced to an echo and what that echo is is Eve, "Daughter of God and Man" (IX. 291). The adjective, "Sole," is here telling: it recalls the repeated description of God's interdiction ("sole Command, / Sole pledge of his obedience" [III. 94-95; see also VII. 47 and VIII. 329]), but for Eve?Adam's "Sole Eve," his "Sole partner and sole part of all these joys," his "associate sole," the serpent's "sole wonder"?"Sole Daughter" constitutes an authoritative self-description, one which serves the occasion by establishing an irrational but emotion ally needful relationship between Eve and a command now imagined as a feminine presence, an echo of herself, an echo of an echo. Eve's need, of course, is for exemption from the constraints of a subject relationship; echo "argues" not subjection but answering sympathy; echo returns Eve to her original experience of self-sufficiency. The outlandishness of such "argument"?the "[w]ild work" of "misjoining" (V 112, in) it repre sents?dramatizes the power of the wish Eve is pursuing. Moreover, in the drama of the moment, the disjunctive metaphor Eve seizes on dis plays the way one's own locutions can become vehicles of self-persuasion. Satan is not slow to perceive the erosion of judgment displayed by Eve's metaphor. Sensing where to apply the appropriate verbal pres sure, he now renames the forbidden tree "Mother of Science" (IX. 680). What "Sole Daughter" began, Satan here imitates and amplifies. Like Eve ("Mother of [the] human Race" [IV. 475], "Mother of Mankind" [V. 388] ) the tree becomes maternal and powerfully kindred. By echo ing Eve's established sense of self, Satan's words appeal to her appetite for analogy and echo and encourage the egomorphic impulse which is steadily freeing her from constraints imposed by others. Daughter con siders daughter; mother confronts mother; in the presence of the forbid 22 See Joseph Lowenstein, Responsive Readings: Versions of Echo in Pastoral, Epic, and the fonsonian Masque (New Haven: Yale Univ.

The Poets call her imago vocis... ; the Philosophers call her reflected, repercussive, or reciprocal voice; the Hebrews call her the bat kol, or Daughter of the Voice" (p. 59).</page><page sequence="23">The Temptation of Milton's Eve 387 den tree Eve is looking again into the "wat'ry gleam" (IV. 461) of her primal experience, and seeing herself. What she feels is love. Words, in Milton's continuing emphasis, are the instrument of Eve's seduction, "words replete with guile" which "[i]nto her heart too easy entrance won" (IX. 733-34) and in her ears continue to ring: ... in her ears the sound Yet rung of his persuasive words, impregn'd With Reason, to her seeming, and with Truth. (IX. 736-38) This comment by the narrator directs us to the conflation of the carnal, verbal, and sapiential which characterizes both the seduction of Eve and Milton's monistic sense of being. Penetrated by words, ultimately "di eted" (IX. 803) on knowledge, Eve will come to feel herself the bearer of a new wisdom, a "fertile burden" (IX. 801) shared with the maternal tree. In the fancied matriarchy Eve is establishing with the tree, words them selves, which at first seem a vehicle of the serpent's masculine power, become feminized and fertile, "impregn'd / With Reason." They are a gift, moreover, deriving from the power of the maternal tree which has itself assumed the God-like function of teaching "[t]he Tongue not made for Speech to speak [its] praise" (IX. 749). Here the highest end of God's gift of speech, as the hymns of Eden have displayed it, has been debased to an idolatry Eve now shares. In her mind both she and the kindred tree are undergoing parallel elevations to Godhead, a coupling notable for the way it distinguishes her desires from the more solitary ambitions of Satan. Eve is concerned not so much to displace God as to re-imagine her relationship to deity, to feel in relation to the other not an authority founded in difference but, as first she did, "answering looks / Of sympathy and love" (IV. 464-65). Satan has already encouraged the consideration of Godhead as a designation in which many may partici pate ("A Goddess among Gods" [IX. 547]). Such prompting serves to erode the notion of a solitary, authoritarian deity; its effect is leveling. As with the appellations "Mother of Science" and "Sole Daughter" of God's voice, the other is familiarized, "misjoined" in a network of like ness to the tree and to Eve's self. Neither is Eve's new alliance with the tree a rejection of Adam. Having eaten the fruit, she considers alterations in the politics of her marriage but refuses an inversion of domestic hierarchy and feels separation as (with a sinister irony) the great impossibility: "So dear I love him, that with him all deaths / I could endure, without him live no life" (IX. 832 33). Eve seeks to include, not exclude; her impulses are promiscuous ("universal Dame"); her past a basis for her expanding future:</page><page sequence="24">388 Riggs O Sovran, virtuous, precious of all Trees In Paradise, of operation blest To Sapience, hitherto obscur'd, infam'd, And thy fair Fruit let hang, as to no end Created. (IX. 795-99) Here Eve's sense of her own history, now understood as a record of ne glect, becomes the story of the idolized tree. She has lived (she now feels) in Adam's shadow; so too has the tree been "hitherto obscur'd, infam'd," its growth ignored. Together?fruitful mothers both?they will emerge from this obscurity, participants in a new cult of knowledge. In this instance, Eve's characterization of her past argues a need for change, but the change is not a demand for superiority; her new connec tion with the tree, in which she willingly reassumes an assisting role, also conserves her sense of who she has been: . . . henceforth my early care, Not without Song, each Morning, and due praise Shall tend thee, and the fertile burden ease Of thy full branches. (IX. 799-802) Yet while Eve serves again a "Sovran," a "Best Guide" (IX. 808), the ser vice is now to a power distinctly feminine, an "answering . . . sympathy" to whom she will minister as priestess or, more exactly, as midwife. In her rebellion Eve is not, to be sure, wholly insensitive to the Satanic sense of subjection ("for inferior who is free?" she asks [IX. 825]), nor is she im mune to the appeal of a queenly dignity ("Queen of this Universe" the serpent has called her [IX. 684]), but she will not seek to queen it over Adam. What satisfies her finally is a world of answering relationships in which superiority is not the point. She will serve, but this service ad dresses a God created in her own image and gestures thereby toward a more egalitarian universe in which her own special place will consist in being mirrored or joined by all things in an order of the same. The sense of relation favored in this?analogical not hierarchical?has much to recommend it;23 for Milton, however, it is delusive. Eve's fall into idola try, marking as it does the crisis of his epic, registers emphatically the danger of submission to the subjective world of fancy. As Milton would have it, the idol worshiper does not bow to the objective reality which is God; it is she (in this instance) who attributes divinity and hence mean ing to "stocks and stones" ("On the Late Massacre in Pi?mont"). The idol is the priest's creature, and Eve, by creating a private, maternal 23 See Norford (note 5), who refers us to a sense of narcissism articulated by Herbert Marcuse: "narcissism may become the source of a new relatedness to the world, not one based on work, domination, and repression" (p. 12).</page><page sequence="25">The Temptation of Milton's Eve 389 meaning for God's sign, by making it thus an image of herself, both de fines for Milton the nature of idolatry and heralds an epistemological chaos not distant from Bacon's own famous analysis of idola. The aptness of the Unf?llen "Mind or Fancy ... to rove / Uncheckt" (VIII. 188-89) might seem to argue that in Milton's view the fall did not constitute a significant alteration in the human condition. Such clearly was not the impression he wished to convey, as Adam's final education in the future of his race attests. Yet with respect to fallen man's powers of thought and language much does remain the same, Milton's sense of change being a function of mankind's newly complex relation to God, a new necessity of "knowing good by evil" as Milton has it in Areopagitica. The cognitive and linguistic implications of this necessity may be indi cated by turning to Eve's final words to Adam: Whence thou return'st, and whither went'st, I know; For God is also in sleep, and Dreams advise, Which he hath sent propitious, some great good Presaging, since with sorrow and heart's distress Wearied I fell asleep: but now lead on; In mee is no delay; with thee to go, Is to stay here; without thee here to stay, Is to go hence unwilling; thou to mee Art all things under Heav'n, all places thou, Who for my wilful crime art banisht hence. This further consolation yet secure I carry hence; though all by mee is lost, Such favor I unworthy am voutsaf't, By mee the Promis'd Seed shall all restore. (XII. 610-23) Adam is "[w]ell pleased" by Eve's tribute but "answer [s]" not (VII. 625). In the poem's record of their relationship, she has the last word, and it is notable as yet again a repetition. Eve here recasts her central prelap sarian tribute to Adam, the lovely, self-echoing serenade out of which Satan confects the dream which in turn resounds in the temptation. "With thee," her song went, paradise is "sweet;" "without thee" it is not. So here "with thee to go, / Is to stay here; without thee here to stay / Is to go hence unwillingly." The structure and the statement are much the same, but the egomorphic fancy which in the serenade characterized paradise and seemed to hedge the gesture of attributing "all" to Adam is gone. Now Adam is "all things under Heav'n, all places." Gone too is the repetitive expansiveness of the serenade, replaced by a laconic com plexity in which paradise, no longer the "sweet" place secured by Adam's presence, has become a difficult symbol: in one sense, a prison wherein the pain of confinement is paradoxically defined by expulsion and exile;</page><page sequence="26">390 Riggs in a reversed sense, a person (Adam) with whom expulsion and exile become, paradoxically, a home ("with thee to go / Is to stay here"). These paradoxes respond to an altered human situation. While Mil ton's pre-lapsarian world includes significant semiological complexity (the "inviting" attractions of the forbidden tree, the serpent, "matters hid"), it has been, relative to the life to come, a place wherein access to knowledge and understanding was promoted in direct ways: revelation frequent and definitive; nature, with the few notable exceptions, declar ing its meanings openly. The new complexity of Eve's "paradise" now responds to a way of meaning in which both things and words have lost an original directness as signs, and her last words?"By me the Promis'd Seed shall all restore"?refer us to the divine pronouncement which centers Milton's sense of new obscurity. The pronouncement is God's curse of the serpent, the protevangelium (Gen. 3:14-15), which announces at the threshold of fallen experience the final victory of Christ: Because thou hast done this, thou art accurst Above all Cattle, each Beast of the Field; Upon thy Belly groveling thou shalt go, And dust shalt eat all the days of thy Life. Between Thee and the Woman I will put Enmity, and between thine and her Seed; Her Seed shall bruise thy head, thou bruise his heel. (X. 175-81) Milton introduces this vexing quotation from scripture with an uneasy announcement ("more to know / Concern'd not Man (since he no fur ther knew)" [X. 169-70]) of its "mysterious terms, judg'd as then best" (X. 173) and follows it with an explanation to the reader of its typological mystery. This mystery grounds the final, fallen books of the poem: mis construed by Satan, the protevangelium occasions Milton's extravagant de piction of the devils' degradation in Hell (X. 460-590); its typological explanation is the burden of Michael's lengthy prospect of the world to come; and its unsteady comprehension marks our parents' progress to ward redemption.24 Adam's name-calling (with which we began) is itself a misreading of the protevangelium. Eve is not a "Serpent," not, as Adam asserts, "with him leagu'd" (X. 868) but, in the words of God's curse, aligned in " [e]nmity" against the beast: "Her Seed shall bruise thy head, thou bruise his heel." As a sign, the Serpent has come to bridge, para doxically, the memory of evil and the promise of grace. Soon after Adam's domestic anathema, as the clouds of mutual re 24See Leonard's tracing of this progress, pp. 213-32.</page><page sequence="27">The Temptation of Mutons Eve 391 crimination begin to lift, Eve recalls the "enmity / Against a Foe by doom express assign'd us, / That cruel Serpent" (X. 925-27), and it is this rec ollection that points the way for Adam who soon calls to mind with heed Part of our Sentence, that thy Seed shall bruise The Serpent's head; piteous amends, unless Be meant, whom I conjecture, our grand Foe. (X.1030-33) Adam here approaches a comprehension of the "mysterious terms" of the protevangelium by means of a "conjecture" altogether remarkable for its swift, though partial, penetration of the mystery it will take Michael the final two books of the poem to unfold?an unfolding which repeat edly asserts paradox as the condition of life redeemed by God's Grace: good out of evil, weakness as strength, darkness as light, death as life. Such Christian paradoxes produce (as with the Cross) the kind of seman tic double-loading Eve produces in her new idea of "paradise" as both a place of displacement (without thee) and a displacement as blessed place (with thee). Surprisingly, the sophistication of Eve's symbolism, the faith required to embrace its paradoxes, and her ready access to a lan guage answerable to her new condition follow not from an education such as Adam receives from Michael but from a dream in which she dis covers (her past experience of dreams notwithstanding) "God is also," and it is a measure of Eve's status as a Miltonic protagonist that her way to redemptive understanding is here primarily inward. One might find in this a "male" judgment of her intellectual capacities, but one must also acknowledge that the guidance of the spirit within is the prominent emphasis of Milton's final poems wherein the Son's resources are aggres sively inward and Samson's climactic "rousing motions"?a "presage in the mind" discontinuous with his rational refusal to play before the Phi listines?portend "some great act" (X. 1382-89; cf. Eve's "propitious" dream "some great good / Presaging" [XII. 612-13]).25 This emphasis on the Spirit within extends, of course, to the poet of Paradise Lost for whom, in Eve's words to Adam, "God is also in sleep, and Dreams advise" (XII. 611), and it is finally Milton, from his vantage in 25Feminist criticism emphasizes an antagonism between "English literature's paradig matic patriarch" (Nyquist, p. 101) and his female character. I am, of course, attempting to qualify this emphasis, as does James Grantham Turner in his recent and illuminating ac count of sexual difference in the story of paradise: One Flesh: Paradisal Marriage and Sexual Relations in the Age of Milton (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1987). While Turner foregrounds the "masculinist" harshness of Milton's divorce tracts, he also maintains that "the seeds of a redemptive and inspirational revaluation of the 'female' may be found throughout his poetry" (p. 186), particularly in Paradise Lost.</page><page sequence="28">392 Riggs the seventeenth century, who responds to the paradoxical complexity of Eve's last words. His text also is the protevangelium and his trope would seem to ratify the divine power of dream-work: So spake our Mother Eve, and Adam heard Well pleas'd, but answer'd not; for now too nigh Th' Arch-Angel stood, and from the other Hill To thir fixt Station, all in bright array The Cherubim descended, on the ground Gliding meteorous, as Ev'ning Mist Ris'n from a River o'er the marish glides, And gathers ground fast at the Laborer's heel Homeward returning. (XII. 624-32) As the image of the Serpent emerges here, fantastically, from the de scription of the " [g]liding" Cherubim, we return to the essential mystery of man's redemption, and the amplitude of its paradoxical resonance is allowed to sound. Milton's tableau joins: it returns us to the fall (and to Satan entering paradise "involv'd in rising Mist" [IX. 75; see IX. 180]); it depicts the present terror of expulsion; and it opens the vista of human ity's future wherein man (the "[l]aborer" who must eat bread in the sweat of his face [X. 205]) becomes the Promised Seed, destined, as the Serpent "gathers ground fast at the . . . [announced] heel" of the prot evangelium, to recover paradise ("Homeward returning"). What began with the mystery of God's curse becomes for Milton an opportunity to embrace the imaginative capacities so prominent in Eve's mental pro file as away of comprehending God's ways. Surely here it is not too much to say a linguistic fall is apparent in the indirections and paradoxes of Milton's trope but proves, also, fortunate.</page></plain_text>
