That's probably about where anthropomorphism begins - our habit of attributing human personality to animals, gods and things. It carries on immediately with re-runs of Mr. Ed, the talking horse, and soon follows more evidence for the young human child that other creatures on the planet don't dwell in a parallel world of their own just as valid as ours but secretly crave admission to our club. Toad of Toad Hall, Animal Magic, Rin-Tin-Tin, Lassie. Pinky &amp; Perky, Bill &amp; Ben The Flowerpot men (flowerpots even), Babe, The Junglebook, in fact almost the entire output of the Disney Studios. Once we set out to demonstrate that not only is everything on the planet for our use and benefit but that we are actually a role model for creation, we are unstoppable. But recently there's been a whole new spin on it. Consultants in the US, the kind of management gurus who charge companies handsomely for glossily presented seminars of platitudes or who reel out large-type books of truisms, have more and more been using metaphors involving our fellow creatures to point the way for big business. The boiling frog had been well known - the Charles Handy one about how if you put a frog in a pan of water and gradually heat it the frog will not notice and hop it but will be boiled to death - the lesson for corporations being that detrimental change can go unobserved until it's too late. Another guru cites how a grasshopper contained in a lidded jar won't jump even when the lid is taken off. That's apparently a lesson for recently privatised companies facing new competition. Then there's the Elephant one, about how young elephants are tethered to stakes which continue to restrain the grown elephant even though they have developed the strength to break free - showing how companies are bound by earlier conditioned restraints. There's the monkeys left in a room with bananas on the top of a pole. Each time they try to remove the bananas from the pole they're sprayed with cold water and are so deterred that when one monkey is replaced by a new one the others teach it not to climb the pole. This demonstrates how precedents enacted into corporate processes can outlive the context that creates them. So not content with attributing human personalities to the animals around us we are now extrapolating from their responses to our restraints to our own failings in the face of self-imposed limitations. Animals can't win. But if they can laugh, they must be laughing at us. P.S. None were harmed in the writing of this column. 8 CIRCA</page></plain_text>
