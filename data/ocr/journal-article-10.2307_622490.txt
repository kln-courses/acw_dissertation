<plain_text><page sequence="1">404 A response to Gleeson and Imrie Reginald G Golledge Department of Geography, University of California, Santa Barbara, CA 93106-4060, USA manuscript received 13 July 1995 In 1972, David Harvey reacted to a critical review of his book Explanation in geography (1972) by commenting that the reviewer had an advantage over him because the reviewer had read the book, whereas he had only written it. I must say I feel sympathetic to this point of view because I found it hard at times to believe that Imrie and Gleeson read the same paper that I wrote. Their interpret- ations of parts of my writing leaves me mystified at how they can infer meanings so different from those that I believed I had expressed. Imrie (1996, 398) freely admits that he is bent on 'reconstructing some of Golledge's arguments'. Unfortunately, many of his 'reconstructions' are pure misrepresen- tation, with little relation to the original statements or their meanings. As a case in point, consider the following statements: Thus Golledge refers to people with disabilities as a 'subgroup' (sub to what?), that people with mental impairments are 'retarded', a term which certainly carries stigma, while suggesting that disability also comprises individuals with inferior mental abilities, yet the question is 'inferior to whom and in what measurable, or other, senses?' (p. 399) This particular reconstruction is filled with mis- representation, peevishness ('sub to what?' not subgroups of what as stated in my paper) and false generalization. There are, of course, many people who, although mentally impaired, are not retarded. I used the academically and professionally correct term 'retarded' and gave a table summarizing different levels of retardation so as not to confuse (as Imrie does) the broader group of mentally impaired (which includes those with partial brain damage from accidental causes) with those who have specific developmental difficulties that qualify them as retarded. In the latest United States figures, for example, there are about 2.2 million people with 'mental impairments', of whom only 1.2 million are recognized as mentally retarded and 950 000 defined as having traumatic brain injury and associated learning difficulties. Both groups require special and separate attention to their prob- lems. To unite them for the convenience of political correctness makes no sense. It appears that Imrie is not conscious of this difference, nor of the need to look at their problems from quite different view- points. Incidentally, to avoid even further con- fusion on Imrie's part, let me elaborate that there are (again in the United States) 1-3 million other people who are defined as being 'mentally ill', some of whom suffer impairments from brain tumours or from biochemical imbalances. They constitute another distinct population subgroup with their own problems and needs. Should we, in the interest of not using terms that 'carry stigma' (ibid., p. 399), throw this group into the same politi- cally correct pot as the others, ignoring the differ- ent needs but being happy that we have named them 'correctly'? In yet another strange interpret- ation of my comments, Imrie (p. 400) accuses me of arguing that people with disabilities are 'somehow inferior', apparently confusing a quotation from Hahn (1988) with my writings. Nowhere is this statement made in my paper. Indeed, since I am disabled, I would hardly characterize myself so. This type of irresponsible, peevishly fabricated comment should be unwelcome in a professional exchange. But, when Imrie (p. 398) complains that my 'article is suffused with the assumptions, values and attitudes of ableism' (whatever that means), I feel that I must object. From his lofty position of ableism, Imrie (whom I believe is very able) accuses me of denigrating the very group to which I belong and try to represent! To counteract this unusual reconstruction, I would point out that since the work of Ward Edwards and Amos Tversky (1967), showing that in general people were usually poor at identifying and correctly estimating subjective probabilities of Trans Inst Br Geogr NS 21 404-411 1996 ISSN 0020-2754 ? Royal Geographical Society (with the Institute of British Geographers) 1996</page><page sequence="2">A geography for disabled people? 405 daily events, and three decades of hazard- perception research has shown that people gener- ally neither understand nor are aware of things such as event intensity, episodic frequency and likelihood of future occurrence, etc. and since Ben Kuipers (1977) distinguished between 'common sense' and 'expert' knowledge and Simon and Newell (1971) received international applause for their work identifying the protocols of experts and combining them into computerized rule-based expert systems, there has been substantial evidence that the gap between expert and common-sense understanding is quite large. My recent work (Golledge et al. 1995) has shown that geographers perform at a superior level to non-geographers on a variety of spatial tasks. Previous work by Stern (1983) and others has shown similar results. These findings are not just the result of interested wishful thinking but derive from carefully designed and evaluated tasks. I am quite prepared to defend the position, therefore, that experts know more of their speciality than those who have only a general knowledge of it, whether they be abled or disabled. As experts in understanding spatial interactions, distributions and other large- and small-scale geo- graphic phenomena, geographers are more knowl- edgeable about these things than are others and, by inference, those others are inferior in this domain to geographers. In addition to mistaking my attitudes and opinions, Imrie also has difficulty imagining how some of the research on which I report (or recom- mend) could be undertaken - a position I have witnessed frequently with people inexperienced at defining problems in such a way that they can be solved and at designing experiments or scenarios to address the problem. For example, Imrie (p. 399) asks 'how do we know (how can we know) that visually impaired people inhabit "impoverished" environments?' As a start to some enlightening background reading on this question, I suggest beginning with Casey's (1978) seminal paper on cognitive maps of the blind, then progress to more recent papers by the blind psychologist Foulke (1982), or to Rieser et al. (1980, 1982, 1992), Tellevik (1992), Byrne and Salter (1983), Herman et al. (1983) and, perhaps, Loomis et al. (1993) who, using imaginative scenarios, define and compare cogni- tive maps and memory representations of congeni- tally and adventitiously blinded people with those who are sighted. And here I refer to cognitive maps as defined in the internal representation mode, not the preference surface 'mental maps' of the type generally discarded decades ago. These studies should help him answer his own question. Many other quizzical statements by Imrie can be handled in the same way - by reading relevant literature and or designing simple tasks to provide empirical evidence of such differences. And this can be done qualitatively (e.g. by interrogating people), quantitatively (by measuring performance) or by observing spatial behaviour! The papers by Gleeson (1996) and Imrie share some features while being quite different in others. Both profess an idealist view, pressing for rather vague and futuristic socio-political 'empowering' solutions to the problems faced daily by disabled people. My paper, which they criticize profusely for being practical and somewhat orientated towards defusing and solving these everyday spatial problems, attempted to establish that there is a feasible interest area for geographers in dealing with disability and asked readers to try to step into the minds of various disabled groups and experi- ence through their eyes, or hands, or ears to increase awareness of the myriad discriminatory, disenfranchising, debilitating and disadvantaging situations embedded in our everyday world which provide major barriers for different disabled groups. I further suggested some topics where geographic research skills and basic knowledge could be of immediate assistance. As a practical matter, I focused considerable attention on spatial problems in the physical environment rather than on issues of empowerment or representation - socio-political questions that are not always ob- viously geographic. My emphasis is on the im- mediate, real and addressable problems that, if solved, would increase the quality of life for dis- abled people; theirs is intellectual, idealist and somewhat ethereal. They are certainly not im- mediate and practical. I do not deny that their approach may, in the long run, be valuable. But if 'all roads lead to Rome' and if either approach serves to increase the well-being of disabled people, then both approaches are worth pursuing. There is no sense in their arguing to ignore my approach. There is certainly room for many differ- ent points of view in the study of problems facing disabled people, so let's encourage all of them, not discourage them. The points of view adopted by Gleeson and Imrie appear to be strongly based on those recently put forth by Oliver (1990, 1991, 1992) and Abberley</page><page sequence="3">406 Reginald G Golledge (1987, 1991a and b, 1993), and are firmly fixed in the long-term politics that is a critical part of materialist socio-political theory. I adopted and endorsed concepts and definitions relevant to disability as it occurs in everyday geographical situations and as defined and used by international organizations, such as the World Health Organiz- ation (WHO) and the World Blind Union, not the eclectic and value-laden definitions offered by two emerging social theorists. The definitions I chose frankly appealed to me much more than did others I investigated (e.g. Nagy 1991) that also attempted to argue that my own disability was the product of 'socially created limitations' (Gleeson, p. 390). Per- haps, though, I could be tempted to modify my position if only the 'socio-political limitations' referred to so frequently by both Gleeson and Imrie as part of their interpretations of disability were defined as clearly and unambiguously as the functional definitions of the WHO! Both papers resort at times to the use of value- laden undefined terms, such as 'spatial scientism' and 'positivistic behaviouralism', which I presume are designed to create a sympathy for their pos- ition among some readers. I thought that Helen Couclelis and I had shown very clearly that posi- tivism and behaviouralism were incompatible terms (Couclelis and Golledge 1983)! Unfortu- nately, our arguments seem to remain unread. But the bogeyperson of 'positivistic behaviouralism' should be laid to rest. Really, all the stuffing is out of this strawperson! And, while we speak of terms and concepts that raise hackles, why is it so hard for these authors to use the term 'behaviour'? What, might I ask Gleeson, are the 'practices which humans pursue in meeting their basic needs for food, shelter, affective ties, movement and the like' (p. 390) if not behaviours? And are not most of them spatial behaviours? Why not call them so and investigate them using well-established spatial behavioural concepts and theories? I fear Gleeson (p. 391) romanticizes feudal Europe when he comments on the 'non-disabling character of feudal society'. In traditional histories of the social, legal and moral conditions of feudal Europe there is frequent mention of the wide- spread use of torture and impairment as ways to disable 'wrongdoers'. Physically impairing to dis- able a person and alter their status in their every- day environment was a barbarous and uncivilized practice. Were not blinding, amputation, castration, deformation and even outlawing activities designed to reduce the potential for people to carry out everyday activities in the same way that they had done before being punished? Does your research show different treatment given to those blinded naturally as opposed to those blinded as a punishment? Can one of these groups perform activities better than the other? Did society let them? I find it a little inconsistent that Gleeson (p. 391) argues further 'there is no necessary correspond- ence between impairment and disability'. My posi- tion, like the WHO and many others, is that there is necessity in such a tie. I would like to see examples of such a non-correspondence, if they exist, for none are given either by Gleeson or Imrie. Also I do not see the relevance in yet another of Gleeson's (p. 391), claims that materialism recognizes that different societies may pro- duce environments which liberate the capacities of impaired people whilst not aggravating their limitations. I might ask which societies do not do that? It would be interesting to see some hard evidence docu- menting the claim. There is plenty of evidence in societies such as the USA, Canada, England, Sweden, Australia and Denmark, among many others, that significant legislation has been passed to 'liberate the capacities' of disabled people. These include many versions of the Barrier-Free Environ- ment and Equal Accessibility Acts, as well as different versions of the more recent Americans with Disabilities Act. Evaluating all this legislation in different cultural contexts could perhaps form a very interesting future paper. I dispute Gleeson's (p. 389) contention that including 'the poor' and 'the disabled' under the term 'disadvantaged' is 'not satisfactory'! Why not? Both groups are disadvantaged: for example, both groups have limited access to personal unas- sisted travel; both groups have limited access to economic and social resources; both groups have limited political power; both groups have limited activity spaces; and the list goes on and on. Perhaps the nature of Gleeson's claim could be spelled out more thoroughly in an interesting cross-cultural paper. The concept of 'social normality' has not been 'uniformly attacked' by disabled people as Gleeson remarks, unless he means it has been uniformly attacked by Oliver and Abberley! I would suggest reading an article by Corn and Sacks (1994) which</page><page sequence="4">A geography for disabled people? 407 recounts many stories of people who are disabled by vision impairment or blindness, who evince considerable frustration, despair and depression because their disability prevents them from being 'socially normal'. In one instance, a teenager reported on how he had to lie to a date by saying that his car was 'being repaired' because to take her out he had to use public transport instead of the socially accepted (in the United States) mode of independent car travel! The article has many simi- lar anecdotes. While there are undoubtedly some groups, their spokespersons and some writers who adopt the position reported by Gleeson, my reading of both academic and popular literature indicates these are in the minority. Gleeson (p. 389) later asked the question, 'what do [I] have to say about disability as a social geographic phenomenon?' Let me quote from my original article: The financial, personal and societal expenditures required to deal with these populations alone should justify an interest in the geographical aspects of dis- ability. When we add concerns for quality of life, community impact, and individual and group welfare and well-being the rationale for becoming interested in disabled populations increases markedly. (Golledge 1993, 64) I argue further that 'geographers should add significantly to these efforts and help isolate and resolve the peculiar sets of spatial problems not already addressed by others' (ibid.). I then go on to say that 'I also acknowledge the existence of sub- stantial social and political problems that need to be addressed to help solve problems of the dis- abled, but leave their elaboration to others' (ibid.). This statement is about as clear as I could make it. However, rather than accept the challenge to write constructively about the nature of, and solution to, these myriad social and political problems, Gleeson and (particularly) Imrie disregard my clearly stated position and harangue me for not dealing with those same societal and political ques- tions! What is the point of this nihilism? Criticism for the sake of being critical is as unproductive as it is irrelevant. And, apart from my comment that I was not going to deal with that concern, I believe I said that disability deserves attention by all fields of geography. I hoped that people in these different fields would access their individual and cumu- lative knowledge and points of view to deal with problems of disability. I said little about the socio- political domain of disabled people because that is not an area in which I specialize. The challenge was to others who are stimulated by reading my paper to pursue such problems from these points of view. This can be done constructively without erecting useless straw men as the hook on which to hang negative comments. At the beginning of my article I asked readers to imagine themselves in the worlds of the disabled. I wanted to shock them out of their enabled security - to make them realize that, as different impair- ments occur, they impact one's position in the world differently. Only by recognizing that such differences occur can one appreciate barriers - whether they be physical, environmental, social, cultural, ethical, legal, moral or whatever. There is an old native North American saying that one should not unduly criticize others until one has 'walked a mile in their moccasins'. In the first part of my paper I encouraged the enabled to walk a mile in the moccasins of the disabled, for only then would they get an idea of the different realities in which various disabled people must operate. As an anecdotal example of this, I remember the time a sighted colleague and I were walking across an area of campus that was cracked, broken and rutted. My cane constantly caught in these impedi- ments, warning me that an obstacle existed. Quite frequently I impaled myself on the cane as it caught unexpectedly in a rut or crack. In an exas- perated tone, my sighted colleague said, 'Why don't you just lift the cane over the obstacles like this?' and proceeded to grab the cane, extend it in the direction of travel and carefully lift it over every crack and bump in the concrete! Obviously, the thought that the cane was designed to find the cracks and the bumps and to act in the same way as my colleague's eyes (i.e. giving warning of when to lift one's foot so as not to stumble) never occurred to that person. I have likewise found that it is extremely difficult for people who have never been in a wheelchair fully to appreciate the non- existence of ramps, the lack of support bars in toilets or even the lack of curb cuts. It is quite amazing how people's views of disabling con- ditions in both social and physical environments change once they have to adopt the burden of the disability. In a recent commentary, Butler (1994) urged working closely with disabled people, not just using them as subjects. I would go a step further: before writing about disabling conditions, people should (if they are not disabled) travel in the moccasins of a disabled person for a week or</page><page sequence="5">408 Reginald G Golledge so before they intellectualize on the nature of disability, or try to decide what things are the most urgent and the most important to pursue in order to offset disabling conditions. While both Gleeson and Imrie criticize my refer- ence to the term 'normal' (which is part of the WHO definitions originally adopted), their angry objections smack more of a concern for political correctness than for appropriate and usual use of the term. The concept of 'normal' is embedded in the language of medicine, psychiatry, psychology, measurement, sociology, political science and economics, just as it is in geography, philosophy, ethics and other disciplines. Each area has its own definition - such as identifying performance levels on any of a wide variety of adaptive achievement, intelligence, aptitude, behaviour and functioning tests - that can be used to describe what is consid- ered normal and what is not (e.g. wide range achievement test (WRAT)). I am sure that every academic whose education was paid for by schol- arship or fellowship funds is aware of the signifi- cance of having such a base defined! And yet perhaps they both protest too much, for both Imrie and Gleeson use the same concept embedded in their own writing! Why must it be hidden? Since I prefer academic correctness to political correctness, prior to publishing my paper I carefully checked the academic literature of several disciplines and asked active well-known researchers in fields such as special education and social work if terms such as 'mentally retarded' should be replaced with a less 'sensitive' or more politically correct term? Both human and literature sources indicated that it is quite appropriate to use terms like 'retarded' in an academic context, for they are carefully and contextually defined. They also said that in normal conversation or in the popular press, the terms is often replaced by vague and less accurate terms when political correctness is deemed to be of more value. I strongly dispute the statement that sociological theory is the source of dominant theorizing of disability, as claimed by Imrie. Sociology is a late- comer to this area, having been preceded by psy- chiatry, psychology, education, law, philosophy, medicine, religion and ethics. In my case, I pre- ferred to access the long-established literature, while my critics have chosen to follow more recent theoretical offerings. For more than two decades, my work in quali- tative research methods has addressed the specific question of experimenter intervention into the research process. While this intervention may be carefully controlled in some physical, chemical and biological experiments, traditionally it has not been controlled as much in the social and behavioural sciences. Recognition of this has spawned a variety of approaches including phenomenology, trans- actionalism, constructivism and anthropomorphic methods that are designed to minimize this interventionalist problem. In addition to reading Oliver's (1992) declaration on this point, I would urge Imrie to consult a selection of papers from the Sage Publication Series in Qualitative Analysis. In particular, the opening statement by the editor of the Sage series directly addresses this question. That this non-interventionist procedure has achieved viable and reliable research results may be verified in papers published in the Journal of Environmental Psychology, Environment and Behavior and the Children's Environment Quarterly, among many other journals to which geographers regu- larly contribute. I would strongly take issue with Imrie's (p. 472) suggestion that the position taken in my paper 'may potentially exclude the voices and opinions of people with disabilities themselves'. Nonsense! I am not about to cut myself or other disabled persons out of the loop of voicing opinions and making their views known. All I can say here is that if Imrie had been aware of my research with disabled people over the past twenty years (some of which was referenced in my bibliography), he may have realized that my usual practice when conducting such research involves determining and presenting for public consumption the beliefs, opinions and frustrations as well as the behaviours and performances of members of the different disabled groups with whom I have worked. And I certainly encourage others to do the same. Again it is somewhat of a mystery to me how such a jaundiced opinion can be inferred from my paper, my other writings or references quoted in my text. In talking about the different realities of disabled groups, Imrie (p. 401) says, 'yet the paper does not conceptualize or specify what this arena com- prises'. I was under the distinct impression that the first half of my paper addressed this exact ques- tion. Oh well, back to the drawing board. Yet another question he asked was 'how much map- ping and representational research is required to understand the "world full of unique barriers"?'</page><page sequence="6">A geography for disabled people? 409 (p. 401). If I knew the answer to this, why would I raise the question? In a recent chapter of a book dedicated to John Borchert (Golledge 1992), I tried to suggest ways to investigate such problems and referred to that paper in the Transactions article rather than repeat those suggestions or, as Imrie does, refer to a forthcoming publication wherein such an agenda lies. Is this any more satisfactory than referencing a past (existing) publication as a source for answers? Knowing how much research has to be done on a problem before it is solved is well beyond my capabilities. Despite my general feeling that the number of questions Imrie raises are simply a result of his failure to think clearly about the problems at hand, I am glad that he does raise so many. It means my paper has achieved its aims; it has made him think about disability and what can be done in the way of using geographic (not sociological) expertise to help alleviate the problems, difficulties, disadvan- tages and disenfranchisements of disabled people, which was my goal. But I must also admit that I had hoped that my paper would generate con- structive rather than destructive reaction. While Gleeson has included both a critical review and a possible direction for complementary research (i.e. implications of the commodity labour market), Imrie's commentary is more a form of negative criticism, in which there are no specific suggestions for a viable ongoing research programme except for the vague one of urging people to adopt a socio-political approach to whatever they do. There are no problems identified, no hypotheses advanced, no processes suggested, no ideas that have not already been offered by others. Perhaps an elaboration of exactly how the structures such as the commodity labour market and the capitalist land economy contribute to disability would be a good start - if there is evidence that non-capitalist social, political and economic systems do not have the same disabling effects. There are many more points in both papers with which I have fundamental disagreements. I am criticized for not providing more examples of 'relevant' problems (meaning socio-political prob- lems) but the critics fail to offer any alternatives except urging readers properly to acknowledge the 'social situatedness' (Imrie, p. 401) of disabled people. In turn, may I suggest defining how this can be done to help solve the geographic problems of disabled people? Again and again questions are asked about 'how to do things', to which I say simply that practice in defining problems, design- ing revealing tasks and reading relevant literature can, as every well-trained graduate knows, usually provide evidence or clues about how such prob- lems might be solved. But if Imrie (p. 401) is 'left wondering' about how to do these things, then I have achieved at best only a partial success. Per- haps there is a need for a good review paper that emphasizes innovative research practices or experimental designs that have been developed to study different disabled groups in their natural everyday settings. Surely it must be obvious in a paper like mine, which is designed to get research- ers interested in a given area, that there are many problems waiting to be solved! And, of course, I have no solutions to those myriad problems. There is some evidence that Imrie is hoist on his own nihilist petard. He argues that the author is more concerned with asserting the iden- tity of the geographer than developing the possibilities for enabling disabled people to overcome the social oppression of ableism (p. 398). I suggest Imrie is so concerned with pushing his socio-political materialist concerns that he has ignored the geographical base of his own argu- ments and that I wrote the paper for the geography profession and published it in a geography journal. My mission was to encourage geographers to inves- tigate disability, not to appeal to other disciplines that were already involved in attacking relevant problems. Perhaps I can ask one final question of both Gleeson and Imrie: what will disabled people do after they become empowered and have ensured that the 'social oppression of ableism' is univer- sally recognized? Introduce more legislation to remove environmental barriers? Pass a civil rights act for disabled people? Undertake massive behav- iour modifications to change attitudes of the abled towards the disabled? Isn't that what the American Standards Act (1961), the United Kingdom's Access to Buildings for Disabled People Act (1967) and the Americans with Disability Act (1990) have tried to do? If the goal is a lot more than is intended in these examples, why not explain in precise terms what the long-term goals are? Perhaps then the relevance of the suggestions made by each of us will become obvious to all. Much of the difference between the viewpoints set out in my paper, as opposed to Imrie's and Gleeson's, can possibly be traced to a difference in</page><page sequence="7">410 Reginald G Golledge national attitudes towards disability. Beginning with the American Standards Act and elaborated in the recent Americans with Disability Act, the United States' attitude can be described as en- abling, fostering independence, encouraging self- reliance, encouraging equal opportunity and being relatively free of doctrine: in all, a self-help ethic. This contrasts to the social-welfare ethic underly- ing significant United Kingdom legislation and practice which emphasizes compensation, pro- vision of welfare services, mutual supportiveness and discriminatory ('special') treatment. In this approach, the provision of facilities and assistance for disabled people is seen as part of the general social fabric. Such differences beg for more detailed research and analysis to determine how much and in what way the social fabric of the differ- ent countries colours attitudes towards, and approaches to, addressing problems of disability. I also believe that Imrie and I associate with entirely different groups of disabled people. Per- haps there is another cultural difference that needs investigating: a difference between attitudes towards, and attitudes of, disabled people in the USA and the UK. His stereotyped view of disabled people is that they are socialized into particular ways of being, of accept- ing their 'inferiority' by society and behaving in ways which conform to the expectations and stereotypes which have been handed down. (p. 399). And I am criticized for not 'acknowledging' this distressful view. To this, I simply respond that the majority of disabled people with whom I have interacted in the US are not the docile recipients of a welfare-state attitude but are proud of their levels of independence, keep trying to improve their abilities (even among the aged disabled) and reject any attempt to classify them as inferior in any way. There are many wheelchair-bound people who enter marathons; there are blind skiers - downhill and cross-country; there are special Olympics for various developmentally disabled people. Such people are not socially pigeonholed into 'inferior' groups. So why should I accept an untenable premise? Most of my reactions to comments made by both Gleeson and Imrie reflect different positions on, first, definition of basic terms; secondly, my practi- cal spatial approach versus their idealist social/ political approaches; thirdly, their materialist versus my pragmatic and somewhat analytic viewpoints; and, finally, our different evaluations of the relative significance of socio-political versus geographic and environmental solutions to prob- lems of disability. Extensive debate on which approaches 'should' be adopted is a waste of space and effort. I have no intention of dedicating my research activity to pursuing long-term and fuzzy socio-political thinking about imagined or real problems and it seems my materialist critics are not enamoured with my immediate and prac- tical problem-solving approach. Perhaps we should just celebrate the difference and hope both approaches help in solving the spatial (not merely the social or the political) problems of disabled persons.
