<plain_text><page sequence="1">Greece &amp; Rome, Vol. xxxix, No. 1, April 1992 SUBJECT REVIEWS (* denotes that a book is specially recommended for school libraries; ** that it is suitable for advanced students only; B that a bibliography is included.) Greek Literature One good reason why I was happy to take on this column as reviewer was the thought that now at last I would be obliged to keep up to date with new books: no longer would they pile high, guiltily unread, on a shelf of the imagination. A second was that no doubt I would learn a lot from books that otherwise I might not have chosen to read and would thus keep abreast of a wider field. But the book in this half-year's batch from which I gained most, and with most pleasure, was one that I would in any event have chosen to read, and read early: David Wiles's B** The Masks of Menander: Sign and Meaning in Greek and Roman Performance.' I approached this book with vivid memories of Wiles's excellent article 'Reading Greek Performance' (G&amp;R 34 [1987], 136-51), in which he gives a searching critique of Simon Goldhill's Reading Greek Tragedy and concludes by urging the necessary combination of both structuralist (e.g. Goldhill) and stagecraft (e.g. Taplin) approaches to drama. In his new book he now brings just such a combined approach to an analysis of New Comedy, and with exciting and illuminating results. His aim is 'to lay bare the performance code which Menander and his audience shared, and to a significant extent we do not share' (p. 150), and this he does by a rigorous analysis of Menander's complex system of masks which, when integrated with costume and movement, language and voice, forms the set of theatrical conventions used to produce meaning. 'The dominant sign system is the mask' (p. 17), and, far from being a limitation or a barrier to understanding, the mask on the contrary enhances understanding: 'Without the masks, Menander's text may be complete, but part of his play will be missing' (p. 98). (For some quick idea of how illuminating his researches can be, look at his analysis on pp. 83-85 of the masks on the Pompeian mosaic of Eros riding a tiger, and at his discussion of the Dyskolos on pp. 184-5 which shows how the initial 'reading' of a mask achieves further meaning in the context of the stage action.) Wiles also contrasts Greek New Comedy with other traditions of masked performance, both eastern and western, and also with the Roman theatre of Plautus and Terence, and isolates and explores their differences. Throughout the book he uses contemporary literary theory to help his analyses; but those who tend to steer clear of what in his earlier article he calls 'cerebral theorizing' need have no fears: here, blessedly, there is no mystification or obscurity (inten- tional or unintentional), but instead a clarity of exposition that leads to genuine enlighten- ment. I am sure that many readers, like myself, will at the end of the book look at drama in a quite new light. So, to sum up: this book, with its brilliantly successful linking of stagecraft analysis with contemporary critical theory (I am reminded of Forster's 'Only connect'), is an absolute must not only for classicists but for anyone interested in any kind of drama. I wish I could be as warmly enthusiastic about Simon Goldhill's new book, B** The Poet's Voice.- Essays on Poetics and Greek Literature.2 Goldhill's aim is 'to investigate how poetry and the figure of the poet are represented, discussed, contested within the poetry of ancient Greece', and to do this he focuses first on man as user of language in the Odyssey, then in</page><page sequence="2">SUBJECT REVIEWS 81 turn on kleos in Homer and the lyric poets, particularly Pindar, parody and the carnivalesque in Aristophanes, devices and desire in Theocritus, and the sense of the past in Apollonius, making liberal use throughout of contemporary literary theory. Here there is cerebral theorizing aplenty, since 'the search for the poet's voice entails the negotiation of the interrelated problematics of representation, self-reflexivity and intertextuality ...' (p. 222). The book is a long and (as might be guessed) by no means an easy read, and it boasts an awesome bibliography of getting on 1000 items, which is still, apparently, by no means exhaustive. But much reading does not make a good book (as James Diggle remarks in another context, AJP 110 [1989], 357), and here, sadly, the end result is far from being as 'richly rewarded and revealing' as the dustjacket promises. Certainly some stimulating points are made on the way: I liked the section in the Aristophanes chapter on parody; and perhaps Goldhill is (significantly) at his best with the self-conscious, self-reflexive genre of Hellenistic poetry. But too often he is unpersuasive, as with - to give just one example - his analysis of the Theognis poem on pp. 109-15 (clever, maybe, but it does not ring true). Or even simply wrong(headed), as with the arguments that lead up to his conclusion on p. 107 that 'In all its senses, the kleos of the Odyssey sets itself against the kleos of the Iliad'. (E.g. Goldhill claims that, in view of Agamemnon's words at Od. 24.93-97, the value, the kleos, of his military exploits must be lost because of his murder on coming home. But Goldhill has already stated (p. 94) that 'kleos is inherently linked to the promotion and preservation of the name in the language of others'. In this Homeric passage we are listening to Agamemnon's own words of grief, while in the mouths of others he is still the great Agamemnon. His kleos, therefore, remains intact.) And all too often I have traced an analyti- cal discussion through to its end and have been left feeling 'So what? Where does that get us?'. It is not that I am against contemporary literary theory as such - far from it. But I do require that it takes me somewhere significant and illuminating, as with Wiles. Too often it is used in what seems to be little more than an intellectual game, and an arid one at that - analysis for analysis' sake - and we do not seem to have travelled very far. No lamps are lit .... Two books come this time from Aris and Phillips. First, following on Peter Jones's excellent commentary on the Odyssey, we now have his admirable edition of B* Odyssey 1 and 2.3 The preface states that this edition is intended primarily for students, and certainly it will prove invaluable to them, particularly to those new to Homer. The intro- duction, as well as giving a scene by scene analysis of Books 1 and 2 plus a discussion of the shaping of the poem as a whole, includes a concise and extremely clear explanation of formulaic composition and oral performance, a summary of basic Homeric grammar, hints on scansion, and elucidation of certain features of Homeric society such as the oikos and xenia. It also deals with such central Homeric problems as the siting of Troy and the question of Homer as a historical source, and points to further reading. All this is very good indeed. But perhaps most useful of all is the wealth of grammatical and dialectal help which replaces the traditional apparatus criticus at the foot of the text - a splendid idea this, given the intended readership. Add to this an accurate and readable line-by-line translation and a full and illuminating commentary, and we have a fine edition that will most admirably serve its intended users. The second welcome addition to the Aris and Phillips series is that of *Lucian, a Selection,4 one particularly welcome since it has been edited by Matthew Macleod who has long been respected for his valuable work on Lucian. We have here five dialogues (The Dream, The Judging of the Goddesses, The Assembly of the Gods, The Fisher- man, and Menippus), and four non-dialogue pieces (three shorter works - On the Death of Peregrinus, On Sacrifices, and Zeuxis - and the long and important How to Write History),</page><page sequence="3">82 SUBJECT REVIEWS all with sound and lively translations. The task of selection must have been no easy one, and, inevitably, each of us will have personal favourites that are not here; but Macleod's final choice succeeds very well in illustrating the satire, humour, variety, and sheer literary artis- try of Lucian. Moreover both commentaries and introduction discuss works not selected, so the end result is a good overview of Lucian's large and varied output. The introduction also analyses Lucian's humour and other literary characteristics, and discusses both his place within the Second Sophistic and his far-reaching influence on posterity ('... ifJules Verne is the father of modern science fiction, Lucian has a claim to be its great grandfather .. p. 15). In short, this book will do a great service in making Lucian readily accessible to and appreciated by a very wide audience. Leslie Kurke's B** The Traffic in Praise: Pindar and the Poetics of Social Economy5 offers a stimulating reading of Pindar's epinikia within their social context. 'How is it that Pindar's odes satisfied their heterogeneous audience? How did they juggle the interests, so often in tension if not in open conflict, of oikos, aristocracy, and polis?', she asks. To answer these questions, Kurke explores the workings of praise within the victor's household, his aristocratic group, and his city, focusing par- ticularly on Pindar's complex imagery. For the oikos, the victor's kleos is family property, 'symbolic capital' glorifying and preserving the oikos, so victory and praise are seen as libations for the dead ancestors and as the birth of an heir for the house. For the aristocratic group, praise functions like treasure in Homer, as reciprocal gift-giving between aristocratic houses which builds and sustains community, so victory imagery is drawn from the spheres of recompense, marriage, and guest-friendship. For the polis, victory is a public benefaction bestowing glory, and here imagery is taken from the workings of monetary exchange within the city. Performance of Pindar's praise thus satisfied the interests of the whole of his audience, and the returning victor was successfully reintegrated into his house, his class, and his city. Not all of this is new, of course: but Kurke's discussions throughout are firmly based on a careful analysis of Pindar's odes, with insights drawn from anthropology, sociology, and economics, and this remains an interesting and eminently readable book. Bern- hard Zimmermann's "*Greek Tragedy, an Introduction,6 now translated from the German edition of 1986, tries to do too much and achieves too little. The bulk of the book consists of plot summaries of every surviving tragedy; and although this approach does have its uses for those new to the subject - and indeed some perceptive comments are made - the result is, on the whole, superficial and disappointing. A more searching analysis of a few chosen plays would surely have given a more satisfactory result. As for the rest of the book: the introduc- tion discusses such general topics as the formation and survival of the tragic canon, the role of the chorus, music and metre (a brief but good summary), and the dramatic festivals of Athens, rightly stressing both the connection of drama with the cult of Dionysus and the reciprocal relation of tragedy and the polis. But sadly the performance aspect of tragedy has been almost completely disregarded. And, given that this is meant to be an introductory book, the bibliography lays far too much stress on works in German and thus will be of limited use to many students new to the subject. All in all, a far more satisfactory introduc- tion to Greek Tragedy is still Marion Baldock's excellent book with the same title in the Classical World Series of the Bristol Classical Press. With so much contemporary interest in the ancient Greek novel (see - to advertise a home product - Richard Hunter's article in my CA News no. 5), it would seem that Bruce MacQueen's BMyth, Rhetoric, and Fiction, a Reading of Longus's Daphnis and Chloe' is a timely publication. Unfortunately MacQueen takes no account of much modern work on the subject: he states that ancient Greek novels 'have had few serious readers' (p. 118), his bibliography lists only five works</page><page sequence="4">SUBJECT REVIEWS 83 published since 1983, none since 1987, and his appendix 'Scholarly interpretation of the ancient novel' is thus thoroughly out-of-date. This is disappointing. But, that said, his detailed analysis of the elaborate narrative structure of Daphnis and Chloe which forms the bulk of his book is nevertheless valuable, and his final conclusion interesting (if not entirely convincing): that the novel as a genre arose around 200 B.C. in a period of profound cultural crisis and in a world becoming increasingly aware of the difficulty of distinguishing true from false. Then, soon after Daphnis and Chloe was written around A.D. 200 when classical pagan civilization was on its last legs, the novel form declined and died in the upsurge of Christianity which saw the true and the false as simple and clear-cut. Only after the Refor- mation, another period of crisis when truth was once more seen to have more complexity, could the novel re-emerge from 'the dying embers of a disintegrating world'. Finally, two books from Malcolm Davies. It is a pleasure to review his admirable edition of Sophocles' **Trachiniae.8 He uses the new OCT text of Lloyd-Jones and Wilson, then discusses in his commentary cases of disagreement and other significant variants and con- jectures. His introduction, as well as treating the merits and unity of the play, gives a good analysis of the pre-Sophoclean tradition, paying particular attention (not surprisingly, given his work on the epic fragments) to The Sack of Oichalia, and deals with the difficult question of Heracles' apotheosis - or not, as the case may be - at the end of the play. But the great delight of the edition is Davies's detailed commentary, a model of close and careful scholar- ship, rich in sensitive discussion of textual problems, in textual parallels, in references to the relevant secondary reading. To scholars this commentary will be a splendid tool to help come to grips with the text and its meaning - a joy, a veritable feast (here I write with par- ticular anticipatory enthusiasm, for I have so far had time only to dip into it). But a warning should be given: this is not an edition for any but the most able student. What it lacks from the student's point of view is plentiful help with more general interpretation of the play. Here P. E. Easterling's edition (Cambridge U.P., 1982), giving generous help with interpretation and translation and tracing sensitively the general flow of dramatic action and the interplay between characters, is still invaluable. Also from Malcolm Davies comes his edition of Volume One of **Poetarum Melicorum Graecorum Fragmenta,9 a four- volume edition which will supersede Page's Poetae Melici Graeci, Supplementum Lyricis Graecis, and (with Lobel) Poetarum Lesbiorum Fragmenta. This first volume consists of the fragments of Alcman, Stesichorus, and Ibycus, and its first-rate quality promises well for what will clearly become the standard text of the lyric poets. Much has been added since Page: quite apart from the obvious addition of papyri finds since SLG in 1976, we now have testimonia related to the poets' life and art and a brief exegetical commentary on the frag- ments, plus a wider range of conjectures. All of this gives much additional and welcome help to the reader. A table at the back helpfully lists the fragments in the older works and points one to the appropriate place in the new edition; though I notice that from p. 213 and the Lille Stesichorus onwards the page numbers given go slightly awry. But let us not be petty about minor points. This is a very fine volume indeed, and we shall await the three future volumes, promised at two-yearly intervals, with eager anticipation. Which, come to think of it, is yet a third good reason for becoming a reviewer: all these glorious books.... JENNY MARCH</page><page sequence="5">84 SUBJECT REVIEWS NOTES 1.

Roman Literature Favourably noticing Guy Lee's literal translation of Catullus recently, I confessed that although I agreed with his philosophy of translation, there was nevertheless undoubtedly a loss of fire, of what makes you read Catullus at 15 when your girlfriend's left you, it's raining, and you discover that the friend to whom you lent the tape of Elmore James singing 'The Sky is Crying' must have left it on the radiator overnight. Gaius Valerius Catullus's Complete Poetic Works' by Jacob Rabinowitz goes all out for fire, flames, and inferno. According to the blurb, it has been read in draft by a number of distinguished classical scholars: William S. Burroughs glowingly says of this brilliant new work, 'Beautifully translated ... trivial, frivolous, profound, obscene. Read the fossils of lust.' Allen Ginsberg declares, 'What a favor! It's lighthearted, the most readable I know.' And underground writer Thom Metzger affirms, 'It's more fun than waving a dog's head on a stick at your mother.' This bold, yet literal translation of the ancient Roman poet Catullus is rendered in delightful lines. Rabinowitz grasps the elegance, passion, and nastiness not only of this Roman rude boy, but also of first-century B.C. Rome. Fun to read, this Catullus super- sedes the weary and stale bourgeois versions of these verses that have kept the lusty language of the poet from the equally lusty minds of his readers. Nobody ought to be held responsible for their blurb writer, but Rabinowitz himself bars no holds in the introduction: Catullus is one of Academe's best kept secrets. He's taught in part - usually in expurgated editions - and students are traditionally encouraged to turn their enthusiasm to Horace, a 'mature' poet (who sold out eagerly to Augustus and the New Order and wrote exquisite odes advising youths to die in wars of conquest). Catullus is ignored, dismissed as a 'young</page><page sequence="6">SUBJECT REVIEWS 85 man's interest,' and preserved in a Canopic jar, on a back shelf, by a league of tenured dust-buffs ... Before him, Roman literature was a wasteland. Epics that read like recruiting posters and lumbering, low-class comedies. The Romans were yokels - and knew it. They'd do anything to feel less boorish and stupid than the Greeks. Rather like the Americans felt about the British in the nineteenth century. What I find interesting about this rhetoric is not so much its absurdity - if any shelves groan under the weight of newradicalfreelustyabandonedyouthful translations it's the Catullus section of your local library - but that I guess it does probably recapitulate Catullus' own Oedipal revolt against the past in Roman literature: a poet has to make daddy into a monster before supplanting him (cf. PCPhS 216 (1990), 56). To be against this sort of stuff is difficult: who wants to play Captain Hook against Peter Pan, youth, joy, and the little bird who's just left his nest? I think there are however two legitimate criticisms that one can make. First, there is the danger of Nigel Kennedyism: dressing radical but playing con- servative. In the preface Rabinowitz says that Catullus wrote for an audience 'for whom boy-whores and subtle verses, elegance and insurrection, mythology and scandal are equal and complementary interests' but he sees the transmitted ordering of the poems as 'unintel- ligibility, pure randomness' and reorders them under headings like 'Friends', 'Lesbia', 'Politics'. This may be right: but even if not original, the manuscript order makes for a much more challenging and interesting reading than this tidy compartmentalization. Similarly, it may be right that the last stanza of poem 51 does not belong with the rest of the poem, though I doubt it: but to put it as a separate poem (89) with the heading 'Catullus' farewell to his urban ease, on setting out for Bithynia' ('Catullus, you haven't got enough to do, you wouldn't carry on like this if you had a job') again replaces something interesting with utter banality. The heart (or should it be somewhere lower down?) of this sort of translation is the sex - the cover classification is 'Classics / Erotic Literature' - but where this is not explicit Rabinowitz can be strangely coy. In 86 (Rabinowitz's 43) Catullus contrasts Quintia with Lesbia as lacking the latter's mica salis, saltiness. For Rabinowitz this is 'elegance', 'grace- giving style': Lee's 'grain of salt' keeps us closer to the tastiness of Lesbia's sex. Sex brings me to the second problem. To stress Catullus' modernity involves an appropriation which needs to be balanced by an awareness of alterity. Scholars have often sought in classical antiquity as in Samoa or the Trobriand islands a location for fantasies of sexual liberation: the 'Hans Licht' syndrome. There has to be a place where sex is easier than it is bei uns. One of the major achievements of feminist and gay scholarship has been to make us aware that the sort of joyous liberation that is found is often a liberation only for heterosexual men, and that there is a dark side to ancient attitudes to sex (one thinks especially of Richlin's Gardens of Priapus). One of Rabinowitz's target markets is clearly the swimming-pool library: but ought we not to have had signalled to us that Catullus might not be completely at home on the Slab in Hampstead? At one point Rabinowitz compares Catullus to a 'rock-star', but the world of Spinal Tap is not renowned for advanced views on sexuality. When Catullus calls 'Mamurra and Miss Julius Caesar' 'filthy faggots' or threatens Furius and Aurelius with penetration, the presupposition is that 'passive' gay sex is disgusting and demeaning: does Rabinowitz believe this? If not, then I think we should be told, even if it complicates our sympathetic response to Catullus' modernity. As I say, I think these are legitimate criticisms of this sort of translation: it's not the sixties any more. And yet: it is still true that by going all out for colloquial accessibility Rabinowitz's versions do get through when more complex</page><page sequence="7">86 SUBJECT REVIEWS ones fail. Here for instance is the beginning of 22 (his 167), one of those that I thought worked: Hey Varus, you know that guy Suffenus - he's gracious, witty, city-slick, and he writes all that poetry? Lines by the thousand! And not on scrap paper - they're all copied out on new sheets of the most expensive vellum, bound in leather and stamped with gold. But if you read them, then that lovely gent Suffenus, the neatest sheet in Rome, turns into a clod just off the bus from Podunk, ex-superintendent of goats ... Nobody nowadays of course ever says 'city-slick' or 'lovely gent' but they still work OK, and 'ex-superintendent of goats' is the sort of thoughtfulness that Rabinowitz does genuinely show at his best (see e.g. also his 85 = poem 26, 'Furius is so poor, the bugs in his house / took out a second mortgage on the roach motel'). This is a volume well worth teachers getting hold of as a source for free-ish versions which can be productively compared-and-contrasted with the originals: even Rabinowitz's (rare) mistakes can be amusing. When at the end of 15 (his 86) Aurelius is threatened with 'radishes and mullet' for adultery, Rabinowitz produces with 'radishes and wriggling fish' something that is considerably less painful than the original (see Ellis ad loc.) but which sets up interesting intertextualities with the goldfish scene in Lace and recent US revelations about gerbils. The new Oxford text of Sallust2 by Leighton Reynolds is a very different sort of work (how's that for a link?). Up to now the standard edition has been the third edition of Kurfess's Teubner (1957): the absence of an Oxford text has been one of the most prominent lacunae in that series. Reynolds provides not only a new text of the major works (including the appendix) but also a more generous selection of fragments from the Histories than Kurfess, though a full scale edition of the fragments to replace Maurenbrecher remains a desideratum. Writing in 1984 on the lacuna at Jug. 103.2-112.3 which is our main means of classifying manuscripts into mutili and integri (Revue d'histoire des textes 14-15 (1984-5), 56-69 at p. 61) Reynolds had commented that 'with few exceptions the manuscripts of Sallust are of indifferent quality and ringing the changes on them has little effect on a text which paradoxically manages to triumph over its own transmission. The most that one can hope to do is to introduce more order into the apparatus and tidy up the text here and there. The gains are too slight to justify any elaborate demarche.' Accordingly his new text does not contain many startling novelties (though topographic military historians - all of you - might note the adoption of ab Tucca at Jug. 104.1), but the apparatus is very considerably simplified. Reynolds believes that all the integri (which are later than the mutili) are really suppleti, and that they have very little to offer outside the lacuna: accordingly, out of the over 500 manuscripts extant he regularly cites only 9 of the mutili (ABCNKHDF). This sort of restriction is usually a sign of laziness, but it is clear that Reynolds has actually collated many more manuscripts and has only come to this conclusion after an enormous amount of work: he candidly admits that many will ask 'Quis credere posset omnes reliquos libros, tot et tanto labore exaratos, tam superbe abiciendos esse?' (pp. xv-xvi) and attempts to answer them. Whether he is right or not I cannot say, but the apparatus the hypothesis produces is certainly clearer and more usable than that of Kurfess, without, as far as I can tell, omitting information relevant to the casual philological reader, if such a creature exists. My one cavil is that this austerity is continued into other aspects of the edition. The indirect tradition is particularly important in Sallust: Kurfess gives testimonia in a section above his apparatus, while Reynolds only cites them when relevant to textual questions and refers the reader to R. Zimmermann, Der</page><page sequence="8">SUBJECT REVIEWS 87 Sallusttext im Altertum (Munich, 1929) for more. This certainly saves space, but at a certain inconvenience. More importantly, this edition does not continue the practice instituted with Zwierlein's Seneca and Courtney's Silvae of giving a bibliography of where conjectures have been made. This is unhelpful, and encourages the practice of evaluating a conjecture without considering its author's arguments. When I meet with the name of Shackleton Bailey at Jug. 15.5 or 32.1 I am presumably supposed as a gentleman scholar to know where the conjecture was made: I don't, and it's not particularly easy to find out (Reynolds refers to Leeman's bibliography of 1965, but it isn't there and in any case why should one have to track down a supplement to Mnemosyne for the information?). So this is a little too 'Oxford' an Oxford text for my liking: but it is still a major contribution to Sallustian studies and one that deserves a warm welcome. Intending purchasers should note that there was a mistake in the initial printing: copies were recalled, but it is possible that a few slipped through (like the review copy). Check whether line 5 on p. 21 is lacunose: if it isn't, you're all right. Three of this issue's books are on Silver Latin epic, in whole or part, and testify to the continuing shift in taste which is bringing Lucan, Statius, and to a lesser extent Silius and Valerius back into the canon. Unquestionably the most important of these, and one of the most significant books on Latin literature to appear in recent years, is Denis Feeney's B The Gods in Epic.3 This is a study of the 'divine machinery' of epic from Homer to Statius, but that bald statement of theme does little justice to the riches that Feeney offers - riches that I hope will justify a note which is less than brief even by my standards. There are seven chapters, plus an introduction and epilogue. The first chapter begins not exactly with Homer but with his early reception. After a sketch of the history of Homeric interpretation down to Hellenistic times, Feeney offers a synchronic account of the major themes and techniques of ancient Homeric scholarship on the gods, based inevitably especially on the evidence of the Homeric scholia. The problem of the gods and their role in epic was a central one from the beginning of theological speculation in the ancient world, and Feeney offers a sceptical but sympathetic account of the ways in which ancient scholars tried to deal with phenomena like vivid anthropomorphism and divine intervention in human affairs. The portrayal of gods raises acutely the question 'of the poet's authority, of what kind of belief it is that poetry generates' (p. 3) and that too is one of his main concerns: in some ways there- fore this is a Latin counterpart to Simon Goldhill's The Poet's Voice. We have seen the Homeric scholia put to radically different uses in recent years: selectively as a bolster to Jasper Griffin's humanist recuperation of Homer, reductively by Malcolm Heath to act as a brake on modern critical reading. Feeney is scrupulous in sharing with the reader his aware- ness of the methodological problems of using ancient scholarship, and is emphatic that 'the critical techniques of the ancient world should enlighten, not constrain us' (p. 2). Although he certainly succeeds in avoiding the Scylliness of setting the bounds of interpretation within the skull of Aristarchus, I am not sure that he entirely escapes the alternative danger of read- ing the ancient interpreters too sympathetically. In dealing with the gods, ancient critics frequently used the techniques of allegory and rationalization, but Feeney is able to show that these did not exhaust the methods employed, and that ancient views on the truth of the poets can be extremely suggestive as a corrective to the naive assumption that realism must be the most basic mode into which all the devices of the divine machinery can ultimately be translated. But when he tries to find traces of a 'third way' in Aristotle and Eratosthenes I suspect he is making more of them than is justified. For Feeney, we can see in Aristotle the view that 'it is up to the poet to bring his moulding power to bear on the world of experience and tradition in order to produce something which functions within a genre which has its</page><page sequence="9">88 SUBJECT REVIEWS own rules' (p. 29) and Eratosthenes' rejection of the Stoic view of Homer as a source of knowledge shows 'a more or less conscious apprehension that poetry had its own rules and functions, and was not to be examined or put to the test according to extraneous canons' (p. 40). The uncharacteristic vagueness of these paraphrases suggests not only, I think, their distance from the texts on which they are based but also one of the problems Feeney faces throughout the work. He is very good at saying clearly what roles the gods do not play in ancient epic, but has much greater difficulty saying what it is that they do do: not because of incapacity, but because of the extraordinarily difficult nature of the subject. What you do not get from this book is a clear statement of what precisely you should do with the gods in the various epics: but you get something much more valuable, which is an immensely sensitive and sophisticated examination of the ramifications of an immensely complicated subject. The second chapter is on Apollonius Rhodius, another figure who has enjoyed a revolutionary revaluation in recent years. This brilliantly puts before us a dark and pes- simistic Argonautica in which everything about the gods is problematized by a narrator whose emblem is the trickily inscrutable Phineus, for whom Zeus demands that prophecy (like this sentence) be always incomplete (2.311-6, discussed p. 60). In this world 'where even the narrator finds it hard to discern a pattern' (p. 94) the gods in their interactions with mortals 'either resist embodiment altogether, or make themselves exceedingly difficult to assimilate' (p. 80). So, for instance, when Athena helps the Argonauts through the Symple- gades in Book 2 and steps 'with her feet onto a cloud, a light one, which could carry her in a moment, despite her weight' (2.538-9, discussed pp. 72-73) the 'two ways of conceptualiz- ing divine motion' - mysterious on the one hand (cf the following simile in 2.541-6), emphatically corporeal on the other, produce 'a shifting tension between the physicality and the immateriality of the goddess'. 'Shifting' is one of Feeney's watchwords: if Gregory Hutchinson's 'piquant' Hellenistic Poetry endorsed the 'HP Sauce' view of poetics, Feeney brings in the removal men. In both detail and general line this is a powerful and to me wholly persuasive reading of the epic and its 'clammy atmosphere of uncertain confusion' (p. 89). One of the important influences on this reading, as he acknowledges (p. 94 n. 131), is A. Bul- lock's article on Callimachean religion, 'The Future of a Hellenistic Illusion' (MH 41 (1984), 209-30): though Feeney claims that Apollonius is less 'relentless and intense' than Callimachus, his own argument does not really bear this out. Bullock distanced the insta- bility he saw in Callimachus from that in 5th-century tragedy: 'Sophocles presented a world where divine power has terrifying consequences for man, but where that power is at least systematized and comprehensible' (art. cit., 229). But many recent readings of Sophocles are more aporetic, and it would have been interesting to see Feeney bring in tragedy more prominently in connection with the Argonautica: the weight that falls on events subsequent to the end of the work, for instance, is an extreme development of a Sophoclean habit analysed by Deborah Roberts in her excellent 'Sophoclean Endings: another story' (Arethusa 21 (1988), 177-96). It is a cliche that Vergil is Sophoclean: perhaps another element in which he was anticipated by Apollonius. But as with all the criticisms I am trying to include to balance the excess of my general approbation, when we are given so much it is churlish to complain of omissions: Feeney is well aware of the endless nature of his subject (p. 392). The next chapter moves from Greece to Rome, and the beginnings of Roman epic with Livius, Naevius, and Ennius. Feeney's focus here is inevitably Romanitai, what is different about gods in Latin. He emphasizes that in theology at Rome 'poetry and poets are peripheral to the issue' (p. 104), and the gods are more free from 'the apparatus of fable and story' (p. 108, with a telling comparison of Varro and Apollodorus): but the Capitoline cult</page><page sequence="10">SUBJECT REVIEWS 89 meant that 'the relationship between Rome and Jupiter was unique' (p. 115), and this is reflected in the way that in both Naevius and Ennius Rome's rise to power is seen as 'the planned outcome of centuries of divine design' (p. 109). He admits that the fragments of Ennius present us with a more confusing picture, with Jupiter depicted as 'the son of a euhemeristic Saturn, a cosmic force of cohesion, something on a couch at a Roman lectisternium, a dedicatee from a Greek king, a Zeus-figure chairing a meeting of factious kin, a clap of thunder' (p. 124) but ultimately 'whatever other manifestations Jupiter may have had in the poem as a god of nature or as Homer's Zeus, he was before all the Capitoline god of the Roman people' (p. 128). This must be substantially true (and of course I have left out all the detailed reconstruction on which it is based), but I would like to register a slight unease at the apparent ease with which the paradigm of 'Roman Ennius' is here borne out. Before getting to this de clause, we have had a substantial men in which Feeney himself has stressed how 'bold and novel' (p. 121), 'radical' (p. 122), 'remarkable' (p. 123), and 'bizarre' (p. 123) much of Ennius would have seemed to the Roman audience. This may in any case underestimate the sophistication of early 2nd-century B.C. Rome, but it is worth asking what happens to our view of the beginnings of Roman literature if we reverse Feeney's emphasis. The fourth chapter, on Vergil (which subsumes material from his article 'The reconciliations ofJuno' in CQ 34 (1984), 179-94), involves Feeney in confronting his theme most directly. Gordon Williams in his Technique and Ideas argued strongly for a view of Vergil's gods as merely figures for human psychological phenomena, but Feeney sets out to show that 'peremptory demythologising of the divine action ... robs the poem of more than beauty and colour (though that would be sacrifice enough to protest against). It strips away the poem's power to engage us in a sweep of fear and release which makes the critics' isolated "themes" mean something' (p. 136). As often, Feeney is clearly right, but not right clearly. I think it would have helped to stress more that the problem of anthropomorphism is one of descriptive detail. Feeney quotes with approval (p. 39) Servius' claim that in carminibus quaedam nec ad subtilitatem nec ad veritatem exigenda sunt and argues himself that 'the nature of fictive narrative is such that this type of symbol absolutely requires abundant, even redundant, fictive energy and power' (p. 137, my emphasis) but what exactly is this redundancy: what is left between the poles of reality effect and symbolism? But again, however much one feels that the Feeney's general statements on the role of the gods are not quite there yet, this chapter offers a superb reading of the Aeneid which effortlessly refutes the providentialist fantasies of Wlosok (p. 154) and Cairns (p. 160). It is part of his point, indeed, that what is going on is hard to formulate, as is brought out especially in his discussion of Allecto's infuriation of Amata and Turnus in Book 7. In the case of the former, he shows well how the physicality of the description of the snake makes it 'extremely difficult to gloss these lines as "Amata went mad with rage" and also extremely difficult to disentangle what is happening' (p. 165), and that similarly in the latter case 'Allecto's action does not illuminate the switch in Turnus, it obscures it: she is not there to make it easier for us to understand, but to make it harder, or impossible' (p. 171). These negative formulations of the force of 'characterful narration' of divine action are much more successful than the positive ones. The next chapter on Ovid's Metamorphoses has to face the problem of that work's generic evasions, but Feeney rightly emphasizes that the 'continually destabilized generic norms' (p. 188) of the work actually enable it to become a 'commentary on the epic view of the gods': to break bounds is to define them. In many ways I suspect this may have been the easiest chapter to write, because the current standard view of Ovid as PoMo Pat offers extremely productive tools for critical reading: we are talking serious retrorectal</page><page sequence="11">90 SUBJECT REVIEWS shifting here. Nevertheless, Feeney gets the emphasis just right: Ovid 'sports ceaselessly with his power to command or suspend our credence in his fictions' (p. 225) but this is not simply a jokey game: 'rather, his techniques involve a preternaturally keen awareness of the suspen- sion of disbelief and belief that constitutes fiction' (p. 229). When in Book 8 Pirithous dis- believes Achelous's tale but Lelex stresses the power of the gods, it is insinuated to the reader that 'to swim successfully in the sea of the Metamorphoses we must be both Lelex and Pirithous' (p. 230), to 'have it both ways' (which might be Feeney's motto). I would be expected to agree with this, and I do, but can I make another plea that when we discuss these aspects of fictionality, we take more explicit account of the insights of the German Roman- tic Ironists? Feeney refers with approval to Conte's discussion of Ariadne in the Fasti in The Rhetoric of Imitation: he might have made more of Conte's nod in the direction of Schlegel and Solger (p. 62 n. 30). As with all the chapters, this is filled with perceptive points of detail which I have to omit: and it shows also how much the theme of divine detail can contribute to the exploration of the standard issues in each author. Feeney offers here, for instance, a very satisfying account of the politics of the Metamorphoses through an examination of the 'privatization' of religion at the end of the poem and the central identification ofJupiter and Augustus which 'exemplifies the slippery terrain of such panegyric, for the gods are not (least of all in this poem) neutral ground of praise' (p. 220): 'with an apparent guilelessness that never entirely vanishes, Augustus' repeated assertions of divine status are taken at face value by Ovid,and nobody - not Augustus, not Ovid, not any reader - can circumscribe the limits at which the implications of this status cease to register' (p. 223). With chapter six, 'Epics of History: Lucan's Bellum Civile and Silius' Punica', Feeney begins to move on to territory which will be less familiar to many readers. Lucan poses a particular problem: Feeney is concerned to establish the value of the detailed representation of divine action, but he also believes that the Bellum Civile, in which such representation is minimized, is a great poem. Moreover, he cannot use the notion that the Bellum Civile is a historical epic to justify the absence of the gods because he argues (with Haiissler and others) that the norm for such epics was to include divine action. I have some doubts about this in relation to Greek historical epic, where there is no direct evidence and it is not quite enough to produce parallel material from other genres or art. But Naevius and Ennius are enough to make the point in the Roman tradition. Feeney takes a Woodmanly line on the question of what history is: 'we are dealing with distinctions of mode and genre - not of subject-matter, nor chronology, nor even, as we would put it, "historicity" (whether something really happened or not): what counts is the appropriate treatment of the data of received tradition. Historical narrative aims to persuade by keeping to what can be accepted as probable or likely' (p. 260). Again, I have some reservations about this: though broadly in agreement with the Woodman line, I think he underestimates the extent to which veri simile and verum were distinguished in antiquity. So here, when Feeney quotes Servius' definition of history as quicquid secundum naturam dicitur, sivefactum sive non factum (p. 255) and claims that 'the yardstick for history is first and foremost "real life" and the probabilities of real life, and only secondarily whether something happened or not' (p. 259), he ignores the alternative tripartite division into historia, plasma, and mythos which he had earlier himself stressed (p. 31: for the background to the battle between these schemes, see G. Puglisi in Philologus 129 (1985), 39-53, an article of which Feeney is aware but which he perhaps underuses). But Feeney is still substantially right in seeing 'the characterful narration of divine action' (p. 261) as one of the most important ways in which poetry was distinguished from epic: and this intensifies the problem of the exclusion of the gods from the Bellum Civile. Feeney's</page><page sequence="12">SUBJECT REVIEWS 91 answer is that the gods are still there, but under erasure (p. 301, 'their presence is always being registered as absent, their absence as present'). Lucan 'cannot represent the gods in action because he is radically uncertain on everything to do with their motives and meaning' (p. 278); 'a divine apparatus is capable of sustaining many ambiguities, but not this funda- mental inability to decide whether the action of the poem is design or happenstance' (p. 281). This perhaps underestimates the power of the tradition as he has shown it working in Apollonius and Ovid, but this version of the traditional defence that Fatum/Fortuna replaces the gods is persuasive. More importantly, however, Feeney shows that the divine palimpsest keeps coming through: 'if a recurrent and permanent possibility in the poem is a despairing anarchism, the poet still cannot abandon altogether the compulsion to blame the guilty gods, nor can be deprive himself of the claustrophobic sense of trapped inevitability which is provided by the language of Fate' (p. 282). Thus we end up with 'a fractured voice, unsystematic and at odds with itself' (p. 282): 'eeeverything is broken' as John Bob Dylan Thomas Hardy Henderson might have put it (and probably has). Feeney's debt here to the recent work of Henderson and Masters is explicit, and all I can say again is that I find it completely convincing: but even those who find themselves deferred will find a great deal of illumination and insight in Feeney's discussion of detail. Unfortunately the dozen pages on Silius appended to this account of Lucan are less successful. Feeney's D.Phil. was on the Punica, and familiarity has bred contempt: he regards Silius as 'a quite remarkably bad poet, on virtually every count' (p. 251) and uses the poem to show how not to handle divine action: 'Silius' gods come very close to being the tropes or figures which modern critics often take the gods of Vergil or Apollonius to be, and nothing can demonstrate the inadequacy of such readings of Vergil and Apollonius more powerfully than the experience of reading, and rereading, the seventeen books of the Punica' (p. 311). He may well be right: but he does not allow himself enough space to justify his harsh judgement, and as always the reader ends up overly sympathetic to the slagged-off victim. At the end of Juno's speech to Hannibal in Book 1 for instance, we are told haec ait ac iuvenem facta ad Mavortia flammat (1.55), and Feeney criticizes that casual flammat which has to refer to more than her words (contra Duff) but which receives no development in her text. But Silius goes on to describe how Hannibal was already eager ingenio (56-62) and then returns to Juno's intervention at 63 dat mentem Iuno ac laudum spe corda fatigat, followed by an account of Hannibal's fervid dreams (64-69) which are presumably sent by Juno. This gives content to flammat: not of course the sort of content we get with Allecto in Vergil, but it is not simply 'a floating piece of colour, generating nothing' (p. 308). It is worth noting that Ernesti, with the sure rhetori- cal instinct of the 18th century, paragraphed so that line 55 began this new section rather than ending the previous, which helps the reader to seek elucidation of flammat in what follows. As I say, the point is not that Feeney is necessarily wrong about the Punica, but that he cannot demonstrate its awfulness in a dozen pages to readers who have not had the joys of daily intercourse with the work (though it sounds as if Silius was the active partner). Finally, Feeney returns to 'epics of myth' and to Valerius Flaccus and Statius. Valerius has the reputation for being the Flavian epicist for people who don't like Flavian epic, a bit of a village idiot. Feeney accepts that cheerfulness keeps breaking through and that it is hard to escape a 'two voices' view of the Argonautica in which darkness and pessimism are con- tinually undermined by a tendency to the 'ameliorative' (p. 335), in contrast to the 'final ironies' of Apollonius. But he makes a good case for seeing the work as more sophisticated and self-conscious in its manipulation of the tradition than it is usually held to be: in par- ticular, he emphasizes the way that developments in Augustan and post-Augustan poetry</page><page sequence="13">92 SUBJECT REVIEWS like love-elegy made the 'generic tussle' (p. 320) present in the work starker than it had been for Apollonius as Valerius' Argonautica 'strives to remain an epic of martial endeavour in the face of the threat of the love-theme'. It is Statius, however, who forms the climactic point of the book in a neat emplotting that combines temporal and logical structuring, Endzeit and Gotterddmmerung. Starting from C. S. Lewis's account of Statius' allegorical figures in The Allegory ofLove, he shows that if the gods are displaced by them, they in turn yield place to man in the poem's humanist final book: 'the gods become unapproachable and inef- fectual; the qualities that are associated with them and with humans are allowed to act for a while with success, as in the case of Virtus, or without as in the case of Pietas; finally, the poet's focus confines itself almost entirely to human emotions and exchanges' (p. 391). Again, en passant a great many points of detail are suggestively discussed and the major problems of the Thebaid cast in a new light: if, for instance, the action is continually delayed, the narrator shows himself well-aware of his differance, and is continually 'confiding in his audience as he charts the straightened arena in which he must perform' (p. 344: on this and many other aspects of the poem, put on the shades and read John Henderson's piece in PCPhS n.s. 37 [1991], 30-79). But Lewis's focus on allegory also leads to a discussion of the trope which provides one of the most satisfactory of Feeney's encounters with his main theme. There is still in Feeney's Negativenreihen ('not A, not B, but C') a degree of evasion, as when he remarks that 'Statius' allegorical technique .., .is not a way of making the charac- ters of the poem more interesting or accessible, a way of helping us think more clearly or more richly about Eteocles, or Polynices, or any other character; rather it is an experiment in universalizing the moral experiences described in the action' (p. 380: but isn't all litera- ture about hoia an genoito?). But he gets closer to what is going on when he talks of 'the con- tinual reshuffling of positions demanded by the reader, who is tracing the tussle between the action of the human characters and the action of the allegorical figures who impinge on them' (p. 381). Allegory is a special case of metaphor, and Max Black's 'interaction' theory of metaphor, though it has flaws from a logical/linguistic point of view (cf. J. Martin Soskice, Metaphor and Religious Language [Oxford, 1985], pp. 38-51), has proved a powerful paradigm for what is happening in figural language in general: it lies at the base, for instance, of Conte's account of allusion. 'Having it both ways' is essential to many literary phenomena (e.g. simile, ekphrasis), and whatever metaphors we choose for the process (mixing, montage, fighting, or whatever) the essence has to be the reader's refusal to settle down: in which case, attempts to describe an ideal home for her are misplaced. But it would be quite wrong to leave this not-very-brief-at-all-notice with criticism, however qualified, because Feeney has written a book that merits much more simple laudation. This is in every way a first-rate work, which combines many of the most exciting developments in con- temporary Latin scholarship with old-fashioned virtues like clarity and temperance. It is above all a generous book: in the detail it provides and its presentation, but also in the warmth of the approbation of other scholars and the sympathy towards its subjects (except for Silius. ..). Of the trends in recent criticism that it exemplifies so successfully, two might be singled out. First, the recognition of the highly self-conscious nature of the intertextual dialogues that Latin poetry conducts has led to an appreciation of the ways in which poets enter their own texts: as prophets like Phineus in Apollonius, internal artistic narrators like Arachne in Ovid (discussed pp. 190-3, where it is instructive to contrast Feeney's leaning towards Arachne with Byron Harris's endorsement of Calliope in PCPhS 216 [1990], 64- 82), or above all as creator gods (see, e.g., p. 319 on the magnum opus of Valerius' Jupiter). Feeney brilliantly shows that one can do much more with this than merely label it mise en</page><page sequence="14">SUBJECT REVIEWS 93 abyme. Second, if the dominant metaphors of traditionally classical criticism have been architectural or physiological - the text as harmoniously fitted-together building or body - much recent criticism has replaced these with images of contestation (or indeed reinterpreted buildings and bodies in terms of conflict). At the heart of this is the great 20th- century trope of Text as Society as Text, coupled with the Marxist insight that it all comes down to who will be master. However partial this is as social theory, the dynamic element that has thus been imported into criticism is wholly to the good. Genres, for instance, become not so much inert patterns to be mixed or crossed but volatile and pugnacious brawlers fighting it out on the streets of the text. One of the most prominent features of the gods in the ancient epic tradition is their warfare, and Feeney is not slow to extend this warfare to other aspects of his texts: when he's not shifting things, he's well into 'tussles' (cf., e.g., p. 349 on the cosmic struggle in the Thebaid), the word at war, to coin a phrase. Quite apart from his main theme, therefore, Feeney provides an excellent introduction to the state-of-the-art in Latin criticism, and a pointer to the sort of works we can expect to be appearing in the new monograph series he is editing with Stephen Hinds. But again, that is too faint a praise for a book that is equally excellent on its theme: it is indispensable reading for anyone seriously interested in Latin literature, and it is to be hoped that OUP will soon produce a paperback edition which will enable ordinary mortals to buy it. I hope the importance of Feeney's volume will excuse my devoting so much space to it, but it means I must be unfairly laconic about the rest of this issue's books. The other two works on Silver Latin are Michael Dewar's edition of "Statius, Thebaid IX4 and a new Ramus volume in the series The Imperial Muse5 covering the Flavian epicists to Claudian. Dewar's volume is based on his Oxford D.Phil. for which one of the examiners was Denis Feeney, and it offers an independent text (Dewar lists 21 differences from Hill), a literal translation (an excellent continuation of the practice begun with Kathy Coleman's Silvae IV in the same series of Oxford Classical Monographs), a detailed commentary, and a wide-ranging introduction which is especially good on Statius' fortuna. This is very well done, the best commentary to date in any language on a book of the Thebaid - and indeed on any of the Silver epics - and will certainly prove immensely useful: it has to be said, however, that after Feeney's account of Statius Dewar's work is inevitably a little unexciting. The main problem, as often, lies in the view taken of allusion. Intertextuality is central to Silver epic: a Thebaid in Statius' day could not help but be The Return of the Seven. Dewar documents much of this, and does often try to interpret it, but he is hampered by a view of intertextuality as adaptation or rivalry (cf. p. xxi) which leaves the intertextual presences inert or underestimated. In the course of Parthenopaeus' aristeia, for instance, the young warrior is apostrophized by the poet (744): quos, age, Parrhasio sternis, puer improbe, cornu?, 'Come, whom do you lay low, unrelenting boy, with your Parrhasian bow?' The generic contamination with addresses by love poets to Cupid set up by that puer improbe (cf. Lyne on Ciris 133) is outrageously disruptive and disturbing, and Dewar's comment that this is a 'wry echo' of Eclogue 8.49 is inadequate. More importantly, though referring to Lyne's Further Voices for archery as unheroic, Dewar does not explore here the way that Statius mixes Nisus and Euryalus with lulus' killing of Remulus Numanus in his imitation of Aeneid 9 (though he notes the more direct echoes later on at 790ff.), something which is suggestive for our evaluation of the controversial status of lulus' action. This topic of the reception of the Aeneid in later epic is the subject of Philip Hardie's opening essay 'Flavian epicists on Virgil's epic technique' in the Ramus volume, and is one of the highlights of the volume, a brilliant study of 'com- binatorial imitation' which shows how the use by later epicists of two or more passages of</page><page sequence="15">94 SUBJECT REVIEWS the Aeneid can be suggestive for our own reading. One of his examples is Statius' Partheno- paeus episode (pp. 9-14), and his detailed exploration of its dense use of Vergil shows how much more can be done with Flavian intertextuality. Still, we should be grateful to Dewar for what he has given us: the contrast with R. D. Williams's edition of Thebaid X shows just how much more we now expect from a commentary and how much more professionally scholars are working to provide it. The rest of the Ramus volume is predictably a mixed bag: I am inclined to think the standard is rising, but I suspect this is just that my own critical views have been changing since the earlier volumes. There are six articles in all on Flavian epic, two on Tacitus, and one each on Apuleius, Ausonius, Ammianus Marcellinus, Pruden- tius, and Claudian, and approaches vary from the caution of Donald Hill ('Statius' Thebaid: a glimmer of light in a sea of darkness', pp. 98-118: actually, despite the title and Hill's daftly cheery view of the Aeneid, a good argument for a darkly pessimistic Thebaid) to the caution of John Henderson ('Tacitus/the world in pieces', pp. 167-210, 'written in Bristol and unwritten in Cambridge'). All are worth reading, even Arthur J. Pomeroy's simplistic 'Silius Italicus as "Doctus Poeta"' (pp. 119-39), which will not convince Denis Feeney to have another go, and C. E. Gruzelier's dated but detailed romp through Claudian's 'powers of description' which closes the volume, and the best are perspicuously suggestive: S. Georgia Nugent's 'Ausonius' "late-antique" poetics and "post-modern" literary theory', pp. 236-60, for instance, includes the clearest account I have seen of intertextuality (pp. 247-51). If there is a dominant theme amongst this disparity, it is an acknowledgement of the ways in which texts and their reading are enmeshed with politics: 'Syme is right', as Henderson puts it in a felicitous tribute from one Oxford man to another (p. 194: see esp. his footnotes 16, 23, 54). Back to the Neronian age for Edward Courtney's edition of B** The Poems of Petronius. 6 K. Muller had included in his edition of the Satyricon (it is ten- dentious to call it Satyrica as Courtney does because we do not know how the 'title page' was set out in the original edition and therefore whether there was a play in the Latin word between Greek genitive plural and nominative singular) only those poetic fragments that were explicitly ascribed to Petronius. Courtney believes that a number of the fragments that Buecheler included are Petronian, and offers a new edition with commentary of those he believes are genuine plus three from Buecheler which he doesn't accept and one which was not even in Buecheler but has been thought Petronian by others. He has also included most of the poems extant in the main Petronian narrative 'so that the reader can make the com- parison' (p. 1): the bits left out are 'the poems on the educational curriculum (5), the capture of Troy (89), the civil war (119-24), snatches of verse produced by Trimalchio (34.10, 55.3), and a brief Vergilian cento (132.11)'. Though Courtney (sort of) has his reasons, there is undoubtedly a bit of the Chinese encyclopedia about this and the result is less than satisfac- tory: neither an edition of the poems of Petronius, nor of all the Buecheler fragments excluded by Miller. It would have been much more helpful to produce a complete edition of the fragments of Petronius (verse and prose), with a generous selection of spuria. Courtney is certainly right in arguing that some of the poems excluded by Mfiller are Petronian, but some of his own criteria for inclusion are shaky: basically he includes poems extant in con- texts that contain known Petronian material unless there are linguistic or other grounds for suspicion, especially if the poems look more like excerpts than self-standing poems, but one must have doubts about some of his other criteria like, for instance, 'cloacal interest' (p. 9). Still, we must be grateful for what we do get: the commentary is especially valuable in the absence of any modern commentaries on the Satyricon outside the Cena (but a translation would have been nice). The text of the poems extant in the main tradition differs from</page><page sequence="16">SUBJECT REVIEWS 95 Miiller's in only minor ways (I noticed 23.3, 93.2, 131.8, 135.8, 137), but in the fragments new readings are offered in 30 or so places, and some of these changes are more substantial: fr. 39 (AL 473R), for instance, with the change from venis to ventris is now about flatulence not coitus. There are a few remarks of literary importance, as for instance on parody of the Odyssey (p. 45: cf. S.J. Harrison in MD 25 [1990], 193-201), but on the whole this is a volume for specialists. Two points that Courtney raises, however, have wider import and interestingly bring us to issues handled by Feeney. Courtney sensibly discusses the question of Petronius' supposed Epicureanism, and argues that he 'is in no sense propagating Epi- curean doctrine, but is quite willing to allow his characters to justify their acts by recourse to a superficial Epicureanism' (p. 14). One of his arguments is that although 104.3 has Encol- pius supporting Epicurus on dreams, and the poem fr. 30 = AL 651R may well have come from the same context, the text of the Satyricon shows that the dreams in question were actually genuine, and thus contradicts Epicurean doctrine. He regards as 'over-subtle' P. Kragelund's suggestion (CQ 39 [1989], 436-50) that the dreams might be regarded as wish-fulfilment dreams that come true by pure chance (though Kragelund is in broad agree- ment on the question of the overall attitude to Epicureanism). But this raises the question of the representation of divine action in the Satyricon as a whole (what actually happened with Priapus' curse?) and in the novel in general ... One of Courtney's other arguments (a bad one) is that when Encolpius excuses himself for taking the phrase 'self-abuse' too literally at 132.15, he uses the word opus (quid me constricta spectatis fronte, Catones, / damnatisque novae simplicitatis opus?). If (if.) we imagine that Encolpius' narrative was depicted as oral, then opus would point the reader to Petronius as the author of the written Satyricon (and hence, as the sentiments are only superficially Epicurean, Petronius is not a Gardener). This is as I say, a terrible argument, but it points to an interesting aspect of the Satyricon. The opus in question is surely not the whole of Encolpius' narrative, but the oratio he has just addressed to his Hampden: he behaved like an iambographer. Now where have we met before this sort of surrogate artist in the text? Niall Rudd has produced a very useful translation of B*Juvenal, the Satires,' based on Courtney's Rome text of 1984 and with an introduction and notes by William Barr. Juvenal is one of the hardest Latin authors to translate, because of the density of his use of the referential code. Green in his translation tried to get around this by 'silent glosses' and 'functional substitutes' but Rudd rightly objects to the intrusion this represents. Since he accepts - depressingly but realistically - that 'most of its users will probably be students reading Juvenal as part of an academic course' (p. xxxiv) his own version is more literal, and is indeed better suited both for use as a crib and for Classics in translation courses. But Rudd is not a fan of the very literal meta- phrase endorsed by Charles Martindale and recently put into practice by Guy Lee: he seeks a Drydenesque middle ground. I know that for many people this is exactly what a translator ought to do, and Rudd's version is a good example of the genre. But for me it also shows the flaws in this whole tradition. Rudd rightly again observes that Juvenal is not a vulgar writer, and he avoids excessive colloquialism, but the elevation of Juvenal's style (and thus the violent effects when vulgarisms do come in) simply evaporates. Here is the opening of 10: In all the countries that stretch from Cadiz across to the Ganges and the lands of dawn, how few are the people who manage to tell genuine blessings from those of a very dif- ferent order, dispelling the mists of error! For when do we have good grounds for our fears or desires? What idea proves so inspired that you can not regret your attempt to carry it out, and its realization?</page><page sequence="17">96 SUBJECT REVIEWS It's a bit - well, boring, isn't it? I've cheated - Rudd sets his version out as verse, with a loose but quite attractive six-beat line to imitate the hexameter, and the line breaks make the reader react differently (e.g. there's a break after 'Ganges' which produces a snappier first line). But the tedium is undeniable: 'lands of dawn' for Auroram is a banalization, 'genuine blessings' for vera bona loses the link to the discourse of moral philosophy and sets up an unfortunate intertextual dialogue with Patience Strong, and 'your attempt to carry it out, and its realization' for conatus . . . votique peracti looks like an excerpt from a manual on how to be a tactful appraiser. Of course, when one tries to have a go oneself, one realizes how difficult it is: reviewers of verse translations should always be prepared to give their own versions but mine was so dire that I had to give up (what can one do with illis multum diversa?) The trouble with aurea mediocritas, however, is that it doesn't offend: and whatever else a version of Juvenal does, it ought to get up one's nose. The same problem affects the balanced tones of the (useful, helpful, etc., etc.) introduction by Barr. Here he is, for instance, on Satire 6 (p. xxii): This is one of Juvenal's most striking satires, though it is difficult to discern his motive in writing it. It can most obviously be criticized on the score of gross over-statement and his customary tendency to blind himself to anything that does not support his thesis. Happy marriages and good wives, even heroic wives, are not unknown in the literature of that period, but Juvenal's techniques of argumentation are not so strong that he could afford to mention them without irreparable damage to his case. Note- worthy too is his Stoic-like failure to differentiate between the degrees of enormity in the actions perpetrated by his women. There is a difference between, say, immorality and pretensions to scholarship, though one is made to pose as great a threat to marital comfort and happiness as the other ... (One wonders what Housman would have said about the last remark.) Barr is honest here, and reasonable: better this muted criticism than simple 60s celebration of talking dirty. But how about a little rage? It is so easy to slip into talking about 'happy marriages and good wives' or homosexuality as a 'perversion' (p. xix), and thus into moral compromise. The Rudd/Barr volume is in many ways an excellent example of mainstream classical trans- lation, but it just shows how much gets left out in that tradition. What might replace it is another question: but perhaps the format tried in some of the old Bohn volumes of a literal metaphrase plus a poetic version ('Lucretius in prose by Watson, in verse by Good'), with an introduction modelled on Viz rather than the minutes of the General Synod. Finally, another volume of B**Aufstieg und Niedergang der romischen Welt. 8 33.3, like 32.2 and 32.4, is devoted exclusively to Tacitus. The major bibliography, another chalcenteric effort by Werner Suerbaum and his band, is in 32.2: this contains 12 studies on the Histories (2), Agricola (4), Germania (3), and Dialogus (2), plus a general article on the textual tradition by F. Romer (pp. 2299-39). Six are in German, one in French, and five in English (K. Wel- lesley, 'Tacitus, "Histories": a Textual Survey 1939-1989' - actually a discussion of 'a few cruces ... which have evoked comment in the period under review' [p. 1680: try that trick in the High Street and the local Weights and Measures would soon have you in], C.

Most of the pieces are Forschungsberichte, and this volume falls into the 'useful' class of ANR W offerings, though the usual flaws are not absent: the</page><page sequence="18">SUBJECT REVIEWS 97 'Interim Report' (sic) on the Agricola had seen off two distinguished classicists before reach- ing D. B. Saddington and L. J. F. Keppie, who seem to have managed to get in stuff that will only be five years out of date when anyone reads this, and part of A. A. Lund's (excellent) survey of scholarship on the Germania is printed at the end of the volume 'infolge eines technischen Fehlers des Verlages' (p. 2222: remember this when twits like Corelli Barnet drone on about German efficiency). But rather than hypocritically moaning about the absurdity of ANR W while cradling the precious volume lovingly in my arms and waving it at my colleagues like an Arsenal supporter's dosh-crammed wallet ('That - oh yes, got it for free.. .'), let me use it for a different sermon. The international nature of classical studies is one of its great strengths, but with the seemingly endless expansion of publications it has put a great strain on our existing bibliographical tools. L'Annee Philologique, for all the energy and organization of the wonderful Mmme Ernst, is now inevitably several years in arrears, and the summaries that it has encouraged journals and authors to offer are only sporadically provided and too brief to be really useful (we need something like a file-card's worth: see e.g. Lund's summaries in this volume of ANR W). For more recent material one has to rely on Gnomon and the Bolletino di Studi Latini but their coverage is very partial. The answer has to lie in a move to electronic dissemination, but while Classics has been a pioneer in the pro- vision of machine-readable texts, it lags behind in bibliography. A start is being made on existing material by the US based Database of Classical Bibliography which aims to get some 204,000 bibliographical records from L'Annee Philologique volumes 48-5 9 out on CDRom by September 1993 (it just needs to raise $100,000 of private money to match its NEH funds ... : see the Autumn 1991 issue of the American Philological Association Newsletter). To see what a difference this will make, try the electronic version of the MLA Bibliography. But for current bibliography, we really need an online depository to which people could send abstracts and retrieve the latest and hottest. There have been some interesting developments in electronic publishing in Classics, like the CONTEX and IOUDAIOS discussion lists and the excellent Bryn Mawr Classical Review, which disseminates high-quality and timely reviews free to electronic subscribers. The technology is all available; we just need the organization (which will inevitably most plausibly come from the US). How about it, America? DON FOWLER NOTES 1.

Greek History The most innovative and exciting of the present batch lays bare the desperately precarious economic life of the unit which stood at the very centre of the Greek world, the peasant household.' Gallant is at home with both ancient evidence and comparative material. Since many different disciplines are pressed into service, few readers will find their way through them as easily as the author; but such hard work as is required is well worth the effort. The household is not viewed as a static unit, but traced through its own life cycle as the numbers of both mouths to feed and pairs of hands to work increased or diminished: what it was to earn food from the Greek soil has never been so realistically shown. There is a rich social dimension too: families could survive in the all too frequent hard times because they helped each other or, more dangerously, became obliged to patrons. Some of this material is handled in an equally impressive but far less accessible way by Sallares in a book which can- not, in the absence of a review copy, be discussed here.2 The title of Athens from Cleis- thenes to Pericles3 is more comprehensive than its content. Its four chapters begin with Athens, Pericles, and the Alcmeonids: it is assumed that Pericles took his maternal Alc- meonid inheritance (traced as far back as the Cylon affair) seriously. Despite a claim that the purpose of the chapter on Imperialism is 'neither to be moralistic nor to assume the role of judge', it concludes 'we admire the dynamism... but deplore the hybris'; the answer to the question 'how could [the Athenians] have justified the naked egotism implicit in our recon- struction?' is 'a bias against Asiatic Greeks'. There is nothing quite like this in either the chapter on Democracy or that on Athens and Sparta; but they both depend in different ways on the view taken of the Athenian Empire, and there is an old-fashioned feel to the book which may reveal its origin as a manuscript set on one side 'some time ago' by Fornara. A volume over 300 pages long might be expected to tell you all you ever wanted to know about Theopompus;4 but this volume is designed to be used alongside both Jacoby and W. R. Connor, Theopompus and Fifth Century Athens. Otherwise it is very full: Theopompus' style, works, and interests are discussed, and there are translations of the testimonia and fragments and an analytical index of proper names in the latter. A recent return to the view that the Oxyrhynchus Historian is Theopompus is rightly rejected. It is not Shrimpton's fault if he (and we) cannot quite grasp Theopompus' achievement. His bitter judgements and moralizing tone are clear. For the rest, what Theopompus approved would give excellent clues - though it is doubtful, given his talent for abuse, if he also approved the opposite of everything he attacked; but there is wretchedly little evidence. Shrimpton makes a good case that Theopompus approved not only the fact but also the means of Demosthenes' resistance to Philip; but the reasons cannot - except very broadly - be recovered. To reconstruct all we can know of an author of whom we can know so little is a strictly limited gain. It is risky for a book on neutrality in the Greek world to admit that the Greeks did not have a word for it; but Bauslaugh still defends his subject well.5 He examines the terminology and the origins of the concept and summarizes what it meant in practice before searching for signs of it in an account of Greek history to 338 B.C. Some</page><page sequence="20">SUBJECT REVIEWS 99 claims for neutrality are made when others might suggest insignificance (Achaea in the Peloponnesian War), caution or defeatism (or worse: Argos in 480/79). Neutrality for smaller states was often in the interests of great powers themselves: Philip's need c. 340 was 'not for more allies but simply for fewer opponents'. At worst, neutrality was barely exploited for positive purposes until the mid-360s, when some lesser powers secured from both Sparta and Thebes recognition of their neutrality, and a welcome rest from conflict. Both here and elsewhere the book takes little account (despite a few entries in bibliography and footnotes) of anything published much after 1980; an infuriating system of cross- referencing and a bibliography divided into four sections make it unnecessarily difficult to use. Hansen's work on Athenian democracy is right up to date:6 he has written huge amounts about it, and his views in this convenient form are very welcome. A survey of the evidence, summary history of the constitution to 403, and brief remarks on ideology are followed by eight descriptive chapters: the People of Athens, Assembly, Laws and the Nomothetai, People's Court, Magistrates (not treated in detail), Council of Five Hundred, Political Leaders, and Council of the Areopagus. The final account of the main features of Athenian democracy shows one of Hansen's great merits throughout: he does not merely describe, but illuminates by modern parallel and contrast. The main part of the book is very tightly packed, but it is usually possible to tell where the conclusions are controversial, if not always why the author holds them. The period c. 355-322 is concentrated upon because we know more about it than any other; more systematic attention might have been paid to what we can (or cannot) know of how different things were in the second half of the fifth century. Hansen perhaps exaggerates the effect of the real differences between the late fifth and fourth centuries when he argues that there was a conscious shift towards a more 'moderate' democracy in 403/2, and that a similar trend continued later. This work is full of informa- tion; it will stimulate discussion and encourage understanding too. Nomos,7 appro- priately dedicated to the memory of Moses Finley, is an eloquent plea by example for study of Athenian law firmly in the context of Athenian society. The quality is uniformly high; all papers deserve mention, but there is space for only three. Osborne identifies sykophants as a vital component of democracy, and Harvey defends the traditional hostile assessment; there is room for compromise if emphasis is given to Harvey's own point that we owe all our evidence to the wealthy whom sykophants attacked. Perhaps the paper with the widest appeal is Cohen's on the social context of adultery: it is not much about law, or even adultery, but argues for a much wider range of activity outside the oikos for women than is usually admitted; it will be required reading for anyone interested in women in Athens. A second collection of essays follows the editor's own The Western Way of War, and has much the same interest in the grim realities of hoplite warfare;' indeed, there is some sense of old helmet in the new book, which contains one paper, brief introduction and epilogue by the editor, and 8 other papers. Nuances and new details are sometimes added: those of interest outside the military sphere include the relationship between sacrifice before battle and other sacrifices (Jameson) and the responsibility of hoplites for roads which can still be seen (Ober). It is useful to have clear, authoritative accounts, especially from Anderson and Lazenby, of particular aspects; but the book as a whole does not repre- sent a major advance in our understanding of the stings of war.

Roman History Aris &amp; Phillips have provided another useful student edition of a historical text, Book 36 of Livy, with a (fairly literal) translation and commentary by P. G. Walsh.' The 29 pages of the Latin text are still a reasonable assignment for A-level or university syllabuses. The book covers 191 B.C., the first year of Rome's war against the Seleucid ruler Antiochus the Great - a war whose consequences were at least as momentous as those of the wars against the Carthaginians, since it destroyed the power of the major near eastern monarchy, thus making the integration of virtually all the Hellenistic world into the Roman empire inevit- able. While the material in this book does not cover the decisive battle of Magnesia in 190, there is a good speech (by Hannibal) and a good battle (Thermopylae), as well as 'annalistic' material. The notes combine the latest historical scholarship with the help which the sixth- former will need to understand the text. If basic facts could be divorced from histori- cal explanation and interpretation, then catalogues would indeed be 'invaluable reference works', as claimed for Michael C. Alexander's compendium of the 391 known trials, mainly criminal, which took place at Rome in the century between the establishment of the first quaestio perpetua and Caesar.2 The information is presented in list form: date, charge, defendant, advocate, prosecutor, witness, outcome (and the computer has produced nine separate indexes of these categories). No information is given about political context - indeed, the minimal bibliographical information given is explicitly limited to 'only those works which pertain to the formal and legal aspects of the trial'; the reader's attention is drawn to problems of interpretation by the simple expedient of using a '?' for the 'many pieces of information which represent guesses'; but the reader is told to go elsewhere for elucidation. Alexander's intention may best be stated in his own words: 'In the absence of extant court records, such as the sort most scholars of legal history have at their disposal, Roman historians can profit from this distillation of what we actually know [sic] about each trial. This work serves as a basis for further research in legal or political history' (p. xiv). Good luck to the researcher. And congratulations to the Campus Research Board of the University of Illinois/Chicago for having the funds to support this publication. Alex- ander explicitly appeals to T. R. S. Broughton's magisterial handbook, The Magistrates of the</page><page sequence="22">SUBJECT REVIEWS 101 Roman Republic, as a model for what in itself may not be history, but may be the raw material for history. Forty years on, Broughton has produced a compendium of Romans who lost elections in the period 218 to 44 B.C.3 Here too we simply have a collection of 'facts', or rather references, though the reader is sometimes made aware of interpretative problems. The entries are so concise that they are not always easy to understand. The surviv- ing 'archive' is by no means typical (there is virtually nothing on rejected candidates for the lower magistracies, and Broughton estimates that even for the consulship, there were twelve times as many rejects as those whose names we know). Broughton rightly points out that there are major implications for our understanding of the value-system of Roman public life. But the evidence is minute: there are only a few references to (what the ancient sources thought were) the reasons why particular candidates were rejected - severitas (once), failure to provide spectacles (several times), and intrigue by other elite politicians (fre- quently). Response to market demand for biographies of Roman emperors continues unabated. Much of Arther Ferrill's life of Caligula4 is a paraphrase of Tacitus and Suetonius (most of the 529 notes give references to the original sources), and Ferrill pulls no punches in railing against those who question the authentic truth of the anecdotes they relate, e.g., about sexual habits ('The excesses of modern scholarship [in rejecting such anecdotes] are sometimes virtually staggering', p. 85). Although there are occasional suggestions that 'some of these stories [about Caligula's cruelty] are untrue or greatly exaggerated' (p. 115), the reader is carefully shielded from awareness of similar anecdotes told about other tyrant figures, or indeed from any historiographical problems at all. I considered A. A. Barrett's account of the life of Caligula conservative (Greece &amp; Rome 37 [1990], 247); Ferrill thinks it goes too far in rehabilitating Caligula. He does not hesitate to employ words like folly, mad- ness, and megalomania, and the liberal use of evaluative adjectives makes the book exciting reading, ideal for the teenager or for the general reader who for some reason cannot be per- suaded to read the same material in Tacitus or Suetonius. It is beautifully pro- duced. The long-awaited second part of Thomas Mitchell's biography of Cicero5 is at a quite different level, though it shares some of the same features - a vivid narrative for which it is felt that each assertion ('fact'?) has to be legitimated by reference to original sources (in this case revealing a Latinist's very detailed knowledge of those sources), and the final summary judgement of the subject as a person, apparently irresistible to biographers. The blurb claims that no previous biography of Cicero brings together 'a detailed and fully documented account of Cicero's life, his literary and philosophical works, and their political background. This ... is the first book to achieve this goal.' In fact, most of this second volume comprises a narrative of Cicero's political career after 63 B.C.; the pages devoted to how his private (and financial) affairs developed are few. Mitchell's treatment of Cicero's speeches and letters reveals the real understanding of political activity one expects from a Provost of Trinity College, Dublin: some of these documents are handled as more than just 'evidence' for Cicero's public life, but as themselves moves in the political game, attempts by Cicero to influence other political actors. On the other hand Cicero's rhetorical and philo- sophical oeuvre is presented primarily as something he turned to when he couldn't play politics as he wished; Mitchell is not inclined to discuss their relationship either to Cicero's standing as a statesman, or to the wider 'crisis' of the Italian political system. Instead, he chooses to use this material for two discussions of the value-systems in Cicero's writings, and of their relationship to Roman political reality (chapter 1, 'The Political Ideas Behind the Policies of 63', and pp. 205-218, on Cicero's views of empire and of the role of a pro- vincial governor). One might have constructed other ways of overcoming the dichotomy of</page><page sequence="23">102 SUBJECT REVIEWS Cicero as politician and as intellectual (see my remarks on Ch. Habicht's Cicero the Politi- cian in Greece &amp; Rome 37 [1990], 246), but students will find this both readable and reli- able. Elizabeth Rawson's immense scholarship made her the acknowledged expert on the culture of Italy, popular as well as intellectual, in the Ciceronian period. Apart from her extremely readable Cicero (1975), she will be remembered for her books on The Spartan Tradition in European Thought (1969) and on Intellectual Life in the Late Roman Republic (1985). Her sudden death in 1988 at the age of 54 prevented her from producing a synthesis of her research. That research was represented by 31 articles from the 1970s and '80s, now republished by Oxford (all newly typeset rather than photomechanically reproduced, as financial constraints so often require nowadays).6 While some originally appeared in rela- tively accessible journals, some others will have been less so for at least some readers of Greece &amp; Rome (Phoenix, Athenaeum, Liverpool Classical Monthly), and some were con- tributions to collections of papers (Studies in Roman Property, Past Perspectives, Homo Viator, Staat und Staatlichkeit). Their inclusion in one volume makes clear the range of Rawson's scholarship, from Late Republican historiography and antiquarianism to ques- tions of social and political history (the clientelae of the Claudii, the motives for Crassus' invasion of Parthia). Of particular interest are her studies of the place of ludi (chariot-races and theatre) in Roman cultural life. Some conclusions - such as the identity of the Athenian hoplite-general in 53/52 B.C. - are admittedly 'not a very earth-shaking discovery, but one never knows what may come in useful' (p. 453). Food for Rome,7 by a leading Dutch expert on Late Roman law, is not for those who think that the future of ancient history lies in the study of the culture of feasting or of the moral symbolism of eating fish, etc. It is an analysis of the evidence provided by the Theodosian Code and the Digest of how grain and other bulk foodstuffs reached the consumer in the city of Rome. Emperors, in their capacity as patrons of the plebs frumentaria, had to oversee the transportatign and distribution of grain to their clients. In this capacity they were acting as private persons, and private law contracts replaced the republican publicani's public law redempturae. But this is one of those areas where the imperial system made the boundaries between public and private increas- ingly fuzzy. From early in the second century A.D., importers were grouped in corpora and given immunity from other obligations; Sirks makes it clear that these were not 'guilds' or professional associations of ships' captains, but more akin to (private) companies of wealthy individuals who invested their capital in the transportation business in order to minimize tax obligations elsewhere. Inscriptions show that from the early third century, the obligation to provide this munus became hereditary in a number of provinces (akin to the obligation on heirs to continue paying taxes on land). None of this made the collegia public organizations. Yet the emperor's representatives - the Urban Prefect and the praefectus annonae - were public officials, and they had to supervise the functioning of the collegia of shipowners and bakers responsible for getting the food to the consumer. These officials consequently pro- duced regulations, some of which found their way into the Late Roman law codes. In the past, A. H. M.Jones and others assumed that what was known about the food supply implied similar controls over other professions, resulting in a picture of late antiquity as a static, rigidly enforced system ('Zwangsstaat' or 'caste system'). Sirks looks at a number of other interesting topics, including the land (praedia) assigned for the use of corpora navicularia, and the entirely different (occupational) corpora responsible for transporting foodstuffs from Portus to Rome, and processing them there (ch. 9-10). Sirk's study is based on legal minutiae, but its conclusions give a much wider insight into how the economy of the city of Rome actually worked. In contrast, a theoretical study by an Australian sociologist of</page><page sequence="24">SUBJECT REVIEWS 103 the relevance of Max Weber's concept of 'capitalism' to antiquity.8 The purpose of such study is explicitly advertised as 'most useful in constructing a theory of modern capitalism' (p. 10), reminding the reviewer of the heady days of the 1960s. Part I is an analysis of how Weber's views on the role of 'capitalism' in antiquity developed over time, partly because he wanted to reconcile the 'primitivist' and 'advanced' models of the ancient economy of Biicher and Meyer, resulting in Weber's developing the important distinction between 'political capitalism' and 'market capitalism'. Part III tries to interpret some aspects of Roman history, and late antiquity in particular, in terms of that distinction. This is interesting, but flawed by undue reliance on interpretations produced a generation or more ago (A. H. M. Jones again): no history undergraduate today would be allowed to get away with Love's picture of late antiquity, with 'a caste-like ordering of society' (p. 240), and of transition to a 'feudal system' (p. 244). Part II examines particular aspects of the ancient economy: household management, slavery, trade, and publicani. Here Love's reliance on secondary literature rather than the original sources, or languages, is particularly striking. (Misprints like popularii, sodali, etc. suggest that Love has not been well-served by readers or copy-editors.) One would have thought that Perry Anderson's widely read Passages from Antiquity to Feudalism (1974) might have served as a warning of how easy it is for sociologists to construct their models on the shifting sand of misunderstood interpretations of the evidence by scholars in other disciplines addressing quite different issues. For instance, I could find no references either to Claude Nicolet's work or to the Settefinestre excavations in Love's discussion of the equestrians as entrepreneurs; and he holds to the thesis that the equestrian ordo was a 'middle class' separate from, and opposed to, the Senate. A glance through Cicero's letters might have led Love to revise the idea that senators found 'business activity beneath them' (pp. 72 ff.). I do not intend these comments as criticism of sociologists, but as a plea for more interdisciplinary dialogue. The book contains many useful insights, especially on the marked contrast between the maximizing of profits in antiquity by exploiting the opportunities provided by the exercise of political power, and the quite different maximizing of profits by exploiting market opportunities in Western Europe from the seventeenth century on.

Archaeology and Art The Early Bronze Age culture of the Cyclades continues to exert its attractions to scholars, laymen, collectors, and museum directors. In 1990 an exhibition was arranged in the Museum of Cycladic Art in Athens; material was gathered from various museums, particu- larly the Athens National Museum, and the aim of the display was to highlight the place of the island of Naxos in the life of the third millennium. The catalogue, BCycladic Culture: Naxos in the 3rd Millennium BC,' is an excellent publication, though overinked in places and already showing a weakness in the binding. The emphasis of the exhibition and of the catalogue was not on aesthetics but on the more general evidence for the development of Cycladic culture. So, as well as the figurines which we tend to regard as the hallmark of that phase of the Bronze Age, more basic objects such as saws, chisels, spindle whorls, and spear- heads are given prominence, and the arrangement of the material centred on such subjects as daily life, the sea, death, music and dance, and religion. The introductory paragraphs set the artefacts in context by relating them to find spots (where known) and to the general picture of life on the island that excavations have illuminated. Another period that acts like a magnet is the Greek Dark Ages, but less perhaps for the layman, more for the scholar who wishes to erect theory to explain that difficult gap between the end of the Bronze Age and the rise of the polis. Ian Morris's recent Burial and Ancient Society (1987) is now followed in the same series by James Whitley's B**Style and Society in Dark Age Greece: the Changing Face of a Pre-literate Society 1100- 700 BC,2 'embarassing to both of us', says Whitley, as his Cambridge thesis on which this book is based had a wider scope, whereas the book is, like Morris's, mainly concerned with Athens. Whitley's aim is summed up near the end of the book: 'to show how a detailed archaeological examination of graves and their contents can be combined with an art-historical interest in stylistic change to produce a viable social history' (p. 197). The detailed examination involves proposing theoretical perspectives and using CLUSTAN and FACTOR analysis to produce a 'wealth scale' for each grave based on the nature and elaborateness of the contents. Whitley is anxious to remove the arbitrary, the impressionistic, and the personal from his picture. The long chapter 5 takes us through the conventional divisions from Sub-Mycenaean to Late Geometric II, to show that the face of the Dark Ages was constantly changing. We are taken from 'big man' or 'unstable' societies to the more stable that were on the road to polis organizations. This is a complex book, rather repetitious, as Whitley doesn't want us to lose our way in the dark; it is, however, one that cannot be ignored. The Dark Ages are likely to stay in the news, as their duration, if not their very existence, is now being ques- tioned. The traditional approach to Greek art of the historical period demands a study of the fragmentary material remains alongside the documentary sources. With less widespread knowledge of the ancient languages students must depend more on translations of the relevant written evidence. Twenty-five years ago J. J. Pollitt published a useful selec- tion of such sources for Greek art; he has now revised and enlarged it as B* The Art ofAncient Greece. Sources and Documents. 3 The selection of translated passages (literary, lexicographi- cal, inscriptional) takes us from the Bronze Age (Pollitt includes two Linear B tablets for starters) down to the end of Hellenistic. The new edition is an improvement on its illustrious</page><page sequence="26">SUBJECT REVIEWS 105 predecessor, as the author has reorganized the selection and added a bibliography. The media of sculpture, painting, architecture, and decorative arts are now treated separately, whereas in the earlier edition the three last categories tended to be tail-pieces to the sculp- ture entries in each period. The bibliography is a most helpful addition, full and well- arranged, and it directs the student to the latest and most helpful articles. As before, Pollitt is not content simply to let the passages speak for themselves; to work properly, the passages need oiling, and Pollitt provides the necessary drops of lubricant. The Elder Pliny naturally bulks large in Pollitt's selection of passages. Out of the thirty-seven books of the Natural History only the last five are of interest for art-history. For good or ill, Pliny has always been a major source in the approach to ancient art, even though, as Pollitt points out, the art sections 'are really digressions from more basic subjects'.Jacob Isager's BPliny on Art and Society: the Elder Pliny's Chapters on the History ofArt4 seeks to elucidate Pliny's refer- ences to and treatment of art in the context of the society in which and for which he was writing. We are given a general background setting for his work with a discussion of the preface (with its significant dedication to Titus), the relation of man and nature, and the abuse of nature that Pliny constantly stresses. 'Pliny's criticism of Man's insatiable search (auaritia) for gold and silver, for marble and precious stones, and his uncontrolled uses of them (luxuria), constitutes a theme that is frequently dealt with in chapters on art history as well as elsewhere in other contexts of the Natural History' (p. 52). Isager guides us through the sections on gold and silver (33), bronze (34), painting (35), marble art and architecture (36), and gems (37). As the author points out, 'It is a recurring feature that use and abuse of art are juxtaposed, and the examples of the former belong as a rule to the past, while abuse most often is illustrated by persons from Pliny's own time' (p. 113). Isager's book is a salutary reminder that in dealing with written sources, no references can be taken at face- value: social and political contexts must be taken into account. The book is beautifully produced and every passage of Pliny is quoted in English in the text with the Latin in the notes at the bottom of the page - how civilized. There are no illustrations. One Greek sculptor whose work, personality, and aims depend to a great extent on the written evidence is Polykleitos of Argos; his posthumous reputation was higher than most, and it is inevitable that in the absence of original works from his hand his ghost should be tracked down through the copies and adaptations that his popularity created. He has always been a figure that has attracted German interest, and a major exhibition of material connected with him was held in the Frankfurt Liebieghaus in late 1990/early 1991. The 'book of the exhibition', BPolyklet, der Bildhauer der griechischen Klassik,s contains a catalogue of the 200 or so pieces on display. As there are no originals to put on view, the items in the exhibition are a collection of small scale pieces that set Argive sculpture in a tradition (shield band, small bronzes, gems) and more substantial statuary that mirrors, reflects, or distorts Polykleitan works. All are illustrated alongside the descriptive entries. But the volume has much more to offer: the catalogue is preceded by 500 pages of essays that deal with all aspects of the man, his work, his influence, etc., illustrated with photographs of material not on view in the exhibition. Although scholars are now less certain that the later 'copies' give us even the general appearance of the statues, the attraction of the big names is alive and well. This volume will take its place as a landmark in Polykleitan studies. Recently there has been a revival of interest in Victorian paintings on Classical themes; one might instance Christopher Wood's Olympian Dreamers with its luscious fantasies from the brush of Lord Leighton, Burne-Jones, Waterhouse, etc. Amongst the most famous is Sir Lawrence Alma Tadema with his scenes of elegantly draped (and undraped) females, blue seas, and marble</page><page sequence="27">106 SUBJECT REVIEWS surrounds - Hollywood avant la lettre. A few of his paintings are included (in colour) in Richard Tomlinson's B The Athens of Alma Tadema,6 but the author's purpose is more archaeological and prosaic than aesthetic and imaginative. The Library of Birmingham University holds an archive of prints that belonged to Alma Tadema, built up from 1870 onwards when he was in London. Tomlinson has put together a selection centred on Athens, with a recreation of Athens in the 1870s and brief biographies of the photographers (the best known being Stillman). The photographs themselves are both tributes to the skill of the professionals of that time and evocative records of an Athens long gone: the Frankish tower on the Acropolis, a wooden hut in the Dionysos theatre, but above all open space and solitude. The author's eagle eye is able to pick out significant details and can show that one photograph of a slab from the Parthenon frieze boasts a corner with drapery that is missing today. Alma Tadema's well-known 'Pheidias and the Parthenon' shows what a study of the Elgin marbles and a reading of ideas of the day could do - it is remarkably authentic. How fortunate that his photographs did not fetter his imagination too much, or we should have been denied those entrancing fantasies that tell us so much of Victorian England, if not of classical Greece. Metrology is an exact and an exacting study. Jos de Waele's B** The Propylaia of the Akropolis in Athens: the Project ofMnesikles7 consists to a large degree of lists of detailed measurements of slabs, blocks, interaxial widths, etc. The Propylaea, more than most classical buildings, is a tantalizing construction that has attracted many scholars to attempt to tease out the principles on which it was designed, to trace the original plan, and to track down the alterations that are thought to have been forced upon the architect by religious intransigence. de Waele summarizes previous attempts to explain the mathemati- cal rationale behind the building and finds that they all fail because 'they do not yield a complete analysis of the structure in all its parts' and 'they do not tally with construction practice as known to us through building inscriptions' (p. 17). What de Waele has set out to do is to infer the unit of measurement from the building itself, and not accept a unit from somewhere else - as he says, 'The correct unit of measurement constitutes the key to the design of the building. If the wrong key is used, the entrance to this building remains closed' (p. 63). de Waele postulates a variable foot of measurement and sees the layout in multiples of seven. With a choice between great architect and chaotic planner, de Waele characterizes Mnesikles as the planner 'who managed to unify the various parts of the Propylaia in clear proportions and at the same time solved the problem of the column arrangement of the east and west halls of the central building in a most satisfactory manner' (p. 64). The detailed architectural drawings are superb; Mnesikles would have been proud of them. When the British Academy joins forces with the British School in Jerusalem and the British Institute at Amman, one can expect something exceptional, and Judith McKenzie's B** The Architecture ofPetra8 does not belie our expectations. The book is both a basic presentation of the architecture of the site and a revolutionary study of the dating. In fact, the title of the work conceals some of the main thrust of the volume. McKenzie shows that a study of the architecture of Petra demands a study also of Ptolemaic sites, however poorly preserved in comparison with Petra, and above all of the Saudi-Arabian site of Medain Saleh. It is the signed and dated Nabataean tombs at this last site that provide the key to the relative dating of the Petra buildings and architectural decoration. Rather than tracing a development from simple to complex in the shape of mouldings, capitals, etc., McKenzie sees that the direction is the very reverse - the most complex are the earliest with imported craftsmen bringing in ideas, and later the local craftsmen simplified the more elaborate designs they attempted to copy. We are treated to a detailed catalogue of the monuments of Petra and a description of</page><page sequence="28">SUBJECT REVIEWS 107 the city and the tombs. The illustrations are copious and rich, beginning with the dated sequence at Medain Saleh, continuing with 150 plates on Petra, and finishing with illustra- tions of the architecture of Alexandria and Ptolemais and a large selection of the 2nd style Pompeian architectural wall paintings that owed their inspiration to Hellenistic architec- ture. The book is a joy, well laid out, handsomely illustrated, taking a welcome new look at the subject of Petra. 'Rose-red', yes; 'half as old as Time', that just dodges the problem. To tackle Roman art within the format of the British Museum 'blue' series was a bold decision, but in the capable hands of Susan Walker, B*Roman Art9 proves an attractive introduction to the British Museum collections and to the subject as a whole. Naturally within the small ration of pages that the series imposes, this is no history of Roman art, more a personal view, a highlighting of topics that the author sees as leading themes. She isolates four main subjects: the influence of Greek ideas and craftsmanship used in the Roman context of display; Roman portraits with their political motivation and visual codes; public art, whether in city, sanctuary, cemetery, or camp; and finally the private back- ground in the home. These subjects allow the author to include such material from the British Museum as copies of Greek work, the magnificent series of portraits, including some from the Coins and Medals Department, the wall paintings and pottery, silver and glassware. As usual in this series, the design of the book and the quality of the reproductions is first class, and yet again the illustration that graces the contents page (an 18th-century watercolour of the Colosseum) is singularly apt and heartbreakingly evocative of a Rome now lost. By contrast, Nancy H. and Andrew Ramage's B* The Cambridge Illustrated History of Roman Art,1' whilst a worthy work, has a rather jaded appearance. At one time general books on Roman art were hard to come by; the last generation has produced at least a dozen that are available in English. The Ramages's format is predictable: early years (however defined, with the Etruscans taking the lion's share), the Roman Republic, and then the straightforward march through ten chapters of emperors, finishing with the dynasty of Constantine. Certainly, the subject is made approachable, the maps are clear, the illustra- tions (mainly the tried and tested) are large and striking. This is a book for students and beginners, but it is sad that it was felt that the conventional arrangement had to be retained. It may be that in the States alternative handbooks are not available or too expensive; this is not true here, and therefore it is unfortunate that the CUP should choose to advertise the volume as a local, rather than a transatlantic product. In 1988 Guy de la Bedoyere put together an excellent volume on the finds of Roman Britain. He now in quick succession furnishes us with B* The Buildings of Roman Britain. " It has the same format and provides a clear and comprehensive synthesis with photographs and reconstructions drawn by the author. de la Bedoyere is interested in how the buildings were constructed and he is down to earth in his view of surveyors, architects, and 'suck-it-and-see' builders (p. 15). His main chapters are arranged to cover military and public buildings, houses and sacred sites, and the miscellaneous others such as mills, ovens, and tombs. The whole work is buttressed by explanations of the differences between axonometric and isometric drawings, by the inscrip- tions that refer to specific buildings, and by the sites the author recommends. The biblio- graphy is full and well-arranged with helpful four-figure National Grid references for the sites. Besides the plans, elevations, and drawn reconstructions, the author treats us to coloured paintings of the major buildings in their settings (Hadrian's Wall, Verulamium, Littlecote [surely reversed?], Bath, etc.). His water-colour of the bridge across the Irthing at Willowford suggests that what the art world has lost, the world of archaeology has gained. Graham Webster's association with Batsford has been a fruitful one, so it is</page><page sequence="29">108 SUBJECT REVIEWS very apt that, as he nears his 80th year, Webster should have a selection of his large output issued in book form by his publisher; it bears the title BArchaeologist at Large. 12 The pieces he has selected are the more accessible ones, stretching back over the past 40 years, with a few unpublished ones. This is a volume more for the general reader than for the scholar - the range goes from the Cheshire Cat to colour symbolism, from Lady Godiva to the function of the Chedworth 'villa'. It is good to see an account (part of an unfinished auto- biography) of the Great Casterton Summer School of the 1950s with which Webster was connected and where he learned 'never to allow ideas to become rooted in the mind' (p. 121) and where he 'began to understand how archaeologists could be led into serious error if they decided in advance what they were going to find' (p. 122). Let us hope that the auto- biography will be finished and that Batsford will publish it. Finally, a book that takes the classical archaeologist and student of Greek and Roman history on a journey far outside the classical embrace. It is the usual practice for books to be sent for review by the pub- lishers, and they are therefore well within the field of classical archaeology and art or in that tradition. Occasionally it is necessary to solicit a book which might be thought to lie on the margins. BArchaeology: Theories, Methods and Practice13 by Colin Renfrew and Paul Bahn touches the world of Greece and Rome here and there: the regional survey of Melos, air photography and excavation in Roman Britain, the distribution of Roman amphorae, identifying individual artists in Greece, the Ka? shipwreck, etc. But all these items are fitted into a jigsaw that has the whole world and all time as its canvas. The book is an invigorating overview of the discipline of archaeology, magisterially ordered and full of intellectual nourishment. As we know, because of its traditions and the nature and amount of the evidence that it commands, classical (particularly Greek) archaeology has found it difficult to join in the revolutions that have stirred other areas of the discipline over the past generation. For some, this is a cause for shame; for others, the new archaeologies have nothing to say to classicists. I defy anyone to read Renfrew and Bahn's book and not be stirred into thinking that some, if not all, of the new approaches are worth adopting and adapting in any archaeological study of the classical world.

Philosophy The second volume in the Cambridge University Press series Companions to Ancient Thought, BPsychology,' edited by Stephen Everson, is even better than the first (on epistemology, reviewed G&amp;R 38 [1991], 111). A substantial and very useful introduction outlines the scope of the work, and summarizes the nine essays which follow (all of them published here for the first time). I suppose that one might complain that the authors have not really made up their minds as to whether the subject of the volume is the psyche, ancient views on the mind, or the prehistory of modern psychology, but that would be quibbling. All of the essays are interesting, and have something to say (especially perhaps Sabina Lovibond on Plato's theory of the mind, and Christopher Gill on the concept of the person). Like its predecessor, this volume is intended to be an introduction to ancient philosophy for philosophy undergraduates, and in this it is probably more successful. At any rate it succeeds in being less impenetrable to non-philosophers. William Jordan's BAncient Concepts of Philosophy2 similarly announces itself as a book designed for first- and second-year under- graduates, but it will surely be of interest to a much wider readership. The book sets out to answer the question of what the ancients meant by philosophy, but in fact tends to drift in the direction of a general history of ancient philosophy, going off from time to time (quite profitably) on tangents to deal with general issues. One could complain that it rambles a bit, but that would be churlish, because this is a first-rate, clearly written, stimulating book. Jordan cheats a bit by not including philosophers (like Pythagoras and Empedocles), who do not fit into his pattern, and for him ancient philosophy stops before the Neoplatonists. The result is a picture of ancient philosophy which is closer to that of modern philosophy than many will find comfortable. This is, however, a minor point which hardly detracts from the value of this excellent work. It is hard to know what to make of Oxford Studies in Ancient Philosophy Vol. VIII.3 A volume in this series is published every year, containing a series of articles and reviews (this year six articles and six discussions of books or articles) on no particular theme. It is, in effect, in every respect a journal, except that you cannot sub- scribe to it. As a journal, it is a splendid publication. The quality of the contributions is high. In the current issue, for example, we have: 'Scientific Explanation and Empirical Data in Aristotle's Meteorology' by Cynthia A. Freeland, arguing the rhetorical advantages of Aris- totle's method of presenting data in the context of discussions of the views of his predecessors and so affirming his conception of science as 'a sort of cumulative group</page><page sequence="31">110 SUBJECT REVIEWS endeavour'; David Gallop's 'Animals in the Poetics', which draws an analogy between the way Aristotle handles literature, and the way he handles the world of nature; and a fascinating article by Salim Kemal, 'The Poetics in Avicenna's Commentary', setting out how Ibn Sina defended poetic language on the grounds that it is a kind of syllo- gism. J. O. Urmson's * The Greek Philosophical Vocabulary4 is not, at first sight, the sort of book you would imagine reading for fun. It offers an alphabetical list of technical terms (in transliteration) used by Greek philosophers, with brief explanations of how they are used, generously illustrated by relevant quotations supplied both in Greek (transliter- ated) and in translation. In fact, though it is not the sort of book most of us will want to read from cover to cover, it is a first-rate browsing book. Its real place, however, is as a work of reference, and every library should have it. Although not all of the entries are equally useful (what, for example, does the entry under pur tell about fire that we do not know already?) and although it is a bit thin on later philosophical language (for example, no entries for epokhe or oikeiosis) Urmson's concise and clear explanations are a delight to read. I suppose that one could say that being interpreted and re-interpreted from every conceivable point of view is the sign of being a truly great writer. By that criterion, Plato is a very great writer indeed. David Roochnik's B** The Tragedy ofReason: Towards a Platonic Conception of Logos' is a spirited defence of Plato against two groups of critics: the first is the repre- sentatives of the scientific tradition stemming from Descartes; the second is those whom Roochnik calls 'the subversives', beginning with Nietzche and including the likes of Derrida, Rorty, and Foucault, 'the grand deconstructors of Western rationalism'. Both accuse Plato of corrupting philosophy by an over-emphasis on reason, and an excessive optimism as to its value and effectiveness. Roochnik's contention is that Plato, in his dialogues, had already faced and answered this kind of criticism, and that, for Plato, reason was not the 'hard' rationality of Aristotle, but something which lives in and emerges from conflict, and which preserves the same awareness of the conditionality of the good as is found in the tragedians and poets preferred by 'the subversives'. He argues with great vigour, though even Plato's most enthusiastic admirers may feel that sometimes he goes over the top a bit. A com- pletely different picture of Plato's work is to be found in Adi Ophir's B**Plato's Invisible Cities: Discourse and Power in the Republic.6 Ophir claims that he is treating the Republic as a 'political act'. It is not made clear what he means by this. What in fact he is doing is trying to deconstruct the Republic very much in the manner of Derrida. To be fair to Ophir, his reading of the work has some merit. His study of the exploitation of polarities in Plato's concepts, and particularly his use of the idea of space and boundaries, is worth thinking about. In the end, however, one is left wondering whether there is quite as much there as Ophir sees. He seems to believe, for example, that the myth of Gyges' discovery of the ring of invisibility (at the beginning of Book 2) is the key to the whole work. Well, perhaps, but he failed to convince this reader. Some of the things he says raise the question of whether he is really on top of the material. To give just one example, can he really believe that when Leontius calls his eyes kakodaimones he is saying that they are evil demons (pp. 26-27)? The odd bits of untransliterated Greek scattered about the text and notes seem not to have been checked at all. This is a book which raises interesting questions, but it would have been enormously improved by pruning, checking, and, above all, by a bit of hard thought. Thomas Gould's B** The Ancient Quarrel between Poetry and Philosophy7 has probably more interesting things to say about tragedy than about Plato. His discussion of pathos, for example, and his analyses of individual tragedies may well have more sig- nificance for students of ancient literature than students of Plato. This is a very wide-</page><page sequence="32">SUBJECT REVIEWS 111 ranging book, and is really about the idea of the tragic in all forms of art and at all periods. It covers not just the Greeks but also Shakespeare, Goya, Yeats, Bergman, and many others. So far as Plato is concerned, Gould argues that Plato's problem with literature was that it gratifies the lowest parts of the psyche, so that Plato's quarrel with the poets is not just a peripheral consequence of his views, it is at the very heart of his philosophical outlook. Fair enough, but really this is just the starting point for a book which goes on to deal with much wider issues. The books on Aristotle reviewed this year are on much more con- ventional lines. To produce a study of Physics VII is a formidable task, not only because of the difficulty of the subject matter (this is the book in which the unmoved mover is intro- duced) but also because of the existence of two quite different versions of the text. Robert Wardy's B** The Chain of Change: a Study ofAristotle's Physics VIP provides us with parallel texts of both versions, then parallel translations of both versions, and finally a commentary (which is really a series of extended essays on important issues). This is a book for specialists, who will have every reason to be grateful for the clarity and care of Wardy's work. Michael Ferejohn's B** The Origins of Aristotelian Science,9 despite its title, is really an attempt to rehabilitate Aristotle's Posterior Analytics, a work Ferejohn says is the 'ugly stepchild in the Aristotelian corpus', and which the rest of us regard as confused, dis- organized, and unpolished. On the contrary, claims Ferejohn, we can see in it a clear scheme based on Aristotle's response to questions about knowledge raised by Plato in the Meno and the Theaetetus, which leads to the first beginnings of the concepts which are the foundation of Aristotelian science. The work is highly technical, and accessible (and, I guess, interesting) only to specialists in this area. Given the notorious difficulty of the text, and the problems arising from its puzzling relationship with the Nicomachean Ethics, it is not surprising that we have had to wait over a hundred years for a modern edition of BAristotle's Eudemian Ethics.10 So the new Oxford Classical Text edited by R. R. Walzer and J. M. Mingay is especially welcome. It is an impeccable work of scholarship. The coincidences with the Nicomachean Ethics are carefully noted. It will be an indispensible resource for all students of Aristotle. Books on Hellenistic philosophy are unusually thin this year. There are none on the Epicureans, and only one, B** The Stoic Theory of Oikeiosis," by Troels Engberg-Pedersen, on the Stoics. The heart of this book is a discussion of the exposi- tion of Stoicism in Cicero, De Finibus 3, expanded and elucidated by passages from a number of other authors. Engberg-Pedersen believes that the key to understanding Stoic ethics is the concept of oikei6sis, of which there are two versions: an 'objective' oikeiosis, the bringing of a thing into line with its nature; and a 'subjective' oikeiosis, the development of self-awareness and self-love. He develops these ideas to show the role of oikeiosis in defining virtue and the telos. He has an especially interesting chapter on the problem of freedom, in which his line is that the arguments attributed to Chrysippus in Cicero's De Fato are not a complete account of the Stoic defence of freedom, but simply the beginnings of an argument showing that there is still room for individual responsibility in a determined world. Given the Stoics' attachment to incomprehensible jargon, the expounder of Stoicism has a difficult task, but even making allowances for this, Engberg-Pedersen makes few concessions to his readers. This book is hard going. Not all that long ago, the sceptics were regarded as an insignificant curiosity in the history of philosophy, and yet now, out of the meagre crop of books on Hellenistic philosophy, two are on the sceptics. Jonathan Barnes must take a good deal of the credit for bringing the sceptics back into the centre of ancient philosophy, and his latest book, The Toils of Scepticism,12 will help to maintain the interest he has awakened. It deals with the work of Sextus Empiricus, and particularly those parts of it which are derived</page><page sequence="33">112 SUBJECT REVIEWS from Agrippa, a mysterious sceptic of the 1st century B.C. Barnes defends his choice of subject on the grounds that Agrippa was an important figure in the development of scepti- cism, had a great influence on later philosophy, and has points to make which still have force. In fact, this lucid and elegant work, enlivened by an attractive good-humour, needs no defence. Despite Barnes's disclaimer that his work is not intended as an introduction to Pyrrhonism, there are few books which would be more effective in convincing a newcomer of the continuing relevance and value of ancient philosophy. Leo Groarke, curiously, begins his book B**Greek Scepticism: Anti-Realist Trends in Ancient Thought'3 with the complaint that the sceptics have been regarded as second-class philosophers as compared to Plato and Aristotle. He contends that, on the contrary, they are not only important in their own right, but also their influence on the development of modern philosophy is at least as great as that of Plato and Aristotle. He attributes their undervaluation, at least in part, to the alleged fact that modern writers on ancient philosophy have failed to keep up with movements in modern philosophy (a claim which a good number of scholars are entitled to resent deeply). He denies that the Pyrrhoneans taught a radical scepticism; they did not, he says, deny all belief, and so did not defend a philosophical position which makes normal life impossible. As a consequence, he believes that there is much less difference between Pyrrhonean scepticism and Academic scepticism than has been claimed. Groarke's use of the ancient evidence is a bit odd. He picks and chooses his authorities. The evidence of Cicero is used very uncritically, and it is strange to find the philosophy of Socrates (as opposed to Plato) discussed using as evidence the Phaedo, the Republic, and Diogenes Laertius. In the end this is an unsatisfactory book, which is a pity since Groarke is a real enthusiast for his subject, and clearly has a contribution to make. One of the by- products of the recent growth in interest in Hellenistic philosophy has been the rehabilita- tion of Cicero as a philosophical author, or at any rate as a source for interesting philosophical ideas. A new translation, B*Cicero: On Duties,14 by M. T. Griffin and E. M. Atkins, in a series of texts designed for non-classical students of political theory, will do much to maintain that interest. It shows great imagination on the part of the publisher to produce a translation of a work which has been little read these days, although it has been very influential in the past. They have been well served by their editors. There is a brief but informative introduction giving the political and philosophical background, and an admirable note on key Latin terms. The translation is clear, readable, and neat, and equipped with sensible notes. It is a good read for anyone, and can be recommended with confidence, not only to students of philosophy or political theory, but to anyone wanting a bit of illuminating background to the Late Republic. Aris &amp; Phillips must by now be finding it quite tedious to hear their series of classical texts described as 'useful', 'helpful', or even 'now familiar'. Their latest product B*Cicero: Laelius on Friendship (Laelius de Amicitia) &amp; The Dream ofScipio (Somnium Scipionis),'5 edited by J. G. F. Powell, maintains the standard we have come to expect. As usual, there is a Latin text, facing translation, a commentary on the translation, and a brief introduction. The two works in this volume are an odd pair, but welcome nevertheless, because together they make an interesting study of the ways in which Cicero used and transformed ideas derived from Greek authors. Powell gives Cicero much more credit than is common for originality in handling his material, but makes no exaggerated claims for his acumen as a philosopher. It is particularly good now to have available a good translation of the Somnium Scipionis, a very influential work which has not up to now been easily accessible to the general reader. Robert J. Penella's B** Greek Philosophers and Sophists in the Fourth Century A.D.: Studies in Eunapius of</page><page sequence="34">SUBJECT REVIEWS 113 Sardis'16 deals with a conception of philosophy which Cicero and his contemporaries would hardly have recognized. This study of Eunapius' Lives of Philosophers and Sophists gives a vivid insight into not only the ambience of Neoplatonism (especially Iamblichus and his circle), but also the cultural life of late antiquity and the relationship between pagan intellec- tuals and the newly dominant Christianity. The juxtaposition and conflation of philosophy and rhetoric represent the development of an all-purpose concept of 'culture'. The philo- sophy, of course, is quite different from the subject studied in philosophy departments today (see for example the discussion on p. 44 of precisely how high lamblichus could levitate). This is a fascinating exploration of the place of learned men in late antique society. The last philosophical volume of the gigantic Aufstieg und Niedergang der romischen Welt to be reviewed in the journal (G&amp;R 37 [1990], 124-5), on Stoicism, was something of a disappointment. The latest, however, B**Epikureismus, Skeptizismus, Kynis- mus, Orphica, Doxographica,'7 is an altogether more impressive and useful collection. It combines general surveys of philosophical and religious movements (John Ferguson's exhaustive compilation of all references to Epicureanism in the Roman Empire; James Allen and Jonathan Barnes on Sextus Empiricus; Marie-Odile Goulet-Caze on Roman Cynicism; Luc Brisson on Orphism) with articles on more specialized aspects of the schools. Much of this material is not easily accessible elsewhere. Perhaps the most valuable are the surveys of recent work on Philodemus by Tiziano Dorandi and Elizabeth Asmis, and on the new dis- coveries at Oenoanda of fresh fragments of the famous Epicurean inscription, by Diskin Clay. Those fortunate enough to live within travelling distance of a library which can afford this volume will find it invaluable. The Duckworth series Ancient Commentaries on Aristotle is living up to its promise. The latest volume **Philoponus, Corollaries on Place and Void"8 is particularly welcome, since it contains the passages in which Philoponus argues against Aristotle's view that the speed of a falling body is proportional to its weight, thereby anticipating Galileo. This volume should immediately be put into the hands of anyone who still persists in believing that ancient philosophy ran out of ideas. RICHARD WALLACE NOTES 1. Psychology.

Hainsworth not only informs but also stimulates, making any number of astute observations which go far beyond 'technicalities'.' Essentially conservative in his approach (I didn't feel Hainsworth was particularly happy in a brief reference to the western and the cinema, pp. 148-9) this scholar is surely right to stress both change in tradition and also continuity of tradition - hence half a dozen pages on Ennius and Ovid (but regrettably only a bare mention of Claudian and a single paragraph on Nonnus). Any student opting for a course on epic will profit considerably from consulting this addition to the Eidos series, while the advanced will be able to pursue particular inter- ests by resort to the most helpful notes (pp. 151-78). For Tyrrell and Brown myths are 'words in action' or 'a verbal expression of beliefs, concepts, and practices', a definition illustrated by Hesiod's Theogony, the warrior as defender and destroyer (as in the Homeric poems and Sophocles' Ajax), sacrifice (the Ajax again), marriage (the Hymn to Demeter and tragedy), and politics (as exemplified by autochthony, the Ion, Theseus, the Parthenon, and the funeral oration and the Antigone).2 Although much of the material is in no way Athenian and highly selective (and, in some cases, heavily 'recycled'), and I would challenge a fair amount (though no expert on American history, I seem to recall that it is American capital ships which are named after states and so the U.S.S. Maine can hardly be a 'destroyer', p. 159), this is a book on myth I would encourage students to read; it may be obviously inferior to Kirk's The Nature of Greek Myth but it is easy to peruse and full of interesting suggestions. Does all that much need to be said about human sacrifice among the Greeks? Apparently it does according to Dennis D. Hughes who has compiled helpful accounts of the Minoan-Mycenaean evidence including the Anemospilia find and possible cannibalism at Knossos (Appendix B considers [inconclusively] Pylos Tn 316), the funeral</page><page sequence="36">SUBJECT REVIEWS 115 of Patroclus, Evadne's suttee, the mythical and cultic material, the pharmakos ritual, and the Locrian maiden tribute, by which time the search for anything vaguely relevant is getting a mite desperate.3 Useful, even invaluable, as a source of information. Reluc- tant though some may be to admit it, the evidence accumulated in BLate Carthaginian Child Sacrifice4 leaves no doubt as to the longevity of child sacrifice as a ritual crucial to Phoeni- cian religion, especially at time of crisis. One can only hope that the children were already drugged or dead before they were incinerated. The stelae which commemorated such acts, by our standards and those of the ancients apart from the Phoenicians, of savagery both marked the presence of burial urn and also publicly announced that the parents had met their obligations to the gods. B Women in Greek Tragedy5 divides into two parts, the first theoretical and more general (pp. 11-146) and the other specific in considering one play by Aeschylus, two by Sophocles, and, not unexpectedly, five by Euripides (pp. 147- 313). The author seems to have read everything and lets us know it! In fact I have very much sympathy with her belief that 'the crucial institutions and values of society constituted the elements of drama' and that women are prominent in tragedy because they 'figured prominently within these institutions'. If only this had been argued at about half the book's present length and in language less opaque, I would be much happier and so too, I suspect, would be the reader. Comparisons are always invidious but it is inevitable that one should compare The Aesthetics of the Greek Banquet6 and Murray's Sympotica (see G&amp;R 38 [1991], 260). The former is so much slighter with its generously spaced text and frequent illustration incorporated in the text that it is equally inevitable that any comparison should be to its disadvantage. But it is only fair also to note that its scope is much narrower: chapters examine the Greek experience of wine, the symposium and komos (bound together by the krater which, in true Gallic fashion, is said to act as a symbol of mixing and sharing, embodying all the values of the mean), associated pottery with its anatomical potential and address to the drinker, party games, pictures and poems, and the metaphoric linking of the two liquids wine and water. Enjoyable and easy to flick through certainly but scarcely qualifying as the 'hard' stuff in either sense. Obviously a doctoral dissertation listing and discussing without much discrimination, BHeroes in Herodotus7 illustrates 'the inter- action of myth and history' best in two brief appendices, one on the birth and childhood of Cyrus (pp. 249-53; see also pp. 102-7 on the birth of Demaratus) and the other on the wooing of Agariste (pp. 255-7). Perhaps I was disappointed not to find what I expected, e.g., an investigation into the often bizarre intermingling of myth and history which makes up Herodotus' account of the Greek tyrants (such as the story of Cypselus and his sons). Instead one has to plough through chapters on 'genealogies, charter myths, and landmarks', 'religious references' (in and outside of Egypt), 'the heroic age and chronology', 'individual heroes' (actually Cadmus, Heracles, and Perseus), and, more than a little surprisingly, 'heroes in connection with Xerxes' (a 'filler' but not much else?). A firmer editorial hand would have been a help. By the way, the Christian name of Ferrill (see p. 263) is 'Arther' and the sic is redundant. Basanos is the subject of the vastly pretentious (and far too long and politically inspired) Torture and Truth,8 another effusion from Page duBois. What is basanos? To put it crudely, basanos is first 'touchstone', then 'test', and finally 'torture' or if you prefer the author's convoluted words, 'the process of testing has been spun out from the simple metallurgist's experiment, to a new figuration of the work of interrogating matter' (p. 36). We all know about the reputed torturing of slaves in Athenian law. But how many know that the slave's body is 'construed as one of these sites of truth, like the adyton, the underworld, the interiority of the woman's body, the elsewhere toward which truth is always</page><page sequence="37">116 SUBJECT REVIEWS slipping, a utopian space allowing a less mediated, more direct access to truth, where the truth is no longer forgotten, slipping away' (p. 105)? Perhaps I'm getting too old The 'selected papers' on Greek science by G. E. R. Lloyd comprise 15 items dating from 1961 to 1985, some from pretty obscure journals, e.g., Sudhoffs Archiv and Pedi- lavium, and 3 yet to be published but on their way.9 Lloyd may be conscious of enormous gaps in his range and competence but his readers will simply gasp at the variety of topics considered - ancient medicine and cosmologies, Near Eastern influence, the use of experi- ment and dissection. Plato, Aristotle, and Galen are just some - and the depth of scholarship everywhere displayed. Earlier thoughts are further refined in the introductions prefacing papers 1 to 15. This is a remarkable collection. Otto Morkholm did not live to complete his survey of Hellenistic coinage, but we are fortunate that at least he was able to cover the period from Alexander to the Peace of Apamea, a crucial moment for Roman intervention. A study of coinage is also a study of the historical setting with inevitable light being shed on the economic and social background, and this is certainly demonstrated throughout "**Early Hellenistic Coinage.1o Philip Grierson, moreover, has added a sketch (pp. 169-84) of the later coinage and appendices list rulers and supply a chronological table, glossary, and select bibliography. The coin illustrations are small but sharp and clear. This is C.U.P. at its best. Though restricted, on the whole, to the world and society of the Hellenistic and Roman cities, there is a wealth of material incorporated in the diffuse but equally dense (bibliography = pp. 335-81) "**Ancient Youth, the Ambiguity of Youth and the Absence of Adolescence in Greco-Roman Society," including detailed discussions of ancient education, the profession of doctor and of lawyer, senatorial youth and Roman knights, and politics in the Greek East and municipal councils in the West. Extensive use of comparative and epigraphic evidence is a noteworthy feature of a study which examines its subject from a variety of angles, all of which lead inexorably to the conclusion that adolescents as a distinct group did not exist for the ancients. BDiodorus Siculus and the First Century is dedicated to two propositions: Diodorus is no unthinking copyist but much more original than commonly supposed, and his Bibliotheke is 'a document substantially reflecting the intellectual and political attitudes of the late Hellenistic period'. But Kenneth Sacks can be excessively confident and read too much between the lines as when he considers Diodorus' attitude towards Rome (see, for example, the 'coarse insult' of pp. 156-7). Of a wider interest is an attempt to set Diodorus in his contemporary setting (though I would prefer this to be chapter one rather than chapter six). Few will quarrel with the description of the Bibliotheke as being 'broadly moralistic and nonpragmatic', but some may find it difficult to accept that the historian was 'moderately ill disposed towards Rome'. Such a case has yet to be established. Available from the onset, thank goodness, both as a hardback and a paperback, B* The Roman Household'3 collects 217 passages in translation grouped under the headings 'composition and definition' (= 24), 'the household as focus of emotion' (= 24), 'ideals and anxieties' (= 31), 'the economics of the Roman household' (= 19), 'the life-cycle' (= 39), 'inheritance' (= 27), 'manumission and freedmen' (= 32), and 'patronage and friend- ship' (= 21). Passages may be prefaced by a few words of introduction or followed by brief notes but, on the whole, are left to speak for themselves (with the Latin, in the case of some inscriptions, also included). A most useful collection is marred only by some really murky illustrations; at the same time I applaud the range of topics illustrated, the description of the sources, and the 'select' but still extensive bibliography. Absolutely packed with material - look at all the examples examined and also at the accompanying footnotes - " War, Women and Children in Ancient Rome'" claims that war had a devastating effect on</page><page sequence="38">SUBJECT REVIEWS 117 three groups at the time of the Late Republic and Early Empire, noblewomen, working women, and children: 'Roman noblewomen came into possession of sizeable fortunes, and increasingly were able to administer them with minimal interference' (p. 101); 'in striking contrast ... for literally thousands of the anonymous wives and daughters of the equally anonymous men serving in the ranks, Rome's unending wars of conquest held out only the promise of a bleak present and still more hopeless future' (p. 144); if the small child came to be valued as an individual and to be looked upon with love and affection, an explanation is perhaps to be sought in the absence of the father on campaign and a consequent diminution of the patria potestas or surrogate parenting provided by Greek nutrices. The first of these three propositions is by far the most convincingly argued, but here, of course, the evidence is most plentiful. When it comes to the plebs rustica and urbana or to children, we are skating on perilously thin ice. Nine papers from Australian, North American, and European contributors make up "Marriage, Divorce, and Children in Ancient Rome." Eight of these may be thought orthodox in the sense they consider adult-child and father-son relationships, divorce and remarriage, the sentimental ideal of the Roman family, the children of freed- men, and authority in the Roman household, but the final offering from Andrew Wallace- Hadrill breaks new ground in 'sampling Pompeii and Herculaneum', that is, examining the evidence from these two towns and thereby revealing 'the physical setting of the family, and consequently the way the family environment was conceived' (p. 226). The result is sur- prising: big households but not big families but rather 'housefuls' or crowds consisting of the owner's or user's family and slaves mixed with a fluctuating assortment of dependents, freedmen, workers, friends, and lodgers. In a further volume (see G&amp;R 36 [1989], 127-8) Duncan Fishwick continues his monumental 'Studies in the Ruler Cult of the Western Provinces of the Roman Empire' 1 with chapters, mainly new or revised, on 'Genius and Numen', 'Numina Augustorum', 'the Imperial Numen in Roman Britain', 'Domus Divina', 'Augusto ut deo', 'Augustan Gods', 'Augustan Blessings and Virtues', and, especially impressive, 'Liturgy and Ceremonial' and appendices on 'Dated Inscriptions and the Feriale Duranum' and 'the Augustales and the Imperial Cult'. Each contribution supports its fellows and the highest standard is maintained throughout. It can be quite remarkable how much is revealed by a single source such as the codex-calendar of A.D. 354, an illustrated almanac presented to the wealthy Christian aristocrat Valentinus whose family, however, the author suspects, was staunchly pagan.'7 How vital was pagan ritual and religion in post-Constantinian Rome? The codex-calendar shows that 98 days of ludi and circenses were held in honour of the imperial cult with 69 of these devoted to the House of Constantine, the most important pagan cults were those ofJupiter, Sol, Mars, Hercules, and Salus, and the really popular 'new' cults celebrated Attis and the Magna Mater and Isis, findings which needed to be firmly established though not so unexpected given the con- servative and traditional character of Roman religion and the central role of the emperor - 'the significance of imperial approval and of the emperor's role in effecting the public celebration of pagan cults is far greater than previously thought' (pp. 188-9). For Salzman Christian and pagan were not in conflict but had reached an accommodation; furthermore a process of assimilation (on both sides) was well under way, opinions which carry greater weight than the suggested identification of Valentinus as the brother of the orator Sym- machus. Not to be missed by those interested in the fourth century A.D. is an assessment of the evidence for pagan-Christian conflict (pp. 205 ff.) and the anti-pagan legislation of Gratian and Theodosius and the reaction it inspired (pp. 232ff.). This is an extremely important study - don't be misled by its bland title. Another example of a single</page><page sequence="39">118 SUBJECT REVIEWS source yielding an abundance of evidence about religious belief in the mid-fourth century A.D. is provided by the sarcophagus of the city prefect Junius Bassus who was baptized a Christian on his death-bed - neofitus iit ad deum.18 Its scenes from Old and New Testament and other decoration suggest to Malbon that, rather than being a testament of faith or portrayal of Christian death, the iconography of the sarcophagus incorporates specifically Christian scenes, and these are given the place of first importance, and also apparently pagan scenes which are endowed with a Christian or Christianized significance by their less prominent position on the lid and ends. The result is that 'Roman tradition, while affirmed, is subordinated to Christian tradition' (p. 152), a process similarly to be seen on the Arch of Constantine before and Augustine's Confessions later. Quite a tour de force which doesn't quite carry conviction. "** The Divine Verdict" covers Israel and some of her neigh- bours, the Greeks and Romans, Christianity, Indian doctrines, Confucianism, and Pharaonic Egypt in Part I 'Judgement in History and in this Life' (pp. 3-198) and Egypt, Iran, Judaism, Christianity, Crete and Greece, and the Mystery Religions in Part II 'Judge- ment after Death' (pp. 201-343), a massive field supported by a bibliography (pp. 358-89) where I gave up counting the separate items when I spotted that even the Hittites notch up twenty entries. But J. Gwyn Griffiths is just the person to control material so diverse; though section headings such as 'the Babylonian Theodicy', 'Vergil: commissioned but inspired', 'Mohism and Taoism', 'the Minoan Judges of the Dead', and 'the Dionysiac Mysteries: from the Villa dei Misteri' look terrifyingly daunting, the concept of judgement administered by divinity or divinities and affecting life before and after death is fundamental and can be traced in remarkable detail both from picture and from text, and this is exactly what the author does. The result is a book whose every page impresses with its erudition. A work of medical history, Hllippocrates in a World of Pagans and Christians20 covers, and covers in great detail - the bibliography lists 730 items - Christian response to Hippocratic medicine during the first six centuries A.D. Its message is conveyed by two sentences: 'Christian culture needed Hippocratic medicine, but it did not need Hippocrates as a culture hero' (p. 241) and 'throughout the world of pagans and Christians, Hippocrates represented the autonomy of medicine as a sphere of life' (p. 256). An extremely useful tool ('References' on pp. 149-56 offers a most helpful bibliography) "A Biographical Dictionary of the Byzantine Empire21 comprises short biographies of 'most of the persons of note and influence in the Byzantine Empire', beginning with Acacius Patriarch of Constantinople 472-89 (16 lines) and concluding with Zosimus the historian (6 lines). I have nothing but respect for the highly compressed but also highly informative entries and only wish that many of them might have been made that little bit longer. I can think of no better book to have in hand when touring Athens than John Freely's guide B*Strolling through Athens. 22 Its first seven chapters take the reader on a tour of ancient Athens; chapters eight and nine deal with the Roman and Byzantine city; then we have a chapter on the Plaka and two on Central Athens, i.e. modern Athens and its museums, though the National Archaeo- logical Museum has the next chapter all to itself - how I know what he means when Freely says that after seeing downstairs and the Thera frescoes it is quite impossible to carry on with the rest of the upper floor. What remains - Monastiraki, Lycabettos, the Academy, Kifissia - provides the final chapter and we conclude with four appendices - chronology, glossary, bibliography, and a list of opening hours. The plates are adequate and the diagrams most helpful in supplementing the mass of detail squeezed in most entertainingly by an author who deserves our warmest thanks for producing so worthy a successor to Strolling through Istanbul or his Blue Guide Istanbul, now available in a 1991 third</page><page sequence="40">SUBJECT REVIEWS 119 edition. Accessibility to the serious tourist will have added to the attraction of the exhibition 'Jordan: Treasures from an Ancient Land' held in 1991 at the Liverpool Museum.23 The exhibition, naturally enough, engendered its accompanying book, a collec- tion of essays on Jordan's sculpture (nothing spectacular apart from the 'idols', plates 47- 49), pottery (note especially the delicacy in both fabric and design of the Nabataean bowls, plates 88-89), art and technology (= metalwork), mosaics, scripts (as exemplified, for instance, by the Moabite Stone), and traditional costume and jewellery. Best of all are the mosaics, a rapidly growing assemblage, dating from the fourth to the eighth century A.D., and found at sites such as Jerash, Madaba, Mount Nebo and its neighbourhood, and Umm er-Rasas where the map and town vignette elements are in a class of their very own. Just one item is missing - any kind of description of the architecture of the cities of the Decapolis and of Petra, all the more a pity as the illustrations throughout are of an exceptional quality (and the price is low!). As the 14 very different papers prove, the details of books published and conferences and seminars held between 1965 and 1990 confirm, and Greg Stanton's survey of the state of the art 'down under' illustrates, the Classics flourish in Australia and the success of the Australian Society for Classical Studies, twenty-five years old in 1990, is echoed throughout the commemorative volume Past, Present and Future.24 A line is being held and plans for an advance are in the course of development. The title The Cam- bridge Guide to the Museums of Europe25 is a little deceptive since not every museum is included (the 2,000 or so which are described represent 'rather less than one in seven of Europe's museums'!) and Europe here is just western Europe. But having noted such a restriction, I must admit finding this collection most useful: practical information (e.g. the crucial times of opening) is given and short but adequate descriptions of the exhibits accom- pany each entry. But why no mention of the Minoan material in the Ashmolean and is the building incorporating the Sainsbury Centre at Norwich only 'of considerable technical interest'? Still, an extensive 'index of subjects' can inspire some most stimulating voyages of discovery! P. WALCOT NOTES 1. The Idea of Epic. Eidos III. By J. B. Hainsworth.

Reprints A new edition of B* Through Greek Eyes' from Cambridge in 1991 will introduce another generation of pupils to the ancient Greeks as presented in the literary sources from Homer (dated too early c. 9th century?) to Cedrenus (Who's that?, you may well ask). I must say that some 'facts' recorded here disturbed me: were the eyes of the Poseidon (or Zeus?) from Artemisium originally of stone or clay? What is meant when we read that griffins 'were often shown in temple art before 500 B.C.'? Is it Paris rather than Apollo who looks on as Achilles fights Hector on just about the most famous Greek vase in the BM? Surely this</page><page sequence="42">SUBJECT REVIEWS 121 picture cannot be cited as evidence for the length of a Homeric war-spear. And can we really refer to 'the Monument of the Ten Imaginary Heroes'? I could quote more but won't. Originally published in English translation in 1978, "Cunning Intelligence in Greek Culture and Society2 appeared in a University of Chicago Press edition in 1991. This celebration of metis remains an exciting but often frustrating read (cf. G&amp;R 26 [1979], 210). It is the feet of Hephaestus (pp. 259ff.) which especially bother me: I remain more inclined to interpret defective limbs as a sign of sexual inadequacy, even symbolic castration, than as visible evidence of 'wise thoughts and his (i.e. Hephaestus') craftsman's intelligence', but others, no doubt, will wish to dismiss as fanciful both propositions. First appear- ing in 1987 and released as a paperback by the University of California Press four years later, "Achilles3 discusses manifestations of the hero by Homer ('the archetype'), other Greek authors (including Plato!), Roman and the later Greek sources (where the material is thinner but not without considerable influence), and medieval versions. Achilles was not simply the greatest of warriors: he also became, given time, the most passionate of lovers though, again given time, he was reduced by the end of the thirteenth century to 'an unprincipled war machine that was turned off and on by crude desires' (p. 232). Luckily, with the advent of the Renaissance, the glory of Achilles was reborn. As Stanford pointed out long ago, mythical figures are readily adaptable and none more so than Homer's Achilles or Odysseus, and their adaptations allow us to trace much more than just literary fashions. Another 1991 addition to the Clarendon Paperbacks was ** The Spartan Tradition in European Thought,4 an outstanding survey of the enduring fascination of a state seen, at various times, as 'a prototype of the British limited monarchy', 'an egalitarian, often more or less communistic, republic', 'the ideal aristocratic republic', and 'an exemplar of National Socialist virtues'. Today we all revere democratic Athens but that Sparta held the stage in men's estimation from the end of the fifth century B.C. to the eighteenth century A.D. is masterfully demonstrated by Elizabeth Rawson, who reminds us (and this was back in 1969) that the contemporary embodiment of Sparta is usually found in South Africa. I greatly enjoyed (and profited from) `*Public and Performance in the Greek Theatre' both when it first appeared (see G&amp;R 37 [1990], 102) and again when Routledge issued it as a paperback in 1991, since its author views Greek plays in the setting of the theatre and constantly refers to the actual plays themselves. It is true that little startlingly new is said but as producer's handbook or as recognition that plays are meant to be per- formed rather than read, Arnott's contribution is of a high order. This is the kind of book to inspire the student of drama - its author's enthusiasm is infectious and he tackles exactly the right topics: the audience and the chorus, the actor seen and heard, debate and drama, place and time, and character and continuity. But perhaps I am prejudiced because, like Arnott, and here I quote his book's concluding sentence, I believe that in Greek drama 'the tragic character, no less than the comic, adapts himself to his immediate environment', i.e. dramatic context, not 'psychology', determines what is said or done. Soundness is the great merit of B* Women in Athenian Law and Life,6 also issued as a paperback by Routledge in 1991, and I am increasingly inclined to think Roger Just the very best book on Greek women to recommend to students both at school and at university. After an introduction on the 'problem' of women he takes the reader systematically through politics, legal capa- bilities, marriage, the family and property, freedom and seclusion, personal relationships, gender characteristics, and the threat posed by women (= 'the enemy within') before con- cluding with a further chapter on women in myth (= 'the savage without'). Evidence is cited on a generous scale and never pressed too far but presented in such a way as to make us</page><page sequence="43">122 SUBJECT REVIEWS realize that we are considering 'real' people and not merely a scholar's constructs. The Philipp von Zabern series 'Kulturgeschichte der antiken Welt' includes German versions of standard works byJohn Boardman and the like. In 1990 it added as its forty-seventh volume Trendall's handbook Red Figure Vases of South Italy and Sicily. 7 The number of illustrations and the absolute authority of its compiler (cf. G&amp;R 36 [1989], 247-8) make this a splendid advertisement for a special type of traditional scholarship; and it is, moreover, 'printed on fade resistant and archival quality paper'! Only a few months after their original appearance Duckworth released in 1991 'Paperduck' editions of both BPagan Priests and BThe Greek Way ofLife. 8 The former is of the highest quality and the latter, on re-reading, even better than first thought (cf. G&amp;R 38 [1991], 119 and 118). It is the sheer mass of evidence accumulated - pictorial as well as textual - and the range of material covered which remain overwhelmingly impressive. At its paperback price students should be lining up to purchase Garland and lining up in great numbers! The third edition of *A History of the Ancient World9 was noted in G&amp;R 31 (1984), 230 and this book's continuing popularity was marked in 1991 by the issue from Oxford of yet a further edition. Clear and useful for the relatively inexperienced and certainly comprehensive in progressing from 'the first achievements of man' to 'the end of the ancient world'. In 1991 Routledge reprinted as a University Paperback the fourth edition of H. H. Scullard's standard textbook B*A History of the Roman World 753 to 146 BC. 10 Don't be bothered that this book was first published in 1935: extensive revision marked the fourth edition of 1980 and it remains the best introduction to the pre-Gracchi period. Published in 1991 as a World's Classics paperback only a year after its first release (see G&amp;R 38 [1991], 86-88), Lee's B* The Poems of Catullus" now stands an even better chance of becoming what it fully deserves to become, 'the standard version both for those with Latin and those studying Catullus in translation'. Reviewed, quite rapturously, in G&amp;R 26 (1979), 200-1, BA Commentary on Horace: Odes, Book 1112 also joined the Clarendon Paperbacks in 1991 and not before time. Given editors of the discernment of Nisbet and Hubbard, assessment is unneces- sary. The text of The Augustan Villa at Boscotrecase,13 which first appeared thirty years ago, has been revised (though not as much as the 1990 publisher Philipp von Zabern might lead the reader to expect) and expanded (see especially Appendix I by Joan R. Mertens, pp. 50-64) and, even more importantly, all the wall paintings are now illustrated in a dazzling sequence of colour photographs. Since the villa was owned by Agrippa Postumus, the wall decoration from its 'Black', 'Red', and 'Mythological' rooms offers magnificent examples of the Third Style, consisting of three different types of landscape painting - landscape vignettes and bucolic and mythological (Polyphemus and Galatea and Andro- meda rescued by Perseus) landscapes. The illustrations are quite stunning. It came as a surprise, even a shock, to realize that it was only in 1990 that Cambridge brought out a paperback of E. R. Dodds's classic study of 'some aspects of religious experience from Marcus Aurelius to Constantine', *Pagan and Christian in an Age ofAnxiety.'14 I remember the sense of excitement aroused twenty-five years ago especially by the last of this mono- graph's four chapters, on pagan views of Christianity and Christian views of paganism, but had forgotten the evidence and secondary material so helpfully collected in the footnotes. I am still waiting to read a better account of the reasons for the Christians' lack of popularity or the psychological conditions which favoured Christianity's growth. Essentials remain but the 'running' notes (a splendid idea adopted for the second edition - see G&amp;R 22 [1975], 207-8) of the 1991 third edition of Oxford's *Scribes and Scholars" reveal many bibliographical additions. I continue to be mildly surprised that 'a guide to the transmission</page><page sequence="44">SUBJECT REVIEWS 123 of Greek and Latin literature' should be so enthralling. This is an outstanding contribution to a difficult but crucial area of study. A third edition in 1990 from Oxford of Cannon of Greek Authors and Works'6 reflects the already formidable (cf. G&amp;R 34 [1987], 109) TLG data bank's recent expansion and present concern with scholia (see pp. 344-56) and later Greek and Byzantine historiography and lexicography (= Phase IV: 600 to 1453, p. xiii). Another reprint as a Paperduck in 1991 enables the reader to enjoy once more the selection of classical poetry in translation, from Chaucer to Logue, Hughes, Lowell, Fitzgerald, and Sisson, compiled by Richard Stoneman.'7 As engaging as the actual trans- lations are the Introduction (pp. 1-31) and the brief remarks introducing each translator: among the Victorians we have, for example, William Sewell who emigrated 'to avoid his creditors', Newman whose translations 'severely misrepresent the originals as well as being largely unreadable, though sometimes comic', Cory 'compelled to leave Eton', Calverley who 'fell on his head while skating and was incapacitated from serious work for the rest of his life', and Conington a convert 'to religion, to conservatism and to Pusey' (and the possessor, moreover, of an 'irritable temper'), and I mention a mere five out of 26. But Stoneman can be generous in judgement (even too generous to, e.g., Gilbert Murray) just as he is generous in presenting the work of so many, nearly 150 in fact, translators. The result is a splendid anthology. P. WALCOT NOTES 1. Through Greek Eyes. Ancient Greek Civilisation in the Words of Greek Writers.
