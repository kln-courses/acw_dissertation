In a month she will have spun enough yarn to make a poncho of the type worn by the men of her community for more than three millennia. Like her mother and her grandmother before her, Margarita Farfán, a Mochica, has spent the better part of a lifetime providing her family with clothes, blankets, saddlebags, and fishing nets, all woven of naturally pigmented cotton in shades of rust, beige, mauve, and chocolate. The cultivation of multicolored cotton, algodón nativo ( Gossypium barbadense ), has been an integral part of Andean culture for millennia. Three-thousand-year-old mummies preserved in Peru's coastal sand dunes were wrapped in layer upon layer of colored cotton fabric; royalty buried in 1,500-year-old tombs at the Moche site of Sipán in the Reque Valley were draped in cotton shrouds and wore tunics of the native fiber bearing intricate anthropomorphic figures woven in dark choco- late; and, at the 4,500-year-old site of Huaca Prieta in northern Peru's Lower Chicama Valley, archaeologist Junius B. Bird recovered more than 9,000 textile frag- ments, presumably from mummy wrappings and funer- ary offerings, most of which were woven of cotton. At all of these sites, the cotton textiles had retained their natural pigmentation. Text By Angela M.H. Schuster Photographs by H.

Spindles of cotton and chalk Known for its long staple and colorful fibers, algo- dón nativo is naturally resistant to insects, and thrives on the eastern slopes of the Andes 3,000 feet above sea level, an elevation at which other varieties of cotton fail. The plant's deep root system allows it to survive on Peru's arid north coast, which receives less than one inch of rainfall per year. To grow the cotton and pro- duce a textile from it is time-consuming and arduous, especially if ginning (removing the seeds), carding (cleaning and straightening the fiber), and spinning are done by hand, as they are to this day in remote villages of Peru. In antiquity an estimated ten percent of the land under cultivation was devoted to algodón nativo. Today, it grows only in small family gardens along with native food crops, and sometimes wild along country roads. Margarita Farfan and her seven daughters are among the last to spin and weave it. Peru's once domi- nant fiber has been displaced by the more familiar white tanguis and pima cottons - cultivated for their high yield, strong fiber, and ease of spinning - and commercially produced synthetics. In recent decades much of the farmland in the nearby Andean foothills, once used to grow the native cotton, has been turned over to coca leaf. A far more lucrative crop, it is Peru's leading agricultural export, supplying some 60 percent of the world market for cocaine. Though extensive research has been carried out on Peru's highland textiles, most of which are woven of fibers from camelids - alpaca, llama, and vicuña - until An Ancient Tradition Several days before it is ginned, freshly picked cotton is laid out to cure in the sunlight. While paler shades of mauve and beige give up their seeds easily, the frag- ile rust and chocolate fibers, whose seeds are firmly embedded, are difficult to gin by hand. Cleaned locks of cotton are stretched out, flattened, and gathered into bundles weighing as much as a pound. These are beaten flat with sticks, fold- ed, and beaten again until the fibers are smooth and homo- geneous. The flattened bundles are rolled into cones. The spinning process is simple. A spindle is held in a horizontal or slightly inclined position while fibers are drawn from a cone of cotton tied to a stationary post, or distaff, or held in place under a heavy object such as a large stone. Cotton spinners on the north coast use smaller and lighter spindles (the sticks around which yarn is wound) and whorls (spindle weights) than those in the highlands, who work longer and heavier camelid fibers. Both cotton and camelid textiles are woven on a traditional backstrap loom I anchored to a wall or tree.- -A.M.H.S. 42 Archaeology</page><page sequence="4">lo enhance their beauty , some Mochica women plait choco - late-colored cotton yarn through their hair. recently little was known about the textiles of the north coast, especially those woven of multicolored cotton. To document Preconquest use of the colored cotton fibers, anthropologist James Vreeland of the University of Texas, Austin, began working with traditional weavers in several coastal communities in the departments of Piura and Lambayeque. In two villages, Mórrope and Ferreñafe, he found that women still cultivated, spun, and wove the colored cotton and that more than three- quarters of them had worked the fiber in their youth. In documenting their methods of cultivation and the equipment used to spin and weave - distaffs, spindles, whorls, and looms - Vreeland noticed that in nearly every respect the tools and techniques were Pre- columbian in origin, attesting an unbroken textile tradi- tion in the region. Vreeland's ethnographic research provided clues to an enigmatic archaeological find. During the 1970s archaeologists working in the Jequetepeque Valley had collected soil samples from a pre-Inka field system abandoned ca. A.D. 1250. Along with seeds of cotton and various squashes, crops traditionally grown in close proximity, they recovered remnants of the woody shrub Lippia sp., a relative of lemon verbena that seemed to serve no useful purpose. In a recent conversation with an elderly farmer in the Piura Valley, Vreeland learned that peasants in the area grow the shrub near their cot- ton plants as a pesticide; smoke from burning these shrubs kills and repels a number of insects harmful to the plants. In addition to its value as a textile fiber, algodón nativo has played an important role in traditional Mochica medicine, where it is still used to cure* a host of illnesses. Recent research has revealed that cotton seed is rich in antibiotics, which may explain its wide- spread use in folk remedies. Women also use the ash of burned cotton to cure spider bites and tuck small wads of the chocolate fiber in their clothing for protection against mal de ojo , the evil eye. In some communities a small pad of the dark brown cotton is placed on a new- born's head to protect it from the nocturnal hoot of the two-horned owl, a sound thought to be capable of split- ting open an infant's fragile skull. Vreeland also found that coastal fishermen still made nets of chocolate-col- ored cotton similar to those recovered by Junius Bird at Huaca Prieta. When he inquired about this use of the fiber, one octogenarian fisherman told him that nets made of the dark cotton are invisible to fish, especially those swimming near the surface. What for Vreeland began as research into ancient textile production soon became a personal campaign to revitalize Peru's native cotton tradition. "The gene stock is here," he says, "as well as the knowledge of Prehis- panic farming techniques that are less destructive than modern practices, which rely on fertilizers, harmful pes- ticides, and overtilling of the soil." In 1984 he co- founded La Sociedad de Investigación de la Ciencia, Cultura, y Arte Norteño (SICAN), a nonprofit research institution, to promote a return to Precölumbian land- management techniques and provide a profitable alter- native to growing coca leaf. With support from several nongovernmental organizations, Vreeland collected seed from family gardens and abandoned fields, and, with the help of peasant families, local graduate students, and Peruvian scientists, he planted 11 farmyard plots. Fiber generated from these plots was given to artisans to weave into traditional garments and blankets that were sold to handicraft stores in Lima and museum shops in the United States. Vreeland and his colleagues also began testing the fiber on modern spinning machines. The dark cotton tended to break when spun on machines. By blending the fiber with organically grown white cotton, they were able to strengthen it. Last year some 500 families, both on the coast and in the Andean foothills, were involved in growing and weaving the native cotton, and the number is expected to double this year. Because the fibers and textiles are produced without chemical fertilizers, pesticides, or commercial dyes and fabric softeners, they have been favorably received by the environmentally minded in the United States, Europe, and Japan. Retailers such as L.L. Bean and Lands' End now carry socks and under- wear made from the colored cotton. Vreeland, however, faces strong opposition from drug cartels and commer- cial cotton producers. "It has been difficult to compete with coca as a cash crop," he says, "since it can yield $3,000-$4,000 per hectare [2.5 acres] annually, four times what a farmer can make from cotton, even if it is July/ August 1995 43</page><page sequence="5">Working on a traditional backstrap loom , Esperanza Pisfil Capuñay weaves dowries for the young women of her village .

The United States Drug Enforce- ment Administration estimates that Peru now has more than 130,000 hectares under coca cultivation compared to 100,000 hectares for commercial cotton. Until recently farmers were heavily fined for cultivating algo- dón nativo in areas where tanguis and pima were grown for export. Commercial cotton producers feared cross pollination, resulting in undesirable intermediate varieties, weaker fibers, and muddied colors unàccept- able in the highly competitive industrial market. Meanwhile, farmers are under extreme pressure from the drug cartels to grow the coca leaf and to produce coca paste and refine cocaine from it. One ginning com- pany processing algodón nativo found rifle cartridges in its machines, presumably intended to damage the equip- ment. "But there is a quality-of-life issue here that many of the farmers are just now beginning to see," says Vree- land. "Though they earn more money growing coca leaf, it costs significantly more to provide for their fami- lies, since they have to purchase the food they once grew themselves. Moreover, being in business with the cartels places a great amount of strain on family life." Cultivation regulations, the drug trade, and recent torrential rain and flash floods brought by El Niño - a climatic phenomenon caused by a periodic change in the Peru Current that runs along the Pacific coast - have significantly depleted the native cotton gene stock. In antiquity, Peruvians stored cotton seed so that crops could be replenished in the event of a disaster. During the past century, there has been virtually no preserva- tion of seed stock. To remedy this, Vreeland and his colleagues collected seeds from throughout Peru hoping to recoup colors lost in antiquity. In 1992 SIC AN suc- ceeded in having native cotton declared a national plant patrimony under Peru's 1990 Environmental Code, and it can now be grown anywhere without penalty. While peasant farmers are producing native cotton for export, personal use of the fiber among the indige- nous population has declined. The villages of Mórrope and Ferreñafe, once isolated from mainstream Peruvian culture, are now connected by new roads to the Panamerican Highway. Villagers who once wore gar- ments made of native cotton now prefer blue jeans and Michael Jackson T-shirts. Esperanza Pisfil Capuñay is a weaver in Monsefú, a small town south of Chiclayo. She makes her living weaving dowries - tablecloths, napkins, bed linens, and doilies. "A generation ago women provided their own dowries," she says, "but today many of the young girls are going to work in Lima, Piura, or Trujillo and do not have the time or the inclination to spin and weave." Though the tradition of presenting a groom's family with a dowry remains strong, it is women like Esperanza who produce it. Weaving on a traditional backstrap loom, she works primarily with imported cotton fiber in brilliant shades of pink and green. She prefers the ani- line-dyed cotton yarn, which she has to purchase, to the native cotton that grows wild near her house because the indigenous fiber is time-consuming and difficult to work. Commercially spun yarns, she says, are inexpen- sive and readily available at the locad market. The most important factor, however, is color. "Only the elderly still wear the brown and mauve," she says. "It's old-fash- ioned." While use of native cotton in the villages of the north coast may end with the demise of the older generation, 44 Archaeology</page><page sequence="6">the technology is being kept alive by a group of weavers in Chiclayo, who have found a growing market in repli- cating and restoring ancient textiles for museums. Clemencia Cabrera de Bautista is the director of the Puchka Cooperative, a weavers' group formed in 1983 to manufacture blankets and ponchos for the tourist trade. "They are producing beautiful goods," says Vree- land, "but they are in no way 'traditional.' Most of the Puchka weavers came from the highlands and originally worked in alpaca and llama wool. They were taught how to spin and weave algodón nativo by Margarita Farfán and her daughters. As a result, they are now producing cotton items whose designs are of highland origin." Cabrera agrees that the co-op has re-created many of the ancient highland patterns and that their work does not represent a continuity with the past. However, she says her weavers understand the methods used millennia ago and are comfortable deciphering lowland textiles and fragments found in excavations and replicating them. Their work can be seen in the Royal Tombs of Sipàri exhibition now touring the United States. While traditional spinning and weaving by hand are on the decline, Vreeland hopes that algodón nativo will prove a workable alternative to coca leaf. This past year sales of the fiber grown by the Indians exceeded $1 mil- lion and he expects to have some 10,000 hectares under cultivation next year. If he and others can continue to interest foreign markets in buying Peru's unique strain of cotton, it is conceivable that one of South America's oldest cultivars will one day help sustain a country now in urgent need of an alternative export. ■ July/August 1995 45</page></plain_text>
