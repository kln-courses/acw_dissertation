<plain_text><page sequence="1">JJQ Possible Worlds Theory and the Fantasy Universe of Finnegans Wake Margot Norris Volume 44.3 (Spring 2007) In the first chapter of his Narrative Design in "Finnegans Wake," Harry Burrell points to one of the central tensions in the history of Wake criticism by heading his discussion with the single word "Narrative?"1 He writes that "David Hayman, Bernard Benstock, John Bishop, and Margot Norris, for example, have all concluded that there is no underlying narrative and have evolved different systems of dealing with the dilemma" (8). In contrast, he notes, Fritz Senn and Clive Hart continue to yearn for the text's deep structural meaning to be disclosed (8). Burrell's study offers that deep struc tural meaning by treating the Wake as Joyce's rewriting of the Bible and creation of "a new theology" (7)—a claim that, in many respects, harks back to a founding text of Wake criticism: Joseph Campbell and Henry Morton Robinson's 1944 A Skeleton Key to "Finnegans Wake."2 But however provocative its argument, Burrell's study does not end the controversy over the "Narrative?" of Finnegans Wake nor does it engage the question of the Wake's narrative in a theoretical way. Yet the present moment in the early twenty-first century is particularly opportune for narratological study of avant-garde texts, thanks to a new development in the field that offers tools for more rigorously conceptualizing the nature of fiction itself. Called "Possible Worlds" theory, a branch of narratology that addresses "the fictionality of fic tional worlds" has blossomed in the last fifteen years.3 Gerald Prince gives the following explanation of "possible worlds" in his Dictionary of Narratology: "Narratives comprise temporally ordered sequences of states of affairs that are taken to be actual/factual ('what happens') and that are linked to other states of affairs considered non-actual or counterfactual and constituted by the mental activity of various char acters (their beliefs, wishes, plans, hallucinations, fantasies, etc.)."4 The posited separation between what theorist Marie-Laure Ryan calls a "[t]extual actual world" (n.p.) and the nonactual "worlds" that belong to the minds of characters in fiction can be readily recognized in a genre like realism. Ulysses is full of events that are assumed to be "factual" and to occur in the "actual" 1904 Dublin world posited within the novel—events like Bloom cooking breakfast at 7 Eccles James Joyce Quarterly, Volume 50, Number 1-2 (Fall 2012-Winter 2013), pp. 413-432.

These events are not, in fact, actual or factual in the sense that they historically occurred in the real world, but Joyce's novel Ulysses pretends that they did. This pretended textual actual world in Ulysses is simultaneously con nected to the virtual worlds—or possible worlds—of its characters' ruminations, memories, fantasies, and stories. But how do actual and possible worlds function in the fictional realm of Finnegans Wake? Possible Worlds theory offers tools to analyze the Wake's narrative and fictional operation with greater rigor than before. This essay offers an introduction to such an analysis, though it defers exploring the content or significance of the ontological realms that the analysis discloses. The question of whether Fintiegans Wake exhibits anything resem bling an "actual" or "factual" textual world—analogous to the richly imagined 1904 world of Dublin and its inhabitants in Ulysses—has, of course, been an issue in Wake criticism from the very beginning. Edmund Wilson's 1939 essay, "The Dream of H. C. Earwicker," pos ited a model in which the tavern in Book III functions as the site of an actual world in the Wake: It is a Saturday night in summer, after a disorderly evening in the pub. Somebody—probably Earwicker himself—has been prevailed upon to sing a song: later, when it was closing time, he had to put a man outside, who abused him and threw stones at the window. There has also been a thunderstorm. Earwicker has been drinking off and on all day and has perhaps gone to bed a little drunk. At any rate, his night is troubled. At first he dreams about the day before, with a bad conscience and a sense of humiliation: then, as the night darkens and he sinks more deeply into sleep, he has to labor through a nightmare oppression.5 By 1962, however, Hart disputed Wilson's model on the ground that "there is nothing whatever in the text to suggest that Books I and II are a dream of the protagonist whose sleep begins at 403.17."6 Nonetheless, nearly twenty-five years later, John Gordon's "Finnegans Wake": A Plot Summary revived "the hypothesis that the Joyce of Finnegans Wake had not turned his back on the aggressive realism of the earlier books," and he offered "to recount the events of Joyce's book in their order of occurrence, and to describe as accurately as possible the place and the people involved in the action."7 While his study has far more subtlety than these premises suggest, Gordon nonetheless makes good on his promise to recover from the Wake a plausible realism. He offers an unequivocal time for its events: "The date of Finnegans Wake is Monday, the twenty-first of March, 1938, and the early morning of Tuesday the twenty-second" (37). With equal clarity, he offers a setting for the work: "Finnegans Wake is set 414</page><page sequence="3">in Chapelizod" in "a building called the Mullingar House" (9, 10). He describes the three-story structure in which the Wake family lives, complete with its furnishings, and offers a charming drawing of the parents' bedroom as seen from the vantage of the ceiling, featuring a bearskin rug and patchwork quilt on the bed (34). Because both Burrell and Gordon specifically address themselves to the nature of the Wake's narrative, they will serve as my point of departure for exploring an alternative analysis of the problems it poses. Gordon's plot summary is as engaging as Burrell's Biblical narra tive a decade later, but neither discusses with sufficient clarity how their reductive accounts can actually be derived from the text's trou blesome and unconventional semantic structure. "Possible Worlds" theorist Lubomir Dolezel suggests a possible explanation. "In liter ary criticism, two interpretive methods are commonly practiced," he writes: "The first one is intuitive and subjectivistic. A meaning is suggested that the critic feels or believes to be 'hidden' in the text; the text is made to mean what the interpreter wants it to mean" (173). The second common interpretive method is ideological—having one's ideology prompt interpretation—and it does not apply to Gordon or Burrell. But while neither of these Wake critics operates purely subjectively and both base their readings on meticulous assemblies of textual evidence, they do appear to share the premise that, because meaning fails to be accessible from the textual surface, it must be semantically "hidden." I will later return to look more closely at the features of the text that appear to invite such readings as Gordon's and Burrell's but wish now to turn to the possibility of a different interpretive procedure for exploring the Wake's fictional worlds. If one argues that the text semantically represents a mental or a vir tual world in its entirety, how can such an argument be justified not merely on intuitive but on logical grounds? This is where "Possible Worlds" theory offers two sets of extremely useful conceptual tools. The first consists of a list of criteria that define the way readers in an actual world are able to achieve mental access to fictional worlds. Ryan calls these criteria accessibility relations, and they include identity of properties, identity of inventory, compatibility of inven tory, chronological compatibility, physical compatibility, taxonomic compatibility, logical compatibility, analytical compatibility, and lin guistic compatibility (32, 33). These accessibility relations give Ryan a conceptual basis for distinguishing fictional genres—pinpointing with some precision the difference between fairy tales and realistic novels, for example—and they can thereby help us to address more rigorously the generic features of Finnegans Wake. Ryan's second set of conceptual tools may be found in her categorization of virtual domains within fiction as private or possible (nonfactual) worlds that she calls "knowledge-worlds" ("K-world"), "obligation-worlds" 415</page><page sequence="4">James Joyce Quarterly 50.1-2 2012-2013 ("O-world"), and "wish-worlds" ("W-world") (111).8 When these private worlds lose their connection to an actual world in a work of fiction, the result is a re-centering into different ontological realms that Ryan calls "fantasy-worlds" or "F-universes" (111, 119). Not only does Finnegans Wake represent such an "F-universe" but the concept of possible worlds can help us to sort out the ontological realms that conflict and collide in these worlds—collisions that usurp the roles narrative and plot play in more conventional fiction. By confining a demonstration to just one chapter of Finnegans Wake—Book I, chapter 1—I will use both Ryan's accessibility relations and her private-world or possible-world modalities to produce a clearer sense of how, pre cisely, the Wake functions as a work of fiction. Ryan's accessibility relations will reveal little about Wake language that the work's readers have not already figured out intuitively. But while little that results from the analysis they produce will be surpris ing, Ryan's categories nonetheless oblige us to deal more precisely with the surface texture of Finnegans Wake and to address its implica tions for genre and the nature of its fictional worlds. According to Ryan, there are three accessibility relations that all but a very few genres of fiction share, and these are "linguistic compatibility," "logi cal compatibility," and "analytical compatibility" (34). Linguistic com patibility postulates that fictional domains in a text will be accessible from our actual world if the language of the text can be understood in the actual world. This compatibility can be found not only in realistic fiction but also in science fiction, fairy tales, legends, and works of fantasy. Ryan lists only two genres in which linguistic compatibility fails to pertain: what she calls "Jabberwockism" and "[s]ound poet ry" (34). Humpty Dumpty's poem "Jabberwocky" begins, as Ryan observes, "Twas brillig, and the slithy toves/Did gyre and gimble in the wabe" (39).9 Ryan's example of a sound poem, taken from Hugo Ball, contains such phrases as "gadjiberi bimba glandridi lonni cadori" and so on (39).10 Lewis Carroll's "Jabberwocky" restricts its incompatibility with English chiefly to nouns and verbs, Ryan notes, and therefore exhibits a compromised but not a total linguistic incompatibility. Ball's poem, in contrast, is seemingly incompat ible with any known language. Finnegans Wake shares some of the compromised linguistic compatibility of "Jabberwocky" although its unintelligible words are not necessarily restricted to nouns and verbs and may be capable of analysis and interpretation. The syntax of the following line is English—"we hear also through successive ages that shebby choruysh of unkalified muzzlenimiissilehims that would blackguardise the whitestone ever hurtleturtled out of heaven" (FW 5.15-18)—and several of the line's unfamiliar words can be interpret ed by analogy. Roland McHugh readily glosses "shebby choruysh of unkalified muzzlenimiissilehims" as "shabby chorus of unqualified 416</page><page sequence="5">Moslems/'11 although the portmanteau structure allows additional meanings to be imputed to the words as well. "[U]nkalified," for example, could also be glossed as "un-caliph-ied" or "uncalcified." We can thus concede that, in spite of its many portmanteaus and neologisms, the Wake exhibits general linguistic compatibility with English. Analytical compatibility holds that the textual actual world is accessible from our world if "objects designated by the same words have the same essential properties," as Ryan notes (33). The words "hurtle" and "turtle" in "hurtleturtled" presumably have the same general meaning and allude to the same properties in the Wake as they do when the words are used in reference to our actual world. It is their conjunction that strains analytical compatibility since turtles do not generally hurtle, except perhaps when they capsize. Logical compatibility becomes even trickier. This accessibility relation stipu lates that the textual actual world is accessible from the actual world if both worlds respect the principles of noncontradiction and of the excluded middle.12 Ryan's example of a work of fiction that violates logical compatibility is Robert Pinget's Le Libera in which "a certain character is dead, and thirty pages later ... he is alive" (38).13 If, like the man in the song "Tim Finnegan's Wake," a character in the Wake text is indeed simultaneously dead and alive, then the principle of noncontradiction and the relation of logical compatibility are vio lated. When we consider such accessibility relations as identity of properties, physical compatibility, and taxonomic compatibility, we encounter a world in Book I, chapter 1, whose generic features fail to conform to fictional realism. Identity of properties posits that objects common to the textual actual world and our actual world have the same properties. Physical compatibility assumes that the physical laws of our actual world will pertain in the textual actual world. Taxonomic compatibility makes the textual actual world accessible from our actual world if it contains the same species, and species with the same properties, as our actual world. These categories appear to some degree related in terms of their manifestation (and violation) in the Wake, as we can see in the apparent instances of shape-shifting in the text. In her early appearances in chapter 1, the female figure we later call Anna Livia Plurabelle is indeterminate with respect to her species. "We nowhere she lives," the narration tells us, although it is unclear if her "candlelittle houthse of a month and one windies" is indeed a human habitation on a hill or a down ("Downadown, High Downadown"—FW 10.28) or an effigy of a house (FW 10.26, 27-28). Her home could be an ornament like a cuckoo clock or a barometric device in which little figures mechanically move in and out of a little house. In this case, ALP's species would be a manufactured bird or 417</page><page sequence="6">James Joyce Quarterly 50.1-2 2012-2013 human effigy rather than a female person. On the other hand, the description of "that gnarlybird ygathering, a runalittle, doalittle, preealittle . . . helfalittle, pelfalittle gnarlybird" is far too active for a cuckoo-clock bird although its motions are still a little too mechanical to verify that she is here a natural avian species (FW 10.31-34). A little later, however, she is more clearly a human woman, however comi cal, "livving in our midst of debt and laffing through all plores for us" (FW 11.32-33). And when the narration returns her to the shore after the deluge, we see her building a peat fire and doing all "a turf woman can to piff the business on" (FW 12.11). If ALP is both a hen and a woman, then her properties do not conform to those of the real world, and physical, taxonomic, and logical compatibility are all vio lated. This female dual identity is not precisely shape-shifting, how ever, because we do not actually see her transformed into a hen and back again.14 But neither can we account for it as purely metaphorical with any certainty. The little hen is too vivid on the one hand, and the woman too caricatured on the other, to clarify which is "real" and which is merely a gloss on the other. According to Ryan, a metaphor does not relocate us into a different fictional world but merely gives us a new perspective on a particular entity (82). So, is ALP like a hen as she scavenges and picks up bits of detritus on her scurrying walk, or does she actually appear as a hen? Critics generally treat the dis tinction as an irrelevancy, even when, as in chapter 8, ALP's identity with the river egregiously violates taxonomic compatibility. Gordon, for example, concedes the fluid identity of the female figure but none theless privileges the anthropomorphic side of "ALP-as-river" (64). In the sixth chapter of Book I, the riddles and problems with physi cal, taxonomic, and logical compatibility continue to intensify the nonrealistic features of the Wake's fiction. The Mookse and the Gripes appear to offer indeterminate species, since the properties of the Gripes, for example, suggest a talking grape or a raisin "parched on a limb. ... fit to be dried" (FW 153.10-11). If so, its taxonomy certainly violates physical laws. This suggests that Finnegans Wake generically resembles a fairy tale or the fantasy genre of the Wonderland sec tions of Lewis Carroll's Alice books. The tale of the Mookse and the Gripes, however, is embedded in the lecture of the protean instruc tor, "Professor Loewy-Brueller," who offers it to his "muddlecrass pupils" as an "easyfree translation of the old fabulist's parable" (FW 150.15, 152.08, 12-13). The figures in fables such as Aesop's are patently offered as heuristic devices in the service of illustration and therefore enjoy only a provisional fictional status.15 Regarding the Wake as a generic fairy tale raises a different problem. Ryan points out that traditional fairy tales are genres in which taxonomic and physical compatibility with the actual world has indeed been waived—to pro duce dragons, fairies, unicorns, and talking frogs. But another acces 418</page><page sequence="7">sibility relation—chronological compatibility—generally remains in place. Traditional fairy tales are located, she comments, in a consistent mythical past whose classes of objects are those of "preindustrial societies: cottages rather than condominiums, swords rather than guns, and horses as a primary mode of transportation" (37). But as early as Book I, chapter 1, chronological compatibility appears to be violated in the Wake. From the beginning of the chapter, the narrative voice offers both a geographical or spatial survey and a historical or chronological survey. Although the voice appears spatially located in and around Dublin, its moment in time is less clearly defined. We might call its historical indeterminacy a kind of temporal no-man's land, were it not for two notable accounts in which the narrative voice appears to function as a present witness to a scene whose general historical era can be identified. These two scenes—the first in the Wellington Museum or Museyroom and the second on a pre historic mound—are neither chronologically consistent nor logically consecutive. Although the account of the battle of Waterloo is vivid, its dramatic quality comes chiefly from the description and narra tive interpretation of artifacts and representations in the museum display. A guide points to Wellington's dispatch book—"This is the Willingdone's hurold dispitchback"—and proceeds dramatically to relate one of the French messages—"Figtreeyou! Damn fairy ann, Voutre. Willingdone" (FW 9.11-12, 13-14). The narrator's presence in such a museum dates the tour as occurring after the eighteenth centu ry. The visit to the primitive cave littered with gnawed bones that fol lows this some six pages later consequently offers a relocation in time, a kind of time-travel without transition to a distant past. Here the narrative voice approaches a human creature described as a "dragon man" whose language he must establish before he can engage him in conversation—"You tolkatiff scowegian? Nn" (FW 15.34, 16.06). A narrator located in two different time frames further contributes to the negation of a textual actual world in the Wake}6 Since Finnegans Wake does not exhibit a textual actual world (as Ulysses does), it is most plausibly categorized as a fantasy universe within Ryan's system of fictionality. She writes, "A last type of pri vate sphere involved in narrative semantics is formed by the mind's creations: dreams, hallucinations, fantasies, and fictional stories told to or composed by the characters. These constructs are not simply satellites of TAW [textual actual worlds], but complete universes, and they are reached by characters through a recentering" (119). This description is compatible with analyses that treat Finnegans Wake as a fictional dream experience disconnected from a waking figure in a waking textual reality or waking actual world. Ryan points out, however, that a fantasy universe may contain its own textual actual worlds surrounded by private or possible worlds: "By virtue of the 419</page><page sequence="8">James Joyce Quarterly 50.1-2 2012-2013 inherent recursivity of recentering, the members of F-worlds [fan tasy-worlds] have at their disposal the entire array of world-creating activities: the characters in a dream may dream, the heroes of fictional fictions may write fictions" (119). Returning to Book I, chapter 1, we can now identify its narrative shift from museum to prehistoric mound as an external recentering from one provisional textual actual world to another. In other words, the Museyroom feels actual or factual for the duration of the tour, with the guiding voice warning visitors to "[m]ind your hats goan in!" and, once inside, pointing to various objects—"This is the flag. . . . This is the bullet. .. . This is the triplewon hat of Lipoleum" (FW 8.09,12-16). This sense of immediate presence is intensified by reference to sensation, a complaint about the warmth of the museum's enclosed space contrasted with the relief of the cool air outside—"What a warm time we were in there but how keling is here the airabouts!" (FW 10.25-26). The same feeling of a provisional actual world will pertain on the prehistoric mound, as the narrative voice describes the "carl on the kopje in pelted thongs" who is "slaking nuncheon out of some thing's brain pan" and takes us on a closer approach (FW 15.29, 33-34). The word "kopje" identifies the place as a small hill in South Africa occupied by a "kraal" or enclo sure for cattle: "Lets we overstep his fire defences and these kraals of slitsucked marrogbones. (Cave!)" (FW 16.02-03). As in a dream, the narrative consciousness can move (or be recentered) from one geo graphical and temporal scene to a totally different one without being grounded in an external textual actual world. In this sense, the Wake is like Wonderland minus the Victorian setting that precedes Alice's falling asleep and dreaming and that returns her to a more or less realistic setting again upon waking. The Wake world will therefore be virtual in its entirety—made up entirely of private or possible worlds marked by the further recursivity that Ryan has noted.17 Its narrative consciousness is able to tell and read stories, to recall memories, to foresee events, and to describe itself as dreaming. "And as I was jog ging along in a dream as dozing I was dawdling, arrah, methought broadtone was heard . . . Shaun! Shaun! Post the post!" (FW 404.03 07), the narrative voice tells us in Book III. The Wake has many such embedded accounts, and Ryan writes, "Embedded narratives, as we have seen, are mental representations produced by characters. They are called virtual when they are not verified in the factual domain" (168). The peculiarity of the Finnegans Wake world may be ascribed to its status as an entirely virtual construction that makes no attempt to present itself as actual but rather flaunts its virtuality. What then are these possible worlds that comprise the fictional world of Finnegans Wake? If we look at the beginning of the first chap ter, we may question whether the textual domain is quite as private as a conventional possible world constructed in the mind of a novelistic 420</page><page sequence="9">character. The Wake's initial narrative voice is anonymous and gives itself no distinguishing features that might characterize it as a specific individual. In this respect, it appears to function like a third-person narrator—a position in fiction that carries with it both authority and what Dolezel calls an "authenticating" function: "[E]ntities intro duced in the discourse of the anonymous third-person narrator are eo ipso authenticated as fictional facts, while those introduced in the discourse of the fictional persons are not" (149). Is the opening of the Wake a conventional third-person narration after all, describing for the reader an actual or factual world? If not, why not? It is tell ing that Joyce gives the initial narrative voice of Finnegans Wake the rhetorical inflection of a tour guide, because such a discourse carries with it the implied promise of authoritative knowledge grounded in factuality, offering history rather than fiction, promising clarity rather than obfuscation. Yet these premises are effectively violated from the beginning. If the first paragraph offers us a plausible spatial orientation—a description of the course of the river Liffey winding its way past the church of Adam and Eve to Howth Castle and its environs—the second paragraph offers an unsettled temporal orientation. It alludes to events that have not yet occurred: "nor had topsawyer's rocks by the stream Oconee exaggerated themselse"; "not yet, though venis soon after, had a kidscad buttended a bland old isaac"; and "not yet, though all's fair in vanessy, were sosie sesthers wroth with twone nathandjoe" (FW 3.06-07, 10-11, 3.11-12). Without being identified or described, the putative inaugural events of the Wake's narrative are, curiously, post-dated. If the narrative voice aims to function like a tour guide, it perversely replaces a historical time frame with an inde terminable temporal relativity. A fundamental condition of narrative is violated at the outset: the condition that offers "temporally ordered sequences of states of affairs that are taken to be actual/factual ('what happens')," to cite Prince again (77). What further intensifies the effect of this initial narrative dis-orientation, and its displacement of orien tation, is the impact of the various violated accessibility relations. For one, tour guides can only be effective if they speak in the language of their audience, and yet this voice speaks English that is simultane ously not-precisely-English. Such partial linguistic incompatibility inserts a pronounced linguistic static into the discourse. From the first page on, the narrative voice is nonauthoritative and speaks not from the ground of an actual world but from the ground of an idiosyncratic knowledge-world. As the chapter proceeds, it becomes clear that the narrator's knowledge-world is bedeviled by a paradox. On the one hand, the knowledge which preoccupies it concerns public lore—the kind of "social representations" that Dolezel finds in "scientific knowledge, 421</page><page sequence="10">James Joyce Quarterly 50.1-2 2012-2013 ideologies, religions, cultural myths" (126). On the other, this knowl edge is both deployed and pursued through epistemic processes that typically characterize subjective knowledge-worlds in fiction. A character's thoughts, like Leopold Bloom's in Ulysses, for example, can jump around from one bit of knowledge to another, linked by association rather than causal logic. In the Wake, the "fall" off the wall on the first page is described as producing a giant figure sprawled across the landscape "where oranges have been laid to rust upon the green since devlinsfirst loved livvy" (FW 3.15, 23-24). The Irish con flicts symbolized by the colors of orange (from the Protestant William of Orange) and green (associated with St. Patrick's shamrock) trigger thoughts of even earlier conflicts, between Ostrogoths and Visigoths or between oyster totems and fish totems—"What clashes here of wills gen wonts, oystrygods gaggin fishygods!" (FW 4.01-02). The end of conflict suggests a return to a landscape of fallen and resurgent trees: "The oaks of aid now they lie in peat yet elms leap where askes lay" (FW 4.14-15). Thoughts of the fall trigger thoughts of conflict that return back to thoughts of fall and rising again. The Wakean knowl edge-world is, therefore, a strange hybrid of public knowledge and private thought-processes that fail to function as epistemic operators generally do in fiction. Dolezel writes of fictional characters, "The person's practical reasoning and, consequently, his or her acting and interacting are to a high degree determined by this epistemic perspective, by what the agent knows, is ignorant of, and believes to be the case in the world" (126). But although chapter 1 of the Wake appears to harbor an enigma—"What then agentlike brought about that tragoady thundersday this municipal sin business?" (FW 5.13 14)—the text fails to conform to those kinds of genres, such as the mystery novel, in which the secret becomes the spur to an epistemic narrative. Nor will it produce the kind of inner or outer searching which leads from ignorance or false beliefs to psychological or moral truths in the Bildungsroman or some types of Victorian fiction. The problem is partly that the "municipal sin business" is not defined as a factual incident whose unknown causes, agents, or perpetra tors can be intellectually pursued and revealed; but it is also that the knowledge-world of the chapter is here yoked to the invocation of an obligation-world, whose criteria of social rules and moral principles are equally impenetrable. Dolezel refers to obligation-worlds as the effect of "deontic" con straints in the form of proscriptive and prescriptive norms operative in fictional worlds: "the norms determine which actions are prohib ited, obligatory, or permitted" (120). He goes on to say that "[t]he deontic marking of actions is the richest source of narrativity; it gen erates the famous triad of the fall (violation of a norm—punishment), the test (obligation fulfilled—reward), and the predicament (conflict 422</page><page sequence="11">of obligations), stories retold again and again, from myths and fairy tales to contemporary fiction" (121). The first page of Finnegans Wake virtually predicts this metanarrative description in its announcement of the fall: "The fall... of a once wallstrait oldparr is retaled early in bed and later on life down through all christian minstrelsy" (FW 3.15 18). For Burrell, this provides the key to the Wake: "The search for 'a simple text' as well as a 'germinal deep structure' is revealed in the second and third chapters of Genesis, which tell the Judeo-Christian version of the Fall of Man" (9). There are indeed many allusions to transgressions, guilt, failings, and the like in the first chapter of Joyce's book, but the conflation of knowledge- and obligation-worlds ensures that the deontic norms at issue are placed in question even as they are narrativized. It is as though the narrative voice asks not only what brought about "this municipal sin business" but who sinned, why did they sin, and—most vexingly—what precisely was the sin? One of the first narrative stories that supposedly represents the fall tells of "Bygmester Finnegan, of the Stuttering Hand," who appears to live in—or prior to—Burrell's Biblical realm "before joshuan judges had given us numbers or Helviticus committed deuteronomy" (FW 4.18, 20-21). But is Finnegan described as building a skyscraper too high and tumbling down, or merely imagining, perhaps in an alco holic haze ("he seesaw by neatlight of the liquor"—FW 4.33-34), "a waalworth of a skyerscape of most eyeful hoyth entowerly, erigenat ing from next to nothing and celescalating the himals" (FW 4.35-5.01). The fall, in this anecdote, if there is one, is described as "larrons o'toolers clittering up and tombles a'buckets clottering down" or tools going up and buckets tumbling down (FW 5.03-04)—or is it Lawrence O'Toole, Dublin's patron saint, going up and his contempo rary Thomas a Becket tumbling down? Does Bygmester Finnegan, the character of this anecdote, rise and fall as he does in the ballad or only imagine a rising and falling? And if he does rise and fall, what norm has been transgressed? Multiple possibilities are suggested, from masturbation (the "Stuttering Hand" and the "overalls which he hab itacularly fondseed"—FW 4.31) to freemasonry, drunkenness ("all the guenneses had met their exodus"—FW 4.24), or, like Henrik Ibsen's Masterbuilder, ambition and hubris. The narrative knowledge-world is obstructed in its insight by linguistic static and by the possible virtuality of what is described—that is, fantasy, dream, or imagining rather than the commission of an action. Neither the tour through the Wellington Museum nor the interview of the figure on the prehistoric mound yields information or knowl edge that sketches in the nature of the Wake's obligation-world. In this respect, the Wake contrasts dramatically with fictions that make their obligation-worlds perfectly clear—for example, Joyce's A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man. The case of Charles Stewart Parnell in 423</page><page sequence="12">James Joyce Quarterly 50.1-2 2012-2013 this early work exemplifies Dolezel's deontic conditions for "the fall (violation of a norm—punishment)": adultery is Parnell's violation of the norm, and political disfavor is his punishment. But when the Wake alludes to similar infractions, they are muddled and unclear. When we are told that "a gynecure was let on to the scuffold for tak ing that same fine sum covertly by meddlement with the drawers of his neighbour's safe" (FW 14.25-27), are we informed of a theft or of an adulterous molestation? The allusion to the sin of coveting a neighbor's wife gets verbally mixed up with covertly taking a sum from a neighbor's safe. When the text offers us an embedded tale a little later in the chap ter, we might expect that this will shed some light on the deontic constraints at stake in the "municipal sin business." The embedded narrative of the tale of the prankquean appears to allude simultane ously to a transgression (kidnapping and theft) and to Dolezel's sec ond deontic narrative construction of "the test (obligation fulfilled— reward)." Yet the deontic structures are again, typically, confused. Does Jarl van Hoother fail the test because of his inability to answer the prankquean's riddle—"why do I am alook alike a poss of por terpease?"—or does the prankquean transgress by taking away his child—"[s]o her grace o'malice kidsnapped up the jiminy Tristopher and into the shandy westerness she rain, rain, rain" (FW 21.18-19, 21.20-22)? In order for the "Tale of the Prankquean" to serve a didac tic narrative purpose as a parable, it would have to offer clarity with respect to the social or ethical norms of its particular world and the consequences of adherence to, or departure from, them. Instead, van Hoother fails to answer the riddle, the prankquean kidnaps the chil dren, and van Hoother, dressed in elaborate and colorful garb, goes abroad, possibly to confront her: "And he clopped his rude hand to his eacy hitch and he ordurd and his thick spch spck for her to shut up shop, dappy. And the duppy shot the shutter clup" (FW 23.03-05). He has ordered her to shut up shop, and she complies, and the felicity of the polis has been restored? Is that what happens, and if so, what lesson have we learned? We are given a glimpse in this first chapter of a fictional consciousness whose knowledge- and obligation-worlds operate at cross-purposes, and this collision of possible worlds takes on the role that narrative plot normally plays in fiction. As the chapter nears its end, a curious shift in person, tone, and modality occurs. The narrative voice moves from third to second person, for a time, and from an impersonal tone to a colloquial and familiar Irish vernacular: "Now be aisy, good Mr Finnimore, sir. And take your laysure like a god on pension and don't be walking abroad" (FW 24.16-17). Has the narratorial character shifted or is the initial narrative voice quoting or mimicking the speech of another figure? In either case, the address can be inferred as being made to a corpse 424</page><page sequence="13">who wishes to rise—an inference supported by a distorted reference to a line from the ballad "Tim Finnegan's Wake"—"Anam muck an dhoul! Did ye drink me doornail?" (FW 24.15). The shift in modality introduces Ryan's third private possible world—a wish-world—into the chapter, although its function here is most peculiar. Also known as "the axiological system" proposed by Ryan (111), the wish-world engages personal values and desires, or what is considered good, bad, indifferent, or desirable by an individual. In an effort to dis suade the dead man from rising, the narrative voice now assures Mr. Finnimore that he is better off where he is: "You're better off, sir, where you are, primesigned in the full of your dress, bloodeagle waistcoat and all" (FW 24.28-29). And it promises that his friends will take care of him—or at least his grave: "And we'll be coming here, the ombre players, to rake your gravel and bringing you pres ents, won't we, fenians?" (FW 24.35-25.01). The strategy of imputing what he would value to the dead man requires transferring desires from the domain of the speaker, a maneuver which insures that the transferred values and desires are imagined or made up in a way that doubles their virtuality. Another version of this maneuver can be seen in the way the speaker offers the dead man his own past memories as a compensatory gesture: "If you only were there to explain the meaning, best of men, and talk to her nice of guldenselver. The lips would moisten once again. As when you drove with her to Findrirtny Fair. What with reins here and ribbons there all your hands were employed so she never knew was she on land or at sea or swooped through the blue like Airwinger's bride" (FW 28.10-15). The erstwhile bride—Earwicker's we presume—is conjured up for the dead man as a figure of his wish-world, but she is quickly interpolated into a scene that would, one might expect, dismay him. This is the news, reported as a rumor ("as it is told me"—FW 29.01) of "a big rody ram lad at random on the premises" (FW 28.36), presumably to take his place. The wish-worlds in the Wake appear frequently to involve domestic relations and domestic scenes and, therefore, generally encompass female figures, while its knowledge- and obligation-worlds extend into the larger community. The Wake implicitly offers gender typolo gies, in this respect. So what sort of fictional world or worlds have we traversed after reading the first chapter of Finnegans Wake? It is one riddled with con tradictions, albeit contradictions that can be analyzed. The narrator's hybrid status of a voice fluctuating between anonymous and imper sonal third person, yet endowed with a logic resembling stream of consciousness, creates an indeterminate knowledge-world. Its preoc cupation with falling, sin, and possible redemption suggests an obli gation-world made untenable by its failure to identify norms or the criteria for conforming or violating them. And insofar as it conjures 425</page><page sequence="14">James Joyce Quarterly 50.1-2 2012-2013 up wish-worlds, these are imputed to figures rather than expressed directly and are, therefore, also indeterminate with respect to their status as a private possible world. These contradictions can further be ascribed to the text's failure to represent a textual actual world. Ryan discusses three possible consequences when fictional lan guage fails to produce a representation of a factual domain: the empty center, the unknowable center, and radical lack of authority (39-40). Finnegans Wake appears to exhibit all three at various times. A text with an empty fictional center results, Ryan comments, when it "lim its its assertions to worlds at the periphery, avoiding the representa tion of an actual world" (39). This pertains when the Wake narrative reports something as rumor or retells a tale or expresses uncertainty about what occurred. Ryan believes that a text has an unknowable center "by leaving it unclear who is speaking, or by preventing the reader from identifying the reference world of sentences" (40). This condition seems to hold pretty consistently throughout Finnegans Wake. The frequent use of pronominal constructions, which refer to a "he" or a "she" without a clear antecedent, offers just one example of this problem. "Radical lack of authority" is exhibited by a text when it retracts its own statements or denies its own assertions or otherwise leaves in doubt what is true or untrue—a phenomenon exemplified by the proliferation of versions of various events throughout the work. The following narrative statement from the first chapter exem plifies all three characteristics of undecidable fictional domains: "It may half been a missfired brick, as some say, or it mought have been due to a collupsus of his back promises, as others looked at it. (There extand by now one thousand and one stories, all told, of the same)" (FW 5.26-29).18 What all of this amounts to is a radical experiment with fictionality itself, a maneuver—programmatically, if not sys tematically—to undo the way fiction operates. It is as though Joyce figured out a way to write a work of anti-fiction which nonetheless remains fictional—a feat that has traditionally been metaphorized as his creation of a dream-world or a dream-work.19 Insofar as the dream is our model of an alternative world where logic and norms fail to hold sway, where physical laws may be broken and knowledge breaks down, where taxonomies may become confused and identities and properties may shift and merge, the dream is an excellent model for the Wake's fictionality. Possible Worlds theory provides a semantic rather than a psychological analysis of such a world. To return now to Gordon's "Finnegans Wake": A Plot Summary and Burrell's Narrative Design in "Finnegans Wake," we can use the theo retical insights of Possible Worlds theory to analyze better some of their strategies in dealing with the highly unconventional fictional construction of this text. Dolezel points out that, because texts are inevitably incomplete, "implicitness is a universal feature of texts" 426</page><page sequence="15">(172). He then goes on to discuss the means by which implicitness is grounded in the explicit texture—the words on the page—of the work. The first is by way of a "felt absence," by gaps and lacunae (173). The second is by "the opposite kind of marking: the presence in the text of some signals or indexes, particularly hints, insinuations, and allusions, most of them found in co-text or context" (173). Gordon's procedure seems to connect these two kinds of implication to produce his sense of a hidden "realism" in the work. The absence he rightly detects is that of an actual, factual world. But instead of interpret ing this absence as an indicator of fantasy or hallucination, Gordon sets out to correct it by weaving the positive indices of disjointed references and sprinkled allusions together in order to reconstruct a more familiar and more coherent semblance of an actual world. In practice, this often requires putting details from various parts of the book together. Here is how he assembles evidence that the Earwicker bedroom contains a washbasin: "The basin is a sink-and-faucet affair, set into the wall. It is mentioned explicitly in 1/5, where we hear that HCE 'takes a szumbath for his weekend and a wassarnap [German, "water basin"] for his refreskment' (129.29), a practice recommended on 525.02-3" (21). Gordon's evidence for the time of the action in the Wake is assembled in a similar way. A reference to "'a tubtail of mondayne clothes' (333.23-4) reminds us, Monday is washday" (37), he writes. This datum is corroborated by a reference to "'Deemsday/ German Dienstag, Tuesday (602.20)" in a quite different part of the book (37). Such a procedure also draws attention to another charac teristic of Wake language to which I have alluded in passing without pausing to analyze it. What I have earlier described as "linguistic static," the property of words to veer away from standard English in a way that embeds allusions to other words, allows the language frequently to conjure up more than one fictional domain in a single passage or even sentence. Take, for example, the phrase "fwjolkencap is on him, frowned; audiurient, he would evesdrip, were it mous at hand, were it dinn of bottles in the far ear" (FW 23.21-23). If one took the hint of the German "[w]olken" or cloud as a point of departure, the sentence could refer to a figure under a cloud, perhaps under a dripping eave, hearing the din of battle afar. But Gordon sees in "wolkencap" a "woollen nightcap" and pictures the figure in bed, eavesdropping on a female voice (120). Both fictional scenes—one outdoors and impersonal, one indoors and intimate—are discernible in the sentence as a result of the linguistic overlay. In making the case for realism, Gordon generally privileges the domestic and local domains conjured by the language of the text over other realms that may coexist with them. Burrell's procedure depends on another aspect of the role that implicitness plays in fiction, and that is the role of allusion and inter 427</page><page sequence="16">James Joyce Quarterly 50.1-2 2012-2013 textuality. The latter can, of course, be explicit in fiction—for example, when we learn that Gerty MacDowell has read The Lamplighter or that Molly Bloom is familiar with Moll Flanders. But the Joycean text also displays significant implicit intertextuality, as the Homeric parallels with the Odyssey in Ulysses make clear, and as James S. Atherton tracks in his invaluable The Books at the "Wake."20 The function of allusion is to "direct the interpreter from one literary text to other texts," accord ing to Dolezel (201), and it therefore supplies the conduit between the words on the page and their hidden textual references. Burrell seizes precisely on this function of allusion to ground his argument: "One of the reasons for postulating that Finnegans Wake is the rewrit ten Bible is that Joyce carefully leaves clues of a parallel structure between them" (15). His overall procedure explicitly acknowledges conformity to the intuitive and subjective method Dolezel describes: "[a] meaning is suggested that the critic feels or believes to be 'hid den' in the text: the text is made to mean what the interpreter wants it to mean" (173) 21 Burrell acknowledges that the Bible will work as the key to the Wake strictly on condition of this kind of shared faith: "What is required is the proper mind-set. Readers must approach the text with the resolute conviction that Joyce intended his basic level of narration to be his own peculiar transcription of Genesis. If they seek, they will find. The apparent or surface message must be subverted until the underlying association can be made" (13). Part of the justi fication for Burrell's faith in this master-narrative's function is that it allows him to mobilize two versions of intertextuality simultaneously Dolezel points out that "Riffaterre differentiates two sources of inter textuality: particular texts and universal cultural stock" (200). Burrell relies on Genesis to function as a universal cultural stock whose inter textual presence in Finnegans Wake he can then verify by identifying parallels and references to the Bible as a specific text.22 For Burrell, these parallels reside not only in allusions but also in such structural features as "multiple stories," "digressions," "repetition," and others, including arcane practices such as the use of "masoretic consonants" (18). But Burrell's condition for his reading—that "the apparent or surface message must be subverted until the underlying association can be made"—finally produces reductive paraphrases which violate the Wake's own unique fictional and narrative subversions. The privileging of one or another "hidden" narrative in Finnegans Wake may be the only plausible way to produce a more or less coher ent meaning out of the otherwise elusive textual and fictional con struction of the work. Other critics like Kimberly J. Devlin, Bishop, and Patrick A. McCarthy have avoided foregrounding a specific "hid den" narrative to replace the surface textual complications and have, therefore, engaged more directly with the virtuality of Finnegans Wake's fictional construction 23 Devlin resorts to an intertextual read 428</page><page sequence="17">ing by considering the Wake's strangeness as an "uncanny" revisi tation of Joyce's earlier texts (ix). This strategy preserves both the book's virtual character as a fantasy or dream text while nonetheless giving it reference points in the multiple actual and possible worlds of Dubliners, A Portrait, and Ulysses. Bishop's approach to the Wake as a night-book or sleep-book, rather than a dream-book, allows him to dispense with reconstructing an alternative narrative for the text altogether: "No one remembers the experience of sleep, if at all, as a sequence of events linked chronologically in time by cause and effect from the moment his head hit the pillow to the time the alarm clock startled him into rational accountability in the morning" (9). Bishop draws from this insight inferences about the Wake's narrative construction: "If one operates on the premise that Finnegans Wake reconstructs the night, the first preconception to abandon wholesale is that it ought to read anything at all like narrative or make sense as a continuous linear whole" (27). McCarthy's exploration of the riddles in the Wake is premised on the conviction that "[c]ertainty is virtually nonexistent in this book," an insight that implicitly acknowledges the text as the subversion of a possible knowledge-world: "In this respect Finnegans Wake reflects the world it describes, a world in which rumor outdistances concrete evidence, in which appearance and reality are inseparable, in which the underlying order of human experience must be reconstructed by each person since the world presents such experi ence to us haphazardly and arbitrarily" (16). Each of these studies has successfully engaged with the Wake as a fantasy universe without the theoretical apparatus of Possible Worlds theory, but while this appa ratus may not be essential for exploring the fictional construction of the Finnegans Wake text, it nonetheless holds great promise for useful ness in approaching the work in the twenty-first century. Together with contemporary narratology, Possible Worlds theory could abet a more rigorous analysis of the immensely difficult Books II and III, for example. The knowledge-worlds of the Homework chapter (II.2), the recursive narratives in the Tavern chapter (II.3), the obligation-worlds that haunt Shaun in Book III, and the wish-worlds of ALP in Book IV—all exhibit multiple and overlapping possible worlds that invite further theoretical exploration. Now there are new tools and vehicles at hand for just such an intellectual journey into the mind or minds that constitute the fictional domains of Finnegans Wake.

The Professor's pupils are, therefore, not meant to believe in the fictional reality of the Mookse and the Gripes except instrumentally and provisionally, in order to understand the complex historical story of how Ireland came to be under British rule. 16 If Finnegans Wake makes references to events that postdate its writing and publication dates, then its genre would share the features of science fic tion, which is marked by a chronologically inconsistent inventory, among 430</page><page sequence="19">other actual world departures. Murray Gell-Mann's 1961 discovery of the atomic particle he called the "quark" does not fall into this category because the Wake's "quarks" at 383.01 refer simply to a cheer, perhaps in the form of "quacks." But the description of the "abnihilisation of the etym" with its allusion to "moletons skaping with mulicules" appears improbably to gesture toward nuclear fission and the splitting of the atom (FW 353.22, 26). Yet it is difficult to imagine how Joyce would have learned of the highly secret experiments that were conducted in Berlin and France in 1939 unless there was discussion of their possibility in the 1930s. The references to "television" (FW 150.33) are less problematic because the first television broadcasts with levels of what we would consider modern definition were aired in Britain in 1936, and Joyce could presumably have heard discussion of the possibility of such devices. 17 The frequency of story-telling in the Wake may signal a difference from dream narrative, however, since dreams tend to present scenes as lived or experienced rather than as heard. 18 A final possibility raised by Ryan might also be considered for its pos sible relevance to Finnegans Wake: a fictional world that has a "ubiquitous center" because it absorbs "all possible worlds within the boundaries of TAW [textual actual world]" (p. 41). Ryan's example of such a text is the virtual Chinese fiction described by Jorge Luis Borges in "The Garden of Forking Paths," Fictions, Labyrinths: Selected Stories and Other Writings (New York: Modern Library, 1983), p. 26. In the story, a figure chooses all possibilities when confronted with a choice and therefore creates all possible futures for itself. Such a fiction requires a basic textual actual world, however, which Finnegans Wake does not exhibit. 19 Two critical works that explicitly take the dream as their main trope for discussing the experimentalism of Finnegans Wake are Margot Norris's The Decentered Universe of "Finnegans Wake" (Baltimore: Johns Hopkins Univ. Press, 1976), and Michael H. Begnal's Dreamscheme: Narrative and Voice in "Finnegans Wake" (Syracuse: Syracuse Univ. Press, 1988). But while Norris invokes both Freudian theory and structuralist linguistics to argue that Joyce produces his language play on their principles (p. 100), Begnal argues for a less theoretical approach to the Wake as a dream work: "Joyce is very much a traditionalist when it comes to the ways in which he will manipulate plot and character" (p. xv). 20 James S. Atherton, The Books at the "Wake": A Study of Literary Allusions in James Joyce's "Finnegans Wake" (Carbondale: Southern Illinois Univ. Press, 1959). 21 Another Finnegans Wake study that operates on this principle is Grace Eckley's The Steadfast "Finnegans Wake" (Lanham, Md.: Univ. Press of America, 1994). For Eckley, it is the figure of the "crusading [Victorian] jour nalist" William T. Stead (1849-1912) that provides "the biographical original . . . [of] Humphrey Chimpden Earwicker" (pp. 1, 196). This assertion allows Eckley to read the text chiefly as a historical novel. 22 Burrell calls the Bible "the most published and least read book ever written" (p. 27). He goes on to say that "[i]t is a mistake when approach ing Finnegans Wake to assume that you know and remember the Bible story unless you reread and consider the exact details and wording, for this is the framework on which the Wake is constructed" (p. 27). 431</page><page sequence="20">James Joyce Quarterly 50.1-2 2012-2013 23 See Kimberly J.
