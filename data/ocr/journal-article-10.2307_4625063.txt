HERMAN Miltonists tread gingerly around the issue of Paradise Lost and uncertainty. While critics and readers from the eighteenth century onward have noted the many places where Milton's epic constitutes, to use Joseph Wittreich's phrase, "a field of opposing stresses and signals,"' by and large they have dealt with this problem through a variety of containment strategies.2 For a long time, Milton's readers simply ignored the contradictions (e.g., E. M. W. Tillyard and C. S. Lewis), but when this issue finally started emerging to the fore in the early 1960s, such critics as A. J. A. Waldock and John Peters ascribed the discontinuities of Para- dise Lost to a regrettable failure of poetic craftsmanship.3 Yet in a curious reversal of the trend in early modern scholarship to- ward privileging discontinuity and ideological fissures, Miltonists tend to assume that the contradictions are only superficial and that a "proper" understanding of the poem erases the difficulty. To give but two of the most recent examples, Catherine Gimelli Martin writes that "because Paradise Lost cannot be consistent with itself does not mean that it cannot be made generally consis- tent with a mode featuring the uses of irony outlined above [in her book], nor do these ironies fail to support certain conjectures about the poet's intentions" (my emphasis); and Steven Jablonski asserts that he will attempt "to reconcile Milton's republican be- liefs about political liberty ... with his seeming support for mon- archy in his epic poem" (my emphasis).4 Even critics who seemingly foreground Milton's contradictions usually seek to master them through the principle of discordia Peter C. Herman is professor of English at San Diego State University. This essay is part of a book project tentatively called "(De)Stabilizing Milton: Paradise Lost and the Poetics of Incertitude."</page><page sequence="2">182 Milton's Poetics of Incertitude concors.5 Thus William Kolbrener argues that "mediation" fig- ures as the central fact of Milton's works, and he defines this term as "the means through which Milton joins, without reconcil- ing, apparently contradictory positions" (emphasis in the origi- nal).6 Like Wittreich, David Norbrook notes that "we are constantly denied a stable point of reference," yet he nonetheless argues that Raphael provides Adam a vision of the universe as a "sub- lime concordia discors" and insists that "God's ways can be justified, but they must first be held up to difficult scrutiny ... God is justi- fled because of his refusal to treat his subjects as mere puppets or instruments."7 Even Wittreich contains the poem's conflicting signals by analogizing Paradise Lost to A. Bartlett Giamatti's ideal university, a place where "competing systems of thought collide; where they are 'tested, debated . .. freely, openly."'8 The underlying assumption, I would even go so far as to call it the masterplot of Milton criticism, is that Milton produced an epic that coheres, and the task of the critic is to make the poem cohere, even in the face of massive evidence to the contrary.9 Furthermore, this masterplot controls the analyses produced by the supposedly warring camps of "angelic" and "satanic" critics. In the introduction to the second edition of Surprised by Sin, Stanley Fish rebuts those arguing for unresolved tensions by stat- ing that Milton deliberately fills his epic with moments when "the affirmation of variety is immediately countered by the imposition of unity and the insistence on an underlying sameness,"'1 yet the differences between Fish and his supposed antagonists re- ally are a matter of degree rather than substance: Fish argues that there are no unresolved antinomies, Kolbrenner et al. say that unresolved antinomies can coexist in a sort of supra-coher- ence that contains multitudes. The route may be different, but the conclusions are remarkably similar. It is precisely this confidence in this poem's thematic and formal unity that I contest, and in this article I will demonstrate that Milton structures Paradise Lost according to what I call a poetics of incertitude. Granted, John P. Rumrich has argued for the shaping presence of "indeterminacy and differences of opin- ion" in Paradise Lost." Rumrich finds "the theme of indetermi- nacy as a vital dimension of human experience and behavior."'2 Indeterminacy is thus a positive state of creative flux; if certainty is deferred, the jouissance of infinite possibility takes its place. Hence Rumrich's recuperation of Chaos. I replace Rumrich's "in- determinacy" with "incertitude" because I think that Rumrich's interpretation de-fangs the poem in much the same way that</page><page sequence="3">Peter C. Herman 183 Wittreich does with his analogy between Paradise Lost and the ideal, contemporary university. I use "incertitude" because I be- lieve that in the aftermath of the Revolution Milton engaged in a wholesale questioning of just about everything he had argued for in his prose works, and he does not come to a conclusion.'3 There- fore, in place of Rumrich's "poetics of becoming" (his emphasis),14 I propose a poetics of incertitude because it is out of the turmoil of not knowing what to affirm in the wake of the Revolution's failure that Milton creates his finest poetry. I have argued elsewhere that Milton's similes and metaphors consistently lead us to a point of aporia,'5 and that this meta- phoric incertitude reflects Milton's unsettled state after the Revolution's demise. In this essay, I will demonstrate that Milton structures Paradise Lost according to a series of suspended choices, and this structure determines the smallest details of the poem as well as the larger narrative. I will begin by looking at Milton's use of "Or," and then move on to how the Miltonic "Or" constitutes the DNA, as it were, of the poem's competing narra- tives. Albert C. Labriola has proposed that "All" constitutes "the essence of Paradise Lost," by which Labriola means what he per- ceives as the extraordinary unity of the poem.16 Labriola's state- ment, however, that "all" constitutes "a deep structure that generates, among others, both interrogatory and declarative surface struc- tures, a linguistic universal implying any number of particular reformulations,"17 applies equally well to the omnipresence of "or," which is of course the undoing of "all" since unresolved choice implicitly deconstructs the imposition of unity called for by "all." Labriola is not wrong in his assessment of the importance of "all," but we need to balance the drive toward unity with the equal drive toward duality and incertitude. In other words, while one must recognize the presence of a strong, totalizing impulse within this poem, a desire for unity and a movement toward organicism, we also need to recognize that this impulse is countered by an equally powerful countertendency toward undoing unity and toward un- resolved choices leading to aporias, sometimes figuratively, some- times literally. To appropriate Labriola's language for my own purposes, I will show that the Miltonic "Or" also figures as a deep structure generating a plethora of "declarative surface structures." It should come as no surprise that a poem concerning choices contains within it the word most associated with choice: "or." But</page><page sequence="4">184 Milton's Poetics of Incertitude it has somehow escaped notice that "or" constitutes the eighth most common word in Paradise Lost, occurring, according to Gladys W. Hudson's concordance, 714 times, surpassing even "all," which occurs 693 times.18 The omnipresence of "or" signals something more than a commitment to rhetorical copia. Rather, it suggests that Milton conceives of his narrative in terms of choice, in terms of A or B, this or that. But to add yet a further twist, "or" in and of itself complicates or deconstructs the notion of stable binary opposition because the word can mean both similarity as well as difference. "Or," confusingly enough, can also mean "and." To quote the definition in the OED, "Or connects two words de- noting the same thing,"'19 and Milton will often use "or" to sepa- rate two or more synonyms. The poem begins with the first speaker, conventionally asso- ciated with Milton, invoking the Muse: "Sing Heav'nly Muse, that on the secret top / Of Oreb, or of Sinai, didst inspire [Moses]" ("or" my emphasis),20 Oreb and Sinai referring to the same place. When Satan first addresses the fallen angels, he poses the rhe- torical question, "what power of mind / Foreseeing or presaging ... /... could have fear'd, / How such united force of Gods" could be defeated (1.626-9), "Foreseeing" and "presaging" being synonymous. The same is true of "fraud" and "guile" in Satan's assertion, "our better part remains / To work in close design, by fraud or guile" (1.645-6). In book 2, the narrator compares the sound of murmuring after Belial's speech to how the after-echo of a storm at sea lulls seafarers "whose Bark by chance / Or Pinnace anchors in a craggy Bay" (2.288-9), there again being little real distinction between a bark or a pinnace, since both are "types of small fighting ships."21 At other times Milton will use "or" to separate items that may be physically different, but mean the same thing. In book 3, for example, the narrator describes his blindness by way of a series of items that he can no longer see: Thus with the Year Seasons return, but not to me returns Day, or the sweet approach of Ev'n or Morn, Or flocks, or heards, or human face divine. (3.40-4; my emphasis) And in book 9, Satan gears up for his speech to Eve like an orator from "Athens or free Rome" (9.671). While it is very important that Milton compares Satan to an orator from the two paragons</page><page sequence="5">Peter C. Herman 185 of classical republicanism, it matters less, I think, whether the orator hails from either Athens or Rome. If Milton uses "or" to conflate difference, he also uses "or" to provide a choice between different items but without indicating a preference between them. Eve, for instance, goes off armed "with such Gardning Tools as Art yet rude, / Guiltless of fire had formd, or Angels brought" (9.391-2). The Epic Voice gives us a choice of two distinct origins for Eve's tools: either they were made by "Art yet rude," which implies human agency, or the "Angels brought" them to her. Another example: Adam and Eve praise Thir Maker, in fit strains pronoun'ct or sung Unmediated, such prompt eloquence Flowd from thir lips, in Prose or numerous Verse. (5.147-50; my emphasis) The First Couple prays using either prose or verse, their fit strains are either "pronoun'ct," meaning they speak in prose, "or sung," meaning they employ "numerous Verse." Milton does not have them use verse and prose, that is, a mixture of the two. Milton structures these passages so that they present an unresolved choice, and the sheer number of such formulations points toward what Labriola calls a "deep structure" within Para- dise Lost: that is, Milton structures Paradise Lost according to the presentation of choices between differing items while leaving the outcome unclear. Satan, disguised as a cherub, tells Uriel that he wants to observe Adam "with secret gaze, / Or open ad- miration" (3.671-2). Which is it? Uriel, after consulting with Gabriel, returns to either a Ptolemaic or a Copernican universe (4.592-5); Satan, squatting "like a Toad" by Eve's ear (4.800), seeks to assail '"The Organs of her Fancie ... Or ... taint / Th' animal Spirits that from pure blood arise" (4.802-5); Adam and Eve in their prayer (that is either in prose or numerous verse) ask "if the night / Have gathered aught of evil or conceald, / Disperse it" (5.206-8), the actions of gathering and concealing not being the same. After Raphael receives his charge from God, he speeds to an Earth that looks either like the "Imagind Land and Regions in the Moon" spied by a "less assur'd" Galileo (5.263, 262) or like the "Pilot from amidst the Cyclades / Delos or Samos first ap- pearing kenns / A cloudy spot" (5.264-6), and it should be noted that just as the Pilot and Galileo are not exactly synonymous, neither are Delos and Samos, which may be off the coast of Asia</page><page sequence="6">186 Milton's Poetics of Incertitude Minor but are not in the same cluster of islands, as Roy Flannagan notes.22 In book 10, Adam describes the clouds as "Justling" Uos- tling], which implies agency, or "pusht with Winds" (10.1074), implying lack of agency. Again, Milton provides opposing options without choosing between them. The cumulative effect of this procession of unresolved choices (which Milton does not limit to Satan's speeches) is not so much to enforce upon the reader the limitations of fallen cognition, as Fish might have it (the reader consistently opting for the wrong choice and then being corrected). Rather, the effect is to instill a pervasive sense of uncertainty, and as is so often the case with Milton's eighteenth century "editor" and defender, Richard Bentley's keen ear intuited Milton's use of "or" as a problematizing agent because he often "emends" the Miltonic "Or" to another word, one that removes the uncertainty resulting from unresolved choices.23 The phrase, "What words or tongue of Seraph" (7.113) Bentley alters to "words from tongue" ("from" my emphasis) and Satan's lament, "I in none of these / Find place or refuge" (9.118- 9), becomes "place ofrefuge."24 To further bring out the ramifica- tions of the Miltonic "Or," I want to examine in detail three particularly knotty examples. The invocation to book 3 has been subjected to much analy- sis, yet it has not been sufficiently noted that this passage also consists of a series of unresolved choices. First, the definition of light. While there have been many attempts to figure out the na- ture of the light addressed in this invocation,25 the lines them- selves give us a choice of two possibilities. The speaker first calls light the "ofspring of Heav'n first-born" (3.1), and Flannagan sug- gests that Milton refers to the light created on the first day.26 But Milton follows this genealogy with another derivation: "Or of th' Eternal Coeternal beam" (3.2), meaning from the Son of God. The first choice does not lineally associate the Muse with Christ, the second does. Conversely, it is possible that "or" in this case could mean "and" if we interpret "ofspring of Heav'n first-born" as "off- spring of Christ"-who is God's first-born. Or, to complicate the meaning even further, the phrase, "of th' Eternal Coeternal beam" could locate the light's origin in God, not the Son of God, since according to Arianism, the Son cannot be described as "Coeternal" and since God exudes light by definition and is in some sense light.27 However one construes these lines, Milton evidently leaves the precise genealogy of light suspended among a series of choices. Milton follows this multiply unresolved "or" with an implied "or"-the syntactically ambiguous question "May I express thee</page><page sequence="7">Peter C. Herman 187 unblam'd?" (3.3), in which "unblam'd" could modify either "I" or "thee."28 While Milton supplies a reason for why he may be "blam'd" for expressing the Light, whatever its origins ("Since," meaning because, "God is light," etc.), the question itself never receives an answer, and Milton compounds the murkiness of the passage by suddenly switching tacks and asking another syntactically mul- tivalent question: "Or hear'st thou rather pure Ethereal stream[?]" (3.7; my emphasis). Flannagan glosses this phrase as "Or would you prefer to hear of' (p. 416 n. 8), but Alistair Fowler and Merritt Y. Hughes suggest "prefer to be called."29 So, the speaker asks ei- ther if God wants to hear something else, or if God wants to be called something else, two completely different possibilities. Milton then caps this passage with not one but two unanswered ques- tions: "Whose fountain who shall tell?" (3.8). Unsurprisingly, we are never given the answer to these questions or any of the other choices in this extraordinarily resonant invocation. Equally unclear is what happens immediately after Satan tells Beelzebub to gather his forces after the elevation of the Son: So spake the false Arch-Angel, and infus'd Bad influence into th' unwarie brest Of his Associate; hee together calls, Or several one by one, the Regent Powers. (5.694-7; my emphasis) Flannagan glosses this passage by telling the reader that "Sa- tan will use Beelzebub as his shill or mouthpiece,"30 but the pre- cise nature of Beelzebub's actions on Satan's behalf remain unclear. The last clause of line 696, "hee together calls," seems to suggest that he merely calls everyone together, but the next clause, "Or several one by one," forces the reader to reinterpret "hee to- gether calls" as being in apposition to "several one by one." In other words, the "Or" forces the reader to wonder if Beelzebub spoke to the Regent powers who were gathered "together," as a group, or did he speak to each angel individually, "several one by one." The differences again are significant. The latter implies se- crecy, sneakiness, perhaps intimidation. But if Beelzebub speaks to the Regent Powers "together," that suggests a more public fo- rum, openness, appeals to reason rather than personal manipu- lation or catering to individual weaknesses or ambitions. But either way, what exactly Beelzebub does remains in doubt because the speaker has offered us a choice of two possibilities while giving us no way of deciding between them.</page><page sequence="8">188 Milton's Poetics of Incertitude Milton makes especially productive use of the Miltonic "Or" to render certainty problematic in his description of Death: The other shape, If shape it might be call'd that shape had none Distinguishable in member, joynt, or limb, Or substance might be call'd that shadow seem'd, For each seem'd either. (2.666-70; my emphasis) Seeking to describe the indescribable, Death is either a shadow that seems like it has substance or a substance that seems like a shadow (it is not clear which) and the Epic Voice collapses the choice implied in "Or" when he concludes by conflating the choices into one conceptual impossibility: "For each seem'd either." The third category in my taxonomy of the Miltonic "Or" con- sists of the times when Milton uses "or" to separate (but always without privileging one over the other) items that have not just differing, but fundamentally opposite valences. In book 4, Milton compares Satan's bounding over Eden's wall to a prowling Wolfe, Whom hunger drives to seek new haunt for prey, Watching where Shepherds pen thir Flocks at eve In hurdl'd Cotes amid the field secure, Leaps o're the fence with ease into the Fould: Or as a Thief bent to unhoord the cash Of some rich Burgher, whose substantial dores, Cross-barrd and bolted fast, fear no assault, In at the window climbs. (4.183-91; my emphasis) Satan as wolf or Satan as burglar could be a choice between similars ("or" as "and" again). Yet Milton destabilizes this inter- pretation by inserting the word "hunger," which ascribes radi- cally different motivations to these figures. The thief, there can be no doubt, acts from greed (perhaps slightly tinged by class envy). He wants the cash, nothing more. But the wolf, even with all its negative connotations and associations in Milton's lexicon with "Church lewd Hirelings" (4.193), acts from a natural im- pulse-he wants food. Hunger drives him, not self-aggrandize- ment. The thief and the wolf, therefore, are not coterminous, and</page><page sequence="9">Peter C. Herman 189 Milton emphasizes their non-contiguity by associating the Hire- lings more with the former than the latter (both thief and Hire- ling "climbe"; the wolf, on the other hand, leaps, and Milton puts the wolf first). This paradigm also applies to both God and Satan. In book 5, God states that Satan means to try "what our Power is, or our right" (5.728; my emphasis). This might seem an instance when "or" means "and," but power and right in this context do not seem synonymous. In The Riverside Milton, Flannagan carefully reproduces Milton's use of capitals because they offer important clues as to what the author wanted to emphasize, and in this passage it is evocative that Milton would have his printer capital- ize "Power" but not "right." The two, of course, are not the same. To rule by "Power" is tyrannous, to rule by "right" is not, and if anything, one imagines that Milton would have his God empha- size right rather than power. Furthermore, this choice partly ech- oes Satan's republican statements. In book 1 (which precedes God's speech in the narrative but comes after it chronologically), Satan asserts that God has "Sat on his Throne, upheld by old repute, / Consent or custome" (1.639-40). The differences be- tween "Consent" and "custome" are analogous to those separat- ing "right" and "Power," the former being a legitimate source of power, the latter not; the former associated with good monarchy and right rule, the latter with. tyranny. The fact that God offers a choice suggests that either God (or Milton) is genuinely not sure about Satan's motivation or that he credits Satan with a double motivation. Either way, God separates two politically distinct motivations by an "or," offering the reader a choice between two equally plausible possibilities. My last example comes from the poem's first epic simile, that in which Milton compares Satan to "Briareos or Typhon" (1.199).31 Once again, this comparison could be a choice between equals in which Milton seems to be making a distinction without a differ- ence, since both Briareos and Typhon are Titans who, as Milton puts it in the line before, "warr'd on Jove." Yet the tradition on Briareos splits in two. One camp, beginning with Vergil, associ- ates Briareos with evil. In book 10 of the Aeneid, Vergil compares Aeneas's fury to Briareos fighting against Jove: Just as Aegaeon, Who had a hundred arms and hands-they say- and fire burning from his fifty mouths and chests, when he clanged at Jove's thunderbolts</page><page sequence="10">190 Milton's Poetics of Incertitude with fifty shields, each one just like the other, And drew as many swords: so does Aeneas rage on.32 But Hesiod and Homer constitute the ground for an opposing tradition, one that interprets Briareos as a good guy, one who fights for Jove against his Titan brothers and who ultimately be- comes Jove's bodyguard.33 Both views are well represented in the mythographical literature.34 Therefore, the comparison of Satan to Briareos confronts readers with a double choice, a double "or," as it were. First, they must decide between two competing, equally authoritative traditions. But if the reader privileges the Hesiod/Homer view of Briareos, a view endorsed by Natalis Comes, the most influential Renaissance mythographer (which perhaps gives that view a slight edge over its Vergilian competitor), then Milton has compared Satan to two mutually exclusive figures, one an archetypal rebel, the other an Abdiel-esque figure who first rebels but ultimately turns against his brethren and de- fends established authority. Like the choices between hungry wolf/ greedy thief and power/right, the "or" separates items that op- pose each other not only in terms of their morality, but also their politics. These opposing, unresolved choices signal, as Paul de Man puts it, "a logical rather than a representational incompatibility" resulting in an aporia, meaning "the irrevocable occurrence of at least two mutually exclusive readings."35 Aporia literally means a moment where thought shuts down because of the lack of cer- tainty. As John Smith defined this term in his 1657 The Mysterie of Rhetorique Unveil'd, "Aporia is a figure whereby the speaker sheweth that he doubteth, either where to begin for the multi- tude of matters, or what to do or say in some strange or ambigu- ous thing" (p. 150; cited in the OED). Significantly, Milton often renders explicit the implied aporia caused by the Miltonic "Or" by leaving key moments quite literally unresolved. II Immediately following the Typhon/Briareos problem, Milton segues into the story of the Norwegian Pilot: [Satan is as huge as] that Sea-beast Leviathan, which God of all his works</page><page sequence="11">Peter C. Herman 191 Created hugest that swim th' Ocean stream: Him haply slumb'ring on the Norway foam The Pilot of some small night-foundr'd Skiff, Deeming some Island, oft, as Sea-men tell, With fixed Anchor in his skaly rind Moors by his side under the Lee, while Night Invests the Sea, and wished Morn delayes: So stretcht out huge in length the Arch-fiend lay. (1.200-9) Most critics assume that the whale dives and takes the un- fortunate sailor with him.36 Yet the text itself provides no evi- dence at all for what eventually happens to the sailor, and so Milton continues and amplifies the uncertainties instantiated by comparing Satan to Briareos or Typhon in a number of ways. First, he clouds the expected association between the Leviathan and evil because, as in his treatment of the wolf who seeks prey because he needs to eat, Milton removes any hint of volition, of desiring to do evil, from this encounter with the Pilot, who comes upon the whale "haply slumb'ring on the Norway foam" (1.203; "haply slumb'ring" my emphasis). Unlike Satan, the whale is not luring anybody to anchor on his "great bulk" because he is fast asleep at the time. Furthermore, again unlike Satan, who inten- tionally lures Adam and Eve to their Fall, the Leviathan and the Pilot's encounter is more a matter of bad luck, as Milton's "haply" makes clear. Finally, in a resonance that would make both Will- iam Empson and Fish smile (although for different reasons), since pronouns modify the nearest antecedent, it is initially unclear if "him" refers to God or the whale. Although the ambiguous refer- ence is (eventually) cleared up, Milton amplifies this seed of con- fusion in the rest of the passage. Finally, the simile leaves off with the Pilot's boat firmly "fixed" in the animal's hide. It may be that the animal will drag him to a watery death, or the Pilot may be lucky and set sail before the whale awakens. Yet Milton, unlike his sources, leaves the matter as inconclusive as the origin of Eve's gardening tools, whether Beelzebub speaks to the angels individually or collectively, whether Raphael speeds through a Copernican or a Ptolemaic universe, or, more immediately, whether Satan should be compared to the good or bad Briareos. These unresolved choices leave us in a state of doubt, not knowing which way to go, because, to invoke de Man once more, "if one of the readings is declared true, it will always be possible to undo it by means of the other; if it is de-</page><page sequence="12">192 Milton's Poetics of Incertitude creed false, it will always be possible to demonstrate that it states the truth of its aberration."37 In other words, if the reader chooses to privilege the bad Briareos, this reading can be undone by point- ing to both the Hesiodic and Homeric traditions as well as the repetition of these traditions in Comes, who is often cited by Miltonists to explain his use of mythography. Conversely, privi- leging the good Briareos can just as easily be undone by pointing to Vergil and the mythographers who follow him. So we are left hanging, denied closure, at the end of the Pilot passage, and Milton underscores this suspension by slowing down chronology: "Night / Invests the Sea, and wished Morn delays" (1.207-8). Time, like meaning, is suspended, and Milton situates both reader and Pi- lot in the same space that "or" inhabits, i.e., between the choices it separates. Milton does the same in the standoff between the "Angelic Squadron" and Satan at the end of book 4: While thus he spake, th' Angelic Squadron bright Turn'd fierie red, sharpning in mooned homes Thir Phalanx, and begin to hemm him round With ported Spears, as thick as when a field Of Ceres ripe for harvest waving bends Her bearded Grove of ears, which way the wind Swayes them; the careful Plowman doubting stands Lest on the threshing floor his hopeful sheaves Prove chaff. (4.977-85) As in the Pilot simile, Milton renders explicit the aporias caused by the Miltonic "Or." Rather than giving the reader the certainty of a definite outcome, he instead describes the moment when the outcome is uncertain. Like the Pilot who occupies the gray zone between morning and night, between safety and danger, a zone that seems unnaturally elongated, the Plowman occupies the moment before he knows whether his harvest will be wheat or chaff. He is "hopeful," yet also "careful" (meaning full of care rather than meticulous). We, along with the Plowman, may hope that everything may come out right, but as with many instances of the Miltonic "Or," Milton denies us any certainty on this point. Milton's comparison of the "ported Spears" to a field of wheat (which so exercised Bentley) further adds to the uncertainty.38 Although the image helps the reader visualize a field of waving spears, the fact that Milton emphasizes how the spears do not</page><page sequence="13">Peter C. Herman 193 simply resemble wheat, but wheat "ripe for harvest," (4.981) mean- ing wheat that is about to be cut down, complicates the sense immeasurably. Following the text's logic, the simile implies an- gelic defeat rather than success. The incongruity of the image forces the reader into an aporia, an impasse, which is then liter- alized in the figure of the "doubting" Plowman, who also stands suspended, unsure of what will happen, occupying the space, as it were, that "or" occupies in between two possibilities. Granted, the passage seems to have a final conclusion some lines later, when Satan looks up, sees the "golden Scales" (4.997) tipped against him, and then flees "Murmuring, and with him fled the shades of night" (4.1016), except that this line echoes the final line of the Aeneid, thus equating Satan with Turnus, who has just been killed by an Aeneas "aflame with rage-his wrath was terrible"39 after he has surrendered. Turnus's death, in other words, is not altogether deserved (especially since he fought Aeneas not because the man was inherently evil but because, as Milton puts it, Aeneas had "disespous'd" him [9.17]). III Up until now, I have been dealing with the explicit instances of the Miltonic "Or" and how Milton's consistent presentation of choices between opposite or differing possibilities results in an erosion, not a confirmation, of certainty. I want to examine now how this deep structure also controls the larger architecture of Paradise Lost as a series of voices that often present radically different versions of the same event.40 Just as Milton consistently presents us with explicit unresolved choices ("Briareos orTyphon"; "Prose or numerous Verse"; "Consent or custome"; garden tools made by angels or by rude art), so does he frequently present the reader with an implicit Miltonic "Or" between competing narra- tives.41 Milton uses this technique for three key scenes in Para- dise Lost: the Creation of Adam and Eve, their first meeting, and the Elevation of the Son. Raphael and Adam, as Wittreich has noted, deliver signifi- cantly different narratives of humankind's creation.42 The arch- angel, in book 7, gives this version: Let us make now Man in our image, Man In our similitude, and let them rule Over the Fish and Fowle of Sea and Aire, Beast of the Field, and over all the Earth,</page><page sequence="14">194 Milton's Poetics of Incertitude And every creeping thing that creeps the ground. This said, he formed thee, Adam, thee O Man Dust of the ground, and thy nostrils breath'd The breath of Life; in his own Image hee Created thee, in the Image of God Express, and thou becam'st a living Soul. Male he created thee, but thy consort Female for Race; then bless'd Mankinde, and said, Be fruitful, multiplie, and fill the Earth, Subdue it. (7.519-32) Raphael's account uneasily combines elements from the two Creation stories (Genesis 1-2:3; Gen. 2:3-3:25 and the brief re- cap in Genesis 5:1-2 ("Male and female created he them; and blessed them, and called their name Adam in the day when they were created" [Gen. 5:2 KJV]). In the first part of his version, Raphael draws on the equality of male and female implicit in the first creation narrative. "Man" seems to mean both Adam and Eve, as both are given equal power over the earth's inhabitants: "let them rule / Over the Fish and Fowle"). But as in the second creation narrative, Raphael allows that God created Adam first and Eve second. Furthermore, Raphael specifies that God cre- ates Eve specifically (and arguably solely) for the propagation of the race. There is little sense in Raphael's narrative that much time elapses between their respective origins. Yet when Adam describes his creation in book 8, he gives a very different account of the order, details, and purpose of his and Eve's creation. While Adam confirms the order of creation, he and Raphael differ on how much time elapses between his arising from the earth and Eve's arrival. In Raphael's version, Eve's creation seems to follow immediately upon Adam's, but according to Adam, an indeterminate yet fairly lengthy amount of time separates the two. Furthermore, while Raphael gives some credence to the equal power allotted the sexes in Genesis 1:26-8, God's speech to Adam (in Adam's recollection) is distinctly androcentric:43 but all the Earth To thee and to thy Race I give; as Lords Possess it, and all things that therein live, Or live in Sea, or Aire, Beast, Fish, and Fowle.</page><page sequence="15">Peter C. Herman 195 In signe whereof each Bird and Beast behold After thir kindes; I bring them to receave From thee thir names, and pay thee fealtie With low subjection. (8.338-45) According to Raphael, God gives Adam and Eve dominion over the earth. On the other hand, Adam says that God gives Adam and his "Race" dominion, his "Race" presumably being male since God has not yet created Eve. In addition, the phrase, "as Lords / Possess it," is Milton's (or Adam's) addition (in Genesis 1:26 and 1:28, God gives Adam and Eve "dominion" over the earth), and according to the OED, the definition of "Lord" explicitly excludes women. Next, in Raphael's version, God creates "Female for Race," yet in Adam's version, the emphasis is not on propagation, but on society. First, Adam worries about being alone ("In solitude / What happiness, who can enjoy alone, / Or all enjoying, what content- ment find"? [8.364-6]), and then when God tells Adam that he has all these animals to rule and "find pastime" with, Adam re- sponds with his famous lines about intellectual inequality: Among unequals what societie Can sort ... Of fellowship I speak Such as I seek, fit to participate All rational delight. (8.383-91) While Adam eventually gets around to mentioning the continua- tion of the species (8.419-27), the issue is always subordinated in Adam's mind to his desire for someone or something that would be his intellectual equal. Raphael includes nothing at all on this matter. We have, therefore, an implied Miltonic "Or" over when and why God creates Eve. One could attempt to resolve these conflicts by privileging angelic over human intellect. Certainly, Adam seems to think that Raphael is divinely inspired ("thy words with Grace Divine / Imbu'd .." [8.215-6]). Yet as Raphael himself admits, even though his rhetoric suggests that he was an eyewitness to the Creation, he in fact was somewhere else when it happened:</page><page sequence="16">196 Milton's Poetics of Incertitude For I that Day was absent, as befell Bound on a voyage uncouth and obscure, Farr on excursion toward the Gates of Hell. (8.229-31) Therefore, the task of choosing between these narrations is not at all easy. Raphael's version has to be secondhand, while Adam obviously was there. But Adam says that Raphael's words are inspired with grace, which gives them a higher valence than his recollections. Or is Adam politely complimenting Raphael while correcting the angel's mistaken version of these events? In addi- tion, Raphael's version not only differs from that delivered by Adam, who, as a participant and witness to these events, ought to be given priority, but the archangel's language also differs from God's. Where Raphael uses "Man" to signify both male and fe- male, Adam and Eve (e.g., "Let us make now Man in our image, Man / In our similitude, and let them rule"), God uses this term to signify only the male, only Adam (e.g., "For man will hark'n to his glozing lyes, / And easily transgress the sole Command, / Sole pledge of his obedience" [3.93-5; my emphasis]). Conse- quently, the evidence at the moment would seem to favor Adam as the more reliable narrator, yet as Adam continues to describe the first meeting between himself and Eve, his credibility also begins to suffer. Just as Adam and Raphael's narrations about the same event diverge, so do Adam and Eve's versions of their first experiences with each other.44 Eve remembers Adam speaking a series of com- mands and barked questions: Return faire Eve; Who fli'st thou? whom thou fli'st, of him thou art, His flesh, his bone; to give thee being I lent Out of my side to thee, neerest my heart Substantial Life, to have thee by my side Henceforth an individual solace dear; Part of my Soul I seek thee, and thee claim My other half. (4.481-8) Adam remembers this incident very differently. According to his version, he is not talking to her, but to God:</page><page sequence="17">Peter C. Herman 197 I now see Bone of my bone, Flesh of my Flesh, my Self Before me; Woman is her Name, of Man Extracted; for this cause he shall forgoe Father and Mother, and to his Wife adhere; And they shall be one Flesh, one Heart, one Soule. (8.494-9) Adam says that Eve "heard me thus" (8.500), suggesting that he considered these words his "pleaded reason" (8.510).45 Yet the differences in tone and content between the two recollections of their first meeting are truly astounding. Adam's speech to God in praise of Eve and privileging wives over parents she hears as a claim of ownership. Adam's lines, "for this cause he shall forgoe / Father and Mother, and to his Wife adhere" (8.497-8), she evi- dently understands as "to have thee by my side / Henceforth an individual solace dear" (4.485-6). What Adam remembers as a beautiful assertion of mutuality-"And they shall be one Flesh, one Heart, one Soule" (8.499)-Eve hears as domination: "Part of my Soul I seek thee, and thee claim / My other half' (4.487-8). Equally if not more important are the differing recollections of the denouement. Adam says that Eve "with obsequious Majestie approv'd / My pleaded reason. To the Nuptial Bowre / I led her blushing like the Morn" (8.509-11). Eve, however, remembers that Adam concludes his speech with an assertion of physical domination: "with that thy gentle hand / Seisd mine, I yielded, and from that time see / How beauty is excelld by manly grace" (488-90; my emphasis). Significantly, Milton almost always uses this verb to denote something very bad: "amazement seis'd / All th' Host of Heav'n" when Sin popped out of Satan's head (2.758- 9); envy "seis'd" Satan when he surveyed Eden; and Death tells his father to go (literally) to Hell or else "with one stroke of this Dart / Strange horror seise thee, and pangs unfelt before" (2.702- 3). Using Milton's lexicon as a guide, Eve's remembering that Adam "seisd" her hand cannot reflect well on Adam, and her use of this verb belies her supposed unquestioning acceptance of in- feriority. Adam, though, thinks that he "led her blushing like the Morn." The two experiences, in other words, are very different in both their inward and outward details. Does Adam "seis" Eve's hand, or does he gently lead her? Does he command her to stay or use "pleaded reason"? Does Adam praise mutuality or sub- mission? Does he win Eve using reason, or reason coupled with force? If the latter, which leads to Eve's submission? Just as so</page><page sequence="18">198 Milton's Poetics of Incertitude many of the explicit instances of the Miltonic "Or," the implied Miltonic "Or" between Adam and Eve's narratives (just as the implied "or" between Adam and Raphael's) only contributes to the poem's burgeoning uncertainties. Significantly, the same problem controls what may very well be the central moment of Paradise Lost: the Elevation of the Son. Discussions of this event rarely if ever note that Milton provides two very different narratives, delivered by two very different nar- rators, of this event. Yet, not only is there no consensus in the critical literature about when this event happens, or even how many times the Son is elevated, there is also no recognition that a difference of opinion exists. Some say it occurs in book 5, others in book 3, still others conflate books 3 and 5, while another group posits that the two elevations are different aspects of the same event.46 Clearly, the Elevation of the Son, or as I will argue, the Elevations of the Son, constitute an unrecognized textual problem. According to the Epic Voice, the Elevation occurs in book 3, after the Son has offered to sacrifice himself to save humankind: Therefore thy humiliation shall exact With thee thy Manhood also to this Throne; Here shalt thou sit incarnate, here shalt Reign Both God and Man, Son both of God and Man, Anointed universal King; all Power I give thee, reign for ever, and assume Thy Merits; under thee as Head Supream Thrones, Princedoms, Powers, Dominions I reduce: All knees to thee shall bow, of them that bide In Heaven, or Earth, or under Earth in Hell; When thou attended gloriously from Heav'n Shalt in the Sky appeer, and from thee send The summoning Arch-Angels to proclaime Thy dread Tribunal: Then [after the apocalypse] thou thy regal Scepter shalt lay by, For regal Scepter then no more shall need, God shall be All in All. But all ye Gods, Adore him, who to compass all this dies, Adore the Son, and honour him as mee. No sooner had th' Almighty ceas't, but all The multitude of Angels with a shout Loud as from numbers without number, sweet</page><page sequence="19">Peter C. Herman 199 As from blest voices, uttering joy, Heav'n rung With Jubilee, and loud Hosanna's filld Th' eternal Regions: lowly reverent Towards either Throne they bow, and to the ground With solemn adoration down they cast Thir Crowns. (3.313-52) On the other hand, in book 5 Raphael narrates another El- evation, this one occurring during a meeting of "th' Empyreal Host" (5.583) before the Creation ("As yet this world was not, and Chaos wilde / Reigned where these Heav'ns now rowl, where Earth now rests" [5.577-8]): Hear all ye Angels, Progenie of Light, Thrones, Dominations, Princedoms, Vertues, Powers, Hear my Decree, which unrevok't shall stand. This day I have begot whom I declare My onely Son, and on this holy Hill Him have anointed, whom ye now behold At my right hand; your Head I him appoint; And by my Self have sworn to him shall bow All knees in Heav'n, and shall confess him Lord: Under his great Vice-gerent Reign abide United as one individual soule For ever happie: him who disobeyes Mee disobeyes, breaks union, and that day Cast out from God and blessed vision, falls Into utter darkness, deep ingulft, his place Ordaind without redemption, without end. So spake th' Omnipotent, and with his words All seem'd well pleas'd, all seem'd, but were not all. (5.600-17) It might very well be that these narratives describe separate events (which would beg the question of why the Son needs to be elevated twice), yet there are considerable parallels between them. As we have seen, both narratives confirm that God elevates the Son before the assembled angels. Both narratives also confirm that the Son will rule all of Heaven's inhabitants,47 all of whom will bow to their new ruler,48 and that the Angels must obey the Son as they would the Father.49 These similarities, along with the pattern of doubled narratives, argue that Raphael and the Epic</page><page sequence="20">200 Milton's Poetics of Incertitude Voice retell the same event. So the question becomes, how does one choose between them? Presumably, Raphael was among the assembled angels, but if Milton is right, so was the Epic Voice, who, Milton says, "from the first / Wast present" (1.18-9). While some critics have noted that Raphael can legitimately be called an unreliable narrator, and as we have seen, his version of Adam and Eve's creation does not match Adam's,50 it is not clear if this occasion is one of those times. Both narrators, it would seem, have an equal claim to authority (one is the Muse, the other a witness to the event), which renders deciding when exactly the Elevation occurs impossible. The differing chronology is only the beginning, for the two also depart in their sense of the event's tone and the content of God's speech to the assembled angels. The Epic Voice recalls a much softer speech, in which God predicates Christ's Elevation on his "Merits" (3.317) and on his offer to sacrifice himself (how- ever temporarily) on behalf on humankind: "Adore him, who to compass all this dies, / Adore the Son, and honour him as mee" (3.342-3). Raphael, on the other hand, recounts an elevation with- out a cause. God simply assembles everybody and-without men- tioning merit-announces that he has "anointed" the Son: "your Head I him appoint" (5.605). The tone is much harsher, which leads to the two most important differences between the two speeches: the threat of punishment and the reaction of the an- gels. The Epic Voice in book 3 has God conclude after the com- mand to adore the Son, and the angels go wild abasing themselves. In Raphael's version in book 5, God appends his famous threat: him who disobeyes, Mee disobeyes, breaks union, and that day Cast out from God and blessed vision, falls Into utter darkness, deep ingulft, his place Ordaind without redemption, without end. (5.611-5) The angels react accordingly: "All seem'd well pleas'd" (5.617), which is much more restrained and ambiguous, given the pres- ence of "seem'd," than No sooner had th' Almighty ceas't, but all The multitude of Angels with a shout Loud as from numbers without number, sweet As from blest voices, uttering joy, Heav'n rung</page><page sequence="21">Peter C. Herman 201 With Jubilee, and loud Hosanna's filld Th' eternal Regions. (3.344-9) Generosity and love inform the Epic Voice's account, and the Angels react accordingly. God commands and threatens in Raphael's version, divine love is notoriously absent, and while the Angels may be, for the most part, "well pleas'd" (5.617), they do not bow "to the ground" and cast down their crowns "With solemn adoration" (3.350- 1). In addition, if the Epic Voice is right, then Satan was not fore- warned as to the consequences of rebellion; but if Raphael is correct, then Satan was forewarned. Which divine narrator has it right? Which to believe? Which version does the reader privilege? The Miltonic "Or," therefore, inscribes incertitude at the heart of Paradise Lost. Just as Milton explicitly scatters "or" through- out his poem, often offering the reader choices between oppo- sites that he declines to settle, so does he implicitly situate an "or" between the differing narratives of the poem's central events. Just as Milton presents the reader with an explicit choice be- tween Satan as Typhon or Satan as Briareos, between Eve's gar- dening tools coming from an Angel or from rude art, and between Satan as a hungry wolf or as a greedy thief, he also presents the reader with an implicit Miltonic "Or" between radically different narratives of the poem's most important events, and the reader does not know, cannot know, which, if any, is the accurate version. IV The poetics of incertitude exemplified by the Miltonic "Or" has a long and distinguished history in Milton's poetry and prose. He structures L'Allegro/Il Penseroso, we might recall, as a choice between opposites (L'Allegrian frivolity versus Penserosian philo- sophic melancholy) that he continuously undoes by blurring the distinctions between the two.51 Similarly, as Fish has shown, Milton structures Comus as "a continually exfoliating pattern of paired antitheses,"52 as exemplified by the concluding lines: Love vertue, she alone is free She can teach ye how to clime Higher than the Spheary chime; Or if Vertue feeble were, Heav'n itself would stoop to her. (1020-4; my emphasis)</page><page sequence="22">202 Milton's Poetics of Incertitude Anticipating the unresolved choices in Paradise Lost, Milton presents virtue as either powerful or feeble, capable of teaching how to climb, or so weak that "Heav'n itself would stoop to her." And Fish has pointed out in a series of articles the presence of precisely these kinds of self-consuming "or's" throughout Milton's prose.53 Therefore, there is nothing atypical or unprecedented in Milton's structuring Paradise Lost around the unresolved "or." Yet if the poetics of incertitude animates Milton's early poetry and prose, it has a different purpose in those texts than in Para- dise Lost. Rather than reflecting his unease about poetry or his concerns for the limitations of human reason and press censor- ship, the Miltonic "Or" in Paradise Lost reflects Milton's uncer- tainties after the Revolution collapsed. At this point, it is worth recalling that despite the many as- sertions that Milton maintained an Abdiel-esque faith in God in the face of the Restoration, he worried enough about staying alive to go underground until he received official assurances that he would not be executed. As Edward Phillips remembers, this time "his next removal was, by the advice of those that wisht him well, and had a concern for his preservation, into a place of retirement and abscondence, till such time as the current of affairs for the future should instruct him what farther course to take; it was a Friend's House in Bartholomew-Close, where he liv'd till the Act of Oblivion came forth; which it pleased God, prov'd as favourable to.him as could be hop'd or expected, through the intercession of some that stood his Friends both in Council and Parliament."54 Milton and his friends feared for his life, and both took steps to preserve it rather than standing up, like Abdiel, before a hos- tile audience and likely being executed for the dead republican cause. In other words, despite the many assertions in the prose of confidence in divine protection, after the fact of the Revolution's demise, Milton trusts himself and his friends to preserve him, not God. Furthermore, while many critics often use the De Doctrina Christiana as a guide for Paradise Lost, it seems that Milton aban- doned working on this text at the Restoration to concentrate on writing verse.55 His segueing from theology to epic poetry, how- ever, might indicate more than a change of genres that accompa- nied a change of residence from his house to a place of "abscondence." Milton may very well, as Norbrook suggests, have abandoned the De Doctrina Christiana because "the spirit of free religious inquiry was associated for him with civil liberty," and civil liberty no longer existed.56 But in addition, the movement</page><page sequence="23">Peter C. Herman 203 from De Doctrina Christiana to Paradise Lost also entailed a move- ment from confidence to doubt. While the De Doctrina may at times put forward contradictory positions, even a casual glance shows that the unqualified assertion constitutes its basic rhe- torical mode.57 As such, there is a match between form and con- tent, theology being "constituted upon a fundamental immobility and a reassuring certitude," as Jacques Derrida puts it in an- other context,58 of God's existence and goodness. In addition, as Regina Schwartz has argued, Milton is so confident of his right- ness that he places "his own system of divinity in the authorized position... [,] turning the Bible into a gloss-on Milton."59 One can assume that Milton also built his theology and self-confi- dence on the reassuring certitude of God's approbation of the Revolution. But after the Restoration, the center can no longer hold. If previously, "with this certitude anxiety can be mastered," the dis- appearance of the center, which we can identify as Milton's as- surance that God is on the republican's side, allows anxiety to spill over.60 Doubts can no longer be contained and concepts once marked by a "fundamental immobility" now seem unstable at best. Consequently, Milton fills Paradise Lost with larger and smaller instances of unresolved, aporetic choices that reflect his own unresolved, aporetic state. In conclusion, while the Miltonic "Or" figures in many ways as a constant in Milton's writing, in Paradise Lost an ingrained habit of mind collided with the demise of his political dreams. If the stability that many critics desire to see (perhaps because sta- bility is reassuring)61 in this poem exists, it does not result from the balance of perfectly matched proportions or serene confidence, but from the pressure of equally powerful opposing forces, like massive tectonic plates pressing against each other. The stasis, in other words, results from unresolved and perhaps unresolvable tensions, not serenity or a penchant for embracing all positions. Riven by the Revolution's demise, the resulting vacillation be- tween hope and despair, affirmation and renunciation, anger and resignation, finds expression in the procession of undecided and undecidable moments instantiated by the Miltonic "Or."

John Peter, in A Critique of "Para- dise Lost" (New York: Columbia Univ. Press, 1960), also takes Milton to task for supposed aesthetic failures-"It can be seen that many of Milton's diffi- culties with God arise from his imperfectly anthropomorphic presentation" (p. 18)-and he devotes a good part of his analysis to stating what Milton should have done to avoid these problems (e.g., "[God's] dwelling 'in unapproached light' should have been relatively unapproached; the inces- sant contradictions and improvisations should have been rigorously sup- pressed. If God is omniscient then as little as possible should be said about angels serving as his 'Eyes' [3.650]" [p. 17]; the first emphasis is the author's, the rest are mine). 4 Catherine Gimelli Martin, The Ruins of Allegory: "Paradise Lost" and the Metamorphosis ofEpic Convention (Durham NC: Duke Univ.

The discrepancy between a vital chaos and a chaos that harbors a corner of inertness measures the distance be- tween the faith Milton held in popular sovereignty in the period between 1649 and 1651 and his soberer resignation, articu- lated most fully at the end of the republican decade, to a per- petual parliament of like-minded oligarchs empowered to</page><page sequence="25">Peter C.

Bartlett Giamatti, A Free and Ordered Space: The Real World of the University (New York: Norton, 1990), pp. 29-30. 9 Charles Eric Reeves provides a textbook example of how this masterplot operates. Faced with the problem of what to do with Raphael's warning to Adam (since Raphael had to have witnessed the colloquy between the Son and the Father in book 3, he knows that any warning will be futile except to deflect blame from God), Reeves posits two Raphaels, one present for book 3, the other without foreknowledge of the fall ("'Lest Wilfully Transgressing': Raphael's Narration and Knowledge in Paradise Lost," MiltonS 34 [1996]: 83- 98, 91-2). Moreover, Reeves is completely frank in how a predetermined conclusion governs his analysis: "Precisely how to make the tvo-present and future, freedom and fore-knowledge-cohere, given what we know from our reading of the poem as a whole, is a task that can not be managed on purely logical/theological grounds or on purely rhetorical grounds. What we require is an understanding that is, on Stanley Fish's terms, 'split': respond- ing to both 'the ever present pressure of Christian doctrine' and 'the experi- ence of individual poetic moments.' We must see Raphael simultaneously under the aspect of heavenly timelessness and earthly, if unfallen, temporal- ity" (p. 90, my emphasis; Reeves does not provide citations for his quotes from Fish). My point is, why do we have to make the two cohere? Why must we resolve the paradox? One can find instances of how this masterplot governs Milton criticism in general in Mark Womack, "On the Value of Lycidas," SEL 37, 1 (Winter 1997): 119-36, which argues that "Lycidas does not cohere in any single system of organization but in a multitude of overlapping patterning sys- tems" (p. 120) and that "[t]aken together, the various patterns manage to contain the incoherent elements present in individual patterns" (p. 121). One can also find such instances in William Kerrigan, 'The Irrational Coher- ence of Samson Agonistes," MiltonS 22 (1986): 217-32. 10 Fish, "Preface to the Second Edition," in Surprised by Sin: The Reader in Paradise Lost, 2d edn.

While I am deeply indebted to Empson, both for specific details and for being among the first to ask hard questions of Para- dise Lost without assuming that the answer must conform to orthodoxy, he and I differ on the matter of certainty. Simply put, I see Milton as produc- tively confused; Empson, like most other critics before and after him, retains a sense of Milton's certainty. 14 Rumrich, Milton Unbound, p. 24. 15 See Peter C.

Mythologiae, trans. Jean Baudoin (Paris, 1627; rprt. New York: Garland, 1976), sig. HHh (vol. 1, book 6, chap. 21; p. 637). William King, who comes after Milton, more or less conflates Homer and Hesiod: "and therefore Juno, Neptune and Pallas conspir'd against [Jupiter], and threw him into Bonds, from which he was delivered by Cottus, Gyges, and Briareus the Gyants, who then were es- teemed as the faithful Guards of Jupiter's Person, and were call'd by Thetis to his timely Assistance" (An Historical Account of the Heathen Gods and Heroes [Carbondale: Southern Illinois Univ. Press, 1965], p. 58). 35 Paul de Man, Allegories of Reading: Figural Language in Rousseau, Nietzsche, and Proust (New Haven: Yale Univ. Press, 1979), p. 72. 36 Christopher Grose, for example, writes that "Milton omits the conclu- sion-at least it is not rehearsed-but the ending, like the meaning of the simile, is hardly in doubt" (Milton's Epic Process: "Paradise Lost" and Its Miltonic Background [New Haven: Yale Univ. Press, 1973], p. 152), and Linda Gregerson agrees: the morning "will presumably disclose to the pilot his doom" ('"The Limbs of Truth: Milton's Use of Simile in Paradise Lost," MiltonS 14 [1980]: 135-52, 142), as does Roland Mushat Frye: "Just as Leviathan lured seamen to anchor on the seeming security of his great bulk, only then to plunge to the bottom of the sea and destroy them, so Satan had already lured his angelic followers to Hell and would so lure many deceived men and women in future ages" (Milton's Imagery and the Visual Arts: Iconographic Tradition in the Epic Poems [Princeton: Princeton Univ. Press, 1978], p. 93), as well as Flannagan (Riverside Milton, p. 360 n. 80). Grose also notes that many of the similes precipitate "perceptual crises" (pp. 141, 150), but he concludes that the disjunctions are only apparent: "But judging from this and other images, it would seem that in Paradise Lost he deliberately blurs any static pattern we might discover, pretending to discover instead multiple or ambiguous correspondences, and even an entire world of analogy" (p. 153; my emphasis). The "error" (meaning both mistake and wandering) of the similes "bring[s] us closer . . . to the highest kind of awareness in the poem, contained ultimately in God's 'prospect high'" (p. 154).</page><page sequence="28">208 Milton's Poetics of Incertitude 37 De Man, p. 76. 38 "What are Sheaves bound up in a Barn to the Phalanx, that hem'd Satan? where's the least Similitude?"

I have silently corrected f to s). 39 Vergil, Aeneid, 12.1264. 401 am indebted to Elizabeth Sauer's important book, Barbarous Disso- nance and Images of Voice in Milton's Epics (Montreal: McGill-Queen's Univ. Press, 1996), for her resonant parsing of the multiple voices in Paradise Lost. Sauer, however, comes to a different conclusion than I do: "In each chapter I also identify strategies adopted by the poet to order the confusion and to create a community of voices that remains for Milton a conceptual rather than a real possibility" (Barbarous Dissonance, p. 10). In my analysis, Milton does not order the confusion, as confusion is the point. See also Wittreich, who notes that the poem is about "competing interpretations [and] the status that should be accorded each of them" ("'Inspir'd with Contradic- tion': Mapping Gender Discourses in Paradise Lost," p. 142). 41 As the anonymous reader of this essay for this journal rightly points out, sometimes the differing narratives are in synch with each other. Both God and Satan, for example, admit that Adam and Eve are deceived. The agreement, however, between God and Satan (who one would think would agree about nothing) only puts into relief the Epic Narrator's assertion that only Eve is deceived. 42 Wittreich, "'Inspir'd with Contradiction': Mapping Gender Discourses in Paradise Lost," p. 144. 43 Adam's version of events seems to dovetail with God's speech to the Son: "well thou know'st how dear / To me are all my works, nor Man the least / Though last created" (3.276-8). The difference, however, is that while Adam recognizes Eve's existence, God never does either in this speech or in his (in)famous initial address to the Son (3.80-135). For Milton's God, "Man" means Adam, a fact which God makes explicit when he enjoins the Son: Thir Nature also to thy Nature joyn; And be thy self Man among men on Earth Be thou in Adams room The Head of all mankind, though Adams Son. (3.282-6) 44 Surprisingly, while critics note that Adam and Eve have their own versions of their first meeting, the relationship between these two versions has not received extensive treatment, the dominant assumption being that Adam's narrative dominates Eve's in an exact parallel to how men are sup- posed to dominate women within patriarchy. See Christine Froula, "When Eve Reads Milton: Undoing the Canonical Economy," Critl 10, 2 (December 1983): 321-47, 328-9; Diane Kelsey McColley, Milton's Eve (Urbana: Univ. of Illinois Press, 1983), pp. 80-5; Martin, The Ruins of Allegory, pp. 267-8; Elizabeth Mazzola, "Milton's Eve as Closed Corpus, Open Book, and Apocry- phal Text," in "All in All": Unity, Diversity, and the Miltonic Perspective, pp. 83-99, 84-5; and Wittreich, "'He Ever Was a Dissenter,'" pp. 21-40, 34-5.</page><page sequence="29">Peter C. Herman 209 Sauer analyzes Adam's and Eve's narratives separately, but only once con- siders the relationship between the two: "Adam's autobiographical narrative responds not only to Raphael's history but also to Eve's, which it, however, overshadows" (Barbarous Dissonances, pp. 105-6). 45 It is possible, though, that Adam's "pleaded reason" (8.510) refers to further speech between these two. 46 Labriola and Robert Thomas Fallon say that it happens in book 5 (Labriola, pp. 40-3; Fallon in Divided Empire: Milton's Political Imagery [Uni- versity Park: Pennsylvania State Univ. Press, 1995], pp. 47-51). Stephen M. Buhler, on the other hand, says that it happens in book 3 ("Kingly States: The Politics in Paradise Lost," MiltonS 28 [1992]: 49-58, 52-3). Blair Worden conflates the two narratives ("Milton's Republicanism and the Tyranny of Heaven," in Machiavelli and Republicanism, ed. Gisela Bock, Quentin Skin- ner, and Maurizio Viroli [Cambridge: Cambridge Univ. Press, 1990], pp. 225- 45, 238-9), as does Mary Anne Radzinowicz ('"The Politics of Paradise Lost," in The Politics of Discourse: The Literature and History of Seventeenth-Cen- tury England, ed. Kevin Sharpe and Steven N. Zwicker [Berkeley: Univ. of California Press, 1987], pp. 204-29, 209-10). Fowler proposes that there are in fact two Elevations, as does David Loewenstein. In their chronologies of Paradise Lost, both locate the "First exaltation" in book 5, although neither indicates when the second one occurs (Fowler, p. 26; Loewenstein, Milton: Paradise Lost [Cambridge: Cambridge Univ. Press, 1993], p. xv). This expe- dient bears a close resemblance to Anne Barton's positing that in Henry V, Shakespeare provides the audience with two visits to his troops, one de- scribed by the Chorus, the other put on stage by Shakespeare's players, in order to resolve the flagrant contradictions between the Chorus's view of the play and the play itself ('"The King Disguised: Shakespeare's Henry V and the Comical History," in The Triple Bond: Plays, Mainly Shakespearean, in Per- formance, ed. Joseph G. Price [University Park: Pennsylvania State Univ. Press, 1975], pp. 92-117). Rumrich, in private correspondence, suggests that books 3 and 5 "participate in the eternal moment as it is dilated in time." 47 Book 3 says: all Power I give thee, reign for ever, and assume Thy Merits; under thee as Head Supream Thrones, Princedoms, Powers, Dominions I reduce (3.317-20) while book 5 reads: "your Head I him appoint" (5.606). 48 Book 3: "All knees to thee shall bow" (3.321); book 5: "And by my Self have sworn to him shall bow / All knees in Heav'n, and shall confess him Lord" (5.607-8). 49 Book 3: "Adore the Son, and honour him as mee" (3.343); book 5: "him who disobeyes / Mee disobeyes" (5.611-2). 50so Donald F.

See Rumrich, p. 154 n. 39, and his introduc- tion, co-authored with Dobranski, to their anthology, Milton and Heresy, pp. 6-11, as well as his article in the same volume, "Milton's Arianism: Why It Matters," pp. 75-92, 75-7. 56 Norbrook, p. 479. 57 E.g., from Milton, De Doctrina:"The second kind of external efficiency is commonly called CREATION. Anyone who asks what God did before the creation of the world is a fool; and anyone who answers him is not much wiser" (chap. 7, "Of the Creation" [pp. 1174-8, 1174]; that Milton devotes a significant amount of Paradise Lost to answering this supposedly foolish question should not go unnoted); 'The tree of the knowledge of good and evil was not a sacrament, as is commonly thought, for sacraments are meant to be used, not abstained from; but it was a kind of pledge or memorial of obedience" (chap. 10, "Of the Special Government of Man before the Fall," pp. 1180-9, 1180); "But the first and more important point is the mutual consent of the parties concerned, for there can be no love or good will, and therefore no marriage, between those whom mutual consent has not united" (chap. 10, pp. 1180-9, 1185).

As such, I have in mind a much more quotidian defi- nition of anxiety than that employed by John S. Tanner in Anxiety in Eden: A Kierkegaardian Reading of "Paradise Lost" (New York: Oxford Univ. Press, 1992). Interesting and provocative as I find this text, my sense of Milton's anxiety is grounded upon historicizing Paradise Lost, which is resolutely not within the purview of Tanner's project. 61 On the continuing predominance of what Empson called the "neo- Christian" in Milton studies, see Rumrich, Milton Unbound, pp. 1-23.
