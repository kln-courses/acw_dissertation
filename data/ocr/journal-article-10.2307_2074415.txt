ROBERT D. BENFORD University of Nebraska, Lincoln Although not new, moral crusades seem to be appearing on the political landscape more frequently these days. This trend is intriguing to scholars of social movements and political sociologists, but disturbing to advocates of pluralism. The trend is intriguing because it's occurring simultaneously at both ends of the political spectrum. Movements on the Left such as the radical environmental, radical feminist, and animal fights movements appear to be as moralistic in their rhetoric as the antiabortion, creationist, and Moral Majority movements on the Right. Their dramatic tactics and strident rhetoric elicit national media coverage and hostile reactions from their targets. The trend is also intriguing to scholars because it cries out for explanation. Why the movement toward moral crusades? Toward absolutist discourse? Toward confron- tational tactics?</page><page sequence="2">556 REVIEWS Yet the trend is seen by some as disturbing. Among policymakers and scholars, pluralists seem to be most concerned. How can disputes between competing interest groups be settled if the parties are uncompromising? How can conflicts be rationally arbitrated if the differ- ences are framed purely in moral terms? How can a democratic dialogue be sustained when the disputants resort to name calling and vilifying one another? In The Animal Rights Crusade: The Growth of a Moral Protest, James M. Jasper and Dor- othy Nelkin seem both intrigued and disturbed by the animal rights crusade. Fortunately, they were sufficiently intrigued to collect a monu- mental number of data (primarily from move- ment and extramovement documents) and to organize them into an informative and engag- ing monograph. Unfortunately, their apparently uncritical embrace of pluralism occasionally clouds their interpretation. Otherwise, The Animal Rights Crusade is descriptively rich, sociologically compelling, and masterfully crafted. Jasper and Nelkin offer a guided tour of the animal rights movements from its historical and cultural roots to the dramatic and sometimes illegal tactics of the 1990s. They trace the move- ment's origins to Western industrialization and urbanization, macro processes that changed people's orientations toward animals. Ani- mals became less the "instruments of labor and production," and "city dwellers began to encounter animals only as family pets" (p. 4). Jasper and Nelkin assert that these trends added momentum to the long-standing ten- dency to regard animals in human terms. This growing "sentimental anthropomorphism" con- tributed significantly to the construction of animal rights ideology and to the emergence of a moral crusade. The authors elaborate upon the movement's diversity, its intramural conflicts, and its relationship with other movements, especially environmentalism, vegetarianism, and vari- ous New Age movements. They dissect the movement into three wings: welfarist, prag- matist, and fundamentalist. Welfare groups like the SPCA and Humane Society view animals as the "objects of compassion" which deserve the care and protection of humans. Pragmatists go further, claiming that animals deserve "moral consideration," that people ought to seek a balance between the interests of animals and humans. Fundamen- talists, the movement's "extremists," argue against "speciesism" in favor of total elimi- nation of all animal exploitation. From this perspective, all animals have inherent "moral rights" to live without human interference. Much of the book focuses on the cam- paigns, tactics, and rhetoric of the pragmatists and fundamentalists, and on their relative effectiveness. Jasper and Nelkin elaborate on the movement's struggles to save animals in the wild, halt animal testing by cosmetic drug companies, abolish vivisection and other biomedical research on animals, stop using animals as commodities especially for food and clothing, and eliminate the public display of animals for the entertainment of humans. They also describe and analyze the reactions of the movement's opponents in industry, medicine, and academia. For campaign after campaign the authors assert that the pragmatists have succeeded, while the fundamentalists have failed, be- cause the former are more willing to negoti- ate, communicate, and compromise. They seem to imply throughout that, if anything, the movement's radical flank has undernined the otherwise valiant and more reasonable approach of the movement's moderate fac- tions. Yet there is a great deal of evidence from other movements to suggest that move- ment radicals and moderates complement one another. Jasper and Nelkin's own data suggest this has been so for the animal rights movement. Many of the institutional conces- sions that the authors attribute solely to the efforts of the pragmatists were won because of the existence of a contentious wing. My only other major criticism of this work is that the authors lack an analytical framework to organize and talk about one of the main themes of the book: which movement (and counter- movement) claims or framings succeeded, which ones did not, and why. The various social con- structionist and cultural frameworks being de- veloped by scholars of social movements and social problems would have served the authors well in analyzing movement discussion, fram- ing, and claims making. On balance, however, The Animal Rights Crusade is an excellent piece of scholarship. It will appeal to a wide variety of activists, students, and scholars, especially those inter- ested in culture, politics, environmental sociology, and collective behavior and social movements.</page></plain_text>
