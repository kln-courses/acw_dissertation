<plain_text><page sequence="1">CONCEPTIONS OF GOD AMONG MODERN SEMITES. By PROFESSOR SAMUE.L IVES CURTISS, PH.D., D.D., Chicago Theological Seminary. DR. W. L. THOMPSON, of the American Board,' says that "the Tongas have a hazy idea of God as the first cause, but the worship of spirits and ancestors is more of a power in their lives."'' The same statement is true of those modern Semites who have not been affected by the teaching of Islam, or by that of ancient Christianity. These are to be found among ignorant peasants in Syria and Palestine, as well as among various tribes of Arabs.3 In conducting our investigations it is not easy to discover whether the conceptions of God which exist today among them, however shadowy, have come from the instruction of Moslem sheiks, who often teach the Bedouins, at least for a brief period, 1 Of Mount Silinda, East Central African Mission. 2 Personal interview, Journal, X, spring of Igoi. 3 While the terms "Arab" and "Bedouin" are sometimes used interchangeably, there is properly a clear difference in usage, as indicated by Lane (see his Arabic-English Lexicon). Lane defines El'Arab as: " Those who have alighted and made their abode in the cultivated regions, and have taken as their homes the Arabian cities and towns or villages, and others also that are related to them . . . . an appellation of common application [to the whole nation] . ... [and in the lexicons . ... applied to the desert Arabs of pure speech]." Hence this term is frequently used, not only of those Arabs who have begun to cultivate the fields, but also of those who live in towns. It may be used of the inhabitants of the desert, of pure nomads, but not exclu- sively so. On the other hand Bedawy, according to the same eminent authority, signifies: " Of, or belonging to, or relating to, the bedw, or desert; and, used as a substantive, a man, and particularly an Arab, of the desert." The Bedouins never live in towns, never cultivate the soil, but gain their livelihood by raids, and regard with unspeakable disdain those who have forsaken the nomad life to live even in part by the tillage of the soil. The term Fellahin, which signifies " plowmen," is used of the peasant class. It is among the Fellahin and the Bedouins, as least affected by Islam, that we should expect the largest results in these investigations with respect to the survivals of ancient Semitic religion. 122</page><page sequence="2">CONCEPTIONS OF GOD AMONG MODERN SEMITES 123 the tenets of Islam,4 or whether we have the, same phenomenon among them as that which has been pointed out by Andrew Lang in his Making of Religion,s where the worship of God and of inferior deities, without the influence of "positive religion," 6 exists side by side. Nor can we determine whether the concep- tion of God now found among the Bedouins is an evolution from the conditions of tribal life, so that God is but a superhuman sheik. This is a domain in which further investigations are necessary. The opinions and reports of travelers are too frag- mentary to supply adequate data for an induction. It must be remembered that the modern Semite does not reason with respect to religious matters. By nature imagina- tive and impressionable, his ideas regarding the divine being are rather pictures left on his mind than the result of any philo- sophical reflection, since he does not philosophize. He is not at all disturbed by views which are inconsistent, hence mutually exclusive.7 He will admit that according to the tenets of Islam he should be a fatalist, whose life cannot by prayers, tears, or 4It was the testimony of Habeeb Yadgi, of Mehardeh, who is remarkably familiar with the customs of the Arabs, from personal observation, that "there are scarcely any religious sheiks among the Bedouins. If they have no religious sheik, they send for one to attend a funeral. He has seen the Arabs come to Karyaten, in the Syrian desert, for such a sheik." On the other hand, the chief of the Rawaein, a small tribe that migrates past Palmyra, affirms that " every body of Arabs has a religious sheik" (Journal, XII, summer of 1901). This latter statement is improbable. LADY BLUNT, Bedouin Tribes of the Eupfrates (London, 1879), Vol. II, p. 217, testifies: "The Shammar, alone of all the noble tribes we visited, possessed a mollah; and his duties with them were in no way of a priestly character." s Pp. 178 ff. 6W. ROBERTSON SMITH, Lectures on the Religion of the Semites (New York, 1889), p. I: "Judaism, Christianity, and Islam are positive religions, that is, they did not grow up, like the systems of ancient heathenism, under the action of unconscious forces operating silently from age to age, but trace their origin to the teaching of great religious innovators, who spoke as the organs of a divine revelation, and deliberately departed from the traditions of the past." 7 PALGRAVE, Narrative of a Year's Journey through Central and Eastern Arabia (London, 1865), Vol. I, p. 68: "The Arabs are, generally speaking, rather a believ- ing than a religious nation. .... Men who readily grant an abstract belief to every- thing are not unlikely to reconcile, in a practical way, the many contradictions thus admitted into their theory by acting on nothing. Christian, Jewish, Mahometan, or pagan creeds and forms - the Arab, when left to himself, does not see why they should not all be equally true, equally estimable."</page><page sequence="3">124 THE BIBLICAL WORLD sacrifices be prolonged one day after the limit decreed has expired; he will confess his belief in fatalism, and then will justify a usage entirely inconsistent with such a belief by naively saying: " This is according to the simplicity of our minds."8 The simplicity of the Semitic mind accounts for the survival of ancient customs which have been handed down from the remotest antiquity, notwithstanding the teachings of Islam or Christianity. To the Arab or Syrian, custom is mightier than right; indeed, custom is the only right he knows. Both morality and religion depend upon it. The heavens might sooner fall than custom be set aside. If we can get at the usage of the Semite, we shall know what his religion is. Another principle which we must remember to be deeply ingrained in the divine, as well as in the human, economy, is the belief that might makes right. In the words of another: "God makes right by edict."9 In the same category belongs the con- viction that God can be bought; that is, that he is bribable. This is the experience that every oriental has had of human government; he naturally has the same view of the divine. From the foregoing it is easy to see that the modern Semite has no ethical conception of God as holy or as just; hence we shall find that his views of sin are entirely deficient and do not possess a moral quality. He is not afraid to take God's name in vain, or to swear falsely by him,'0 or to use the name in the most shameful connections." It is certain that such a conception of 8 The Servant of the Chair, after saying: " Every building must have its death, man, woman, child, or animal. God has appointed a redemption for every building through sacrifice. If God has accepted the sacrifice, he has redeemed the house," added : " This is according to the simplicity of our minds; of course, every man dies when his time comes" (Journal, X, summer of 1901o). This expression recurred in different forms a number of times, showing that the Arab, or Syrian, was conscious of the contrast between ancient usage and the tenets of Islam. 9" The oriental mind has not the same idea of abstract right and wrong as the occidental. He thinks God makes right and wrong by edict." (Interview with Rev. George E. Post, M.D., of the Syrian Protestant College, Beirut (Journal, X, summer of 1900).) 10 Of this there are abundant examples, it is affirmed everywhere, and see DOUGHTY, Travels in Arabia Deserta (Cambridge, I888), Vol. I, p. 266. " LANE, An Account of the Manners and Customs of the Modern Egyptians (London, 1896), pp. 286, 287.</page><page sequence="4">CONCEPTIONS OF GOD AMONG MODERN SEMITES 125 God has no power to affect the life of the Syrian or Bedouin. Nor need we find it at variance with the representations which have been given of him by most travelers. It may well be that Palgrave is right when he claims that " a general belief in the Supreme Being, Author of all, and Ruler of all, has from time immemorial prevailed throughout Arabia."'" Nor does such a belief serve to cloud their hopes of the future life, or to check a spirit of cheerful bravado when brought to think of appearing before a God who is neither just nor holy. This is well illustrated by another quotation from Palgrave: "What will you do on coming into God's presence for judgment after so graceless a life ? " said I one day to a spirited young Sherarat ..... " What will we do? " was his unhesitating answer; "why, we will go up to God and salute him, and if he proves hospitable (gives us meat and tobacco), we will stay with him; if otherwise, we will mount our horses and ride off." This is a fair specimen of Bedouin ideas touching another world. .... Nor did I ever meet, among the genuine nomad tribes, with any individual who took a more spiritual view, whether of the Deity, of the soul of man, or of any other disembodied being soever. God is for them a chief, residing mainly, it would seem, in the sun, with which, indeed, they in a manner identify him . somewhat more powerful, of course, than their own head man, .... but in other respects of much the same style and character.!3 Lady Blunt's characterization of the Bedouin's relation to God gives no disclosure of him as a just or holy being, but rather as one possessed of superior power: A belief, then, in God certainly exists among the Bedouins, though the only active form of it is a submission to the divine will. It stands in singular correspondence with the religion of the ancient patriarchs. At the present day, no doubt, it is but a vague reflection of ancient faith, and depends as much upon custom as any other belief or prejudice of the Bedouin mind.'4 Perhaps an exceptional consciousness of sin and a religion that is beautiful, and, it would almost seem, exceptional, among the sons of the desert, as observed among the Towarah in the Sinaitic peninsula, is indicated in some Bedouin prayers overheard and reported by Professor Palmer. The following is a specimen of one at sunset : 1 PALGRAVE, ot. cit., Vol. I, p. 249. '3 Ibid., p. 33.

In all that we hear or see, in all that we say or do, be gracious unto us ! Have mercy upon our friends who have passed away before us. I ask pardon of the great God. I ask pardon at the sunset, when every sinner turns to him. Now and forever, I ask pardon of God. O Lord, cover us from our sins, guard our children, and protect our weaker friends ! Again, at sunrise they pray: I seek refuge with the great God from Satan accursed with stones. Deliver me from evil, provide for me and for my brethren the faithful . O Lord, uncover not our inmost faults, protect our children and our weaker friends. O Lord, provide for me, thou who providest for the blind hyena! These higher and better conceptions of God may well have been inspired by the teachings of Islam. This seems likely from the formula with which they preface every prayer: " I desire to pray and to seek guidance from God; for good and pure prayers come from God alone. Peace be upon our Lord Abra- ham and our Lord Mohammed."'5 Besides, they are able to recite from memory certain sections of the Koran, as I was assured at one of their festivals.'6 It is doubtless true that among the majority of the Fellahin and Arabs their conceptions of God have been modified by their habits and condition, if we may not affirm that they have been derived from them. Hence, to them God is the author of good and evil."7 No sheik with whom they have had to do, no emir or sultan of whom they have ever heard, is the author of good alone. This is an old Semitic conception which we find illus- trated in the Old Testament. Job says, with respect to the appalling calamities which have befallen him in the loss of prop- erty and children: "What ? shall we receive good at the hand of God, and shall we not receive evil ?," 8 So it is "an evil spirit from the Lord " that troubles Saul.'9 Thus, "The anger of the Lord was kindled against Israel, and he moved David against them, saying, Go, number Israel and Judah."20 The same fear Is The Desert of the Exodus (New York, 1872), pp. 86, 87. 116 ournal, IV, spring of 1899, in the Sinaitic peninsula. 17 LADY BLUNT, op. cit., Vol. II, pp. 216, 217: " God is the fate to which all must bow, the cause of the good and of the evil in life ... of the fertility of their flocks, and of the murrains which sometimes afflict them."

It is interesting to note that the theology of later Judaism has amended the passage to read: "And Satan stood up against Israel and moved David to number Israel."21 Amos speaks from the old point of view when he asks: "Shall evil befall a city, and the Lord hath not done it ? "22 Closely connected with this is the thought that God may lead astray. Thus Suleiman, a teacher in a school of the Irish Pres- byterian Church in Nebk, who made the most careful investi- gations for me during more than two months, interviewing Moslems and Christians, Fellahin and Bedouin, at the sugges- tion of Rev. J. Stewart Crawford, said as the result of many interviews with many kinds of people: "Their view is that God is the Creator of heaven and earth, the Maker of all men, the Giver of good to all. He may also lead astray. The ignorant know up to this point." 23 This is evidently a survival of an ancient Semitic conception, which, we find, gives coloring to certain Old Testament passages, as, for example, when the Lord is represented as saying of Pharaoh: "I will harden his heart;" 24 and Isaiah represents God as bidding him: " Make the heart of this people fat, and make their ears heavy, and smear their eyes, lest they should see with their eyes, and hear with their ears, and perceive with their heart, and should convert, and be healed." 25 I do not, of course, believe that these passages teach that God leads man astray, but they are certainly colored by this idea. Another passage, read literally, expresses the view that God makes the enemies of his people guilty. I refer to Ps. 5: II, where the psalmist prays, according to the Hebrew idiom, "Make them guilty, O God;" which the Revisers well translate, "Hold them guilty, O God," or, perhaps better, "Declare them guilty, O God," that is, "Let them suffer the .x I Chron. 21: I. 22 Amos 3 :6. 23Journal, X, summer of 19go, Syrian desert. 24 Exod. 4: 21, cf. 9 : 12 ; IO :20, 27; II : IO; 14 : 4, 8, 17. 25 Isa. 6: 9, 1o (Hebrew).</page><page sequence="7">128 THE BIBLICAL WORLD consequences of their guilt." We have an illustration of this meaning in passages parallel to God's hardening Pharaoh's heart, where it is said: "Pharaoh hardened his heart." 20 But the thought that God leads man astray is original in the Semitic mind. So ingrained is the ancient idea, through millenniums of oppression, that one in power is responsible for a man's failure that it sometimes appears today in a very amusing way. The following incident which illustrates this point came under my notice when I was spending five weeks at the Syrian Protestant College in Beirut. A student failed to pass his examination in French. He therefore wrote a very indignant letter to the French professor, in which he asked the question in Arab- English: "Why did you fail me ?" By this he did not mean, " Why did you declare that my examination was a failure ?" but, "Why did you cause me to fail ?" This was evidently his mean- ing from the tenor of his letter in which he claimed that he had done excellent work in French. The belief that God leads men astray has a very important bearing on their notion of sin. The people, judging from experience, regard God as a jeal- ous being, upon whose help they may rely at any given crisis of their lives, if they make him a satisfactory present. Rev. John Zeller, for more than forty years missionary in Palestine, and who knows much of the working of the native mind, said to me: "The sacrifice of a sheep may have a vicarious character in so far as it is thought to appease a jealous God who is not willing to have anyone too prosperous."=27 It seems as if one of the earliest representations of man's approach to God was through a gift, as that is the proper rendering of minka, the term used to describe the presents which Cain and Abel are represented as bringing to God.28 This is the simplest conception of sacrifice. They bring a present to God as a man would bring a gift to an emir, and would consider it " singularly impertinent to go empty- handed."29 Men, realizing too well their experiences with earthly potentates, and fearing their jealousy, bring their gifts. 26 Exod. 8 : 15, 32. 27 Journal, VIII, Jerusalem, summer of 19oo. 28 Gen. 4 : 3, 4 (Hebrew). 29 Interview with Rev. G. M. Mackie, D.D., Beirut (Journal, X, summer of 19go).</page><page sequence="8">CONCEPTIONS OF GOD AMONG MODERN SEMITES I29 It is this ancient idea which appears in an utterance of David, when he has a parley with Saul: "If it be the Lord that hath stirred thee up against me, let him smell an offering." 30 The account of the confusion of tongues seems almost to suggest the belief of the writer that God was jealous because of an achieve- ment, which might indicate that in time men, if permitted to live together unchecked, might become "too prosperous" and endanger the supremacy of God himself.3~ There are other illustrations of the same conception of God. There are numer- ous examples in the Old Testament which show that the ancient writers have been led in their choice of expressions and manner of representation by beliefs and modes of thought current in their times and which still exist among Syrians and Bedouins today. There seems to be abundant evidence that ignorant people think of God as one of themselves,3! as having a human organism.33 He and St. George, the most powerful of the saints, are con- sidered by some as brothers. The implications of such a view are far-reaching. We have Old Testament examples where the form of the narrative has been borrowed from old Semitic ideas, although the truth taught has not been dominated by them. Such is a class of passages which are not a.dequately explained by affirm- ing that they are anthropomorphic; they are really more than that, for they betray conceptions of God at a stage when his omniscience and omnipresence were not apprehended, 'in any 30 I Sam. 26: 19 (R. V., margin). 31 Gen. II :6. 32 Mr. Henry Harding, of the Church Missionary Society, for twelve years missionary in the East, now of Gaza, made the following statement : "Ordinary people would think of God as like themselves. They would expect God to deal with them as they would deal with one another. The idea of God is very vague. The welys and spirits are much nearer." (Journal, XIII, Brummana, summer of 1901o.) 33Suleiman, the Protestant teacher at Nebk, asked a man, "Who is God ?" Answer: " The existing one." "Has he eyes ?" Answer: "Certainly." " Has he ears ?" " Certainly." "There is an oath in Nebk, if a man is very tall, that he can reach to God's testicles." The women will even say, when vexed: " Get out for the sake of the back parts of our Lord." At the village of Dibbash, in the Nusairian mountains, occupied by the Greek Christians, we are told that the people " think of God as made in the image of man " (Journal, XI, summer of 19go).</page><page sequence="9">130 THE BIBLICAL WORLD such sense as other writers apprehend them. For example, God is represented in one of the oldest Old Testament documents as walking in the garden in the cool of a tropical day, the safest and most agreeable time for man to walk abroad, and so the safest time for God, here conceived of by the writer as needing to avoid the burning sun. He, too, like one of his creatures, needs to call the man who, with his wife, has hidden himself among the trees of the garden, else he might not find him.34 Most antique is the representation of God smelling the sweet savor of Noah's sacrifice, and pleased as much as any man could be with a gift, and promising in his heart, because of this satisfaction, that he will not curse the ground again because of man.35 We know that this is an ancient Semitic conception, inasmuch as we have a grotesque and polytheistic form in the ancient Babylonian tradition.36 But it is also clear from this parallel account that, while the Yahwistic writer is so naive in his descriptions, he has been kept by the divine Spirit from making unworthy representa- tions of God, for these children's pictures of God acting like a man are not unworthy of the child age of the world; indeed, they are wonderfully adapted to the conceptions of that age. When Yahweh goes down to see the city and tower of Babel on a visit of inspection ;37 or when he proposes to make a personal examination of Sodom,38 and permits Abraham to beat him down, as if they were on the same plane, just as is the custom in Syria at the present day; and when he suffers Jacob to wrestle with him all night until the breaking of the morning,39 we are moving in the domain of ancient Semitic conceptions which are found today. Some may be inclined to put the words of Jotham's parable 34 Gen. 3 : 8-o. 35 Gen. 8:21. 36 PARALLEL ACCOUNTS OF NOAH'S SACRIFICE. Babylonian (3 :49, 50). Yahwistic (Gen. 8 : 2 I).

But this position cannot be well estab- lished, for many more illustrations which might be cited show how certain institutions go back to human conceptions of God, as, for example, "the shewbread that was taken from before the Lord, to put hot bread" in its place.40 Such bread, accord- ing to the Priests' Code, was placed on a table, for God had a table, because the old notions of him were so human.4* The sixteenth psalm indicates that there were "drink-offerings of blood" which the heathen god was conceived of as drinking. With reference to these representations of God as a man with a man's appetites, the psalmist quotes him as saying in another place: "Will I eat the flesh of bulls, or drink the blood of goats ?" We may be sure that in the thoughts of God which the ignorant Arab or Fellah entertains today we have men at the same stage as when God began to reveal himself in terms which the childhood of the ancient Semites could understand. 40 I Sam. 21:6. 41 Exod. 25 : 30.</page></plain_text>
