<plain_text><page sequence="1">SACRED HISTORY AND THE BEGINNINGS OF PROSE FICTION* ROBERT ALTER Comparative Literature, Berkeley The Hebrew Bible is generally perceived, with considerable justice, as sacred history, and both terms of that status have often been invoked to argue against the applicability to the Bible of the methods of literary analysis. If the text is sacred, if it was grasped by the audiences for whom it was made as a revelation of God's will, perhaps of His literal words, how can one hope to explain it through categories developed for the understanding of such a fundamentally secular, individual, and aesthetic enterprise as that of later Western literature?-And if the text is history, seriously purporting to render an account of the origins of things and of Israelite national experience as they actually happened, is it not presumptuous to analyze these narratives in the terms we customarily apply to prose fiction, a mode of writing we understand to be the arbitrary invention of the writer, whatever the correspondences it may exhibit with quotidian or even historical reality? In a novel by Flaubert or Tolstoy or Henry James, where we are aware of the conscious fashioning of a fictional artifice, sometimes with abundant documentation from the writer's notebooks and letters, it is altogether appropriate to discuss techniques of characterization, shifts of dialogue, the ordering of larger compositional elements, but are we not coercing the Bible into being "literature" by attempting to transfer such categories to a set of texts that are theologically motivated, historically oriented, and perhaps to some extent collectively composed? At least some of these objections will be undercut by recognizing, as several recent analysts have argued, that history is far more intimately related to fiction than we have been accustomed to assume. It is important to see the common ground shared by the two modes of narrative, ontologically and formally, but it * This essay was first presented as a paper at a conference on biblical literature held at the University of California, San Diego, May 13-14, 1979. It is conceived as a chapter in a general study of the poetics of biblical narrative in which, of course, other aspects of the subject will be considered in analytic detail. All translations from the Bible are by the author. ! Poetics Today, Vol. 1:3 (1980), 143-162</page><page sequence="2">144 ROBERT B. ALTER also strikes me as misguided to insist that writing history is finally identical with writing fiction. The two kinds of literary activity obviously share a whole range of narrative strategies, and the historian may seem to resemble the writer of fiction in employing, as in some ways he must, a series of imaginative constructs. Yet there remains a qualitative difference, for example, between G.M. Trevelyan's portrait of Robert Walpole, which, though an interpretation and so in some degree an imaginative projection, is closely bound to the known historical facts, and Fielding's Jonathan Wild, a character that alludes satirically to Walpole but clearly has its own dynamics as an independent fictional invention. The case of the Bible's sacred history, however, is rather different from that of modern historiography. There is, to begin with, a whole spectrum of relations to history in the sundry biblical narratives, as I shall try to indicate later, but none of these involves the sense of being bound to documentable facts that characterizes history in its modern acceptation. It is often asserted that the biblical writer is bound instead to the fixed materials, whether oral or written, that tradition has transmitted to him. This is a claim difficult to verify or refute because we have no real way of knowing what were the precise contents of Hebrew tradition around the beginning of the first millennium B.C.E. A close inspection, however, of the texts that have been passed down to us may lead to a certain degree of skepticism about this scholarly notion of the tyrannical authority of ancient tradition, may lead us, in fact, to conclude that the writers exercised a good deal of artistic freedom in articulating the traditions at their disposal. As odd as it may sound at first, I would contend that prose fiction is the best general rubric for describing biblical narrative. Or, to be more precise, and to borrow a key term from Herbert Schneidau's speculative, sometimes questionable, often suggestive study, Sacred Discontent, we can speak of the Bible as historicized prose fiction. "What we are witnessing in Genesis, and in parts of the David story," Scheidau observes, "is the birth of a new kind of historicized fiction, moving steadily away from the motives and habits of the world of legend and myth" (1977:215). This generalization can, I think, be extended beyond Genesis and the David story to most of biblical narrative, even where, as in parts of the Book of Kings, an abundance of legendary material is evident. Because the central thesis of Schneidau's book is the rebellion of biblical literature against the pagan world-view, which is locked into an eternal cyclicality, his stress falls on the historicizing, though the fiction deserves equal attention. But before we pursue either of those themes, we should pause over the prose component of prose fiction, which is far more than a matter of convenience in classification for the librarian. It is peculiar, and culturally significant, that among ancient peoples only Israel should have chosen to cast its sacred national traditions in prose. Among many hazily conceived literary terms applied to the Bible, scholars have often spoken of it as the "national epic" of ancient Israel, or, more specifically, they have conjectured about an oral Creation Epic and Exodus Epic upon which the authors of the Pentateuch drew. But, as Israeli Bible scholar Shemaryahu Talmon has shrewdly argued, what by all appearance we have in the Bible is,</page><page sequence="3">HISTORY AND THE BEGINNINGS OF FICTION 145 quite to the contrary, a deliberate avoidance of epic, and the prose form of Hebrew narrative is the chief evidence for this avoidance: The ancient Hebrew writers purposefully nurtured and developed prose narration to take the place of the epic genre which by its content was intimately bound up with the world of paganism, and appears to have had a special standing in the polytheistic cults. the recitation of the epics was tantamount to a reenactment of cosmic events in the manner of sympathetic magic. In the process of total rejection of the polytheistic religions and their ritual expressions in the cult, epic songs and also the epic genre were purged from the repertoire of the Hebrew authors (1978:354). What is crucial for the literary understanding of the Bible is that this reflex away from the polytheistic genre had powerfully constructive consequences in the new medium which the ancient Hebrew writers fashioned for their monotheistic purposes. Prose narration, affording writers a remarkable range and flexibility in the means of presentation, could be utilized to liberate fictional personages from the fixed choreography of timeless events and thus could transform storytelling from ritual rehearsal to the delineation of the wayward paths of human freedom, the quirks and contradictions of men and women seen as moral agents and complex centers of motive and feeling. The underlying impulse of this whole portentous transition in literary modes is effectively caught, though with certain imprecisions I shall try to correct, by Herbert Schneidau in an anthropological generalization that nicely comple- ments Talmon's historical proposal. Schneidau speaks of a "world of linked analogies and correspondences" manifested in the primitive imagination and in the divinitory mode of expression. "A cosmology of hierarchical continuities, as in mythological thought, exhibits strong metaphorical tendencies. The enmeshing and interlocking of structures is coherently expressed in poetic evocation of transferable, substitutable qualities and names. In this world, movement tends to round itself into totalization, impelled by the principle of closure." In contrast to this mythological world dominated by metaphor, Schneidau sees metonymy, with its point-to-point movement suggesting the prosaic modes of narrative and history, as the key to the literature of the Bible, a literature that breaks away from the old cosmic hierarchies. He attempts to summarize this whole contrast in an aphorism: "Where myth is hypotactic metaphors, the Bible is paratactic metonymies" (Schneidau: 1977:292). This general comparison provides an important insight into the innovative nature of the Bible's literary enterprise, but some of the terms invoked are a little misleading. There are, to begin with, a good many ancient Near Eastern narratives which are sophisticated, fundamentally secular literary works, though for Schneidau as for Talmon the mythological poems would appear to be the paradigm of pagan literature from which the Bible swerves. The paradigmatic function of this particular kind of pre-Israelite narrative may well justify the stress on the Hebrew literary rejection of myth, but other terms that Schneidau adopts remain problematic. Roman Jakobson's schematic distinction between metaphor and metonymy fits the case under discussion only in a loose figurative sense because actual metaphor (rather than inferrable metaphysical</page><page sequence="4">146 ROBERT B. ALTER "correspondences") is by no means predominant in the extant ancient Near Eastern mythological epics. Similarly, hypotaxis and parataxis may be logically coordinated with metaphor and metonymy respectively, but in actual syntactic patterns, the Near Eastern mythological verse narratives would appear to be mainly paratactic, while biblical narrative prose exhibits a good deal of variation from parataxis to hypotaxis, according to the aims of the writer and the requirements of the particular narrative juncture. Scheidau's most valuable perception, in any case, is not dependent on these terms, for his main point is the vigorous movement of biblical writing away from the stable closure of the mythological world and toward the indeterminacy, the shifting casual concatenations, the ambiguities of a fiction made to resemble the uncertainties of life in history. And for that movement, I would add, the suppleness of prose as a narrative medium was indispensable. As an initial illustration of how the modalities of prose fiction operate in biblical narrative, I should like to consider a passage from the so-called primeval history, the creation of Eve (Gen. 2). It may serve as a useful test-case because with its account of origins, its generalized human figures, its anthropomorphic deity, and with the Mesopotamian background of the version of creation in which it occurs, it has been variously classified by mnodern commentators as myth, legend, and folklore, and would seem quite unlike what we usually think of as artfully conceived fiction. In the immediately preceding verse, one recalls, God had warned Adam under the penalty of death not to eat from the Tree of Knowledge. Man's response to this injunction is not recorded. Instead, the narrative moves on - perhaps making that hiatus itself a proleptic intimation of the link between Adam's future mate and the seizing of forbidden knowledge- to an expression in direct speech of God's concern for the solitary condition of His creature: 18. The Lord God said, "It is not good for man to be alone. I shall make him an aid fit for him." 19. And the Lord God formed from the earth every beast of the field and every bird of the sky and He brought them to the man to see what he would call them; and whatever the man called a living creature would be its name. 20. The man called names to all the cattle and to the birds of the sky and to every beast of the field, but for the man no fit aid was found. 21. And the Lord God cast a deep slumber upon the man and he slept; and He took one of this ribs and closed up the flesh at that place. 22. And the Lord God fashioned the rib he had taken from the man into a woman and He brought her to the man. 23. The man said: This one at last This one shall be called woman bone of my bones for from man was this one taken. and flesh of my flesh. 24. Thus does a man leave his father and mother and cling to his woman, and they become one flesh. 25. And the two of them were naked, the man and his woman, and they were not ashamed. The usual taxonomic approach to the Bible would explain the whole passage as a piece of ancient folklore, an etiological tale intended to account for the existence of woman, for her subordinate status, and for the attraction she perennially exerts over man. The inset of formal verse (a common convention in</page><page sequence="5">HISTORY AND THE BEGINNINGS OF FICTION 147 biblical narrative for direct speech that has some significantly summarizing or ceremonial function) in fact looks archaic, and could conceivably have been a familiar etiological tag in circulation for centuries before the making of this passage. Folkloric traditions may very well be behind the text, but I don't think that in themselves they provide a very satisfactory sense of the artful complex which the writer has shaped out of his materials. Our first ancestors of course cannot be allowed much individuality and so they are not exactly "fictional characters" in the way that later figures in Genesis like Jacob and Joseph and Tamar will be. Nevertheless, the writer, through a subtle manipulation of language and narrative exposition, manages to endow Adam and Eve with a degree of morally problematic interiority one would hardly expect in a primitive folktale explaining origins. Before we look at some of the details, we might contrast the general impression of this passage with the account of the creation of mankind (there is no separate creation of woman) in the Enuma Elish, the Babylonian creation epic. The god Marduk, after triumphing over the primeval mother Tiamat, announces: Blood I will mass and cause bones to be. I will establish a savage, 'man' shall be his name. Verily, savage-man I will create. He shall be charged with the service of the gods That they might be at ease (Pritchard: 1950, 66). Marduk shares with the God of Israel the anthropomorphic metier of a sculptor in the medium of flesh and bone, but man in the Akkadian verse narrative is merely an object acted upon, his sole reason for existence to supply the material wants of the gods. Humanity is conceived here exclusively in terms of ritual function - man is made in order to offer sacrifices to the gods - and so the highly differentiated realms of history and moral action are not intimated in the account of man's creation. This is a single instance of what Schneidau means by humanity's being locked into a set of fixed hierarchies in the mythological world-view. Man so conceived cannot be the protagonist of prose fiction: the appropriate narrative medium is mythological epic, in which the stately progression of parallelistic verse - in fact, predominantly paratactic and unmetaphorical here - emphatically rehearses man's eternal place in an absolute cosmic scheme. If we now return to Genesis 2, we can clearly see how the monotheistic writer works not only with very different theological assumptions but also with a radically different sense of literary form. In contrast to the hortatory diction of Marduk and his fellow-members of the Babylonian pantheon, God expresses His perception of man's condition and His own intention with a stark directness: "It is not good for man to be alone. I shall make him an aid fit for him." (His utterance, nevertheless, is close enough to a scannable verse of complementary parallelism to give it a hint of formal elevation.) Then there occurs a peculiar interruption. We have been conditioned by the previous version of cosmogony to expect an immediate act of creation to flow from the divine utterance that is introduced by the formula, "And God said." Here, however, we must wait two verses for the promised creation of a</page><page sequence="6">148 ROBERT B. ALTER helpmate while we follow the process of man giving names to all living creatures. These verses (19 and 20) are marked, as a formal seal of their integration in the story, by an envelope structure, being immediately preceded by the thematically crucial phrase, ezer kenegdo (literally, "an aid alongside him") and concluding with that same phrase. A concise comment on these two verses in the classical Midrash nicely reflects their strategic utility: "He made them pass by in pairs. He said, 'Everything has its partner but I have no partner' " (Bereshit Rabba 17:5). What is especially interesting about this miniature dramatization in the Midrash is where it might have come from in the text. For the literary insights of the midrashic exegetes generally derive from their sensitive response to verbal clues - in the recurrence of a key-word, the nuanced choice of a particular lexical item, significant sound-play, and so forth. Here, however, it seems that the Midrash is responding not to any particular word in the passage but to an aspect of the text continuum which today we would call a strategy of narrative exposition. Eve has been promised. She is then withheld for two carefully framed verses while God allows man to perform his unique function as the bestower of names on things. There is implicit irony in this order of narrated events. Man is superior to all other living creatures because only he can invent language, only he has the level of consciousness that makes him capable of linguistic ordering. But this very consciousness makes him aware of his solitude in contrast to the rest of the zoological kingdom. (It is, perhaps, a solitude mitigated but not entirely removed by the creation of woman, for that creation takes place through the infliction of a kind of wound on him, and afterward, in historical time, he will pursue her, strain to become "one flesh" with her, as though to regain a lost part of himself.) The contrast between mateless man calling names to a mute world of mated creatures is brought out by a finesse of syntax not reproducible in translation. Verse 20 actually tells us that man gave names "to all cattle ... to birds ... to beast ... to the man," momentarily seeming to place Adam in an anaphoric prepositional series with all living creatures. This incipient construal is then reversed by the verb "did not find," which sets man in opposite to all that has preceded. One could plausibly argue, then, that the Midrash was not merely indulging in a flight of fancy when it imagined Adam making that confession of loneliness as he named the creatures passing before him. When God at last begins to carry out His promise at the beginning of Verse 21, man, with the intervention of divine anaesthetic, is reduced from a conscious agent to an inert object acted upon, for the moment much like man in the Enuma Elish. The thematic difference, of course, is that this image of man as passive matter is bracketed on both sides by his performances as master of language. As soon as the awakened man discovers woman, he proceeds - as natural births elsewhere in the Bible are regularly followed by the ceremony of naming - to name her, adopting the formal emphasis of a poem. The poem, whether or not it was the writer's original composition, fits beautifully into the thematic argument of his narrative. Written in a double chiastic structure, it refers to the woman just being named by an indicative, zot, "this [feminine] one," which is the first and</page><page sequence="7">HISTORY AND THE BEGINNINGS OF FICTION 149 last word of the poem in the Hebrew as well as the linchpin in the middle. Man names the animals over whom he has domain; he names woman, over whom he ostensibly will have dominion. But in the poem, man and his bone and flesh are syntactically surrounded by this new female presence, a rhetorical configuration that makes perfect sense in the light of their subsequent history together. The explanatory Verse 24, which begins with "thus" ('al ken), a fixed formula for introducing etiological assertions, might well have been part of a proverbial statement adopted verbatim by the writer, but even if this hypothesis is granted, what is remarkable is the artistry with which he weaves the etiological utterance into the texture of his own prose. The splendid image of desire fulfilled and, by extension, of the conjugal state - "they become one flesh" - is both a vivid glimpse of the act itself and a bold hyperbole. The writer, I would suggest, is as aware of the hyperbolic aspect of the image as later Plato will be when in The Symposium he attributes to Aristophanes the notion that lovers are the bifurcated halves of a primal self who are trying to recapture that impossible primal unity. For as soon as the idea of one flesh has been put forth (and "one" is the last word of the verse in the Hebrew), the narration proceeds as follows: "And the two of them were naked, the man and his woman, and they were not ashamed." After being invoked as the timeless model of conjugal oneness, they are immediately seen as two, a condition stressed by the deliberately awkward and uncharacteristic doubling back of the syntax in the appositional phrase, "the man and his woman" - a small illustration of how the flexibility of the prose medium enables the writer to introduce psychological distinctions, dialectical reversals of thematic direction, that would not have been feasibly in the verse narratives of the ancient Near East. So the first man and woman are now two, vulnerable in their twoness to the temptation of the serpent, who will be able to seduce first one, and through the one, the other: naked ('arumim), unashamed, they are about to be exposed to the most cunning ('arum) of the beasts of the field, who will give them cause to feel shame. From this distance in time, it is impossible to determine how much of this whole tale was sanctified, even verbally fixed, tradition; how much was popular lore perhaps available in different versions; how much the original invention of the writer. What a close reading of the text does suggest, however, is that the writer could manipulate his inherited materials with sufficient freedom and sufficient firmness of authorial purpose to define motives, relations, and unfolding themes, even in a primeval history, with the kind of subtle cogency we associate with the conscious artistry of the narrative mode designated prose fiction. Throughout these chapters, Adam and Eve are not the fixed figures of legend or myth but are made to assume contours conceived in the writer's particularizing imagination through the brief but revealing dialogue he invents for them and through the varying strategies of presentation he adopts in reporting their immemorial acts. Let me hasten to say that in giving such weight to fictionality, I do not mean to discount the historical impulse that informs the Hebrew Bible. The God of Israel, as so often has been observed, is above all the God of history: the working</page><page sequence="8">150 ROBERT B. ALTER out of His purposes in history is a process that compels the attention of the Hebrew imagination, which is thus led to the most vital interest in the concrete and differential character of historical events. The point is that fiction was the principal means which the biblical authors had at their disposal for realizing history.' Under scrutiny, biblical narrative generally proves to be either fiction laying claim to a place in the chain of causation and the realm of moral consequentiality that belong to history, as in the primeval history, the tales of the Patriarchs and much of the Exodus story and the account of the early Conquest, or history being given the imaginative definition of fiction, as in most of the narratives from the period of the Judges onward. This schema, of course, is necessarily neater than the persistently untidy reality of the variegated biblical narratives. What the Bible offers us is an uneven continuum and a constant interweaving of factual historical detail (especially, but by no means exclusively, for the later periods) with purely legendary "history"; occasional enigmatic vestiges of mythological lore; etiological stories; archetypal fictions of the founding fathers of the nation; folktales of heroes and wonder-working men of God; verisimilar inventions of wholly fictional personages attached to the progress of national history; and fictionalized versions of known historical figures. All of these narratives are presented as history, that is, as things that really happened and that have some significant consequence for human or Israelite destiny.Theonly evident exceptions to this rule are Job, which in its very stylization seems manifestly a philosophic fable (hence the rabbinic dictum, "There was no such creature as Job; he is a parable") and Jonah, which with its satiric and fantastic exaggerations looks like a parabolic illustration of the prophetic calling and of God's universality. Despite the variegated character of these narratives, composed as they were by many different hands over a period of several centuries, I would like to attempt a rough generalization about the kind of literary project they constitute. The ancient Hebrew writers, as I have already intimated, seek through the process of narrative realization to reveal the enactment of God's purposes in historical events. This enactment, however, is continuously complicated by a perception of two, approximately parallel, dialectical tensions. One is a tension between the divine plan and the disorderly character of actual historical events, or, to translate this opposition into specifically biblical terms, between the divine Promise and its ostensible failure to be fulfilled; the other is a tension between God's will. His providential guidance, and human freedom, the refractory nature of man. If one may presume at all to reduce great achievements to a common denominator, it might be possible to say that the depth with which human nature is imagined in the Bible is a function of its being conceived caught in the powerful ' A recent book by Licht (1978) proposes that the "historical aspect" and the "storytelling" or "aesthetic" aspect of biblical narrative be thought of as entirely discrete functions that can be neatly peeled apart for inspection - one gathers, like the different colored stands of electrical wiring. This facile separation of the inseparable suggests how little most Bible scholars have thought about the role of literary art in biblical literature.</page><page sequence="9">HISTORY AND THE BEGINNINGS OF FICTION 151 interplay of this double dialectic between design and disorder, providence and freedom. The various biblical narratives in fact may be usefully seen as forming a spectrum between the opposing extremes of disorder and design. Toward the disorderly end of things, where the recalcitrant facts of known history have to be encompassed, including specific political movements, military triumphs and reversals, and the like, would be Judges, Samuel, and Kings. In these books, the narrators and on occasion some of the personages struggle quite explicitly to reconcile their knowledge of the divine promise with their awareness of what is actually happening in history. At the other end of the spectrum, near the pole of design, one might place the Book of Esther. This post-exilic story, which presents itself as a piece of political history affecting the main diaspora community, is in fact a kind of fairytale - the lovely damsel, guided by a wise godfather, who is made queen and saves her people - richly embellished with satiric invention; its comic art departs from historical verisimilitude in ways that pre-exilic Hebrew narrative seldom does, and the story demonstrates God's providential power in history with a schematic neatness unlike that of earlier historicized fiction in the Bible. Somewhere toward the middle of this spectrum would be Genesis, where the sketchiness of the known historical materials allows considerable latitude for the elucidation of a divine plan in them, with, however, this sense of design repeatedly counterbalanced by the awareness of man's unruly nature, the perilous and imperious individuality of the various human agents in the divine experiment. Individuality is played against providential design in a rather different fashion in the Book of Ruth. Ruth, Naomi, and Boaz are fictional inventions, probably based on no more than names, if that, preserved in national memory. In the brief span of this narrative, they exhibit in speech and action traits of character that make them memorable individuals as the more schematically conceived Esther and Mordecai are not. But in their plausible individuality they also become exemplary figures, thus earning themselves a place in the national history: Ruth through her steadfastness, Boaz through his kindness and his adherence to the procedures of legitimate succession, make themselves the justified progenitors of the line of David. The Book of Ruth, then, which we might place near Genesis toward the pole of design in our imaginary spectrum, is, because of its realistic psychology and its treatment of actual social institutions, a verisimilar historicized fiction, while the Book of Esther seems more a comic fantasy utilizing pseudo-historical materials. Let me risk a large conjecture, if only because it may help us get a clearer sighting on the phenomenon we are considering. It may be that a sense of some adequate dialectical tension between these antitheses of divine plan and the sundry disorders of human performance in history served as an implicit criterion for deciding which narratives were to be regarded as canonical. It would be an understatement to say we possess only scanty information about the now lost body of uncanonical ancient Hebrew literature, but the few hints which the Bible itself provides would seem to point in two opposite directions. On the one hand, in Kings we are repeatedly told that details skimped in the narrative at hand can</page><page sequence="10">152 ROBERT B. ALTER be discovered by referring to the Chronicles of the Kings of Judea and the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel. Those books, one may assume, were excluded from the authoritative national tradition and hence not preserved because they were court histories, probably partisan in character, and erred on the side of the cataloguing of historical events without an informing vision of God's design working through history. On the other hand, brief and enigmatic allusion with citation is made in Numbers, Joshua, and Samuel to the Book of Yashar and the Book of the Battles of Yahweh. The latter sounds as though it was a list of military triumphs with God as principal actor; the former, to judge by the two fragments quoted (Josh. 10:13; 2 Sam. 1:18), was probably a verse narrative, perhaps a martial epic with miraculous elements. I would venture to guess that both books were felt to be too legendary, too committed to the direct narrative tracing of God's design, without a sufficient counterweight of the mixed stuff of recognizable historical experience. Let us direct our attention now to the Bible's historical narratives proper in order to understand more concretely what is implied by the fictional component in describing them as historicized fiction. The large cycle of stories about David, which is surely one of the most stunningly imaginative achievements of ancient literature, provides an instructive central instance of the intertwining of history and fiction. This narrative, though it may have certain folkloric embellishments (such as David's victory over Goliath) is based on firm historical facts, as modern research has tended to confirm: there really was a David who fought a civil war against the house of Saul, achieved undisputed sovereignty over the twelve tribes, conquered Jerusalem, founded a dynasty, created a small empire, and was succeeded by his son Solomon. Beyond these broad outlines, it is quite possible that many of the narrated details about David, including matters bearing on the complications of his conjugal life and his relations with his children, may have been reported on good authority. Nevertheless, these stories are not, strictly speaking, historiography but rather the imaginative reenactment of history by a gifted writer who organizes his materials along certain thematic biases and according to his own remarkable intuition of the psychology of the characters. He feels entirely free, one should remember, to invent interior monologue for his characters, to ascribe feeling, intention, or motive to them when he chooses, to supply verbatim dialogue (and he is one of literature's masters of dialogue) for occasions when no one but the actors themselves could have had knowledge of exactly what was said. The author of the David stories stands in basically the same relation to Israelite history as Shakespeare stands to English history in his history plays. Shakespeare was obviously not free to have Henry V lose the battle of Agincourt, or to allow someone else to lead the English forces there, but, working from the hints of historical tradition, he could invent a kind of Bildungsroman for the young Prince Hal; surround him with invented characters that would serve as foils, mirrors, obstacles, aids in his development; create a language and a psychology for the king which are the writer's own achievement, making out of the stuff of history a powerful projection of human possibility. That is essentially what the</page><page sequence="11">HISTORY AND THE BEGINNINGS OF FICTION 153 author of the David cycle does for David, Saul, Abner, Joab, Jonathan, Absalom, Michal, Abigail, and a host of other characters. One memorable illustration among many of this transmutation of history into fiction is David's great confrontation with Saul at the cave in the wilderness of Ein Gedi (1 Sam. 24). The manic king, one recalls, while in pursuit of the young David, has gone into a cave to relieve himself, where by chance David and his men have taken refuge. David sneaks up to Saul and cutsoff a corner of his robe. Then he is smitten with compunction for having perpetrated this symbolic mutilation on the anointed king, and he sternly holds his men in check while the unwitting Saul walks off from the cave unharmed. Once the king is at a distance, David follows him out of the cave and, holding the excised corner of the robe, he hails Saul, and shouts out to his erstwhile pursuer one of his most remarkable speeches, in which he expresses fealty and reverence to the Lord's anointed one, disavows any evil intention toward him (with the corner of the robe as evidence of what he could have done and did not), and proclaims his own humble status: "After whom did the king of Israel set out?" he says in verse-like symmetry, "After whom are you chasing? After a dead dog, after a single flea'?" At the end of this relatively lengthy speech, the narrator holds us in suspense for still another moment by choosing to preface Saul's response with a chain of introductory phrases: "And it came to pass when David finished speaking these words that Saul said" - and then what he says has a breathtaking brevity after David's stream of words, and constitutes one of those astonishing reversals that make the rendering of character in these stories so arresting: "'Is it your voice, David, my son?' and Saul raised his voice and wept." The point is not merely that the author has made up dialogue to which he could have had no "documentary" access: Thucydides, after all, does that as a stylized technique of representing the various positions maintained by different historical personages. In the biblical story the invented dialogue is an expression of the author's imaginative grasp of his protagonists as distinctive moral and psychological figures, of their emotion-fraught human intercourse dramatically conceived; and what that entire process of imagination essentially means is the creation of fictional character. As elsewhere in biblical narrative, the revelation of character is effected with striking artistic economy, the specification of external circumstances, setting, and gesture held to a bare minimum, and dialogue made to carry a large part of the freight of meaning. To David's impassioned, elaborate rhetoric of self-justification, Saul responds with a kind of choked cry: "Is it your voice, David, my son?" Perhaps he asks this out of sheer amazement at what he has just heard, or because he is too far off to make out David's face clearly, or because his eyes are blinded with tears, which would be an apt emblem of the condition of moral blindness that has prevented him from seeing David as he really is. In connection with this last possibility, one suspects there is a deliberate if approximate echo of the blind Isaac's words to his son Jacob (after asking, "Who are you my son?" Isaac proclaims, "The voice is the voice of Jacob."). The allusion, which complicates the meaning of the present encounter between an</page><page sequence="12">154 ROBERT B. ALTER older and a younger man in a number of ways, is not one that a historical Saul would have been apt to make on the spot, but which a writer with the privilege of fictional invention could brilliantly contrive for this shadow-haunted king whose own firstborn son will not reign after him. Perhaps it might be objected that the David stories are merely the exception that proves the rule - a sunburst of imaginative literary activity in a series of historical books which are, after all, chronicles of known events variously embroidered with folklore and underscored for theological emphasis. Let us consider, then, a passage from that long catalogue of military uprisings, the Book of Judges, where no serious claims could be made for complexity of characterization or for subtlety of thematic development, and see if we can still observe the modalities of prose fiction in what is told and how it is told. I should like to take the story of the assassination of Eglon King of Moab by Ehud the son of Gera (Jud. 3). In the absence of convincing evidence to the contrary, let us assume the historical truth of the story, which seems plausible enough: that a tough, clever guerilla leader named Ehud from the tribe of Benjamin known for its martial skills cut down Eglon more or less in the manner described, then mustered Israelite forces in the hill country of Ephraim for a successful rebellion, which was followed by a long period of relief from Moabite domination. Only the formulaic number of twice forty at the end ("And the land was quiet eighty years") would patently appear not to correspond to historical fact. Where, then, in this succinct political chronicle, is there room to talk about prose fiction? Here is how the main part of the story reads: 15. The Israelites cried out to the Lord, and he raised up a champion for them, Ehud the son of Gera the Benjaminite, a left-handed man. Now the Israelites sent tribute through him to Eglon King of Moab. 16. Ehud made himself a double-edged dagger a gomed long and strapped it under his garments on his right thigh. 17. He brought the tribute to Eglon King of Moab - and this Eglon was a very stout man. 18. And it came about that after he had finished presenting the tribute, he dismissed the people who had carried it. 19. And he had come from Pesilim near Gilgal. Then he said. "A secret word I have for you, King." "Silence!" he replied, and all his attendants went out. 20. Ehud came to him as he was sitting in his cool upper chamber all alone, and Ehud said, "A word of God I have for you," and he rose from his seat. 2 1. And Ehud reached with his left hand and took the dagger from his right thigh and thrust it into Eglon's belly. 22. The hilt went in after the blade and the fat closed over the blade, for he did not withdraw the dagger from the belly and the filth burst out.2 23. Ehud came out through the vestibule, closing the doors of the upper chamber on him and locking them. 24. He had just gone out when the courtiers came and saw that the doors were locked. "He is just relieving himself in the cool chamber," they said. 25. They waited a long time, and still he did not open the doors of the chamber. So they took the key and opened them, and, look, their lord was sprawled on the floor, dead. It will be observed at once that the detailed attention given here to the implement and technique of killing, which would be normal in the Iliad, is rather uncharacteristic of the Hebrew Bible. One may assume that Ehud's bold resourcefulness in carrying out this assassination, which threw the Moabites into 2 There is a textual ambiguity here in the Hebrew.</page><page sequence="13">HISTORY AND THE BEGINNINGS OF FICTION 155 disarray and enabled the insurrection to succeed, was remarkable enough for the chronicler to want to report it circumstantially. Each of the details, then, contributes to a clear understanding of just how the thing was done -clearer, of course, for the ancient audience than for us because we no longer have a coherent picture of the floor plan of the sort of Canaanite summer residence favored by Moabite kings and so we may have a little difficulty in reconstructing Ehud's entrances and exits. The left-handed Benjaminite warriors were known for their prowess, but Ehud also counts on his left-handedness as part of his strategy of surprise: a sudden movement of the left hand will not instantaneously be construed by the king as a movement of a weapon hand. Ehud also counts on the likelihood that Eglon will be inclined to trust him as a vassal bringing tribute and that the "secret" he promises to confide to the king will thus be understood as a piece of intelligence volunteered by an Israelite collaborator. The dagger or short sword (herev) is of course strapped to Ehud's right thigh for easy drawing with the left hand; it is short enough to hide under his clothing, long enough to do Eglon's business without the killer's having to be unduly close to his victim, and double-edged to assure the lethalness of one quick thrust. Eglon's encumbrance of fat will make him an easier target as he awkwardly rises from his seat, and perhaps Ehud leaves the weapon buried in the flesh in order not to splatter blood on himself, so that he can walk out through the vestibule unsuspected and make his escape. One commentator has ingeniously proposed that even the sordid detail of the release of the anal sphincter in the death spasm has its role in the exposition of the mechanics of the assassination: the courtiers outside, detecting the odor, assume that Eglon has locked the door because he is performing a bodily function, and so they wait long enough to enable Ehud to get away safely (Kaufman: 1968, 109). Yet if all this is the scrupulous report of a historical act of political terrorism, the writer has vividly thematized his historical material through a skillful manipulation of the prose narrative medium. What emerges is not simply a circumstantial account of the Moabite king's destruction but a satiric vision of it, at once shrewd and jubilant. The writer's imagination of the event is informed by an implicit etymologizing of Eglon's name, which suggests the hebrew 'egel, calf. The ruler of the occupying Moabite power turns out to be a fatted calf readied for slaughter - and perhaps even the epithet "stout," bari, is a play on meri, "fatling," a sacrificial animal occasionally bracketed with calf. Eglon's fat is both the token of his physical ponderousness, his vulnerability to Ehud's sudden blade, and the emblem of his regal stupidity. Perhaps it may also hint at a kind of grotesque feminization of the Moabite leader: Ehud "comes to" the king, an idiom also used for sexual entry, and there is something hideously sexual about the description of the dagger-thrust. There may also be a deliberate sexual nuance in the "secret thing" Ehud brings to Eglon in the way the two are locked together alone in a chamber, and in the sudden opening of locked entries at the conclusion of the story.3 The possible significance of locking and unlocking in the story was brought to my attention by George Savrin.</page><page sequence="14">156 ROBERT B. ALTER Ehud's claim to have a secret message for the king is accepted immediately and without qualification by Eglon's confidential "Silence!" (or perhaps one might translate the onomatopoeic term as sssh!), the Moabite either failing to notice that Ehud has brusquely addressed him as "King" without the polite "My lord" (adoni) or constructing this omission simply as evidence of Ehud's urgency. When the two are alone and Ehud again turns to Eglon, he drops even the bare title, flatly stating, "A word of God I have for you." This statement is a rather obvious but nevertheless effective piece of dramatic irony: the secret thing - the Hebrew term can mean word, message, thing--hidden beneath Ehud's garment is in fact the word of God that the divinely "raised" Benjaminite champion is about to bring home implacably to the corpulent king. Hearing that the promised political secret is actually an oracle, Eglon rises, perhaps in sheer eagerness to know the revelation, perhaps as an act of accepted decorum for receiving an oracular communication, and now Ehud can cut him down. The courtiers' erroneous assumption that their bulky monarch is taking his leisurely time over the chamber pot is a touch of scatological humor at the expense of both king and followers, while it implicates them in the satiric portrayal of his credulity. This last effect is heightened by the presentation of their direct speech at the end of Verse 24, and the switch of the narrative to their point of view in Verses 23 and 24. Let me retranslate these clauses literally to reproduce the immediate effect of seeing the scene through their eyes that one experiences in the Hebrew: "The courtiers came and saw, look, the doors of the upper chamber are locked ... They waited a long time and, look, he's not opening the doors of the upper chamber, and they took the keys and opened them, and, look, their lord is sprawled on the floor, dead." The syntax of the concluding clause nicely follows the rapid stages of their perception as at last they are disabused of their illusion: first they see their king prostrate, and the they realize, climactically, that he is dead. An enemy's obtuseness is always an inviting target for satire in time of war, but here the exposure of Moabite stupidity has a double thematic function: to show the blundering helplessness of the pagan oppressor when faced with a liberator raised up by the all-knowing God of Israel, and to demonstrate how these gullible Moabites, deprived of a leader, are bound to be inept in the war that immediately ensues. In fact, great numbers of the Moabites are slaughtered at the fords of the Jordan, the location of the debacle, perhaps suggesting that they allowed themselves to be drawn into an actual ambush, or at any rate, that they foolishly rushed into places where the entrenched Israelites could hold them at a terrific strategic disadvantage. Ehud's assassination of Eglon, then, is not only connected causally with the subsequent Moabite defeat but it is also a kind of emblematic prefiguration of it. The link between the regicide and the war of liberation is reinforced by two punning verbal clues. Ehud thrusts (tq') the dagger into Eglon's belly, and as soon as he makes good his escape (Verse 27), he blasts - the same verb, tq' - the ram's horn to rally his troops.4 The Israelites kill The pun has been observed by Luis Alonso-Schikel, who also comments on the play of 'egel in Eglon's name (1961).</page><page sequence="15">HISTORY AND THE BEGINNINGS OF FICTION 157 10,000 Moabites, "everyone a lusty man and a brave man" (Verse 29), but the word for "lusty," shamen, also means "fat," so the Moabites are "laid low [or subjugated] under the hand of Israel" (Verse 30) in a neat parallel to the fate of their fat master under the swift left hand of Ehud. In all this, as I have said, it is quite possible that the writer faithfully represents the historical data without addition or substantive embellishment. The organization of the narrative, however, its lexical and syntactic choices, its small shifts in point of view, its brief but strategic uses of dialogue, produce an imaginative reenactment of the historical event, conferring upon it a strong attitudinal definition and discovering in it a pattern of meaning. It is perhaps less historized fiction than fictionalized history - history in which the feeling and the meaning of events are concretely realized through the technical resources of prose fiction. To round out this overview of the spectrum of fictional modalities in the Bible's sacred history, I should like to return to Genesis for a concluding illustration - this time, from the patriarchal narratives, which unlike the stories of the first ancestors of mankind, are firmly linked to Israelite national history. The linkage, to be sure, would appear to be more the writer's attribution than the result of any dependable historical traditions. Many modern scholars have assumed that the Patriarchs are the invented figures of early Hebrew folklore elaborated on by later writers, particularly in order to explain political arrangements among the twelve tribes' generations after the Conquest. But even if one follows the inclination of some contemporary commentators to see a historical kernel in many of these tales, it is obvious that, in contrast to our examples from Judges and the David story, the authors, writing centuries after the supposed events, had scant historical data to work with. To what degree they believed the various traditions they inherited were actually historical is by no means clear, but if caution may deter us from applying a term like "invention" to their activity, it still seems likely that they exercised a good deal of shaping power over their materials as they articulated them. The point I should like to stress is that the immemorial inventions, fabrications, or projections of folk tradition are not in themselves fiction, which depends on the particularizing imagination of the individual writer. The authors of the Patriarchal narratives exhibit just such an imagination, transforming archetypal plots into the dramatic interaction of complex, probingly rendered characters. These stories are "historicized" both because they are presented as having a minute causal relation to known historical circumstances and because (as Schneidau argues) they have some of the irregular, "metonymic" quality of real historical concatenation; they are fiction because the national archetypes have been made to assume the distinctive lineaments of individual human lives. Biblical narrative in fact offers a particularly instructive instance of the birth of fiction because it often exhibits the most arresting transitions from generalized statement, genealogical lists, mere summaries of characters and acts, to defined scene and concrete interaction between personages. Through the sudden specification of narrative detail and the invention of dialogue that individualizes</page><page sequence="16">158 ROBERT B. ALTER the characters and focuses their relations, the biblical writers give the events they report a fictional time and place. Let us consider a single succinct example, Esau's selling of the birthright to Jacob (Gen. 25): 27. As the lads grew up, Esau became a skilled hunter, a man of the field, and Jacob was a mild man, who kept to his tents. 28. Isaac loved Esau because he had a taste for game, but Rebekah loved Jacob. 29. Once when Jacob was cooking a stew, Esau came in from the field, famished. 30. Esau said to Jacob, "O, give me a swallow of this red stuff for I am famished."- Thus is his name called Edom. 31. Jacob said, "First sell your birthright to me." 32. And Esau said, "Look, I am at the point of death, so what good to me is a birthright?" 33. And Jacob said, "Swear to me first," and he swore to him and sold his birthright to Jacob. 34. Then Jacob gave Esau bread and lentil stew, and he ate and he drank and he rose and he went off and Esau spurned the birthright. Now Esau or Edom and Jacob or Israel are the eponymous founders of two neighboring and rival peoples, as the text has just forcefully reminded us in the oracle preceding their birth ("Two nations are in your womb./ Two peoples apart while still in your belly./ One people will outdo the other,/ The older will serve the younger.") The story of the two rival brothers virtually asks us to read it as a political allegory, to construe each of the twins as an embodiment of his descendants' national characteristics, and to understand the course of their struggle as an outline of their future national destinies. The ruddy Esau, hungry for the red stew, is the progenitor of Edom, by folk etymology associated with adom, red, so that the people is given a kind of national emblem linked here with animality and gross appetite. This negative characterization is probably sharpened, as E.A. Speiser has proposed, by a borrowing from Near Eastern literary tradition: the red Esau, born with "a mantle of hair all over," would appear to allude to Enkidu of the Akkadian Gilgamesh Epic, whose birth is described in just this manner, and who is also an uncouth man of the field (Speiser, 1964:196). What happens, however, when the story is read entirely as a collision of national archetypes, is strikingly illustrated by the commentaries of the early rabbis who - tending to interpret Edom as the typological forerunner of Rome - are relentless in making Esau out to be a vicious brute, while Jacob the tent-dweller becomes the model of pious Israel pondering the intricacies of God's revelation in the study of the Law. The anachronism of such readings concerns us less than the way they project onto the text, from their national-historical viewpoint, a neat moral polarity between the brothers. The text itself, conceiving its personages in the fullness of a mature fictional imagination, presents matters rather differently, as even this brief passage from the larger Jacob-Esau story will suggest. The episode begins with a schematic enough contrast between Esau the hunter and the sedentary Jacob. This apparently neat opposition, however, contains a lurking possibility of irony in the odd epithet tam attached to Jacob. Most translators have rendered it, as I have, by following the immediate context, and so have proposed something like "mild," "plain," or even "retiring" as an</page><page sequence="17">HISTORY AND THE BEGINNINGS OF FICTION 159 English equivalent. Perhaps this was in fact one recognized meaning of the term, but it should be noted that all the other biblical occurrences of the word - and it is frequent lv used, both in adjectival and nominative forms - refer to innocence or moral integrity. A little earlier in Genesis (20:5, 6) Abraham professed the "innocence of his heart" (tom-levav); in contrast to this collocation, Jeremiah, using the same verbal root that Esau sees in Jacob's name as an etymological signature of his treachery, will announce (17:9) that the "heart is treacherous" ('aqov ha-lev), a usage which opens the possibility that we are dealing here with recognized antonyms, both of them commonly bound in idiomatic compounds to the word for heart. Jacob, Ya'aqov whose name will soon be interpreted as the one who deceives, is about to carry out an act if not of deception at least of shrewd calculation, and the choice of an epithet suggesting innocence as an introduction to the episode is bound to give us pause, to make us puzzle over the moral nature of Jacob - an enigma we shall still be trying to fathom twenty chapters later when he is an old man worn by experience at last reunited with his lost son Joseph and received in the court of Pharaoh. The next verse (28) provides an almost diagrammatic illustration of the Bible's artful procedure of variously stipulating or suppressing motive in order to elicit moral inferences and suggest certain ambiguities.s Isaac's preference for Esau is given a causal explanation so specific that it verges on satire: he loves the older twin because of his own fondness for game. Rebekah's love for Jacob is contrastively stated without explanation. Presumably, this would sug- gest that her affection is not dependent on a merely material convenience that the son might provide her, that it is a more justly grounded preference. Rebekah's maternal solicitude, however, is not without its troubling side, for we shall soon see a passive and rather timid Jacob briskly maneuvered about by his mother so that he will receive Isaac's blessing. This brief statement, then, of parental preferences is both an interesting characterization of husband and wife and an effectively reticent piece of exposition in the story of the two brothers. The twins then spring to life as fictional characters when the narration moves into dialogue (Verses 30-33). Biblical Hebrew, as far as we can tell, does not incorporate in direct speech different levels of diction, deviations from standard grammar, regional or class dialects; but the writers, even in putting "normative" Hebrew in the mouths of their personages, find ways of differentiating spoken language according to character. Esau asks for the stew with a verb used for the feeding of animals - one might suggest the force of the locution in English by rendering it as "let me cram my maw" - and, all inarticulate appetite, he cannot even think of the word stew but only points to it pantingly as "this red red stuff." His explanation, however, "for I am famished," is factually precise, as it echoes verbatim what the narrator has just told us. In the first instance, that is, Esau does not choose an exaggeration, like that of Verse 32, but states his actual condition: a creature ofappetite,he is caught by the pangs of a terrible appetite. Esau speaks I have discussed this phenomenon in detail (Alter, 1978).</page><page sequence="18">160 ROBERT B. ALTER over the rumble of a growling stomach with the whiff of the cooking stew in his nostrils. Jacob speaks with a clear perception of legal forms and future consequences, addressing his brother twice in the imperative - "First sell ... swear to me first" - without the deferential particle of entreaty, na, that Esau used in his own initial words to his twin. When Jacob asks Esau to sell the birthright, he withholds the crucial "to me" till the end of his proposal with cautious rhetorical calculation. Fortunately for him, Esau is too absorbed in his own immediate anguish - "I am at the point of death" -to pay much attention to Jacob's self-interest. After the transaction is completed, as we move back from dialogue to uninterrupted narration, Esau's precipitous character is mirrored stylistically in the rapid chain of verbs - "and he ate and he drank and he rose and he went off" - that indicates the uncouth dispatch with which he "spurned," or held in contempt, his birthright. What is one to make of this vivid fictional realization of the scene in regard to its evident national-historical signification? The two are not really at cross-purposes, but certain complications of meaning are introduced in the process of fictional representation. Esau, the episode makes clear, is not spiritually fit to be the vehicle of divine election, the bearer of the birthright of Abraham's seed. He is altogether too much the slave of the moment and of the body's tyranny to become the progenitor of the people promised by divine covenant that it will have a vast historical destiny to fulfill. His selling of the birthright in the circumstances here described is in itself proof that he is not worthy to retain the birthright. As the author, however, concretely imagines Jacob, what emerges from the scene is more than simple Israelite (and anti-Edomite) apologetics. Jacob is a man who thinks about the future, indeed, who often seems worried about the future, and we shall repeatedly see him making prudent stipulations in legal or quasi-legal terms, with God, with Laban, with the divine messenger, about future circumstances. This qualifies him as a suitable bearer of the birthright: historical destiny does not just happen; you have to know how to make it happen, how to keep your eye on the distant horizon of present events. But this quality of wary calculation does not necessarily make Jacob more appealing as a character, and, indeed, may even raise some moral questions about him. The contrast in our scene between the impetuous, miserably famished Esau and the shrewdly businesslike Jacob may not be entirely to Jacob's advantage, and the episode is surely a little troubling as an instance of the quality of "innocence" which the narrator has just fastened as an epithet to the younger twin. His subsequent stealing of his blind father's blessing by pretending to be Esau (Chapter 27) sets him in a still more ambiguous light; and this judgment that Jacob has done wrong in taking what is in a sense his is later confirmed in the narrative, as Umberto Cassuto and other commentators have noted: Jacob becomes the victim of symmetrical poetic justice, deceived in the blindness of the night by having Leah passed off on him as Rachel, and rebuked in the morning by the deceiver, his father-in-law Laban - "It is not done thus in our region to give the younger daughter before the firstborn" (29:26).</page><page sequence="19">HISTORY AND THE BEGINNINGS OF FICTION 161 If one insists on seeing the Patriarchal narratives strictly as paradigms for later Israelite history, one would have to conclude that the authors and redactor of the Jacob story were political subversives raising oblique but damaging questions about the national enterprise. Actually, there may be some theological warrant for this introduction of ambiguities into the story of Israel's eponymous hero, for in the perspective of ethical monotheism, covenantal privileges by no means automatically confer moral perfection. and that monitory idea is perhaps something the writers wanted to bring to the attention of their audiences. I do not think, though, that every nuance of characterization and every turning of the plot in these stories can be justified in either moral-theological or national-historical terms. Perhaps this is the ultimate difference between any hermeneutic approach to the Bible and the literary approach that I am proposing: in the hermeneutic perspective, the text exhibits a kind of absolute functionalism, all its detectible features serving some purpose in a semantics of the holy; in the literary perspective, there is latitude for the exercise of pleasurable invention for its own sake, ranging from "microscopic" details like sound-play to macroscopic features like the psychology of individual characters. This need not imply a blurring of necessary distinctions between sacred and secular literature. The biblical authors are of course constantly, urgently conscious of telling a story in order to reveal the imperative truth of God's works in history and of Israel's hopes and failings. Close attention to the literary strategies through which that truth was expressed may actually help us to understand it better, enable us to see the minute elements of complicating design in the Bible's sacred history. But it also seems to me important to emphasize that the operation of the literary imagination develops a momentum of its own, even for a tradition of writers as theologically intent as these. Genesis is not Pale Fire. but all fiction, including the Bible, is in some sense a form of play. Play in the sense I have in mind enlarges rather than limits the range of meanings of the text. For the classics of fiction, ancient and modern, embody in a vast variety of modes the most serious playfulness, endlessly discovering how the permutations of narrative conventions, linguistic properties, and imaginatively constructed personages and circumstances can crystalize subtle and abiding truths of experience in amusing or arresting or gratifying ways. The Bible presents a kind of literature in which the primary impulse would often seem to be to provide instruction or at least necessary information, not merely to delight. If, however, we fail to see that the creators of biblical narrative were writers who, like writers elsewhere, took pleasure in exploring the formal and imaginative resources of their fictional medium, perhaps sometimes unexpectedly capturing the fullness of their subject in the very play of exploration, we shall miss much that the biblical stories are meant to convev.</page><page sequence="20">162 ROBERT B.
