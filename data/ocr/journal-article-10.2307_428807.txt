<plain_text><page sequence="1">RICHARD COURTNEY On Langer s Dramatic Illusion SUSANNE LANGER'S major statements on dramatic activity are to be found in three chapters of Feeling and Form.l Other relevant statements are to be found else- where in this text, as well as some sections of Philosophy in a New Key,2 Problems of Art3 and Mind: An Essay on Human Feeling, volume 1.4 This material, how- ever, is not to be separated from her aes- thetic as a whole within which the drama is merely one element. I There is little doubt that Langer has achieved her aim of commencing with a basic theory which can expand its import over the whole aesthetic field; the scope of her philosophic work testifies to that fecundity. However, the key principle within her aesthetic has caused some con- troversy. There is a general tendency to regard her central concept as merely a presen- tational symbol. Thus Donald Sherburne says that music "becomes the pattern of a subject-feeling provided by the listener." 5 But, as Hansen indicates,6 Langer has long since retracted the simple term symbol used in Philosophy in a New Key where she wrote "the picture is essentially a symbol, not a duplicate, of what it repre- RICHARD COURTNEY is associate professor in the theatre department of the Faculty of Fine Arts, University of Victoria, British Columbia. He has published several books and a number of articles in learned journals, mainly in the United King- dom. sents." 7 With Feeling and Form the terms describing the art object have changed: artistic creation is of "forms of human feeling" which have an impression of being "other" than reality, "of being a sheer image." The art work is not a real object but an image which is created for the first time, and this has nothing to do with imitation which is "neither the aim nor the measure of artistic creation." Al- though she can still say that the image is an abstraction, or symbol, or the bearer of an idea, it is not a simple representa- tional symbol: "An image is, indeed, a purely virtual 'object'... [whose] visible character is its entire being"; and the function of the art object is disengagement from belief in the sense that "the knowl- edge that what is before us has no prac- tical significance in the world is what en- ables us to give attention to its appear- ance as such." Thus all art is abstract and its content is only a semblance; art does not express actual feeling, but ideas of feeling, "as language does not express ac- tual things and events but ideas of them." In other words: "The basic concept is the articulate but non-discursive form having import without conventional reference, and therefore presenting itself not as a symbol in the ordinary sense, but as 'sig- nificant form', in which the factor of the significance is not logically discriminated, but is felt as a quality rather than recog- nised as a function." 8 The artist's task, within such a theory, is to articulate form in such a way that it coincides with the forms of feeiing; he is</page><page sequence="2">12 concerned with "the making of the 'sem- blance', and the articulation of vital form within its scaffold." He achieves this through artistic conventions; these, for Langer, are devices which create the forms that express feelings and, as everything that belongs to an art work is expressive, "all artifice is functional." 9 The percipient relates to the art work, not the artist. He does so by finding its significance and he is likely to consider that this is "the feeling in it." This feeling "is not 'communicated', but revealed; the created form 'has' it." In such a manner Langer can go on to say that the aesthetic emotion "is not expressed in the work, but belongs to the percipient" and, because the purpose of the work of art is to ab- stract and present forms of life and feeling for the percipient, because "it gives us forms of imagination and forms of feel- ing," it can "clarify and organise intui- tion itself." Thus art does not merely re- veal our inner life to us, but it shapes our imagination of external reality.10 By the time she reached Problems of Art, therefore, Langer recognized that the term symbol was inaccurate for her pur- poses and she redefined it as "expressive form." A genuine symbol is a sign, like a word, beneath which we try to grasp a meaning. But a work of art does not dis- guise a hidden meaning for Langer; it does not signify. Thus she would agree with Jung and disagree with Freud. To her, it is like a myth or a true metaphor: it only presents its emotive content and does not exist apart from its imaginative expres- sion.l" In Mind, however, she introduced the term projection in the sense that "the only adequate symbolic projection of our insights into feeling...is artistic ex- pression." 12 This has met with objections from empiricists. For Louis Arnaud Reid there is obscurity in the notion of the symbolic projection of feeling because all feelings are feelings-of (even moods, which are feelings-of states of body or mind). For the empirical viewpoint "the universal is not an abstract universal, but a new individual concrete universal" and "it is strained to say I contemplate feeling. I RICH A R D CO U RTNEY contemplate the works themselves; I get (mediately, in a complex way) the feeling of them through attending to them wholly. It is their aesthetic meaning, as known through feeling, rather than a structure or form of feeling which I apprehend." 13 II Langer's central concept, as outlined, is so fecund that it can be generalized to cover the various art forms. Visual art is "virtual space" in the sense that the work of art creates an illusion of space and "without the organising shapes it is simply not there"; its semblance is its "look" and the emotional import of its form. Thus she can distinguish between pictorial art ("vir- tual scene"), sculpture (volume in the semblance of organism), and architecture, which is ethnic-"a total environment made visible." Music has the semblance of "virtual time," making time audible and its form and continuity sensible; it has the illusion of flowing time in its passage, although the image of musical time has a different structure from real time; life itself is rhythmic, and the rhythmic con- tinuity of music gives permanence to a pattern of changes. Poetry is "virtual life" (life that is more fully perceived, simplified, and evaluated than actual life) in which the virtual world of the poem is peculiar to the work-it makes life ap- pear in certain ways for the emotional import of the "facts" is part of their ap- pearance. Although literature as a whole is "virtual life," the novel is "virtual memory": it has the semblance of memory, or the illusion of life in a virtual past; it is the configuration, or gestalt, of an experience.l4 The two areas that directly concern us in this paper are dance and drama. Dance is "virtual powers": the creation of imagi- nary beings from whom vital force emanates and who shape a world of powers by their actions. Gesture is the primary illusion of the dance because, although to the performer it is an action, to the audience it is a vital movement-actual gesture "becomes transformed into virtual</page><page sequence="3">On Langer's Dramatic Illusion spontaneous movement, or virtual ges- ture"-performed by the created dance personality (a superhuman being) which is expressing itself.'5 Moreover, dance is clearly differentiated from drama. Drama, for Langer, is a poetic art be- cause, like all poetry, it is "virtual life." Whereas literature as a whole is "virtual memory," drama is the mode of Destiny. This dramatic future is pure semblance, yet it creates the necessary structure, "form in suspense"; or, in Charles Mor- gan's words, "while the drama moves a form is being fulfilled" and "until the end its form is latent in it." Of the two dramatic rhythms, the comic presents a pure sense of life (as natural activity) where Destiny is under the guise of For- tune; the tragic rhythm presents a per- sonal sense of life (life to death in a cadential form) where Destiny is Fate.l6 Having briefly examined Langer's aes- thetic as a whole and the place of drama within it, we can now turn to her dra- matic theory in some detail. III The major problem in Langer's theory is the relationship of drama, literature, and theater-as it is with most aestheti- cians of this century. In discussing San- skrit theorists who, she says, regard drama as literature, she notes that their drama remained vital for years after the original language in which it was written had died, and this shows that "the stage ac- tion was no mere accompaniment." 17 This is the furthest she can go in considering "the dramatic illusion" in theatrical terms. Despite the fact that she consciously dis- tinguishes "the literary" from "the dra- matic," she does not distinguish between the art forms of drama and theater, and at all stages the tone of her terminology is literary: typically, she says that drama is "a poetic art," "a special poetic mode," "essentially an enacted poem," 18 "a form of poetry, and action is the organising principle of the dramatic projection." 19 This is because her basic theory, fecund though it is, enables her to see the drama 13 only within the framework of the theory itself. From the standpoint of "expres- sive form," it is logical to consider poetry and drama as variant forms of "virtual life" and, thus, mere varieties of one ab- straction. Examining her work to discover specific usages of the terms drama and theater, it is frustrating to discover that she does not, as she does with music, for example, con- sider the problems of definition between "composition" and "performance" and between "the work performed" and "the work read." She considers that the essence of musical composition is to create the semblance of organic movement20 and this is achieved through rhythm which provides an insight into the "life of feeling" be- cause life itself is rhythmical. What is created is the passage of time made audible by sound. She distinguishes between read- ing and listening to music. Listening to performed music is in some degree passive and also selective, filtering out what is irrelevant; though we hear absolute pitch, duration, timbre, volume, and pitch, what we miss by inattentive hearing is the logi- cal connectedness of the tonal sequence. When we read music, the reverse is the case. The composer's work is incomplete and is completed by the performance; his imagination is conceptual and based on inward hearing; the performer's imagi- nation is sonorous and aims towards "com- munication of the 'Idea', articulated ut- terance." 21 The good musical performer concentrates upon content (the signifi- cance of the piece), but if he indulges in emotional catharsis, "the work will lack intensity because its expressive forms are inarticulate and blurred." 22 Should we ex- tend this to the drama (which, it is only fair to say, Langer does not do completely) then, in her own terms, the dramatist's art is the semblance of an imminent future and organic Destiny, achieved through action-the illusion of physical or mental activity. What is created is an image of human life through the visible responses of human beings.23 The spectator would be, in some degree, both passive and selec- tive, though Langer gives no indication of</page><page sequence="4">14 precisely which elements would be fil- tered out. When reading a play (by anal- ogy with music), the reader would be ac- tive and all-inclusive. If the performance completes the dramatist's unfinished work (which is based upon conceptual imagina- tion), and the actor's "active" imagina- tion aims towards communication of the dramatic Idea, then the good actor will concentrate upon the content of the play and not indulge in emotional catharsis. Her view of the artistic spectator as passive is clearly demonstrated in theatri- cal terms by her account of the events when she saw Maude Adams in Peter Pan. When Peter turned to the audience and asked them to attest to their belief in fairies, "the illusion was gone." What il- lusion? She provides two answers, one from theory and one from practice. The first is Edward Bullough's "psychical Dis- tance," where he cites drama as an art form that requires personal distance rather than practical, concrete appeal-what Langer calls "a certain detachment."24 The second is from Rosamund Gilder's comments on Orson Welles's staging of Native Son, where she described the scene in which Bigger Thomas was cornered by his pursuers: "Here flashing lights, gun- play, shouting and shooting converge on the stage from balcony and boxes. The theatrical illusion, far from being in- creased, is shattered, and the scene be- comes nothing more than a nineteen- forty-one version of Eliza crossing the ice."26 The illusion of which Langer speaks, therefore, is not the common il- lusion that the world of the stage is real life. This she expressly denies: "To seek delusion, belief, and 'audience participa- tion' in the theater is to deny that drama is art." Rather she means that the true dramatic illusion is that the world on the stage is a whole artificiality, con- sciously separate in our minds from ac- tuality; a member of the audience, she indicates, should have a detachment or "objectivity" and should contemplate the dramatic illusion in an "aesthetic atti- tude." 26 Now this may fit her specific aesthetic RICHARD COURTNEY theory but, for the theatergoer, it just will not do. As a member of the audience at a great performance of a great play I both believe and dis-believe-and this applies whether I am watching Olivier's Othello, Frederick Valk's John Gabriel Borkman, or the Noh, Kabuki, or Kathakali. At cer- tain moments I may have more belief than dis-belief, or vice versa, but in gen- eral it is untrue to say that I remain detached, objective, or at a "psychical Distance." Nor is it fair to claim that my attitude is specifically Western while Orien- tal audiences are "detached" in compari- son: this is similar to W. B. Yeats's mis- understanding of the Pound and Fenollosa material.27 There is a quality of delusion at such times, but it is not complete delusion. Rather, there is a balance be- tween belief and dis-belief. The spectator is in a state of "psychical Dichotomy" rather than "psychical Distance." So, too, by linking audience participation and belief Langer is confusing two different types of words. Audience participation is merely a technique which can be used well or badly, within an artistic whole, or tacked on to an artistic form where it does not sit with comfort. There is little doubt that Peter Pan is an instance of the latter: the theatrical world created by Barrie has no artistic need of an appeal to the audience for a belief in fairies; it is quite foreign to the form he is using. But the fact that the dramatic art form can exist in a theatrical world where audi- ence participation is conceived as part of that form is instanced by the plays of Brian Way.28 In many of these, the belief and dis-belief of the audience are delib- erately mingled, and audience participa- tion is a conscious technique. In On Trial, when members of the audience climb across the rope bridge (that they have to imagine), there are, as in any theatrical moment, elements of both belief and dis-belief, but balanced in a specific way; the audience are acting as though they believe what they are doing and yet, at the same time, they acknowledge that they are part of the theatrical world and not in actual life. Of course, it is only fair to say that such</page><page sequence="5">On Langer's Dramatic Illusion plays as On Trial are part of "process theater" which Langer does not appear to acknowledge at all within her works. At the same time, her reminder of the neces- sity of theatrical objectivity is salutory when lesser dramatic pieces attempt "a slice of life," or attempt delusion for propaganda purposes. But most major modern dramatists who have examined the problem acknowledge the duality of the theatrical world: Brecht's Alienation Effect attempts precisely this because he considered the plays of his time too heavily weighted towards empathy;29 Pirandello's theater trilogy30 is an exten- sion of his relativist position to such a degree that the audience switch from moment to moment between belief and dis-belief; and, if we ask which of these two aspects comes first, Arthur Miller would reply, "As a dramatist I know that until the audience can identify itself with the people and the situations presented on the stage, it cannot be convinced of anything at all." 31 It is true that a member of a theater audience is selective while the reader of a play is all-inclusive,32 but it is questionable whether a good performer will concentrate upon content and totally avoid catharsis. There seems to be little doubt that both elements enter into a great actor's perform- ance33 and, once again, Langer seems to be overstating her position. More than this, in her attack upon catharsis she also joins forces with the view that the actor must "live" his part. There is little doubt that, apart from Stanislavsky's early years at the Moscow Arts Theater (he turned to stylization in 1905) and the members of the New York "method" approach, few serious dramatic theorists would espouse the naturalistic cause completely. But there is little question that great acting does involve, to a greater or lesser extent de- pending upon the style, what Langer likes to call "make-believe" and which would be better expressed as "identification." The process may be what Furlong classifies as "with imagination"; thinking is certainly involved in some way. As Ryle puts it, "Mimicking him is thinking how he be- 15 haves."34 That the actor might say he "lives" his part is not necessarily to say that this is the whole of his art; it is, how- ever, to look at the matter from "the standpoint of the artist" as, elsewhere, Langer asks us to do.35 But perhaps our greatest bewilderment about the relationship of drama and theater comes with Langer's analysis of dance. For her it is not, as it was for Isadora Duncan,36 pure music rendered as dance. Nor is it drama, and in so opposing the leading dance theorists from Sachs downwards,37 her argument is twofold. First, she casts doubt on the theory that Greek drama arose from choric dance; of this she says that "if one looks candidly at the most elaborate pantomimic dance, it does not appear at all like the action of true drama" (which is questionable) for pantomime "is dance material, something that may become a balletic element, but the dance itself is something else." Her second argument is that dance is a separate art form (as summarized above). Her posi- tion is difficult because so much of what she says about the dance is in terms of the dancer, and would apply with equal force if stated in terms of the actor; yet, as Langer has little to say about the art of acting as such, one cannot deduce with accuracy what her possible differentiations would be. For example, she has some valuable things to say about gesture as the basic abstraction of dance: to the performer it is a kinetic experience or action, while the viewer sees it as vital movement, and so, at the same time, it is both subjective and objective; although in actual life gesture is a symbol of com- munication much like speech, only when it is imagined does it become an art ele- ment to convey ideas of emotion, aware- ness, or premonition;38 what dance gestures create is the illusion of "powers," or created beings. But all of these could apply with equal force to the actor in the sense that it would make up one element in his art. The sweep of my arm when acting Falstaff is a kinetic experience to me, ex- pressive of my feeling, and seen by the audience as a vital movement; it conveys</page><page sequence="6">16 certain ideas of feeling to the audience, ideas emanating from the created being, Falstaff. My apparently spontaneous ges- ture seems to spring from the feeling of Falstaff (to me as actor as much as to you as audience), and yet Langer can say that this feeling is, in "dance," a created "dance element"-a Scheingefiil-and the conscious will that seems to motivate or animate the dancer may be imagined to lie beyond his person. But this realm of "powers," which Langer claims belongs to dance and which makes it unmistakably and essentially art,39 would apply equally to the actor in the playhouse. The dance element, this feeling inherent in the ex- pressive gesture, is as much a part of the art of Olivier, Barrault, or Lee J. Cobb as it is of Fonteyn, Nureyev, or Martha Graham. Whether, in any of these cases, the motivation may be imagined to lie beyond the person of the performer is a moot point. Much of Langer's approach to the problem is determined by her reliance upon Cassirer's work on myth.40 He showed that "mythic consciousness" was the prime thought process of primitive man and that the arts expressed this by describing the world of "powers" in which men lived. But Langer's attribution of the first recognition of them to the dance only,41 through the feeling of personal power and will in the human body, is to be questioned. Primitive mimesis, the simple imitation of real actions and events as interrelated with "mythical thought," is now largely accepted as the basis of the historical origins of theater acting,42 of the dramatic dance in modern primitive tribes,43 and of the play of children,44 in addition to dance itself. Another factor in Langer's approach to drama is the assumption that the "utter- ance" of the actor (by which she means the way in which he gives expression to the dramatic work or play) consists almost entirely of speech. For her, if the basic abstraction is "the act," then "speech is like a quintessence of action." It is only fair to acknowledge that she actually says, "speeches are only some of the acts that make drama" but, thereafter, her implied RICHARD COURTNEY assumption is that, because drama is literature and poetry in particular, speech is the one element in acting that needs to be discussed. She says that lines uttered in a play are the culminating moments in the flow of the action while non-verbal elements can be conveyed by directions like enter So-and-so, they fight, and the like; and she states emphatically that stage directions in a text "are of no avail what- ever to the actor." Now it is true that older texts may be denuded of stage directions, and we all know it is the case with Shake- speare; but it is highly questionable whether the actor today acts better or worse for be- ing without Shakespeare's stage directions- after all, when we do have them (Exit pur- sued by a bear) they are vital to the action and the actor. And while it is also true that those parts of the text which the actor con- centrates upon are "his lines," this does not mean that they constitute the total of his work-nor even the largest part of it. Quite the contrary. As any actor knows when fac- ing a script, the words are the beginning. No more and no less. Langer quotes Gregori as saying that the actor must start with ges- ture and "anyone who starts with the words and then hunts for the appropriate gesture to accompany them, lies to the face of art and nature both." 45 True. But the reverse would be equally true. The actor takes the words in the script as the place to begin his work and thereafter he builds up a gestalt of thought and feeling, sound and move- ment, which is the character within the play. No one element is paramount-and certainly not the words, as testified by Beck- ett's Act without Words. Langer falls into the traditional fallacy of idealistic aesthetics (Bradley is another instance) of creating a theory which might account for up to half-a-dozen great plays written in majestic words but, in doing so, omits the demands of theater, acting, and the whole range of plays that fall outside the scope of the aesthetic theory. Yet she does have some very important things to say when she considers the fal- lacy that drama is a democracy of various arts functioning together.46 She states that "the commanding form" is provided by the script, which is true of those theater</page><page sequence="7">On Langer's Dramatic Illusion forms which rely upon scripts. More valu- ably, she distinguishes the use of the stage to delimit the "world" of the virtual action from the need to make the scene a place- a fact sometimes ignored by modern scene designers. So, too, in a brief reference, she indicates that dramatic time is "musi- cal"; as she has much to say of considerable importance about musical time, it is a great disappointment that she has not related this in detail to time in theater and drama-a subject which could occupy with profit a more speculative paper than this.47 Langer concludes her general comments on the drama as a whole by an appeal to Oriental drama. She first discusses the term rasa, which she interprets as a state of emotional knowledge in a detached, pure, and uplifting way, indicates that this is a better basis for understanding the drama than Western thought, and then illustrates her point by attacking Western naturalistic conventions and praising the symbolic representation of Oriental thea- ter. Once more there appears to be a confusion of terminology. What she calls "the box stage, representational setting and costumes, and sundry stage properties" 48 is historically but a very small part of Western theater. Where it does exist today it represents "the dying arm" of the drama-the West End, Broadway, and their imitators-while the genuine and growing theater (now in improvised forms and experimental approaches) is in the same symbolic mode as Shakespeare, Aeschylus, and Seami. To appeal to rasa against naturalism, therefore, does indicate some semantic confusion on Langer's part because it is a comparison between an aesthetic approach of a whole culture and a practical method (interpreting a specific, and minor, aesthetic approach) which reached its height merely with the young Hauptmann and the middle-aged Gals- worthy, rubbed off a little onto Ibsen, Strindberg, and T. S. Eliot, and was largely ignored in Wilde, Shaw, the great trilogy of Pirandello, Brecht, Genet, Beck- ett, and a host of others. Finally, in support of her theory, Langer quotes from E. R. Bentley as follows: 17 From the Greeks to Ibsen the actor has repre- sented, by elocution as well as by movement, hu- man character and human destiny.... When drama takes on the abstract character of music or pure dance it ceases to be drama.... The dramatist is a writer, a poet, before he is a musician or a choreographer.... The defenders of the arts of the theater must be infected by the commodities of the theater if they can forget all "theater arts" are means to one end: the cor- rect presentation of a poem.49 Romantic criticism as a whole, and Sus- anne Langer and Eric Bentley (at least in this passage) are no exceptions, attempts to set up rules, standards, and absolutes for dramatic literature. When drama as an art form implies a written play which is as complete as the lyric or the novel, then the playhouse is an unfortunate ac- cessory. Within such a view, a text when presented in a playhouse must be, if it is to display "literature," "the correct presen- tation of a poem." Unfortunately, such a view can only account for such vital forms as music-hall, circus, commedia dell'arte, the Masque, or even tragi-comedies, as lesser works of art. Langer and other idealists cannot explain why such entertainments can provide, un- der certain circumstances, perhaps as great an artistic satisfaction as dramatic litera- ture performed in a playhouse. A simple example of this approach would be the "literary" attitude to Ben Jonson whose output of masques is comparable with his plays; yet most critical works detail the latter and pass briefly over the former.50 The concept that drama is a written play, with the unfortunate addition of a play- house, is the result of an approach that is critical rather than practical, growing from the ponderings of those who read a play before a fire rather than the work of those practically involved in the theater event. The difference is between A. C. Bradley and G. Wilson Knight, or between Coleridge and Granville Barker. The fact is that a play is a literary work which can only be fully realized under theatrical conditions, and literary criticism (and aesthetic theory) is merely one technique which can be of use to the audience in that it can bring greater understanding to the event in the playhouse. Theater is an</page><page sequence="8">18 action-a performance in which dramatist, actors, and audience are involved-and "a play" is merely one possible framework for such a performance. Acting is the external expression of a mental process whereby we live with our fellow men,51 and "the theater" is the artistic expression of this. Drama is not, as Langer would have us believe, an illusion of virtual life-or rather, it is this, but this is not its aesthetic core. Drama is a mental process: we can express it actually in real life; or we can express it artistically in the theater; "drama" is one aspect of an art form which oscillates between the subjectivities of dramatist, player, and audience. IV Langer's subsequent material on Comedy and Tragedy is less original and, conse- quently, needs less comment. She rightly says that these two themes are merely methods of dramatic construction52 but, in the idealistic tradition, she still attempts to classify particular dramas under these headings. As a result she finds herself in the anachronistic position of describing the work of Kalidasa, Lope de Vega, Corneille, and Racine as "serious com- edy." 53 Such a rigid and anachronistic clas- sification system can only operate under an extreme aesthetic position and merely has truth within the theoretic system and not necessarily in actuality. Many of her comments, too, are derivative; for example, her remarks on the Buffoon say much less than Enid Welsford did some twenty years earlier,54 and her chapter on tragedy leans heavily on idealistic critics. Her comments about the audience, how- ever, contain specific ideas of considerable significance. The art lover, she says, enters into direct relationship with the art work and not with the artist. The response is to the "feeling in it" which is not com- municated but revealed.55 These statements should be considered both separately and together. As an observer faced by a paint- ing, I establish a relationship with the work; this in itself may be expressive of feeling or it may not (it may be Santayana's "pleasure objectified" or it may not). The RICHARD COURTNEY fact is that, unless I know the artist, or he is standing beside the painting in the galley glowering at me, I establish a re- lationship with the work rather than the creator. (This is also true in the playhouse where I establish a relationship with the art work but, in this instance, through the intermediary of the actor performing.) Although it is true that the artist did create the painting, and in that sense what he felt was important in the creation of the work, it is not true (and Langer would heartily agree) that the work of art is a replica of the feelings of the artist. In the complex form of theater it is even more true, for how can the art work be a replica of the feelings of both the dramatist and the actor at the same time? The artist has feelings and, as a result, he creates the art work. This is expressive of his feelings but it does not reproduce them. As percipient, therefore, I am concerned with the artist's feelings only obliquely; I enter into a direct rela- tionship with the work and an indirect relationship with the artist. But if the percipient responds to the "feeling in it," this does not mean, nor would Langer have it mean, that the art work actually has feelings. Does it mean that the artist, in creating the work, has left some "resi- due" of his feelings within the paint on the canvas? Clearly, this is false in ordi- nary common-sense terms. Paint, no matter how brilliantly applied to canvas, cannot contain feelings because paint is inorganic and feelings cannot be part of the texture of oil paint as, to a certain ex- tent, a brushstroke can. But Langer says that, although the created form "has" the feeling and it presents this to the percip- ient, the "aesthetic emotion" belongs to the percipient and not the art work. Again, in ordinary terms, the artist can so apply paint to the canvas that he can affect my emotions. I can then respond (I suppose) with the "aesthetic emotion." I may assume (and this could be true or false) that the artist had some feeling akin to my own when he painted the picture. But it is difficult to see how the art work "has" the feeling (or "the forms of feeling," in Langer's terms) when we are concerned</page><page sequence="9">On Langer's Dramatic Illusion with a painting. It might appear easier to do so in the playhouse, when the percipient is face-to-face with one of the creators: the actor. But Langer's whole treatment of "the dramatic illusion" would rule out this possibility even it it were true. If we look at the art form in a different way, much of our reaction to it depends on the skill of the artist. A painter might have an anthropomorphic feeling about a dog, produce a romantic painting of the animal in a standardized pose with lim- pid eyes, and thousands of individuals will respond to it in anthropomorphic ways- which may or may not be similar to the artist's original way. There are similar uses of stock responses in the playhouse; for example, I can open the show "with a bang" as Henri de Montherlant did with Malatesta or Shakespeare with Macbeth. In Langer's terms, all artifice is functional. Whatever the art form, the creator either finds or does not find specific techniques which enable the percipient to relate to the work: the lesser artist may use stock techniques in a hackneyed way; the greater artist may or may not use stock techniques but he will not use them in a hackneyed way, and he will probably invent some new techniques of his own. Reid's com- ment here is pertinent: "... the artist imaginatively constructs a new object in terms of a medium, an object of which he and we have feeling-experience. Our feeling-experience of it is new and indi- vidual, concrete because it is feeling of that total situation and no other." 56 The dramatist constructs a framework of sentience and an actor, working from this base, begins to fill-out the feelings and emotions inherent within it; then, with the audience present, the art work is created between them in that situation and no other. Tomorrow night, even with the same play and the same company, but with a different audience, the art work is slightly different. If it is difficult to agree with Langer that the percipient responds to the "feeling in it" (or "the forms of feeling"), it is even more difficult to agree that this is not communicated but "revealed." For any quality or process to be revealed rather 19 than communicated it must be "there" in the first place; it is this which is the bone of contention. The plain fact of the matter is that Langer's theory, as it relates to drama and theater, is an objective and absolutist aesthetic and either we believe in universals or we do not. 1 (New York, 1953).

Yeats in his Introduction to Certain Noble Plays of Japan, reprinted in The Classic Noh Thea- tre of Japan by Ezra Pound and Ernest Fenollosa (New Directions), in contrast to Fenollosa's use of words like "passion," "intense," etc. Pound and Fenollosa understood that the Noh had a different "balance" from Western theater; Yeats attempted to emphasize the "distance." 28 Cf.

Some examples from The Messingkauf Dialogues, trans. John Wil- lett (London, 1965), include: "The contradiction between empathy and detachment is made stronger and becomes an element in the performance" (p. 102, Y2); "Or, to put it another way: empathy is not the sole source of emotions at art's disposal" (p. 105, l3). 80 Six Characters in Search of an Author, Each in His Own Way, Tonight We Improvise. 3 "The Playwright and the Atomic World," re- printed in Theater in the Twentieth Century, ed.
