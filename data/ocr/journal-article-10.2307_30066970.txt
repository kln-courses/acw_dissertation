<plain_text><page sequence="1">SOCIAL LIFE AT ROME IN THE AGE OF CICERO. By XV. Warde Fowler, M.A., Fellow and Lecturer of Lincoln College, Oxford. (Macmillans.) Ios. net. Ours is an age of immense learning ; and we have no lack of books which make a great parade of such. But it is rare to come across works which make no show of learning, but give in a clear and graceful style the results of the most extended and well-digested reading. That is the kind of work which experience has led us to expect from the</page><page sequence="2">NOTICES. 361 author of The City State of the Greeks and Romans ; and in the book now before us our expectations have certainly been fully realized. The aim of the book is stated on the last few pages. It is to show that during the last two centuries of the Republic the Romans were offered great opportunities but misused them for the most part ; and as a healthy man, who comes suddenly-this is important (see p. 68)-into vast unexpected wealth in early manhood and uses it thoughtlessly, may well- nigh ruin his constitution, so did the Romans get their body politic into a grievous state owing to misuse of the wealth that came from their conquests. But the state was not hopeless; and that wise physician Augustus was able to apply wholesome remedies and effect a tolerable recovery. It is the detailed description of the Roman organism in this crisis of its illness that Mr. Fowler has essayed to depict. And he has done it admirably-nothing omitted that is essential, and all arranged most clearly and attractively, with so many " modern instances " unobtrusively dropped in, that one feels that the men of the day are living about us at present. Mr. Fowler knows the great storehouse of material for the social life of the age (we mean Cicero's correspondence) at his fingers' ends; and he fully avails himself of all the subsidiary aids that the other literature of the time and " antiquities " can afford; and with his rare gifts of clear imagination, sympathetic appreciation, and attractive style, he has given us a book which, while we read -well, we do not watch how the pages are going ! The chapter on " The Men of Business " of the day is an excellent collection of what is very scattered material. Mr. Fowler has his joke at these " knights " (and " with a private horse," too), the most unmilitary part of the popula- tion, who had in their hands almost the whole of the mone- tary business of the empire. He points out how the societates, which contracted for the collection of taxes and other public works, answered to our joint-stock companies ; but we are not quite sure how far Mr. Fowler is justified in speaking of a Roman Stock Exchange. There does not seem to be any direct evidence for any such public institution. Of course, there must have been some way in which people "' got into " and " got out of " (say) Bithynians and other such speculative insecurities; but we fancy it was done either directly between the seller and buyer, or within the company, perhaps by the agency of the generally-useful banker (p. 8r). But indeed, as far as we know, there is not any evidence how the partes or the particulae (p. 73) were acquired or disposed of. Cicero cannot have had much to say to them; for, as far as we can remember, among the</page><page sequence="3">362 NOTICES. many letters about money-matters which he wrote to Atticus, there is no mention of any such purchase or sale-though Mr. Fowler holds, a little hazardously perhaps, that Fam. xiii. 65 (cp., xiii. 9), where Cicero says the Bithynian Com- pany is a client of his and he knows most of the shareholders, should lead us to think that he, too, was a shareholder. Mr. Fowler is an ardent admirer. His panegyrics, though most measured, lift up one's heart. The perfect blending of the noblest qualities of the Greek and the Roman in Scipio Aemilianus is ably described (p. o104). The great jurist, Servius Sulpicius, "the Roman friend of Rome's least mortal mind," has won admiration from everyone, from Cicero (Phil. ix.) to Mr. Fowler, who has ever been at pains to realize his greatness ; and Mr. Fowler (p. 120) sees one of the best arguments for the reasonableness of Caesar's policy in that " a man of so just a mind " should have espoused his cause. The " coruscating " chameleon, Caelius, is brightly sketched (p. 127 ff.): and there cannot be anything more interesting and romantic than the whole story of the married life of Lucretius Vespillo and Turia (pp. 159-167). It might well be expanded into a historical novel. The noble Laudatia Turiae (see C. I. L. vi., 1527, and Classical Review xix., 190o5, pp. 261 ff., an article by Mr. Fowler) stands beside that of Paulina on her husband Agorius Praetextatus (C. I. L. vi. 1779) written four centuries later, as evidence of the high level of conjugal affection and fidelity that was sometimes attained under Pagan influences. All through Mr. Fowler's book there are interesting and suggestive remarks. He points out (P. 47) that the free workmbn at Rome do not seem to have complained of the competition of slave labour. Again the extreme precarious- ness of labour (p. 57) and the ubiquity of money-lending help us to see why there was so often a cry for novae tabulae. The decay of even the formalism of the old Roman religion is shown (p. 322) to have left the lower classes at Rome without any religion to sustain them: so that we need not feel surprised at the propaganda of the gracious worship of Isis and the persecution it had to sustain from 58 to 48 B.c., of which we get stray glimpses. Very interesting, too, is Mr. Fowler's suggestion that various pantheistic conceptions of Jupiter as the animus mundi (such, for example, as were held by Varro) might have had a chance of becoming the centre of a real religious system, but were destroyed by the very anthropomorphic Homeric conception of that god which was popularized by Virgil. But we doubt if such a philosophical idea as Varro's could ever have pre- vailed outside a circle of highly-cultured illuminati. Our space is at an end: but we would fain recommend a</page><page sequence="4">NOTICES. 363 study of the chapter on Roman education of the day-its many defects, and its likeness to, and difference from, the education of to-day. Indeed the whole book is most heartily to be welcomed. L. C. P.</page></plain_text>
