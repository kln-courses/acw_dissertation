<plain_text><page sequence="1">by y ames Westfall Thompson THE CHARM OF THE PROLOGUE IN ONE of his parliamentary speeches Disraeli, with that biting quality which was the savor of his utterance so often, said: "The author who speaks about his own books is almost as bad as a mother who talks about her own children." Dryden, in his Fables, ancient and modern, excoriated the pinchbeck imitators and conceited, sycophantic writers who dangled on applause. They who think too well of their own performances," he has written, "are apt to boast in their prefaces how lit tle time their works have cost them, and what other busi ness of more importance interfer'd; but the reader will be apt to question why they allow'd not a longer time to make their works more perfect, and why they had so despicable an opinion of their judges as to thrust their indigested stuff upon them, as if they deserv'd no better. The witticism?or the criticism ? is only half true. There are prefaces and prefaces. The other point of view with reference to the quality of pro logues has been expressed by Victor Hugo in the prologue to his Cromwell?that classic of the romantic movement. Notes and prefaces are sometimes a convenient method of adding to the weight of a book, and of magnifying, in appearance at least, the importance of a work ; as a matter of tactics this is not dissimilar to that of a general who, to make his battle-front more imposing, puts everything, even his baggage trains, in the line. And then, while critics fall foul of the preface, and scholars of the notes, it may hap pen that the work itself will escape them, passing uninjured between their cross-fires, as an army extricates itself from a dangerous position between two skirmishes of outposts and rear-guards. The glimpses one gets into the chambers of the brain of a great writer, a Meredith, a Carlyle, through their prefaces are as</page><page sequence="2">6 The Sewanee Review rare and beautiful sunsets. The workshop of a great mind is the most interesting place in the world. Qualitatively the best of a writer's thought is often to be found in his preface or prologue. Although the first thing in the book as printed, it is usually the last thing written. Therein the author's refined thought finds authentic expression. The consummation of the work, mayhap of years, flushes his mind with a chaste enthusiasm for the ac complished fact, and the superman, under the unusual stimulus, rises above the man. This mood is reflected in Gibbon's account of his conclusion of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire. It was on the day, or rather the night, of the 27th of June, 1787, between the hours of eleven and twelve, that I wrote the last lines of the last page, in a summer-house in my gardea ... I will not dissemble the first emotions of joy on the recovery of my freedom, and, perhaps, the es tablishment, of my fame. But my pride was soon humbled, and a sober melancholy was spread over my mind, by the idea that I had taken an everlasting leave of an old and agreeable companion, and that whatsoever might be the future of my History, the life of the historian must be short and precarious. The combination of lofty thought with perfect language is the characteristic of every great prologue. The unknown priestly compiler of Genesis, looking down the long vista of centuries from the heights of Jewish monotheism, felt the wonder and power and majesty of God as only a poet or a prophet could. The man who penned the opening words of the Bible was the hierophant of a tremendous inspiration. Every one of spiritual mind must feel what no one can wholly express in this marvel ous chapter. No poet ever since has risen to so sublime a de scription of the emergence of life and light. No painter, not even Michael Angelo, has pictured it in any such way as to thrill the observer. The genius of Rembrandt, perhaps the greatest master of the handling of light and darkness, never tried to paint this supreme event.</page><page sequence="3">The Charm of the Prologue 7 Of a piece with the prologue of Genesis in beauty of utter ance and grandeur of thought, and endowed with an endless inspiration all its own, is the foreword to the Gospel of John. The harmony of the greatest inspiration the world has known rings in these lines like the peal of a great bell in the brain. What constitutes the charm of both these prologues? The implicit sincerity of him who penned them under the stress of a thought which found expression in language of noble simplicity and perfect dignity. Again one may have recourse to Hugo, this time not for analysis, but for interpretation. In the same preface above quoted he says : In primitive times, when man awakes in a world that is newly created, poetry awakes with him. In the face of the marvellous things that dazzle and intoxicate him, his first speech is a hymn simply. He is still so close to God that all his meditations are ecstatic, all his dreams are visions. His bosom swells, he sings as he breathes. His lyre has but three strings?God, the soul, creation. . . . Such is the first man, such is the first poet. . . . Prayer is his sole religion, the ode is his only form of poetry. This ode, this poem of primitive times, is Genesis. Our religion and our philosophy today have got away from the primitive anthropomorphic conception of God. Yet that conception has endowed the world with some of the most per fect examples of literature and art. It is a pity that the Calvin istic conviction of sin "which brought death into the world and all our woe" mars the opening lines of Paradise Lost. What a majestic prologue it would have been if Milton, in language no man has ever surpassed for sonorous beauty, had begun with God walking in the garden in the cool of the day? Milton's lapse was Goethe's opportunity. That invocation in heaven which is the prologue of Faust is beyond anything of its kind in literature except the prologue to the Book of Job. It takes a poet to translate a poet. Perhaps Shelley's translation better preserves the spirit and the form than that of any other.</page><page sequence="4">8 The Sewanee Review But poets are not alone in possessing this supreme inspiration. Philosophers, moralists, historians, have the same authentic note. It seems to me a matter of regret that the dialogue form of Plato precluded the use of the prologue. A philosophic structure, like a temple or cathedral, needs to be set in a great close ; one wants to approach it gradually through elmed aisles or across a wide stretch of greensward. Tudor prose, I fear, has been unjustly eclipsed by Tudor poetry in popular estimation. Yet More's Utopia and Caxton's presses are the literary glory of the reign of Henry VIII. The former every one knows?or professes to know. But how many are familiar with Caxton's prologue to the Recueil des histoires de Troye? It is fair and stately language. Of a piece with it is Caxton's prologue to his edition of the Mort d] Arthur. There is room for only a sentence : And for to pass the time this book shall be pleasant to read in; but for to give faith and believe that ail is true that is contained therein, ye be at your liberty. In the preface to Vergil's Eneydos, Caxton writes: This book is not for every rude and uncunning man to see, but to clerks and very gentlemen that understand gen tleness and science. Prose of stately measure like this, in the hands of the great moralists of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries became veritable organ music. Montaigne is the notable exception. His mind was analytic, not synthetic. He never condensed the pith of his philosophy into terse, dense form. His style flashes, it does not glow. But what Montaigne himself failed to do, his immortal Tudor translator did for him. In wiry, sinewy diction, combined with the loftiness of a high hour, Florio's prologue to his translation of Montaigne is a superb piece of writing : Had my intention beene to forestal and purchase the world's opinion and favour; I would surely have adorned myselfe more quaintly, or kept a more grave and solemne march. I desire therein to be delineated in mine own gen</page><page sequence="5">The Charm of the Prologue 9 uine, simple and ordinarie fashion, without contention, art or study, for it is myselfe I pourtray. With Montaigne, that perfect gentleman of sixteenth century France, one may associate that perfect gentleman of Elizabethan England, Edmund Spenser, although one wrote prose and the other poetry. Sometimes I think Spenser has unconsciously portrayed himself in the preface to the Faery Queen : The generall end therefore of all the books is to fashion a gentleman or noble person in vertuous and gentle disci pline; which for that I conceived shoulde be most plausi ble and pleasing, being coloured with an historicall fiction, the which most part of men delight to read. Rather for variety of matter than for profite of the ensample, I chose the historye of King Arthure, as most fitte for the excel lency of his person, being made famous by many men's former workes, and also furthest from the daunger of envy, and suspition of present time. When one reads the stately prefaces of Hooker, Hale, Bacon, Burton, Sir Thomas Browne, Fuller, Jeremy Taylor, it is like standing under the open sky at night with every constellation glowing. Their thoughts shine with the deep radiance of great stars, or the planets. Emerson has somewhere said that the gleam of light from within is worth more than the firmament of bards and sages. But not every one has a sky-mind like his. Most of us who think we think, shine by reflected light. Thoughts like these I am about to quote come from the far depths of a spacious mind and sing as the morning stars on that first great day : Of law there can be no less acknowledged than that her seat is the bosom of God, her voice the harmony of the world. All things in heaven and earth do her homage? the very least as feeling her care, and the greatest are not exempted from her power.?Hooker. I hold every man a debtor to his profession ; from the which as men of course do seek to receive countenance and profit, so ought they of duty to endeavour themselves by way of amends to be a help and ornament thereto.?Bacon.</page><page sequence="6">10 The Sewanee Review Moderation is the silken string running through the pearl chain of all virtues.?Hall. Dr. Johnson was not far from right when, in the preface to his own immortal dictionary?why not say immortal preface, too? ?he wrote: ... If the language of theology were extracted from Hooker and the translation of the Bible ; the terms of natu ral knowledge from Bacon ; the phrases of policy, war and navigation from Raleigh ; the dialect of poetry and fiction from Spenser and Sidney ; and the diction of common lite from Shakespeare, few ideas would be lost to mankind for want of English words in which they might be expressed. Who does not love Bacon for the haughty conviction of the high integrity of his own thought? Proemium, Epistle, Dedicatory, Preface, and Plan of the Instauration Magna, by Francis Bacon. "Francis Bacon reasoned thus with himself, and judged it to be for the interest of present and future generations that they should be made acquainted with his thoughts." Now contrast with Bacon's Magnificat of himself the sweet modesty of the publishers of the First Folio of Shakespeare, printed in 1623 by John Heminge and Henry Condell: ... It is not our province, who onely gather his works and give them to you, to praise him. It is yours that reade him. It is a far cry from the rondured eloquence of these writers to the quaint and humorous moralizing of Izaak Walton. But the charm is no less for the change. I venture to think that no preface in literature has more genial, pithy lines than the pref ace to The Compleat Angler \ If thou be a severe, sour-complexioned man, then I here disallow thee to be a competent judge. Angling may be said to be so like mathematics that it can never be fully learnt.</page><page sequence="7">The Charm of the Prologue n As no man is a born artist, so no man is born an angler. I shall stay him no longer than to wish him a rainy evening to read this following discourse ; and that if he be an honest angler, the east wind may never blow when he goes fishing. I am, Sir, a brother of the angle. Angling is somewhat like poetry?men are to be born so. In spite of the scoff directed at history for its alleged men dacity by Walpole, Johnson and others, the fact remains that on no class of writers has the search for truth made greater impres sion than upon the great historians. The quality of purpose, the patient labor, the endeavor to estimate the subtle values of the human heart, the necessity of appraising men and events from antiquity downward, has bred a reverence for truth, an appreciation for the "dignity of history" in the minds of the best historical writers. The pages of literature may be searched in vain for loftier purpose than can be found in the writings of the world's scriptores rerum gestarum. Open Herodotus. The wish to tell the truth is the thing which actuates him: These are the researches of Herodotus of Halicarnassus which he publishes in the hope of thereby preserving from decay the remembrance of what men have done, and of preventing the great and wonderful deeds of the Greeks and Barbarians from losing their due meed of glory, and withal to put on record what have been their grounds of feud. Thucydides was thirteen years younger than Herodotus, but the difference in the method and content of their histories is far greater than the time element. The immense originality of Thucydides lies in his constructive method of research and the incisive use of argument. He believed in studying events as facts which were attached one to another in permanent order. The preface of his history is a masterly presentation of his politi cal philosophy. Polybius breathed the same spirit, though his art is inferior. The sombre mind of Tacitus, on the other hand, though his art is nearly equal to that of Thucydides, inhibited largeness of view, and we look in vain in his works for a proem</page><page sequence="8">12 The Sewanee Review worthy of his real intellectual grandeur. The nearest approach to a genuine prologue which Tacitus makes is the first chapter of the Life of AgHcola, a work which was a labor of love. It is a far cry from Tacitus to Froissart. Yet, ignoring chron ology, Froissart is nearer to Herodotus than any other historical writer. When he wrote, modern Europe was in the flush of its youth as Greece was in the fifth century B. C. History was written along the simple, primitive lines of narrative achievement with drum and trumpet history predominant. Legend and myth, as in the days of Herodotus, passed at their face value. Froissart, like his Greek forerunner, felt the impulse, and his style has the easy, almost garrulous flow of the immortal father of* history. The difference lies in that one was the product of pagan antiquity in its youth, the other a child of the end of the Middle Ages and the Renaissance. Despite the immense dif ference in time there is kinship between Herodotus and Frois sart. The simplicity, the naivete, the dignity of honest narra tion, as one reads it in the Tudor translation which admirably preserves that archaic quality which is part of its charm, is a rare delight to him who reads. The prologue to the Chronicles has the feeling almost of an invocation. That the honourable and noble adventures and featis of armes, don and achyved by the warres of Fraunce and Ing lands, should notably be inregistered and put in perpetuall memory, whereby the preuve and hardy may have ensam ple to incourage them in theyr well doyng, I syr Johan Froissart, wyll treat and recorde an hystory of great louage and preyse : but, or I begyn, I require the Savyour of all the worlde, who of nothyng created al thynges, that he wyll gyve me such grace and understanding, that I may continue and persever in suche wyse, that whoso this proc?s readeth or hereth, may take paustance, pleasure and ensample. We catch the same high note in the Florentine Chronicle of Giovanni Viilani : Forasmuch as among our Florentine ancestors few and ill-arranged memorials are to be found of the past doings of our city of Florence, I, John, citizen of Florence, consid</page><page sequence="9">The Charm of the Prologue 13 ering the nobility and greatness of our city at our present times, hold it mete to recount and make memorial of the root and origins of so famous a city, and of its adverse and happy changes and of past happenings; not because I feel myself sufficient for such work, but to give occasion to our successors not to be negligent in preserving records of the notable things which shall happen in the times after us. The critical and inquiring spirit of the Renaissance, united in the sixteenth century with the new impulse to historiography imparted by the Reformation, by 1600 produced (especially in France) a race of scholars distinguished for erudition and broad humanity, as for example, Hugo Grotius and the president De Thou. The foreword to the latter's monumental Historia sui temporis is impressive reading, even if the effect is partially ob scured to a modern by being written in Latin. De Thou was both soldier and lawyer who had lived through the wars of re ligion in France into the wider freedom of the reign of Henry IV. The great scriptors of the age of erudition spared neither ink nor paper?nor the reader ? in expression of their thought. De Thou's preface fills several folio pages, but reveals a noble character : It is the first law of history to fear to record what is false, and in the next place not to want courage in relating the truth. While France in the sixteenth century already had discovered the light of criticism and the lamp of learning was shedding its beams on the written pages of history, England well beyond the 1600 mark still revelled in the twilight of mediaeval romance and legendary history. More's Richard 111 and Bacon's Henry VII had no imitators. Holinshed's Chronicles held the throne with their tales of Lear and Arthur. Even Milton, in the sole his torical work he wrote, did not entirely shake off this tradition. In the quaint and engaging proem to his History of Britain, after relating, apropos of the legendary history of Britain the tales about the giant Albion and Brutus of Troy, Locrine, Hudi bras, Lear and Lud, Milton introduces the quaint caveat :</page><page sequence="10">H The Sewanee Review Whereto I neither oblige the belief of other person, nor over-hastily subscribe mine own. By this time, like one who had set out on his way by night and travelled through a region of smooth or idle dreams, our history now arrives on the confines where daylight and truth meets us with a clear dawn, representing to our view, though at a far dis tance, true colours and shapes. The transition from pure narrative to pragmatic history in England comes with Sir Walter Raleigh's History of the World. Though woefully unqualified to write history, however much he made history, Raleigh's perception of the fundamental necessity to ascertain the truth yet dignifies him as an historian. That majestic moral tribute to history in Raleigh's prologue?"His tory hath triumphed over time, which besides it nothing but eternity hath triumphed over"?will live forever, conjoined with the noble and courageous finis. The preface to Raleigh's History of the World indubitably is the high-water mark of Elizabethan prologues : For myself, if I have in anything served my Country, and prized it before my private, the general acceptation can yield me no other profit at this time, than doth a fair sun shine day to a sea-man after shipwreck ; and the contrary no other harm an outrageous tempest after the port attained. I know that I lost the love of many, for my fidelity to Her [Queen Elizabeth] whom I must still honour in the dust. ... It is not the least debt which we owe unto history that it hath made us acquainted with our dead ancestors; and, out of the depth and darkness of the earth, delivered us their memory and fame. . . . The marks set on private men, are with their bodies cast into the earth ; and their fortunes, written only in the memories of those that lived with them. . . . . . . God's judgments upon the greater and the greatest have been left to posterity. . . . For who hath not observed what labour, practice, peril, bloodshed, and cruelty the kings and princes of the world have undergone, exercised, taken on them and committed; to make themselves and</page><page sequence="11">The Charm of the Prologue 15 their issues masters of the world? And yet hath Babylon, Persia, Syria, Maced?n, Carthage, Rome and the rest no fruit, no flower, grass, nor leaf springing upon the face of the earth of those seeds; no, their very roots and ruins do hardly remain. . . . Human reason might so have judged, were not this passage of Casaubon also true : 'A day, an hour, a moment, is enough to overturn things that seemed to have been founded and rooted in adamant' . . . . . . But what of all this? and to what end do we lay before the eyes of the living the fall and fortunes of the dead ; seeing that the world is the same that it hath been, and the children of the present time will still obey their parents? . . . Foras we are content to forget our own ex perience, and to counterfeit the ignorance of our own knowledge ... so we neither look behind us what hath been, nor before us what shall be.For although religion and the truth thereof be in every man's mouth . . . what is it other than an universal dissimulation? . . . We are all, in effect, become comedians in religion, and while we act in gesture and voice divine virtues, in all the course of our lives we renounce our persons and the parts we play. Raleigh's History of the World indeed is a noble fragment. An entirely different sort of history of the late Tudor and early Stuart era is the literature of action ? the infinite number of narratives of exploration and discovery of that age. To the original edition of his collection of the Pilgrimages, as he curi ously called them, the immortal Purchas prefixed a preface truly astonishing. I quote Purchas's slap at superficial travelers: As for Gentlemen, travell is accounted an excellent mo ment to them ; and therefore many of them coming to their Lands sooner than to their Wits, adventure themselves to see the Fashions of other Countries . . . and bring home a few smattering . . . . , flattering garbes, . . . . , foppish fancies, foolish guises and disguises, the varieties of neigh bored Natives . . . without furthering of their knowledge of God, the World, or themselves. The growth of puritanism, Congregationalism and Quakerism pervaded English literature with a solemnity which finds beau</page><page sequence="12">i6 The Sewanee Review tiful expression in Penn's prologue to Fox's fournal and the in imitable rhymed foreword to Bunyan's Pilgrim's Progress. The calmness, the elevation, the sweetness of Penn's writing makes it one of the serenest examples of English prose in existence. Here is a bit from Penn's tribute to Fox's memory: . . . Beyond all contradiction . . . God sent him ; . . . no arts or parts had any share in the matter or manner of his ministry; ... so many great, excellent and necessary truths as he came forth to preach to mankind had, there fore, nothing of man's wit or wisdom to recommend them ; so that as to man he was an original, being no man's copy. Then after a long and sympathetic tribute to the attributes of Fox's character, Penn goes on: As he lived, so he died, feeling the same eternal power that had raised and preserved him, in his last moments. . . . He had the comfort of a short illness and the bless ing of a clear sense to the last. ... I have done, as to this part of my Preface, when I have left this short epitaph to his name : ' Many sons have done virtuously in his day ; but, dear George, thou excellest them all.' But sometimes one turns from ponderous erudite prefaces to the monumental tomes and pious forewords, however beautiful the spirit of them, to the tonic satirical literature of the same period. No one needs to be told that the greatest satirists of the age were Rabelais, Cervantes, Laurence Sterne and Swift. Rabelais' abundance makes him overflow in separate introduc tions to each part of his immortal work, the gem of all being that to the fifth book, which has furnished forth literature with such aphorisms as "Speak the truth and shame the devil"; "Plain as a nose on a man's face" and the phrase "Hearts of oak". Cervantes' preface to Don Quixote is like unto it in sparkle with such apothegms as "Not to mince matters" and "They can expect nothing but labor for their pains". The unity which we admire in the sonorous prefaces of the great moralists is here</page><page sequence="13">The Charm of the Prologue 17 compensated for by the flashes of wit that dart across the page like lightning in the sky. In the eighteenth century the sycophantic practice of authors of dedicating their work to a patron often degraded the prologue into an address of fulsome flattery. The best prologue of the century is the preface to Johnson's Dictionary, containing the pronunciamento of his intellectual independence in the famous words : I am not so lost in lexicography as to forget that words are the daughters of earth, and that things are the sons of heaven. . . . a sentiment not original with him, as the phrase "not to forget" shows, for it is of Hindu origin and was brought to Europe by Sir William Jones. Johnson was downright proud of his lexicographical achieve ment, and he was justified in the sentiment. "In this work," he wrote "when it shall be found that much is omitted, let it not be forgotten that much likewise is performed." He wrote in a day when critics were keen to the point of ferocity. Is it true to-day, as Johnson said of his own time, that "no book is ever spared out of tenderness to the author"? We would have less trash and more real literature if there were as honest critics now as there were in the eighteenth century. In this same admirable prologue Johnson has drawn a Ho garthian picture of the Grub street literary hack : It is the fate of those who toil at the lower employments of life, to be rather driven by the fear of evil, than at tracted by the prospect of good ; to be exposed to censure, without hope of praise ; to be disgraced by miscarriage, or punished for neglect, where success would have been with out applause, and diligence without reward. Among these unhappy mortals is the writer of dictionaries, whom man kind have considered, not as the pupil, but the slave of science: the pioneer of literature, doomed only to remove rubbish and clear obstructions from the paths through which Learning and Genius press forward to conquest and glory, without bestowing a smile on the humble drudge that</page><page sequence="14">i8 The Sewanee Review facilitates their progress. Every other author may aspire to praise ; the lexicographer can only hope to escape re proach, and even this negative recompense has been granted to but very few. Before we leave the lovable and crusty doctor, room must be found for this tribute to the Bard of Avon in Johnson's preface to his edition of Shakespeare: That praises are without reason lavished on the dead, and that the honours due only to excellence are paid to antiquity, is a complaint likely to be always continued by those who, being able to add nothing to truth, hope for eminence from the|heresies of paradox ; or those who, being forced by disappointment upon consolatory expedients, are willing to hope from posterity what the present age refuses, and flatter themselves that the regard which is yet denied by envy will at last be bestowed by time. After Johnson the old, formal, dignified prologue tends to disappear from English literature, or survives in the more matter of-fact and briefer preface. Yet nineteenth century literature has a few prefaces or prologues that are gleams of the planetary mind of former days. The first of these in time, and not the least in importance, is the preface to the Lyrical Ballads, pub lished in 1798, a date which may be taken as the initial date of nineteenth century English literature. For what we call 'cen turies' are not mathematically divided periods; but epochs en dowed with a new interpretation and quality of life by the genius of man : Writing of the poet Wordsworth says : He is the rock of defence for human nature ; an upholdei and preserver, carrying everywhere with him relationship and love. In spite of difference of soil and climate, of lan guage and manners, of laws and customs; in spite of things silently gone out of mind, and things violently destroyed ; the Poet binds together by passion and knowledge the vast empire of human society, as it is spread over the whole earth, and over all time. The objects of the Poet's thoughts are everywhere ; though the eyes and senses of men are,</page><page sequence="15">The Charm of the Prologue 19 it is true, his favourite guides, yet he will follow wherever he can find an atmosphere of sensation in which to move his wings. Poetry is the first and last of all knowledge ? it is as immortal as the soul of man. If the labours of men of science should ever create any material revolution, direct or indirect, in our condition, and in the impressions which we habitually receive, the Poet will sleep then no more than at present; he will be ready to follow the steps of the man of science, not only in those general indirect effects, but he will be at his side, carrying sensation into the midst of the objects of the science itself. The remotest discoveries of the chemist, the botanist, the mineralogist, will be as proper objects of the Poet's art as any upon which it can be employed, if the time should ever come when these things shall be familiar to us, and the re lations under which they are contemplated by the followers of these respective sciences shall be manifestly and palpably material to us as enjoying and suffering beings. If the time should ever come when what is now called science, thus familiarized to men, shall be ready to put on as it were, a form of flesh and blood, the Poet will lend his divine spirit to aid the transfiguration, and will welcome the Being thus produced, as a dear and genuine inmate of the household of man. Shelley, in his Defense of Poetry, magnificently wrote: "Poets are the hierophants of an unapprehended inspiration, the mirrors of the gigantic shadows which futurity casts upon the present." Was he thinking of these paragraphs of Wordsworth's? Certain it is that many of the changes of the nineteenth century are prophesied in these words ? the progress of science, the indus trial revolution. The preface to Ruskin's Crown of Wild Olives is an example of singularly beautiful literature, both for its form and its spirit. The most recent great preface which I know is that of Joseph Conrad to the Nigger of the Narcissus, since become a classic, as the artist's profession of faith. But for me the prologue of prologues in nineteenth century literature is that written by Whitman to the first edition of his Leaves of Grass, unfortun</page><page sequence="16">20 The Sewanee Review ately rarely printed with the book. The combination of criti cism, imagination and spiritual value in this noble foreword makes it a precious and astounding monument of genius. But such prologues are as oases in the desert now-a-days. Most prefaces today are short and flat, and many a book has none. It is too bad that the courtly, dignified, even if some times ponderous prologue of our forefathers has gone out of vogue. For the prologue is an interesting and unique species of literature. Moreover, a good preface, like the Plimsol line on a vessel, shows how deep of draught the book is.</page></plain_text>
