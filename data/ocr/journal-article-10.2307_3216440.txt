GEARING State University of New York, Buffalo [Editor's Note: In an original paper titled "Where We Are and Where We Might Go: Steps Toward a General Theory of Cultural Transmis- sion," written in 1973, the author presented both the theoretical state- ment that appears here and reviewed ongoing and anticipated research activities. More than a decade later the research agenda has been largely completed (see author's Afterword), but the theoretical considerations continue to be provocative.] COGNITIVE MAPPING; CULTURAL TRANSMISSION; EQUIVALENCE STATES; TRANSACTIONAL PROCESSES. Two pivotal notions permit us to envisage the outlines of a general theory of cultural transmission. Hopefully, through use, these notions may acquire sufficient precision and elegance to be called concepts. The notions are equivalence and transaction. The cultural system of any society or group consists of an array of diverse but interlocking equivalences of meaning that have been trans- acted in the course of recurrent encounters of each member of the group with some others (Wallace 1970). Cultural transmission consists of such transactions of equivalences in certain encounters, principally of nonadults with adults and among each other. The two notions, as used here, are purely interpsychic in nature. Equivalence The notion of equivalence suggests that the two parties in an en- counter bring to that encounter their cognitively mapped prior exper- ience; that they will draw, in part, upon their respective mappings; that the two mappings will reveal various degrees and kinds of fit and ill-fit; and that the mappings and their fit typically change in the course of an encounter or series of encounters. Thus, the notion of equivalence causes the researcher to inquire about the realms of content of each cognitive map and about the kinds of fit between any two maps. The contents of cognitive mappings include at least four realms that may be Fred 0. Gearing is Professor of Anthropology, State University of New York at Buffalo, Buffalo, NY 14261.

Presumably, all four of these realms are drawn upon in any encounter. First, parties bring some sense of setting, some mapping of categories of situation that defines for each of them the particular encounter as to its kind. The grab bag of named events employed in any community (coffee break, PTA meeting, basketball game) is such a mapping. Of greater research interest are the groupings of such events into larger categories. Individuals in sectors of this society, for example, perceive sundry activities to fall into categories of "work" or "play." Domains roughly similar to work and play may or may not be present in other cultural systems. Similarly, in many societies there may be discoverable domains perceived by actors as those roughly suggested by the words "sacred" and "profane," or domains of ritual as against something else (Turner 1969; Burnett 1969). Second, parties bring to an encounter some mapped sense of the nature of the world about them, human and nonhuman. This includes perceptions of the categories into which things fall and perceptions of logics (i.e., the ways such parts are connected). The two together con- stitute the natural sciences, as it were, of the two parties. Hallowell's (1955) studies of the Ojibwa domain "person" is a dramatic case in point. Learning about such mappings of categories is one central task that ethnoscience and other forms of cognitive anthropology have ad- dressed over the last 20 years. Inquiry into mappings of the logics-the connections among things-in non-Western contexts is not nearly as ex- tensive, but Michael Cole and colleagues have made encouraging reports (see, for example, Cole, Gay, Glick, and Sharp 1971). Third, as a crucial subset of the above, parties bring mappings of so- cial identity and how such categories are connected in role relationships, of differential powers and the like. Inquiry into these mappings con- stitutes one of the best established research traditions in anthropology, the study of social structure as behavioral code or idiom, ranging from the work of Evans-Pritchard (1940) to that of Goodenough (1970). Finally, each party brings to any encounter a mapping of a fourth realm (quite different from the other three): a mapping of an implied agenda, an expectation as to how the encounter promises or threatens to unfold. The parties' senses of agenda are related closely to the other three realms. The settings "work" and "play," for example, imply quite different agendas; different elements in those natural sciences, such as whether germane aspects of the environs are somehow affectable (e.g. "War is hell") or not affectable (e.g., "The earth is round"), imply dif- ferent agendas; the mappings of identity and role imply agendas quite directly. These three realms-setting, natural sciences, and iden- tity-typically define options among which the parties can and must choose. What this fourth dimension, agenda, adds at the outset of an encounter is the anticipated positioning of self, each party in respect to the other. (Goffman's extraordinary work over the years has dealt prin- Volume 15, 1984 30</page><page sequence="3">Theory of Transmission cipally with this dimension of cognitive mapping; see for example, Goffman 1959.) Agenda is the dimension of personal operationaliza- tion: What do I want? How important is that to me? What does he want and how badly? What are his options? My options? The notion of equivalence adds a dimension to cognitive studies; ad- ditionally, and pivotally, it raises the question of fit between the map- pings that two parties bring to an encounter. Wallace has held that a cultural system tends less to generate identity of perception and more to organize the diversity of perceptions (1970). This seems a useful assumption in respect to small and stable societies, and it is self-evident in respect to large and fast-changing ones. Thus, there is the question of cognitive equivalence and cognitive nonequivalence, in the sense of the degrees of similarity between perceptions of two or more parties. There is also functional equivalence where two parties adequately predict each other's behavior, perhaps on the basis of very dissimilar maps. Transaction All four dimensions of cognitive mappings are brought to an en- counter by each party, and each party's mappings may or may not be equivalent, cognitively and functionally. Of course these are all subject to change during an encounter or series of encounters. The notion of transaction calls to attention the interpsychic processes by which cognitive mappings may change in the course of an encounter or series of encounters. Transaction focuses attention on the forms of com- munication, the kind of cognitive change, and the direction of that change. Perhaps the most readily discoverable indicators of cognitive change lie in the cognitive realm earlier termed agenda. The processes of communication in transactions seem well described, but incompletely, by models developed in communication theory. For example, Shannon's model (reported by Pierce 1972) describes an infor- mation source that conveys a message to a transmitter, translates the message into a transmitted signal that moves through a channel, becomes a received signal, is translated into a message, and reaches a destination; all this confounded by noise that also enters the channel. Alternative forms of transaction, such as between persons in an en- counter, can be, and often are, described in ethnography: verbal and nonverbal interchange between peers, as in conversation; interchanges whereby one party watches another and perhaps imitates other verbal and nonverbal interchange between nonpeers, as with instruction. Cognitive change involves changes in each of the four realms of map- pings named earlier. But changes in those realms vary as to kind and may entail the exchange of a total boundary system for another, the creation of boundaries where none existed, the elaboration or "fleshing out" of an existing boundary system, or combinations of these. Elaboration is what Fortes reported as the process by which Tallensi Gearing 31</page><page sequence="4">Anthropology &amp; Education Quarterly children learn their kinship system (1938). (They learn a "schema" and, bit-by-bit into their adult years, learn the details.) In the context of cultural transmission, the three kinds of change occur in characteristic frequencies, least to most frequent, as listed. Analogously, changes oc- cur in the mapping of logics, the perceived possibilities of connection among parts. This-seen as intrapsychic, not interpsychic process-is the focus of Piagetian studies of levels of cognitions, and is also seen in cross-cultural contexts (e.g., Cole et al. 1971). Following Piaget, the exchange of one logic for another does occur in cultural transmission, the addition of new logics is entailed pivotally from infancy into adolescence, and fleshing out (elaboration) is lifelong. In the course of any encounter, whenever maps change, they change in a direction. Two cognitive mappings may become more similar. In that case, the perceptions of one of the parties may move principally toward that of the other with little or no reciprocal movement. Or cognitive mappings may diverge, as with schizmogenesis (Bateson 1958). Here, too, one party's mapping may change much while the other's changes little. In studies of cultural transmission, the matter of direction is critical. But the heart of transaction, the aspect that looms theoretically significant and pragmatically important, is not yet in evidence. Agenda names the ways by which parties to an encounter or series of encounters position themselves and how, in course, they transact and retransact that positioning. The notion of agenda reveals the inadequacy of the communication model taken alone, for the model does not bring into focus the multiplicity of messages present in any encounter. Agenda does precise- ly this. A verbal interchange among peers may be such that each party seriously wants to understand the other, as in conversation, or seriously wants not to understand, as in a debate wherein it may be useful to willfully misunderstand. The difference lies in the way the parties posi- tion themselves in respect to one another. Of course, parties may come to an encounter with like or unlike mappings and each or both may remap these agendas once or several times in the course of transaction during one or several encounters. Similarly, one party, after watching another, may identify and imitate or may mock; instructors may spoon- feed and dictate or they may enter into joint inquiry. Such positioning efforts are not "noise"; these efforts constitute one of the messages, and are often the principal message, whatever the interchange nominally may be about. The impressive, fine-grained analysis of filmed behavior, evident in such work as that of Birdwhistell (1952), Condon (1972), and Erickson (1972), fixes principally upon these phenomena. Literature of theoretical importance, which here bears most directly, is both extensive and disparate; e.g., Goffman (1959); Bateson (1958). A simple pair of models seems to sort otherwise imponderably com- plex phenomena. First: one party to an encounter, A, transacts with a 32 Volume 15, 1984</page><page sequence="5">Theory of Transmission second party, B. They imagine two critical audiences, each constituted of one party or many, physically present or not, C and D. The en- counter of A with B may be about almost anything, and it is necessarily some exchange drawing upon and perhaps affecting their perceptions of setting and natural science and organization. But whatever that content, A also is actively defining who he is vis-a-vis B, and who those audi- ences are in relation to them. The encounter is a complex and shifting series of negotiations-assertions and counter assertions-as to who are "we" and who "they." By this first model, A has only two fundamental options: he and B are "we," in opposition to C and D who are "they"; or he and C are "we," and B and D are "they." B of course has the parallel options. In the second model, A transacts with B and they compete for allegiance with a single audience, C, which is one party or many, physically present or not. The presumption is strong that in any encounter or series of en- counters each party moves among all these options, sometimes con- gruently with each other, sometimes not. In the course of such positioning and repositioning, parties to an en- counter selectively pre-empt other aspects of the transaction in the ser- vice of this negotiation. For example, if B asserts, "War is hell," A's response probably is more related to efforts to position himself than to the nature of war (or hell, for that matter). On the other hand, if B says, "The earth is round," A has only the option of continuing that conversation or changing the subject, but his choice probably will reflect the same efforts to position himself. Still further, if by implica- tion B suggests that the encounter falls into the category "work" (for ex- ample, by alluding to an attribute of that category such as entailed obligations), possibly A will not even catch the assertion, the categories being relatively "deep." The ongoing transaction as to agenda powerful- ly but selectively affects the course of transactions in those earlier realms. The research implication seems evident. The most difficult and prob- ably the key dimension of transaction to examine, with the finest grain- ed analysis possible, is the transaction of equivalences and the failures of transaction of equivalence in respect to agenda. They key questions become two: Do A and B settle upon some stable way to define their relationships of alliance and apposition in respect to one another and their critical audiences and, if so, how? And, what other aspects of their cognitive mappings have they put into the service of this negotiation and this resolution, and how? A wit once epitomized, unknowingly, some of the complexity of the notion of equivalence. Writing (some few years back) about the U.S. Communist Party's ideological need of the FBI and about the FBI's con- verse need of the Communist Party, he called J. Edgar Hoover and Gus Hall the yin and yang of American politics. That is a system of equivalence of a kind. Gearing 33</page><page sequence="6">Anthropology &amp; Education Quarterly A Disclaimer: Boundaries There has been no mention of boundaries in the sense that no at- tempt has been made to respond to the question: So you want to study cultural transmission; by what abstract criteria do you select some events and put others aside? The history of economic anthropology and political anthropology is suggestive. Those fields struggled with class concepts that would sort events, and finally shifted to analytic concepts that focused on selected aspects of any and all events. Equivalence and transaction are notions that may become concepts-analytic concepts. In respect to two-party events, these concepts do not select, they focus analytically. Boundaries are a problem, since one cannot look everywhere at once. But establishing such boundaries is a nuts-and- bolts matter of logistics. The implication is that one wisely leaves it at that-and copes. A Final Implication: Culture It has been implied but must be said: The notions of transactions and equivalence make boundaries untenable in a second sense as suggested by the familiar phrases "a culture" or "a subculture." If treated as bounded groups, those are reifications that variously distort depending on the degree to which the communities are small or large, stable or fast changing, isolated or not. In all human situations one has, speaking more precisely, cultural systems constituted by complex networks of transacted equivalences, not-yet-transacted nonequivalences, and still others never to be transacted. Twin brothers who have lived 20 years in the same household have transacted a lot of equivalence and have but rare need to transact more. Chagnon, looking up that first day into the green snotty noses of armed and threatening Yanomamo, enjoyed very little equivalence and had yet to transact a lot (1968). The two ex- amples are different in degree, not kind. A General Theory Especially at early stages of research, one needs some orienting ideas. Anthropologists can do no better than fall back upon our knowledge of human biological evolution and human cultural history. As Washburn has said, the human brain is an adaptive organ and, through processes of natural selection, and like other animal brains, it has taken neurological shape so that human organisms learn (transact) easily and surely in respect to those things humans need to know in order to sur- vive (1972). Learning a language is a transactional process; it is virtual- ly impossible to prevent a normal child from learning whatever language or languages are being spoken around him. But, beyond language, what? The human brain came to that neurological shape about 35,000 years ago when people lived in very small groups. 34 Volume 15, 1984</page><page sequence="7">Theory of Transmission Presumably, the human brain can transact equivalences of meaning in respect to those things necessary for survival in a hunting band, and, presumably, the brain transacts more tortuously and riskfully other things newly required for survival and effective behavior in urban- centered national and international social systems. Washburn said that the unaided human brain copes readily with things nearby in space, things proximate in time, and things few in number, and that construc- tions used in coping are usually simple (and, we may surely add, an- thropocentric and anthropomorphic). Hosts of orienting ideas that will suggest foci of cultural transmission interest can be generated by re-examinations of human life in very small communities (as against human life in very large communities) in order to identify easy transactions and others presumably more riskful, and empirically to investigate in any cultural transmission system some sampling of both. A general theory of cultural transmission is at least thinkable. It would entail mapping many societies according to their patterns of en- counter (i.e., as to occasions for transaction), who with whom; it would entail identifying types of "before" equivalence states, types of transactional processes, and types of "after" equivalence states; and it would entail mapping societies according to their characteristic transac- tional careers. A general theory would then consist of a series of predictive proposi- tions about the occasions for, content of, relative riskfulness of, com- munication processes during, and outcomes of, transactions-the cumulative results being the systems of equivalences that constitute the cultures at issue. But the core of such a theory of cultural transmission would deal with agenda: a series of predictive propositions concerning what types of recommendations about positioning are sent, by whom to whom; how these are received and negotiated; and how some cultural information is preempted into the services of these negotiations, and some not. Such a theory would tell us how transmission selectively oc- curs and how, from these internal forces, cultural systems endure and change. Afterword, 1984 It may be useful to mention four dissertations which, being un- published, might otherwise escape the attention of readers. All are available through University Microfilms, Ann Arbor. Each deals em- pirically with matters raised in the 1973 statement. I name these works (rather than others which no doubt exist) simply because I know them, having had a hand in shaping them.
