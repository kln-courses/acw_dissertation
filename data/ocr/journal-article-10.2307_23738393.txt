<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE AESTHETICS OF INDETERMINACY: THE POSTMODERN DRIP PAINTINGS OF JACKSON POLLOCK Teresa L. Ebert pollock's drip paintings of 1947-1950 are among the most inventive expressions of the aesthetics of indeterminacy which has come to dominate the arts—visual, literary, and musical— in America since World War II. Refusing to resolve the con tradictions inherent not only in his canvases but in the larger artistic and social milieu as well, Pollock creates art works which are open structures embracing ambiguity and the ten sions of numerous, often contrary, possibilities. The formal characteristics of such an open aesthetics, although utilizing to some degree the stylistic vocabulary made common by the mod ernist art movements of impressionism, cubism and surrealism, completely deconstruct modernist art and literally "open up" the closed equilibrium of the traditional art object to total uncertainty and irresolution. Pollack's drip technique dispenses altogether with figuration, whether geometric, biomorphic or anthropomorphic, and instead proceeds to cover the canvas with highly energized linear systems of pigment of varying viscosity. Rejecting such traditional painterly methods as brushwork, modeling and the representation of depth (whether shallow as in Cubism or not), Pollock drips, flings, splatters, patches and blots pigments of diverse colors and substance on the canvas in complex arrangements which cancel not only the illusion of space, still central to modernism, but all hierarchies of form, and above all deny the "wholeness," and "singleness of image," 139</page><page sequence="2">THE CENTENNIAL REVIEW to use William Rubin's epithets,1 of the art work—the raison d'etre of modernist aesthetics. Rubin's description of the "all-over" "wholeness" of form in Pollock's drip paintings is highly significant in that it reveals the aesthetics which informs much of the writings of an entire generation of critics, who have commented on the works of Pollock and other postmodernist artists. The position of the formalist school of art criticism, of which William Rubin along with Clement Greenberg and Michael Fried are among the foremost critics,2 is based on the notion that the revolution which occurred in the arts during the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries—usually referred to as modernism—is still a shaping force in contemporary art, and thus it implicitly de nies the breakthroughs which have taken place in the postwar period and have led to the emergence of a new sensibility termed postmodernism by some critics.3 Formalism, whose in forming philosophy is derived from the modernist aesthetics of self-contained holism, applies a closed critical system in which the art object is reified as an absolute, complete in itself, to i"Jackson Pollock and the Modern Tradition," Pt. I, Artforum, 5, No. 6 (February 1967), 19. Also see Pt. II, 5. No. 7 (March 1967), 28-37; Pt. Ill, 5, No. 8 (April 1967), 18-31; Pt. IV, 5, No. 9 (May 1967), 28-33. 2In addition to William Rubin's "Jackson Pollock and the Modern Tradition," other central formalist critiques of postmodern art include Clement Greenberg's essays, " 'American-Type' Painting" in his Art and Culture (Boston: Beacon Press, 1961), pp. 208-229; "After Abstract Expressionism," Art International, 6, No. 8 (October 1962), 24-32; "Post Painterly Abstraction," Art International, 8, Nos. 5-6 (Summer 1964), 37-42, and "Necessity of 'Formalism'," New Literary History, 3 (Autumn 1971), 171-175, and Michael Fried's Three American Painters: Kenneth Noland, Jules Olitski, Frank Stella, 21 April-30 May, Fogg Art Museum, Cambridge. Mass., 1965. The first part of Fried's text for the exhibition catalogue deals with formalist criticism and abstract expressionism, especially the works of Jackson Pol lock and Barnett Newman, as a critical and historical context for his extended dis cussion of the more recent postmodernists, Noland, Olitski and Stella. Formalist concepts, especially the notions of "all-over" and "wholeness," continue to inform most of the recent writings whether formalist, as in Kenworth Moffett's comparison of Pollock and Olitski in his "Jules Olitski and the State of the Easel Picture," Arts Magazine, 47, No. 5 (March 1973), 42-48, or more content oriented, such as Charles Stuckey's "Another Side of Jackson Pollock," Art in America, 65, No. 6 (Nov.-Dec. 1977), 81-91. 3Among the critics who began to use the term systematically in the sixties are Ihab Hassan, Leslie Fiedler and Susan Sontag. For a discussion of postmodernism and its relation to modernism, see Ihab Hassan, Paracriticisms (Urbana and London: University of Illinois Press, 1975) and Mas'ud Zavarzadeh, The Mythopolic Reality (Urbana and London; University of Illinois Press, 1977), especially pages 3-49. 140</page><page sequence="3">JACKSON POLLOCK abstract expressionism which is an open-structured artistic mode attempting to break out of the closure of modernism. The shortcomings of formalism in dealing with postmodern art are rooted in its failure to recognize that contemporary criticism, like contemporary art, needs to be self-examining. Disclaiming any philosophical bias, formalism maintains that "esthetic judge ments," as Clement Greenberg states, are considered to be "immediate, intuitive, undeliberate and involuntary [and thus] leave no room for the conscious application of standards, cri teria, rules or precepts."4 In contrast to such facile arguments, the single most important function of the art critic today is to provide a critique of criticism while engaged in the act of criti cism: to develop a metacriticism which will investigate whether the critic's artistic views and assumptions are consistent with the intent of the artist or are part of the aesthetics with which the artist is breaking. Thus, in order to arrive at an under standing of abstract expressionism, it is necessary first to decon struct the ideational matrix of formalist criticism and suggest some possibilities for a new aesthetics of indeterminacy. This paper will, therefore, attempt to articulate the basic assump tions of the modernist aesthetics inherent in formalism and then develop an analysis of the open form in Jackson Pollock's drip painting, One (Number 31), 1950. II Although modernism rejects the linearity which has dominated Western thought since the Renaissance, it still fundamentally adheres to the underlying concepts of rational positivism. Spa tial and temporal phenomena remain problems to be solved in order that the anxiety and uncertainty generated by the con tingency of existence can be stabilized, objectified and made familiar. Even though modernism challenges the methodology of representing the object—impressionism frees color in order to manifest the changeability of the object and cubism breaks up linear perspective by juxtaposing the multiple planes of the «"Complaints o£ an Art Critic," Artforum, 6, No. 2 (October 1967), 38. 141</page><page sequence="4">THE CENTENNIAL REVIEW objects in a "synchronization of appearances"5—it does not ques tion the positivistic notion of the possibility of depicting the "objectness" of the object through rational constructs. Post modernists such as Pollock, on the other hand, have negated the whole idea of the object. Instead of simultaneously present ing the numerous facets of a portrait of Daniel-Henry Kahn wciler, as Picasso does, Pollock dispenses entirely with the an thropomorphic figure in his drip paintings and enacts the flux of energy and contingency in his canvases through the use of new non-rational, anti-positivistic techniques. The modernist picture in its completeness, resolution and wholeness functions as an analogue to the post-Renaissance Newtonian view of the cosmos as a coherent, well-ordered totality. In contrast Pollock's canvases visualize the conversion of matter and energy which are fundamental aspects of reality in the age of atomic physics. Modernism presents the idea in the art work in a holistic, timeless ideality which frees the artist and the viewer alike from the anxiety of the present and the contingency of history. Thus, to use Kierkegaard's notion as analyzed by Stephen Crites in his "Pseudonymous Authorship as Art and as Act," "con sciousness finds a profound rest in a work of art. Here possibili ties achieve luminosity and closure . . . [and are] brought to satisfying conclusion."8 Postmodern art denies this notion of "rest" in which art is dehistoricized and spatialized—spatial being used to mean the removal of art from time and its trans formation into a "spatial" or transcendent entity. Art for Pol lock is act not rests: the process of realizing the indeterminacy and open possibilities of immediate experience in the artist's interaction with the canvas. Pollock's aesthetics of indetermi nacy is open structured in that it deconstructs both the idea and form of art as a closed rvhole and refuses to resolve the ^William Proweller, "American Painting of the 1960s: The Failure of Criticism and the Need for an Alternative Aesthetics," The Journal of Aesthetics and Art Criticism, 30, No. 3 (Spring 1972), 323. «"Pseudonymous Authorship as Art and as Act" in Kierkegaard: A Collection of Critical Essays, ed.

His drip paintings acknowledge the denial of resolutions as the essence of their form. Modernist aesthetics abandons actuality in order to make the art object a synchronic synthesis in which the anxiety of experience in time—and thus incompleteness is rendered abstract, objective and neutral. Postmodernism, on the other hand, seeks to explode the static delimitations and spatialization of modernism and immerse the canvas in the irreconcilable tensions of contemporary life. Notoriously oblivious to these contradictions, formalism has established a critical system based on an affirmation of the unified sensibility so central to modernist art. As Paul Bove explains in his critique of formalism's literary counterpart, "New Criticism is exemplary of the modern temperament, that is, of a turning to the aesthetic as a means to what I shall call 'Absolute freedom' and as a movement away from time, fini tude, and the world."7 Functioning within this conception of holism and the idealized absolute of the art object, such for malist critics as William Rubin assert that Pollock accepts the challenges of the molecularity and prima facie confusions of modern life and transcends them, endowing them with a comprehensive order. His image is an equilibrated and ordered structure of modern exper iences which as art provides symbolically precisely the unity, equilibrium and absolute completeness which life lacks. As a closed and fixed system a picture is able to show life whole . . .8 It is clear from such a statement that Rubin is thoroughly grounded in modernist aesthetics and is imposing its closed system on Pollock's open structure without any apparent aware ness of contradiction. Similarly in his Three American Painters, Michael Fried describes Pollock's paintings as "opulent and, in spite of their diversity, homogeneous visual fabric"—a tran scendent optical unity.9 7"Cleanth Brooks and Modern Irony: A Kierkegaardian Critique," boundary 2, 4, No. 3 (Spring 1976), 728.

Has not the reading of unity, equilibrium and closure in these works been a function of the formalist critic's own aesthetic criteria rather than the intentions of the artist? The postmodern critic must negate such "closed" interpretations and "open" up the analysis of contemporary art to acknowledge the indeter minacy, disequilibrium and deconstruction displayed there. The following critique of Pollock's One, 1950 is an attempt to ex amine Pollock's open style within the context of an aesthetics of indeterminacy. Ill One of the central characteristics of the open structure of One, as in all of Pollock's drip canvases, is the extension of the paint ing—both metaphorically and imagistically—beyond the pic ture plane's boundaries which are arbitrary ones imposed by the restrictions of a finite two-dimensional surface, the canvas, and not significant in themselves. Pollock's drip paintings, un like the self-defined, closed and detached art objects of mod ernism, are in active dialectical relationship with the immediacy of the present. Art for Pollock, as Harold Rosenberg correctly perceives, is an act: an energized process of interaction between himself and the canvas in which the anxiety and complexity of the individual's existence in contemporary society are given full artistic expression. For Pollock it is the confrontation with the canvas in its infinite possibilities, and thus authenticity, which is significant, and not the traditional concern with the careful articulation of form. In conceiving of art as doing, as the process of creation rather than a completed product, Pollock denies the modernist ideal ization of the art object as the spatialization of time and "rest" in which the closure and completeness of the art object dis tances the artist from the anxiety of the immediate present. 144</page><page sequence="7">JACKSON POLLOCK Jackson Pollock, One (Number 31, 1950), 1950.

The action in the canvas becomes its own representation"10—a dynamic system of mul tiple contradictions and irresolution. The act of painting itself as it occurs in time then becomes one of the central subjects of Pollock's drip canvases and as such engages the artist directly in the "timeliness" of the present. This fundamental disjunc tion between the temporality of Pollock's drip technique in which art is conceived as action and the stasis or detemporal ization of modernist painting is commented on by Rubin, although for a different purpose. In criticizing the notion of "action painting," he points out that, in contrast to art as action, the finished marks on the canvas are, in modernist terms, "part of another order of symbols in which their simultaneous rela tion to each other (the time of an 'action,' on the other hand, is continuous like that of theatre, dance and music), to the frame (the space around the artist's body is boundless), their color and texture, in short their whole constitution as a picture have no equivalence . . . with the possible 'esthetic' of an 'action'."11 The marks on the canvas, as Rubin describes them, placed in deliberate relation to the other stylistic elements are part of the synchronic, spatialized, dehistoricized symbolic order of modernist aesthetics; whereas "action painting" is inherently bound up with the diachronic continuum of time that is reality. Because of the profound temporality of Pollock's technique, the painterly marks which occur on the canvas surface of One are not so much part of the simultaneity of elements which form a coherent whole as they are traceries of pigment mapping out the track of energy generated by Pollock's gestures as he records his own psychic tensions as well as the conflicting actualities of society. lOHaiold Rosenberg, "The American Action Painters," in The Tradition of the New (1959; rpt.

I, p. 16. 146</page><page sequence="9">JACKSON POLLOCK In transforming art into the act of painting itself, Pollock refutes not only the modernist notion of art but also the tradi tional distinctions between art as a "static visual object, an unmoving whole without sequence" that is apprehended "more or less simultaneously, in an instant of time"12 and the verbal arts which are considered to be dynamic, temporal renditions of actions—a dichotomy articulated most clearly by the eigh teenth century art historian Gotthold Lessing in his Laocoön and repeatedly reasserted by such contemporary aestheticians and literary critics as William Spanos.13 Pollock's defiance of the "fixed character of the plastic medium"14 extends the post modern refusal of closure found in recent literature into the visual arts and explores the spatialized rest of the art object while at the same time breaking down the boundaries between art, literature and the ongoing process of life—dynamically opening up the art work to its unlimited possibilities. Thus the drip canvas metaphorically implies the "entire boundless space" and immediacy of the present encompassing artist. "Painting," in other words, becomes "the means of confront ing in daily practice the problematic nature of modern indi viduality."15 The expansion of the painting beyond the frame of the can vas is not merely the metaphorical evocation of the immediacy and anxiety of contemporary existence, but is imagistic as well. In One, as in all of Pollock's drip paintings, the movement and rhythm of the numerous overlapping networks of fluid, con tinuous line are, by and large, random and aimless in so far as they flow in so many directions that no one pattern of move ment, whether it be centrifugal, centripetal, horizontal, vertical or diagonal, dominates.

They appear to move from top to bottom and right to left and then vice versa. Their movements become increasingly ambiguous when one acknowledges the even more diversive and indistin guishable traceries of white which overlap and intersect the black in contrasting and complementary patterns. The densi ties and contrasts become considerably more complex when the thick blobs and spatters of medium blue, ochre and silver gray pigments are taken into account. The multiplicity of move ments and overlapping directions in effect cancel each other, thus generating undifferentiated forms without any focal point. But such a negation of direction is in no way static, rather the dense layers of continual, highly energized movement pul sate, expand, and recede as the various networks of line, color and masses of pigment overlap, contradict, enhance and negate each other. The effect of such dynamic rhythms of pigment is to generate the image of a constant expansion of the lines be yond the edges of the canvas. Formalist critics, such as Rubin, on the other hand, consider "that the poured web—quite to the contrary of being a 'run-on' fabric—usually stops short of the edge (or 'frame') of the picture, frequently by doubling back on itself"16 and in toward the center of the painting, thus knit ting the maze of lines into a coherent, well-defined whole. How ever, such a reading presupposes the use of a centripetal struc turing as in Picasso's Accordionist in which the fragmented planes are densely concentrated around a vertical axis, although they in fact extend in loose, vaguely defined aggregates to the edge of the painting. To assert that Pollock's lines turn back in at the edges is to assume that a centripetal movement dom inates the canvas in order to justify reading the variety of lines, splatters and blots, which curve, are straight and lie at random along the edge, as inward directed. It is, I feel, more valid to recognize, on the other hand, the negation of direction which the multiplicity of lines creates and to refuse to attribute a ißRubin, "Pollock," Pt. III, p. 21. 148</page><page sequence="11">JACKSON POLLOCK particular tendency to them. The density of the linear net works thins out at the edge, which permits the isolation of specific lines and movements. However, these few identifiable lines should not be taken out of the context of contradicting systems and exaggerated into meaning the domination of a cer tain direction. To impose a consistent centripetal direction on the indeterminacy of Pollock's linear networks is a misinter pretation comparable in its distortion to de-fragmentizing the diverse narrative blocks of William Burrough's Naked Lunch and thus perceiving it as a totalizing narrative whole, or read ing Donald Barthelme's discontinuous narrative collage, City Lije, as a sustained unity. A distinction also needs to be made here between the arbi trary configurations which emerge from the painting because of the limitations imposed on the artist by the medium itself and the artist's purposeful shaping of various elements of the painting into what Clive Bell has called "significant form." In his drip paintings Pollock is restricted in his artistic choices by the material he uses: pigment and a finite two-dimensional rectangular canvas, and his techniques: dripping and splatter ing paint in random patterns rather than employing carefully articulated brushstrokes to define form. The viscosity and tex ture of the pigments (traditional oils and enamel in One and industrial paints such as aluminum and duco in other drip paintings) to which he often adds sand, ground glass, cigarette butts or other objects, and the fact that he is applying this pig ment or mixture to a flat surface using his drip technique means that certain limitations are inherent in the painting such as its flatness, on the one hand, and contradictory dense layers of paint, on the other, as well as the abstractness and chaos of form. The act of painting is also temporal and has duration which means that Pollock must start spreading pigment on the canvas and at another point stop doing so. In order for these actions of dripping pigment on a flat canvas to be significant, Pollock must make his choices on the basis of their symbolic meanings and manipulate his forms so that an a priori concep tion is realized. Pollock's drip technique denies the notion of preconceived form. Instead, he approaches each blank canvas 149</page><page sequence="12">THE CENTENNIAL REVIEW anew, and his painterly configurations are generated out of the process of his interactions with the canvas. Pollock's artistic selections are not intended to unfold any particular symbolic form or significance but rather are functional choices arising out of his mode of painting in which he utilizes pigment and canvas in a spontaneous non-representational and anti-empirical manner. The resulting configuration of pigment on canvas is thus arbitrary in so far as it is the consequence of the limita tions of medium and technique. Because the artistic act is a temporal one conducted in the medium of finite materials, Pollock cannot extend either the borders of the canvas or the patterns of pigment into infinity. Thus, the boundaries of the picture plane and the thinning out of the lines and splat ters at the edges are essentially arbitrary in that they are the consequences of the exhaustion of time, space and energy and not significant form generated by a priori intentions. The linear network of One can, therefore, be perceived as extending be yond the boundaries of the painting both metaphorically— they are temporal enactments of the tensions of contemporary reality—and imagistically—the expansive visual pulsations of line and color optically seem to continue indefinitely although the physical limitations of the medium cause the termination of the pigment. Such starts and stops, however, are not synonymous with the painting having a "beginning"and an "end," either in terms of the act of painting—its completion as a finished product or in terms of the image which is on the canvas—the resolution of contradictory and indeterminate forms. Both the structure and meaning of One are literally open-ended. Jackson Pollock has in fact been quoted in the same year that One was made as saying: "there was a reviewer awhile back who wrote that my pictures didn't have any beginning or end. He didn't mean it as a compliment, but it was. It was a fine compliment."17 An action, according to social psychologists, especially the theorists associated with symbolic interactionism such as George H. Mead I'¡'Francis V. O'Connor, Jackson Pollock (New York: Museum of Modern Art, 1967), p. 51. 150</page><page sequence="13">JACKSON POLLOCK and Herbert Blumer,18 has neither a beginning nor an end; it is continuous and is never completed although it may be interrupted and altered. From what we know of Pollock's drip technique, his engagement with the canvas is an act of applying pigment in a continuous process which is interrupted, changed and transformed by what transpires between himself and the emerging image, but it is never completed. Pollock only stops, or as Rosenberg would say, "abandons" pouring and splatter ing pigments on the canvas; he does not "finish" a painting. Pollock thus enacts the very essence of human action in his drip paintings. His refusal to complete his paintings, however, is more pro found than the manifestation of an act. It is the aesthetic articu lation of the ontology of contemporary experience: the inherent uncertainty of conflicting realities. Actuality has become so complex and paradoxical that it is no longer possible to sus tain a single coherent view of reality— as men and women have done in the past, whether that view be theological or secular— since whatever aspect of reality humans choose to hold as valid is constantly being challenged and ultimately negated by other dimensions of experience. The artist then is unable to choose among conflicting realities. His only authentic response, as Pollock's drip paintings affirm, is to refuse to resolve the con tradictions which emerge not only in life but in the act of painting as well, and to acknowledge the multiple nature of existence by transcribing all the possibilities on the canvas with out making any significant selections, that is, interpretations. This aesthetics of indeterminacy is stylistically manifested in One by the inclusion of numerous overlapping and conflicting webs of pigment within the space of the canvas. In employing his drip technique, Pollock applies layers and layers of paint onto the canvas, not in coherent unified areas of color and form, but in multiple intertwining networks of lines and pud l8George Herbert Mead, Mind Self and Society from the Standpoint of a Social Behaviorist, ed.

Each layer of pigment is largely distinct from the others. It is possible, for example, when looking at One to isolate a dominant network of con tinuous black lines which traverse the entire canvas and appear to lie over puddles, blotches and linear areas of ochre, blue and gray paint. Yet the density and variety of these compositional elements— lines, patches, color, texture and size—generate such a multiplicity of configurations that the individual features cancel each other. The effect is rather like a kaleidoscope: when the fragments are shaken they fall into a recognizable pattern, only to break up the image and form a different one each time the kaleidoscope is moved. Similarly in viewing One, or any of Pollock's mature drip paintings such as Autumn Rhythm and Lavender Mist, the eye, in its need to perceive order out of the chaos of the conflicting mesh of pigment, focuses on a particu lar line segment such as the black line, or a color like the ochre and traces all its appearances on the canvas in an attempt to find a dominant organization in the field. But Pollock denies such resolution, and the eye discovers that the black line thins out and is covered by blotches of gray paint or thickens into large conglomerates of gray, blue and black pigment. By creat ing a multiplicity of contradictory networks which eventually negate each other, Pollock refuses to impose a specific world view or interpretation on the complexity of reality and instead attempts to transcribe as many possibilities as his medium per mits. Thus so many dimensions of tension exist in One that neither the viewer's eye nor the painting itself as an art object are allowed to come to a resting point—continual dynamic con flict predominates. The most significant compositional elements of such a struc ture of open possibilities are line, color, texture and size. In making his drip paintings, Pollock pours and drops paint out of a can, using a stick or other tool to control the flow of pig ment, onto a canvas, which is lying on the floor, in such a manner that his entire body is engaged in movements ranging from the broad sweep to the delicate gesture and fine splatter. The resulting configuration of paint on the canvas is a dense circuitry of multidirectional lines varying from thick, bold, 152</page><page sequence="15">JACKSON POLLOCK blotchy linear marks to thin, delicate traceries as well as diverse puddles, patches and blots of paint. The convoluted line of the dripped canvas of One, instead of being the careful mark of "drawing" as most critics maintain, is what Rosenberg calls the "primary agency of physical motion;"19 it is essentially the track of energy left by Pollock's intensive, full-bodied gesturing. The trajectories of lines, the splatters and puddles of pigment are generated in the process of Pollock's total physical and psychic participation in the act of painting as the act of cover ing the surface in patterns of energy— the fundamental essence of reality in the atomic age in which E = mc2. Pollock's drip canvases are thus stylistic innovations which enact the most basic aspect of reality in the wake of the atomic bombing of Hiroshima—the conversion of mass into energy—as Pollock's psychic and physical energies are transformed into masses of pigment lying on the surface of the canvas. Pollock has him self commented on this aspect of this drip method: My opinion is that new needs need new techniques. And the modern artists have found new ways and new means of making their statements. It seems to me that the modern painter cannot express this age, the air plane, the atom bomb, the radio in the old forms of the Renaissance or of any other past culture. Each age finds its own technique.20 And Pollock's drip paintings employ a new technique for the new age of energy: nuclear, electrical, and combustion and the sophisticated technologies and institutions they have created. Rejecting the careful manipulation and control of the line aimed at "unfolding" an a priori conception of form, Pollock allows his applications of pigment to "happen" as records of the events generated by his bodily movements. The form the pigment takes on the canvas, its linear webs, puddles and splat ters, is not so much a matter of accident or chance as it is the enactment of the innumerable possibilities which can result from such a method. In other words, the runs of colors, the i9Rosenberg, "American Action Painters," p. 27. 20William Wright, "An Interview with Jackson Pollock," in Jackson Pollock by Francis V. O'Connor (New York: Museum of Modern Art, 1967). p. 79. 153</page><page sequence="16">THE CENTENNIAL REVIEW blotches, patches, lines and strings of pigment which occur are each just one of the diverse configurations which are probable when Pollock makes a particular gesture of flinging or dripping with a certain viscosity of paint. Pollock's drip technique is, in essence, a method which allows the widest permutations of pigment to occur within the limits of his medium. As Pollock has pointed out many times, "it seems to be possible to control the flow of the paint, to a great extent, and I don't use . . . the accident—'cause I deny the accident."21 But this is not to say that accidents do not occur in One, rather it means that Pollock is not indulging in automatism or depending on accident to achieve his effect. Accidents are merely part of the possibilities which are allowed to happen, and they are denied in the sense that they are incorporated into the network of energized tracer ies and are integral to the open structure of the work. In interpreting the marks of pigment which have occurred on the canvas, critics have tended to recognize the line as dom inant. However, the solid masses of pigment in the form of splatters and blobs are equally important in that they provide a contrasting system to the lines, in terms of color, form and texture, and thus enhance, fragment and even at times obliter ate the lines. These non-linear areas of pigment qualify and make equivocal the central position of the line in One. The first thing the eye focuses on in looking at One is the circuitry of bold black lines which remain fairly distinct. But on closer inspection the line in various places de-shapes itself and assumes the form of an aggregate of black blots which fuse with the puddles of other pigment. At other times the black line inter meshes so completely with thick, diversely colored patches of paint that it becomes entirely indistinguishable. Similarly white traceries of pigment stand out and appear to float over the other pigments including the black, but again under more care ful scrutiny, the white strings of paint form blotches which blend and blur with the other splatters and masses of pigment, dispelling the linear forms. Throughout the canvas the linear networks are intersected and fragmented by lines of the same 2ilbid„ p.80. 154</page><page sequence="17">JACKSON POLLOCK pigment or of other colors. The lines are themselves not fine, carefully defined forms, but consist of drips of varying thick ness and solidity, so that often a line looks like a string of dif ferent size beads. Thus the linear webs of the various pigments are continuous and at the same time broken up and fragmented by crisscrossing lines and numerous puddles. They are even lost as they disintegrate into blots and splatters or are buried under masses of other pigments. The natures of the multiple lines in One are thus contradictory yet mutually complemen tary, to borrow the concept from quantum physics, in so far as the lines are simultaneously molecularized and continuous. This indeterminacy of the line—the possibility that it can be inter preted in several contradictory ways, each of which both en hances the other and cancels it—breaks down the traditional configuration of the line. Pollock's line neither outlines an edge of a figure or a plane, nor defines contours, nor differen tiates between figure and ground in the traditional sense of clearly defined areas. (The question of figure and ground in Pollock's work is highly problematic and will be discussed in detail below.) Pollock's line denies any representation or fig urative image and is, in effect, completely non-definable (which, as discussed above, is not to say the line is not distin guishable), in the sense that it cannot be translated into a recog nizable image. It also deconstructs the potential for any hier archies of forms to emerge. These destructions of traditional aesthetic forms are caused by the compactness and multiplicity of linear networks which not only cancel any form that one of the lines may inadvertently articulate but also contradict the line's own definition as line. Similarly the function of the hues of color in One and the areas of pigment they define are simultaneously contradictory and complementary. The variety of color contrasts that exist among the pigments, and between the hues of ochre and blue and the chiaroscuro effect of the black, white and gray set up multifarious focal points on the canvas. But the distinctiveness of a particular mass or segment of pigment is highly tentative and ephemeral. The eye's attention is either quickly distracted to a contrasting color or the original color is lost among the 155</page><page sequence="18">THE CENTENNIAL REVIEW skeins of pigment as the eye tries to follow its passage through the canvas. This is especially true of the blue which is almost entirely buried under multiple strata of pigment and man ages to peek through the circuitry in only a few places. The ochre is not quite as subsumed in the webbing and can be traced more readily than the blue. However, in focusing on such sections of ochre as that directly at the center and bot tom of the canvas, the thick densities and numerous layers of pigment are particularly evident and the patches of ochre fuse into puddles of grey, white, blue and black. The effect of such contradictions is that the variously colored pigments (including the white and black) are at once disparate and in dividual and at the same time "brown out," to use Rubin's term, and fuse into puddles and piles of such intense diversity of color that they become indistinguishable. In seeking to minimize these contradictory tensions, the eye attempts to isolate a specific fragment of color as the "figure" and reduce the chaotic expanse of opposing lines, patches and color to a "ground" in an effort to control the field. But the diversity of these compositional elements denies such attempts, and the particular "figure" selected is only a fleeting phenom enon as it quickly fuses into the compact interlace of pigment. One of the central ambiguities of One lies in the fact that dis parate "figures" of line, mass and color can be perceived, and at the same time such specificity is negated by the competing skeins of lines or the ubiquitous blots of pigment. Alternately, when the painting is seen as an undifferentiated web of pig ment, individual lines and patches of color become isolated and generate focal points. This constant tension among the linear networks of various hues and between the lines and non-linear masses of pigment keep the canvas in continual dynamic move ment in which the pulsating compositional circuits of energy juggle, enhance and negate each other. The final effect is one of the impossibility of resolving the contradictions and the denial of any equilibrium in the painting. The problem of the illusion of depth and the actual two dimensional space of the canvas is equally irreconciliable. For malist critics such as Rubin and Greenberg have been well 156</page><page sequence="19">JACKSON POLLOCK aware of the uncertain and "confused" nature of space in Pollock's paintings. Greenberg writes: By means of his interlaced trickles and splatters, Pollock created an oscilla tion between an emphatic surface . . . and an illusion of indeterminate but somehow definitely shallow depth that reminds me of what Picasso and Braque arrived at thirty-odd years before, with the facet-planes of their Analytical Cubism.22 And Rubin expands this description by stating that the linear webs hang both actually and optically in front of the plane of the canvas. To this extent—but only to this extent—they recall the bas-relief, forward-coming space of Analytic Cubism. Where the Pollocks differ is that they contain no vestige at all of model ing . . . The very shallow optical space of his pictures is not a matter of illusion but of the actual overlapping of different color skeins and the tendency of certain colors to 'recede' or 'advance.'23 Both of these delineations are, by and large, accurate and yet fundamentally inadequate. They reduce the contradictions by emphasizing the shallow depth over the flatness in order to resolve the uncertainty in favor of a dominant mode which is continuous with the artistic tradition derived from analytic cubism. Given the context of irresolution which characterizes Pollock's drip paintings, such a preference for shallow space, whether optical or actual bas-relief, drastically distorts the in determinate nature of Pollock's painting. Upon taking a close look at One, the viewer is confronted by the sheer materiality and density of the overlapping and inter meshed layers of pigment which do not generate a sense of the illusion of depth, shallow or otherwise, but stress the literal physicality of the paint's texture. If viewed from a distance, however, the optical oscillation of variously hued webs of pig ment, as Rubin points out, does indeed generate a sense of figure and ground and thus of shallow depth. But, as already described above, such distinctions, and therefore the entire 22Greenberg, "'American-Type' Painting," p. 218. 23Rubin, "Pollock," Pt. Ill, pp. 24-25. 157</page><page sequence="20">THE CENTENNIAL REVIEW illusion of shallow depth, are momentary and fleeting phe nomena negated by the density of the interlacing mesh of con flicting lines, color, splatters and puddles of pigment. The illusion of limited three-dimensional space in the drip paint ings is continually being broken up by the contradictory net works of painterly elements, on the one hand, and the actual tangible texture of the pigment and two-dimensionality of the canvas, on the other. Such space is, above all, ambiguous as the illusion of depth continually, albeit momentarily, reasserts itself against the flatness only to be cancelled in return by the materiality of the canvas. To emphasize the predominance of shallow depth at the expense of the canvas surface, as Rubin and Greenberg do, is to fundamentally misinterpret the nature of space in Pollock's drip paintings. The ambiguous tensions between the illusion of depth and the physical two-dimension ality of the painting render the distinctions between the two essentially meaningless. The continual negation of the one by the other makes the suggestion of space in One as undifferen tiated as the networks of color or line. Thus space in One, whether internal and confined to the flatness of the canvas, or external and extending imagistically and metaphorically be yond the boundaries, is inherently indeterminate. A careful distinction needs to be made here between ^dif ferentiation, which results from negation, and the concept of "all-over" put forth by such formalist critics as Rubin and Fried. The diversity in One reaches such extremes that the composi tional elements, whether the directional movement of the strings of pigment, the linear mesh or the colors, become indistin guishable. But they are not undifferentiated in the sense which Rubin is using all-over. He implies that the diversity of forms in the drip paintings is reduced to a sameness in which the patterns are "all roughly similar in character and in approxi mate size and more or less even in density over the whole sur face of the picture"24 and thus create a unifying whole of the disparate elements. Such unity, however, is not feasible. The concept of undifferentiated is used here to mean that, like the 24Rubin, "Pollock," Pt. I, p. 18. 158</page><page sequence="21">JACKSON POLLOCK kaleidoscopic forms mentioned above, the diverse elements maintain their distinctiveness for a fleeting moment only be cause their polymorphism continually cancels the individuality of one element and asserts the transitory articulation of an other, which is in turn denied. Perhaps it would be more accurate to speak of de-differentiation here rather than un-dif ferentiation to emphasize the fact that what is of the essence is the dynamic process of definition and negation and not the stasis of unifying sameness as is connoted by the idea of all-over. Pollock's drip paintings are situations in which as many possi bilities are generated as the medium will support; thus, if all possibilities exist then the choice of any single one is refuted because an alternative is just as probable. It is the same with regard to interpretation. Because the open structure of One accommodates so many different interpretations, the imposi tion of any one meaning, for instance, Rubin's contention that the painting is "an isolated object, a closed, self-contained sys tem of meanings and, to that extent, an end," a "wholeness" of "transcendent unity,"25 is negated by the multiplicity of alternative meanings. By eluding determinate interpretations, One denies any singular resolution of the configurations and instead immerses the viewer in its tensions. This denial of all-over is even more strongly asserted when the aspects of texture and size are considered. Fried bases his definition of all-over primarily on his concept of the "optical" in which "the materiality of [Pollock's] pigment is rendered sheerly visual."26 But such a transcendent notion denies the immense tactility of the dense strata of pigment thickly piled on the canvas and the cigarette butts, ground glass and sand embedded in it. In order for the viewer to be far enough re moved from the canvas that the texture of the pigment melts into sheer optical sensations, the viewer would have to be so distant from the painting as to violate Pollock's original con ception of viewer participation. In painting his "wall size" canvases—One is 9' x 17' 10"—which are neither easels nor 25Ibíd., p.17. 26Fried, Three American Painters, p. 14. 159</page><page sequence="22">THE CENTENNIAL REVIEW murals, Pollock, as Rubin points out, intended them to be private intimate experiences viewed from the limited confines of an apartment and not the huge public expanse of a muse um.27 Within the close proximity of an apartment the viewer would be unable to get distant enough from the wall-size paint ing to see it in its entirety. Instead she or he would be immersed in its fragmentary multiplicity and only able to trace out those circuits of color and pigment immediately before her. Thus, in order to comprehend the dimensions and diversity of the painting, the viewer must physically participate and scan the painting from different perspectives by nfoving from one posi tion to another along the entire expanse of the canvas. This transformation of perception into a diachronic process denies the modernist attempt to perceive the art work synchronously in an instant of time. Perception thus becomes a temporal act, an exertion of energy just as painting is, and an equally inde terminate one. IV Modernist interpretation presupposes that criticism is an en counter between a subjective observer and a fixed object or arti fact, but in the post-Heisenbergian epoch such a preference for stability and certainly is no longer possible. As Paul Bove points out, It is impossible for a self to observe an object in any way which will keep the two apart. In other words, the mere presence of the observer and the act of observation alter the object. Therefore, no 'objective' description of the object is possible which does not take into account the presence of the observer and the changes in the object brought about by his presence. Yet, the observer does not adjust for his presence once and for all; the uncertainty principle is defined reciprocally, that is, the changed status of the object alters the observer's status which in turn, of course, alters the original observation. Since neither object nor observer is stable, there is no privileged point of view, no fulcrum, no Archimedean point upon which to erect the superstructure of interpretation or the critical enter prise.28 27Rubin, "Pollock," Pt. II, pp. 35-36. 28Paul Bove, "The Poetics of Coercion: An Interpretation of Literary Compe tence." boundary 2, 5, No. 1 (Fall 1976), 265. 160</page><page sequence="23">JACKSON POLLOCK In order for such critics as Rubin or Fried then to perceive one of Pollock's drip paintings as a totality of sameness, they must transform a particular observational perspective into an aes thetic value. In other words, what is conceived of as a "stable art object" is viewed from a fixed point sufficiently distant to enable the critic to maintain a single coherent interpretation of the drip paintings as a totalizing whole of all-over same ness. However, both Pollock's drip paintings and the phe nomenology of perception deny such a distinction between art work and perceiver. The fact that the scale and dynamism of Pollock's drip paintings require the viewer to actively par ticipate in visualizing the immense expanse of painterly sur face, combined with the ever-changing and uncertain nature of the act of perception itself, means that any interpretation of the painting is in a state of continual flux, and the viewer is forced to perceptually re-visualize and re-define the config uration without ever being able to reconcile the endless varia tions he perceives. The perceptual act is therefore inherently indeterminate—both in its relation to the art work and in its interpretations. It insists that the observer not only literally enact the painting's own uncertainty but also fundamentally contribute to its contradictory tensions, thereby expanding the dimensions and possibilities of the drip painting and further breaking down the dichotomy between art and life, painting and perceiver. Thus the close proximity which One demands of the viewer prevents the areas of pigment from appearing to fuse and blur into an all-over web of sameness, since the viewer is never able to get far enough away to imagine the painting as a totality or to lose sight of the dense tactility of the paint. At the same time, the indeterminate nature of the perceptual act itself precludes the instantanous perception of the art work as a synchronous whole in which the immense diversity of the interacting compositional elements are resolved and reasserts the temporality of both the art work and the perceptual act. The perception of the painting is constantly caught up in the ever-changing intermeshing of lines, disjunctions, puddles, splatters and patches of variously hued pigments. 161</page><page sequence="24">THE CENTENNIAL REVIEW Unfortunately, Pollock's drip paintings are rarely viewed under the optimum conditions of proximity which facilitate the full involvement of the perceiver. These paintings are almost universally viewed in public museums with the exception of the handful of private collectors who can exhibit the paintings in the privacy of their own residences. The museums, as a rule, conform to the traditional notions of the art object as an im mutable totality and generally display the Pollocks in settings which generate an image of fixed wholeness. Instead of con suming the wall, the Pollocks are often placed on walls large enough to frame the canvases, thereby creating a sense of a closed and confined surface, and the viewer is able to gain enough distance from the paintings to view it as a complete whole. The problem is further compounded by the sophisti cated technology and mass distribution of reproductions in which the paintings are reduced to such miniscule dimensions that they are not only seen as wholes but held in one's hand as well. Such attenuations not only prevent perceptual participa tion but also severely distort the painting by creating the illusion of wholeness, denying the physicality of texture, em phasizing the optical, minimizing the details as well as the unfinished aspects, and creating a false sense of totality and completeness. In addition, most reproductions of Pollock's drip paintings are in black and white and thus drastically diminish the visual contrasts so heavily dependent on the subtle con flicts between variously hued pigments. Thus the contradictions between the artist's intentions and the mass exploitations of the paintings become an integral part of the painting's tensions. The indeterminate, open structure of Pollock's drip paint ings is constantly being subverted and bent into seemingly integrated unities by museum curators, critics and the mass media. The tactility of the texture is denied and made tran scendent and optical in its effect. But more fundamentally, the very fact that One, or any drip painting for that matter, is a material artifact made of pigment on canvas and placed in a museum means that it is an art object and thus its existence as an action or process is negated. Such denials are in turn negated by One's acknowledgement of its own contradictions 162</page><page sequence="25">JACKSON POLLOCK as well as by participatory perception which denies objecthood through the very process of perceiving. In affirming all possi bilities, One encompasses not only the deconstruction of its identity but its reconstruction as well. It is above all self reflexive, and in its awareness of itself as a painting about the act of painting, it converts energy into the dynamic tensions of contradictory, yet complementary compositional networks of pigment. Pollock's drip paintings act out the postmodern sensibility by negating the ideal of the art object as spatialized aesthetic rest. They celebrate temporality and embrace the contingency of the experience of man-in-the-world. Pollock's postmodern aesthetics requires that contemporary art criticism become equally open to the indeterminacy of experience and overcome its obsession with determinate meanings obtained by imposing formal resolutions on the tensions which pervade both the canvas and the perceptual act of confronting a Pollock drip painting. 163</page></plain_text>
