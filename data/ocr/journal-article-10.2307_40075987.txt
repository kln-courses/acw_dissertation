Walter de Gruyter. !933' 39^ pages. 10 marks. - Nicolai Hart' Head-Liners BOOKS ABROAD Philosophy 49 mann, among the foremost of contemporary German philosophers, continues in this book the ambitious task of phenomenological clari' fication of the qualities, characters and princi' pal laws of the different realms of being, al' ready begun in his Metaphysi\ der Er\enntnis, Ethi\ and numerous articles. He concerns him' self here with what Hegel called der obje\tive GeiSt - the nature and development of "oil' ture," understood in the widest anthropo' logical sense. And although he is at once more systematic, less schematic and more critical than Hegel, the influence of the Hegel' ian approach to "objective mind" is very marked in his own views. He stresses the categorical autonomy of the "cultural," "social" and "historical" without denying that they are conditioned by and dependent upon forces and factors which are non'Cultural, and which although they may be "stronger" from the point of view of temporal and structural order are "lower" from the point of view of significance. Like Hegel he has a profound feeling for the unity and interrelation of cui' ture, but since he takes time seriously is far more sensitive to the facts of individuality and personality. His metaphysics, presuppos' ing the existence of orders of subsistence which are darkly unintelligible, makes it impossible for him to regard the categories of objective Mind as the most inclusive of all philosophical categories. He thus escapes the appearance of ontological anthropomorphism which chap acterizes the Hegelian philosophy. But he does not escape the aura of mysticism that clings to every non'empirical approach to culture. His "objective mind" has a life and self'development which cannot be grasped by any empirical attempt to isolate causes or factors. From the true proposition that the historical process cannot be exhausted by any series of explanations in terms of causal com' plexes, there is derived the belief in cultural values and meanings which are not accessible to explanation, a view which might well be called "historical vitalism." Hartmann's at' tempt to link up cultural values with eternal values is hard to reconcile with the natural' istic assumption that the whole of civili^tion and culture is from a cosmological standpoint a sheer accident. It is further to be remarked that Hartmann fails to do justice not merely to the material basis of "objective mind" but to the glaring facts of division and conflict within the culturaj configurations of any given class society. It would not require much in' genuity to transform his undifferentiated cul' tural concepts into the ambiguous middle terms of apologetic arguments for German National Socialism. Despite its many weaknesses, Hartmann has written another significant book full of insights and detailed analyses whose validity does not depend upon his basic metaphysical position. - Sidney Hook. New York Univef sity. The death of Professor Richard T. Hoi' brook of the University of California removes from the scene one of the most versatile and most interesting of American scholars. He is the author of the first English translation of Matter Pierre Pathelin, of Dante and the Animal Kingdom, Portraits of Dante- from Giotto to Raffael, and of other important stu' dies which deal for the most part with Italian and French. "I&amp;tridenttsmo (in Mexican literature) is gone, but it cannot be said to have lived in vain. . . the 'noisemakers* . . . proved once and for all that if there was to be a real liter' ary renascence in Mexico it would have to come from the rough, gritty Mexican soil; it would have to develop native themes in the language of Mexicans and not in the genteel Castilian of the Spanish Academy." - Mau' rice Halperin, in The Hew Tor\ Times Boo\ Review. "The revolutionary proletariat cannot con' cern themselves with God. There are good functional reasons for the atheism of the Marxists. The wdrd "God" has been monop' olised so long by the apologists of the exploit' ing class: theologians, philosophers, poets! ... It is unhistorical to expect the active revolutionary of our day to do anything else than reject the false "God" of the churches and the temples. . ." - Waldo Frank, in Sur, Buenos Aires.
