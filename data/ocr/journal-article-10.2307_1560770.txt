SOREN KIERKEGAARD'S thesis for his literary-philosophical works is enlightening for com- prehending the function of the stylistic techniques of the Apostle Paul in The Second Letter to the Corinthians xi 16-xii 13. Ac- cording to KIERKEGAARD, when the audience addressed does not want to hear a speaker's message, the speaker needs to com- municate in an indirect fashion. The queen of indirectness is irony. RICHARD LANHAM defines irony as "Expressing a meaning directly opposite that intended: .... Generally speaking, the more sophis- ticated the irony, the more is implied, the less stated" 2). KIERKE- GAARD calls irony a pretended ignorance wherein one portrays a situation contrary to what might reasonably be expected. In this article I will show how Paul of Tarsus communicates his message to the Corinthians employing stylistic devices 3) which indirectly 1) SOREN KIERKEGAARD, The Point of View for my Work as an Author (New York: Harper and Row, 1973), 40o. 2) RICHARD A.

Leaska at New York University for his suggested stylistic and linguistic methods for studying style and encouragement to share her findings with others. Literary criticism has been an old friend of New Testament Studies. Therefore the recent interfield wedding of literary criticism with the new linguistic studies appears to be of benefit to Biblical criticism. It is both comparative and quantitative. Instead of employing a small pericope to study the reader may have noticed that I have over a 500 word Greek sample. My aim is to under- stand the author's style and at least that large a sample is needed to observe consistent elements. I performed ten operations on this sample. The first four operations exemplify more traditional literary tasks and the latter six more current linguistic tasks: i) the recognition of addition, omission, substitution and transposition sentence changes. Addition changes to a</page><page sequence="2">350 AIDA BESANjON SPENCER yet powerfully and expertly reinforce his central message. He has communicated his true message with tone, rhetorical devices, adversative logic, images, adverbial clauses, sentence transforma- tions, perspective, verbs and minimal use of value-laden adjectives, high use of polysyllables, and variety of sentence length. sentence include pleonasism, polysyndeton, anaphora, parallelism, and seriation. Omission changes to a sentence include asyndeton and ellipsis. Transpositions include word inversion, the transposition of an adjective or adverbial phrases and clauses. Substitutions may be lexical, morphological, syntactical or figurative (for example, litotes, personification, simile, meta- phor, synecdoche, and syllepsis). 2) the employment of Leo Spitzer's philo- logical circle. This operation begins with an analysis of the style's tone and then is verified by an analysis of the style's content. The latter analysis includes a study of the number of monosyllabic and polysyllabic words, frequency of modifiers, number and repetition of nouns, concrete versus abstract images, noun antecedents, sentence size and structure. 3) the identification and analysis of the significance of imagery. 4) the identification and analysis of function of adverbs and adverbial clauses. 5) the analysis of the complexity of the writing as measured by average clause length syllables , ratio of clauses per terminable unit, which is usually called clauses t unit and is a main clause, clauses average length of at unit main clauses smainyllables ) the ratio of t units per sentence and the average length of a sentence (measured by number of syllables). 6) the calculation of verb ( number of verbals density number of verbs" 7) propositional reduction, the reduction number of finite verbs of each sentence to its cognitive content. 8) logical diagrams, the diagram- ming of each of the propositional reductions to ascertain the manner in which the thoughts of each sentence precede one another. Propositions are classified as initial, additive, adversative, alternative, explanatory, il- lustrative, illative, or causal. 9) the differentiation of abstract versus con- crete nouns. Io) the determination of standard deviation to ascertain variety of sentence length. Standard deviation is found by the completion of the nx2 - (x)2 formula where n equals number of sentences, E equals total n number of syllables in all the sentences and x equals number of syllables in each sentence. RICHARD A. LANHAM's Style: An Anti-Textbook (New Haven: Yale University Press, 1974) provides an excellent introduction to the field of stylistics. While similarly interested in Paul's style in this pericope, JOSEF ZMIJEWSKI has analyzed it employing other tools of a non-quantitative nature focusing on a verse by verse movement of thought in 2 Cor. xi i - xii Io and then has evaluated Paul's composition skills by such criteria as consistency, clearness, vividness, repetition and variation, appropriateness, dexterity, uniformity, trustworthiness.

XI-XII) 351 That Paul may have needed to be indirect is quite likely. This is at least the second letter he wrote to Corinth. Apparently a certain number of people were urging the congregation to abandon his advice and leadership despite the years of careful attention he had given them. They were complaining that "His letters are weighty and strong, but his bodily presence is weak, and his speech of no account" (x Io RSV). This is the context in which he had to write. I. Tone If a word is to be found to describe Paul's tone in this passage I would say "sardonic" is best. A sardonic tone is defined by Webster's Dictionary as bitterly ironical. It is not sarcastic, in other words, sneering, caustic, cutting, or taunting. A bitter irony seems to incorporate the communication of pathos, rejection yet drama and power in Paul's tone. Is this initial reaction supported by the style ? Definitely. II. Rhetorical Devices The rhetorical devices which Paul most frequently employs in this pericope are metaphor (21), irony (9), and parallelism (8). These three devices account for over 50 per cent of the devices 4) he employs. Metaphor and irony by themselves account for over 44 per cent of the total. When Paul writes in xii 11-12 "For in no respect I fell short of the outstanding apostles, if even I am worth nothing; on the one hand the signs of the apostle were worked out among you in all patient endurance, for signs but also for portents and for deeds of power" there can be no doubt the term "out- standing" (67,epMv) is used completely ironically. The context of the sentence as well as the passage would indicate that these other 4) Stylistic features: a) Sentence additions (19): parallelism (8) xi 17, 18, 22-23, 29, 30; xii 1-2, 5; pleonasm (4) xi 16, 18, 21, 23-28; seriation (4) xi 19, 22-28; xii io; anaphora (2) xi 19, 23-28; polysyndeton (i) xii 13; b) Sentence omissions (6): ellipsis (4) xi 18, 19-20, 22-28; asyndeton (2) xi 19-20, 23-28; c) Sentence substitutions (28): metaphor (21 or 6) xi 18, 19-2o, 21, 22-28, 29, 30, 31; xii 2, 5, 7, 8-9, io, II, 13; personification (3) xi 18; xii 7; synecdoche (3) xi 18, 32-33; xii ii; anthropomorphism (i) xi 31; litotes (o); syllepsis (o); simile (o); d) other devices (14): irony (9) xi 16, 17, 19-20, 21, 29; xii 5, 11, 13; meiosis (2) 11:16; 12:11; chiasmus (2) xi 21; xii 7; prolepsis (i) xi 23-28.</page><page sequence="4">352 AIDA BESAN?ON SPENCER "apostles" were the ones falling short. In this same sentence we can see one of his many uses of metaphor. Many of them are inherent in the word itself 5). For instance, 6arpeco (xii ii), may be translated "I fall short of, lack, have need of; am inferior to" 6). Thus it may be translated by its literal base or metaphorical significance. When the six sentences in xi 22 are reduced to their simplest propositions 7), they appear to be identical 8): "They are Jewish.

Reduced to their simplest propositions they would read: Sentence I (xi 16) I will speak for myself. Sentence 2 (xi 17) Of my own accord I speak for myself. Sentence 3 (xi 18) Since others speak for themselves, I will also speak for myself. Sentence 4 (xi 19-20) You do not mind if someone treats you like a slave. Sentence 5 (xi 21) We have not treated you like a slave. Sentence 6 (xi 22a) They are Jewish. Sentence 7 (xi 22b) I am also Jewish. Sentence 8 (xi 22c) They are Jewish. Sentence 9 (xi 22d) I am also Jewish. Sentence o0 (xi 22e) They are Jewish. Sentence ii (xi 22 f.) I am also Jewish. Sentence 12 (xi 23a) They say they obey Jesus. Sentence 13 (xi 23b-28) I obey Jesus more than they do since I have had more difficulties. Sentence 14 (xi 29a) I have physical needs similar to other people. Sentence 15 (xi 29b) I am not happy when people no longer obey Jesus. Sentence 16 (xi 30) I will speak of my difficulties. Sentence 17 (xi 31) God knows I am accurate. Sentence 18 (xi 32-33) I avoided arrest by Aretas at Damascus. Sentence 19 (xii i) I will speak about revelations from God. Sentence 20 (xii 2) I was taken to God's presence. Sentence 21 (xii 3-4) I can not share with you what I heard. Sentence 22 (xii 5) I will speak about difficulties. Sentence 23 (xii 6-7a) I will speak only truth about myself so that people will not over- estimate what happened to me. Sentence 24 (xii 7b) I was kept from being over-confident. Sentence 25 (xii 8-9a) God answered my request. (The quote attributed to the Lord is not included in this analysis since all possible quotations are uniformly omitted according to this methodology. Of course, the sentence probably is a paraphrase of the Lord's message but nevertheless no questionable sentence is included.) Sentence 26 (xii 9b) God empowers me when I speak of my difficulties. Sentence 27 (xii io) I am happy with difficulties because then I am strengthened by God. Sentence 28 (xii i a) I had to speak for myself since you did not speak for me. Sentence 29 (xii I Ib- 12) I performed the work of an apostle in your presence. Sentence 30 (xii 13a) I did not ask you to pay my salary. Sentence 31 (xii 13b) It was proper for you not to pay my salary. 8) F. F. BRUCE suggests that "Hebrew" is probably a more specialized term than "Israelite" or "Jew": "The distinction was probably linguistic and cultural: the Hebrews, in that case, attended synagogues where the service was conducted in Hebrew and used Aramaic as their normal mode of speech, while the Hellenists spoke Greek and attended synagogues where the scrip- tures were read and the prayers recited in that language." Paul: Apostle of the Heart Set Free (Grand Rapids: Eerdmans, 1977), 42.</page><page sequence="5">A STUDY OF IRONY IN PAUL (2 COR. XI-XII) 353 also Jewish". Paul achieves his balance and variety in parallelism. '"EppoctoL, 'Iap tocr, appmc 'Apppcc." are synonyms, balanced by "xyco", "I also". The concluding "8?CxovoL Xpla-ro5" in xi 23 in context would complete the parallel structure, thus it would be synonymous to the preceding three nouns for "Jewish". But to the question, "Are they servants of Christ ?" there is no "&amp;xy(". Would this imply some irony on whether "servants of Christ," as the opponents might suggest, is indeed synonymous to the other three names ? Paul also employs ellipsis (5) quite expertly to communicate in- directly. "Are they servants of Christ? Being out of my mind I speak, even more I; .... " Without the deletion, the second clause would read, "I [am] even more [a servant of Christ]". But Paul does not think it wise to say this directly. The Corinthians would be resistant to his criticism of their newly discovered leaders. By using ellipsis, his fourth most popular rhetorical device, Paul causes his readers to pause and reflect upon the missing words. Paul further attempts to reorient the Corinthians' expectations by employing asyndeton, defined by the Oxford English Dictionary on Historical Principles as "A rhetorical figure which omits the conjunction". "For gladly you are patient of the fool being wise; for you are patient if anyone makes you a slave, if anyone exploits, if anyone takes, if anyone puts on airs, if anyone strikes your face" (xi 19-20). The emphasis in asyndeton is usually on effect. The effect is for surprise. The only occurrence of polysyndeton is late, sentence thirty (xii 13). Interestingly, I did not find any examples of hyperbole or simile in this passage. The rhetorical devices Paul does favor, metaphor, irony, parallelism, ellipsis, are understatements and much less direct. III. Logic It was very difficult to reduce Paul's sentences to their propo- sitions due to the difficulty of reducing metaphors and rhetorical questions. "They say they obey Jesus," the reduced proposition certainly appears different than "Are they servants of Christ ?" Only sentence eighteen (xi 32) required the mere reduction of facts: "I avoided arrest by Aretas at Damascus". When these propositions are classified, one may discover that 23</page><page sequence="6">354 AIDA BESAN?ON SPENCER the greatest amount of space is allotted to adversative logic 9). An adversative proposition is one which changes the direction of the argument. It is almost a negation. "But, however, on the other hand" are clue words. This correlates with Paul's high use of irony. He portrays the views of his opponents as if agreeing with them but then goes on to show them mistaken 10). I classified most of Paul's sentences as explanatory. Paul develops his thesis by restating it, defining it and expanding each previous proposition. This shows his careful manner of writing to this dissident group. IV. Images The images Paul employs also provide a key to his style. There are almost two times more abstract than concrete images in this passage 11). Over 81 per cent of the nouns are abstract 12). Abstract images tend to produce distance between the narrator and the reader since they force the reader to concretize. Humor in general but particularly ironic humor arises from forming a certain detach- ment from reality and one's self. Paul employs the following abstract images: fool, sick, servant, nakedness, attack, weakness, fall short of, be a burden. All of these images tend to have negative connotations. Who wants to be a fool ? Who wants to be weak ? Evidently, these were the types of images the Corinthian adversaries 9) Adversative logic: 315 syllables or 4 sentences; I I explanatory proposi- tions or 294 syllables; 4 additive propositions or 177 syllables; 4 illustrative propositions or 144 syllables; 2 initial propositions or 64 syllables; I illative proposition or 45 syllables; 4 alternative propositions or 17 syllables; I causal proposition or 12 syllables. 10) H. D. BETz suggests that in chapters 10-13 Paul employs a "defense speech" such as a philosopher of the Socratic-Cynic tradition might employ in contrast to the style of "self-defense" of the rhetorician and sophist: "As in a defense speech, Paul quotes the accusation and takes up phrases from his opponents, in order to change them around for his own defense" (p. 5). JOHN DILLON of the Department of Classics at the University of California in contrast thinks Paul's style is more that of a "gifted natural orator" (p. 18). "Paul's Apology II Corinthians 10-13 and the Socratic Tradition," The Center for Hermeneutical Studies, Colloquy 2 (Berkeley: The Center for Hermeneuti- cal Studies, 1975). Full evidence is cited in Der Apostel Paulus und die sokratische Tradition (Tiibingen: J. C. B. Mohr, 1972). xx) There are 8 concrete images and 15 abstract images in this pericope. "Abstract" here refers to not having a material thing as a referent. It does not refer to general as opposed to specific. 12) There are 21 concrete nouns (sentences 6, 8, 13, 17, i8, 20, 24) and 91 abstract nouns (sentences 2, 3, 4, 5, 10, 12, 13, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 23, 24, 26, 27, 29, 31) in this passage.</page><page sequence="7">A STUDY OF IRONY IN PAUL (2 COR. XI-XII) 355 were using to describe Paul. Istead of assuming their negative connotations, taking an ironic stance, Paul plays with these words to change the Corinthian perspective, "..., even as a fool receive me, ..." (xi 16), "For gladly you being wise are patient of the fool; for you are patient if anyone makes you a slave, ..." (xi 19-2oa), "For if I may wish to boast, I will not be a fool, for truth I will speak; ..." (xii 6), "I have become a fool; you compelled me; ..." (xii II). Paul is famous for his use of the metaphor "weakness." The term O'aOev'c literally means to be physically not strong or to be sick or ill 13). In sentence five (xi 21), for example, he writes, "According to shame I say, as that we have been weak; ...". Here weakness would be the opposite of the exploitation described in sentence four (xi 19-20). Of course this is completely ironical. Would Christians judge strength identical to enslaving or exploiting or taking or putting on airs or striking people's faces ? If the abstract images tend to be ones which were used to describe Paul, the concrete images tend to be ones used to describe his opponents: flesh, eat, raise, seed. Although graphic, they tend to connote temporary material objects and actions. But there is one concrete image which describes Paul, to burn. And this is the only image which is positive. It is a hint toward a true perspective of Paul. Fire is powerful, awesome, and dangerous. V. Adverbial Clauses Paul's desire to communicate to a hesitant audience may further be seen in the functioning of the adverbial clauses in the passage. There are more adverbial clauses than adjectival, noun, or paren- thetical clauses, respectively, 19, Io, 8, 6. Until sentence twenty- four (xii 7b), the adverbial clauses, many of them in an ironic manner, are used to describe Paul's opponents. He could have more directly done this in main clauses or at least in adjectival clauses. The directness of his communication also fluctuates within the adverbial clauses. At first they function ironically, stating the opposite of his intention. "... ; But if not, even if as a fool receive me, [so that I also may boast some little]" 14) (xi 16). "[Since many are boasting according to flesh, I also will boast" (xi 18). "...; For you are patient ... [if anyone makes you a slave], 13) J. H. THAYER, Thayer's Greek-English Lexicon of the New Testament (Delaware: National Foundation for Christian Education, 1885), 8o. 14) Adverbial clauses are indicated by brackets.</page><page sequence="8">356 AIDA BESAN9ON SPENCER [if anyone exploits], [if anyone takes], [if anyone puts on airs], [if anyone strikes your face]" (xi 19-20). "...; [In which con- tinually some are bold], in foolishness I say, I am also bold" (xi 21). Indirectly, through the adverbial clauses, Paul is describing his "opponents". This is not the kind of appraisal that these other leaders would welcome. This is why Paul had indirectly to com- municate it to them. In sentence sixteen (xi 30) the adverbial clauses begin to take on a change of function. Here we find an instance in this passage of an adverbial clause employed with its main clause functioning not ironically. Through sentence twenty-three (xii 6), Paul com- municates partially directly, but no longer displays the humor of inappropriate truths set next to one another. "[If to boast it is necessary], the things of my weakness I will boast" (xi 30). "[For if I may wish to boast], I will not be a fool, for I will speak truth; ..." (xii 6). The readers may naturally respond, "We thought Paul had just finished boasting!" Again, he indirectly describes his opponents. They are boasting in a foolish manner. The first completely direct communication in an adverbial clause occurs in sentence twenty-three (xii 6). "...; But I refrain, [lest someone into me may credit [beyond which he sees me or he hears something out of me even to the extraordinary quality of the revelations]". Again, he still indirectly describes his opponents. Apparently they were receiving fame for more than they had accomplished. But here Paul carefully explains himself in the adverbial clause. The same occurs in sentences twenty-four (xii 7b) and twenty-five (xii 8). "For this reason, [in order that I may not be puffed up with pride], a thorn for the flesh was given to me, a messenger of Satan, [in order that he may strike me with a fist], [in order that I may not be puffed up with pride]". "In behalf of this three times the Lord I summoned to my aid [in order that he may keep away from me]; . . . ". Paul may be implying in the first adverbial clause that his opponents were "puffed up with pride". In verse twenty of chapter twelve he does directly com- municate to his readers that he expects to find pride (puauocaLc) at Corinth. Yet in these two sentences Paul certainly does describe his situation in an indirect fashion. Paul's irony reaches a climax in sentences twenty-six and twenty-seven (xii 9b-Io). He employs paradox, which LANHAM defines as, "A seemingly self-contradictory statement, which yet</page><page sequence="9">A STUDY OF IRONY IN PAUL (2 COR. XI-XII) 357 is shown to be (sometimes in a surprising way) true: ..." 15). "Therefore gladly rather I will boast in my weaknesses, [in order that the strength of the Christ may take up its abode upon me] (xii 9b) .... [For whenever I am weak], at that time I am strong" (xii Iob). The two adverbial clauses contain each aspect of this paradox. The charges of weakness and claims to strength of the Corinthians have been redefined and reversely valued. Weakness is strong and strength is weak-Paul's final coup! In the denouement, Paul comes back to irony; this time a bitter irony. "For in no respect I fell short of the outstanding apostles, [if even I am worth nothing]; ..." (xii IIb). Paul employs meiosis, understatement. Of course he thinks he is worth something. The passage concludes with the completely sardonic main clause: "Forgive me this injustice" (xii 13b). To have the Corinthians not pay his salary certainly is no injustice. Thus by looking at the function of the adverbial clauses we have seen how Paul uses irony and the movement of indirectness to directness to communicate better with his most hesitant readers. The adverbial clauses first function completely indirectly using much irony, then partly directly, completely directly, at their climax they become paradoxical, and, finally, they return to irony. The concluding main clause is completely ironical. VI. Sentence Transformations This same attempt to reach the Corinthians' subliminal level is accomplished in Paul's varied use of sentence transformations. Of course Greek has much greater flexibility in this area than Eng- lish 16) and Paul uses his language to fullest advantage. The first sentence may be rendered literally, "Again I say, not some me will suppose for themselves a fool to be; but if not, even if as a fool receive me, so that I also little some I may boast" (xi 16). In the first main clause, Paul emphasizes the words "me" and "fool" by having these direct objects precede rather than follow their respective verbs 17). Thus indirectly he is saying that you are not 15) A Handlist of Rhetorical Terms, 71. 16) A. T. ROBERTSON, A Grammar of the Greek New Testament in the Light of Historical Research (Nashville: Broadman Press, 1934) 417-425 were con- sulted on the uniqueness of Greek word sequence. 17) F. BLASS and A. DEBRUNNER, A Greek Grammar of the New Testament, trans. by R. W. FUNK (Chicago: University of Chicago, I961), 248.</page><page sequence="10">358 AIDA BESAN?ON SPENCER wise at all in desiring sadistic leaders but, to think, you then believe I am the unwise person! By moving the adverbial direct object Axp6v y "little some" before the verb he understates his next request, I merely want to boast a little. He continues to heighten this ironic effect in xi 19, sentence four. "For gladly you are patient of the fool wise being; ...". The predicate adjective "wise" precedes the verb it modifies. Thus, their wisdom is emphasized and in doing this Paul stretches the extent to which what he says opposes what he means. Rather than being very wise, the Corin- thians are very foolish indeed. Sentences seventeen (xi 31) and twenty-three (xii 6-7) form an interesting contrast to one another. In the former, the main meaning of the sentence is contained in a noun clause which is withheld until the end 18). "The God and Father of the Lord Jesus knows, the one being praised into the ages, that I am not lying". But in sentence twenty-three Paul then dares to say, "I am not lying" both in a positive manner, in a main clause, emphasizing the word "truth", "..., For truth I will speak; ... ". Since the direct object is placed before the verb, Paul emphasizes not that he speaks or how he speaks, but what he speaks: truth. Transformations are employed to such a large extent that sentence twenty-seven (xii io), the concluding sentence, stands out because of its regular word order. "For this reason I delight in weaknesses, in insults, in calamities, in persecutions and difficulties, in behalf of Christ; for whenever I am weak, at that time strong I am". The only variation occurs in the final main clause. Paul breaks the parallel structure by moving the adjective "strong". This causes the paradox of strength to come to the fore. VII. Perspective Thus we have seen how Paul has used tone, rhetorical devices, logic, images, adverbial clauses, sentence transformations rather than cognitive information in main clauses to communicate his message. He completes this ironical conmunication by means of his perspective, verbs and minimal use of value-laden adjectives, high use of polysyllables, and variety of sentence length. If in any way his perspective can be classified, it might be called that of a participant observer except that he is the participant observed! 18) Grammar of the Greek New Testament, 425.</page><page sequence="11">A STUDY OF IRONY IN PAUL (2 COR. XI-XII) 359 Paul speaks about himself. We the readers stand watching Paul in his many adversities and journeys, almost in the same way Paul had watched Stephen. "The witnesses left their cloaks in charge of a young man named Saul. They kept on stoning Stephen ..." (Acts vii 58-59a TEV). In perspective again we can see deep feeling protected by a device creating a distance from the emotion. VIII. Verbs and Minimal Use of Value-Laden Adjectives Paul does not do much direct interpretation for us in his ad- jectives. There are many less adjectives (19) and adverbs (17) than verbs (96) or nouns (112). At most, only half of the adjectives have value implications. Forty-seven per cent of the adjectives have attached clear values such as "foolish", "praised", "unutter- able", "strong", "outstanding" 19). Nevertheless, "foolish", "strong", and "outstanding" are all pivotal words which function significantly in Paul's communication. The verbs must carry Paul's interpretation and values. Paul positively values appropriate action, not empty talk. There are over five times more active than passive verbs, over six times more finite verbs than verbals, and almost three times more verbs than nominals 20). IX. High Use of Polysyllables and Variety of Sentence Length Over 61 per cent of the Greek words are polysyllabic. Generally the more polysyllables in a sample, the less direct is the com- munication. Although II Corinthians xi 16-xii 13 renders more syllables in Greek (io68) 21) than two of its English translations (Today's English Version: 1025, King James Version: 973), it has the least number of words (505 as opposed to 823 and 692). The Greek also has almost three times more variety in sentence length than the TEV and almost two times more variety in sentence length than the KJV. Thus it would appear that Paul employs length of sentence and clause rather than subordination of clause as his principal means by which to achieve variety. As one reads, this variety of length creates an unexpected effect, it is as if Paul 19) Other adjectives are noX)ot "many", napex'c6 "unmentioned", =ai-v "of all" (2), motoiurov "such" (3), 'ptrou "third", rocrn' "this" (I), XhoL0k "remaining". &amp;cpovo "foolish" occurs 5 times for a total of 19 adjectives, 7 of which are repeated. 20) There are 83 finite verbs, 70 active, 13 passive, 13 verbals, 96 verbs as opposed to 33 nominals. 21) The third edition of ALAND, K., and others, The Greek New Testament (Miinster: United Bible Societies, 1975) has been employed.</page><page sequence="12">360 AIDA BESAN9ON SPENCER were knocking down a boxer with changing types of punches: sometimes long and steady, sometimes a surprise punch from the side. X. Conclusion "For this reason I delight in weaknesses, in insults, in calamities, in persecutions and difficulties, in behalf of Christ; for whenever I am weak, at that time I am strong". This is no message which the Corinthians would enthusiastically hear. It is a message few people of any time would find acceptable! Nor were the Corinthians momentarily disposed toward hearing it from, of all persons, Paul of Tarsus, the mentor they were rejecting. Paul as a highly capable writer had to resort to the ironic stance, pretended igno- rance, humor, indirectness. This he did. Paul moved his argument from indirectness to directness. He packed meaning in metaphor, irony, parallelism and the careful use of images. He brought out irony by changing his sentence order. He omitted crucial meaning in ellipsis forcing his readers to supply it. He caught his readers unexpectedly through asyndeton and varied sentence length. He kept changing the flow of his argument. He slipped crucial des- criptions of his opponents into adverbial clauses. He kept his perspective aloof yet passionate. His verbs rather than modifiers did his interpretation for him. His tone was a window into his style. THEODOR ZAHN reasons that his communication was a success 22). Today Paul's irony and indirectness may appear to cloud his message for readers, but his style reveals all. 22) T. ZAHN, Introduction to the New Testament (New York: Charles Scribner's Sons, 1917) I, 342-343. A strength which is misperceived as weakness is also beautifully illustrated in SOREN KIERKEGAARD'S parable "The Obedient Hound" prefacing Attack Upon Christendom from the Journal X12 A 423: "Imagine a big, well-trained hunting dog. He accompanies his master on a visit to a family where, as all too often in our time, there is a whole assembly of ill-behaved youths. Their eyes hardly light upon the hound before they begin to maltreat it in every kind of way.
