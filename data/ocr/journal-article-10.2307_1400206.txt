When reading a sentence such as "You illuminate all phenomena as they are and as they appear" (p. 85), one cannot help wondering by what definition of "phenomena" this sentence makes sense. For the academic scholar of Buddhism, a particularly both- ersome aspect of the book is its treatment of bibliographic sources. If one wishes to discover whether Kongtrul quotes a particular text, one must first determine what English title the translators have used for it (this is by no means always easy) before searching for it in the Index. In addition, the bibliographic information given for many of the primary sources is incomplete, and in all cases is lacking any reference to the Sanskrit originals. In the main, however, such criticisms do not detract from the value of the book as a whole. Indeed, one can only hope that the translators will continue their work and bring out the other nine books of Kongtrul's momentous treatise. From Chronicle to Canon: The Hermeneutics of the Spring and Autumn, according to Tung Chung-shu. By Sarah A. Queen. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1996. Pp. xiv, 287. Reviewed by Robert Eno, Indiana University Too little attention has been paid to the thought of Tung Chung-shu Jrff- (ca. 195-105 B.C.E.), the most influential Confucian of the Han period (202 B.C.E.-A.D. 220). Tung, who was instrumental in persuading the Han to establish Confucianism as state ideology, has been cast as a syncretic ideologue rather than an original thinker, and standard accounts of his thought feature the patchwork system of yin- yang and five phases (wu-hsing Jifj) cosmology that Tung is said to have grafted onto Confucian political ethics in order to attract imperial patronage. Tung's pro- motional success is often pictured as vitiating the philosophical authenticity of Confucianism in favor of a bricolage of popular superstition that ultimately rendered Han Confucianism sterile. Sarah Queen, in From Chronicle to Canon: The Hermeneutics of the Spring and Autumn, according to Tung Chung-shu, sets out to revise this story by arguing that the core of Tung's thought lay not in cosmology but in the political application of canon exegesis. Through close analysis of a text traditionally viewed as Tung's col- lected essays, the Ch'un-ch'iu fan-lu #jPkX (Luxuriant gems of the Spring and Autumn chronicle), and of other writings attributed to him, Queen offers a new and philosophically provocative portrait of Tung. The first half of Queen's book is devoted to a revised biography of Tung and issues of textual authenticity and chronology. Queen uses memorials and omeno- logical writings attributed to Tung in Han histories and elsewhere as a baseline to assess the authenticity of the heterogeneous chapters of the Ch'un-ch'iu fan-lu, a text 212 Philosophy East &amp; West Volume 49, Number 2 April 1999 212-214 ? 1999 by University of Hawai'i</page><page sequence="2">that reached its current form only centuries after Tung's death. Her detailed technical analysis portrays the Ch'un-ch'iu fan-lu as bringing together several elements of Tung's authentic teachings: exegeses of the Ch'un-ch'iu (the Spring and Autumn chronicle) from the perspective of the Kung-yang ?T interpretive school, of which Tung was a formative leader; essays in the vein of Huang-Lao j__ thought, which Queen sees as evidence of non-Confucian influences on Tung during his youth; and cosmological chapters featuring yin-yang theory. However, Queen convincingly demonstrates that chapters devoted to five-phases cosmology are later additions, with no connection to Tung's own doctrines, and that Tung did not employ the five phases meaningfully in his thought. In the latter portion of her book, Queen examines Tung's ideas about the can- onicity of the Ch'un-ch'iu, the content and impact on the Han of Tung's legal phi- losophy, the influence of Tung's ritual doctrines, and Tung's role in the establish- ment of Confucianism. Queen establishes the primacy of Ch'un-ch'iu scholarship throughout Tung's teachings. It is difficult today to understand how scholars could regard this dry chronicle as a font of wisdom, but Queen conveys the attractive force of Han beliefs that Confucius had esoterically altered the original text so as to inscribe in it ethical judgments invisible to the hermeneutically uninitiated. From the exegetical chapters of the Ch'un-ch'iu fan-lu, Queen extracts the key notion that for Tung the Ch'un- ch'iu taught that moral responsibility is principally a function of the intentions rather than the acts of individuals, and this interpretive point becomes the pivot of an illu- minating analysis of Tung's practical jurisprudence. Holding that Tung wished to establish motive as a key determinant of criminal responsibility in order to mitigate the harshness of the Legalist penal codes that the Han dynasty inherited from the Ch'in, Queen illustrates how Tung employed Ch'un-ch'iu interpretation in practical arguments of this legal adjudication, and maintains that his approach profoundly influenced Han jurisprudence. Queen also links Tung's ritual prescripts to Ch'un-ch'iu exegesis, correlating Tung's claim that simple reverence should prevail over ceremonial formality in ritual with his belief that the Ch'un-ch'iu judges by motive more than by deed. The implications of these ideas led Tung to advocate simplification of Han religious practice, with increased devotions to the single high deity, Heaven (T'ien T), rather .than to the myriad lesser gods worshipped in Ch'in-Han imperial rites. Finally, in discussing Tung's role in the establishment of Confucianism, Queen portrays Tung's thought as pragmatically evolving, adapting Huang-Lao ideas to Confucian needs by granting primacy to yang over yin (not a sexist notion, but one designed to privilege mercy over harsh penal codes), by exalting the role of a semi- anthropomorphic Heaven to control the autonomy of the ruler, and by portraying the Confucian canon as orthodox wisdom, thus removing ultimate moral authority from the ruler to Confucian exegetes. Queen's book enriches scholarship on Han thought and the philosophical sig- nificance of classicism. Its strongest features are its textual analysis, its grasp of the nature of canon formation, and its articulation of Kung-yang jurisprudence. How- Book Reviews 213</page><page sequence="3">ever, the evidence of Tung's influence on Han legal thought does not appear as broad as Queen maintains, nor do Tung's ideas seem a definitive break with Ch'in law, which, contrary to anti-Legalist caricatures, did attend to issues of intent and other mitigating factors, as indicated by archaeologically recovered Ch'in codes. It may also be that in claiming substantial influence of Ch'un-ch'iu exegesis on Han ritual disputes, Queen somewhat magnifies the significance of brief citations of canonical text. Specialists will regret that Queen was unable to read and respond to Gary Arbuckle's 1991 doctoral dissertation on Tung, which is the only other study of Tung's thought in English of sophistication comparable to Queen's. Arbuckle's work reinforces Queen's conclusions concerning the absence of five-phases cosmology from Tung's teaching. In specific analyses of Tung's ideas, however, there are sig- nificant differences of focus, and widely different views on the composition and pertinence of the Ch'un-ch'iu fan-lu. Queen notes that she will soon publish a study and full translation of the Ch'un-ch'iu fan-lu, and this should provide a welcome opportunity for her to expand the emerging and long-needed dialogue on Tung Chung-shu's place in China's philosophical history. The Golden Rule. By Jeffrey Wattles. New York and Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1996. Pp. viii + 257. Reviewed by Peimin Ni, Grand Valley State University At the Second Centennial celebration of the Parliament of the World's Religions in Chicago in 1993, the Parliament's Council issued a "Declaration of a Global Ethic" in which it presented a statement of the Golden Rule: "We must treat others as we wish others to treat us." The Golden Rule has, in fact, been advocated in various versions by most of the world's religions for a very long time-and yet people have long found it difficult to interpret. Jeffrey Wattles, in his book The Golden Rule, has effectively summarized the problem: the Rule has been accused of not telling us what we should wish for, for making ordinary wants and desires the criteria of mo- rality, for assuming that all human beings are alike and that what we want for our- selves is good for others as well, and so on. Unlike some analytical philosophers who try to reformulate the Golden Rule in order to avoid these problems, Wattles' approach is to "retain it as commonly worded, while taking advantage of objections to clarify its proper interpretation" (p. 8). He feels that the true spirit of the Golden Rule is beyond what a simple for- mulation can express in words. The analytical approach gains clarity only at the cost of spiritual and even moral impoverishment (p. 122). Wattles is more interested in the life of the Rule-how it moves, how its various meanings weave into one another, and how working with it promotes growth (p. 181). 214 Philosophy East &amp; West Volume 49, Number 2 April 1999 214-215 ? 1999 by University of Hawai'i</page></plain_text>
