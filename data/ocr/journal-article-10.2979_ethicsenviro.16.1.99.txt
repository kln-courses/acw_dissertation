Motivated by a strong  desire to get close to a dolphin, many people seek out opportunities to  “swim with dolphins,” but what is the nature of these programs and how  are they actually experienced by participants? If people are seeking genu- ine contact with a dolphin, does context make a significant difference?  Moreover, can and do swim-with-dolphin programs afford ethical ways  of interacting with dolphins? These questions are addressed through ex- amining three representative swim-with-dolphin programs. Comparative  analysis further illustrates how place is vital to engagements of interspe- cies etiquette. The places where humans meet other animals matter. This is espe- cially true when considering encounters with animals in captivity. Myriad  factors come into play in these instances, not the least of which involve  the physical structures of each place and the kinds of organized activities  that are offered, encouraged or discouraged there.

If people are seeking genuine, spontaneous contact with  a dolphin, does the place and activity of encounter make a significant  difference in the experience? Moreover, can and do swim-with-dolphin  programs offer ethical ways of interacting with dolphins, and what might  that entail?  Situated in the liminal spaces where marine and terrestrial worlds  come together to form swim-with-dolphin programs, this paper exam- ines impacts of place upon human-dolphin interactions. I conducted field- work at a deliberate range of swim-with-dolphin sites, each chosen on the  basis of: the arrangement of physical space, from open ocean to beach  to enclosed lagoon to concrete pool; the relative amount of independ- ence and freedom afforded to the dolphins; and, the types of activities  offered and their degree of structure. For instance, at Dolphins Plus in  Key Largo, Florida, I swam fairly freely with captive dolphins in an en- closed square cement pool filled with fresh seawater, while at Discovery  Cove in Orlando, I participated in a comprehensive Trainer for a Day  program, which included highly controlled encounters with dolphins in  a chlorinated pool designed to look like a tropical lagoon. By contrast,  in Rockingham, Western Australia, I joined a boat excursion and swam  with free-living dolphins in the open waters of Rockingham Bay. Each of  these places offered unique opportunities for interacting with dolphins,  and varied significantly in terms of enabling the kinds of mutual and vol- untary engagements necessary for ethical interactions. CAPTIVE CONSUMPTION With very few exceptions, human participants typically do not swim  with dolphins in swim-with-dolphin programs.1 It is quite a misnomer. In- stead, human participants strike a series of poses in shallow or deep water,  as the dolphin responds to the requests of the trainer to perform routine  poses and movements of their own. From my experiences participating  in and witnessing a variety of swim-with-dolphin programs, much of the  time was spent waiting for my turn among a group of four to eight other  participants.2 When called upon, I stepped up, did what I was told, like  “kiss the dolphin,” waited as my photo was taken and stepped back to let  the next person go. It felt like being on a kind of conveyor belt and going  through the motions as per an intended script.3 I was told exactly where to  100 ETHICS &amp; THE ENVIRONMENT, 16(1) 2011 </page> <page sequence="3"> stand, when and precisely how to perform actions, much like the practice  of blocking used in acting. And like the purpose of hitting your mark, the  precision of the swim interaction was mainly to ensure that the perfect  photo was taken of each pose by the professional photographers on hand.  The dolphin encounter felt like a staged photo shoot much of the time. The scripting and blocking of the swim programs correspond with the  construction of an idealized, generic tourist experience and the produc- tion and consumption of souvenirs. Indeed, multiple acts of consumption  occur in various ways at the sites of human-dolphin encounter investi- gated in this study. They largely involved the objectification of the dol- phins through the commodification of their bodies (Davis 1997; Desmond  1999) as they performed in shows and interactive programs for a paying  public. Generally, tourists consume experiences, mainly the experience of  getting close to and sometimes touching and feeding the dolphins, pur- chasing intimacy with dolphins via fish. Perhaps the most common form  of consuming dolphin bodies is through photography (Desmond 1999).  All of the captive swim-with-dolphin sites I visited had professional pho- tographers shooting video and taking pictures that could be viewed on  monitors and purchased. Intriguingly, photographic images can serve as more than just me- mentos of tourist experiences; they actively produce experience by visu- ally presenting ideal moments that visitors can then try to re-create for  themselves. The images are key to the production of commodified experi- ences at each facility because they show the consumer exactly what they  can expect (which is most often conveyed through television commercials,  advertising on the internet, tourist pamphlets and billboards) and later  provide a visual confirmation that these expectations were indeed met  in the form of a personalized souvenir to take home. Commenting on  these fascinating rituals in tourism, H. Peter Steeves states that, “a culture  that consumes experience has turned it into a thing,” which he suggests  “ushers in a rather strange parallel between tourism and phenomenology”  (2000, 164).  He explains that “both involve a shift in attention; both move from  the world to our way of taking up the world, from experience to the ex- perience of experience” (Steeves 2000, 164). His observation captures the  somewhat paradoxical and multidimensional experience of tourist activi- ties, such as a visit to Sea World, which is simultaneously and perceptually  traci warkEntin INTERSpECIES ETIquETTE IN plaCE 101 </page> <page sequence="4"> authentic, artificial, presented, represented, produced, reproduced, objec- tified, scripted, spontaneous and predetermined. What is more, the staged  predictability of the experience does not seem to diminish the average  visitor’s immediate enjoyment; rather, it appears to confirm for the tourist  that they are indeed having the wonderful and memorable experience they  had anticipated. As such, experiential acts of (re)creating and consuming  the promotional images correspond with an internalization of the ideals  and assumptions underlying them, an acting out of the expectations of the  experience—what is going to happen, what is supposed to happen—and  of the kinds of end products that are appropriate to capture the moment  and be taken away afterward. Beyond these overtly commercial modes of consumption, and the ob- vious commodification of whale and dolphin bodies, lay subtler appeals  to the selling of more ephemeral, emotional aspects of the interactive and  visual experiences. There are diverse and often conflicting dimensions of  emotion involved in dolphin-human interactions, such as joy, happiness,  and excitement. These can be mixed, for some, with sadness and guilt  about captivity. Despite or perhaps because of this ambiguity, there ap- pears to be a very common desire to get up close and personal with dol- phins and other whales, and many people are willing and able to spend  large amounts of money for the privilege of ever-greater intimacy. Tangled  with the emotions we bring to the experience are the emotive and organ- izing effects, or, rather, affects, of the space itself. This can be described  as the phenomenal experience of interacting with dolphins, how it feels,  how being in the space influences how we—humans and dolphins—be- have and move our bodies in response to one another. Such is the sense of  place I strive to articulate through describing my participation in swim- with-dolphin programs in this paper. I concentrate on the more external  elements of scripting as they affected, structured, and organized my expe- riences and ability to engage in ethical ways of interacting, via interspecies  etiquette (Cheney and Weston 1999, Warkentin 2010), in the swim-with- dolphins programs.  CONTEXTUALIZING INTERSPECIES ETIQUETTE Put succinctly, interspecies etiquette can be expressed through one’s  body and actions, or, in some cases, inactions. Each individual’s ability to  choose whether or not to interact is ethically imperative. It involves a con- 102 ETHICS &amp; THE ENVIRONMENT, 16(1) 2011 </page> <page sequence="5"> scious and deliberate bearing of openness to others while creating space  for either engagement or avoidance (Behnke 1999; Cheney 1998; Cheney  and Weston 1999, 126; Plumwood 2002, 175–76; Weston 2004, 32). A  keen awareness of one’s own body is needed, along with deft sensitivity to  the bodies of others. In practice, this requires both an immediate, visceral  attentiveness and an exercise of empathic imagination to approximate  the perspective of another. Practical phenomenologists Kenneth Shapiro,  Thomas Csordas and Elizabeth Behnke have each developed methods for  applying these practices in real world situations, and they have fundamen- tally shaped my development of this praxis of embodying invitation and  choice, and enabling reciprocity and mutual interest in interspecies inter- actions (see Warkentin 2010). In further fleshing out interspecies etiquette  as it is affected by place, the addition of Lori Gruen’s (2009) recent work  on “engaged empathy” is particularly nourishing. Quite unlike an appeal for sympathy, engaged empathy “involves a  transfer of affect, and eventually, a cognitive engagement with the perspec- tive of the “object” of empathy” (2009, 27). So defined, engaged empathy  provides a basis for moral perception (Gruen 2009, 25), through which  humans perceive other animals as morally considerable and are motivated  to interact accordingly with deliberate care. Gruen calls this “cognitive  empathy,” in which “the empathizer is not merely mimicking or projecting  onto the emotions of the object of empathy, but is engaged in a reflective  act of imagination that puts her into the object’s situation and/or frame of  mind” (2009, 28-9). As a result, engaged empathy can both inform us of  what is the right thing to do and motivate us to actually do it.4  Resonating strongly with Shapiro’s (1985, 1990, 1997) “kinesthetic  empathy,” Csordas’ (1993) “somatic modes of attention,” and Behnke’s  (1997) “interkinaesthetic comportment,” Gruen’s engaged empathy is  distinctly not mere contagion of mood, anthropomorphic projection, or  assumption of feeling, but a tacitly informed approximation of what the  other is experiencing.5 It involves using judgment and assessing the full  situation (Gruen 2009, 29). Elaborating, Gruen explains that “these judg- ments will involve assessing the salient features of the situation and require  that the empathizer seek to determine what information is pertinent to ef- fectively empathize with the being in question [emphasis added]” (Gruen  2009, 30). Such an assessment involves simultaneous visceral and cogni- tive awareness of a particular place, at a particular time, while engaging  traci warkEntin INTERSpECIES ETIquETTE IN plaCE 103 </page> <page sequence="6"> in interspecies etiquette. Interactions do not take place in a vacuum; they  are always context-specific.  Thus, vital to practicing interspecies etiquette in place is an added  understanding of the perceptual abilities of an other, how that individual  senses and makes sense of the world. Taking into account the specific con- text of the other in these terms, however, is no simple task, particularly  across species. Fortunately, assistance is offered by the field of ecological  psychology in the form of a notion of affordances. It draws our attention  to the unique worlds of others and provides clues to how we might engage  with them in ethical ways by providing an approach for understanding  how their immediate environments appear to them and what kinds of op- portunities are present. SENSING PLACE AND ETHICAL AFFORDANCES The places where we meet dolphins are made up of countless sensory  cues. Simultaneously, we may perceive the briney smell of seawater or  acrid fumes of chlorine, bright flashes of sunshine reflecting off the play  of waves, medleys of clicks, squeaks and whistles, rough surfaces of con- crete, smooth surfaces of glass. Smells, sights, sounds, flavors, and textures  abound far in excess of what we can attend to at any given moment. In  large part, the way any individual organism perceives and so experiences  their environment is shaped by the physical and physiological make-up  of that organism’s body. Each being has particular sensory capabilities  for detecting the parts of their world that have significance and for inter- acting with them in meaningful ways. For example, humans, being ter- restrial mammals, rely predominantly on sight to navigate and perceive  opportunities and dangers. By contrast, marine mammals, whose vision is  often obscured in dark, turbid waters, largely use sound to sense their sur- roundings (Hughes 1999, Moore 1998). Known as echolocation, toothed  whales, including dolphins, orcas and belugas, send out pulses of sound  into the environment, which then bounce off other beings and material  forms and return to create an acoustic image of that environment. In rela- tive degrees, both dolphins and humans also employ their senses of smell,  touch, and taste to explore and interact with their environments. Through  all of these sensory capabilities, dolphins and humans can perceive oppor- tunities for action in their immediate surroundings, such as food to obtain  or obstacles to avoid. Such opportunities for action are what ecological  104 ETHICS &amp; THE ENVIRONMENT, 16(1) 2011 </page> <page sequence="7"> psychologists’ James J. Gibson (1979) and Edward Reed (1988, 1996) call  “affordances.”  Affordances are resources, in the fullest sense, one perceives in an  environment. Their meaning is ephemeral and yet somewhat durable as  affordances are always present in the shared environment of many be- ings and come into specific instances of being in and through the busi- ness of living and interacting (Gibson 1979, Grene 1965, Reed 1988,  1996, Warkentin 2009). Although they are described as opportunities, af- fordances are not always favorable courses of action. In certain situations,  some can inhibit action and others may need to be proactively avoided.  Furthermore, indicating their potential as shared or intersecting resources,  Edward Reed has developed notions of mutual affordances (Reed 1996)  between beings and social affordances of propriety, in which one tempers  their behavior in accordance with “the perceived need to present proper  affordances to the other” (Reed 1988, 121). Propriety here also requires  refraining from presenting inappropriate affordances. Affordances, so de- fined, arise in dolphin facilities and swim-with-dolphin programs in ways  that can present opportunities for various kinds of interactions, between  humans, dolphins and the physical space. And, we can recognize opportu- nities for interactions that embody the qualities of interspecies etiquette in  the form of “ethical affordances.” Ethical affordances are thus opportunities for invitation, choice, reci- procity, and mutual interest in human-dolphin interactions. These are dif- ficult, sometimes impossible, to find in captivity, so ideally interactions  would occur between free-living dolphins and humans, although these  are also fraught with the potential for harm and exploitation. As we shall  see, however, there are degrees of invitation that can be extended even in  restricted contexts. There can be opportunities for engaging dolphins and  humans in ways that interest them both, such as through play and music.  So let us now turn to actual places of encounter and specific swim-with- dolphin programs in order to examine the nature of the experience and  whether and how they offer opportunities for interspecies etiquette in the  form of these ethical affordances. traci warkEntin INTERSpECIES ETIquETTE IN plaCE 105 </page> <page sequence="8"> (RE)CREATING PICTURE PERFECT EXPERIENCES AT  DISCOVERY COVE Located just across the road from Sea World, Orlando, and oper- ated by the same Busch Entertainment Corporation, Discovery Cove is  a luxurious and elite facility, open only to people willing and able to pay  upwards of four hundred US dollars per person for access to all that it  offers. I participated in the Trainer for a Day (TFAD) program, which ena- bled exclusive privileges for interacting with dolphins, stingrays, sharks,  birds, and many more individual animals, as well as behind-the-scenes  activities. At that time, Discovery Cove employed ninety-nine trainers and  housed thirty-five Atlantic bottlenose dolphins. The facility consists of an  extensive series of interconnecting cement pools, built to resemble tropical  lagoons with white-sand beaches, swaying palm trees, and lush foliage. It  is entirely human made. The first dolphin interaction of the TFAD program was with Rascal, a  young male bottlenose dolphin. Before the activity, I had asked my guide  if there was a particular way I should approach Rascal? I was told, “Well,  you don’t want to put your hands in the dolphin’s face. You should only  touch them behind the blowhole.” This seemed like common sense and  made me pause to realize that some people may not know this most basic  of etiquette for interacting with any animal others. I was sorted into a  group with nine other participants and we entered the main pool, which  appeared wide but turned out to be relatively small, much smaller and  more shallow than I had expected after having watched the promotional  video clips on the Discovery Cove website. We were notified that each  group would have two trainers, one female and one male, as well as a  dedicated photographer and videographer, standing in the water nearby. We walked into the clear blue water, which was waist deep for me,  and were asked to squat down so that our faces were almost level with  Rascal’s. That way, we were told, we would not tower over him and he  would be more comfortable. As I lowered my body, I inhaled the sharp  smell of chlorine and felt a rush of cool water fill my wetsuit. The air was  quite chilly that day, but the sun was bright and warm on my face. We  were asked to keep our hands in front of us and tight to our bodies and  not to reach out until Rascal’s head and blowhole had passed by. We were  allowed to stroke the top and side of his body from behind the blowhole  to his tail as he swam by us, back and forth, several times. 106 ETHICS &amp; THE ENVIRONMENT, 16(1) 2011 </page> <page sequence="9"> Throughout the interaction, the trainers tended to phrase questions  and speak in a tone as if we were all children (we were a group of eight  adults and one child): “Now, can anyone tell me what Rascal feels like?”  “Rubber!” I shouted. “That’s right, very good.” There was a lot going on  around us in the pool; the air was filled with similar tones and questions  posed to other groups, with ‘oohs’ and ‘ahhhs,’ trainers’ whistles, splashes,  and laughter. At one point, the male trainer pointed out a mother and calf  near the back of the pool working only with trainers. He told us that they  try to get the calves used to human interactions really soon after they are  born. Disappointingly, I found there was very little opportunity to directly  interact with Rascal. The closest opportunity came when I was invited  to approach him by myself to give him a kiss, but even then I was given  detailed instructions by the trainers throughout the whole activity: “Cup  your hands and place them just above the water, that’s right, now he puts  his rostrum into your hands, raise his head up a little and kiss the bot- tom of his rostrum, not the top because if he opens his mouth you’ll be  bonked, remember to hold the kiss for a minute so your picture can be  taken, savor the moment, now you can stroke his back, from behind his  blowhole, that’s right.” The trainer was beside me the whole time. She told  me to look up for a photo, and then turn to look at Rascal for another  photo, and so on. I kept trying to focus on Rascal, on my presence and  actions, to be fully attentive to him, but my attention kept getting drawn  back to the trainer and the cameras. I tried talking directly to him a little,  but was feeling self-conscious. The photographers were just a few feet  away, and I felt the weight of the cameras and everyone else’s eyes upon  me the whole time. I soon heard “Now back away please, next person  come on up.” The moment was over quickly. After my turn with Rascal, I asked the female trainer how she com- municates with him. Did she use gesture? She answered that yes, it was all  hand and body cues, and she illustrated with exaggerated hand gestures.  I asked if she really pays attention to Rascal’s gestures and body move- ments. I asked if she is typically able to tell Rascal’s moods. She said that  was basically her main job, to come out in the morning and watch his  behavior, to watch his body movements and try to sense how he is feeling  and if he is going to cooperate that day. I asked if the dolphins have re- ally individual personalities that she can tell apart. She answered, “Yes.” I  traci warkEntin INTERSpECIES ETIquETTE IN plaCE 107 </page> <page sequence="10"> asked if the dolphins have ever surprised her, doing something totally un- expected. She said, “Yes, it happens.” She gave increasingly short answers  to my stream of questions and it soon became obvious that my questions  were somehow disrupting the orchestration of the program.  The session ended with each of us, in turn, being pulled through the  water by Rascal. I was asked to swim out to the male trainer, who was  about twelve feet away in the deeper water. Once there, I treaded water  and was given instructions to hold on to the base of Rascal’s dorsal fin  (the fin on top of his back), and to relax my body while he pulled me back  to the shallow area of the pool. Rather foolishly, I was concerned about  the effort it might take for Rascal to pull me. It was easy to forget just  how large and powerful he was when only his head was visible above the  water. With apparent ease, Rascal allowed me to hang on to him while he  dragged me through the water.  It took about ten seconds and was very awkward, both in the way I  felt about it and in the way it felt between our bodies. I tried to just hang  on and relax but quickly realized that I had to hold my legs away from  Rascal’s body to avoid getting in the way and being whacked by the pump- ing of his powerful tail. I still do not understand how this kind of activity,  ‘being pulled through the water by a dolphin,’ constitutes ‘swimming with  a dolphin’? It felt contrived and more like a ride at a theme park, like a  roller coaster where you just hang on and enjoy the ride, than an actual  interaction with an individual dolphin. Immediately following the inter- action with Rascal, the human participants in my group were guided up  to the photo hut to view the pictures taken of our session on computers.  There were a variety of purchasing options, from single photos to whole  cds. I ordered a 5x7 photograph of Rascal and I for US$15.99 and a video  of the session for US$59.99 as part of my data collection. Later that day we were treated to a ride with two dolphins, Capricorn  and Joe. This time, in addition to hanging on to the base of their dorsal  fins, I was instructed to arch my back, keep my legs straight behind me  and cross my ankles. I did this as Joe and Capricorn started to swim,  but I could still feel their tails whacking into my shins and ankles. The  ride lasted a few seconds, even shorter than my ride with Rascal. I closed  my eyes tight for most of it because of the water rushing into my face  and up my nose. The sensation was of their hard, energetic bodies, their  tails pumping fast on either side of me. It was awkward and unpleasant.  108 ETHICS &amp; THE ENVIRONMENT, 16(1) 2011 </page> <page sequence="11"> I arrived at the awaiting trainers with a large gush of water as the two  dolphins stopped and then veered off on either side of me. I was feeling  embarrassed and self-conscious, pretending to have liked this ride.  The male trainer shouted ‘How was that, was it GREAT!?’ and handed  me a couple of fish to give to Capricorn before I could answer. I took the  fish, turned to Capricorn, tossed them into his mouth and said loudly  “Thank you, Capricorn.” I did the same for Joe, really trying to embody a  thank you to them for lending their bodies to this perplexing activity.6 On the whole, the Trainer for a Day program at Discovery Cove was  perfectly executed, from start to finish, to produce a memorable tourist  experience. And, like any well-planned business, our program conven- iently concluded with our arrival at the gift shop. Every moment of the  experience was scripted and tightly controlled to reproduce the fun I was  promised in the brochure. Subject to the meticulous commands of the  trainers, neither I, nor the dolphins had the opportunity to exercise unme- diated reciprocity or engage spontaneously in mutually interesting ways.  Invitation was practically impossible; Rascal, Capricorn, and Joe had little  choice but to interact, particularly if they were hungry for fish. There was no doubt that at Discovery Cove, emphasis was placed  upon the enjoyment and satisfaction of the human visitors. However, I  found that this attitude was not true for all of the swim-with-dolphin pro- grams I participated in, nor was it always the main purpose for the script- ing and control which were exercised. The Rockingham Dolphin Swim in  Australia expressed a significantly different attitude towards bottlenose  dolphins and regarding appropriate human-dolphin interactions, which  enabled certain ethical affordances to emerge. MEETING HALF-WAY IN ROCKINGHAM BAY The only non-captive swim-with-dolphins program that I participated  in was in Western Australia. The Rockingham Dolphin Swim was quite  unique in its approach to interacting with free-living bottlenose dolphins  in the bay at Rockingham, located about an hour’s drive from the capi- tal city of Perth. The bay was far from scenic; the shoreline was dotted  with factories and smoke stacks, evidence of the industrial activities that  dominate the area. Thirty participants, including myself, boarded the boat  for the Rockingham Dolphin Swim, which was staffed by nine men and  one woman. We were given detailed instructions on what to do and what  traci warkEntin INTERSpECIES ETIquETTE IN plaCE 109 </page> <page sequence="12"> not to do during the swim. Touching and reaching out to a dolphin was  strictly forbidden. We were told exactly how to hold our bodies while in  the water and that we would not actually be swimming. They had devised  an elaborate method for large numbers of humans to be in the water  during interactive swims in the ocean that was orderly and efficient and  primarily devised for the consideration and interests of the dolphins.  We were divided into six groups of five and given distinctively colored  belts to identify one from another. Each group was then designated a staff  member as their leader, who was equipped with a small motor for jet pro- pulsion. Staggering our entry into the water from the back of the boat, we  got into formation one just behind the other, making a line, and grabbed  onto the belt of the person directly in front with one hand. We were told  to keep our right arm pressed to our side at all times and not to kick our  feet as our human chain would be pulled along the surface of the water  by our motorized leader.  To participate in this program, I was challenged to overcome my fear  of deep, open water, and had to force myself to hop off the boat when my  turn came. I focused on getting in the proper formation to distract myself  from my apprehension and from the shock of the cold, salty water. It was  a bit clumsy at first, I was hit in the face by feet a few times, but my dis- comfort was soon forgotten when I put my head down into the water and  caught a glimpse of several bottlenose dolphins swimming in the murky  water right beneath me. My first thought was “wow, they’re big!” My sec- ond was that they were free-living dolphins and were voluntarily interact- ing with us, and I swelled with elation at the honor of their nearness. I can only imagine how strange we must have appeared to the dol- phins, and assume their curiosity (or amusement) was partly why they  came near us. There was a more alluring element, though. The Rocking- ham Dolphin Swim employed one person specifically to play underwater  with the bottlenose dolphins, while the rest of us were towed around at  the surface. This staff member was equipped with a motor and used it to  perform all kinds of acrobatics underwater and to swim around and play  with the dolphins who came near. Throughout the experience I was impressed by the explicit respect for  dolphin autonomy and the prioritization of their welfare by the staff of  the Rockingham Dolphin Swim. They had a strict policy not to use fish  to entice the dolphins to come near, and instead made an effort to engage  110 ETHICS &amp; THE ENVIRONMENT, 16(1) 2011 </page> <page sequence="13"> them with play. I observed that no food was involved at any time during  the entire outing. They also demonstrated consideration by limiting the  time we spent with each group of dolphins, so as not to take advantage of  their willingness to engage, or to risk pestering them with too much atten- tion. Studies have indeed shown that even the mere presence of boats can  impact the behavior of free-living dolphins (Constantine 1999, 16; Con- stantine et al. 2004), and marine biologists suspect that the longer the time  spent with the dolphins the greater the impact upon their normal routines  of feeding, socializing, resting, and traveling (Constantine 1999, 22). They  advise tour operators to err on the side of caution, as despite more than  decade of research devoted to the impacts of whale-watching and swim- with-dolphin programs, “very little is known about the short- or long-term  effects of tourism on cetacean behavior” (Constantine 1999, 299).  What leading scholar Rochelle Constantine has found, however,  through her research on bottlenose dolphins and common dolphins in the  Bay of Islands, New Zealand, is that free-living dolphins are more likely  to swim with humans if they are given a choice. According to her observa- tions of hundreds of swim attempts from boat tours, “if swimmers enter  the water off to the side, dolphins can choose to come near the swimmers  or not. The avoidance rate in this case is only 21 percent for common dol- phins and 2 percent for bottlenose dolphins” (Constantine and Yin 2003,  259). Conversely, the dolphins show a tendency to avoid humans if that  choice is not presented (Constantine and Yin 2003, 259):  ...if swimmers enter the water in the dolphins’ path of travel, no mat- ter how slow the dolphins are moving they will almost always change  direction and avoid swimmers. For common dolphins this happens  86 percent of the time, and for bottlenose dolphins 77 percent of the  time. (Constantine and Yin 2003, 259) Notably, Constantine also points out “the risk for the humans in giv- ing the dolphins a choice is that the dolphins do not always choose to  interact,” citing her findings that “when given the choice, bottlenose dol- phins will approach swimmers 34 percent of the time; the rest of the time  they will continue to engage in the activity prior to the swimmers’ enter- ing the water” (Constantine and Yin 2003, 259). Her findings illuminate the pragmatism of the procedures employed  by the Rockingham Dolphin Swim. Their method for keeping our human  bodies controlled and as unobtrusive as possible demonstrated a serious  traci warkEntin INTERSpECIES ETIquETTE IN plaCE 111 </page> <page sequence="14"> respect for the dolphins’ autonomy and a keen awareness of their agency,  particularly their ability to choose not to come near us. Our embodied  actions necessarily communicated considerations of dolphins’ desires and  aversions and their power to assert them in these relations. The dolphins  living in Rockingham Bay could have at any time lost interest or, for any  reason, chosen not to engage with us. In fact, Constantine has documented  aversion behaviors and “significant avoidance” by dolphins who have  repeatedly come into contact with boat tours and swimmers who have  chased, jumped on, and otherwise harassed them (Constantine and Yin  2003, 260). She notes that successful commercial operators “constantly  modify their behavior to minimize their impact on the dolphins” since  “their livelihood depends on this sensitivity” (Constantine and Yin 2003,  260). Interspecies etiquette in some cases, then, may be more a matter of  practical necessity than anything else.  Nonetheless, the Rockingham Dolphin Swim had demonstrated and  enforced respectful, voluntary engagement with the dolphins living in the  bay and sincerely attempted to minimize the impacts of the interactions.  It exemplifies how scientific knowledge and environmental ethics are vital  to responsible tourism operations involving free-living animals, and how  in situ tourism activities can contribute to ecological conservation if they  are done well.7 By refraining from using fish to draw the dolphins near,  for instance, the Rockingham Dolphin Swim did not directly disrupt the  ecological role the bottlenose dolphins perform as top predators in the  food web of the bay. Moreover, the tour company contributes to employ- ment and the local economy of Rockingham, providing an incentive for  residents and other business owners to protect the dolphins and the bay.  Thus, it is in everyone’s interest for the Rockingham Dolphin Swim to  behave responsibly and ethically toward the dolphins to ensure their con- tinued participation. Still, I was left wondering, if dolphins had no real choice in the matter,  that is, if they were in captivity, would the same considerations of respect  and autonomy be exercised? Unfortunately, I found only one example  of similar practices and considerations in the captive swim programs.8  The “natural swim” experience at Dolphins Plus was the only captive  swim program to come close to affording a comparable kind of dolphin  etiquette.  112 ETHICS &amp; THE ENVIRONMENT, 16(1) 2011 </page> <page sequence="15"> SCRIPTING FOR DOLPHIN ETIQUETTE AT DOLPHINS PLUS? Located in Key Largo, Florida, Dolphins Plus is a very small facility  made up of square cement pools separated by chain-link fencing. It was  the most plain of all the sites I visited, deprived of aesthetic considerations  regarding the shape and size of the pools, the nature of the materials, and  landscaping or lack thereof. Fourteen bottlenose dolphins were living at  Dolphins Plus, six of whom had originally been captured in the Atlan- tic Ocean somewhere between Sarasota and Tampa, Florida, and eight  of whom were born in captivity elsewhere. The facility opened in 1979.  At the time, no other aquariums would sell already captive dolphins to  the owners because they wanted to start a swim-with-dolphins program,  which was generally thought to be too dangerous for both people and  dolphins. They were not dissuaded, though, and in 1980 Dolphins Plus  began offering the “natural swim” program. They currently also include  “structured swims” with bottlenose dolphins, dolphin-assisted therapy, as  well as encounter programs with California sea lions.9 A friendly, down-to-earth young man led our natural swim and began  with a thorough and candid orientation session. We were told details about  how and what the dolphins were fed (capelin, smelt, and herring mainly)  and how important the variety is to their physical and mental health, in  that he thought the variety might make the food less boring. We learned  that bottlenose dolphins, like other marine mammals, get all of their fresh  water from the fish they eat, so they must eat the fish whole; if the fish’s  body breaks, the fresh water leaks out and salt water gets in. We were told  how a dolphin must eat a fish head first so that the outer scales and spiky  tail flukes would not scratch their throats, and how their tongues can seal  off the throat and then push water out and suck down the fish at the same  time to avoid drinking any salt water.  Most importantly, we learned about the rules regarding our bodies  and actions during the swim: to always keep our hands by our sides and  to never try to touch the dolphins. He emphasized and explained this rule  through an analogy, asking us to imagine ourselves walking down a street  and being approached by a stranger who then introduces themselves with  their hand outstretched. At that point we have a choice to engage or po- litely walk away. Either response would be acceptable. “Now,” he said,  “imagine that stranger walking right up and groping, poking, rubbing  your body, how would you like that?” We chorused that we would not  traci warkEntin INTERSpECIES ETIquETTE IN plaCE 113 </page> <page sequence="16"> like that one bit and he said, “Right, so don’t do it to the dolphins!” Most  of the group nodded in agreement, but a couple of minutes later one of the  younger men in our group asked, “So, can we touch them?” We were ex- plicitly, and repeatedly, instructed to hold our arms at our sides or folded  across our backs, and to swim by kicking our legs straight up and down  using our flippers. And, no touching! After the orientation session, we squeezed into our wetsuits, donned  flippers, a mask and snorkel, and our group of seven got in the water for a  thirty minute swim with four bottlenose dolphins: Samantha, Julian, Bob,  and Cosmo. It was in a square cement pool about fifteen feet deep and  the seawater, pumped in from the nearby Atlantic Ocean, was turbid and  green. Visibility was low. The water was a cool 70 degrees Fahrenheit, or  21 degrees Celsius. I wore a half wetsuit and was shivering by the end of  the thirty-minute swim. I felt very buoyant in the salty water and found it  difficult to dive and swim under the surface for long. This contrasted with  the heavy guilt I felt about participating in the program, complicit in the  captivity and employment of these dolphins. Infused with these emotions  was also my anxiety about getting into the water with Samantha, Julian,  Bob, and Cosmo. They were big and strong beings and we would all be  immersed in the same small enclosure.  Once I was in the pool, however, excitement replaced apprehension  and I have to admit that catching a glimpse of them swimming a few feet  away was incredible. They appeared to come so close that I thought we  might bump into each other at some points, but we never did. Most of  the time, they swam by underneath and looked up at me. They were usu- ally swimming too fast for me to keep up and make eye contact, but they  would sometimes slow for a split-second and really look. Only once did  we end up swimming side by side making eye contact for a few seconds  before they accelerated away with a few swift pulses of their tails. It was  exhilarating for me, a feeling of connection, although I can only guess  what meaning, if any, it had for them. During the swim, the staff gave us toys to interest the dolphins and  attract their attention. All seven of us pushed long poles in front of us so  that Cosmo, Bob, Samantha, and Julian could surf the wave we created.  Later on, I was given a large Tupperware lid to push and three of the dol- phins did swim just in front of me a few times. In pairs, we were given an  open wetsuit to stretch between us as we swam, which caught all four of  the dolphins’ interest for a few minutes. Other than the play objects and  114 ETHICS &amp; THE ENVIRONMENT, 16(1) 2011 </page> <page sequence="17"> instructions for using them, there was little mediation from the staff at  Dolphins Plus during our natural swim interactions. They stayed on the  platform beside the pool the whole time, just watching. The only excep- tion occurred near the end of our session when one of the younger men  chased the dolphins and I heard the staff reprimand him for trying to  touch them.  CONCLUSION: AFFORDING DOLPHIN ETIQUETTE Overall, Dolphins Plus was the most institutional looking and non- aesthetically pleasing of all of the swim-with-dolphin sites I visited. There  was no pretense of ecological “naturalness” and a total lack of landscap- ing. It had the usual trappings of tourism, such as the gift shop and pro- fessional videographers, and yet it felt the least commercial of any of the  captive sites. This may in part be due to their not having a show, but there  somehow seemed to be more of an atmosphere of respect for the dolphins  in the programs that they offered, in speech and deed. They appeared  very serious about what they did, and insisted that the dolphins’ needs  and comfort always came first, much like the attitude expressed by the  Rockingham Dolphin Swim. By contrast, at Discovery Cove the human  experience was obviously privileged and stressed as the most important  element to be accommodated at all times: the rules and instructions were  couched and explained in terms of human comfort and safety, the quality  of our vacation experience, and the availability of photo opportunities.  While the embodied etiquette employed in the swims at Rockingham  and Dolphins Plus facilitated respectful and voluntary engagements and  encouraged attentiveness to our own bodies in relation to those of the dol- phins, the structuring and scripting at Discovery Cove worked to dissuade  active attentiveness to the dolphins themselves and restricted spontaneous  bodily engagements between human and dolphin participants. Moreover,  I found that the interactive programs at Discovery Cove were scripted to  strongly direct the emotional responses that participants were supposed  to feel and express. As the trainers actively re-created scenes from the  advertisements, they would prompt human participants for enthusiastic  responses: “How was that, was it GREAT!?” In a way, they were training  the human participants to respond to cues, much like when they would  prompt the dolphins by asking: “Do you like that? Do you want a fish?”  while simultaneously giving the hand gesture for the dolphins to nod their  heads.  traci warkEntin INTERSpECIES ETIquETTE IN plaCE 115 </page> <page sequence="18"> We find, then, that while Dolphins Plus and Discovery Cove shared  similarities as captive facilities, the organization of bodies and the script- ing of movements at the two sites were based upon opposite motivations  and achieved quite different effects in the dolphin-human interactions. We  can say for both that it is clear that captivity greatly diminishes ethical af- fordances. Confined to an enclosed pool and dependent upon humans for  food and other necessities, the dolphins have little choice but to partici- pate in the programs. Regardless of intention, the sincerity of any invita- tion to voluntary interactions in these cases is severely compromised. And  yet, some degrees of ethical affordances may still emerge in subtle ways.  For all of the swim-with-dolphin sites, no physical barriers divided human  and dolphins. This created opportunities for the dolphins to approach the  human participants underwater, even to touch us if they chose, and to use  their echolocation to sense and examine us. Submersion also resulted in  some vulnerability for humans, with our bodies exposed and accessible,  and not as adept in the water.  Despite this, power remained dramatically unequal in captivity due to  enclosure and the presence of the trainers. Trainers held the upper hand as  they held the bucket of fish and represented the dolphins’ sole source of  food, thus compromising any attempts at inviting voluntary interactions  and genuine reciprocity. A key factor of the activities at Discovery Cove is  that they were highly structured by the trainers who gave a verbal play by  play for what was to happen, while at the same time using food as a tool  for directing exactly what the dolphins were supposed to do. The organi- zation of the activity directed the attention of both the humans and dol- phins away from each other and instead encouraged attentiveness to, and  compliance with, the trainer. Neither the facility nor the activities offered  at Discovery Cove afforded opportunities for the humans or the dolphins  to engage in direct, spontaneous kinds of interaction or mutual play. Conversely, the Rockingham Dolphin Swim brought humans out to  where free-living dolphins were, to meet in their unpredictable element.  We entered cold, deep waters for a chance to see them, knowing that they  could easily avoid us, thus embodying a choice to interact voluntarily.  Furthermore, play presented an invitation in meaningful terms for them.  Engaging in playful underwater acrobatics evidently appealed to the dol- phins and attracted their interest in our group. The strict omission of food  from the activity fit the intentions that the offer was invitational rather  116 ETHICS &amp; THE ENVIRONMENT, 16(1) 2011 </page> <page sequence="19"> than coercive. Had they chosen to touch and investigate us, our physical  presence in the ocean afforded the dolphins such opportunities. We were  able to offer our vulnerability and ourselves as objects for the dolphins  to look at. We offered reciprocity for the privilege of seeing the dolphins  by being visible and acoustically available to them at a respectful distance  from which they could use echolocation to check us out. We restricted our  own movements and refrained from reaching out or touching them.  Likewise, Dolphins Plus insisted upon considerations of respect for  the dolphins’ autonomy and right not to be chased or touched. Ethical af- fordances were complicated and compromised, though, by the enclosure  of the pool. While we could invite their interest to interact via play and  strive to give the dolphins space as we swam in circles, confined to the  pool they were never able to avoid us entirely. The lack of food helped  to minimize coercion and the limited involvement of the trainers, who  remained on the sidelines rather than in the water with us, enabled both  humans and dolphins to act spontaneously and more freely. Ultimately, comparative analysis of the three swim-with-dolphin sites  shows that the swim programs were, quite consistently, tightly controlled  and imposed restrictions upon each participant’s comportment and bodily  actions, some through basic rules, some through constant scripting of the  experience. What is most interesting, however, is that the effects of this  were quite different depending upon the context and specific nature of the  program. At Discovery Cove scripting greatly diminished the interactive  quality of the experience, transforming it into a generic and mechani- cal routine. The other two programs, Dolphins Plus and the Rockingham  Dolphin Swim, however, effectively afforded engagements in a kind of in- terspecies etiquette. In these latter two sites, detailed rules about how one  should and should not move their bodies in relation to the dolphins were  concerned more with social considerations for the dolphins than with re- producing a generic tourist experience. Far from presenting solutions to  the complicated issue of whether, where and how humans should meet  dolphins, these examples can nonetheless be looked upon as fledgling at- tempts at ethical interspecies interactions and provide clues to the kinds  of meeting places we might imagine and create with ethical affordances  as our guide. traci warkEntin INTERSpECIES ETIquETTE IN plaCE 117 </page> <page sequence="20"> ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS I would like to express my deepest gratitude to the dolphins who par- ticipated in this study and acknowledge the countless others who endure  with such grace. NOTES  1. The “natural swim” at Dolphins Plus, discussed in this paper, for instance.  2. The fieldwork this paper is based upon was conducted in Florida, USA, and  Western Australia between 2003 and 2006. I conducted participant observa- tions, documented with photos and video footage, of four swim-with-dol- phin programs (Discovery Cove, Orlando, Florida; Dolphins Plus, Key Largo,  Florida; Theatre of the Sea, Islamorada, Florida; Rockingham Dolphin Swim,  Western Australia) and one wade-with-dolphins program (Theatre of the Sea,  Islamorada, Florida). Additional fieldwork was conducted for the broader  research project, which included touch-and-feed dolphin, orca and beluga  encounters at facilities in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada; Niagara  Falls, Ontario, Canada; Orlando, Florida, USA; and Monkey Mia, Western  Australia. They were: Beluga Encounter at Vancouver Aquarium and Marine  Science Centre; Orca touch-and-feed at Friendship Cove and Beluga touch- and-feed at Arctic Cove, both in Marineland, Canada; Dolphin Cove in Sea  World, Orlando; and, Monkey Mia on Shark Bay in Western Australia.  3. To clarify the term, I am using “script” in the sense of the Canadian Oxford  Dictionary’s definition of “a predictable or planned series of statements or  actions” (Bisset, 2000, 929).  4. This bridging of knowledge and action, thought and feeling, is groundbreak- ing in environmental ethics, as she concludes: “engaged empathy thus in- volves both affect and cognition and will necessitate action” (Gruen 2009,  30). Like Gruen, I too am dismayed by the regularity with which “[s]tandard  conceptions of rationality and universality fail to capture the full range and  complexity of our ethical experiences and the full motivational structures  that compel us to “do the right thing” (2009, 25) and am consequently inter- ested in “how empathetic engagement might work in shaping moral percep- tion and informing motivation” (Gruen 2009, 27). Specificity and situated  knowledge, key elements of feminist philosophy and research, are vital to this  project, hence the inclusion of empirical research to provide lived, sensory ac- counts of my participant observations and experiences in this paper. By giving  readers a fuller sense of my experiences as a participant in swim-with-dolphin  programs, through phenomenological and narrative description, I strive to  engage embodied moral imaginations (Warkentin 2002) and inspire multiple  layers of “engaged empathy” (Gruen 2009).  5. Projection is a serious concern, but it can be minimized, even avoided, by  gathering specific information through direct engagement and observation,  118 ETHICS &amp; THE ENVIRONMENT, 16(1) 2011 </page> <page sequence="21"> as well as utilizing secondary sources, to generate knowledge about the in- dividual other. For instance, Shapiro recommends that one’s “sense of the  animal’s experience is critically informed by reflection on (1) social construc- tions, both popular and scientific, that might affect researcher apprehension  and/or the animal’s actual experience and (2) understanding of the history  of the individual(s) under study” (1997, 292). I provide a more detailed ar- gument for how we can avoid and mitigate personal and anthropomorphic  projection in Warkentin 2010.  6. In my Gary-Larson-cartoon-inspired-imagination, Capricorn and Joe were  rolling their eyes, thinking “whatever,” and “here we go again” as they swam  out to receive the next gangly human.  7. In situ here refers to tourism activities that take place where the animal actu- ally lives, in this case, the bottlenose dolphins live in Rockingham Bay and  tourists are taken there to see them. It contrasts with ex situ activities in  which the public encounters an animal who has been removed from their  natural habitat and put in captivity, such as a zoo or aquarium. These terms  apply to conservation strategies, particularly in relation to ecotourism, de- signed to raise awareness and educate the public. For example, the public may  encounter dolphins ex situ at an aquarium and learn about threats to their  marine habitat through signage and narrative, or they can go on a whale- watching tour and actually see them in situ, in their ocean environment and  get a better sense of their lives and the reality of issues that threaten their sur- vival. There are many benefits of in situ activities, ecologically and in terms of  the richness of the human and dolphin experience, including those identified  in this paper. And, arguably, an in situ context will provide for a more pow- erful learning experience and encourage a conservation ethic, but we must  keep in mind that in situ tourism must be conducted responsibly as there  are too many examples of it being done poorly or ignorantly throughout the  world. In short, responsible ecotourism requires an ecological understanding  informed by science and guided by environmental ethics, but there are many  more and complicated factors to be considered, which exceed the scope of  this particular paper. For an in-depth study comparing in situ and ex situ eco- tourism in fostering pro-conservation attitudes, please see Tisdell and Clevo  (2001). For a more general discussion and critique of ecotourism as a tool for  conservation, see Kruger (2005).   8. Please see Note 2.  9. Dolphin-assisted therapy is contentious in its own right, but appears to be  very popular in many parts of the world. For a focused critical analysis of  animal assisted therapy, see Zamir (2006). In conclusion, Zamir finds dol- phin-assisted therapy morally objectionable according to a “liberationist  perspective” in cases where dolphins are confined and/or captive. For a de- scription and inspiring case study of dolphin-assisted therapy, from a human- centred perspective, see McKinney et al. (2001).  traci warkEntin INTERSpECIES ETIquETTE IN plaCE 119 </page> <page sequence="22"> REFERENCES Behnke, Elizabeth. 1999.
