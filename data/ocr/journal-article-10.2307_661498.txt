<plain_text><page sequence="1">PETROGLYPHS NEAR THE DALLES OF THE COLUMBIA RIVER BY WILLIAM DUNCAN STRONG AND W. EGBERT SCHENCK N THE COURSE of an archaeological reconnaisance of the lower Columbia River region carried on during August and September, 1924, a number of interesting rock drawings were found across the river from the town of The Dalles. The survey was carried out by the Department of Anthropology of the Uni- versity of California and was made possible through the generosity of Mr. Henry J. Biddle of Vancouver, Washington. The recon- naisance was made by the authors, assisted by Mr. Biddle, who spent considerable time in the field. While making excavations on the north bank of the Columbia, a high water channel of the river was noted with a type of petroglyph unique in the region, presenting the aspect of an aboriginal natural history gallery. Both the intrusive type of rock carving and the fact that some of the animals depicted were probably never common in this immediate area seem to make the find worthy of record. The photographs here reproduced were made by Mr. B. C. Markham, a photographer at The Dalles, who visited the site with us and secured a fine series of pictures. The figures are carefully redrawn from field sketches by Mr. Strong. These petroglyphs are located on the Washington bank of the Columbia, about one mile north from Spedis Station, on the Seattle, Portland, and Spokane railroad, or at the 99.5 mile point from Portland, Oregon, on the same line. They are across the river from the town of The Dalles, Oregon, and about seven miles north of it. The country here is rough and volcanic in nature and the high water channel where the carvings are located lies at the northeastern edge of a small valley. A double-stepped escarpment of basalt, perhaps 1500 feet high, stretches from the river bank south and west around the Spedis plain and back again to the river's edge. The Columbia from here north is marked by these palisade-like ramparts of the basalt rim rock. 76</page><page sequence="2">STRONG] PETROGLYPHS ON THE COLUMBIA RIVER 77 At the point mentioned, between the railroad and the river, and roughly parallel to the river's course, is a channel through a projection of the basalt rim which is filled by the river only at extreme high water. The channel is about a quarter of a mile in length, with an east wall some twenty feet high, and a west wall of forty feet. The bed is lower at the upstream or northern end and averages about twenty-five feet above low water in the main channel. The entire western wall of this canyon is decorated with carvings. None appear on the opposite side which at high water is submerged. In all cases the pictures appear in places still accessible and all are from five to fifteen feet above the line mark- ing high water which is twenty feet from the canyon floor. The lowest carving must stand about fifty feet above low water in the main river. The discrepancy between these levels shows the great seasonal fluctuation of the Columbia, which at the time of our visit was quite low, extreme low water occurring in October. On the top of a point between the petroglyph canyon and the river we found several flint artifacts, and in a sheltered hollow at the highest point of this high-water island was a large mortar and a pestle of gray basalt. Petroglyph Canyon, as we named the place for the sake of convenience, being below the railroad is in a decidedly isolated and inconspicuous location. The north bank of the Columbia is largely rim rock and moving sand dunes, and beyond the Wishram Indian village of Spedis there is no road. Accordingly no people save the Indians who fish at the Dalles, live in the vicinity; and except by the local Indians, the existence of the canyon appears to be unknown, although during the period of railroad construction it must have been visited. There is only one pictograph in this canyon, the rest of the pictures are petroglyphs, which are not common in the JDalles region, although a great number and variety of colored pictographs are to be found there. The petroglyphs do not appear to be all of the same age for some are quite evidently superimposed over others. An example of this appears (fig. lh) where the recent figure of a man has been placed over the older figure of a goat. In other cases slabs of the basalt have broken off leaving only half</page><page sequence="3">78 AMERICAN ANTHROPOLOGIST [N. s., 27, 1925 o, b 0qt ? . . .-. - T?.::..i: "?. - "-? f:??

The older drawings are too obscure, however, to allow any temporal distinctions of type being made. On the ledge underneath one of the largest figures (pl. ld) we found one of the rock tools used in making the pictures. It was a small, irregular boulder of hard green stone naturally conforming at one end to the grip of a hand and worn down at the more pointed end. A little experimentation showed that these pictures were not pecked into the rock but were ground out by constant rubbing which was carried on until the dark surface of the basalt was entirely removed and a gray solid body for the design formed. The deepest designs were about one quarter of an inch in depth; the others usually less. The lines of the figures were usually simple and broad, and solid bodies were usually given the animals. Hence the designs are still clear. The spirited and realistic nature of the drawings is most impressive, especially in comparison with the usual pictographic type of the vicinity which is vague, con- ventional and meaningless to the modern observer. The objects depicted in this canyon fall roughly into four classes. The first class includes anthropomorphic or definitely human figures, as for example two human figures with head decorations (fig. lh, i) Many interpretations are possible for the semicircle with rays extending from it in this design. Most probably it is the war bonnet or headdress of the man, but it may be a depiction of the sun. Decorative headdresses of this sort are very wide- spread in pictographic art, and are also on record from this region in ornamental carving.1 The lower left hand figure appears super- imposed on the earlier carving of a goat, for both legs are definitely carved over the goat design. The right hand figure apparently represents a man on horseback, holding a heavy bridle with his left arm. Here one leg is carved through the body of the "horse" the other showing on the other side only so far as it might be observed. Other human figures are crude linear carvings, usually SH. I.

The arms are often raised but in only a few cases is the head decorated. Such faces are rather square (pl. 2c, lower left), with eyes, nose, and mouth roughly depicted, and straight lines radiat- ing about an inch and a half from the top and sides. Several figures have both arms raised and fingers spread, as may be seen to the right of the main design (pl. la). While even these crude linear figures express action in their poses, they are never as well executed as the animalistic and symbolic designs with which they are associated. The second class includes all the animal forms which can be surely identified. Excluding man, there are eight species which may be ascertained with considerable accuracy. In order of their relative frequency these are the mountain sheep, the elk, the mountain goat, the deer, the horse, the wolf or coyote, the buffalo, and the rattlesnake. Carvings of the same animals have been grouped in fig. 2. The mountain sheep, now extinct in all this area, must once have been found near here, as the type locality of Ovis californianus was described by David Douglas in 1829 "from Mount Adams," Yakima County, Washington. Moreover in Wishram and Wasco tales the animal is frequently mentioned and in the same casual manner as other game animals. In such stories the identity is beyond question since the alternate name of "big-horn" is some- times used. Lewis and Clark mention the mountain sheep repeat- edly to the east, that is around the headwaters of the Missouri River, but in their account of the mammals seen along the Colum- bia they particulary describe the mountain goat3 and neglect the mountain sheep. The mountain sheep was undoubtedly more common east of this area. There can be no reasonable doubt, however, that it is the mountain sheep which is depicted in so many cases (fig. 2e, f, g, h, i, j, k, 1, and m), for the great curving horns, the square solid body, and the poses (fig. 2k) of the animals are self-evident. The artists who drew these would certainly 2 Edward Sapir, Wishram Texts, Publ. Amer. Ethn.

S., 27, 1925 seem to have had a very close acquaintance with the animal in question, and not merely hearsay knowledge. The elk (Cerous canadensis) is also very clearly pictured (fig. 2n, o, p and pl. lId, pl. 2a). The great, many-tined antlers are the main characterization and in all cases these horns, when shown with many tines branching from the main antler, are straight and not curved forward as is the case in the deer depicted (fig. 2q, r, s). The range of the elk was very wide west of the main chain of the Rockies and even now there are small bands in the Cascades and neighboring mountains. The top row and the inverted figure in the second row (fig. 2, a, b, c, d) appear to be drawings of the mountain goat; the short rather straight horns mark them off from the more frequently depicted mountain sheep. As in the mountain sheep drawings a comparatively long tail is shown, which is of course an inaccuracy due either to forgetfulness or convention. Wishram Indians at Spedis, however, made the distinction between the two species at once, and the old men stated that the mountain goat was once found near the Dalles but was now found no closer than Mount Adams about forty-five miles to the north. The type locality of the subspecies, Oreamnos montanus montanus, is "the Cascade Range near the Columbia River in Oregon or Washington,"4 so there seems to be no reason why local Indians might not have depicted the goat. The deer is not very often represented, but there are three examples (fig. 2q, r, s). The forward bend of the antlers over the brow, and the great forks of the horns instead of smaller tines, seem to establish their identity. The ranges of the various deer species overlap near the Dalles. Along the river from the vicinity of the Cascades west, are to be found forms of the black-tailed deer (Odocozleus columbianus) and the white-tailed deer (Odo- coileus virginianus). The mule deer (Odocoileus hemonius) also occurs in the region of the Dalles, but as a general rule east of the Cascades. The petroglyphs, by their delineation of bifurcated 4 Gerrit S.

That these figures represent deer seemed probable to the authors, but two vertebrate zoologists of wide field experience when shown the sketches, at once suggested the antelope (Antilocapra amer- icana). The western border of the antelope's range comes very close to the Columbia east of the Cascade Mountains, and it would be perfectly possible that this was the species depicted, especially (fig. 2q) if the people who drew the pictures were from the Great Basin area. To press the identification of three such indistinct representations farther seems unjustified. The horse is perhaps twice represented, once in the case of the mounted man (fig. li) where the head, neck, body and two fore- legs of the horse are suggested; and again in the small figure (fig. ig) where a single horse is suggested graphically but not entirely conclusively. The style reminds one of certain plains designs but definite analogues are not at hand to clinch the matter. The main significance of finding the horse depicted among the other animals in this place, lies in the lesser antiquity thereby implied, for the horse only preceded the Caucasian in the region by a short space of time. On the whole there is little about the petro- glyph to suggest any very great antiquity, and while the appear- ance of two horse figures and the man over the goat (fig. lh, lower left), are somewhat fresher, and appear somewhat later than most of the animals, there really seems no reason to give the latter more than a short priority. In connection with the wolf or coyote there is little to be said. The smaller animal to the left of the mountain sheep (pl. 2b), would appear to be a predatory animal of this nature, the long bushy tail, rounded ears and open mouth suggesting a wolf or coyote, and the grouping would seem to indicate pursuit. It is not as definite a delineation as the sheep, but granting some ar- tistic license is a good imitation of such an episode. The apparent 5 Elliot Coues. The History of the Lewis and Clark Expedition, III, p.845, 1893,43.</page><page sequence="10">84 AMERICAN ANTHROPOLOGIST [N. S., 27, 1925 indifference of the sheep might well be accounted for by the smaller size of the pursuer, in which case a coyote and not a timber wolf would seem to be represented by the latter. The rattlesnake is also only once represented (fig. lb) by a reptilian body, characterized as a rattlesnake because of the ball or button on the end of its tail. As before mentioned, there is only one pictograph in the entire canyon. This is painted in dull, rusty red on the highest rock of the west wall, in close proximity but above the neighboring petroglyphs. The subject (fig. If) is clearly the American bison or buffalo, the head, horns and tail establishing the identification. The very decided hump precludes the possibility of its being the domestic ox of later times. In summing up the evidence obtained from J. A. Allen,6 and the early explorers, A. B. Lewis says,7 "The buffalo did not penetrate far into the mountains, but they were common in southern Idaho in the Shoshoni country . . . . The buffalo occasionally ranged as far west as eastern Oregon in the Snake country but do not Seem to have reached the Columbia Valley, though it is possible that a few stragglers found their way into the upper Columbia by way of the northern passes." At the time of Lewis and Clark's visit, the Nez Perc6 considerably to the north and east, seem to have been largely out of the buffalo range for they were forced to trade for buffalo robes on the Missouri,8 whereas the Shoshoni farther south seem to have been more influenced by the presence of this great food animal char- acteristic of the plains to the east. Thus the probabilities are against this picture of the buffalo having been drawn by any Indian living at, or to the northwest of the Dalles, and the work was most likely done by some member of a more easterly band. While a different technique separates this painting from the other petroglyphs, the style and spirit of the drawing is very similar to them and quite different from any other local styles.

The third category into which the petroglyphs fall, we have called "water animals," because they come under no natural classification and when the photographs and sketches were shown to the local Wishram Indians they so designated them. The association with the water is of course primarily mythologic, although certain of the figures do crudely resemble turtles (pl. Ic, d). The water animals are best shown in pl. lc, d, and fig. la, d. The main deductions to be drawn from them would be stylistic were there more material on record with which to compare them. An owl-like figure, (pl. la, and fig. lc), perhaps a variation of the thunderbird motif, as well as a cat-faced creature (pl. lb), with many legs, whiskers, or water marks, are both very distinct designs. Definite analogues elsewhere may be revealed by more material. There may be close similarities to these on the lower Columbia but we saw none. The figure which appears as a turtle holding a bird's head (pl. Ic and fig. la) is likewise interesting and also appears to have symbolic significance which must remain uninterpreted. The "puffy-faced," owl-like mask above the main figure (pl. lIb) may represent the great horned owl (Bubo virgin- ianus) or may be wholly mythologic. The interpretation of such designs except under unusual circumstances must be wholly subjective and is usually fruitless. While the work of Mallery9 is as yet the most comprehensive treatise of its kind, it is wholly inadequate to clearly mark out the stylistic affinities of petro- graphic art, and the need for a more detailed non-subjective study of this sort is great. The fourth and last category is that of conventional designs. The curvilinear diamond (pl. lIc), above the turtle-like figure is one example. The star and comet-like figure (fig. ie) are two others, similar forms of which are quite widespread. The turtle or diagram figure (pl. lId and fig. lId) is associated with a group of animals, elk, goat and sheep, for reasons which are obscure. The last figures at the north end of the canyon are two perfect 9 Garrick Mallery.

These in the main represent this type of carving but it is obvious that they are in a minority as compared with the more realistic depictions of animals and human beings. It is worth noting that the majority of these petroglyphs are grouped on certain favorable exposures and that those on each small area have certain generic resemblances as though they had been made by one man. The grouping of subjects seems sporadic and without purpose so far as our study could ascertain, but it did appear that animal figures were usually together, as were "water monsters" while human figures might be found with either. The older men of the Wishram Indians said that these figures represented the "spirit" of the artist, and that they were made by "old, old people." Exactly how they correlated the first knowledge with the second fact was obscure. They made no distinction between the unique petroglyphs of the canyon and the much more abundant and apparently more ancient pictographs which char- acterize all the rim rock borders of the vicinity.'0 On comparing the petroglyphs from this canyon with the pictographs so abundant on both sides of the Columbia River in this vicinity we found few resemblances. The great bulk of the pictographs are done in dull red, more elaborate ones in red and white, and a few in red, white and yellow. The designs are mostly conventional. Many of them are circles with radiating arms, broken disks, scrolls and human figures with round heads, often with spread arms, and simply delineated bodies. These human figures are usually painted in red, although some are outlined in white. We saw no animals of this type, but we learned of one small elk done in red on the Washington side at Big Eddy. There are a few very crude petroglyphs around the rim rock north- 10 In this connection a statement mentioned in the Wasco tale "A Wasco Woman deceives her Husband" seems worthy of note. Tenino was a village of the Wayam Indians, situated nearly five miles above The Dalles, on the Oregon side, and the first Shahaptian village on the south side of the Columbia east of Chinookan territory. A man of this village "made pictures on the rocks to amuse the youngest child- pictures of deer, birds and weapons." Edward Sapir. Wishram Texts, I. c., 242, 243.</page><page sequence="14">STRONG] PETROGLYPHS ON THE COLUMBIA RIVER 87 west of Spedis but these are either indistinct linear human figures or the edges of painted designs. There are also some large an- thropomorphic faces done in red on the rim rock immediately behind Spedis, but they bear little resemblance to the elaborate mask-like faces of Petroglyph Canyon. Around the mouth of the Willamette River, on the Washington shore of the Columbia, are a few large boulders with exceedingly crude faces pecked on them. Many others having the surface and face of the rock toward the river are elaborately pecked, often an inch deep. Here some circular designs are observable, but as a rule a series of pits with connecting channels characterize the type. At Fisher's Landing, Washington, a large human figure about five feet long has been carved on the exposed surface around a mortar-hole twelve inches deep. Round eyes, hands, and ribs have been carved, and two legs are suggested by the natural conformation of the rock. Several of the more crudely pecked rocks near here are now being washed out of the bank at Mr. Henry Biddle's place seven miles north of Vancouver, which were covered up long ago, when the Columbia in one of its in- frequent but periodic shifts deposited instead of cut on this part of the Washington shore. The observations made by Mr. Biddle on this matter merit more investigation, for a great antiquity is implied. The point at issue in this paper, however, is to show that these lower river petroglyphs, intrinsically interesting though they be, are apparently not stylistically connected with the type in Petroglyph Canyon. There are up-river examples seemingly of this old type that have come to our notice. The first of these being a large boulder from the junction of the Umatilla and Columbia rivers, now in the City Hall Museum at Portland, Oregon. The decoration consists of a large-eyed and large-mouthed human face, with deeply pecked designs around it. The end of the rock has a similar well- designed face. A second example is from the Yakima area near Wallula Junction, Washington,' and consists of an intricate series of circles and lines deeply cut into the top of a large rock which 11 Harlan I. Smith, op. cit., p. 123, pl. xil, 1910.</page><page sequence="15">88 AMERICAN ANTHROPOLOGIST [N. S., 27, 1925 projects three feet above the ground. While there is considerable discrepancy between examples like the last two in skill of execu- tion, there occur such good transitional types along the lower Columbia River that their general contemporaneity is strongly suggested. The deep, often illegible, pecking, the great use of circles, and above all their position on river-side boulders, often on the top of these, argues strongly for their relationship. The problem is involved with that of the elaborate carved stone figures from the Columbia area, and the temporal placing of the one type will probably apply to the other. The nearest petroglyphs which have come to our notice, that seem closely related to those of Petroglyph Canyon are from the vertical basaltic columns on the east side of the Columbia Senti- nel Bluffs, immediately above Priest Rapids.12 The same grinding technique has evidently been employed, and much the same type of design is used. The elaborate, though conventional human figure, with a similar headdress, and the squarish faces with short radiating lines are almost identical. Also the well drawn animal figure, which Harlan I. Smith calls a "goat," but which by its elaborately tined antlers much more strongly suggests an elk, is very similar to elk figures from Petroglyph Canyon (fig. 2, n, o, p). The open mouth and the tail are close resemblances in style. The less distinct human figures are of the type of those from Petroglyph Canyon. Most of the other petroglyphs from this vicinity shown by Smith resemble those found associated with the pictographs around the Dalles region. They are faint, linear, and almost always conventional in design. The pictographs too suggest those of the Dalles region in their red and white color and are mostly variations of a circle, or sun disk motif with radiating lines. The petroglyphs from Buffalo Rock,'3 eighteen miles above Lewiston, Idaho, on the east bank of the Snake River, bear con- siderable resemblance to those from Petroglyph Canyon, especially in the delineation of mountain goats These, as well as the human 12 Ibid., p. 121, pl. xI. 13 Spinden.

The appearance here of buffalo-figures done in red paint, when compared with the red pictograph from Petroglyph Canyon (fig. 1, f), is of importance as regards their relationship. It is unfortunate that these buffalo pictographs are not reproduced by Spinden, but the description tallies quite well with our pictograph from the Washington shore at the Dalles. The figures of men with buffalo horns described from here by Spinden'4 also tally with a small horned human figure noted in Petroglyph Canyon. The frequent occurrence of carvings of mountain sheep or goats, and elk or deer, noted by Spinden is also an important similarity. After a careful study of Mallery,15 the closest analogy to be found is a series of pictographs from Shinume Canyon, Utah. These Mallery calls "petroglyphs," but says that according to the "draftsman's general notes" they are painted. Whether they were pecked out and then painted, cannot be ascertained. The realistic treatment of the animals, buffalo, elk and mountain sheep is remarkably similar to that of the Petroglyph Canyon animal series. Some of the human and semi-human figures from the Colorado River, Utah, also resemble those from Petroglyph Canyon, but the data are inadequate to make exact comparisons. Photographs in the possession of the Department of Anthropology of the University of California, received from J. A. Reid of Reno, Nevada, show petroglyphs from near Virginia City, Nevada, which resemble the petroglyphs from Buffalo Rocks, Idaho, as well as those from Petroglyph Canyon in their realistic drawings of mountain sheep. In a letter to the Department in regard to petroglyphs from the east fork of the Walker River, near Yering- ton, Nevada, W. A. Frazier says, "The rocks are literally covered with drawings. Most of the drawings are of trees and animals; those of the coyote and mountain sheep are the best, though many others are very good." From the foregoing it may be seen that while the data are scattered and incomplete the Dalles 14 Spinden, ibid., p. 232. 16 Garrick Mallery, Picture Writing of the American Indians. 10th Ann. Rep.

S., 27, 1925 petroglyphs in question find their closest analogues in the Great Basin area, and would appear to mark the northwesterly limit of that type. It is of course impossible to positively correlate these drawings with any one of the Great Basin tribes but it seems quite probable that they were made by the Snake Indians, a branch of the Shoshoni. The immediate southern bank of the Columbia was found to be largely uninhabited by Lewis and Clark from near the mouth of the Walla Walla to below the Dalles,16 because of fear of attacks by the Snakes. It is possible that people of these tribes carved the petroglyphs in question either during periods of peace, or to mark their incursion into enemy territory. Trade relations were also maintained between the Nez Perc6 and the local Indians of the Wishram village, as we were assured by aged Indians now living at the latter place. While there is a strong generic resemblance between the petroglyphs recorded from the Nez Perc6 area and those from the canyon in question, the Nez Perc6 area carvings are cruder, and not as highly naturalistic as the animal petroglyphs from farther east in the Great Basin. The petroglyphs already referred to, which were recorded by Harlan I. Smith from the vicinity of Priest Rapids, on the east side of the Columbia, suggests the same origin although they are even more definitely in Shahaptian territory than are those at the Dalles. The validity of the tentative conclusions arrived at in this paper can only be substantiated by a more thorough study of the petroglyphic and pictographic art of the upper Columbia River and adjacent areas. If the conclusions are accepted they suggest a much wider range for the Basin tribes, probably just after the acquisition of the horse, than is at present accorded them. What- ever conclusions may be drawn, the intrinsic interest of these highly naturalistic and animated rock carvings, isolated in one small canyon at the Dalles, will still remain.
