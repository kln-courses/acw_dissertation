<plain_text><page sequence="1">BOOK REVIEWS GOD IN GREEK PHILOSOPHY TO THE TIME OF SOCRATES. By Roy Ken- neth Hack. Princeton: Princeton University Press for the University of Cincinnati, I93I. $3.00. In substantive content this book adds another to the numerous sketches of the history of the pre-Socratic philosophers with excerpts from their fragments which the stores of Diels, Burnet, and Zeller make it so easy and so tempting to produce. Professor Hack writes well, is well read, and scatters many interesting and some eminently sensible suggestions and comments by the way. My only general criticism of his book would apply equally to nearly all the literature of the subject except the indis- pensable collections of Diels. He affirms much more about Thales, Pythag- oras, Empedocles, and the rest than the insufficient evidence enables us to verify. His ideal is to make them and all their conceptions and rela- tions to one another as intelligible to us as they would be if we were their disciples and viewed their entire systems from the inside. He knows and practically admits that it cannot be done. But he cannot refrain from trying. Because of my skeptical attitude toward the evidence I gave up my seminar on the pre-Socratics some thirty years ago. I found that after six months of would-be critical study the students were so confused by the contradictions of the interpreters that they remembered no more of the subject than they would have got from a rapid reading of the translations in Burnet or Diels. Perhaps I ought to have told them authoritatively what to believe and left it at that. In Professor Hack's intention, however, the book is much more than a historical sketch. It is the maintenance of a thesis. He holds, apparent- ly under the influence of Bergson and Cornford, that early Greek thought was a continuous development from mythology or religion to philosophy, not necessarily by way of science. He denies that Thales marks an epoch in the sense of a catastrophic and miraculous shift from the mythical to the scientific point of view. And he does not believe that Plato's philosophy is a sharp reaction against the predominantly and increasing materialis- tic and positivistic tendencies of his predecessors. They were all, from Homer down, endeavoring to define the supreme God which they divined, and contradicting or trying to better one another's formulas. This is the key, if not to all mythologies, to all pre-Platonic poets and philosophers. 464</page><page sequence="2">BOOK REVIEWS 465 Homer himself begins the process. His anthropomorphism is only skin deep. Divinity is for him essentially Power; and Zeus, Athena, and Apollo are less powerful than Fate andDestiny and other abstractions or personifi- cations of aspects of nature. The gods swear by the River Styx, and what you swear by is your superior. The unseemly behavior of Homer's Olym- pians is not Ionic levity and skepticism preluding to the godless science of Ionian philosophy. It is an anticipation from a different point of view of Xenophanes' ethical criticism of the immorality of the Homeric gods, even as Homer's Ocean, the genesis of all things, is an anticipation of Thales. With like ingenuity and with apparent reliance on the testimony of the doxographies in Cicero and the Christian fathers, it is shown that the main interests of the pre-Socratics was not scientific inquiry but the discovery of the aptest embodiment or symbol of the divine power that underlies and manifests itself in phenomena. The argument, it would seem, is an ex- ample of the way in which with the help of the discipline of the history of philosophy "philosophic thought will gradually release itself from its pres- ent servitude to science." Even the atomists are brought under this formula. Aristotle misinterpreted them. The atoms are much more than atoms. They have that within which passes show. They are Forms, with a capital letter. "The Spherical Forms themselves which are the supreme god of Leucippus stand therefore in precisely the same relation to the other Forms of Being that Heraclitus established between his supreme god Fire and the lower forms of Fire." It was perhaps worth while to see what could be said for this thesis and in abatement of some exaggerations of Zeller in the opposite sense. But I am unable to accept it as a whole, and I have neither space nor inclina- tion to examine in detail here Professor Hack's use of the evidence. My own way of approach to the pre-Socratics is sufficiently indicated in the Chicago dissertation of Miss Clara Millerd, On the Interpretation of Em- pedocles, in the article "Greek Philosophy" in Hastings Encyclopaedia, and in a paper on Heraclitus and Parmenides in the American Journal of Philology, XXI (I900), 200-2i6.
