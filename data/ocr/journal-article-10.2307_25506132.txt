<plain_text><page sequence="1">9 AN APPROACH TO WULF AND EADWACER By Peter Orton Department of English, University College, Dublin (Communicated by A. J. Bliss, m.r.i.a.) [ Received 30 July 1984. Read 8 July 1985. Published 22 November 1985.] ABSTRACT A new interpretation of this obscure Old English poem is attempted, taking as its starting-point the animal terms (wulf, hwelp,bogum) that convinced W.J. Sedgefield (M.L.R. 26 (1931)) that the narrator of the poem was meant to be a bitch, Eadwacer a dog, the hwelp their puppy, and wulf a wolf. The various obstacles to a theory of human characters are reviewed, and the case for animals emerges as surprisingly strong, though they seem to consist of a family, not of domestic dogs, as Sedgefield believed, but of wolves: the narrator, a she-wolf; her mate wulf (also called se beaducqfa); and their whelp Eadwacer (there is no compelling evidence for the (tyrant husband' figure whom Bradley (The Academy 33 (1888)) tentatively identified in Eadwacer). The chief remaining questions of interpretation are reconsidered, a translation of the poem made, and the literary and historical implications of an Old English poem that personifies wolves explored. Introduction The diversity of interpretations that the Old English Wulf and Eadwacer has attracted is such that one critic, Alain Renoir, has found it necessary to invent a special critical procedure to cope with the poem. This is the * noninterpretation ', which aims, in Renoir's words, ' to isolate the elements which make the poem an equally effective work of art for critics who completely disagree about its meaning'.1 But in abandoning the search for a single, historically acceptable interpretation, Renoir runs a considerable risk of distorting our appreciation of the poem. He admits that its original audience would have been able to decide which, if any, of the various interpretations advanced by modern critics is valid; but our inability to narrow down the possibilities is not, in Renoir's view, a serious handicap, because all our interpretations tend to converge in the same general ' response ' to the work, the prevalence of which is an assurance of its historical validity. Interpretation, it is claimed, may be bypassed, because ' to a point the poem stands apart from its meaning '.2 However, the assumptions lying behind this approach seem very questionable. It puts too much faith in a consensus of response drawn from a number of interpretations, the majority of which are probably wrong historically; and it also ignores the possibility that our imperfect understanding of the text may have steered our interpretations and our responses in wrong directions. For example, Wulf and Eadwacer's obscurity is a standing temptation to project our uncertainties back on to the poet, attributing to him such authorial aims as ambiguity, paradox or allusion (to some unidentified story no longer known); and interpretations founded 1 * Wulf and Eadwacer: a noninterpretation ', in Bessinger Jr, Jess B. and Creed, Robert P.

Such interpretations are likely, for obvious reasons, to contribute powerfully to the general sense of poignancy ' that Renoir identifies as the dominant effect ofthe poem. We cannot, of course, dismiss the possibility that the poet aimed for just this effect; but impressionistic responses are difficult to trust in the absence of any agreed interpretation. It is, admittedly, difficult to suspend response; but perhaps this is what the modern reader of the poem must attempt to do until some agreed interpretation has been reached. The proliferation of interpretations that prompted Renoir's new approach to Wulf and Eadwacer might be taken as proof that interpretation itself is an inadequate procedure for dealing with the poem; but this would be unjust. Despite the sheer volume of work done on the poem, it has not recently received the close editorial attention that all Old English poems require from time to time. Misconceptions about meaning can easily accrue as a result of this kind of neglect, and I shall try to show later that this has in fact happened in Wulf and Eadwacer's case. My chief aim here, however, is to suggest a new interpretation of the poem, beginning with a re-examination ofthe textual basis of an older one, that of W.J. Sedgefield, which holds that the speaker of the poem is not, as most critics now assume, a woman, but a bitch.3 This interpretation has failed to convince any subsequent critic ofthe poem, and I shall not try to defend all aspects of it here; but its foundation in the poet's words, which has been commonly undervalued but more often simply ignored, does, I believe, point the way to a consistent interpretation of the whole poem. Sedgefield's interpretation of Wulf and Eadwacer is presented in the form of a resume of the poem: A female dog of a romantic temperament is dreaming, day-dreaming perhaps, of a wolf with whom she has actually had, or dreams she had, a love-affair in the course of her rambles in the forest. She dreams that her masters are hot on the trail ofthe wolf, the felon beast, on a neighbour ing island in the fen. At this juncture she is awakened from her dream by the terrified yelping of her puppy. Instantly she turns to her lawful mate, slumbering by her side, with the cry, c Wake up, Eadwacer, a wolf is carrying off our puppy to the forest \ Then she consoles herself with the reflection that as she has never really bayed the moon with any wolf the abrupt parting with her dream-lover brings no pang. It has been merely a foolish dream. Thus explained, the poem would seem to be one ofthe c mystification ' class of which the formal riddles with the ending * Saga hwaet ic hatte ' are the normal type.4 Some aspects of this interpretation (for instance, the idea of a dream or day-dream) would be difficult to defend; but the fundamental point that the chief characters of the poem are animals, not human beings, is worth looking at again. The relevant textual evidence does not fall into neat categories; but nearly everything rests on the 3 W. J. Sedgefield, * Old English notes. 1. Wulf and Eadwacer \ Mod. Lang.

Wulf and Eadwacer 225 interpretation of five words of the poem: wulf (lines 4, 9, 13 and 17), hwelp (16), bogum (11), leodum (1) and weras (6). A consideration of the meaning of these words in their contexts will provide the framework of the first part of my discussion. I At the centre of Sedgefield's theory is his understanding of the poem's five instances of wulf(-) (all with small wynn in the manuscript)5 as the common noun e wolf rather than the personal name Wulf; and Wulf as a name is certainly very rare in Anglo-Saxon sources.6 In considering the records of it, some preliminary observa tions and distinctions will be valuable. First, we should recognise that the Scandi navian-based name Ulf, cognate with Old English Wulf, is extremely common in sources of the later part of the Anglo-Saxon period, particularly in the Domesday Book.7 It would be surprising to find instances of Ulf in English sources before the period of relatively heavy Scandinavian settlement in the ninth century; and in fact it seems to be unrecorded before the beginning of the tenth, perhaps the very earliest instance being the moneyer Ulf whose name appears on a coin issued under Edward the Elder.8 Records of Ulf are not very plentiful for the tenth century, but become so for the eleventh. Secondly, a distinction should be drawn between Wulf as a possibly indigenous English name and as a reflection of the naturalisation in England of Norse Ulfr. The latter development would be easy to envisage, particularly in view of the popularity of Wulf- and -wulf as elements of native compounded names. Because any instances of Wulf from sources dating from the later period might be explained in this way, the status of Wulf as an indigenous name must depend on earlier, pre-Viking sources. And thirdly, the factor of Norman orthography as an influence on the representation in writing of either Wulf or Ulf must be taken into account. Scribes of Norman origin or training would have been poorly equipped to make any clear distinction between the two names; for they might use any of the symbols u, v or 0 for initial u, or u, uu or w for initial wynn, and even simple u for wynn plus u.9 As a result, such forms as Ulf, Vlf, 0If and Wlf all of which actually occur in post-Conquest sources, may stand for either name. Below I discuss all clear instances of the name Wulf in English sources dating from the Anglo-Saxon period. All are listed by Searle or Redin,10 to whose citations I have been unable to add. 5 See facsimile, The Exeter Book of Old English poetry, with introductory chapters by R. W. Chambers, Max Forster and Robin Flower (London, 1933), ff 100v-101r. Personal names are not, however, usually given initial capitals by Old English scribes. 8 See Erik Bjorkman, ' Studien uber die Eigennamen im Beowulf \ Studien zur Englischen Philologie 58 (1920), 120; Gillian Fellows Jensen, Scandinavian personal names in Lincolnshire and Torkshire (Copen hagen, 1968), p. 324. 7 See Bjorkman, * Nordische Personennamen in England im Alt- und Fruhmittel-Englischer Zeit', Studien zur Englischen Philologie 37 (1910), 165-6. 8 See Herbert A.

(II) In the D manuscript ofthe Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, a Wulf son of Leofwine, is mentioned as an English casualty at the battle of Ringmere in the lOlOannal; but support for this Wulf is lacking in manuscript E, which has Wulfric in the correspond ing place.13 (III) A will of one Wulf bequeathing land in Hertfordshire to St Albans Abbey during the Confessor's reign, survives in a single manuscript of the thirteenth century;14 elsewhere, this benefactor is referred to as Quidam Danusprepotens.15 (IV) In Beowulf there are two references to Wulf the Geat, son of Wonred (2965) and brother of Iofor (2993 Iofore ond Wulfe). It is probable that the Beowulf poet himself received the name in this form from a source, oral or written, which told the story ofthe war between Geats and Swedes;16 but if, as some recent scholars suspect, the subject-matter of Beowulf was imported from Scandinavia long after the Anglo-Saxon settlement,17 then perhaps the Beowulf poet is to be credited with the anglicisation of Ulfr in his source. In either case, that the name goes back ultimately to Ulfr is suggested first by the probability that a story of Geats and Swedes would have contained Norse names in its earliest form, and second by the hint of a Norse combination in the fact that the names of Wulf and his brother Iofor (both animal names, ' wolf and c boar ' respectively)18 would have formed an alliterating com bination in Old Norse (cf. their Old Icelandic cognates ulfr and jofurr). The vexed question of Beowulf's date of composition does not affect the main conclusion to be drawn from these meagre English records of Wulf which is that in view of the absence of evidence that any Englishman bore the name before the 11 See Grueber and Keary, Catalogue, pp 202, 393 (nos 688-90); B. E. Hildebrand, Anglosachsiska mynt i Svenska Kongliga myntkabinettet (Stockholm, 1881), p. 45 (nos 241-4), p. 443 (nos 381-4), p. 444 (nos 389-90). 12 I am indebted to Miss M. M. Archibald of the Department of Coins and Medals at the British Museum for this information and for references. Variation between Scandinavian and Old English forms of moneyers' names will probably more often reflect anglicisation of the Scandinavian name than vice versa; see Veronica Smart, ' A note on the moneyers of the mint at. Lincoln ', in H. R. Mossop, The Lincoln mint, c. 890-1279 (Newcastle-upon-Tyne, 1970), pp 20-7, esp. 22. The variation inform in the case of the Lincoln moneyer Ulf/Wulfmay well be attributable to the central manufacture and distribution of dies during the Confessor's reign: in London, anglicisation of Ulf to Wulf would be likelier than in Lincoln; see Smart, p. 23. 13 See Charles Plummer (ed.), Two of the Saxon Chronicles parallel (Oxford, 1892; rep., with biblio graphical note by Dorothy Whitelock, 1952), I, p. 140; II, p. 188. 14 See P.

Wulf and Eadwacer 227 second half of the tenth century it was probably not an indigenous name. Neither, apparently, did it become popular later in the Anglo-Saxon period. The evidence ofthe coins and the will suggests that the Scandinavian-based name LT/'was occasion ally anglicised as Wulf perhaps due partly to familiarity with Wulf- or -wulf in native compounded names, or with Wulf in such English versions of Scandinavian material as Beowulf; but the rarity of Wulf even in late sources tends to suggest that Ulf was not, in general, naturalised to the extent that children born in England were christened Wulf The implications of these conclusions for the interpretation of Wulf and Eadwacer are important. The Exeter Book was written during the second half of the tenth century. When the collection it represents was compiled is uncertain: Sisam suggested the early part of the tenth century or the end of the ninth, though the evidence for this is inconclusive.19 However, in a poem composed near the middle of the tenth century at the latest, and perhaps earlier, it seems improbable that the form wulf would have been readily understood as the name of a human character of English stock by the audience. It might, as a name, have suggested a Scandinav ian; but there must be some doubt about whether it would have been understood as a personal name of any kind. Here we should note that it is fairly certain that wulf rather than ulf is original to the poem. Lines in which wulf(-) occurs are as follows: Wulf is on iege, ic on oJ)erre. (4) Wulfes ic mines widlastum wenum dogode; (9) Wulf, min Wulf, wena me f)ine (13) bired wulf to wuda. (17)20 In 9 and 13, initial w is confirmed by alliteration. The same is probably true of 17, if the alliterative structure of line 19, uncer giedd geador (another ' short' line)21 is a guide to the alliterative requirements in 17. But in 4, wulf does not carry alliteration, which is here vocalic (iege, o]&gt;erre); 4a is an instance of the rare phenomenon of ' delayed alliteration ', which occurs occasionally in The battle of Maldon (80a, 45b, 75b, 189b, 288b),22 but seems to be infrequent or absent in other definitely late poems. In 4a, the substitution of ulf for wulf would produce a perfectly unexcep tional verse with double alliteration; but the same substitution in the other lines would lead to irregularities of one kind or another; and in the case of 9a it would produce another instance of delayed alliteration of the kind we already have without emendation in 4a. It is therefore clear that there is no question of emending to ulf and that there is no justification for assuming on the basis of the alliterative anomaly in 4a that the poet was aware of ulf the Norse cognate of wulf as an available alternative to the latter to which he might resort when wulf made alliterative require ments difficult to fulfil. 19 Kenneth Sisam, Studies in the history of Old English literature (Oxford, 1953), pp 97-108. For the view that the Exeter Book is itself the original compilation, see T. P. Dunning and A. J. Bliss (eds), The wanderer (London, 1969), pp 3-4. 20 Old English poems are quoted from George Philip Krapp and Elliott Van Kirk Dobbie (eds), The Anglo-Saxon poetic records (6 vols, New York, 1931-42), unless otherwise stated. 21 Double alliteration is usual in short lines in the Old Norse Ijodahdttr stanza, and is common but by no means invariable in Old English short lines; see A. J. Bliss, ' Single half-lines in Old English poetry ', Notes and Queries 216 (1971), 442-9. 22 See A.J. Bliss, The metre of Beowulf (2nd ed;; Oxford, 1967), ? 120.</page><page sequence="6">228 Proceedings of the Royal Irish Academy If wulf in the poem is not a man's name, we are not forced to take it literally as the common noun ' wolf', as Sedgefield does, if a case can be made for ' wolf' as a metaphor for a human being. Uncompounded wulf refers once to the devil in Old English (Christ 256 se awyrgda wulf); and in the Martyrology, the heathen emperor Numerianus is condemned by St Babyllas as deofles wulf;23 but there is no warrant for attributing devilish or heathen qualities to the wulf of our poem. Poetic compounds in -wulf (heoruwulf, ' fierce wolf', herewulf, hildewulf, both ' war-wolf', and walwulf, ' slaughter-wolf ')24 refer, in all their recorded instances, to ferocious warriors, eager for battle or carnage. Such a description might conceivably fit the wulf of Wulf and Eadwacer 17, if this line is taken as a description of his abduction of the speaker's hwelp. I shall discuss hwelp and its context fully below; here it need only be said that it is by no means certain that wulf is guilty of this. One final possibility of metaphorical interpretation lies in the association in Old English between wolf imagery and outlawry, attested by the expression uulues heued, ' wolf's head ', a term for an outlaw occurring in the laws of Edward the Confessor, and the compound wulfheafedtreow, probably ' cross ', in Riddle 55.12, which seems to reflect ultimately the same association ;25 and here a connection with Wulf and Eadwacer has been suggested, though tentatively, by E. G. Stanley.26 It may be that the wulf of our poem is outlawed; the fact that ' bloodthirsty men ' (6 walreowe weras) are nearby suggests that he is in danger.27 But there is nothing in the text which clarifies his position under any system of law. In the absence, therefore, of evidence that outlaws were directly termed i wolves ' in Anglo-Saxon times, this interpretation seems unconvincing; but it is perhaps not to be dismissed too readily, and I shall return to it below.-8 The fact that difficulties stand in the way of taking wulf either as a personal name or as a metaphor for a human being gives some negative support to Sedgefield's interpretation; but the full implications of his view that the poem's characters are animals will require detailed examination before any decision can be reached. II The second important piece of textual evidence for animal characters in Wulf and Eadwacer is the word hwelp in line 16, which occurs in the following context: Gehyrest pu, Eadwacer ? Uncerne earne hwelp bired wulf to wuda. These lines contain so many uncertainties of interpretation that any translation of them would be misleading at this stage; but it is generally agreed that Gehyrest pu means ' Do you hear? '; Uncerne, l our ' (dual); bired, ' is carrying ' or ' will carry '; -3 See George Herzfeld (ed.).

Leaving aside for the moment the problem of the meaning of the adjective earne, it is clear that the speaker, who is female, if the evidence of inflexion in 10 reotugu, ' sorrowful', and 14 seoce, ' ill', is to be trusted,29 here refers to her possession, in common with one other individual, of a hwelp; and in view of the literal meaning of hwelp in Old English generally (' whelp ', ' cub ', c puppy', of such animals as dog, wolf, lion or bear), the relationship seems likely to be parental. Who, or what, is this hwelp? It seems unlikely to be a personal name. A man called Welp is mentioned in the Yorkshire Domesday Book, and an Aluric with the by-name uuelp appears in the Oxfordshire entry.30 Norse hvelpr and its cognates appear sporadically as a name or by-name in a range of Scandinavian sources,31 and as in the case of Wulf these English instances are probably to be explained as a sign of the Scandinavian element in English life in the late Anglo-Saxon period. But personal names are only rarely qualified by adjectives in Old English, as hwelp is here (16 Uncerne earne). In poetry, there are only two certain instances of a posses sive adjective placed after a name {Beowulf 2434 Hygelac min, Christ 164 Ioseph min), a possible third instance being Wulf and Eadwacer 9 Wulfes ic mines.Z2 But there is no certain instance in which the order is reversed, the only possible examples being in Wulf and Eadwacer itself: 13 Wulf, min Wulf, and 16 Uncerne earne hwelp, the first of which might be brought into line with Beowulf 2434 and Christ 164 simply by repunctuation (Wulf min, Wulf). It is noticeable that Wulf and Eadwacer accounts for a very high proportion (three out of five) of the total possible instances of this collocation of personal name with possessive adjective in the entire Old English poetic corpus; and this surely reinforces the suspicion that wulf, as well as hwelp, is not a personal name in the poem. The possibility that hwelp is a metaphor for a human child also seems rather remote. According to the Oxford English dictionary, s.v. whelp, the word is not found used metaphorically of human beings in the Old English period; and Bosworth and Toller's Anglo-Saxon dictionary and Supplement bear this out.33 The earliest recorded examples of hwelp so used are from the fourteenth century. The ingenious idea that hwelp is a word-play on the name of its father Wulf has found wide acceptance among critics of the poem.34 Against this view, however, it has been pointed out that there are no other clear signs of Wulf's paternity, and that Uncerne in 16 might seem, from its position, to refer rather to the speaker and the individual designated 2ft The value of reotugu here as evidence of a female speaker is upheld in a recent controversy over the sex of the speaker in The wife's lament; see Martin Stevens, ' The narrator of The wife's lament \ Neuphilologische Mitteilungen (N.M.) 69 (1968), 72-90, esp. 81; and Bruce Mitchell, * The narrator of The wife's lament: some syntactical problems reconsidered ', N.M. 73 (1972), 222-34, esp. 232 and n. 3. 30 See William Page (ed.), The Victoria History of the County of York, II (London, 1912), p. 266; and L.

This is a problem I shall return to later.36 Other problems of interpretation raised by lines 16-17 cannot be detached from the problem of hwelp, and it will be useful to outline the chief difficulties here. The strong accusative singular masculine adjective earne, which qualifies hwelp, has been taken variously as a syncopated form of earone, ' swift', as a simplified form of eargne (earhne), ccowardly ', and as a simplified form oiearmne, 'wretched \37 Clearly, the choice of meaning here will either reflect or determine our idea of the speaker's attitude to her hwelp and the relationship between them. The word Eadwacer presents us with a whole range of difficulties. If a personal name, it might denote the individual previously referred to as se beaducafa in line 11; and if wulf(-) is not a personal name, it might even refer to him.38 A third possibility, of course, is that Eadwacer is a character hitherto un mentioned in the poem. The same range of possible referents exists if Eadwacer is not a name but a descriptive or characterising designation, meaning either ' property watcher ' or ' vigilant (one) ', ' wakeful (one) \39 A third problem is represented by 17 wulf, which may refer either to the individual wulf of the earlier lines or to a different individual. This is a question that depends largely on whether we take the wulf of lines 4, 9 and 13 (quoted above) as a personal name or not. Some impression can be made on these difficulties in lines 16-17 by reconsidering the question of their proper punctuation and division into sentences. This is how they are presented by Rieger and Hicketier respectively: Gehyrest f)u Eadwacer, uncerne earne hwelp ? bired wulf to wuda,40 Gehyrest f&gt;u, Eadwacer, uncerne earne hwelp ?

Wulf and Eadwacer 2 31 Rieger is alone in taking Eadwacer as the direct object of Gehyrest and parallel grammatically with hwelp;*2 Hicketier was the first to take the view, now generally adopted, that Eadwacer is vocative.43 But they agree in taking line 16 as a whole sentence, in which they are followed only by Eliason among subsequent writers.44 There is support for this arrangement in the observations of Hans Kuhn on Old English poetic word order in relation to metrical stress.45 One of the conditions of Kuhn's first law is that finite verbs (which, along with pronouns, conjunctions and certain adverbs, belong to a category of word Kuhn calls ' sentence-particles ') bear metrical stress only if they occur later than the first dip of the clause of which they are a part. Here bired is, according to the conventional punctuation of these lines (quoted earlier), indeed beyond the first dip of its clause (occupied only by 16 Uncerne), and we should expect it to be stressed accordingly; but the verb is followed in the same verse by two stressed, alliterating words, wulf and wuda; and it would be most unusual for the first stressed word of a verse to fail in alliteration when followed by two further stressed words in the same verse. This anomaly is even more glaring than the anomalous alliteration in 4a, discussed earlier.46 Another point in favour of Rieger's and Hicketier's arrangement, also dependent on Kuhn's observations, is that it would be unusual for a wcrd such as uncerne to be the sole occupant of a metrical dip right at the beginning of a clause. According to Kuhn's second law, any clause that begins with a metrical dip must have at least one sentence-particle in this opening dip; and uncerne, a possessive, is not to be classified as a sentence particle. Rieger's and Hicketier's punctuation of these lines avoids both these difficulties, and so there is good reason for adopting it. If we do so, we shall be in a slightly better position to cope with the questions raised by these lines that were left unanswered earlier on. It should, however, be emphas ised here that in trying to arrive at a consistent and valid interpretation of lines 16-17 of the poem, one is forced to deal almost entirely with probabilities of meaning, for there are few certainties. The range of interpretations these lines might support is considerable; the possibilities can be kept within manageable limits only by trying to avoid all unnecessary complications. I return first to 16 earne. As I mentioned earlier, one explanation of earne is that it is a syncopated form of earone, ' swift '; but this would be difficult to justify phono logically, for other wo-stem adjectives of the same general type rarely, if ever, show syncopation of medial 0 in the accusative singular masculine.47 Another possible explanation is that earne is a simplification 42 Rieger, p. 218; his translation is ' Horst du Eadwacer, unsern zornigen Welf?

It could be argued, however, that it requires emendation; for phonological loss of m in triple consonant groups is not well attested in Old English.48 The best course seems to be to take earne as a simplified form of eargne, ' cowardly ', for loss of the velar spirant 3 in the group ~rgn- is found in inflected forms of morgen (e.g. Beowulf 2450 morna).^ This supporting evidence is admittedly rather limited, but nothing better is available. Later I shall try to explain the speaker's denigration of her hwelp as ' cowardly \50 The syntax of line 17, Bired wulf to wuda, as punctuated by Rieger, seems clear. There is nothing to show whether wulf is the subject of Bired or its object; but both Rieger and Hicketier understand hwelp as the unexpressed subject of Bired, and wulf as its object,51 and this seems the most natural interpretation. The idiomatic omission of object-pronouns in coordinate clauses is possible in verse when the subject is unchanged;52 but in 17 the subject is certainly different from that ofthe previous clause (16), and so we must translate: ' He is carrying (or will carry) wulf to the wood '. The wider question of why and in what sense the hwelp carries wulf to the wood arises; but this will be more easily answered later, in the course of a general interpretation of the whole poem.53 A further problem is the identity of wulf in line 17; in particular, whether or not this is the same wulf as in previous lines. The difficulty of the context is such that this question cannot be considered in isolation; the identity of 17 wulf is just one of a network of uncertainties. It would, however, be confusing if there were two referents for wulf in so short a poem; and as there is no obvious attempt at differenti ation, it is probably safe to proceed on the assumption that there is only one. Finally, I return to Eadwacer. If, as I have just suggested, the wulf of 11 is the same as the wulf of earlier lines, then it is unlikely that Eadwacer, as a vocative, refers to wulf'(' Do you hear, Eadwacer [i.e. wulf], our cowardly hwelp? He is carrying [or will carry] wulf to the wood '). The chief objection to this interpretation is that it involves a temporary, unheralded switch from wulf to Eadwacer as the speaker's way of referring to one individual. Eadwacer ought therefore to refer to a character different from wulf However, it is only wulf who is addressed directly (as Eadwacer here seems to be) elsewhere in the poem. Need we introduce the complication of a second addressee, especially one about whom we can establish nothing for certain other than his name Eadwacer (if name it is) ? Eadwacer might be the name of se headucafa, referred to in line 11; but there is nothing to suggest this. Perhaps we should prefer the simplest solution to these difficulties and discard the idea that Eadwacer is vocative, taking it instead, with Rieger, as an accusative, the name or by-name or characterising designation ofthe hwelp. According to this interpretation, the pronoun in Gehyrest pu must surely refer to wulf The only other possibility is that it is the reader who is directly addressed here, but this would involve an unsig 48 Campbell (Grammar, ?? 476-7) lists no instances of loss of m. 49 Campbell, Grammar, ? 477(6); see also Baker, ' Ambiguity ', p. 50. 50 See below, pp 245-6. 51 Rieger, ' Ober Cynevulf', p. 218; Hicketier, ' Fiinf Ratsel ', p. 581. 52 See Randolph Quirk and C.

Wulf and Eadwacer 233 nailed change of referent: the possessive adjective pine in 13 and 14 certainly refers to wulf, so one naturally expects pu in 16 to do so too. If pu does indeed refer to wulf, then the use of wulf in 17 rather than a pronoun means that this line cannot be part of the speaker's direct address to wulf (13-16), but must represent a reversion to the earlier, reflective mode of lines 1-12. Another implication of this interpretation is that the verb Bired in 17 probably expresses future rather than present tense; otherwise we are faced with the absurdity of the speaker alerting wulf to the presence of the hwelp at a time when the latter is already carrying wulf to the wood. I suggest, therefore, that lines 16-17 be translated: ' Do you hear Eadwacer, our cowardly whelp? He will carry wulf to the wood '. Earlier I noted that the juxtaposition of Eadwacer and uncerne might be taken as a sign that the latter word refers, in part, to Eadwacer; but if Eadwacer is taken in the way I have suggested, as the object of Gehyrest and a reference to the hwelp, then plainly uncerne can refer only to the speaker and wulf, whom she is addressing. The hwelpjEadwacer belongs to them, and is almost certainly their offspring. I have had to reconsider the meaning of lines 16-17 of the poem in some detail because most of the problems they pose are connected, and the question of the nature and identity of the hwelp cannot be divorced from them. Later I shall try to determine the hwelp's role in the action of the poem;54 but there seems to be nothing in these lines to suggest that hwelp is either a personal name or a metaphorical reference to a human being. The general readiness of modern readers of the poem to take hwelp as a metaphor probably arises from familiarity with such metaphors in modern literature, particularly Shakespeare's plays;55 but however we interpret these lines, there is no firm evidence with which to oppose Sedgefield's acceptance of the word in its usual Old English sense of' whelp ', ' cub ' or ' puppy \ III The third piece of evidence that bears closely on the problem of the nature of the characters in Wulf and Eadwacer is bogum in line 11: ]i)onne hit waes renig weder ond ic reotugu saet, ]?onne mee se beaducafa bogum bilegde, waes me wyn to pon, waes me hwaepre eac lad. when it was rainy weather and I sat lamenting, when the warrior embraced (or covered) me with bogum, there was pleasure for me in that, but nonetheless it was also hateful to me '. Two recent critics have suggested that bogum may be taken as dative plural, not of bog (boh), ' arm ', * bough ', but of boga with short 0, which denotes curved objects in Old English, most commonly the weapon, ' bow \56 Either bogum or bogum is acceptable metrically here. Fanagan believes that there is deliberate ambiguity in verse lib, which will support interpretation both as ' afflicted me with his bows ' 54 See below, pp 245-6. 55 E.g. Titus Andronkusy II. iii. 281; see O.E.D. s.v. whelp, sb.5 2(c). 56 Eliason, 'On Wulf and Eadwacer* (see note 38 above), and John M.

One objection to this interpretation is, of course, that this kind of ambiguity would not emerge clearly in recitation, where a choice between long and short vowel in the stem of bogum would have to be made. If ' bows ' is taken as the primary or sole meaning of bogum, we are faced with the problem of wyn in 12: it is hard to believe that the speaker would have found an armed attack welcome in any sense or degree. Eliason, on the other hand, takes bogum as meaning ' in folded parchment leaves ', an interpretation bound up with his argument that Wulf and Eadwacer is a complaint about a careless scribe's separation of poems or parts of poems (perhaps the two groups of Riddles) which belong together in the Exeter Book. Eliason's reading of the poem is impossible to summarise briefly; but I think it is fair to say that it involves the assumption of a great deal of highly figurative expression in the poem?more, probably, than most readers would find easy to accept. The majority of critics, however, take bogum as dative plural of bog, the commonest meanings of which are ' arm ', ' shoulder ' and ' bough '. Malone believes that either meaning is possible here, so that line 11 might be translated either as * when the warrior embraced me with (his) arms ' or as ? when the warrior covered me with boughs '.57 However, as Sieper and (later) Campbell have pointed out, the word bog in the sense of a shoulder or upper part of a limb is always used of animals in Old English, never of men.58 This important observation seems to have been lost sight of in recent work on Wulf and Eadwacer. The words for a human shoulder in Old English are eaxel or sculdor, the distinction between these and bog being reflected in Old English glosses of Latin, which also distinguishes between an animal's armus and a man's umerus:59 for armus, bog appears, and for umerus, eaxel or sculdor.*0 Campbell opts for the meaning ' boughs ' here; but Sieper would explain the meaning ' arms ' in much the same way as he explains hwelp for the child of wulf?as a play on the name; and by so doing, he arrives at the conclusion that se beaducafa refers (like Eadwacer in Sieper's view, though not in Frankis's)61 to wulf We may note that despite the different ways in which Campbell and Sieper cope with the problem of bogum, both their interpretations tend to invalidate the image, created by these lines for those who interpret the poem as a description of a menage a trois, of a man other than wulf imposing an unwelcome embrace on the speaker. Neither of these interpretations, however, is very persuasive. Sieper's view that the fact of a man's being called Wulf is in itself sufficient justification for his arms being referred to by a word which would normally mean * forelegs ' is even less convincing than the idea that his child may be termed c whelp ' for the same reason. Campbell, in settling on ' boughs ' here, is clearly assuming that se beaducafa cannot possibly refer to an animal; but in the light of the other evidence that the poem's characters are non-human, this is not a completely safe assumption. Furthermore, 57 See Kemp Malone, ' Two English Frauenlieder', Comparative Lit. 14 (1962), 106-17, esp. 109-10. 68 Sieper, Die Altenglische Elegie, p. 181; Campbell, in Toller's Supplement, 'Additions and cor rections ', p. 11. 59 See Charlton T. Lewis and Charles Short, A Latin dictionary (Oxford, 1879), s.v. armus: * with few exceptions, of the shoulder of an animal, while umerus designates that of men '. u0 The distinction between these pairings seems to be consistently maintained in Old English. wl Sieper, p. 177; Frankis, ' Conjectures \ p. 173, n. 34.</page><page sequence="13">Orton? Wulf and Eadwacer 235 there are difficulties in the way of taking mee . . . bogum bilegde as meaning e covered me with boughs \ If the expression is literal, then the covering is presumably provided as a protection against the renig weder referred to in the previous line; but why is the speaker so helpless in the rain? As Malone puts it, ' Would she have been sitting out in the open in rainy weather? '62 The speaker's plight is evidently a desperate one; but it is hard to believe that she is immobilised physically. If, on the other hand, the expression is figurative, it might refer, by metonymy, to the speaker's being given shelter in a wooden building of some sort, a hut or house, even a Grubenhaus of the kind the speaker in The wife's lament may perhaps inhabit.63 But in either case, we shall be forced to speculate about why such an apparently charitable action on the beaducafa\ part should have been at all ' hateful' (lad) to the speaker. A further objection to Campbell's interpretation is that the action represented by bogum bilegde seems to have more to do with the speaker's emotional state than with her material circumstances: originally, she is reotugu, ' lamenting ' ;64 but after the beaducafa's attentions, a change is effected in her, a welcome one in some respects (wyn), though not in all (lad). Whatever the reason may be for her mixed feelings about what se beaducafa does to her, the complexity of her response implies that he has done more than rescue her from a soaking. It could even be argued (though it never has been, so far as I know) that the rain is to be taken semi-figuratively, and stands in relation to the speaker's mood in much the same way as cold and frost stand in relation to the condition of exile in such poems as The wanderer and The seafarer?as external concomitants of a certain state of mind.65 If bogum bilegde denotes an embrace, then this, together with the fact that bog in its anatomical sense is applied exclusively to animals in Old English, would mean that se beaducafa and, presumably, the speaker herself are animals. If we wish to maintain that se beaducafa is a man, we need either to take bogum as ' boughs ' (or ' bows '), or assume that in this text alone the sense of bog is extended to cover a human referent. In my earlier discussion of the form wulf, the issue of possible Scandinavian influence on Wulf and Eadwacer arose, and here we should note that Old Icelandic bogr, cognate with Old English bog, though normally applied to animals (invariably to horses in Eddaic poetry), may also have human application in skaldic verse.66 Lawrence, who argued that Wulf and Eadwacer is a translation from Norse, surprisingly omits any mention of bogum.*7 The word presents us with a methodological dilemma. A strong case for the humanity of the poem's characters seems to depend on an explanation of bogum on the basis of Norse influence, and even without bogum the case for such influence is by no means negligible; but is bogum admissible as evidence in support of whatever other hints of Norse influence the poem contains ? If so, it might swing the balance in favour of human characters in 82 Malone, * Frauenlieder ', p . 110. 63 See Joseph Harris, 'A note on eordscrafjeordsele and current interpretations of The wife's lament\ Engl. Stud. 58 (1977), 204-8. 84 See Baker, * The ambiguity of Wulf and Eadwacer', p. 47, for the argument that reotugu, often taken as ' sorrowful', means ' wailing ' or ' lamenting *. 66 See Stanley, 'Old English poetic diction', pp 436-8; Malone, 'Frauenlieder', p. 110. 68 See Richard Cleasby and Gudbrand Vigfusson, An Icelandic-English dictionary (2nd ed., Oxford, 1957), s.v. bogr\ Sveinbjorn Egilsson and Finnur Jonsson, Lexicon poeticum antique lingua septentrionalis (2nd ed., Copenhagen, 1931), s.v. bogr. 67 Lawrence, * The first Riddle of Cynewulf' (see note 37 above).</page><page sequence="14">236 Proceedings of the Royal Irish Academy the poem?a satisfactory outcome from some points of view. However, bogum is a crux, and no other consideration outweighs the fact that in an English poem it should mean ' bows ', ' boughs ' or animal ' arms '. The word cannot, in the circumstances, be used to bolster the case for Norse influence on the poem. If, as I have suggested, bogum denotes the forelegs or shoulders of an animal rather than boughs or bows, then se beaducafa is plainly an animal. The question that remains is whether he is to be identified with wulf or with the hwelp (Eadwacer) or is an independent character. The compound adjective beaducqf occurs nowhere else in Old English, though its meaning, ' battle-prompt', is clear enough.68 Although such a word would, in isolation, more readily suggest a human being than an animal, it seems probable that it is a product of the same analogy between warrior and beast as is expressed in such wolf metaphors as welwulfand hildewulf (for warriors) which were mentioned earlier;69 and it also seems most likely that Sedgefield was right to take se beaducafa as a term for wulf.10 The use of the demonstrative se tends to indicate an established character; if he were a hitherto unmentioned one, we might expect a clearer indication than we are given of his relationship with the speaker. Another hint that se beaducafa is wulf is the comfort (12 wyn) which the speaker draws from his attentions. Elsewhere, the speaker expresses positive feelings towards wulf alone (assuming that 16 earne, applied to the hwelp, does mean ' cowardly ', as I have suggested);71 and that she should take consolation, however alloyed, from the embrace of a second individual would conflict with the devotion she expresses towards the first. Wulf is evidently absent more often than present, though perhaps he visits the speaker periodically: she suffers from, and indeed becomes ill (14 seoce) as a result of, his seldcymas, ' rare visits ', though this may of course be an instance of litotes, expressing his invariable absence.72 If se beaducafa is wulf, then this suffering the speaker endures may be related in some way to the fact that the former's embraces (if this is what they are) are in a sense ' hateful' to her. The question of why her attitude to these embraces should have been ambivalent remains, but I shall suggest a possible reason for this later on.73 IV I turn next to examine a number of interconnected problems of interpretation in lines 1-2 and 6-7 of Wulf and Eadwacer. As I am still concerned with the funda mental question of the nature of the poem's characters, the identity of the groups of individuals referred to as Leodum . . . minum in 1 and walreowe weras in 6 will be my chief concern, though I shall necessarily be considering other, related problems at the same time, particularly the meaning of lines 2 and 7. The difficulties presented by line 1, particularly the meaning of lac, will be dealt with in a subsequent section. 68 See Bosworth and Toller, Dictionary, s.v. caf. 69 See above, p. 228. 70 This seems to be implied by Sedgefield in his reference to a ' love affair ' between the speaker and wulf: see p. 224 above. 71 Above, p. 232. 72 See I. Gollancz, ' Wulf and Eadwacer: an Anglo-Saxon monodrama in five acts', Athen&lt;sum (July-Dec. 1893), p. 883, who translates seldcymas as ' never-coming '; and Terrence Keough, ' The tension of separation in Wulf and Eadwacer '', N.M. 11 (1976); 552-60, esp. 559. 73 Below, pp 244-5.</page><page sequence="15">Orton? Wulf and Eadwacer q.^1 The referent of the pronouns hine and he in line 2 is not immediately apparent: Leodum is minum swylce him mon lac gife; willad hy hine a]?ecgan&gt; gif he on J)reat cymed.

We have to wait for their repetition in 7 before it becomes clear that they refer to wulf (4). In identical lines, the pronoun hy, ' they ', refers respectively to Leodum . . . minum in 2 and walreowe weras in 7. The questioning of the intention of both these groups towards wulf forms a link between them, and there is a strong probability that they are identical groups, or at least that the weras are composed of members of the speaker's leode. Whether or not the groups are to be equated is of obvious importance for present purposes; for if, as I argued earlier, the speaker is a wolf-bitch, her leode (normally * people ' in the sense of nation or tribe in Old English)74 must surely be the pack of which she is a member; and if this leode is identifiable with the wtelreowe weras of line 6, these 'bloodthirsty men', like the speaker's leode, are not really men at all, but wolves. Whether these deductions are justified or not depends on whether we can accept a word like weras, which would normally refer to human beings, as a reference to animals. Earlier I presented evidence that wulf and hwelp are probably to be taken as literal references to animals; so why should Leodum and weras not be literal references to human beings ? This would be a reasonable question were it not for se beaducafa in 11. Beaducafa, like weras, would normally indicate a human warrior; but the link with bogum, a word for animal rather than human anatomy, suggests that it refers to an animal?wulf, in all likelihood. Furthermore, there is some independent evidence that the warrior animal equation exemplified in, for example, walwulfas for the Vikings in The battle of Maldon could be reversed in Old English poetry. Riddle 15 contains the following passage: Me bi$ gyrn witod, gif mee onhaele an onfinded wgelgrim wiga, f&gt;3er ic wic buge, {Riddle 15.6b-8) * Grief will be my lot if a certain fierce warrior finds me hidden where I have my dwelling \ The wcelgrim wiga (later called walhwelpes in 32, s bloodthirsty whelp ') is plainly some predatory beast capable of tackling the speaker of the riddle (probably a badger, but perhaps a fox)75 on its home ground; and a dog or a wolf are the chief possibilities. If the riddle poet can use such an expression for such an animal, it is not incredible that the Wulf and Eadwacer poet should refer to wolves as walreowe weras. 74 See Bosworth and Toller, Dictionary, s.v. leod. 75 See Krapp and Dobbie's note in The Exeter Book (The Anglo-Saxon Poetic Records, vol. 3), p. 329, and Craig Williamson (ed.), The Old English Riddles of the Exeter Book (Chapel Hill, 1977), pp 173-4, who opts for ' fox' as the solution.</page><page sequence="16">238 Proceedings of the Royal Irish Academy The meanings of the words apecgan and preat in lines 2 and 7 are not directly relevant to the question of the nature of the poem's characters; but they are best dealt with at this point. Apecgan offers serious difficulties. In a recent discussion, Peter S. Baker has revived Bradley's interpretation of apecgan as * to feed ', only to reject it finally on contextual grounds in favour of Sweet's gloss, * destroy ', ' kill \76 Apecgan occurs only once elsewhere in Old English, in the prose Leechdoms, where the context is Gif mon Pung ete, apege buteran and drince, translated by Cockayne: ' If a man eat wolf's bane, let him eat and drink butter \77 Toller's translation, '. . . let him take some butter, and wash it down by drinking ',78 reflects the same interpreta tion of apege as ' eat', ' take '; but as Baker points out, apege is not, as these transla tions imply, a present subjunctive, but an imperative singular (the subjunctive form would be apecge). Taking the second part of the sentence as an instruction to the leech, with buteran and drince as dative nouns, Baker translates: i If one should eat poison, serve him with (i.e. feed him) butter and a liquid '. The chief justification for taking apecgan as ' to feed ' is its clear connection, as a causative verb, with picgan, ' to consume ' (usually ' to eat'): (-)pecgan ought to have the same relation to picgan as, say, lecgan, ' to lay ', has to licgan, ' to lie '. The question is complicated, however, by the fact that in the other contexts in which forms apparently from (-)pecgan occur, the verb concerned has strong connotations of oppression or destruction. In three cases, the verb evidently denotes the specific affliction of thirst (Leechdoms, hine Pegep purst; Christ 1509 purste gepegede; and Seasons of fasting 214 forpegide, purste gebaded), and in the fourth, Genesis 2002 ecgum ofpegde, the context requires the meaning ' oppressed ' or ' destroyed ',79 which 78 Baker, 'Ambiguity', pp 42-5; Henry Sweet, The student's dictionary of Anglo-Saxon (Oxford 1896), s.v. apecgan. 77 Thomas Oswald Cockayne (ed.), Leechdoms, wortcunning, and starcraft of early England (London, 1864-6), II, 154. 78 Toller, Supplement, s.v. apecgan. 79 It is possible that some or all of these forms supposedly from {-)pecgan are in fact parts of a different verb: see C. W. M. Grein, Sprachschatz der angelsachsischen Dichter (Cassel and Gottingen, 1861), s.v. gepegan, who suggests that gepegede in Christ 1509 is connected with the verb pewan, used in a closely analogous context in Paris Psalter 106.32.3 gedewde purste, ' oppressed by thirst'. It would certainly be an advantage if all the g forms considered here (pegep, forpegide, ofpegde and gepegede) could be assigned to pewan, ' oppress ', ' subjugate ', rather than to (-)pecgan, because the context in all cases seems to require some meaning such as this. The chief phonological difficulties standing in the way are the w(g variation in the stem, and the acknowledged obscurity of pewan\ etymology (on which see Eduard Sievers, Altenglische Grammatik (revised by Karl Brunner; Halle, 1942), ? 408, n. 12); pewan could be thenon-WS form of pywan, were it not for the fact that Gmc *pilwijan from whichpywan has been taken to derive (see A. Campbell, Old English grammar, ? 753(8), n. 2), will not easily account for pewan as well. The problem of these g forms, their relationship to the w forms and their meanings is a complex one to which I cannot do full justice here; but I should point out that some work in progress by Professor A. J. Bliss, to which he has generously allowed me access, provides a theoretical framework for removing the two main phonological difficulties, pywan and pewan would be explicable as forms of the same verb if they are taken to derive not from Gmc *puwijan but from *pawjan. *pawjan could have developed to OE *piewan, *pywan or * pewan by WGmc gemination of w before j, vocalisation of the first w, and /-mutation of the resulting diphthong au (OE ea) to te or e\ forms such as pewende and pywad are attested in OE (see Bosworth and Toller, Dictionary, s.v. peowan, pewan, etc.), and the verb iewan, ywan, ewan, ' to show ', certainly illustrates these processes. An alternative development of *pawjan to *piegan, *pygan or pegan was possible, however, if gemination failed and the original j of the stem was retained as g: cf. pegep, and the verb ciegan, cegan, ' to call ', which clearly has undergone this latter development. In parts of the verb such as the past tense and past participle which lacked original j, a different development would have taken place which is exemplified, according to Professsor Bliss's argument, by the verb stregan (the non-WS form of*strtegan, strygan), ' to strew ', for which the past tense forms strewede and streowede are attested. These forms are, for various reasons, best explained continued on p. 239</page><page sequence="17">Orton? Wulf and Eadwacer 239 is presumably why Sweet took apecgan in Wulf and Eadwacer in this sense. Baker speculates that the association with thirst is due to the existence of an original metaphorical phrase, ' " to serve someone with thirst " (as opposed to, say, ale) ', from which the meaning ' to parch ' (as in the Leechdoms instance) developed, but he is unable to bring any evidence forward in support of this idea. The possible analogy of the series drincan, ' to drink ', drencan, ' to give to drink ', ' to make drunk ', and adrencan, ' to drown ', suggests that apecgan might have a similar mean ing?c to drown ' or ' to choke '; but unfortunately this cannot be the meaning of apege in the Leechdoms passage. Because the evidence is so meagre and conflicting, Baker is driven to rely on the context of apecgan in Wulf and Eadwacer. He concludes that in line 2 it is temporarily ambiguous, open to interpretation either as ( feed ' or ' kill', but that the context of line 7 resolves this ambiguity in favour of ' kill': wulf's island is occupied by wtelreowe weras; and ' men described as walreow in Old English are often evil and nearly always hostile, so there is little chance that the men on the island mean to feed Wulf'.80 Although one must agree about the implications of walreowe, it is scarcely justifiable to rule out ' feed ' simply on contextual grounds, particularly as ' feed ' makes quite acceptable sense if lines 2 and 7 are taken (with Bradley)81 as questions (' Will they feed him . . .? ') rather than the statements they are usually taken to be: the implication of 15 meteliste, 'lack of food', is probably that the speaker has herself gone hungry;82 perhaps lines 2 and 7 are meant to suggest that wulf is hungry too, though the point of the question is grimly ironic; walreowe weras are less likely to sustain than attack him. Baker would dismiss the possibility that 2 and 7 are questions on the grounds of word order,83 but it is difficult to see what other word order could have been used to express the semantic content of the line in an interrogative form. The meaning of preat in lines 2 and 7 is also open to question, although the problem is less crucial. A choice is available between ' troop ', ' band ' on the one hand, and ' violence ', * compulsion ' on the other.84 On the whole, the first alterna tive is to be preferred, for if apecgan means * feed ' then ( violence ' or * compulsion ' would seem quite incongruous; and in the unlikely event that apecgan means 80 Baker, p. 45. 81 Bradley, review of Morley, p. 198. 821 agree with Frankis (' Conjectures ', p. 172, n. 33) that 15b nales meteliste ' is best interpreted not as an arbitrary comparison, but as an implication that the woman had actually been compelled by her circumstances to go short of food \ 83 Baker, p. 44. 84 See Bosworth and Toller, Dictionary, s.v. preat. continued from p. 238 as deriving from Gmc *strawi-, by {-mutation of Gmc a (OE a) to e and, in the case of streowede, breaking of e to eo by the following w?an explanation which, although in conflict with that of the standard grammars, would enable us to associate gedewde in the Paris Psalter (with syncopation of medial e: cf. eowde, an attested past tense oliewan, and also Paris Psalter 87.16 gedeowde) with gepegede and the other past forms with g which I quoted earlier, which are easily explained by analogy with an infinitive *pegan. The past participle gededum, which glosses subjugatis in the Corpus glossary, and other instances of ped- quoted in Bosworth and Toller are explicable as parts of pegan on the basis of a different and earlier analogical process: the existence of infinitives *pauwjan or *paujan in WGmc could have led to analogical past tenses *pauwid- or *pauid- which, after loss of w between a long syllable and i in the first case, would issue in OE *pied- or *ped-. This process is illustrated by forms of ciegan, cegan such as cede, ced, and by stred from stregan.

' (or perhaps ' into their midst') is the likeliest meaning of lines 2 and 7. This concludes my reconsideration of the textual evidence for animal characters in Wulf and Eadwacer. The evidence is not so decisive as to convince the most sceptical critics: there is a balance between two sets of terms, one animal in applica tion (wulf hwelp), the other human (leodum, weras); se beaducafa in 11 belongs to the second group, though it should, according to my interpretation, be viewed in the light of what I take to be the animal implications ofthe word bogum in the same line. This is the pivot upon which the two sets of terms rest, and the balance is so nearly perfect that it must surely be the product of deliberate planning, and perhaps represents an enigmatic purpose or conceit on the poet's part. Later I shall discuss the question of whether it is possible to read Wulf and Eadwacer as a kind of riddle;85 but what seems quite clear at this stage is that Sedgefield's interpretation of the poem has been far too hastily rejected by later critics, and deserves a full revaluation. The possibility?I think we should say the probability?that Wulf and Eadwacer is concerned at some level with wolves is impossible to ignore. Before I go any further, however, I should like to give fuller attention to two different explanations of the poem's animal language, both mentioned earlier in passing,86 which manage to maintain the humanity of the poem's characters. These are Sieper's theory that hwelp and bogum represent word-play on the name Wulf and E. G. Stanley's suggestion that all these words are to be explained somehow by reference to outlawry. V Sieper's word-play theory depends on wulf being a man, for if he is an animal no special explanation need be sought for his offspring being called hwelp and his limbs bogum. We have seen that it is by no means certain that wulf is a man; but if he is, what purpose could the poet have had in harping on the ambiguity of his name ? Certainly Wulf as a name might have been so unusual in the poet's day as to require some explanation, but in this case hwelp and bogum could only confuse matters further. Light-hearted punning on the name simply for its own sake can almost certainly be dismissed in view of the poem's consistently sombre mood. Those who subscribe to the theory that Eadwacer is a possessive or unloved husband or guardian of the speaker might argue that a more serious aim lies behind hwelp, as a hint to Eadwacer that the child he regards as his own is in fact wulf's; but this involves us in much speculation about matters (especially the character of Eadwacer as the supposed villain of the piece) on which the poet is silent. The second possibility is Stanley's theory that wulf is an outlaw, in which case hwelp and bogum might be read as a bitterly ironic comment by the speaker on wulf^s treatment at the hands of society. There is, as I mentioned earlier, little clear evidence that wulf is an outlaw;87 but if the humanity ofthe poem's characters is to be insisted upon, this interpretation has more to recommend it than Sieper's. It would explain the poet's choice of the name or by-name Wulf for the protagonist, s* Below, pp 253-4. 86 See above, pp 228, 229-30, 234. 8 7 See above, p. 228.</page><page sequence="19">O rton? Wulf and Eadwacer 2 41 which does, I would say, call for some explanation, always assuming that the poem does not allude to some story, familiar to the poet and his audience but unknown to us, in which a character of this name figured;88 but it seems on the whole doubtful if such an interpretation can offer adequate justification for the poet's use of hwelp and bogum. VI Sedgefield, as we have seen, took wulf literally as c wolf, and it seems natural to begin our revaluation of his interpretation by considering what the Anglo-Saxons are likely to have known of this animal. The several references in Old English poetry to the wolf as one of the scavenging beasts of battle are clearly traditional rather than realistic in character; doubtless no handling of this theme would have seemed complete without a reference to the wolf.89 But wolves were more than merely a literary convention in Anglo-Saxon England. The species did not become extinct in England until the end of the fifteenth century, and survived until the eighteenth in Scotland and Ireland.90 Documentary evidence to show that wolves were wide spread before the Norman Conquest is lacking; but several English place-names incorporating the element ' wolf' seem to testify to its early distribution. Among these are Woodale (earlier Wulvedal) in the North Riding of Yorkshire,91 Wooldale and Woolley (earlier Wiluelai) in the West Riding, and other Woolleys in Berkshire and Huntingdonshire. Place-names reflecting attempts to destroy or guard against wolves are Wolf Pit in Danby Chase on the North York Moors,92 Woolpit in both Suffolk and Surrey (Old English *wulfpytt, ' a trap for wolves ') and Wolvey in Warwickshire, probably from *wulfhege, ' enclosure to protect flocks from wolves or to trap wolves ', according to Ekwall.93 We should also notice the Old English common noun wulfseap, ' wolf pit', mentioned in the boundaries of a land grant by Oswald, bishop of Worcester (c. 985).94 Post-Conquest documentary evidence discredits the popular idea, recorded by Holinshed in the fifteenth century and deriving from William of Malmesbury, that the wolf was finally exterminated in England and Wales under Edgar in the tenth century.95 No doubt Edgar made 88 No close analogue to Wulf and Eadwacer has been discovered; for a summary of the main possibilities, see Lehmann, 'Metrics', p. 154fT. Correspondences, some of them striking, between the poem and the story of Sigmundr, Sign^, SinfjoUi and Siggeirr in Vqlsunga saga are noted and discussed by Henry Schofield, ' Signy's lament', P.M.L.A. 17 (1902), 262-95. 89 Instances of this theme are assembled by Francis P. Magoun Jr, ' The theme of the beasts of battle in Anglo-Saxon poetry ', NMi 56 (1955), 81*90. Ofthe twelve examples, the wolf is absent in only three (Genesis A 1983-5, Finns burg fragment 34-5, Battle of Maldon 106-7). See also Maxims I 146-51 for the wolf as both companion of the friendless and devourer of the slain. 90 See James Edmund Harting, British animals extinct within historic times (London, 1880), pp 115-205, esp. 204. 91 On this and the following names see Eilert Ekwall, The concise Oxford dictionary of English place names (4th ed., Oxford, 1960). 92 On Wolf Pit see Anthony Dent, Lost beasts of Britain (London, 1974), p. 104. 93 Ekwall, s.v.

Hardy (ed.), Willelmi Malmesbiriensis monachi gesta regum Anglorum, atque historia novella (London, 1840), I, p. 251. William says that the tribute ceased after three years because the Welsh king Judvall was unable to find any more wolves (nullum se ulterius posse invenire professus); Holinshed admits that wolves had been seen in England since Edgar's day, but identifies these as alien introductions.</page><page sequence="20">242 Proceedings of the Royal Irish Academy some impression on the problem of the wolf if, as William reports, he required his tribute from the Welsh in the form of three hundred wolf-pelts; but sufficient stock must have remained for the animal to recolonise many of its earlier haunts: wolves were common in, for example, the Forest of Riddesdale in Northumberland in the eleventh century; in the New Forest and Forest of Bere in Hampshire in the twelfth; in Richmond Forest, Yorkshire, in the twelfth and fourteenth centuries; in North amptonshire in the thirteenth century; in the Peak in Derbyshire in the fourteenth century; and in Sherwood Forest, Nottinghamshire, in the fifteenth century.96 Such a range seems unlikely to represent an expansion of the wolf's earlier distribution; as the medieval forests were gradually cleared, the species must surely have declined. It is probably safe to assume that its distribution in Anglo-Saxon times (at any rate, before Edgar's reign) was at least as wide as it was later on. I have already mentioned Sedgefield's idea of a dream or day-dream as the occasion of the speaker's narrative as one of the less convincing aspects of his interpretation.97 The connected idea that the speaker is a domestic bitch is similarly without any firm foundation in the text. If wulf is a wolf, then the speaker and her hwelp are surely wolves also. Perhaps the idea of a dog was suggested to Sedgefield by the term the speaker uses of her supposed ' lawful mate ', Eadwacer, which might evoke a watch-dog in any of its likeliest meanings (' property-watcher ', ' wakeful [one] ' or ' watchful of wealth or happiness ') ;98 but if, as I suggested, Eadwacer is the hwelp, the case for a domesticated speaker evaporates. Wolves were apparently sometimes tamed and made to serve men in medieval times,99 but there is no certain evidence in the text that the speaker is subject to human control or attached, even loosely, to any human settlement. Indeed, the few details we are given of the action's setting contain no clear sign of human habitation or cultivation. Two islands are mentioned (4-6), one of which, wulf's, is fast (probably 'firm', 'solid underfoot')100 and surrounded by 'fen', 'marsh' (Sfenne). There is little reason to suppose that this setting was invented purely for dramatic purposes; on the contrary, it may be entirely naturalistic. In other European countries marshes sometimes provide wolves with a stronghold,101 and certain hill- and place-names in the east of England, in areas which were fen or carr before drainage, may point to the early presence of wolves in just this type of terrain. 96 See Harting, British animals extinct, pp 134, 136-9, 144-5, 147. 97 See above, p. 224. 98 See above, p. 230, and note 39. 99 See Dent, Lost beasts, p. 115, n., and Alexander Neckham, De naturis rerum et de laudibus divime sapientia (ed. Thomas Wright), in Chronicles and memorials of Great Britain and Ireland during the Middle Ages, 34 (London, 1863), book 2, chap CXXXII, ' De lupo ', p. 213. 100 A few early commentators took 5 fast as adverbial; but Rieger (' t)ber Cynevulf', p. 219) and most later writers take it as an adjective. Meanings that have been suggested are ' inaccessible * (Hicketier, ' Fiinf Ratsel', p. 572: ' unzuganglich '); ' firm ' (Albert S. Cook, The Christ of Cynewulf (Boston, 1900), p. liii; W. W. Lawrence, * The first Riddle of Cynewulf*, p. 257); and ' fortified ' (Krapp and Dobbie, The Exeter Book, A.S.P.R. 3, p. 320). Against ' inaccessible * is the obvious fact that the eglond (4 iege) is accessible to both wulf and the walreowe weras: and ' fortified ' would suggest defence against an enemy whose identity is unclear. As Lawrence points out, a ' firm ' island would provide an apt contrast with the surrounding fen, though it is doubtful if there is any great significance in the use of eglond in this line, as opposed to iege (ige) in 4 and 9, as Lawrence supposes; there is no clear semantic distinction between these words in Old English generally. 101 See Dent, Lost beasts, p. 128.</page><page sequence="21">Orton? Wulf and Eadwacer 2 43 In the case of Woof ham Hill in the carrs of Lincolnshire, a few miles east of Kirton in-Lindsey, we have an early (c. 1200) form in Wlfholm, apparently ' Wolf Island \102 Probably a similar case is Woofel Hill near Leven in Holdemess in the East Riding of Yorkshire, recorded as Woof Hills in the last century,103 which is a small hill rising about twenty-five feet above the level of the flat country round about; but it was undoubtedly an island originally, surrounded by the mersshy contree of Holderness to which Chaucer refers in the opening lines of The summoneds tale. Woolfellhill Road in Northamptonshire, leading up a slight incline to the village of Eye near Peterbor ough and right on the edge of the fens, is recorded in an account of an eighteenth century perambulation of Borough Great Fen as Woolffenhills, on which form the editors of the Place-names Society volume for Northamptonshire comment:' Perhaps " wolf fen ", the modern form being corrupt \104 Eye is, of course, an interesting name in connection with Wulf and Eadwacer'. it occurs in a Latin charter dating from 970 in the forms Ege and sEge,106 the same word as iege (ige), 'island', in lines 4 and 6 of the poem. Naturally it is possible that the ' wolf' element in some or all of these names refeis to a person so called (the morphology and original significance of place-names are always difficult to establish for certain in the absence of very early forms or decisive external evidence of some kind), but the conjunction here of the element with fenland, and particularly with the kind of fen-island described in Wulf and Eadwacer, is probably significant. It seems, therefore, that there is nothing historically improbable about an Old English poem on the subject of wolves, and that the setting as described in the poem is quite appropriate to the wolf species, according to what we can deduce about its habitat as a native English animal. I turn now to the characters themselves, to what the text tells us of their relationships, and the parts they play in the action of the poem. vn From this point on, my interpretation of Wulf and Eadwacer will diverge consider ably from Sedgefield's, and it may be helpful to summarise here the departures from his interpretation which I have already proposed. The speaker of the poem I take to be a wild bitch-wolf, not a domestic dog as Sedgefield took her to be. She has mated with wulf, also called se beaducafa, a wild dog-wolf, and a cub (hwelp) 102 Woof ham Hill is so marked on the Ordnance Survey 2i-inch edition (sheet SK 99, 1953), though the one-inch edition marks only a Woofham Farm in the same spot.

Eye.</page><page sequence="22">2 44 Proceedings of the Royal Irish Academy called Eadwacer has resulted from the union. The speaker's ' lawful mate ', which Sedgefield identified in Eadwacer, does not, I believe, exist. The speaker is not dreaming or fantasising, as Sedgefield supposed, but simply reflecting on her relationship with wulf, once calling out to him directly (lines 13-16). The w&amp;lreowe weras of line 6, who are also the speaker's leode (' tribe ', ' people '), are not her human masters, as Sedgefield thought, but a group of individuals (probably wolves) who intend to harm and probably kill wulf if he falls amongst them (I am assuming that if apecgan means ' feed ', lines 2 and 7 are ironic questions). At the heart of the poem's meaning is the relationship between the speaker and wulf. The chief cause of the speaker's distress is plainly her separation from wulf, her mate. She is depressed (15 murnende mod, 'sorrowful heart') by his seldcymas (' rare visits ', but perhaps expressive by litotes of his invariable absence) to the point of illness (14 seoce). That she is emotionally, rather than materially, deprived is emphasised by her explicit elimination of meteliste (15, ' want of food ') as the cause of her misery.106 But what was the reason for her original separation from wulf, and why will he not return to her ? The answers to these questions are perhaps suggested by the crucial first line of Wulf and Eadwacer, which has always proved difficult to interpret.107 Lines 1-2 of the poem read as follows: Leodum is minum swylce him mon lac gife; willa5 hy hine apecgan, gif he on Jpreat cymed. * It is as if someone gave my people a gift (or sacrifice). Will they feed him if he comes into their midst ? ' The chief questions raised here are the interrelations between the speaker, her leode, and wulf, and what it is that is comparable with a gift or sacrifice. Evidently the circumstances of the speaker's people are in some way fortunate, though the contrast with the speaker's own plight is quite clearly drawn: despite her membership of the tribe (minum), she is excluded from the general good fortune, and the explanation for this must, I think, be sought in the relations between her and wulf on the one hand, and between wulf and her tribe on the other. We have seen that wulf is in all likelihood in danger of attack from the speaker's tribe who, according to the inter pretation I favoured earlier, are a pack of wolves. The reason for this hostility is nowhere stated, but the implication of line 1 is that it is partly, at least, the enmity of the group towards an outsider. The speaker uses minum, ' my ', of her leode, not ' our ', which might imply that wulf is not a member but an interloper. The speaker clearly regards wulf as belonging only to her (9 Wulfes... mines, 13 Wulf, min Wulf), so perhaps there is a contrast between tribal allegiance (1, 'my people') and emotional or personal ties (' My wolf, as opposed to anyone else's). According to this interpretation, the speaker's predicament seems to be closely analogous with the traditional dilemma of the heroine in Germanic literature, caught up unwillingly in a conflict between her kin and her husband.108 Perhaps all the speaker's troubles 106 See note 83 above. 107 See Lehmann, ' Metrics ', pp 157-8, for previous theories. 108 Examples are Hildeburh, wife of Finn and sister of Hnaef, in the Finnsburh digression in Beowulf (see J. R. R. Tolkien, Finn and Hengest: the fragment and the episode (ed. Alan Bliss) (London, 1982), pp 159-62), and Gudrun, wife of Sigurd and sister of Guttorm, Gunnar and Hogni in Volsunga saga (see R. G. Finch (ed.), The saga of the Volsungs (London, 1965), pp 57-61).</page><page sequence="23">Orton? Wulf and Eadwacer 245 stem from her mating with wulf, a non-member of her own pack, and her ambiguous response to wulf's embrace (12 was me wyn to pon, was me hwtepre eac lad, ' there was pleasure for me in that, but nonetheless it was also hateful to me ') may be very satisfactorily explained on this basis: she was naturally reluctant to submit to the advances of an unfamiliar outsider, but the union was nevertheless a thoroughly satisfactory one in strictly personal terms. Two points of wolf biology are of interest in this connection. The first is that, although mating patterns amongst wolves are still not fully understood, there is a strong suspicion that mating within the pack (between brother and sister, for example) is the rule rather than the exception; and secondly, the hostility of wolf-packs to intruders from other packs or to lone wolves is well documented: the intruder is energetically chased off and sometimes wounded.109 Both these aspects of normal lupine behaviour fit the situation the poem describes rather well; and the second suggests that lac in line 1 might be better interpreted as ' sacrifice ' than ' gift ',110 for it is surely an apt simile for wulf It is to be expected that wulf, the interloper, will gravitate naturally towards his mate; but he is rejected by the rest ofthe pack, and is indeed in danger from them. Doubtless the rarity of his visits (or his invariable absence), the cause ofthe speaker's languish ing, is attributable to the threat of attack whenever he approaches her; but he has no hostile purpose, and so from the pack's point of view he comes like a lamb to the slaughter. The part played by the hwelp in the action is much more obscure. Earlier I argued that the hwelp is the offspring of the speaker and wulf, and this seems to me a reason ably safe assumption. The meaning of the adjective earne in line 16 is obviously of great importance for an understanding ofthe hwelp's role; but if, as I have suggested, earne is a form ofeargne, ' cowardly ', and Bired wulf to wuda refers to an action ofthe hwelp's towards wulf, certain inferences can be drawn. One is that the hwelp's role is a shameful one in the speaker's eyes, so that line 17 probably does not describe the hwelp's rescue of his father from the clutches of his attackers. The alternative possibility is that the hwelp is acting in conjunction with the walreowe weras against its father, and it is this that leads the speaker to condemn him as ' cowardly ': he is guilty, potentially, of patricide. In what sense, therefore, will the hwelp ' carry' (Bired) his father ' to the wood ' ? When the direct object is a material object or person, the verb beran normally has the literal meaning of ' carry ' (or * wear ' in the case of clothing, armour, etc.) in Old English.111 ' Bring ' is sometimes a possible translation, but even in these cases there is seldom any doubt that the object of the verb is actually carried. It seems, therefore, that we must envisage the hwelp as carrying, or perhaps dragging, his father; we cannot easily assume that Bired has some less specific meaning such as ' bring '?that the hwelp escorts or decoys wulf to the wood, for instance, or persuades him to accompany him there. Much else remains unclear, however. Woods are the traditional haunt of wolves in Old English verse, the habitat from which they emerge to feast on those slain in battle (cf. Elene 28; The battle of Brunanburh 65 wulf on wealde, ' the wolf in the wood '; 109 See L. David Mech, The wolf: the ecology and behavior of an endangered species (New York, 1970), pp 103-4, 111. 110 See Bosworth and Toller, Dictionary and Supplement, s.v. lac. 111 Ibid., s.v. beran.</page><page sequence="24">246 Proceedings of the Royal Irish Academy Elene 112-13 wulf. . . holtes gehleda, s the wolf, companion of the forest', etc.), so to wuda in Wulf and Eadwacer is not particularly helpful for a detailed understanding of the circumstances. Obviously there is room for speculation here, but I suggest the possibility that line 17 anticipates the division of wulf's corpse among the members of the pack. In The wanderer we find a description of one of the birds of battle (either the raven or the eagle) carrying a corpse away across the sea (81b-2a sumne fugel opbar ofer heanne holm, ' one a bird carried off over the deep sea') :112 perhaps in Wulf and Eadwacer we should envisage the ' cowardly ' hwelp treacherously drawing wulf towards the pack by his howling; the speaker, recognising this ploy, calls out to wulf (Gehyrest pu), though the fact that she wonders if wulf can hear the hwelp*$ howling suggests that she herself may have little hope of warning him of the danger he faces. If so, this would explain her return to soliloquy in line 17, as she reflects miserably on the likelihood of wulf9 s destruction (' He will carry wulf to the wood '). vm I turn next to some problems of interpretation in Wulf and Eadwacer which I have so far neglected. Most of what I have to say in this section will be about lines 18-19, with which the poem ends; but I begin with line 3 Ungelic is us, repeated in a slightly different form in 8 Ungelice is us, which has attracted a bewildering variety of inter pretations. Frankis has said of this line almost all that can be said with confidence: that it ' emphasises unlikeness and proclaims a contrast \113 Isaacs makes the point that the general plural dative pronouns (us, as distinct from the dual une) ' probably indicate a " we " of more than two people ',114 in view of the poet's use of dual pronouns elsewhere (16 uncerne, 19 uncer). The main problem of interpretation is whether the speaker contrasts herself as an individual with other characters, or as one of a number of individuals with another character or characters, and who the contrasted parties are. Almost every possible permutation has been suggested at some time or another since the poem first attracted literary interpretation in the last century. Gollancz believed that the speaker is contrasting herself with her leode (' 'Tis otherwise with me!'),115 whereas Bradley (' It is otherwise with us')116 seems to have thought that the situation of the speaker and wulf is contrasted with some other situation. Malene took the contrast to be between the speaker and her husband Eadwacer on the one hand, and the speaker's leode on the other (again,' It is otherwise with us') ;117 and Keough, by taking Ungelic in the sense of ' uncharacteristic', arrives at the translation: ' It is unlike us ' (i.e. not the behaviour to be expected of us).118 Only Kavros makes any distinction between the meanings of lines 3 and 8 on the basis of the final e of Ungelice in 8 only, possibly an adverbial suffix: he translates 112 The passage is discussed fully by Dunning and Bliss, pp 119-20. 113 Frankisj ' Conjectures ', p. 172. 114 Neil D. Isaacs, Structural principles in Old English poetry (Knoxville, 1968), p. 115. Baker (' The ambiguity of Wulf and Eadwacer ', pp 45-6) questions this point on the grounds that iElfric uses plural forms with dual meaning. 115 Gollancz, * Monodrama', p. 883. 116 Bradley, review of Morley, p. 198. 117 Malone, e Frauenlieder ', p. 108. 118 Keough, * Tension of separation ', p. 554.</page><page sequence="25">Orton?Wulf and Eadwacer 247 3 as ' We are different' and 8 as ' Things go differently with respect to us ' ('we' and ' us ' referring to the speaker and her leode in both cases).119 Obviously the variety of translations is partly a reflection of the variety of identifications ofthe contrasted parties, but some of these translations seem unjustifi ably loose. Perhaps the closest we can get to the meaning of Ungelic is us is ' It is different for us'; Ungelice is us may mean * It is otherwise for us' if Ungelice is adverbial, but so far as the nature of the contrast and the identity of the contrasted parties are concerned there is probably no difference between the two verses. The contrast could be between the fortunes of different groups or individuals (between the fortunate leode and the speaker, for example), or between families or races (between wulfa.nd the speaker's leode, for example), and it seems to me that the context cannot settle the problem. In the poem as I interpret it, however, one would expect a contrast either between the speaker and her leode on the one hand and wulf on the other, or between the speaker and wulf on the one hand and the leode on the other. Wulf and the speaker seem equally isolated, though in different ways, so the question should probably be left open. An even more intractable problem is posed by the form dogode in line 9, Wulfes ic mines widlastum wenum dogode. Dogode is presumably a singular past tense of a weak verb ofthe second class, *dogian; but no other forms of *dogian occur in Old English, and there are no recognisable cognates in any other Germanic language.120 This explains the popularity of Hicketier's emendation hogode, ' thought of', ' was mindful of'.121 Most of those who retain dogode assume some meaning such as * suffer', ' endure ', though purely on the basis of the context.122 There have been two recent attempts to relate dogode to the verb dow, recorded in the sixteenth century in the sense ' to lose brightness or freshness; to fade; to become dull or musty; to fall into a sleepy state ', and in the fifteenth century as ' to press, squeeze, wring ', though none of these meanings suits the context in Wulf and Eadwacer.123 Emendation to hogode, on the other hand, is difficult to justify: it puts a meaning into the text where none is apparent, but an error d for h is unlikely palaeographically. The context suggests that' was mindful of' may well have a good deal in common with the poet's intended meaning, but even this is not certain. It seems best to retain dogode in the text in the hope that an explanation of a verb *dogian may be forthcoming rather than dismiss it as a copying error. I turn finally to the last two lines of Wulf and Eadwacer (18-19), which read as follows: f&gt;aet mon eaj)e toslited f&gt;aette naefre gesomnad wses, uncer giedd geador. Of the numerous translations that have been made of these lines, Malone's is fairly representative: 119 Harry E. Kavros, ' A note on Wulf and Eadwacer', Engl. Lang.

More important variations occur in translations of 19 uncer giedd geador: Malone's ' our song together ' is the most popular, but Bradley, followed by Gordon, has ' the song of us two together ', a difference I shall comment on later.128 For giedd most translators have ' song ', though other meanings are given to it in certain freer translations, such as Raffel's ' It's easy to smash what never existed, you and I together ',129 Whitbread's ' One easily ends (divides) what was never joined, the tale of us two together ',130 Eliason's ' It is easy to separate something which has never been properly combined, such as our joint poetic endeavour ',131 and (for line 19) Adams's ' our bond is this riddle ',132 Bouman's ' our love-talk together '133 and Fanagan's ' the story of our " together ness " \134 Two fairly recent comments on these lines, to which I shall wish to refer later, may also be mentioned at this point. The first is Frankis's suggestion that line 18 alludes to the Gospel teaching on marriage, Quod ergo Deus coniunxit, homo non separet (Matthew 19.6, Mark 10.9).135 Two later writers, Keough and Spamer, make the same point independently of Frankis (and of each other), adding that the verbs toslitan and samnian used in Wulf and Eadwacer 18 both appear (though never together) in certain Old English glosses of the biblical verse.136 Spamer is alone in asserting categorically that the poem's lines ' are intended as an allusion to ' the biblical verse, and more precisely to its use in the marriage service.137 According to Frankis, line 18 ' presumably implies that the woman speaking was never married to Wulf'.138 Keough takes a similar view, but Spamer understands it to refer to the speaker and Eadwacer: ' The marriage [between these two] is repudiated (or denied) because the woman wishes to justify her claim to love Wulf (Wulf, min Wulf, 1. 13) \139 124 Malone, ' Frauenlieder ', p. 108. 125 Sedgefield, ' Wulf and Eadwacer \ p. 74. 126 T.

Wulf and Eadwacer 2 49 The second important comment on these lines comes from Renoir, who finds a double contradiction in them: The sentence is composed of a series of semantically contradictory phrases which, even out of context, convey a sense of hopeless struggle. Clearly, one cannot tear apart (mon . . . toslited) some thing that never was put together (pat. .. p&lt;ette ncefre gesomnad was); and, literally speaking, that which never was together cannot be the song of two people together (uncer giedd geador). Yet the total statement assures us that this is the case and that under the circumstances it can be done easily (eape).uo Renoir would resolve these apparent contradictions by assuming that there are two levels of meaning here, the physical and the emotional: . . the persons concerned may be either physically united but emotionally separated or vice-versa. In any case, things are not as the speaker would want them, and the tension created by this rhetorical union of disunion is, I believe, the key to the passionate poignancy which critics have admired in the poem.141 Returning now to the lines themselves, and to Malone's translation of them, the first thing we should remark on is the apparent incongruity between the actions of tearing and joining on the one hand, and a poem, song or tale as the affected object on the other. How does one 'tear apart', or indeed cjoin', a giedd? The same question is raised by most of the translations I have quoted above. But here we must notice that Malone takes giedd as a metaphor for ' union in love ';142 he also adds that ' the emendation gad, " union ", " fellowship ", proposed by G. Herzfeld, brings out the literal sense with perfect clarity '. Here, then, is another metaphorical interpretation to match that of hwelp in line 16; and again, reference to the dictionaries reveals that giedd occurs nowhere else in Old English as a metaphor, neither for a ' union ' nor for anything else. Its usual meaning is ' story ', ' tale ', and in more specialised contexts may be rendered as ' poem ', ' proverb ', ' riddle ', ' sermon ' or ' speech \143 The metaphorical interpretation of giedd here is a fairly general one, as far as one can tell from translations and comments on the lines in question: it is often impossible, however, to decide in what sense, literal or meta phorical, translators would have us understand this so-called ' song \144 However, accepting for the moment that giedd is indeed a metaphor (for a liaison or marriage between the speaker and someone else), the problem I raised at the beginning of this paragraph still remains: the verbs toslited and gesomnad ought to participate in the metaphorical expression, for they are parts of the same sentence as giedd and denote actions which directly affect it. Most translations, however, render these 140 Renoir, * Noninterpretation ', p. 149. 141 hoc. cit. 142 Malone, ' Frauenlieder ', p. 110. 143 See Bosworth and Toller, Dictionary, s.v. gid. 144 Definite exceptions are Sedgefield, and Eliason, Adams and Bouman, whose translations are quoted above, p. 248. Another literal interpretation of giedd is Fry's in ' Wulf and Eadwacer: a wen charm ', p. 262.</page><page sequence="28">250 Proceedings of the Royal Irish Academy verbs in such a way as to arouse the expectation that the affected object is to be a literal, rather than a metaphorical, ' union ' or ' fellowship ', which goes a long way towards explaining the popularity of the emendation gad for giedd. In other words, most translations of these lines, particularly those which adopt ' our song together ' for 19, illustrate a variation on the unsustained metaphor which we might christen ' the unanticipated metaphor \ It seems clear that we are bound to give careful consideration to the possibility that 19 giedd, ' tale ', ' story ', is non-figurative, and to consider afresh the meanings of the two verbs toslited and gesomnad in 18 in relation to actions affecting songs or poems. Toslitan occurs in Waerferth's Old English translation of Gregory's Dialogues, in the following context: ?&gt;a faeringa ongan se ilea cniht clypian to pam aetstandendum brodrum i mid hludum stefnum toslitan -j amyrran ?ara brodra sangas -j gebedu J)us cwefende :145 * Then suddenly this same boy began to call out to those brothers standing nearby, interrupting and disturbing with his shouting the songs and prayers of the brothers, saying thus:'. For toslitan 1 amyrran the Latin has only interrumpere, though Toller's translation of toslitan as ' interrupt' seems reasonable.146 Samnian (somnian) is used twice in Old English verse for the business of putting together the subject-matter of poems, in The phesnix 547 and The fates of the Apostles 2:147 Ne wene J&gt;aes aenig aelda cynnes J&gt;aet ic lygewordum leod somnige, write wodcraefte. ' Let none of the race of men think that I compose this song, write with poetic art, of falsehoods ' Hwaet! ic f&gt;ysne sang sidgeomor fand on seocum sefan, samnode wide, hu pa aedelingas ellen cyddon, c Behold! Weary of life and from a troubled heart I devised this song, found out (or assembled it) from far and wide, how the noble retainers displayed courage '. In The phoenix 547, somnige must mean ' compose ' or ' assemble '; but Fates 2 samnode means ' learned ', ' found out', if we assume that the hu-c\ause in 3 is the sole object of the verb. However, it seems likelier that 1 sang is the object of both the verbs fand and samnode, and that the Aw-clause is in apposition to sang, in which case a 145 Cited in Toller, Supplement, s.v. toslitan.

In both passages, the use of samnian serves to emphasise the side of Old English poetic composition that corresponds roughly with the inventio of classical rhetoric. If toslited and gesomnad in Wulf and Eadwacer 18 are understood in these senses, a preliminary translation of line 18 might be: 'It is easy to interrupt that which has never been put together '. It will be noted that there is almost as much semantic contradiction in this translation as Renoir finds in the reading he adopts. The idea of interruption implies something which would have been completed had not the interruption occurred; but it is difficult to regard something which has never been ' put together ' as susceptible to interruption. However, the part of the sentence constituted by line 19 has yet to be accommodated to this preliminary translation of 18. The pronoun pcet almost certainly anticipates 19 giedd,14* and we must now decide what the referent of giedd might be if it refers literally to a ' story ' or ' tale '. As we have seen, the most popular translation of line 19 is * our song together ', implying either a performance a deux or (though this seems less probable) a joint composition. In this translation geador, ' together ', modifies the action of singing implied by giedd, rendered ' song '. An alternative possibility, more compelling than this if giedd is rendered ' story ' or ' tale ', is that uncer means ' about us two ' rather than ' by us two ', and that geador refers to the relationship between the speaker and wulf as Bradley's version, ' the song of us two together ', was perhaps meant to suggest. Examples of usage of giedd in other Old English poems cannot help us very much here, for there are no other instances of the word used with geador or governed by a possessive, though the idea of a giedd on the subject of (be) a particular individual who is also the speaker of the poem is familiar from the opening lines of The wife's lament and The seafarer. A firm decision between the two possibilities is difficult but three considerations seem to favour the second?that uncer . . . geador means ' about us two together ' (or ' about the pair of us ') rather than ' performed (or composed) by the two of us '. Firstly, if, as I have argued, the ideas of interrupting and assembling (of materials for a giedd) are present in these lines; secondly, if giedd is to be construed literally; and thirdly, in view of the fact that lines 18-19 bring the poem to a close, much points to the giedd being Wulf and Eadwacer itself, rather than some purely hypothetical story. In this connection we might recall the passages quoted earlier from The phcenix and The fates of the Apostles, in which leod and sang (both ' song ', and both objects of forms of samnian) refer respectively to the works in which they appear. If this interpretation of giedd in Wulf and Eadwacer is correct, then the idea of a joint performance can probably be eliminated, for the poem is fairly clearly the utterance of a single individual. We are now in a position to complete the translation of lines 18-19 as: ' It is easy to interrupt that which has never been put together, (this) story about the pair of us \ This interpretation of lines 18-19 has wider implications for the general interpre tation of the poem; but I return first to the question of the possible influence of the biblical verse Quod ergo Deus coniunxit, homo non separet on these lines. The chief 148 Isaacs (Structural principles in Old English poetry, pp 116-17) thinks that the relative clause in 18b may refer back to mon, but this seems most unlikely;</page><page sequence="30">252 Proceedings of the Royal Irish Academy weakness of the theory that the poet intended an allusion to this verse is that the verbs he uses, toslitan and samnian, never occur together in any Old English rendering of the Gospel verse: there is thus no evidence that they were ever associated in combination with this verse by any Anglo-Saxon, and Spamer's certainty about the connection is unjustified. The case for such a link would, of course, draw strength from the assumption that uncer giedd geador belongs to the same field of figurative expression as modern English metaphors of the order of 'to make sweet music together ' (i.e. to be romantically involved)?an assumption which may well have contributed to the idea of allusion to the biblical verse. But this seems impossible to defend. If the narrative of Wulf and Eadwacer is interrupted, the question arises of who or what interrupts it. There seem to be two main possibilities. Perhaps the story is broken off because of external interference, in which case the incident referred to in line 16?the howling by which the speaker identifies her own hwelp, according to my interpretation?must be responsible; and we may compare the passage from the Dialogues, quoted earlier, in which the interruption is by noise. This in turn suggests the idea that Wulf and Eadwacer is formally an oral utterance rather than a literary text. But the problem is complicated by the notion of a story the subject matter of which has not been fully ' put together ' or ' assembled '. The speaker is surely not simply drawing attention to her own negligence as a story-teller, and so perhaps the main point of her remark that it is easy to interrupt a story the subject matter of which is incomplete is that developments have overtaken her narrative. Even as she speaks, things are still happening which would find a place in her giedd in its ideal, complete form. For Renoir's semantic ambiguity I suggest irony as a substitute. Naturally it is impossible to complete a story if all the facts are not available to the teller; but if the story is about oneself, told at a time of personal crisis, there can be no genuine ending. Possibly these final lines of the poem express the speaker's awareness of this. Perhaps, too, there is an implication that poetry is generally geared to historical narrative, rather than to the expression of the unassimil ated experience of the poet himself, caught up in a changeable situation at a random moment in time. IX Below I present a translation ofthe whole of Wulf and Eadwacer, followed by some comments on hitherto-unmentioned difficulties of interpretation and other outstand ing problems. It is as if someone gave my people a sacrifice. Will they feed him if he comes into their midst ? It is different for us. Wolf is on an island, I on another. 5 Firm is that island, surrounded by fen. There are bloodthirsty men there on that island; Will they feed him if he comes into their midst ? It is different for us. In my thoughts I dogode (? in) my Wolf's wide-ranging tracks</page><page sequence="31">Orton? Wulf and Eadwacer 253 10 when it was rainy weather, and I sat lamenting. When the battle-prompt (one) embraced me, there was pleasure for me in that, but nonetheless it was also hateful to me. My Wolf, Wolf, it is expectation of you that has made me ill, your rare visits; 15 a sorrowing heart, not lack of food. Do you hear Eadwacer, our cowardly whelp ? He will carry Wolf to the wood. What has never been put together is easily interrupted, this tale of the pair of us. I leave dogode untranslated because no translation would be anything more than a guess; but my treatment of the remainder of the line is also conjectural because of dogode's obscurity. In lines 9-12 I take both the ponne-clauses (10, 11) as subordin ate ' when '-clauses, whereas some translators take the second as principal and correlative with the first; but the final position ofthe verb in 11 suggests a subordinate clause. Also contrary to the usual practice is my subordination of the ponne-c\a.me in 10 to the preceding principal clause in 9: 10 ponne, ' when ', is usually taken either as dependent on 11 as a principal clause, or as dependent, along with 11 as a sub ordinate clause, on 12 was me wyn, etc. My arrangement follows Rieger and some other early critics, amongst them Bradley.149 Finally, it is not quite certain that 15 murnende mod, ' a sorrowing heart', is nominative and parallel with 13 wena (pi.), ? expectation', as I have translated it; some take it as accusative and parallel with accusative seoce in 14.150 X In the final section of this paper I want to consider some of the literary and historical implications of my interpretation of Wulf and Eadwacer. The general tendency of critics to minimise or ignore the evidence for animal characters in the poem is understandable from one point of view, for it leads us into difficult, if not entirely unfamiliar, country. What kind of work are we faced with if all its characters are, as I have suggested, wolves? Sedgefield thought ofthe poem as a riddle in all essential respects151?an identification which, though unsatisfactory in my view, would solve several problems. Most readers have regarded the poem as deliberately enigmatic, and its position in the manuscript, just before the first group of Riddles, suggests that at least one medieval reader?the compiler of the Exeter Book collection of texts?thought of the poem as one of the Riddles, or as akin to them in some way. Furthermore, several of the Exeter Book Riddles are in the form of speeches by personified animals or birds of various species; if this is true of Wulf and Eadwacer, another point of correspondence with the Riddles would be the use ofc heroic ' designations such as se beaducafa and walreowe weras for non-human characters. Even Wulf and Eadwacer\ focus on a well-defined episode in the lives of its characters?the period of estrangement from wulf endured by the speaker, 149 Rieger, ' Uber Cynevulf', p. 219; Bradley, review of Morley, p. 198. 150 See, for example, Frankis, ' Conjectures', p. 172, whose omission of a comma after 14 seldcymas seems to imply that mod is accusative. 151 See above, p. 224.</page><page sequence="32">254 Proceedings of the Royal Irish Academy and the immediate threat to the former?finds a parallel in Riddle 15 (' Badger' or ' Fox '), where the attack on the speaker's litter by the predator is elaborated beyond the requirements of the form in what is, admittedly, a rather exceptional passage. There is, however, one obvious objection to Wulf and Eadwacer as a c wolf' or * wolves ' riddle: two of the characters are referred to as wulf and hwelp: the * solution ' is not disguised. Other differences between Wulf and Eadwacer and the Riddles lie in the contribution that personification makes to meaning. In those Riddles which employ this device, it serves to mask the identity of the solution and mystify the reader. Our attention is taken up with solving the puzzle; and although we may be perplexed or amused by the queerly semi-human or supernatural beings which these poems might seem to be describing on the surface, we accept this element of artificiality or monstrosity as a rhetorical means to an end, at least until, satisfied with a solution, we are in a position to stand back and appreciate the poet's ingenuity. These remarks hold good for most personification Riddles, but there are a few passages among them in which we may observe a tendency to develop and elaborate personi fication to a supererogatory degree. Riddle 15 has already been mentioned as an illustration of this spirit of bravura; another is Riddle 93, ' Inkhorn ', which I have discussed elsewhere in relation to both The dream of the rood and The husband's message as works of personification.152 In these four poems, analogies between the existence of a personified object or creature and human life are more fully developed than in most Riddles, to a degree that a distinct phenomenon occurs whereby the ostensibly figurative language of personification takes on a non-figurative aspect. The force of analogy is such that personification ceases to be merely a ' vehicle ' (to borrow I. A. Richards's terminology for describing the workings of metaphor)153 for the ' tenor ' of the solution or base-object; actual humanisation occurs, if only sporadic ally and momentarily, so that one responds to the speaker as if it were genuinely human. This is perhaps most clearly exemplified in The dream of the rood, where the speaking cross embodies the suffering humanity of Christ;154 and as a counterbalance, so to speak, to this exaggerated sense of humanity in the speaker, the element of mystification is withdrawn, so that the cross refers directly to its own identity as gealgan, ' gallows ' (40), or rod, ' cross ' (44). Similarly, in The husband's message, the rune-staff makes no secret of its identity as an engraved beam, ' piece of wood ' (13). Where does Wulf and Eadwacer, if read as a wolf poem, stand in relation to these other personification poems in Old English? In identifying its characters openly, it is closer to The dream of the rood and The husband's message than to the Riddles; but interest in the former two poems is ultimately directed not towards the objects as such, but rather towards their role as adjuncts in a drama involving unambiguously human characters?the dreamer, Christ and his followers and the soldiers in The dream of the rood, and the lord and his beloved in The husband's message, for whom the rune-staff acts as go-between. Humanity is very much at the centre of things in 152 P. R. Orton, ' The speaker in The husband's message', Leeds Stud.

Wulf and Eadwacer 255 these poems, and the humanisation of the speaking objects is achieved as much by their close association with humans and human affairs as by the rhetorical device of prosopopoeia; but in Wulf and Eadwacer, according to the interpretation I have put forward here, human society is not even visible on the fringes of the poem's world. This complete lack of reference to human society is what separates Wulf and Eadwacer from these and other poems, and it is congruent with the poet's fully anthropomorphic conception of the wolves themselves. In the absence of the standard of genuine humanity, to which, by contrast, the non-human can only approximate, the way is clear for anthropomorphism proper, as opposed to mere ' personification '. In fact, the impression of exclusively human emotional complexities?everything that con tributes to the e poignancy ' which Renoir and others have found in the poem155? is so powerful as almost to obliterate awareness that the poem is not, on the face of it, about human beings at all. The generally negative reaction to Sedgefield's reading of the poem testifies to this quality in it. The speaker's predicament, her feelings and manner of expression draw the poem closer in spirit to The wife's lament than to any of the other personification poems in Old English; but valid though this analogy may be, it is not evidence in favour of human characters. R. M. Wilson's remarks on the characteristics of humanised animals in medieval beast tales apply just as well to Wulf and Eadwacer: Knowing nothing of the thoughts or feelings of the animals themselves the author of a beast tale, if he is to tell any story at all, must invest his characters with human attributes. In the Middle Ages it was inevitable that the author's contemporaries should serve as his models, and that he should attribute to his animal characters the thoughts and actions which would be natural to the people of the period.156 In our poem, doubtless one of the author's chief models was a literary one?the Old English personal lyric. Another probable influence was heroic narrative, if the analogy I drew earlier between the speaker's situation and that of the typical Germanic heroine is valid.157 The sense of incongruity involved in the assumption of animal characters is lessened if we can accept that these characters, once ' anthropomorphically conceived ',158 fell naturally into the conventional, lyrical mode of expression. The question of distinctively wolvish emotions did not arise. Not that the animal nature ofthe characters is completely ignored or submerged: the reader's credulity is not here stretched to breaking-point, as it is by those more familiar fables and folk-tales in which wolves put on human clothing and pass for shepherds or grandmothers. Wulf and Eadwacer's wolves remain wolves in shape (bogum), and there is more than a hint of their overriding instincts, possibly in 2, 7 apecgan (if this means ' to feed '), and certainly in 15 meteliste, ' lack of food ', denied by the speaker as the cause of her sickness as if confounding natural expectations. The possibility of naturalism in the poem's setting, and in some aspects cf the 155 See above, p. 249. 156 R. M.

It is of course in the nature of anthropomorphism to draw false analogies between human and non-human nature, but it is difficult to gauge the degree of the poet's sophistication in matters like this. One would like to know, for example, if the Anglo-Saxons recognised the monogamous but highly sociable nature of the wolf, which, most authorities believe, shows powerful mate preferences while retaining a strong sense of wider family ties;159 but it is probably safe to assume that a people to whom wolves were a pest, and who trapped them, could not have been ignorant of their basic natural history?their intelligence and gregariousness, for example. If, as I have argued, Wulf and Eadwacer is not a riddle but is anthropomorphic, lyrical and in one sense heroic, the question of its genre still remains unanswered. But I think it will have to be admitted sooner or later that the poem belongs to no one known medieval genre. Bestiary, beast fable and beast epic, most of which enter English literary tradition at a later date, seem to contain nothing even remotely comparable with it. But I suggest that there are stylistic connections with the Old English Riddles and the other personification poems mentioned earlier, similarities of mood and style with the Old English lyrics (particularly The wife's lament), and a probable thematic link (in the clash of loyalties to husband and kin experienced by the speaker) with heroic narrative. Unique though it undoubtedly is, Wulf and Eadwacer does not stand completely apart from the Old English poetic tradition. What remains elusive to the modern reader is the point of the poem, particularly the point of its form. But here part of the trouble perhaps stems from our preconcep tions about ' animal' literature. Any work of literature in which the non-human is made to behave in a human fashion is, in a sense, allegorical: such a work will inevitably betray human perspectives on the world, for if human gifts are lent to creatures or objects the loan will be repaid in kind. A book like, for instance, Beatrix Potter's The tale of Peter Rabbit is as much about children as it is about rabbits. But the modern critic, if he is to take such a work seriously, expects repayment with interest as the price of his ' suspension of disbelief'. He may, to take an example, feel well-disposed towards a recent interpretation of the Middle English poem The owl and the nightingale as ' a burlesque-satire on human contentiousness ',160 chiefly because it emphasises the qualities we feel we ought to value most in the poem: it brings out the degree to which the birds are vehicles for human folly, rather than simply birds, and also provides the vital return on the poet's investment of human traits in the birds in the form of the serious literary aim of' burlesque-satire '. Our problem with Wulf and Eadwacer, if we read it as a poem about wolves, is that there is no very obvious return on the poet's anthropomorphism; the meaning seems to draw no strength from it. One looks in vain for clear signs that some particular image of humanity is being held up to us by the poet, an image which derives unique clarity and emphasis from reflection in an animal society. It would be possible to extrapolate a general moral from the poem?for example, the advisability of assimilating the peaceable alien or, conversely, of opposing him on all fronts?and there are even parallels to be drawn between the action of the poem as I have interpreted it here and what we might surmise about the problems attendant on the 159 See Mech, The wolf chap. IV. 160 Kathryn Hume, The owl and the nightingale: the poem and its critics (Toronto, 1975).</page><page sequence="35">Orton? Wulf and Eadwacer 257 assimilation of Viking settlers into English society. But it has to be admitted that no particular image of this kind emerges without a good deal of coaxing on the reader's part. There are two ways out of this impasse (I exclude Renoir's ' consensus ' criticism): either we can revert to the idea of human characters, or we can settle for a rather less ambitious and modern interpretation of the poem as a work of anthropomorph ism. In the preceding discussion I have indicated the many difficulties standing in the way of a ' human ' interpretation, which fails to explain the poem's animal vocabulary satisfactorily and seems to lead unavoidably to unsupported speculation about the characters' circumstances and relationships, or to assume the existence of some historical or legendary narrative to which the poem alludes. No such narrative has yet come to light, and as there is no real need to postulate one if the characters are wolves, I turn to the second line of approach. A possible key to a better understanding of Wulf and Eadwacer lies in the popularity of names in Wulf- and -wulf and its cognates among the Germanic peoples. The implication of a name like JEdelwulf, ' noble wolf, is that certain attributes of wolves, presumably strength and ferocity, and perhaps also cunning, were admired and emulated. In a discussion ofthe Scandinavian berserkir and uljhednar, Georges Dumezil refers to ' an ancient conception, conserved and attested in the mythologies of the Germans and the Celts: due either to a gift of metamorphosis, or to a monstrous heredity, the eminent warrior possesses a veritable animal nature \161 The various Old English poetic compounds in -wulf such as walwulf ' slaughter-wolf', probably betray no more than a straightforward recognition that a warrior may, when appropriate, show the courage and ferocity of an enraged animal. There is another side to the Germanic wolf, which was also the Icelandic vargr (both ' wolf' and * outlaw '), the outcast (ultimately the human outlaw in Old English: cf. wulfheafod treow, weargtreow, weargrod, all ' gallows '), despoiler of graves and battlefield scavenger;162 and perhaps these associations may help to explain the unpopularity of the uncompounded name Wulf among the Anglo-Saxons. It is also conceivable that superstitions about the power of names?the primitive fear, in particular, of invoking the dead by naming the beast whose name they bore when alive?con tributed to this unpopularity.163 However, it is the first, not the second, set of ideas about wolves which seems to provide the more relevant background to Wulf and Eadwacer'. as I remarked earlier, the notion of the outlaw seems to find no clear reflection in the poem. Ought we, then, to picture a poet who, conscious of the idea embodied in names and poetry whereby warriors share in the nature of wolves, simply reversed the analogy, perhaps under the stimulus of the vernacular riddle and the lyric ? One feels uncomfortable with an explanation such as this, which presupposes an advanced capacity for analytic thought on the poet's part. A different explanation of the poem's genesis seems to be called for?one founded on a view of the man-wolf analogy, not as an analysable and reversible transaction between man and wolf, but 161 Georges Dum^zil, The destiny of the warrior (trans.

I am not, of course, suggesting that Wulf and Eadwacer be seen as a work of artless spontaneity: the balance between animal and human terminology must surely have been constructed as a puzzle for the audience; but perhaps this puzzle has more of a point to it than an ordinary riddle. Bruno Snell's analysis of a simile in the Iliad, whereby the resilience of a military defence is compared with that of a rock battered by wind and waves, may provide a clue to what this point might be: ... it is not quite correct to say that the rock is viewed anthropo morphically, unless we add that our understanding of the rock is anthropomorphic for the same reason that we are able to look at ourselves petromorphically, and that the act of regarding the rock in human terms furnishes us with a means of apprehending and defining our own behaviour. In other words, and this is all important in any explanation of the simile, man must listen to an echo of himself before he may hear or know himself.164 For ' rock ' substitute ' wolf, and for ' petromorphically ' substitute ' lycomorphic ally '. There is, as we have seen, ample evidence that the Anglo-Saxons were able to view themselves lycomorphically. Wulf and Eadwacer is something more than just an ingenious exploitation of the implication of this tendency. Perhaps we should see it as the anthropomorphic complement of it?as another product of the same fundamental conception of man as part of the world he lives in.165 164 Bruno Snell, The discovery of the mind: the Greek origins of European thought (trans.
