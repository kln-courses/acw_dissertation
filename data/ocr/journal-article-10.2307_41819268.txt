Barker Published online: 13 July 2010 © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2010 Abstract This article focuses on the dialogues within and between Disney's The Princess and The Frog and a 1930s animated series about a young Black boy - Little Ol' Bosko. Both films feature Black characters who navigate a fairy tale world set in the swamps of southern Jim Crow era America in which they grapple with fears about reductive and demeaning black film stereotypes. Although they are in some ways trapped within the white gaze of the film's meaning, I argue that in their fantasies, both Bosko and Tiana outmaneuver the regime of representation that underlies racial stereotyping, opening a space for trans-coding and revision of its meanings. In addition, a comparison of the films demonstrates a clear improvement from the 1930s in terms of an increased differentiation in the representation of Black Americans, acknowledging, if not embodying, the fact that "Black America" is a diverse and complex reality. Keywords Black animation • Disney • Fairy tale • Stereotype • Trans-coding Introduction The controversy over racial representation in Disney's latest release, The Princess and the Frog (2009), has made headlines and stirred anticipation because it is the first Hollywood animated feature film to include a Black woman as its lead. Yet, despite the studio's consulting of the NAACP and such luminaries as Oprah Winfrey (who voices the character of Eudora in the film as well), not all of the critical or popular responses to the film's racial representations have been positive (Barnes 2009). This is hardly surprising as the debates over race and representation, especially the representation of African Americans in the media, have been highly contentious for over a century. Since the early twentieth century, critics, filmmakers, and actors such as W.E.B. Du Bois, Clarence Muse, Sidney Poitier, Spike Lee, and J. L.

In fact, conversations are bound to become more complex as the nature of racial identity in America has become more heterogeneous in the last few decades. Thus, the purpose of my article is not to simply argue for or against the presence of black stereotypes in the film or to label it as racially inoffensive or merely a further capitulation of Hollywood's historical inability to portray realistic black characters. Animation that is based on caricaturing as a tactic of representation will have to continuously grapple with whether certain character- istics, racial and otherwise, have been taken "too far." In addition, it is unlikely that Disney will ever try to produce animated films that focus on a serious engagement with reality or history; the sanitized aesthetic ("something for everyone!") necessary to appeal to broad markets is fundamentally incompatible with a realistic representation of history. Such filmmaking will need to come (and I think will come) from alternate sources such as independent studios: Maijane Satrapi's Persepolis and Aaron McGruder's The Boondocks are recent examples. Instead, I will focus on what insights can be gained from putting The Princess and the Frog in conversation with a series about a young African American boy from the 1930s - Little 01' Bosko. The character of Bosko originated in 1929 and ran through 1938, and during this time, he went through a radical transformation from an unidentifiable anthropomorphized animal to a little boy. The cartoon series itself manifested the changing trends of animation during this time period, as well as the mutating ideas about racial representation. The last three Bosko shorts in particular, in which he becomes Little 01' Bosko, provide a significant companion piece to The Princess and the Frog. Both focus on a fairy tale structure and setting to investigate the fantasies and fears of the main characters - which engage with the history of racial representation in the USA - both are set in the South and use the swamp as a liminal place of reflection about the real world, both feature talking frogs as crucial characters, both embrace the growing influence of jazz and the Harlem Renaissance, and both their main characters, Tiana and Bosko, emerge as the heroes of their own stories, able to "own" their own words. In the process of comparing the fantasies of these two characters in relation to the history of racial representation in Hollywood, I argue that in their fantasies, both Bosko and Tiana outmaneuver the regime of representation that underlies racial stereotyping, opening a space for trans- coding and revision of its meanings. But this achievement remains in an unsettled dispute with the movies themselves: Bosko is required to continually triumph over the same black stereotypes, and Tiana loses the uniqueness of her dream - Tiana's Place - for the Disney ideal of Tiana's Palace. There is, however, a clear improvement from the 1930s in that widespread racial ignorance and fear - especially as they are embodied in minstrel stereotypes - have lost some of their power, both on and off the screen. Hollywood, Black Animation, and the Problem of Representation The rise of animation occurred simultaneously to the rise of live-action cinema in America and both experimented with the representation of race and ethnicity from Ö Springer</page><page sequence="3">484 J Afr Am St (2010) 14:482-498 their beginnings at the turn of the twentieth century.1 While most filmmakers at the time were White, it was not long before African Americans also became involved in film production and distribution (Cripps 1993). The same was not true for animation. With the exception of George Herriman, whose comic strip Krazy Kat was animated in the 1910s, few Blacks participated in the nascent art and industry of animation.2 Yet Black Americans and "Blackness" became a subject of animated films almost immediately. One of the earliest movies to feature animation, Humorous Phases of Funny Faces (1906), featured vaudeville lighting sketch artist J. Stuart Blackton drawing a series of caricatures, including the transformation of the words "Coon" and "Cohen" into racial stereotypes. In general, the style for representing Black characters in animation was borrowed from vaudeville and minstrelsy, as it was in live-action cinema. For example, Winsor McCay's comic strip Little Nemo in Slumberland featured a character named Impie who was an African boy from a cannibal tribe. He was visually depicted in a pastiche of caricatures that combined the blackface look from minstrelsy with the popular notion of Africans as cannibals. But there is little malice in the character, and in McCay's 1911 short film using the characters from the strip, Impie could be anyone; a few visual signifiers are all that remain of the imperialist stereotype about the "primitive" nature of Africans. In fact, one of the more distinctive things about animated blackness from this period is its contrast with the black stereotypes prevalent in live-action cinema and vaudeville acts. While both engage with racial stereotype, the process of engagement is different. In live-action films and vaudeville tradition, real Black actors are transformed into reductive and essentialized "cartoons" or "caricatures" of Blacks, as in The Birth of a Nation (Bogle 1997). In animated films, on the other hand, the characters participate in the same "racialized regime of representation" and thus have some of the same stereotyped characteristics of caricatured reality, but they often do not function in the same way as the live-action character stereotypes; rather, the ambiguity of racial signification in the animated films introduce possibilities for "trans-coding" stereotyped images and ideas about African Americans with new meanings (Hall 1997:249). The representation of black Americans and the racial stereotypes that were developed in America go back much further than the nineteenth century and partake of a larger regime of racialized representation that developed along its current path during the first stages of European Imperialism in the eighteenth century. These racial stereotypes developed from a distortion of the necessary process of identifying difference in psychoanalytical functioning and social organization (Fanon 1967). In a binary division of exaggerated differences, the "self' that was white European society was identified as civilized and good, while the "other" that was African and black was identified as primitive and bad (Douglas 1966). In the case of white representations of Black Americans, the differences were embodied in a polarized binary division that emphasized and naturalized the desirability of "civilized" whiteness as opposed to the objectionable 1 As Paul Wells has noted in Animation and America , "animation in the United States has been characterized by a desire to express difference and otherness " (Wells 2002:1). 2 George Herriman was a Creole African American from New Orleans. See Krazy Kat: The Comic Art of George Herriman (McDonell et al. 1 986). â Springer</page><page sequence="4">J Afr Am St (2010) 14:482-498 485 "primitiveness" of blackness. This manifested itself in a number of stereotypes about Blacks that focused on their essential nature as a primitive, childlike, and lazy people fit only for servitude and entertainment; in other words, they became the objects of derision and amusement. Thus, the identity of Black people became "an undifferentiated blob... [in which] each black person is interchangeable, indistinguishable, or substitutable" (West and Gates 1996:84). These stereotypes were ossified and disseminated throughout nineteenth century popular culture and media representation, including minstrel shows, vaudeville, advertising, and finally film (Lott 1995). Black stereotypes were so commonly known and accepted during the early decades of animation that only a few visual references were needed to recall them. A grass skirt and bone through the nose evoked a cannibal and connoted primitiveness. Exaggerated lips, gloves, and a topcoat brought to mind blackface minstrelsy and the idea of Blacks as performers without a real personality. Bogle identifies a number of types that permeated popular representation, including Toms, Mammies, Coons, Bucks, and Sambos. These stereotypes lingered in film through the 1930s, although in animation, there began to be a growing disconnect between the signifier and signified of racial identity that reflected the changing social attitudes and conditions in America about both race and representation. As Adrienne Lanier Seward has noted: "Minstrelsy continued to function as a vehicle for mediating the tension between a longing for a familiar, comfortable past and the necessity for dealing with the rapidly changing face(s) of American life" (2003:13). Thus, regardless of the animators' beliefs about African Americans or their intentions in representing them, the final product often mimicked and reproduced the forms and signifiers of racial stereotyping - such as fear of ghosts, love of watermelon, mammies, coons - without necessarily sustaining the racist implica- tions of such reductive representation. For example, Impie looks like a "cannibal," but he is playful, cute, and neither cannibalistic nor particularly primitive (not for a cartoon anyway): a disconnect that creates an unstable and ambivalent environment wherein possibilities for trans-coding representation arise. Another example involves the wildly popular introduction of synched sound and music into film with The Jazz Singer (1927), which resulted in a ubiquitous reproduction of a hammy black-faced cry of "Mammie!" as a punch line in cartoons of the late 1920s and early 1930s. Most of the characters making this cry as they experience a "blackface moment" are anthropomorphized animals, and the implications for race in such gags seem caught in a hall of mirrors: an imitation of "an imitation of an imitation," to paraphrase Henry Sampson's assessment of the performance of Black minstrels in blackface imitating White imitations of Southern Blacks (1980:1). The potential for trans-coding is also made possible by the playful and fluid nature of animation itself, which is able to mark and distort visual signifiers at "lighting" speed and, consequentially, can potentially transform the representation and meaning of racial stereotypes. The 1920s and 1930s saw particularly fluid visual styles and manipulation of subject matter, and the influence of modernist strategies of representation, like surrealism, was clear. There was also a proliferation of anthropomorphized cartoon characters, such as Felix the Cat, Bimbo the Dog, Mickey Mouse, and Flip the Frog. Although these characters had easily identifiable Ô Springer</page><page sequence="5">486 J Afr Am St (2010) 14:482-498 human qualities, they were also often ambiguous in terms of race, age, and even gender. The fluidity of representation typical of the animation of this period was aptly united with a growing fascination with and love of jazz, which brought its own potential for improvisation and change. The prominence attained by numerous performers like Duke Ellington, Cab Calloway, Louis Armstrong, and Lena Home garnered attention and admiration, while a great deal of naiveté and willful ignorance maintained an adherence to the widely held stereotypes of Blacks from vaudeville. Thus, while Black stereotypes gleaned from minstrel shows tended to reduce Blacks to "minstrels" with exaggerated blackface characteristics and a total lack of personality, the animation of jazz musicians tended more toward exaggerations of their own characteristics and personality rather than a generic type. They were still often subjected to the proliferation of the endlessly repeated minstrelsy gags, but not to the obliteration of their own images. Thus, the representation of blackness in early animation often focused on differences that held ambivalent meanings and could be read in both negative and positive ways. It also contained levels of nuance that were not ruled entirely by stereotype. Such nuance proliferated in the following decades, and there were a variety of attempts to engage with, resist, and transform Black stereotypes, including integration with White values, the inversion of negative for positive interpretations of blackness, avoidance, and direct confrontation and interrogation of stereotypes.3 These attempts are still evolving, and the dialogues about them are still very much in flux, judging from critical and popular responses to The Princess and the Frog. These conversations also confirm that meaning is never fixed and that ideas about how to address stereotypes will remain in contention for some time to come. As Mikhail Bakhtin has argued, meaning is created through dialogue: The word in language is half someone else's. It becomes 'one's own' only when the speaker populates it with his own intention, his own accent, when he appropriates the word, adapting it to his own semantic and expressive intention. Prior to this moment of appropriation, the word does not exist in a neutral and impersonal language... but rather it exists in other people's mouths, in other people's contexts, serving other people's intentions. (1981:293-4) Stereotypes of African Americans have been especially hard to fight against because they are so all-encompassing and systematic in nature - fighting against one sometimes means falling into another. Yet the growing acceptance that Black Americans are a diverse and complex people and that there are many different shades of color and experience within the concept and reality of "Black America" means that there can be space for contradiction and improvisation as well as coherence and solidarity in the evolving understanding of black identity.4 3 The transition, in other words, from The Birth of a Nation (1915) to The Green Pastures (1936) to Guess Who's Coming to Dinner? (1967) to Sweet Sweetbacks Baadasssss Song (1971) to Leonard Part 6 (1987) to Bamboozled (2000). See for example, Howard Winant's discussion of racial formation in The New Politics of Race (Winant 2004). â Springer</page><page sequence="6">J Afr Am St (2010) 14:482-498 487 Little Ol9 Bosko and the Swamp of the Imagination Bosko's first incarnation was in a short demo film that Hugh Harman and Rudolf Ising created in 1929. The two animators had started out with Walt Disney in Kansas City in the early 1920s, followed him to Hollywood, and by 1929 were looking for work on their own. While it never made it into movie theaters, Bosko the Talk-Ink Kid , as the demo film became known, secured Harman and Ising positions with Leon Schlesinger and Warner Bros, and they developed a series of films on Bosko that were featured as Looney Tunes. The Talk-Ink Kid was a loosely structured experiment with synchronized dialogue that featured Ising as a live-action animator and Max Maxwell as the voice of Bosko. Unlike the Disney shorts, whose synchronization with sound focused on music, this Bosko short centered on a conversation between Ising and Bosko. Throughout his history, Bosko both typified the general animation trends of the time while diverging from them in small but significant ways. From the beginning, Bosko's identity was ambiguous. He was anthropomorphic, like Felix the Cat and Mickey Mouse, but he did not have a clear animal origin and so might be considered most similar to an "anything person muppet." Harman and Ising said they had based Bosko on Felix the Cat and that "he was just a character with a Southern voice" (Solomon 1989:100). Bosko's mysterious identity was even highlighted in the cartoon from the beginning; he introduced himself in response to Ising's question "Who are you?" with "Who is I? I's Bosko, that's who. I ain't nobody else." His racial status was also ambiguous, and much of the criticism about it is based on anecdotal evidence from interviews rather than visual evidence from the cartoons. Michael Barrier claimed, in Hollywood Cartoons , that Bosko was copyrighted as a "Negro boy" at the Library of Congress (Barrier 1999:155). Jack Zander, an animator who worked at Warner Bros., also claimed that Bosko was "obviously a little black boy" (Lehman 2007:18). But was he? Despite a lack of racial signifiers (with the exception of the unreleased demo), critics seemed convinced he was a Black caricature. One reason may be that in the original demo film, he was indeed speaking in what sounds like Black vernacular. The Talk-Ink Kid makes clear the influence of vaudeville and minstrelsy with its emphasis on performance, including the performance of race. Henry Sampson identifies this first incarnation of Bosko as a minstrel performer as the main reason to identify him as Black (1998: 12).5 Bosko is not just performing blackface in this test short; however, he mimics a number of seemingly ethnic dancing styles, including one that appears to be Chinese. One of the most likely reasons for his original portrayal as a minstrel figure is the huge popularity of The Jazz Singer as the first "talkie." The connection between sound, musical performance, and blackface was unfortunately a standard routine for the next several years. In Box Car Blues (1930), there is an example of one of the ubiquitous "mammie" blackface moments when Bosko shouts "mammie!" as he goes through a tunnel - complete with actual blackface and white gloves: not his usual look. In his subsequent films, however, Bosko soon developed 5 For an excellent examination of racial confusion and blackface, see "Mixed Colors: Riddles of Blackness in Preclassical Cinema," Chapter 2 of Jacqueline Stewart's (2005) Migrating to the Movies. â Springer</page><page sequence="7">488 J Afr Am St (2010) 14:482-498 a fully cartoonish and racially unspecific voice modeled on Disney's squeaky Mickey Mouse, with a bit of a Southern accent. Bosko 's identity was fairly visually and aurally consistent over the next few years, and he even retained his ambiguous qualities after Harman and Ising moved to MGM in 1934 and began producing the cartoon in color. Bosko was also an extremely plastic character, with a kind of anarchic adaptability. This trait, popularized with Felix the Cat in the 1920s, was one of the greater pleasures of early animation: a magical and irrepressible flexibility that allowed animation to both objects and ideas. Charles Solomon speaks of it with derision in his assessment of Bosko in Enchanted Drawings , claiming without explanation or evidence that Bosko is "an elastic black golliwog" (1989: 100).6 He further argued that he is "probably the most relentlessly cheerful" character from the late 20s and early 30s: "His large, square teeth seem to remain fixed in a broad grin, no matter what he does. Beyond that inexhaustible good cheer, he shows little personality" (1989:100). This is certainly untrue, however. Bosko was not any more cheerful than Mickey Mouse or any of the other typical cartoon characters of the period. He displayed a full range of human emotion, including laughter, silliness, adoration, consternation, anger, fear and sadness; in fact, he cried within the first 3 min of his debut in Sinkin ' in the Bathtub (when a goat eats the flowers he has brought for his girlfriend Honey). Furthermore, the lack of racial context in these animated films was in pronounced distinction to the films where Mammies were contrasted with rich White women and Coons were the servants of rich White men. Where there is no clear binary, there can be no clear power differential. With the disappearance of the few racial markers there had been in the demo film, Bosko became a kind of American "everyman" - at various times he is a hunter, a hobo, a soldier, a construction worker, etc. Even the toothy smile that Solomon disdained (though it is hardly omnipresent) is a standard marker of American identity rather than simply Black American identity. Yet Bosko as anthropomorphic "anything person" was just racially ambiguous enough to make people uncomfortable. In some ways, he, like many of those early cartoon characters, was "matter out of place" (Douglas 1966). For example, Stefan Kanfer quipped about Ising's assertion that Bosko was "just southern": "Apparently, Ising was the only one who failed to recognize a Negroid caricature when he drew it" (Kanfer 1997:87). Yet, it seems to be only the fact that Bosko has no obvious animal origin that puts him into the potential category of blackness: he's not a human and he's not an animal, so he must be Black? Despite the fact that he looks like Felix the Cat and Mickey Mouse (and Bosko and Honey are obviously versions of Mickey and Minnie Mouse), he is always singled out as being "Black" while they are, at most, "derived" from blackface, or more often than not, anthropomorphized animals "outside" of race. However, in 1935, Bosko put such ambiguity behind him and had the singular experience of becoming a "real boy." In Run, Sheep, Run , Bosko received a completely new look: it was a more realistic approach in terms of both visual and aural representation, which followed a general trend in the animation of the mid- 6 Bosko in fact shares none of the visual characteristics of the golliwog. Springer</page><page sequence="8">J Afr Am St (2010) 14:482-498 489 1930s.7 He was also in a pastoral setting, a typical move in the mid- 1930s when fantasies of the rural South were omnipresent.8 However, the series soon moved toward a more fantastic setting, which combined elements of Harman and Ising's short film Swing Wedding with the return and transformation of Bosko's fantasy world. Swing Wedding screened in February of 1937 and featured a cast of "jazz frogs" who varied from fairly stereotyped representations to caricatures of famous personalities like Cab Calloway, Fats Waller, and Louis Armstrong. The celebrity caricatures were similar to the animated caricatures of White celebrities at the time; they were also specific personalities rather than just types. The biggest stereotypes were those of the actors who were themselves already cartoonish: Stepin Fetchit, for example. This short was undoubtedly indebted to the successful production of musical shorts in the early 1930s like Cab Calloway's Hi-De-Ho (1934), and the swing style of the Jazz Frogs adapted well to Bosko's character. In his last three films - Little Ol' Bosko and the Pirates (May 1937), Little Ol' Bosko and the Cannibals (August, 1937), and Little Ol' Bosko in Bagdad (January, 1938) - Bosko became Little 01' Bosko. His girlfriend Honey disappeared and his childish status was emphasized by giving him a "mammie."9 Each film begins with her sending him to bring cookies to his grandmother's house; Bosko does so, but has imaginative adventures on the way. In the last two films, the story even begins with a close-up on a book being opened by the hand of a black child, further emphasizing its fairy tale nature. The fantasy realm of the Jazz Frogs springs from Bosko's fears as he travels alone through the swamp to his grandmother's house. In a plot similar to the fairy tale of Little Red Riding Hood - which probably explains the new name of the cartoon - Little 01' Bosko must face the dangers, both real and imagined, of his environment.10 Red Riding Hood's journey took place in a primordial forest, but Bosko's is set in a place more typical of the southernmost area of the United States: a swamp. Thus, the villains of the piece are anthropomorphized frogs rather than a wolf. The choice for the setting and the villains emphasizes the style of pastoral realism typical of the time. Yet the swamp, like the forest, is a location outside of most people's usual perception of the inhabitable natural world; it is an alien landscape that resonates with the fascination of otherness. It is a liminal area of discovery - especially self-discovery - in keeping with the tradition of fairy tales. As such, it functions as a "swamp of the imagination" for Bosko - just as it does for Tiana in The Princess and the Frog. Each of their narratives is structured around a journey through their imagination as they face their fears and explore their identities. Both Tiana's and Bosko's encounters with the subconscious realm of the swamp contain elements of the comical, but they both also feature serious plot elements. Bosko's imagination is more appropriate to that of a young boy: faced with the task of bringing cookies to his grandma's house, he invents elaborate traps and pitfalls for 7 Barrier attributes this to Depression era unemployment, which allowed studios to hire artists adept at fine arts drawing (191). 8 This was true of both live-action films, The Green Pastures , for example, and animation. 9 Although she becomes the "Mammie Two Shoes" in MGM's Tom and Jerry , in these cartoons, she is in her own home. 10 Another source is probably Ub Iwerks' Little Black Sambo cartoon (1935), which indulges in much more stereotypical blackface material, including Mammie fruitlessly "washing" Sambo. â Springer</page><page sequence="9">490 J Afr Am St (2010) 14:482-498 himself that draw from the habitus of the swamp, but also dip into a variety of standard adventure tropes and racial stereotypes. When read as constructions of the white gaze, his alter egos seem to merely reinforce racist ideas about Blacks, and this is certainly an integral part of the way these characters functioned for audiences.11 While they are not extreme versions of such types, they do move through the standard racial gags whose omnipresence in the 1930s made them familiar entertainment to many people in the audience: cannibals, the lure of watermelon, "black dialect," mammie, the lazy Stepin Fetchit servant, etc.12 They also utilize some of the recently developed caricatures of 1930s jazz musicians like Louis Armstrong and Cab Calloway. Yet these stereotypes remain primarily on the surface: the cannibals consist mainly of random bits of grass skirt and a bone or two, and besides some elements of Black dialect and facial similarities to the musicians, the frogs are not noticeably "black" in either a positive or negative way. To reinforce the slippery nature of the racial signifiers, Little Ol' Bosko in Bagdad freely overlaps stereotypes of African Americans with those of Middle Easterners. These slips also characterize the fantastical nature of the waking dream Bosko is having. In terms of a revealed unconscious struggle, the films are ultimately about his own ability to choose between love of cookies - the fulfillment of his own immediate desires - and love of his grandma and fulfillment of his task. The opposition he faces is comical and playful for the most part, but the choice points to a crucial aspect of maturation: the ability to control his desires and postpone pleasure and the desire to value another's wishes above his own. Bosko is able to do both of these things despite the many challenges (both threatening and enticing) that he faces and has structured an intriguing imaginative system in which to do so. His fantasy is also about the ability to interpret and control his surroundings. If one reads the frogs and their actions as elements of Bosko 's own unconscious fears, then the racial stereotyping takes on a new interpretive possibility. Part of what Bosko fears, and certainly should fear in his 1930s world, is being labeled a Black stereotype and being bound and limited by popular ignorance and destructive binaries. The frogs draw him into a dilemma of representation: should he hold onto what he knows to be true or fall under their spell and either give up his distinctive possessions or suffer punishment? His strategy for controlling and reversing this situation is instructive. In each of the films, Bosko is forced to "walk the plank" for his refusal to give up the cookies to his frog captors. The frog king counts out his steps as he walks to the edge: one through eight. Bosko 's technique for saving himself is the same each time: in response and opposition to the frog king's counting from one to eight, he counts and taps backwards from eight to one, and does so on a syncopated beat. His dismantling of rhythm and reversal of the numerical logic stymies his captors and they accept defeat: "We can't have no grandma's cookies today, so the little man say!" The situation is reversed, and Bosko gains control, takes over conducting the frog band, and the frog king is punished in the machinery of his own destructive 11 For in-depth analyses of the reception of Black stereotypes by movie audiences in the early twentieth century, see Stewart's Migrating to the Movies and James Snead's (1994) White Screens/ Black Images. 12 For example, in one film, the Bill Robinson frog caricature dances on a mirrored floor while offering various delectables to Bosko, including pomegranates, oranges, and, of course, a juicy watermelon. Bosko refuses. &lt;£) Springer</page><page sequence="10">J Afr Am St (2010) 14:482-^98 491 plan. Subsequently, there is an explosion of jazz that celebrates the triumph of the reversal and Bosko is expelled from the fantasy world back into the real one, where he successfully brings the cookies to grandma's house. Interestingly, the "plank" in the final film is in fact a conveyor belt - one that leads to a giant bottle of castor oil complete with a mechanized spoon. This new version of the plank is telling; it emphasizes the nature of production (and reproduction, as one of the characters is worn down to dust and restructured anew). Bosko does not count backwards in this film, but he does outwit the conveyor belt in terms of its logic of speedy mass reproduction. He out-taps the speedometer and refuses to "take his medicine." Defying both the machinery of mass production and consumption, he refuses to be defined as just one among many copies. Bosko 's intriguing technique of counting backwards into the face of his captor is indicative of the process of trans-coding, of rewriting and revising an image or stereotyped option. His world not only reflects his fears but also his own possibilities to transform it. It is filled with humor and music and the outsmarting and dismantling of black stereotypes into a kind of chaos (including such typical cartoon absurdity as milking a tuba). If there is any performer that Little 01' Bosko most conforms to, it is Harold Nicholas of the famed Nicholas Brothers. Harold was on the screen at the right time for such modeling: performing in shorts like Pie, Pie Blackbird (1932) and The Black Network (1936).13 Bosko is certainly not of that stature, but the image of a small Black boy tapping his way to freedom in opposition to an army of frogs/Black stereotypes certainly resonates with the Nicholas Brothers' unsurpassed achievements despite racial prejudice. By asserting his own alternate interpretation of the situation, Bosko becomes the hero of his own story, rewrites his fate, masters his desires and fears, makes the language of otherness "his own," and continues on his way. Trans-coding Stereotypes in The Princess and the Frog The Princess and the Frog , a Disney film directed by Ron Clements and John Musker, was released in December of 2009. But long before it hit the theaters, it had already occasioned a great deal of anticipation and trepidation. As the first Black "princess," Tiana (voiced by Anika Noni Rose) received a lot of scrutiny in terms of whether or not she measured up to other Disney princesses and whether or not she was a more realistic Black character than the ones for which Disney was historically responsible. Disney, eager to please as many fans and audience members as possible, consulted with luminaries such as Oprah and the NAACP in an effort to produce a Black princess who would serve as a positive role model for little girls everywhere. Of course they were doomed to failure in terms of pleasing everyone. There is no 13 The Nicholas Brothers (Harold and Fayard) were African- American tap dancers who began dancing at the Cotton Club when Harold was 11 and became famous for their innovative and strenuous "flash dancing" in such Hollywood films as Kid Millions (1934), Down Argentine Way (1940), and Stormy Weather (1943). Although neither had formal training, they are generally considered to be among the best tap dancers of the twentieth century. Interestingly, one of their signature moves involved "leapfrogging" over each other into "no-hands" splits down a flight of stairs. Springer</page><page sequence="11">492 J Afr Am St (2010) 14:482-498 "one" idea about what a realistic Black animated character should be; or for that matter, what the relationship is between "realistic" and "positive," for example (Reid 1993). Nor should there be. It is the scarcity of positive images of animated Blackness in Disney movies that puts this kind of pressure on one movie or character.14 But it is certainly a useful, if long overdue, start for Hollywood animated feature films. Disney is widely known for its "princess" fairy tale stories. It is also widely known for its philosophy of "something for everyone." Thus, its transformation of princess characters over the years is a telling indication of the changing demographics and audiences in the USA since the 1930s. From Disney's first feature film, Snow White and the Seven Dwarves (1937), through Cinderella (1950), Sleeping Beauty (1959), The Little Mermaid (1989), Beauty and the Beast (1991), Pocahontas (1995), and Mulan (1998), the "princess" films have been some of the most popular ones Disney has made. This is due in part to the standard narrative of these films, which involves a young woman pursuing and attaining her dreams of love and success through a series of hardships, and often features a rags-to-riches theme. Since the 1990s, Disney has sought to acknowledge the changing demographics and racial attitudes of American citizens and audiences by diversifying the race and ethnicity of its characters as well as embracing a more progressive portrayal of gender. With The Princess and the Frog , Disney is in many ways diving headfirst into its own problematic past regarding the representation of African Americans - Song of the South (1946) for example - by setting it in the Jim Crow era South. It is an endeavor fraught with missteps but also full of possibilities. The difficulties and missteps can be easily demonstrated by examining the critical and popular responses to The Princess and the Frog. Scott Foundas, in The Village Voice , criticized the film for ignoring many racial realities of 1920s New Orleans and for casting/drawing a "mocha-skinned dreamboat of indeterminate ethnicity" as the lead male (2009). One blogger noted that Prince Naveen's indeterminate ethnicity "has left many in the community shaking their head in befuddlement and even rage" (Helm 2009). Manohla Dargis, in the New York Times , and Roger Ebert argue that the film "displaces race" and "sidesteps all the realities of being a poor girl in New Orleans" (Dargis 2009; Ebert 2009). Michael Phillips complained that Tiana, "whose hallmarks are doggedness and clean living, isn't a very interesting character" (2009). Others took offense at her transformation into a frog or the fact that she is not a "real" princess. On the other hand, critics have pointed out that Tiana is a positive role model who is independent, strong-willed, and practical (Shoard 2010). And, in terms of the history of animation, it is a victory for the realistic representation of Black Americans in terms of visual and aural representation in Hollywood feature films. Not only are the Black characters voiced by African Americans, but their facial and bodily movements are also drawn from video references made by African Americans: no longer an "imitation of an imitation" (Lytal 2009). 14 Historically, the images of animated Blackness in Disney films have been both limited and negative, reinforcing Black stereotypes; for example, the Mammy character in Three Orphan Kittens (1935), Sunflower the Centaur in Fantasia (1940), the crows in Dumbo (1941), and the orangutans in The Jungle Book (1967). Ö Springer</page><page sequence="12">J Afr Am St (2010) 14:482-498 493 While the likelihood of Disney making a children's movie that addresses the racial realities of the Deep South in the 1920s is something that will undoubtedly never happen, the focus on this lack of realism in the movie is a bit like throwing out the baby with the bathwater. Certainly an animated film could be made that deals more realistically with the depth and breadth of Black culture in America, and some have already been made, though not by Disney. The film does embrace the emergence in the 1920s of the "new woman," but it is difficult to argue about the film's lack of engagement with racial issues; it simply does not. This is standard not only in Disney films but also in fairy tales, which The Princess and the Frog is. As such, it is helpful to examine how the narrative is developed in terms of the fears and fantasies that Tiana's journey into the swamp of the imagination uncovers. As with Bosko, Tiana's journey is structured in terms of food, frogs, and the negotiation of self and stereotype. In addition, her love interest, Prince Naveen, is a racially ambiguous character, as was the early Bosko character. Other key characters include alligators, bugs, a bevy of white hillbilly stereotypes, Doctor Facilier, Mama Odie, the wealthy "Big Daddy" La Bouff and his daughter Charlotte, and Tiana's loving parents Eudora and James. Tiana is a poor Black inhabitant of New Orleans who believes that working hard will get her what she wants in life. She has two jobs, works constantly, and is saving up to buy a restaurant of her own: Tiana's Place. This dream is one she inherits from her father who dies (presumably fighting in WWI) before it can be realized. The film details two distinct fantasy worlds that Tiana takes part in: one is this world of her career dream where she can become a businesswoman with a successful (and racially integrated) restaurant in a city famous for its cooking. The other is a fantasy world that is distinctly Southern - the bayou outside of New Orleans - and features an anthropomorphic journey outside of her usual experiences and plans. The visual contrast between these two fantasies is enlightening. Tiana may be a bit of a "stick in the mud" as the Prince says, but her dreams are colorful and tasty. The visual reminder she carries with her for her dream of "Tiana's Place" is an image that strongly resembles the work of Black artist Aaron Douglas.15 In the 1920s, he produced illustrations for The Crisis, Opportunity , and The New Negro , as well for James Weldon Johnson's Gods Trombones (1927) and Paul Morand's Black Magic (1929). Tiana's "I'm Almost There" fantasy song that develops from this image retains much of the shaping and style of Douglas' work, but art deco flourishes and contemporary touches are also added in.16 Unlike Bosko 's fantasy world, it is an un-caricatured version of Black culture in the 1920s and 1930s. In addition, Douglas' work actually bridges the gap between the two visions: the restaurant dream resembles the urban milieu of the Harlem Renaissance, and the swamp fantasy encapsulates the mythological Southern setting that was a common subject for Harlem artists and writers, including Douglas. 15 J especially connect it with Douglas' Aspirations (1936), which has a very different color scheme, but whose style, content and layout are quite similar. What makes Douglas' painting much more powerful, however, is its overt engagement with racial struggle. 16 Richard Corliss (2009) mistakenly identifies this scene as reminiscent of Lotte Reiniger 's silhouette animation. â Springer</page><page sequence="13">494 J Afr Am St (2010) 14:482-498 Thus, Tiana's dream for herself is one of fame, success, and, perhaps, even racial uplift. In terms of Black stereotypes, she is the antidote to the "lazy Negro." The fact that her mother Eudora is voiced by Oprah Winfrey is no mistake: she embodies a dream for Black women that has proven possible in contemporary society. Her dream is also one that is based not on magic or princes but on hard work. This dream is lost, however, when the real estate agents who have sold her the building she needs for her restaurant change their minds and sell it to someone else. At this point, the alternate fantasy world envelops Tiana, the real fantasy, so to speak. For when Tiana turns into a frog, she is entering a subconscious world beyond her control, one that engages with old-fashioned animal guides and stereotypes and which forces her to find a new way to manage her fixture. Some progress has been made in this regard: Mama Odie is at least an older (much older) woman who is not portrayed as a horrifying nag or narcissistic bitch (like Snow White's stepmother); the "Louis Armstrong" type alligator is not a racial caricature; the primary racial stereotypes (hillbillies and Cajuns) in this Black woman's fantasy world are at least white stereotypes, and the chief villain, Dr. Facilier, seems to actually have historically and racially accurate motivations for his actions. Even though he is the "voodoo" villain, his real plan is to usurp Big Daddy's status and wealth. As he tells Lawrence the butler: "You and I both know the real power in this world ain't magic; it's money. Buckets of it." The real but largely unacknowledged villain in the film is, of course, economic disparity based on rigid racial (and gender) stratification. It drives Facilier to the dark side where his considerable skills and charm are squandered: he becomes a shadow man. Facilier (voiced by Keith David) is by far the most interesting character in the film. It would be fascinating to see an exploration of his story, a kind of post-colonial unpacking of his Creole heritage and why he became a shadow man. As is typical for stereotypes of the disadvantaged, poor, and racially undesirable, The Princess and the Frog puts the brunt of villainy on characters like Facilier (who is literally demonized), the downtrodden Lawrence, and the ignorant hillbilly frog hunters, while it lauds the rustic poverty of Mama Odie whose message is to "dig deeper." The real villains of the film, the ones who enable a deep economic divide - "Big Daddy" La Bouff, Charlotte, and the real estate agents Henry and Harvey Fenner - are ridiculed rather mildly. These pirates of finance are the real culprits behind why Tiana works herself to death: Big Daddy, who spends any amount of money on his daughter's ridiculous whims; Charlotte, who is the richest girl in town and never once thinks of giving Tiana a loan; and the real estate agents who deny someone's dream simply because she is a young Black woman who has to work for a living and cannot pay cash up front. Thus, Tiana's fantasy still embodies villains that are not really her enemies, although they are an improvement on Bosko's contestation with racial caricatures. But her fantasy world also contains one more important character: her fellow frog-in- arms, Prince Naveen of Maldonia. This character has engendered a great deal of consternation, even "rage" about his racial and/or ethnic indeterminacy. His origins are deliberately confusing: his name is Indian (and his mother appears to be wearing a sari), his accent is Brazilian (voiced by Bruno Campos), he comes from Maldonia, which sounds European, and he has a British butler. Much like the confusion about Bosko's "true" identity, his racial ambiguity functions as a destabilizing force. He â Springer</page><page sequence="14">J Afr Am St (2010) 14:482^198 495 does not fit into the essentialized binary opposition that many feel most comfortable with. His status as a Creole, a person of mixed origins, subverts notions of race and ethnicity because he is deliberately obscure and creates a kind of representational vacuum. He may be the most obviously "Creole" element of the film, which is one of the most defining characteristics of New Orleans history. He represents a growing population in this country who struggle with such issues every day: what does it mean to be a part of numerous racial and ethnic cultures and heritages? These are not issues that are dealt with realistically in the film, but that they are introduced is an intriguing move on Disney's part. Although he plays a fairly limited and superficial role in the film, Prince Naveen, like Dr. Facilier, is a character that bears further exploration. But this is Tiana's movie, and in it she shows that in an ideal world, a young Black woman can have it all: accolades, wealth, a career, even love - and she can have it all without the aid of her rather worthless best friend who in the end has only wealth, illusions, and a kind of ditzy good humor. Like Bosko, she gets to this place of comfort and success by staying true to her ideals, learning to postpone her desires, developing empathy toward others, and accepting the inescapable presence of "otherness" but doing it through making her own interpretations. The trans- coding that takes place in The Princess and the Frog is focused on the development of this last idea. It is the reason that Tiana is a frog for so much of the film and aligns her with Disney princesses like Belle in terms of having to overcome destructive binary thinking. From the first few minutes of the movie, much is made of the fact that Tiana is disgusted by frogs, and therein lies the revelation of her deepest fear, a fear that underlies most binary approaches to difference: that she is nothing special. Or if one connects it to Black stereotypes associated with frogs in early animation, the idea that she can only ever be a caricature in the eyes of others, an imitation of herself, just like Little 01' Bosko. In a way, Tiana's story enacts how it can be almost impossible at times to fight against a stereotype, that one can never quite escape the system. The character of Tiana, in trying to combat the stereotype of Black laziness, runs into objections that she is a joyless workaholic, or a racial assimilationist. Bosko 's approach to this dilemma is a syncopated reversal that attempts to both engage and destabilize the Black stereotypes that engulf him. Tiana's approach encompasses the ability to accept "otherness" as an inessential and un-defining difference. By living as a frog, she is able to finally accept, without disgust, their nature and make it "her own." In her words: "I got news for you Shadowman; it's not slime. . .it's mucus!" It's a moment of trans-coding, a rewriting of her otherness, and by extension, a capacity to move beyond stereotype to an understanding and acknowledgment of individual identities. Conclusion Both the 1930s animated series Little Ol' Bosko and Disney's recent film The Princess and the Frog share a focus on Black characters who navigate a fairy tale world set in the swamps of Southern Jim Crow era America. The fairy tale settings provide the characters with an alternate place to reflect about the real world and Ô Springer</page><page sequence="15">496 J Afr Am St (2010) 14:482-498 investígate fears about racial representation and demeaning Black stereotypes. This whimsicality, as well as the use of anthropomorphized characters, also allows for a fertile process of trans-coding racial identity that is fed by the imaginative and ambiguous space of animation. Faced with simplistic minstrel stereotypes, Bosko is able to reverse and redefine Black performance and hold true to his goals. Alternately, Tiana's fantasy world shows an increased differentiation in the representation of Black Americans, a unique appreciation of art from the Harlem Renaissance, and an acknowledgement of the complex composition of contemporary racial identity. In the end, both Bosko and Tiana are able to outmaneuver the regime of representation that underlies racial stereotyping through their engagement with and alteration of otherness, making them heroes of their own stories and owners of their own words. The same cannot be said of the movies themselves, however. While the instability of meaning may allow them a kind of triumph, both films push a more palpable interpretation at viewers. For Bosko, it is that he is unable, in his 1930s locale, to escape the weary ubiquity of Black stereotypes. For Tiana, on the other hand, there is a clear improvement on this front as widespread racial ignorance and fear - especially as they are embodied in minstrel stereotypes - have lost some of their power since the 1930s. The problem for Tiana, as a Black princess in a Disney film, is that she loses the charm and uniqueness of her personal dream - Tiana's Place - for the rather corporate soullessness of Tiana's Palace. It is not a surprising conclusion, coming from a company whose money and power is based on popularity and who promote a narrative form - the fairy tale - that is steeped in the ideal of achieving aristocratic privilege. The villains may have evolved from comical blackface stereotypes to otherworldly spirits, but the next step remains to be taken. The most interesting move for Disney would be to identify explicitly the real villains at the center of The Princess and the Frog . surely "Big Daddy" and the real estate speculators deserve to be caricatured more extensively in the swamp of the imagination. Ultimately, Tiana's restrictions are more cultural than racial in the film, although this does end up stymieing her reversal of racial expectations. While the relaxation of racial limitations in the fairy tale setting allows her to model an ideally empowered existence, it also subsumes her into another stereotype altogether - that of the Disney princess. Her assimilation into this mainstream role, with its emphasis on economic success, traditional romantic tropes, and Disney's "something for everyone," sacrifices any sense of originality. With the substitution of a Palace for her Place, she remains firmly tied to a fantasy world that most cannot access, a dream in which she transcends race and gender stratifications through fantastical economic success rather than questioning these differences or actualizing her distinctive identity. This is why she is allied throughout the film with the capitalist bravado of Big Daddy rather than the misguided yearnings of Dr. Facilier, and why in the end she casts away her father's dream. On the other hand, although he is more inundated with racial stereotypes and restrictions, Bosko is able to return from his fantasy into the reality of home and family in a way that emphasizes his ingenuity and uniqueness. What both their journeys suggest, however, is the rich potential for nuanced explorations of the ambiguities and potentialities of contemporary racial identity within the genre of animated fairy tales. Allowing expression and Ô Springer</page><page sequence="16">J Afr Am St (2010) 14:482-^98 497 "ownership" to a myriad of characters and their submerged fantasies and fears (for example, a Dr. Facilier, Prince Naveen, or James and Eudora) from within the traditional fairy tale mold will create a broader range of intentions, accents, and meanings more reflective of the shifting fields of racial identity in contemporary America.
