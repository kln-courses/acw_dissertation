The amount of attention given to memory (col- lective or not) and trauma bears witness to the fact that historians really do want to give in to that desire; the fact that they treat these subjects in a rather "positivist" way suggests that they regard it as a bit improper to do so wholeheartedly. As a result commemoration is all over the place but is never taken as seriously as it should be. This essay argues that effective commemoration should start with a question Giambattista Vico might have asked: "who are we that this could have happened?" Posing this question means relinquishing the identity-enhancing, self-celebrating stance from which we tend to commemorate "unimag- inable" events. Commemorative self-exploration is a confrontation with what we don't like to be confronted with: the fact that occasionally we behave in utter contradiction to what we regard as our identity. Heterodox, "monstrous," and therefore Geddchtnisfdhig behav- ior comes in three varieties: things we are proud of, things we are ashamed of, and the sub- lime "mutations" in which we "commit" history and embark on the unimaginable. Because sublime mutations change consciousness, commemorating them confronts posterity with almost insuperable epistemological difficulties. Commemorating sublime mutations means burying them-not in the sense of "covering" them, but in the sense of "inventing" a way in which they keep on living. The object [of the historian's work] must be of such a kind that it can revive itself in the historian's mind; the historian's mind must be such as to offer a home for that revival. -R. G. Collingwood2 I The earth in Beaumont Hamel, just northwest of Thiepval, is an undulating green. The trenches have been partly filled up, the ridges of the bomb craters are eroded, grass and moss covers the softened contours like the down on the antlers of a stag. I ask myself: why would someone like me visit the place where the twentieth cen- tury was born from Flemish mud and French debris, the site of the battlefields of the Somme, Ypres, and Verdun? That descendants of the soldiers who perished in the Great War make pilgrimages to where it all happened may, perhaps, not need an explanation. But why would someone who didn't lose any of his forebears in 1.

Do I not know that, though sources--as historians rightly call them--may "speak," the earth, grass, and moss will not yield up a single shred of knowledge that is not to be found in what was recorded in letters, photographs, diaries, and books? Is nature, however charged, not just a mirror that reflects, contorts, and- at the very most-revaluates what we already know? But whatever I say to myself, the lure of these foreign fields persists. And, evi- dently, not just for me: the battlefields of Flanders and northern France, and the museums of Ypres, Pdronne, and Verdun are major tourist attractions. Nor is the attraction restricted to the backdrop of the First World War. Scores of people are drawn to sites of memory, sites of mourning--on the condition that the events of which they bear witness are truly unimaginable. The Gettysburg battlefield draws one and a half million visitors each year; the Normandy Tourist Board recom- mends the "Historical Area of the Battle of Normandy" as "an open air museum in itself';3 the House of Terror is one of Budapest's main assets; Berlin's "unique selling point" is the fact that it was the capital of the age of darkness; Auschwitz, Dachau, and Buchenwald have become (I hesitate) "popular destinations"; and the site of the World Trade Center is a must-see for the savvy visitor to New York City. I will not apologize for my, and others', penchant for visiting sites where unimaginable things did "in very deed occur." My point of departure is that battlefield tourism is not the perverse inclination to fondle sore spots, or the toffee-nosed alternative to freak shows and horror movies, but, rather, one of the most straightforward manifestations of our desire to commemorate. This desire to commemorate is, in my opinion, the prime historical phenomenon of our time. I will not even attempt to give a catalogue of all its manifestations. Let me just mention the fact that people not only flock to battlefields, but also have an irrepressible urge to erect monuments. A Dutch newspaper recently gave a far from exhaustive list of the public monuments that have been unveiled in the Netherlands in the past few years: to children who died unbaptized, to Rotterdam policemen who were killed while doing their job, to the ten or twelve people who died of Legionnaires' Disease after visiting a flower show, to the "unknown" (that is, stillborn) child, to the abomination of slavery, to young traffic casualties, to the victims of a fire in a bar in Volendam, to the soldiers who died (mostly, by the way, because of accidents) during peacekeeping missions, and so on.4 Profes- sional historians tend to treat this monumentomania a little condescendingly. In fact, however, they have jumped on the bandwagon of what the lay public does so much more wholeheartedly -they fight the windmills of "collective memory" and conscientiously unearth the traumas of minorities.5 And, of course, aspiring and up-to-date historians duly take stock of the "lieux de mrmoire" of their re- spective countries, write tepid little pieces about them, and are happy that, for once, they don't have to bother about footnotes. 3. Significantly, for the Tourist Board, being a museum is somehow more desirable than being the thing itself. 4. De Volkskrant (March 20, 2006), 2. 5. A few years ago Gadi Algazi wrote in his mission statement in History and Memory that the journal would focus on "interactions between official designs, lay appropriations and academic dis- course." ("The Past in the Present," History and Memory 13 [2001], 1-2). I think the lay impulse to commemorate unimaginable events was appropriated by academics.</page><page sequence="3">BURYING THE DEAD, CREATING THE PAST 315 It keeps puzzling me. Claude Lanzmann once said that when you write about the Holocaust "the worst moral and aesthetic mistake you can make is to approach your subject as if it belongs to the past." But that mistake, it seems, is precisely what is being made: the discipline of history is pervaded with the desire to com- memorate, but the infected historians hardly, if ever, commemorate the things they write about. It seems to be a neurotic inhibition: the discipline does want to commemorate but is held back by the fear that somehow it is a bit improper to give in to that wish. As a result commemoration is all over the place but is never taken as seriously as it should be. The predicament is perhaps best expressed by Pierre Nora himself. In "L'bre de la commemoration," the coda of the Lieux de memoire project, Nora writes that the work "was intended, by virtue of its concep- tion, method and even title, to be a counter-commemorative type of history." But, Nora continues, "commemoration has overtaken it."6 The intention of the Lieux de me"moire was "to make commemoration itself one of [the] primary specimens for dissection," but the "bulimia of commemoration" has devoured the attempt to dissect the phenomenon. If Nora is right, if indeed we overindulge ourselves in commemoration without ever being satisfied by it, then, surely, the discipline is in the grip of a phenom- enon it doesn't quite understand. In this essay I will try to free myself from this devouring monster and to make a somewhat immodest contribution to a better understanding of the phenomenon. I intend to do this by offering ten theses about the desire to commemorate -the desire that brought me to the fields of Beaumont Hamel and that, I think, may well reveal how we, nowadays, relate to past, pres- ent, and future. Let me begin by defining the issue somewhat more precisely. There can be little doubt that within the discipline the feeling is widespread that a tension exists between two very different and perhaps incompatible approaches to the past. In the wake of Pierre Nora's 1984 introductory essay to the Lieux de me'moire project, this crossroads is usually described in terms of "history" and "memory." "Memory and history," Nora says, "far from being synonymous are ... in many respects opposed. Memory is life, always embodied in living societies and as such in permanent evolution .... History, on the other hand, is the reconstruc- tion, always problematic and incomplete, of what is no longer."' The antithesis of "history" versus "memory" has caused a great deal of controversy, much of which can be reduced to the fact that it is a confusing and unprofitable way to refer to an opposition that is, of itself, fundamental indeed. The main problem with pitting "memory" against "history" is that memory is an extremely complex 6.

Nora, "Between Memory and History," in Realms of Memory, I, 3. The phrasing of Nora's Introduction to the English translation of the book is less bold than the original French introduction to the project, the translation of which was published in Representations in 1989. Originally Nora wrote that there appeared to be a "fundamental opposition" between history and memory.</page><page sequence="4">316 EELCO RUNIA phenomenon and that anybody can find anything in it to suit his or her taste or purpose. Consequently, positing an antithesis between "history" and "memory" is about as helpful as positing an antithesis between "history" and "consciousness" or, for that matter, between "history" and "love." To be able to evaluate the two diverging approaches to the past we'd better start with giving them proper names. This brings me to my first thesis: First Thesis: There really exists a "fundamental opposition" between two diverging ap- proaches to the past, but instead of "history" and "memory," the poles of this opposition should be called "history" and "commemoration." By "history" I mean the traditional, "botanizing," "positivist" conception of history Nora describes so eloquently. It is inspired by the belief that by bring- ing one's professional capacities to bear on a subject out there, one adds a little something to a very valuable, transpersonal, and ultimately transcendental goal. In the traditional, "botanizing" conception of history, each article, yes, each book review, contributes to the ever more truthful biography of a nation, a city, a regi- ment, an institution, a discipline, or a culture. In order to explain what I mean by "commemoration" I have to make a distinc- tion between "acts of God" (as they are called in American insurance policies) and the things people do for, and to, their kin--which I might as well call "acts of people." Acts of God refer to natural disasters: hurricanes, volcanic eruptions, and tsunamis. Acts of people, on the other hand, are the Prometheus-like things with which people willfully make a difference. A prime example of this urge is the wish to make history; thus among the most prototypical "acts of people" are the historical catastrophes humans inflict upon one another. Commemoration hinges on the idea that acts of people are committed by us - not, of course, in person, but as members of the group, the nation, the culture, and ultimately the species that brought the ca- tastrophe about. Calamitous acts of people are made by us, because they could have been made by any one of us - if, by chance, we had been born a couple of hundred kilometers farther down or if we hadn't been blessed with -as the former German chancellor Helmut Kohl has expressed it-"the grace of late birth." This brings me to my second thesis: Second Thesis: Commemoration is trying to answer the question "who are we that this could have happened?"' The idea that, ultimately, "commemoration" is self-exploration -typically the fruit of an era obsessed with therapeutics and spiritual welfare-is not as new as one might expect. In fact it is at the heart of the philosophy of the incomparable Giambattista Vico. In a famous passage in the Scienza Nuova, Vico exclaims that he cannot understand why brilliant men like Descartes allow themselves to be- come completely engrossed with what they will never be able to fathom-na- ture-and ignore what is within reach of their genius: history.9 We can only un- 8. It seems that Nora originally envisioned his project as a kind of commemoration along the lines sketched here: "The new history is a purely transferential history, and as in the art of war, everything is in the execution, a matter of tact in the historian's tenuous relations to his new object and of finding the right depth of immersion in the subject" (ibid., 20). 9. Giambattista Vico, The New Science of Giambattista Vico, transl, Thomas Bergin and Max</page><page sequence="5">BURYING THE DEAD, CREATING THE PAST 317 derstand, Vico argued, what we ourselves have made, and because nature is made by God, we can never unveil its secrets. History, on the other hand, is made by ourselves - and therefore history lies within our grasp. We can understand history because we have made it, because we are history. In the soft-headed brand of commemoration that is by far the most widely prac- ticed nowadays, the question "who are we that this could have happened?" is answered in an identity-enhancing, yes, self-celebrating way. If taken seriously, however, commemorative self-exploration is a confrontation with what we don't like to be confronted with: with the fact that occasionally we behave in utter con- tradiction to what we regard as our identity. In fact, it might be argued that it is precisely events in which we did things we didn't think we were capable of doing that we later want to commemorate. To the extent we don't like to face behavior that is at odds with our identity, commemoration tends to get stuck in a state of mind in which we, as commemorators, consider ourselves as beings slightly, but fundamentally, different from the ones who did the things we commemorate. Heterodox, "monstrous," and therefore Geddichtnisfdhig behavior comes in three varieties: things we are proud of, things we are ashamed of, and the sublime "mu- tations" in which we "commit" history and embark on the unimaginable. Com- memorating shameful behavior, demanding as it may be, only poses psychological problems; "sublime" behavior, on the other hand, confronts posterity with almost insuperable epistemological difficulties as well. The question of how shameful events are commemorated illustrates not only the tendency to attribute them to "others," but also demonstrates that it is impos- sible to come to terms with a past event as long as we evade the question "who are we that this could have happened?" As long as France didn't accept full responsi- bility for the Vichy regime, and pretended that Vichy c'&amp;tait les autres, it couldn't come clear of that shameful episode. The Netherlands kept being haunted by the "police actions" in the Dutch East Indies as long as it maintained that the cruel- ties committed were just "incidents" perpetrated by some unrepresentative "rotten apples." And in order to come to terms with the Guerra Sucia, the Argentines will have to acknowledge that Jorge Videla and Alfredo Astiz were Argentines like themselves. This is my third thesis: Third Thesis: Coming to terms with a historical trauma is the result of answering the com- memorative question "who are we that this could have happened?" This doesn't mean that coming to terms with a historical trauma should be the goal of commemoration. Rather, coming to terms with a historical trauma is the free by-product of a sustained attempt at commemorative self-exploration. III Quintessentially memorable, or, as I should say by now, "commemorable" events are not, however, the events that make us ashamed, but are the sublime "acts of people" Goethe had in mind when he wrote: "Nur allein der Mensch / Vermag Fisch (Ithaca, NY and London: Cornell University Press, 1994), 331. There is also an affinity with Collingwood's logic of question and answer-but I will not go into that.</page><page sequence="6">318 EELCO RUNIA das Unm6gliche." In such "impossible" acts we leave the beaten track and em- bark upon the unknown--as we did in events like the American Declaration of Independence, the French Revolution, the secession of the Confederation of the South, Bismarck's unification of Germany, the First World War, the Holocaust, and the redrawing of the map of what used to be Yugoslavia. What makes these events "sublime" is that no right-minded person could foresee them- and that yet, disturbingly, it was the same right-minded person who "made" them. This is just another way of saying that these events were at odds with the worldview from which they emerged. Sublime events are the "unimaginable" events that draw people who have no personal stake in the matter to the places where it all hap- pened-as it has drawn me to Beaumont Hamel. Because sublime events effect a change in worldview, they are not only very hard to stomach, but also confront us with a major epistemological problem. For how can we ever answer the question "who are we that this could have happened?" if the "we" who made the event is qualitatively different from the "we" who want to commemorate it? What such an unfathomable discontinuity feels like was poetically expressed by the Prussian statesman and scholar Wilhelm von Humboldt. In calamitous events such as the French Revolution, Humboldt said, we destroy our "homely huts" and find ourselves back in "palaces" -unexplored universes we ourselves have some- how made. "When we start to do things beyond our confinements," Humboldt lamented, "the current often takes us up, we go beyond our habitual selves and destroy the homely huts in us. And in the palaces we erect outside ourselves we will remain forever foreigners."'0 That, indeed, is exactly what is at stake. After having committed a sublime act we find ourselves "in a palace"--or, as I prefer to call it, with a "monster" of our own making -and we wonder: how could such a ghastly creature ever have been nurtured by well-meaning, right-minded, and peace-loving people like us? In contrast to earthquakes or volcanic eruptions, anomalous "acts of people" confront us with the task of adapting our worldview so that it can encompass what we have actually brought about. It is the prime feature of sublime historical "acts of people" that when we look back on them we cannot really imagine the position from which we came to com- mit them. The acts themselves have changed everything. We cannot deny that we did what we did, but was it really us who did what was done? This incom- mensurability is partly due to the sense of loss that inevitably sets in after we have burned the bridges behind us. After a sublime historical mutation this sense of loss expunges the thought that we could ever have jumped upon it-and it miraculously transforms agents into victims. The main reason, however, for our unwillingness to consider ourselves agents is that the things we did were "under- determined," that we had insufficient reasons to do what we did, that-as Joseph Conrad said-we just gave in to the question "Why not?" Yet, as I have shown elsewhere, in each of the sublime "acts of people" we now want to commemorate, 10. "Wenn wir anfangen auBer uns zu wirken, dann zieht uns oft der Strom mit sich fort, wir gehen aulBer uns heraus, zerst6ren die heimische Hiitte in uns, und in die Paldiste die wir auBer uns aufttirmen, bleiben wir ewig Fremdlinge." Quoted in Arnold Labrie, Het verlangen naar zuiverheid: Een essay over Duitsland (Maastricht: Maastricht Uniprint, 1994), 16.</page><page sequence="7">BURYING THE DEAD, CREATING THE PAST 319 a willingness to go "va banque " was a vital ingredient." Whether we like it or not, a readiness to put a way of life, a culture, on the line, is a necessary component of sublime historical events. This is my fourth thesis: Fourth Thesis: People start to make history not despite the fact that it is at odds with-yes, destroys--the stories they live by, but because it destroys the stories they live by. I would like to remark in this connection that we routinely assume that our history is behind us. In the sense, however, that after a sublime historical event our world- view lags behind with what was all too possible, our history really is before us.12 We have to "catch up with it"- as the nineteenth century tried to catch up with the French Revolution, and as we, at the moment, are still trying to catch up with what the dual World War of the first half of the twentieth century has shown to be possible. I do not think--as Humboldt did--that we remain forever foreigners in the palaces we erect. Rather, we try to make them habitable. If the event we have brought about is too conspicuous to be smuggled away, catching up with it may even be a psychological necessity. In fact, Daryl Bem's "Self-perception Theory" nicely describes the process. According to Bem, individuals do not have privileged access to themselves. They do not derive their identity from somewhere "within." Rather, they do so by examining their own deeds, and by subconsciously answering the question "What kind of person am I, that I could have done the things I did?'13 In my book Waterloo, Verdun, Auschwitz I have shown that societies strive for "dissonance reduction" in much the same way that individuals do.14 Historians try, as Ranke said, "um die letzte und niichste Vergangenheit mit der fritiheren in Einklang zu bringen" ("to bring recent history [i.e. the French Revolution] into harmony with what happened before"). Making a palace habitable, "taming a monster," has, however, a rather annoy- ing consequence: it obliterates its most salient feature, namely, the fact that it was an underdetermined answer to the question "Why not?" This can perhaps be seen most clearly in the American Declaration of Independence. The famous phrase "we hold these truths to be self-evident" suggests that these "truths," though per- haps unrecognized and unfulfilled, had always been there-and that the revolu- tionaries only gave them their due. But that, of course, is a typical ex post facto account. The decision to throw off the British yoke was not the result of "self- evidence." On the contrary: only after the irreversible step had been taken did it occur to Thomas Jefferson that the reasons for doing so were not contingencies but "truths," and not just truths but "self-evident truths." The "self-evident truths" didn't create the event, the event created "self-evident truths." Sublime "acts of people" like the American rebellion transform consciousness to such an extent that the status quo ante becomes unimaginable the moment the status quo post becomes self-evident. Differently put: the one thing without which the sublime 11. See my "Geschiedenis plegen" (Committing History), Krisis 6:3 (2006), 62-73. 12.

This, in fact, is my fifth thesis: Fifth Thesis: the more we commemorate what we did, the more we transform ourselves into people who did not do it. As Henri Bergson wrote in his Evolution crdatrice: "Precisely because it is always trying to reconstitute, and to reconstitute with what is given, the intellect lets what is new in each moment of history escape. It does not admit the unfore- seeable. It rejects all creation.""15 IV Before I turn to the questions of how we can, do, and should commemorate sub- lime "acts of people," I will have to say a few words about the supposition that the current "memory boom"-as Jay Winter calls it'6-is a unique phenomenon. It is not. Surprisingly, today's memory historians somehow fail to historicize the phe- nomenon of which they are a part. The recent upsurge in the "desire to commemo- rate" can be pinpointed rather exactly: it started in the mid 1970s. The irresistible force that the phenomenon eventually acquired may well have been caused by the fact that this particular period saw a confluence of two strands of commemoration: the "hot" desire to commemorate the Holocaust and the somewhat "cooler" desire to commemorate the First World War. The first grew to full stature somewhere between Marcel Ophills's 1971 movie Le chagrin et la pitied and the epochal 1978 Hollywood soap opera Holocaust. But I will not recount here how the willing- ness - yes, passion - to have oneself confronted with the reality of the extermina- tion camps came to be expressed in literature, philosophy, history, and cultural studies. Let me just point to the fact that in the second half of the 1970s Primo Levi's If This Is a Man suddenly began to sell.'7 The ambition to pay homage to the First World War may have been more sub- dued, but reveals at least as much about what is certainly a key issue: the trans- formation of the memory of those who actually witnessed a conflagration into a commemorative response of their descendants. This transformation was effected largely in the mid 1970s. On Armistice Day 1976 the London Daily Telegraph ran an article with the title, "Memory of the Fallen Begins to Fade Away."'8 A year earlier, in 1975, Paul Fussell had published The Great War and Modern Memory. The Daily Telegraph article and Fussell's book are landmarks in a process in which testimony is replaced by commemoration. By the way, the intermingling of the World War I and World War II strands of commemoration is epitomized by the fact that Fussell dedicated his book "To the memory of Technical Sergeant Edward Keith Hudson... Killed beside me in France, March 15, 1945." 15. Henri Bergson, Creative Evolution, transl. Arthur Mitchell (London: Macmillan, 1920), 172. 16.

Marquand and K. Stierle (Munich: W. Fink, 1979), 274</page><page sequence="9">BURYING THE DEAD, CREATING THE PAST 321 The dates are significant-for history progresses by generations. The period between the death of Fussell's brother-in-arms and the dedication in the book hap- pens to cover precisely the twenty-five to thirty years that a generation is supposed to last. That history, as a discipline, does not evolve smoothly and incrementally, but by leaps and bounds prescribed by, or at least suggested by, generational is- sues, has a sound psychological reason. Not only do generations re-experience their past in and by means of their offspring, but later generations also tend to get interested in what their begetters have "fathered" the moment they realize that, whether they like it or not, now they themselves are fathering the future. This is my sixth thesis: Sixth Thesis: The focus of our desire to commemorate is prefigured by generational is- sues. So the question is not so much why the mid 1970s suddenly started to com- memorate the destruction of European Jewry, but why the same period also wit- nessed a revival of the commemoration of the First World War. The answer, I think, is simple: a generation after the First World War we were too busy making history to be able to commemorate it.19 The commemoration of the War got go- ing not one but two generations after the fact. But once on its way it kept gain- ing ground, so that right now, three generations after the First, and two after the Second World War, my bookseller has more new books about the First than about the Second World War. That commemoration is (at least partly) a matter of generation is confirmed by the fact that it is never a steady trickle, but always comes in waves. Preoccupied as we are with the way the First World War is commemorated, we tend to forget that a particularly big wave overran Western Europe in the two or three decades before that War20--a period, incidentally, that (like ours) was obsessed with memory.21 In the 1890s, "heritage" came very much into vogue and many Western European countries took initiatives to protect their patrimony. Britain's National Trust, for example, dates from 1895. In France, the Third Republic had Paris sprinkled with public monuments. In his 1912 La statuomanie parisienne, Gustave Pessard did some arithmetic: if we take into account the 335 mythological or assorted statues ... the 328 illustrious Parisians of both sexes which ornament the fagades of our H6tel de Ville ... if we add the 180 other monuments devoted to the memory of individuals ... without forgetting the 72 statues which are at the moment just at the project stage ... we come up with the fantastic figure of more than nine hundred-odd statues.22 In Germany, thirty years after Bismarck's stunning successes, building monu- ments became a kind of cult-a cult that inspired Alois Riegl to write one of the 19. Interestingly, both major crises in modern Western Europe (the French Revolution and its aftermath, and the great, dual twentieth-century world war in which Germany was cut to size, the Ausnahmezustand) also lasted about a generation: from 1789 till 1815, and from 1914 till 1945. 20.

In fact, so many monuments were erected in Wilhelmine Germany that the effort backfired: the public got bored. Robert Musil remarked: "Das Auffallendste an Denkmilern ist. .. daB man sie nicht bemerkt."23 Though the infatuation with commemoration that started in the 1970s is not ex- ceptional, it has one unique feature--a feature that has caused a lot of confusion. This feature is that, whereas in most periods it is quite clear whether the desire to commemorate is inspired by either "excess" or "scarcity," in our time-which commemorates the Holocaust as well as the First World War-the two are out of step. One might say that the prime concern of a generation that has participated in a traumatic event is to be delivered from an "excess" of memories. This wish is best exemplified by Primo Levi. "For many of us," Levi said, "to be interviewed was a unique and memorable occasion, the event for which we had waited since liberation, and which gave meaning to our liberation."24 For a generation, how- ever, that has not lived through a traumatic event, commemoration means the re- verse: to remedy the scarcity or, rather, absence of memories. The wish to acquire something as inalienable as a memory is beautifully explored in Geoff Dyer's The Missing of the Somme--an "essay in mediation"25 in which Dyer submerges himself in the excess of memory of the war generation in order to remedy the blank in himself. Arthur Danto has remarked: "We erect monuments so that we shall always remember, and build memorials so that we will never forget."26 At the moment we often seem to be at a loss as to what to do, to build monuments or memorials, to "remember" or "not to forget." The distinction between, on the one hand, commemorating from "excess" and, on the other hand, from "scarcity" of memory is not just a matter of "quantity." "Commemorating from excess" is primarily a psychological issue - motivated as it is by the wish to overcome trauma. "Commemoration from scarcity," however, is first and foremost an existential or, perhaps better, an ontological phenomenon. Generations that have nothing to weigh them down tend to regard the survivors of horrendous and sublime "acts of people" in a way not unlike the way we regard the astronauts who walked on the moon. These "champions" have stared in the face of "truths" that normal life keeps hidden from us. Annette Wieviorka has said that the witness of the Holocaust "resembles the model of the early Apostles who brought the word of the Gospels to the people."27 This Gospel, I would like to add, has a name: reality. "Commemoration from scarcity" is the prime symptom of a "desire for reality," of an ontological homesickness (Heimweh), of a wish to com- mune with the numinosity of history. This is my seventh thesis: 23. "The most remarkable thing about monuments is that you don't notice them." Robert Musil, Gesammelte Werke, 2 vols., ed.

Taking this line of reasoning one step further, one might speculate that ontolog- ical homesickness is connected with the impulse to make history, with the urge, that is, to commit "sublime historical acts of people." From such a perspective the human is the animal that has taken its evolution into its own hand. The mutations in this evolution take place at moments in which we no longer have "a history be- fore us," or, perhaps better, in which we have "consumed" the future that a former sublime historical event has given us. In such a state, we are in danger of getting to know ourselves, and a state in which we are in danger of getting to know our- selves leads to what Heidegger called Seinsvergessenheit. In order to regain the blessed state in which we once more, though on a different level, do not know who we are, we have to do something that is truly at odds with what we regard as our identity--we have to destroy, to recall Humboldt's memorable phrase, our homely huts and erect a palace in which we once again are able to feel not at home at all. This is my eighth thesis: Eighth Thesis: Every now and then we create new pasts for ourselves by committing fresh "original sins," by fleeing forward in horrendous, sublime-in short, historical--"acts of people." This is a rather distressing thought. Can it be that the First World War was a consequence of having consumed the future with which the French Revolution had provided us? Can it be that right now we have consumed the future that the excesses of the first half of the twentieth century have given us? V In the final part of my essay I will draw some conclusions from my attempt to regard commemoration under the aegis of human evolution. It's worth noticing in this connection that most thinkers about the subject take it for granted that our desire to commemorate, and our infatuation with memory, are caused by the "ac- celeration of time," by the "rapid change of society," by the "fact" that, as Pierre Nora said "things tumble with increasing rapidity into an irretrievable past."28 In fact, the idea that we have to go all out to hold our own in the present, and that, consequently, we have to put the past at a distance, is the cornerstone of the Lieux de memoire-project: lieux de meimoire, Nora says, "arise out of a sense that there is no such thing as spontaneous memory, hence that we must create archives, mark anniversaries, organize celebrations."29 Nora's view-that the present is too full to accommodate the past-has been widely adopted, and echoes through the discipline, as in, for example, John Gillis's introduction to his Commemorations: "What we can no longer keep in our heads is now kept in storage."'3 28.

This, it seems to me, is a thoroughly anthropomorphic, or, rather, "historiomorphic" point of view. From an evolutionary perspective, humans are animals who have an absolutely amazing capacity to "externalize" things-to in- vent strategies by means of which what is truly theirs can be split off and placed at arm's length. Through its invention of language, writing, printing, and digi- talization, humankind has brought about, in complete contradistinction to what Nora writes, marvels of "spontaneous memory." It might even be maintained that evolution took place by means of these mutations in externalization. Each new strategy of externalization presupposes a transformation, and each transformation makes room for a new proliferation. The process is nicely, if rather tendentiously, described in the famous passage in Plato's Phaedrus where the Egyptian King Thamos has a go at Theuth-the man who proudly advertised his invention of writing to the king. "If men learn this [art of writing]," Plato makes Thamos say, "it will implant forgetfulness in their souls; they will cease to exercise memo- ry because they rely on that which is written, calling things to remembrance no longer from within themselves, but by means of external marks. What you have discovered is a recipe not for memory, but for reminder."31 This brings me to my ninth thesis: Ninth Thesis: Commemoration is not-as Platonists like Nora think-an epiphenomenon of some basic fault of humanity, but the necessary concomitant of the exquisitely human faculty of externalization. One of the earliest, and most fundamental, externalizations is our custom of burying our dead. According to Vico, burying the dead is one of the things that makes humans human-and indeed, even our closest relatives--bonobos and chimpanzees--do not bury their dead. Humanity, Vico says, "had its origins in humare, to bury. The Athenians, who were the most human of all the nations, were ... the first to bury their dead."32 And, elsewhere, somewhat more graphi- cally: "what a great principle of humanity burial is ... imagine a feral state in which human bodies remain unburied on the surface of the earth as food for crows and dogs .... Men will go about like swine eating the acorns found amidst the putrefaction of their dead."33 Vico may be right. By burying the dead-or, as in southeast Asia, by burning them-humankind may well have created a prime con- dition for traditions, for stability, for transcendence, for religion, for, in one word, culture. Burying the dead is an ambivalent practice, and an advantageous one at that. It is ambivalent because it combines things that seem to preclude each other: closure and perpetuation. Burying the dead is a means to take leave of the deceased without giving them up. It's an evolutionarily advantageous practice because it enables humans to bring much more to bear on the present than what their consciousness can contain. 31. Phaedrus, transl. R.

It is a necessary complement in cases where there is an "excess of memory." That's why the Madres kept going to the Plaza de Mayo, that's why after World War I we invented "the unknown soldier"- which is really nothing more than an ingenious strategy to bring about the vital combination of closure and perpetua- tion even when there were no bodies to bury. But it is also necessary in cases of "absence of memory." Committing history is a form of externalization: by com- mitting sublime historical deeds, by doing things that are at odds with our identity, we place history outside ourselves. Committing history thus is a kind of burial: we take leave of ourselves as we have come to know ourselves and become what we as yet do not know. In the process we come to see what is lost forever: what we are no longer. This is my tenth and final thesis: Tenth Thesis: by burying the dead we create, not our future, but our past.
