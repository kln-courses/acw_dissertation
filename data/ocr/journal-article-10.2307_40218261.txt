<plain_text><page sequence="1">Introduction to Contemporary Civilization, by Walter Libby, Alfred A. Knopf, 1929, pp. 272. This volume presents us with another orientation course for college students, lately given to freshmen at Northwestern University, and now offered to a wider public. It is written "to give students a synopsis or bird's-eye view of present conditions, to help them find their bearings in the diversified studies of the academic curriculum, to provoke their cooperation in the educational process, and to introduce them to the responsibilities of our complex social life" (p. viii). Although a rather small volume, its thirty chapters deal with an astonishing range of topics, such as The Races of Man, Foreign and Domestic Trade, Preventive Medicine and the Tropics, The Industrial Revolution, The Ethical Aims of Education, Scientific Associations, The Psychology of Research, Personal Character, The Sincerity of the Modern Drama, Phases of Religion,</page><page sequence="2">INTRODUCTION TO CONTEMPORARY CIVILIZATION 447 Altogether, we have here an extraordinary collection of miscel- laneous information, historical, industrial, sociological, psychological. The author has read very widely; and he has a rather tedious habit of supporting his judgments by reference to writers who must be, for the most part, quite unknown to the average student, and who are often dragged in to buttress the simplest statements. For ex- ample, "in the judgment of Guizot, Christianity addressed itself in the first place to the betterment of the individual rather than to the improvement of social and political conditions" (p. 110). "Buckle, the English historian, held that moral and intellectual progress is essential to the conception of civilization" (p. 110). "In the judgment of the Scottish philosopher, Edward Caird, Greek religion was characteristically anthropomorphic" (p. 253). On the whole, the book provides a pleasant ramble among various fields of knowledge, never keeping us long enough at a topic to become bored, or to do too much thinking. As an orientation course, it is about on a par with a Cook's Tour of Europe in twenty days. The freshman, or the "general reader" whose thought has not ranged over these diverse fields, must find himself soon confused by such rapidly changing scenes. So summary a commentary on things in general would seem to be better adapted for use as a review course for seniors or mature readers who, having already had a reasonably liberal education, are ready to correlate their previous studies and survey them from a new perspective. The point of view from which this survey is made is that of an interest, and a profound faith, in human progress. It is intended as a "synopsis of recent civilization" "to take stock of the progress of man" (p. 262). The author finds "one increasing purpose running through all history - the creation of a moral order embracing the whole human race" (p. 161). He points out that "in America at the present time new races seem to be forming, superior in the main to the races from which they derive their origin" (p. 29). He is en- thusiastic about American education. "Practised in discussion and habituated to cooperation, students are obtaining the intellectual and ethical training essential for the citizens of a progressive com- monwealth" (p. 143). The optimism, however, is not that of a complacent conservative. We find here an appreciation of socialism, humanism, and all forward- looking programs, and an impatience with the standpattism which is the vice of our materially prosperous civilization. The author re-</page><page sequence="3">448 AMERICAN ASSOCIATION OF UNIVERSITY PROFESSORS bukes the English public schools for failing to keep pace with the nation's social and political progress. "The culture they seek to impart is aristocratic rather than democratic, national rather than cosmopolitan, exclusive rather than inclusive, sectarian rather than humanitarian" (p. 139). Of our industrial system he says, "The profits of companies bear little relation to the real value of their services to society, for those which cater to popular caprice are no less successful than those which minister to public necessity " (p. 163). In reply to the conservative who asserts that industrial democracy would deprive the individual of incentive, enterprise, self-expression, and the opportunity of leadership, he points out that "capitalistic civilization would have been open to like objections in the eyes of the primitive hunter and the medieval baron. The successes of the steel mill and the bank would have appeared to them lacking in motive and the spirit of high emprise. The pursuit of gain would have seemed to them a poor substitute for the boar hunt or the man hunt, and they would have turned in disgust from the vision of our busy manufacturing cities. The advance of civilization im- plies a transformation of ideas concerning personal satisfactions and corporate responsibilities" (p. 178). But in spite of this liberalism the tone of the discussion is so optimistic that the reader is unlikely to get from it a sense of the gravity and urgency of the problems which confront our civilization. Indeed, the facts and opinions presented are seldom so marshalled as to make the reader aware of a problem to be solved. The chapters are hardly coherent enough for that. They jump from one matter to another so rapidly, with so little transition, and end so abruptly, when they have reached their allotted span (each of the thirty chapters is nine pages long, no more nor less!) that the reader may be pardoned for a bewildered "What of it?" "What does it come to?' To be sure, Topics for Discussion are tacked on at the end of the chapters. But the questions there posed have often little relevance to the material presented in the preceding eight pages, and are usually of a nature to require vastly more knowledge and thought than the average reader can possibly bring to their solution. Here are a few of these Topics, taken at random: "Describe the various irrigation projects carried out by the early Egyptians, Hindus, Babylonians, Chinese, Peruvians, and Mexicans." "What metals and what uses of metals do you find mentioned in the Odyssey?" "What light does</page><page sequence="4">INTRODUCTION TO CONTEMPORARY CIVILIZATION 449 the book of Job throw on ancient mining and metallurgy?" "Trace the first steps in the development of the medical profession." "How far in your judgment was the decline of Greek and Roman civiliza- tion due to the deterioration - through war, disease, etc. - of the Greek and Roman racial stock?" "Compare the commercial pros- pects of North Carolina, Louisiana, and California." "What was the social basis of the early maritime codes?" "Resolved: that the possession of a permanent stock of information gives one an ad- vantage as a logical thinker." Principal Jacks is quoted as saying that belief in moral progress is a belief which no man can live without. Certainly it is something to awaken in our college students (whose ambition is apt to be chiefly focused upon making money, marrying well, and having a good time) an interest in social progress and a sense of having a part in the far flung adventure of mankind on earth. Better a Cook's Tour than no sight of the wider world to which we belong. There is much to be said for an orientation course which attempts to introduce the reader to modern civilization as a whole, even at the cost of spreading itself very thin. But such a course fulfils its purpose best if it impresses the student continually with a sense of the defects and dangers of our present social order, rather than soothing him with a sense of the greatness of our achievement. Mr. Libby would doubtless agree that our contemporary civiliza- tion is not good enough to be permanently tolerable, that it is, in fact, in many ways a clumsy, wasteful, cruel, ugly makeshift; that we are beset by difficult and unsolved problems, and cannot depend upon even the continuance of our present peace and prosperity. The men and women on our Main Streets, with their complacent hundred per cent Americanism, their vague God's-in-his-heaven religion (if any), their selfish immersion in their private business, their satisfaction in their autos and radios and movies, and all the other anaesthetics which the twentieth century has provided, can seldom be counted on for intelligent effort. It is to our college students that we must look for leadership in the years to come. And what they need is not so much a realization of the progress we have made as a realization that further progress will not come unless we work for it, and a determination to play their part in creating a better life than ours for their children and children's children. If they can be made, in some measure, to care for that, and if they can be made to see that the indispensable prerequisite to that is think-</page><page sequence="5">450 AMERICAN ASSOCIATION OF UNIVERSITY PROFESSORS ing - open-minded, many-sided, unbiased, wary, patient thinking - they will have the best possible orientation to contemporary life.
