<plain_text><page sequence="1">Peirce for Linguistic Pragmaticists DANIEL HUGO RELLSTAB* ^ Abstract When pragmatics was established as a new subdiscipline in linguistics in the 1960s and 1970s, pragmaticists referred to Peirce as one of their ancestors. Since then, Peirce has remained in the collective memory of prag- matics, and is cited now and then - but not more. As a matter of fact, his ideas on natu- ral language and communication have hardly been scrutinized, let alone applied, and wrongly so. This paper shows that the later Peirce sketched a theory of natural lan- guage and communication, which offers a new perspective on the heavily debated Semantics-Pragmatics-Interface. Peirce was a contextualist. But he did not refrain from developing a formal method to analyze the meaning of sentences uttered. Standing between radical pragmaticists on one side and formalists on the other, Peirce furnishes us with nothing less than an architect s plan to bridge the two approaches, and to look for new ways to analyze the phenomenon of meaning in language. Keywords: Peirces Conception of Natural Language, Semantics-Pragmatics-Interface, Contextualism, Formal Pragmatics, Indexicality, Abduction. 1. Introduction It is well known that Pragmatism influ- enced the development of theories and methodologies of the social sciences and the humanities of the early 20th century, and, as such, also the foundation of modern approaches to the study of language (cf. Nerlich &amp; Clarke 1996: 118ff). But although Peirce was one of the founding fathers of Pragmatism, his influence on lin- guistics was in the beginning at best indi- rect. The Signifies movement, e.g., heavily TRANSACTIONS OF THE CHARLES S. PEIRCE SOCIETY 319 Vol. 44, No. 2 ©2008</page><page sequence="2">inspired British Contextualism. But neither Bronislaw Malinowski nor J^ John Robert Firth went back to Peirce (cf. Nerlich 1994: 450; Nerlich r' &amp; Clarke 1996: 312ff). Or linguistic behaviorism, which was one of ^ the most important currents in 20th century linguistics in America, was •"» rather a development from ideas of George Herbert Mead, James g- Dewey, and, again, Ogden and Richards (cf. Münch &amp; Posner 1998: °g 2222; Nerlich &amp; Clarke 1996: 130-40). But nowadays, especially % grammarians refer to and make use of Peirce. Historians of language ^ and cognitive linguists refer to Peirces conception of iconicity (cf. S Anttila &amp; Embleton 1994; Danaher 1998, 1999; Dressier 1994). Some | of them talk of abductive change when they actually mean reanalysis, a a. modification of the grammatical and semantic properties of a linguistic g' form in the process of language change (cf. Deutscher 2002). Even Peirce s neologism finious, a concept characterizing processes, which * cannot simply be called teleological because this "is too strong a word D to apply to them" (CP 7.471, 1898), was adapted. Michael Shapiro z uses it to name the overall processes of language change. He holds the £ view that language systems have a tendency to evolve towards isomor- ^ phism, and characterizes this process towards isomorphism as finious ^ (cf. Shapiro 2002). ° The situation is different in linguistic pragmatics. In the 1970s, when £? pragmatic ideas became more widespread and linguistic pragmatics was r established as a new subdiscipline, pragmaticists discovered Peirce as their h ancestor, referred to him, and used him against Ferdinand de Saussure w and the then powerful tradition of structuralism (cf., e.g., Koller 1977; Schlieben-Lange 1975: 22-25; Vigener 1979). Since then, Peirce remained in the collective memory of linguistic pragmatics - but not more. Pragmaticists cite Peirce now and then, but rather for rhetorical than for theoretical reasons, ignoring that Peirce offers substantial ideas to them (cf., e.g., Bickhard &amp; Campbell 1992; Gardt 1999; Levinson 2004). For Peirces ideas on natural language could be read as contribu- tions to solutions of problems that emerge at the so called 'semantics- pragmatics-interface,' and are ignited by the question: "How much pragmatics does language need to become meaningful?" Finding plausi- ble answers to this question has become one of the central aims in lin- guistic pragmatics and in philosophy of language today (cf., e.g., Bach 1999; Borg 2007; Cappelen &amp; LePore 2005; Carston 2002; Récanati 2004b; Sperber &amp; Wilson 1996). Although all the answers given differ in one or the other respect, the linguists and philosophers working on this problem can be allocated to one of two big camps: Those trying to min- imize the impact of pragmatics on semantics form one faction, those per- ceiving pragmatic effects to be endemic the other one. The two factions take two different methodological stances. Linguists and philosophers of language who argue for little influence of pragmatic factors on the con- stitution of meaning adhere to formal approaches to the analysis of ^3</page><page sequence="3">&lt;N meaning (cf. Borg 2007: 339). More radical pragmaticists, having aban- ti doned the idea that sentences bear meaning, or even that specific condi- p tions for the truth of utterances can be found (cf. Récanati 2005: 2 188-192), decided to give up formal approaches, and to work strictly Z empirically. They observe how people use and understand utterances in ^ real life, or they design experiments and hope to find generalizable &lt;u answers sometimes in the future (cf., e.g., Jaszczolt 2006, 2007; Noveck S 2006; Papafragou &amp; Musolino 2003). The two groups have become «-g rather hostile to each other, and attempts to build bridges between them £&gt; are scarce (cf. Borg 2007; Jaszczolt 2006). But Peirce, read through the ^ lenses of linguistic pragmatics, offers an approach beyond the Scylla of ^r formalisms without pragmatics, and the Charybdis of analyses reduced to ^ descriptions of small parts of the language games people play. ,_, Such a reading of Peirce might be problematic. First of all, it might f- i bear traits of anachronism. But this is unavoidable considering the ÇJ attempt to transfer Peirces ideas into a different time and discipline. &lt;J Secondly, there is no simple answer to the question of what Peirce s the- c/D ory of communication consists in (cf. Pietarinen 2006: 42 Iff). And the Z same holds for his conception of natural language. Both are only avail- &lt;J able as results of systematizations and interpretations, as reconstruc- Ph tions that have to be limited to a specific time of his creative period. For H Peirce neither wrote a book nor a paper on his conception of natural language or communication. He made his ideas on natural language clear in treatises on logic. And they changed over time with the devel- opment of his other philosophical ideas. Fortunately, to select a specific period is not difficult. For the most interesting thoughts for linguistic pragmatics can be found in Peirce's later writings. 2. Choosing the Late Peirce - Why? Although Peirce established the fundamental conception of his division of signs into icons, indices, and symbols very early (cf., e.g., Wl: 170; W2: 56-57), his early conceptions are not complete (cf. Short 1996, 2004). Indexicality began to play a central role only after 1880, when Peirce discovered that without indexicality, "the actual world cannot be distinguished from a world of imagination" (W5: 164). And only after the turn of the century, after giving his philosophy a phenomenological foundation, Peirce presented more systematic accounts of his theory of signs. In 1903, he introduced his well known ten-fold classification of signs (cf. EP2: 289-299). He classified all sorts of signs, from the most simple to the most complex, and discussed different linguistic signs as well as their use in communication. He also presented important ideas concerning the generation of meaning (cf. especially EP2: 295). But the 1903 classification contains important blind spots. And even though later attempts he presented are sketchier, they are more interesting, and ~- , in certain respects more complete.2</page><page sequence="4">One of these blind spots is the distinction between the immediate Jp and the dynamic object. Although Peirce had introduced it long before 3' (cf. MS 599: 36; EP2: 274n), he did not integrate this distinction in the £&gt; classification of 1903. But it is an important one, for it gives us the pos- ^ sibility of distinguishing between the intended, indicated object, and the g- represented object, and is essential for a full-fledged pragmatic defini- °p tion of the generation of meaning.3 Only one year later, Peirce corrected g. this shortcoming in a letter to Lady Welby (cf. SESI 33). And in the ^ same letter, he made another important step towards a more complete, J3 and for linguistics, more adequate theory of signs. He wrote: 3 Taking sign in its broadest sense, its interprétant is not necessarily a 0. sign. Any concept is a sign, of course. Ockham, Hobbes, and Leibniz £? have sufficiently said that. But we may take a sign in so broad a sense that the interprétant of it is not a thought, but an action or experi- enee, or we may even so enlarge the meaning of sign that its interpre- &gt; tant is a mere quality of feeling. (SESI 31) 2 w Peirce went beyond the scope of his earlier conceptions of signs by jg defining actions and feelings as meanings of signs, and pushed the the- g ory of signs to a new level. ° In 1907, Peirce fixed one of the most severe flaws in his theory of {** signs. He gave up the idea that the meaning of a sign always lies in its P translation in another sign (cf. Short 1996: 491ff; 2004: 226ff). As his g reflections in MS 318 show, Peirce was discontented with his former w definition, and looking for new possible conceptions. The ultimate log- ical interprétant should still be a mental, general phenomenon, but no longer a sign. He came to the following conclusion: Now after an examination of all varieties of mental phenomena, the only ones I have been able to find that possess the requisite generality to interpret concepts and which fulfill the other conditions are habits. (MS 318: 178, cf. id: 91, 285) Of course, only intellectual concepts can have habits of action as last interprétants. But this redefinition of meaning has other implications, and is therefore relevant for linguistics. If Peirce had not redefined his conception of meaning, he would have never found a sound definition for the relation between signs and the world that is not reducible to "congeries of particulars". By defining the ultimate logical interprétant as habit, the translational aspect of the older theory is retained, but the postulate of a possibly endless chain of signs after signs is definitely, and finally refuted.4 As Thomas Short put it, "by this revolution of 1907, we break out of the circle of words, and words interpreting words and thoughts interpreting thoughts". It becomes possible to distinguish between meaninglessness and meaningfulness; assertions can be tested (Short 2004: 229). We finally have a plausible theory of meaning. 315</page><page sequence="5">CN There are still other reasons why pragmaticists should turn to the late ö Peirce. The late Peirce intended to analyze all sorts of sign processes, not p only those taking place involving humans. But for didactic reasons, he d analyzed the functioning of linguistic signs in humans and in human Z communication (cf., e.g., MS 318: 52-83), conceding that his inser- ii tions of anthropomorphic vocabulary are a "sop to Cerberus, because I &lt;u despair of making my own broader conception understood" (EP2: 478). E Nevertheless, his anthropomorphic discussions of the functioning of -g signs reveal that Peirce was a thorough analyst of human communica- î&gt; tion, and that he can be called a precursor to linguistic pragmatic think- c/. ing. Without these comments, any picture of Peirces conception of yy' natural language and communication would be incomplete. ^ Still other reasons why pragmaticists should turn to the late Peirce ,_, can be found in his approaches to formal logic. During the 1890s, f-H Peirce investigated an array of different natural languages. His aims QJ were neither directly linguistic ones, nor was his main concern the phi- &lt;J losophy of language. He intended to find a pre-logical basis for scien- c/D tific representations in the very nature of assertions of natural languages £ (cf. SS 1 : 238; CP 3.430, 1 896). To find this basis, Peirce used a method &lt;^ reminiscent of ordinary language philosophy: In a first step, he ana- Oh lyzed how speakers posit themselves in relation to their object of refer- H enee, and how listeners are able to interpret what the speakers say. Then he identified the specific words necessary for this process of communi- cation to be successful. By doing this, he found the most general struc- ture an utterance must have to be successfully interpreted, and all the elements essential to the functioning of an utterance (cf. SS1: 243-44; Midtgarden 2001: 91). By analyzing the syntax of different languages, he proved his results to be universally valid; this was the third step. He made use of, e.g., James Byrnes General Principles of the Structure of Languages (cf. SSI: 216, note 6), Alexander Csoma de Korös Tibetian Grammar (cf. SS1: 214), but also Hungarian, Tagalogian, Gaelic, and Welsh Translations of the Bible (cf. MS 1246). These analyses highlight important aspects of Peirce s conception of natural language: He pre- sumed that every sentence in every natural language contains a logical kernel, and that his formal logic is capable to express this kernel, to rep- resent the semantic structure of any sentence uttered in any natural lan- guage of the world. Peirce kept this conviction after having established his advanced logical system, his Existential Graphs, and he assumed equivalence between his graphs and the meaning of assertions made in natural language (cf. MS 484: 12-14). And he was convinced that it is the work of the logician and mathematician to reveal the logical form of natural language to render it "more intelligible": But every mathematician and every logician will tell the linguists that they are in possession of quite other systems of signs into which they</page><page sequence="6">are accustomed to translate words and forms of words and so to ren- £p der them more intelligible. (MS 654: 5) ^ ft The Existential Graphs can therefore be considered as an early for- -i mal approach to natural language. The astonishing thing is that they ^ contain pragmatic aspects. ^ En* 3 Peircés Pragmatic Grammar of Natural Language n The later Peirce divided his logic into speculative grammar, speculative 3 critic, and speculative rhetoric. And his discussion of the inventory of *§ natural language can be interpreted as being part of speculative gram- S. mar (cf. CP 1.444, 1896; EP2: 327). Peirce s outlook on natural Ian- g- guage was a pragmatic one. This becomes especially evident in MS 318, ™ where he gives a definition of the sign after an analysis of the function- • ing of signs in communication (cf. MS 318: 52-55), but not only O there. In all the definitions of the different aspects of the sign, this per- j£ spective is revealed. [2 His distinction of signs according to their "mode of Apprehension ^ of the Sign itself" lays the foundation for a pragmatic theory of Ian- c guage (EP2: 482). Peirce was the one to introduce the now famous and o very common distinction between tokens and types. But in linguistics, it g3 is less known that he distinguished also a third class, the tone, or tuone £ (cf., e.g., CP 4.537, 1906). His distinction was phenomenologically h founded: tones correspond to his category of Firstness, or quality, or w possibility; tokens to the category of secondness, or actuality; types belong to the category of Thirdness, regularity, or law. Although Peirce had difficulties finding an adequate terminology (cf., e.g., EP2: 483, 488; CP 8.347, 1908), the intentions he had making these distinctions are rather clear. According to a draft of his Monist article of 1906, types are significant forms, e.g. forms of words as abstract entities ruling their instantiations as tokens, or instances of types (cf. MS 292, 18-19). All linguistic signs are types; they have to be instantiated as tokens. Because it is possible that specific pronunciations induce changes in the signifi- cance of a word, these qualitative differences have to be taken into account, too. Peirce called them tuones (cf. SS3: 216). To see another import aspect of his distinctions, we have to cast a glance at the relation between the type and its meaning. Peirce elabo- rated on this at one point. He wrote: We speak of writing or pronouncing the word 'man; but it is only a replica, or embodiment of the word, that is pronounced or written. The word itself has no existence although it has a real being, consist- ing in the fact that existents will conform to it. It is a general mode of succession of three sounds or representamens of sounds, which becomes a sign only in the fact that a habit, or acquired law, will cause replicas of it to be interpreted as meaning a man or men. The word 317</page><page sequence="7">&lt;N and its meaning are both general rules; but the word alone of the two &lt;3 prescribes the qualities of its replicas in themselves. Otherwise the ^ 'word' and its 'meaning' do not differ, unless some special sense be | attached to meaning.' (CP 2.292, 1903) ^ In structuralist conceptions of natural language, the word and its ^ meaning were considered to be a unity formed by a code (cf. Saussure g 2000: 97 ff). Consequently, understanding a sentence could be perceived J2 as consisting in simply decoding the different linguistic signs ojf the sen- £&gt; tence. Such a conception could not account for processes of understand- ing involving interpretation that goes beyond mere decoding.5 Yet such ^ processes abound, and are, at least according to radical pragmaticists, ^ rather the rule than the exception in natural language understanding. O Let's assume that someone utters the following sentence: (1) He is the nicest person I've ever seen. ^ If structuralism had it right, then decoding and composing the lexi- &gt;y cai and grammatical meanings of the different items of the sentence ^ would give the meaning of the sentence in any context. But obviously, çj this is not true. For the sentence contains indexical signs, and these r, indexicals are responsible for the fact that the sentence means different things when uttered by different people, and is used to refer to different people. There are even interpretations of sentence (1) possible and legitimate, where the sentence means the opposite of what its words obviously state. If someone utters (1) referring to a colleague who tried to mob her, her dedicated dialog partner would assume that she did not mean what she said, and look for an interpretation that lies beyond what the sentence apparently said. Peirce s distinction between rules for pronouncing or writing a word and rules for interpreting it, or, as Short calls them, "formation rules" and "interpretation rules" (cf. Short 1984: 21), can be interpreted as providing a necessary, although not sufficient distinction to account for the fact that words and sentences do not always mean the same when used in different circumstances. All linguistic signs are types. But not all linguistic signs are symbols. We can also find icons in language (cf. EP2: 274) and indices. If we fol- lowed Roman Jakobson, then one of the major achievements of Peirce would be the defense that natural language contains iconic signs (cf. Jakobson 1962: 272-73; 1965: 349-50). But as a matter of fact, Peirce did not spend too much time finding icons in language; neither did he defend this view furiously. He was more interested in linguistic indexi- cality. He tried to define it, and he presented several extensive sub- classifications based on pragmatic and dialogic considerations (cf., e.g., MS 484: 6; CP 8.368, note, 1899-1900). According to Peirce, an index is an affair of here and now (cf., e.g., MS 409: 14). The index is 318</page><page sequence="8">not linked to its object by any description, or intension, or connota- £p tion. An index is a R a 3"1 sign, or representation, which refers to its object not so much because &gt;-* of any similarity or analogy with it, nor because it is associated with C". general characters which that object happens to possess, as because it eg is in dynamical (including spatial) connection both with the individ- K" ual object, on the one hand, and with the senses or memory of the o' person for whom it serves as a sign, on the other hand. (CP 2.305, £? 1901)6 c| p Considering this definition, it is not surprising that Peirce became a g; founder of the philosophical branch of modern indexicality research, and £ was perceived as a precursor to the so called "New Theory of Reference," as Quentin Smith called it (cf. DiLeo 1997: 592-93; Hilpinen 1995: * 287) 7 Peirce s outlook on the phenomenon of indexicality was of course &gt; very broad. He did not only discuss linguistic indexicality, as linguists and S philosophers of language do today. According to him, linguistic indexi- f cals form a sub-category of indexical signs; he defined them as degenerate * indices (cf. EP2: 163, 274, 286; CP 8.368, note, 1899-1900).8 They are g all types, and they need to be instantiated as tokens to function as index- ^ icals. Peirce wrote in a draft of his Grand Logic. ™ r That a word cannot in strictness of speech be an index is evident from &gt; this, that a word is a general, while an index is essentially an affair of here and now. A word is the same word every time it occurs and if it has any meaning has always the same meaning; but this or that have different applications every time they occur. Nor does this or that tell to what they refer. They only warn the hearer he must use his power of observation to find out what it meant. (MS 409: 13-14) Although Peirce realized that linguistic indexicals only function as tokens of types, he was not a precursor of Hans Reichenbach (cf. Burks 1949: 677-682); he barely defined the content of linguistic indexicals in terms of token-reflexivity in a Reichenbachian way (cf. Reichenbach 1966: 284ff). Consider the following paragraph from MS 318, where Peirce wrote about the meaning of pronouns, the most prominent set of linguistic indexicals: Pronouns are words whose whole object is to indicate what kind of collateral observation must be made in order to determine the signif- icance of some other part of the sentence. "Which" directs us to seek the quaesitum in the previous context; the personal pronouns to observe who is the speaker, who the hearer, etc. The demonstrative pronouns normally direct this sort of observation to the circum- stances of the utterance (perhaps to the way a finger points) rather than to the words. (MS 318: 66) ^19</page><page sequence="9">&lt;N According to this paragraph, pronouns don't have any content con- çu tributing to "the significance of the sentence". They contribute to the j2 meaning of a sentence by guiding the interpreter to specific referents of 3 the sentence, by providing an object, to echo David Kaplans definition Z of directly referential expressions (cf. Kaplan 1977: 495). 33 There are certain parallels between Kaplan and Peirce. According to &lt;u Kaplan, indexicals have a character, but no content. The character of an Ë expression is "set by linguistic conventions and, in turn, determines the - content of the expression in every context" (Kaplan 1977: 505). The £&gt; linguistic conventions "tell us for any possible occurrence of the index- ^ ical what the referent would be, but they do not constitute the content ►7- of such an occurrence" (Kaplan 1977: 523). The character is repre- ~&gt; sented by a function from context to content. Peirce put it similarly, ,_, but also very differently. If we could ask Peirce how linguistic indexicals f- 1 can have meaning, he would most probably say that they address inter- {J preters of utterances; that they contain a set of guidelines given by the &lt;^ grammar; and that these guidelines help the interpreter to find the 00 object meant. We could say that the personal pronoun in the utterance, ^ (2) Sieh sie genau an! ff! f-H encodes the restrictions: either look for an animate or an inanimate entity that is grammatically coded as female, under specific circum- stances it can also be yourself, or look for a set of some animate or inan- imate entities. For unlike Kaplan, Peirce takes the dialogical situation of the interpretation in account. Peirce categorized linguistic indexicals along the differences in their guidelines. His first more or less systematic classifications appeared around 1895. In MS 409, Peirce started his classification with the def- inition of pronouns as indicative words, and proceeded to distinguish subdivisions of them: (1) direct objective indicatives, (2) direct personal indicatives, (3) relative pronouns, and (4) adverbs and prepositions. Demonstrative pronouns form the set of direct objective indicatives. They depend on accompanying gestures, and should not be called demonstratives because they "do not exhibit anything: they only show in the sense of directing the hearer where to search for the thing meant. Most languages are miserably poor in these pronouns, because in talk people use gestures" (MS 409: 18-19).9 This definition is again remi- niscent of Kaplan, for Kaplan stated that the demonstrative should be treated as a "directly referential term whose referent was the demon- stratum of the associated demonstration" (Kaplan 1977: 52 1).10 Observing the functioning of indexicals in dialogues, Peirce came to the conclusion that there is a set of linguistic indexicals consisting of something we could call 'pure indexicals5.11 Peirce s 'pure indexicals' are pure because they make understanding easily possible. For their inter-</page><page sequence="10">preters do not need any associated demonstration to find the object £p indicated. Personal pronouns are such 'Peircean pure indexicals,' but ^ not all of them. He, she, and they function similarly to demonstratives. ^ Unlike the referents of/, we, or you, those of he, she, and they are not so ■"* easily identifiable in communication. Therefore, Peirce was reluctant to g- call them 'personal pronouns', and claimed that there can be no such ^ thing as a "third personal pronoun" (MS 409: 18). Similar to current g. research, Peirce placed adverbs and prepositions near either the cate- ^ gory of 'demonstratives,' or the one of cpure indexicals.' Adverbs and 3 prepositions in need of accompanying gestures, like left and right, are 3 "closely allied to 'demonstrative pronouns'," or "direct objective indica- 2. tives." Others, like here, and now, are similar to personal pronouns. K' Peirce defined the last class of linguistic indexicals, anaphora, the fol- lowing way: "Relative pronouns direct us to observe, not outward m objects, but the words that have been used, and their meanings" (MS Ö 409: 19). Some years later, he stated that relative pronouns "directly g refer, and need only refer, to the images in the mind which previous [2 words have created" (CP 2.305, 1901). a Peirce improved his classification of linguistic indexicals. He intro- ^ duced the class of proper names; he defined interjections as indices; in ° MS 1135, dated 1897, Peirce mentioned the special class formed "by §? units referring to individuals as prototypes" (MS 1135: 11) - meaning P words like e.g. yard. For "the word yard,' though it stands for an object £ of a general class, is indirectly indexical, since the yard-sticks themselves w are signs of the Parliamentary Standard" (CP 2.305, 1901). Another very important division he introduced are the selective pronouns as every, whatever, whoever, some (cf. MS 1 135: 1 1). This class can be subdivided into two groups: universal sélectives and particular ones. Universal sélec- tives are terms such as quivis, quilibet, quisquam, ullus, nullus, nemo, quisque, uterque, in English, any, every, all, no, none, whatever, whoever, everybody, anybody, nobody. Particular sélectives are expressions such as quis, quispiam, nescio quis, aliquis, quidam, and in English, some, some- thing, somebody, a, a certain, some or other, a suitable, one (cf. SS1: 209- 10). These definitions hinge again on observing what an interpreter can, or must do to identify the object denoted by the indexicals. The most interesting aspect is that Peirce consistently developed his theory out of an investigation of the situation of communication, and that he perceived indexicality to be omnipresent. Every sentence bears the mark of indexicality, therefore every sentence is only meaningful when interpreted and applied to a specific situation: Designations are absolutely indispensable both to communication and to thought. No assertion has any meaning unless there is some designation to show whether the universe of reality or what universe of fiction is referred to. (CP 8.368, note, 1899-1900) 321</page><page sequence="11">&lt;N And if we should not perceive them on the surface of the text, common ö nouns must function as indexicals in a sentence: 3 Every subject of a proposition, unless it is either an Index (like the JZ^ environment of the interlocutors, or something attracting attention ^ in that environment, as the pointing finger of the speaker) or a ^ Subindex (like a proper name, personal pronoun, or demonstrative) g must be a Precept, or Symbol, not only describing to the Interpreter 3 what is to be done, by him or others or both, in order to obtain an ^O Index of an individual (whether a unit or a single set of units) of ^ which the proposition is represented as meant to be true, but also C/3 assigning a designation to that individual, or, if it is a set, to each sin- £ gle unit of the set. (EP2: 286) M This has bearings on his theory of sentence meaning. If every sen- f-H tence is at least implicitly quantified, and if indexicality prompts the CJ interpreter to look for the specific objects intended, then the sentence &lt;J can only be interpreted by a mechanism that Dan Sperber and Deidre ^ Wilson, prominent representatives of Relevance Theory, would call Z computational, or inferential (cf. Sperber &amp; Wilson 1996; Wilson &amp; ^ Sperber 1993). The meaning of the sentence is not just given composi- ez tionally The interpreter has to find the object meant (cf. Pape 1991: E""1 173), then she must interpret the sentence as so connected with the object (cf. Houser 1992: 494). This involves the identification of the object (cf., e.g., MS 318: 34), and this identification, as will become clear, involves abductive reasoning. Looking at Peirce from this per- spective, he seems to be a precursor of radical pragmatics. The claim that Peirce was a rather radical pragmaticist can be con- firmed by taking into account what he said about symbols. Symbols get their meaning, as Peirce stated, by usage (cf. MS 404: 5); but lexical meaning is general (cf., e.g., EP2: 342). This has, of course, epistemo- logical and metaphysical reasons and implications. As a linguist, I dare to drop the metaphysical implications, and turn to the epistemological ones. For they have direct bearings on the functioning of symbols in communication. Peirce assumed that a symbol becomes meaningful thanks to the experiences of its users. Therefore, the breadth and the depth of a sign slowly change, "its meaning inevitably grows, incorpo- rates new elements and throws off old ones" (EP2: 264). According to Peirce s semiotic theory of mind, the symbol is in its origin an icon: Every symbol is, in its origin, either an image of the idea signified, or a reminiscence of some individual occurrence, person, or thing, con- nected with its meaning, or is a metaphor. (EP2: 264) The process of symbolization rests on the process of perception. Sym- bols are the results of an interplay of the environment, our sensorium,</page><page sequence="12">and the society we live in. They are the pragmatically confirmed results of J^ our interaction with the environment (cf., e.g., EP2: 320ff; MS 318: 3 9 Iff). The original sense data that were present in the original experience ^ vanished, "the actual shock, etc., are no longer there, the quality of the •"» event has associated itself in the mind with similar past experiences" (cf. g- CP 2 A AG, 1903). The composition of impressions in significances of °§ symbols leads to general ideas of the entity denoted: if I hear the word g. dog, then I have "some general ideas of dogs' ways, of the law of caninity, ^ some of them invariable so far as I have observed, such as his frequent 3 napping, others merely usual, such as his way of cycling when he is 3 preparing to take a nap" (EP 2: 223). In the act of interpretation, the 8. symbol is translated back into a mental icon, a "composite photograph" g' of the thing meant, or the state of affairs or event signified. It can even be an "auditory composite" of the sound heard (EP2: 317-19). But on the * level of the single word, generality implies indefiniteness: D z It seems preferable, for a reason that will soon appear, to say that an w adective [sic!] or common noun in the singular number (especially, if ^ it carries the indefinite article,) is in respect to what it stands for, c 'Indefinite.' Indefiniteness essentially involves a May-be; 'a man is one 0 man alone; but it may be this, it may be that, it may be each in turn. ^ To May-be is very peculiar in that it implies to May-not-be. As to the [2 predicates that can be truly predicated of that which an adjective or £ common noun in the singular [d\enotes, or stands for, that for a direct &gt; perception of which its utterance is intended to be a substitute, a few are predicable with a stronger "Modality" than that of the May-be. A Man, for instance, Must be born in full life of a Male and a Female man and Must have a spinal column separating two bags, or com- partments, of his body; and he positively Is, (without Must-being nor any involving of the negatives of the predicate, such as characterizes mere May-being?) markedly hairy only in parts, and elsewhere but rudimentarily, and he Is capable of grammatical speech, Is a user of tools, or Is a member of a tribe that mostly possesses these powers. But the vast majority of the true predicate of an Indefinite subject are mere May-be predicates [ellipsis]. (MS 641: 25-27) To become definite, a lexical item needs to be applied. And also in respect to symbols, a principle of compositionality, similar to Frege s, is not enough (cf. EP2: 292; Short 1984: 27). Peirce held that in dia- logues, "every utterance naturally leaves the right of further exposition in the utterer", and that "honest people, when not joking, intend to make the meaning of their words determinate, so that there shall be no latitude of interpretation at all." He wrote that people believe they suc- ceed in making their words definite, but that the possibility to achieve precision of speech is probably only given when talking about abstract subjects like the theory of numbers (EP2: 351). So Peirce knew that 323</page><page sequence="13">&lt;N most of the time, especially in everyday conversation, definiteness in ö communication is an achievement, and cannot rest on a simple process g of decoding of words and composing them to a sentence meaning. 3 The classification of interprétants can be interpreted as a systemati- 2 zation of the process of interpretation of sentences. From such a per- 33 spective it shows the steps necessary to make the meaning of an uttered &lt;u sentence definite. In MS 318, Peirce defined three different interpre- ti tants: the emotional, the energetic or existential, and the logical inter- - prêtant. The emotional interprétant is defined as the sense of how to £&gt; use a word, "a sense of comprehending the meaning of the sign," (MS ^ 318: 79), or "a feeling of recognition" (MS 318: 156). It is a prerequi- »7- site to interpretation, and Peirce compared it to the familiarity with the ^ usage of the word: Lh When a person has become acquainted with a word, so that it seems rj familiar to him, and so that he knows by experience that when he uses ^ it, others get a pretty good idea of what is in his mind, and when they ^ use it, he has a pretty good idea of what is in his mind, he says he &gt;-y knows the meaning ofthat word. (MS 835: 2) ^ It can therefore be equated with the lexical and grammatical meaning r of words and the syntax of a natural language, not in a code-like sense, but rather in a Wittgensteinian way of knowing how to use a word, or the syntax. There are still other emotional interprétants. In fact, any emotion ensuing on the interpretation of a sign is an emotional interprétant. And an emotional interprétant intended by an author, or a composer, is a "highly developed" one (MS 318: 36; cf. 35). The next step in the process of interpretation presupposes efforts of the interpreter. Peirce called these efforts energetic interprétants. He made a distinction between "efforts in the outer or the inner world" (MS 318: 36). He defined efforts in the inner world as "inhibition, or self-restraint, which make so large a part of the effort to pay attention" (MS 318: 36). These energetic interprétants of the inner world can therefore be defined as the efforts of interpretation of utterances lead- ing to a propositional content. We can try to distinguish two different processes of energetic interprétants of the inner world. In the first process, the interpreter must render the indefinite symbols of the sen- tence more definite by composing a sentence meaning. Doing this, he reaches the logical interprétant, the thought conveyed in this process. This thought is "general in its possibilities of reference (i.e. refers or is related to whatever there may be of a certain description)" (MS 318: 89). Therefore, it has to be applied to a situation. And this is done in the other process, the resolution of the indexicals. In this process, the logi- cal interprétant is evaluated in respect to the specific situation. And then, a habit of action, or interpretation, can be confirmed, or changed. 324</page><page sequence="14">These inner efforts are a prerequisite for efforts in the outer world, fp the actions ensuing upon the interpretation of a sign, or, to put it in lin- ^ guistic terminology, the perlocutionary effects (cf. Searle 1984). Peirce ^ can be seen as a precursor to speech act theory, for he defined the use of ■"» signs as a form of action (cf. SS2: 212, 332). And he stated, "an asser- g* tion belongs to the class of phenomena like going before a notary and ^ making an affidavit, executing a deed" (CP 8.313, 1905; cf. Brock % 1981; Thibaud 1997). In MS 318, he especially illustrated how it is ^ that a sign can be interpreted by an action. And he described his con- 3 ception of the interplay of emotional, energetic, and logical interpre- j3 tants in the process of interpretation in the following paragraph: a. C/5* Let us imagine an officer of infantry to give the word of command, ™ "Ground arms!" The attitude of the officer and all the surrounding « circumstances shows that the utterance is the expression of his près- q ent will. That present volition is the object represented. Each soldier ^ feels the familiarity of the words: That is the emotional interprétant. £ He is stimulated in obedience to that will to bring the butt of his r musket to the ground in the regular way. The effort of doing that is * the energetic interprétant. (MS 318: 37, cf. 80, 157, 250) g Sometimes, Peirce seemed to assume that the energetic interprétant w as an action in the outer world follows right after the emotional inter- £ prêtant, assuming therefore a sort of blind behaviorism (cf. MS 318: S 334-35). But in the paragraph cited, Peirce wrote that the object rep- resented is the present volition of the officer. And if the interprétant is the effect of the interpretation of the sign, which represents the object, then Peirce had to assume that the energetic interprétant ensues only after the interpretation of this volition. And this volition involves a propositional content. Peirce also wrote that the "meaning of the word of command 'Ground arms,' is the intended slamming down of the muskets" (MS 318: 214, my emphasis), not just any slamming down, but the slamming down the officer intended. Again, this presupposes the comprehension of the proposition of the order of the officer. In any case, the interpretation of the speech act is an achievement in context. For it can only be understood when the utterance is applied to the sit- uation, for the "attitude of the officer and all the surrounding circum- stances shows that the utterance is the expression of his present will" (MS 318: 37, my emphasis). The logical interprétant, the proposition to put down the arms, and the will of the officer, the illocutionary force of the utterance, can be understood only by taking into account the context of situation. And understanding becomes visible when the sol- diers execute the order. Peirce introduced another important division of interprétants: the more abstract classification of interprétants as immediate, dynamical, and final ones. We can interpret this classification as representing 325</page><page sequence="15">&lt;N different modalities of the possible emotional, energetic, and logical ö interprétants (cf. Müller 1999: I4lff; Short 1996). 12 In an entry in his g Logic Notebook, dated October 23, 1906, Peirce wrote that the imme- d diate interprétant of a sign is the "immediate pertinent possible effect Z in its unanalyzed primitive entirety". He explained that the immediate ^ interprétant can be a "vague quality of feelings," the "idea of an effort," &lt;u or the "idea of a form or a general type." He defined the dynamical S interprétant as the "actual effect produced on a given interpreter on a - given occasion in a given stage of his considerations of the sign". This £&gt; dynamical interprétant can again be a feeling, an action, or a habit. The ^ final interprétant is defined as the last effect of the sign insofar as it is ^ intended by the sign, the ideal interprétant towards which the process &gt;-. of interpretation tends (SS3: 224-25). With this cross-classification, we HH gain the possibility to distinguish nine different interprétants (cf. CP £-h 8.369-72, 1908). We can distinguish, e.g., a sign that intends to gen- QJ erate an emotional interprétant, but not a logical one, and signs aiming &lt;J at the truth. And we can distinguish processes of interpretation, where co the intended interprétant is reached, and processes of interpretations £ that failed because the intended interprétant was not reached. These are &lt;3 important distinctions to classify aspects of human communication. Ph And we have some evidence that Peirce applied this classification to H communication himself, when he introduced the intentional, effectual, and communicational interprétant (cf. Short 1996: 507), and pre- sented himself, once again, as a precursor to pragmatic thinking: There is the Intentional Interprétant, which is a determination of the mind of the utterer; the Effectual Interprétant, which is a determina- tion of the mind of the interpreter; and the Communicational Inter- prétant, or say the Cominterpretant, which is a determination of that mind into which the minds of the utterer and interpreter have to be fused in order that any communication should take place. (SESI 196-97). 5. Premises of Understanding: Shared Rationality and Common Ground Peirces grammar is important for pragmatics, for it classifies linguistic phenomena consistently from a communicative point of view. Many of Peirce s ideas on communication are part of what could be called his speculative rhetoric. Unfortunately, Peirce only sketched what he per- ceived to be this part of his logic. He broadly characterized it as "the doctrine of the general conditions of the reference of Symbols and other Signs to the Interprétants which they aim to determine" (CP 2.93, 1902/3); it bears characteristics of what we would call today methodology (cf. EP 2: 260); it is "the theory of advancements of 326</page><page sequence="16">knowledge of all kinds" (EP2: 256); and it is the study of the question, £p how knowledge can be most effectively communicated (cf. EP2: 19). S As such, rhetoric, or methodeutic, presupposes an investigation of the -^ processes of human communication, and even an investigation of the ^ human mind, for one "ought to know just what the processes are g* whereby an idea can be conveyed to a human mind and become °p embedded in its habits" (EP2: 330). % That is what Peirce did in different paragraphs of his writings. In ^ MS 318, he dwelled on the difficulties of communication: p It is because the purpose of a sign is to supplement the ideas of the life £. of which I the interpreter, am a part, - ideas which I derive directly §• from my own life, - with a copy of a scrap torn out of another s life w or rather from his panorama of life his idea of his life; and I need to # know what place on my panorama of the universe, my idea of my life, q I am to insert a recopy of this copies. No sign can ever fully tell its &gt; interpreter where the recopy of the copies scrap of its utterer s life that g it contains ought to be attached to that interpreter s own panorama of t"1 his own life. [. . .] But the utterer has no ideas but his own ideas. He DC lives no life but his own life. Let him try to specify a place on the o interpreter s panorama, and he can only look over his own panorama, ° where he can find nothing but his own ideas. On that panorama he £? has, however, no difficulty in finding the interpreters life, that is to £ say, his idea of it, and among the interpreter s ideas, that is his own h idea of the interpreters ideas, he finds an idea ofthat part of the inter- w prêter s panorama to which he conceives this scrap should be attached and this he expresses in his sign for the interpreter s benefit. The lat- ter has to go through a similar roundabout process to find a place in his own life that seems to correspond with his idea of the utterer's idea of his idea of life and with all these changes of costumes there is such immanent danger of mistake that the utterer would have done far better simply to express his own ideas as well as he could convey it to the interpreter and allow the latter to find the place in his own life as he thinks of it. (MS 318: 197-99) Although language is vague, and although every sentence uttered bears the mark of its contextual use, communication, hence under- standing is possible. For according to Peirce, people have certain resources to achieve understanding. One of these resources, which con- tributes to understanding, is self-control, probably understood as a sort of logica utens (cf., e.g., CP 2.204, 1901; RLT 109), but also the pre- supposition that every person possesses it. This allows me to presuppose that my opponent uses the words more or less the way I do, that she shares my standards of plausibility, and reasons more or less the way I do (cf. SS3: 325). Another prerequisite for understanding is a common ground, for "two men cannot converse without some common ground of experiences ~27</page><page sequence="17">&lt;N undergone by both conveying which they speak" (MS 1 135: 10). Usu- ö ally, we also take this common ground for granted. In MS 612, Peirce g explained why: I meet someone in the streets. This someone speaks the 3 same language I do, and we seem to share most of our physiological Z attributes. I draw the conclusion that his experiences are pretty much 3J the same as mine, and that we can, theoretically, change our perspec- &lt;u tives. The proof of the shared physiological and the indications of the Ë shared cognitive properties make me assume a shared experiential - background, which gives me sufficient Trou ctt(3 to change perspectives £&gt; (cf. SS3: 325). 13 We assume a common ground, a set of believes taken ^ for granted as part of the background of conversation. Communica- »^ tion, then, can be seen as the re-constitution of this common ground. p. For every assertion intends to alter the common ground by, to use ^ Robert Stalnakers words, "changing the presuppositions of the partic- £- i ipants in the conversation by adding the content of what is asserted to ÇJ what is presupposed" (Stalnaker 1978: 323). 14 According to Peirce, &lt;J assertions are made to convince the other that certain states of affairs oo or things are true. We want "to determine an assent to the proposition 2 in the minds" of our listeners: we aim to make the other accept certain &lt;^ beliefs we put forward in our assertions as being true (EP2: 312; cf. C* MS 478: 60; CP 8.313, 1905). 6. How to Re-Constitute a Common Ground? Peirce illustrated how the re-constitution of a common ground is pos- sible by relating an episode. Once he crossed the college yard in Har- vard accompanied by a fellow student on a midsummer afternoon. He described his impressions the following way: "the grass shone like emer- alds," "the red-brick buildings [. . .] were blazing in a fresh coat of something like vermillion." His fellow-student obviously did not have the same experiences. Instead, he "remarked upon the pleasing har- mony of color between the grass, the foliage, and the buildings." Peirce was flabbergasted: With eyes feeling as if their balls were being twisted by some inquisi- tor, I at first understood the remark as a sorry joke, like the gibes of some Indian captive at the want of skill of his tormentor. But I soon found that it was the utterance of a sincere feeling, and then, by a series of questions, soon discovered that my friend was blind to the red element of color. (MS 318: 62-63) Peirce understood that the color-blindness affects the possibility of constituting a common ground between his friend and himself in respect to the experience of colors. But he became aware of the differ- ences in perception because, first of all, his friend was sincere, and sec- ondly, because he was able to 'triangulate,' as Donald Davidson would 328</page><page sequence="18">call it; Peirce did not use this term, but he described the process of tri- £p angulation (cf. also Pietarinen 2006: 65ff, 428f) • 3 According to Davidson, triangulation is a condition for thought and ^ language to evolve. Put roughly, it describes a situation with two agents ^ and an object in the world. Triangulation is the result of a threefold g- interaction. The agents are interacting with each other, and at the same ^ time, each agent is interacting with the object in the world. Each agent g. gains intersubjective knowledge about the object by observing the object ^ and the reactions of the other agent, and each agent gains knowledge of J3 the concept of the other by observing the others reactions to the object 3 (cf. Davidson 1992: 120). The process of triangulation itself does not a. presuppose a language. "One sees this in its simplest form in a school of g' fish, where each fish reacts almost instantaneously to the motions of the others" (Davidson 1997: 128). It only presupposes the sharing of * responses to at least certain stimuli, for this sharing allows the creatures Ö to correlate each others responses with what they are responses to. In z this process, an interpersonal element emerges (cf. Davidson 1997a: 26). [2 And this is necessary for thought and language to evolve: pj c The primitive triangle, constituted by two (and typically more than O two) creatures reacting in concert to features of the world and to each ?ö others reactions, thus provides the framework in which thought and £ language can evolve. (Davidson 1997a: 27) J3 öd This is a rough sketch of Davidsons version of triangulation. Pietari- nen states that Peirce never fully explained his view of triangulation (cf. Pietarinen 2006: 428f). But it is striking to read the early Peirce s answer concerning the question whether we have an intuitive self- consciousness through Davidson. It seems that Peirce gave here an illus- tration of Davidsons analysis of triangulation, and of the acquisition of language and concepts: The child learns to understand the language; that is to say, a connec- tion between certain sounds and certain facts becomes established in his mind. [. . .] It must be about this time that he begins to find that what these people about him say is the very best evidence of fact. So much so, that testimony is even a stronger mark of fact than the facts themselves, or rather than what must now be thought of as the appear- ances themselves. (I may remark, by the way, that this remains so through life; testimony will convince a man that he himself is mad.) A child hears it said that the stove is hot. But it is not, he says; and, indeed, that central body is not touching it, and only what that touches is hot or cold. But he touches it, and finds the testimony con- firmed in a striking way. Thus, he becomes aware of ignorance, and it is necessary to suppose a self in which this ignorance can inhere. So testimony gives the first dawning of self-consciousness. (W2: 202) 329</page><page sequence="19">(N For the late Peirce, triangulation was even more important. An ö utterance cannot be understood without collateral observations to -g resolve the explicit and implicit indexicals of the sentence uttered. And d this resolution presumes a process of triangulation (cf. MS 318: 66). 15 Z Interpreting indexicals transcends divergences. It helps the agents to ^ orient themselves in the situation of communication and to find out &lt;u what it is that the other is talking about. But how can they find out S what the other is talking about? £&gt; 7. Abduction in Communication ç- Peirce gave a sketchy answer to this question in his review of Royce s »7- Religious Aspect of Philosophy: ^ Namely it might be asked how two different men can know they are r, speaking of the same thing. Suppose, for instance, one man should r &gt; say a flash of lightning was followed by thunder and another should , deny it. How would they know they meant the same flash? The ^ answer is that they would compare notes somewhat as follows. One h^ would say, "I mean that very brilliant flash which was preceded by ^~j three slight flashes, you know." The second man would recognize the 2j mark, and thus by a probable and approximate inference they would ^ conclude they meant the same flash. (W5: 225-26) He did probably not mean 'induction' when he wrote 'inference' in this paragraph, neither 'statistical deduction.' It is more likely that he meant hypothesis. He defined hypothesis in the 1880s the following way: M has, for example, the numerous marks P', P", P"\ etc. S has the proportion r of the marks P\ P", P"\ etc. Hence, probably and approximately, S has an r-likeness to M. (W4: 419) Hypothesis is an 'evidencing process:' I can understand what you are pointing at by going through a process of comparing notes. Comparing notes helps me to establish a probable equation: The object x you meant is the object y I identified. According to most commentators, Peirce changed the definition of hypothesis soon after his Review of Royce, sometime after 1891. Abduc- tion became then the process of the introduction of a new idea. Sami Paavola called this the methodological perspective (cf. Paavola 2004: 246ff). And Paavola also showed that it is not necessary, or even ade- quate, to draw a heavy line between the earlier and the later conception of abduction. Paavola states that if we want to distinguish between an early and a later period, according to the earlier version, we could call abduction an "inference to an explanation," according to the later con- ception an "inference to the plausible explanation" (Paavola 2004:</page><page sequence="20">265). Especially for the conception of understanding in communica- J^ tion, Paavola's interpretation comes in very handy, and is justified, as 3 becomes clear in MS 318. There, Peirce repeatedly pictured scenes ^ where someone utters a sentence and the listeners have to triangulate to "* get to the meaning of the utterance. One of the scenes depicted is g* located in an apartment on Piazza di Spagna in Rome. Three gentle- *§ men are lounging together. One is in a long chair, the other upon a g. lounge. The third one is standing by the open casement overlooking the ^ square, holding a newspaper in his hands, when he suddenly states: 3 "Verily, it is a terrible fire" (MS 318: 64). Peirce went on to explain how 3 the listeners interpret this sentence: 2. rt The other twain are too lazy to ask. The longchaired one thinks the ™ utterer was looking at the newspaper when he made his exclamation, * and concludes that there has been a conflagration in Teheran, in Syd- çj ney, or in some such place, appalling enough to be flashed around the ^ globe. But the couched man thinks the utterer was looking out of the 5 window, and there must be a fire down in the Corso, or in that direc- r tion. (MS 318: 64-65) [? o We can safely define their processes of interpretation as making ^ inferences not to the best, but to the plausible explanation. This holds w even if we assume that after the construction of a hypothesis, some sort £ of evaluation has to take place. For as in science, truth plays an impor- &gt; tant role in communication. Peirce assumed that we take the veracity of most of the assertions we hear for granted: I do not suppose that, on all the surface of this planet, there breathes one sane man so utterly devoid of veracity that, among all the asser- tions about matters within his knowledge which he will utter in the course of an average day (including such remarks as "It is a fine day: I hope we may have a long spell of weather like it," etc.) one half are lies. The only person I ever knew who came at all near to that was a charming woman, otherwise, most estimable; and I always deemed her to be affected with pseudomania; for it certainly was an affliction, although, when one had become habituated to it her romancing was graceful and entertaining; and even she did not falsify half the time. (MS 318: 258-59) If we conceptualize communication as a process in which the addressee goes through abduction to find the object meant, and then evaluates the sentence in respect to the situation uttered, truth plays an important part in our explanation. If I know what object my opponent meant, I can evaluate his assertion. Therefore, every speaker is in dan- ger to be made reliable for the veracity of his assertion. And making "an assertion belongs to the class of phenomena like going before a notary 331</page><page sequence="21">&lt;N and making an affidavit, executing a deed [. . .]" (CP 8.313, 1905). We &lt;u even use the sign of our acceptance of this responsibility to induce g assent in our opponents (cf. EP2: 312). 3 Of course, Peirce knew that there are instances when dialogue part- Z ners suspend the assumption of truthfulness, e.g., when they are being ^ polite (cf. CP 5.546, 1905). And if I am a scientist working in a field &lt;u where some things remain uncertain, I sometimes make assertions that £ cannot be a hundred percent, "exactly true," but at least approximately - so (cf. CP 5.565, 1901). How else would it be possible to talk about £&gt; black holes in the universe (cf. Hookway 2000: 64-65)? ^ But there are still other reasons why I would not want to be precise. ^ Peirce elaborated on them by making the following example. Someone ^ says to another person: "A man I could mention seems to be a little con- ,_, ceited." The speaker seems to suggest that the person in view is the f-H addressed. But because she does not make clear whom she means, she QJ does not "authorize" any interpretation. "She can still say if she likes, &lt;J that she does not mean the person addressed" (EP 2: 351). Peirce's co example can easily be analyzed by a classical Gricean approach. The Z speaker flouts the fourth of Grices maxims, the maxim of manner, and &lt;3 thereby achieves a conversational implicature, provided that she still P^ intends to follow the cooperative principle (cf. Grice 1967). A Peircean H analysis is possible, too, and even more revealing. According to this per- spective, the speaker exploits the necessity of interpreters to form hypotheses to plausible explanations by broadening the range of possi- ble objects of reference. Even if the addressee might form the hypothe- sis that he is the one being talked about, he cannot pin her down. She saves her skin. Even if she had meant him, she does not have to go before the notary to make a confession. This analysis also shows that according to Peirce, communication must be strategical, that the indef- initeness of language can be used strategically, and that the necessity of abduction leaves a dialogical space for escape.16 &amp; Formal Pragmatics According to Peirce Relevance theory presumes that the logical form of a sentence, the out- come of the decoding of the linguistic signs, is underdetermined and not equivalent to a proposition. Propositions presuppose the resolution of indexicals and a contextual enrichment (cf., e.g. Wilson &amp; Sperber 1993). By describing the process of interpretation as a complex inter- play of a specification of the meanings of the words and the application to a situation, Peirce almost makes himself a precursor to Relevance Theory (cf. Sperber &amp; Wilson 1996), or Default Semantics (cf. Jaszc- zolt 2006). And he almost seems to anticipate the critique of Relevance Theory and other radical pragmaticists of approaches trying to formal- ize the meaning of utterances (cf., e.g., Récanati 2004a). For he once 332 wrote:</page><page sequence="22">Diagrams and diagrammatoidal figures are intended to be applied to Jp the better understanding of states of things, whether experienced, or £* read of, or imagined. Such a figure cannot, however, show what it is ^ to which it is intended to be applied; nor can any other diagram avail 2 for that purpose. The where and the when of the particular experi- £ enee, or the occasion or other identifying circumstance of the panic- era ular fiction to which the diagram is to be applied, are things not £• capable of being diagrammatically exhibited. Describe and describe £' and describe, and you never can describe a date, a position, or any £0 homaloidal quantity. [. . .] If a diagram cannot do it, algebra cannot: &lt;$ for algebra is but a sort of diagram; and if algebra cannot do it, Ian- g guage cannot: for language is but a kind of algebra. It would, cer- 2. tainly, in one sense be extravagant to say that we can never tell what £' we are talking about; yet, in another sense, it is quite true. (CP 3.419, 1892) D If this was the case, we could stop here. But maybe Peirce was speak- z ing only "tongue in cheek."17 For Peirce was, first and foremost, a logi- w cian. And after the turn of the century, he developed a logical system, ^ which represents sentences as uttered, interpreted, and applied to situ- c ations. This system shows that Peirce did not assume that pragmatics o and formalization are mutually exclusive. ^ Comparing Peirce and Discourse Representation Theory (DRT), a £ contemporary formal approach to analyze the meaning of discourse, h helps to evaluate the failures and achievements of Peirce as a 'formal' w pragmaticist. As John Sowa pointed out, Peirces Existential Graphs (EG) bear striking similarities to DRT, which was invented by Hans Kamp, and further developed by, e.g., Nicholas Asher and Alex Las- carides (cf. Asher &amp; Lascarides 1998, 2003; Kamp 1981; Kamp &amp; Reyle 1993; Sowa 1997). One of Kamps objectives was to solve some of the puzzles of 'donkey sentences. Consider the following sentences (cf. Kadmon2001:26fif): (1) A donkey comes in. It is pretty. (2) If a peasant owns a donkey, he pets it. Sentence (1) can be translated the following way: (1.1) 3x [donkey (x) A come in (x) A pretty (x)] But we cannot translate sentence (2) the following way: (2.1)3x3)/ [peasant (x) A donkey (y) A owns (x,y)] -&gt; pets (x,y) For then we would not get the right truth conditions: the noun phrase (NP) a donkey cannot be referential in this sentence. We have to come up with the following translation: 333</page><page sequence="23">(2.1) VtfVy [(peasant (x) a donkey (y) A owns (x,y)) - » pets (x,y)] But do we really have to translate indefinite NPs sometimes as exis- tentials, and sometimes as universals? And what is the range of the scope of a restrictor? To solve these problems, Kamp proposed a seman- tic framework with the following features: the basic semantic value of a bit of discourse is not its truth conditional content, but the role it plays in the extension of information; truth is defined for an entire discourse, a complete Discourse Representation Structure (DRS); and definite and indefinite NPs are neither quantificational nor referential, but they are treated as variables, or as discourse referents that do not need to cor- respond to a specific entity in a model, or in a world. Existential quan- tification takes scope over the entire discourse and binds all free variables in it, and quantification is treated as unselective and restricted just as David Lewis proposed for sentences with adverbs such as always, sometimes, often, etc. (cf. Lewis 1975). This apparatus allows DRT to adopt a traditional treatment of anaphora, but to go beyond sentence boundaries and represent discourse, thereby incorporating bits of prag- matics (cf. Kadmon 2001: 25-67). DRT represents the discourse structures by drawing boxes and embeddings; the representation is, therefore, an iconic one. The outer- most box represents the matrix structure of a discourse; boxes embed- ded in the matrix structure represent subparts of the discourse. Accessibility between the boxes is defined by construction rules. The DRS of sentences are constructed according to these rules. If we apply the relevant construction rules of Kamp and Heim to sentence (1) and (2), we get the following results (cf. Kamp &amp; Reyle 1993: 166ff.): (2.2) Uh &lt;U on z o H U &lt; &lt; Pi H 334</page><page sequence="24">Truth is defined in DRT for an entire discourse, and the verification clause for conditionals is, stated informally: An embedding function f verifies El^El iff for every embedding function F which extends fand verifies the conditions in Kp there is an embedding function F which extends P and verifies the condi- tions in IC,. (Kadmon 2001: 34)18 As we did not introduce new variables in the universe of the DRS of (2), but in a subordinate DRS of the matrix DRS, the DRS of (2) is true iff every function verifying the left-hand DRS in the matrix DRS can be extended to a function that verifies the right-hand DRS in it. DRT takes our intuition seriously that indefinite NPs are associated with existential statements. But it does not treat indefinite NPs as exis- tential statements. An indefinite NP functions as a variable, which may get bound by the existential quantification over the whole discourse, but does not necessarily have to, as the DRS of sentences (1) and (2) illustrate (cf. Kadmon 2001: 34-36; Kamp &amp; Reyle 1993: 141-181). Peirces graphs, at least the graphs of the beta part, are equivalent to this part of Discourse Representation Theory in at least two respects. Peirce would translate sentence (2) as follows: (2.3) Peirce s representations of the semantic structure of sentences are iconic, too, but he used, of course, different conventions. Kamp works with variables and the substitution and equation of variables in subor- dinate discourse structures. In Peirces EG, the so-called lines of identity connect the individuals filling the blanks of the rhemes of the spot, or the predicates (cf. CP 4.403ff). Kamp uses boxes to represent subordi- nate discourse relations. Peirce worked with cuts; these cuts, closed lines encircling parts of the graphs, symbolize negation. By nesting these cuts, Peirce s graphs are able to represent implication and univer- sal quantification. The nesting of cuts yields the right representations. Peirces line of identity can cross these cuts, and therefore depict anaphoric relations (cf. Sowa 1997: 432-33). §' I. | rt n" 5&gt;* S • a w r1 X G O o &amp; w r r 335</page><page sequence="25">Obviously, there is a slight advantage in Peirce's representation. It does not need any specific rules for implication. The nesting of cuts is enough. And there are still other treasures hidden in his EG. Peirce introduced in the Gamma Part of his EG possibilities, higher order predicates, and propositional attitudes (cf., e.g., SS3: I64ff; Pape 2000). Therefore, he was able to express modality and speech acts, as in the following sentence: (3) Es ist möglich, dass ein Medizinmann befiehlt, dass es regnet. Pape transformed the sentence in the following graph (3.1), making use of Peirce's convention for modality, the shadings. The square shad- ings depict the universe of modality; the striped space depicts the sub- universe, or the province, of intentions (cf. Pape 2000: 59): (3.1) Long before anyone else, Peirce tried to implement propositional attitudes, modalities, and even speech acts into his logical systems. But these efforts remained attempts. The gamma part of the EG is rather sketchy, because Peirce did not give us any rules of inference. Pape doubts that it is possible even to express all assertions, which contain the operators 'possible,' 'factual,' and 'necessary' (cf. Pape 2000: 60). Other than the gamma part, the alpha and beta graphs are complete systems of logic. But unfortunately, even they do not always yield pre- cise analyses of linguistic expressions: Peirce's linguistic analyses are not always convincing (cf. Sowa 1997: 427). What is especially problematic is that it is not very clear how the syntax of a sentence is to be trans- formed in the semantic structure of the graph. Peirce lacked something, which would be a pragmatic analogue to Kamp's construction rules. And this causes significant problems. According to Peirce, the graph (4.1) expresses the meaning of sentence (4): (4) There is some married woman who will commit suicide in case her husband fails in business. Uh &lt;u | ? o H u &lt; z, &lt; H 336</page><page sequence="26">(4.1) The whole graph is written on Metal, the modality pheme for actu- ality (cf. CP 4.553-54, 4.569, 1906; SS3: 166-69, 184). Retranslated in natural language, the graph should yield the following result: (4.2) There is a wife of someone, and it is not the case that this some- one fails and his wife does not commit suicide. Omitting the NP in business, we could express the intended mean- ing of (4) in a normal predicate logical form as: (4.3) 3x3y [(x (man), ^ (woman) A x,y (married to)) A (x (fails) - * y (suicides))] But the graph (4.1) does not necessarily express this. Obviously, the husband remains implicit. If we did not know that a wife has, normally, a husband, we would never think that the graph (4.1) depicts sentence (4). For the lexical semantics of wife does not necessarily presuppose the existence of a husband. Wife can, according to the Oxford Dictionary, mean several things: married woman esp. in relation to her husband, in an archaic use a woman, esp. an old or uneducated one, in compositions it can also mean a fishwife, housewife, and midwife. Therefore, Peirce had to presuppose the first meaning. Otherwise, he could not treat the noun wife here as a two place predicate. Although Peirce s formalism is too weak for extensive analyses of nat- ural language sentences, his EG are superior to DRT in one respect. Although Nirit Kadmon calls Kamps approach a formal pragmatic one, it is not unequivocally admitted that this is right. Kadmon rather claims that DRT provides a basis for a formal approach to pragmatics by stipu- lating that a DRS represents a context, and therefore contains pragmati- cally supplied material. But she does never exacdy state how much context is involved (cf., e.g. Kadmon 2001 : 87ff). In contrast, Peirce s EG are pragmatic through and through. Peirce was interested in showing how the meaning of a sentence and the situation of use interact. This led 3 ? I. ? P «-* O* 5&gt;* r+ CO a z w X c o o 7* w r 337</page><page sequence="27">&lt;N him to develop an extraordinary semantic ontology. Meaning is always a ö relation between a sentence and a specific situation. This holds for p graphs, too. Peirce represented the situation a sentence is applied to by 3 the sheet of assertion, or the phemic sheet. The phemic sheet "iconizes Z the Universe of Discourse," or "the field of attention," "the general object ^ ofthat attention" (CP 4.561, note, 1905; SS3: 166). And making an &lt;u assertion, or some other speech act, is represented as scribing a graph on S the phemic sheet, thereby relating it to a specific type of situation. Peirce - developed in his EG a sort of situation semantics reminiscent of Jon Bar- £&gt; wise and John Perry. They had defined meaning as "a relation between ^ utterances and described situations" (Barwise &amp; Perry 1986: 19; cf. Pape H7 2000: 54f). But he also included intentional aspects into the phemic ^ sheet, and therefore went beyond Situation Semantics and DRT at the ^ same time. The sheet of assertion does not only represent a narrow con- £-h text, but, as we could say today, a wide context, meaning "anything that QJ the hearer is to take into account to determine (in the sense of ascertain- &lt;J ing) the speakers communicative intention" (Bach 1999: 72). For it is c/3 evident that pragmatic processes are involved in the mapping of the lin- Z guistic representations, the natural language sentences, to the richer rep- &lt;J resentations of the EG. How else could, e.g., the indexicals contained in Pi the sentences be solved? This renders the formal EG truly pragmatic. H 9. Conclusion Some of Peirce s treasures for pragmaticists are easy to find: According to Stephen Levinson, one of the important tasks linguistics has to undertake is to study indexicality cross-linguistically and empirically, for indexicality "is one of the most empirically understudied core areas of pragmatics" (Levinson 2004: 97). Peirce s attempts in indexicality research could easily be systematized and then applied to linguistics. His approach is valuable because it stresses the fact that indexicals are one of the basic means to make interacting people understand each other; he sketched classifications of linguistic indexicals and even con- ducted cross-linguistic analyses of them avant la lettre. But Peirce is also of immense value to linguistics in theoretical respect. It is mind boggling to see that his descriptions and analyses of linguistic phenomena can be interpreted as jigsaw puzzle pieces con- tributing to a theory of natural language and communication, which is radically pragmatic. He explains from a semiotic and phenomenologi- cal point of view how it is that not only indexicals but also symbols are always in need of interpretation in context; by discussing the problems of communication, Peirce helps linguists to perceive the traps and pit- falls of communication in a new light; and his ideas on triangulation and abduction help them to rethink the process of understanding. Another very important finding is that he strived to develop a formal representation for the interpretation of utterances, which takes into</page><page sequence="28">account the pragmatic processes he described elsewhere. It should inter- est linguists to see that Peirce did not draw the same conclusions as modern radical pragmaticists do today. For him, the business of for- malizing meaning was not in vain. Peirce searched for a possibility to depict the relations between the sentence, the speech act, the situation of use, and the logical interprétant, and invented his EG. The EG are interesting as historical evidence that there existed pre- cursors to formal approaches to pragmatics. And this is important, but it is not all. A scientist has to know something about the history of the ideas she is working with, and she has to learn from it. Following the guidelines drawn by Peirce, she might try to develop a version of DRT that takes into account a wide context. And she could even enrich her DRT by introducing an important concept of Peirce's theory of lan- guage and communication, namely abduction. For incorporating a generalized version of abduction would help to formalize disambigua- tion, and enrichment of sentences.19 Her project would then be much broader, and much more ambitious, than Kamp's ever was. It could be called 'Peircean,' for it would implement ideas that the extraordinary thinker though almost hundred years ago. And it would be a serious attempt to build a bridge over the cleavage, which hinders the dialogue among pragmaticists today.

NOTES * I would like to thank the two anonymous reviewers of the Transactions. Their substantial critique helped to improve the paper significantly. I would also like to thank the staff of the Peirce Edition Project, Indianapolis. They reviewed some of the quotations of the MSS, and have been of considerable and inestimable help since my first visit in 2003. 1. For a different evaluation cf. James Jakob Liszka (1996: 35). 2. Peirce s distinction between the immediate and the dynamic object pre- figures John Searles (1993) distinction between the intentional object and the representative content of an intentional state (cf. Kappner 2004: 130). 3. And there is still another reason. As a matter of fact, Peirce s late definition of meaning as habit fits perfectly his earlier attempt to implement contextual fea- tures into his graphical logic. For if meaning is a validated habit, then we can depict an assertion as having meaning only relative to a context of use of the asser- tion; the context includes then a specific knowledge of and specific experiences with the object of our assertion. 4. For a general critique of the 'code-model' of natural language from a rele- vance-theoretic point of view cf., e.g., Deirdre Wilson &amp; Dan Sperber (1993). 5. John Stuart Mills theory of meaning is clearly visible behind Peirce s con- ception of indexicality (cf., e.g., EP2: 473). 6. "The New Theory of Reference in the philosophy of language became widespread in the 1970s and is still flourishing today. The New Theory implies that many locutions (e.g. proper names) refer directly to items, which contrasts with the traditional or old theory of reference, which implies that names and rel- evantly similar locutions express descriptive senses or are disguised descriptions. The New Theory of Reference encompasses such notions as direct reference, rigid designation, identity across possible worlds, the necessity of identity, a posteriori necessities, singular propositions, essentialism about natural kinds, the argument from the failure of substitutivity in modal contexts that proper names are not equivalent to contingent definite descriptions, and related ideas and arguments" (Smith 1995: 179). 7. The set of genuine indices, which he also called reagents, are indices con- stituted by the objects they point to: smoke - fire, footprints - feet, symptoms - illnesses, etc. They convey information. Symptoms tell what kind of an illness someone is suffering from, and how severely; footprints might tell something about the height of someone, clouds of smoke something about the size of a fire and its location (cf. EP2: 171-72, 274). 8. Peirce claimed that only the Eskimo have an elaborate system of demon- stratives: "Only the Eskimo, who is too much wrapped up to gesticulate, and who talks half the year in the dusk, has demonstratives, not only for things near and things far, but also for things above and things below, things to the right and things to the left, things to the north, south, east, and west, things seaward and things Uh &lt;U I HP i O H U &lt; &lt; 344</page><page sequence="34">landward. Each of these has its locative, linguitive, dative, viative or prosecutive, and comitative case. This leads us to remark that though up and down may be described by virtue of the fall of bodies, right and left cannot be described, nor clockwise and counterclockwise, nor north, or any direction, nor a yard nor any measure [,] (except an angle) nor any weight. All these things can only be indicated' (MS 409: 19). 9. A detailed comparison of Peirce s and Kaplans theory of indexicals is yet to be undertaken. 10. For a definition or Kaplans pure indexicals cr. Kaplan (1977: 523r). 11. This is at least the opinion of Ralf Müller (1999) and Thomas Short (1996, 1998, 2004). For James Jacob Liszka (1990), the two classifications com- plement each other. The emotional, energetic, logical-division is more specific, elucidating what an immediate, a dynamic, and a final interprétant could be. Brendan Lalor (1997) develops this interpretation further. He thinks that Peirce gives anthropological examples of the immediate, dynamic, and final interprétants by introducing the emotional, energetic, and logical distinction. 12. Cf. Archimedes: "Aoii Mol ttoï) otto Kai kivg) tt|v yyv." 13. I am just using Stalnaker's (1978) words because they come in handy. But I do not claim that Peirce defined the common ground as consisting of a context set, defined as the set of worlds in which the propositions of the common ground are true. 14. Peirce would never, like Schütz and his followers, e.g. Norbert Schröer (1999: 205), assume that language as a cultural system helps to transcend diver- gences of perspectives. This is why I foster certain doubts about the adequacy of Pietarinens claim that the Davidsonian object should be replaced in Peirce by a sign: quotedblbaseTo make this picture richer, and to account for the multi- culturalised versions or extensions of it that have been argued to be consistent with the original scheme [...], one would be well advised to replace the notion of object and the associated notion of objectivity by the Peircean notion of the sign, with its more phenomenological undertones" (Pietarinen 2006: 428). If we did it, the whole process of triangulation would not work anymore correctly. For the object could have vanished behind the sign. Its indexical force could have disap- peared again. 15. Jaakko Hintikka was one of to first to point out that Peirce used strategic notions to explain meaning in language (cf. Hintikka 1997: 20). 16. I borrowed this expression from André de Tienne commenting on the title of my Ph.D. thesis. 17. For a complete definition cf. Kamp &amp; Reyle (1993: 157). 18. Jerry Hobbs and his followers have proved that the concept of abduction is useful and elegant to explain all sorts of pragmatic strengthening. With its help, we can explain the interpretation of ambiguous lexical items, or anaphora resolu- tion, or even implicatures (cf. Hobbs 1993, 2004). 8 &amp; r 5' CfQ So* FT *ö CfQ &lt;-* o" CO* r* Co # a z 5 r Œ c o o fo w r w 345</page></plain_text>
