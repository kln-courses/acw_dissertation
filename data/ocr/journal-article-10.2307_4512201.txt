<plain_text><page sequence="1">92] Recent Literature Winter 1976 follow their mates; therefore, it makes sense to chase the female. He used decoys to show that females never defend any territory. Single drakes and females were ultimately ignored by territorial drakes, and the defending male always threatened the female decoy of a pair. When drakes were experimentally re- moved from the territory, new drakes quickly moved in. This removal of pairs resulted in replacement by capable breeders. Alison suggests that a maximum number of suitable territories exists and that at greater densities some males are prevented from establishing territories by resident males; thus, territorial behavior seems to limit local breeding population size. This is an interesting conclusion, but further study is necessary to substantiate that a floater popula- tion of males and females capable of breeding is present. Displays are described adequately although diagrams might have been useful to this "non-duck" ornithologist. Frequencies and order for the courting dis- plays are given for a large number of courtship sequences. Paired males dis- played less frequently (data not given) than unpaired males. An excellent de- scription of courtship display intensity over time and a discussion of displays are given. Alison concludes with a section on the factors influencing production which summarizes and pulls together the monograph. I feel that this is a major con- tribution to avian behavior in general and to the duck literature in particular. I found it succinct, readable, and enjoyable. I heartily recommend it to orni- thologists.-Joanna Burger. 52. The Book of Owls. Lewis Wayne Walker. 1974. New York, A. A. Knopf. 256 p. $12.50. This book popularizes the biology of the following, species of owls: Barn, Screech, Great Horned, Snowy, Hawk, Elf, Burrowing Long- and Short-eared, and Saw-whet. Additional chapters are by other authors: Pygmy Owls by Bert Harwell, Spotted Owls by Grace M. Miller, and Great Gray Owls by Al Oeming round out the picture providing coverage on nearly all species of owls found in Canada and the United States. The final chapter entitled "A Potpourri of Facts" provides many little known facts on owls. Each chapter consists of sections on general discussion, measurements, voice, nesting, hours of activity, and food with an occasional section "of special interest". Especially good are the chapters on the Elf, Spotted, and Great Gray owls for they provide information on little known species for the laymen. Although there is some good information on the overall biology of all species treated I am disappointed in the lack of a modern ecosystem approach to the treatment of owls as predators. Instead, the old-fashioned, economic ornitholo- gist approach of categorizing owls as good or bad depending on the specific prey that they take is used. The modern concept of owls is totally lacking, namely that they are an integral part of natural communities, are valuable as biological indicators of environmental conditions, generally prey on what is most readily available, and should be handled on an individual basis when they cause depreda- tion. The statement that "there is a correlation between the [Elf] owl's progres- sive decline and the ever-widening use of insecticides in the valley below . . . alludes to it and provides a nice introduction to the principle of biological mag- nification but is not developed. The purpose of the book is not designated, so I will assume it is to educate lay people. If this is the case, it would have been appropriate to include a chapter on owl conservation. The author claimed he was a strong proponent of conservation, but I have to wonder. He describes building a blind in a heron rookery prior to the nesting season in order to photograph the herons later. Upon returning Walker found the herons disturbed, apparently by the presence of a pair of horned owls nesting within the rookery. He decided the owls must go, but he had difficulty in "dis- posing" of the two owlets from the nest by means "other than killing." He did not want to raise them and could not find any friends who would do so. Nearby zoos refused them because horned owls "had become a glut on the market." He finally places the two owlets in another nest with two owlets already present under the guise of conducting "research" on the "owl's ability to count" and to determine if this technique could be used to restock owls "in areas where they have become scarce." In placing the foster owlets, he drove the resident owlets out of the nest, moved the nest to another tree about 100 years away, and finally got the four owlets to stay in the nest long enough for him to leave the</page><page sequence="2">Vol. 47, No. 1 Recent Literature [93 area. Only later on, after struggling with his conscience, did he return to see if the foster owlets were accepted. More concern is thus expressed for photographing wildlife than for the well-being of the wildlife. Bert Harwell suggests, relative to the Pygmy Owl, that owls are supposed to conform to some anthropomorphic moral code in their struggle for life. "From a human viewpoint one of their methods of obtaining food is not strictly according to Hoyle, for on several occasions they have been seen to drag fledgling Downy Woodpeckers and Sapsuckers from their nesting cavities. Unfortunately it takes only one or two observations of nest robbing to create such descriptions as fiend, villain, rapacious, bloodthirsty, but actually this little owl usually follows accepted rules of hunting." There are some puzzling statements, e.g., " Courtship for most birds usually precedes the nesting season." The author apparently meant that the nesting season, and hence the courtship period, is restricted to a single season of the year. There are also erroneous statements. The picture caption for the Barn Owl on page 14 identifies a white-footed mouse in the beak of the owl as a meadow mouse. On pages 61 and 62 the author suggests that "polar bears, ptarmigan, fox and last but not least the Snowy Owl, are dedicated northerners completely disdaining a change from winter white." This is not true for the ptarmigan and arctic fox do undergo plumage and pelage changes to a more somber summer garb. On page 170, 13 skulls of Redpolls are reported coming "from the crop of a single Great Gray [Owl]". Although hawks possess a well defined crop it is lacking in owls. In page 231, the author uncertainly points out that the reversed sexual dimorphism found in most of the hawks and owls is found in all species, apparently unaware that Earhart and Johnson (Condor, 72: 251-264, 1970) had shown that the male Burrowing Owl is larger that the female. Lastly, on page 199 the author points out that the Short-eared Owl differs from most ground nesting birds in that it does not lay an excessive number of eggs, which leads to an expendable surplus of young. It is stated that since the average clutch size is " only five or six eggs" and they are presumably only single brooded "something about the bird or its manner of life sets it apart and makes it successful." That something is mobility and a flexible fecundity in response to food availability. Clutch sizes of up to 14 have been reported for this species. Mechanically the book is relatively free from errors. There are a few typo- graphical errors, and the page reference to an "accompanying photo series" of Burrowing Owls is made on page 247 (no page number cited) while the photos are on page 124, leaving the reader to search. Although there is much factual information presented in a readable way with many fine pictures I find a major shortcoming of this book is that it fails to put owls in their proper place ecologically speaking.-Richard J. Clark. 53. To Save a Bird in Peril. D. R. Zimmerman. 1975. New York, Coward, McCann &amp; Geoghegan. 286 p. $9.95.-The author presents a variety of current conservation programs for endangered birds. The book's concern is "clinical ornithology"-the crisis oriented intervention into the life cycle or environment of a threatened bird to enhance populations and prevent extinction. Interestingly, most of the therapeutic techniques are quite recent and very much experimental. The literary format of the book can be well described with brief comments on a few of the chapters, each of which considers one or more endangered species. In the pages on peregrines, Zimmerman reflects on "peregrine politics" and the conflicts of falconry with conservation. The report on the northeast Osprey program is presented as a personal success story for Paul Spitzer. Whooping Crane research at Patuxent reveals the struggles for results of scientists working in a "glass house" of publicity. In Hawaii, the Nene Goose causes discussion of the high costs of conservation programs-how much are we willing to spend on a decreasing species? The remaining chapters include the Cahow, Kirtland's Warbler, California Condor, Saddlebacks of New Zealand, and vultures and eagles of Europe. The author is a professional writer, whose literary style presents each con- servation effort in a dramatic tone. Often conservationists are portrayed as heros (with occasional villains). I know four main " actors" of the book and have heard some of their concern for this emphasis on personalities in the book. Zimmerman also criticizes professional ornithologists for their lack of interest</page></plain_text>
