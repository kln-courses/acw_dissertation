Liselot (5 year) ὅθεν καὶ τῶν κατὰ τὸν βίον οἱ μὲν ἕνα φασὶν εȢναι θεόν, οἱ δὲ πολλοɞς  καὶ διαφόρους ταῖς μορφαῖς (Hence ordinary people differ also, some  saying that there is one god, others that there are many gods and of  various shapes). Sext. Emp. Pyr. 3.219 1. Introduction Ancient Greek religion was, as we have seen in our first chapter,  unashamedly polytheistic. Hence the subject of the present chapter,  that of ‘oneness’ in Greek religion Archaic, Classical and Hellenis- tic, may come as a surprise. I will discuss three Greek modes of by- passing, negotiating, reconciling, in short of coping with the alarming  complexity of divine manifestations. The three relevant sections are  entitled: “One and many,” “Many is one,” and “One is the god.” The  first concerns the Archaic, the last the Hellenistic period, the second  discusses a phenomenon that can be found throughout Greek history.  All three are ‘experiments in oneness’, which, on the face of it, attempt  to redefine a diversity of phenomena as being basically a unity. I hope  to show, however, that none of these theologies aims at fusing the poly- theistic plurality itself into one unifying system or structure. Rather,  in each of them, though in singularly different ways, the  plurality and  * This title is both an indication of what this chapter is about and an allusion to  my book TER UNUS (1990), on which the third section of the present chapter leans  heavily and to which in this chapter I shall refer by its title in order to avoid an irritat- ing repetition of ‘Versnel 1990’. I wish to express my deep gratitude to Barbara Porter  for her scrutiny in trying to clear the text of an earlier version (published in Porter  2000, 79–163) from flaws and barbarisms in the English and even more for her acute  comments on lack of clarity in argument or composition as well as for her numerous  suggestions for improvement. </page> <page sequence="2"> 240 chapter three multiformity of polytheism remains unaffected: ‘the many gods’ do not  merge into ‘the one’ nor are they explained as emanations or aspects  of the one. Both, many and one, maintain a more or less independent  position in the conceptual world of the believers.1 As a matter of fact, my exposition sprouts from a critical reflection  on the dogmatic modern idea(l?) of ‘unity in diversity’, often advanced  with more conviction than supportive argument. The axiom, endorsed  by many a specialist, that the Greeks perceived an underlying unity  in the diversity of religious phenomena,2 in fact leaves us with more  questions than answers. What, precisely, do scholars mean by such an  assertion as for instance in the words of Walter Burkert “the whole  1 This may also serve as a clarification of the position I defend in TER UNUS,  which Price 1999, 11 n. 3 seriously misrepresents when he ranges me among those  scholars who “have sought to ‘rescue’ polytheism by arguing for an element of mono- latry or henotheism, in which the power of one god in the pantheon is proclaimed as  supreme.” If, as becomes apparent in recent scholarly discussion (e.g. Athanassiadi &amp;  Frede 1999; Mitchell &amp; Van Nuffelen 2010), I indeed have contributed to reanimating  the study of henotheistic tendencies in Greek religion, the very last objective of that  was thus to “rescue polytheism” (nor to attack it, for that matter). 2 Or, at the least, did not experience a divide between the two. Just a few instances  out of many: E. Meyer, Geschichte des Altertums III (1937) 706: “In Griechenland  vollends hat die Frage, ob ein Gott oder viele Götter, kaum eine Rolle gespielt; ob  die göttliche Macht als Einheit oder als Vielheit gedacht wird, ist irrelevant . . . .”; Th.  Zielinski, La religion de la Grèce antique (transl. Paris 1926) 125 f.: “dans le domaine  divin, l’unité et la multiplicité se confondent”; Rudhardt 1966, 355: “ce qui est essen- tiel au polythéisme, c’est que l’unité du divin et la pluralité des noms ou des figures  divines, la pluralité des dieux, ne sont pas senties par eux comme contradictoire.”  And so on and so forth. Gladigow 1990b, 249 f., already argued against such an “alle  Lebenszüge umfassenden Sinntotalität” as generally attributed to pre-modern soci- eties by sociologists of religion. In anthropology the quest for wholeness is under  critical discussion. See e.g. K.P. Ewing, The Illusion of Wholeness: Culture, Self, and  the Experience of Inconsistency, Ethos 18 (1990) 251–278. The author suggests that  the observer will always maintain the illusion of wholeness, despite the presence of  multiple inconsistent self-representations that are context-dependent and may shift  rapidly. Confronted with inconsistencies, they are “adept at using multiple rhetorical  strategies, relying on ambiguity and tropes to establish a position.” Even more essen- tially I.C. Jarvie, Rationality and Relativism: In Search of a Philosophy and History of  Anthropology (London 1984) 15, censures the anthropologists’s drive to find integrity  of society and culture: the apparently ‘irrational’ behaviour and conceptions of the  alien culture are made harmless by taking them as elements of a holistic system which  in itself is after all “ordinary in its own right.” Or cf. M. Strathern, Out of Context:  The Persuasive Fictions of Anthropology, Current Anthropology 28 (1987) 251–281,  espec. 260, who scorns the anthropologist’s main task as “how to manipulate familiar  ideas and concepts to convey alien ones.” All this implies that cultures are not the  coherent systems they have been assumed to be. Nor are their theologies.

Before we can answer these questions, our first task  should be to examine how the very concepts of unity and plurality  relate to each other in Greek perception.4 The three experiments in oneness that I shall discuss differ in their  points of departure (in terms of historical setting, intellectual climate  and social support), in their cosmological presuppositions and impli- cations, and in the nature of the discourse in which they are embed- ded. Only one of them, the first, explicitly proclaimed a (more or  less) overtly monotheistic theology. None of them solved and, as I  hope to show, no one endeavoured to solve the problems haunting   polytheism. Because the terms cannot be avoided in our discussion, it may be  expedient at this point to give my very provisional and personal work- ing definitions of monotheism and henotheism5 in their ‘ideal’ forms.  By monotheism I shall understand: the conviction that only one god exists (involving the cultic corollary  of exclusive worship), while other gods do not, or, if and as far as they  do, must be made inexistent, for instance by relegating them beyond  the political or cultic horizon of the community and attributing to them  the status of powerless, wicked or demonic forces without any (real)  significance. The paradoxical qualifier in this working definition, beginning with  “if and as far as they do . . . .,” dramatically exposes the author’s doubt  whether one can ever speak of pure monotheism6 except for a few  3 Burkert 1985, 216. 4 Judging by the wealth of studies listed in the following footnotes, I have the  impression that the ‘unity and diversity’ polarity—which is not necessarily identical  to ‘one and many’—is more fundamentally problematized in studies of Egyptian and  Near Eastern religions, in particular that of ancient Israel. See the recent collection of  fundamental studies in Porter 2000. 5 Of course one can find hosts of variant definitions and discussions in the relevant  entries of the well-known encyclopedias of religion. See e.g.: F. Baumgärtel, Mono- theismus und Polytheismus, RGG3 IV (1960) 1109–1115; R. Hülsewiesche, Mono- theismus, HWP VI (1984) 142–146; Chr. Schwöbel, Monotheismus, ThR 23 (1994)  233–262; C.

It is also the result of an attempt to accommodate the  7 Primarily in what Morton Smith, Palestinian Parties and Politics that Shaped the  Old Testament (repr. New York 1971) called “The Yahweh Alone Party” as practi- cally exclusively represented in (sections of) the book of Deuteronomy. Elsewhere  monotheism is not the correct term for Jewish theology. First, there is the uncom- fortable co-existence of God and the Hosts of Angels, as among others demon- strated by H. Corbin, Le paradoxe du monothéisme (Paris 1991 = 1981); P. Hayman,   Monotheism—A Misused Word in Jewish Studies? Journal of Jewish Studies 42 (1991)  1–15; K. Koch, Monotheismus und Angelologie, in: Dietrich &amp; Klopfenstein 1994,  565–581. Most probably, it was ancient Canaanitic gods who continued their existence  in the biblical angels, often in a rather caustic polemic with Yahweh. Cf. P. Schäfer,  Rivalität zwischen Engeln und Menschen (Berlin 1975). A. Segal, Two Powers in  Heaven (Leiden 1977) and D. Halperin, The Faces of the Chariot (Tübingen 1988)  argue for a ‘cooperative dualism’ between Yahweh and El at first, while later the place  of vice-regent was taken by other powers, such as Michael. Secondly, there is the  awkward female partner of Jahweh by name of Ashera, whose appearance in recently  found inscriptions seems to have inspired OT scholars with a new spurt of courage to  acknowledge what is (and was already long) obvious. See: J.M. Hadley, in: Dietrich &amp;  Klopfenstein 1994, 235–268; eadem, DDD s.v. Asherah; eadem, The Cult of Asherah in  Ancient Israel and Judah: Evidence for a Hebrew Goddess (Cambridge 2000).

In  1 Cor. 8:4–6, he says that “we know that (. . .) there is no God but one,” which obvi- ously implies a monotheistic conception. However, this phrase is immediately fol- lowed by: “For although there may be so-called gods in heaven or on earth—as indeed  there are many gods and many lords—yet for us there is one God . . .” (See also below  n. 144).

Of course, many differentiations such as ‘exclusive’, ‘inclusive’, ‘pluri- form’ or ‘temporary’ monotheism have been proposed.11 In using the term monotheism (as well as its opposite polytheism)12  in terms of an ‘etic’ definitional and distinctive concept one should  continuously be aware that the notion actually originated as an ‘emic’  construct in Christian theology. After its birth in antiquity (Philo),  the term is, in modern times, first attested in the work of Henry More  (1660).13 From the 18th century onwards it acquired its dogmatic and  exclusivist status as marker of the identity of Old and New Testament  religious thought, especially under the influence of Schleiermacher.14 In accordance with the evidence that I shall present in the third part  of this chapter, henotheism15 may be defined as:  9 For an excellent and critical account of the history of monolatry (and henothe- ism) as technical terms see: R. Mackintosh, Monolatry and henotheism, ERE VIII  (1915) 810 ff. Cf. more recently: Rose 1975, 9–13, Exkurs: Henotheismus, Monolatrie,  Monotheismus. 10 Although in scholarly discussion henotheism and monolatry are often connected  (e.g. Chr. Auffarth, Henotheism/Monolatrie, in: HrwG III [1993] 104 f.), in my defini- tion monolatry is not “Praktizierung des henotheismus:” W. Holsten, Monolatrie, in:  RGG3 IV (1960) 1106. Here I rather follow F. Heiler, Erscheinungsformen und Wesen  der Religion (Stuttgart 1961), 323; Rose 1975, 10, and others. 11 See e.g. on various forms of ‘inclusive monotheism’ and ‘pluriform monothe- ism’ as he coined it: Th.P. van Baaren, Pluriform Monotheism, Nederlands Theologisch  Tijdschrift 20 (1965–66) 321–327. Recent works (as above n. 1) tend to use the notion  ‘monotheism’ for both pagan and Christian trends in late antiquity. See the sensible  discussion in Fürst 2006. 12 For which see above Chapter I p. 24. 13 Hülsewiesche o.c. (above n. 5) 142 f.; Stolz o.c. (above n. 7) 22 ff. 14 “Erst Friedrich Schleiermacher mit seiner Einleitung zur zweite Auflage der  Glaubenslehre von 1830/1831 hat den Begriff und die Sache des “monotheismus” zu  einem identitätsbildenden Merkmal von Judentum, Christentum und Islam gemacht,”  thus Markschies 2002, 215. Fundamentally on this development: Gladigow 2002, with  further literature, and G. Ahn, Monotheismus und Polytheismus als religionsgeschich- tliche Kategorien? in: Oeming &amp; Schmid 2003, 1–10, who opens his paper with a sec- tion: “Die Verschränkung emischer und etischer Perspektiven in der europäischen  Religions- und Wissenschaftsgeschichte.” 15 The term ‘henotheismus’, first introduced by F.J.W. Schelling in the sense of  “relatively rudimentary monotheism,” was canonized (and used interchangeably with  ‘kathenotheismus’) by Max Müller in order to indicate, in a polytheistic context, the  momentaneous and selective adoration of one god, who, for that specific moment of  devotion, is exclusively honoured with all available predicates. See: M. Yusa, Henothe- ism, ER VI (1987) 266–7. For the application of the term in the study of Egyptian  </page> <page sequence="6"> 244 chapter three the privileged devotion to one god, who is regarded as uniquely supe- rior, while other gods are neither depreciated nor rejected and continue  receiving due cultic observance whenever this is ritually required.16 While monotheism by its definition is supposed to be a permanent  and non-intermittent awareness, only coming to an end when the  believer loses his monotheistic conviction, henotheism may be either  permanent, for instance in a cult group round one god, or restricted  to a specific moment in personal adoration.17 For instance, a hymn to  one god may be regarded as a henotheistic moment in a polytheistic  context.18 These definitions imply that boundaries are fluid. It is even  to be feared that they will not suffice to cover the whole spectrum of  ‘oneness’. The introduction of the paradoxical notion ‘non-exclusive  monotheism’ may help us out of the deadlock. 2. One and Many: The God(s) of Xenophanes ƈἷς θεὸς ἔν τε θεοῖσι καὶ ἀνθρώποισι μέγιστος, οȼ τι δέμας θνητοῖσιν ὁμοίιος οὐδὲ νόημα (One god [Heis theos] among gods and men (the) greatest, neither in form nor in thought resembling mortal beings). This is the astounding proclamation issued round the middle of the  sixth century BC by the Ionian philosopher Xenophanes of Kolo- phon (B 23),19 who has been lauded as “a paradigm of the pre-socratic   religion: Hornung 1971, 233. For its occurrence in Graeco-Roman religion: TER  UNUS and below section 4. Recently, Eich 2010, espec. in the section “Polytheismus,  Monotheismus, Henotheismus” (pp. 101–110) gives a clear summary of the problems  of definition, largely accepting my own earlier suggestions.  16 “The expression of a relationship with a privileged divinity. Instead of being  structured solely according to a contractual votive ritualism, this expression enhanced  the theological quality and ontology of the power invoked, frequently as a result of a  direct personal experience,” as Belayche 2010, 146 has it.  17 The latter is basically Max Müller’s interpretation of the concept, which is also  referred to as ‘affective monotheism’. A. van Selms, in: M.A. Beek et alii (edd.), Sym- bolae Biblicae et Mesopotamicae M.Th de Liagre Böhl dedicatae (Leiden 1973) 341– 348, introduced the term ‘temporary henotheism’ in an article under the same title.  He refers to situations in Mesopotamia and Israel (e.g. Epic of Atrahasis, I, 376–383,  Dan. 6:8) in which it is stipulated that for a certain period of time only one god will  receive adoration.  18 After all, Müller’s conceptualization of the notion henotheism was grounded in  the unique attention of the hymn to one god. Cf. Stolz o.c. (above n. 7) 44 f. 19 The basic edition and standard for the numeration of his fragments as well as  of those of all other Presocratic philosophers is: H. Diels &amp; W.

See Simo Parpola’s work,  summarized by himself in his paper ‘Monotheism in Ancient Assyria’, in: Porter  2000, 165–209 (cf. espec. his ‘The Assyrian Tree of Life: Tracing the Origins of Jewish  Monotheism and Greek Philosophy, JNE 52 (1993) 161–208) but see the criticism by  Porter, ibid. 211–271.

On the other hand, sub specie aeternitatis  and accordingly neglecting the historical perspective, Feyerabend 1986 denies both the  revolutionary innovation and the value of Xenophanes’ initiatives. See below: p. 265.  23 Cf. B 11: “It was Homer and Hesiod who attributed to the gods all sorts of things  which are matters of reproach and censure among men: theft, adultery, and mutual  deceit;” B 14: “But mortals suppose that gods are born, and have clothes and speech  and bodies like their own;” B 15: “If horses or oxen or lions had hands and could make  drawings with their hands and accomplish such works as men, horses would draw the  figures of gods as similar to horses, and oxen as similar to oxen, and they would lend  them a physical appearance like their own;” B 16: “Ethiopians say that their gods are  snub-nosed and black; Thracians that theirs are blue-eyed and red-haired.” </page> <page sequence="8"> 246 chapter three and predominantly characterized as (being or having) a Great Mind  (Nous), swaying the universe through thought alone.24 To serve the reader and as a basis for further reference I here give  the much quoted list of “seven dogmas whose ascription to Xeno- phanes is secured by actual fragments from his poems” as formulated  by Barnes 1982, 85: 1) God is motionless. 2) God is ungenerated. 3) ‘There is one god, greatest among gods and men.’ 4) God is not anthropomorphic. 5) God thinks and perceives ‘as a whole.’ 6) God moves things by the power of his mind. 7) God is morally perfect. In some aspects of his theory the influence of his Ionian predeces- sors is unmistakable, but the two major components of his theologi- cal system—the rejection of anthropomorphism and the embracing  of one abstract divinity—are drawn with unique rigour and explicit- ness. Consequently, surveying this momentous theological initiative  the reader cannot but be shocked when confronted with the wording  of the most influential Xenophanean postulate, already quoted in the  beginning of this section but very much worth repeating and analyzing  in more detail (B 23):25 24 Cf. B 23, quoted in the beginning of this section; B 26 and 25: “Always he remains  in the same place, moving not at all; nor is it fitting for him to go to different places at  different times; but without toil he moves all things by the thought of his mind;” B 24  “As whole he sees, as whole he comprehends, as whole he hears.” 25 Recent decades witnessed the rise of a debate on the authenticity of these lines.  For general discussion of the reliability of what later authors have handed down as the  ipsissima verba of Xenophanes: C. Osborne, Rethinking Early Greek Philosophy: Hip- polytus of Rome and the Presocratics (Ithaca 1987), on which see the critical reviews  by J. Barnes, Phronesis 33 (1988) 327–344, and A. Mourelatos, Ancient Philosophy 9  (1989) 111–117. More specifically, M.J. Edwards, Xenophanes Christianus?, GRBS 32  (1991) 219–228, argues that the majority of the verses quoted in the present paper  are fabrications made by the Christian Clemens. The notion of heis theos in B 23  in particular seems suspicious to him, since it does not occur in any other Greek  philosopher prior to Plato, while it is the cornerstone of many Christian and Jewish  fabrications of late antiquity (on which see below). I cannot go into this discussion  here. Practically no other scholar shares this viewpoint and, anyway, it remains that  “to judge by his other doxographers, Xenophanes was not so partial to heis as to hen,”  which suffices for my argument.  </page> <page sequence="9">  one god: three greek experiments in oneness 247 One god among gods and men (the) greatest,26 neither in form nor in thought resembling mortal beings. These lines conceal, as I announced above, an inconsistency. How are  we to explain that the first intransigent monist27 of Greek philosophy  admits through the back door what he has just previously ousted tri- umphantly through the front door? How to explain the contradiction,  already looming in the presentation by Anaximenes, between the pos- tulate of one all-embracing divine arche and the acceptance of a poly- theistic world view, as apparent from the reference to ‘(the) gods’? Nor  is this the only place where Xenophanes refers to the plural ‘gods’.28  But perhaps we should take a step back and first ask some prelimi- nary questions. For instance, is our fragment proof of a monotheistic  experiment, as is assumed by those scholars who praise Xenophanes  as “the only genuine monotheist that ever existed.”29 In the words of  Burnet 1930, 143: We cannot admit that Xenophanes conceded to the existence of subor- dinate or special gods; because it is exactly the existence of these gods  that he had particularly in mind to deny.30 26 Of course, classicists quarrel about the correct interpretation of this ‘one’ as  cheerfully as do Old Testament scholars about “Israel, your God is one.” Do the two  lines contain three predicates (one, greatest, not resembling) or only two, with ‘one’  functioning as attribute? And so on and so forth. See the discussions in Stokes 1971,  76–79; Lesher 1992, 96–100; Schäfer 1996, 165 ff. There have been many attempts  to ‘dismonotheize’ the expression heis theos by pointing out that a common Greek  idiom uses heis to reinforce the superlative (which is true: see the third section of this  chapter) and next arguing that, consequently, what is intended is: “the one greatest  god” thus ruling out: “God is one, the greatest. . .” (which is less than compelling). To  demonstrate the faultiness of this argument would require more space than I have  available. I confine myself to the observations, first, that the complete doxography,  including Aristotle and Theophrastus, understands these lines and the rest of Xeno- phanes’ theology as unequivocally implying “God is one” and, second, that the all- embracing predicates in the several fragments quoted cannot but refer to a divine  being that is not only infinitely greater than, but also and more important, funda- mentally different from (supposed) other divine beings. I myself have tried to avoid a  premature, all too explicit interpretation by not inserting the verbal form “is”, which  does not occur in the Greek text. 27 Aristotle Met. A 5.986b21 calls Xenophanes the first “monist” (πρῶτος ἑνίσας),  because “he said that the One was the god” (τὸ ἓν [neuter!] εȢναι τὸν θεόν) after having  looked up at the whole universe.” 28 They are found in Fragments B 1.24; 11.1; 12.1; 14.1; 15.3; 16.1; 18.1; 34.2. 29 U. von Wilamowitz, Die griechische Literatur und Sprache (Berlin 1905) 38. 30 We will encounter various different arguments put forward to defend X.’s mono- theistic conviction, even if the existence of other gods cannot be denied. Most of them  require a generous dash of generosity on the side of the reader when confronted with a  </page> <page sequence="10"> 248 chapter three Or should we, on the contrary, follow many scholars in calling into  question: whether a convinced monotheist in an unreceptive polytheistic soci- ety would cloud the issue by a mention of plural gods which is at least  ambiguous, in the very context where he is firmly stating his revolution- ary view.31 Since this question—more especially the notion ‘pure monotheism’— is essential to my central argument, we will have to cast a quick glance  into the scholarly discussion.32 It will reveal how desperately—and  diversely—scholars have struggled to elicit a coherent meaning from  these two lines, squirming in their attempts to defend the text against  the most fatal charge imaginable in Academia: lack of consistency. 1. One or many? By way of introduction I select three different assessments taken from  three of the best-known textbooks.33 Burkert, in a characteristically  clear and well considered summary, writes: What sounds like monotheism is nevertheless drawing on entirely cus- tomary formulae: one is the greatest and for that very reason is not  alone. very modern logical argumentation applied to reconcile the ambivalence. Barnes 1982,  91 f., for instance, excels in an Oxford type of algebraic logic in order to arrive at his  conclusion: “Xenophanes, I conclude was a monotheist, as the long tradition has it;  (. . . .) like later Christian theologians, he argued on purely logical grounds that there  could not be a plurality of gods.” A different, very popular and less vulnerable, method  is to downplay the importance of the ‘normal’ gods. One for all: Mansfeld 1987, 210,  “die anderen Götter sind aber, verglichen mit dem grössten, kaum bedeutend.” In a  different vein Heitsch 1994, 15, “Der Fehler, den Xenophanes zu sehen meint, liegt  daher nicht darin, dass die einen oder anderen Völker falsche Vorstellungen von den  Göttern haben, sondern darin dass sie sich überhaupt Bilder machen.” 31 Stokes 1971, 76, inferring that the fragment cannot be reconciled with a pure  monotheism. Some go much farther in their doubt. Babut 1974 even contests the  common opinion that Xenophanes’ theological views constitute a radical departure  from the religious mythologies of Homer and Hesiod. Cf. idem, La religion des phi- losophes grecs (Paris 1974) 22–27. In the same year and in a similar vein: Eisenstadt  1974. So, here, the conclusion may be—quite contrary to, but no less firm than the  one of Barnes cited in the preceding note—: “Gegen den Tenor traditioneller Unter- suchungen muß daher eindeutig festgestellt werden, daß Xenophanes kein Monotheist  ist” (Schäfer 1996, 167). 32 For a summarizing discussion, apart from the ones mentioned above nn. 30 and  31, see: A. Lefka, The Xenophanean Religious Thought: A Field of Various Interpreta- tions, Kernos 2 (1989) 89–96.

This is simply an emphatic device,34 and  for the same reason the plural of ‘gods’ need not be intended literally. Even so, they continue: “In fact Xenophanes wrote of ‘gods’ in other  places also; partly, no doubt, this was a concession, perhaps not a fully  conscious one, to popular religious terminology.” Jaeger, finally, states: But while he extols this God as more than human, he also describes him  explicitly as ‘the greatest among gods and men.’ This manner of speak- ing, with its polar juxtaposition of gods and men, follows the old epic  formulas; nevertheless it still makes it perfectly clear that besides the  One God there must be others, just as there are men. However, according to Jaeger, these other gods could not be the anthro- pomorphic Homeric ones and it was not Xenophanes’ intention to  compromise with popular religion.35 Rather we should think of Thales’  dictum “that all things are full of gods.” Conclusion: “In any case the  one all-embracing God is so far superior to all the other lesser divine  forces that he alone could really seem important to Xenophanes.” In  our terminology, Jaeger seems to opt for a henotheistic solution. How very revealing are these desperate attempts to come to terms  with an undeniable and irritating clash of One and Many in two coher- ent lines of a professed ‘monist’!36 After the well-nigh  arithmetical  34 Indeed, Greek poetry abounds in polar expressions meant to denote a totality,  not seldom producing curiously absurd results. KRS mention for instance Heraclitus  Fr. 30 who says that the world-order was made by “none of gods or men.” Add for  instance Creon in Sophocles’ Antigone, who says: “Go, go now, servants, those present  and those absent.” G. Müller, Sophokles Antigone [Heidelberg 1967] ad loc. explains  the “Unlogik” by Creon’s desperate haste. However, there are numerous parallels for  these illogical polarities. See Eur. HF 1106 with von Wilamowitz’ note; Eur. Hipp. with  Barrett’s note; Soph. El. 305; Plaut. Trin. 360.  35 Jaeger 1947, 44. Here he is followed by Nilsson GGR I3 742: “nicht die Götter der  Volksreligion.” This is a ‘dagger to the hand’ of those scholars who wish to coat the  pill of a persistent polytheism in an otherwise monotheistic theology. If the other gods  do continue their existence Xenophanes must have viewed them as: “in neuer, von  Unordentlichem und Menschlich-Gestalthaftem gereinigter Form als Figuren eines zu  reformierenden Kultus” (Mansfeld 1987, 211), or as “von Anthropomorphismen und  ethischen Defekten gereinigten personalen göttlichen Mächten” (Schäfer 1996, 165).  36 The uneasiness concerning the contradiction is ubiquitous. Two examples: Guth- rie 1962, 375, regretfully qualifies it as “at the least a surprising carelessness.” Schäfer  </page> <page sequence="12"> 250 chapter three inference that the superlative qualification ‘the greatest’ necessarily  presupposes the existence of other (lesser) gods, we see two diamet- rically opposed strategies to negotiate the blatant contradiction that  thus emerges: a centrifugal versus a centripetal one. The first37 tries to  resolve the inconsistency by explaining it away: the mention of gods is  nothing more than a rhetorical concession, not referring to anything  ‘really real’. At most it is a tactical concession to popular religious  tradition, which, by implication, in his heart Xenophanes must have  vehemently opposed.38 The other approach offers an explanation in  terms of what the Germans call Hineininterpretation, whence referred  to as centripetal by me. It helpfully trots out a homemade theological  system in order to make it all logically acceptable: there are indeed  more gods but they cannot have been the traditional Olympians. The  one great deity and the other lesser gods form a kind of hierarchy,39  in which the normal traditional—or the not so normal revised type  of gods—are described as emanations, representatives or parts of the  central ‘one’.40 1996, 164: “Leider spricht Xenophanes (23) tatsächlich in einer sehr ambivalenten  Weise von “Gott” und “Götter” in einem Atemzug” (my italics). 37 Last refuge to many a scholar including such celebrities as Zeller, Burnet, Diels- Kranz, followed by François 1957, 167, where one can find the earlier literature. 38 Mansfeld 1987, 211: “Zu vergleichen ist, dass auch spätere griechische Phi- losophen die Existenz der Götter des Kultes im allgemeinen nicht geleugnet haben,  ungeachtet ihrer philosophischen Überzeugung, in der für solche Götter kaum oder  überhaupt kein Platz war. Überdies vermied eine solche Gesinnung, auch bei Xeno- phanes, den Konflikt mit den von Staat wegen und privat geübten Kultgebräuchen.”  39 Cf. Mansfeld 1987, 210: The one god is their absolute sovereign. “Nur: dessen  absolute Souveränität hebt die minderen Gottheiten weder in ihrer Existenz auf, noch  beschneidet sie deren Verehrenswürdigkeit.” 40 For a survey of earlier adherents to this and similar ideas including: Gomperz,  Decharme, Diès, Jaeger, Untersteiner, see François 1957, 166. More recently: Pötscher  1962, l.c. (below n. 56): “Der eine Gott ist in ihnen allen präsent”; B. Wisniewski, La  conception de dieu chez Xenophane, RCCM 35 (1993) 211–218: “dieux (theoi) ne  signifient pas une pluralité des dieux, mais les parties d’un seul et même dieu”; Chr.  Eucken, Die Gotteserfassung im Symposion des Xenophanes, Gymnasium 19 (1993)  5–17, espec. 16: “Die vielen Götter (. . .) scheinen als Vermittler der für sich allein nicht  absolut bestimmbaren höheren Vorstellung des einen Gottes zu dienen”; A. Drozdek,  Xenophanes’ Theology, SIFC Quarta serie, 2 (2004) 141–157, espec. 151: “the gods are  only manifestations of the true, only God.” Another solution, namely that “the gods”  of Xenophanes must be “the elements and sun, moon and stars” (C. Kahn, Anaxi- mander and the Origins of Greek Cosmology [New York 1960] 165 n. 3 and others)  is incompatible with other elements in Xenophanes’ theory, as Finkelberg 1990 146,  correctly argues. This does not, however, necessarily entail the non-existence of the  gods in Xenophanes’ thought, as Finkelberg thinks.  </page> <page sequence="13">  one god: three greek experiments in oneness 251 This is not to say that such ‘unity in diversity’41 has never been pro- posed in antiquity. It was, most notably in Stoic42 and later Neopla- tonic systems.43 Stoic theology indeed tended towards monotheism,  with Zeus as the central God, but did not exclude the existence of  other gods in addition to Zeus.44 Zeus, however, is the only eternal  god; the others originate and end with the cycle of the kosmos, when  everything is consumed by fire and then regenerated. Accordingly, the  Roman polymath Varro45 claimed that all the gods were parts (partes)  41 The idea that ‘one principle (or one god) is all’ did not immediately find much  adherence and in the earlier period—as far as we can see—remained confined to  Orphic and Eleatic circles. I cannot go into Xenophanes’ possible relationship with the  Eleatics. For this see: G. Cerri, Senofane ed Elea (una questione di metodo) QUCC 64  f. (2000) 31–50; J.

Mund. 397b10–401b24, Pol. 1326a32, where god is the ‘divine power’  (theia dunamis) that ‘holds everything together’ as the informing principle of the kos- mos, or Fr. 49, where he identifies god with mind, while “the rest is addition in the  form of myth, in order to persuade the multitude and to be useful for laws and (pri- vate) interest.” 43 In later antiquity it was summarized by Servius ad Verg. Georg. I.5: “The Stoics  say that there is only one god, one and the same power, which is called by different  names in accordance with different functions.” 44 A.A. Long, Epictetus. A Stoic and Socratic Guide to Life (Oxford 2002) 144:  “Because the Stoic divinity is everywhere, Stoic philosophers could accommodate gods  in the plural. (. . . .) Strictly, though, these gods are only symbolical ways of referring to  the world’s most powerful constituents all of which owe their existence to the single  ‘active’ named God in the singular or Zeus.” Cf.

The latter one, being  </page> <page sequence="14"> 252 chapter three or qualities (virtutes) of one central superior divine being, which he,  too, identifies with Jupiter.46 However, observing analogies between  Xenophanean and Stoic theology is one thing, imposing the full sys- tem of the latter onto the former is another. The two are separated by  centuries of increasingly sophisticated philosophical reflection. What  is more, while we do have explicit knowledge of Stoic theory, there  is no scrap of information on a supposed deeper coherence of the  different types of gods in the few fragments of Xenophanes. On the  contrary, the expression “greatest among gods and men” does little to  encourage the reader to single out one of these two categories (the  ‘gods’) for a special relationship to the One. If so far we briefly discussed arguments advanced to vindicate  monotheism for Xenophanean theology, it is both alarming and sig- nificant that exactly the same arguments have been put forward for  rescuing Xenophanes for the sake of polytheism. Already in the late  19th century, Freudenthal47 claimed that he could find nothing what- soever that is indicative of monotheistic tendencies in Xenophanes.  According to him Xenophanes professed a genuine polytheism, albeit  one in which one central god—whom Freudenthal tended to identify  as Zeus—reigns as a despot over his subject gods. As parts of the great  God they reign over their own smaller sections of the world.48 the religion of cult and ritual, should have aspects of both others in order to suit the  taste and intellectual level of the vulgus.

Of course, he met with fierce resistance  by renowned contemporaries such as Zeller and Diels, who in their textbooks had  proclaimed a ‘pure monotheism’, and felt little inclination to surrender. All the same,  he found many followers as well. See: François 1957, 165 n. 1. 48 For that matter, the idea of an omnipotent Being, transcending all the other  powers in the world, even the gods themselves, was one which the epic writers had  already associated with their highest god. Hom. Il 8.18–27 presents a striking instance  of the absolute superiority of Zeus, which Aristotle De motu an. 4.700a even cites as  the first intimation of the power of his ‘unmoved mover’. See: Jaeger 1947, 46. For  Homeric Epic as the cradle of monotheistic thought see already: H.

West, in: Athanassiadi &amp; Frede  </page> <page sequence="15">  one god: three greek experiments in oneness 253 What we see, then, is that both ‘monotheist’ and ‘polytheist’ partisans  may acknowledge the co-existence of ‘lesser gods’ and ‘the One God,’  and, what is more, that they may describe the relationship of the two  divine categories in similar terms. Monotheism and polytheism are  just words, our words, for concepts each of which apparently can be  applied to one and the same paradoxical ambiguity. Moreover, in both  theories we encountered the same assumption that the One God and  the many lesser gods together must have formed part and parcel of  one coherent theology, viewed either as a hierarchy or as a unity in  diversity. Now, to associate the two categories of gods in such a way  is to devise a theological system, in this case our system, not seldom  grounded in—or at least very comparable to—constructions known  from ancient doxographic tradition which embraced the very same  line of projection. There are strong reasons, however, for questioning  the legitimacy of such a, generally unreflected, hermeneutic approach  if there is no trace of reflection on the relationship of the two types  of gods in the remaining fragments. To explain this silence one has a  choice of two options. One is that the author has enunciated his ideas  on the real nature of the ‘other gods’ (including their relation with the  One) but the relevant parts of his work are lost. The other is that the  author has not expressed an opinion, for instance because he never felt  the inclination to pay explicit attention to the issue. It is amazing—and  characteristic of our modern drive towards consistency—that the lat- ter option, if considered at all, has never managed to secure an equal  standing in the scholarly debate. The, often implicit, modish convic- tion is exemplarily expressed by Finkelberg 1990, 136: 1999, 21–40, espec. 22 ff., regards the motif of the assembly of the gods as the first step  towards monotheism because it implies that “only one god counts.” Various scholars  of either school, the monotheist and the polytheist, regard Xenophanes as indebted  to the Homeric notion of “the greatest god.” Among many others: Heitsch 1994, 17;  S. Broadie, in: Long 1999, 210 ff. Indeed, throughout Greek history, Zeus is not only  superior to the other gods in degree, but he is also distinct in kind. Zeus, more than  primus inter pares, stands above the rest of the pantheon. His supremacy at times  approaches divine singularity, as, after many others, recently K. Dowden, Zeus (Lon- don-New York 2006) once more points out. For the Aeschylean Zeus as all-powerful  and all-encompassing god see i.a. G. Calogero, Xenophanes, Aeschylos und die erste  Definition der Allmacht Gottes, in idem, Studien über Eleatismus (Darmstadt 1970)  283–301; Jajcev 1996. </page> <page sequence="16"> 254 chapter three At any rate, to saddle a thinker with inconsistencies and contradictions  is not the best exegetical method, and before resorting to it, it is always  advisable to investigate other possibilities.49 It will be hard to find a reader who would disagree with such a—both  paradigmatic and axiomatic—truism. ‘Of course’ the modern inter- preter should go as far as possible in trying to detect consistency in an  author’s thought. The alternative is to quit the field of literary criticism  and the history of philosophy. But, as said earlier, one should not go  farther than possible. What to do if every new alternative interpretation  of an ‘apparent’ inconsistency appears to generate new logically implau- sibilities? In that case one might at least consider the option exemplar- ily expressed by Wilamowitz, Platon (Berlin 1919) II 238 n. 1: We should not regard the rhapsode as a consistent systematic thinker.  Hence we should distrust the system that the [doxographic] treatises  hand down to us, and which our historians of philosophy develop even  further.50 This other extreme on the scale of exegetical principles might make  us reconsider the word ‘thinker’ in Finkelberg’s phrase just quoted.  Does an author only deserve this predicate if he thinks in exactly the  way modern thinkers think? What all suggestions discussed so far have  in common—and share with the modern strategies discussed in our  second chapter—is the imposition of a typical modern drive towards  49 This is in the context of the interpretation of B 34, as quoted below p. 256, where  Finkelberg refuses to believe that Xenophanes can have “declared that though human  beings can never attain certain knowledge about distant things and that his accounts  of heavenly and underground things were mere opinions, concerning the divine he  possessed precise knowledge and therefore his account on God was the most certain  truth.” An implausibility that he introduces with the rhetorical question “Must we,  then, allow that Xenophanes did not trouble to be consistent?” The difference between  our positions is that what he here poses as an (ironic) rhetorical question is exactly a  question that to my mind is both legitimate and in need of serious consideration.  50 “Wir werden in dem Rhapsoden nicht einen konsequenten Systematiker sehen  dürfen, also dem System, das die [sc. doxographischen] Referate uns überliefern, und  unsere Historiker der Philosophie noch weiter ausbauen, mißtrauen.” Even though  the great Hellenist may have gone a bit far in his outspoken preference for the poet  over the systematic philosopher, his observation that it was the doxographic tradi- tion, especially Theophrastos and Ps. Aristoteles, De Melisso, Xenophane, Gorgia that  constructed a system from the works of Xenophanes on the basis of Eleatic and Peri- patetic models is indisputable. Whatever we accept as system in Xenophanes rests  largely on later reconstruction: J. Wiesner, Ps. Aristoteles MXG: Der historische Wert  des Xenophanes-Referates (Amsterdam 1974); Finkelberg 1990. Note that Aristotle  Met. 986b27 calls him “somewhat uncouth” (agroikoteros), referring to the lack of  well constructed arguments in his work.  </page> <page sequence="17">  one god: three greek experiments in oneness 255 consistency upon an archaic mentality that need not (always) have had  a similar penchant for (our) logic. This does not mean that all these sug- gestions are mistaken. It is, to mention only one, true that traditional  expressions may persevere in an otherwise revolutionary new context.  A popular proverbial expression still in fashion a century ago in mod- ern (allegedly monotheistic) Greece bears a curious resemblance to the  Xenophanean paradox: “May God fit thee to find favour with gods and  men” (νὰ σ’ ἀξιώσʤ ὁ θεὸς νὰ εὐχαριστήσʤς θεοɞς καὶ ἀνθρώπους).51 Whichever position one may tend to favour, the polytheistic or the  monotheistic, the first thing to do is to determine what we may agree  that we know of Xenophanes’ ideas with a reasonable degree of cer- tainty. This means that for the moment we restrict ourselves to what  may be taken as authentic remnants of his own writings. Of course,  this is another bone of contention between the specialists, but the  seven dogmas as formulated by Barnes (above p. 246) may come close  to a common denominator. If we accept them, and I have nothing  against it, we should realize that the qualities ascribed to ‘God’ under  nos. 1, 3, 5 and 6 are directly derived from the fragments, while those  under nos. 2, 4, and 7 are inferences drawn from the disqualifications  of the traditional gods of (Homeric) mythology. They are expressions  of a theologia negativa. In a discussion in which the one (new) God is  opposed to the many (old) gods, this e contrario ascription of positive  qualifications to the one god seems legitimate. What, however, can on  no account be justified is to adopt Barnes’ list, but adapt it in such a  way that the singular ‘God’ in nos. 2, 4 and 7 is now ‘pluralized’ with  the result that ‘Gods are ungenerated,’ ‘Gods are not anthropomorphic’  and ‘Gods are morally perfect.’52 Such an extrapolation is inadmissible.  The poet singled out disreputable qualifications for the traditional gods  of myth and bestowed the most magnificent qualities onto his One  God. But he did not say that the traditional gods should be ‘reformed’  in accordance with the image of the new one. In what remains of  his work he leaves us up in the air with respect to the  section of his  theology—if it ever existed, which I seriously doubt—that concerned  51 J.C. Lawson, Modern Greek Folklore and Ancient Greek Religion (Cambridge  1910) 48, who aptly comments that it “combines impartially the one God and the  many.” Laura Gibbs tells me that instead of the expression “God and saints preserve  us” she often hears people saying “gods and saints preserve us.” 52 So for instance Schäfer 1996, 203.

The author may have regarded them as “gereinigte  Götter,” as many scholars prefer, but, clearly, that is not the central  issue of his interest. His theology is focused on the One; the arguments  derived from the frailties of the mythical gods are put in the service  of that goal and of that goal only. The question “and what about the  other gods?” is ours, being a corollary of our bent toward consistent  systematization. And we shrink from considering the possibility that  at this point Xenophanes just discontinued his strictly logical train of  thought by not explicating this part of his theology. But is it possible to accept that Xenophanes tolerated a form of  coexistence of the One and the many, without seriously attempting  to accommodate the inherent inconsistency? I will try to answer this  question in the next section of our enquiry. For the moment it must  suffice that in a veiled manner the poet himself may have hinted at the  implied paradoxes of his ‘system,’ namely in fragment (B 34): No man knows, or ever will know, the truth about the gods and about  everything I speak of: for even if one chanced to say the complete truth,  yet oneself does not know it; but opinion is allotted to all (men).53 How very intricate the “truth about the gods” is appears from a few  lines from his famous Banquet elegy, where (ll.13 ff.) he gives the  seemingly monotheistic advice: The first thing men of sense should do is to sing a hymn to the God with  reverent words and pure speech, with a libation and a prayer for the  means to do what is right. However, only ten lines later, plurality strikes back in the final line (24),  where we read: Nay, always keep the gods duly in mind. 2.

Methodically the  correct first step is just to accept the irrefutable observation of Lesher: the fragments warrant attributing to Xenophanes the novel idea of a  single god of unusual power, consciousness, and cosmic influence, but  not the stronger view that beyond this one god there could be nothing  else worthy of the name.54 Next, however, we should ask the question: How must we imagine that  Xenophanes coped with the paradox? Did he? Did he experience it as  a paradox? We have seen that some scholars claim that Xenophanes  must have been a monotheist (he said so himself, didn’t he?), others  that he cannot but have been a polytheist (he said so himself, right?).  In order to solve the paradox one scholar makes an appeal to phenom- ena of linguistic-rhetorical perseverance, another devises a theology in  which gods are part of the god.55 Nobody, as far as I know, has ever  contended in an explicit and straight enunciation that Xenophanes  just adhered to both views (he said so himself, okay?), because he lit- erally had no choice.56 Before we explore this suggestion a bit further,  I should first say what I do not wish to imply by this idea. I am not  thinking of a conscious yielding to political or social pressure, whether  or not compensated by an occasional ‘eppure si muove’ between the  teeth.57 Nor do I appeal to an unconscious slip (quite a few slips as a  54 Lesher 1992, 99, thus summarizing a wide-spread opinion, as we have seen. It is  not this fact but its interpretation on which opinions widely differ. 55 “Diese verwirrende Fülle sich widersprechender Xenophanesbilder”: P. Stein- metz, Xenophanes-studien, RhM 109 (1966) 13–73, espec. 24.  56 Although Pötscher 1962 comes quite close. His discussion and refutation of all  other interpretations mentioned in my text is the most cogent one known to me. Also  parts of his interpretation of the relationship ‘One god’- ‘the gods’, that I shall cite  shortly, are convincing, but I do not follow him in his central thesis that ‘the gods’  are representatives of ‘the One god’: “Durch die Wesensgleichheit des einen Gottes  und der Götter—wenn man von der Einheit des überragenden absieht—vermögen  ihn diese zu repräsentieren;” “Der eine Gott ist in ihnen allen präsent, weil sie—die  Erscheinungsformen von ihm in der bewussten Welt—ihm in allem gleich sind, aber  er ist doch mehr als die Summe der Götter: denn er ist der Eine”. Cf. also Gerson l.c.  below n. 58. O. Gigon, Die Theologie der Vorsokratiker, in: Rose 1954, 127–155; ibid.  33–36, asks just the right questions on these types of contradictions (“Widerspruch”)  and argues that some of them are unresolvable and should be taken seriously (“unauf- hebbar und anzuerkennen” [35]).  57 This is the solution of S.E. Lawrence, The God that is Truly God and the Universe  of Euripides’ Heracles, Mnemosyne 51 (1998) 129–146, where he discusses a strikingly  similar problem of consistency in HF 1340–1346.

What I do wish to suggest can be explained in three related, but dis- tinct arguments. First, Xenophanes, besides being a genius, was and remained a child  of his time and, like most other social beings, was unable to escape from  his cultural universe, even if he had wished to. While experimenting  with one he was living with a second, different set of images and rep- resentations of the divine. The two indeed diverged dramatically and,  if subjected to a severe formal logical analysis, would inevitably have  come to a clash. The significant point—infinitely more interesting and  important than the irresolvable and indeed mistaken question, which  of the two aspects represented his real conviction58—is that they were  not scrutinized in such a relentless fashion.59 Apparently, both concep- and his preference for “The god, who if truly God, needs nothing” (sometimes  viewed as an allusion to Xenophanes, D.-K. C 1. So, e.g. W.K.C. Guthrie, The Soph- ists [Cambridge 1971] 230; Barnes 1982, 90 ff.; cf. G.W. Bond, Euripides, Heracles  [Oxford 1981] ad loc., but cf. more balanced: F. Egli, Euripides im Kontext zeitge- nössischer intellektueller Strömungen. Analyse der Funktion philosophischer Themen in  den Tragödien und Fragmenten [Munich—Leipzig 2003] 122–125) call into question  the fundamental presuppositions of the plot. Renouncing the full range of soothing,  denying and negotiating solutions by earlier scholars, Lawrence concludes: “Heracles  new god is Euripides’ way of giving his hero a purely secular orientation without  turning him into an atheist.” Chr. Sourvinou-Inwood 2003, 373, on the ‘notion of  divine self-sufficiency’ here put forward by Heracles concludes: “The central notion of  unknowability in Greek religion allowed speculation of this type to be unproblemati- cally articulated.”  58 In this respect there are excellent observations in Gerson 1990, 18 f., who aptly  notes that there may easily be some confusion in using the terms ‘monotheistic’ and  ‘polytheistic’ as contradictory and as suitable for classifying the thought of Xenophanes:  “If by ‘polytheism’ we mean the recognition of a multiplicity of active powers in the  universe stronger and more durable than men, then Xenophanes is a polytheist. (. . . .)  If ‘polytheism’ indicates belief in a multiplicity of personal beings more powerful and  durable than men, I think the textual evidence is against the claim that Xenophanes is  a polytheist. (. . . .) When I say that Xenophanes is a philosophical monotheist, I do not  mean to deny that he is a polytheist in the first sense or that, conceivably, he is a poly- theist in the second sense, but that he reasons to a unique arche in the universe . . .”  The (essential) difference between Gerson’s views and mine is that I would not deny  that the two conceptions—monotheism-poytheism—are mutually exclusive if consid- ered from one and the same perspective. Nor would I deny the possibility of the sec- ond option concerning polytheism, though avoiding the term ‘belief”. As I shall argue,  in Xenophanes’ perception they exist simultaneous and side by side as complementary  but independent forms of expression. 59 As we discussed in the previous chapter, it requires lots of courage in our often  rigidly constructivistic late modern climate to reconsider whether there may still be a  </page> <page sequence="21">  one god: three greek experiments in oneness 259 tions could and did exist side by side not only within the cultural uni- verse of one civilization or in one period of time, which is a historical  banality, but even in the mind of one poet and thinker,60 which may be  of great explanatory relevance. In other words, in the field of natural  philosophy Xenophanes devised a radically new conception of god,  yet did not even contemplate taking an equally radical leave from the  cultic—and, one might even assume partly also from the mythical61— conception of the (traditional) gods, who had always been and con- tinued to be indispensable and essential materials for the construction  of the (religious) symbolic universe of the polis. Whenever—if ever—it  was necessary to keep them apart, the author had recourse to several  different layers of discourse—philosophical, mythical, cultic—, which  constantly alternate and intertwine in his texts. In general, the two different imageries may be prevented from clash- ing by a virtuoso winking process, well-known from (socio-) psycho- logical reactions to cognitive dissonance.62 In a fascinating monograph  on Erasmus, another genius on the borderline between two paradigms,  spark of truth in the discovery of the last part of this century, for instance in the works  of Hermann Fränkel, Bruno Snell, and in a different way in Walter Pötscher, that  archaic Greeks did not (always) draw similar nor equally harsh distinctions as 20th  century readers. If we want to make sense of Greek religion, following the lines set  out by Gould 1985, we should not overlook the motto that he adopted from William  Empson: “The notion is that life involves maintaining oneself between contradictions  that cannot be solved.” And cf. the words of J.F. Holleman as quoted in Ch. II n. 53.  60 Indeed, it would do no harm to recall that Xenophanes is “the only one whose  genuine writings find a place both among the Presocratic philosophers of Diels and  the lyric anthology of Diehl”: Guthrie 1962, 361. On the grounds for his preference  for the metrical form see: G. Most, in: Long 1999, 351 ff. 61 In this respect I agree with Eisenstadt 1974 and Babut 1974, the latter of whom,  however, goes too far in downplaying the uniqueness and singularity of the new God. 62 I have amply discussed these psychological techniques introduced by L. Fest- inger, A Theory of Cognitive Dissonance (New York 1957) in the Introduction to TER  UNUS, 4–8, where more relevant titles can be found, and applied them throughout  that book. I also addressed the question whether the notion of cognitive dissonance  may be applied as long as the conflicting elements are not brought to the attention of  the observer. It may, in terms of “a winking process” applied to keep two conflicting  realities apart exactly in order to prevent them from clashing on the level of conscious  awareness. Then the dissonances are “situated just below the normal level of critical  consciousness in men [. . . . . . . . . . . . .] so that they could in principle have been aware  of it but as a rule took it for granted,” thus J.G.A. Pocock, Politics, Language, and  Time: Essays on Political Thought and History (New York 1971) 32. Another question  is whether the theory may be applied at all to pre-modern—even ancient—mentality.  This question was answered affirmatively and convincingly by N.H. Taylor, Cognitive  Dissonance and Early Christianity: A Theory and its Application Reconsidered, Reli- gion and Theology. A Journal of Contemporary Religious Discourse 5 (1998) 138–153. </page> <page sequence="22"> 260 chapter three the stark inconsistencies and ambiguities in his thought and expres- sion are explained by the fact that he belonged to two cultures: the late  medieval world which he could not forsake, and the early modern one  which he helped to create.63 And so did Xenophanes.64 In his thought-provoking excursus on the ‘logische Frage’ implied  in the contradictions of the One and the Many in Egyptian religion,  Hornung,65 after denouncing a long list of traditional explanations  marked by such predicates as ‘alogic’, ‘prelogic’, or ‘undifferentiated’,  embraces the concept of complementarity. Two logically contradic- tory predicates or qualities can both be experienced as true and valid.  He adduces Bohr’s theory of the complementary validity of both the  wave- and the quantum theory as a revealing analogy. Incidentally, the  present paragraph, more than any other in this book, may offer some  relief to those who fear that living by inconsistencies, contradictions  and ambiguities, is a symptom of (primitive) stupidity and hence may  disqualify ‘their’ Greeks. It is not and it does not. My second argument is that Xenophanes did not need to keep apart  his two types of gods. They were apart. The new god represents a radi- 63 J.D.

The Comets of 1577 and 1618 and the Decline of the Aristotelian World View in  the Netherlands (Diss. Leiden 1997). For antiquity I have argued the same concerning  the paradox of liberation and subjection in the early Hellenistic period as a signal of  cultural and political transition: “There are indispensable relics of the old which still  exists and inevitable signs of the new which already exists, irreconciled and pregnant  with tension:” TER UNUS, 39–95, espec. 82 f. For the clash between monotheism and  polytheism in Israel compare for instance: N.

Though conceived of as the imma- nent principle of all that is, he or it at the same time transcends all  that is: gods and men.66 In later times a human being who exceeded  all other mortals in power or quality—such as Hellenistic kings or  Roman emperors—could be promoted into a category different from  the human species. Transcending the condition humaine he became  god. As long as he was god—for instance during restricted periods in  which his divinity was ritually staged or politically deployed—the dis- play of human frailties was frowned upon: no spitting or sneezing for  the deified emperor during his adventus. However, though parading as  a god and being honoured with the same “hymns, reverent words and  libation,” to quote Xenophanes, and even with sacrifices, he was not  a god like the other ‘real’ gods.67 The few megalomaniacs who did fail  to observe the boundaries were considered insane. All this (and much  more) indicates that there was no such thing as one fixed category  ‘god’.68 Rather we are confronted with a type of classification with- out sharp borders, more especially with a so-called ‘polythetic class’,  a concept first coined by Wittgenstein. Such classes are like families  to which all members belong, linked by “a complicated network of  similarities overlapping and criss-crossing” without, however, sharing  all the family resemblances.69  A process of deification distantly comparable with that of the  Hellenistic ruler happened to Xenophanes’ First Principle of Being,  66 Gerson 1990, 242 n. 18, is right when he calls it misleading in a Pre-Socratic  context to use the contrast between immanence and transcendence to describe the  early understanding of an arche. I cannot go into this aspect of the Xenophanean god  here for which, besides the literature on Xenophanes mentioned in earlier notes, see  especially: J.A. Palmer, Xenophanes’ Ouranian God in the fourth Century, in: Oxford  Studies in Ancient Philosophy 16 (1998) 1–34. 67 Significantly, as a rule people did not pray to the divine ruler, although, as always,  there are a few exceptions. All this will be the subject of our last chapter. 68 See below Chapter VI. 69 L. Wittgenstein, Philosophical Investigations (New York 1958, translated from  the German ed. of 1953) I, 66 f. The principle of polythetic classification is exemplar- ily exploited by J.Z. Smith, Fences and Neighbors: Some Contours of Early Judaism,  in: idem, Imagining Religion: From Babylon to Jonestown (Chicago 1982) 1–18. It is  also usefully applied to the definition of ‘religion’: W.P. Alston, Religion, Encyclopedia  of Philosophy VII (1967) 142, distinguishes ‘nine religion-making characteristics’ and  states that “when enough of these characteristics are present to a sufficient degree, we  have religion”. The same might work out for gods, but, of course, Alston’s statements  together contain at least three subjective elements liable to arbitrariness. See on all  this: R. Needham, Polythetic Classification: Convergence and Consequences, Man 10  (1975) 349–369.  </page> <page sequence="24"> 262 chapter three  departing however from the other extreme on the scale of divinity.  Exceeding all imagination, the First Principle inevitably was endowed  with the highest and uniquely unsurpassable predicate available in the  Greek language. ‘It’ became god faute de mieux.70 However, though  bearing the same name and sharing a number of qualities with the  traditional gods, ‘he’ differs from them in other respects. Nothing  gives better expression to the profound difference than the concept  ‘transcendence’. Though belonging to the same polythetic class as (tra- ditional) gods, the One God at the same time transcends all others,  hence belongs to a different category. His ontological (and grammati- cal) ‘singularity’ entails a qualitative singularity.71 This implies that the  One and the Many did not need to compete. As concepts they were  complementary. Both possessed a conceptual domain of their own  besides sharing the territory common to gods. There was no real urge,  either in the domain of society or in that of logic, to expel either one  of them from the religious perception.72 It may be helpful here to call to mind that language can be des- perately slippery. As we shall discover in subsequent chapters, a god  need not always be god, some gods are not complete gods, other gods  are supercomplete gods, hence some gods are more god than others,73  etcetera. In other words the term theos, that we translate as “god” (but  especially here translating is a precarious if not impossible venture)  accommodates a scale of gradually shifting meanings, the extremes  being hardly recognizable as belonging to one class. Generally, the  70 As Gerson 1990, 246 n. 40, scornfully remarks about one modern interpretation  of the apeiron of Anaximander. Cf. Burkert 1996a, 27 “Language itself, as a signifying  system, seems to be in need of an ‘ultimate signifier’, the absolute, god”.  71 This would be my answer to a question raised by F. Chapouthier in: Rose 1954,  162: “Comment les philosophes ont-ils laisser subsister côte à côte d’une part le nom  de dieu pour désigner les principes de la nature et quelquefois un principe unique et  de l’autre ce même nom pour désigner les dieux de la religion traditionnelle?” (And  see the subsequent discussion there). Pötscher 1962, 5, seems to be the only one who  has understood this: “um die Götter hat man sich zu kümmern wie um eine reale  Gegebenheit (. . . .) Doch der eine Gott hat eine höhere Realität indem er der grösste  ist, sich aber nicht bloss graduell von den Göttern unterscheidet, sondern durch seine  Singularität (heis theos) in einem prinzipiellen Gegensatz zu der pluralistischen Gat- tung der theoi steht.” However, my final interpretation of their interrelationship dif- fers fundamentally from his, as cited above n. 56.  72 Comparably on the basic differences between the literary genres of epic and dra- matic poetry on the one hand and philosophy and science on the other, and their  implications for the representations of the divine: Nicolai 2005. 73 As, in a different context, Chaniotis 2010, 121 entitles one of his sections: ‘Some  gods are more divine than others’. </page> <page sequence="25">  one god: three greek experiments in oneness 263 (modern) reader’s attitude seems to be determined by two equally  irrational assumptions, namely 1) that the human mind is capable of  and prepared to constantly produce consistent thought-sequences; and  2) that language is the perfect means of communication for expressing  these thoughts adequately and unambiguously to others.74 As for the  latter assumption, even the briefest glance at the linguistic literature75  teaches us that human language is an extremely precarious means of  communication. Any introduction to polysemy will teach that one  term can unite quite incompatible, sometimes even radically opposite  implications, references and meanings, depending on the user, the sit- uation and the associations they bear. “Hence comes the great trouble  we have in understanding each other (. . . .): it is because we all use  the same words without giving them the same meaning,” Durkheim  sighed already in 1912.76 An additional complication is that it is not so  much the question of what person or what thing, but in what context  or discourse a person or thing may be called god. It is the context  or discourse which decides what is or is not tolerated. All this may  help us not too readily to dismiss a polysemantic potential in the term  “theos,” and will thus be of service in the present context as well as in  later chapters, most of all in the last one. I add briefly a third consideration, which is both a specification and  a generalization of the argument just put forward and is independent  of the specific nature of the one god of Xenophanes. There is no need  for a detailed discussion, because we have dealt with the subject in our  first chapter. There we saw that the imagery and, indeed, the ‘personal- ity’ of a god in a cultic ambiance, be it in private worship or in temple  ritual, is not necessarily identical to, in fact is often very different from,  the same god (or rather the god with the same name) in theological  reflection or mythical narrative. Moreover, it is perfectly possible, and  74 See: TER UNUS 14 ff., for a more detailed discussion and bibliographical refer- ences. 75 J.G.

They have uses, identifiable  in particular places and periods” (Carney 1972, 86). </page> <page sequence="26"> 264 chapter three even belongs to normal practice, to perform a cultic ritual without ever  relating it to the specific theological identity of the god involved. Dutch  ministers daintily succeed in ritually reciting the apostolic creed which  portrays a god whom, to judge by their sermons, the same preachers  have long lost sight of. For this same reason the many gods of civil  religion did not need to collide with the One created by Xenophanes,  probably not even in the philosopher’s own perception.77 And different they were! The profound innovation in the concept  of the Xenophanean god becomes apparent precisely in the phrases  quoted from the Banquet elegy: The first thing men of sense should do is to sing a hymn to the God  with reverent words and pure speech, with a libation and a prayer for  the means to do what is right. Insofar as the new god should be honoured with hymns, reverent  words, pure speech, and with libations, there is not much of a prob- lem. Rough outlines of what these hymns may have looked like can be  gathered from hymns referring to a ‘one and all’ ideology ubiquitous  in later times. Libations, as distinct from sacrifice (which is conspicu- ously lacking in the picture), are appropriate too. They often function  not so much as a gift to the god(s) but rather as the ritual overture  to the communication with the divine.78 However, as soon as prayer  comes into view difficulties emerge. What should one pray for to a god  of such an immense and abstract nature? The answer is as appropri- ate in the philosophical context as it is unserviceable in the religion of  daily life. One should ask for “the means to do what is right.” With this  prescription a long history of ‘philosophical prayer’ begins.79 If it is  77 Cf. S. Broadie, in: Long 1999, 210: “A precise monotheism is not among Xeno- phanes’ innovations (. . . .). As his language shows, the issue for him is not the numeri- cal unicity of the divine, but its self-harmony.” All this implies that I cannot accept  the proposition (which came to my attention after the the completion of the present  chapter) of J. Halfwassen, Der Gott des Xenophanes: Überlegungen über Ursprung  und Struktur eines philosophischen Monotheismus, ARG 10 (2008) 275–294. To my  mind his view that Xenophanes denied the existence of the ‘normal’ gods is just as  untenable as his absolutist thesis that Xenophanes “Gott und Welt ontologisch von  einander geschieden hat.”  78 P. Veyne, Images de divinités tenant une phiale ou patère: La libation comme  “rite de passage” et non pas offrande, Metis 5 (1990) 17–28. As such it may be ranged  among what M.F.C. Bourdillon &amp; M. Fortes (edd.), Sacrifice (Bristol 1980) call ‘token  gifts’, ‘gifts’ whose value consists in a gesture of piety and good will. Cf. below (Ch.  IV, n. 107). 79 Chr. Eucken o.c.

These four elements,  it should be recalled, were the stuff ancient religion was made of. The  god of Xenophanes, conversely, was ‘ab-human’81 according to the  Sceptic Timon, and “ein Denk-, Seh-, Hör-, und Intelligenzmonstrum”  in the opinion of Paul Feyerabend,82 referring to the famous charac- terization in B 24: “As whole he/it sees, as whole he/it comprehends,  as whole he/it hears.”83 Once more, ambiguity cannot be avoided. According to Jaeger, on  the strength of exactly the same data, the One God is quite clearly a  conscious, more or less personal being,84 while, on the other hand,  Cornford85—followed by many others—holds that, if ‘personal’ at all,  the god is yet not a person in the full sense of that term, since in  contrast to the traditional gods, there is no communication with him.  Indeed, according to some specialists, Xenophanes’ theology is better  characterized by the concept pantheism86 than by monotheism. Again  I would suggest that it is mistaken, and consequently doomed to fail- ure, to try and explain Xenophanes’ system in terms of an ‘either-or’  dilemma. Rather, and this time even more obviously, we are confronted  with an exemplary instance of an ‘and-and’ complementarity. In its  80 Burkert 1985, 309. 81 Thus my tentative translation of (funny) Greek ap’anthrôpôn (Fabricius; mss  apanthrôpon)—by analogy with ‘abnormal’, and in order to avoid the misleading term  ‘inhuman’—as Timon (apud Sext. Emp. Hypoth. 1.224 = Fr. A 35 D–K.) qualifies  the Xenophanean god. On this passage: E. Vogt, Des Timon von Phleius Urteil über  Xenophanes, RhM 107 (1964) 295–298. 82 Feyerabend 1986, 210.

As a theos (the second step in  the evolution) ‘he’ cannot.87 Consequently, in the course of his reflec- tion on the arche, the philosopher is both condemned to and saved by  a constantly alternating appeal to two different focuses, the physical- philosophical and the theological, each marked by its corresponding  type of discourse. However, the two layers of perception do intermingle  as they have never stopped doing in theological reflection till the pres- ent day. Due to restrictions inherent in human imagination and lan- guage it is impossible to speak about a god, however devoid of human  characteristics, without applying anthropomorphic terminology.88 Any  philosopher of religion knows it: why demand from Xenophanes more  than the humanly possible? 3. Concluding remarks One and Many, unity and diversity, it is all there in Xenophanes’ phi- losophy. However, the interaction between the two does not allow a  rash and simple definition. If there is unity in diversity here, it is not  the well-known concept of a plurality of gods united into, or being  parts or emanations of, one all-encompassing supreme divine being.  The arche devised by Xenophanes was the product of natural philoso- phy, not of theology. As physical ‘all’ it did encompass, but it encom- passed everything that is, because it was everything that is: not only  gods, but also men, and the whole material world. Just as men were  both part of it and were independent beings, so were the (traditional)  gods. As theological ‘One God’ (Heis Theos) he transcended every- thing, hence also the (other) gods, and in this perspective the gods  maintained their traditional (pluralist) independent status. Instead of  inclusiveness there is coexistence in accordance with the principle of  complementarity. In the words of M.L. West:89 “People are slow to  adjust their religion to their philosophy.” 87 Cf. O. Gigon in: Rose 1954, 138, in connection with the apeiron of Anaximander:  “Die gewaltsame Verknüpfung dinglicher und personaler Kategorien (. . . . . .). Es  genügt zu sehen, wie seltsam (. . . . .) ‚physikalische‘ und ‚theologische‘ Kategorien sich  verbinden;” 135: “Der Widerspruch ist unaufhebbar und anzuerkennen.” 88 This is the point of departure of our Chapter V. 89 In: Athanassiadi &amp; Frede 1999, 40, where he also states: “Yet it is difficult to find  a Presocratic who can be counted as a monotheist without qualification.”  </page> <page sequence="29">  one god: three greek experiments in oneness 267 In general terms, then, it would appear that a monotheistic theology is  not ‘by definition’ rigorously incompatible with polytheistic forms of  (cult-)religion. Though I have argued that Xenophanes’ monotheism  was not inclusive, I would not object to the label non-exclusivistic.90 In  the first part of this chapter we learned that the so-called monotheism  of the Old Testament was not an exclusive belief in One God during  the major part of its development. The collective volume about mono- theistic tendencies in late antiquity by Athanassiadi &amp; Frede 1999 in  the words of one reviewer, T.D. Barnes,91 “proves that even if they  worshipped a multiplicity of gods, most thinking men in late antiquity  who reflected at all on what this worship meant were in a very real  sense monotheists.” Recently Nicolai 2005 raised the question whether personal and  a-personal representations of the divine are compatible or not. For  archaic and classical Greece he concludes: Obviously, in daily praxis the more educated Greeks liberally ignored the  logical incompatibility of the traditional (strongly poetically ingrained)  religion and the pilosophically enlightened religion. Without scruples  they followed a double track course.92 “Doppelgleisig verfahren” (a double track procedure), that is the per- fect expression of what I have argued for Xenophanes and in which  this poet-philosopher is far from being an exception. As to the nature  of the (other) gods I have argued against the suggestion that they  formed a novel category different from the traditional (Homeric) gods.  However, there is yet another possibility: hoi theoi of Xenophanes  might be congruent with a traditional picture, though not with that  of the traditional Olympian family as represented in myth and cult,  but as a comprehensive expression indicating a more or less generic  90 I would be tempted to suggest for further use the term ‘sophisticated polythe- ism’, if its creator had not meant something radically different by it: W.G. Lambert,  The Historical Development of the Mesopotamian Pantheon: A Study in Sophisticated  Polytheism, in: H. Goedicke &amp; J.J.M.

In the follow- ing section I will explore this second experiment in oneness. 3. One is Many: The Gods, the God and the Divine In addition to such proclamations that god is one and all, there exists  a type of discourse in which the term god (and variants) seems to be  used as a general device to explain—or at least to convey (some) sense  to—the inexplicable, often connoting such notions as inescapable fate,  chance or the predestined. The terms ho theos, hoi theoi, to theion, ho  daimon, hoi daimones, referring to an anonymous and mysteriously  interfering divine (or at least supernatural) power, abound in Greek  idiom of all periods. A full discussion of the material can be found in  a comprehensive study by François 1957, where all the testimonies are  duly collected. We encountered the phenomenon in the passages of  Herodotus discussed in the preceding chapter and we now return for a  moment to this author. For this I have several reasons. First and fore- most these episodes reveal in an exemplary fashion the frequency of  the term and the important part played by the terms and concepts of  ‘gods’, ‘the god’ or ‘the divine’. Secondly, these passages are easily the  most appropriate guides in finding the niche or the ‘semantic family’  of these terms in a context of connotative alternatives. Thirdly, Hero- dotus is particularly interesting in this respect since he adopts and  further develops previous archaic thought patterns on the one hand,  while foreshadowing an ensuing development on the other. So let us  continue our enquiry following his lead. 1. On singular plurals It has often been observed and valued as a conspicuous characteristic  of Herodotus that in his work names of individual gods are relatively  93 See for instance: François 1957, 169 ff., whose general argument I endorse, but  whom I do not follow in his suggestion concerning Xenophanes’ theology: “Le terme  theoi n’exprime pas autre chose que la notion traditionelle de la Puissance divine,”  with reference to similar expressions in Pindar and Aeschylus.  </page> <page sequence="31">  one god: three greek experiments in oneness 269 rare, at least as far as their personal interventions in human affairs  are concerned.94 Instead, especially when he voices his own convic- tion concerning the causes of events—either as a narrator’s comment  or through the words of commentators in his text—Herodotus rather  refers to gods, the gods, or the divine.95 This does not mean that  individual gods do not occur in action. They do, but not frequently  and with little detail. For instance in stories of how they defend their  sanctuaries against enemy attack (Demeter: 9.65; Poseidon: 8.129; in  more general terms 8.109).96 But even here ambiguities soon emerge,  complicating the picture. Apollo in particular is a striking example  of brinkmanship. At times he is the icon of anonymous divine fore- knowledge or predestination, an oracular voice rather than a personal  god. At other occasions, however, he distinctly is an individual deity  with a will and affections, and in this identity he is subject to the abso- lute superior authority of fate and the predestined, that is to say: to  ‘the gods’. It is precisely the amalgamation of these two ‘personali- ties’ in the  Croesus-episode that is so illustrative of the multiplicity of  representations intertwining or interchanging in a dazzling shift of  alternations.97 In the appendix of the present book it is shown that concepts of  ‘All the gods’ and ‘The Twelve Gods’, though intended and generally  understood as the sum total of the whole pantheon or of the twelve  94 This is hardly to be explained as an overriding ‘historiographical principle’ as  D. Lateiner, The Historical Method of Herodotus (Toronto etc. 1989) 64–67 argues, but  rather an example of the ‘uncertainty principle’ as Gould 1985, 9–14 (and elsewhere,  see below) argues. Cf. Harrison 1997, 104, and on the use of ‘vague designations’ idem  2000, 169 f. See also next note.  95 Long ago I learned most of what was worth knowing concerning Herodotus’  religious conceptions from a work in my own language: G.C.J. Daniëls, Religieus- historische studie over Herodotus (Antwerpen 1946). On the issue at stake see espec.  Linforth 1928. Following this innovative article there has been a deluge of studies on  this issue, most of which were already of great use in Ch. II: Nilsson GGR I, 759 ff.;  Pötscher 1958; L. Huber, Religiöse und politische Beweggründe des Handelns in der  Geschichtsschreibung Herodots (Tübingen 1965); Gould 1989, espec. Ch. 4 ‚Why things  happen‘. More recent and most excellent: Gould 1994 and Harrison 1997; idem 2000,  Ch. 6, “The Unity and Multiplicity of the Divine’, espec. 164–169 (daimon), 169–171  (the gods); 171–175 (the god); 176–179 (the divine—τὸ θεῖον). 96 Linforth 1928, 211 ff. gives a complete list of (eleven) instances of direct inter- course between named gods and men. For events ascribed to named gods, see: ibid.  213–217; Harrison 1997, 104 f.; idem 2000, index s.v. ‘divine intervention.’  97 See on the general status of Apollo’s oracles and the variety of reactions and  interpretations: R.C.T.

In cultic contexts  (oath, vow, sacrifice, prayer) the collectives ‘twelve gods’ and ‘all the  gods’ have acquired an identity in their own right, side by side with that  of the individual gods. Besides illuminating questions of ordering, it  can also help us clarify questions connected with our present subject. If the Greeks can refer to ‘all the gods’ and Zeus and Apollo, this  at least implies that the two constituents in this formula are of the  same order, belong to the same class or system: both collectives and  individuals boast a cultic existence and receive the concomitant forms  of worship. This appears to be quite different in the case of hoi theoi  (the gods). It can be shown that hoi theoi as an anonymous notion  in the passages of Herodotus and elsewhere in Greek literature radi- cally differs from hoi theoi in the sense of πάντες θεοί. More often  than not the term ‘the gods’ is not intended to denote the sum total  of individual gods,98 which may receive worship as πάντες θεοί in  local cults.99 Rather than a cumulative or collective notion ‘the gods’  represent a conceptualizing comprehensive one, in which the notion  of formal-grammatical plurality has practically disappeared from the  semantic field of vision.100 This is most obviously apparent from the  fact that hoi theoi may occur as an equivalent of ho theos.101 In contexts   98 Already in the beginning of the last century W.H.S. Jones, A Note on the Vague  Use of THEOI, CR 27 (1913) 252ff., referred to this as a “vague use.”  99 This goes beyond such formulations as: “Herodotus recognized the existence of  numerous gods who may act as individuals on particular occasions, or who may be  thought of as something like a unified group with a racial solidarity contrasting them  with the race of men,” as Linforth 1928, 218, has it, though I do accept many of his  keen observations, e.g. on theoi: “There is actually no more mythological connotation  in the word than there is in the word ‘God’ as used by a monotheist” (219). Mikalson  1983, 67 f. with numerous testimonies and literature in n. 18, speaks of an “abstractive  collective” and states that such a persistent conception is “one of the features which  (. . .) tends to distinguish it from its literary counterpart.” Interestingly, Herodotus  2.52, says that “in ancient times (. . .) the Pelasgians offered and prayed to the gods, but  without any distinction of name or title—for they had not yet heard of such a thing  (. . . .). Long afterwards the names of the gods were brought into Greece from Egypt  and the Pelasgians learned them.” See: W. Burkert, Herodot über die Namen der Göt- ter: Polytheismus als historisches Problem, MH 42 (1985) 121–132. 100 Cf. J. Assmann, Monotheism and Polytheism, in: Johnston 2004, 16: “Unity in  this case does not mean the exclusive worship of one God, but the structure and  coherence of the divine world, which is not just an accumulation of deities, but a  structured whole, a pantheon.”  101 François 1957, 305, collects 83 texts throughout Greek literature in which the  author uses theos/daimon alternatively in singular and plural, without any difference  in meaning.  </page> <page sequence="33">  one god: three greek experiments in oneness 271 referring to fate, the predestined, chance or fortune, these two notions  are fully interchangeable102 as we can see for instance from the fact that  the singular noun ho theos may take a verbal form in the plural.103 Likewise, ho theos or to theion,104 in the generic sense of the divine  authority ruling the universe and interfering in human life often   synonymous with fate and predestination, stands in opposition to one  individual god out of many.105 The latter meaning of course occurs  as well.106 In some of the expressions of the Croesus logos ho theos  unequivocally refers to one individual god, namely Apollo, who is  with equal certainty not to be identified with fate and chance since  according to his own confession by his attempt to help Croesus he  has opposed himself to this highest anonymous authority, to which  gods of his own category (that is not ‘the gods’ in the sense of an  anonymous steering principle) are subjected, having only a restricted  scope for intervention. And, of course, the term theos referring to a  special god is ubiquitous in contexts where the identity of this god is  102 M.L. West, in: Athanassiadi &amp; Frede 1999, 38: “Whenever some theological truth  is formulated, some statement about the régime under which mankind lives, the writer  typically does not name one of the traditional gods but says οἱ θεοί or ὁ θεός. The  indifference as between singular and plural is possible because when someone says ‘the  gods’, the assumption is that these gods act as a unanimous body.” 103 François 1957, 106, which reinforces the conclusion that “(ho) theos et (ho) dai- mon ont été généralement employés, au singulier, dans un sens collectif” (307). Else  1949 mentions numerous cases of the collocation of monotheistic and polytheistic  language in early Greek literature. 104 Though I agree with the distinction by Pötscher 1958, 28 f., between theos as the  generic concept of a god interfering in human life, as opposed to the mythical gods,  I cannot accept his suggestion that to theion is a higher abstraction encompassing  these two categories. The testimonia leave no doubt that ho theos and to theion belong  roughly in the same semantic register, even though there are functional differences for  which see: Harrison 2000, 176 ff., especially on the deductive and ‘diagnostic’ nature  of the use of to theion. 105 Pötscher 1958 is most instructive on the differentiation between ‘the god’ as a  general concept and the gods of myth and cult. P. 7: “Beide Weisen, das Übernatür- liche zu erfassen, als “den Gott” oder als einen aus dem reichen Götterhimmel der  Griechen bestehen nebeneinander.” At p. 8, he speaks of “einer gewissen Schichtenauf- bau,” one layer for the experience theos, the other for the mythical gods. Cf. Harrison  2000, 171–175, on the double denotation of ho theos as ‘the god in question’ on the  one hand and the ‘anonymous’ generic use of the term on the other, including the  quick alternation of the two in several passages. 106 Linforth 1928, goes as far as possible—certainly too far—in tracing either an  unnamed, but nonetheless well-known individual god or “the god who is directing  this affair” wherever the term ho theos is used. The weaknesses of this approach are  exemplarily exposed by Pötscher 1958.  </page> <page sequence="34"> 272 chapter three made explicit.107 So, paradoxically, both ho theos and hoi theoi may be  indicative of both a polytheistic and a mon(othe)istic thought pattern.  On the one hand, hoi theoi may be used as a plural of individual gods  as e.g. in expressions such as: “one of the gods” or “none of the gods.”108  In the monistic sense of ‘the divine authority ruling the universe’, on  the other hand, the expression hoi theoi, though grammatically the  plural of ho theos, from a semantic point of view is not.109 Indeed, as  quoted earlier, “Words (. . . .) do not have ‘meanings’ in the sort of way  that children have parents. They have uses, identifiable in particular  places and periods.” Accordingly, the two different notions covered by the same plu- ral hoi theoi, though prone to confusion, as a rule can be well dis- tinguished if viewed in their respective contexts. For it is the context  which makes it possible for the language user to filter out from the  various possible meanings of polyvalent words or expressions all  except the desired ones.110 Xenophanes profited from this opportunity  offered by language. And as we shall experience to our sorrow in the  third section of this chapter, there is some truth in the provocative  contention by Quentin Skinner that: “if a statement is considered in a  fully open context (. . . ), a man might mean by it anything that a man  might mean by it.”111 One of the most telling differences between the two types of hoi theoi  is that ‘the gods’ in the generic sense are by their very nature anony- mous, while ‘the gods’ as pantes theoi are conceived as a collective of  known and named gods. Now, probably the major function of name  giving is social integration—the incorporation of the named person  into one’s own cultural sphere. Reversely, anonymity may either indi- cate that the anonymous one does not belong to one’s own group or,  on the other hand, is of an unbridgeably higher status, which makes  him into a qualitative ‘other’. Burckhardt Gladigow holds that absolute  107 François 1957, 315–326 gives all the relevant places from the Greek literature  treated in his book.  108 Harrison 2000, 170. 109 Although I agree with François 1957, 308, speaking on the term hoi theoi in  Homer: “on laisse complètement dans l’ombre les traits individuels des divers dieux  pour envisager avant tout l’unité de l’ensemble,” I would in general go one step further  and for later authors like Herodotus argue that hoi theoi is not even experienced as a  ‘collective’ notion. See also below p. 273 f. 110 Cf. Carney 1972, 105 ff. 111 See: J. Dunn, The Identity of the History of Ideas, Philosophy 43 (1968) 85–104,  espec. 98.

They are unapproachable. Moschos fr. 2 (mid 2nd c. BC)  addresses Fate as λιταῖς ἄτεγκτε “not to be softened by prayers,” and  Vettius Valens 5.9.2 (2nd c. AD) says: “It is impossible to gain the vic- tory over the predestined fate, either by prayer or by sacrifice.” These  expressions are topoi,113 and as such can be found in much earlier liter- ary expressions. Here, I would suggest, we have arrived at the fundamental difference  between the god(s) as a comprehensive anonymous (and monistic)  notion and the gods as the sum total of individual, named divinities. A  reference to the first category may provide a cause for disaster but is not  helpful as to the desire for solution, help or recovery. Being an unap- proachable supernatural principle ‘the god(s)’ cannot be mollified and  there is no point in prayer or sacrifice.114 There are altars and sacrifices  for pantes theoiŸ there are none for hoi theoi.115 If you want to get rid  112 Gladigow 1975, 30 f.; 1981, 1217 f. As he also discusses, this is not the only  function of anonymity. See e.g. A. Henrichs, Namenlosigkeit und Euphemismus: zur  Ambivalenz der chthonischen Mächte im altattischen Drama, in: H. Hofmann (ed.),  Fragmenta dramatica: Beiträge zur Interpretation der griechischen Tragiker-fragmente  und ihrer Wirkungsgeschichte (Göttingen 1991). When Burkert 1996a, 13 concludes:  “Götter bleiben unverfügbar” this is a reference to a different phenomenon, namely  the typically Greek type of relationship with the gods which does not allow man to lay  a claim on the god by addressing him/her as “my god.” See above p. 102. 113 Especially when predestined fate takes the form of the inevitability of death. Cf.  also below nn. 158 and 159. The inflexibility of ‘fate,’ heimarmene or ‘the gods’, does  not prevent ancient man from praying to individual gods. See: L. Lenaz, Regitur fato si  Iuppiter ipse . . .: Una postilla al Carmen contra paganos, in: Perennitas. Studi in onore  di Angelo Brelich (Roma 1980) 293–309, espec. 298–305.  114 This is a characteristic that ‘the gods’ share with the Xenophanean one. As  Empedocles says of his god: “It is not possible to reach to god and set him before our  eyes, nor to grasp him with our hands.” Or Feyerabend 1986, 210 on the traditional  gods as opposed to the Xenophanean one: “Diese konnte man ja noch verstehen, man  konnte sie beeinflüssen, man konnte sie sogar an der Nase herumführen, man konnte  sie durch Opfer, Bitten, Argumente von unerwünschten Handlungen abbringen—zur  Welt die sie lenkten, gab es ein persönliches Verhältnis.” There is some likeness here  with the god Hades, who is (nearly entirely) devoid of altars and sacrifices. A scholion  on Homer (ad Il. 9.158) attributes this to his inexorable nature. Eur. Alc. 424 calls him  ἄσπονδος θεός.  115 Mikalson 1989, 86, on classical Athens: “οἱ θεοί as a group lack all the defi- nitions of locale, cult site, and function which chararacterize practised religion. οἱ  θεοί, like daimon, is a conceptual, not a cult term. Athenians, in the classical period,  at least, did not make prayers to οἱ θεοί in these terms. (. . . .) Prayers to ‘the gods’  whether they be successful or not, are a literary device—meaning little more than ‘I  pray’ or ‘I strongly hope.’” Cf. idem 1983, 68.

As the nurse in Eur.  Hippolytus 359 f. comments on the cause of Phaedra’s illegal love: Sure no goddess Cypris (Aphrodite) is, But, if it may be, something more than a God, (ἀλλ’ εἴ τι μεῖζον ἄλλο γίγνεται θεο˃) Who hath ruined her, and me, and all this house. No sacrifice, no wishing prayer, I said, because what is predestined  (either by arbitrary fate or by way of retribution) cannot be escaped,  not even by a god. The only exception to this rule is at the same time  its most gratifying confirmation. Just as the cause of unfathomable  events cannot be “a god but must be something more than a god,” so  the inexplicable sacrifice that is something more than sacrifice cannot  be associated with a god. I am referring to human sacrifice, particu- larly self-sacrifice as it is demanded and executed in numerous myths.  pretationem oraculi Clari Apollinis do occur in later antiquity, namely in a series of  inscriptions known from various parts of the Empire, all versions of the same oracle  from Klaros, propagated perhaps on the initiative of Caracalla after his consultation  of the oracle in 213 AD. The oracle may have recommended to continue worship- ping the traditional Olympian gods, although they ranked below the highest god.  See: S. Mitchell, Inscriptions from Meli (Kocaaliler) in Pisidia, AS 53 (2003) 139–159,  with a new Greek sample; EBGR 2003, no. 116; C.P. Jones, Ten Dedications “To the  Gods and Goddesses” and the Antonine Plague, JRA 18 (2005) 293–301; Busine 2005,  184–189; Chaniotis 2010, 117 f. 116 A striking corroboration can be found in the fourteenth book of the Odyssey,  which is brimful of references to ‘Zeus’, ‘god’ or the ‘gods’ as agents of some good  but more often bad experiences, but never in the context of prayer or sacrifice. When  at last Eumaios prepares a sacrifice (414 ff. See below Chapter IV. p. 367 f.), the first  prayer is to “all the gods” (423 ff.) who are beseeched to bring Odysseus safely home.  Just so Odysseus is advised to sacrifice to all the gods for a safe trip home, Od. 11.132 ff.  117 See Nicolai 2005, 22–29, who argues that the personal and a-personal images  of deity are perfectly compatible in the mind of the believer exactly because “jede  von beiden einerseits nur eine—jeweils durch einen individuellen Erfahrungshori- zont bestimmte—anthropogene Schöpfung darstellt (. . . .), andererseits aber zugleich  eine ganz bestimmte situationsbedingte Funktion zu erfüllen hat.” He argues that in  a hopeless situation man needs to resort to a personal god to whom he can pray for  help and salvation. In a more philosophical reflective context it is rather the god(s)  as highest principle of causation that man relies on for explanation and comfort. Cf.  Nilsson GGR I, 219: “in diesen kollektiven oder unbestimmten Bezeichnungen wird  das individuelle verwischt.”  </page> <page sequence="37">  one god: three greek experiments in oneness 275 Demanded by whom? With one or two exceptions never by an indi- vidual god, for as Plutarch says in his Life of Pelopidas 21, “such a  barbaric and unlawful sacrifice could not possibly please any of the  gods” (οὐδενὶ τῶν κρειττόνων). It was not any of the gods, but ‘the  gods’, anonymous gods, who were the authorities that were consis- tently credited with the ultimate claim to this “sacrifice more than  sacrifice.”118 As in our earlier discussion of Xenophanes, here again we descry  two at first sight not easily compatible conceptions of the divine world,  which nonetheless are both experienced as simultaneously true and  valid. Nilsson GGR I 761 was right when he wrote: “Herodot war eben  so guter Polytheist wie irgendeiner seiner Zeitgenossen.” But those who  have detected monotheistic tendencies in his cosmology are equally  right.119 Again we observe two different but co-existing layers of divine  conceptualization, each embedded in its own type of discourse, and we  observe that, like Xenophanes, Herodotus saw no problem in profess- ing mildly—albeit far from Xenophanean—monotheistic ideas side by  side to a traditional polytheism.120 Both conceptions are juxtaposed and  intertwined, throughout his work, sometimes influencing each other.  For, albeit above-individual, the concept of the anonymous divine  authority is not as purely abstract as the heis theos of Xenophanes.  The mechanical working of divine retribution and compensation by  ‘the gods’ can be expressed in more ‘affective’ terms: the universal law  of alternation that the excessively prosperous have to fear may alter- nate with divine envy, thus at least terminologically ‘humanizing’ the  mechanical law into a more anthropomorphic affect.121 118 Versnel 1981b, espec. 171–179. Comparably in funerary texts it is never one  specific god but always anonymous gods, ‘the gods’ (sometimes with predicates like  iniqui or iniusti), who are blamed for premature death. See below n. 158. 119 Which does not make him a “closet monotheist” as Harrison 2000, 179 rightly  notes. When he adds “The use of singular nouns (. . .) no more reflects a resolute  monotheism than plurals suggest a radical polytheism” the emphasis should be placed  on ‘resolute’ and ‘radical’. 120 This by no means involves that Herodotus should be a “follower of Xeno- phanes,” as has been argued by E. Hussey in an unpublished essay on ‘The Religious  Opinions of Herodotus’ as quoted by Gould 1994, 94 n. 7. Nor was he a disciple of   Anaximander. Thus: P.S. Derow, Historical Explanation: Polybius and his Predeces- sors, in: S. Hornblower (ed.), Greek Historiography (Oxford 1994) 78, as contested  by Harrison 1997, 112, and idem 2000, 116. Their respective religious cosmologies  widely differ. 121 For divine envy in archaic Greek literature see above Ch. II n. 72. More generally:  S. Ranulf, The Jealousy of the God and Criminal Law at Athens (London-Kopenhagen  </page> <page sequence="38"> 276 chapter three If, then, the notion of ‘the gods’ becomes near identical to the all- embracing power of Fate, there is no systematization of the precise  relationship between the two. In the words of Nilsson GGR I 761: In Fate he perceives the divine in action, without questioning the rela- tionship between inescapable Fate and divine power.122 Nor is there any explicit reflection on the precise relationship between  freedom and responsibility in human action and the arbitrary omnipo- tence of ‘the gods’. Numerous are the reports of events—especially cat- astrophic ones—that are prepared by the gods or the god, but enacted  by man (Hdt. 7.8a 1; 7.139.5; 8.109.3).123 As noted earlier Herodotus was a traît d’union between the archaic  period that preceded and the ideas of the fourth century and the Hel- lenistic period that followed. The terms ho theos, hoi theoi, to theion,  ho daimon, hoi daimones referring to an anonymous and mysteriously  interfering supernatural power abound in Greek idiom of all periods.124  François 1957 offers a full survey of the evidence125 and thus extends  the data so characteristic of Herodotus’ theology to different periods  and authors, from Homer via archaic poetry, 5th century tragedy and  historiography,126 to 4th century rhetoric and philosophy. Ho theos and  ho daimon in open contexts, so he sums up, practically never denote  ‘un Dieu unique et personnel’. Significantly, the only exception seems  to be Xenophanes, whose One God does designate one specific divine  1933); P.

After Herodotus, with in his wake Xenophon, especially in his Hel- lenika, as an important transition point,128 the idiom remains popular,  but a significant shift becomes apparent in the rise of Tuche (For- tune, Luck, “die Signatur des beginnenden Hellenismus”)129 as a rival  designation. Fourth Century Athenian orators continued to appeal  to religious arguments for purposes of persuasion.130 The politicians  Demosthenes, who opposed the Macedonian king Philippos, and  Aeschines, who had long favoured the Macedonian, both had to  admit in the end that the historical outcome of their policies was not  in accordance with what they had intended or expected. Both read- ily took recourse to ‘the God’, to daimonion, or to Tuche, which are  freely interchangeable.131 Aeschin. 2.130–1: “It was Tuche first of all  127 François 1975, 311: “Les conceptions de Xénophane constituent (. .) une caté- gorie spéciale.” Cf.

However, in accordance  with its focus on a ‘happy ending’ the novel may also accept an overall divine justice:  </page> <page sequence="40"> 278 chapter three that ruined the Phocians, and she is mistress of all things” (Ɩύχη ἡ  πάντων ἐστι κυρία).

Most significantly, in the same period the ‘envy of  the gods’ is gradually replaced by the ‘enviousness of Fate.’132 2. Concluding remarks The term hoi theoi as the semantic plural of—and hence clearly dis- tinct from—ho theos, designates the total multitude of traditional indi- vidual gods as individual gods, and in that sense practically equals ‘all  the gods’, as exemplified in Plato’s advice: “one must praise all the  gods” as discussed in Appendix I. ‘All the gods’ can be addressed in  prayer. They even boast cultic worship, as we shall see. Herodotean  (hoi) theoi as a generic expression, though grammatically a plural,  from a semantic point of view refers to a unity, a oneness, signifying  one all-governing divine principle. Here hoi theoi is not distinct from  but, on the contrary, semantically equals ho theos and to theion. The  two different notions covered by the same plural hoi theoi, though  prone to confusion, as a rule can be well distinguished if viewed in  their respective contexts. But if we do not have a context the choice  will be less obvious. Consequently, I would not be so sure which of the  two possible denotations (or if one prefers: connotations) is the domi- nant one in the topical opening words of official decrees in Athenian  inscriptions: theoi.133 K. Waldner, Die poetische Gerechtigkeit der Götter: Recht und Religion im griechis- chen Roman, in: D. Elm von der Osten e.a. (edd.), Texte als Medium und Reflexion  von Religion im römischen Reich (Stuttgart 2006) 101–123. 132 Aalders 1979. Tuche and Fate become near equivalents in this period.  133 Accordingly, there has been much guessing around about the ‘real’ meaning of  this heading. R.L. Pounder, The Origin of theoi as Inscription-Heading, in: Studies  Presented to Sterling Dow (Durham 1984) 243–250, gives a survey and a new inter- pretation (245): “theoi is not a dedicatory formula, nor a formal appeal for good for- tune, nor an indication that suitable religious rites had been performed. Rather (. . .)  its presence on the stone may be best explained as harking back to an early religious  element, imprecatory and apotropaic in nature.” How complicated things may be  becomes apparent in the opening of the iamata inscriptions at Epidauros, which has  in the upper left Θεός, in the upper right Ɩύχα ἀγαθά, and in the next line the title:  </page> <page sequence="41">  one god: three greek experiments in oneness 279 Concerning the relationship of monotheism and polytheism in Hero- dotus I here summarize our findings in a felicitous formulation by  Linforth:134 Though the multiplicity of gods is never called in question, there is a  disposition to speak of the divine element in the world as if it were char- acterized by the indivisibility of the god of the pure monotheist. As if, as we will note in several chapters of this book, is perhaps the  most productive and promising strategy in religion. Throughout their history the different notions of anonymous divine  intervention share a central function: they are conceptual devices  deployed to convey sense to the inexplicable by anchoring it in an ulti- mate authority, even if this implies the acknowledgement of the limi- tations of human knowledge in these matters.135 While Xenophanes’  God helps us explain how the (material) world is (hence is ‘good to  think [with]’), ‘the god’ or ‘the gods’ of Herodotus (and of his prede- cessors and successors) help us understand why (catastrophic) events  happen in human life, and so to accept them (they are ‘good to suf- fer with’).136 The first is the revolutionary creation by one individual,  the latter ones are moulded by the collective imagery of a civilization.  Together they are basic instruments “to create a world of meaning in  the context of which human life can be significantly lived.”137 Inher- ent in their common function, both types of gods also share a nearly  complete lack of worship in terms of statues, altars, temples, cult, and,  most relevant: prayer. While Herodotus’ ‘gods’ may reflect either the arbitrary, or the  moral or the mechanical principles of alternation or retaliation, Tuche  is essentially an arbitrary and capricious power in accordance with her  Ȥάματα το˃ Ǹπόλλωνος καὶ το˃ Ǹσκλαπίου. It would be a mistake to take theos as  referring to (one of ) the two Epidaurian gods. 134 Linforth 1928, 218. Although, as noted above n. 99, I cannot accept the overall  view on which it is based.  135 Gould 1994, 94 and more extensively on the ‘uncertainty principle’: Gould 1985,  espec. 9–14. 136 ‘Good to think (with)’ is perhaps the most characteristic expression of the ‘école  de Paris’ (including Vernant, after Lévi-Strauss).

See also: Burkert  1996a, 26 f.: “Affliction is made bearable by an ultimate if non-empirical answer to the  grieving one’s question, ‘why’.” Cf. Harrison 1997, 108: “The gods act then as a kind  of outside regulatory body of human attempts at justice,” adding, however: “This is, of  course, to reduce a complex web of religious beliefs to a simple formula.” 137 T.F.

Not by chance it was exactly this power  that from the late classical period onwards did receive divine honours,  was worshipped with sacrifices and statues in temples dedicated to her,  and—especially as Agathe Tuche (Good Fortune)—grew into a great  goddess: an astounding strategy for domesticating the fearfully arbi- trary power of Chance. Many poleis had their protecting Tuche, as did  kings.138 However great, the goddess remained whimsical and (for that  reason?) never ousted the other gods. We shall meet this “Mistress of  all things” again in the next section. 4. “One is the God”139 1. Praising the god Heis (ho) theos (‘one is the god!’): this is the acclamation that resounded  far and wide in the Greek speaking eastern part of the Roman world  138 For Tyche as a goddess see: A.A.

After this chapter was finished, I had the chance to read first drafts  of the papers now published as Belayche 2010 and Chaniotis 2010, briefly announced  in Chaniotis-Chiai 2007. Both offer fresh, detailed, and important treatments of  themes connected with the notion of henotheism, focussing more than I did on their  social and political contexts. Thus they present a welcome substantiation as well as an  illuminating amplification of what I had argued in TER UNUS. Since their main argu- ments and conclusions in all respects concur with mine I have largely maintained my  present text as it was, updating ancient evidence and modern bibliography wherever  it seemed useful. After the completion of this chapter G.F. Chiai sent me drafts of a  number of his articles most of them in print at that time: Il villaggio ed il suo dio:  considerazioni sulla concorrenza religiosa nelle comunità rurali dell’Asia Minore in  epoca romana, Mythos.

Considerazioni sull’  enoteismo e sulla costruzione del divino in Asia Minore (forthcoming SMSR 2010).  They all concern the religious and cultural mentality typical of the henotheistic cults  of Asia Minor as discussed in the works of scholars mentioned above as well as in  the present section, and are particularly useful for their collections of the epigraphical  evidence. On occurrence and meaning of the cheer heis (ho) theos see most recently:  C. Markchies, Heis Theos? Religionsgeschichte und Christentum bei Erik Peterson, in:  B. Nichtweiss (ed.), Vom Ende der Zeit. Geschichtstheologie und Eschatologie bei Erik  Peterson (Sympos. Mainz) (Münster 2001) 38–74; idem 2002. Cf. also next note.  </page> <page sequence="43">  one god: three greek experiments in oneness 281 of the Hellenistic and Imperial era down to the sixth century AD.140  Nor is it lacking in Christian literature.141 We recover the expression— often applied as a protective spell142—engraved in amulets, rings, gems  and other objects, inscribed in stone and written in papyri as well as in  (especially religious) literature. With this acclamation we broach our  third ‘experiment in oneness’, the theology which is generally referred  to as ‘henotheism’. The term ‘henotheism’ is a modern formation canonized by Max  Müller,143 only later, in the study of Hellenistic religions, associated  with and redefined in the light of the acclamation heis (ho) theos. In  anticipation of a demonstration given below and in accordance with  the provisional definition given above p. 244, we can state for the  moment that the acclamation does not necessarily imply monothe- istic notions (‘there is no other god except this god’), although this  connotation may understandably creep in from time to time.144 As a  140 “Man stolpert (. . . .) förmlich über εἷς θεός-inschriften,” thus Markschies 2002,  213, speaking about Syria in 5th c. AD. The basic collection has long been Petersson  1926. Further attestations and discussions also in the works of Weinreich and Nock.  There has been a host of more recent publications of single acclamations especially in  papyri and on gems. At the moment of writing Markschies’ revised and augmented  edition of Peterson is in the press. See Markschies 2002, where he demonstrates the  differences in the connotations of the expression among Christians, Jews, Samaritans  in late antiquity, inter alia referring to a find of more than 70 new texts in Samaria  on which see: L. Di Segni, ƈἷς θεός in Palestinian Inscriptions, SCI 13 (1994) 94–115.  Cf. also Fürst 2006.  141 As it is still alive in modern Greek. At Good Friday the children chant: “ένας  είναι ο θεός” (God is one) (Friedl 1962, 102). Curiously enough, in the period in  which Christians exploited the cheer to distinguish their creed from that of the  pagans, milestones in Palestine seem to counter this propaganda by acclaiming the  ‘neo-pagan’ emperor Julian thus: εἷς θεός, εἷς Ȥουλιανὸς ὁ Αȼγουστος (vel βασιλεύς)  (Peterson 1926, 271) and εἷς θ[εός], νίκ[α], sουλι[ανέ] (SEG 41.1544). 142 The acclamation of a god as ‘one’ is often closely connected with expressions  of his outstanding soteriological qualities. “One is the god who heals every sickness,”  claims a magical papyrus published by D. Wortmann, Neue magische Texte, BJ 168  (1968) no. 7, p. 105 (= Betz PGM XCIX; Suppl.Mag. 33), who failed to notice that this  is just a slightly elaborated version of a very common acclamation: εἷς θεὸς ὁ βοηθῶν/ βοηθός (‘One is God the helper/healer’): Petersson 1926, passim. 143 above p. 244. 144 Significantly, when it does, there may still remain inconsistencies. We saw above  (n. 8) that Paul 1 Cor. 8:4–6, says that “we know that (. . .) there is no God but one,”  (οὐδεὶς θεὸς εἰ μὴ εἷς), which doubtless refers to a monotheistic conception. How- ever, this phrase is immediately followed by an undiluted polytheistic statement. Cf.  Wengst 1967, 132: “Dass diese Übernahme in den christlichen Bereich nicht eine  völlige Uminterpretation im Sinne des Monotheismus bedeutete, sondern dass der  elative Sinn noch erhalten blieb, zeigt der Kontext von 1 Kor 8:6, wenn Paulus die  Einzigkeit des Kyrios Jesus im Gegenüber zu den vielen Kyrioi betont, deren Existenz  </page> <page sequence="44"> 282 chapter three rule, it implies a personal devotion to one god (‘there is no other god  like this god’) without involving rejection or neglect of other gods.  As such this acclamation discloses a shift in religious attitudes of the  Hellenistic and Imperial periods which, although not strictly mono- theistic and not necessarily a praeparatio to the adoption of mono- theism, belongs among the most striking of all antiquity. To be sure,  the Mediterranean population did not en masse convert or adhere to  henotheistic types of devotion, no more than it massively converted to  the so-called ‘Oriental religions’. On the contrary, henotheism seems  to have remained a somewhat sectarian phenomenon of an essentially  competitive nature. However, this did not prevent many of its features  from permeating established types of religion as well. As such it is  certainly one of the most characteristic hallmarks of what Veyne 1986  calls “le second paganisme” of the second and third centuries AD.  Various features, however, can be perceived long before this period  and it is here that we shall start our exposition. As it is impossible to embark upon a detailed treatment of all the  different aspects of henotheism, I select three topics for brief discus- sion: 1) the typical characteristics of the religious mentality implied  in this conception, 2) the concept of ‘oneness’ in terms such as Greek  heis, feminine: mia; monos, feminine: monê; and Lat. unus/una, solus/ sola, 3) the question of origins. This disposition may cause some  surprise if not suspicion. Why not focus first and foremost on the  denotation of the central element of henotheism: the term heis? The  answer is that it is practically unfeasible to determine precisely what  acclamative heis (‘one’) denotes—not surprisingly when dealing with   acclamations—so that the maximum we can hope to recover is what  the term  connotes—not surprisingly when dealing with a religious  expression. It might even be argued that acclamative heis does not  ‘denote’ at all, but instead summarizes, hence evokes, a set of con- notations, without which the expression cannot be understood at all.145  er in v. 5 einraümt.” On the use of the formula heis theos in connection with the pro- cess of christianisation see: F.R. Trombley, Hellenic Religion and Christianization I–II  (Leiden-New York 1993–1994), I, 120 ff.; II, 313 ff.; Fürst 2006. For a recent—brief  but informative—discussion of henotheism in (late) antiquity, in accordance with my  own ideas, see Eich 2010, 101–110. 145 On religious acclamations and the diversity of their meanings and implications  see: Chaniotis 2010, 123, with ample literature in nn. 46 ff.; idem, Acclamation as a  Form of Religious Communication’, in: H.

Interest- </page> <page sequence="45">  one god: three greek experiments in oneness 283 However, a quest for connotations requires insight into the religious  ambience in which the predicate heis belongs, in other words a delin- eation of the religious Sitz im Leben of henotheism. In order to achieve  this we shall proceed in two steps. First, we shall focus our attention on the goddess Isis. Not only  was she an eminently henotheistic deity in that she was consistently— and one of the first to be—acclaimed as being “One,” but her spe- cific  qualities were also lauded in extensive hymns, called ‘aretalogies’  or ‘praises’. A brief summary of such an aretalogy will also offer the  most convenient avenue to a first, provisional discussion of the ethno-  cultural roots of this belief system. Next, more generally, we shall draw  up an inventory of the most conspicuous elements of the theology  involved as exemplified in a variety of different religious expressions,  all of them indicative of the religiosity concerning gods who are praised  as ‘one’ or at the least as uniquely great. 2. Aretalogy An aretalogy is a laudatory description of the miraculous power (arete)  of a god. The longest and best-known is the Isis aretalogy of Kume146  (further referred to as K). Like other samples of these liturgical pane- gyrics, often publicized as a token of gratitude and/or for propagandis- tic purposes, it was inscribed on stone.147 The remarkable resemblance  ing discussions on the socio-psychological mechanism of the acclamation in Roman  times: G.S. Aldrete, Gestures and Acclamations in Ancient Rome (Baltimore 1999). 146 Apart from many specialized studies and editions of various versions of the  same aretalogy in other inscriptions or literary texts, the text of K can be found e.g. in  W. Peek, Der Isishymnus von Andros und verwandte Texte (Berlin 1930); R. Harder,  Karpokrates von Chalkis und die memphitische Isispropaganda, Abh. Berlin 1943  (1944), Grandjean 1975, IG XII Suppl. pp. 98/9, Totti 1985 no. 1. A translation in:  F.C. Grant, Hellenistic Religions (Indianapolis 1980 = 1953) 131 ff. For full bibliog- raphy and discussion of K and other aretalogies, the genre aretalogy in general, its  nature and origin, I refer to TER UNUS 37–52. On the aretalogy of Harpokrates from  Chalkis see recently: R. Matthey, Retour sur l’hymne “arétalogique” de Karpokrate a  Chalcis, ARG 9 (2007) 191–222. 147 Besides these aretalogies there were other means to extol the majesty of the  god(dess), for instance by relating a specific miracle or even by collecting these sto- ries in miracle books. The two types could be combined, as for example in the hymn  of Maronea (Grandjean 1975), “the only surviving sophistic encomium to a deity  of the Hellenistic ages” (D. Papanikolaou, The Aretalogy of Isis from Maroneia and  the Question of Hellenistic “Asianism,” ZPE 168 [2009] 59–70, espec. 67). Many of  these aretai are reproduced by Longo 1969. They are discussed by Nock 1933, 84 ff.,  MacMullen 1981, 10 ff., Versnel 1981a, 54–62, with special attention to the aspect of  marturia. </page> <page sequence="46"> 284 chapter three of the various versions of this aretalogy that have come down to us  strongly suggests a common origin. Half a century of fierce scholarly  debate has not yielded a consensus on the original nature of the sup- posed prototype, whose cradle, according to legend, stood in Mem- phis. On the one hand they display numerous non-Greek, particularly  Egyptian, elements that are obvious to any reader and denied by none.  Not only are they unequivocally present in such proclamations as: “I  invented the letters together with Hermes (= Egyptian Thot)” (K 3c),  or “I am the wife and sister of Osiris” (K 6), but also in “I divided earth  from heaven” (K 12), an act of creation that no Greek god could boast.148  Stylistically, a series of Ego-proclamations in which a god proclaims  his wondrous powers (dunameis) is un-Greek.149 Though certainly not  lacking in Greek literature (see Ch. V), expressions of omnipotence  composed of two polar qualities such as “I soothe the sea and make it  turbulent” (K 43) and “I make the navigable unnavigable whenever it  pleases me” (K 50) have their roots in the ancient Near East.150 Nor is  a parallelismus membrorum like the one at the end of the Isis aretal- ogy cited below typical of Greek literature, although both tropes are  not completely lacking.151 On the other hand, in 1949 the two major  148 I do not recognize anything really comparable in Hesiod Th. 126 ff.; 173 ff., to  which F. Solmsen, Isis among the Greeks and Romans (Cambridge Mass. 1980) 133  n. 48, refers. The fragments of an Orphic theogony in the Derveni Papyrus (M.L.  West, The Orphic Poems [Oxford 1983] 68–115; A. Laks &amp; G.W. Most [edd.], Studies  in the Derveni Papyrus [Oxford 1997]); G. Betegh, The Derveni Papyrus. Cosmology,  Theology and Interpretation [Cambridge 2004]; Th. Kouremenos, G.M. Parássoglou &amp;  K. Tsantsanoglou, The Derveni Papyrus. Edited with Introduction and Commentary  [Florence 2006]), do explain the castration of Ouranos by Kronos as the separation  of heaven and earth. But there cannot be any doubt as to the strong Near-Eastern  influences here, since the same text adds that Zeus swallowed the genitals of Ouranos  and became pregnant, which clearly goes back to the Kumarbi myth. See: W.

There are even stronger statements of this type in P.Oxy 1380 (Totti 1985 no. 20), ll.  195/6: “you, mistress of growth and destruction,” and above all ll. 175 ff.: “and you  give destruction to whom you like, and to those that are destroyed you give growth.”  Fowden 1986, 49, deems it likely that part of the invocation is a translation from an  Egyptian text. No need to recall that this type of expression is particularly character- istic of the OT, for instance in Deut. 32:39, “I kill and I make alive; I wound and I  heal.” 151 The evidence in Greek literature: TER UNUS 43 n. 11, and below in Chapter  V, pp. ##. </page> <page sequence="47">  one god: three greek experiments in oneness 285 experts on Hellenistic religion, A.D. Nock and A.J. Festugière,152 inde- pendently (and forcefully) attacked the theory of a wholesale Egyp- tian origin contending that the original text must have been written  in Greek since it contained numerous basically Greek concepts. For  reasons of space I cannot go into this discussion here and shall only  repeat my personal conviction that the aretalogies of Isis are a genu- inely Hellenistic creation—very comparable to the creation of the god  Sarapis himself—in which Greek elements have been amalgamated  with Egyptian-oriental ones.153 Let us return now to the aretalogy of Kyme. In the first line Isis pro- claims her absolute sovereignty: “I am Isis, the mistress of every land.”  Then a breathless series of some fifty Ego proclamations articulates  the goddess as the one who has created (divided) heaven and earth,  who has defined the laws of nature and who (sometimes arbitrarily)  manipulates the physical elements. After having invented agriculture  she was the one who initiated social order and civilization by introduc- ing language, justice, religion, moral codes and love. After a prelimi- nary formula of omnipotence in ll. 46/7: “What pleases me, that shall  be finished; for me everything makes way,” the hymn ends with the  unsurpassed and unsurpassable climax (ll. 55/6): I overcome Fate, Fate harkens to me. The two lines can be understood as comprehensive formulas in which  Isis’ supremacy over life and death, including sickness, perils and  disaster, is proclaimed. The first Hymn of Isidorus154 (2nd or 1st c. BC)  26–34, articulates this in exemplary soteriological formulas: 152 A.D. Nock, Gnomon 21 (1949) 221–228 = Nock 1972 II, 703–711; A.J. Fes- tugière, A propos des arétalogies d’Isis, HThR 42 (1949) 209–234 = Festugière 1972,  138–163. For a full discussion see: TER UNUS 41–44. 153 This is also the opinion of major specialists such as L.Vidman, J. Leclant,  J. Gwyn Griffiths, G. Fowden. This view is supported by an undeniable similarity with  Egyptian hymns for Isis, found at Philae and published by L.V. Zabkar, Six Hymns  to Isis in the Sanctuary of her Temple at Philae and their Theological Significance,  JEA 69 (1983) 115–137; idem, Hymns to Isis in Her Temple at Philae (Hannover- London 1988), belonging to the period of Ptolemy II Philadelphos. Very important  parallels in demotic hymns from 2nd c. BC into 2nd c. AD have now been collected in:  H. Kockelmann, Praising the Goddess: A Comparative and Annotated Re-edition of Six  Demotic Hymns and Praises Addressed to Isis (Berlin-New York 2008). 154 Found in 1935 at Medinet Madi in the Fayum.

Line 4 has literally: “in the fatal destiny of death.” This is a crucial  formula, for, like the final lines of the aretalogy of Kume, it represents  an early anticipation of what was to develop into one of Isis’ most  specific qualities during the imperial period. From the beginning of  the second century AD onwards, we find Isis glorified for having the  power to shift the boundaries that determine the measured time of  life, i.e. for being victorious over fate.155 In this she is matched by her  consort Sarapis, who proclaims:156 “for I change Fate” (lit. “change the  clothes of Fate”). This is a commentary as it were on K 55/6 quoted  above, and though certainly not an assurance of blissful immortality in  the netherworld,157 it definitely exalts Isis above the ranks of other, and  in particular the Greek gods, to whom, as we saw above, Herodotus’  words applied: “fate cannot be escaped, not even by a god.”158 As we  have seen, the only Greek god who sometimes managed to ransom a  favourite mortal from death, albeit for a limited period, was Apollo,159  155 Eg. Apul. Metam. 11.6, “you shall know that I alone have power to prolong your  life also beyond the span determined by your destiny”; cf. 11.25. 156 In a papyrus of the 3rd c. AD. Ed. pr.

See: TER UNUS 47 ff. 158 A funerary inscription (Syll.3 889) informs us that “neither by flattery, nor by  supplication, nor by tears will man ever be able to overstep the boundaries of the  predestined,” thus summarizing a stock topos in literature which ranges from early  lyric via Hellenistic poetry into epigrams, philosophical and astrological works of the  Roman period. Cf. H. Wankel, ‘Alle Menschen müssen sterben.’ Variationen eines  Topos der griechischen Literatur, Hermes 111 (1983) 129–154.

And here, as promised above, Tuche emerges again. For  Isis was readily identified with Tuche,162 though in contradistinction to  the blind and arbitrary Fortune she was a seeing and helpful one. The  combat between the two is glorified in Apuleius Metam. 11.15. All this has a consequence of crucial importance: a goddess who  triumphs over Fate and moreover boasts an extensive series of match- less miraculous feats may lay claim to the most lofty titles. So does  Isis in the first line of the aretalogy by calling herself sovereign (lit.  turannos: tyrant) of all the land, in Egyptian ears probably referring to  the land Egypt, in the Greek perception, no doubt understood as the  whole civilized world. No god or goddess has such a variety of titles  indicating unlimited power and sovereignty. The most frequent are:  Queen (basilissa), Mistress (despoina, anassa) and Lady (kuria).163 This  divine absolutism in many respects imitates the model of the worldly  autocracy so typical of Hellenistic kingship.164 prolongation of life belongs to the normal capabilities of Egyptian gods: Nock 1972  II, 705 n. 7; Gwyn Griffiths 1975, 166. 160 In fact, the final lines of aretalogy K, whose model can be dated to the third or  second century BC, are so exceptional in the context of Hellenistic religion that they  have been explained as a later addition by no less a specialist than Festugière, who,  however, recanted few years later.  161 Zeus holding the scales of destiny in Homer is a rare exception to the rule. The  Zeus who, in lyric poetry and sometimes in tragedy, is pictured as the highest lord  of destiny (as e.g. in Archil. fr. 298 W.; cf. U. Bianchi, Dios Aisa. Destino, uomini e  divinità nell’ epos, nelle teogonie e nel culto dei Greci [Rome 1953]) may practically be  identified with such notions as hoi theoi, ho theos and to theion, as we demonstrated  earlier. Even the Christian god, once beyond the boundaries of the theologians’ pro- tectorate, is powerless (or nearly so) against the Fates. See above Ch. II nn. 158 f. In  early Christian theology Christ or the Virgin Mother compete with Isis in the combat  against Fate. They share this task with the great god of Gnostic and Hermetic specula- tion, also present in magical papyri. Outside this ‘theosophy’ the notion is rare. 162 J.

And this, of course, is exactly the  briefest summary of the hyperbolic ego-proclamations in the aretalogy:  Isis can achieve what no other god is able to. She is not only great, she  is eminently and uniquely great. In other words, she is the great cham- pion in a divine competition for omnipotence.166 Now, there are also  archy as I have argued at length in TER UNUS Ch.1 and in: ‘Religious Projection: A  Hellenistic Instance’, in: L. Martin (ed.), Religious Transformations and Socio-Political  Change (Berlin-New York 1993) 25–39. 165 Xen. Ephes. 5, 13. Just as they acclaimed their own goddess with the words:  “Great is the Artemis of the Ephesians” (Acts 19.28). Cf. PGM XXIV, 1, and parallels  in Peterson 1926, 208; R. Merkelbach, Roman und Mysterium in der Antike (Munich- Berlin 1962) 111 f.; Gwyn Griffiths 1975, 238. Cf. Isis in an ancient glossary: “Isis,  that is the great hope” (P.Oxy XLV.3239). This may refer to dream interpretations,  as M. Marcovich, ZPE 29 (1978) 49, has suggested. For elpis in religious context see:  F. Cumont, Lux perpetua (Paris 1949) 401–405; Versnel 1985, 256 ff.  166 For this reason Chaniotis 2010, providing rich evidence of superlative language  (129 f.) and especially megas in cheers and acclamations (134 f.), prefers to use the  term ‘megatheism’ for this new type of religiosity, whose competitive context he  emphasizes. As, in TER UNUS pp. 234–237, I myself have amply argued for elative  ‘great’ as one of the meanings of the cheer heis in the agonistic ambiance which is the  subject of Chaniotis’ investigation, as had already been suggested before by L. Robert:  “équivalence pratique entre heis et megas” (see below on the distinction between  henotheistic and elative praises pp. 297 ff. with n. 203 and n. 212), I have nothing to  object. In this context the two Greek words simply have the same meaning and the  cheers may alternate. On the central significance of the notion ‘great’ see especially  the fourth item of the nine characteristics of henotheistic religiosity below p. 290 f.  and its more elaborated version in TER UNUS 194 ff. In later antiquity practically any  god might claim the predicate ‘great’ or ‘the greatest.’ See for instance the collected  inscriptions in: F. Kayser, Recueil des inscriptions grecques et latines (non funéraires)  d’Alexandrie impériale (Ier–IIIe s. apr. J.-C.) (Institut Français d’Archéologie Orientale,  108) (Cairo 1994).

In one of her aretalogies167 Isis claims:  “I, Isis, am the one and only sovereign of this era” (ἐγὼ τύραννος ƈἴσις  αἰῶνος μόνη). ‘Alone’, ‘without rival’, ‘unique(ly)’, that is what terms  such as Greek monos/monê, used here as elsewhere for Isis, denote  and as such they are another fitting summary of the aretalogies. The  term also brings us very close to that other Greek expression, heis  (fem. mia), Latin unus/una, with which the goddess is stereotypically  acclaimed. P.Oxy 1380 l.6 even calls her τὴν μίαν: “the One.” So it will  be helpful to go into the meanings and functions of the term monos,  as we shall do. But let us first have a glance at the more general char- acteristics of henotheistic religiosity, as collected from a broad range of  evidence concerning Hellenistic gods (very much including Isis again)  who—in opposition to the gods of classical Greece—claim a unique  and superior status associated with notions of omnipotence. 3. Nine characteristics of henotheistic religion Besides being ‘one’—whatever this may imply—the henotheistic gods  of the Hellenistic era such as Isis and Sarapis lay claim to modes of  adoration that are often radically different from the ones known for  traditional Greek religion. I have drawn a list of nine of these charac- teristics168 and will each time present only one or two illustrations. 1. Cosmopolitan pretensions and claims to universal worship are  characteristic of great Hellenistic gods, especially of Isis. For instance:  “all mortals who live on the boundless earth, Thracians, Greeks, and  Barbarians, express Your fair Name, a Name honoured among all.”169  Compare the expression “Tyrant of all land” in the Kume aretalogy. 2. If it is true that “miracle proves deity” (A.D. Nock),170 it is no  less true that, apart from a few scattered earlier instances, the first  traces of a structural advertising function of miracles in Greece can  167 Aretalogy of Cyrene, SEG 9.192. 168 They match the nine features of Euripides’ Bacchae which I analysed in TER  UNUS 164–172, and summarized in Ch. I above pp. 140 f. 169 The phrase is taken from one of the most extensive ‘topographical’ catalogues,  viz. the first Isiac hymn of Isidorus ll.14 ff. (Totti 1985 no. 21), the most extensive  being P.Oxy 1380. In her commentary Vanderlip 1972, ad loc. gives a survey of parallel  expressions. Indicative are further fixed epithets such as: polyonymos and murionymos  (“with many/innumerable names”), on which see above Chapter I, p. 55 f. 170 Or “miracle proves Saint” as a modern Greek proverb says: ǵγιος πο˃ δὲν  θαυματουργεῖ, δὲν δοξάζεται (a saint that does not work miracles, is not honoured).  </page> <page sequence="52"> 290 chapter three be  discovered in the late classical miracle records of Asklepios’ at Epi- dauros (4th c. BC), as we shall discuss in Chapter V. Significantly, the  earliest epigraphical attestation of the term aretê in the sense of ‘mirac- ulous divine intervention’ likewise dates from the fourth century BC.171  Both thus mark the dawn of the Hellenistic era. For, indeed, miracles  and epiphanies adduced as proof of the greatness of a god are typical  of certain trends in Hellenistic and later Roman religiosity.172 Isis and  Sarapis frequently exacted obedience and worship through visions or  miracles and the same is true for other gods, including the god of the  Christians. 3. Makarismoi, being expressions of beatitude due to divine bless- ings, are a common feature of Hellenistic piety. The curious confessions  of personal devotion and the concomitant beatitude as exemplarily  expressed in the eleventh book of Apuleius’ Metamorphoses have no  exact parallel in classical literature, with the exception of Euripides’  Bacchae.173 4. Although, naturally, ‘great’ is a common epithet of gods,174  emphatic acclamations of greatness are exceptional in the classical  period but abound in Hellenistic and Roman henotheistic ideology.  In these periods “the desire to be magnified” (Eur. Bacchae 209), as  we noted in the preceding section, is structurally reflected in endless  ‘magnifications’, most emphatically documented in the curious con- fession inscriptions from North Eastern Lydia and the bordering area  of Phrygia,175 dating from the second and third centuries AD. Their  frequent exordium: “Great is (the god) NN” is a ritualized acclamation.  The ritual cheering was readily put into action as a propagandistic  weapon in the struggle between pagans and Christians: “Great is the  Cf. Varro apud Aug. CD 4.22: “It is useless to know if Aesculapius is a god, if one does  not know that he heals the sick, if one does not know why you should beseech him.” 171 Syll.3 1131, whose importance has been duly valued by A. Kiefer, Aretalogische  Studien (Leipzig 1929) 21 f. and cf. Grandjean 1975, 1 ff.  172 One fine example: P.Oxy 1382 (Totti 1985 no. 13) gives the title of a book “The  Miracle (aretê) of Zeus Helios, great Sarapis, done to Syrion the Pilot.” In the preced- ing passage a miracle is described whose final words are: “This miracle is recorded  in the libraries of Mercurium. Do all of you who are present say: ‘There is one Zeus  Sarapis’.” 173 As demonstrated in the second chapter of TER UNUS and see above Ch. I,  p. 140 f. A good second is Euripides’ Ion 130 ff., and his Hippolytos. 174 B. Müller, Megas Theos (Diss. Halle 1913); M.

And the Christians never stopped yelling back.176 5. Cultic worship is the natural privilege of a god. Naturally, terms  such as ‘to serve’ (therapeuein) occur in Greek religious texts of all  periods. But the interpretation of such service as a personal submis- sion or devotion to the god, even to the effect of being ‘possessed’ or  ‘enslaved’ by the deity is definitely foreign to classical religiosity.177 In  classical literature a few passages in Euripides’ tragedy the Ion come  close to it, but here the protagonist was a temple slave, a position which  may have influenced the terminology.178 The scarce, though significant,  testimonies in actual cult have been discussed in Chapter I.179 On the  other hand, structural symptoms of personal or collective surrender  to a god, frequently in the form of sacred slavery, are rife in later  periods. A fixed technical terminology indicates both the monk-like  submission of, for example, the devotees of henotheistic Sarapis and  the sovereignty of the local god holding sway over Maeonian villages,180  176 In apocryphal Acts of Apostles the crowd generally exclaims “Great is the god  of the Christians” (or “of Peter” or “of Paul”). On these and comparable Christian   acclamations see: TWNT s.v. megas, kurios; V.H. Neufeld, The Earliest Christian  Confessions (Leiden 1963) 51–68; Wengst 1967, 123–136. Consequently, the faithful  adherent often underlines his inadequacy to describe the greatness of the god: “for it  is within the reach of gods alone and not of mortals to describe the mighty deeds of  the gods” says P.Oxy 1381, ll. 40 f., one of many examples of this expression.

For all relevant evidence and a fun- damental discussion I refer to Pleket 1981. His discussion of the term therapeia as  particularly relevant to the new type of religiosity (and perhaps derived from Oriental  prototypes) is more recently corroborated by M.-F.

On the specific piety in the Ion see also: Yunis 1988, 121–138. 179 As for instance the nympholeptos Archedamos from Thera who decorated a cave  in Attica ca. 400 BC, as well as other servants of a god. 180 On the terminology see especially P.

With the exception of a few isolated cases of ostentatious  atheism,181 the explicit refusal of worship is an unknown phenomenon  in the archaic and classical periods.182 In fact, the term ‘faith’ is of  little avail in defining archaic and classical forms of belief, since the  pantheon of the polis was as self-evident and unquestioned as the polis  and her socio-cultural codes.183 The refusal to believe in and, conse- quently, to honour a particular god—characteristics of the theomachos  (‘one who fights against god’, e.g. in Acts 5:39)184—becomes a veritable  topos in the legends of the expansion of the demanding and imperi- ous Hellenistic gods and cults. “Let the unfaithful see, let them see  gie und Philosophie 81 (2006) 321–338.

Vernant, L’individu, la mort, l’amour: Soi-même et l’autre en Grèce ancienne  (Paris 1989) 213, speaking of the inclusive cultic world of fifth century Athens. Chal- lenge directed to the gods as expressed in the myths of Tantalos, Niobe, Arachne  and Marsyas are of a decidedly different nature and allude to the sin of hybris and its  consequences rather than to lack of belief in the existence of the god. Cf. W. Nestle,  Legenden vom Tod der Gottesverächter, ARW 33 (1936) 246–269; Chr. Sourvinou- Inwood, Crime and Punishment: Tityos, Tantalos and Sisyphos in Odyssey 11, BICS  33 (1986) 37–58. 183 This has long been recognized as one of the most characteristic distinctions  between the religion of the classical polis and the confession creeds in Hellenistic  and later periods. Although J. Kinneavy, Greek Rhetorical Origins of Christian Faith  (Oxford 1988) has argued that the concept of pistis was rooted in classical rheto- ric, faith as a conscious choice and involving acts of conversion is, as was power- fully argued by Nock 1933, practically restricted to heno- and monotheistic creeds.  (On conversion see most recently: C.B. Kendall, O. Nicholson, W.D. Phillips, Jr., &amp;  M. Ragnow [edd.], Conversion to Christianity from Late Antiquity to the Modern Age:  Considering the Process in Europe, Asia, and the America [Minnesota Studies in Early  Modern History, Minneapolis 2009]). There is a significant Epidaurian inscription  (no. 3 Herzog) in which a person who mocks the iamata (‘healings’) of Asklepios is  punished for his apistia by an illness which is only cured after his ‘conversion’. Hence- forth his name will be Apistos. In no. 4 Asklepios orders an unbeliever to sacrifice a  silver sow as a “testimony of her stupidity.” This is the same terminology and ideology  as we see in the confession texts of the second centuries AD. In TAM V, 1, 179b, a  person is punished διὰ τὸ ἀπιστῖν (‘because of his disbelief ’). On the idea of pistis in  the New Testament see: Chr.D.

In these  cases the words of a Sarapis devotee apply: “for a mortal cannot con- tradict Lord Sarapis.”186 7. Any attempt to match oneself against a god is a fatal folly. Gods  are invincible and the human rebel is doomed to get the worst of it.  Characteristically, this theme, though not unknown (Tantalus, Sisy- phos etc.), was not exploited for propagandistic ends in classical times.  In that period it was deemed superfluous to substantiate the invinci- bility of a god. Conversely, the epithet ‘invincible’ (Gr. anikêtos, Lat.  invictus) became very popular in the Hellenistic and Roman periods,187  particularly in the competition between various henotheistic move- ments in imperial times: ‘Sarapis overcomes’188 is a common variant of  the acclamations ‘Great’ or ‘One (is) Sarapis’. The futility of resisting  a god and the divine triumph over atheists or sinners is a topos in the  Maeonian confession texts and related genres,189 where, as we have  185 Cf.

Theomachoi are severely punished. Both in myth and legend— but only rarely in history—we find above all blindness and madness,190  besides other kinds of illnesses and afflictions, as specific expressions  of divine wrath.191 Historically, however, the punishment of mortals  who resist (the coming of) a god does not become topical until the  Hellenistic and imperial periods.192 The forerunners, as we saw, are  discernable in some Epidaurian inscriptions praising the god Askle- pios193 and we have seen examples in the resistance legends around  Sarapis, especially the Delian aretalogy, in which the adversaries of  the god are “like statues struck by the god” and cannot utter a sound.  Saul, who was (temporarily) blinded, is structurally to be equated with  Apuleius’ Lucius who became a donkey. The punishments are explicitly  referred to as demonstrations of the powerfulness of the particular god  in question.

Great  is your victory! Great your punishing power!” 9. Public confession of guilt towards the god, either as a token of  reverence or as an instrument of propaganda or both, is not found in  our sources before the 4th century miracle records from Epidaurus.197  In this collection there are three instances of people who confess their  mistakes and subsequently are healed by the god.198 These scattered and  incidental instances are the first hesitant signs of a mentality which in  its institutionalized form and with much greater rigidity became par- ticularly typical of (though by no means restricted to) the Maeonian  confession texts, who took their name from it.199 These texts, which are  power”.

This mentality is also apparent in Jewish literature. Afflicted by a horrible  </page> <page sequence="58"> 296 chapter three essentially concise aretalogies and accordingly frequently begin with a  megas acclamation, offer reasons for their own inscription: as a rule  an offence against a god or human being; next the punishment by the  god, mostly in the form of illness or even death; the public confes- sion of the lapse, sometimes followed by an act of divine mercy, for  instance the recovery from illness; and finally the formulary recogni- tion of the divine majesty: “and from now on I praise the god” or, in  Phrygian texts, the formula of warning quoted above. 4. The nature of oneness in henotheistic religion Altogether, our enquiry into the nature of henotheistic religiosity has  revealed one central message: the god involved is superior, uniquely  great, towering above other gods. The divine superiority manifests  itself in two ways, first, as an unrestricted capacity to perform match- less miracles and creative acts—‘to do anything (s)he wants’ (so par- ticularly in the aretalogies)—and secondly, as a status of absolute and  autocratic authority over world and cosmos: ‘controlling everything  that is’. With this we are ready to turn our attention from the themes  of ‘greatness’ and ‘superiority’ to the more specific aspect of ‘one- ness’ as most patently obvious in the acclamation heis ho theos (‘one  is the god’). As I mentioned earlier, it is easier to determine what the  expression does not mean than exactly what it does. Everybody agrees  that this type of oneness cannot be simply equated with monotheism  (once more leaving aside the question whether pure monotheism ever  existed in any ancient civilization). As is immediately apparent from  various hymnic texts where Isis may be accompanied by Sarapis, by  Osiris and many other gods, the deity who is acclaimed as heis is not  (necessarily) monos in the sense of ‘the only god that exists’.200 But  by thus putting the problem, we already run the risk of distorting the  Greek term monos in applying our concept of ‘monotheism’.201 In fact,  the term monos is by no means absent from these praises and, indeed,  disease Antiochus IV promises that, if the God of the Jews will deliver him from his  pains, he will visit every inhabited place to proclaim God’s might (2 Macc. 9:17). 200 Very illustrative is also the oath of the mystes in the Isis mysteries as cited above  Ch. I n. 410. Isis may be lauded as the unique pantokrateira and within this perspec- tive she may unite the other great gods in a syncretistic ‘one and all’ construction. But  as soon as one abandons this focus the other, lesser, gods are back on the retina and  smoothly function side by side with the one and only. 201 Generally on the risks of using terms such as monotheism in the context of the  present issue Belayche 2010, 142–147, and see above p. 288 f. </page> <page sequence="59">  one god: three greek experiments in oneness 297 we already encountered it in an Isis aretalogy. What is more, it is a  common term in hymnody in general and especially current in hymns  for henotheistic gods. A glance at its functions will advance our insight  into the connotations of its twin-term heis, which, being more restricted  to an acclamative function, does not prominently occur in hymns. On  the other hand Latin unus does, and, henotheism being a phenomenon  that spread far and wide in the Roman empire, we shall from now on  indiscriminately rely on both Latin and Greek  material.202 A quick perusal of a few aretalogies, hymns and other panegyri- cal texts reveals that terms like (Greek) monos and (Lat.) unus, solus,  may have two different functions,203 although they cannot always be  clearly distinguished. The first is the function apparent in such accla- mations as: “you alone are able to do this (tu sola potes)”, or “you  alone have the power over a certain domain,” e.g. “Hail, Roma, . . . .  to you alone, o most venerable, the Moirai granted fame . . .”204 or in  the claim we already met: “I, Isis, am the one and only sovereign of  this era”. In these formulas, which belong to the most popular hymnic  devices, those qualities of the revered god that make him exceptional  are emphasized. (S)he is the only one who can do things that all others  cannot or the only one who rules over the world, which does not imply  that (s)he is the only existing god(dess). Likewise Hellenistic rulers  could claim that they were the ‘great’ or the ‘only’ king, although they  were perfectly aware of the irritating existence of plenty of competitive  colleagues around.205 In this sense, Greek monos and Latin solus have a contrastive and  elative force pertaining to quality, not an ontologically exclusive or all- embracing one. As a translation the term ‘unique(ly)’ comes closest. In  the same sense the terms are also very frequent in elative formulas for  famous mortals: generals, emperors, athletes, etc., both in Greece and  Rome. This, then, seems to be the dominant meaning that both Greek  202 In what follows I summarize my findings as expounded in the third chapter of  TER UNUS.  203 On this difference cf.

Norden 1923, 160. 205 As, in the mid-second century B.C., the Graeco-Bactrian king Euthydemos was  designated in an epigram (SEG 54.1596), which possibly reflects acclamations such as  ‘the greatest of all kings.’ See: G. Rougemont, Dédicace d’Héliodotos à Hestia pour le  salut d’Euthydème et de Démétrios, JdS (2004), 333–337, as mentioned by Chaniotis  2010, 130.  </page> <page sequence="60"> 298 chapter three heis or monos and Latin unus or solus have in the hundreds of accla- mations and invocations, most emphatically in the heis theos cheers.206  One of the arguments for this specific meaning is that acclamations  with heis, monos and prôtos, and various combinations of these terms  are specifically frequent in the agonistic sphere.207 Very popular was  εἷς ἀπ’ αἰῶνος or πρῶτος καὶ μόνος ἀπ’ αἰῶνος, which according to  Tertullian, De spect. 25, was the usual cheer at games and contests.208  Most probably this means something like “the uniquely first since all  eternity” or more colloquially: “we have never seen such a miraculous  star.” Similar acclamations existed in Latin.209 Less obvious is the intended meaning of the notoriously enigmatic  bi-, tri-, and quadripartite acclamations (all from the second and third  centuries AD) such as: heis Zeus Serapis, or heis Zeus Serapis Asklepios  Soter, or heis Zeus Mitras Helios. Peterson has devoted a thorough  investigation to the entire complex. He postulated a Chaldaean astro- logical origin, which came into its own in later solar theology.210 Sup- 206 Wengst 1967, 128 ff. gives the Christian evidence for heis and monos as indi- cations for the unicity of God as god and especially as creator. It is a “Terminus  Technicus der frühchristlichen Heidenmission” and no doubt originated as an anti- acclamation against the pre-existent pagan heis theos acclamations. There is also a  good brief survey of the pagan evidence. However, even in the NT the terms offer no  warrant of a pure monotheism. See above n. 8 and n. 144. 207 Collected and discussed by M.N. Tod, Greek Record-keeping and Record-break- ing, CQ 43 (1949) 106–112, espec. 111 f. More recently J.H.

Robert, Études épigraphiques et  philologiques (Paris 1938) 108–111, who several times returns to these acclamations:  Hellenica X, 61; XIII, 216; Les épigrammes satiriques de Lucillius sur les athlètes: paro- die et réalités, in: L’épigramme grecque (Entretiens Hardt XIV [Genéve 1967]) 275 f. 209 S.

On the contrary, he claims, they are acclamations empha- sizing the exceptional character and greatness of the god or gods  invoked. In other words, just as single heis theos, they represent the  elative, not the unifying force of the word heis.212 On the other hand, it  is hard to avoid the impression that with the extension of the formula  to several names of gods the unifying-henotheistic element gradually  increased at the cost of the acclamatory-elative component. After all,  the various gods mentioned in these formulas did undergo a rapid and  profound process of syncretism in late antiquity. However, the differ- ence is not always easy to trace and perhaps it is not such a good idea  to expect—and hence search for—precise semantic distinctions. In this connection we should bear in mind that acclamations typi- cally belong to what in sociolinguistics is called ‘phatic’ or ‘expressive’  language, a form of communication which, in opposition to descriptive  expression, does not normally bear a precise and well-defined mean- ing. What did Israelites and Greeks and Romans mean when they  wished that their kings and emperors ‘may live for ever or in eternity,  as Caracalla (SEG 48.1961 f., 1964 f.)’, or what the Chinese, with their  slogan—hardly an offspring from a Mediterranean tradition—‘May  Chairman Mao live for ever’? The fact that heis may refer either to  hierarchy (‘the first’, ‘unique’) or to ontology (‘the only one that is’ or  ‘the one that is all’) makes the term eminently liable to manipulation  and ambiguous application. We should at least consider the possibility  that these cheers did not have any precise ‘intended meaning’ at all,  but expressed only a vague notion of magnification. It is only when  the shouter comes to reflect on what he is shouting—but how many  211 For instance a graffito adduced by Peterson 230: “one is Zeus Sarapis, great is  Isis the Lady” (εἷς Ɖεɞς ƕάραπις, μεγάλη ἡ Ȩσις ἡ κυρία), which suffices to show how  the term heis defies any narrow monolithic ‘translation’. “Es geht hier nicht um eine  begriffliche Definition, sondern um eine Hoheitsaussage” (ibid. p. 132). See now also  Belayche 2010. 212 L. Robert, Opera minora selecta (Amsterdam 1969) I 427 n. 101, in this connec- tion speaks of “le caractère de superlatif de l’acclamation heis théos.” With Peterson he  contests Cumont’s interpretation ‘dieu unique’. It is rather ‘dieu suprême’ and there  is an “équivalence pratique entre heis et megas.” As opposed to French ‘unique’, the  English word ‘unique’ like Dutch ‘enig’ combines the two notions that can be distin- guished as the superlative and the ‘exclusive’. The same is true of the Latin unicus. On  which see TER UNUS pp. 235, 249. </page> <page sequence="62"> 300 chapter three ever did (or do)?—that the construction of distinct (and divergent)  meanings can commence. This brings us to the second of the two different functions announced  above. An inscription from Capua hails Isis as: te tibi una quae es  omnia (‘you who alone art all’).213 If we translate Latin unus/una into  its Greek equivalent heis/mia, this expression closely resembles the  one introduced by Xenophanes as discussed in the first section of this  chapter, and even more its later offspring in the all-embracing Stoic  and Neo-Platonic claims that their god was ‘one and all’ (Gr. ἓν καὶ  πᾶν, Lat. solus omnia). But if we now ask if this similarity implies  equality, the answer must be negative, at least for the henotheistic the- ology of the Hellenistic period. For ‘one and all’ here appears to have  a very special frame of reference, as expressed in an exemplary way in  a hymn of Isidorus 1.23 where it is said: “that you alone (mounê) are  all other goddesses who are named by the nations.” This is as close as Hellenistic henotheism ever got to monotheism.  Isis is here represented as alone embodying all the other goddesses.  Further elaborations include long geographical lists of all the supe- rior gods of each region who are there invoked by their local names  but who are now unmasked as just another representation of the one  and only henotheistic god.214 This is a typical product of theological  reflection. However, that theological reflection is not always the most  reliable refuge in religious matters becomes apparent from the inevi- table limitations inherent in this particular trope. First, henotheism is  fatally gender-specific: the many different representations of Isis are  inevitably all female. This irritating obstacle on the road to real mono- theism is revealingly illustrated by the creative solution contrived by a  hymnodist who could not choose between Isis and Sarapis: “You are  two, but you are called many among the nations. In fact, life knows  you alone (μόνους) as gods.”215 Furthermore, this construction by no  213 CIL X, 3800; ILS 4362; SIRIS 502. Cf. V. Tran Tam Tinh, Le culte des divinités  orientales en Campanie (Leiden 1972) 77 and 199–234; Grandjean 1975, 69 ff.  214 Hence her inclusive Greek epithet ‘Myrionyma’ (‘with innumerable names’) is  so stereotyped that it occurs both in literary texts (for instance in the Life of Aesopus  5 = Totti 1985, no. 18) and even in Latin inscriptions (CIL III, 882 and 4017; SIRIS  656; CIL V, 5080, CIL XIII, 3461; ILS 4376a; SIRIS 749). Turcan 1989 entitles his  chapter on the goddess: ‘Isis Myrionyme.’ Cf. above n. 169 and Ch. I n. 122. For an  exhaustive collection of epithets in demotic hymns to Isis see: H. Kockelmann o.c.

It is only the great national goddesses that are identified with Isis.  Apparently the message is: Isis is the greatest goddess; consequently  every other great goddess can only be an alias of this central deity.  Those readers, finally, who find it hard to come to terms with the  inevitable inconsistencies implied in the variety of connotations of the  four letter word heis, may find some solace in Walt Whitman’s famous  lines in his Song to myself, 51: “Do I contradict myself? Very well then  I contradict myself (I am large, I contain multitudes).” 5. Questions of origin Much of what has been demonstrated in this section is strongly remi- niscent of creeds and cultic practices of Egypt and the ancient Near  East. Time and again characteristic elements of aretalogies could be  traced back to non-Greek models216 and there is not one of the nine  characteristics listed above that could not be readily typified as a struc- tural phenomenon of Near Eastern religiosity rather than of archaic  and classical Greek religion. Accordingly, most of them do not come  well into view before the Hellenistic era, to reach their bloom only in  Imperial times, especially in the 2nd/3d centuries AD. The same is true  for the acclamation heis. There is only one pre-hellenistic testimony  of this acclamation, viz. in a Gurob papyrus,217 which has preserved  a fragment of what may have been an Orphic book. It contains an  216 Not only Egyptian ones: A.

So, as far as we can see, Dio- nysos was the first god to be hailed with an acclamation that became  the most characteristic identification of the great gods of later times.  The problem, however, is that we have no idea about the cultural iden- tity of the acclamation, although the text itself betrays unmistakably  Orphic features. Did it originate in Greece or with a local cult group  in Egypt, influenced by Egyptian conceptions? In this context it may  be of interest that the first time that we see the acclamation addressed  to a human—albeit semi-deified—person is in the acclamation “one  like Pythios (Apollo),” addressed to the emperor Nero (Cass. Dio 61,  20, 5; cf. 63, 20, 5).219 The term heis as an elative praise is not attested in classical Greece,  but monos and prôtos kai monos were so ubiquitous that they are cher- ished material for puns in the Attic comedy and elsewhere.220 Alto- gether, I consider it most likely that the acclamation heis originated  as a translation of the Egyptian word for ‘one’ and that there was a  cross-fertilization with an ideology that was already in statu nascendi  elsewhere in the Hellenistic Mediterraneum. The expressions we have  seen earlier—Isis as τὴν μίαν (the one) or as “you who alone (μούνη)  are all other goddesses who are named by the nations,” while Apuleius  Metam. 11.4 speaks of her nomen unicum—may well betray the Egyp- tian Isis-name Thiouis ‘the one’.221 However, all this does not alter  the fact that it is easier, more rewarding and more relevant to draw  218 That it is a password may be inferred from the word immediately following the  acclamation: εἷς ∆ιόνυσος σύμβολα. 219 In TER UNUS I wondered: “Did Nero’s special Alexandrian ‘claqueurs’ (Suet.  Nero 20) introduce this agonistic acclamation from Egypt?” However, the recent find  of very specific and interesting Delphic acclamations εἷς Ǹπόλλων Ɠύθιος in graffiti of  Pythian victors (late 2nd and 3d c. AD), favours a more direct relationship with the  Pythian games. See: F. Queyrel, Inscriptions et scènes figurées peintes sur le mur de  fond du xyste de Delphes, BCH 125 (2001), 333–387, and the discussion in Chaniotis  2010, 126 f. with the main texts in n. 60. One may wonder whether there is a connec- tion with the speculations of Ammonios and Plutarch (Plut. De E Delph. espec. 393B;  388F) on the Delphic E and the Apollonian name Ièios denoting εἷς καὶ μόνος. See:  R.

In fact, the only way to discover the meaning, or rather the   implications and connotations, of the word heis is by adducing a col- lection of henotheistic features. And it is exactly by this course of action that we may justify the pres- ence of this section in a chapter on Greek experiments in oneness. If the  semantic roots of the verbal element heis must be sought in non-Greek  religions, this does not mean that Greek culture has not contributed to  the creation of both the phenomenological characteristics of, and the  religious mentality inherent in the notion of henotheism, as we analy- sed them in the present section. One may for instance call to mind the  popularity of the classical Greek monos acclamations and, more impor- tant, the fact that the earliest relevant henotheistic testimonies have all  come to us in Greek texts whose Sitz im Leben can be traced back to  Greek speaking areas. The aretalogies that we discussed display genuine  Greek tropes and ideas side by side with, for instance, Egyptian ones.  More generally, a culture’s readiness to accommodate foreign incen- tives is not a passive but an active drive which may be credited to its  own active involvement in cultural change and  development. Far more important, however, is that, as we have observed in our first  chapter, unmistakable signs of a new henotheistic religiosity became  apparent elsewhere in Greece (e.g. the Asclepius cult at Epidauros)  but above all in Athens from the late fifth century onwards. New gods  were introduced and claimed a more personal devotion and exclusive  type of worship then the old gods ever enjoyed. As a matter of fact  these new creeds displayed a type of religiosity that closely resembles  and in fact forms a prelude to the henotheistic trends of the Hellenistic  and Imperial periods, as we saw in Chapter I pp. 138–140. 6. Concluding remarks What, then, is the overall message of our source material? This: that  the lauded god is greater, more powerful than, hence absolutely supe- rior to all other gods. In fact, henotheistic deities are competing for  omnipotence.222 In this respect (and many other) they have adopted  222 It is exactly the elements of competition in henotheistic ideology and their polit- ical and social background that are in the centre of interest in the recent studies of  Belayche 2010 and especially of Chaniotis 2010. </page> <page sequence="66"> 304 chapter three traits of Hellenistic kingship and accordingly manifest themselves as  autocratic rulers to whom a mortal could only respond with an attitude  of humble subservience or even slavery. This went hand in hand with  the appearance of new forms of a more intense and personal relation- ship between god and man, sometimes accompanied by experiences  and expressions of sin, guilt, confession, and mercy. In this context in  particular we encounter claims that the god is ‘great’, indeed greater  than other gods. (S)he is ‘unique’ and outshines all other deities by  her/his greatness. Though most of the elements analysed above can already be found  sporadically in earlier periods, their amalgamation into one structural  complex is specifically characteristic of the religious mentality that we  have been discussing. Hymns, including those of the archaic and clas- sical periods of Greece, are praises of a god. By definition they concen- trate on one particular deity and magnify his greatness. Hence we have  called them henotheistic moments in an otherwise polytheistic context.  However, even allowing for its precursors in fourth-century Greece,  henotheism never developed into a structural religious, let alone cul- tic, phenomenon before the Hellenistic period. Mythically speaking,  Zeus was superior to all other Greek gods, as is most emphatically  expressed in the unique aretalogical formula of omnipotence at the  beginning of Hesiod’s Works and Days.223 However, this had no cultic  consequences whatever. In classical times, outside the sphere of philo- sophical monotheism,224 a permanent exclusive devotion to one god  was confined to small cult groups and religious devotees in the margin  of society. The dogmatic elevation of one god above all others and the  concomitant affective exclusion of other gods are features typical of  Hellenistic and later religiosity. All this is expressed in the acclamation  heis (ho) theos. 5. Conclusion Three experiments in oneness. The first two represent cosmologies ‘to  live by’225 and can be understood as explanatory devices, an individual  one to define why things—world, kosmos, God—are as they are, and  223 Cf. above p. 231 and below p. 422. 224 C.

These ‘One Gods’, being products  of at least speculative, at times intellectual, and at best philosophi- cal reflection, are more or less abstract principles that transcend both  men and traditional gods. They establish a conceptual unity, but a  unity that is not the sum of the plurality of the normal gods. In both  experiments the One and the Many operate on different levels and  have different tasks, preserving a complementary co-existence. After  all, insight into the divine arche of the kosmos or into the supernatural  strand of causation does not neutralize human anxiety and concern  nor reduce the desire to positively influence and control the future. To  explain the inexorable, divinity must be depersonalized: both the One  god and ‘the gods’ are nameless and not conceived as an approachable  personal authority. If at all receiving worship in terms of libation and  prayer, as did the Xenophanean One god, this was a formal expres- sion of detached deference and submission, not being launched as a  personal appeal in situations of disaster. ‘The gods’ as a comprehensive  notion were, with few exceptions, devoid of cult. The traditional per- sonal gods, on the other hand, derived their very identity from their  cultic existence, including sacrifice and prayer, and from iconography  and myth. Though belonging to the same polythetic class of ‘gods’ the  One and the Many are separate categories. In this respect they are  incomparable, hence do not compete. Contrarily, the third experiment concerns One god who shares all  characteristics with the traditional gods, including name, cult and  myth. In fact (s)he is a traditional god, but one who has risen to  such sublime eminence, that (s)he becomes different. The difference  between this One and the Many, however, is not one in quality, but in  status. In origin not being the product of intellectual speculation, this  One god is the focus of appeal and supplication. In order to mollify the  inexorable, it must be personalized. Accordingly, the Hellenistic One  God is personal and very much a projection of a social/political real- ity: the king. The human worshipper is, first and foremost, dependent,  dependence being another manner of creating sense out of chaos.226 In  this conception, then, all gods belong to one and the same category.  226 Burkert 1996a, 84, quoting D. Morris, The Naked Ape: A Zoologist’s Study of the  Human Animal (New York 1967) 180: “fundamental biological tendency . . . to submit  ourselves to an all-powerful, dominant member of the group.” Cf. the central role of  dependency in expressions of private piety in Chapter I, pp. 128 f.  </page> <page sequence="68"> 306 chapter three Not only are they comparable, they are continuously being compared  and constantly involved in a competition for pride of place. Instead of  One as opposed to the Many, there are several competing Ones among  the Many. An occasional syncretistic identification of the Many with  the One is the ultimate venture in the Hellenistic quest for unity in  diversity. None of the three Ones discussed in this chapter ousted or absorbed  the Many. The first two, being so different, did not need to endeavour  to, the third One, though not averse, did not succeed. One may well  wonder if any god ever succeeds.227 The above analysis is an attempt  at historical interpretation, not a dogmatic treatise. The three experi- ments are no impenetrable isolated systems and especially in religion  borders are there to be crossed. One may try to personalize the anony- mous First Principle by calling it Zeus, as we have seen. Tyche expe- rienced a similar manipulation. As the fearsome impersonal principle  of arbitrariness she was ‘overcome’ by Isis; as the powerful personified  protector of good Fortune she was identified with the Egyptian god- dess. Tyche never lost her ambiguous position on the brink between  principle and person. In late antiquity, God and Christ were wor- shipped in hymns that extolled their qualities to such a degree that  these Ones risked being reduced to a “Denk-, Seh-, Hör-, und Intelli- genzmonstrum,” as Feyerabend characterized the Xenophanean god. It  is as if these ‘experiments with experiments’ go just one bridge too far  by trying to unite what is basically incompatible. Ask our  theological  colleagues in the Department of Philosophy of Religion: they live on  this aporia. 227 Fortunately quite a few modern scholars in various fields have voiced their con- viction that monotheism and polytheism are never mutually exclusive, least of all in  antique cultures.

Luhmann228 one of the major functions of religion is  the ‘reduction of complexity’ as a strategy to create sense in the inter- actions of a system with its environment. This may well be true. How- ever, in their scholarly attempt to ‘reduce the complexity’ of their own  object of study many sociologists of religion no less than specialists  of Greek religion229 seem to hold the view that pre-modern societies  structurally share a penchant for an all-encompassing unity of mean- ing230 and they tend to deny premodern religions the pluralism that,  on the face of it, is so characteristic of polytheism.231 I hope to have  shown that this idea needs some qualification. We ended our second chapter on the polyinterpretability of divine  action with an apposite quotation of Feyerabend. Let us end the pres- ent chapter on the compatibility of the two very diverse images of  deity under discussion, the many and the one, with an equally apposite  passage of another scholar from a field outside our classical domain:232 The diversity of life’s conditions and—connected with it—the shifts in  the respective affective shades of our thinking entail that there is not one  single image of god: there are several, even if, when viewed in a more  abstract perspective, they appear to be incompatible. 228 The Function of Religion (Frankfurt 1977).  229 Above n. 2.
