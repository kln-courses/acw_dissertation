<plain_text><page sequence="1">EMPIRICAL IDEALISM IN OUTLINE TWO facts appear to me fundamental when I reflect upon my experience of life and the world. The first is that external stimuli continue to act on my organism and to evoke a succession of motor responses. The second is that I understand or interpret these stimuli by giving them place as objects or events in the more or less per manent system I regard as the world. Not my world, but the world. These two facts on which as twin pillars my experience seems to rest are brought home to me by every act of perception. When I was writing one of the above sentences my attention was momentarily diverted by a wagon pass ing along the street beneath my study window. In this case an auditory stimulus, a continuous creaking sound I would describe it in retrospect, induced a readjustment of the apparatus of visual fixation and regard, i. e. drew my gaze away from the paper to the window and the street outside. Now such motor readjustment, called forth by the object of perception, is, in the degree to which it is conscious at all, a virtual acknowledgment of the external existence of this object as a particular source of present stimulation. But the character which perceiving intel ligence recognizes the object to possess is resolvable into a complex of properties and relations. And the properties and relations which give an object its distinctive character</page><page sequence="2">46 THE MONIST serve (because they are general) to link it with other kinds and types of objects in an orderly, enduring, and meaning ful, world. To perceive the object in my illustration as a loaded coal-wagon is to give it significant place in the winter life of this city and to relate it intelligibly to the household economy and organized industry in the nation and throughout the world. Now the two facts in question which I regard as basic to human experience may appropriately be taken as the starting-point of philosophical enquiry. Indeed each one has, of itself and apart from any further inferences to be drawn from it, important philosophical significance. The first fact is the standing refutation of subjective idealism, of all forms of 'mentalism.' Objects demonstrate the in dependence of their existence by the control they exercise over our action, both as external sources of stimulation and as conditions which limit our bodily movements. The second of the two facts stands as an equally conclusive refutation of that naive materialism which admits no in fluence but that of physical impact, no relation except that of the external determination of one object or event by other ones contiguous to it in space and time. Unless ob jects sustain, besides this, some relation which integrates them into a coherent system, i. e. have some intrinsic order and unity, they cannot form parts of an intelligible world. For the distinctive and permanent characters which we recognize objects to possess are inseparable from their position and relations in the organized world of intelligible meaning. It would be a mistake, however, to infer from this latter fact (that intelligence is a reaction not to an ex ternal stimulus merely, but to the world in its intelligible unity and to external objects as constituents of this unity) that the objective world is constituted by thought. Instead,</page><page sequence="3">EMPIRICAL IDEALISM IN OUTLINE 47 a correct inference would be that because the world proves to be intelligible it must have an intrinsic order and unity which it would not have if its parts were determined mere ly by physical antecedence and consequence. Its parts must be such as to imply the intrinsic character, the essential nature, of the whole. Pursuing this line of thought, we might be led on to a further inference which would be unwarranted. This would be to conclude that because the existing world has intel ligible unity, it has teleological unity as well, in the sense that all its parts are related as means to some end we judge good. The requirements of intelligible order and system might be satisfied, as far as I can see, by some space-time-mass relationship which correlates all parts in terms of mathematical ratio and function. The fact seems to be that while our intelligence is bound to assume that the world possesses some kind of order and unity, we are warranted in ascribing to it only such kind and degree of unity as it proves on empirical investigation to have. Two activities or responses of everyday experience bring us into contact with the real world and give us in formation as to its character, viz. action, and appreciation. The difference between them is not that action consists in bodily movement while appreciation is a mental or intel lectual activity. Both are psycho-physical responses; they are expressions of intelligence and at the same time in volve bodily movement. Action is the attempt of individual intelligence through the agency of bodily movement to bring about some change in the physical relationship of objects within its sphere of influence. Such change may be brought about by bodily movements which merely alter the location of the agent relative to surrounding objects; or the agent may, through movements of his own, initiate a series of changes in his physical environment. Appr cia</page><page sequence="4">48 THE MONIST tion is an effort to discover relations which exist among objects in virtue of their intrinsic character, relations which give them meaning and value. These relations individual intelligence seeks to realize through the instrumentality of motor responses confined to the body of the agent and hence more completely under his control, such as aesthetic ap preciation, articulate speech, and incipient manipulation. Of course these two responses, action and appreciation, are not separate powers or faculties which operate in inde pendence of each other. We are prompted to act, and the course of our action is in a general way predetermined, by the attractiveness of the ideal object which appeals to us as desirable. And appreciation not merely discerns mean ing and realizes values which exist; it imagines pos sible meanings and values which require to be verified by action and experiment. No, the distinction between action and appreciation is a distinction of function which (as we have seen) is rooted deep in the underlying conditions of human experience. Action is concerned with the sequence of bodily movements which must be made, or of physical changes which must be effected, if the characteristic quali ties of objects are to become available for our own experi ence and enjoyment. Appreciation, on the other hand, is preoccupied with the meaning and value objects are found to possess when realized by effortful action. Action per se is not interested in the end or goal for itself but in the steps which must be taken to realize it. As action its primary concern is with bodily movements and physical intermediaries, with material agencies and mechanical instruments. It cares nothing for the intrinsic nature of any motor response or physical process it employs, however; it is only interested in the tendency of such a chain of physical intermediaries to produce a specific result -whether, that is to say, it is, directly or indirectly, a step</page><page sequence="5">EMPIRICAL IDEALISM IN OUTLINE 49 toward the projected terminus. In other words, action is concerned with motor responses and physical events only in their order of succession, their sequence of occurrence. Its competence is measured by its ability to make that se quence of bodily movements or to initiate that series of physical changes which will lead most directly and efficaci ously to the chosen end, the realization or appreciation or enjoyment of the qualities of the selected object. Action and the results of action are one principal source of information in regard to the nature of the exist ing world. Physical science undertakes the investigation of the real world as it reveals itself to human action and the observation which accompanies action, and its con clusions summarize in systematic form the knowledge to be gained from this source. Its method is that of reflec tion on the observed results of action an4 the verification by detailed experiment of the hypotheses suggested by these observations. Its interest, of course, is not in a particular practical result to be gained by initiating a series of physical changes but in discovering such invariable sequences of physical changes as constantly occur. It has, by the aid of an elaborate technique of experimentation, been successful in discovering many such uniformities of external determination among physical events-laws of na ture, we call them. Methods of exact measurement have brought to light relations of quantitative equivalence and mathematical ratio among different event-sequences. These uniformities give coherence and regularity to the external world; they show it to be in truth an order of physical events. The second class of responses above-mentioned, those of appreciation, are, as we have seen, also psycho-physical activities, and concern themselves not with physical exist ence, but with the intrinsic meaning and value of real ob</page><page sequence="6">50 THE MONIST jects. Now the value which is thus discovered and verified inheres in those qualitative differences in the real world which natural science ignores. The object as appreciated is always a complex or pattern of diverse but inter-related qualities. Are any uniformities of relation discoverable among objects in this their aspect of value which organize them into a system whose objective reality can be empir ically verified? The answer is affirmative. Insofar as it possesses real value an object as a complex or pattern of diverse qualities is so related to an inclusive system of similar objects as to acquire various possibilities of func tional contribution to the developing unity of such system. The various potencies of functional contribution with which objects are endowed are brought to light by the three responses of appreciation above-mentioned which, while they are in a sense co-ordinate, at the same time suggest three stages in the progressive realization of the value of the actual world: appreciative understanding, practical invention, and aesthetic perception. These appre ciative responses involve on the motor side articulate speech, practical manipulation and contrivance, sensory adjustment and emotional expression. A. Appreciative Understanding. The diverse qualities which give each object its distinctive character are present in varying degrees and combinations in other classes and kinds of objects and serve to link it with them in a co herent system which is implied as the meaning or signifi cance of every particular part or member. In this system, the general types or classes of objects reflect the continu ing interests and purposes of intelligent human life. These interests are at first comparatively limited and transient, and give rise to interpretations correspondingly subjective and anthropomorphic. But the controlling interests be come more comprehensive and enduring until they finally</page><page sequence="7">EMPIRICAL IDEALISM IN OUTLINE 51 become that of the description and correlation of all objects for the purpose of communication and contemplation. As these latter motives become dominant they direct attention to the nature of the objects themselves rather than their uses, thus leading to interpretations increasingly objective. Among such are the physico-mathematical interpretation of physical science originally formulated in the interests of action, the genetic or evolutionary interpretation in terms of development and emergence, the ethical interpretation in terms of personal communication and association. But in all these interpretations the identities or uniformities discovered are, from the standpoint of appreciative under standing, identities in difference, uniformities which cor relate objects of different character into an organized system. B. Practical Invention. When the distinctive char acter of each object is thus understood, it reveals possibili ties of development and transformation (through a re organization of its constituent qualities in connection with the qualities of other objects) in virtue of which it can make new contributions to the unity of the whole. Thus physical materials and forces, vital energies and psycho physical tendencies, prove instrumental to the rational uses of mankind. These uses are at first limited, exclusive, temporary. They become more enduring and inclusive until they become that of constructive achievement : the co operative conquest and control of existing nature. C. Aesthetic Perception. All objects in virtue of the organization and harmony of their own intrinsic qualities are capable of reflecting or expressing in some degree the larger whole of which they are parts. Such intimations and revelations to aroused perception, imagination and emotion are at first sought for the pleasure they give or for some ulterior advantage they gain. But as through</page><page sequence="8">52 THE MONIST the exercise of these responses the objective experiences become more adequate and significant they are sought for the reconciling sense they afford of the unity of all values and of the rational life in which they are realized. It follows that the discovery and realization of the system of values implies or involves the community of personal intelligence. The various possibilities of func tional contribution to one unfolding system which existing objects possess are realized by a society of intercommuni cating individuals, each selecting those which appeal to his own nature and capacities and participating by com munication in those realized by others. The joint realiza tion of objective values associates all individuals engaged by common insight and mutual understanding, by co operative endeavor and imaginative sympathy. Now the objective values thus discovered first appear as ideal possibilities. The responses of appreciation always involve bodily reactions, it is true. But in the first formu lation or envisagement of values the motor reactions are confined to the body of the agent and so (within the limits set by hereditary structure and habit) within his control. They consist, of course, of implicit responses of language, motor manipulation and perceptual readjustment. The verification or social realization of these values depends, however, upon the extension of these responses into the outer world in the form of overt action which has to encounter the limits set by the external environment. Consequent upon the threefold division of the responses of appreciation such action which is genuinely experimental takes the form of consecutive discussion, practical contriv ance and invention, or artistic creation. Many of these possibilities of real value have been explored and verified by mankind in the history of social culture. Values thus discovered have been objectively ex</page><page sequence="9">EMPIRICAL IDEALISM IN OUTLINE 53 pressed and embodied in political procedures and institu tions, scientific and literary writings, works of fine art, and industrial methods and appliances. These values already discovered by social intelligence may be realized by the human individual through partici pation in the organized, institutional life of society. Such participation is effected through the bodily agencies or media of inter-communication already referred to: articu late speech, practical invention, and aesthetic-emotional ex pression. Habits of speech, of social adjustment and address, of mechanical control and industrial skill, of perceptual synthesis and emotional resonance, enable the individual to appropriate the cultural achievements of his fellows. Through intercommunication mediated by these agencies the individual is enabled to share in the significant experiences of humanity, their insights into the nature and order of the world, their adaptation of existing materials and forces to rational uses, and their intuitive perceptions of fundamental harmony. Any original contribution on the part of the individual to the discovery and realization of the values of the world depends upon his own initiative and enterprise. He must take the risk and assume the responsibility of acting upon those potencies of coherent meaning, of teleological order, of organic fitness, of unfolding harmony, in the world of nature and of man, which have appealed to his selective intelligence as genuine and supremely valuable. And while the possibilities which he envisages may not be borne out or confirmed by the results of action, he cannot entirely fail. For his experiment, so far as it is intelligently con ceived and capably executed, cannot fail to be illuminating and profitable to himself and others-by proving that some apparently genuine possibilities are blind alleys and sug gesting other more promising paths to fulfilment. Besides,</page><page sequence="10">54 THE MONIST such effort will identify him more effectually than any thing else could do with the co-operative endeavor carried forward by the leading spirits of humanity to explore and verify the real meaning and enduring significance of man's experience and his world. To return then to the original question of the kind of order and unity possessed by the actual world. Empirical fact when consulted indicates the presence of two types of order in the world, mechanical and teleological. On the one side is the physical system, the order of events in space-time, of mass-points or force-centres whose changes show uniformity of external determination. On the other side is the objective system of values, the system of significant objects which by virtue of differences in in trinsic character possess coherence of meaning, possibil ities of adaptation and development, and expressive har monies. Each system seems complete in itself, and ex clusive of the other. Is this dualism final and insurmount able? Is the world divided against itself into two oppos ing kingdoms? , Certainly no monistic interpretation which does not take cognizance of, and build upon, the facts indicative of duality in nature and in man, deserves serious considera tion. If the real world possesses any ultimate unity it must be a unity which maintains itself in, and realizes itself through, opposition. And indeed what appears as radical opposition may well prove on further examination to be the essential condition of functional interdependence. That this is true of mechanism and teleology, existence and value, is suggested by the evolution of social culture. The externality of physical nature and this alone gives human individuals a common field for the exercise of their intel ligence in the organization of co-operative life. The mechanical regularity of physical processes is the indis</page><page sequence="11">EMPIRICAL IDEALISM IN OUTLINE 55 pensable condition of their adaptation to the rational uses of intelligence. These are facts which idealists should take notice of. On the other hand, it is only through and by means of associated human intelligence that the se quences of physical process acquire rational significance and become the media or symbols for expressing and com municating the permanent meanings and enduring values discovered by human intelligence in its natural and social environment. This is a fact which the behaviorist should not forget. As we have seen, the objective system of values is an organized system of ends through whose discovery and appreciation the community of personal intelligence is realized. Now are we to think of this community of in telligence as limited to man in whom the forces of uni versal evolution may be supposed to have come to self consciousness? Or has it a wider scope and a more per manent existence than it could possibly have if limited to the life of the human species on this planet? Are we justified in regarding the existence of a universal or cosmic intelligence as a necessary implication of the objective system of values? Two arguments set forth more fully elsewhere1 appeal to me as relevant and (as far as may be) convincing. In the first place, we do not hesitate to agree with the natural scientist that the order of physical events which is not a fact of direct experience but an inference based upon the facts of common perception, did exist throughout the whole course of evolution as the real framework within which the evolutionary process in all its phases, of value as well as of physical occurrence, took place. But the attributes of value are features of exist ence no less important and actual than its physical prop erties. And they require for their explanation, as we 1 Cf. H. W. Wright, "Does the Objective System of Values Imply a Cosmic Intelligence ?" International Journal of Ethics, April, 1928, pp. 284 ff.</page><page sequence="12">56 THE MONIST acknowledge, the community of intelligence. The latter is therefore on an equal footing with the order of physical events : both may with equal right claim to be the truth of the world of existing fact. But why then suppose that the earlier stages of evolution before men appeared pro ceeded within the space-time frame exclusively, and not within the organizing, associating unity of intelligence as well? Suppose it to be objected that consistently with evolu tion we must suppose intelligence to have been latent or potential in the world until it emerged in the human (or other) species. The answer will bring out our second argument which turns upon the origin of the system of values. In the case of the physical system we account for its beginnings in terms of the same uniformities that govern its present changes-processes of redistribution of matter and motion. The real existence of the system of values means the existence of another type of relation, the relation between particular objects and events and the or ganizing unity or whole which includes them by virtue of their intrinsic adaptability and their distinctive possibilities of functional contribution. Now in what sense can this organizing unity exist, potentially it may be, but neverthe less really and effectively? Can its existence be under stood except as an anticipatory selection of objects, of ex isting materials and agencies, on the basis of their intrinsic character and fitness? Such selection may mean simply the immanent order of nature or, more definitely, the effective ordering which proceeds in the natural world. Only, in so far as it involves anything that can be fairly understood as an anticipatory selection, it implies the in fluence at all stages of an inclusive or ordering intelligence. Are we to think of the cosmic intelligence as including within the scope of its experience all the values of exist</page><page sequence="13">EMPIRICAL IDEALISM IN OUTLINE 57 ence completely realized? No, my answer would be, such intelligence may be thought of as comprehending and con serving all values which have been thus realized in the course of evolution, and guaranteeing that the further possibilities of value resident in the world are real possi bilities. Whether we can gain further knowledge of the char acter and content of the Universal Mind or Will depends upon whether religion is what it pretends to be, an inde pendent source of experience and information in this field. It is not my purpose to discuss the validity of this claim but merely to point out how the religious response relates itself to the problems we have been discussing. Religion proposes the present realization of the objective system of values in its entirety (as thus far developed) through com munion or communication with the Cosmic or Universal Intelligence. The only available means of such communi cation are the three psycho-physical agencies referred to above: articulate speech, practical invention and aesthetic perception and expression. Employed as means of realiz ing the universal system of values through 'communion with God/ they take the form of the three distinctively religious responses of prayer, devoted service, and worship.
