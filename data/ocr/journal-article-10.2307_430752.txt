<plain_text><page sequence="1">JENEFER ROBINSON The Eliminability of Artistic Acts IN HIS BOOK Mind and Art, Guy Sircello distinguishes three ways in which anthropo- morphic or expressive properties are ascrib- able to works of art. 1. We might ascribe an anthropomnor- phic property to a work of art in virtue of features of that work which it could share with an object in nature. A scherzo and a rippling stream might both be termed "merry" on the grounds that the sounds they make tend to be high-pitched, to fol- low one another in little runs, to have a light rhythm and a swift tempo. A painting, a sculpture, and a tree might all be called "dejected" in virtue of their dark coloring and drooping lines. In short, the anthro- pomorphic properties of a work of art may be grounded on its formal properties, such as the color and line of paintings, the rhythm and tempo of music. 2. Sometimes the expressiveness of a work of art is a function not of its form but of its subject-matter. A picture or a sculp- ture might be sad because it represents a woman sadly weeping; a poem might be calm because it describes a calm sea on a calm day. Clearly a single work might be expressive in both ways (1) and (2). Thus a dejected painting may represent a woman who looks dejected by means of dark colors and drooping lines. 3. Sircello's most controversial and in- novative contribution to the debate on ex- pression is his identification of a way of attributing an anthropomorphic property JENEFER ROBINSON is assistant professor of philos- ophy at the University of Cincinnati. to a work of art on the grounds that the work contains what he calls an "artistic act." 2 The concept of an artistic act is defined by example: if an artist treats, por- trays, describes, views, contemplates, pre- sents, or depicts his subject in a particular way (such as ironically or sentimentally), he is performing an artistic act. In general, the term designates those "acts" of an artist "which must be described in terms which are discernible in the artist's work." 3 Thus a painting may be ironic because in it the painter depicts his subject ironically and a poem may be sentimental because the poet's treatment of his subject in the poem is sentimental. Some "artistic acts" however, cannot be described in terms which are predicable of the work itself. Thus a novel in which the characters are described with "affectionate objectivity" is not one that is "affectionately objective"; a building in which mass and power are sensitively por- trayed is not simply one that is massive and powerful. Nevertheless, the evidence that an author has described his characters with affectionate objectivity is - like the evi- dence that he has treated them ironically or sentimentally - to be found in the work itself and not merely in the biography of the artist conceived as distinct from the work.4 Sircello draws an analogy between artistic acts and ordinary human gestures, such as smiles, tears, and frowns, and argues that this analogy explains why we say that works of art express certain of their anthropo- morphic properties. On his view, an ironic description, like an ironic smile, is charac-</page><page sequence="2">ROBINSON teristic of an ironic person: an ironic person might express his irony in his ironic descrip- tions, as in his ironic smiles. Now, a novel or a smile may be ironic because the novel- ist describes events ironically and the smiler smiles ironically, whether or not novelist and smiler are themselves ironic people. But very often a gesture or an artistic act. does express the emotion, temperament, or state of mind F of the person X who per- forms that gesture or artistic act. Sircello's analysis of what it is to be an expression of X's F is as follows: (1) If G, H and I are ("proper") expres- sions of X's F, then they are caused by F. (2) If G, H and I are expressions of X's F, then they "show" X's F and it "shows" in them.5 Moreover, no cases of showing which are not also cases of expression manifest a causal relation between what is shown and that in which it is shown. A "proper" expression of X's F is, in Sircello's usage, an action that is described in terms of what it expresses. Thus we may equally correctly describe an action as "Jim's kicking the dog" and "Jim's kicking the dog angrily," but only under the latter description is it a "proper" expression of Jim's anger. On Sircello's criterion, then, Jim's kicking the dog angrily is a proper expression of his anger provided that his anger caused the angry kicking and his an- ger shows in the kicking. Sircello describes this kind of causation as "formal causa- tion," 6 because he regards the relation be- tween what is expressed and its expressions as analogous to the relation between a Form and its instantiations as that relation is understood by a large part of the Platonistic tradition, namely as an "efficacious" cause. Thus an act A expresses X's F if and only if (1) X's F shows in A (F is a universal of which A is a particular instantiation) and (2) X's F is an efficacious cause of A. For example, Eliot's compassionate treatment of Prufrock is an expression of Eliot's com- passion if and only if compassion shows in his treatment of Prufrock and Eliot's com- passion is the cause of the compassion (that shows) in the treatment. Sircello's theory is both subtle and illumi- nating, in spite of his employing some puz- zling concepts, notably the concepts of an "artistic act" and of a "formal cause." In this paper I shall try to show that we can say most of the things that Sircello wants to say without having recourse to either of these concepts. I shall argue (1) that some cases of expressiveness which appear to in- volve artistic acts can in fact be analyzed as cases of the first or second sort of expres- siveness; (2) that there is a way of constru- ing most cases of the third sort without recourse to artistic acts; and (3) that al- though there is a causal relation between what is expressed by a person and its ex- pressions, it is not a mysterious "formal" causation, but rather an ordinary sort of causation which applies to all three kinds of expressive property. If the theory I develop is correct, it will follow that (a) there is a way of eliminating artistic acts from most critical discourse, and (b) works of art in fact always derive their expressiveness, either directly or in- directly, from the expressiveness of the natural world. Now, interestingly enough, (a) and (b) are among the assumptions be- hind what Sircello terms the currently "Canonical" position on expression, as ex- emplified by the views of Beardsley and Bouwsma.7 Sircello believes he has demon- strated the inadequacy of the Canonical Position. Insofar as my theory supports (a) and (b), however, it can be seen as a defense of the Canonical Position against Sircello. One cautionary note should be sounded, however. As I shall mention later, there is, I think, a class of expressive properties which remains somewhat recalcitrant to my analysis. How important one thinks this is will probably depend on how important one thinks it is to eliminate artistic acts from critical discourse, and this in turn may well depend on how committed one is to the "Canonical" Position. I Some of Sircello's examples of the third sort of expressiveness seem to me to be 82</page><page sequence="3">The Eliminability of Artistic Acts analyzable as examples of the first, for ex- ample (a) through (c). (a) John Cage's Variations II is an im- personal piece of music. (b) Negro sculpture conveys a sense of suffering and resignation. (c) Roman architecture exhibits a sense of mass and power. To these examples we might add (d) which is close to another Sircello's cases. (d) Henry Moore's Mother and Child is a compassionate portrayal of mother- hood. As we have seen, we ascribe expressive prop- erties in Sircello's first sense to works of art in just the same way as we ascribe ex- pressive properties to objects and scenes in nature, namely on the grounds that they have certain "formal" features. Now, it seems to me that certain mountains can be seen as exhibiting a sense of mass and power, that an isolated tree might be said to be compassionate or to convey a sense of suffering and resignation, and that the sound of waves pounding on a rocky shore might be called impersonal. In saying that the mountains convey a sense of mass and power, we mean not only that they look massive and powerful but also that in looking at them we get a sense of what mass and power are really like: we can "feel" their presence. Similarly, we might get a sense of what suffering and resignation are like from the sight of a gnarled old hawthorn tree that seems to have bent before the wind. The reasons why we anthropomorphize natural things are various. Thus a willow may be called "compassionate" because it leans protec- tively to the ground and like a compassion- ate woman, enfolds those who sit in its shade. And the "impersonal" sound of waves on a shore has the same relentless disregard for humankind as an impersonal person might have. Now, clearly these natural things express compassion or a sense of mass and power in virtue of their formal properties - the "stance" of the tree, the bulky, hunched appearance of the mountains - and not in virtue of any "artistic acts" in a creator. It 83 seems plausible to suppose, therefore, that works of art having these same expressive properties also have them in virtue of their formal features. Thus, the sounds of Cage's music are "impersonal" in that they sound cold and metallic, like impersonal pieces of machinery. Moore's sculpture is compas- sionate in the sense that, like the willow, its form is rounded and enfolding, like that of a woman leaning compassionately over a child. And so on. If I am right, then examples (a) through (d) and others like them can be explained without reference to artistic acts. For ex- ample, the building conveys a sense of mass and power simply because of the way it looks and not because its designer portrayed the look of mass and power in a sensitive way. Of course, this does not mean that an explanation in terms of artistic acts is im- possible, merely that there is a simpler alternative to such an explanation. Another set of examples of Sircello's third sort can, I think, be alternatively in- terpreted as of the second sort. In what follows, example (e) is Sircello's example, while (f) also seems to me to be a possible example of the third sort: (e) Brueghel's Wedding Dance in the Open Air is an ironic portrayal of a peasant wedding. (f) Cremona's Maternal Love is a senti- mental picture of motherhood. To these we might add a third example which is in part similar: (g) Tess of the d'Urbervilles is a pessi- mistic novel. It seems to me a plausible explanation of the expressiveness of cases like these that it is derived, at least in part, from the expres- sive qualities of the object, scene or persons depicted. On this view, Brueghel's Wedding Dance is ironic not because Brueghel por- trayed the scene in an ironic way, but sim- ply because he has accurately recorded an ironic scene. Similarly, Hardy's novel is pessimistic partly because it describes peo- ple who are themselves pessimistic about life and its possibilities. Suppose a work of art is ironic and that it owes its irony to the irony of its subject- matter. There are at least two ways of</page><page sequence="4">ROBINSON interpreting this claim: (1) the artist had a real-life model which was in fact ironic and he represented or described it as ironic; or (2) the artist had no real-life model, in which case the ironic subject-matter exists only in the picture or description. In Good- man's terminology with respect to pictures, either (1) the picture both denotes an ironic situation and is an ironic-situation- picture, or (2) the picture is an ironic- situation-picture which does not denote an ironic situation.8 There is a further case (3) in which a non-ironic situation served as model or "jumping-off point" for the artist. In this case the result may be a pic- ture that denotes a non-ironic situation but is an ironic-situation picture. For our pur- loses, however, (3) can be regarded as a special case of (2). (1) If the expressive quality of a picture is derived from the expressive quality of its model in real life, then it is not due to any "artistic act" on the part of the artist. All the artist has to do is accurately record the expressive quality of the scene before him. There may be a problem, however, about what exactly this quality is. Some things have a relatively standard expressive qual- ity: a child laughing and playing tends to (although it need not) be a joyful scene and a funeral tends to (although it need not) be a melancholy one. Other things, however, may have a wide variety of expressive qualities broadly depending upon how they are perceived. Suppose, for example, that Brueghel modeled his picture on an actual peasant wedding. Such a wedding could perhaps have been seen as jovial or gro- tesque, as well as ironic, depending upon which features of the scene the viewer focused on.9 In what sense, then, can we say that the real-life scene is ironic? Now, Brueghel recorded the scene as having certain features: the peasants are brutal- looking, the dance is heavy, and the other wedding accoutrements are innocent- looking and joyful. It is precisely these fea- tures of the scene which make it ironic. If Brueghel recorded the real-life scene accurately, then the scene has these features, i.e., it is an ironic scene; and Brueghel saw the scene as having these features, i.e., he focused on the ironic features of the scene rather than on, say, the jovial ones. Thus on this view, the picture is ironic because it depicts a scene which in real life can be seen as ironic (although it can also perhaps be seen as jovial). Similarly, Cremona's painting represents a scene of a mother gazing dotingly and trustingly at her child, a scene which in real life canl be seen as sentimental. (2) Sometimes a picture may derive its expressive quality from its subject-matter even though the picture (a) has no model in real life or (b) has a model which is only a "jumping-off point." Suppose Brueghel had no model for Wedding Dance. On the view being defended here we should have to say that the picture is ironic because it represents a scene which - if it were to exist in real life - could be seen as ironic. Alter- natively, the picture represents a hypotheti- cal scene which would be ironic were it to exist. Similarly, if Hardy's characters were in fact real people, they would be pessimis- tic people. Again, the expressiveness of the art work is derived - albeit indirectly - from the expressiveness of the real world: the artist is "borrowing" the expressiveness of nature rather than "creating" the expres- sive qualities of his work by means of artis- tic acts. There are at least two major objections to this kind of view. First, it might perhaps be objected that we never see the natural world in quite the same way as we see the representational content of a picture, since pictures are artifacts and as such demand a special kind of scrutiny.10 Thus Maternal Love represents a "scene" but a mother's gazing at her child in real life does not, since the term "scene" implies a certain artificial "fixed" quality in the situation. However, we surely do very often perceive the world in this way. If we come across a mother gazing with rapt attention at her child, we may indeed see them as "fixed" in certain gestures and in a certain formal pat- tern or "composition." Indeed photographs can "frame" nature and turn it into art pre- cisely because nature too has interesting formal and expressive qualities. A more serious objection is that the view 84</page><page sequence="5">The Eliminability of Artistic Acts defended here is only plausible with respect to realistic and quasi-realistic pictures. We can tell from the pictures themselves what the scenes represented in Maternal Love and the Wedding Dance would look like in real life. However, it is often impossible to tell what a scene or object depicted in a non-realistic picture would look like in real life. It is therefore implausible to say that the expressive quality of a picture - which may be obvious from the picture - is de- rived from the expressive quality of its model - which may not be at all obvious from the picture. Thus whether or not a Kirschner street scene had an actual model, for example, it is perhaps implausible to say that it is a pessimistic picture (partly) on the grounds that it depicts people who in real life look or would look pessimistic, since we cannot tell from the picture what such people would look like at all. This objection, however, construes too narrowly what it means to see something as having certain properties. To see a scene is not merely to see what its visual appear- ance is. Thus although we may not be able to tell from the picture what the Kirschner models look like, we can certainly tell what psychological character they have. Clearly, these are people who, if they existed, could be seen as pessimistic. We can still say, therefore, that the picture derives its expres- sive quality (pessimism) partly from the fact that it represents a pessimistic scene, i.e., a scene which could be seen as pessimistic were it to exist. In short, the expressiveness of the picture again partly derives from the natural world. II Although some of Sircello's examlples of type (3) can be explained as examples of types (1) or (2), there are other examples of type (3) which cannot. For example, as Sircello points out, Poussin's aloof picture, The Rape of the Sabine Women, cannot be construed as a picture of an aloof scene. In what follows, however, I shall argue that there is a way of construing such cases with- out having recourse to artistic acts. In par- 85 ticular, whereas Sircello holds that the aloof- ness in Poussin's painting lies in the artist's aloof portrayal of the scene, I want to claim that it lies in the aloof point of view from which the scene is represented. Borges describes Walt Whitman and Paul Val&amp;ry as creating complete imaginary "personas" in their writings. Not all artists go this far, but all create points of view in their works, which may or may not be their own. Thus Poussin can represent the Sabine rape from an aloof point of view whether or not he himself has an aloof personality. When we say that Poussin represents the scene from an aloof point of view we mean, rather, that he represents the scene as hav- ing certain properties and not others. Thus he suppresses suggestions of violence and cruelty, suspends all movement and ignores the emotions of both victims and attackers. Instead he represents the scene as a har- monious composition, with the human fig- ures posed in frozen but graceful gestures, each contributing to the formal balance of the whole. Poussin has sacrificed psycho- logical interest to formal. Let us simplify and abbreviate this information by saying that in the picture the subject-matter is represented as having properties Q, R, and S.1" The question now is this: why is it that a picture which represents the Sabine rape as having Q, R, and S should be an aloof picture? Now, as Sircello points out, evidence (such as I have just given) for the claim that the picture is aloof could equally well be submitted as evidence that the picture is incoherent: Poussin's "coldly classical" style might be judged as simply unsuited to the depiction of a turbulent scene.12 But it seems to me that this difficulty is not unique to expressive properties of the third sort. On my view a characterization of the form and/or subject-matter of an art work is rarely sufficient to determine its expressive quality. What exactly the relation is be- tween expressive and non-expressive prop- erties is an old and difficult problem which I do not want to discuss here. Hence for the purpose of this paper, I shall assume that the fact that Poussin's subject-matter is represented as having Q, R, and S is indeed</page><page sequence="6">ROBINSON grounds for asserting that the picture is aloof. The question I am interested in here is why this should be so. Clearly, it is not the case that if the Sabine rape is represented as having Q, R, and S, then it is represented by a person who is aloof. Rather, we want to say that if this scene is represented as having Q, R, and S, then it is represented in an aloof way. This, however, sounds very much as if we are attributing an artistic act to the artist. Moreover, it still does not explain why representing the scene as having Q, R, and S is representing it "aloofly." Both these difficulties can be surmounted, however, by saying that the reason why we call the painting aloof is that it represents the rape scene as if it were being viewed in an aloof way. Put another way, Poussin represents the Sabine rape as seen through the eyes of an aloof observer. In short, if anyone were to view the scene of the Sabine rape in the way Poussin represents it, he or she would be viewing it in an aloof way. I am claiming, then, that we can analyze the somewhat mysterious notion of repre- senting something from an aloof point of view in terms of the perhaps slightly less mysterious notion of seeing something from an aloof point of view. To see something from an aloof point of view is to see it from the standpoint of a particular psychological attitude, although, of course, different aloof viewers of the same scene may well see it in different ways, i.e., as having different prop- erties. What Poussin gives us is a view of the Sabine rape by someone who ignores the violence and cruelty, the frenzied move- ment, the anguish of the victims and the brutality of the attackers. Instead this hypo- thetical observer has seen the rape as a study in form, in which the figures are merely graceful constituents of a harmoni- ous composition. This is one way of viewing the scene "aloofly." On this theory, therefore, to say that Poussin represents the Sabine rape from an aloof point of view is to say this: In The Rape of the Sabine Women Poussin represents the scene of the Sabine rape as having properties Q, R, and S, and if anyone were to view the scene of the Sabine rape as having properties Q, R, and S, then (it is likely that) they would be viewing it "aloofly." Similarly, Eliot's compassionate portrayal of Prufrock is a description of Prufrock as seen through the eyes of a compassionate viewer of (and listener to) Prufrock. This way of construing Sircello's third type of expression avoids reference to "artis- tic acts": the aloofness of Poussin's painting is due not to the aloofness of an artistic act but to the fact that if the scene it represents were in real life and were seen by someone as Poussin represents it, then that person would be seeing it "aloofly." As in the case of the first two kinds of expression, art mirrors nature. Not surprisingly, there is a close relation between the second and third kinds of expression: a portrait in which the subject is seen from a contemptuous point of view is likely to represent the subject as contemptible; in Brueghel's painting the peasant wedding is represented as ironic and it is also represented as seen from an ironic point of view. The chief problems with my analysis of the third sort of expressive quality are simi- lar to the problems that arise with the second sort and can be handled in similar ways. Thus it could be argued that my account explains the Poussin example only because it is in a relatively realistic style, hence we know what it would be like to see a scene in this way (even though it might take a training in classical art before one was actually able to see a la Poussin one- self). If a picture is in a non-realistic style, however, it might just be empirically impos- sible to see a scene in the way it is depicted. Thus it might be argued that Leger's Three Women (le Grand Dejeuner) is an aloof painting but not because the women are seen in an aloof way, because no one would ever really see three women as mechanistic constructions of metal plates and cylinders, jointed together. Indeed, no women would fit into space in the way that Leger repre- sents them. Similarly no one could have ob- served a brothel scene in the way Nolde rep- resents one in his Life of Maria Aegyptiaca since no people ever existed having the rough-hewn shapes and crude coloring of 86</page><page sequence="7">The Eliminability of Artistic Acts Nolde's figures. Similar examples can be found in literature. Thus it is perhaps im- plausible to claim that Wordsworth's poem IWe are Seven is sentimental because it rep- resents the conversation as overheard by a sentimental bystander: indeed it is hard to know what a "sentimental hearing" would be. Again, however, we should not construe too narrowly what it is to "perceive" reality. As I argued earlier, artists do not merely record people's outward appearances and behavior, but present a "vision" of reality which is as much psychological as visual. The hypothetical observer of Three Wormen perceives the women from the viewpoint of a certain set of interests and attitudes: his point of view is Cubist-influenced, mecha- nistic, and aloof. Similarly, the hypothetical onlooker of Wordsworth's conversation per- ceives the scene from a Romantic senti- mental point of view. Even Prokoviev's witty grandfather theme in Peter and the Wolf can be handled in a partly similar way. Clearly Prokoviev's music does not describe Grandfather as seen by a "witty observer": the wit is in the orchestration, not the observing. However, I would argue here that calling the theme "witty" is in fact telescoping two different pieces of in- formation: (1) the theme describes Grand- father as viewed by a humorous observer, and (2) the musical description is skillfully done. It seems to me that my analysis is ade- quate for all examples of the third sort of expressive property which are taken from representational art. In all these cases, the expressiveness of the art work is derived either directly or indirectly from the ex- pressive quality of the point of view from which something is perceived. As I re- marked earlier, however, there is a class of expressive properties which appear to be recalcitrant to my analysis. This is the class of examples of "artistic acts" in perform- ance, such as a fragile performance of Swan Lake, an aggressive reading of Donne or a subtle rendition of a Chopin mazurka. On the face of it, these cases cannot be analyzed in terms of how the performer perceives the world but only in terms of how he or 87 she does something. Sircello does not dis- cuss this class of examples in his book but I suspect this is merely an oversight.'3 My analysis should therefore be con- strued as an analysis of the expressive properties of art works themselves and not of particular performances of art works. Now, it is interesting to note that on Sir- cello's view works of art themselves can be regarded as in a sense "performances" by an artist, insofar as they contain artistic "acts." In contrast, by eliminating artistic acts, my theory emphasizes the distinction between a work of art itself and a perform- ance of a work of art. Thus on my view it makes sense to say that a dance performance is fragile because of the fragile way in which the dancer performs (dances), but it is mis- leading to say that a painting is aloof be- cause of the aloof way in which the painter performs (paints). III I have argued so far that none of Sircello's three kinds of example requires the invoca- tion of artistic acts: rather, the expressive quality of a work of art is due to (1) its form, (2) its subject-matter, or (3) its point of view. Now, on Sircello's theory, works of art can only be expressions of the artist's temperament or state of mind if they con- tain artistic acts: only an aloof portraying or describing, for example, can be an ex- pression of the artist's aloof personality. I now want to argue that even though artis- tic acts are eliminable from talk about the expressive properties of art works, it is still possible to view art works as potential expressions of the artist's temperament etc. Further, I want to claim, contra Sircello, that all three kinds of expressive property can make art works expressions in this sense. According to Sircello, where X is an artist and F an expressible quality, (an artistic act in) a work of art is an expression of X's F if and only if it is formally caused by X's F, i.e., (1) the artist's F shows in (some artistic act in) the work, and</page><page sequence="8">ROBINSON (2) the F of (the artistic act in) the work is caused by (the artist's) F. Sircello claims that the formal causation in- volved in expression is a sui generis rela- tion, which suggests that it is not very help- ful as an explanatory concept; further, there is an air of paradox about saying that something is both an instance of and caused by a particular quality. Nevertheless, I think Sircello is right to identify a causal element in expression and I want now to show that we can rescue the germ of truth in his account without having recourse to the mysteries of artistic acts and formal causes. Consider a painting which is called mel- ancholy in the first sense, on the grounds, for example, of its dull colors and droopy forms. It seems reasonable to say that mel- ancholy shows in the painting, since the painting is melancholy in virtue of the melancholy colors and forms which clearly show in the painting. Now suppose that it was the artist's melancholy that caused him to choose such melancholy colors and forms. In this case the artist's melancholy is indirectly responsible for the melancholy in the painting. Similarly in the case of the second sort of example. The artist's melan- choly disposition may cause him to choose the melancholy subject-matter which in turn makes the painting melancholy. Finally, the artist's melancholy may cause him to represent something as seen from the point of view of a melancholy observer and this melancholy point of view may be respon- sible for the painting's melancholy. Thus if Poussin were an aloof sort of person, his aloof personality may have caused him to represent the Sabine rape as seen from an aloof point of view: in this case, Poussin himself would be identical with the hypo- thetical aloof observer of the scene. If X's melancholy causes him to paint his picture in melancholy colors, it follows that it causes him to produce a melancholy pic- ture. This is because in this particular case X's painting his picture in melancholy colors is identical with X's producing a melancholy picture, or, on Alvin Goldman's theory, it causally generates X's producing a melancholy picture, i.e., X's painting in melancholy colors causes the production of a melancholy picture and X's painting a melancholy picture "consists in" X's caus- ing the production of a melancholy pic- ture.14 There is then, a perfectly good sense in which an artist's state of mind or what- ever can cause the presence in his work of its expressive properties. Now, it seems to me plausible to claim that a work of art is an expression of the artist's F if and only if: (1) F shows in the work of art, and (2) the F in the work of art is caused by the artist's F. This principle captures what I believe to be two of Sircello's most important insights, namely that if A is an expression of X's F, then (1) F shows in A and (2) X's F causes the F in A. At the same time, the principle avoids the obscurity of the notion of formal causation, by providing a straightforward account of exactly how an artist's F can cause his work of art to have F. On the other hand, of course, my principle differs in at least two crucial ways from that of Sircello. Thus on my view, (1) we no longer say that the expressive property F which shows in an art work is the artist's F; and this is because (2) my principle makes no reference to artistic acts: it is not an F-ish act by the artist which makes a work of art F-ish. Moreover, an expression of X's F is not an act but the work of art itself. On my theory, the analogy between works of art and gestures cannot be made out in the way Sircello explains it. Having seen that there is a way of elimi- nating talk of artistic acts from most critical discourse, we can account for the expressive- ness of a work of art exclusively in terms of the expressiveness of the form, subject- matter and point of view in a work. What is more, we can explain the causal link be- tween an artist's F and its expressions with- out reference to artistic acts. Interestingly, the theory I have offered can, I think, be viewed as an extension of Wollheim's theory of expression according to which, very roughly, the artist makes his work of 88</page><page sequence="9">The Eliminability of Artistic Acts art in such a way that it will match a cer- tain emotion or state of mind, whether or not that emotion or state of mind is his own.15 On my adaptation of Wollheim's theory, the artist makes his work of art in such a way that its form, subject-matter and/or point of view matches an emotion or state of mind, and where that emotion or state of mind is the artist's own it is the artist's emotion or state of mind which causes him to select that particular form, subject-matter and/or point of view. 1 Guy Sircello, Mind and Art (Princeton Uni- versity Press, 1972). 2 See Sircello, Mind and Art, ch. 1. 3 Sircello, Mind and Art, p. 77. 4 See Sircello, Mind and Art, ch. 2. 5 Sircello, Mind and Art, p. 236. 6 See Sircello, Mind and Art, ch. 9. 7 See Monroe C.
