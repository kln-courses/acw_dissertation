<plain_text><page sequence="1">A NEW INTERPRETATION OF HESIOD, 'THEOGONY' 35 Hesiod devotes the first one hundred fifteen lines of the 'Theogony' to a hymn in honor of the Muses. In it he describes how these goddesses dance on Mount Helicon, sing of the descent of the gods, and grant the gift of eloquence to their favorites. Into the midst of this hymn, Hesiod inserts a personal account of his investiture as a poet: while he was pasturing his sheep on Mt. Helicon, the Muses suddenly appeared, gave him a laurel staff, breathed into him a divine voice that enabled him to speak of the past and the future, and ordered him to use their gift to sing of the descent of the immortals'. At this point, Hesiod asks a rhetorical question whose meaning has eluded ancient and modern scholars alike: ?XX&amp;a tlil ,Uot taVa zrep\ 6piv ij ipt nCirCpriv (35). Although the sheer number of explanations that have been proposed for this line led WEST to despair that "the truth is lost in antiquity," a close examination of the context in which it appears and a consideration of parallels from the Near East suggests that Hesiod is referring to rituals of divination popular in both archaic Greece and the Levant2. The scholiasts on the 'Theogony' indentified Hesiod's account of his investi- ture as an irrelevant digression from his hymn to the Muses, so they concluded that his enigmatic question about the oak and the rock expresses his unwillingness to expand further upon the subject of his encounter with these goddesses3. Although this explanation seems reasonable, it must be rejected on the grounds that Hesiod's account of his investiture is in no way a digression from the hymn to the Muses. On the contrary, it is an integral part of the hymn that serves to provide a concrete example of the Muses' power, which is described in general terms throughout the rest of the proem. In the main body of the hymn, Hesiod speaks of the origin of the Muses, how they spend their time dancing on Mount Helicon and singing of the race of the immortals, and how they give the gift of eloquence to unnamed kings and poets. But in Hesiod's account of his own investiture, he describes how these goddesses appeared to him personally while he was pasturing his sheep on Helicon, just one of a group of herders whom the Muses describe as "rustic shepherds, worthless disgraces, mere stomachs" (26). In spite of their low opinion of this bumpkin, they were able to transform him into a poet who could discourse upon the genealogy of the gods. Since this is the very subject upon which the Muses themselves sang at the beginning of the poem, they have in effect I Note also line 38, where Hesiod refers to the past, present, and future. 2 M.

Thus, Hesiod's anecdote is not a digres- sion, but a personal testimonial to the Muses' power to transform even the lowliest human into a godlike poet5. WEST'S dismissal of the ancient interpretations of Hesiod's question as "either absurd or inapposite or both" can also be applied to many of their modern counterparts because they rest upon the same fallacious assumption: that Hesiod' s account of his investiture is an irrelevant digression from the hymn to the Muses6. Nevertheless, these are of some value because they bring together proverbial expressions found in other Greek authors that also refer to oaks and rocks. In their attempts to explicate this line, scholars have compared it to similar phrases in Homer and Plato, who associate the 6piv5 and the 7i&amp;rpCC with the origin of mankind. While discussing types of political constitutions at 'Republic' 544d, Socrates notes that the character of a people determines the form of government it will create. In order to forestall any criticism of this conclusion, he then asks, "or do you think that constitutions spring from an oak or from a rock (bc 6pto; no?v i9 FicK it&amp;rpc; ;ytyvs_aiftc), but not from the characters of those who live in the cities?" This expression appears in a similar form at 'Apology' 34d, where Socrates refuses to parade his family before the jurors in order to win their sympathy, but makes it known that he could do this if he so desired: "I, gentlemen, also have relatives somewhere. For truly - Homer says this very thing - I am born neither from an oak nor from a rock (ov6' iyd &amp;'6 6puO6; oi56' &amp;ir6o Kt&amp;rpI; wpvca), but from humans..." The Homeric passage to which Socrates refers is Od. t 162-66, where Penelope asks Odysseus, who is disguised as a beggar, to identify himself: "But even so tell me of your family from which you come. For you are neither from a fabled oak nor from a rock (ov5 yap &amp;i6o 6puo6; iaat nOcXcwpdTox 0o ' &amp;,t6 a CTtprC;)"7. All of these passages allude to a myth that traces the origin of the human race to rocks and oaks, a type of anthropogony that appears in the story of Deucalion and Pyrrha, where postdiluvian man is born from stones, and in pseudo-Hesiod (fr. 266a.9 M.-W.), where the oak is the mother of 4 According to J.

BRADLEY, Theogony 35, S.O. 44 (1969) 7-22, who believes that the expression signals the shift from an aniconic to an anthropomorphic conception of the Muses, and MINTON, The Proem-Hymn of Hesiod's Theogony 369, n. 23, who suggests that the oak and rock allude to the "earthbound" type of hymn that Hesiod has been singing. 7 Note also II.

VERDENIUS suggests that this expression may have come to mean "to reveal private matters," although it originally referred to the birth of man from oaks and rocks.

Since Hesiod himself traces the origin of the race of bronze to the ash nymphs at Op. 143-44, he must have been familiar with an analogous tradition9. But despite their superficial similarities to Theog. 35, these proverbial expressions are not relevant to Hesiod's question because their grammatical structures differ significantly from it. Homer and Plato limit the words "oak" and "rock" with ?K or 6mot, both of which express the separation concomitant with parturition, a necessary element of a myth of anthropogenesis. Hesiod, however, uses 7epi with the accusative. WEST noted that anyone who attempts to explain Hesiod' s query should "take note of the fact that irepi with the accusative in early epic always has a local sense; so that the phrase is not simply 'about,' i.e. concerning, tree and rock, but 'round"'10. Therefore, &amp;)kk&amp; atirl ,Uot tcavta ltspt 5p5VV ne p\ irktpriV must be translated "what business have I with these things that happen around oak or rock." Clearly, Hesiod is not speaking about the genesis of mankind, but about an activity that occurs in the vicinity of an oak or a rock. The context in which Hesiod's question occurs allows us to divine its meaning. Just prior to his inquiry about the oak and the rock, Hesiod recalled how the Muses approached him while he was tending his sheep, gave him a laurel branch for a staff, breathed into him a divine voice that enabled him to speak of the past and the future, and ordered him to sing about the genesis of the gods. The ability to see past and future events was not unique to Hesiod, but was shared by prophets such as Calchas (Iliad A 70) and Epimenides (Aristotle, Rhet. 1418a24-6), who had also received this gift from the gods1 1. The link between Hesiod and such prophets is strengthened by the Muses' gift to him of a staff made of iaurel, which was commonly associated with inspired prophecy12. Even though he was but one of a group of herders whom the Muses themselves described as "rustic shepherds, worthless disgraces, mere stomachs" (26), they gave Hesiod this prophet's staff and ordered him to sing of the past and the future. To express his bewilderment at this sudden and unsolicited gift of prophecy, Hesiod asks the rhetorical question akkaxo- irjl giot taioca isp\ 6pI5v il irsp\ 7CCrpTjv, "what business have I with these things that happen around oak or rock." Thus, Hesiod protests that he is not an inspired prophet who can see far into the past, but that he is exactly what the 8 For Greek myths that trace the origin of mankind to rocks and trees, see M.

Hesiod's acquisition of prophetic powers at the time of his investiture would have made perfect sense to the Greeks, who held that poetic and prophetic inspiration were essentially identical; Pindar calls himself the "famous prophet of the Pierian Muses" (Paean 6.6, fr. 40b), while the priests who attended the Pythia sometimes reported her oracles in dactylic hexameters. Plato (Phaedr. 244a-245c) says that the prophet and the poet share a gavia sent by the gods. See E.</page><page sequence="4">134 SHAWN O'BRYHIM Muses had labeled him: an undistinguished shepherd. In spite of his doubts, Hesiod calls upon the Muses for aid and, with their help, he is able to speak of events that occurred before the genesis of mankind, information to which only a god or a prophet is privy. The role of the oak at Dodona and the omphalos at Delphi in Greek prophecy supports this interpretation13. But prophetic trees and stones were not confined to these panhellenic sanctuaries. According to the Suda (s.v. tptio 'l Avm), prophets could predict the future by interpreting the creaking of certain trees, which Pliny (N. H. 17.243) calls arbores locutae. An Orphic work called the 'Lithica' (360-78 ABEL) tells how the mythical seer Helenus made his prognosti- cations by deciphering a whistling sound that emanated from a round stone: a poem by Antiphilus of Byzantium (A.P. 9.263) recounts that Euboule, an oracular priestess of Apollo, could pick up a rock at random, ask it a question, and divine the future based upon the increase or decrease in its weight; Dio Chrysostom (Or. 12.2) says that women could predict the future by lifting any stone that lay within a sanctuary14. This evidence for the widespread belief that priests could obtain information about the unknown from mantic oaks and rocks suggests that Hesi- od's audience would have understood that the poet was expressing surprise when he remarked, in essence, "what business have I with the prophetic profession" in regard to the Muses' command that he sing of events that occurred before the creation of man. Since the Hesiodic corpus repeatedly shows the influence of Near Eastern myth and religion, it comes as no surprise that prophetic rocks and trees are found in the Levant as well'5.

After his victory over the sea-god Yam, Baal decided to build a magnificent palace that would reflect his elevated status. Eager to relate this plan to the deities Anat and Kothar-wa-Hasis, he sent a summons to them: Hurry! Move on! Make haste! Let your feet run to me, let your legs rush to me! For I have a word which I want to speak to you, a message which I want to communicate to you, a word of trees and a whisper of stones, a groaning of the heavens to the earth, of the Flood to the stars: I understand the lightning which the heavens do not know, a matter that mankind does not know, and the multitudes do not understand'6. Although Baal does not reveal the reason for this summons to Anat and Kothar- wa-Hasis in this message, he implies that his intention can be intuited from the flash of lightning, the groaning of the heavens and the Flood, and the word of trees and the whisper of stones. The significance of most of these natural phenomena is found in cuneiform texts from Mesopotamia that indicate that lightning, thunder, and storms were among the portents interpreted by oracular priests, some of whose methods of divination were adopted by the peoples of the LevantI7. The Old Testament reveals that trees and stones, the two remaining objects mentioned in this passage, could also supply information about the future. These stood in Canaanite sanctuaries and were a popular source of oracles. In fact, they were deemed so effective that they were sometimes utilized by the Israelites them- selves, much to the consternation of the Hebrew prophets18. Hosea (4.12) com- plains that "my people inquire of a thing of wood, and their staff gives them oracles"'19.

These oracular trees were so popular with the Isrealites that they appropriated several of them for Yahweh, most notably the terebinth of Oprah (Judges 6.11-32), the oak of Moreh (Genesis 12.6-7), the oak of Mamre (Genesis 13.18 and 18.1-15), and the "Diviner's Oak" at Shechem (Judges 9.37). Many sanctuaries that possessed oracular oaks also contained stone pillars called "masse- bot" that represented a male deity, possibly El21. According to Habakkuk 2.19, these stones were thought to have mantic powers: "Woe to him who says to a wooden thing, Awake; to a dumb stone, Arise! Can this give revelation?" Some prophets were said to receive oracles from the sounds produced from rocks known as "baetyls"22. Damascius (apud Photius 242, fr. 203 = MIGNE, P. G. 103, column 1292), for example, speaks of a Levantine priest named Eusebius who interpreted the whistle emitted by a small stone sphere23. The sounds thought to emanate from these mantic rocks and oaks may explain the "whisper of stone" and the "word of trees" mentioned in Baal's summons. If so, then Baal was telling Anat and Kothar-wa-Hasis that his message is known only to him; unless they resort to some form of divination, the only way to learn of his plan is to obey his summons to come to him so that they can hear it from his own lips24. The method of divination employed at Dodona and Delphi suggests that the Greeks borrowed this technique from the Levant. The cultic activity at Dodona, an oracular sanctuary dedicated to Zeus and Dione, centered around a mantic oak25. the Apocrypha (New York 1977). 20 For theories about the form of the asherah, see S.

MAIER, AMerah:</page><page sequence="7">A New Interpretation of Hesiod, 'Theogony' 35 137 Oracles were transmitted originally through the rustling of its leaves, a sound that was interpreted by male prophets called "Selloi," whom Strabo (7.7.10) identifies as barbarians, non-Greeks26. These oracular priests are mentioned as early as Homer (Hl 233-35), who has Achilles pray for the safety of Patroclus to "Lord Zeus, Dodonean, Pelasgian, who lives far away and governs Dodona with its harsh winters; around you the Selloi live, interpreters with unwashed feet (avt- xro6ito&amp;;) who lie on the ground..."27. While attempts to uncover a Greek derivation for the name "Selloi" have failed, DELCOR argues that it derives from the Canaanite word s'l, "to ask," which appears in a Canaanite inscription from Spain that mentions the bny s'l, prophets attached to a sanctuary of Astarte28. According to Eustathius, the phrase SeXXoYt XogauxAvat refers to the process of incubation whereby the Selloi obtained their oracles. This means of divination was common throughout the Near East and was even carried to the West by the Canaanite colonists who founded the temple of Heracles at Gades, which pos- sessed an incubation oracle (Dio Cassius 37.52 and 77.20) located in a sacred grove where barefoot priests like the Selloi interpreted prophecies (Sil. Ital., Pun. 3.8-11 and 28)29. The Near Eastern origin of the oracle of Dodona was accepted by Herodotus (2.55), who givs a detailed account of its foundation30. He says that the ancestor of the priestesses who delivered oracles alongside the non-Greek Selloi was an Egyptian woman whom the Phoenicians kidnapped from the temple of the Theban Zeus and then sold to the Greeks. Thereupon, she founded the sanctuary at Dodona, became the priestess of Dione (Strabo 7.7.12), and obtained oracles by observing the doves that lived in the oak (Strabo 7, fr. Ic). The species of bird is significant because the symbol of the Levantine goddess Astarte, who came to be Extrabiblical Evidence (Atlanta 1986) 59-60, Dione is the Greek equivalent of Elat/Asherah. The pairing of Zeus (Dios) and Dione at the oracular shrine at Dodona recalls that of El and Elat/Asherah in the Levant. 26 Cf. 2 Samuel 5.24, where Yahweh speaks to David before a battle: "And when you hear the sound of marching in the tops of the balsam trees, then bestir yourself; for then the Lord has gone out before you to smite the army of the Philistines." 27 See also Callimachus, Aetia 186,14, for the Naot) O,re; a&amp;vt67to65c;. 28 M.

Since these doves perched in the oak, it is possible that Dione, like her Canaanite counterpart Asherah, originally controlled the oracular oak. If this is the case, then Zeus must have had his own separate mantic object, whose identity is revealed by Plato (Phaedr. 275b-c). While speaking of the foundation of Dodona, Socrates says that "the people of that time, who were not so intelligent as you young men, were content in their simplicity to listen to an oak or a rock (6puo5 Kat rtupac aKolJSWv), so long as it spoke the truth." If Dione controlled the oracular oak, Zeus must have controlled the mantic rock pictured on the coinage of nearby Epirus, which shows doves, the symbol of Dione, sitting in the sacred oak on the obverse and an eagle, the symbol of Zeus, perched on a rock on the reverse32. Thus, Dodona provides an exact parallel to the oracular sanctuaries of the Levant, where oracles issued from a tree associated with a goddess and a rock associated with a god. There are traces of Levantine prophetic technique at Delphi as well, though not so numerous as at Dodona. LATTE and BURKERT both suggested that the type of ecstatic prophecy utilized at Delphi was not indigenous to Greece, but was imported from the East, possibly from Anatolia33. However, there are numerous references to ecstatic prophecy in the Levant as well, so it is just as likely that the influence upon Delphi came from here34. Scholars have detected another parallel with Levantine prophecy in the stone that Rhea gave Cronus to swallow in place of the infant Zeus. According to Hesiod (Theog. 498-500), Zeus placed it in the sanctuary at Delphi to serve as a memorial of his victory over the Titans. There can be no doubt that this rock was sacred, for Pausanius (10.24.6) says that the people of Delphi anointed it with oil every day and decorated it with wool during festivals. WEST'S suggestion that it had mantic powers35 is confirmed by a number of Dodona. 31 DELCOR, The Selloi of the Oracle of Dodona and the Oracular Priests of the Semitic Religions, 118. Herodotus (2.55) records another version of the story in which a dove was the founder of the sanctuary. For Astarte's connection with Asherah, see the survey of scholarship in S.

Priscian (Inst. gr. 7.32) reveals that this mantic stone possessed the Semitic name abaddir ("quidam addunt 'hic abaddir,' o P(1,B 1Xo;, ... lapis quem pro love devoravit Saturnus...). Scholars of Levantine religion propose that this word means "father of the Powerful One" and that it refers to the Canaanite god El, whose sacred stones generated oracles in the Levant37. These similarities strongly suggest that the custom of utilizing oaks and rocks to obtain oracles came to Greece from the Levant. If Theog. 35 refers specifically to the mantic objects found at Delphi or Dodona, this practice would have been introduced to Greece after the foundation of these sanctuaries in the 8th century B.C., possibly by the itinerant Near Eastern seers who, in BURKERT'S view, emigrated to Greece during the Orientalizing Period38. But due to the limited information at our disposal, it is impossible to answer this question with any degree of certainty. However, the context surrounding Theog. 35 leaves little doubt that the phrase &amp;XXkA tiTi iot txg t vxca rrep'i 8p5v nE ?pt rr?tprjv alludes to the mantic trees and rocks found in oracular sancturies. Therefore, when Hesiod asks "what business have I with these things that happen around oak or rock," he is not employing a proverbial expression to signal the end of a digression. Rather, he is expressing surprise that he, a mere shepherd, would be asked by the Muses to play the part of a prophet and speak of events that occurred prior to the genesis of mankind. This is strikingly similar to the sentiment expressed by the Levantine shepherd Amos (Amos 7.14-15), who was also compelled to become a prophet by divine will. When challenged by the priest of Bethel, he retorts "I am no prophet, nor a prophet's son; but I am a herdsman, and a dresser of sycamore trees, and the Lord took me from following the flock, and the Lord said to me, 'Go prophesy to my people Israel.' " Both Hesiod and Amos reveal their humble backgrounds and then proceed to do the bidding of their god: Hesiod embarks upon his theogony with "Let us begin with you, Muses" (36), while Amos confronts the haughty priest with "Now therefore hear the word to the Lord" (Amos 7.16).

It may also have been imported to the Greek mainland during the Bronze Age through the agency of the Cretans, who were heavily influenced by the Near East and whose religious iconography depicts stones and trees in what appears to be a sacred setting.
