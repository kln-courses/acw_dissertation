Ritual Purification of a Balinese Temple. J. H. HOOYKAAS-VAN LEEUWEN BOOMKAMP. Amsterdam: North-Holland Publishing Company, 1960. 81 pp., glossary, 44 illustra- tions, index, 16 plates. $3.60. Reviewed by JANE BELO, New York City This scholarly little monograph treats of Balinese religion in the only way it can be treated, in profuse detail as to the offerings and instruments of the purification ritual. The author describes the composition of the lis, the broom-like holy water sprinkler made from young palm leaf, intricately cut out and plaited in symbolic forms. These include anthropomorphic components, such as breast bone, ribs, old belly, young belly, navel, liver, and other symbols such as "stairway up" and "stairway down," various sacred trees and grasses. Besides the description of the components, Dr. Hooykaas in- cludes drawings of some 43 of them, beautifully executed by a Balinese artist, Ida Bagus Anom of Ubud. She consulted religious manuals used by the priests both from private sources and from the libraries in Holland and in Bali, finding in 13 different manuscripts the mantra lis, or prayer formulae as hymns of praise to the lis. She gives the orignals and the English translation with careful cross-referencing of the various texts. A second part of the monograph deals with the ritual objects required when a Brahman Padanda or High Priest officiates to make the holy water. These include miniature tools and utensils made of wood and bamboo, and terra cotta replicas of various offerings, numbering in all 78. Photographs of such a set are reproduced from the collection at the National Museum of Ethnology in Leiden. The whole study bears witness to the continuing interest of Dutch scholars in Indonesia, and to the cooperation of Indonesian and European students of the religion and the culture. No suggestion is made of the possibly compulsive nature of the requirements for purification, which some observers remark upon. Dr. Hooykaas states that she hopes she has succeeded in conveying "something of the religious feeling, the creative capacity, and imaginative ingenuity, which characterize the culture of Bali." The Arts of Thailand: A Handbook of the Architecture, Sculpture and Painting of Thai- land (Siam). THEODORE BOWIE (Ed.) Introduction by H. H. DHANI NIVAT KROMA- MUN BIDYALABH. Acknowledgements by HERMAN B. WELLS. Bloomington: Indiana University Press, 1960. 219 pp., bibliography, exhibition catalogue, frontispiece (color), index, 1 map, 163 photographs and figures. $8.95. Reviewed by MICHAEL MOER MAN, Yale University This is really three books in one. It is a catalogue of the Arts of Thailand exhibition (pp. 183-213), a major study of Thai Buddhist sculpture and architecture (pp. 25-157), and "A Note on Thai Painting" (pp. 166-174). The book's unity comes from the con- sistency of Thai Buddhist art and through excellent marginal and textual cross-refer- ences to plates and catalogue numbers. Many of Prince Subhadradis' catalogue notes furnish interesting information about Thai iconography and religious behavior. Succinct description and references to plates and text make the notes useful even in the absence of the exhibition for which they were written.</page><page sequence="2">Book Reviews 663 Miss Elizabeth Lyons begins her chapter with the observation that Thai painting is "almost completely unknown to the western world." She greatly contributes to com- bating this obscurity by presenting not only stylistic judgments and historical sum- maries, but also a clear description of the technology of Thai temple painting. She also discusses the role and motives of the artists. For this, one fears, her ethnographic basis is less firm. Since Miss Lyons wishes to publicize temple paintings, it is surprising that she makes no reference to The Life of the Buddha According to Thai Temple Paint- ings (U.S.I.S., Bangkok, 1957). This lavishly illustrated book has brought temple paintings to the attention of many who might otherwise not know them. In scope and in anthropological interest, the major part of The Arts of Thailand consists of Alexander Griswold's study of Thai architecture and sculpture. We younger anthropologists who tend to avoid what laymen call "culture" will find this section reassuring. Though he uses technical terms and formal typologies, Griswold never makes a mystique of art. His style is clear and forceful. His private esthetic judgments lend personality to his presentation without obscuring it. Despite his erudition, Griswold mentions the chronological divergences between his text and Prince Subhadradis' catalogue notes in a very modest fashion, and delicately avoids the controversy begun in Dated Buddha Images of Northern Siam (Artibus Asiae, Suppl. XVI, 1957), referring the reader to both sides of the disputed "Chieng Saen theory." But the main reason for which anthropologists will profit from Griswold's study is that he neither ignores nor meekly accepts the viewpoint of the social sciences. Gris- wold writes, to use Sapir's phrase, about "civilization in so far as it embodies the national genius." While we may disagree with certain details of interpretation (e.g., the solar basis of Buddhist iconography, the description of ziggurats as magical and the implication that they were burial mounds) anthropologists will understand and applaud his interest in such considerations as political and social history, popular Buddhist belief, and the ethnic diversity of the "consumers" of Buddhist art. For example, with- out explicitly using the concept of culture, Griswold shows that the artists' fondness for copying older images prevents erecting a clear chronology of styles. This unoriginal- ity he then relates to the observation that to Thais, images of the Buddha are more often sources of protective power than objects for esthetic appreciation. This anthropological sympathy tempts one to criticize The Arts of Thailand for fail- ing to accomplish what it never attempts to do. The book is more than a Handbook of the Architecture, Sculpture, and Painting of Thailand, but less than a description of the arts of Thailand. The Thai have concentrated their artistic energy on building and decorating Buddhist temples. This concentration is the book's real, though unstated, subject matter. When the authors depart from it, one gropes for a sense of closure. Why mention manuscript illuminations and neglect shadow puppets? Why discuss gold- leaf lacquer and ignore old Chiengmai brown-red ware and the scratch-work technique? Needless to say, Thai peasant art is completely ignored. This is legitimate, but it should be pointed out that the masterpieces illustrated exist for the Thai villager also, and participate in his tradition. A fresh source of justification for Griswold's interest in political events is suggested by Le May's observation that in North Thailand the bhumisparsa pose is called "the Buddha frightened by the Burmans." Much of the message of this book and some of its unity come from the illustrations. Plates are printed extremely well. Unfortunately for many objects not in the exhibi- tion, the original photographs are poor. The exigencies of printing force Miss Lyons to comment on a nonexistent portion of the frontispiece. Place names, always a trouble, are remarkably consistent and the book begins with a list of alternate forms.</page></plain_text>
