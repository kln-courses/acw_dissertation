<plain_text><page sequence="1">On the Human Figure in Architectural Representation ALEX T. ANDERSON, University of Washington This essay argues for the more thoughtful use of human figures in architectural drawing. In most contemporary architectural drawings, human figures help to provide simple and clear indications of scale or a proper sense of depth. These scale figures need not be merely metric, however. They can also help to project some of the immeasurable qualities of architecture. If they are well conceived and rendered, human figures in architectural drawings can help to show how projected buildings might be perceived and inhabited. They can also be used to understand how architecture can be shaped to accommodate human experi- ences and actions. Human figures help to provide simple and clear indications of di- mension in scaled orthographic drawings; in perspectives they con- tribute to the depiction of a proper sense of depth. These are the most basic purposes of scale figures in architectural drawing, but their potential extends well beyond these limited functions. Even as indicators of scale, human figures illustrate qualities of scale that are otherwise difficult to depict. Whereas other means such as graphic or numerical keys indicate the projected dimensions of a building more precisely than do scale figures, human figures seem to promote an intuitive understanding of scale. Scale figures are particularly effective because one can very quickly associate the fa- miliar shape and size of the human body with the dimensions of things that surround it. Because people naturally associate the di- mensions of their own bodies with those of the figures depicted, they can also develop a sense for how big or small (which are relative dimensions) the objects depicted in the drawing appear. When fig- ures are drawn in such a way that people can identify with them, they can help to exemplify an experience of scale: how imposing or diminutive a building might seem, how lofty or compressed its spaces would feel. Although human figures are conventionally used to express scale in architectural drawings, they need not be constrained to this. Human figures can also provide clients or potential users effective points of association through which to develop an understanding of how a building might affect them in other ways. If figures are drawn as inhabitants or occupants of a projected space, for example (rather than as stylized, metric figures placed in the drawing), they can help to express a range of possible actions and experiences. These might include projected patterns of occupation, use, and movement, anticipated lines of sight, points of physical contact with the building, and so on. Such figures can also help designers to speculate effectively about the actions and experiences of users and the elements that might be developed to accommodate them. Marco Frascari argues that "in contemporary architectural drawing, the presence of the human figure, to give scale, is abso- lutely indispensable."' Although this assertion is not necessarily supported in the contemporary practice of architecture (many ar- chitects do not use scale figures in their drawings, relying instead on numerical and/or metric keys to "give scale" to them), it is nevertheless a point that demands careful consideration. Without necessarily contending that they are indispensable, this essay argues for the more thoughtful use of human figures in architectural rep- resentation. Scale figures need not be merely metric; they can also help to project some of the immeasurable qualities of architecture. If they are well conceived and rendered, human figures can help to show how projected buildings might be inhabited and experienced or how they might respond to human actions. To support the contention that human figures should be used more thoughtfully in architectural representation, this essay first explains how they are typically used in contemporary practice. It then goes on to show, through a series of examples drawn from historical and contemporary sources, how they might be more ef- fectively used. A secondary purpose of this essay is to recount the changing fate of human figures in architectural representation. The examples are arranged chronologically to describe a perceptible shift in the role that human figures have played in architectural draw- ing-from describing the radical anthropomorphism of classically inspired architecture to showing the increased emphasis on embod- ied experience in architecture during the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. Frascari suggests that human figures used by most contem- porary architects "have lost any ontological dimension; they are simply a form of communication oriented to the common man and to the technician, or a formal representation to other architects of the possible problems of scale and dimension."2 The highly stylized figures that many architects place in their orthographic drawings are often stripped of features that are expressive of anything but a very general human shape. (Frascari refers to Robert Venturi's scale figures as "biped balloons with pointed feet and floating heads.'"3) This may be because, when its function is solely to indicate scale, a figure need not be realistic or expressive. These stylized scale fig- ures work well as scale figures, but they do little else. In contem- porary perspective drawings, by contrast, it has become common practice to use more fully articulated figures. However, although these may be accurate depictions of human beings, they rarely seem to have much to do with the buildings or spaces depicted, much less the narratives that might take place in them. They often appear to be merely pasted into the scene. This is literally the case in many Journal ofArchitectural Education, pp. 238-246 C 2002 ACSA, Inc. May 2002 JAE 55/4 238</page><page sequence="2">instances because architects often use figures from clip-art cata- logues that depict people in a great variety of positions and modes of dress (a popular one, called Entourage, contains hundreds of such figures).4 One need only pick the figure that "looks right" in the scene, reduce or enlarge it to the appropriate size and trace it on, attach it to, or digitally paste it into the drawing.5 Although these figures could help to demonstrate the character of projected build- ings, they rarely do. Because they are pasted onto the drawing rather than conceived and integrated with it, they seem hardly even to occupy the spaces of the drawing, much less interact with them. They often appear out of place and disengaged from their contexts, and for this reason their role is usually reduced almost entirely to that of demonstrating scale. Frascari's lamentation of a "lost ontological dimension" in the use of human figures implies that at one time, at least, human figures served to indicate more than scale and dimension in archi- tectural drawings. In fact, the need to argue for the incorporation of human figures into architectural representations is a relatively recent development.6 Architecture was, for a very long time, thor- oughly intertwined with images of the human body. Throughout much of architectural history, architecture, and the elements of architecture were considered to be profoundly, spiritually, symboli- cally linked to the human body, its form, and proportions.7 Con- sequently, architectural drawings were often replete with human figures. In his treatise on architecture, Filarete (Antonio Averlino) demonstrates that not only did practical, corporeal needs provide humankind with reasons to build, but that the body itself provided a model for the first architectural construction. Filarete's poignant drawing of Adam cast out from the Garden of Eden shows him with his hands raised in anguish to protect himself from the rain, shaping a roof over his head. (See Figure 1.) Filarete asserts: "It must therefore be believed that Adam, having made himself a roof with his two hands, considering the need for making a living, he reflected and exercised himself to make himself some habitation to defend himself from these rains, as well as from the heat of the sun."8 Although Filarete's description of the origins of architecture is unusual for its direct incorporation of the human body into the design of the first hut, association between body parts and building elements was commonplace in Renaissance architecture.9 Francesco di Giorgio Martini, another Renaissance architect and theorist, il- lustrates this association at a great range of scales. In his drawings, images of the human body provide order to city plans, to the ar- rangement of buildings and facades, and to the intricacies of build- ,..? ?. ... rs? t't '~?~, . . ? .  IA /t F4 " s VtA uu-w .Al n $ 1.

Human scale is of no particular concern in these drawings; it is the fitness of corporeal arrangement and proportion that matter. Francesco di Giorgio emphasizes that prop- erly designed buildings must demonstrate the divine order en- shrined in the human body.'0 239 Anderson</page><page sequence="3">John Shute, an English architect of the sixteenth century, illustrates this point in a series of drawings depicting the classical orders. (See Figure 3.) His drawing of the Doric order, for example, shows that the proportions of the column correspond to the pro- portions of a brawny male figure, whereas the more slender and elegant Corinthian column reflects finer feminine proportions."I Shute's drawings also demonstrate an important aspect of the relationship between buildings and bodies that is not as clearly evident in the earlier drawings of Francesco di Giorgio: that archi- tectural character corresponds, in part, to variations in human phys- iognomy. The relationship between architectural character and human physiognomy played an increasingly important role during the eigh- teenth and early nineteenth centuries, particularly among the aca- demic architects of France. Rudolf Wittkower asserts that during the eighteenth century "beauty and proportion were no longer re- garded as being universal, but were turned into psychological phe- nomena originating and existing in the minds of the artists."l2 Thus, prominent architects of the late eighteenth century could +3 . .... . .. ..140.. ..

Blondel, "that the character of a building might be influenced and modified by altering the size of the moldings to fit the appropriate human profile."'3 In classically inspired architecture, human bodies and build- ings relate in subtle and intricate ways at many scales. Architects of such buildings tuned them to proportions embodied in the human physique but dictated by universal natural law (these were the same proportions that ruled geometry, harmony, in music, and the mo- . . .. .. .. . .. . . .. . .  - '.. _ . _ 1 i i f1 N.A, "....... . . .... .. .'......- -  ,2  ' .. . . ..? ; " : S.. .. -. . .. ... : ;.,, :: .. . . .---- ... . . . _ . _ .... _ .,, '1- r , i) It I ?. .. .... ...

Human figures in their drawings serve to demonstrate these associations; however, they rarely show objective scale relationships or attempt to indicate human occu- pancy in buildings. These sorts of relationships, although always important, were often considered to be incidental to the more fun- damental problems of form, order, and proportion. Although generally neglected in orthographic drawings, these issues of scale and use were often illustrated in architectural per- spectives. Linear perspective, which was invented during the Re- naissance as a technique for constructing scenographic content in paintings, is well suited for depicting human scale, as well as the actions and emotions of human subjects. Human presence is also deeply insinuated in perspective technique, revealing itself as a point of view at the convergence of visual rays." Not surprisingly, when architects used perspectives to illustrate design projects-a practice that became increasingly popular during the eighteenth century- they often included human figures to clarify issues of scale and dimension. They also gave these figures realistic and sometimes exaggerated attitudes to represent the momentary dramas that might unfold in the buildings depicted. (See Figure 4.) The often improbable simultaneity of events occurring in these drawings seems to heighten their descriptive value by showing not only what might happen in a building at a particular moment but what the building will become because of these events. These scale figures demonstrate not only how people might occupy the building, but they also help to elucidate its functions and its character. (See Fig- ure 5.) When a building's character is predicated primarily on the actions that take place in it, as was the case with some modernist projects, these figures become indispensable for the proper ex- pression of the designer's intentions.'6 (See Figure 7.) Several examples drawn from the eighteenth, nineteenth, and twentieth centuries demonstrate that, when human figures are conceived to be integral to a drawing and are carefully composed, they can con- vey information that a drawing would not be able to communicate otherwise. An interior perspective of "A Project for a Metropolitan Ca- thedral" by Etienne-Louis Boullee, for example, depicts an immense edifice occupied by the figures of more than 150 people and several dogs. (See Figure 4.) Many of the people appear to be conversing quietly or strolling under the immense vaults of the cathedral; others gesticulate animatedly, and still others rush to the left or to the right. John Martin Robinson remarks that these people are "dwarfed to insignificance by the sublime grandeur of the architec- 4.

A Venetian Palace, Eugene Emmanuel Viollet-le-Duc, 1864. ture."'7 They indicate the immense scale of the building, but their presence in the drawing also helps to express its character: not only immensity, but also "sublime grandeur." The insignificance and ant- like busyness of the figures contribute to an understanding of the awesome physical and spiritual forces gathered in the building. "An edifice for the worship of the Supreme being!" Boullke declares of the project, "That is indeed a subject that calls for sublime ideas and to which architecture must give character."'8 Yet the variety of activities and the care with which they are depicted in the drawing also indicate that this is very much a "metropolitan" cathedral. It 241 Anderson</page><page sequence="5">~I i i- ' -- ---~------------ .4.0 ? .. ..:... ... . .? .. .. ..~ T ':.???? o ? ?!,?? _g ... . . . .. i::. ?:i!i  7 : ; S .. .... . ..... .:.. .. .. . . :": Ir . .... : i'." .ra i, ; .. i .. r ~. .. .... 6. The Doge's Palace, Venice, Eug6ne Emmanuel Viollet-le-Duc, 1864. is not solely a place for ritual and solemnity but also for the con- tingency and bustle of quotidian life in the city. The figures in Boullke's drawing facilitate the expression of building characteristics such as immensity, grandeur, and contingency that would otherwise be difficult to express-not only because they defy direct represen- tation, but also because they are present only because of the inter- action of people with the building. Eugene Emmanuel Viollet-le-Duc uses human figures to help convey very different building characteristics in a drawing of "A Venetian Palace." (See Figure 5.) The sectional perspective includes six figures. One sits on a gondola in the canal fronting the building; a second figure, evidently a porter, slouches on a bench in the canal- level portico. Two figures converse in the large vestibule beyond this portico; one of them is animated, head cocked to one side, both hands raised, as if to emphasize a point to his interlocutor. A figure dressed in aristocratic robes stands in the great hall on the main floor with hands outstretched, face turned toward the viewer; this is no doubt the master of the household. A sixth figure, a woman also in aristocratic dress, climbs the stairway to the second floor. Although these figures help to illustrate the scale of the building, they also serve to demonstrate other important qualities. The rela- tive informality of the portico, for example, is shown to contrast with the formality of the great hall, not only in the architectural details, but in the postures and dress of the figures that occupy them. The figures also express gradations of privacy in the building, from the open commerce conducted at the canal level (which is illustrated by the casual meeting in the vestibule on the ground floor) to the restricted access at the main floor (accentuated by the stately pose of the figure in the great hall), to the more secluded feel of the living spaces and bedrooms (indicated by the presence of the lady of the house on the second floor). Viollet-le-Duc uses this drawing to convey a sense that the typical Venetian palace "was perfectly accommodated to the requirements of a noble family in Venice."19 The figures play an essential role in this task. Viollet-le-Duc used human figures in a remarkably different way for orthographic drawings, as his topographic elevation of the Doge's Palace in Venice illustrates. (See Figure 6.) The drawing contains two figures: one stands upright to the right of the palace on the hatched ground line, and the other stands in the shadows on the upper portico, behind the balustrade. Although each is dressed in clothes appropriate to his position-the figure to the right in street clothes, the figure on the balcony in the robes of an aristocrat-each seems to remain aloof from the building. The fig- ure on the balcony, for example, stands back from the balustrade and looks not outward toward the view framed by the portico, as would seem natural, but to the left, down the length of the portico. The faces, which are seen in full profile, appear to be consciously averted as if to avoid the gaze of anyone looking at the drawing. These figures are evidently placed in the drawing primarily to help indicate the dimensions of the palace. This function is served more precisely, however, by a graphic scale drawn below the ground line (indicating that the figures are 1.8 meters tall). Why include both a scale figure and a graphic scale?20 This question seems even more pertinent when considering drawings in which Viollet-le-Duc por- May 2002 JAE 55/4 242</page><page sequence="6">trays a scale figure actually holding a graphic scale.21 Despite their evident redundancy, the human figures in Viollet-le-Duc's ortho- graphic drawings contribute something that the graphic scale does not. They provide an intuitive "feel" for scale that supplements the mathematical determination of dimension contributed by the graphic scale. In his perspective drawings, the human figures con- tribute not only a feel for scale, but also a sense of the building's functions and character. Although his drawing style is very different from that of Boul- le or of Viollet-le-Duc, Le Corbusier also uses human figures to convey effects that are essential to architecture but that are not contained solely in the edifice. The figures in his perspective draw- ings show how use and inhabitation serve to enhance the character of the buildings depicted. For example, in the drawings for mass- production houses, the figures help to show that "standardized" housing units develop character according to the tastes and activities of their inhabitants.22 (See Figure 7.) In these drawings, each unit is identical in form and detail, but furnished and occupied in a unique way.23 Figures are shown engaged in a variety of activities among furnishings clearly not specified by the architect: a baby plays in a playpen, a man exercises with a punching bag, a woman beats a rug over the balcony, and so on. These illustrations dem- onstrate how inhabitation gradually changes the edifice by provid- ing variety and softening hard edges.24 They show how individual apartment cells-which otherwise would be indistinguishable, mo- notonous, and potentially oppressive--become livable by allowing their inhabitants to do what they like and express themselves as they see fit. "The lodging is there . . ." Le Corbusier says, "to receive and welcome the human animal, and the worker is sufficiently culti- vated to know how to make a healthy use of [his] hours of liberty."25 The human figures in the perspective drawings of Le Cor- busier, Viollet-le-Duc, and Boullke emphasize that buildings affect human sensibilities and accommodate human actions. The figures in the drawings of Carlo Scarpa, on the other hand, show that elements of architecture can respond actively to human gesture, that spaces shape themselves to affect sensations in particular ways, and that the human body is a direct agent of architectural composition. In his drawings, human figures do not merely help to explain the dimensions and effects of architectural compositions, they motivate design decisions. Frascari suggests that "in Scarpa's architecture, the human figure is both the subject that produces the buildings sub specie corporis, and the object starting from which the building is made," and that "the small things of the body and its habits con- stantly regulate Scarpa's planning."26 Even in orthographic projec- tion, the figures are integral and essential to the intentions being I // . / ~ /(/ x// L, r P I? / lb :t yr ?i O .. ?: .-r 'Y Ct~' iI ~Cd I~ '* ~Jn~? lr2;25.~~~ply~L~,~.r~L--?YY. r?: '' I ~/ IC i ?? ? ~)T-~I"Tr.7-~- ~~ ~P ~C4 ?? ? 7.

These preoccupations are abundantly evident in his drawings, where bodies (including Scarpa's own body) touch, rest on, observe, lurk behind, peek through, pass by, dodge, and balance upon elements of the architecture, which in turn shape themselves around these actions, in what Frascari calls a "metonymic proce- dure" of design.27 This procedure is clearly illustrated in a drawing for the private meditation pavilion in the Brion Cemetery at San Vito d'Altivole, Treviso. (See Figure 8.) In this cross section of the pavilion, Scarpa includes three figures, presumably representations of the same individual in various positions: one standing facing the viewer, one standing in profile, and a third seated in profile. These quickly drawn but expressive figures indicate the relative size of the pavilion, but they also demonstrate how the occupant of the pa- vilion influences its design. The concrete of the ground platform, for example, steps up to accommodate the seated posture of the figure, while the canopy hangs low over her bowed back and head. The seated figure seems to carve a space of contemplation for herself in which she feels the volume of the canopy resting protectively over her on slender pillars. The standing figures, however, appear to shape and sense the pavilion differently. The canopy lifts and deforms itself to make space for her head as she enters the pavilion, to shield her eyes from the sun, and to limit the view outward. In this drawing, Scarpa indicates that the pavilion responds directly to the postures and movements of the people who will occupy it. Although the figures clearly indicate scale and suggest the sensations the pavilion might evoke, they also demonstrate Scarpa's design 243 Anderson</page><page sequence="7">F-': ? .- h.

The figure and the project become complementary agents, mutually shaping each other in Scarpa's hands. Frascari proposes that the metonymic procedure that Scarpa uses in his drawings can provide a means by which architects might reclaim the ontological dimension of human figures in architectural drawings. By forming architectural elements in direct response to human gestures and actions, this procedure develops implicitly from an attempt to understand how human beings meaningfully inhabit the world. This problem preoccupied a number of philosophers during much of the previous century. Early in the twentieth century, for example, Henri Bergson declared that "the objects which surround my body reflect its possible action upon them. [Bergson's italics]'"28 According to Bergson, people understand the world through the body's ability to act on things. Objects in turn become meaningful because they seem to shape themselves to accommodate these ca- pabilities. Maurice Merleau-Ponty further elaborates this idea in much of his work. In The Phenomenology ofPerception, he suggests that "our body is in the world as the heart is in the organism: it keeps the visible spectacle continuously alive, it breathes life into it and sustains it inwardly, and with it forms a system."29 Drew Leder, a contemporary American philosopher, describes a specifically ar- chitectural manifestation of this understanding when he declares that the human body inhabits the world via "a complex dialectic wherein the world transforms my body, even as my body transforms its world.... [T]he very house in which one dwells is both a re- construction of the surrounding world to fit the body and an en- largement of our own physical structure."30 This notion suggests that architecture should account for the human body, its capabili- ties, actions, and gestures if it is to be both physically satisfying and personally meaningful. Because architects tend to conceive and de- velop their ideas through representation, the human figure should therefore play an important role in architectural drawings.31 At the most basic level, human figures demonstrate that peo- ple understand the scale of buildings in relation to their bodies, and that dimensions cannot fully describe scale. Adjectives of scale, such as immense, lofty, huge, expansive, tight, or crampedindicate not how big or small a space is, but how big or small it feels. For designers, human figures can help to facilitate thinking about the effects of size in buildings, and they are indispensable for communicating this aspect of scale to clients and potential users. Furthermore, fig- ures that are expressive of occupation, use, or human actions can help to elucidate the effects that buildings have on people, as well as the important roles that people play in shaping their environ- ments. Although human figures in architectural drawings might not be absolutely indispensable, they can be powerful tools for con- ceiving and representing architecture. Notes 1.

The inexpressive quality of Venturi's scale figures is clearly intentional. Because his projects themselves are highly demonstrative, expressive fig- ures could muddle the clarity of his drawings. Yet, Venturi's scale figures also seem to indicate, however intentionally, an attitude that fixes meaning in the physical structures of architecture rather than in a dialectical exchange with their inhabitants. In a famous photograph of the Vanna Venturi house, for example, even the real inhabitant of the house takes on these characteristics. Venturi's mother has been positioned outside of the house at the building's centerline, beneath the broken arch; she is seated on a straight-backed chair with a book in her hands (not a good place for sitting or for reading). She is represented as an awkward, enigmatic scale figure who also happens to be the building's inhabitant. 4.

Joseph Rykwert, commenting on this passage, asserts that "to John Wood the human figure seemed the exemplary incarnation of that harmony which also dominated building through the various orders of architecture." He goes on to say that "such an analogy between the body and the orders, which is echoed by other parallels between the body and buildings in general, is deeply ingrained in all recorded architectural thinking." See Rykwert, The Dancing Column, pp. 27-29. The drawings of Santiago Calatrava provide contemporary examples of these sorts of associations. 10.

The Nose of a twelve year old [is] imposed on the chin of a man of eighty, and crowned by the forehead of a man in his middle age." He praises Jacopo Barozzi da Vignola for getting these relationships right: "here the three parts seem to present a more ac- ceptable relation between forehead, nose, and chin, which results in a unified pro- file."

Speaking of his family home, he declares, "but there was one style that our home did have-the style of its occupants, the style of our family." Adolf Loos, "Interiors in the Rotunda," in Spoken into the Void: Collected Essays 1897-1900, Jane O. Newman and John H. Smith, trans. (Cambridge, MA: The MIT Press, 1982), p. 24. 17.

Ben- jamin Bucknall, trans. (New York: Dover Publications, 1987), p. 257. 20. Viollet-le-Duc's description of the drawing and the building it depicts indicates that he intended the drawing to show physical characteristics of the build- ing, not how it is inhabited. "By his skillful treatment of the angles-a delicate point-the architect has succeeded in giving an aspect of sturdy strength to the system of props that support a box of massive appearance. Plate XXIX, representing the angle, shows the excellence of the design." Viollet-le-Duc, Lectures on Architec- ture, vol. 2, p. 199. 21. See, for example, Viollet-le-Duc, Lectures on Architecture, vol. 2, fig. 4, p. 63, and fig. 7, p. 283. 22. Le Corbusier protested that standardization does not eliminate the pos- sibility for individual expression, as some of his contemporaries argued; rather, it places the individual "on the highest level" because it "distance[s] us from the clutter that encumbers our life and threatens to kill it ... and, having won our freedom, we think about something-about art for example (for it is very comforting)." See Le Corbusier, The Decorative Art of Today, James I. Dunnett, trans. (Cambridge, MA: The MIT Press, 1987), pp. 73-75, 77, 137. 23.

Beatriz Colomina argues that the figures in these drawings betray other agendas: "In a drawing of the Wanner project, for example, the woman in the upper floor is leaning against the veranda, looking down to her hero, the boxer, who is occupying the jardin suspendu. He looks at his punching bag. And in the drawing 'Ferme radieuse,' the woman in the kitchen looks over the counter toward the man sitting at the dining room table. He is reading the newspaper. Here again the woman is placed 'inside,' the man 'outside'; the woman looks at the man, the man looks at the 'world.'"

For a full accounting of the range of Scarpa's intentions with regard to the use of human figures in his drawings and the roles they play, see Frascari, "The Body and Architecture in the Drawings of Carlo Scarpa." Frascari explains that "in a metonymic procedure, the drawing of a handle results from a mold in the form of a hand that grasps, rather than from a formal representation of the hand itself."

David Michael Levin discusses a similar notion in The Body's Recollection of Being (London: Routledge and Keegan Paul, 1985), p. 94: "I think we need to ask ourselves: of what are we capable? This question focuses attention on our capacity to develop the character of our primordial rela- tionship to Being as a whole by virtue ofour motility" (Levin's italics). 29.
