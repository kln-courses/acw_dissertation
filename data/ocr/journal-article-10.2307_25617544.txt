<plain_text><page sequence="1">81 Timothy B. Riordan "Carry Me to Yon Kirk Yard": An Investigation of Changing Burial Practices in the Seventeenth-Century Cemetery at St. Mary's City, Maryland ABSTRACT Fifty-seven burials were excavated in the 17th-century cemetery at St. Mary's City, Maryland. Through a unique combination of the structural history of the site and a detailed recording process, the burials are assigned to three 30-year periods, spanning ca. 1638-1730. This data is used to investigate changes in the use and construction of coffins, the func tion of copper pins, and the evolution of hand placement in the burials. These trends are related to larger changes in English burial practices. Introduction In England, the 17th century was an important period of change in traditional burial practices (Gittings 1984:13-14; Litten 1992:12-13). This change has been seen as part of a larger trend emphasizing the individual (Aries 1981:602 603). Burial in a wooden coffin, a 16th-century innovation, became a universally accepted part of the ritual. Along with coffin burial, a shift occurred from an untailored shroud towards readymade burial clothing. Regional traditions gave way to accepted standards of what con stituted a decent burial. Many of these changes have physical aspects that are reflected but gen erally ignored in the archaeological record. Excavations in the 17th-century Catholic cem etery at St. Mary's City, Maryland, offered a unique opportunity to observe these changes in a colonial setting. The cemetery was the commu nity's main burial ground for approximately 100 years, ca. 1638-1730. During that time, a series of chapels were built on the property. The brick chapel (ca. 1667) was constructed in the middle of the cemetery. It was closed in 1704 by order of the government, and the Jesuits tore it down several years later. Beginning in 1983, Historic St. Mary's City conducted investigations in the Chapel Field, identifying the location of the brick chapel and exposing its foundation (Riordan et al. 1994). As preparation for the reconstruction of the brick chapel, museum archaeologists cleared a 10 ft. wide corridor around the foundation of any archaeological resources. This work included excavation of 57 burials. While no burials were marked by tombstones, it was possible to place each grave into a shorter time period by recording its specific characteristics. The sequence was divided into three periods, based on the history of the brick chapel: early (ca. 1638-1667), middle (ca. 1667-1704), and late (ca. 1704-1730). Burials in the early period had little or no rubble in their fill and were oriented to either the early wooden chapel or close to due east. All of the burials cut through by the foundation of the brick chapel share these characteristics. Middle period burials are oriented within a degree or two of the orientation of the brick chapel (111? from true north). They have a large amount of brick rubble from the chapel's construction but do not have any mortar or plaster. Finally, late period burials have large amounts of rubble of all types. Each of the periods is roughly 30 years long, and the sequence spans the period of greatest change in English burial customs. The opportunity to study these changes over time would be lost without a detailed meth odology designed to maximize the amount of information from each burial. As part of the normal excavation technique, each coffin stain was carefully mapped. The nails were described in detail, noting the location of the head, its elevation, the orientation of the shaft, and any adhering wood. The same treatment was given to the numerous copper pins found on the skel etons. This attention to detail, combined with the burial sequence, has produced a remarkable body of data for observing developments in mortuary customs in a colonial setting. The present study focuses on three aspects of the burial program that underwent major Historical Archaeology, 2009, 43(l):81-92.

Use of wooden coffins for burial was becoming the accepted norm, bringing along different ways of making coffins. This paper looks at the use and construction of coffins to investigate chronological trends and technological innova tions. Secondly, the use of copper straight pins, so-called shroud pins, in the burial ritual is investigated. These artifacts are frequently found in colonial burials, but their function is assumed rather than proved. A new interpretation, tied to larger changes in burial ritual, is presented here. Finally, an investigation of changes in hand placement of English burials is reported Coffin Use in England and Colonial America During the middle ages, the most common form of burial called for placing the tightly shrouded corpse directly into the ground with out a coffin. Numerous contemporary illustra tions depict this manner of burial (Hazlitt 1905[1]:250; Aries 1985:117-119,131; Litten 1992:58,59,64). Although there is little infor mation available about the use of wooden cof fins during this time, this does not imply that coffins were not made and used. Julian Litten (1992:89) shows a rectangular wooden coffin dating to the 14th century. It may be a reusable communal coffin, used only for transporting the shrouded corpse to the church and grave but not for burial. The use and reuse of such coffins continued well into the 17th century in England (Geddes 1976:118; Litten 1992:98). The documented use of communal coffins confuses the issue of when the practice of burial in wooden coffins began. A number of illustra tions from 15th-century France show trapezoidal, gable-lidded coffins that were covered with a pall during a requiem Mass (Aries 1985:124; Litten 1992:149). These visuals have been interpreted to mean that wooden coffins were being used in burial rituals, but no illustrations actually show coffins being buried even though pictures of the burial of shrouded bodies are common. In fact, Litten (1992:58) presents an illustrated page (ca. 1423) showing a complete sequence from death, through the Mass, to the burial. At the requiem Mass, a pall covers the typical coffin; yet at the burial, the shrouded body is placed into the grave without a coffin. Until archaeological evidence of these coffins is reported, the issue will remain uncertain. The use of wooden coffins shows a marked increase during the reign of Queen Elizabeth (Litten 1992:12). By the early-17th century, coffins become standard burial equipment for all but the poorest people. Clare Gittings (1984:235-241) surveys probate accounts for three English counties from ca. 1580-1650 and finds evidence for the increasing use of cof fins. Her analysis shows 22% coffin use in the 1580s but almost 90% in the 1640s. While the use of such probate accounts clearly introduces a bias towards the wealthier members of soci ety, there is an obvious increase in coffin use in early-17th-century England. Lois Green Carr (n.d.) reviewed probate accounts during the period 1638-1705 for 10 counties in Maryland. The sample included 457 accounts that showed expenses for funerals, and 91% of these mention a coffin. When viewed chronologically, a trend towards increasing use of coffins is evident. In those accounts dated before 1670, only 79% mention coffins, while 97% of the accounts dated after 1700 have such an expense. Similar results were found in the cemetery at St. Mary's City. Of the 47 grave shafts where preservation was sufficient to note the charac teristic, 32 (68%&gt;) had evidence of coffins. The trend in coffin use is clear when these burials are considered within the framework of the cem etery chronology (Table 1). Presence of a coffin varies according to several factors, including time period, sex, and age. The general rule is for all adult burials to have coffins. In the early period, however, 61% (11 of 18) of the adults were uncoffined shroud burials. Not surprisingly, given the demographics of the Chesapeake, the TABLE 1 COFFIN USE: ST.

RIORDAN?"Carry Me to Yon Kirk Yard" 83 majority of the uncoffined adults were male. Of the five infant burials dating to the early period, three were in coffins. By the time the brick chapel was built (ca. 1667), a coffin was required for all adults. The only middle-period burials that show no evidence of a coffin are two infants, yet five other infants dating to the middle period are buried in coffins. All of the late period burials are adults who are buried in coffins. Over the course of 100 years, coffin use went from less than half to universal use. Coffin use in the cemetery at St. Mary's City shows some interesting contrasts to other reported cemeteries in the Chesapeake. The early period graves, with less than 50% coffin use, are comparable to the site of Martin's Hundred (1619-1622), which had 33% coffin use (Noel Hume 1982:74-83). It may be that until the last quarter of the 17th century, the use of coffins, while common, was restricted to the more wealthy or prominent members of a community. By the later 17th century, coffin use, as represented by the middle-period buri als, becomes universal for adults. Similar results have been found at Middle Plantation (ca. 1664-1700) in Maryland with 100% coffin use (Doepkins 1991:134-135) and Clifts Plantation (ca. 1670-1730) in Virginia with 94% coffin use (Neiman 1980:128-140). In contrast, coffin use at the contemporary Patuxent Point cemetery (ca. 1660-1670) in Maryland is very low with only 44% use (King and Ubelaker 1996:39-40). Such small, rural cemeteries, particularly those where the landowner was probably not resi dent, are more likely to retain older, perhaps cheaper, mortuary patterns. The location of the St. Mary's cemetery in the provincial capital must be considered in assessing its relationship to other cemeteries in the Chesapeake. Another characteristic, notable from the nails and wood stains, was the shape of the coffin. Until recently, all colonial coffins were thought to be of the standard hexagonal or "single break shape," with a flat lid (Habenstein and Lamars 1962:254-256). Discoveries at Martin's Hundred showed that coffins not only could be made in other shapes, like trapezoidal, but they could have gabled lids as well (Noel Hume 1982:38-41,76-80). Even knowing about the possibility of different coffin shapes occurring, the excavators were not ready for the variety found in the chapel cemetery. Seven distinct types of coffins were evident in the St. Mary's sample, based on shape of the box and lid style (Figure 1). There are three types of hexagonal coffin: one with a flat lid (HF) and two varieties of gable lid (HG). The rectangular shape was only found with a flat lid (RF). Tapered coffins occurred with both flat and gabled lids (TF, TG). Finally, there was the anthropomorphic shaped coffin with a flat lid (AF). This coffin is narrow at the foot, like the tapered and hexagonal types and expands up to the shoulders. At the shoulder, there is a sharp inward angle, and the head is contained within a small box. Careful attention to the wood stain and nail patterns can add much to understanding the evolution of coffin types. The seven types found in St. Mary's show significant variation in frequency through time (Table 2). Hexagonal types are almost absent from the early period but become the dominant type by the mid-17th century. They are the only type found in the 18th-century sample. This shape was a recent innovation in the early-17th y e ?-1 TF TG \_ r\ f\\ U ffl ffl '-1 HF 1_I HG \_I HG W y *-i RF 1_I AF Figure 1. Coffin shapes.

Rectangular coffins are significant in the early period, less so in the middle period, and are not found in the late period. The most unusual coffin type is the anthropomorphic coffin. Not only is this type present in the early period, but also it is the most common type. Several lead coffins of this shape are known from English vaults, but this may be the first wooden coffin of the type found archaeologically (Litten 1992:101). The choice of a particular coffin type shows a strong correlation to age at death. In the early period, adults are buried in anthropomorphic and tapered coffins. Of the three infants, two are buried in rectangular coffins. At least one of these (and possibly both) is a recycled box, not originally intended for a coffin. The only hexagonal coffin in the early period contains the other infant burial. In the middle period, 9 of the 11 adults are buried in hexagonal coffins. The others are buried in a tapered coffin and a rectangular box, but the latter is a reburial and not a true coffin. Infant burials in this period are evenly split between rectangular and hex agonal coffins. Both of the rectangular coffins used for infant burials in this period appear to be intentionally made as coffins and are not recycled boxes. All of the coffins in the later period are hexagonal. Within the cemetery, there is a distinct trend towards a hexagonal coffin as the accepted burial container. In the early period, only 14% of the identifiable coffins are hexagonal, while these represent 73% of the middle period cof fins. Increasing use of hexagonal coffins, and the abandonment of other forms, is part of the standardization of the English funeral that was progressing through the 17th century. Whether standardization represents the breakdown of regional burial patterns or a growing sophistica tion on the part of carpenters hired to make cof fins cannot be demonstrated at present. It is clear, however, that in the early-17th century, several different styles of coffins were deemed accept able as burial containers, and by the end of the century, there was only one acceptable style. Other cemeteries in the Chesapeake, while used for much shorter periods, have produced similar results. Cemeteries dating before 1650, such as Martin's Hundred, Flowerdew Hundred, and Jordan's Journey, show evidence of tapered and possibly rectangular coffins but no hexago nal ones (Noel Hume 1982:74-83; McLearnen and Mouer 1993). The exclusive use of hexago nal coffins in the late-17th century and the 18th century has been seen at Middle Plantation and at Patuxent Point (Doepkins 1991:134-135; King and Ubelaker 1996:39). A single rectangular coffin is reported from Clifts Plantation, Vir ginia, along with 15 hexagonal coffins (Neiman 1980:130). By the late-17th century in the Chesapeake, as in England, use of a hexagonal coffin was part of a standardized funeral. Coffin Construction Techniques Typically, archaeological reports describe the presence or absence of coffins and usually go far enough to describe the shape of the cof fins. This level of analysis misses some of the most important information concerning the burial container. Unless the burial has been heavily disturbed, the location and orientation of the nails can provide vital data on coffine construction. One of the earliest demonstrations of the importance of this type of analysis was Ivor Noel Hume's (1982:76) discovery of gable lidded coffins at Martin's Hundred, based on</page><page sequence="5">TIMOTHY B. RIORDAN?"Carry Me to Yon Kirk Yard" 85 the finding of a row of nails down the center of the burial. A basic understanding of coffin carpentry can aid in analyzing archaeological remains. Leaving aside the lid, for the moment, a simple coffin consists of five pieces of wood?a base, two sides, and two ends. The base is prepared first because it gives shape and form to the rest of the box. The sides are then nailed to the edge of the base. This procedure results in the side nails lying flat and perpendicular to the main axis of the coffin. While it would be possible to nail the sides on top of the base, this was never done because of the risk that in lifting the coffin, the base could fall off (Litten 1992:92). Significant variation occurs with the closure of the ends. The earliest closure, termed the inserted end board, has the sides cut to the same length as the base. After the sides are attached, the end is inserted into the U-shaped opening. This board is attached by nails driven through the sides and the base. The nail pattern for this closure shows nails on the sides, perpendicular to the main axis, and nails standing upside down at the base (Figure 2). The earliest surviving coffin, a 14th century communal coffin in England, shows this closure (Litten 1992:89). A second method of closing the box is to butt the end up against the base and side boards. The end board is attached with nails driven through the end and into the other pieces. This is referred to as a butted end board. The nail pattern for a butted end board shows nails oriented parallel to the main axis of the coffin (Figure 2). These nails are at the base and run up the sides. This pattern, while simple to con struct, is not as strong as the others. Carpentry that is more complex is required for the third type of closure, known as a combined end board. This method uses aspects of the other two. The sides are made slightly longer than the base, and the end is fitted into this space. The end is butted against the base but is inserted between the sides. The nail pattern for this type has nails along the base that are paral lel to the main axis of the coffin and nails up the sides that are perpendicular to the main axis (Figure 2). The earliest reported coffin using the combined end pattern may be that of Sir Wil liam Allestree, dated 1655 (Litten 1992:98). This type is the most common pattern reported in the archaeological literature (Neiman 1980:140; INSERTED ^t^^^ End Board ^ BUTTED End Board #^ COMBINED ^ End Board ^ """"0 Figure 2. Coffin construction techniques and nail patterns. (Drawing by author, 1999.) Parrington et al. 1989:145; Reeve and Adams 1993:78; LeeDecker et al. 1995:53). All three of these treatments leave unique nail patterns that are discernible in the archaeological record. It is vital that the excavation methods be sensitive enough to record these important differences. In the cemetery at St. Mary's, the excavated data provide significant insights on coffin construction over time. It was possible to make 50 observations on end closure (Table 3). By far, the most common closing technique is the inserted end board, which accounts for almost 70% of the observed end patterns. In the early period, the inserted end board makes up 83%) of the observations, but this falls to 50% by the late period. The combined end pattern, which makes up only 8% of the sample in the early period, represents 50% of the late period sample. The butted end board is uncommon in all periods.</page><page sequence="6">86 HISTORICAL ARCHAEOLOGY 43(1) TABLE 3 FREQUENCY OF COFFIN CLOSURE: ST.

This pattern increases the stability of the box by interlocking the parts and requires considerably more forethought than making a simple box. The combined end pattern begins to become important in the middle period at the same time that the hexagonal coffin is becoming the standard shape. Whether these two things are related cannot be determined at present. The type of lid that is used to close the box is another characteristic that can be observed archaeologically. Until Noel Hume's (1982:76) work at Martin's Hundred, most archaeologists were unaware that coffins could have anything but a flat lid. Even today, there is consider able skepticism that colonial carpenters were capable of making a gable lid (LeeDecker et al. 1995:50). In fact, the gable lid was common well into the 19th century (Pike and Armstrong 1980:132,153; Parrington et al. 1989:139-149). Whether flat or gable, the lid must reflect the shape of the base and must be made larger to cover both the base and the sides. The lid is nailed to the top edge of the sides. Archaeologi cally, this technique leaves a number of nails standing vertically with their heads at the top. While the coffin often collapses in on itself, the lid nails are often found in place because the sides support them. The elevation of their heads can provide a minimum height for the sides of the coffin. Gable lids require more detailed carpentry than do flat lids. In a straight-sided coffin, the gable lid is composed of two pieces of wood that are laid on the gable-shaped end board. The top edges of these boards can either be butt jointed or mitered to provide a clean joint at the peak of the lid. The boards are joined to the coffin with vertical nails on the sides and ends, along with a line of angled nails running down the coffin centerline. When the coffin sides are angled rather than straight, the geom etry becomes more complex. Researchers have observed two distinct types of gable-lidded, hex agonal coffins. Litten (1992:plate 11) illustrates a hexagonal coffin with a gable that runs in one plane from head to foot. This type would have a nail pattern similar to the rectangular, gable lidded type. Martha Pike and Janice Armstrong (1980:132,153) show two hexagonal coffins that have gables running straight up to the chest and then sloping down to the head at a noticeable angle. It is not certain how this type of lid was constructed. The angle could have been created by kerflng the boards and then bending them. Alternately, the lid could be made from four boards that were mitered at the angle. There is good evidence of this form in the 19th century. The lid is made of pairs of boards, joined along the centerline by pairs of nails going in opposite directions. Two of the boards make the ridge from the foot to the chest, and the others make the ridge from the chest to the head. The two sections are butted against each other but not joined (Parrington et al. 1989:145). It is not known if this nail pattern was followed earlier than the 19th century. Within the cemetery at St. Mary's, construction of the gable lids proved to be more complex than anticipated. Four different methods were observed in just seven examples (Figure 3). The most common construction reveals a number of nails along the centerline of the coffin from the foot end to the shoulder area. These nails often appear to be paired with heads on opposite sides. No centerline nails are found between the shoulder and head end. In addition, a number of nails, usually three on each side, are found angling back from the shoulder area. These nails joined separate boards to the main lid and cre ated a diamond-shaped lid rather than a straight gable. There were three examples of this tech nique, all made on hexagonal coffins. The other three construction techniques are each represented by one example. There was one coffin whose gable lid was too disturbed to determine its construction. The first of these was a hexagonal coffin with a line of nails all along the centerline, similar to those from Mar</page><page sequence="7">TIMOTHY B.

Finally, a hexagonal coffin showed evidence of a gable in its profile but had no centerline nails. This was the coffin of an 8 to 9 year old juvenile and is much shorter than the other coffins. It may be that the lid was only joined on the ends. Gable lids comprise a little over one-quarter of all the coffins whose lid construction can be determined. All seven of these are found in the middle and late periods. More importantly, they seem to become more popular over time, being 33% of the middle period lids and 66% of the late period lids. Overall, the sample size is too small to make any firm conclusions. Within the sample, there seems to be an asso ciation of the combined end pattern with gable lidded coffins. Of the 12 observed examples of this closure, 9 (75%) are on gable-lidded coffins. The inserted end board is even more closely associated with flat-lidded coffins. Of the 34 examples of inserted end boards, 32 (94%) are on flat-lidded coffins. While these relation ships seem very strong, they must be accepted with caution for the time being. It has already been noted that gable lids are more common during the later part of the 17th and into the 18th century?the same time that the combined end pattern is more common. It may be that they are independent developments in two sepa rate aspects of coffin construction. Over the period that the cemetery at St. Mary's City was being used, significant changes in the use and construction of wooden coffins have been noted. The trend is clearly towards a standardized burial container. While there is great variation in shape and construction during the first half of the 17th century, the end of the century is characterized by a much narrower selection. Along with standardization, a greater sophistication in carpentry appears to be applied to construction. The hexagonal shape, combined end board, and gable lid appear to be integral parts of this overall trend. Function of "Shroud" Pins A common artifact found in colonial burials is the simple copper or brass straight pin. These are often identified as shroud pins and, if they are interpreted at all, are assumed to be for closing and holding the edge of the wrapped shroud (King and Ubelaker 1996:38-39). A notable exception to this line of reasoning is Fraser Neiman's (1980:140) observation that 22 of the 32 pins he found were on the skull or upper body. As with the coffins, an under standing of accepted burial clothing and careful recording of pin placement provide unexpected and useful data. Tradition dictated that the deceased would not be buried in their normal clothing. Late medi eval burial clothing can be seen on monuments and in paintings. Burial clothing consisted of a long sheet, often of linen, wrapped around the body. Litten (1992:57-72) discusses the develop ment of this garment from a regular sheet to a fully tailored garment in the 18th century. The winding sheet was most often tightly wrapped, and strips of cloth were used to secure the</page><page sequence="8">88 HISTORICAL ARCHAEOLOGY 43(1) sheet at the head and feet. Often additional strips were tied around the legs to make the body stiffer (Aries 1985:118; Litten 1992:61,65). Sometimes the winding sheet was sewn along its edge (Aries 1985:117). There is little evi dence in the literature to support the idea that pins were used to fasten an adult shroud. Beneath the winding sheet, the deceased in the middle ages did not wear any other cloth ing (Aries 1985:116; Litten 1992:59). During the wake, the winding sheet was often parted to show the face of the deceased. Sometimes a face cloth was placed over the exposed head and pinned to the shroud. By the 1630s, it was common for the body to be dressed in a shirt and cap under the winding sheet (Litten 1992:76). The standard 17th-century English burial included "a sheet, shirt and cap" (Gittings 1984:112). Chin cloths, designed to keep the mouth closed, were pinned to the cap. The remarkable preservation of some of the bodies in the vault at Christ Church, Spitalfields, London, demonstrates the use of both face and chin cloths (Reeve and Adams 1993:110-119). These differences in burial clothing are reflected in the use and placement of pins within the burial. Copper or brass straight pins are common in the St. Mary's cemetery burials. Of the 36 burials sufficiently preserved to assess this char acteristic, 27 graves (71%) have pins in direct association with the skeleton. The number of pins included in a burial varies widely, with 9 burials having no pins at all and several buri als having 10 or more. One infant burial from the middle period with 18 pins had the highest total. Pins seem to be more common in infant burials than in adult burials. The adult burials averaged 3.5 pins per grave, while the infant burials average 8.8 pins per grave. Pins also seem to be more common through time for both types of graves (Table 4). The apparent decline in the number of pins during the late period may be a factor of inadequate sample size. Although no fabric was recovered from any burials, it was possible to determine if a tightly wrapped shroud was used. If the toes were pre served in anatomical position, showed signs of confinement, and the knees were close together, this was taken as indicative of a tightly wrapped shroud. If the toes had collapsed, the knees were apart, and the tibiae had rolled sideways, this was taken as indicative of no tightly wrapped shroud. Obviously, this method cannot distinguish the presence of a loosely wrapped shroud, but no contemporary illustrations show such a garment. Using these observations, a dramatic trend is noticeable in the cemetery (Table 5). Shroud use, which is at 69% in the early period, falls to 30% in the middle period and to 25% in the late period. This change from use of a tightly wrapped shroud agrees with the change to burial clothes in England. This trend has implications for the use of straight pins in burials. While these pins are often referred to as "shroud" pins, they seem to become more common just at the time that evidence of shroud use is declining. The actual distribution of pins reveals a more complex pattern of use. Of the 163 pins directly associated with the skeletons, 125 (77%) are found on or around the skull. The proportion of pins in the head area is about the same for both adults (78.5%) and infants (74%). This concen tration probably reflects the use of caps, chin cloths, and face cloths. Similar concentrations of pins in the head area have been noted at other TABLE 4 AVERAGE NUMBER OF PINS BY TYPE OF BURIAL: ST.

At the Clifts Plantation cemetery, 66% of the pins or stains were found in the head area, while at Patuxent Point, around 80% appear to have been in this area (Neiman 1980:140; King and Ubelaker 1996:133-182). In the St. Mary's graves, the pins do not occur randomly in the head area but are found in two distinct patterns (Figure 4). The most common pattern, observed in five burials, has lines of two to five pins, all oriented in the same direction, on opposite sides of the skull. The pins are commonly spaced within a 2 in. area. Their location and symmetry suggests these were used to attach a chin cloth to a (f^X^ FACE CLOTH I (S J Pin Pattern CHIN CLOTH ^ (Z3nC^3 Pin Pattern ?j j/ Figure 4. Copper pin pattern. (Drawing by author 1999.) cap. The second pattern has pins all around the skull, and it was observed in three burials. These may represent the use of a face cloth that was pinned to the shroud. There appears to be a temporal distinction between the two patterns. Evidence of the face cloth was only being found in early period burials, and evidence of the chin cloth was being observed in middle and late period burials. The use of a cap and chin cloth for burial were gaining popularity in England during the middle of the 17th century, and the St. Mary's burials may reflect this trend. Outside of the head area, the use of pins is sporadic but may reveal some pattern. Five burials each contain a single pin on the chest, and one burial has a pin over each clavicle. The significance of this pattern is unknown, but it seems to have been common. Another unexplained pin location is at the wrists. There are four burials where a single pin was found in the wrist area, three on the left wrist and one on the right wrist. In addition to these, there are single pins found on the pelvis in two cases, on the knee in two cases, and at the feet in a single case. It is clear that while pin use was common in the head area, significant use also occurred in other parts of the burial. Further research may identify reasons for these patterns in use of pins. Changes in Hand Placement An important aspect of preparing a body for burial was positioning the hands of the deceased. Information on this aspect comes from excavated graves and from tomb memorials, since there seems to be little written tradition regarding the positioning of the arms or the placement of the hands. In the middle ages, hand placement was variable with at least four different positions recorded (Daniell 1997:118). Use of a particular placement might represent regional or status-related trends, but not enough research has been done to make any definite statements. By the 17th century, the most common placement in British burials is with the hands crossed on the pelvis, usually with the right hand on top of the left hand. This positioning is found from Anglo-Saxon times onward (Aries 1985:117; Rodwell 1989:164,171; Litten 1992:36,60,63,67). A second common placement is to lay the arms out by the side</page><page sequence="10">90 HISTORICAL ARCHAEOLOGY 43(1) of the body (Koch 1983:203; Litten 1992:203). Placing the arms across the chest with the hands on the shoulders seems to have been common in the middle ages but went out of fashion before the 17th century (Litten 1992:60). Finally, the hands were often placed on the chest as if clasped in prayer. Again, this was common in medieval burials but was abandoned in the 15th century in Britain (Rahtz 1981:119; Aries 1985:49). Placement of the hands on the chest was still common in 17th-century Spanish buri als in Florida (Koch 1983:203). Hand placement is one of the characteristics carefully noted during excavation. This feature could be observed in 28 adult burials. Three dis tinct hand placements were noted: on the pelvis, on the thighs below the pelvis, and by the sides of the thighs (Table 6). In the early period, hand placement varied widely. This variation did not correlate to sex or use of a coffin but was evenly distributed across all other variables. In the middle and late periods, the pelvis became the primary placement site. This placement was also seen in the contemporary cemetery at Patuxent Point, Maryland, where 73% of the burials were found with their hands crossed on the pelvis (King and Ubelaker 1996). In the St. Mary's cemetery, when the hands were crossed on the pelvis, the right hand was always on top of the left, following an established English tradition. There are only two examples where the hands were on the pelvis and not crossed, both from the middle period. Whether this was intentional or due to movement after the coffin was closed is unknown. Once again, there appears to be a trend in the St. Mary's data towards a standardization of the burial program. Placement of the hands on the thighs or at the sides may be part of TABLE 6 HAND PLACEMENT: ST.

In contrast, positioning the hands on the pelvis makes up only 43% of the early period observations. By the middle period, this ratio rises to 80%. As with other characteristics, burials in the cemetery at St. Mary's City carefully follow changes occurring in England at the same time, leading to an accepted manner of burial. It is here that an important point, mostly overlooked in this paper, is reintroduced. Buri als at St. Mary's City are Catholic internments. In the 17th century, English Catholics were a despised and distrusted minority in England. While the reasons for the settlement of Mary land are varied, for Catholics an important one was freedom from the restraints their minority status imposed upon them. The very existence of a Catholic church in an English colony is an anomaly. Being free of other restraints, English Catholics might be expected to follow a Catho lic burial program. Some significant evidence about burials in other Catholic colonies clarifies this point. Numerous burials have been excavated from 17th-century sites in Spanish Florida. Hand placement here follows an old Catholic tradi tion with the hands most often crossed over the chest (Larsen 1993; Koch 1983). This placement of the hands, which is known from medieval English burials, had generally disappeared from England by the 17th century. In New Orleans, the common hand placement for 18th-century French burials was at the sides (Owsley and Orser 1984:95). The people buried at St. Mary's were both Catholic and English. While main taining the rituals and beliefs of their religion, they retained the material culture and customs of their English homeland. Summary The combination of a unique structural history and an intense recording method has produced a remarkable body of information on evolving mortuary behavior in an English 17th-century context. Change in the use and construction of coffins has been investigated. Trends toward a more standardized coffin have been postulated. Significant insights on the use of burial clothing during the period have been formulated. Analysis</page><page sequence="11">TIMOTHY B. RIORDAN?"Carry Me to Yon Kirk Yard" 91 of body placement has demonstrated that the colonists' emphasized their English origins over their Catholic religion, even though the unrestricted practice of their religion was the reason many of them emigrated to Maryland. While many cemeteries were not used for such a long period or do not provide the tem poral control seen in the St. Mary's City cem etery, all burials can produce useful and detailed insights on burial practices. There is no doubt that the skeleton tells researchers much about the person buried in the grave and potentially the society of which that person was a part. The rest of the material from the grave, such as nails, pins, wood, and soil stains, however, also have as much to tell about burial practices. It is vital that any burial excavation recover this data through detailed provenience information. Thus far, not enough emphasis has been placed on these aspects of the burial ritual.
