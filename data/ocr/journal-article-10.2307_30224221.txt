<plain_text><page sequence="1">Mars as Hellenistic Lover: Lucretius, De rerum natura 1.29-40 and its Subtexts LOWELL EDMUNDS The passage discussed in this article has two kinds of Hellenistic subtext, one pictorial and the other poetic. The pictorial is represented by the fresco in the Villa of the Mysteries at Pompeii depicting Bacchus reclining on the bosom of a woman. The poetic subtext is the kind of Hellenistic epigram that describes the male lover as lying in the lap or on the bosom of the female beloved. Meleager and Philodemus provide examples. These, with the fresco, show that a Hellenistic model for the erotic schema of Mars and Venus was available to Lucretius. On this understanding, it becomes easier to explain the phrase tereti cervice (35), borrowed from Cicero's translation of the Phaenomena of Aratus. The conclu- sions to be drawn from this passage go counter to the prevailing view of a "sublime" Empedoclean Lucretius who had nothing in common with Hellenistic poetry. In the current orthodoxy, Lucretius is isolated from contemporaries both as philoso- pher and as poet. He has no connection with contemporary Epicureans.1 His sole philosophical source is Epicurus' On Nature. He is an Epicurean "fundamentalist."2 He makes no reference to contemporary Stoics. The only philosophers besides Epicurus This paper was given in a considerably different version at the University of Ferrara on Feb. 14, 2001 and at the University of Urbino the next day; in a version beginning to approach the present one as the Annual Consortial Lecture of Fordham University, New York Uni- versity and City University of New York on Nov. 10, 2001; then at the University of North Carolina on Apr. 12, 2002; and finally at Boston University on Apr. 19, 2002 at the Eighth Annual Boston Area Roman Studies Conference.

As a poet, Lucretius is again a lone wolf. He is isolated from contemporaries like Catullus, the so-called "new poets," who brought the style of Alexandrian poetry to Rome.3 Lucretius imitated the great exponents of didactic epic, Hesiod, Parmenides, and especially Empedocles. While the orthodox opinion about the philosopher is likely to be correct, the one about the poet needs further discussion. The well-known description of Mars and Venus in the proem to DRN is a case in point. The conclusions to be drawn from this passage strengthen the position of the scholars, very few in number, who have tried to counter the opinion that Lucretius had nothing in common with Hellenistic poetry.4 In one of the most famous passages in Latin literature, Lucretius praises the goddess Venus and invokes her as an ally in the writing of his poem (petition 1: aeternum da dictis, diva, leporem, 21-28). He also asks her to put an end to the works of war (petition 2: effice ut ... fera moenera militiai, 29-30).5 The second petition is much more fully developed than the first. In traditional hymnal style, Lucretius justifies it by specifying the power of the goddess: You can obtain peace because you are the one on whose bosom the god of war is often overcome by love. 29 effice ut interea fera moenera militiai 30 per maria ac terras omnis sopita quiescant. 31 nam tu sola potes tranquilla pace iuvare 32 mortalis, quoniam belli fera moenera Mavors 33 armipotens regit, in gremium qui saepe tuum se 34 reicit aeterno devictus vulnere amoris, 35 atque ita suspiciens tereti cervice reposta 36 pascit amore avidos inhians in te, dea, visus, 37 eque tuo pendet resupini spiritus ore. 38 hunc tu, diva, tuo recubantem corpore sancto 39 circumfusa super, suavis ex ore loquellas 40 funde petens placidam Romanis, incluta, pacem. 41 nam neque nos agere hoc patriai tempore iniquo 42 possumus aequo animo nec Memmi clara propago 43 talibus in rebus communi desse saluti. Bring it to pass that meantime the wild works of warfare may be lulled to 3. Cic. Att. 7.2.1 (oi vedtepot); Orat. 161 (poetae novi). Tenney Frank, "The Mutual Borrowings of Catullus and Lucretius and What They Imply," Classical Philology 28, 1933, pp. 249-56 is extremely cautious about supposed mutual borrowings. 4. The two most comprehensive statements are Leonardo Ferrero, Poetica nuova in Lucrezio (Florence: Nuova Italia, 1949) and E. J. Kenney, "Doctus Lucretius," Mnemosyne ser. IV, 23, 1970, pp. 366-92. Cf. Ettore Paratore and Ugobaldo Pizzani, Lucreti: De rerum natura (Rome: Ateneo, 1960), pp. 311-12. For Lucretius and Callimachus: Robert D. Brown, "Lucretius and Callimachus," Illinois Classical Studies 7, 1987, pp. 77-97; Harold Donohue, The Song of the Swan: Lucretius and the Influence of Callimachus (Lanham MD: University Press of America, 1993). Ferrero's monograph is essayistic, without analysis of individual passages. Though not unintelligent, it now seems a period piece-intentionalist and biographical in approach, alert to places where the poet bares his soul. 5.

For thou only canst bless mortal men with quiet peace, since 'tis Mavors, the lord of hosts, who directs the wild works of war, and he oft flings himself back upon thy lap, conquered by the eternal wound of love; and then pillowing his shapely neck upon thee and looking up he feeds with love his greedy eyes, gazing wistfully towards thee, while, as he lies back, his breath hangs upon thy lips. Do thou, god- dess, as he leans resting on thy sacred limbs, bend to embrace him and pour forth sweet petition from they lips, seeking, great lady, gentle peace for the Romans. For neither can we in our country's time of trouble set to our task with mind undistressed, nor amid such doings can Memmius' noble son fail the fortunes of the state. 6 In line with the scholarly orthodoxy described above, the picture of Mars and Venus is referred to Empedocles. The two gods are held to be refigurations of the Greek poet's Love and Strife, who in his system are the two fundamental forces in the universe 7 Further, it has been argued that the structure of the proem to DRN must reflect the structure of the proem of Empedocles' On Nature.8 The new fragments of Empedocles have only strengthened this view of the matter. Of about 52 interpretable new lines, 29 can be connected with Empedocles' description of Love and Strife in approximately the middle of Book One of On Nature.9 The editors of the new frag- ments have reaffirmed the view that the proem of DRN is modeled on Empedocles.10 Style and Tradition: Studies in Honor of Wendell Clausen, Beitrige zur Altertumskunde 92 (Stuttgart: Teubner, 1998), pp. 3-15 interprets Venus and Mars in the proem to DRN as an historical allegory: They represent Julia, Julius Caesar's daughter, and Pompey. They were married in 59; she died in 54. Julia would, Cole argues, have been able to intercede with her husband in the name of peace. This marriage, Cole observes (p. 5), also recalls the union of Ilia, granddaughter of Venus and daughter of Aeneas, and Mars. 6. The text and translation are those of Cyril Bailey, T. Lucreti Cari De rerum natura libri sex, vol. 1 (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1947). 7. For Empedoclean influence on the proem see Diskin Clay, Paradosis and Survival: Three Chapters in the History of Epicurean Philosophy (Ann Arbor: University of Michigan Press, 1998), ch. 7; Idem, Lucretius and Epicurus (Ithaca: Cornell University Press, 1983), pp. 22-23, 49-51, 88-93, 253-57. The Empedoclean reading of the description of Mars and Venus goes back at least as far as H. A. Munro, T. Lucreti De Rerum Natura Libri Sex, vol. 2 (Explanatory Notes), 4th ed. (London: G. Bell and Sons, 1886) on lines 41-43. He relied on a passage in Eustathius (Od. 310.33ff.). Bailey (n. 6 above), vol. 2, p. 590: "the implied allegory is too subtle, and is really inapplicable to the very concrete picture of this part of the poem." Sedley (n. 2 above), p. 27 n. 98 also expresses some doubt. For a critique of the Empedoclean reading, see Cole (n. 5 above), pp. 8-10. 8. Sedley (n. 2 above), pp. 1-34. Cf. G. B.

It is the physical relation of Mars to Venus. He is described as lying on the lap of Venus with his head lifted up, as she bends over him. He looks up into her eyes. This erotic schema is unparalleled in Roman literature. Beside Propertius 3.4.15 (inque sinu carae nixus ... puellae), there is no other example of a male lover lying on the lap of his beloved, except in the description of Venus and Vulcan by Vergil in Book Eight of the Aeneid (387-406), a passage that contains indubitable allusions to Lucretius and in particular to the erotic schema of Mars and Venus." (The schema seems to be post--coital in Vergil whereas in the Greek examples to be discussed below it is pre-coital.'2) The reversed schema, a woman on the lap of a man, is found several times in Roman literature.13 Carlo Giussani, the great Italian editor of Lucretius, made a speculation concern- ing Mars and Venus in the proem: "The description is so precise that it seems to visualize a work of sculpture, which Lucretius had perhaps in fact seen."14 At the time Giussani wrote his commentary on Lucretius, the Villa of the Mysteries at Pompeii was unknown. This Villa was uncovered in 1909.15 One of its rooms contains a fresco over twenty meters-long, covering the four walls. The fresco, later than the house itself, is dated to between 60 and 40 B.C.E.16 Though it is the most famous painting from the ancient world, the actions that it depicts remain uncertain.17 An initiation rite 11.

The image of Mars and Venus that the gem bears does not correspond to the erotic schema in Lucretius. - Cf. the parallel suggestion concerning Cat. 45 (Acmen Septimius suos amores) by D.F.S. Thomson, Catullus, Phoenix Supplementary vol. 34 (Toronto: Univer- sity of Toronto Press, 1997), p. 316: "The mise en scene and treatment suggest a wall painting, such as those that have survived (from a later period) at Pompeii and Hercu- laneum."

Pompeii, Villa of the Mysteries, Room 5, East Wall. Line drawing after P.B. Mudie-Cook, "The Paintings of the Villa Item at Pompeii," Journal of Roman Studies 3 (1913), fig. 25. was at first believed to be the subject, and the Villa got its name from this interpreta- tion, the word "Mysteries" referring to initiation. The scene at the focal point of the fresco depicts Bacchus reclining on the bosom of an unidentified woman (Figure 1). The iconography corresponds exactly to the tableau of Mars and Venus in Lucretius, and Giussani's hunch concerning a visual model begins to seem plausible. The identity of the woman in the fresco is an unsolved problem, exacerbated by the loss of her head. The candidates are Semele, Ariadne, and Aphrodite.18 If Aphrodite is the correct identification, the comparison with Lucretius is all the closer. But, for present purposes, more important than the identification of the woman, more important than the fact that the man is Bacchus, is the general resem- blance between the iconography as such and Lucretius' description of Mars and Ve- nus. This resemblance has not been pointed out by philologists, so far as I know, but at least one art historian has noticed it.19 A larger problem, which has dominated discussion of the fresco since its discov- ery, is its relation to an earlier original or originals. Recent discussion, as at a confer- ence on the Villa of the Mysteries held at the University of Michigan in 2000, has vindicated contextual and site-specific significance. It is safe to say, however, that, 18. Shoshanna S. Kirk, "Nuptial Imagery in the Villa of the Mysteries Frieze: South Italian and Sicilian Precedents," in: Gazda (n. 16 above), pp. 101-103.

Did Lucretius then visit Pompeii and see the fresco? Not necessarily. The iconog- raphy of the fresco was not unique in its own time, the mid-first century B.C.E. It is in fact attested in various media in the imperial period-on sarcophagi, a silver plate, a coin, and cameos.22 That all of these imperial examples derive from the fresco in the Villa of the Mysteries is most unlikely, especially when the iconography is already attested in the second century B.C.E. Lucretius could have encountered the erotic schema in some medium or other in Rome, perhaps even in the house of Gaius Memmius. Even if one cannot cite a particular work with certainty, one can speak of an antecedent in Hellenistic art for Lucretius' description of Mars and Venus. Another kind of antecedent was also available to him. It was a literary one: the Hellenistic epigram, a genre that Lucretius clearly knew.23 In this genre, the male lover is sometimes described as lying in the lap or on the bosom of the female beloved. This erotic schema can be referred to in either of two ways: by the adjective &amp;I'oK6O"iog or by the prepositional phrase ev K6X'lotatv. The basic meaning of the noun '6X)to; is "fold" or "hollow."24 In a seated position, the human body is partly folded, and c6`Rxo; refers either to the lower dimension of this fold, the lap, or to the upper dimension, the bosom. The two principal adjectival formations are i"6xoic6'io; and kyKO6Ato;. The latter, kaya6K toc, is attested only once and means not "on the bosom" but "in the bosom," i.e., mentally or emotionally.25 Likewise, the very common denominative verb EyKoknirogat means "to take into the bosom," almost always metaphorically, of men- tal or spiritual reception. Christian writers are especially fond of this word.26 So in the Hellenistic epigram, it is not the adjective &amp;yKaa6mo; but the prepositional phrase Av 20. Brendel (n. 18 above), p. 248: the composition of this scene, with the sloping position of Bacchus, betrays a Hellenistic origin.

Meleager provides an example of Ev iK6c otouv. He prays that, if someone else is lying in Heliodora's bed, he may not make love with her but cast himself on her bosom and lie there fast asleep like a second Endymion:27 Kotld00).o gv .vo;, 6 &amp; iv 'K6 xTotorv aKSiVr paittXoTOEt aaEioC 5si0EEpo; ' Ev8~toRiv.

The phrase kv K67coototv kcKEintvl )utxao0't reminds of lines 33-34 in Lucretius: in gremium qui saepe tuum se / reicit. It is probably, however, a coincidence of idioms in the two languages and not an allusion by Lucretius to Meleager. The erotic use of the adjective 1r1toK6amroq4 is more common than the phrase Ev icK6rotq. This adjective can be used of a woman on the lap of a man, or a boy on the lap of a man, or a man on the lap of a woman.28 In erotic contexts, it always refers to a physical schema and never to someone as mentally or emotionally "in the bosom" of someone else. An example of the schema man-on-lap-of-woman is found in an epi- gram of Philodemus.29 It begins: Ooodaa t KuSXi;rl flolclno6x o, icoX' Elpap E~i' do'lEor2oifoaq i l)Oov cTTEpto;, 018 6Ot KaX.

The syntax of the first two lines is unclear. Two interpretations have been proposed. One is to understand the first person of the verb "to be," Eidt, with tOKic6xhomoC, so that a new clause begins with eite. The other is to take UxoK6acrto; as a predicate adjective with the unexpressed subject of 'iueov. Both of these interpretations have difficulties.3' A third possibility would be to take 27. There are two other examples of the phrase used in this way. One, AP 5.8.6, David Sider, The Epigrams of Philodemos: Introduction, Text, and Commentary (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1997) denies to both Philodemus and Meleager, though A.S.F. Gow and D.L. Page, The Greek Anthology: Hellenistic Epigrams, vol. 2 (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1965), pp. 644-45 said that it could be either's. The other is by Philodemus: AP 5.107.8. Cf. the anonymous AP 9.362.11, of Arethusa embracing the Alpheus, where the phrase Ev Khkicotq blends the two senses of human anatomy and body of water (LSJ s.v.

Theocritus, Meleager, Philodemus, and the Villa of the Mysteries taken together, show that there existed such a model for the erotic schema described by Lucretius. Not all of these parallels can be dated precisely in relation to the DRN, but a certain number certainly antedate, or are contemporary with, the standard date, which is based on a letter of Cicero. See the chronology in Figure 2. Furthermore, it is very probable that they were known to Lucretius. If the description as a whole of Mars and Venus (31-40) is intertextual with the model, which one could call "an Hellenistic erotic schema," then it is an instance of what I have called "system reference," that is, reference to categories larger than single texts.35 On the other hand, it would be hard to deny that the static, generalized (n.b. saepe) description of Mars in lines 32-37 is an example of evidentia, vivid word-paint- ing intended to cause the reader or listener to see in the mind's eye the object depicted (Quintilian 8.3.62). As such, it would be perfectly appropriate here in a hymnal hypomnesis, where it replaces a narrative.36 As an educated Roman, Lucretius would have been trained in this technique of oratory, which is amply attested in rhetorical handbooks and theory.37 The question then arises of the object that is depicted. For Lucretius' immediate addressee, Venus, it is something in her own past which she can easily imagine. For Lucretius' secondary addressee, Memmius, the object might be particular, something that he owned or that Lucretius knew he had seen. For the tertiary addressee, the reader or listener, the description of Mars in lines 35-39 will be generic, i.e., not of any single art work but of an iconographic schema encountered more than once, perhaps even in more than one medium. Or one might go so far as to say that the tertiary addressee's knowledge of this schema allows Lucretius to create an imaginary art work. In this case, the description will be, in John Hollander's phrase, a "notional ecphrasis," whereas, for Memmius, it might have been an "actual ecphrasis."38 But in the tableau of Mars and Venus, the words of the description also allude to an earlier poetic description, itself ecphrastic. The allusion, detected long ago but never adequately explained, lies in the phrase tereti cervice (35). This phrase is bor- rowed from Cicero's indubitably earlier translation of the Phaenomena of Aratus,39 and comes from a passage describing the constellation Draco, which winds around the two Bears.40 35.

Hollander's book is, however, concerned mainly with "actual ecphrasis" in "the short poem on a particular, identifiable work of art" (p. 32). 39. Cicero was admodum adulescentulus (ND 2.104) when he translated Aratus. 40. Cicero misunderstood, or deliberately reversed, the direction of Draco's gaze in Aratus, which was downward. See Douglas Kidd, Aratus: Phaenomena (Cambridge: Cambridge</page><page sequence="10">352 International Journal of the Classical Tradition / Winter 2002 obstipum caput, a&lt;t&gt; tereti cervice reflexum, obtutum in cauda Maioris figere dicas.41 (5-6) You would say that his head, inclined to one side but bent back on slender neck, gazed fixedly on the Great Bear's tail.

So Cicero has embellished his model. What is the effect of Cicero's innovation? The adjective teres, when used of human anatomy, refers to boys or women.43 Applied to the neck of Draco, it gives the dragon a delicacy that is in contrast with his otherwise fierce nature and his large bulk. One suspects a certain irony or playfulness on Cicero's part. He uses his Hellenistic source in the same way that the Hellenistic poets often used their own models in earlier Greek literature. It is a characteristic neoteric gesture, and not surprising in Cicero, whose early neoteric tendencies are well established, no matter what he later said about the novi poetae.44 To return to Lucretius, his allusion to Cicero is a substantial one. With tereti cervice reposta in line 35 Lucretius has taken over the second half of Cicero's hexameter, rewriting reflexum with reposta. Various effects of the allusion can be suggested. First, it does for Mars what Cicero's phrase did for Draco: it reduces the savage aspect of the University Press, 1997), p. 198 on line 58; and Lucretius follows Cicero, as he must, given the erotic schema. 41. Cicero Aratea fr. 9 Soubiran (from Cic. ND 2.107). Jean Soubiran, Cicero: Aratea; fragments pogtiques (Paris: Les Belles Lettres, 1972), pp. 74-76 argues against the old view that all similarities between Lucretius and Cicero are parallel imitations of Ennius. He also ex- presses a general skepticism about the similarities as signs of influence of Cicero on Lucretius. In his short list of likely examples of influence, he does not include tereti cervice. Luciano Canfora, Vita di Lucrezio (Palermo: Sellerio, 1993), pp. 89-90 discusses some Lucretian allu- sions to Cicero's translation. 42. Kidd (n. 40 above). 43. As Monica R.

But, as Kubiak cautions, one should not think of the Aratea as a neoteric poem.</page><page sequence="11">Edmunds 353 creature it describes. Second, it has a certain irony, momentarily creating a comparison of Mars to the Draco of Cicero and Aratus. The amorous Mars assumes the same posture in relation to Venus as the "awesome monster" Draco in relation to the Great Bear. The vast difference in scale between the anthropomorphic Mars and the constel- lation has a humorous effect. Third, the quotation of Cicero's tereti cervice in itself has a neoteric elegance and sets the tone for the passage, which, as I have argued, has a Hellenistic model. If Lucretius' borrowing from Cicero is not sufficient evidence of the phrase's stylistic value, Vergil's further borrowing, of course with irony of his own, confirms the point. It occurs, like the description of Venus and Vulcan already men- tioned, in Book Eight of the Aeneid. On the shield of Aeneas, the she-wolf turns her head tereti cervice reflexa to lick Romulus and Remus (633).45 Fourth, the quotation establishes a particular relation between Lucretius and Cicero. As the translator of Aratus, Cicero was the pioneer in composing hexameter verse in Latin on a scientific subject. Lucretius' allusion to Cicero's translation of the Phaenomena can be seen as a recognition of his precedence in this field. To repeat, Lucretius has in fact chosen a phrase that is original with Cicero. Fifth, this allusion, like the tableau as a whole, may be an indirect form of communication to the secondary addressee of this passage, Memmius. If Memmius had C. Helvius Cinna and Catullus in his retinue (as he did in 57 B.C.E.), one can make an inference about his taste in poetry. If the allusion I have been discussing was for the delectation of Memmius, then Phillip Mitsis' picture of Memmius as a nepios undergoing didactic coercion would have to be qualified.46 In the same way, the even subtler and more complex allusion to Simonides in line 24 of the proem, which was discovered by James O'Hara, may presuppose a much more sophis- ticated Memmius than do Lucretius' direct addresses to his patron.47 Memmius was after all known for his preference for Greek over Latin poetry (Cic. Brut. 247) and wrote love poetry himself (Ov. Tr. 2.433; Gell. 19.9.7).48 Someone might, however, want to argue that these allusions are a form of communication between Lucretius and the reader that takes place behind the back of Memmius. The intertextual phenomenon under discussion belongs to a literary-historical pattern that can be observed in a poet contemporary with Lucretius. The pattern is this: Hellenistic astronomy - Hellenistic astronomy in Hellenistic verse - Latin trans- lation or imitation - and finally Vergilian allusion. The contemporary poet is Catullus, and the poem is 66, "The Lock of Berenice." The source of the Hellenistic astronomy in 45. Vergil's allusion is characteristically complex. The verb is an allusion to Cat. 45.10: at Acme leviter caput reflectens. Cf. n. 14 above. - On the basis of Servius ad Aen. 8.630ff. (sane totus hic locus Ennianus est), it has been inferred that the phrase is Ennian; therefore that in Lucretius it is an example of borrowing parallel to Cicero's (cf. Soubiran n. 41 above). Servius' comment does not, however, mean that every word in the passage came from Ennius. Is one to imagine that Vergil simply quoted several lines of Ennius? 46.

Conon's discov- ery of a new constellation offered Callimachus the chance for an astronomical explana- tion of the recent disappearance of a lock of Queen Berenice's hair. Catullus in poem 66 then translated or closely imitated Callimachus,49 and Vergil then famously alluded to line 39 of Catullus 66 in Aeneid 6. Aeneas says to Dido in the underworld, invitus, regina, tuo de litore cessi (460). It is one of the most difficult allusions in Latin poetry, and nothing will here be added to the vast discussion. This chapter of Roman literary history is adduced simply to provide a neoteric parallel to Lucretius' tereti cervice. It was necessary to refer to the inspiration for the erotic schema as "Hellenistic." But certain features of the passage, like the allusion to Cicero, are more precisely neoteric. The diminutive loquellas in line 39, which Bailey took as a sign of "the influ- ence of [Lucretius'] Alexandrinizing contemporaries," is an example.50 Likewise, word- order that has been defined as neoteric on the basis of its frequency in Catullus 64 appears in this passage: attribute before the caesura with substantive at the end of the line (36 and 40). Another neoteric pattern appears in line 34: attribute attribute sub- stantive substantive, in the pattern abAB.51 One also notices the imagistic word order of tuo recubantem corpore sancto (38).52 It is notable that all of these neoteric features are grouped in the eight lines within petition 2 (33b-40) that present the Hellenistic tableau of Mars and Venus and further that these lines are framed, again within petition 2, by lines showing archaizing fea- tures: the alliteration and assonance of lines 29-33a, the archaic spelling of moenera, the archaic form of the genitive militiai, the archaic form Mavors, and the epithet armipotens, which is attested in Accius.53 Archaic features return in the last line of the tableau with incluta (40), precisely at the point at which the hymnal style of the petition is resumed. Then comes another archaic form of the genitive, patriai (41). The tableau of Mars and Venus as a whole thus appears as an Alexandrinizing composition set in an archaic frame. Lucretius has marked off the dimensions of an ecphrasis, whether actual, refer- 49. The line corresponding to Cat. 66.39 is not among the frags. of Callimachus' poem (Aet. IV fr. 110 Pf.). 50.

It remains to return from the part to the whole, to see the tableau of Mars and Venus in the context of the proem from the beginning up to the tableau. Aeneadum genetrix (1) invokes Venus, the mother of the Roman race, the Venus of legend. She, who united with the mortal Anchises, is also, still in the first line, hominum divomque voluptas, a common denominator of human and divine pleasure. It is the Venus who, as in the Homeric Hymn to Aphrodite, "inspires sweet desire in gods, and overcomes the tribes of mortal men" (2-3). In her third attribute, she is alma Venus, "fostering" or "life-giving" Venus, whose sphere is caeli subter labentia signa. The hymnal relative pronoun (3) is going to lead to a description of Venus on earth. She is, it emerges, the one who "alone guides the nature of things," to leap forward to line 21, where quae resumes the quae of line 3.7" The poet therefore now calls upon her to be his ally as he writes about the nature of things (lines 24-25). In attributing this power to Venus, Lucretius is often taken to be inconsistent with the atomic theory that he expounds further on. What Lucretius has in mind is indicated by generatim in line 20. Venus in effect provides a link between physics and biology: she ensures that the combinations of atoms will result in the species of living things that we see. In this cursory reading, however, I am following not the theology of Lucretius but the complex development of the hymnal elements traditional in Greek and Latin prooemia.55 Lucretius, it turns out, is both praising the goddess in the manner of a cult hymn and simultaneously calling upon her for poetic aid in the manner of a rhapsodic hymn.56 But unlike the Muse, who is called upon to give the poet or rhapsode the poem, and unlike the god or goddess who in the Homeric Hymns is called upon to give victory in the contest (e.g. h. Hom. 6.19-20),57 Lucretius calls upon Venus to give charm (leporem, 28) to his words.58 Catullus uses the same word in the same grammatical case, leporem, of his own verse in poem 16.7.59 Commentators on Lucretius refrain from citing Catullus poem 16, probably because it is obscene and also because it is in hendecasyllabics. But the contexts in Lucretius and Catullus are similar: both poets are referring to their verse's capacity to excite the feelings of men who are potentially indifferent.60 54.

He uses this word, by implication, of the verse of his friend, the poet Licinius, in poem 50.7. 60. The charm that Lucretius seeks from Venus for his poetry corresponds to the venustas that Catullus perceives in the beginning of a friend's poem: he uses the adverb venuste (35.17).</page><page sequence="14">356 International Journal of the Classical Tradition / Winter 2002 In the second petition Lucretius asks that as he writes (interea, 29) Venus may bring war to a stop. And then comes the passage analyzed in this article. It is intro- duced by another hymnal relative, qui (33), and, in terms of hymnal conventions, it is a hypomnesis. Further, in keeping with the attributes of Venus specified at the outset, it is an illustration of voluptas divum. But this second petition, with its neoteric ecphrasis, is also an instant fulfillment of the charm that Lucretius asked for in the first petition. Indeed it shows the specifically neoteric charm that the word lepor / lepos predicted. How does Lucretius' procedure compare with the tradition of the proem in this re- spect? Traditionally, in the proem the poet asks a divinity for assistance, and the request is a way of defining the poet's subject matter or aim. And, as the poem then shows, the divinity does not fail him. In fact, the poet's request produces instant results. Lucretius has done nothing different. He has asked Venus for charm and has then proceeded to display the charm that he asked for. It is time to turn to a question or objection that might arise concerning the Alexandrian or neoteric aspect of the tableau of Mars and Venus which I have empha- sized. This aspect ought in a proem to be programmatic, and I have suggested that the tableau is the immediate fulfillment of the charm for which the poet asked Venus and thus implicitly a definition of that charm. But one does not think of Lucretius as a neoteric poet. On the contrary, one thinks of him as archaizing and, as suggested at the outset, out of touch with contemporary movements in Latin poetry. It would be foolish to attempt to reverse the current orthodoxy and to say that Lucretius is a neoteric poet. It would be rash to say that the ecphrastic neoteric passage in the proem is programmatic. But, in addition to all the other effects he achieves in the proem, Lucretius succeeds in putting his reader on notice that he is well aware of contemporary trends and can follow them if he wishes to do so. Another example of this awareness appears in Book Four, when he expounds the "idols" as a background to the physiology of vision. He begins with a miniature proem: suavidicis potius quam multis versibus edam; parvus ut est cycni melior canor, ille gruum quam clamor in aetheriis dispersus nubibus austri. (180-82 = 909-911) I will proclaim in verses of sweet discourse rather than in many; even as the brief song of the swan is better than the clamour of cranes, which spreads among the clouds of the south high in heaven.61 Lucretius here alludes to two lines of Antipater of Sidon (AP 7.713.7-8), a poet of epigrams and, through Antipater, to Callimachus.62 The allusion is thus in keeping with the famous passage at the end of Book One of Lucretius, avia Pieridum peragro loca See C. Joachim Classen, "Poetry and Rhetoric in Lucretius," Transactions and Proceedings of the American Philological Association 99, 1968, p. 103 for uses of venus, venustas, venustus, and venustulus of style in Plautus, Cicero, and Horace. Classen does not include Catullus in this list. 61. Bailey (n. 6 above). 62. The matter is succinctly stated by J.K. Newman, Rev. of C.W. Mendell, Latin Poetry: The New Poets and the Augustans (New Haven: Yale University Press, 1965), Latomus 26, 1967, p. 525.</page><page sequence="15">Edmunds 357 nullius ante / trita solo, etc. (926-27), where the echo of Callimachus is unmistakable.63 Although the allusion to Antipater of Sidon has been pointed out several times in the past century, it has received scant discussion.64 The neglect of this Alexandrinizing passage is a reflex of a long-standing preoccupation with the passion of the poet, with the "anti-Lucretius" in Lucretius, with the sublimity of the poetry. Within the past ten years, the note has been sounded again by Gian Biaggio Conte in an essay on the "sublime reader" of Lucretius who, according to Conte, is demanded by the sublime style.65 A more balanced picture is found already in Cicero's agreement with Quintus' description of Lucretius: multis luminibus ingeni, multae tamen artis.66 And again in a phrase used by Statius in the Silvae: docti furor arduus Lucreti, "the towering frenzy of learned Lucretius" (Silv. 2.7.76). The furor of the poet has inspired the one-sided recep- tion just described. The adjective doctus might refer, however, not only to Epicurean content but also to Alexandrinizing aspects of style. These are precisely the aspects that are neglected in favor of furor. The reader of Lucretius must be not only sublime but also attentive to the subtle effects of intertextuality.

He is consistently enamoured of the boy Giton, and he is also the protagonist of several erotic farces. As for these farces, it should be recalled that K6X1to; refers, in medical writers, to the womb and to the vagina.69 The Petronian narrative causes the reader to literalize the name and to understand it as meaning "the one who is Ev K6aoC6p." Encolpius is the one who is, or would like to be, in the KO6AXo of others.70 Appendix 2: AP 5.25.1-3 = 15.1-3 Sider Of the interpretations summarized above, the first is that of Gow and Page, who understood eijt with l'OK6Oxmo,/ "confining ijXueov to the following clause."71 This interpretation is probably ruled out by the unlikelihood of the omission of the verb "to be" in the first person singular. The second interpretation also presents difficulties. nooic6-ato; is understood to be in the same construction with aimrptoio which is a predicate adjective of time. This kind of predicate adjective is a very familiar usage. Its trait, and that of several other kinds of predicate adjectives (place, sequence, quantity, etc.), is that they do not provide a closer determination of the subject but qualify the predicate of the sentence.72 For example, icaazaPavov aicoza^ot "they descended in the dark," not "they, the dark ones, descended" (Xen., A. 4.1.10). (This example comes from Smyth 1042.) If one applies this principle--reference to predicate, not to subject- to i'Moi6cXito;, then we have to understand, following an interpretation that Gow and Page reject, something like it6 trolq Ku iXXqr; K6o~Xouh ih'XkOov "I came into Kydilla's bosom." Sider's interpretation is the same as the second one just discussed: "Xi0ueov is to be taken adr6 oKotvoI with IxnoxK6Xto; and koaniptog." He cites Hom. Od. 9.451-52 as a parallel, but in this passage one of the adjectives goes with the subject, the other with the predicate. He translates: "All the times I dare whether by day or evening to come to rest on Kydilla's bosom 73 Non liquet. 68.
