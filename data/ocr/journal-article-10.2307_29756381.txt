<plain_text><page sequence="1">Dwelling-and Storage-Pits at Loebanr III (Swat, Pakistan) 1976 Excavation Report by Giorgio Stacul In the autumn of 1976, in the framework of the IsMEO activity in Sw?t (Centro Studi e Scavi Archeologici in Asia), excavation was resumed at Loebanr III O, on the same flat-topped hill where pits dug in the natural soil were discovered in 1968 (2). The physical features of the excavation sectors (figs. 1, 2, 22), are closely similar to those of the previous site. The main sector (area A), 17 X 15m., is situated on a slightly sloping ground level, with its northern end only a few metres from the steep slope of the hill. Four trial-trenches (areas B, C, D and E), 3.50X3 m. each were dug in the southern, eastern and western sides of the main excavation. At thirty metres from the area A, in the eastern side, there is the 1968 excavation (area AA). The Excavations Before the excavation works, begun on the 10th September 1976, the terrace-cultivated ground was planted with maize. The surface layer, stirred by recent ploughing, varied from 0.20 to 0.35 m. in thickness (layer ?). The layer below consists of loose grey or brown-grey earth, with charcoal flakes, fragments of animal bones, potsherds and other archaeological finds (layer ?). Beneath the grey earth is mixed with yellow clay and in? cludes fragments of animal bones and potsherds (layer ?). On the lower side of the area, near the steep slope of the hill, layer ? covers the natural soil, which consists of a thick bank of compact clay. On the upper side, where layers ? and ? are not preserved, the natural soil is covered by the surface layer only. In the areas B and C too, only the surface layer covers the natural soil. In the northwestern side of area A, the remains of two walls made of river pebbles rested on layers ? and ? (figs. 3, 25). They were preserved at the base only. In rela? tion to the walls, traces of a clayey floor-level have been found at the base of layer ?. (*) The drawings are by Mr Giusto Almeri gogna and the photographs by the author. Both drawings and photographs are filed in the archives of the Museo Nationale d'Arfce Orientale, Rome. (x) The excavations were directed by the author, with the collaboration of Dr Bruno Compagnoni, paleontologist, and Mr Giusto Almerigogna, draughtsman; Mr Muhammad Meharban was assigned to the Mission by Department of Ar? chaeology and Museums, Government of Pakistan.

Remains of dry-stone walls at the base of layer (2) (north-western side of the area A). The Pits 2 and 5 are marked by a broken line. A large hollow, as well as pits and holes, had been dug in the natural soil (figs. 4-8, 23-31). On the basis of the different shapes and dimensions, there may be distinguished: 1) a large pit where the main axis greatly exceeded the depth (Hut A); 2) a medium-sized pit, circular in plan, where the depth exceeded the diameter (Pit 1); 3) medium-sized pits, circular or oval in plan, where the diameter or the main axis exceeded the depth (Pits 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8); 4) holes irregular in plan and with different depths (post-holes and others). Only in a few small areas has the original floor-level been preserved in relation to the above-mentioned pits. In consequence of the weathering an upper portion of the natural soil had been eroded and only the very bases of the post-holes have survived. The largest erosion may be surveyed in the northernmost side of the excavation area, near the steep slope of the hill. Hut A The main pit, a large and shallow hollow, labelled "Hut A", lay almost in the centre of the excavation area. The hollow was irregular-oval in plain (7.70 X 6.40 m.), 229</page><page sequence="4">p,t7 _ ^ ?.-. Fig. 4 - Loebanr III.

Stratigraphic section D-Dl. with almost vertical edges and with different depths (from about 0.60-0.70 m. in the south? ern zone to 0.40-0.50 m. in the northern one). The filling was a dark brown humus, particularly rich in fragments of animal bones, fragments of clay or daub and archaeological finds (layer ?). A large fire-place, almost circular in plan (diam. c. 3 m.), lay on the southern side. It consisted of alternate strips of charcoal and ash and with a great quantity of lumps of red clay (the maximum thickness of the strips was about 0.35 m.). At the base of the layer, in the central and northern side, the floor-level consisted of a thin clayey earth mixed with small fragments of pottery; it rested on the natural soil. A rich variety of archaelogical finds has been found near the base of the fill-layer and particularly on the floor-level near the fire-place: large and middle-sized pots (Inv. nos. LIII 96-99, 101, 103-106, 108, 123-126, 128, 142-144, 151, 152, 155-158), minia? ture pots (Inv. nos. LIII 96, 102, 130), bone artifacts (Inv. nos. LIII 113, 121, 127, 137, 139, 141, 149), human terracotta figurines (Inv. nos. LIII 92, 129), animal terracotta figurines (Inv. nos. LIII 93-95, 131-136, 148), terracotta objects (Inv. nos. LIII 90, 91, 109-111, 122), a stone celt (Inv. no. LIII 112) and a jade bead (Inv. no. LIII 100). Par? ticularly numerous, on the floor-level, also fragments of daub and of animal bones. Small lapis lazuli fragments have been found too. Pit 1 It is almost circular in plan, with well-defined edges and flat base (2.85 m. deep). The diameter at the top (2.45 X 2.40 m.) is about the same as at the base (2.40 X 2.35 m.). The maximum diameter (2.75 m.) is about half way down. The pit has been plastered with thin layers of fine clay. 232</page><page sequence="7">In the fill the following layers may be distinguished, from the bottom (fig. 7): Layer ?. The bottommost fill (about 0.20-0.25 in thickness) consists in a series of thin lenses of fine grey sandy clay, the undulations of which may be due to standing-water deposits. It included only a few fragments of pottery. Layer ?. It consists of about 0.95 m. of light grey earth mixed with lumps of yellow clay. Charcoal flakes, potsherds, fragments of daub and of animal bones have been col? lected at different levels. It included also a large, almost complete pot (Inv. no. LIII 56) and small fragments of lapis lazuli. Layer ?. It consists of about 0.70 m. of alternate bands of red-brown earth, ashes and charcoal mixed with lumps of solid red clay. These remains, indicative of a fire-place, are more pronounced in the central area of the pit. The presence at different levels of large and middle-sized pots (Inv. nos. LIII 18, 31, 36, 53, 54, 55), bone objects (Inv. nos. LIII 14, 15, 16, 17, 19) and a human terracotta figurine (Inv. no. LIII 20), as well as fragments of animal bones, would represent a period of intense activity. Layer ?. It consists of about 0.30 m. of grey earth with bands of ash and charcoal flakes. It contains pots (Inv. nos. LIII 9, 10, 12), potsherds, fragments of daub and of animal bones. Layer ?. The uppermost fill of the pit consists of loose earth with thin bands of ash and charcoal. Potsherds, fragments of daub and of animal bones have been collected at different levels. In the central area of the pit the maximum thickness of the layer is about 0.50 m. Pits 2 and 5 The contiguity of the Pits 2 and 5 and the distinctive features of their filling suggest a complementary function of those structures. Pit 2 is oval in plan (3.75 X 3.20 m. at the top), with concave or almost vertical edges and well-defined base (depth 1.35-1.45 m.). The upper part of the northwestern side of the pit, near the end of the excavation area and near the slope of the hill, in conse? quence of the erosion is not conserved (lumps of the natural clayey soil have been found in the fill of the pit). Pit 5 is circular-oval in plan (3.20 X 2.90 at the top), with almost vertical edges and almost flat base (max. depth 0.65 m.). The northernmost portion of the pit has been intersected by Pit 2, or Pit 5 was superimposed on the southern most portion of Pit 2. However the nature of the fill of both pits shows a common contemporary use. From the bottom the stratigraphical sequence of the fill is as follows (fig. 8): L?yer ?. The basal lining of both pits consisted of fine grey sandy clay, the undu? lations of which may be due to standing-water deposits (this feature is particularly evident in Pit 2). The fill included a few fragments of pottery and a few charcoal flakes. Layer ?. It consists of grey or dark-grey earth with lenses of ash and charcoal. At the base of the layer, in Pit 2, the compact grey-brown earth mixed with small fragments of pottery is indicative of floor-level. Pots and other artifacts have been collected at dif 233</page><page sequence="8">ferent levels and particularly at the base of the layer. They include medium-sized pots (Inv. nos. LIU 37, 43, 44, 64, 69, 71-73, 105-107), miniature pots (Inv. nos. LIII 49, 50, 59, 146, 147), human terracotta figurines (Inv. nos. LIII 32, 41), a stone celt (Inv. no. LIII 63), a grinding stone (Inv. no. LIII 45) and bone objects (Inv. nos. LIII 61, 67, 81). Fragments of daub and of animal bones were particularly abundant. Layer ?. It consists of loose grey earth with charcoal remains and ash. It contains pots (Inv. nos. LIII 57, 70, 153), bone objects (Inv. nos. LIII 24, 27-29), fragments of daub and of animal bones. The remains of two stone walls described previously rested on the surface of the layer. Pit 3 Located in the northeastern side of the excavation area, only half of it has been exca? vated. Circular or oval in plan (diam. 1.85 at the top), with well-defined edges and flat base (depth 0.65 m.). The filling consists of light grey earth with only a few potsherds and fragments of animal bones (layer ?). Pit 4 Beehive-shaped pit almost circular in plan (top diam. 1.95 m. and bottom diam. 2.75 m.), with well-defined edges and base (depth 1.25 m.). The filling consists of two layers: the lower of grey sandy clay (layer ?) and the upper of ash with a few charcoal flakes (layer ?). Only very few potsherds and fragments of animal bones were included in the filling layers. Pit 6 Almost circular in plan (top diam. 1.75 X 1.70 m. and bottom diam. 1.60 X 1.65 m.). The filling consists of loose grey earth with some bone objects (Inv. nos. LIII 82 84), only a few potsherds and fragments of animal bones. Pit 7 Circular in plan (top diam. 2.85 m. and bottom diam. 2.60 X 2.70 m.), with almost regular edges and base (depth 0.30-0.35 m.). The filling consists of loose grey earth with few potsherds. Pit 8 Almost circular in plan (top diam. 1.50 X 1.45 m. and bottom diam. 1.35 X 1.25 m.) with ill-defined edges (depth 0.25-0.30 m.). The filling consists of loose grey earth with very few potsherds. Post-holes About twenty post-holes and stake-holes were uncovered in area A, dug in the natural soil. The largest one had a diameter of about 0.50 m. and the depth varied from 0.20 to 234</page><page sequence="9">0.35 m. In some cases the interior rings of the tree were clearly distinguished. Most of the holes were irregular in plan with ill-defined edges. Their distribution is confined almost exclusively to the lower side of the excavation, near the pits 1, 2 and 4. It is difficult however to reconstruct a regular plan in relation to the probable roofing of the pits. The use of roofing structures of reeds or stakes has been attested by the very large quantity of daub fragments. Areas B, C, D, E In the area B the surface layer covers the natural soil. Into this soil, a shallow cir? cular or oval pit had been dug (depth 0.25-0.30 m.). Only a portion of the pit has been included in the excavation area. The filling consists of loose grey earth mixed with yellow brown clay and with a few potsherds only. In the area C, located in the middle of the terrace, and in the areas D and E, near the slope of the hill, no traces of pits or post-holes have been found. Pottery The excavation yielded the classes of pottery evidenced during the previous works of 1968, that is to say: A) Gritty Ware from brown to grey in colour. Hard clay with a large amount of tempering materials included. Coarse to sandy on the external surfaces. Generally with rippled or notched rims and with basket impressions on the external surface of the base. Turned on a slow wheel. ?) Black-Grey and Buff Burnished Ware, frequently with mottled surfaces. Hard clay, fine in texture, containing a small amount of sand and other tempering materials. The highly lustrous surfaces of some pots could have been achieved by some process of turning. C) Red Ware. Light red slip on smoothed surfaces often painted with black bands. Hard clay, sometimes very fine in texture. It is generally turned on a fast wheel. D) Brown Ware. Hard clay with sand and other tempering materials included. It is generally used for the handmade miniature pots. Among some 8000 fragments of pottery collected, about 60 per cent consists of Black Grey Burnished Ware and less than 2 per cent of Red Ware. The shapes are the following: ? very large wide-mouthed pot with slightly flared rim (fig. 9.1); ? large jar with almost globular body and slightly flared rim (figs. 9.2-5; 32; 33); ? large jar with ovoidal body, flared rim and disk-base (figs. 11.5,6; 34; 35); ? medium-sized pot with ovoidal body, slightly flared rim and disk-base (figs. 10.1 3,8; 36-38); ? medium-sized pot with globular body, flared or out-turned rim (fig. 11.1-4); ? bowl with flared sides and flat or slightly concave base (figs. 12, 39-41); 235</page><page sequence="10">Fig. 9 - Brown Gritty jars from Loebanr III. 1: from Hut A, layer ?; 2: Inv. no.

The most common types of vases, including the fragments as well, are the large and medium-sized jars, as has been attested in the previous excavation. Rippled or notched rims and basket impressions on the bases are very common on the Gritty Ware. Among the fine middle-sized pots, the most common shapes are the bowl with flared sides, the carinated bowl, the narrow-mouthed vessel and the bowl set on conical pedestal. As in the previous excavation, the other types of vases are seldom attested, with the exception of the small globular or ovoidal pot with flared rim. The Black on Red Painted Ware, very fine in texture and turned on a fast wheel, makes up a very small percentage of the finds. The decoration, which consists of geometrical patterns, includes simple horizontal bands (figs. 10.9, 14.13, 15.10, 54) and a chess-board motif (fig. 56). Stone Objects The stone objects include a green jade bead, biconical in shape (fig. 18.1); two po? lished celts, partly damaged, in granite (figs. 18.3; 66) and serpentine (fig. 18.4); a frag? ment of discoidal granite pebble with central hole (fig. 18.11), a schist pendant (fig. 18.5) and some almost discoidal schist objects with central hole (fig. 18.6-10).

Completely polished is a flat handle (?) too (figs. 19.3; 61), decorated with incised straight and zig-zag lines on both sides. Among the other bone artifacts there are some points or awls (figs. 19.4-6; 65), some awls made from either the proximal or distal end of the metacarpal or metatarsal bones of sheep or goat (figs. 19.7,9-11; 63; 64) and two flattened perforators, probably used as spatulas too (figs. 19.8; 62). Terracotta Figurines Six human terracotta figurines, brown on the surface, were recovered (figs. 20.1-6; 57 59). Only one is complete (figs. 20.4; 58); in the other ones the upper part or the head is missing. The following types may be distinguished: ? flattened figurine with the body almost rectangular in outline (figs. 20.1; 57); ? flattened figurine with concave sides and with a slight thickening at the base for standing (figs. 20.2,5,6; 59); ? flattened figurine with convex sides, almost oval head and nose (figs. 20.4; 58). Among the fourteen animal figurines collected, brown to grey on the surface, only six are reasonably complete and represent the humped bull (fig. 20.7-12). Other Terracotta Objects The other terracotta objects, grey to brown on the surface, include: ? a spoon with short handle (fig. 17.10); ? a bobbin with almost concave sides and with the end hollowed out (fig. 17.11); ? three disks (as in fig. 17.12); ? some almost discoidal potsherds with central hole (as in fig. 17.13); ? seven biconical or almost biconical spindle-whorls (fig. 17.14-18); ? one almost globular spindle-whorl (fig. 17.19). 2 Fig. 21 - Copper (fig. 21.1) and iron (fig. 21.2) objects from Loebanr III. 1: Inv. no.

Commentary The archaeological evidences consent some deductions about the purpose of the hollows discovered. The largest hollow formed a hut foundation with a large fire-place and ample traces of floor-levels. The great number of artifacts and fragments of animal bones collected here is clear evidence of an intense settled activity. The room was used for dwelling pur? poses and probably as sleeping quarters too. The large quantities of daub fragments were most probably in relation to wooden roofing materials (reed or stake impressions are clear on one side of the clay daub). However the almost complete absence of post-holes does not consent deductions as regards the nature of the roofing. Pit 1 was probably used originally as storage. We can reasonably deduce this from the nature of the filling of layer ?. The charcoal flakes at different levels may be the result of successive fires in order to remove excess moisture and to kill the micro fauna. The occupation levels of layer ? on the contrary suggest a different purpose. Dur ing this period the pit was used as a fire-place and maybe for other dwelling activities too. The main object of the pit during the following period is uncertain. However the filling of layers ? and 0 suggests a prevalent use as a fire-place. Pits 2 and 5 formed just one composite room, partly similar to the hollow discovered in 1968. It seems evident that the artifacts and the fauna remains at the base of layer ? are indicative of intense settled activity. Pit 4 seems to have been used as a fire-place only. It is significant in this connec? tion that the filling of layer ? consists of ash and charcoal with very few remains of pot? tery or fauna. The use of Pits 3, 6, 7 and 8 is uncertain. It is possible that the loose earth filling, with very few archaeological remains may be explained by the cleaning of the pits, all very shallow. On account of their shallowness a possible use of the pits as storage seems improbable. If the area A represented the central part of the settlement (as it is suggested by its topographical location on the terrace and on the basis of the other excavation surveys and soundings), we can consider the Hut A the main dwelling place with the surround? ing pits used as storage and for other working purposes. Another large dwelling place consisted in the hollows discovered in 1968. However the nature of the filling and the finds collected in this last place suggest secondary activities or a shorter occupation in comparison with the area A. It has been already observed that the collected artifacts represent an homogeneous 250</page><page sequence="25">complex. The iron arrow-head only may be considered as intrusive. In particular there is no significant difference between the pottery from the bottommost fill-layers of the pits and that from the upper layers. Therefore it is confirmed that the occupation phase at Loebanr III was relatively short, ascribed to the same cultural period. As it was evident in the excavation of 1968, the occupation phase is related to the Period IV in the sequence of the protohistorical cultures in the Swat Valley. The pottery collected was of the same kind as in the previous excavation. It included mostly Black-Grey Burnished and Brown-Grey Gritty Wares, with only a little Black-on-Red Painted Ware. However some new types of shapes and some complete or almost complete pots have been attested. Of particular interest, besides, some types of human terracotta figurines, some polished bone objects and the presence of green jade and lapis lazuli. On previous occasions we stressed some affinities between the Periods III and IV in the Sw?t Valley and the Neolithic phases I and II of Burzahom in Kashmir. These affini? ties were based on the common use in Kashmir and in Sw?t of the Black-Grey Burnished and the Brown Gritty Wares, including some particular types of pots with rippled rim and mat- or basket-impressions on the base (3). The recent discovery at Loebanr III of various shapes of dwelling- and storage-pits, partly similar to the pits of Burzahom, tends to confirm the validity and the significance of these provisional correlations. The connections between Sw?t and Kashmir during the first half of the 2nd millen? nium B.C. involve the relationships between the cultures of the north-western regions of the Indian subcontinent and the late Neolithic cultures of northern China. According to Thapar and other scholars, the Neolithic culture of Kashmir shows close links with China (4). This assumption is based on the common existence of pit-dwellings and some particular types of blade and bone tools in China and in Kashmir. Among the bone and stone artifacts, particular significance can be attached to the discovery at Burzahom of several rectangular and semi-lunar perforated knives, almost identical to the common perforated knives in the late Neolithic cultures of northern China (5). The excavations in the Sw?t Valley and the recent works at Loebanr III in particular provide new elements of study and comparison in this connection. The discovery at Loebanr III of two green jade beads, out of a total of three stone beads collected in 1968 and 1976, seems particularly significant. It must be remembered indeed that no jade objects have been discovered in the 475 graves of Loebanr, K?telai and Butkara II, ascribed to the subsequent Periods V, VI and VII, where there has been found a total of forty-four stone beads, most of which carnelian (6). And no jade objects have been discovered in the layers of the settlement of Aligr?ma ascribed to the Periods V and VI. (3) G.

Stacul, The Proto Historic Graveyards of Sw?t [Pakistan), (Ismeo RepMem, III 1), Rome, 1972. 251</page><page sequence="26">In addition to Loebanr III, green jade has been attested in the Swat Valley at Gh? ligai only, significantly included in a layer ascribed to the Period IV. The jade object from Gh?llgai consists in a comma-shaped ornament with hole (fig. 18.2) (7), of a shape known by its Japanese name: magatama (8). The magatama was a typical bead in the Korean and Japanese graves of the last centuries B.C., but prototypes of the same shape are attested by Neolithic cultures of China (9). In this connection the recent excavation at Loebanr III furnished other interesting elements of comparison. We refer to the two polished bone hair-pins with anthropomor? phic (?) head (figs. 19.1,2). A significant affinity may be noticed between the pin in fig. 19.2 and a type from a Shang layer at Cheng-chom (10). On the base of the archaeological evidences in Kashmir, cultural connections with nor? thern China go back to the second half of the 3rd millennium B.C. (X1). During the 3rd millennium or previously similar influences probably gave rise to the cultural horizon of Period I of Sarai Khola near Taxila (12). As regards our documentation in the Swat Valley, the suggested stylistical influences from China may be ascribed to the first half of the 2nd millennium B.C., not after the end of Period IV. Intensive excavations and surveys in graveyards and settlements ascribed to the subsequent protohistorical periods tend to con? firm this assumption. The break of the above-mentioned relations with China may be due to the spread of subsequent influences from the northern Iranian Plateau to the north-west Indian subcon? tinent. In the Sw?t Valley, the greatest archaeological evidence of these new influences has been given by the large and swift spreading of the Black-Grey Burnished stylistical horizon during Period IV, clearly documented at Loebanr III. The graveyard of Kherai, ascribed to this period, significatively attests inhumation in contracted position (13). These collected evidences suggest not only the spreading of a new stylistical horizon, but cultural and probably ethnical changes too. New influences from northern Iran are clearly evidenced in the Sw?t Valley and beyond during the subsequent protohistoric periods, as in the graveyards of Loebanr, K?telai, But kara II and Timargarha, or in the settlements of Aligr?ma and Balambat, when the use of the dwelling-pits and of some types of bone tools common at Loebanr III have not been attested, but on the contrary the presence of new types of artifacts testify close connec? tions with western cultures.
