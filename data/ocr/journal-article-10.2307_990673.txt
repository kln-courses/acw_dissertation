<plain_text><page sequence="1">MANFREDO TAFURI, Venice and the Renaissance, translated by Jessica Levine, Cambridge, Mass.: MIT Press, 1990, xii + 296 pp., 147 illus. $35.00 This is the English translation of Venezia e il Rinascimento, published in Italy in 1985. The neutral title gives little indication of the sharpness of Tafuri's scalpel as, in a collection of seven essays, he dissects the relationship between the myth of Venice and its cinquecento reality, between an image of a putative ideal Renaissance city and the tortuous routes by which physical change was in fact wrought on the capital's fabric. Tafuri entertains and surprises with complex analyses, weaving patterns and con- nections from many sources while acknowledging the specu- lative nature of some of his conclusions. The author first discusses the attitudes of the nobility toward luxury and ostentation; in the minds of many (notably Nicolo Zen), the finer attributes of architecture were seen derogatively as "courtiers' arts," sumptuary matters harmful to the Republic's moral integrity. Tafuri sees here the continuation of a mythical concept of equality ("democracy," even), but one which had been transgressed many times in the quattrocento by such fla- grant displays of egocentric flamboyance as the Ca d'Oro and even the Porta della Carta. There followed a series of pendulum swings of acceptable architectural behavior: late High Gothic (decadent to Zen) was followed by a purist polarization in the work of Mauro Codussi and Tullio Lombardo. This phase cul- minated in the sumptuary laws of 1513, following which even Doge Loredan conceded his "mea culpa" to earlier aesthetic excesses. Later the pendulum swings again, so that Sansovino could write, in 1581, with admiration of the men of the past who "were however magnificent in the decoration of the house" (p. 4), naturally linking his father with this revival of Romanized</page><page sequence="2">458 JSAH, L:4, DECEMBER 1991 richness. One might take issue with the claim that Palladio was pushed to the city's margins by resurgent puritanical forces (not S. Giorgio, surely?), although his relationship with the patriciate is discussed again in the later essay. In the second paper we again find themes of contradictory forces, and a penetrating analysis of the symbolic importance of S. Salvador in the city's fabric, a spiritual fulcrum in the heart of the commercial sector.. An ambivalence is evinced by the building's form, buried within the grain of the medieval street pattern, its external self-effacement belying its inner grandeur and serenity. The interior's abstract purity is seen as the result of Lombardo's humanist connections in the 1480s, a puritan, Albertian approach contrasted with the "self-satisfied hedon- ism" (p. 31) of the later quattrocento. One would have liked Tafuri's ideas as to why Bernardo Bembo and Ermolao Barbaro (both supporters of the new church) were so traditional in their own residences, in contrast with their humanistic stance over public matters; in many cultures, the private house is the one place where personal theories can be expressed. We then consider one of Sansovino's most modest works, the parish church of S. Martino, built with few funds on a cramped site. Tafuri rejects Deborah Howard's Codussian derivation for the simple interior in favor of a "reductive" stripped-down classicism, and it is true that there is none of Codussi's spatial sophistication here. Tafuri proposes that this simplicity resulted from Sansovino's innate ability to "cut his cloth," and he extends this priniciple to embrace all of his ecclesiastical works, in each of which can be seen "an ascetic and elementary language" (p. 58). After discussing Erasmus's influence on Sansovino in Rome (he warned of the pagan connotations of too literal an adoption of antique motifs), Tafuri finds in favor of Cardinal Domenico Grimani as the key influence. The most powerful source, how- ever, was arguably Serlio, with his concern for the common man, as shown in the Sesto libro, his attempt to bridge the gap between Antiquity and high purpose on one hand and more basic human needs (including the spiritual) on the other. An illuminating discussion of the extraordinary vacillations surrounding the building of the Scuola Grande di S. Rocco shows with painful clarity what little idea the governors had of what they wanted, constantly revising the brief. Pietro Bon, the first proto, was dismissed in 1524, while his successor, Sante Lombardo, was only three years in the post before he too was dismissed. Finally Scarpagnino brought some stability to the process, heightening the Scuola's image by a triumphal screen of columns erected in front of the completed facade. The last, most monumental Scuola, the Misericordia, was clearly a swan song for the genre; the work was even more disorganized than S. Rocco, and almost ludicrously overambitious. After Sansovino won the design competition, "whims and suspicious conser- vatism" reigned (p. 94); his authority was compromised to such an extent that eventually he quit the site amid mutual recrim- inations. Tafuri then turns to the politics of architecture at the level of the state: the writings of Domenico Morosini and Patrizi are introduced in the context of the search for the ideal city. Both advocated strict urbanistic controls and shared "a conception of architecture as the language and instrument ... of the harmony of the republic" (p. 107). Doge Gritti is rightly seen as a key figure in the city's renovatio (although not without resistance). Tafuri also identifies a "papalist" group of patricians who en- couraged this revival, which later led to Sanmicheli's and Pal- ladio's working in Venice, signs of "a new patronage system" for the Republic (p. 113). The short-lived Accademia della Fama is then discussed, its failure seen as a result of its political influence exceeding what the Signoria considered acceptable; it was closed after only four years. Tafuri suggests-plausibly-that Daniele Barbaro was the force behind Palazzo Trevisan at Murano, noting that despite the Accademia's only slight influence in architecture, Camillo Trevisan was himself a member. Considerable circumstantial evidence (not cited by Tafuri) suggests that Palladio also had a hand in the early stages of its design. The latter's relationship with the patriciate, especially Barbaro, is then discussed in some detail. In the penultimate paper, we turn to urbanistic and hydraulic matters on a large scale. The issues behind the notorious Alvise Cornaro-Cristoforo Sabbadino debates are summarized, Tafuri emphasizing the quite different roles (and hence perceptions) of the protagonists: the former an aesthete but also a practical landowner, the latter a government proto with conservationist responsibilities. The revelation here, though, is Cornaro's pro- posal for the Bacino: a classical theater to be built in the mouth of the Giudecca Canal, datable to c. 1560 and thus anticipatory of Palladio at Vicenza; a "fountain of fresh flowing water" for the Molo; and a small artificial island with a hill surmounted by an open loggia. This last was to offer a humanistic glimpse of Arcadia from the treeless city, while the theater was a cultural focus, educational and civilizing. If the Bacino proposal was practicable, Cornaro's grandiose scheme for the city's defense was not. Not only was it anathema to the Signoria's sensibilities and the myth of Venice's natural impregnability, but (and here Cornaro is let off lightly) it would have been an ecological disaster that Sabbadino, quite rightly, could not have countenanced, his own anthropomorphic vision of the lagoon in direct conflict with Cornaro's "civilizing" artifice. Finally, Tafuri discusses the great wave of urbanistic activity after 1580. From this period date the transformations in the Piazza S. Marco, the prisons, the Fondamente Nuove, and the new Rialto Bridge. This last is seen as the result of "a late phase of the struggle between the empirical concerns of the proto and the humanism of the architectus" (p. 162), evinced by the victory ofJacopo da Ponte's practical mind over the "refined syntaxes" (p. 163) of Palladio. Many threads are then pulled together in a discussion of the influence of "new men" like Alvise Zorzi, and an analysis of the philosophical debate behind the works at S. Marco. As a coda, Tafuri turns to the economic crisis of the turn of the century, which led-as always-to a crisis of con- fidence in building works. Such minor criticisms as can be leveled at this excellent work relate to matters other than Tafuri's text. The discussions would have been easier to follow had the illustrations accompanied the text, and one or two typos should not have escaped (notably "sight" for "site" on p. 146). More debatable is the question of translation; Jessica Levine has generally risen well to a difficult task, but she occasionally lapses into such ungainly phrases as "It was also being recommended to [them] a complex series of actions . . ." (p. 152). I also take issue with the translation of velme (p. 153) as "canal channels," which, whatever it means, does not accord with my Venetian dictionary definition of velma</page><page sequence="3">BOOK REVIEWS 459 as "a strip of land along the banks of a canal, at a higher level than the adjacent lagunar floor. The velma emerges only in specific tidal conditions (i.e., lower than average tides)" (G. F. Turato and D. Durante, Vocabolario etimologico Veneto-Italiano, Padua, 1978). All in all, though, this is an erudite, meticulously researched, and highly stimulating work. RICHARD J. GOY London</page></plain_text>
