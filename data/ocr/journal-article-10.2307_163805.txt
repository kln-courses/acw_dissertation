Nawas A REEXAMINATION OF THREE CURRENT EXPLANATIONS FOR AL-MA'MUN'S INTRODUCTION OF THE MIHNA The seventh Abbasid caliph 'Abd Allah al-Ma'mun (r. 813-833) was noted for the breadth of his intellectual horizons, and historians often associate him with the Golden Age of Islam. This image of glory is tarnished, however, by two particular actions that the caliph took: his declaration (in 827) of a doctrine asserting that the Qur'an was created and his ordering of a mihna, an inquisition, that was designed to ensure acquiescence in this doctrine. The mihna, an unprecedented event in the his- tory of Islam, was begun by al-Ma'mun just four months before his sudden death in 833 and continued by his two immediate successors, al-Mu'tasim and al-Wathiq. It lasted some sixteen years until it was finally abolished by the tenth Abbasid caliph, al-Mutawakkil. Over the years three main hypotheses have been advanced to explain al-Ma'mun's unexpected and seemingly arbitrary moves. One suggests that al-Ma'mun was moved by his Muctazilite sympathies; the second anchors the caliph's motives in the affinity he was said to have had with Shicism; the third proposes that it reflected his determination to assert the supreme and unquestionable authority of a caliph on all matters, worldly and religious. Most scholars with a preference for any one of these three explanations do not nec- essarily exclude the viability of the others, but their preference is often betrayed by the importance they attach to certain actions by al-Ma'mun at the expense of others, the primary sources chosen for scrutiny, and by what their sources say. A fresh re- examination of the problem, using an exhaustive range of sources' combined with some refinements in conceptualization and method, is used here in an effort to reach more definitive conclusions. The promulgation of the doctrine and the order for enforcing its acceptance were not simultaneous; the first preceded the second by six years. They therefore cannot be treated, although it is often done, as a single event, because the circumstances that prompted al-Ma'mun to set the mihna in motion may well have been different from those that led him to declare that the Qur'an was created. To assure that this distinction was maintained, the sources were systematically scrutinized twice, once John A.

Nawas for information relevant to the declaration and then again for information pertain- ing to the mihna. This exercise proved valuable in two ways: it showed that early chroniclers did not regard the doctrine of the createdness of the Qur'an as partic- ularly noteworthy;2 it was made into an important event by later scholars, probably because the mihna was considered dramatic. Second, it supplied otherwise un- tapped means to test straightforwardly and directly the hypothesis on Muctazilism and the one on caliphal authority. Most of the material used to support Muctazilism as an explanation was linked exclusively to what the chroniclers said about the doctrine of the createdness of the Qur'an, and all that was found relevant to the hy- pothesis on al-Ma'mun's vision of caliphal authority sprang directly from what the primary sources said about the mihna and the events surrounding it. EVIDENCE RELEVANT TO MUCTAZILISM Scholars who have found the hypothesis that al-Ma'mun was moved by Muctazil- ism especially attractive-they include Amin, Hitti, Kennedy, Patton, and Watt3- note, first, that he was intimate with a number of distinguished Muctazilites and, second, that the doctrine of the createdness of the Qur'an was itself a central tenet of Muctazilism and the views of the two parties on other matters as well showed much overlap. There is evidence that the caliph did indeed maintain close ties with a number of leading Muctazilites. His teacher, Abu al-Hudhayl al-cAllaf,4 for example, was a prominent Muctazilite, and the sources quote the verses al-Ma'mun reportedly recited in praise of this man.5 We are also told that the caliph had close relations with the notable Mu'tazilites al-Nazzam,6 al-Fuwati,7 and Thumama ibn Ashras.8 In his last will and testament, we read that he advised his brother and successor to the caliphate, al-Mu'tasim, to take to heart the counsel of Ibn Abi Du'ad,9 another prominent Muctazilite. The sources also tell us that al-Ma'mun had equally strong and intimate bonds with others outside Muctazilite circles, however, of whom some were in fact anti- Muctazilites. The caliph, for instance, prayed over the corpse of Bishr al-Marisi,'0 purportedly a proponent of the teachings of Dirar ibn cAmr whose theology was ana- thema to mainstream Muctazilite thinking.1' Yahya ibn Aktham, a foe of Mucta- zilism, gave counsel that al-Ma'mun held in high esteem.'2 One cannot therefore take seriously the notion that the caliph's declaration of the doctrine reflected intimacy with Muctazilites. Perhaps a firmer basis for the plausibility of the hypothesis can be found in re- ports that tell us that the caliph and the Muctazilites shared a common set of views on matters of substance. Some chroniclers scarcely went beyond simply labeling al-Ma'mun as a Muctazilite.13 Al-Mascudi14 informs us that early in his reign al- Ma'mun had made known his views on divine unity (al-tawhid) and the doctrine of "promise and threat" (al-wacd wa-al-wacid), which are bedrock Muctazilite te- nets. Al-Yacqubil5 says that while the caliph was in Damascus in 833, he had be- gun to question people about the principles of "unity and justice," which are also associated with the Muctazilites. Finally, in his letters on the mihna,'6 al-Ma'mun took pains to stress the absolute unity of God (tawhid), a tenet that he, like the Muctazilites, used for deducing the doctrine of the createdness of the Qur'an.</page><page sequence="3">al-Ma mun 's Introduction of the Mihna 617 These considerations do suggest a common core of views between Muctazilite doctrine and al-Ma'mun. However, the case is not as solid as it first appears. Ibn Abi Tahir Tayfur, one of the earliest sources on al-Ma'mun's caliphate and one that provides us with the most detailed information on his theological position, cites a statement made by Thumama ibn Ashras that al-Ma'mun had abandoned the position of indeterminism-a crucial principle of mainstream Muctazilite thinking.17 This is especially important because Ibn Ashras was a prominent Muctazilite and one who was close to al-Ma'mun. Ibn Abi Tahir Tayfur also says that on two different occasions al-Ma'mun declared himself to be a Murji'ite, a comment that separates him from the Mu'tazilites.18 In light of these inconsistencies, the only conclusion one can draw is that the caliph's theological views are eclectic; at the very least, this argues against the po- sition that he was a thoroughgoing Muctazilite, let alone one who promulgated a religious doctrine purely out of a commitment to Muctazilism. The same applies to the doctrine of the createdness of the Qur'an to which the caliph clung tena- ciously; in the days of al-Ma'mun's caliphate, the doctrine of the createdness of the Qur'an was quite popular and widely debated; it was by no means an exclu- sively Muctazilite theme.19 In the letters on the mihna, al-Ma'mun used two other lines of argument in fa- vor of the doctrine that differed from Muctazilite reasoning.20 One theme is asso- ciated with the eminent jurist Abu Hanifa-in whose teachings the caliph was well versed21-and is grounded in the ontological status of objects. Unlike the Mu'tazilites, who used the nature of God as their point of departure, Abu Hanifa argued that all things other than God are by definition created, hence the Qur'an, itself an object, must have been created.22 The other line of argument, which is not known to have Muctazilite or Hanafite origins, rested on the wordings of some Qur'anic verses, in which it is said that the Qur'an was "made into something" (jacala) and that anything that is made must have been created. So much for the hypothesis that links al-Ma'mun's declaration of the doctrine of the createdness of the Qur'an to Muctazilite influences. As to the issuance of the mihna order, no information was uncovered in the primary sources to connect this event with Muctazilism.23 Al-Ma'mun probably considered the company of specu- lative theologians, Muctazilites included, to be congenial. He undoubtedly shared some ideas with the Muctazilites, and his thinking may well have been influenced by theirs, but this is a far cry from constituting a causal link. All things consid- ered, the conclusion seems warranted that the Muctazilism hypothesis must be re- jected as the principal explanation for the caliph's actions.24 EVIDENCE REGARDING SHICISM The line of argument used by proponents of the Shici hypothesis is analogous to the one marshaled by those who favor a Muctazilism explanation, that is, al-Ma'mun's loyalties to Shicism lay behind his actions. In a classic and widely cited article on the caliph's overall religious policy, Sourdel25 identified four points that he thought showed a close affinity between the views of the caliph and Shicism. These are the mutCa marriage, the caliph's partiality toward the cAlids, the format of the takblr rit- ual, and the imamate.</page><page sequence="4">618 John A. Nawas Sourdel maintains that the mutca, a form of temporary marriage, was an exclu- sively Shici institution and that by contemplating proclaiming its permissibility al-Ma'mun betrayed his Shici propensities. Apart from the fact that the caliph's stand on the mutca does not tell us very much about his politicoreligious leanings, this form of marriage had its ups and downs all through the ages. There were times, Heffening writes,26 when some Shici groups-including some Zaydites, who still form an im- portant wing of the Shicis-opposed it, and there were times when some Sunni groups sanctioned it. Nonetheless, Heffening states that by the caliph's time convic- tions on mutca had become standardized and that al-Ma'mun's stand on mutca can "certainly" be construed as reflecting "his Shl'i sympathies."27 Curiously, al-Khatib al-Baghdadi28-whose report was used by Sourdel-tells us that once the caliph had learned from Yahya ibn Aktham that 'Ali ibn Abi Talib was opposed to the mutca, al-Ma'mun abandoned the idea of declaring it permissible. In light of these ambigu- ities, all that can be concluded is that the caliph did contemplate permitting a par- ticular form of marriage over which opinions differed,29 then changed his mind out of reverence for the Prophet's son-in-law. This sentiment is important, but it has no rele- vance to the subject at hand unless one wants to assume that honoring 'Ali was confined to the Shi'is. There is no question that al-Ma'mun esteemed the memory of 'Ali ibn Abi Talib; he declared him to be "the best of mankind after the Prophet."30 Scholars have used this and other evidence to argue that al-Ma'mun had pro-Alid sympathies,31 the most significant of which was his designation in 817 of the 'Alid 'Ali ibn Musa al- Rida as his heir to the caliphate. In light of the centuries-old link between Shi'ism and 'Ali ibn Abi Talib, it is almost inevitable to read into al-Ma'mun's pro-Alid sympathies pro-Shi'ism as well. That is, however, a retrojection to a time when Shi'ism had not yet crystallized as a full-fledged set of doctrines;32 even if it had the reasoning overreaches the bounds of causality. A more conservative position is that al-Ma'mun's undeniably strong 'Alid sentiments were a reflection of his ac- knowledgment that the 'Alids-whom he saw as an integral part of his own ex- tended family, the Hashimites33-had suffered many injustices that needed to be redressed and that it was in the interest of the caliphal institution to restore the 'Alids to its mainstream. Chroniclers report two episodes regarding the takblr ritual (the pronouncing of the formula Allahu Akbar). The first concerns the funeral ritual. Sourdel correctly points out that in his last will and testament al-Ma'mun requested that five takbirs be said at his funeral, which is standard for the Shi'is.34 The significance of the number of takbirs and its meaning is far from clear, however, as will become evi- dent in the course of discussing the second episode. In the year 832, al-Ma'mun ordered his governor in Baghdad to have the troops there pronounce three additional takbirs after their daily prayers.35 Sourdel interprets these supplementary takbirs as a Shi'i practice, basing this interpretation on a report by the Fatimid legal expert al-Qadi al-Nu'man in which we are told that three takbirs after the benediction ending the prayer (al-taslim) were recommended by Ja'far al-Sadiq.36 This report adds, however, that the three takbirs referred to by Ja'far al-Sadiq were only a small part of an elaborate formula that al-Sadiq suggested for ending the prayer. This formula comprised numerous religious declarations, and it</page><page sequence="5">al-Ma'mun 's Introduction of the Mihna 619 was Ja'far al-Sadiq's suggestion that the formula in its entirety be repeated ten times. There is no mention of this extended version in al-Ma'mun's order. According to a number of representative Shici texts, moreover, the number of takbirs after the taslim was not fixed and could optionally range from one to seven.37 Lacking concrete evi- dence to the contrary, a more tenable interpretation of the caliph's directive would be that it was simply intended to arouse some religious zeal among the troops on the eve of a great campaign against the Byzantine Empire rather than to proselytize for the Shicis.38 As for the question of the imamate, Sourdel and other scholars correctly point out that al-Ma'mun had ascribed to the caliph those qualities that the Shicis associated with the leader of the community, the imam. Al-Ma'mun did in fact equate the titles of caliph and imam throughout his entire reign as is evident in at least three formal documents spanning two decades.39 Nagel40 finds this conception to be closest to that of the Zaydite wing of the Shicis; Watt sees it as reflecting a Shici vision that, addi- tionally, has a link to the doctrine of the createdness of the Qur'an.41 Al-Ma'mun was not, as some scholars maintain,42 the only or even the first Abbasid caliph to use the title of imam officially, as evidence from numismatics and other sources shows.43 In all likelihood the title imam meant more to al-Ma'mun than it did to his predeces- sors, however; at least he used it throughout his entire reign and he made much of it in the mihna letters. The crucial question is whether one can justifiably interpret the convergence of views between al-Ma'mun and the Shi'is as coincidence or as cause and effect. There is no evidence whatsoever to suggest that the caliph's use of the title was due to Shici leanings, genuine or otherwise. It is evident, then, that the case for the Shicism argument rests on a broader base than the one made for the Muctazilism hypothesis, but the inferential jumps re- quired are still too far-reaching to make a convincing case: the evidence relevant to the mutCa is inconsistent, to the pro-'Alid leanings misplaced, to the takbir spotty, and to the imamate questionable. A more direct test of the Shicism hypothesis than the refutations just presented is the congruence between al-Ma'mun's view that the Qur'an was created and that held by the Shicis. According to Madelung's meticu- lous analysis of the ideologies of representative Shi'i theologians, most groups in existence in al-Ma'mun's time followed the teachings of Jacfar al-Sadiq. Al-Sadiq was of the opinion that the Qur'an was uncreated, a view cited during the mihna by the embattled Ahmad ibn Hanbal in his defense against those who wanted him to profess that the Qur'an was created.44 Had the caliph been moved by Shici sympa- thies, one would expect him to have declared the Qur'an as uncreated rather than created, since this appears to have been the prevailing view amongst Shici groups at the time. AL-MA'MUN'S CONCERNS ABOUT THE AUTHORITY OF THE CALIPHATE The third hypothesis-that al-Ma'mun's declaration of the createdness of the Qur'an doctrine and his mihna order were meant to tighten the grip of the caliph as supreme and unquestionable authority-is reflected best in the works of Lapi- dus and Crone and Hinds.45 Four documents, purported to be copies of the original ones written by or for al-Ma'mun, constitute the backbone of the evidence. The</page><page sequence="6">620 John A. Nawas first of these documents is the Risalat al-khamis, which was written around 813 and transmitted the tradition through which the Abbasid caliphs sought to cement their power and legitimacy.46 The second is a letter written by the caliph in 817 designating 'Ali ibn Musa al-Rida as his heir;47 the third are the mihna letters;48 the fourth is the caliph's will.49 Other studies have taken up these texts separately, but they will be analyzed here as a unit to unveil al-Ma'mun's conception of the caliphate from the very beginning of his reign until his death. Remarkably, this conception was manifestly clear as early as 813, and it remained constant through- out the years. Al-Ma'mun regarded the caliph as representing God and the Prophet. This posi- tion endows him with certain rights, but also commits him to carrying out specific duties in the service of the Islamic community, whose obligations to the caliph al-Ma'mun also spelled out. Three times during his reign, the caliph referred to himself as the deputy or rep- resentative of God (khalifat Alldh): the first was in 817, when he designated al-Rida as heir;50 the second probably in 818 or 819, in a letter al-Ma'mun wrote to a chief governor, al-Hasan ibn Sahl;5' the third was in the mihna order52 in 833. The caliph was not only the representative of God but of the Prophet as well; ref- erence to himself as the successor of his forefather, Muhammad, was made, ac- cording to al-Baladhuri, around the year 825.53 And in his mihna order the caliph went so far as to describe himself as the heir of the prophethood.54 Al-Ma'mun also claimed for himself a unique relationship with God. In the let- ter to al-Hasan ibn Sahl, he wrote that God had inspired him with His views, zeal, and intent.55 Around the same time although in a different context, the caliph also stated that the choice of al-Rida as heir was inspired by God.56 In 833, al-Ma'mun wrote in his first letter on the mihna that God had entrusted him with special and "hidden knowledge" as well as political power;57 he also made the claim that he, unlike others, was able to recognize God as he "really is."58 Al-Ma'mun s perception of himself as the khalifa of both God and the Prophet fits well with a comment he made early in his reign that the caliphal institution was wrought by God.59 Having directly linked his person as well as the institution of which he was the head to God and the Prophet, it should come as no surprise that al-Ma'mun saw himself as the bulwark of Islam and its protector.60 His merits as holder of the caliphal office were also mentioned, as we see in both his state- ment that his brother al-Amin did not merit the office61 and in his designation of al-Rida.62 Al-Ma'mun saw the caliph as assigned by God to be guardian of his religion and laws.63 It was his duty to combat unbelievers, protect the unity of the state, stem the tide of civil discord, maintain public order and security, and ensure access to the holy places.64 The caliph was accountable to God for his actions65 and served as the exec- utor of God's ordinances66 and of the Prophet's commands.67 In asserting the caliph's superiority in knowing what was best for the community, al-Ma'mun also claimed to be an educator,68 a role he assumed in the risalat al-khamls.69 As an educator he was to save the souls of his subjects by ensuring that they tread the right path, which he was able to show them.70 The same theme was re- peated twenty years later in the context of the mihna order.7'</page><page sequence="7">al-Ma mun 's Introduction of the Mihna 621 In his own conduct, the caliph had to follow the path of the Prophet72 and serve as a model of good behavior for his subjects.73 He must fear God's punishment and direct his energies to acquiring God's favor.74 Fearing God and obeying him are themes that recur throughout al-Ma'mun's reign.75 The caliph must place the well- being of his subjects above his personal inclinations,76 and he must be guided by the principle of justice.77 Al-Mu'tasim was urged by the dying al-Ma'mun to treat his subjects with gentleness and to take away from the strong to give to the weak.78 Another theme continuously stressed by al-Ma'mun is the obligation of his sub- jects to obey their caliph.79 Compliance with his wishes was expected, and he saw himself as above the law; he deemed the use of the sword as justified in securing subservience, and he even considered it within his jurisdiction to determine who was and who was not fit to transmit hadith.80 A report dating to 816, recorded by al-Jahshiyari, has al-Ma'mun first overruling a judge and then summarily dismissing him because the verdict he pronounced happened to go against the caliph's vizier al-Fadl ibn Sahl.81 The caliph ordered the mihna while he was sojourning near Tarsus where he was either engaged in or planning a military campaign against the Byzantine Em- pire.82 The order was conveyed to Ishaq ibn Ibrahim, his governor in Baghdad, in a series of five letters. All were written in the last four months of the caliph's life, though only the first bears a date-RabiC I 218 (March-April 833).83 Two of the five, the second and the fifth, are brief and unrevealing,84 but the others show the caliph's tactical moves, what he was after, and who stood in his way. Perhaps the most striking feature of the first letter85 is its ambiguity. This vagueness is probably intentional, a kind of "trial balloon." The letter does not specify the rationale for the interrogation, the measures to be taken against those who refuse to acquiesce in the doctrine, or who exactly should be subjected to the mihna. The threat against those who decline to give assent to the doctrine is also tentative and vague, "The Commander of the Faithful is not about to seek the assistance of... those whose faith is in doubt."86 Speaking in generalities, al-Ma'mun says that he felt it was his solemn duty to correct the wrong views of those who were "sunk in ignorance and in blindness about God, plunged into error regarding the true nature of His religion and His unity and faith in Him . .. people who fall short of being able to grasp the reality of God as He should be recognized. . . and to distinguish between Him and His creation [the Qur'an]."87 This first letter is devoted mainly to damning the self- serving "group of adherents to the false way"88 and to setting forth evidence from the Qur'an which, the caliph said, could only be interpreted to men that it was finite in time, a created object. The third letter89 spells out more clearly what the first stated vaguely. In it, the ca- liph gives the names of the men he wanted interrogated and lets us know who the others are by listing the functions they would have to give up were they to refuse to assent to the doctrine. His threat in the third letter is also definite: "The Commander of the Faithful," al-Ma'mun writes, "does not regard any of them [those who deny the doctrine] suited for holding an office of trust as depositories; authorized legal</page><page sequence="8">622 John A. Nawas counsel; witnesses; men whose words or reports are to be construed as reliable; or men to exercise authority over any aspect in the lives of the subjects."90 In this let- ter, too, the caliph dwells on the link between the doctrine of the createdness of the Qur'an and God's unity. Though the first letter can be seen as a prelude to the third, the pair have three features in common. First, both are packed with well-reasoned arguments sup- ported by numerous to-the-point Qur'anic verses. Second, compared with the fourth letter, these two are more elegant and coherent in style; they both also set forth in detail the qualities of the occupant of the caliphal office as well as his privileges and duties. The style of the fourth letter9l differs from that of the first and third. It is argu- mentative rather than reasonable, and in it the caliph no longer concerns himself with doctrinal issues. Nowhere else is he as confrontational and nonconciliatory as we find him in this fourth letter. The issue of the createdness of the Qur'an is relegated to the background, to be replaced by a boundless determination that dissenters must abide by the ironclad rule that the caliph must be obeyed and his ex cathedra pro- nouncements accepted without any qualification whatsoever.92 Combative and overbearing though al-Ma'mun was in demanding the unqual- ified submission of dissenters, he nonetheless took time to set forth-especially in the preambles to two of the letters-his rationale for requiring absolute obedience. "God made it incumbent upon the imams and caliphs of the Muslims" al-Ma'mun said in the first letter, that they should be zealous in establishing God's religion, which He has asked them to guard faithfully; in the heritage of prophethood of which He has made them inheritors; in the tradition of knowledge which He has entrusted to their keeping.... Now the Com- mander of the Faithful asks God to direct him to firmness and resolution ... in the exercise of authority over his people which God, with His compassion and grace, has entrusted to him.93 The third letter expands on the role of the caliph but goes further. In it al-Ma'mun stressed the special knowledge God inspired in the caliphs.94 The caliphs were uniquely qualified and duty-bound to guide and enlighten the community at large and-significantly-to guide and enlighten those who "lead an ascetic life... thereby acquiring for themselves glory . .. and securing for themselves leadership."95 This is the very group of men the caliph wanted to subdue for he had good reason to feel threatened by them. In al-Ma'mun's times, men of religious learning, then a heterogeneous group who were given the generic term of ulema, had succeeded in carving out for themselves a broad territory of influence and popularity among all strata of society, and they were a formidable force to reckon with.96 Had this authority continued unchecked, it would eventually have led to a "house divided" and a caliphal institution adrift. En- dowed by God with authority over all that concerned Muslims, it was only a caliph who was entitled to exercise it. The influence the ulema were acquiring at the ex- pense of the legitimate ruler and with consequent peril to Islam must be halted. Per- haps seeking to arouse the passion and wrath of the masses, al-Ma'mun's offensive was as vehement as his language was plain; he called his opponents usurers, liars,</page><page sequence="9">al-Ma'mun's Introduction of the Mihna 623 thieves, of corrupt honor, evil, deceitful, and stupid. He dubbed them "people of the false way" who "pretend" to have knowledge and goodness but "deliberately lead astray" the masses.97 The caliph further accused opponents of "polytheism"98 and "anthropomorphism,"99 and he likened them to "Christians who say of Jesus, the son of Mary, that he was not created since he is the Word of God."'00 By refusing to ac- knowledge that the Qur'an was created, al-Ma'mun wrote, the nay-sayers were per- verting the Qur'anic texts and committing a "heresy" (ilhad), thereby playing into the hands of the enemy of Islam.'10 The only path of redemption he left for dissenters was to abandon their pretensions and recalcitrance and "fully concur with the views of the Commander of the Faithful."'02 Both the reason and the timing of al-Ma'mun's advocation of the doctrine of the Qur'an's createdness of this choice remain a mystery; the primary sources are silent on the subject. Promulgating the doctrine was probably not an end in itself, but only an excuse for conducting a mihna since the primary sources attached so little significance to his declaration of it. Subjecting men to the mihna naturally required a test. The createdness of the Qur'an doctrine was an eminently suitable one since it gave the man who set the rules for the "debate"-the caliph-a decided edge. The first advantage was that it was a theological issue and therefore could chal- lenge on their own turf those who claimed knowledge of, and expertise in, reli- gious matters. It would be inconceivable that the learned men to whom the question about the nature of the Qur'an was to be put would refuse to give an opinion about a matter so intimately tied to their vocations. If they refused, they would qualify as impostors or as ignoramuses, as the caliph called them, and dam- age their own interests. Second, the doctrine had the advantage for the caliph that it lent itself well to the type of straightforward, cause and effect rhetoric with which his letters were loaded. The caliph cast it in the format of a question to which the men interro- gated were expected to answer by "agree" or "disagree." There was no room for equivocation since the question was, "Is the Qur'an created?," and answers that did not directly address this very question were brushed aside. The men interro- gated had to abide by that rule. Refusal to give a direct affirmative answer could also be made to look as if it were a test of a man's fidelity to the Islamic religion in toto. Another advantageous feature was that it was difficult to come up with a rebuttal to the doctrine; neither logic nor the authority of the Qur'an refutes the doctrine within the framework of the structure imposed. In essence, the caliph argued in his letters syllogistically: God created all things; the Qur'an is a thing; therefore, God created the Qur'an. What could the opponents say? To reject al-Ma'mun's assertion that "God made the Qur'an into something" (jacala al-quridn) meant nothing other than "God created the Qur'an,"'03 the best that anyone could come up with was a denial of the equivalence of khalaqa (to create) andjacala (to make something into something) but no one was able to say what else jacala could possibly mean. The group under interrogation were in a tight spot. Some of them simply acqui- esced in the doctrine. A second group took cover under taqiyya (compliance with a demand under duress). A third group, at once soothing their own conscience and</page><page sequence="10">624 John A. Nawas appeasing the caliph, gave an implied consent by saying that if the Commander of the Faithful wanted them to say that the Qur'an was created, then al-samC wa al-tdcal04 (to hear is to obey). It could not have been lost on a man of al-Ma'mun's intellect that members of these last two groups were circumventing the issue, since they fell short of giving the wholehearted answer demanded. This was of little consequence, however, since, after all, the doctrine of the createdness of the Qur'an was a pseudo-issue anyway. The counterfeit acquiescence of those who hid themselves behind taqiyya and especially "to hear is to obey" was probably of greater use to the caliph than genuine consent, since the message of feigned consent went a longer way toward legitimizing the caliph's own claims that he was sole arbiter in spiritual matters. No wonder al-Ma'mun wanted to lose no time in making public the names of those who were considered to have passed the test.105 The point at issue during the mihna was therefore not a particular theological doctrine, but the authority of the caliph versus the authority of those men who saw themselves and not the caliph as the legitimate repository and authentic transmit- ters of religious knowledge and tradition. Although Muctazilism and Shicism may have played a role in shaping al-Ma'mun's thought, as they did the thought of many men, it is most unlikely that either or both had been the reason for his ac- tions. His was fundamentally a MaDmunite platform guided by an abiding convic- tion that the caliphal institution must survive and that its survival could be assured only by a supreme head with authority that was unquestioned, unlimited, and shared with no one else.

Coverage spans the period from the mihna itself to the 17th century. 2The primary sources said very little about the declaration of the doctrine and nothing whatsoever about the circumstances surrounding it or why al-Ma'mun promulgated it. All they say is that in the year 827 the caliph "made public the view that the Qur'an was created" (azhara al-qawl bi-khalq al-Qur'an). They also provide no clues as to why al-Ma'mun made this view known in 827 rather than some other year. 3Ahmad Amin, Duha al-Islam, 3 vols. (Cairo: Maktabat al-nahda al-Misriyya, 1933-36), 3:98, 159.

'2This is reflected in two episodes I have encountered. One has to do with al-Ma'mun's intent on cursing the Umayyad caliph Mucawiya. Ibn Aktham dissuaded al-Ma'mun from doing so by cautioning the caliph against the hazards of needlessly arousing passions; al-Ma'mun took the advice to heart; see Ahmad ibn Abi Tahir Tayfur, Kitab Baghdad, ed. H. Keller (Leipzig: 0. Harrassowitz, 1908), 91-92. On another occasion, Yahya ibn Aktham was able to dissuade the caliph from sanctioning the mutca marriage; see Abu Bakr Ahmad ibn cAli, al-Khatib al-Baghdadi, Ta'rikh Baghdad, 15 vols. (Beirut: Dar al-kutub al-'ilmiyya, n.d.), 14:199-200. 13A number of such late sources summarily contend that al-Ma'mun "was a Muctazilite"; so said, for instance, the Hanbalite chronicler Abu al-Falah CAbd al-Hayy ibn al-CImad, Shadharat al-dhahab, 8 vols. (Beirut: Dar al-afaq al-jadida), 2:39. The heresiologist al-Baghdadi also maintains that al-MaDmun was a Mu'tazilite, adding that he had been enticed into becoming one by Thumama ibn Ashras, see Abui Mansuir al-Qahir ibn Tahir al-Baghdadi, al-Farq bayn al-Firaq, ed. Muhammad al-Kawthari (Cairo: Maktab Nashr al-thaqafa al-islamiyya, 1948), 103. Al-Ma'mun's name also appears in a list of the ca- liphs who allegedly held Mu'tazilite views in Ibn al-Murtada's Tabaqat al-Mu'tazila (122, 127), but no detailed are given. 4Al-Masc'di, Muruij, 4:227.

Interpreted similarly by van Ess, "Dirar ibn 'Amr," 34. 19See Josef van Ess, "Ibn Kullab und die Mihna," Oriens 18-19 (1967): 92-142 (recently translated into French and published in Arabica 37 [1990]: 173-233) for variants of the doctrine by, for instance, non-Mu'tazilite mutakallimufn. 20The Mu'ctazilite argument, which al-Ma'mun also used, is anchored in the assertion about the absolute unity of God: the Qur'an could not be eternal because, if that were the case, an object (the Qur'an) would then share in an attribute of God (eternity). This in turn would violate God's absolute unity. The Mu'tazilites therefore concluded that the Qur'an must be created. 2tJamal al-Din Abi al-Muhasin Yuisuf ibn Taghribirdi, al-Nujuiim al-Zdhirafi Muluk Misr wa-al-Qdhira, 16 vols. (Cairo: Wizarat al-Thaqafa wa al-Irshad al-Qawmi, 1929-72), 2:225, tells us that al-Ma'mun "had distinguished himself (baraca) in law according to the school of Abui Hanifa." Also cited by Martin Hinds, s.v. "mihna," Encyclopaedia of Islam, 2nd ed. 220n Abu Hanifa's argumentation against an uncreated Qur'an and the differences with the Mu'tazilite stance, see Wilferd Madelung, "The Origins of the Controversy Concerning the Creation of the Koran" in Orientalia Hispanica sive studia F. M. Pareja octogenario dicata, ed. J. M. Barral (Leiden: E. J. Brill, 1974), 504-25, esp. 511. 23To be sure, Ahmad ibn Abi Du'ad was a participant in the deliberations of the mihna during the reign of al-Ma'mun and after his death. However, he was one of a number of participants, and nowhere did I find material to link him to the order which al-Ma'mun himself issued, though he may well have played a more influential role during the reign of the intellectually frail al-MuCtasim. 24The link between al-Ma'mun and the Mu'tazilites is deeply entrenched, but the reasons for it are un- known. The persistence of the idea may have had its roots in the generations of Sunni chroniclers who considered the Mu'tazilites "evil-doers" and who saw al-Ma'mun as an errant caliph who was in collusion</page><page sequence="12">626 John A. Nawas with them or simply did their bidding. Ibn al-Jawzi, for instance, tells us that al-Ma'mun was reluctant to introduce both the doctrine and the mihna but finally gave in under Muctazilite pressure. See Abu al-Faraj CAbd al-Rahman ibn al-Jawzi, Mandqib al-Imdm Ahmad ibn Hanbal, ed. Muhammad Amin al-Khanji al- Kutubi (Beirut: Khanji wa-Hamdan, n.d.), 309. Al-Ma'mun's reluctance is also noted by Abu 'Abdallah Shams al-Din Muhammad al-Dhahabi, Tarjamat al-Imim Ahmad, ed. A. M. Shakir (Beirut: Dar al-macarif lil-tiba'ca, 1946), 40. Both Ibn al-Taghribirdi and al-Safadi explain that the caliph had acquired that sophis- tication in philosophy and the sciences for which the Muctazilites were noted; eventually it lead him to the "erroneous" doctrine of the createdness of the Qur'an. See Ibn Taghribirdi, al-Nujuim, 2:225; Khalil ibn Aybak al-Safadi, al-Wafif ft al-Wafaydit, 22 vols., ed. D. Krawulsky (Wiesbaden: Franz Steiner, 1982), 17:655. Al-Subki uses the same theme but turns it around by ascribing al-Ma'mun's adoption of the doc- trine to his shallowness of knowledge of philosophy and the sciences. See Taj al-Din Abi Nasr CAbd al- Wahhab ibn CAli ibn 'Abd al-Kafl, al-Subki, Tabaqdt al-Shdfi'iyya al-Kubra, 10 vols., ed.

"mutca" (W. Heffening). 27Ibid. 28Al-Khatib al-Baghdadi, Ta'rikh, 14:199-200. 29Within what later would become known as Sunni circles there was also a wide variety of opinions regarding mut'a; on this see Harald Motzki, Die Anfdnge der islamischen Jurisprudenz: Ihre Entwick- lung in Mekka bis zur Mitte des 2./8. Jahrhunderts (Stuttgart: Franz Steiner Verlag, 1991), index s.v. "muta." 30So said al-Ma'mun in 827. See al-Tabari, Ta'rikh, 3:1099; Abui Zakariyya Yazid ibn Muhammad ibn Iyas al-Qasim al-Azdi, Ta'rikh al-Mawsil, ed.

This public declaration was a restatement of what he had said around 819 when he pointed out that the preeminence of 'Ali did not necessarily entail a demeaning of al-salaf, the other early Muslims (Ibn Abi Tahir Tayfur, Kitidb Baghdadd, 75-79). 31The most elaborate discussion of the relationship between al-Ma'mun and the 'Alids is provided by Francesco Gabrieli, Al-Ma'mun e gli 'Alidi (Leipzig: Verlag Eduard Pfeiffer, 1929). 32Cf. Marshall G. S. Hodgson, The Venture of Islam, 3 vols. (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1974), vol. 1, The Classical Age of Islam, 481, n. 2. 33In the document making 'Ali ibn Musa al-Rida heir, we read that the caliph considered the 'Alids to be just as integral a part of the Hashimite family and the House of the Prophet as their cousins the Abbasids were. A copy of the designation letter is found in Abui al-Hasan 'Ali ibn 'Isa ibn Abi al-Fatah al-Irbili, Kashf al-ghumma bi-ma'rifat al-a'imma, 4 vols., ed. Hashim al-Rusuili (Qum: al-Matba'a al-'ilmiyya, 1961-62), 3:123 ff. 34The Shi'is derived the prescribed five takbirs from their belief that Seth had prayed over Adam using this same number; see Etan Kohlberg, "Some Shi'i Views of the Antediluvian World," Studia Islamica 52 (1980): 41-66, especially 62-63. The Sunni schools of law reject this number and their prescription calls for four takbirs. For the standard Sunni version, see Irene Gruiitter, "Arabische Bestat- tungsgebrauche in fruhislamischer Zeit (nach Ibn Sa'd und Buhari)," Der Islam 31 (1954): 147-73; ibid., Der Islam 32 (1957): 79-104, 168-94, in particular pt.

My thanks go to Professor Etan Kohlberg for helping me on this matter. 380One can muse over al-Ma'mun's order having a contemporary likeness in Saddam Hussein's decision to add the takblir to the Iraqi flag during the Gulf War of 1991. I am indebted to Dr. Gauthier H. A. Juynboll for suggesting this possible interpretation of the episode.</page><page sequence="13">al-Ma mun 's Introduction of the Mihna 627 39The first time this usage occurred was in the Risalat al-khamis around 813. The text is given in Ahmad Zaki Safwat, Jamharat rasd'il al-'Arab, 4 vols. (Cairo: Mustafa al-Halabi, 1937), 3:377-97.

Studien zum Minderheitenproblem in Islam 2 (Bonn: Selbstverlag des Orientalischen Semi- nars der Universitat, 1975), 386 ff. 41Watt, Formative Period, 177-79. Watt's account is highly speculative. He argues that there is a great difference in the "prestige" value of a created versus an uncreated Qur'an. One cannot, for ex- ample, change an uncreated Qur'an since then one would be tampering with God himself. "A created Qur'an had not the same prestige [as an uncreated one], and there could not be the same objection to its provisions being overruled by the decree of an inspired imam" (ibid., 179). An imam, as a "true ca- liph," towers above mankind because he is chosen by God and is endowed with superhuman qualities which presumably make it permissible for him to tamper with the Qur'an. So much for Watt's views. Since al-Ma'mun's first use of the term imam dates to 813 and it was not until fourteen years later that he publicly came up with the idea that the Qur'an was created, a connection is unlikely. Further, there is no record or report that suggests al-Ma'mun placed himself above, or questioned, the Qur'an-or the hadith for that matter-and every Qur'anic verse he cited in his mihna letters was interpreted by him with impeccable logic and fidelity to the text. Watt's position is criticized on other grounds by Hinds, see Encyclopaedia of Islam, 2nd ed., s.v. "mihna." 42Sourdel, "La politique religieuse du calife," 37; Watt, Formative Period, 177; 'Abd al-'Aziz al-Duri, al-'Asr al-CAbbdsi al-awwal (Beirut: Dir al-talica lil-tibc'a wa-al-nashr, 1945), 153, n. 5; and Faruiq 'Umar, Buhuth fi al-ta'rikh al-'Abbdsi (Beirut: Dar al-qalam lil-tiba'a, 1977), 222. 43Albert Arazi and cAmikam El'ad, "L'epitre a l'armee: al-Ma'mufin et la seconde da'wa," Studia Is- lamica 66 (1988): 27-70; ibid., 67 (1988): 29-73; pages 47-48, n. 155, provide us with a long list of references in major historical sources that show that al-Ma'mun's Abbasid predecessors did refer to themselves as imams both officially and informally. A coin has been unearthed, showing as date of issue the year A.H. 193 (808-9) and carrying the inscription "al-imdm Muhammad [al-Amin]," al-Ma'mun's predecessor; see George C. Miles, The Numismatic History of Rayy (New York: American Numismatic Society, 1938), 90.
