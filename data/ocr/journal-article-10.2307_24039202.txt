<plain_text><page sequence="1">Theme and Image in "The World Is Too Much With Us" By Arnold B. Fox and Martin Kallich Northern Illinois University In poetry, familiarity often breeds content. The well-known line tends to be read inattentively, and our pleasure may be based more upon our past experience than upon our present perceptions. Just as the music of poetry may lull the intellect, so the felicitous and oft-quoted phrases of a favorite poem may leave our critical faculties unguarded. Wordsworth's "The World Is Too Much With Us" is not only one of the most admired of the poet's works but also one of the most widely known and highly praised English sonnets. It has a simple appeal, a theme that strikes a responsive chord in most readers, a number of effective touches of rhetoric, and picturesque nature imagery. However, a careful critical examination of this old favorite may lead to disappointing discoveries. Before we examine the poem closely, let us first consider what Wordsworth appears to be saying to the non-critical reader. We are too much committed to worldly business, he asserts; we are constantly, "late and soon," wasting our spiritual and imaginative "powers" as we devote ourselves to material goods, buying and selling, "getting and spending," and have simply succeeded in ex changing our "hearts," our feelings, for these goods—particularly those feel ings that permit us to identify with, to be attuned to, the spirit of external Nature—"this sea," "the winds," as well as "the moon" and the "sleeping flowers"— so that the spirit of nature no longer moves us. Disgusted with the heartless materialistic world, the poet stands on a "pleasant lea" beside the sea and, speaking now for himself (indicated in the shift from the first person plural to the first person singular), exclaims fervently to God that he "would rather be/ A Pagan" and see and "hear" nature made animate in the figures of the mythical sea gods Triton and Proteus than be completely "forlorn," that is, continually unreceptive and unresponsive to the spirit of divinity in nature. If such is the conventional reading of this sonnet, its appeal can be readily appreciated. A tired businessman, irritated by his usual daily frus trations, can find occasion for consolation and refreshment in a sentimental vacation in the country, which is symbolically expressed in this poem's brief excursion into nature, and there recharge or purify his exhausted and corrupted spirit. Thus the archetypal image of Mother Nature is intelligible to him. Or, on the other hand, an equally sentimental reader, critical of the unpleasant need of making a living in the harsh, unaccommodating world, finds support and consolation for his rebellious ego in Wordsworth's severe indictment of the brutal and callous enemy. Like his counterpart in the business world, and with Wordsworth's blessing and example, he seeks infantile escape back to the bosom of Mother Nature. While the prose content of the poem seems relatively clear, the important question is how well Wordsworth has integrated emotion and idea in a coherent and organically textured work of art and how completely he has avoided the obvious danger of sentimentality. He has attempted to provide coherence through the use of nature imagery which follows a twofold pattern. We can discover a division between auditory images and visual images. The auditory images concern themselves with the music of nature with which we are "out of tune." Included in this group are the sounded images of the howling winds and Triton's horn, 327</page><page sequence="2">associated with the sound of the stormy sea, and the contrasting image of silence, the winds "unfolded now like sleeping flowers." The visual images concern themselves with the "glimpses" of nature which the poet hopes will make him less forlorn. Here we have the opposing scenes of serenity and storm: the calm surface of the sea bared to the moon and the "pleasant lea," and in con trast the motion of the waves associated with Proteus, and the storm suggested by the noisy blasts of Triton's horn. These contrasts are obviously important to the underlying conception of the poem, for in trying to suggest the presence of life in nature, Wordsworth points to the two extreme kinds of spirit that nature exhibits. One of the qualities which leads the poet to see life in it is its changefulness. The processes of nature resemble the processes of all living things. True, these contrasting sets of auditory and visual images are integrated into a discernible pattern. Demonstrating Wordsworth's artistic conscience and craftsmanship, they do serve to structure the poem as well as to provide a complex picture of the extreme changeability of nature's moods. But this struc ture is not completely effective because it is almost entirely on a sensuous and emotional level. A further examination of these images reveals aesthetic and intellectual conflicts which keep the poem from achieving total success. The sonnet exhibits the traditional octave-sestet division with Wordsworth's frequent run-on eighth line. In determining the relationship between these two parts, we discover the first significant logical failing, significant because it characterizes the loose thinking which undermines this poem and leaves it a disappointingly sentimental work. The thought of the sestet begins with an exclamation, "Great God'. I'd rather be/ A Pagan. ..." The rest of the work makes it clear that "Pagan" is the key word in this section. The first crucial defect is the choice of the words "Great God." This expression becomes start lingly inappropriate when we realize that it is followed by a statement of his preference for paganism. Is it apostrophe? That hardly seems likely unless Wordsworth was aiming at a shocking effect. As exclamation it is merely flat and colloquial. Whether exclamation or apostrophe, it introduces an irrelevant and unintegrated monotheistic conception which clashes with polytheistic paganism. It becomes an unresolved irony that clashes with its context. It gives us a sense of carelessness on the poet's part, and its inappropriateness renders it not richly ironic but merely comical. The expression "I'd rather be/ A Pagan" points to a relationship of con trast between the octave and sestet. But what is being opposed to paganism? What is the alternative? We would expect to find it contrasted with Christianity, or more generally with any modern religious attitude. But that contrast is not being used. The contrast is actually not to be found in the octave-sestet relationship but rather in the opening quatrain. The opposing terms are "world" and "nature," with paganism being equated with nature. Here a serious problem enters. In the first place, the opposing terms, while they may seem conventional enough to be relatively clear, are so poorly defined as to leave the poem ex cessively vague and in danger of becoming merely an extended cliche. What is the referent of "world"? The words "getting and spending" suggest the world of practical concerns which blind us to beauty and spirit. On the other hand, the controlling dichotomy of world-nature suggests that the referent is the universe as man has transformed or corrupted it, the spiritually dead world as differen 328</page><page sequence="3">tiated from living nature. But in neither instance does the poem exhibit a thoughtful response to reality which merits the reader's attention. If we adopt the first alternative, the world of practical concerns, then the poet's desire to seek refuge in paganism proves so weak intellectually that the sestet can have little meaning. How is paganism an answer to wordliness? Was not paganism worldly in the world of its time? Of course, it existed in a more primitive culture. This may lead us to think naively of ancient people as living in a less demanding, confusing, and distracting world, as a result of which they were all normally more sensitive to the beauty and spirituality of nature. But if that is what Wordsworth had in mind, then it was not the religion of nature which he sought but cultural primitivism. In that case the sestet loses most of its significance and the poem becomes a commonplace objection to the fact that materialism dulls our sensibilities. But if we adopt the second alternative, the corrupted universe, then Wordsworth himself bears witness in another work to a weakness of this poem. In a different frame of mind he wrote his sonnet on Westminster Bridge, in which he could say of the city of London that "Earth has not anything to show more fair," that the city could wear "The beauty of the morning," and that even this man made aspect of the world has life, for "the very houses seem asleep/ And all that mighty heart is lying still." The problem we are facing is not one of the absence of consistency in two poems by the same author, for clearly the experience of different moments need not agree. It is the much more important fact that the earlier poem disproves the assertion of the second poem, for even the world has beauty in it if properly perceived. And if the problem is merely that the world is "too much" with us, then the flight to paganism as a total escape from the practical demands of life cannot be an adequate response. That is no more a balance than is excessive materialism. Wordsworth's use of the term "nature" is equally puzzling. Is he concerned with nature as an aesthetic or a spiritual fact? What is there in nature that is ours? Only by answering these questions can we understand exactly what "powers" we lay waste in getting and spending. The expression here, unfortunately, is obscure. However, we may assume that Wordsworth had in mind the sense of beauty in nature, the variety of nature's moods, and the sense of spiritual kinship with it, for lines 5-8 suggest the first two and the remainder of the poem suggests the third. The powers, then, seem to be a sensitivity to beauty in nature and an awareness of the presence in it of spirit. In the fifth line Wordsworth introduces the suckling image, which is repeated in line 10. The image is significant even if we restrain ourselves from exploring its Freudian implications. The poet feels in great need of spiritual sustenance and turns to Mother Nature for nourishment; later he seeks it from paganism. Since suckling is an image of infancy, the sonnet calls to mind the "Intimations of Immortality," where the suckling infant has a keener awareness of natural beauty than he will ever have again. Unconsciously, the poet seems to be yearning for that state once more. But while this archetypal image of the poet nursing at the breast of Mother Nature is potentially most effective, there is an inconsistency between its use in the octave and its use in the sestet which points once again to carelessness or failing powers of construction. In the first division the poet images the tranquil sea, when seen against the rounded horizon, as baring "her bosom to the moon," while in the second he pictures himself as suckling on 329</page><page sequence="4">outworn pagan beliefs. So far so good. Then he proceeds anthropomorphically, but most unfortunately, to image the maternal sea in terms of masculine figures of myth, Triton and Proteus. Wordsworth does use in both divisions the same word—"sea"—and similar imagery of breast-feeding to provide a semblance of integration, but the content of the images proves to be startlingly inconsistent. It is true that the poem moves dynamically, but this is no virtue when it moves in opposite directions simultaneously (God vs. gods, female sea vs. male sea). The second quatrain, which continues the treatment of nature, presents some additional problems. In a sonnet Wordsworth could refer only briefly to typical aspects of nature to which we are blind, and here he chooses the sea and the winds. In his presentation of these two phenomena, we can see a common aim, the desire to project life into the natural world. This accounts for the presence in the seventh line of the simile "like sleeping flowers," which superficially seems nothing but a touch of the picturesque. But the winds have another sig nificance for him. It seems clear that the poem had its origin not in a moment of exaltation but in a moment of depression and frustration. Wordsworth writes that the winds are "ungathered now," and since "now" should refer to the time of the initial experience or of the composition of the poem, the quietness of the wind reflects the poet's unhappy and apathetic state of mind more than the balmy state of the weather. The "howling" winds, then, may have struck him as an effective symbol for the vitality which he found lacking in himself at that point and which he wanted so keenly to recover. For, as he stands on the "pleasant lea" beside the sea, Wordsworth discovers in himself an inability to respond to nature with his old intensity. He has a sense of spiritual and imaginative aridity and seeks out side himself for the kind of nourishment which will bring back his old vitality and sensitivity. This leads him to yearn for some more imaginative worldview as a creed at which he might suckle, thus obtaining the sustenance which will restore his wasted powers. Since paganism projected anthropomorphic gods into the natural world, Wordsworth feels momentarily that it would be an answer to his problem. Pagan animism would make every experience of the ocean, particu larly the lively ocean, an epiphany. Thus the sharp contrast between the howling winds and the sleeping winds, the stormy weather and the pleasant weather, suggests a contrast between the responsive and the unresponsive observer. Perhaps the trouble is, if we may comment briefly on the tone of the poem, that Wordsworth, under the influence of strong emotions at the moment, is much too earnest, much too irritated by the thought of worldliness to be able to write a good poem about his feelings against it. Is not the word "everything" (line 8) inappropriate in the context that Wordsworth provides for it? That is, does not Wordsworth really mean that the "world" is excluded from "everything"? Is not the referent of "everything" only "nature," or the experiences in nature? But "everything" should mean not only the experiences of nature but also the experiences of the world. Indeed, because the word is much too weak to stand such tension, it also suggests a hasty temper that precludes careful meditation. The poem seems lacking in objectivity, and the emotions do not appear to have undergone a sifting process in time, to have been recollected in tranquil lity, as it were, so that they could be rendered in an aesthetically effective fashion. Moreover, to continue with this interpretation of the tone, there is a curious shift from the first person plural in the octave to the first person singular in the sestet. What does this signify? It seems to us that Wordsworth 330</page><page sequence="5">never meant "we" and "us" seriously, and the sudden change to "I" is much like the throwing off of a mask. Had his concern with others been sincere, perhaps the poem would have gained an element of objectivity which it now lacks. This objectivity might have modified the shrillness with which the poem at present advocates the virtues of simple naturalism, a shrillness which indicates a loss of control of the experience. While sympathetic readers may be attracted by the earnestness of this work and intrigued by the agreeable image of breast feeding at the bosom of Mother Nature, the poem suffers from the absence of a leavening irony which might have given it the conviction and effectiveness which it now lacks. The second quatrain undoubtedly strikes most readers as the weakest part of the poem. Is it because it lacks the dramatic assertiveness of the first and last sections? That is only part of the answer. The weakness stems too from an uneasy conjunction of imagery here. The animism present in both the sea and the wind images is not enough to weld them successfully. While the sea is viewed as a source of nourishment, the winds are treated so superficially as to seem almost an afterthought. Indeed, the use of the future tense in line 6 suggests this possibility. Did Wordsworth recognize that the images were out of balance and did he try to correct this by devoting two lines to the wind? Perhaps, but this does not solve the problem. The fact is that it is largely the sea that concerns him, and the wind is so slighted as to seem a purposeless intrusion. But there is an even more fundamental defect than the clash of unresolved ironies and the lack of balanced objectivity, and this is the clash between image and theme. Wordsworth's choice of the gods Proteus and Triton was, of course, not accidental. They are effective in strengthening the nature imagery in the second quatrain and in suggesting the presence of mind in nature. Triton's horn, which suggests the noisy blasts of the sea winds, parallels and reinforces the image of the howling winds in line 6. Proteus, the oracular sea god, had the power of changing his shape at will and hence represents the dynamic quality of the sea in motion. As we suggested earlier, these indications of change support the underlying assumption of life in nature. But while these mythological figures reinforce the imagery of the poem, they clash with the implied moral attitude. We cannot avoid asking an embarrassing question: What is the value of an attitude towards nature which reveals the presence of such totally amoral forces behind it? How comforting can it be for man to see the natural world as a reflection of such controlling figures? It may be objected that we are taking Wordsworth too literally and at taching too much importance to his use of the term "pagan" and to his choice of these gods, which are, after all, merely being used as suggestive symbols of an immanent deity. But our point is that there is altogether too much vague sug gestiveness in this poem, so that in the end the poem fails to emerge as a perceptive response to reality. When close examination of these gods reveals such disappointing superficiality of thought, we are left with a "pretty piece of paganism," to quote Wordsworth's own comment on Keats's poetry. It is clear that nature always was morally significant to Wordsworth, but this sonnet fails rather seriously to support such significance. It is dubious that the reader can accept the notion that it is better to see even pagan gods in nature rather than no spirit at all, and what is more important, Wordsworth fails to convince us that he took the idea seriously himself. Once we reach this point, the poem becomes seriously weakened for us. 331</page><page sequence="6">When we now take an overview of the poem, considering Wordsworth's com plaint against the world, his desire to recover his sensitivity by somehow being nursed by nature, and his suggestion that a different upbringing or religious attitude might have assured him a lifelong responsiveness, the sonnet appears finally to be overweighted with sentimentality. Not because the emotion is too great for the occasion, but because the emotion present lacks an adequate intel lectual basis and because it is not perfectly controlled. The poem as a whole thus becomes a somewhat irritable attempt on Wordsworth's part to find something outside himself to blame for his own failing powers. We see this quality more clearly when we compare Coleridge's "Dejection" with Wordsworth's "Intimations of Immortality." Coleridge manfully faces the fact that his impressions of the world are a product of his own state of mind and that since he has nothing left to give once his joy has departed, he can receive nothing. The failure is his own, not the world's. In contrast, Wordsworth equivocates. If any failure is his, it is, he asserts, merely the failure which is inevitable in the process of growth, for the years invariably deprive us of the imaginative vision of our childhood; therefore, this failure is not actually a personal shortcoming. But even in the end Wordsworth will not accept the facts but must console himself with a belief in "truths that wake,/ To perish never," or "In the primal sympathy/ Which having been must ever be." Therefore, when he is forced to face the fact that life has lost much of its comfort and reassurance, when he feels that he can no longer sense the presence of spirit in nature, the fault must be outside himself, in the world that, in some uncertain way, is both too much with us and against us. When we remember how little, comparatively, the world was with or even against him up in the Lake country, the conviction is strengthened in us that the sonnet is characterized more by fretfulness than by a mature, sensitive response to reality.
