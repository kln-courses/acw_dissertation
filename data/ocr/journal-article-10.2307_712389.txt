Similar economy in the provision of evidence elsewhere creates misleading impressions: in his discussion of the library catalogue in early Anglo-Saxon England (p. 342), for example, I. fails to take account of pertinent evidence, however, incomplete, to which he had referred earlier (p. 337), i.e. Bede's and Alcuin's inventories; thus he affords an exaggerated impression of the dependence of the English libraries from the tenth century onwards (cf. 'follow') on the continental pattern. By contrast with the detail of this same discussion of the development of library catalogues an earlier statement that 'Bede followed standard library order' (p. 279) puts into sharp focus a further weakness in I.'s work, a frequently careless and scant regard for chronological context. This carelessness leads to bizarre statements such as that 'In the Roman era... the "priest" of the Museum was appointed by Augustus' (p. 40); likewise,' For the early Empire, I will draw on three main sources-Suetonius, Varro, and Quintilian' (p. 49, my italics) requires a word of explanation; elsewhere we may note an unqualified and apparently loose use of terms such as ' post-classical' (cf. p. 141). A certain weakness may frequently be observed in I.'s translation of quotations, of which his translation of the definitions of ars and the status of grammatica in Diomedes' Ars Grammatica (p. 64) may serve as a representative sample. Both this poor translation and the poor standard exhibited in the proof-reading of the Latin texts quoted give rise to the suspicion that I. concentrates his main attention on his translations rather than on the original texts. Despite the above criticisms of the errors in his approach and within the structure of his arguments, the strongest impression left by a reading of I.'s work is of a more minor but nevertheless equally frustrating deficiency, i.e. his manner of expression. Individual sentences are frequently too terse, to the extent that on one occasion I found I.'s English to be clarified only by a quotation in Latin. Ironically, however, and perhaps through a perverse anxiety to ensure his readers' comprehension, one such terse expression often leads to the repetition of the same thought in a number of equally terse guises. At the outset of his work I. proclaims that this book is the first part of a two- volume study, the second to investigate the implications of'grammatica' for 12th- to 14th-century literary culture. Since on balance the interest of the present work far outweighs its frustrations, we can look forward to the publication of this second volume, only hoping for the rectification of the defects outlined above and, in particular, of the questionable practice of 'going east to reach the west.'

Oxford University Press, 1995</page><page sequence="2">278 THE CLASSICAL REVIEW Schofield's clear-headed The Presocratic Philosophers or with Jonathan Barnes's exciting The Presocratic Philosophers. Kirk, Raven and Schofield report the views of the early philosophers with scholarly accuracy and make a fair-minded judgement of their relative importance. Barnes supposes that philosophy is first and last about argument; and his book is a vigorous reconstruction of Presocratic argument. In Philosophy before Socrates M. has followed the K.R.S. route (in the chapter on Xenophanes perhaps excessively so); but he sometimes misses what makes the Presocratics philosophers. Why should Thales (who said some pretty peculiar things) be included in a history of philosophy where Hesiod (who said plenty of sensible things) is not? M. offers several criteria to the Milesians' advantage: they have a conception of rational order, they abandon anthropomorphism and 'mythological ways of thought' (whatever those are), they are innovators, not traditionalists. What he does not do with clarity (and what reflection on Barnes should have revealed to him) is show just how any of these thinkers might have been reasoning. He tends to follow the modern orthodoxy (Thales postulated the originative stuff for cosmogony; Anaximander probably likewise; while Anaximenes was talking about the material of the present world); but he does not systematically tackle how this comes out as argument, or just why it should be called philosophy. The central chapters of the book are largely sensible and the commentary reasonable, if sometimes badly signposted. But sometimes argumentative clarity is still missing. Consider three examples. The old chestnut about whether Parmenides, in establishing the nature of what is, commits a modal fallacy is glossed far too quickly, and explained by a quotation from Owen which is uncharacteristically muddled (it conflates the failure to treat 'nothing' as a negative existential with the de dicto/de re modal fallacy) (p. 164). The argument of Melissus (which Barnes gives a good run for its money) is dismally dismissed as a failure to deploy modus tollens properly (p. 296). And the Atomists' brilliant use of the ou mallon argument, funda- mental not only to their defence of what is not but also to their mechanistic account of the universe, is merely mentioned as 'another use of the principle of sufficient reason' (p. 308), and never accounted for either as a response to Parmenides' own use of sufficient reason, or as a principle in the causal mechanisms of the universe. M.'s last two chapters give an account of the sophists in the context of fifth- century moral thought; their inclusion in a book of this size seems misguided for two reasons. Firstly, M. explains fifth-century moral thought against the background of (a little) Pindar and Theognis and, for the nomos-phusis debate, Thucydides. This selection seems both odd and desperately thin-if there is to be a representation of 'Greek moral thought' (a dangerous task itself), surely this is not it. There is no Homer, no Herodotus, none of the orators (vital, surely, for understanding the sophists) and, most troubling of all, no tragedy-for, M. maintains, none of this is actually moral philosophy. I was left wondering just what he thinks moral philosophy is (is it not what Aeschylus is doing in the Eumenides ? Or Sophocles in the Antigone? If not, why not?). Secondly, M. considers whether the sophists count as philosophers on the basis of two criteria: dealing in arguments and caring for the truth (why would Aeschylus fail either test?). By virtue of the former criterion, M. supposes, the sophists count as philosophers (Anaxagoras might fail); on the ethical criterion, they fail (so might Zeno). But are these the right criteria for supposing someone to count as a philosopher? Philosophy has one peculiar characteristic: it deploys not only reasons, but reasons for reasons: philosophers don't just think, they think about thinking.</page><page sequence="3">279 THE CLASSICAL REVIEW From the Milesians on, the Greek philosophers seem to have been considering the principles of rationality as well as theories themselves. They asked not just which material principle to pose, but what constraints might operate on their postulates- should they be as parsimonious as possible? If not, why not? Should similar cases be explained in similar ways? Should the explanations of things be analogous to the things, or quite different? M. never gives us the sense that philosophy has this vital higher order component, nor that there might be a radical difference between philosophy and science, or philosophy and moralism. The translations are on the whole good, with one glaring exception. Instead of Protagoras'' Man is the measure of all things' we have' A human being is the measure of all things'. At least as Plato reports it, Protagoras said 'man', not 'a man'. This could, of course, have been carelessness (although the careful rhetoric of the other sophists might tell against that); but it could have been designed to preserve the ambiguity of anthropos (as the expression 'human being' cannot): is it general or particular,' mankind' or ' a man' ? For reflection on the rival claims of mild cultural relativism and radical, individual relativism would force Protagoras' audience into general reflection about the principles of knowledge and truth. Now that may have been Plato's point, not Protagoras' (our evidence for the sophists is contaminated by Plato); nonetheless, the richness of what they might have said should not be invaded by creeping political correctness. How, then, will M. fare in the competition with K. R. S. ? His book is sensible, if not earthshaking; and he has the advantage of Hackett's excellent low pricing policy. He gives no Greek; and this, to the modern Greekless student, might be thought an advantage. On the other hand, those of us battling for the survival of the ancient language might be happy to see students aware that these passages are translations (and hence interpretations which are themselves open to dispute) and then just sometimes inclined to learn to translate for themselves.

Who is this Socrates? B. and S. make it clear that he is primarily a character in Plato's early dialogues. Like Gregory Vlastos, they make a sharp distinction between this Socrates and the one who appears in the middle dialogues. Unlike Vlastos, they avoid claiming that the early Socrates must be the historical one, limiting themselves to the view that in the early dialogues there is a coherent philosophy concerning how we should live. B. and S. point out that Socrates uses any appropriate means to examine the people he talks to. The subject of examination is really a human life and the aim is to identify how to live one. How can Socrates achieve this by refuting other people's views? Their answer is simple: if he has refuted a wide enough range of views about how to live he can have a reasonable confidence in the views that have survived challenge. Their treatment of the Socratic profession of ignorance makes it compatible with the ? Oxford University Press, 1995</page></plain_text>
