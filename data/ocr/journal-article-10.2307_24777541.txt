<plain_text><page sequence="1">Memoirs Found in a Bathtub: Stanislaw Lem's Critique of Cybernetics JOHNROTHFORK "The worship of technique is in fact becoming the dominant religious reality of our culture" (Frederick Ferre, Shaping the Future) Had René Descartes written fiction, it might well have resembled that of Stanislaw Lern. For Descartes first called attention to the possibility of separating the activity or process of consciousness from its products. Lem's work largely illustrates this epistemological concern, demonstrating how we acquire a paradigmatic vision or gestalt within which we construct models of the truth; we seek, he observes in Memoirs Found in a Bathtub (1973), "the Cause of the Effect, the Effect that in turn causes Action, and so a con tinuity is established" becoming "the chains that bind us."1 There are six million copies of Lem's novels, short stories and plays in print throughout East Europe and the Soviet Union. Over a dozen of his works have been translated into English. Among the best known are Solaris (1970; the Soviets made a major film from this novel), The Cyberiad (1974; perhaps his best work), The Futurological Congress (1974), and The Star Diaries (1976). Trained to be a physician, and "brought up with the scientific outlook" by his father who was also a physician, he subsequently "spent many hours over coffee arguing about God" with his friend Karol Wojtlya who taught theology in Krackow and who is now better known as Pope John-Paul II. In a recent interview, Lem indicated his current thinking on religion: "for moral reasons I am an atheist—for moral reasons. I am of the opinion that you would recognize a creator by his creation, and the world appears to me to be put together in such a painful way that I prefer to Mosaic XVII/4 0027-1276-84/010053-19 $01.50 © Mosaic</page><page sequence="2">54 John Rothfork believe that it was not created by anyone than to think that somebody created this intentionally."2 In the broadest view, Lem's work explores the nature of consciousness and how it constructs relational fields or gestalts to search for truths. More specifically, like the science historian Thomas Kuhn—who speaks for a tradition going back to David Hume and René Descartes—Lern explains that science is a game that constructs models to reveal relationships that would otherwise be unrecognized. Sensitive to both the epistemic limits of science and the power of technology, Lem feels that "Directly, man will probably never be able to understand and recognize everything, but in an indirect manner he will be able to get a command of everything." Thus in science today, "we are talking about things which are no longer within the grasp of our senses. The scientist's mathematical apparatus is like a cane in the hand of a blind man. He doesn't see the world directly, but by hitting the ground with his cane he can hear the echo and can recognize whether he is coming close to an obstacle. But you cannot really say that the blind man is thus able to see a wall. And by this circuitous route we continue to manipulate things. In other words, all knowledge is subjective."3 However, this game can also become an end in itself, a technique obscuring instead of illuminating the reality it seeks. Thus David Lovekin warns: "As technical consciousness develops and as the body and other natural objects retreat to the perceptual and conceptual horizon, the object of technical consciousness becomes technical consciousness itself."4 In Memoirs Found in a Bathtub, Lem extrapolates effects of a cybernetic psychology to demonstrate how the arbitrary models it might build could proliferate, both in number and technique, finally to subvert the process of discovering depth and meaning through involvement in archetypal patterns and rituals. This indicates why critics like Leslie Fiedler feel that "Lem fears language, which, controlled by bureaucrats and theologians, can distort our perception of the world."5 However, language and cybernetics refer to tech nique, not to foundations. The fundamental clash, revealed in Memoirs, is between the paradigm of cybernetic psychology and that of depth psycholo gies. Consequently, cybernetics must be driven to confront philosophically the depth of human situations, to recognize what Michael Polanyi calls, "the tacit dimension," if it is to be anything more than another expedient technique : for "technique cannot produce the philosophy that directs it."6 Referring to this crisis of technique without philosophical foundation, in the realm of literature, Brice Parain, a French language philosopher, notes: "This is the insoluble problem that poetry today is grimly trying to resolve and which is exhausting it. We must find an end other than mere narration for our words, otherwise they will end up being thrust back down our throats."7 In Memoirs, Lem illustrates the inadequacy, and the ultimately life-destroying character, of technique which is invented, that is, cybernetics and technology. Now it is true that in his nonfiction, such as his Summa Technologiae (untranslated in English), Lem seeks to define cybernetics and technology</page><page sequence="3">Lern 's Critique of Cybernetics 55 as morally neutral epistemological structures. But such a situation should not prevent us from allowing Memoirs to make its own dramatic statement on technique. And this is especially important in light of Lem's semiotic theory of literature. For, as Jerzy Jarzebski has noted, "Lem considers the processes of literary communication as play, and yet establishing the socially recognized meaning of a work is a process of stabilizing meanings within changing cultures. He relies upon the apparatus of the information theory, probability theory, and the theory of games....[He treats] the meaning of a literary work as the result of stochastic processes."8 * ♦ * "Cybernetics," a term derived from the Greek word for "steersman," denotes a system of goal-oriented actions modified by feedback to determine the difference between a present state and the ideal state or the goal. The essential characteristic of a cybernetic system is the lack of predetermined specific technique. It is radically utilitarian in being able to use trial and error to test, any and all, available alternatives to reach a goal. Thus, the feedback loop allows change and creates the semblance of decision and choice. If an observer is not cautious to recognize the pathetic fallacy of how he attributes his own intentions and motives to the system, especially if it is a complex system such as those of computer science, it is easy to imagine that there is a "tacit dimension"—an intelligence or consciousness—at work behind the activities, independent of the observer. Memoirs is a dramatic illustration of this fallacy. The narrator of the Memoirs finds himself in situations defined by relations that are arbitrary choices in a cybernetic system. Consequently, his attempts to fathom the meaning of sequences or symbols is futile ; his life is a nightmare which cannot be interpreted. In contrast to the temporary and entirely pragmatic steps in a cybernetic system, myth, which originates in dreams and the unconscious—from what Polanyi calls, "the spontaneous organization of mind"—reifies methods into rituals, archetypes and social patterns which eclipse the pragmatic ends they serve.9 For example, in India, Hinduism is called the "eternal law" (sanatana dharma) which, as in The Lawbook of Manu, specifies situations and appropriate action, depending on the time of life, social relations (caste), and stage of development or level of understanding of the actor. Most people are absorbed in the technique specified by the myths and archetypes that provide meaning to their lives.10 In a sense, then, people who accept myths literally and expend their psychic effort in fantasied dialogues with mythic characters in a system of mythic patterns, remain asleep, living in a dream which pervades the more public world." Enraptured in the steps of a timeless dance, those immersed in a mythic world view do not perceive life as an instrument to reach a goal, and hence little regard methodological or prag matic thinking about how to reach goals most efficiently. Life is considered a dance, not a cybernetic network.</page><page sequence="4">56 John Rothfork However, there is also the recognition in the Indian tradition that it is futile to continue responding or playing prescribed roles in mythic systems, because these are endless. To escape these fundamentally sorrowful roles, the dreamer must awaken, cease to respond unthinkingly, and begin to perceive an entire pattern. In this way he becomes free to choose which parts to play, how long to play them and, most importantly, he achieves a psychological independence from the character he plays. Knowing that his acts are prescribed by a pattern or culture, the actor gains an esthetic distance that enriches the drama by creating depth. Joseph Campbell puts this succinctly: "The constriction of consciousness, to which we owe the fact that we see not the source of the universal power but only the phenomenal forms reflected from that power, turns superconsciousness into unconsciousness and, at the same instant and by the same token, creates the world. Redemption consists in the return to superconsciousness and therewith the dissolution of the world."12 The opposite of this is the obsessive personality, the manic, who feels compelled to win at any cost. Thus, he often plays the game so desperately that he goes mad and finally can play no role. The pattern becomes night mare. The view of madness, of technique, was stated by Henry Adams when he wrote: "Chaos was the law of nature; Order was the dream of man."13 Today, one of the dreamers, a theologian no less, writes that, "technique brings an end to the mythological conception of transcendence."14 Corres pondingly, Lem's narrator, wandering in an an endless maze of corridors, cannot even conceive of a reality transcending technique. The nightmare described by Memoirs is the result of intersecting cyber nectic systems. Ritual actions are abstracted from Christianity, capitalism and nationalistic militarism. They then become fused by short-circuiting to create a nexus or technique without meaning or goal, so that, "words now merely mean other words, symbols mean other symbols," and "the natural world, the world of nature," is "replaced by...the world of technique" (Love kin, pp. 203, 206). A recognition that this paradigm of technique is warped can be made only by someone standing outside the system. Because the author of the Memoirs is a product of cybernetic psychology, he has recourse only to technique and not judgment. Thus, he repeatedly attempts to find psychological depth and meaning in his artificial and broken world, even as many of us try to find meaning in a world fabricated by the technologies of Madison Avenue, Wall Street, Hollywood, the Pentagon, and Crystal Cathedral of Rev. Schuller. ♦ ♦ * Memoirs is prefaced by an apocryphal introduction written by a thirty second-century historian attempting to reconstruct life inside the "Third Pentagon," the last insane refuge of the "American Ministry of Defense"; it is "a kind of collective military brain" (p. 10) produced after "the Great Collapse" when all paper was destroyed. Lem does not articulate the steps</page><page sequence="5">Lern 's Critique of Cybernetics 57 of the "papyralysis" which destroys our world, but with this fictional incident he invites readers to consider a cybernetic history. In fact the Canadian historian, Harold Innis, proposed such a theory and found an articulate spokesman for it in Marshall McLuhan.15 Innis used Marx's historical par adigm, substituting cybernetics for economics as the fundamental mechan ism. Thus, Innis suggested that information systems cause the social patterns that emerge in any era. Consequently, in a very literal sense, the means (technique) cause the end, as Marx said. For Innis, the key to any historical period is the communication system it used. For example, Innis suggests that cuneiform script, ziggurats and pyramids imposed a strong temporal mythic ontology which fostered an identification with timeless, other-worldly values, whereas the Homeric oral tradition fused its technique of linear chronology with the alphabet and papyrus to create a spatially oriented paradigm evident in the roads of the Roman Empire. According to Innis, paper largely created the Renaissance, or at least the conditions necessary for the Renaissance, and led to the triumph of the spacial model and the conse quent suppression of the oral tradition and its products: myth, epics, religion. Marshall McLuhan turned from history to speculate on the future, suggest ing that as we use more electronic media—especially television—we will spend less time reading and writing and consequently will lose the bias toward linear or sequential thinking and inhabit a "global village."16 Lem's "papyralysis" is a metaphor for this process. Using McLuhan's favorite metaphor, we might imagine each ego to be a television monitor tuned to the program of society. The crucial question—which may be already answered by the choice of the machine metaphor—is, how is the program produced? Is it created by myth and archetypes originating in dreams, which in turn originate in the uncon scious and hence in life itself; or is it produced by a cybernetic system where the goal is everything and the process arbitrary? Myth, says Thomas Mann, "is the foundation of life...the pious formula into which life flows when it reproduces its traits out of the unconscious."17 But in this age of "artificial intelligence," the unconscious is considered only a ghost in the machine. Memoirs shows a world entailed in the paradigm of cybernetic psychology. Lem accepts the cybernetic metaphysics—as old as Leucippus and Demo critus—that the world is built up from atomic factual bits, and consequently rejects the tacit dimension and the creative unconscious. Several stories in Lem's Memoirs of a Space Traveler deal with such issues. In one, we are told of "the dream of cyberneticists—a self organizing substance." The shadow of the Greek atomists is further apparent in Lem's admission: "Actually, I am influenced primarily by various philosophers. Bertrand Russell, Wittgen stein—the so-called 'Viennese Circle.'"18 Thus, Lem fictionally agrees to imagine a world modeled from a cybernetic paradigm. A space probe brings back a catalyst that instantly destroys paper. Thus all linear culture and thinking, based on reading and writing, are lost; people are "deprived of their identity," lose "their reason," and their technology : "the supply of goods broke down" (p. 3). They are immersed in mythic non-linear patterns which,</page><page sequence="6">58 John Rothfork to be precise, should not be called "mythic," because they do not and cannot originate from dreams and the unconscious, since these are denied any reality. This pseudo-myth is the product of a cybernetic system which, since it has lost the goal provided for it by the unconscious, can never end. And, because the endlessly repeated actions are arbitrary techniques and not organic patterns of growth which culminate in transcendence, there is only the simulation of myth, just as there is only a simulation of conscious language use by computers. The "papyralysis" destroys our world like a house of cards: "technology, research and development, schools—all crumbled into nonexistence." In the new medieval "global village," knowledge is again "disseminated orally." The ecology of paradigmatic views, sustained by what Polanyi calls "self determining communities : of scientists, scholars, lawyers, and judges, artists of all sorts, and churchmen," is lost.19 There is no faith, no commitment to visions defining these communities. Instead, there are simulations: inconse quential cybernetic "choices" of technique within a monolithic and reduc tive bureaucracy. "The human race knew next to nothing of its own past" (pp. 3-5). But in mythic, dreaming societies, such as ancient India, the past is the future, the present an eternal dream. Though Lem agrees fictionally to destroy the modern world, he cannot agree simply to start human evolution over again. Thus the cybernetic post modern world is necessarily built from pieces scavenged from the old world. However, we know from Kuhn's work that pieces taken from a precedent paradigm do not fit into new paradigms. For example, in the shift from Newton to Einstein, even the most basic definitions of time, space and causa tion changed. In the nightmare montage of Memoirs, pieces from several of Polanyi's self-determining communities are fused into a cybernetic mono lith, symbolized by the buried pyramid.20 Instead of a succession of paradigm shifts, in which the current paradigm subsumes the old, such as happened with Copernicus and Ptolemy, there is a medieval reductionism capitulating to one implicit faith, cybernetics, which jumbles the structures cannibalized from other paradigms in endless and random technique. Thus Lem's historian explains that the "worship of the deity Kap-Eh-Taahl...became one of the dominant cults." The deity was also called "Almighty Da-Laahr" and had a religious order called stock brokers devoted to an appraisal of its fluctuations. Understanding the nature of this deity is difficult because "Kap-Eh-Taahl was denied any supernatural existence...he was, to all extents and purposes, equated with assets, liquid, fixed, and hidden, and had no existence beyond that" (p. 7). To be sure, this satire is aimed at Jeremy Bentham and Adam Smith, but it does not end there. If it did, Lem would no doubt propose a counter tech nique and a counter paradigm, such as Marxism or Christianity. He does not, because his deeper aim is to cause a shock of recognition by showing us how deeply we profess technique, how easy it is for us to accent that man is machine, and that the life of the mind is calculation, not judgment. Relevant</page><page sequence="7">Lern 's Critique of Cybernetics 59 here is Hannah Arendt's criticism of the cybernetic faith and its icon, the computer: "there exists no metaphor that could plausibly illuminate this special activity of the mind, in which something invisible within us deals with the invisibles of the world."21 Although Arendt's The Life of the Mind is thoroughly grounded in the Western tradition, this statement, like so many others that oppose cybernetic psychology, appeals to the East which has recognized Arendt's point since the time of the Upanishads and the historical Buddha. In a dialogue with the Zen patriarch, D. T. Suzuki, Erich Fromm stated the obvious Western position which has led us to the machine and the psychology of the machine : "The West, for two thousand years (and with only few exceptions, such as the mystics) has believed that a final answer to the problem of existence can be given in thought; the 'right answer' in reli gion and in philosophy is of paramount importance."22 Lem's forthcoming novel, Golem XIV (1985), is based on the idea of a supercomputer as "a creature which has no 'I,' no ego."23 Although he does not call it karma, he does say that "Human intelligence or rationality is not free...because it is meant to operate the body in its struggle for survival.... Golem considers itself to be the first intelligent creature liberated from these bounds [karma]" Thus Golem, "in its own spiritual life...does not have any ego, any concrete personality." This is also said to be the condition of a Hindu saint, a jivan-mukti (a life free from karma), or a Theravada Buddhist saint, an Arhant (one in whom the flame of desire is extinguished). Lem says that in his novel many people do not believe this condition of consciousness can exist. "But Golem takes the position that conditions of awareness can be experienced by a material system, as opposed to a spiritual one..." These, and other epistemological parallels with Asian thought, remain largely vestigial in Lem's work. For his avowed allegiance is to positivism and cyber netics. Otherwise he could not, without more qualification, say, "Even in the Far East God is an anthropomorphic conception" (Engel, pp. 232, 236). Nonetheless, such parallels between East and West may be of crucial impor tance in reconciling contemporary science and traditional values. Nor should we be dissuaded from identifying such parallels by the intentional fallacy or critical pedantry. The major shrine in the world preceding that of Memoirs was a pyramid, an abstracted and stylized computer, called the Pentagon, "where crusades were planned against the Heathen Dog" (p. 8). A Second Pentagon was built, mostly underground, signifying a dislocation of reality by neurotic repression, a descent into the machine. References to a Third Pentagon were thought to be entirely mythic, the structure "raised purely in the minds and hearts of the faithful" (p. 9). However, the Third Pentagon did exist in the NORAD military complex inside Cheyenne Mountain, Colorado. And it was to this pyramid-ark that the faithful went, when "the populace of Ammer Ka went over to the side of the 'heretics.'" In a surreal parody of American millennial and Utopian fantasies, the Third Pentagon sealed itself from the profane world and "thrived exclusively on the myth, the legend of the glory</page><page sequence="8">60 John Rothfork that was Kap-Eh-Taahl" (p. 11). This is no longer John Winthrop's "beacon on a hill" shining the good news of a perfected community to the rest of the world. It is Brigham Young's Zion walled from the profane world, implod ing in paranoia and neurotically distorted myth. Memoirs is a carnival-mirror image of Bunyan's Pilgrim 's Progress in which Christian goes in circles. It is a personal confession—an amalgam of Kafka and Kierkegaard—written by someone trapped in a cybernetic world. Human questions concerning identity and destiny are unanswerable because there are only "data" and not life. The narrator is a product of an artificial world where all relations are cybernetic "choices" made in pursuit of a lost goal; for example, military discipline maintained to retaliate after the total annihiliation of the nation which the military once served. Such cybernetic processes form a circle of insanity. Each step logically leads to the next, but they ultimately close in a circle. Moreover, the processes are so intricate and complex that they mask their futility. This is the world of sophisticated technology: end less fluorescent-lit corridors without exit. This is the Pentagon and the world of the space ship. It is the world of television. It is life conceived as data processing. It is the insane world brought into existence by the tunnel vision of computer science dedicated to a reductive technique which has no place for nature, the unconscious, emotions—in short, no place for man or even life. This is the cul-de-sac that Lem illustrates again and again : man creates a game which he plays so fanatically that he takes it more seriously than the life which caused it and on which it is dependent as a specialized function. This is the credo of fanaticism. In the East it is called heedlessness or ignorance (avidja) and is considered the cause of all suffering. Bondage (samsara) is the result of taking the game or technique more seriously than life or the tacit dimension. Until one awakens to transcend bondage, there can be only ceaseless incarnations or games. Life events remain discrete, unrelated mechanical jerks. Man becomes fragmented and without grace. For there are no evident archetypal patterns of harmony and growth. This mechanical paradigm of life is illustrated in Memoirs when the narrator is conducted through "the Department of Collections," a kind of nightmare temple, where he sees, "artificial ears, noses, bridges, fingernails, warts, eye lashes, boils and humps, some displayed in cross section to show the gears and springs inside" (p. 21). The dream is an obvious one of disintegration and mutilation caused by the technological paradigm, or more precisely, by what Jacques Ellul calls "technique"; it is the cybernetic psychology which con siders life events as arbitrary steps in a technical process.24 It is heedless of the tacit dimension, dreams and processes of the unconscious, not to mention God. Thus the myth of technique sees the origin of man in a factory of simulated body parts which can be related only mechanically. For there is no depth and no organic process precedent to consciousness; there is no spirit enlivening and transforming these into a living unity. There are body parts but no man. Instead of man, there is Frankenstein's boiler-plate jerking monster. Similarly, in the story "Doctor Diagoras" in Memoirs of a Space</page><page sequence="9">Lern 's Critique of Cybernetics 61 Traveler, a cybernetic scientist creates various living systems or creatures which he says "rise from the dead" (p. 128). Such statements, characteristic of Lem, annul the Romantic tradition and all biological-mystical thinking such as Bergson's élan vital or process theologies such as de Chardin's or Whitehead's. For these assume that life rises from some vital power which could not be referred to as "death." In a related scene at the end of the book, the narrator walks through a museum of hands: "hands severed at the wrist, often clasped in pairs on their glass shelves, very true-to-life, too true-to-life." There is "a forest of fingers" which suddenly all point to the narrator who feels held by "the numb and bloody hands of madness" (pp. 176-77). Because they are severed, the hands can grasp nothing. Technique is severed from life. There is no transcendent end to grasp, no organic life pattern. There is an endless circle, for as C. K. Lewis has observed of such situations, "the content of experience cannot evaluate or interpret itself."25 The dream is of castration, cut off from libido, from life. Like Kafka's Joseph K., the narrator wanders the subterranean tunnels of nightmare, entering random doors only to find he is expected as another bit of data to be processed. This leads him to believe that there must be a Master Plan, a master-program, and consequently, a master-programer. However, on the level of plot, this teleology is frustrated by the knowledge that events are cybernetic "choices" made pursuant to a garbled military strategy which is meaningless because the situation in which it may have made some sense is now entirely changed. This pseudo-mythic cybernetic pattern is a razor that can only mutilate life as it emerges from the unconscious to be patterned in politics, religion, art and labor. Lem illustrates the fallacy of cybernetic psychology, which always begins in-the-middle, by using atomic bits of data, which are not themselves elementary, but rather the result of a situation recognized by man. As a result of the situation, data are chosen and related. Making this same point, Hubert Dreyfus notes in What Computers Can't Do: "The human world, then, is prestructured in terms of human purposes and concerns in such a way that what counts as an object or is significant about an object already is a function of, or embodies, that concern. This cannot be matched by a computer, which can deal only with... con text-free objects."26 To escape the chains of technique, to use Lem's metaphor, we need only recognize that truth cannot exist in a vacuum as a principle ripped from the ecology that produced it, to be made into some all-explaining principle, such as economic determinism, the hedonistic calculus of utilitarianism, natural selection, the will to power, operant conditioning, cybernetic technique, or other varieties of scientism. If we consider the epistemology of model-building as not only the method by which we manifest truth, but also as life—the way the Indeterminate, the libido, or as the Hindus call it, shakti, becomes partially manifest—then we will be less likely to be blindly and suicidally committed to any technique. * * *</page><page sequence="10">62 John Rothfork Seeking the "Master Plan," the cybernetic Logos, to explain his world, the narrator discovers that "everyone wears portable decoders" (p. 36) to analyze every word for hidden meanings. For words in a cybernetic system have only arbitrary and temporary references to each other. Like following the endless words in Borges' "Library of Babel," the narrator walks "alone down endless corridors, corridors that continually branched out and converged, corridors with dazzling walls and rows of white gleaming doors" (p. 37). Rest comes only in a marble bathtub, "like a sarcophagus." But this is not a sleep that renews. For in the myth of technique, sleep can only be "down-time." And if the water in the tub continues to suggest life, the tub is itself like the state: cold, efficient, blank as porcelain. The water may ritually cleanse, but here the towels "are embroidered with staring eyes" (p. 38). After a bathtub rest, the narrator enters a guarded door and, as in the mythology of Kundalini yoga, ascends the "spiral staircase" of the spine, finding himself on the "threshold of a dark chapel." Consistent with the pyramid tomb, and the ego it represents, the chapel remains dark; there is no enlightenment or transcendence. There is a funeral instead of birth : "inside, under a crucifix lay an open coffin" containing the body of a general whom the narrator hoped would brief him on his Mission (p. 39). In despair, the narrator begs to confess to a monk: "permit me to report" (p. 41). The interchanging of military and religious language and offices indicates a mutual collapse of each paradigm into the other. The reader sees the futility of following the "usual business" within this jury-rigged paradigm. He sees that the structure is beyond repair and should be abandoned. However, to those at home in the paradigm—including the narrator—condemning the old paradigm, regardless of its failings, is considered irrational. Moreover, as Kuhn says, one can reject a paradigm only from the perspective offered by another paradigm (pp. 77-79); and in the pyramid1 there is only one monolithic paradigm. The technique learned by paradigm acquisition defines logic for the community sharing the paradigm. Hence, those inside the system can see those outside the system only as barbaric, primitive and irrational. In a cybernetic psychology there is no exit, for nothing is acknowledged to exist outside the system. Transcendence is considered annihilation. Thus in the Kundalini scene, when there should be enlightenment and rebirth, there is only a corpse. In contrast, organic psychologies and theologies not only recognize transcendence of logical technique, but normatively define it as liberation or enlightenment. And, despite the collapse of religion into secular politics—which is as unavoidable in Marxist theory as it is evident in capitalistic technique—Lem implies the corrective vision of organic psychologies, such as those of Viktor Frankl or Erich Fromm, which in turn rely on Jung and Freud. It is from this inclusive paradigm, within which these and other organic psychologies exist, that Lem is able to reject the currently popular cybernetic psychology, which, to quote one of its leading researchers, considers man to be a "meat machine."27</page><page sequence="11">Lern 's Critique of Cybernetics 63 Because in Memoirs we are already inside a cybernetic world of data, Lem can allude only to experience recognized or formulated by organic psychology and theology. In any case, Frankl, speaking for the humanistic and religious traditions of the West—as well as for Asia—holds that "human existence is basically unreflectable."28 Appropriately, Lem has a priest state the mystical position: "we are as unfathomable, as inscrutable as That which brought us into being, and we choke on our own enigma" (p. 46). However, the narrator, personifying the Western Platonic and scientific tradition, cannot accept this because he still professes the cybernetic paradigm. Thus he says: "again and again I was given to understand that nothing, really, was expected of me. And that was the only thing I couldn't accept, because it didn't make sense" (p. 109). Nonetheless, the narrator does begin to recognize the epistemic process and the difference between a model and what it hopes to interpret. Referring to the Master Plan or the Logos, he reflects: "just imagine, what if there were more than one plan? Not two, nor four—a thousand! Ten thousand! A million!" (p. 30). He begins to discern that a paradigm, such as the church state Building, is one of a number of possible renderings of life experience which cannot be exhausted nor entirely articulated by the interpretative model: "however far from it our theorizing may soar, it must take off from and return here," to life and the unconscious (Barrett, p. 146). Although the clergy are expert decoders, using "bugged percolators," "polygraph mittens," and "microphone pillows," they have not succeeded in finding the key to crack the Bible code, nor the code of existence. In the cybernetic myth, God, or "The Cosmic Command, obviously no longer able to supervise every assignment on an individual basis when there are literally trillions of matters in its charge, has switched over to a random system!" (p. 54). Opening a tabernacle-safe, the narrator finds only an empty folder. Finally realizing that technique endlessly leads nowhere, the narrator turns to the human scale, the human world, characterized by human relation ships such as trust. If the tomb-tabernacle is empty, it may be because life has transcended its boundaries. Thus, Dietrich Bonhoeffer called us out of the churches and into a life of discipleship, which he said "is void of all content."29 This, like all mysticism, is a normative interpretation of Descartes, a recognition that the process of life is more fundamental than anything that occurs in it. Opposed to this mysticism, Major Erms, a military father figure whose name ominously recalls the gallery of hands, offers the narrator a kind of esthetics of cybernetic technique which appreciates that "everything is a code." The activity of consciousness invests sensations with meaning by placing them in a syntax or a disciplinary matrix. The problem, or the fun depending on the situation or intention of the person—is that the same sensa tions can be placed in any number of models to create entirely different fields or patterns of meaning. Music illustrates how this process works with the uninterpretable data of sound. When conceptual symbols, such as language,</page><page sequence="12">64 John Rothfork are used, the focus shifts from pattern recognition to internal interpretation, that is, technique. The Major's solution to this tension is to appreciate that "the whole purpose of a code" is to conceal information (p. 60). The Major suggests that the ultimate concealment is one's self. One is a DNA code, a cybernetic code, a temporal code, and other codes that ultimately cannot be "cracked" because one is inside them; one is the result of techniques. More over, Major Erms says, "a cracked code remains a code. An expert can peel away layer after layer. It's inexhaustible. One digs ever deeper into more and more inaccessible strata. That journey has no end" (p. 65). The narrator reflects, "The Department of Investigation? Once there, you never leave" (p. 72). In The Cyberiad Lem observes that consciousness forms "a deadly trap, in that one could enter it, but never leave."30 This is the flat horizon of cybernetic vision, which is entailed in its reductive belief that there is no transcendence, nor even other valid paradigmatic views. Whether one thinks of Providence or natural selection or class struggle, Major Erms explains, "instructions have to be in code," so that although one never understands one's Mission, it is at every moment being implemented (p. 54). At this moment, when the paradox should cause a gestalt shift to recognize deep structures, such as the creative unconscious, the narrator remains confined in the only paradigm he knows. Since the narrator is the product of cybernetic psychology, which recognizes nothing beyond the conscious mind and technique, there is no transcendence, only despair. Thus he says, "/ was beginning to doubt the very existence of the instructions themselves" (p. 58). Frankl writes that "in our century, a deified reason and a mégalomanie technology are the repressive structures to which the religious feeling is sacrificed" (p. 70). So even if the narrator were analogous to a person, and consequently embedded in nature and the unconscious, the technological paradigm he professes would repress this recognition, calling it primitive and irrational; for such recognition threatens to expose the shallow pool of conscious thought. When something like this self-disclosure threatens, the narrator flees into a bathroom, which has not only the Freudian significance of "coming clean," and renewal, but also symbolizes the world of technology. For in the bathroom "everything gleamed...with the dazzling cleanliness of an operating room" (p. 68). The surgical metaphor reminds us not only of the severed hands but also of the surgical operation of gazing into the mirror to see who we are before putting on a face for the world. The bathroom also has significance in the light of cybernetics. For in denying the realms above and below what is programmable, the transcendental and the unconscious, the bathroom is the only temple left. If there is nothing but man, his name must be Narcissus. Considering suicide, the narrator resolves to continue looking for answers. He goes to the library and there in the "murky labyrinth" of books, he comes upon this definition: "ORIGINAL SIN—the division of the world into Information and Misinformation" (p. 75). There is no way to judge which is</page><page sequence="13">Lern 's Critique of Cybernetics 65 which from inside a cybernetic system. However, from a Christian view, the entire cybernetic paradigm is imbued in original sin. As Reinhold Neibuhr puts it: "Reason which seeks to bring all things into terms of rational coherence is tempted to make one known thing the principle of explanation and to derive all other things from it. Its most natural inclination is to make itself that ultimate principle, and thus in effect to declare itself God."31 Or from the Eastern view : "finally and fundamentally, it is not that the ego has a problem, but that the ego is the problem" (Fromm, p. 154). Memoirs shows us the world reduced to mere rationalism, a world extrapolated from cybernetic psychology; ironically it is a nightmare. This parallels Polanyi's thesis of how the Enlightenment, and its mechanistic vision, led to such nightmares of the twentieth century as Nazism and Stalinism. He asserts that "it was not technology that produced the totalitarian ideologies which brought the disasters of the twentieth century into being, along with the feeling of absurdity and the contempt for human society that are current today. We may thank the scientific image of the world, as reflected in the modern mind, for these (Meaning, p. 105; and "The Eclipse of Thought," pp. 3-21). ♦ ♦ * Hoping for an authenticating relationship, the narrator finds the priest distant because of his professional technique. He finds Major Erms too Japanese, too esthetic, and thus also cold. Back in the bathroom refuge, the narrator meets a psychoanalyst-spy who seems more approachable. Because the analyst is also in the bathroom, he does not seem to have an office in the bureaucracy, but to be another pilgrim like the narrator. The analyst rejects the cybernetic view, professing love as the Logos. The narrator's cautious cynicism—the patron saint here is "Peter Renouncing Christ" (p. 144)—moves the plot to a distinctly Christian crisis in which the analyst sacrifices his own life to prove that love can break the code, liberating man from programming and the ideology which makes him a robot, a slave to technique. Before the narrator can accept this Christian paradigm, he must break out of the cybernetic paradigm which, in fact, he never does. His faith in the cybernetic paradigm seems to be exhausted in a scene reminiscent of Kafka. The narrator is ready to "confess to everything and anything" (p. 109), if only someone is there to listen. But in the cybernetic paradigm, as illustrated by Joseph Weizenbaum's famous psychotherapeutic program, ELIZA, there are no persons.32 As in Marxism, technique creates consciousness and values. Trust, judgment, creative insight, love, conscience—all of these are epiphenomenal, superstitions. Seeing himself in this light, the narrator admits: "all along I was nothing, just one of a series, another copy, a stereotype... repeating like a record player exactly the same words, feelings, thoughts. My melodramatic actions, the sudden impulses, false starts, surprises, moments of inspiration, each successive revelation—all of it, chapter and</page><page sequence="14">66 John Rothfork verse, including this present moment, was in the instructions—no longer my instructions, they weren't made for me" (p. 124). This reflects Kant's contribu tion to the cybernetic vision. Defining Kant's Transcendental Reason, F.S.C. Northrop says: "Since the a priori concepts are the same for everybody and are formal, it is really not the varied, differing persons who are the knowing egos, but instead a single or what might be termed 'public ego.'"33 The cybernetic vision is complete when this faith in absolute reason is linked with a faith in atomic facts as the building blocks of life: thus "the computer serves as a model of the mind as conceived of by empiricists such as Hume (with the bits as atomic impressions) and idealists such as Kant (with the program providing the rules)" (Dreyfus, p. 156). Basing his argument on internal inconsistencies within the paradigm of cybernetic psychology, instead of using competing paradigms, as Lem does with Christian love, Dreyfus suggests that cybernetics has driven the Western epistemology of Plato and Descartes to a crisis: "the moment has come either to face the truth of the tradition's deepest intuition or to abandon the mechanical account of man's nature which has been gradually developing over the past two thousand years" (p. 79). The crisis Dreyfus perceives is exactly the crisis that Lem uses his fiction to warn us of: "If the computer paradigm becomes so strong that people being to think of themselves as digital devices...then, since for the reasons we have been rehearsing [ reviewed in this paper as well ], machines cannot be like human beings, human beings may become progressively like machines."34 Thus the narrator admits: "I found I couldn't even think, someone was doing it for me" (p. 151). Having recognized the paradigm of technique, the narrator is seemingly liberated from it, to turn to the person, to dialogue, trust and love. But liberation must go deeper than conceptual recognition; and a final liberation is not merely a shift to another paradigm, a reincarnation. Thus a professor, explaining that to ask about meaning is already to enter the corridors of technique, says liberation is "quite simple, really, the taking away of meaning." We must, like Hindu mystics or Zen monks, "methodically, with the utmost care...deprive everything, absolutely everything, of its meaning." As a Westerner, conditioned by Hume and Kant and the cybernetic vision, the narrator sees this as only "a kind of destruction" (p. 149). From the perspective of the East, Shiva—the god of both destruction and meditation liberates us from all technique and meaning, delivering us to our true origin and end, undifferentiated consciousness. The Upanishads tell us that, "It is that from which" we "came forth, as that into which" we "will be dissolved"; and it is that "wherefrom words turn back."35 Since the narrator is trapped inside the Pentagon-pyramid in Cheyenne Mountain, he cannot ascend the mountain; nor does he transcend the psychology of John Locke and B. F. Skinner. However, he does discover that truth is always model-relative and cannot exist apart from the technique {karma) which locates or manifests it. He discovers that the process of de-mythification simply provides a new, and again unrecognized, myth.</page><page sequence="15">Lern 's Critique of Cybernetics 67 Weizenbaum attempts to make this clear to those involved in computer science, but because he has stepped outside the cybernetic vision he will be considered only a primitive or lunatic. The narrator learns that since there are multiple and competing paradigms, there will always be ambiguity and indeterminacy. Moreover, a professor tells him that meanings grow "obsolete in time," and are "eventually lost, yet how" can "the following gener ations discard their heritage?" (p. 149). They cannot, and so the rituals become codes. Life becomes technique. Finally, the narrator perceives the awful skepticism inherent in cybernetic psychology. Like a cybernetic-age Ivan Karamazov, a priest argues for nihilism: "The thought that your suffering might be incidental and not intentional, that no one takes an interest in it, not even a sadistic interest, for the simple reason that it concerns not a soul but yourself—surely that's an unbearable thought." So one invents God and "Mystery offers a way out, a way out of all monstrous absurdities. With Mystery, one can at least hope" (p. 168). But the skeptic leaves no hope: "take a million pieces of gravel like this, a trillion, and an atmosphere will form around them, the wind will blow over them, and cosmic rays will bombard them—until from out a pile of debris there will crawl forth some thing we call—Sacred.... And who gave the order? It is exactly the same with the Building..." (p. 170). We are so used to these reductive physical science arguments, which deny the very teleology they use, that we rarely oppose them. Epistemologists, beginning with Locke, broke human experience into atomic bits and then decided that the bits were more fundamental than the whole. They supposed the bits built up the whole, but all they did was dissect the whole into bits. Whether or not these bits randomly coalesce into a whole, such as Lem's skeptic argues, is far from proved. Moreover, as Dreyfus and Barrett remind us, "we do not directly perceive the world of atoms and electromagnetic waves" (Dreyfus, p. 268). We inhabit a world of human situations; and the interpretation of this experience—which is not a model but life itself— through specialized paradigms, is not primal, but highly abstract and formal. Consequently, it is an inversion, caused by the pervasive ideology of tech nique, to assume that the special vision seen through the lens of the paradigm is more fundamental than what we see with our eyes. Having destroyed the narrator's faith in the pyramid, the priest offers love: "Wisdom is you, yourself—or maybe two people!" It is treasonous against technique. But if he is to be man, he must deny an ultimacy to things and recognize his own creative unconscious (Atman) as the ground or field in which all things exist. For as Troy Wilson Organ observes: "Man is the point at which the cosmos ceases to pluralize and starts the return to Oneness."36 A more fundamental process than the calculation of the "ego," it requires another person to experience trust, friendship, love. And if these become central in a life, to the depth represented by Christ, then technique is powerless, because it will be seen to deal with inconsequential "data." This is the position advocated by Christian philosophers of technology. Thus</page><page sequence="16">68 John Rothfork Ellul says, man "can inquire after the values to impose on techniques in his use of them, and search out the way to follow in order to remain a man in the fullest sense of the word within a technological society. All this is ex tremely difficult, but it is far from being useless, since it is apparently the only solution presently possible."37 Like Melville, the-priest says: "anything genuine will weigh you down, drag you to the bottom for good" (p. 171). To forestall this enlightenment, the Bureaucracy encourages spying, complex technique and oppression. The priest proposes the ultimate conspiracy, unconditional mutual com mitment, love, between himself and the narrator. Since the plot is a night mare taking place within the Freudian subconscious, this love cannot grow from libido to agapé. Instead there is adolescent crisis, manifest in such dream images as: elevators going up and down, noise in the bathroom pipes, and the mechanical fingers and severed hands. There can be no dialogue with nature, nor sublimation through culture. The only woman in the book is encountered in a nightmare rape scene. It is a forced and calculated attempt of a juvenile to create an image for himself: "I Was a Bastard, proud but a little bashful" (p. 181). It culminates in revulsion: "Passion!! Lust!! I swooped down—something was wrong—her mouth was full—white—a whiff of—of—what? Cheese! Cream cheese!!" (p. 183). Love between the narrator and priest is even more impossible, because, to be anything more than juvenile homosexuality, it would have to be ab stracted from more comprehensive and mature experiences of love. Self infatuated—the condition of original sin—the narrator refuses the risk in volved with trusting and loving either man or God. He imagines, "cross and double-cross," maybe "a Grand Inquisitor," nails, thorns and "a spear in the side" (p. 180). In despair he chooses suicide by leaving the only reality he knows, the mountain-womb. But before he goes, he visits the bathroom to tell the analyst his decision. There he discovers the analyst's corpse. Initially this, like the Kundalini scene, implies that there can be no transcendence, no birth. Still conditioned by his life-long cybernetic epistemology, the narrator looks for a message to explain this event. But there is no note, "only a naked body, as if to say by the very nakedness of death that not everything was false, that there was in the final analysis, something that no amount of subter fuge could ever alter." But the answer is not death, it is love. For by his death, the analyst indicated that life itself is the only answer to life's questions. And the narrator perceives that, like Christ, the analyst "died, then, for my sake" as "the only way to convince me that he hadn't lied" (p. 187). He died to give life, and trust in life, to the narrator. Consistent with the boundaries of the fictional world, and more than a little indicative of our closed-minded commitment to the cybernetic vision, Lem cannot allow the narrator an escape. The narrator prefers the profound facticity of death to the ambiguity of life. He remains in the mountain-tomb, an aborted life. # * ♦</page><page sequence="17">Lern 's Critique of Cybernetics 69 The historian who introduces Memoirs tells us that two skeletons were found in the bathtub, along with the book, suggesting a parody of a lover's suicide pact. In rejecting Christ, in rejecting love, the world came to an end. By closing the novel with this image, Lem leaves us in ambiguity. The image suggests, as we have known since Dostoevsky and Nietzsche, that the modern world is post-Christian and secular. However, Lem's illustration of the cyber netic world-view as nightmare can be read only as criticism of it. This is supported by rereading the introduction in which the historian remarks on computers of our age : "They were called 'electronic brains,' an exaggeration comprehensible only in the historical perspective, much like the boast of the builders of Asia Minor, that their sacred temple Baa-Bel was 'sky reaching'" (p. 1). This may be interpreted as condescendence from the height of a superior technology. However, we assume that man did reject the cyber netic paradigm because of the dramatic situation in which the historian writes of a lost civilization. Where does this leave Lem? It does not leave him, as many critics think and as Lem himself often proclaims, an advocate of cybernetic reduction ism. Quite the reverse; dramatizing its flaws, Lem is not inside the paradigm, but immediately outside looking in. Is this not similar to Luther's position: outside the monastery, and thus able to see its limits? At one point in Memoirs, the narrator visits a hermitage which seems like a dream within a dream. It is "cluttered with all sorts of junk—dirty sacks, onion skins, empty jars, sausage rings, ashes and old papers." The images are mostly of empty containers. In the cell, "there was shuffling, whispering," and "shadowy figures" that "scurry about, crouch in the corners, scuttle under crooked tables or cots"; instead of wisdom or prayer, "there were angry whispers and grunts in the darkness" (p. 45). In images and associa tions like these—and religious images are manifold in Lem's work—Lem ill ustrates the pathetic position of man today : looking for the God he denies in the cybernetic maze of his own making. Christianity, especially in its Protestant principle of denying the absolute in any relative system, is certainly capable of resisting the cybernetic vision. Indeed, Jacques Ellul, Egbert Schuurman, Hans Kung, and many other Christian writers have joined the battle. Frederick Ferre's book, Shaping the Future, is one of the few positive attempts to write a theology—still only notes—cognizant of the work of Polanyi, Kuhn and cybernetics.38 Typically, Ferre advocates process theology, which has not clearly demon strated that it can resist collapse into the cybernetic vision. It simply asks for faith that process is not random and circular, but moving to some escha tology. Bonhoeffer, and the so-called "death of God" theologians, offers an even less promising scheme of retaining the Christian myth in abstract: a discipleship, as Bonhoeffer said, "void of all content." It is difficult to see how either system can avoid invoking mysticism to escape skepticism. In a study of Mortal Engines, another of Lem's dramatic speculations on cybernetics, I suggested that Lem refers to Buddhist psychology as an</page><page sequence="18">70 John Rothfork alternative to cybernetic psychology.39 Buddhism is especially attractive because it shares more of the cybernetic view than Western systems, most notably exoteric Christianity which defends the primacy of the self. Although Lem is himself too much at home in Western philosophy, religion and science, to delve very deeply into Eastern thought, he does suggest—if in no other way than by demonstrating the cul-de-sac of Western scientism—that we need mysticism to restore mental health and avoid the fanaticism which has claimed a hundred million murder victims in the twentieth century. In this sense, Stanislaw Lem's work may come to be seen as part of the wisdom of the negative way which unplugs the computer by causing man to laugh at himself and his games, and to love more deeply than he calculates.
