<plain_text><page sequence="1">SHORT NOTES A NOTE ON ISAIAH xlix 16-17 Hebrew is a language that lends itself easily to paronomasia 1). Normally the play on words lies between what one might term a psychological association of ideas 2), very rarely was it truly etymo- logical, or between similar sounding but distinct roots in proximate contexts 3). Occasionally, however, a double entendre can be detected within the same word, as in Isa. li 9, where Rahab apparently refers both to the mythical monster of chaos and to the historical Egypt 4), i.e. both to Creation and the Exodus deliverance. It is suggested that in Isa. xlix 16-17 a whole series of such two-dimensional words can be discerned, and that the verses are in fact a veritable poetic tour de force. In Gen. xvi 2 and xxx 3, similar language is used of Sarai 5) and Rachel who are both barren and anxious to have children, and the crucial verb in both texts is bdndh, in the Nip al form meaning 'to be built' and translated in the EVV 'to obtain children', (Heb. bdnim sons, children). The similarity of sound would suggest the double entendre, but a more profound dimension is doubtless to be found in the fusion of the idea of a city whose structure is built of stones (Heb. 'abdnim) and that of a woman whose psychical integration is built by her children. It is not insignificant that Jerusalem, the city par excellence, should so frequently be depicted as a woman in the prophetic literature, and it is to the investigation of this literary figure in the Isaianic context that we now turn. In v. 16, to understand homo_t in the literal, prosaic sense of 'walls' is to introduce a touch of bathos after "Behold, I have graven you on the palms of my hands" (RSV). There is a parallel for the latter idea in Canticles viii 6, and it is suggested that the former idea of a wall as a figure for the outward appearance of a woman is more dis- 1) See A.

This literary device is apposite for expressing the idea of imposing beauty and that of guardianship of the seed of life and hope for the future. In short, not only is the name of the beloved graven upon the palms of Yahweh, but her image is indelibly branded upon his mind. The text continues, it is suggested, in v. 17 with a development of this theme, and Zion once thrown aside (Heb. hdras) deprived of her children and made barren (Heb. hireb) 1), is rescued by her true lover who restores her exiled children. It is interesting to note that whereas in v. 18 it is her bdnimv who are Zion's jewels 2), in liv. 11 f., it is Zion's 'abanm which express her beauty, but again bdnim is in close attendance in v. 13. To the objection that to retain the MT in xlix 17, is to make the verse 'metrically hopeless' 3), one might counter by pointing out that we hardly know enough about Hebrew metre to be able to set it up as a norm, and make the sense subordinate to it. 'Your builders', the suggested emendation 4), understood in its prosaic sense, is clearly an awkward insertion. The sons are also the builders 5) and the stones 6), but they are living stones and the builders of the people of God into an integrated, vital and purposeful community. The anthropomorphism in these verses is admittedly intense, but not more so than in other passages in the prophecy, e.g. xlii 13, 14. Language which was erotic in its original Sitz im Leben has been masterfully correlated with the prophet's religious and eschatological perspective which clearly bears the imprint of the old promise of progeny. With superb poetic artistry he has compressed a host of ideas in an economy of carefully selected words. The conceptual background not only serves to illuminate those ideas, but also elucida- tes the undoubted links between the vox populi and the vox Dei in Hebrew literature.
