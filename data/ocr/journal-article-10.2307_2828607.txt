<plain_text><page sequence="1">FOREST ENTOMOLOGY: ECOLOGY AND MANAGE- MENT. A Wiley-Interscience Publication. By Robert N. Coulson and John A. Witter. John Wiley &amp; Sons, New York. $37.50. xi + 669 p.; ill.; subject and species indexes. 1984. As noted by the authors, forest entomology draws on several different academic specialties, includ- ing entomology, forestry, and ecology, and insects play diverse roles in different forest situations, such as forest ecosystems, urban forests, nurser- ies, and seed orchards. To develop a book inclu- sive of these areas in an ambititious task. To do it well, as the authors have, is largely a result of their talent for presenting biological and ecologi- cal principles and concepts concisely, clearly, and in a style that makes them interesting rather than pedantic. There is liberal usage of figures, and line drawings (many redrawn and/or modified from other works) are clear, uncluttered, and descrip- tive. This well-edited book is divided into three sec- tions. The first, General Entomology, includes chapters on introduction to insects, structure and function, classification, and a short chapter on damage and insect signs to facilitate indentifica- tion of insects or groups of insects. One could ar- gue for the value of students taking an introduc- tory course in entomology but this is not always possible. General entomology sometimes is cov- ered in the first several weeks of a course on forest entomology, and in this book students will be ex- posed to an excellent synthesis of general aspects of the field. For the more serious students, this sec- tion, like those that follow, includes many refer- ences in the text, often with a sentence or two indi- cating what the reader will find therein. The second section, Principles and Techniques of Insect Pest Management, includes chapters on concepts of integrated pest management (IPM), population dynamics of insects and of forest trees in relation to phytophagous insects, principles of population modification and regulation using ar- tificial and natural agents, impact (damage) as- sessment, and monitoring of pest populations in forest stands. This section was particularly satisfy- ing to me, for the authors approach destructive in- sects with an appreciation of their biology and ecology yet with the realization that where dam- age occurs, management strategies are often re- quired. One does not feel that pest species are ad- versaries that need to be exterminated. Readers should glean the authors' sensitivity for the ecolog- ical role that insects play in forests (and the role that forest insects have played in advancing eco- logical concepts and theories). The term "pest" is an anthropomorphic concept, and there are strategies to manage rather than "control" pest populations. IPM strategies are based on sound ecological and economic princi- ples and are sensitive to societal needs. The chap- ter on population modification and regulation using artificial and natural agents presents a wide variety of management strategies, including chemical insecticides, semiochemicals (e.g., sex pheromones), biological control agents, habitat modification, silvicultural practices, and others. The authors diverge from a common approach of treating only the insects and neglecting the re- source that they utilize. The chapter on popula- tion dynamics of forest trees presents a well con- ceived treatise on the resource, including forest dynamics, tree-insect interactions, plant defense mechanisms, and effects of insects in forests. Throughout this chapter, as with other chapters in this section, the authors demonstrate their knowl- edge of, and appreciation for, the utility of a sys- tems science approach to problem solving. The last section, Insect Feeding Groups, is pri- marily descriptive of major insects (and mites) that attack trees, and includes chapters on defolia- tors; sapsucking insects and mites; terminal shoot, twig, and root feeders; seed and cone feeders;</page><page sequence="2">386 THE QUARTERLY REVIEW OF BIOLOGY [VOLUME 60 phloem, wood boring, and gall making insects; and arthropod pests in recreational areas. The sec- tion is illustrated with black-and-white photo- graphs of insects and in some cases, their damage. Although color photographs would have better served this purpose, other reference material is available with color photographs, including Insects That Feed on Trees and Shrtibs, An Illustrated Practical Guide by W. T. Johnson and H. H. Lyon (Com- stock Publishing Associates, Cornell University Press, Ithaca and London) which was published in 1976, and the excellent Canadian series on insects of Easterp forests authored by A. H. Rose and D. H. Lindquist and published by the Department of Environment, Canadian Forestry Service. The authors have presented a scholarly treatise that will provide students and workers in the field of forest entomology with means to identify insect problems and management alternatives, an appre- ciation for biological and ecological paratneters, and systems science approaches to solving prob- lems relating to an important and valuable re- source.
