<plain_text><page sequence="1">SCEPTICISM. By KAI NIELSEN. New York, St. Martin's Press, I973. Pp. x, II8. $5-95- THE LOGICAL STATUS OF "GOD." By MICHAEL DURRANT. New York, St. Martin's Press, I973. Pp. xiv, II7. $5.95. The authors of these two volumes in the series New Studies in the Philosophy of Religion are agreed that the concept of God is con- ceptually defective and that theological sentences are unintelligible or incoherent. There is a seeming paradox in the fact that Nielsen, an "atheist," should claim such sentences to be unintelligible, since the standard atheistic view asserts the falsity of theological claims and thereby presupposes their intelligibility, and in the fact that Durrant, who strugglesr] on in the context of the Church," should find theo- logical propositions to be incoherent, since so to struggle involves a faith, or at least a hope, which one can clearly not rationally have with respect to that which one believes to be incoherent. (Both Nielsen and Durrant argue forcefully against form of life/language game accounts as complete statements of the uses of religious language, Durrant trying to show the primacy of the statement-making function of such language. On his own account as well as on Nielsen's "struggling within the Church" cannot mean, for example, merely having certain attitudes or images; it means at least holding, or perhaps wishing to hold, certain beliefs. Nielsen, incidentally, argues effectively against the view that since a given assertion is to be judged on the basis of criteria of ration- ality internal to the language game within which the assertion is made, religious talk is exempt from external criticism. Nielsen's argument is based on the claim that certain standards of rationality for example, logical consistency-transcend language games. He might well have raised the question: Within what language game is the claim of the relativity of rationality to language game itself made ?) While Durrant does not face up to the paradox inherent in his position, Nielsen seems to circumvent the corresponding paradox in his only by introducing a very peculiar definition of "atheism." And 590</page><page sequence="2">BOOK REVIEWS this definition infects his definition of "scepticism"-by which he means religious skepticism. According to Nielsen's usage, a "sceptic" is either an atheist or an agnostic (pp. 4 f.). But on Nielsen's unusually in- clusive notion of atheism, an atheist is not just one who holds that belief in God is false, or probably false, but also one who "believes that the concept of God is so incoherent or problematical that one cannot intelligibly . . . assert that it is either true or false that there is such a reality" (p. 4) (such a reality as what?, one wonders) /or one who holds that "God" stands for a "purely secular reality" (ibid.). (As actually stated, this last proviso, like the others, stands as a reason for the atheist to reject a belief in God, but it can hardly be Nielsen's intention to define an "atheist" as one who rejects belief in that secular reality which he calls "God.") Of his definition of an "agnostic" (ibid.), I shall only remark that contrary to Nielsen's expressed intention, it does not appear to rule out the possibility of an agnostic's being a fideist. The oddity of Nielsen's definition of skepticismm" is derivative from the oddity of his definition of "atheist": in standard use "scepti- cism" involves reference to doubt, and doubt precludes unintelligi- bility. "I don't understand what you're saying, but I doubt it" can at best be a way of accusing a speaker of being a congenital liar. To be sure, one can redefine terms as one likes, but if one plays that game, then he ought not to complain if others do, too, as Nielsen does, for example, in complaining about a stipulative redefinition of "belief in God" which is such as to make an "atheist" like Nielsen into a "believer" (compare pp. I 7 and 30 f.) . Leaving such definitional matters aside, let us look at Nielsen's argument for the unintelligibility of God-talk, when God is construed non-anthropomorphically, or as not being "Zeus-like." According to Nielsen such a non-anthropomorphic conception of God is shared by sophisticated Christians, Jews, and Moslems. Claims involving a vulgar, anthropomorphic conception of God, he avers, are intelligible, but readily falsifiable. Nielsen's argument for the unintelligibility of sophisticated God-talk first appears on page 8, but is repeated several times; it is that such talk "makes putative truth-claims which are neither verifiable nor falsifiable even in principle, and, hence, are in reality not genuine truth-claims." The immediately preceding remarks show that this claim is based not on a positivist "meaning criterion" but on a simple failure to distinguish between truth and knowledge: "Religious claims purport to be true, but truth requires evidence or grounds; that is, we can never know a claim to be true unless we have evidence or grounds for that claim." 59 I</page><page sequence="3">BOOK REVIEWS Nielsen's over-all argument-and in restricting my discussion to it I fail to indicate many valuable aspects of the book-can be criticized on a number of grounds other than the confusion of truth and knowledge which underlies it. This confusion affects only the transition from untestability to unintelligibility, but Nielsen has shown neither the complete untestability of all non-anthropomorphic God-claims, nor the ready falsifiability of all anthropomorphic ones. On the latter point, since Nielsen gives us not a clue as to what he takes the falsifi- cation of such claims to consist in, I shall remark only (a) that his account of "anthropomorphism" is insufficiently clear to rule out some highly sophisticated (and difficult to falsify) kinds of God-talk, and (b) that, in any event, Duhem-Quine types of consideration show the difficulty of falsifying single statements, even ones involving rather naively anthropomorphic conceptions of God. On the former point, the unclarity of Nielsen's use of "anthropomorphism" is one source of doubt concerning the alleged untestability of non-anthropomorphic God-claims. One thing that is clear is that to consider God perceivable involves anthropomorphism, but the importance of theoretical enti- ties for scientific explanation demonstrates that imperceptibility is not a sufficient condition of untestability. Surely one can imagine events in different universes which differentially evidence the existence of an imperceptible but, say, benevolent and omnipotent Being. To be sure, one can extend the notion of non-anthropomorphism far beyond imperceptibility to complete transcendence. By a completely transcendent being I mean one which not only is outside the empirical realm but which can have no effect on it. Now the existence of a completely transcendent God-or, for that matter, of a completely transcendent anything-would be completely untestable but, so far as I know, is not the object of anyone's concern. Such a being would be the epitome of the unknowable-and of the uninteresting. If I may be forgiven for so putting the point, few believers would give a damn about a "God" who-in principle-cannot. But if God's transcen- dence-as is usually believed-is less than complete, so that He does have some effects in the experiential realm, then it is hard to imagine an argument, except one which is applicable to any theoretical claim, which demonstrates the untestability of God-claims. Finally, even if such claims were untestable, this would show only that they could not be known to be true or false, not that they could not have a truth value. To be sure, we could claim that untestability entails unintelligibility but (a) such a claim appears question- begging, (b) that all untestable sentences have the same (null) meaning 592</page><page sequence="4">BOOK REVIEWS is highly counterintuitive, and (c) acceptance of such a claim leaves us deep in the (Vienna) woods, as presupposing a version of the posi- tivist meaning criterion, with all its familiar difficulties. To mention just one: the entailment claim itself is incoherent, as embodying a category mistake; that which is (un)intelligible-namely, a set of ink-marks or sounds-is not the sort of thing which can be (un)verifiable; it is only a (meaningful) assertion or belief which can. But only nostalgia buffs will want to pursue problems of the verifiability theory. The central contention of Durrant's book is that as the term "God" is used in "Christian writing" (which appears to include the Old Testament), in sentences of the form "God is F," it has no one status, since there are features of its use which rule out its being a proper name, other features which rule out its being a definite description (of either of two forms), and still other features which present difficulties for its appearing as a logical subject either as a Geachian substantival general term or as an abstract term. The main interest of the book lies in the details of some of its subsidiary arguments with which, unfor- tunately, I have little room to deal. Two obvious kinds of questioning suggest themselves concerning the main line of argument: first, how adequate are Durrant's arguments for the subordinate claims (that, for example, "God" cannot function as a proper name) and, second, even if these claims are established why should this fact trouble a Christian believer? Taking the latter point first, even if we grant, say, that the function of a definite description is so different from that of a proper name that a term's having one use is incompatible with its having the other, still it is very hard to see why one should be worried about the fact that an expression has one function in one context and a different one in another. Durrant's objection to taking "God" as having different functions -namely, "that to do so however would be indirectly to accuse Christianity of employing its central word in radically different ways, for no word can genuinely be both a proper name and a description (general term)" (p. 4) seems strangely to ignore the consideration of context of use: surely, there is no incompatibility involved merely in the fact that the same word has different functions in different contexts. If it be said that this misses Durrant's point, which is that a term that can be used in one way (say, as a proper name) in one context cannot be used in an "incompatible" way (for example, as a descrip- tion) in any other, then the response must be that Durrant does not take sufficiently into account the flexibility of a natural language like 593</page><page sequence="5">BOOK REVIEWS English, a suggestion which I should make anyway on other grounds. This flexibility permits the use of proper names where we might expect-under strict rules-other sorts of expression. Some obvious examples which parallel some of Durrant's problematic uses of "God" are: "Thank God there can't be two Richard Nixons," "So you're the great Jack Armstrong," and "The United States I knew as a child is no more." Of course, I don't want to suggest that there are no incompatible uses of "God" within "Christian writing": given the vast body of data and the multiplicity of its creators' beliefs about and even conceptions of God, the probability of a totally consistent use of "God" is vanishingly small. But, surely, this fact is no cause for worry, although it may be suggestive of the remedy for many incompati- bilities Durrant finds in the uses of "God"-namely, making a selection from among compatible uses which best expresses his conception (rather than a "construction" [p. io8] which attempts somehow to be all-encompassing). Since I can deal only sketchily with the question of the cogency of Durrant's subsidiary arguments, I shall restrict my comments to a consideration of his claim that "God" cannot be a proper name. This claim is of special interest since, I submit, God has been conceived not only by Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, but also by Tom, Dick, and Harry (and for the meaning of a common term, this is of some importance) as a person-like being. And God's being a person, or person-like, is suffi- cient for "God" to be a proper name (see pp. 7 if.). To be sure, the doctrine of the Trinity presents difficulties for this conception, diffi- culties which Durrant fully exploits, but until that doctrine is clarified and shown to be logically coherent, we should not-from a logical standpoint-be overly concerned about the difficulties it raises. (Compare Durrant's own treatment of the claim that God is being itself, p. 46.) In any event, even if God is not a person but a totally mysterious "substance" in which three persons inhere (p. i I), it is not clear that "God" cannot be said to be the proper name of that substance, unless we arbitrarily restrict the notion of naming, as, I suggest, Durrant does. Borrowing from Geach and Strawson, he tells us that our correctly using a proper name entails (i) that we can specify the kind of thing the bearer of the name is, and (2) that we can-in principle-identify this bearer. And, Durrant claims, "God" satisfies neither of these requirements. Now unless "proper name" is -uninterestingly-being redefined, one may wonder why these requirements should be accepted here: the works of Geach and Strawson are not Holy Writ, nor are the requirements by any means 594</page><page sequence="6">BOOK REVIEWS self-evident. Even if we accept the first requirement, moreover, "God" fails to satisfy it only if we further accept a fixed universal hierarchical schema of classification-a rather extreme case of the philosophical disease which A. I. Melden calls "hardening of the categories." If, further, "kind of thing" is so restricted as to rule out persons (for example, see p. 14), then, I submit, the requirement has little plausi- bility. The second requirement strikes me as a verificationist reading of a somewhat more plausible-though I think ultimately over- restrictive-requirement: namely, that a proper name pick out an individual bearer-that is, that it be the name of something. But it does not seem necessary that this singling out be such that we can (perceptually) pick out the bearer; it seems enough that a description (conceptually) identifies it. In any event, it is unclear what is to prevent us from naming an entity so picked out. Some of Durrant's other objections to the use of "God" as a proper name strike me as not very serious-for example, the claim that if "God" were a proper name it would be transliterated, not translated into other languages. But many proper names of frequent occurrence- for example, those of countries-are not generally so transliterated. And how seriously is one supposed to take the argument that "God" cannot be a proper name, because theology is a science and "a science in this (Aristotelian) sense deals not, save per accidens, with 'individual facts' but with 'universal facts,' i.e., with universal propositions which are necessarily true" (pp. 27 f.) ? But this argument again points up a fundamental question for the understanding (and evaluation) of Durrant's over-all claim-namely, what are the data of his problem? Is every claim that appears in the writings of Christian theologians, from whatever source it may be adopted, to be accounted a part of "Christian writing"? This is what Durrant appears to be suggesting, but on this interpretation of "Christian writing"-and we are given no other-the finding that Christian writing contains inconsistent uses of "God" should arouse neither surprise nor concern.
