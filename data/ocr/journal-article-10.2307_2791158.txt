In the popular series of the "History of Civilization "--more particularly in the volume "From Tribe to Empire "-Moret and Davy find that totemism is the cohesive religious force which binds together the clan; and they regard the clan as the first social grouping, and therefore the foundation of human society. This bond of totemism, they consider, "may be analysed into a sort of mystic "communion which is not the physical community of blood." It is rather "the "diffuse soul of the primitive clan "-a subtle collective principle which is compared to the mana of Melanesia and to the ka of Ancient Egypt. "There is nothing in "the universe," it is added, "which is not embraced in the totemic system, which "thus forms a sacred cosmology completing the religion of the totem." Totemism, then, assumes an importance which renders it desirable that its manifestations among all primitive peoples should be noted; and, so far as I am aware, the Mashona tribes have hitherto been neglected in this respect. I am therefore emboldened to record my observations. To begin with, and to make sure that it is totemism with which we are dealing, let me state that the totemism of the Mashona has the following attributes :- It is bound up with exogamy. The totem name is a cognomen used, more or less, in the Roman sense. It serves as a ceremonial form of address, to which there are prescribed laudatory and allusive responses; and there are also inhibitions regarding its use between the sexes. It serves also as a social bond between members of the same clan; and some- times as a collective designation of the clan. It is used as a clan oath. A taboo, or partial taboo, is attached to the animal, part of carcass, or even organ of the body, the name of which is used or implied in the totem word; and there are magical sanctions enforcing such taboo, e.g., the loss of the taboo-breaker's teeth. These attributes will suffice to show that it is totemism with which we deal; and I may now be permitted to particularize regarding the Mashona tribes, and give my observations of the characteristics of totemism among them. I have classified their totems, or totem words, together with the ceremonial responses attached to them; and it is suggested that there is an implication that ,these totem names are unreal; and that the hypostasis which lies beneath their usage is the inhibition of the sister's womb. That taboo extends, of course, to all who are addressed as sister in the classificatory system of relationship of the Mashona. In fact it extends to all of the opposite sex who have the same totem, and the same chidawo or laudatory response. In my classification I have separated what I call the clue totems; and these are either secret names of the uterus, or have a more or less direct reference to one or other of the generative organs. Other totem words apparently designate the animals, etc., which have been thought to be the mystic allies or ancestors of the clans. But there are connecting links between many of these animal totems (or totem words) and the clue totems. There are verifiable traditions of a deliberate change of the name of the clan totem from the matrical name to that of the creature or object. Also, when the totem [184 ]</page><page sequence="2">September, 1931.] MA.N. [No. 185 word is pronounced ceremonially and the prescribed response given, we may still find words and phrases which point to the probability that the totem words are allusive, and suggest hidden meanings; which, I submit, may have the sexual or generative implications of the clue totems. Let me state here, however, that I have so far failed to find a conniecting link between the clue totems and several of the others. Let us now turn to the clan oaths, in one of which a man may swear by his sister, or by his totem. " They are the same thing," he says. What is the significance of this? How can a man say that an otter, for example, is the same as his sister? I suggest that it is simply because when he swears by the totem word for otter, he does not really mean the animal. He means something associated with the great " pool " totem; and the "pool " is totemically the same as ngonya, which is a totemic word meaning the female generative organ, and which is still in use as the totem of an important clan. This clan has a legend connecting its totem (or totem word) with the clan ancestor and his sister; and relating the penalty for breaking the clan oath to sexual thought-to the conception of incest especially. And it is, of course, the taboo against incest with which we are chiefly concerned, for exogamy and the prohibition against incest are essentially the same thing; and, pace Sir James Frazer, the connection between totemism and exogamy is undoubted, at any rate among the Mashona. But, besides showing a direct connection between the principle of exogamy and the totem word of one sept, the legend in its native phraseology also furnishes links with totemic words and phrases of other exogamous groups; and those key- words have reference to sexual thought. The underlying thought of sex is also strongly implied in the behaviour pattern governing the use of all totem words. If a married woman were to be addressed by her totem name by a man, her husband would consider it evidence of criminal conversationi; and he, himself, uses the word only in the privacy of her hut. So also does the wife behave towards her husband; nor will another modest woman use his totem word, although it is also his cognomen. She should use the chidawo -the laudatory or allusive response or phrase of praise attached to his totem word. It should be stated, however, that, except by old women who do use her own totem word, a married woman should be addressed by the chidawo or laudatory response of her husband's totem. This does not seem to be altogether in consonance with the tentative theory advanced, although the restriction in the use of the totem word to women who are past bearing only has probably a sex implication. Other observations could be adduced to show that, with the Mashona, sexual thought is the inherent attribute of totemism; and that other manifestations can be explained as ideas which have emerged from secondary thoughts which have still traces of association with the primary concept. But, it may be asked, to what end, in view of the fact that Durkheim and others long ago recognized that totemism is bound up with exogamy, and that exogamy is essentially a sexual prohibition? I will attempt to show that the tentative theories I propound carry us further than this, and imply a refutation of the generalized definitions of totemism now widely accepted. Selecting a few of these, Durkheim considered that the totem is something animate or inanimate, most commonly an animal or plant from which the group is held to be descended; and which serves at once as emblem and collective name. Levy-Bruhl goes farther, and speaks of the mystic consubstantiality in which the individual, the ancestral being living again in him, and the animal or plant species 185 ]</page><page sequence="3">No. 185.] MAN. [September, 1931. that forms his totem are all mingled. Frazer sees the tribal totem tending to pass into an anthropomorphic god; while Moret and Davy see in it the diffuse soul of the clan, the concentration and individualisation of which eventually realized itself in the Pharaonic incarnation, thus linking kingship with the past age of the totemic regime of diffused power. But at least some grounds exist for supposing that, among the Mashona, the totem is none of these things, but that it is in its origin a mere implement of exogamy; and that its terms, however figurative most of them have become, have an allusion, an inner meaning and a connection- with the ruder names which were originally used in the taboo against incest; which ruder names are still so used as totem words among some of the clans. The totem word really-if sometimes obscurely, designates that which is prohibited-the forbidden womb of the sister. This thesis does more than imply that kinship thought in this Bantu tribe dominates the concept of totemism. It may reasonably be inferred from the data on which it is based that totemism is the functional part of the exogamic concept. In a case recently before me, not the clan name, and not a defined kinship, but the totem word and chidawo of the mothers of the parties (who themselves were not of the same clan) was taken as the exogamic bar to marriage. At the same time the Chief who was giving evidence demonstrated, by mimicking the act of suckling, that this totemistic relationship was identical with physical kinship. If this be the real nature of totemism, then the logical corollary is of first import- ance; for it can no longer be accepted that totemism is the mana or mystic force which bound together the clan, or the enlarged family, whichever may be considered to be the foundation of human society. The exponents of the theory that the clan is the basic social group consider that it is exogamous because totemic, and that "the primitive family is not a restricted group of which the origin is marriage and the characteristic real consanguinity; but is a more extensive domestic group not founded on marriage, but on participation in a totem, like the clan; the primitive family being thus only a form of the clan specialised and differentiated hierarchically." It is suggested that the cart may have been put before the horse, and that exogamy-that is, the prohibition of incest as conceived by the primitives-is imple- mented by the machinery of totemism. In other words, that the conception of totemism is not antecedent to that of exogamy, but follows it and is ancillary to it. It does not govern but is governed by it. Examples can be given which will show that the segmentation of first societies among the Mashona actually altered the totemic regulations. That is to say that the practice of totemism was altered by changing conditions affecting the degree of strictness considered necessary in the observation of exogamy. The marriage of a man and woman of the same totem came to be permitted, provided the ceremonial counterparts of their totem words had been altered and become different. There was (and is), too, a ceremony designed to absolve such people from the magical sanctions enforcing the taboo; and the name of this ceremony is ku cheka wulkama-which is to cut the kinship (not the totem). Is it not a reasonable conclusion that totemism followed exogamy-the artificial concept followed the natural thought? I say natural thought, because it seems to me that if the inhibition of incest be not intuitive, then it must be admitted that it would very speedily become one of the primary human axioms, born of experience and of the concentrated thought given to this phase of life by the primitives; almost certainly the fruit of the forbidden womb would manifest the breach of a true natural law. It is results that appeal to the mental processes of the uncivilized races, and a result such as the birth of an abnormal child, would be a matter of more concern [ 186 ]</page><page sequence="4">September, 1931.] MAN. [Nos. 185-186. in a primitive group than we can readily realize to-day. I submit that such events would, of themselves, lead to the prohibition of incest, and so to the more extended laws of exogamy; and that, so far from exogamy being explained by totemism, and being one of its characteristics, it precedes it and uses it as its implement. To admit this is to agree that the fundamental conscious thoughts of sex and generation must have come to humanity before there came an artificial structure used in their regulation. Ultimately, indeed, it may be implied that we must pull down all that brilliant fabric which sustains the theories of the first social grouping being held together by totemism considered as " the tangible image of the impersonal and abstract principle of mana, at once religious and social, the totem being the outward " and visible form of what we have called the totemic principle or God." That structure cannot be said to have a sound foundation if it be proved that totemism is of the nature indicated in this paper. It is not yet so demonstrated; and it is recognized that in other societies there are varying magical or ritualistic observances not found among the Mashona; and that on such data, theories of the origin and nature of totemism may be founded. But it is submitted that we cannot argue from the particular to the general; and that the attribute of totemism common to all societies, viz., its connection with exogamy, is that from which an explanation of its basic principles should be sought. The theory I propound at least furnishes a tentative explanation, and it may be considered that sufficient evidence has been adduced to justify the further investigation of an hypothesis based on observations which may be verified or discredited in an actual society among a living people numbering nearly a million -a people hitherto neglected as subjects of anthropological investigation.
