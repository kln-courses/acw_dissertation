<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE ANTHROPOMORPHISM OF GEN., CHAP. I REV. A. E. WHATHAM Louisville, Kentucky In our last article' we showed that Gen. 1: 26 exhibits clear evi- dence of the existence of a polytheistic conception of deity among the people of Israel at the time when the whole chapter was written. We shall now show that the same passage equally exhibits similar evidence that deity was conceived of at that period as possessing physical form corresponding in every respect to that of man, except, of course, that unlike that of man it could be made invisible as well as visible. In other words, we shall show that man's physical form was supposed to have been modeled after that of his Creator. Thus it is that we read: "And God said, Let us make man in our image, after our likeness. "' We do not intend it to be understood that we see in the terms "image" and "likeness" only a physical meaning, since we agree with the bishops of London and Birming- ham, the former writing me in 1899 that both he and the latter, then "Canon" Gore, see in Gen. 1:26 a reference to "man as a whole, body, soul, and spirit," Dr. Ingram, then head of Oxford House, London, adding, that this is Westcott's view expressed in his Gospel of Life. Professor Driver, however, says of this "image of God" that "it relates from the nature of the case to man's immaterial nature. It can be nothing but the gift of self- conscious reason which is possessed by man, but by no other animal" (Genesis, 15). We believe that Professor Driver's one- sided error is the result of his failure to see in Gen., chap. i, expres- sions of thought embodying beliefs current at the time this chapter was written. We have already shown that Gen., chap. i, was written before monotheism was taught in Israel, and therefore before the advent of the conception of God as essentially an invisi- 'See Biblical World, November, 191o, p. 329. 2 Peters, Early Hebrew Story; Curtiss, Primitive Semitic Religions of Today, II9. 120</page><page sequence="2">THE ANTHROPOMORPHISM OF GEN., CHAP. I 121 ble spirit. If God was believed by the Israelites to have appeared constantly to them in human form, no Hebrew scribe rejecting such a belief could possibly have included in his narrative a state- ment plainly accepting not merely a polytheistic but also an anthro- pomorphic view of deity. Both Driver and Bennett see in the expression, "and Enoch walked with God" (Gen. 5:22, 24), merely a description of Enoch's "special piety," whereas it is abundantly evident that here we have a reference to an intimacy with deity corresponding to that exhibited in Gen., chap. 3, where man is represented as enjoying the companionship of God visibly present in human form.3 Indeed, it was not until very late in Old Testa- ment times that God was thought of in any other way than as possessing a human form. It was thus that Yahweh was repre- sented as appearing to Abraham whose offer of hospitality was at once accepted by him.4 We have already shown that the sons of God, or gods, were viewed as divine beings who had contracted physical marriage with mortals. This, while evidently regarded by the Hebrew scribe who inserted this incident in Gen., chap. 6, as contrary to the usual order of marriage, was nevertheless viewed by him as equally capable of having taken place as the frequent marriages between the gods and the mortals described by classi- cal writers.s Throughout the whole of the Old Testament, angels -who differ from God merely in degree and not in kind-are viewed as divine beings who possess not only human bodies, but also the ordinary human functions of walking, eating, talking, resting, and evidently sleeping.6 Now all this shows that the expression, "Let us make man in our image," means primarily that God made man with a bodily form patterned after his own image in and by which he appeared to men. That we are here correct is definitely seen in the account of man's creation in Gen., chap. 2. Here he is formed out of the dust of the ground after the manner of a potter who makes an image of clay, complete and 3 Dillmann, in loco; Toffteen, Historic Exodus, 22, 23; cf.

Nevertheless, it already possesses a form which was none other than the image and likeness of God, and not of God only, but of the angels or other divine beings, since it was in our image and likeness that Yahweh-Elohim, a term signifying "Lord of the Gods," made man. Now it is singular that the Babylonian god, Marduk, who created man, is termed "Lord of gods," "the prince of gods," and even "god of gods."'7 Nor is the representation of man as made in the image of God, meaning, after God's supposed physical form, peculiar to the Bible. The Babylonian Gilgamesh epic describes the two heroes, Gilgamesh and Eabani, as made, the latter out of a piece of clay, in the image of the gods, and so pos- sessed of "divine appearance."8 Sayce informs us that "the Babylonian gods were represented under the form of men, so that men would have been described as created in their image," and he refers to a recent discovery by Mr. Pinches of a Babylonian text which says, "the man sagsabbar is the zalam, or image of the god Nergal." From the evidence we have now produced, both here and in article III of this series, we cannot but think that we have fully shown that Gen., chap. i, was written by a Hebrew scribe who entertained a polytheistic and anthropomorphic view of deity; and we shall therefore now conclude this series by a brief consideration of the religion of Israel in general from the "conquest" to the " exile."'' It was formerly held by scholars generally that under the teach- ing of Moses the Hebrew-Israelites he delivered from the bondage of Egypt and finally intrusted to Joshua for their conquest of, and settlement in, Canaan, were a nation of monotheists who had finally "broken, at least in principle, with heathenism," so that their subsequent frequent declensions into the idolatry of the Ca- naanites and their neighbors were nothing more than lapses under temptations too strong for them to resist. This view, which is known as "the old degeneration theory," although still held by 7Jastrow, Religion of Babylonia and Assyria, 119, 239, 437; Sayce, Religions of Ancient Babylon, 96-99; Toffteen, op. cit., 23. 8 Jastrow, op. cit., 474, 477, 490.</page><page sequence="4">THE ANTHROPOMORPHISM OF GEN., CHAP. I 123 some scholars,9 modern research shows to be entirely contrary to the facts in the case. In the light of this more careful and candid criticism, Israel is seen to have been both in heart and practice a nation of idolaters from the conquest to the exile. In Egypt they had practiced idolatry, thus copying the example of their Babylonian and Aramaic forefathers; while in Canaan they had simply gone from bad to worse.'0 Thus, in spite of their supposed specially covenanted relation to Yahweh, "history clearly shows," says Professor Bennett, "that the life of Israel does not seem to have been of a very different character from that of other nations. .... They did not suppose that Jehovah required a purer, more seemly, more humane, more spiritual wor- ship than Baal, Moloch, or Chemosh. They thought to gratify him by idolatry, religious prostitution, obscene rites and symbols, and human sacrifice, especially the sacrifice of children..... The Israelites generally had no clear understanding that Jehovah was a moral being. They did not recognize him as unique or even supreme, but tended to confuse him, and even put him on a level with the tribal and national deities of their heathen neigh- bors. The prophets confronted this popular theology with an emphatic and sweeping condemnation, and announced a different standard of conduct," which, of course, included a different belief. But if all this be so, we have thus in the recorded history of Israel two complete aspects of religion-" that of the inspired prophets, and that of the people and the religious teachers who were the mouthpieces of popular feeling."" It has been rightly said that "the religious development of Israel is virtually a development in the idea of God;"12 and, that "The history of the religion of Israel is the history of the religion of Jahweh."'3 We shall there- fore endeavor to show what Israel and its official teachers knew of Yahweh at, and subsequently to, the Exodus, and when the later prophetic teaching, with its developing conceptions of the true character and being of God, was first promulgated in Israel. 9 Hastings, Dictionary of the Bible, s.v.

But the question as to whether he further gave them any new or enlightened conception as to the true character and being of God is with some scholars still a dis- puted point. Wellhausen thinks that he did not, since "with regard to the essential nature of Jehovah, as distinct from his relation to men," he assumes that Moses "allowed them to con- tinue in the same way of thinking with their fathers." Whatever laws and statutes Moses gave them these contained nothing of a "specifically moral character."'4 It was not until the ninth- century prophets, beginning with Elijah, "that the religion of Israel became ethical and spiritual," although Amos, in the next century, was "the first to teach the faith of a practical mono- theist."'5 Even the eighth-century prophets do not declare Yahweh to be God alone, though they are silent as to all other gods. It remained for the prophet of the Exile, the so-called second-Isaiah, and other writers of that period, to declare the essential unity of the Godhead.'6 Thus it is that the bishop of Moray says that "Moses proclaimed Jahweh as the God of Israel, supreme among gods, alone to be worshiped, by the people whom he had made his own. . . . . But the realization of the truth that there is none other God but Jahweh came by slow degrees only; henotheism, which taught that Jahweh was alone to be worshiped by Israel, while the heathen deities were real, but infe- rior, gods, gave place slowly to a true monotheism."'7 Even Elijah, while the first to declare Yahweh's essential moral right- eousness, was still a henotheist.'8 His work was chiefly to extir- pate the worship of heathen deities in Israel, that of his successors of the eighth century and onward, to raise the religion of Israel to ethical purity. It was with the prophets of this century that the new conception of Yahweh's character and being, in other '4 Encyclopaedia Britannica, s.v. "Israel." 's Hastings, Dictionary of the Bible, s.v.

I125 words, the second of the two aspects of Israel's religion already referred to, had its origin. Prior to this Yahweh had been thought of by both people and teachers as a man of similar form and pas- sions to the rest of men.'9 Hitherto consequently he had been worshiped as the Yahweh according to the flesh, henceforth it was to be Yahweh according to the spirit.2o It is of course true that during this period Yahweh is not recorded as personally connected with any sexual grossness, yet the reproductive organs are held as especially sacred to him,2 while marriage between the gods and mortals was freely credited. I do not forget that W. R. Smith, while correctly viewing Gen. 6:1-4 as referring to "angels," yet thinks that we have here a piece of old Semitic mythology out of place in the religion of the Old Testament.22 Out of place with the prophetical part of the Old Testament religion it certainly is, but not with the earlier part written by the teachers of the popular and official theology of that time, a theology, moreover, which, despite the teaching of the prophets, the people refused to give up; hence it was, as Professor Bennett truly says, that the people still sought to gratify Yahweh by religious prostitution, and other obscene rites which they brought into the very temple itself (II Kings 23:6). But while the bulk of the people were thus refus- ing to listen to the spiritual teaching of the prophets, God himself, by a series of disasters, beginning with the overthrow of the Northern Kingdom in B.C. 722, and ending with that of the South in B.C. 586, had caused a few of the better minds to listen and obey. The master of St. Catherine's College, Canon Johns, sees "nothing unique about the Hebrew religion which would exempt it from the laws admitted to work in the case of other religions.23 He may be correct touching Israel's pre-prophetic religion, but not touch- ing the prophetic. Here the flesh has gone and the spirit has entirely taken its place, not with the people, however, who to the last we find given to sexual rites, although these were no longer '9 Ibid., s.v.

But prophets and priests are at last united in spiritual teaching, the- ophanies in human form are now no longer taught, not simply ignored, but absolutely rejected as impossible.24 So thorough had been this spiritual teaching, that when Judah returned from exile the old tendency to idolatry, which had lasted throughout the entire period of the judges and the monarchy, was gone for ever, giving place to a staunch and loyal monothesim. But how? By the at length enforced moral standards of the prophets and their conception of God, both utterly unaccounted for by their environment, or by "the laws admitted to work in the case of other religions." Critical research makes it impossible for us to trace this conception of the prophets of the eighth century back to Abraham and Moses: nevertheless the prophets had it, and the question is, How did they get it? Surely Professor Barton is more correct than Canon Johns in saying, "Men spake from God, being moved by the Holy Spirit"; in other words, by some- thing unique, by revelation.25 It will be recalled that, in the first article of this series, I showed that modern scholars freely admitted the existence of nothing beyond a human element in a large part of the Bible; in other words, that here we have, to requote Canon Beeching, "no part of divine revelation at all." Now comes a new volume of Cambridge Biblical Essays, edited by the Regius professor of divinity, Dr. Swete. Speaking on "The Religious Aspect of the Bible," he says, "Its authority has been undisputed; in all matters of which it treats it has been regarded as infallible. This belief has been sincere, but unreasoning, and held for the most part without intelligence or discernment. But such faith in the Bible must go down before the march of knowledge." And he then sounds a note of warning to those who would avert the danger of the present decline in the religious use of the Bible, that their aim must be to place it "upon a basis from which no legiti- mate criticism can cast it down." It is in some small measure to aid in effecting this result that the present series of papers has 24 Encyclopaedia Biblica, s.v.

Criticism shows plainly that, in the words of Pro- fessor Bennett, "The Bible is the record of human misunderstand- ing as well as of divine revelations," and yet, even the misunder- standing is based on the effort to represent God as supreme, just, and holy. When we come to the eighth century, a new era opens in Israel's religion, and the divine element breaks forth with a light that is never afterward dimmed by human error, but which grows brighter and brighter until it needs but the teaching of Jesus to become the ultimate conception of God for the ages.2- 26 Barton, Semitic Origins, 303. 4'4~A~.
