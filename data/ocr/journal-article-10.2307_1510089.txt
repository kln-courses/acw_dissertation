Among Chris- tians, the work engaged a national debate, involving church, state, and the universities, about the authority and interpretation of the Bible.3 Great political as well as intellectual issues were at stake. To understand the Christian cultural context of Spinoza's Treatise, it is necessary to attend to a critical event in 1666: the publication of Philosophia S. Scripturae interpres by Ludwig Meyer (died 1681) of Amsterdam, a prominent physician, philosopher, philologist, and playwright of Lutheran background, and also a friend of Spinoza. This book created a sensation, eliciting a flood of quick responses, mostly hostile.4 The most interesting Judah ibn Alfakhar (died 1235), physician at the court of Ferdinand III of Castile, opposed Maimonides, believing it was impossible to reconcile Judaism with philosophy.

In 1666 Amsterdam Jews were absorbing the news that the Messiah had appeared in Smyrna in the person of Shabbetai Zevi (Henry Mechoulan, "Intro- duction," in Menasseh ben Israel, The Hope of Israel [ed. Henry Mechoulan and Gerard Nahon; Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1987] 76). 3This agrees with the judgment of Moshe Goshen-Gottstein ("Foundations of Biblical Philology in the Seventeenth Century: Christian and Jewish Dimensions," in Jewish Thought in the Seventeenth Century, 80) that Spinoza represents a unique case among Jews "a mind trained in traditional Jewish learning tackling issues that developed in the world of Christian thinking." Thus, Richard Popkin's judgment ("Spinoza and Samuel Fisher," Philosophia: Philosophical Quarterly of Israel 15 [1985] 221-222) that in the Tractatus "Spinoza's oppo- nents. . . are exclusively Jewish scholars," and that he "only discussed Jewish interpretations and Jewish interpreters" must be qualified.

Although a fellow phi- losopher, Spinoza broke with his friend, arguing that scripture could not be interpreted philosophically, but must be approached historically. Only by placing his work in the context of that particular debate is it possible to assess Spinoza's achievement as an innovator in biblical study. Only in this way can one understand more precisely what he meant by his proposals and how his contemporaries were likely to have understood him. This is also the only way to assess the degree of his originality and the distance he put between himself and his contemporaries regarding one of the most contested issues of the day. The authority claimed by Protestant theologians to implement God's law in the public sphere rested on their extravagant claims regarding biblical authority, originating in the Protestant revolt, and regarding their own abil- ity to decipher what the Bible and God intended for contemporary society. For philosophers such as Meyer and Spinoza, both passionate advocates of intellectual and religious liberty, the critical issues were manifold: What sort of authority actually inheres in scripture and how, if at all, is that authority to be exercised in the realm of public law? What method guar- antees that its genuine meanings are being extracted? Who is qualified or authorized to answer such questions, and on what grounds? For philoso- phers especially, the burgeoning competence of reason, reinforced by the revolution in knowledge and philosophy, collided with the cognitive claims made for scripture, now inflated by Protestant theologians beyond anything known to earlier tradition. Meyer's work provides us with a compendium of the contemporary ar- guments about scripture.

Of the works cited, Velthuysen and Wolzogen were in Spinoza's library. Embattled Cartesians at the University of Leyden regarded Meyer's work with dismay, since he promoted it precisely as a work of Cartesian persuasion. They condemned two theses from Meyer that provided their orthodox opponents with ammunition in their campaign to persuade the government and public that Cartesian philosophy undermined scriptural authority: (1) "that in matters of faith the norm and measure of truth is clear and distinct perception," and (2) that "philosophy is the inter- preter of scripture." In 1676 the theses were included in a government decree prohibiting their being taught (Thomas A. McGahagan, "Cartesianism in the Netherlands, 1639-1676: The New Science and the Calvinist Counter-Reformation" [Ph.D. diss., University of Pennsylva- nia, 1976] 327, 344-45).</page><page sequence="4">364 HARVARD THEOLOGICAL REVIEW othersS begins to reveal the extent to which Spinoza's Treatise was part of a complex conversation and debate, carried on in the freest and most cul- turally rich region in Europe, where daring ideas could be publicly aired and outrageous opinions published. Perhaps more than anywhere in Europe, in Holland the endgames of traditional Judaism and Christianity played out in eerily similar ways, in Marrano and millenarian Judaism on one side and Socinian and Collegiant Christianity on the other.6 Much more work needs to be done on the numerous writings by Spinoza's contemporaries that constituted the conversation of which he was the most innovative participant. The present article contributes to that task by exam- ining just one segment of the debate: the relationship between Spinoza's Treatise and Meyer's book. I shall show how Spinoza's book is in part a response to Meyer,7 that Meyer is an opponent concealed in the Tractatus under the name of Maimonides, and that Meyer's book is also Spinoza's source for the views attributed to Alfakhar. It is necessary to supply infor- mation about the relationship between Meyer and Spinoza before turning to their texts. g The Relationship Between Meyer and Spinoza In 1663, Spinoza's Principles of the Philosophy of Descartes was pub- lished his first publication, and the only work he ever brought out under his own name. Under Spinoza's distant supervision he was no longer liv- ing in Amsterdam the work was edited and published by his friend Meyer, who also provided his own careful and perceptive introduction, accurately pointing out where the author followed Descartes and where he philoso- phized on his own.8 The two men had probably met at Franciscus van den Enden's Latin school. Meyers doctorate in philosophy along with his medical degree, received in Leiden in 1660 and his passionate devotion to Descartes made him an ideal editor for Spinoza's commentary. In 1666, Meyer published his only work on the Bible, Philosophia S. Scripturae interpres. The epilogue may contain reference to Spinoza's Short Treatise, at that time still unpublished. I know of no evidence that Spinoza had any role in producing the linked- book edition of his and Meyer's work (1674), but the publisher and learned sSee "Glossaire des sectes et mouvements religieux au temps de Spinoza," in Meinsma, Spinoza, 531-36. 6To understand the religious and psychological similarities in the Jewish and Christian communities, see Yovel, Marrano 1. passim; and Fix, Prophecy, passim. 7In a later study I plan to incorporate the other voices in the conversation precipitated by Meyer, which Spinoza probably considered in crafting his own Treatise. 8Spinoza, Descartes' 'Principles of Philosophy,' in The Collected Works of Spinoza (trans. and ed.

SAMUEL PREUS 365 public would obviously regard the two anonymous works as closely related and perhaps equally enlightening or scandalous. In 1674, in the wake of the victory of the orthodox Calvinist party associated with the accession of William III of Orange, an edict of the Dutch government singled out four books, forbidding their printing or sale: Thomas Hobbes' Leviathan, the Bibliotheca Fratrum Polonorum (a Socinian work), Spinoza's Treatise, and Meyer's Philosophy. Again, Spinoza and Meyer were linked.9 The relationship between Spinoza and Meyer, moreover, was personal as well as professional. Meyer was a correspondent and perhaps frequent visi- tor to Spinoza and was long considered probably mistakenly the physi- cian that the philosopher summoned to attend him on his deathbed.10 Finally, in 1677, Meyer cooperated with another close friend and mem- ber of the inner circle of Spinoza's associates, the Collegiant Jarig Jelles, in editing Spinoza's Posthumous Works. Meyer prepared the Latin transla- tion of Jelles's preface. This is the earliest account of the philosopher's life and thought, and the only one written by people who actually knew him. Meyer also probably edited the whole work for publication. g Textual Relations This study is based primarily on three sources: Spinoza's Treatise, Meyerss Philosophy, and Maimonides' Guide of the Perplexed. Maimonides remains in the background in this study, since there is a considerable body of scholarship on him and Spinoza, and my primary purpose here is to intro- duce Meyer into that picture. In the minds of contemporary readers, Spinoza and Meyer were inevita- bly considered together after 1674, when the second printing of the Trea- tise appeared bound in one volume with Meyer's Philosophy. 12 Thus, historical understanding of Spinoza's book requires a reading in that light. 9McGahagan, "Cartesianism," 333. l°Meinsma, Spinoza, 470.

J. Siebrand pointed out that early accounts of Spinoza's life and thought by his admirers were preoccupied by the need to show the compatibility of Spinoza's thought with Christianity (Spinoz.a and the Netherlanders: An Inquiry into the Early Reception of his Philosophy of Religion [Assen/ Maastricht: van Gorcum, 1988]). This concern obviously controls Jelles's presentation of Spinoza in his preface to the Posthumous Works. l2Klaus Scholder asserts that Meyer's work was at first "universally attributed to" Spinoza (The Birth of Modern Critical Theology [1966; trans. John Bowden; reprinted Philadelphia: Trinity, 1990] 139).</page><page sequence="6">366 HARVARD THEOLOGICAL REVIEW Scholars have long known that the Treatise bears some literary relationship to Meyer's work, although the fact has been ignored, and detailed analysis of the relationship between the works is practically non-existent.13 That Spinoza's critique of the obscure "Alfakhar" is directed at contemporary Protestant theologians is acknowledged in a general way, but it has not been noticed that the real source of "Alfakhar's" opinions is Meyer's book. Also unnoticed is the probability that Spinoza's cutting criticism of "Maimonides," particularly on the issue of biblical interpretation, targets Ludwig Meyer and the implication of his views.14 Consideration of Meyer's work will help to understand the imperfect fit between some of Spinoza's criticisms of "Maimonides" and the actual writing of the medieval philoso- pher. In those instances, an investigation of Meyer reveals the true target of Spinoza's criticisms. I will also show that Meyer is as good a candidate as Maimonides for being cast as Spinoza's archtypal dogmatist. It is not correct to eclipse Maimonides as a real opponent in the Treatise (especially on the nature of prophecy and the anthropomorphic language of the Bible), but Meyer must be accorded a place in the picture as well. Much has been made of Spinoza's deceptiveness, and an investigation of Meyer reveals a new way in which Spinoza has fooled the reader. His attacks on medieval Jewish authors were a prudent strategy for insinuating himself into the Christian debate about scripture without endangering his already precarious status by attacking Christians. At certain places in the Treatise, it is apparent that "Maimonides" and "Alfakhar" are masks for contemporary disputants whose positions are reviewed in Meyer's book and 3Brief treatments are available in "Introduction," in Louis Meyer, La philosophie interprete de l'Ecriture Sainte (trans. [into French] Jacqueline Legrec and Pierre-Fransois Moreau; Paris: Intertextes, 1988) 1-17; Edwin Curley, "Notes on a Neglected Masterpiece: Spinoza and the Science of Hermeneutics," in Graeme Hunter, ed., Spinoza: the Enduring Questions (Toronto: University of Toronto Press, 1994) 77-79; Brad S. Gregory, "Introduction," in Baruch Spinoza, Tractatus Theologico-Politicus (trans. Smauel Shirley; Leiden: Brill, 1991) 41. Scholder's few pages in The Birth of Modern Critical Theology on Meyer and Spinoza provide the most extensive comparison of their hermeneutical principles available in English. He fails, however, to appreciate the distinctiveness and significance of Spinoza's "historical" versus Meyer's "philosophical" hermeneutic (see Scholder, Birth, 141), embodied in Spinoza's critique of Meyer, which I explicate in this study. Regarding Meyer, Scholder is dependent on Ernst Bizer, "Die reformierte Orthodoxie und der Cartesianismus," ZThK 55 (1958) 306-72. Bizer's essay makes no mention of Spinoza. Akkerman and Hubbeling ("Preface," 106) make no reference to Meyer's book, even though they urge that "the many-sided activities of this interesting man have been given too little attention as yet." C. Louise Thijssen-Schoute (Lodewijk Meyer en diens Verhouding tot Descartes en Spinoza [Leiden: Brill, 1954]) does not attend to issues of biblical interpretation other than noting Spinoza's broad disagreement with his friend's thesis. Standard treatments of Spinoza's biblical interpretation usually do not mention Meyer at all. l4Spinoza Tractatus chaps. 7, 15.

Some of the most fundamental issues of the Treatise, moreover, are found in various states of development in Meyerss book, so that one gains a sharper perception of Spinoza's intentions and originality by studying Meyer, as Spinoza did.ls In her 1937 work on Spinoza's associates, Madeleine Frances made two claims: first, that the disagreement between Meyer and Spinoza over bib- lical interpretation is not fundamental because of their underlying philo- sophical affinities, and second, that chapter 15 of the Treatise is partially constructed as a discussion of the Philosophy.l6 She was certainly correct in her second claim, but not in the first. Both are philosophers, political liberals, champions of tolerance, and students of Descartes, but Spinoza's disagreement with Meyer is as profound as his differences with Maimonides. Spinoza's definitive substitution of history for philosophy as the categorical matrix for biblical interpretation makes the Treatise paradigmatic in the sense of an exemplary work that systematically formulates a new historical, critical, and comparative approach to the Bible. My procedure is to identify and comment on places where Spinoza seems to draw on or react to Meyer in some way. I begin by contrasting their ways of adapting the ancient philosophical distinction between skeptics and dog- matists. Next, I show that Meyerss Philosophy is the real source of the "skeptical" opinions attributed to Rabbi Alfakhar in Chapter 15 of the Trea- tise, under whose alias the opinions of Meyerss Christian opponents reap- pear. Finally, this comparison addresses two issues of fundamental importance in Spinoza's book that Meyer already discussed extensively: the Protestant principle that scripture is its own interpreter and the relationship between meaning and truth in the work of exegesis. This material is evidence not only that Spinoza's thinking on these themes presupposes Meyer, but that part of the motivation for writing the Treatise may have been the appear- ance of Meyerss work and the responses to it. We shall see how Spinoza takes up these two themes and transforms them for his own ends. My conclusion is that Spinoza and Meyer represent coherent and funda- mentally opposed approaches to biblical interpretation: philosophical and l5I shall not try to settle questions of "influence," since Spinoza had begun work on the Treatise in 1665, a year before Meyer published his book (Freudenthal, Spinoza, 1. 154). l6Frances, Spinoza, 256. On Meyer's differences with Spinoza, she writes (255) "the op- position, admitted by Gebhardt, between the rationalist exegesis of Meyer and the historical exegesis of Spinoza. . . is not so radical as it first appears. According to the TTP [Treatise], scripture ought to be explicated by scripture, comprehension of the prophet or redactor being so distant in time from our own. But once his meaning is determined, this thought, to obtain our assent, ought to be submitted to the examination of reason." Although this is true, Frances neglects to mention that for Meyer, a meaning (sensus) that is not true according to our judgment based on knowledge or reason cannot be the intended meaning (verus sensus) of a scriptural text. This makes Meyer's difference from Spinoza radical.</page><page sequence="8">368 HARVARD THEOLOGICAL REVIEW "historical" a method Spinoza carefully defines even as he invents it. Spinoza in fact appears to be the first philosopher among Jews or Chris- tians to reject philosophy as a tool for biblical interpretation. This study also shows that Meyer's system, which makes Cartesian a long tradition of philosophical hermeneutics deriving from Philo and shared by both Jewish and Christian tradition, is the specific object of Spinoza's wrath upon the dogmatists, who appear under the name "Maimonides." Maimonides is in fact a real opponent of Spinoza's, but there are places in Spinoza's critique where "Maimonides" more likely means Meyer, since Spinoza's critique in those places reflects Meyer's language and proposals.17 g Skeptics and Dogmatists As is well known, the distinction between dogmatists and skeptics is basic to Spinoza's argument in Chapter 15 of the Treatise; by means of it he divides the world of Jewish and Christian exegetes into two distinct camps. Meyer had already taken up this philosophical classification and adapted it to the current Christian theological context. He remarked that in the ancient world the dogmatists were "those who teach that certain and indubitable knowledge of things is derived from true principles," while the skeptics were those "who, on the contrary, casting everything in doubt, pronounce that nothing can be known with certainty.''18 The same division occured among contemporary theologians, as Meyer observes. "For the greater part of them have the audacity to hold that they have derived the true and evident knowledge (notitia) of theological matters (rerum) from the Sacred Letters, and they proclaim that others must teach the same.''19 These are Meyer's counterparts of the ancient dogmatists. Today's skeptics frankly confess that many, although not all, of the matters concerning Christian religion are plausibly to be sought and deduced from the scriptures, but they subject those things that are uncertain and doubtful to the better and wiser judgment of others, and speaking sub correctione ["under correction"], as they say, they submit themselves to be cor- rected by them.20 Meyer's dogmatists, then, think scripture is clear and certain enough for them to derive all Christian teaching from it, while his skeptics are willing to submit uncertain matters to the judgment of the religious authorities. t7I shall not discuss Spinoza's argument with Maimonides over prophets and prophecy, the subject of Treatise chaps. 1-2, or over biblical anthropomorphisms, the pivotal issue in the Guide (see Leo Strauss, "How to Begin to Study The Guide of the Perplexed," in Maimonides, Guide, 1. xi-lvi). l8Meyer Philosophia prol. iii. l9Ibid. 20Ibid.</page><page sequence="9">J. SAMUEL PREUS 369 Thus, Meyer still operated within the discursive framework of the six- teenth-century, inner-Christian debate, approximating the dogmatists to most Protestants and the skeptics to the Roman Catholics.21 Meanwhile, the voices of the great philosophical interpreters a tradition with which Meyer him- self identified were omitted. Now, rising above the sectarian fray, Meyer brought back that great tradition, refurbished in the light of Cartesian phi- losophy, as a means to transcend conflict. Spinoza gave the distinction between dogmatists and skeptics a wider application. Instead of dividing the world between Christian sects on the basis of their location of religious authority, Spinoza returned to the clas- sical meaning of the distinction, which identified rival assessments of the powers of reason. He broadened the picture to embrace the Jewish tradition while pretending that his quarrel was with Jews. He then defined skeptics and dogmatists according to their method of negotiating rival truth claims of reason on one side and scripture on the other: the dogmatists, confident in rationality, subordinate scripture to reason, while the skeptics, suspicious of reason, subordinate it to scripture.22 Spinoza had turned the tables on Meyer, moving the scripturists most Protestants and neo-Karaite Jews from the dogmatist into the skeptical camp (for example, "Alfakhar"), and consigning Meyer himself to the dog- matists under the alias of Maimonides. According to Spinoza's definition of the distinction, Meyer actually fits the dogmatist profile more exactly than Maimonides does, since, as Spinoza reads him, on critical points Maimonides is a skeptic. For example, according to Spinoza, Maimonides agreed with those rabbis who taught that obedience to the Noachian version of God's law is sufficient for Gentile salvation only if that law is recognized as revealed, and is embraced for that reason. Spinoza regarded this point as important, quoting Maimonides' conclusion,23 but then smartly dismissing the idea. Meyer, in contrast, in no case subordinated reason to the con- straints of scriptural letter or doctrine. Thus, Spinoza's introduction of the distinction between skeptics and dogmatists was probably prompted by Meyer's prologue, but then reconstructed at Meyer's expense. g The Identity of "Alfakhar" Rabbi Alfakhar is given the role of Spinoza's paradigmatic skeptic in Chapter 15 of the Treatise. Spinoza's real source for Alfakhar's opinions, however, is the section in Meyer's Philosophy where Meyer cites his 2IMeyer's definition of skeptic aligns perfectly with the Catholic Pyrrhonists which Rich- ard H.

He thought that a passage should not be interpreted metaphorically, simply because it was repugnant to reason, but only in the cases when it is inconsistent with scripture itself that is, with its clear doctrines. Therefore he laid down the universal rule, that whatsoever scripture teaches dogmatically. . . must on its own sole authority be admitted as absolutely true: that there is no doctrine in the Bible which directly contradicts it, but only some which do so indirectly, because scripture's modes of speaking often seem to imply something contrary to what it has expressly taught. Such phrases, and such phrases only, we may interpret metaphorically.25 The source for this opinion of "Alfakhar" is Meyer, who cited an unnamed Reformed theologian who contended that scripture is not to be subjected to reason, but rather, when sacred scripture teaches something clearly and officially, or boyRaxt4£t [dogmatizes], to which it seems to oppose the contrary in some other place. . ., then that clear place must be understood prop- erly and according to the letter, while the other passage is to be inter- preted figuratively and in agreement with the first.26 Thus, Spinoza merely paraphrased Meyer's quotation, attributed it to Alfakhar, and rejected it because, in determining the truth of a passage, it 24I discovered this by examining annotations made by Prosper Marchand (died 1756), a learned bookdealer and editor of the Treatise who noticed three parallel passages in Treatise 15 and the Philosophy.

SAMUEL PREUS 371 subordinates reason to the literal sense of scripture. The examples Spinoza gives also come directly from Meyer?s discussion of whether God's unity and incorporeality can be asserted with certainty in the face of apparently contradictory texts, thus showing how reason is constrained by the ortho- dox rule. Meyer handles the examples as follows: By which places [Meyer had quoted from Deuteronomy 4] it is clearly taught that God is incorporeal. Wherefore [following my opponent's principle], we are constrained by this precept, and not by reason: conse- quently, every text in which it appears we could gather that God has a body has to be interpreted according to this precept [that is, meta- phorically].27 Spinoza's examples and exposition are the same as Meyerts. Because scripture clearly teaches the unity of God, we are bound (according to skeptical doctrine) to believe it "not," Spinoza noted, "because a plurality is repugnant to reason, but because scripture distinctly asserts that there is only one God." He also explained: "Because scripture asserts (as Alfakhar thinks) in Deut 4:15 that God is incorporeal, we are bound, solely by the authority of this text, and not by reason, to believe that God has no body."28 Up to this point Spinoza had merely borrowed from MeyerSs recital of contemporary Calvinist opinion, including MeyerSs examples; he then at- tributed these contemporary Chnstian opinions to Rabbi Alfakhar.29 There is an additional reason to look elsewhere for the source of Spinoza's "Alfakhar": the idea that scripture teaches "dogmatically" is not only a thoroughly Christian, but also a very un-Jewish manner of speaking about 27Meyer Philosophia 11.75.

Scriptura clare docet, Deum esse unicum. . . nec ullibi alius locus reperitur directe affirmans, dari plures Deos: at quidem plura, ubi Deus de se, et Prophetae de Deo in plurali numero loquuntur, qui modus tantum loquendi supponit, non autem ipsius orationis intentum indicat, plures esse Deos, et ideo ipsa omnia metaphorice explicanda, scilicet non quia rationi repugnat, plures dari, sed quia ipsa Scriptura directe affirmat, unicum esse Deum.... Ex sola... hujus loci et non rationis auctoritate, tenemur credere Deum. 29This explanation of Spinoza's source improves upon Leo Strauss (Spinoz.a's Critique, 316-17), who introduces what he regards as the relevant text from Alfakhar. The Hebrew text that he quotes, however, lacks the rule that Spinoza has attributed to Alfakhar.

In a manner atypical for a Jewish author, Spinoza tackled issues developed in the world of Christian thinking about which there was "no sign of interest' among seventeenth-century Jews.30 Despite Spinoza's use of material borrowed from Meyer, he did so for a purpose entirely at odds with Meyer. Meyer made the case that resort to reason ("philosophy") is unavoidable even in orthodox biblical interpreta- tion. Despite his claim to use "dogmatically" stated passages rather than reason, as the norm for interpreting unclear or apparently contradictory passages, the theologian still has to exercise reason to explain how she or he decides which passages to take literally that is, which are in fact stated "dogmatically" (proprie) and which figuratively (figurate) or allegorically (allegorice). 3 1 Spinoza had a different approach, since his purpose did not involve establishing theologically normative opinions, but rather discovering what each text means. Rather than simply exposing a rather trivial orthodox inconsistency, as Meyer did, Spinoza commended "Alfakhar" for invoking the principle that scripture should be interpreted by scripture in order to determine the "meaning of utterances and the mind of the prophets."32 In Spinoza's view, the skeptics' literalism does not prevent them from discern- ing the meaning of the text; their mistake is to equate the literal meaning with the truth. Spinoza criticized the skeptics for debasing reason, the "true handwrit- ing of God's word" (verum Dei verbi syngraphym), and putting in its place the mere "letter and idol" (litera et idolo) of that word.33 Thus Spinoza skewered seventeenth-century Protestant bibliolatry for its emphasis on the authority of literal readings. In his view, handing over one's power of judgment to the "prejudices of ancient vulgi [biblical authors]" amounts to "stupidity, not piety." Scripture must be explicated through scripture when one tries to establish meaning, but after having elicited the true meaning of a text, one must exercise reason before assenting to the text's directives.34 30Goshen-Gottstein, "Foundations," 80. The author observes that for Jewish intellectual history in the seventeenth century, attitudes toward the Bible were not problematic (p. 79). His opinion thus supports my suggestion that Spinoza's "Maimonides" and "Alfakhar" in that context are in reality Christian opponents. The Jewish view of the great Hebrew Bibles pub- lished by Bomberg's press is instructive: "There is no ideology, no theology. This is not an sinerrant' text in any Christian dogmatic sense, but an attempt to attain a 'correct' print in a very traditional sense according to traditional ideas about Spanish codices" (p. 85). 3 tMeyer Philosophia 1 1.75 . 32Spinoza Tractatus 15. 182 (ET 191 [altered]). 33Ibid., 15.182 (ET 192 [altered]). 34Spinoza Tractatus 15.181 (ET 191); Verum quidem est Scripturam per Scripturam explicandam esse, quamdiu de solo orationum sensu, et mente Prophetarum laboramus, sed postquam verum sensum eruimus, necessario judicio et ratione utendum, ut ipsi assensum praebeamus (my italics).</page><page sequence="13">J. SAMUEL PREUS 373 After pummeling "Alfakhar" with evidence that the Bible asserts things that are repugnant to reason and that it repeatedly contradicts itself, Spinoza cited 1 Sam 15:29 (God "is not a man that he should repent"). In this citation, Spinoza again drew on Meyer's argument that even the strict bib- lical literalist must rely on the judgment of reason. Meyer agreed with his opponent that contradictory texts need to be harmonized, since scripture cannot say any untruth; despite the orthodox rule to the contrary, the ortho- dox theologian must inevitably use reason authoritatively to choose which texts to take literally: He is compelled, when scripture seems to him to contradict itself, to confess that one is permitted to use reason in order that he might discern which places are to be understood and interpreted properly, and which improperly and figuratively.35 Spinoza employed the same text from 1 Sam 15:29 a text that contra- dicts passages such as Jer 18:8-10 but Spinoza used it as hard evidence for the opposite point: passages from scripture cannot be harmonized be- cause in their genuine meaning they sometimes flatly contradict each other. Spinoza demanded, Are not these two texts directly contradictory? Which of the two, then, would our author want to explain metaphorically? Both statements are general (universalis) and each is the opposite (contraria) of the other. What one flatly affirms, the other flatly denies. So, by his own rule, he [Alfakhar] would be obliged at the same time to reject them as false, and to accept them as true.36 Neither text can be read metaphorically, so the interpreter must accept both, for all attempts at harmonization are a violation of proper exegetical procedure. Meyer maintained that philosophy must be used to harmonize; Spinoza, in contrast, would conclude that "we may take it for indisputable that theology is not bound to serve reason, nor reason theology, but that each has her own domain."37 It is his "absolute conclusion that scripture must not be accommodated to reason, nor reason to scripture."38 This con- clusion throws both Maimonides and Alfakhar that is, both Meyer and his opponent "entirely out of court." 35Meyer Philosophia 11.76; Cogetur. . . cum Scriptura sibi ipsi videtur contradicere, fateri, ratione uti licere, ut dignosci possit, quaenam loca proprie, quaenam improprie sint, et figurate intelligenda atque interpretanda.

Spinoza's repeated insistence that scripture interprets itself which seems to be an echo of classical Protestant doctrine gains focus and new mean- ing once it is read against the background of Meyer's powerful critique of that principle. MeyerSs attack may have helped Spinoza to realize how effectively he could exploit the similarity between his approach to the text and that of the Protestant tradition, for to the unwary reader Spinoza's position may sound quite Protestant. On this topic one can also see clearly that Meyer lurks behind Spinoza's "Maimonides," and one can understand where Spinoza's discussion engages the central issue to seventeenth-century Christianity not twelfth-century Judaism. This is the place, moreover, where in Spinoza's view Meyer has taken a wrong turn, not only hermeneutically, but also politically. The discussion starts with MeyerSs argument, which warrants extended treatment here because it is little known and constitutes the most interesting and persuasive part of his book. Meyer's critique of Scriptura sui interpres ("Scripture interprets it- selfR'): Meyer develops numerous arguments to prove that "in no way what- soever does scripture seem a sufficient norm for interpreting itself."39 He has already quoted a string of Protestant dogmaticians to the effect that "God so disposed the sacred scripture that it is not only the norm, but also the interpreter of itself."40 First, Meyer critiqued the idea that the help of the Holy Spirit is integral to interpretation. The theologians fatally compromise their own principle that scripture interprets itself by insisting that the aid of the Holy Spirit is needed to validate an interpretation. The necessity of the internal witness of the Holy Spirit negates the principle; moreover, the theologians are not clear about what they really mean. Even laying aside that problem, the text itself even though it is the "word of God" in some objective sense41- cannot be "its own interpreter" because of the nature of texts in general, and biblical writings in particular.42 Second, Meyer asserted that one text does not interpret another. The reformers wanted to elucidate the meaning of obscure texts by using other, distant texts the meaning of which is known and clear.43 They appealed to a classic prooftext from Augustine, who said that the essential truths are 39Meyer Philosophia 11.74. Meyer drew on Robert Bellarmine's classic critical analysis of the Protestant scripture principle, De controversiis Christianaefidei adversus hujus temporis haereticos (4 vols.; Venice: Malichinum, 1721). See Prima Controversia: De Verbo Dei, esp.

SAMUEL PREUS 375 stated repeatedly and clearly and serve as a guide for interpretation.44 Meyer objected: "What business (commercium) does one place in scripture have with another? Or by what right or privilege (us, praerogativa) does this text come to be interpreted in, through, or from that one?"45 On what grounds is it possible, for example, to argue that what Matthew or Mark said obscurely should be clarified by what Luke or John said, and vice versa? "Could not the authors of those writings, if they were still alive, rightly object to the fact that their own writings had either come to serve for, or be subjected to, the explanation of others?"46 Each text, Meyer insisted, has the "right" to be interpreted in its own context alone, for plainly its own authority (auctoritas) stands firm at each place of scripture; its own truth is in itself, and its own meaning (sensus), which neither depends upon another nor ought to be determined through another. For we nowhere read that something from the writings of one Apostle has been granted the right to interpret another.47 Even if one place seems to interpret another, "on what grounds can we be certain that the intention (mens) of one place is clearly the same as that of the other?"48 Even use of the same words, after all, does not guarantee the same or even a compatible meaning; the same words could be intended literally in one place and allegorically in another. The author, moreover, could have intended more than one meaning in a given text.49 Meyer went on to assert that words signify by convention, not per se (through themselves). The theologians' doctrine assumed that words and sentences have intrinsically stable meanings, regardless of how they are interpreted by various commentators. Is the meaning of an utterance (sermo) in fact accessible per se? If per se means that the sense of words is acces- sible because words have an enduring natural meaning, the interpreter is mistaken. The meanings of words are entirely conventional and therefore variable; they are social-historical constructs the meanings of which can be 44Ibid., 11.69. The key passage is from Augustine's De doctrina christiana 2.6 in Opere di Sant' Agostino (ed. Mario Naldini et al.; 34 vols.; Rome: Citta Nuova Editrice, 1992) 8.66: Nihil enim fere de illis obscuritatibus eruitur, quod non planissime alibi dictum reperiatur. See my discussion in From Shadow to Promise: Old Testament Interpretation from Augustine to the Young Luther (Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press, 1969) 12. 45Meyer Philosophia 11.69. 46Ibid., 11.69; Spinoza agrees with this point (for example, Tractatus 7.104 [ET 1063, 12.164 [ET 171]) because he does not share the Protestant doctrines of scriptural inspiration or the analogy of faith; they are no part of his adaptation of the notion that scripture interprets itself. 47Meyer Philosophia 11.70. 48Ibid. 49Ibid., 3.30-</page><page sequence="16">376 HARVARD THEOLOGICAL REVIEW learned only through careful study of the contextual uses of the language.50 They are not like invariable mathematical formulae the meanings of which are rooted in universal nature. In addition, Meyer maintained that scripture's ordinary language is in- adequate to its interpretation. Even if ordinary usage at the time forms the basis for the meaning of the words, this provides only the most vulgar and common sense of words and passages. To make such meanings the norm of interpretation of scripture leads to hermeneutical disaster, as Meyer said: Truly this [common meaning] is not the suitable and legitimate inter- preter of the sacred letters nay rather it is almost the single source of all false interpretations, which is clear from this: the great mass of men, among whom "common usage" must be sought, not only err but hold and favor perverse and monstrous notions of God and divine things. If anyone should impose such notions upon scripture, and apply them to the understanding and explanation of those texts, what will result but the production of expositions as remote as possible from the meaning intended by God and the sacred scriptures?51 Meanings derived in this way are not the intended meanings, principally because they are not true; this is one of the critical points taken up by Spinoza. Finally, Meyer questioned the cardinal Protestant principle of the clarity and sufficiency of scripture. The Protestants asserted that the true meaning is clear at least in those passages that are essential to salvation, and that such passages can be used to interpret other, obscure passages. Behind this principle lies the theological postulate that all the essential saving teach- ings of scripture are contained in such per se clear passages. Without this principle, scripture could not interpret itself and Christians would have to submit to external authority, papal or otherwise. This argument, however, "fails miserably," according to Meyer,52 be- cause texts of all kinds are inevitably understood or read in different ways by different people. As a Roman Catholic author observed, something per- fectly clear to one person is obscure to someone else for example, the notorious "Hoc est corpus meum", or "verbum caro factum."53 The Roman Catholic used this argument to support papal authority, while Meyer em- ployed it to argue for toleration of different interpretations. A text that is supposed to prove something clearly, univocally, and dogmatically fails to account for the variety of socially constructed meanings and the consequent 5°Ibid., 1 1.71-72. slIbid., 11.72. s2Ibid., 11.75. 53Ibid., 11.75-76. Controversies over these two phrases, "This is my body" and "The Word became flesh," were frequent and especially ferocious in the early modern era.</page><page sequence="17">J. SAMUEL PREUS 377 variety of reader responses. The allegedly clear text, therefore, does not function as advertised. Meyer begged his opponents to enlighten him on how it could be otherwise, since every text encodes at least the possibility of a double sense. Even if a clear and unequivocal text exists, it is not possible to ascertain that fact from the text itself, since meanings are not intrinsic to words and sentences, but are socially constructed. Meyer's more serious point, however, is that clarity and ambiguity are not an attribute of texts at all, but of their reception.54 The theologians argued absurdly when they insisted that the text is clear in itself, whether or not readers realize it, just as the sun is bright whether or not anyone is looking. The analogy is false. The characteristics of the sun are absolute, while utterances are occasions of human interaction and their meanings have no existence independent of those occasions. The sun sheds its light whether or not it is seen, but the Bible sheds no meaning when it is not read or understood.55 Thus, the mere fact of sincere disagreement about the meaning of any text examples were endless in the disputatious context Meyer addressed is sufficient proof that there are no unambiguous texts. The contrary assertion is meaningless, since the goal is to overcome l;he difficulty that has caused all the divisions in Christendom the inability to agree on how to interpret scripture. A text can be called clear only when everybody agrees about what it means, for clarity is finally the product of consensus, not its cause. Consensus cannot be imposed by ritual repetition of the principle that scripture is "clear." Meyer's proposal philosophy the interpreter: Convinced that all the insoluble conflicts in Christendom are rooted in differences over interpre- tation of a scripture whose intrinsic ambiguities none of the Protestant parties acknowledged, Meyer proposed that Cartesian philosophy could in- tervene as the infallible arbiter and norm of interpretation. In an early Deist mode similar to Herbert of Cherbury,56 he argued that his rationalist point of view was the best hope for resolving the divisions in Christendom. In the present state of evidence, it is impossible to know whether Spinaza and Meyer were familiar with each other's views on the interpretation of the Bible before either of their works were published. Thus, we do not know, for example, whether Meyer presented his method in conscious opposition to Spinoza, or with the mistaken idea that they agreed. In any case, the very title of Meyer's book Philosophy the Interpreter of Scrip- ture makes its author a prime suspect for the role of "dogmatist" as Spinoza defined him. Attributing infallibility to philosophy, Meyer offered it as the s4Ibid., 3.7. s5Ibid. 56See my Explaining Religion: Criticism and Theory from Bodin to Freud (New Haven: Yale University Press, 1987) 24.</page><page sequence="18">378 HARVARD THEOLOGICAL REVIEW key to discovering the true intended meaning of any biblical passage. He believed that there is a match between reason's clear and distinct per- ceptions, the intentions of scripture, and truth, because both reason and scripture are inspired by the same divine mind creating a harmony between the two inspired entities. It is possible to argue that natural reason is en- dowed with "the same spirit" that inspired the biblical authors, but now "working differently," so that "philosophy is that aid by which the Holy Spirit interprets the scriptures in the present age."57 For Meyer, all truths and scientia ("knowledge") are found through rea- son and philosophy; in his most fundamental area of agreement with Spinoza, he generally not always consistently holds that the Bible is not an au- thoritative source of knowledge. Meyer did not claim, as Maimonides did, that the prophets intended to mask philosophical truths while they spoke the earthy and anthropomorphic "language of men" the doctrine of ac- commodation but rather held that one must bring clear and distinct philo- sophical perceptions from outside the text to elucidate the truths to which it obscurely prompts our attention. In defense of the necessity of philosophy, Meyer attacked theologians who persuaded themselves that all knowledge of theology comes from scripture alone, without consideration of other things; this has led people away from the study of philosophy and other valuable disciplines.58 For without these aids, no perfect knowledge (scientia) of a single thing can be learned from it [scripture], nor any clear and distinct idea be acquired. Nor indeed can any false and perverse [idea] be corrected by reading it [scripture] by itself. Moreover, all those who read the sacred books closely ought to have the same conceptions about the things that are dealt with in it.59 Since this does not happen under orthodox rules of interpretation, philoso- phy should be given a chance; to illustrate this point, Meyer gave as an 57Meyer Philosophia 15.94. Meyer's exposition is as confused as that of his Reformed opponents, for he asserted both that philosophy is divinely inspired and at the same time natural. The mind perceiving things clearly and distinctly cannot err because God is the fons et origo (font and origin) of all truth, and therefore will be the author and conservator of every true philosophy (5.42). Stated in pure Cartesian idiom, he said "Since no perception is clear and distinct which is not able to bring forth consciousness of itself inwardly in us, and since God is the cause of every clear and distinct perception, he will also be the cause of the inward consciousness, and since this persuades, tells, testifies, and inspires us that the thing perceived is indubitably true, therefore not undeservedly is [this clear perception] able to be called the persuasion, dictate, testimony, and inspiration of God or the Holy Spirit" (5.43). Thus, at the same time that Meyer denies the claim of the Reformed exegetes to special illumination, he appropriates it to valorize reason (see, for example, 16.105). 58Meyer Philosophia Epilogue 115-16. 59Ibid., 116.</page><page sequence="19">J. SAMUEL PREUS 379 example the statement that "God is omniscient" an inept example of bib- lical speech. Unless he or she knows beforehand what the terms "God" and "omniscience" entail, a person encountering such a statement will not be able to gain an intellectual understanding of the assertion.60 The mere words, "God is omniscient," are "not able to effect by true causality" the certainty and obviousness of the idea that omniscience belongs to the very nature of God, a philosophical conclusion that Meyer does not question. The words instead provide the "occasion or incitement by which the intellect is aroused and induced to contemplate more attentively the ideas of God and omni- science" until it grasps that the one idea is necessarily included in the other.6l Meyer believed that the highest utility of all books is that they inspire thought in the reader. The efficacy of books, however, depends entirely upon clear and distinct ideas that the reader already has, for in no way can they [books] lead the understanding into the true cogni- tion of things from or through themselves, much less provide, or in- fuse, or impress, or in any other way, engender clear and distinct ideas for the mind, unless they have been infused and indited there before- hand.62 Meyer wanted to assure his critics, nevertheless, that full knowledge of religious truth is not independent of the biblical text. He sought to preserve the complexity of the relationship between the text and the reader: Wherefore, in order that those things [concerning beatitude] might stand out clearly, philosophy is to be called upon for assistance, along with whatever else readers possess that is already known and perceived. In that way it will become evident how the predicate agrees with the subject, how the truth of the [scriptural] utterance is brought out, and at the same time how its true meaning (verus sensus) is elicited and drawn out.63 "From which it is clear," Meyer continued, "that when scripture is inter- preted through philosophy, [knowledge ofl the truth is not always bound to precede [knowledge ofl the [scriptural] meaning, and hence it is not at all superfluous to go to the scripture and reflect upon it."64 60Ibid., 114. 6lIbid., 114-15. 62Ibid., 115: nulla vero ratione intellectum in veram rerum cognitionem ex aut per se posse deducere; multo minus menti ideas claras distinctasque, si antea infusae, inditaeque non fuerint, indere, aut infundere, aut imprimere, aut alio aliquo modo ingenerare. 63Ibid., 115: Quod ut praestent, Philosophia, et quicquid jam cognitum atque perspectum habent, in subsidium vocandum, quo, qui praedictum subjecto conveniat, perspiciatur, enunciationis veritas eruatur, et simul verus sensus eliciatur atque educatur. 64Ibid.</page><page sequence="20">380 HARVARD THEOLOG ICAL REVI EW Spinoza's Response: Meyer's argument in the preceding section repre- sents the "confusion" of which Spinoza complained when philosophy and exegesis mix.65 Meyer fits Spinoza's dogmatist profile as an interpreter who maintains "that scripture should be accommodated to reason." The problem with such an interpreter, Spinoza charged, is that he will "ascribe to the prophets many ideas which they never even dreamed of, and falsely inter- pret their intention."66 He fails to understand, moreover, the categorical divide between biblical discourse and philosophy, a divide that makes transla- tion from one to the other, or harmonization, impossible. Failing to under- stand this, philosophical method allows "that we may explain the words of scripture according to our preconceived opinions, twisting them about, and reversing or completely changing the literal sense, however plain it may be."67 Spinoza's critique countered Meyer's a priori use of "clear and dis- tinct ideas."68 Spinoza argued uniquely among philosophers that scriptural texts are not amenable to philosophical analysis and clarification at all: "Those things which cannot be demonstrated, and which make up the greater part of scripture, cannot be examined by reason, and cannot therefore be explained or interpreted by this rule [that is, that philosophy is the interpreter of scripture]."69 Scripture is history, narrative, and poetry intellectual do- mains that elude Cartesian philosophical analysis.70 More profoundly, scripture's general view of the world and God is imaginary; to understand scriptural texts, it is necessary to interpret them within the biblical authors' own categories, especially their imaginative universals revelation, miracle, prophecy rather than our own, for the biblical categories are irreducible.71 Reason, furthermore, can derive no clear and distinct ideas from anthropo- morphic accounts in which events, even the most ordinary, are explained as 65Spinoza Tractatus 15.188 (ET 198). 66Ibid., 15. 1 80 (ET 190 [altered] ). 67Ibid., 7.115 (ET 117). 68Meyer is vulnerable to this charge because he granted a major role to preconceived ideas: "since the truths of all the meanings of scripture which are with the help of philosophy to be dug out and explored ought to be perceived before they are brought out." (Philosophia, Epi- logue 1 13; Cum enim omnium scripturae sensum, qui ope Philosophiae eruendi atque explorandi sunt, veritates ante, quam eruantur atque explorentur, perspectae esse debeant). 69Spinoza Tractatus 7. 1 1 5 (ET 11 7) . 70Malet (Le traite, 1 16) recognizes this. 7lThe inability of reason to understand scripture is not, as Strauss contended (Spinoza's Critique, 174-75), due primarily to the presence of supernatural references that Spinoza did not believe, but for much broader reasons. In the felicitous coinage of Vico (Spinoza's best interpreter, along with Richard Simon, in the early modern period), ancient authors explained the world through "poetic universals," not those of philosophy (see my "Spinoza, Vico and the Imagination of Religion" JHI 50 [1989] 71-93).</page><page sequence="21">J. SAMUEL PREUS 381 direct effects of the divine will, a point made by Maimonides as well as Spinoza. Spinoza explained this point as follows: great caution is necessary not to confound the mind of a prophet or histonan with the mind of the Holy Spint and the truth of the matter.... I would. . . here remark on the meaning (sensum) of revelation, that the present method [that is, my own] teaches us to investigate only what the prophets saw or heard, not what they wanted to signify or represent with these hieroglyphics; for about this we can guess, but not with certainty deduce, drawing on the fundamentals of scripture.72 Since Spinoza's method, on the other hand, explained scripture accord- ing to its own manner of thought, he understood these matters "simply by means of the context of the utterances."73 Above all, Spinoza argued, it is necessary to examine each scriptural text "solely by its own use of lan- guage, or by a reasoning that acknowledges no foundation but scripture."74 Against Meyer's resort to a priori clear and distinct ideas and principles, Spinoza argued the principles of his method as follows: . . . for interpretation of Scripture it is necessary to furnish its genuine history, and from that, as from certain data and principles, to infer the intention [mens] of its authors as legitimate conclusions. By working in this manner everyone will always advance without danger of error- that is, if they admit no principles for interpreting Scripture, and deal- ing with its contents, save such as they find in Scripture itself and its history.75 This is Spinoza's new historical and critical version of the Protestant "scrip- ture principle": scripture, not philosophy, "is its own interpreter." Interpre- tation is based only on scripture's own history and narrative, while reason, 72Spinoza Tractatus 7.105 (ET 106 [altered]). 73Ibid., 7.115 (ET 117 [altered]). 74Ibid. 7.100 (ET 101 [altered]); sed ne verum sensum cum rerum veritate confundamus, ille ex solo linguae usu erit investigandus, vel ex ratiocinio, quod nullum aliud fundamentum agnoscit, quam Scripturam. 75Ibid., 7.98 (ET 99 [altered]); sic etiam ad Scripturam interpretandam necesse est ejus sinceram historiam adornare, et ex ea tanquam ex certis datis et principiis mentem authorum Scripturae legitimis consequentiis concludere: sic enim unusquisque (si nimirum nulla alia principia, neque data ad interpretandam Scripturam &amp; de rebus, quae in eadem continentur, disserendum, admiserit, nisi ea tantummodo, quae ex ipsa Scriptura ejusque historia depromuntur) sine ullo periculo errandi semper procedet.

W Meaning and Truth In an earlier essay, I maintained that the key to understanding Spinoza's innovation, and indeed the very foundation of critical biblical study, rests on Spinoza's first rule for exegetes: "we are at work here only on the meaning (sensus) of utterances, not their truth (veritas)."76 Only later, upon reading Meyer, did I discover that Spinoza was not the first to formulate this distinction in print. Meyer had already done so in the Philosophy. He did not make of it what Spinoza did a difference of paradigmatic magni- tude in the history of exegesis. Meyer on Meaning and Truth: The relevant starting point of Meyer's discussion is the unoriginal distinction between the plain, or apparent, sense and the true, or intended, sense.77 The distinction is necessary because the plain or apparent sense is not always what the author intended; only that can stand as the true sense. That [both ofl these senses occur in utterances is evident from the fact that the sense that the words of a sentence display in their common and vulgar use is not necessarily the sense which the author had in his mind while he was writing or pronouncing these words in the course of interpreting his mind.78 Meyer sometimes referred to this distinction as one between the "outer" and "inner" meaning of the biblical text, terminology that Maimonides used as well.79 Within this framework, there is the further possibility that the writer may have intended more than one meaning,80 although theologians disagreed about this: Protestants, for example, insisted on one meaning, 76Spinoza Tractatus 7.100 (ET lOl [altered]); De solo enim sensu orationum, non autem de earum veritate laboramus. See my "Spinoza, Vico," especially 74-76. In Spinoza's view, failure to observe this distinction was the common fault of both the dogmatists and the skep- tics that is, the entire exegetical tradition, both Jewish and Christian. 77Meyer Philosophia 3.8; sensus simpliciter sic dictus, sensus verus. 78Ibid., 3.8; Hos autem sensus in orationibus occurrere, ex eo apertum est, quod non illico is, quem vocabula sententiae, prout communiter et vulgo sonant, prae se ferunt, sensus sit, quem, dum interpretandae mentis gratia ista vocabula exarabat aut pronunciabat, in animo habuit author. Meyer pointed out that Augustine had already made this distinction in Confes- sions 12.23 and identified theological mistakes that arise from failure to observe it: the Roman Catholics, for example, mistook the plain sense of "This is my body" for the true sense, because it is the "clear and perspicuous" one. The Reformers, however, held that this is not the true sense that Christ intended. Here is a case where the true sense is not clear, but obscure (3.9). 79See, for example, Meyer Philosophia 2.4; Maimonides, Guide 2.30, 353. 80Meyer Philosophia 3.30.</page><page sequence="23">J.

Meyer himself did not see why a writer might not at times intend several meanings, and argued that in such cases several meanings must be assigned to the literal sense of a text.8l This solution clears the way for the harder problem: inevitably, the in- terpreter faces the question of whether the "true, author-intended sense" (or senses) of any text is also the truth. "The meaning according to which a sentence is true to us," Meyer warned, "is not to be confused with that true sense by which a sentence asserts something true"-the distinction between verus sensus nobis (true meaning to us) and verus sensus ad res (meaning true to the thing), that is, the sense that corresponds to extramental reali- ties.82 Following a long and pedantic disquisition, Meyer finally formulated a clear statement of the interpreter's task: It is evident that the true interpreter ought not to be as concerned with the truth (veritas) or falsity of the utterance to be interpreted as with its true or false meaning (sensus) [so far, Spinoza exactly]. And it must be conceded that those who investigate and indicate this meaning by refuting the false sense and confirming the true one, [that is,] by confirming its conformity with the mind of the writer even when this meaning disagrees with right reason and is repugnant to the truth- [that such an interpreter] will have fully satisfied his office and ful- filled all its parts.83 Meyer has already formulated the master distinction of Spinoza's exegetical procedure, between the author or speaker's intention and the truth or falsity of his or her words. But Meyer then immediately retreated by exempting scripture and making the distinction apply only to the interpretation of profane literature.84 As a result, his method did not break with the dog- matic or skeptical exegetical tradition that said that with scripture the true 81Ibid., 3.8. 82Ibid., 3.8. 83Ibid., 4.33; Unde patet verum interpretem non tam sollicitum esse debere de Orationis interpretandae veritate aut falsitate, quam vero aut falso sensu: eosque qui investigaverit atque indicaverit, hunc redarguendo, illum vero confirmando, hoc est, Scriptoris intellectui conformem comprobando, quantumvis etiam rectae rationi dissentaneum, ac veritati repugnantem, suo tamen muneri abunde satisfecisse, omnesque illius partes implevisse censendus est. Thus, according to Meyer, three things must be considered in approaching any text: its plain mean- ing, its intended meaning, and its truth (sensus simpliciter sic dictus, sensus verus, veritas; 3.8). 84The practice of exempting the Bible in the analysis of ancient texts and religions is followed by all of Spinoza's contemporaries, as well as by Bernard Fontenelle and Giambattista Vico. Both exempted biblical religion from their theories of religion. See my Explaining Religion, 40-83.</page><page sequence="24">384 HARVARD THEOLOGICAL REVIEW meaning and the truth are one, since scripture cannot convey any untruth.85 For Meyer, the true, intended meaning of every biblical text must also be truth, since in scripture "truths and true meanings are everywhere joined with an indissoluble link (veritates et veros sensus indissolubili nexu ubique copulari), which does not obtain" with profane writings.86 Spinoza's Response: Against the background of Meyer's attack on the Protestant scriptural principle, it is clear how Spinoza's assault on Maimoni- des targeted Meyer. When he examined the opinion of Maimonides "very closely," Spinoza argued that he alleged that the sense of scripture cannot be made plain from scripture itelf, for the truth of things (rerum veritas) is not made plain therein. . . therefore, according to Maimonides, the true meaning (verus sensus) of scripture cannot be made plain from itself, and must not be sought from there.87 This is not an unfair representation of Maimonides except that Maimonides never expressly stated that scripture cannot be interpreted "from itself." That is part of the discourse of Spinoza's Christian contemporaries of the post-Reformation era, not of Maimonides. Spinoza's remark, however, per- fectly described Meyer and his terminology.88 Spinoza was especially vehement in resisting Meyer's central idea that truth is the criterion for determining the meaning of a scriptural text. He contradicted Meyer and the whole tradition of biblical interpretation by insisting that consideration of the truth of a scriptural statement must not intrude into the determination of its meaning. Instead, Spinoza used the distinction in order to remove the question of truth from the question of meaning, limiting the search to meanings the ancient writers could have had in mind. According to Spinoza, scripture may say something that is not true, or contradict itself, but may really "mean" it; it is only after meaning is established that the truth question can be entertained.89 "Maimonides," therefore, has it backwards when, according to Spinoza, he asserts that: 85Meyer Philosophia 4.34. 86Ibid., 4.33 . 87Spinoza Tractatus 7. 1 1 S (ET 1 17 [altered] ). 88The following examples show the congruence between Spinoza's remarks and the lan- guage of Meyer: Meyer said that "scripture is not the norm for interpreting itself' (Philosophia 10.68; scripturam non esse normam seipsam interpretandi). In Philosophia 11.74, he said that its sense is not clear through itself (nullus etiam locus erit per se clarus). Meyer interpreted 2 Pet 1:20 to mean that no prophecy of scripture should be interpreted through itself: nullam Prophetiam Scripturae, aut (si per Prophetiam Scripturae, ipsa Scriptura intelligatur) Scripturam, esse per seipsam, aut a Prophetis interpretandam (Philosophia 12.81). 89See, for example, Spinoza Tractatus 15.182 (ET 191 [altered]): "after [postquam] we have elicited the true meaning, we must of necessity make use of our judgment and reason."</page><page sequence="25">J. SAMUEL PREUS 385 we could never be certain of any particular meaning till we knew that the passage, as we interpreted it, contained nothing contrary or repug- nant to reason. If the literal meaning clashes with reason, though the passage seems in itself perfectly clear, it must be interpreted in some other sense.90 Quoting Maimonides9l regarding the philosophical argument about the eter- nity of the world, Spinoza commented: He could not be certain about the true meaning (de vero sensu), how- ever clear, as long as he could doubt about the truth of the thing (de rei veritate), or as long as the matter was not decided. For as long as it is not decided concerning the truth of the thing, just so long we are ignorant whether the thing agrees with reason, or whether it is repug- nant to it. Consequently also, for just so long we also do not know whether the literal sense is true or false [and therefore which texts to take literally].92 In other words, judgment about the meaning of relevant biblical texts has to await the results of the philosophical argument about whether the world is eternal or not. The correspondence with Meyer's language is very clear here: truth determines meaning.93 The real Maimonides rejected the eternity doctrine because "it destroys the law at its foundation."94 Meyer, for his part, accepted the eternity 90Ibid., 7.113 (ET 115 [altered]). Meyer wrote: "we insist that true philosophy is the Lydian stone, by which it must be infallibly weighed, and through which most certainly demonstrated, whether some sense of sacred scripture, whether understood with no trouble or dug out with great difficulty, agrees with the intention of the writer, or rather disagrees with it" (Philosophia 16.103). Meyer repeatedly asserted that every biblical passage can have more than one intended meaning; see, for example, Philosophia 3.8, 10, 30, 31; 4.34, 36 (such is the power of God's word, that from a single utterance the hearer/reader is able to draw several truths), 38; Epilogue 109. 91Maimonides, Guide 2. 25, 327-28. 92Spinoza Tractatus 7.114 (ET 115- 16 [altered] ) . 93See Philosophia 4.33, where Meyer explained that scripture, unlike profane writings, can mean nothing but truth in any instance, since "truths and true meanings are everywhere linked with an indissoluble link, which does not obtain in the former case [that is, with profane writings]. And thus the interpreter who draws out those truths, will also have dug out the true meanings by the same operation" (veritates et veros sensus indissolubili nexu ubique copulari, quod in illis non obtinet; atque adeo qui illas eruerit, eadem opera simul et hos eruisse). Thus, in the case of the eucharistic words of consecration, philosophy determines the meaning of Christ's words, and with its help Reformed theologians "have demonstrated from physics that bread, when its accidents are preserved and remain, cannot be transubstantiated" (Philosophia 6.47: a markedly pre-Cartesian argument). 94This part of the quotation from Guide 2. 25, 328 omitted in Elwes's translation, is an indication that as Spinoza reads him there is a "skeptic" element in Maimonides that is missing in Meyer. Menasseh ben Israel, Spinoza's contemporary and teacher, also thought of Maimonides as a creationist; see Mechoulan, "Introduction," 30-31. Por a powerful contrary</page><page sequence="26">386 HARVARD THEOLOGICAL REVIEW doctrine, because scripture does not anywhere specifically deny it, except in the Apocrypha, which do not have authority.95 Furthermore, Meyer thought that the eternity doctrine had been demonstrated philosophically. In the guise of accusing Maimonides, Spinoza criticized Meyer's position on this issue: If he had been convinced by reason that the world is eternal, he would not have hesitated to twist and explain away the words of scripture till he made them appear to teach this doctrine. He would have felt quite sure that scripture, though everywhere plainly denying the eternity of the world, really intends to teach it.96 Maimonides in the subjunctive mood here masks Meyer in the indicative: convinced that the world is eternal, he proceeds to interpret Gen 1:1 accord- ing to his philosophical conviction.97 The eternity thesis is "a principle known through itself, and among common notions"; therefore, unless the theologians can "demonstrate that that axiom is theologically false, it re- mains true and indubitable in theology as in philosophy."98 Again, Spinoza's comment, although fitting Maimonides, more immediately rejected Meyer's opinion, arguing that the question of philosophical truth must be set aside until after determining what Gen 1:1 or any other passage means when interpreted by historical method. g Enthusiasm, Esotericism, and Their Consequences The thrust of Spinoza's further criticism is wholly inapplicable to Maimon- ides, or any Jewish interpreter, for that matter. Spinoza made the most insulting charge he could against a Christian opponent: he accused him of stepping over the line from philosophy to Enthusiasm (namely, the claim to immediate divine inspiration). Proof of this lies in the manner in which Meyer supported his claim for the infallibility of the philosophical crite- rion. If this philosophical method of interpretation is the proper one, Spinoza remarks caustically, he would have to concede that "some faculty beyond argument that Maimonides actually agreed with Aristotle's opinion, see Warren Zev Harvey, "A Third Approach to Maimonides' Cosmogony-Prophetology Puzzle," HTR 74:3 ( 1981 ) 287- 301. 95Meyer Philosophia 8.59. 96Spinoza Tractatus 7.114 (ET 115). 97Maimonides had done the same thing. His nonliteral interpretation of Gen 1:1 (Guide 2. 30, 348) is thoroughly "dogmatic": each verse is painstakingly interpreted via the latest sci- entific theory. Maimonides commented on one verse that "its external meaning is exceedingly incongruous, but in it. . . you will admire the wisdom of the parables and their correspondence to what exists." 98Meyer Philosophia 8.59.</page><page sequence="27">J. SAMUEL PREUS 387 the natural reason" is required for interpreting scripture, since most of what scripture tells us cannot be deduced from things known by natural reason.99 This line of criticism has nothing to do with Maimonides, who made no claim of supernatural assistance for the interpreter. It is aimed at Meyer, who enlisted the Holy Spirit to support the infallibility of natural reason, and so made himself vulnerable to the charge of Enthusiasm.l°° In chapter 15 of the Tractatus, Spinoza concluded his discussion with the philosophers, insisting "absolutely that scripture is not to be accommo- dated to reason, nor reason to scripture,''l°l but that each is sovereign in its own domain. He expressed the hope that he had cut through "the extraor- dinary confusion which has followed from men confounding these two faculties in astonishing ways, not knowing how to distinguish and keep one apart from the other.''l02 Meyer must have taken this as Spinoza's summary rebuttal to all his efforts. In closing, it is important to stress that Spinoza wrote a theological- political treatise, and that his critique of Maimonides exposed the political implication of the philosopher's elitist stance. In Spinoza's real-life context, however, the political consequences of Maimonides' hermeneutic were not of concern to anyone. The implications of Meyer's hermeneutic were, how- ever, important for contemporary readers, and for those looking at the linked edition of the two contemporary works, Spinoza's criticism would gain urgency, for the truth of this theory would involve that the common person, having generally no comprehension of, nor leisure for, detailed proofs, would be reduced to receiving all his knowledge of scripture on the authority and testimony of philosophizers (philosophantes) and, consequently, would be compelled to suppose that philosophers were infallible (non posse errare) in the interpretation of scripture. The result of this, Spinoza continues, would be "a new form of ecclesias- tical authority, and a new sort of priests or pontiffs.''l03 Is Spinoza's concern really for the common person or is he only plead- ing for the intellectual liberty of philosophers? His concern is clearly for both, since he insisted on construing the meanings of scripture according to 99Spinoza Tractatus 7.117 (ET 1 16). 100Spinoza is not the first critic of Meyer to level this charge: Velthuysen makes the same accusation in De usu rationis 116. I plan to include his work in a later study. This feature of Meyer's thought suggests close association with the thinking of the Collegiants: see Fix, Prophecy and Reason, 162, and idem, "Radical Religion," 52-53.

This concern is rel- evant in light of Meyer's argument that such a procedure is only a source of error.104 Spinoza answered that the Bible is written so that its true sense (verus sensus), regarding its essential content, is certain, since it generally means what it says: "the precepts of true piety are expressed in the most ordinary language, and are equally simple and easily understood.''l05 The uneducated Israelites and Gentiles to whom the prophets and apostles first spoke understood the "language, and, consequently, the intention (mens) of the prophet or apostle addressing them," even though they did not philo- sophically grasp the reasons and causes of things.106 The same is true now. Spinoza boasted that his method needs no "interpreters." The people "of our own time" can grasp the message of scripture, "because it is thoroughly ordinary and usual; it is in such understanding as this that the masses acquiesce, not in the testimony of interpreters (interpretum).''l07 Interpreta- tion "ought not to be so difficult that it can be applied only by the most skillful philosophers, but should be adapted to the natural and ordinary faculties and capacity of mankind.''108 Spinoza's scripture harbors no mys- teries, only problems, and these are problems of its language and history, not of philosophy.109 104According to Maimonides, when "the Torah speaks the language of men," simple people understand it, but they do not understand its true, intended sense (Guide 1.33, 71).
