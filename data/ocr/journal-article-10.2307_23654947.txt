What are the trajectories amenable to these kinds of translations, exchanges and mixing? How are they contested in turn and why? What do they index about inter-faith relations, and contemporary religious sensibili ties in Malaysia? Keywords hybridity, pilgrimage, Roman Catholicism, Malaysia Introduction In an earlier publication (Yeoh, 2006), I had mapped ethnographically the zones of trans-religious interactions at the famed Roman Catholic pilgrimage shrine of St. Anne situated in the thriving northern Malaysian market town of Bukit Mertajam.' Theoretically, I drew from Eade and Sallnow's (1991) lead in elucidating how pilgrimage practices can also fruitfully be characterised as "mis-recognitions," in contrast to Victor and Edith Turners (1978) influential thesis of the anti-structural communitas nature of pilgrimage experiences in temporarily dissolving societal hierarchies into communitarian sameness.2 I argued that these trans-cultural translations of sacred power perceived to be tangibly located at the shrine and in the particular entity of the matriarchal 1 Fieidwork was first conducted between November 1997 and August 1998 primarily in the localities of Bukit Mertajam and Georgetown (Penang) with a grant from an Evans Postdoctoral Fellowship awarded by the Department of Social Anthropology, University of Cambridge. Short follow-up visits to the shrine were made in July 2001 and July 2002. 2 This theoretical perspective resonates with Pierre Bourdieu's influential work (1990) on the intertwining relationship between structure and agency. © Koninklijke Brill NV, Leiden, 2009 DOI: 10.1163/156853109X385376</page><page sequence="2">8 S. G. Yeoh / Asian Journal of Social Science 37 (2009) 7—28 saint account for the pluralistic presence of pilgrims from different religious traditions during the Feast held in late July. Whilst firmly embedded within their respective orientations towards the sacred, pilgrims "misrecognise" St. Anne's relational powers and her perceived personas of fertility, longevity, dependability, accessibility and filial connectedness. She is read and vested with subjectivities through their own religious and cultural habitus or stand points. In this essay, I re-visit these "misrecognitions" to examine more closely the kinds of epistemological dilemmas and contesting discourses that sur round perceived "syncretistic" pilgrim ritual practices during the Feast of St. Anne. I then pose to them larger questions of what these conundrums say about the sensibilities of contemporary religious landscapes in Malaysia. As intimated earlier, I deploy the analytical category of "syncretism" advis edly, aware of the theoretical challenges that have assailed it in recent years {interalia Stewart and Shaw, 1994; Greenfield and Droogers, 2001). Further more, I do not employ more currently fashionable terms like "hybridity" and "creolisation" in a celebratory fashion. I take heed of scholars who counsel for a more processual understanding of these categories as they pertain to wider social, political and theoretical agendas (e.g., Werbner and Modood, 1997). Moreover, I distinguish also between religious world-views as a historically evolving phenomenon periodically codified into doctrinal formulations by the religious intelligentsia and the eclectic quotidian devotional practices not always straitjacketed by these orthodoxies. Both, nevertheless, are contin uously shaped by uneven historical exigencies and differential scalar trajecto ries. Contemporary elitist religious discourses of "purity/impurity" may thus belie more protracted and contested histories stretching over decades if not centuries. In the case of post-colonial societies, the particular configuration of syn cretic religious practices are further inflected by the nature of the religious institutions' complicity with conquering empires, the degree of porosity in everyday inter-ethnic encounters, the deployment of religious idioms in anti colonial resistance struggles, influences by religious reformist movements from the metropolitan centre, and so forth. In the particular case of missionary (and transnational) Christianity, some of these afore-mentioned themes have informed a number of studies on the changing fortunes of Christian missions in the Southeast Asian geographical region (interalia, David, 1988; Ileto, 1992; England, 1996; Keyes, 1996; Koshy, 2004). Despite being statistically a minority religion in most countries in the region (with the exception of the Philippines), institutional Christianity arguably exerts an influence dispropor tionate to its numbers because of its missionary convictions, organisational strength and transnational connections.</page><page sequence="3">S. G. Yeoh / Asian Journal of Social Science 37 (2009) 7-28 9 In poly-religious Malaysia, Roman Catholicism accounts for the most num ber of converts (about 50 percent) and also represents the oldest surviving institution (since the 16th Century) among the diverse clusters of Christian groups that have reached its shores. However, its significance pales in com parison to the degree and extent of "enculturation" and demographic reach amongst the "natives" evident in neighbouring countries like the Philippines and, to a lesser extent, Vietnam. These differences in religious landscapes are attributable to the specific historical circumstances of the entry of European colonialism into the country. With valuable experiences of ruling and manag ing overseas colonies elsewhere (particularly British India), British administra tors were more sanguine in the manner in which they progressively acquired the "Malay States" for a range of commercial enterprises beginning in the lat ter part of the 19th Century. Missionaries were also enjoined to focus their attentions on the new migrant groups of mainly Chinese and Indians who arrived in successive waves to the peninsula. Part of this legacy is now enshrined constitutionally. Not only is Islam ascribed as the religion of the postcolonial Federation [Article 3(1)] but any missionary activity among Muslims is for bidden [Article 11(4)].3 These same historical exigencies have also meant that over time, an ethnic-based and elite consociational political system premised on the "special position" of Malay-Muslims and further animated by revival ist/rationalist Islam, has plotted out a plural ethno-religious landscape strongly inflected by identity politics (e.g., Ackerman and Lee, 1988). Moreover, with the significant demographic increase of an urbane class of Malay-Muslims, largely catalysed through the canopy of affirmative action state policies over the past three decades, strong interventionist trends in managing Muslim moralities and religiosities through extensive policing and punitive powers enabled by Islamic Shari'a laws have been discernible. These disciplinary and legalist endeavours have detrimentally spilled beyond an expanding statist Muslim-defined boundary into the everyday life-worlds of non-Muslims (e.g., Martinez, 2004; Yeoh, 2005; Willford, 2006). Juxtaposed to these fraught relationships is another bundle of activities pri marily socially engineered to build up a stock of trans-ethnic cohesion and social capital themed on the unifying and celebratory notion of a localised rendition of magical "multi-culturalism."4 For instance, during the official commemorations of the major festivals of Buddhism, Christianity, Hinduism, 3 Although "other religions may be practiced in peace and harmony in any part of the Fed eration" as well. * Epitomised through the current popularised localising slogans of "Bangsa Malaysia" (Malay sian Race) and "Malaysia, Truly Asia."</page><page sequence="4">10 S. G. Yeoh /Asian Journal of Social Science 37 (2009) 7—28 Islam and, more recently, the harvest festivals of the indigenous peoples of Sabah and Sarawak, widely publicised state-organised "open houses" hosted by key political leaders have become one of the enduring "images of integra tion" signifying race relations and cultural diversity in Malaysia (Lee, 2004). Indeed, these statist attempts at imagining a cohesive multicultural citizenry unfettered by divisive ethnic and religious differences resonates with a stock of less conspicuous and quotidian boundary-crossing entrepreneurial activities anchored in a number of markers like language, cuisine, clothing, entertain ment, and so forth. In the realm of religion, the daily vicissitudes and uncer tainties of human existence, coupled with the perennial quest for psychological well-being and material prosperity, in addition to decades of familiarity, have occasionally translated into a spectrum of respectful recognition (explicit and tacit) of deities and symbols usually associated with various ethno-religious groups. For instance, in downtown Georgetown, Penang, it is commonplace to see significant numbers of Chinese shopkeepers residing along the proces sional route participating in the annual celebration of Hindu festival of Thaipusam by breaking coconuts and offering archanai (ritual gifts) to the deity, Lord Murugan (e.g., Collins, 1997). On a less conspicuous note, I have also chanced across images of the rotund Laughing Buddha of Prosperity, the white-clad Goddess of Mercy and various religious paraphernalia (like Chi nese joss-sticks, pa-kua and so forth) occasionally appearing in a number of Hindu businesses and domestic shrines in the course of my fieldwork, particu larly in squatter settlements, in Kuala Lumpur throughout the years.5 More recently, there appears to be a receptive urban market for the aniconic geo mantic and astrological sciences of Chinese feng-shui and Hindu vastu shastra as indexed by media output and informal conversations with a range of ordi nary people of various faiths.6 In other cases, religious appropriations have been unintentionally aided by the purifying agenda of Islamic reformism and radical urban development. Malay local guardian spirits called keramat have been increasingly taken over by Chinese worshippers even as they are wilfully neglected by Malay-Muslims (e.g., Cheu, 1996). In particular, these localised entities continue to be placated and accorded hospitality through ritual offer ings before Chinese developers begin clearing jungle or chopping down of old trees to make way for human structures with the hope of averting delays or disasters (e.g., Goh, 2005). This essay, however, does not specifically dwell on these generic kinds of shared cosmologies and trans-cultural borrowings. Instead, I examine how 5 This phenomenon also extends to the dashboards of taxis driven by ethnic Indians and Chinese. 6 Apart from book publications, regular columns on these two ancient "sciences" have been appearing more regularly in mainstream English newspapers in Malaysia.</page><page sequence="5">S. G. Yeoh / Asian Journal of Social Science 37 (2009) 7-28 11 some of these themes are played out in a particularly circumscribed sacred space. Although constituted formally as a Roman Catholic pilgrimage shrine, the Church of St. Anne has increasingly become known for its draw of a diverse religious spectrum of pilgrims, spectacularly evident during the Feast of St. Anne. In the ensuing discussion, I attend to the historical, spatial and contextual logics of religious (anti-)hybridity. The Production of Religious Localities At the end of the 18th Century, under the protective canopy of British com mercialism, newly arrived migrant Chinese (primarily speaking the Hakka, Hokkien, and Teochew dialects) ventured beyond the Prince of Wales Island7 (claimed by Francis Light in 1786) for the mainland to clear jungles and swamps for cash crop and food farming (Tan, 1981). Later, in the early decades of the 20th Century, as the British expanded railway and road transportation networks along the western corridor of peninsular Malaysia, the strategic loca tion of Bukit Mertajam was transformed into a thriving "junction market town" (Nonini, 1983). Agricultural produce and manufactured goods were channelled in from other parts of the region (and even from further afar, like Thailand and Sumatra) re-packed and re-distributed to other parts of the country through an army of lorry transport companies. Entrepreneurs (includ ing some Chinese Triads or "secret societies") also took advantage of its strate gic position to set up a range of "cottage industries" producing and/or distributing a range of clothing, household, imitation and contraband goods. Strong interpersonal networks of reciprocity were an integral aspect of these commercial enterprises. Although its dubious reputation as a "black market town" par excellence has diminished over the years, its mythos is aptly encapsu lated in a reference jokingly offered by one of my key informants to character ise the town — the "Chicago of Malaysia" — and that "BM people can imitate anything!"8 Not long after the founding of Bukit Mertajam, Reverend Father Adolphe Couellan (d. 1859), a French priest of the Missions Etrangères De Paris (Paris Foreign Missionary Society), had decided to build a chapel outpost near to the fledgling settlement to gather them up his peripatetic flock for regular wor ship. He dedicated the chapel to St. Anne, the patron saint of his home prov ince of Brittany in France. Later, with more converts and ecclesiastical support forthcoming, a bigger more permanent neo-Gothic church together with an 7 The former British colonial name for Pulau Pinang (Penang Island). 8 Following academic convention, all names and distinguishing markers have been changed to protect the interviewees' privacy.

For many pilgrims, especially non-Roman Catholics, the foci of attention continue to be the "Old Church" and on the slopes of a hillock where the dyadic statues of St. Anne and her pubescent daughter, Mary (and eventual mother of Jesus of Nazareth) replace the ruins of the original chapel outpost.

G. Yeoh / Asian Journal of Social Science 37 (2009) 7-28 13 decades the famed efficacy of the shrine has been circulated by a more low keyed, amoebic, and growing stock of oral stories attesting to the miraculous interventions of the saint, especially in matters pertaining to familial crises, the vicissitudes of everyday life, and important rites-of-passage. Both kinds of enterprise, including the new added attraction of an impressive monumental church structure, will no doubt continue to draw in a wide spectrum of visi tors to the shrine, promoting indirectly to a spectacle of magical religious pluralism and multiculturalism championed by national political leaders. However, recollections by some of my elderly informants hint that there is a more chequered history to the shrines spiritual magnetic powers. In the distant past, pilgrims were drawn mainly from surrounding small towns and plantations on the mainland, and from nearby Penang Island. Reflecting the milieu of the period, elderly pilgrims recollect that it was not unusual to see prestations, or gifts, for the saint in the form of agricultural produce (like coconuts, bananas, cockerels) rather than the current hegemonic medium of spiritual exchange, money. Although the crowds were reportedly "big," they did not number in the hundreds of thousands who now flock to the shrine during the Feast of St. Anne in July. The single most obvious reason for this is logistical — in the past, the shrine was not easily accessible by public transportation. Situated about a mile outside of Bukit Mertajam" town cen tre, the usual route for the pilgrim would be to traverse by foot (or, less com monly, by private car) along a narrow road flanked by jungle and plantation before reaching the shrine after arriving by train or bus to the town. Although much improved transportation and the suburban sprawl of Bukit Mertajam town have considerably diminished these elements, the mystique of a remote and forested shrine continue to figure prominently in an older stock of pilgrim narratives. Indeed, present day pilgrims especially from the cities are still able to appreciate the natural setting of the shrine — an elevated white building backed by a prominent forested hill visible for miles around. In many cases, as I have suggested in my earlier article (Yeoh, 2006), these hierophantic ele ments provide convenient meeting points or cultural horizons for articulating different trans-religious readings and practices. I have not been able to ascertain definitively why the shrine was not origi nally sited within the fledgling settlement of Bukit Mertajam.12 Physical conditions were undoubtedly difficult for both pioneering Chinese farmers pbase.com/kelvin_khor/stanne; http://frozenfate.blogspot.com/2007/01/st-anne-sanctuary-bukit mertajam.html.

They faced not only the ravages ol tropical dis eases, like malaria and dengue fever, but also marauding tigers, wild boars and elephants. However, 1 suspect that perhaps the latter also had to contend with a host of comparatively more established (and perhaps antagonistic) Chinese temples and an array of clan associations formed earlier in Bukit Mertajam. Whether by design or by historical accident, the shrine's location today has become an asset in terms of sacred geography. Discerning Chinese pilgrims sometimes speak of the shrine as auspiciously sited in terms of feng-shuiP Other kinds of pilgrims not conversant with this specific reading of a landscape, nevertheless, were able to generically describe the bucolic environs of the shrine as "beautiful" and inducing a sense of "peacefulness" in them. Figure 2: King of Hades in the Tua Pek Ao«g Temple IVM In addition to the more widely known Feast of St. Anne drawing in pilgrims from near and far, the town also boasts of two other major local religious fes tivals which are well reported in the Chinese and Tamil vernacular press. In the eighth lunar month of the Chinese calendar during the "Hungry Ghosts" festival, the town's oldest temple dedicated to the patron deity, Tua Pek Kong, 13 A key informant hinted that even the present new church continues to be auspiciously sited because of a keen attention to its spatial orientation during the early stages of its planning.</page><page sequence="9">S. G. Yeoh / Asian Journal of Social Science 37 (2009) 7—28 15 has for some time distinguished itself by building the tallest opulent-looking papier-mâché King of Hades in the country (see Figure 2). Legions of anony mous "wandering souls" that are believed to descend onto the town are con spicuously fêted by abundant food (raw and cooked) placed in open spaces (particularly in front of the temple and at railway and road junctions) supplied by a range of individuals, guilds and associations. The closure of the festival is signalled by the King of Hades being ushered back to the underworld through a large bonfire on a public road in the centre of town. Well attended and robustly participated in by town residents, this event tangibly articulates memories of the precarious pioneering past to the prosperous present. It would not be too difficult to read the event through Durkheimian lens as an oppor tune moment to assert a communal Chinese identity over a religiously diverse locality as few local "outsiders" can articulate meaningfully with the logic of the festival (cf. DeBernardi, 2004). Similarly, the town's major Hindu temple has an institutionalised annual festival in honour of the goddess Mariyamman. The temple was built to cater to Tamil labourers originally recruited by the British to work on the railways and other public services (e.g., general hospital and public works) of the town. A key element of the festival, attended by large crowds of devotees and curious onlookers, involves a public "fire-walking" ceremony and a boisterous wooden chariot procession bearing the deity around the key thoroughfares of the town.14 Arguably, it is during these visibly public occasions that the religious het erogeneity of the locality becomes particularly salient, as the respective world views and cultural horizons of local "outsiders" are de-centred. Even for those who are oblivious to the religious significance of these events, the disruption to the free flow of vehicular traffic and other daily routines requires a sense of tolerance, if not acceptance, of religious plurality. By this token, the Feast of St. Anne poses a particular kind of problématique to town residents and shrine custodians alike given the volume and diversity of its crowds that the event generates in comparison to other religious festivals in the locality. A Forest of Symbols15 In my conversations and interviews with an array of pilgrims and shrine cus todians, I was particularly impressed with the variety of narratives offered to account for the mixed crowds and hybrid devotional practices at the shrine. 14 A temple committee member characterised the celebration in the following terms: "This is the only chariot procession in Southeast Asia where it is pulled by between 300 to 400 people!" 15 This phrase is taken from Victor and Edith Turners book by the same title.</page><page sequence="10">16 S. G. Yeoh /Asian Journal of Social Science 37 (2009) 7—28 Moreover, whilst pilgrims might be cursorily united in their quest for seeking consolation, help and favours from St. Anne, the manner in which these requests were conveyed were differently framed. Non-Roman Catholic pil grims, for instance, read both the saint and the landscape through their own respective religious horizons and cultural habitus, and approached both these entities accordingly (Yeoh, 2006). Many also refrained from encapsulating the sacred through critical talk, and described the phenomenon as a "mystery" defying human explanation. Even for many Roman Catholic pilgrims, abstract theological conundrums were usually side-stepped, and the responsiveness of St. Anne to prayers for help was simply attributed to her being a very sympathetic grandmother to a filial and powerful grandson, Jesus Christ. Although her efficacy is formally linked to her intermediary (and gendered) role rather than to any inherent powers that she might possess, hagiographie pamphlets distributed at the shrine do not always make this explicitly clear to the uninitiated: St. Anne's fame is because she is a family-oriented saint. She is the saint of one who oversees family happiness just as St. Antony is the saint for lost things. Devotees pray to St. Anne for good life, partners and children. Success in business and examinations are also common requests.16 For a vocal minority, however, the religious event spectacularly epitomises an undesirable "mixing" of incommensurately different religious traditions. As 1 will suggest, this charge was particularly strident because of the ambivalent pre-history of the shrine, the existence of anthropomorphic statues, and the promiscuous circulation of artefacts and ideas at the shrine — practices deemed to be resonant with those of "polytheism" and "animism." What were some of these contentious elements? I begin first with a descrip tion of the general atmosphere enveloping the event before narrowing down to specifics. Days before the "climax" of the Feast (always held on a Saturday evening), public roads and vacant land around the shrine became densely lined with a dense cluster of simple temporary stalls for rental erected by local middlemen with good connections to the town council. Vendors in these stalls purveyed a wide array of items, like household appliances, home decorations, costume accessories, clothing, cooked food, snacks, drinks, and music and video CDs. A smaller number specialised in religious paraphernalia, like can dles, prayer cards, necklaces, and statutes or posters of saints peculiar to Roman Catholicism. To cater to the perceived religiously diverse tastes of the mixed Pamphlet, undated and author unknown.</page><page sequence="11">S. G. Yeoh /Asian Journal of Social Science 37 (2009) 7-28 17 crowds, a few stall owners also included metalwork, paintings and icons of Hindu deities, like Vinayagar and Krishna, as well. Most vendors whom I spoke to said they were "not local" but came from other places — some as far as Kuala Lumpur — to Bukit Mertajam with the hope of making bumper sales over an exhausting 2 or 3 days. They slept in their vans or in tents set up behind their stalls. Water and toilet facilities were sourced at a fee from the residential houses nearby. Despite rising rentals over the years, competition for these stalls had become increasingly intense because of the prospect of huge crowds justifying their hard labour and large investments. In the distant past, elderly pilgrims recollected that vending activities were allowed inside the spacious shrine compound. By the time of my fieldwork, however, this had changed radically. The shrine custodians decided to enforce decorum within the shrine premises. A team of security guards was employed that year for a variety a specific tasks — ejecting tenacious mobile vendors and watching out for undesirable elements, like rowdy youth gangs, fortune tellers and even amorous young couples. Despite these sanitising measures, a carni val-like atmosphere was still evident given the porosity between sacred and secular spaces. A significant aural contribution to this state of transgression and generating a "Thaipusam spectacle" was attributed to the combination of loud Bollywood and Tamil devotional music blaring from powerful loud speakers of music stalls managed by Indians. Shrine authorities attempted to "neutralise" these intrusions by broadcasting over their own public address system more sedate devotional Christian hymns within the compound but the desired effect was not at all satisfactory. Inside the compound, other kinds of discordant conundrums presented themselves. Despite the palpable presence of religious iconography that under scored Roman Catholic claims over the shrine — like "The Ten Command ments," crucifixes, statues of Caucasian-looking saints, "Stations of the Cross," etc. — there were cryptic hints in the shape of ancient inscriptions on several large boulders that the place might have similar religious phenomenological significance for earlier sojourners. One such boulder was famously identified and documented by a British colonial administrator-scholar in the middle of the 19th Century (Low, 1848) and belatedly preserved by the state museum authorities. Whilst many objects of similar antiquity were probably removed through several decades of development and quarrying, I am aware of one in more recent times. During my fieldwork in the late 1990s, I came across a large boulder with Hindu astrological markings of unknown dating sited just behind the shrine building. Although partially obscured by a large shrub it was still visible to the observant pilgrim and given recognition through burn ing candles placed at its base. In my most recent stopover visit (in mid-2006)</page><page sequence="12">18 S. G. Yeoh/Asian Journal of Social Science 37 (2009) 7—28 to the shrine, that particular boulder was no longer present. There are proba bly more of the same kinds of inscriptions still existing in the more inaccessible parts of the hill behind the shrine as suggested by an elderly local parishioner who narrated of coming across them whilst on a scouting expedition in his youth decades earlier. As I did, shrine custodians probably contemplated of a possible ancient Hindu-Buddhist place of worship pre-dating the Catholic shrine. This was not entirely an implausible notion given the celebrated archaeological findings of Hindu-Buddhist megalith structures further to the north of the country several decades earlier. Nevertheless, the occasion of con structing a new strikingly-large St. Anne's Church with some indigenous architectural features incorporated (completed circa 2001; see Figure 1) near to the old shrine has allowed the opportunity to mimic more closely the dis tinguishing features of a typical European Roman Catholic pilgrimage shrine, particularly those of the celebrated Lourdes and Sainte Anne d'Auray, both situated in France. The ways in which these recent topographic changes have reconfigured pil grimage practices at the shrine are questions for further research. In my field work of the late 1990s, however, it was still cursorily evident that the old shrine was a significant focus of devotional attention. Inside this modest and compact shrine, a "religious pluralism from below" was in evidence through the distinctive stylised devotional gestures of different pilgrims, even when offering signature Roman Catholic white candles (of varying lengths) and flowers to the saint. Amongst many others, they indexed pilgrims from the provenances of Chinese religions, Buddhism and Hinduism (Yeoh, 2006:17f). Interviews with elderly parishioners suggest that the spectrum of religious adherents who have vicariously sought help from St. Anne in the past was even more diverse, and included Malays.17 Despite their multiplicity of religious and ethnic composition, the offering and seeking of common artefacts from the shrine created a zone of commensurability between them. Apart from "St. Anne's water" which was the most sought after item readily available through taps, these included flower stalks, white candles, oil and packets of salt and black pepper corns believed to be "blessed by St. Anne" herself. In many cases, they were collected not only for personal use but also for distribution to friends and family members who could not make the special trip to Bukit Mertajam. 17 A survey questionnaire conducted among 130 pilgrims in 1998 confirmed the multiplicity of religious origins. Most significantly, some of my key informants also narrated stories of Malays visiting the shrine in the distant past to seek help from the saint. One elderly parishioner said he personally knew of a few Malays asking his close friends to burn candles for them at the shrine as they could not be present because "there are a lot of spies watching."

Yeoh / Asian Journal of Social Science 37 (2009) 7-28 19 A specific item widely used across different pilgrimage cultures is the votive image. Made of light metal (like tin), the votive essentially materialised the request of the pilgrim in non-verbal terms — representations of body parts that require divine healing, iconic images of babies to signify wanted preg nancy, and so forth.18 In the case of the Bukit Mertajam shrine, it was com monly suggested to me that both Indian Catholics and Hindus (men and women) were the most likely pilgrims to deposit these items in the donation box unlike Chinese pilgrims who prefer to transact with money.19 Similarly, other devotional practices that were characterised as particularly popular with this cohort of pilgrims were the penitential act of madipitchay (literally, in Tamil, "begging from the waist") and the sacrificial service of communal cook ing and offering vegetarian food freely to others during the feast in the name of St. Anne (Yeoh, 2006:2 If). In the former, the madipitchay penitents visibly comprised largely of women and girls, whilst the latter set of devotional activ ities, requiring more exertion of physical labour and social networking, were dominated by men. Apart from offering votive images, the localised practices just described are not prevalent in European pilgrimage traditions. Indeed, the tendency of younger Catholic priests and well-informed lay persons whom I interviewed is to see them as anachronistic with the reforming spirit of mod ern day Roman Catholicism. In addition to the centrality of the Eucharist performed during daily mass and proclaiming the tangible presence of Jesus Christ, the stress has shifted to the exacting discipline of conscientious ethical everyday living rather than an excessive belief in and overdependence on miraculous interventions. This contrast is perhaps most clearly visible in the ensuing discussion on the status of the anthropomorphic statues of saints. Perched high on a pedestal and cordoned off from the pilgrims in the chan cel of the old shrine are the dyad statues of St. Anne and Mary. Regular elderly pilgrims remembered, however, that in the past there were more statues pres ent within the sanctuary. These additional statues — not only of St. Anne but also of other saints, like St. Theresa of Liseux, St. Antony of Padua, St. Jude and so forth — had been stored away from public viewing through the inter vention of a young priest when he took charge of the shrine. Reverend Father John Khoo20 reasoned that apart from wanting to keep the shrine uncluttered he found it particularly "very odd" to have multiple statues of the same saint (St. Anne) within the shrine. "This often translated into the sight of pilgrims moving from statute to statue uttering prayers and reverentially touching 18 For example, see Nolan and Nolan (1989). 19 One parishioner suggested that non-Roman Catholic Chinese pilgrims were typically known to donate large sums of money as thanksgiving for answered prayers. 20 Interview with Reverend Father John Khoo on 20 August 1998.</page><page sequence="14">20 S. G. Yeoh /Asian Journal of Social Science 37 (2009) 7-28 them. Although he conceded that these kinds of iconographie representations and tactile devotion are deeply rooted in the Roman Catholic practice of ven erating saints — "These statues are reminding us of the presence of the saint. The saint is not really there unless there is a miracle"21 — what was of particu lar concern was the devotional praxis of non-Catholics within the same physi cal (and affective) space, which raised the undesirable possibility of unduly influencing Catholics and inducing religious mimicry. As he sharply phrased it, "The non-Catholics believe that by touching more they get more [blessing]. Sometimes, these actions get copied by some Catholics as well."22 The act and logic of touching (or sometimes acquiring either the whole or fragments of sacred objects) believed to be imbued with spiritual power is a practice generic in popular religious practices. In most religious traditions, this extends to the corporeal presence of "holy persons" as well which, in this instance, are vicariously embodied in the figurai form of statues. Reverend Father John Khoo's particular unease with the pilgrim's perception of statues as possessing "magical" qualities, and thus antithetical to current orthodoxies, was not an idiosyncratic interpretation but a manifestation of the perennial negotiations between popular Roman Catholic religiosity and the demands of the orthodox Christian life as defined by the ecclesiastical authorities from time to time.23 Interestingly, however, he had also successfully obtained "first class relics" of St. Anne — bone fragments of her finger — from the Vatican just in time for that year's celebration of the Feast. Despite the obvious his torical and religious significance of this artefact for Roman Catholics, he spec ulated that non-Roman Catholics would not be able to appreciate its true value, and would instead continue to interact with the more familiar anthro pomorphic and three-dimensional statues of the saint.24 Whilst the Protestant arm of Christianity has repudiated the spiritual role of saints since at least the 16th Century, specific expressions of reformist movements within the Roman Catholic Church itself have raised similar con cerns in more recent times. Emblematic of this stance were the views of a charismatic but controversial local priest, Reverend Father Matthew Wong. A few years earlier, he had pioneered a Catholic-based "renewal" group called 21 Ibid. 22 Ibid. 23 More broadly, the issue of the theological, aesthetic and political legitimacy of iconographie representations of divinity in Christianity has complex historical antecedents in Christian Europe and the Middle East and it is beyond the scope of this essay to delve with them here. See Eire (1986), Belting (1997) and Besançon (2001) for leads. 24 An elderly parishioner confided that he felt there was a contradiction in promoting contact with a relic of the saint but not statues of St. Anne on the one hand, and allowing miniature statues to be sold in the church premises on the other.</page><page sequence="15">S. G. Yeoh / Asian Journal of Social Science 37 (2009) 7—28 21 "Witness" based in Kuala Lumpur. The fame of this group grew quickly among the Roman Catholic laity and, before long, was able to organise evangelistic and renewal gatherings and rallies for both Catholics and non-Catholics within and outside of Kuala Lumpur city. This group had also made it a point to travel to the Feast annually but for reasons quite different from the usual pilgrim. He explained: Roman Catholics tend to pick and choose their faith. Their devotion to Jesus Christ is weak because of the saints. They lack a strong feeling for Jesus Christ and tend to talk about his commandments rather than his personhood. There are lots of divergent practices in the Roman Catholic Church. Our group re-directs their devotion to Jesus Christ as King of Kings and Lord of Lords.25 At the Feast, through leafleting and guided conversations amongst the pil grims this group saw their mission as steering the Roman Catholic pilgrims devotion back towards the sacraments, the rosary, and most crucially to Jesus Christ. Reverend Father Matthew Wong also viewed the large presence of non-Roman Catholic pilgrims at the shrine as particularly opportune for evangelistic outreach: There is something miraculous happening at the shrine but the Church has not capi talised enough as there is not enough outreach to the non-Catholics. The Feast is now more of a big-time festival rather than having an evangelistic spirit.26 During my fieldwork, members of "Witness" were once again present and, through a combination of singing gospel songs, leafleting, and conversing to pilgrims milling around in the shrine grounds, added to the religious fervour of the Feast. In the recent past, local parishioners noted that the event also attracted "fundamentalist" Protestant Christian groups with similar kinds of intentions but framed in much more antagonistic terms. Prayer meetings and the occasional protest gatherings (with placards) were usually organised dur ing the Feast to decry activities at the shrine as a dangerous distortion of Christian teachings. The spiritual antidote was to return to the only true sal vationary path as personified in Jesus Christ. In one particular year, shrine administrators sought the help of the local police in dispersing their hostile presence from the shrine. The vexatious nature of oppositional readings toward the shrine is perhaps best summed up in the words of an elderly local parish ioner, Mr Clarence Ng: 25 Interview with Reverend Father Matthew Wong on 2 March 1998. 26 Ibid.</page><page sequence="16">22 S. G. Yeoh /Asian Journal of Social Science 37 (2009) 7-28 There are some people, some of whom are Protestant Christians, who have special prayers just to stop the feast.... Basically, the whole thing is that other churches don't understand — 'Why are you praying to a human being?' they ask.27 Whilst certain segments of Protestant Christians may be intolerant of per ceived "idolatrous" activities at the shrine, the devotional fervour of pilgrims outside the Christian fold provided contrasting dilemmas of the sort noted earlier. Their readiness to come to the shrine from distant places in order to seek the favours of St. Anne — and having their prayers answered — compli cated orthodox Christian understandings of the economy of salvation. Again, Mr Clarence Ng summed it well when he ruminated: The non-Christians have another kind of problem. They are our problem. They take our saint as a god, a deity which is again against our church teaching. But we cannot blame them because this is how they were brought up. That is their nature. It is wrong but we cannot stop them because they will get upset.2" Articulated from a subject position of an elderly Roman Catholic layperson who has lived all his life in Bukit Mertajam, Mr Clarence Ng's magnanimous stance seem to stem from an intuitive appreciation of the mystery of religious devotion and the diverse ethno-religious landscapes that constituted the mar ket town. For others, however, it was the possibility of shared spiritual hori zons that became pointedly problematic and ambivalent. In the case of the Christian detractors noted earlier, this was usually couched in religious lan guage that described activities at the shrine as "unclean" and involving potent "fallen" spiritual beings masquerading as Christian entities. Moreover, akin to the combative imagery of "spiritual warfare," hurling criticisms at these enti ties indiscriminately without proper and adequate spiritual protection offered by "the blood of Jesus Christ" might invite the risks of reprisals. From this standpoint, the spiritual world is populated by an array of powerful and con tending maleficent and beneficent supra-human beings demanding devotion and allegiance from mortals. For the religious intelligentsia, by contrast, the "problem" had a different inflection. It was not simply understood as a case of mistaken identity but the modality in which St. Anne was appropriated by non-Christian pilgrims. Once again, we turn to the comments of Reverend Father John Khoo for leads: 27 Interview with Mr Clarence Ng on 30 March 1998. 28 Ibid.</page><page sequence="17">S. G. Yeoh / Asian Journal of Social Science 37 (2009) 7-28 23 People from other faiths come more because they want to have their favours granted and not only because they see St. Anne as Mariyamman or Kuan Yin. These people have some serious problems... Many times they keep coming because they have tried everywhere else, especially for childbirth.29 He characterised the pilgrim's typical posture of seeking solace and help from potent supra-human entities in resolving afflictions, distress and lack as pre mised on an "emotionalist" transaction. In return for favours from the saint, the pilgrim engaged in temporary personal sacrifices (like fasting, abstinence from sex, travelling long distances to the shrine, etc.) and performed good deeds (like donating food, money, etc.). This also implied the elements of chance taking by the pilgrim — "giving it a try," "nothing to lose," and "why not try again" — as well as a suggestion of the divine exhibiting the trait of fickleness more peculiar to humans. By contrast, Reverend Father John Khoo contended that Christian faith should be correctly founded on the bedrock of stable and durable human-divine relationships regardless of the boons that one may or may not be fortunate to accrue. As he phrased it, "One should know the responsibilities and consequences of one's faith." Religiosity, thus framed, should be an asymmetrical transactional exchange not contingent on the vagaries of social and temporal flux. Conclusion: The Cultural Economy of Religious Horizons It is perhaps not altogether surprising that both the young male priests' depic tions of the practices of the typical pilgrim were "disparaging" if one situates their emotional and intellectual habitus as embedded within a discursive logic structured by a preoccupation with "presence/absence" as much as "unclear" and "messy" boundaries and horizons. For them, and others like them, the apparent fusion of religious horizons in visual evidence at the shrine as indexed by a family resemblance of gestures and artefacts lends to an uncanny recogni tion of practices that supposedly had been resolved or repressed decades, if not centuries, earlier. As I have alluded to earlier, they embody inter-textual traces of successive centuries of doctrinal contestations and hybrid theological codi fications, as well as more recent reformist ("renewal") trends, within the Roman Catholic Church. At one pole of these newer modernist impulses would be the contemporary "charismatic movement" which espouses a "puri fication" of Catholic practices and a return to more "authentic" manifestations of spiritual power vis-à-vis human intermediaries, rituals and institutional Interview with Reverend Father John Khoo on 20 August 1998.</page><page sequence="18">24 S. G. Yeoh /Asian Journal of Social Science 37 (2009) 7-28 structures. At the other end of this continuum would be appeals for a more nuanced and reasoned understanding of and constructive engagement with "Asian cultures," including the necessity of ethical "inter-faith dialogues," by avant-garde Asian Christian theologians.30 In Malaysia, while the former strand has been conspicuously on the ascendant and has arguably exerted far more substantive influences in the modality of liturgical practices and reli gious expressions, the latter comprises a minority discourse and movement.31 Arguably, despite innovations in liturgical expressions, varied and small-scale attempts in the recent past at consciously "indigenising" or "en-culturating" a range of Christian teachings and representations in terms of non-Christian imageries and iconography by enterprising local Roman Catholic priests have not been widely accepted nor clearly understood by all parishioners or even by other clergy members. Casual conversations with Roman Catholics over the years suggest that sentiments toward these enterprises range from indifference and bemusement to wariness and hostility. Indeed, some long for more clear-cut categories and certainties that supposedly marked the milieu before Vatican II. Apart from the different backgrounds in terms of social class and religious biographies inflecting their individual receptions to these innovations, the fraught nature of contemporary ethno-religious identity politics in the country forms a broader canvas backgrounding attempts at trans-religious boundary crossings. Not privy to the intricacies of intra theological debates of Roman Catholic missionary thinking, these pathways have also attracted the watchful eye of non-Christian religious leaders and intelligentsia, including Islamic authorities, conversant with the long history of proselytisation activities by an array of competing Christian groups — Prot estant and Roman Catholic — in the past. What unites these different kinds of discourses and concerns, however, is a reliance on idealised and discrete notions of sacred meanings and religious differences requiring, on the one hand, boundary surveillance, policing and purification and, on the other, the 30 Arguably, this trend was formally inaugurated with the landmark paradigm shift of the Vatican II conciliar meetings held in the early 1960s. In Asia, subsequent developments in theo logical experimentation have seen offerings of contextual and liberation theologies which de centre centuries-old Eurocentric missiological paradigms. For a sampling, refer to Pieris (1988), Mananzan (1996) and Amaladoss (2006). In the mid-1970s, the leadership of the Roman Cath olic Church of Malaysia began translating some of the prominent aggiornamento ("renewal") themes of Vatican II — inter alia ecumenism, inter-faith relations, and more involvement of the laity — into the national context. 31 Ackerman and Lee (1988) suggest that the consumers of the charismatic religious market form are largely middle-class urban Chinese, Indians and Eurasians attracted to its strikingly "Western" and "modernist" trappings in the context of an uneven "secularisation" process impinging on Muslim and non-Muslim realms in Malaysia. Because of comparatively less bureaucratic control by the state, the realm of the latter is characterised as laissez-faire.</page><page sequence="19">5. G. Yeoh I Asian Journal of Social Science 37 (2009) 7-28 25 desire to make conscious convivial linkages across different religious ethical systems. At the quotidian level, these kinds of intellectualist, cosmopolitan and political concerns have a different salience for many ordinary pilgrims at the shrine of St. Anne.32 Rather than making abstract categorical statements about the workings of the divine and their implications for human relationships, I would characterise the "typical pilgrim" at the Bukit Mertajam shrine as pro pelled by the inertia of their own religious praxis and the imprints of multiple authorships gleaned from a growing stock of pilgrimage testimonies. These stories, in brief, bear witness and give importance to the relational attributes of an idealised maternalistic saint who understands intimately the human con dition given her own life trajectory as a barren woman until her old age before miraculously given birth to Mary. For those who are ignorant of the saints specific biographical details, there are the equally inter-textual signs of her realist iconography, the natural setting of the shrine, and the large crowds present during the Feast attesting to her power and efficacy. The constellation of pilgrim practices at the shrine foments a performative "third space" which, although drawing from their own respective habitus and religious horizons, does not substantively engender new cultural forms and expressions. Never theless, their close proximity do pose a particular kind of epistemological anxiety, and the robust critiques of detractors in terms of stereotyped "devia tions" and "infractions" strategically create a functionary binary in order for their interdictions to have their desired effects. I suggest these energies enact a dynamic resembling Homi Bhabha's (1994) readings on the psychic economy of the modern postcolonial nation-state. For him, colonial (and colonialist) knowledge has an intrinsic doubling effect in which the colonised is able to look back at the coloniser and his practices through mimicry and repetition, and thereby unsettle the latter's self-proclaimed singular authority. Visuality and the panoptic gaze is an integral aspect of fixing and animating the stereo type even as "the visibility of mimicry is always produced at the site of inter diction (Bhabha, 1994:89). By the same measure, Bhabha argues, moreover, that post-colonial identities are similarly striated by the dynamics of inter subjectivity and duplicity. In the ethnographic example of the pilgrimage shrine at Bukit Mertajam, I suggest that a resonance with the uncanny quality of the contemporary state of inter-religious and inter-ethnic politics of post colonial nation-state of Malaysia is manifest. Attempts to parochialise reli gious expressions and practices are simultaneously complicated by the apparent 32 This is not to suggest that religious markers of group identities do not become sites of contestation elsewhere in urban Malaysia.

For charges of religious "syncretism" to be persuasive, an epistemological assumption of "pure" and "authentic" forms has to be posited first, and given materiality through a pedagogical cultivation of an aura of a static cultural completeness and stability. Yet, pilgrimage practices at the shrine also unsettle what has been discursively proclaimed and habitu ally reiterated as cultural wholes might not be fully and historically sealed in the first place. A processual reading of religious entrepreneurships at the shrine, thus, contextualises the disparate and competing kinds of religious sensibilities that have been brought to bear on the site at a particular juncture of its social history. It raises questions about putatively stable analytic cultural categories like "syncretism" and "hybridity". In short, as Bhabha would reminds us, "cul ture" is uncanny in the manner in which it is both "homely" and "un-homely" as it traverses new terrains, physical and metaphorical.
