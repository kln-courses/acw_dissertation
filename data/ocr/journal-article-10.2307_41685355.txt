<plain_text><page sequence="1">RITUAL DECAPITATION IN MOCHE ART By CHRISTOPHER L. MOSER In Worlds, various human societies role. Most decapitation in both often the the Old has and played New has a Worlds, human decapitation has played a significant role. Most often the practice has been associated with one of three basic cultural phenomena - warfare, status seeking or religion. Among the north coast Peruvian Moche, the severing of a man's head seems to have been pri- marily an act of religious piety. This conclusion is based on a study of the Moche's own repre- sentations of this activity. From both published and unpublished photographs and drawings of thousands of Moche artifacts, I have compiled a group of 53 objects - 50 vases, two metal objects and a stone carving - which carried some sort of representation of human decapitation. The Moche culture developed in several north coast valleys of Peru about the time of Christ or in the middle of the so-called Early Intermediate period of South American prehistory. It lasted until ca. a.D. 600 or into the early part of the Middle Horizon, when a marked Huari influ- ence interrupted the Moche V art style and cul- tural development. Chronologically, the Moche style parallels the very distinct Middle and Late Nasca styles of the south coast of Peru. Nasca art portrays an abundance of decapitations, and actual severed heads dating from this period have been found. While many similarities exist be- tween Moche and Nasca motifs, the differences are far greater, and it seems logical to assume that the common portrayals of decapitated heads and the act of decapitation have their origins in earlier Peruvian cultures. Evidence of head col- lecting has been reported for the central coast from as early as 2000 b.c. The practice appears to have been sporadic, however, until the begin- ning of the Early Horizon period (ca. 900-200 b.c.), when adaptation to life in agricultural vil- lages was in progress. Decapitated heads can be found among Cupisnique-Chavin artistic repre- sentations as well as those of the Salinar and Gal- linazo phases, all of which preceded the Moche period in northern Peru. To distinguish renderings of actual decapita- tions from depictions of face pendants and space fillers, the examples had to fall into one of the following categories: a head with blood flowing from the neck; a severed head held by the hair, suspended from a cord passed through it, or at- tached to poles or belts; and, finally, bodies lack- ing heads altogether. There are in general three types of scenes in which decapitations occur: combat between supernatural beings; public dis- play or sacrifice; and single figures holding sev- ered heads or performing a decapitation. None of the earthly battle scenes contains sev- ered heads, either in the hands of the combat- ants or as personal adornments. Indeed, only one battle scene shows a slain enemy at all, a fact which supports the conclusion that the main object of Moche warfare was not to kill the enemy but to take him prisoner for later use or sacrifice. 30</page><page sequence="2">Painted scenes of supernatural combat: (left) Moche III bottle with the Reptilian Being holding a trophy head, Reich der Inca Collection; (right) Moche I or II bottle with the Fanged Being holding a trophy which may be the head of the Reptilian Being, from Chimbóte. Relief scene of supernatural combat on a Moche III bottle. There is, however, a rather special class of combat scenes depicting supernatural beings or men impersonating such beings, one of whom of- ten holds a severed head. In all, fourteen exam- ples of this type were found. They fit into two stylistic groups. Six are on painted vessels, most- ly stirrup-spouted bottles, dating from Early Moche I to Late Moche III. These are adorned with masked men and "Reptilian Beings" (my term) holding human or animal heads and brandishing tumi , crescent knives. Eight others are on low-relief bottles that date from Moche phases III and IV. Interestingly enough, the predominantly Early III painted vessels have fantastic mythical beings while those of Late III and IV, done in relief, tend toward more real- istic human forms wearing masks or headdresses. The headgear itself depicts reptilian animals and carries other insignia of this deity, who appears to have been a central figure in the Moche pantheon. 31</page><page sequence="3">Procession scenes of figures holding trophy heads: {above) four warriors or priests dressed as Fanged Beings; (below) swimming Fanged Beings with crescent knives.

WhUe trophy heads do not appear in Moche battle scenes, warriors do sometimes carry sev- ered heads as they lead their captives in proces- sions and dances. The warriors - or priests - are sometimes disguised as Fanged or Reptilian Be- ings; at other times, anthropomorphic fish or in- sect demons parade with heads. Sometimes pris- oners are presented in a group to some official, and an actual sacrifice (decapitation) is por- trayed. One fine painted vase from the American Museum of Natural History, labeled "Official with captives from the front," shows a progres- sion of events from the aftermath of a battle to the presentation of nude captives before a figure seated on a platform; in the top row a beheading is being performed by a warrior and a Fanged Being. On one of the stirrup-spouted bottles, the painted scene depicts a person seated in a house or temple; he reaches toward a stirrup-spouted bottle and an olla or large jar, while in the cen- ter of the picture a seminude man grasps the hands of two other persons, probably priests, but possibly women. Scattered around them are am- putated arms and legs with ropes attached, and a severed human head with a cord through the mouth and neck opening - all of which may be the central figure's personal trophies, if he is a warrior. However, the central figure may be the next sacrificial victim. Another vfessel depicts a captive being stoned by a Moche warrior. The scene is filled with am- putated limbs and a pair of severed heads, which, in many respects, resemble the mummified heads from the Paracas and Nasca periods. They are threaded on lengths of cord, a practice which may have served one of several purposes-^- to at- tach the head to a warrior's belt, to carry it or to fix it on a pole for use in a religious ritual. In the procession scenes I examined, human heads are frequently attached to clubs or staff's carried by warriors, masked men or supernatural beings.

These stylized peaks serve as a background for activities that often involve sacrifice and, in at least three instances, specific decapitations. Gen- erally, one or two bodies are shown perched or lying on the highest peak, bent forward with hair hanging down. Clinging to the slopes of the mountain are the Fanged Being on one side and a naturalistic lizard or iguana on the other. At the base of the mountain there is usually a head- less body and a severed head. Solitary figures are perhaps the most interest- ing of all Moche effigies. The largest and most uniform group includes four stirrup-spouted bot- tles and two wide-mouthed jars, all molded in the form of humanized owls. Each figure holds a severed head in his left hand. Four figures ap- pear to be supernatural : they have human hands, feet and ears; they also have the beaks, neck ruffles and, in a single instance, the claws of an owl and the wide mouth and fangs of the Fanged Being. The other two seem to be men wearing the eye-and-ear mask of an owl. A sév- enth vessel is in a class by itself: the figure of a man masked as an owl beheads another man. The figures stand on top of a large circular structure which makes up the body of the vase. 34</page><page sequence="6">Owl figures holding trophy heads. {Left) Moche III or IV bottle in the form of a man wearing an owl mask.

Moche I or Early Moche II. w have seen the Fanged Being in the painted and low-relief scenes of mythic combat, on the "mountain jars" and in some of the ritual sac- rifice scenes. This creature also constitutes the bodies of four other stirrup-spouted vessels. In the first and most interesting, he stands before an altar holding a tumi in his right hand and a severed head in his left ; the body of his victim lies on the altar.

In a second ves- sel, the Fanged Being wears a fancy belt and has snakes hanging from his headdress; he, too, holds a turni in one hand and a head in the other. On a third vessel, in the Art Institute of Chicago, the figure wears a large cape with two animal heads and skins adorning his head. The final vase is a Moche IV or V zoomorphic vessel com- posed of a crouching Fanged Being supported by two human legs and four pairs of crab legs; though the hand with the knife is missing, the remaining hand holds a well-modeled severed head. Other Moche artifacts bear a wide variety of associated detail. One vessel is shaped in the form of an owl perched on a nest made of heads, one of which is a skull. Some stirrup-spouted bot- tles are potato-shaped, and for buds or sprouts have small skulls, heads and mutilated faces - 36</page><page sequence="8">evidence for a link between decapitation and ag- ricultural practices. Hammered gold ornaments feature designs of heads with blood flowing free- ly from the neck. Yet two other vessels depict an anthropomorphic creature resembling both a liz- ard and a fox, a figure identified in various con- texts as a "moon animal" and found in conjunc- tion with decapitated heads. The sheer number of stirrup-spouted portrait-head bottles shows us how concerned the Moche were with trophy heads. Many of the portraits have blank stares and may be death masks. Modeled skull or flesh- less head bottles are also common, and further suggest an association with human sacrifice. Tiie conclusions to be drawn from all this iconographie evidence must be, at best, tentative. Although the representations are vivid and full of information, we are hindered by our lack of sufficient knowledge of the north coast region of Peru and the scarcity of ethnohistorical descrip- tion. The representations show that the Reptil- ian Being and the Fanged Being, probably as- pects of the same god, were closely related to the decapitation rituals. Given the analogies with other South American and Central American cultures, the supernatural combat scenes may be interpreted as allegorical conflicts between major deities - personifications, probably, of the Sun and Moon or the Earth. Among the Chimu, later inhabitants of Peru's north coast, the Moon, Si, was the chief divinity, and weather and the growth of crops were attributed to her. Si was thought to be more powerful than the Sun be- cause she appeared by day as well as by night; eclipses of the Sun were celebrated as victories of the Moon, whereas the reverse were occasions for mourning and sacrifices of small children. Legends and descriptions of mythic fanged beings in other parts of Peru and South America suggest that the Moche Fanged Being was a major earth god, a deity important in matters of the growth of crops and fertility as well as in rituals concerning death and burial. The sac- rificial beheading scenes set on mountain tops may portray rituals to appease some earth god; such rites, at any rate, prevailed among the Maya of Central America, who appeased the earth god- dess Toci by hurling a victim to death on a pile of stones and then removing his heart. The anthropomorphic owl may be a medicine man, healer or priest. The Moche seemed to have regarded the owl, omnipresent in the fields and the enemy of mice, as a friendly guardian spirit of agriculture. As we have seen, this ani- mal is sometimes associated with the Fanged Being and in this guise may well be an incarna- tion or manifestation of him in his function as the harvest god or messenger of death, a role the owl played in Mesoamerica and later among the Incas. The severed head the fanged owl holds may relate to the cutting of ripe ears of maize; here again ancient Mexico provides analogous examples of decapitation interconnected with the harvest. The detached human heads or trophy heads need explanation. They may have been used by priests to enhance their magical powers. A sev- enteenth-century source describes the Inca belief in an Oma-popiq or Oma-poriq , a human head that went abroad at night. Such wandering heads were regarded as witches who assumed that form for the purpose of doing evil. At the present time then, in summary, we can only suggest that in Moche society human de- capitation was a central ritual act, and that the Fanged Being - most probably a principal dei- ty in the Moche pantheon, an earth-fertility or a moon-fertility god - was associated in important ways with the practice of beheading.
