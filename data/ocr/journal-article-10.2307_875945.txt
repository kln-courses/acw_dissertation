<plain_text><page sequence="1">Medieval face-jug (The London Museum) BY BRIAN SPENCER IN 1260 Henry III bought a thousand earthenware pitchers at Kingston-on-Thames for 21s. 6d. Potters even around London were clearly among the humblest craftsmen and had to toil for a meagre living. Yet during the thirteenth century their craft of jug-making blossomed into an art that showed extraordinary skill and vitality in the handling of both pitcher-shapes and plastic ornament. Decorative treatment tended to vary between regions, but almost everywhere human faces were the most popular kind of anthropomorphic decoration. The face on a jug of c.1300 (Fig.56), recently purchased by the London Museum,' was a type especially favoured in London and the counties of southern England. The jug was, in fact, discovered on the site of the Old Bailey. It is the best and largest surviving member of a small group of closely-related jugs found in London. The jug is of buff ware with a mottled green and yellow glaze. The neck is raised at the front and on it is modelled the face of a man with a pointed beard, protruding ears, a prominent nose and a stare of hypnotic intensity. A shallow groove along the length of his nose makes it possible to pour efficiently, if unex- pectedly, from the tip of the nose. His arms, shaped in the round and bent sharply at the elbow, rise from the shoulder of the jug and his hands, emerging from long sleeves, clutch the root of his beard. Beneath the face is modelled what is, archaeologically speaking, probably the most interesting feature of the jug - a fine diamond-shaped brooch ornamented with four settings. 1 Through its Mackenzie Bell Bequest, at Sotheby's sale of English pottery, i9th November 1968.</page><page sequence="2">57.
