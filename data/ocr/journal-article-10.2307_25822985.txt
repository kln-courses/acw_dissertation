<plain_text><page sequence="1">Information Science LIBRARIAN, KNOW THYSELF by Pierre Papazian The advent of mechanization in the library has led many information librarians to ques tion, both publicly and privately, their role in the new information science complex. (By in formation librarian, I mean any person whose professional duties involve the search for in formation from a collection of recorded knowl edge, e.g., the reference librarian, the research librarian, the literature searcher, etc.) To many it seems that the machine is slowly crowding the information librarian out of the picture. It is true that a great deal of research is being done in the field of information storage and retrieval, an area in which human beings had no competition for a very long time. Now we are faced with competition from machine sys tems. Various machine systems have been de veloped to store, manipulate, and retrieve in formation. Methods for improved utilization of these machines, such as syntactic analysis, word associations, statistical analysis, and search strategies, are being studied and developed. Of course, all of this study and research is being directed toward machine applications. Little or none of it is directed toward the improvement of the human information specialist. Only a token amount of research has been done on the information librarian and his work. Yet the fact is that we know next to nothing about how a competent information librarian goes about finding the answer to a question. Is it a simple matching process, a complex asso ciation process, or an evolved mental pattern ing? Certainly none of the research done in relation to computer methods of information handling has given us any insight into the hu man information search process. Human Performance The performance of the human being during the information searching process is not only a remarkable performance, but even a mysterious one. If we could gain some insight into that performance, the potential for the improve ment of human searching procedures would be unlimited. His capability to do reference and research work would be tremendously in creased. However, we cannot improve what we do not know. We must undertake the study of the functional behavior and mental processes of the information librarian in the performance of his work. An analytical study of the human search process will enable us to improve that process. Knowledge of that process would have An experienced librarian, Mr. Papazian now operates a library consultant service at 220 East Madison Avenue, Dumont, New Jersey. a profound effect on the education and train ing of information librarians. It would also affect the organization and utilization of re search libraries. It would aid in the develop ment of better classification systems. We would then be able to draw a true comparison be tween human searching procedures and ma chine searching techniques, without the cur rent anthropomorphic and mechanomorphic transformations. Perhaps equally as important, it could help establish an intellectual basis of professionalism in information and reference librarianship. We know that the information librarian in the performance of his duties must be able to understand the question or request, interpret it in the proper context (in order to match the verbalized request with the unverbalized thought in the requester's mind), perform the mental manipulations that will lead to the right sources, or at least, to the right type of sources, find the relevant information, and correlate that information into a meaningful unit. (He may not necessarily perform the entire sequence in any one search.) The step that we know the least about is the mental process that leads to the right source. It may, of course, be impos sible to determine those mental processes, but it is easy enough to observe the practical re sults of the mental processes. Some time ago, I wrote an outline proposal to make a prag matic study of human reference procedures in a general reference library. This was later re written into a more specific proposal to study the reference procedures in chemical and phar maceutical libraries. (A lack of time and staff prevented the project from being initiated.) In either general or specialized reference and in formation work, there is most likely a common methodology employed by all information li brarians. A pragmatic study of this methodology would enable us to determine the aspects com mon to all human information searching pro cedures. Going even further, a higher level study could be made to analyze the mental pro cesses involved in the search. Thus, we would have two levels of research: 1) the practice of information searching, and 2) the psychology of information searching. Searching Procedures Improvement of human information search ing procedures, as opposed to machine search ing procedures, could produce a whole new generation of information librarians, with cap abilities currently unheard of. Certainly, even now the human can perform fantastic feats of 7</page><page sequence="2">reference information work which cannot be programmed for machine utilization. He can store a vast amount of information in his memory and relate any bit of information to any other bit of information without restric tion. On the other hand, he can develop restric tive mental patterns, such as those probably used in heuristic searches, but he can also ignore such patterns in his searches. He can function in a high-order, natural language and easily shift from one to another, a capability un heard of in machines (although dreamt of by many). In addition to all the capabilities that can be programmed for machine operation, the human being has the extra capability of utilizing his imagination, a hunch, or a "sudden flash," none of which can be programmed. A cross word puzzle is a good example of what a hu man being can do using the aforementioned capabilities, yet to my knowledge, no computer has thus far been programmed to do cross word puzzles. (This would involve several problems beyond the scope of this paper.) The mental processes involved in solving a cross word puzzle may, in some respects, be analog ous to those involved in information searching In any case, the potential capability of the in formation librarian is evident in his daily work. It is now time for the information librarian to realize his potential through the analytical study of his own functional behavior. He will thereby greatly improve information services, and at the same time, enhance his professional status.</page></plain_text>
