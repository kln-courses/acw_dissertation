<plain_text><page sequence="1">WILLIAM J. R. CURTIS When one descends from the High Atlas range in southern Morocco into the pre-Sahara, one has the sensation of leaving behind the Mediterranean world and of entering Africa proper. The damp valleys of the mountains with their frigid cascades, terraced fields, and small, rubble dwellings give way gradually to rolling foothills, sparse vegeta- tion, and villages of mud. The air becomes warmer, sweeter, dryer. The desert itself is a place of majestic scale and bold polychrome streaks blending black flint, bands of amethyst, soft sand, gray wadis, and ochre tints of clay. On a clear day the dark rim of the Jebel Saghro is just visible to the south; after that the way is open to the full Sahara. Only a few wiry tufts of grass push through the stonecrop. In summer these dry up, and the heat is unbearable. In winter water rushes off the slopes, sweeping away bridges, and night tempera- tures drop to freezing. It is not a landscape hos- pitable to man. But running through the desert is a network of rivers with their sources in the mountains, and the valleys they water remain lush the whole year around. The Dades, the Gheris, the Ziz, the Dra, and their various tributaries amble in a gener- ally southerly direction, eventually to peter out in the Sahara. For their first few hundred miles they are lifelines. The oases along their banks are extra- ordinarily fertile and support date palms, spring wheat, barley, sorghum, fruit, vegetables, and livestock. This verdant, paradisal world of running water, shaded groves, blossoming orchards, and human settlements is only a stone's throw from the desert (plate 1; fig. 1). To a cubist sensibility the oasis dwellings are a visual delight with their rectangular planes of light ochre gashed by deep shadows, their repetitions and variations on simple geometrical themes. Type and Variation: Berber Collective Dwellings of the Northwestern Sahara They embody an aesthetic rooted in standardiza- tion, a fine sense of proportion, and the direct use of local materials. The mud towers and dark alley- ways have a curiously mystical atmosphere and possess a remarkable probity. It is easy to indulge in the notion that one is here face to face with some deep strain of animism long since lost in the West, that these gaunt fortified villages embody some archaic and primeval myth. But ramblings on the "eternal present" are rudely interrupted when one realizes that most of the examples available to the senses are less than a century old: mud cannot be expected to last much longer than that.1 Moreover, primitivist yearnings will only dis- tort the picture. The buildings now standing there rest on traditions of the most prodigious ingenuity in adapting to the rigors of the setting, but these traditions may have undergone many changes and influences along the way. At the core are two conditions related to the geography: one stems from the need to handle a climate combining extremes of heat and cold with very low humidity, the other from the contrast between oasis and desert; the line between the two is firm and also divides two ways of life, the nomadic and the sedentary. The nomad lives by moving. He needs to locate new grazing grounds for his flocks and relies precariously on limited sprinklings of rain. His dwelling is light, airy, and made from wool: it is, of course, the tent. The oasis inhabitant stays in one place, tending his fields and storing the produce. Water flows steadily to him, and all he needs to do is channel it. The basis of his economy is the date palm, a reliable and abundant means of support. His dwelling is correspondingly earth- bound and solid. One reason for the fortified character of the oasis settlement now begins to come clear: such a dramatic and immediate con- 181</page><page sequence="2">MUQARNAS Plate 1.

The society of the southern Moroccan oases reflects a checkerboard history of invasions, mi- grations, and intermixtures. The well-worn con- trast between the bled-el-makhzan of the north (under the control of sultans and their taxes) and the bled-es-siba of the south (supposedly anarchic, segmentary, and tribal) will scarcely do justice to the complexity of influences and alliances.2 Even so it is as well to recall that the prodigious Atlas range is an effective barrier against northern infil- trations of armies and ideas, and that the southern oases have played a particular role in the history of political struggle in the region: the seeds of the Saadian ascendancy were sown along the banks of the fertile Dra. The populations of the oases have varied con- siderably over the ages and, for at least the last four hundred years, have included Berbers, Arabs, Jews, Christians, and Haratin, the last originally black slave laborers. While the predomi- nant religion is Islam (Sunnism of the Malaki rite), that is not the only framework of belief; social, 182 "I ~l?- - -w -- - - ~~~~ -4w#-;~-</page><page sequence="3">I~~~~~~ILAMJ .CRI 8 legal, and political structures are eclectic and in- clude extremely ancient Berber traditions.3 But then those innocent terms "Berber" and "Arab" also mask a multitude of shades, languages, and lineages. "Berber" may describe at one moment a linguistic group, at the next a tribal identity related to lineage, and at the next a region that may only sixty years ago have been more open to specifically Arab traditions. One needs to be suspicious of any blood-and-soil assertion concerning the nature of either an indigenous population or its architecture. In these circumstances, generalizations about cul- ture have to be handled with considerable subtlety. Discrimination is also necessary in the field of study, for the indigenous forms of building incor- porate a number of related architectural and urban types. On the lower foothills of the Jebel Saghro and the Atlas are small sprawling villages of ir- regular but fortified form known as kelaas. In the valleys of the Ziz, the Dades, and the Dra are exotic sequences of loam sandcastles, some of them over sixty feet high, known as tighremts. All over the region, in the river valleys or along their edges, are fortified villages of a distinctive, rectan- gular form, with high walls, orthogonal streets, a single gate, and a profusion of towers, known as ksour; the singular form is ksar. They are found in profusion from the Sous in the west to the Tafilalt in the east, from the Atlas in the north to the lower regions of the Dra in the south (fig. 1).4 To explain the form of the ksar proves espe- cially difficult for both historical and theoretical reasons. Sources are not abundant, and history in the region has usually consisted of the oral repeti- tion of certain standard myths concerning tribal beginnings. Ibn Khaldin and Leo Africanus did not, it seems, spend their time lingering in mud fortresses.5 Moreover, the evidence of the build- ings themselves covers only a limited time. Per- haps archaeology will one day have more to teach, but mud buildings leave few lasting traces. The record is only mildly amplified by the descriptions of Western travelers in the nineteenth century: men like Charles de Foucauld had little to say about buildings.6 Thus the bulk of hard fact on Berber matters was produced by French scholars under the Protectorate (1912-56). Of course, much of this information was gathered to help manipulate the country politically, but it would be silly to reject the insights of such scholars as Laoust, Terrasse, Lhote, Marqais, Jacques- Meunie, Montagne, and Capot-Rey solely on the grounds that they worked within a colonial struc- ture.7 Since Moroccan independence in 1956, re- search has been undertaken with a more emphati- cally architectural bias: surely any study of indige- nous architecture in the region will be indebted to the fieldwork and measured drawings of the Dutch Kasba 64 Study Group, which published its find- ings in 1973.8 Specifically architectural observa- tions made in this article, however, are based on the first-hand experience of living in these oasis dwellings with their owners and builders.9 These historical difficulties are compounded by various theoretical pitfalls that sometimes cloud studies of vernacular design: the Rousseauesque faith in noble savagery that makes peasant life out to be a fiction of balance and harmony with nature; the biological determinism that reduces the native to a bee and his village to a hive; or the determination to uncover the integrated society that takes it for granted that vernacular buildings are "direct portraits" of a people. When dealing with a country which, like Morocco, is emerging from a colonial phase the temptation to indulge in populist romanticism may be great, because it is easy to claim that the peasant is the most direct expression of a national identity. These ideological refractions will be further distorted according to the depth of sympathy with either Berber or Arab definitions of culture. Most recently there is an- other danger to be avoided: the tendency to claim a supranational and suprahistorical pan-Islamic essence stretching all the way from Manila to Mogador.10 What approach, then, should be taken? A method that seeks to explain the ksar by balancing the relative influences on the form of climate, geography, social structure, religious belief, tech- nology, economics, symbolic conventions, stylistic tendencies, historical events, and possible earlier prototypes is profitable; one needs to treat the architecture of the southern Moroccan oases as a system of interrelated formal, functional, and symbolic types, allowing considerable individual variations. The overall aim should, perhaps, be to define the constituent elements of the type and the rules for their combination. Finally, all forms of determinism should be avoided,11 and every at- tempt made to abstract the principles of an archi- tectural language. For it is at the level of underly- ing principle that a set of forms provides its most valid and lasting lessons. THE FORM AND SETTING OF THE TYPICAL KSAR A ksar is a fortified farming village made almost entirely of mud.12 It is usually rectangular in plan and enclosed by walls between twenty and fifty feet high (plate 2; fig. 2), buttressed along their WILLIAM J.

CURTIS 185 length and at the corners by taller towers of a distinctive tapering form. The narrow streets with- in are canyonlike and laid out to conform loosely to orthogonal directions. Dwellings are densely packed together and are usually variations on a courtyard type, two or three stories high with a usable flat roof. Public institutions such as the mosque and the bathhouse are situated close to the single gate which often (but not always) faces east. There is very little open ground-level space inside the ksar. The site is used as economically as possible to gain high densities, a defensible perim- eter, and the climatic benefits of a low surface to volume ratio. Space, light, and views are abun- dantly available from the individual roof terraces which constitute a sort of patchwork of raised platforms thirty feet or more above the level of the terrain. The ksar usually stands to one side of the oasis on slightly raised ground. In this way valuable farmland is saved, contact between buildings and standing water is minimized, and access is kept clear of cover in case of an invasion attempt. This typical placement automatically engenders a cer- tain contrast between front, back, and sides: since the plan of the ksar is rectangular each wall tends to meet different topographical or climatic con- ditions. The sides most vulnerable to attack or the fierce onslaught of the wind will be more Figure 2. Plan showing typical elements of the ksar, including a sample of individual houses. Plate 3.

The side linking the ksar to a track may be pre- ceded by low perimeter walls for cattle pens, a moat, or a flat, open space used for suqs, cere- monies, casual political interchange between vil- lagers, or, at harvest time, the sorting of crops; festival dances can take place there (plate 2). The sides linking the ksar to the oasis are preceded by low mud walls with locking doors between which paths of irrigation channels run. The orchard and field patterns often conform to a grid, and so take something of the geometrical character of the ksar into the natural setting. The firm distinctions be- tween public and private areas in the oasis also ensure a highly regulated set of approaches to the ksar; once again defensibility is involved (plate 3). But whatever the variety of conditions sur- rounding the ksar, it maintains its integrated, four- square, and fortified character. The martial mood is enhanced by thick corer towers which are broader at the base than at the top and a little bowed in the middle. The single gate is also a grand and solid-looking affair. It protrudes from the wall and is often flanked by its own small towers. There is no mistaking its focal importance. It usually stands halfway along the east facade, but if common sense suggests it is better to have WILLIAM J. R. CURTIS 185</page><page sequence="6">MUQARNAS access through some other wall then it is set into that. It is no accident that it is so prominent and that it is sometimes decorated more than the wall; it has a number of key functions in the life of the ksar. First of all, it is the way in and out, and this is no trivial matter when security is so highly valued: it is a point of control, and there used to be severe penalties for anyone who avoided it by, for ex- ample, clambering over a wall. But the gate is also the meeting point - literally and symbolically- between the familiar and the foreign. Benches are placed in the shade under the entrance so that a visitor may be welcomed and scrutinized from a cool place where eminent or elderly members sit, chat, sip mint tea, ramble on endlessly about dis- putes over a ditch or the price of dates, and per- haps smoke a little kif (plate 4). But the gate also serves as a frontispiece to the most public institutions of the ksar, which are often situated just inside. These are the mosque, the bathhouse, and the small public square. One might expect them to be placed at the center of the ensemble, where they would be less vulnerable, but the mosque is used for village councils which sometimes include outsiders, and a small structure next to it is used to put up visitors for the night. It Plate 4. Gate structure seen from within the ksar, near Goulmima. seems that the area close to the gate is considered a sort of antechamber or transitional zone between the ksar and the rest of the world. The square just inside the gate may be used for the bartering of wares or for the temporary tethering of animals; it is about the only well-lit and well-ventilated space that one will encounter at ground level. Like the mosque, it is rarely visible from the outside because the gate contains a system of chicanes which force a zigzag line of approach. From the square one enters the bath- house, a humble structure with a small chamber alongside where water is heated in a giant pot over a fire, or the mosque, an unostentatious room with a tiny hypostyle of palm logs supporting the roof and a mihrab embedded in what is, effectively, the outer wall of the ksar. There may be a small qu'ranic school above the main chamber, but there is no minaret. The muezzin clambers onto the roof or gate to make himself heard as far as the distant palm groves. Beyond the public areas close to the gate begins a tight network of smaller streets. These are narrow and extremely dark. Dust floats every- where, occasionally caught by a beam of diagonal sunlight. Sounds are muffled and broken. Pieces of a conversation float through the obscurity. Oc- casionally a head peeps over a parapet, then disap- pears amidst giggles. Chickens and children are constantly in the way. The air is cool, and in the daytime the doors to the houses are often left open, allowing only a glimpse of a small ante- chamber. As in the gate, so in the door, privacy and defense are primary considerations. The indi- vidual house is a fort within a fort; its walls, apertures, and spaces restate those of the town on a much smaller scale. The family is the basic unit of the Berber social structure and may include the families of sons. Correspondingly, the courtyard house is the unit of the ksar. But a ksar is more than just the sum of its individual houses, as these usually share party walls and may even abut the perimeter wall directly. Since everything is built from the same material and in the same way, the effect of a street, or even a sequence of streets, is of an integrated unitM d'habitation rather than an aggregation of distinct parts. Indeed buildings and open spaces are locked together as a single system, further unified by the standardization of elements and modules. The individual building is always sensed as being part of the larger urban whole. The house types used in ksour vary consider- ably from region to region, but the most prevalent sort is arranged in two levels around a small square courtyard only a few feet across (fig. 3). As 186</page><page sequence="7">WILLIAM J. R. CURTIS 187 the roof terrace is usable (and occasionally partly covered) there are three levels in all. One enters on the ground floor, which is even darker than the street and is used for the storage of cattle, tools, dates, corn, straw, bundles of reeds, or building materials. Sometimes the house is fortunate enough to possess its own well. If not, water is stored in large cooling jars. There is sometimes a crude privy but no sewage system. The ground floor of this type of dwelling then is a sort of services zone, but when the heat is very fierce the family may come down into its cool shadows. The plan is, crudely speaking, tripartite: an entry zone, a central area beneath the small aperture of the court supported on four piers or palm logs, and a back area for storage. The first and third zones are narrower than the central one and create structural slots which reinforce the armature of the dwelling and places into which the stairs may be placed. Usually the stairs are situated to one side of the entrance zone. In this type of house the second level is used for living: its ceilings are correspond- ingly higher than those of the ground floor and its spaces more amply lit. A guest room may be situated close to the top of the stairs above the entrance. The area around the court (which cor- responds to the central zone beneath) is sometimes entirely open. In that case, it is a sort of outdoor room which serves as a kitchen, where cooking is done over an open fire, as a reception area, and as a dining room. The rooms above the storage bins at the back of the house may be inaccessible to the visitor. Here the family has its own private life in semidarkness. Indeed, in terms of the psychologi- cal division of space the passage into the house recalls the entrance to the ksar: a controlled way in, a space for the mediation of familiar and foreign worlds, then the inward-looking private sphere. The house is furnished sparsely and simply (plate 5). The most conspicuous display will be a few carpets of bold geometrical design and a low table of beaten copper or, more rarely, silver, on which mint tea is served. Stools are few, and one sleeps on a low mattress. These days a hurricane lamp may be in evidence alongside traditional implements like the nut grinder or the loom. Stor- age is in bins or large jars. Occasionally one con- fronts some ingenious adaptation of industrial waste, such as a wooden door covered with old, hammer-beaten sardine tins in a most elegant overall pattern. The third level in such a house is usually entirely open, though there may be a small shelter at the top of the stairs which also serves as a storage place for tools and as a partial shelter if the LIJVAs6 Ir- - ' - - " "i - K e r c # e ,J -R'YI I ^" :== 6 RooF Figure 3.

The open roof itself is a workplace for the women, often precariously overloaded with drying dates, and a place where light, air, and a view are available to all, though angles of sight are regulated to prevent looking down onto someone else's second level. The roof culminates the jour- ney from the gate with its panorama over neigh- boring rectangular rooftops to the palm groves, the desert, and the mountains beyond. There the family is entirely secure and behavior becomes much less formal. The chatter from house to house is continual: one cannot resist quoting Richardon's assessment, made a century and a half ago, pf flat roofs in Saharan architecture somewhat further east: Everyone now knows or ought to know that the roofs of Barbary and Saharan houses are flat, where the people walk and enjoy "the cool of the evening" or the "evening tide" after getting up from their naps and siestas. Here the women gossip and the men pray, but the latter are often disturbed in their devotions by the intruding glimpse of some desert beauty. Love matches and in- trigues are equally concerted between the house tops. 13 WILLIAM J. R. CURTIS 187</page><page sequence="8">MUQARNAS Plate 5. Reception room in a ksar house of the type possessing covered public spaces; note simple furnishings and implements. This is one type of house, and there are others. In the north, for example, the living area is sometimes at the ground level, with storage above. Evidently many considerations come into play: a family with cattle will have to keep them on the ground floor; one with a large investment in grain will need to use the drier floor above. It is rare to encounter any type in its purity. Growth of Plate 6. The flat roof, Ksar Igargar, near Goulmima. the family encourages irregular additions upward, and even outward over alleyways (fig. 3). In one variant, the tripartite plan is swung ninety degrees so that one enters a sort of central hall with com- partments to either side. Upstairs the hall is re- peated and roofed, so that the public rooms are on one side and the family areas on the other. This arrangement is preferred in more recently built ksour, where the lessening concern for fortification makes the sharing of party walls unnecessary, and all four outside walls can be used to admit light. If the houses vary, so do the ksour them- selves. Some of them may be as much as a quarter of a mile along each side, with two or three gates and over a thousand inhabitants. In such cases, ksour gradually accrue, one outside the other, in increasingly large rectangles.14 At the other end of the scale are micro-ksour of only thirty or forty people from three or four related families; these can be only fifty or sixty meters along each side. The elements of the type can be disposed in slightly different ways (fig. 4). For example, there may be two perimeter walls, and the mosque may be placed over the gate itself. A variant found especially in the Dades and Dra valleys has a tighremt (once a collective storage bin and forti- fied communal refuge) at the center. Even so the ksar has a distinct and unmistakable identity, which distinguishes it from its local cousin building types and from other mud dwellings of the Sahara region. 188 I</page><page sequence="9">WILLIAM J. R. CURTIS 189 GEOGRAPHY AND CLIMATE At a most fundamental level, architecture stands at the juncture between culture and nature. The buildings of the oases combine ingenious environ- mental devices for coping with a rigorous climate and a judicious use of limited local materials.15 The disposition of the Atlas range in relation to the rain-bearing winds from the Atlantic ensures a steady flow of water in streams all the year round, with a dramatic increase at the time of the thaw in the high peaks. The rich clay of the river beds is perpetually refurbished with mountain silt. Subter- ranean seepage guarantees abundant supplemen- tary supplies of moisture, which nature channels in springs and cultivators control through wells and irrigation ditches. Thus, although local rainfall is slight (sometimes as low as three inches in a year), the land is extremely fertile (plate 7). The date palm is the solid anchor of the oasis life in a world of surrounding sands and wastes. It grips the soil and provides fruit that is basic to the diet of both desert and oasis populations. Its wood makes strong logs for building beams or bridges, and its fronds have a multitude of covering func- Figure 4.

Straw from spring wheat is abundant, and livestock provide a good supply of dung. Together with the thick clay of the region and the limited supply of boulders in the riverbeds, useful for foundations, these are materials enough for an architecture. But materials do not determine forms beyond setting limits on what is possible (plate 8). Mud is ideal in certain climates as it is a material that absorbs temperature slowly and then stores it. In the Sahara, daytime temperatures may touch fifty degrees centigrade in high summer, then in the evening show a rapid and dramatic drop. Mud mediates well between such extremes. The walls of the oasis dwelling warm up slowly in the day, then radiate heat to the interior during the cold nights. In the morning the outer surfaces have become cold, and so the cycle starts again: by mid-afternoon the interiors are cool. Mud con- struction of the unbaked variety, however, makes sense only if local rainfall is slight. Even in the Saharan oases the buildings have to be fitted with slightly sloped roofs and gutters made from split palm logs to throw the water away from the walls. At the same time in this method of construction a great deal of water is absorbed when building is actually going on. The pattern of supply in the 189 WILLIAM J. R. CURTIS N '</page><page sequence="10">MUQARNAS tall interiors where the air can circulate more Plate 8. Mud banks close to Zagora in the valley of the Dra. oases is just right: the water comes from the ground and not from the sky. The thick mud wall with small apertures is fine for coping with the temperatures of desert Moroc- co, but only because the humidity is low. Without this condition the cavernous interiors would be unbearably clammy. This is where the desert and the date palm play their roles in the system. The former keeps the humidity down, while the latter creates evaporation and shade sufficient for human comfort. As the thick mud walls let in little light and air from the sides, these have to come in through the top. Thus the courtyard helps to make the dwelling habitable. The abundance of strong direct sunlight and the high temperatures require that one should attempt to maximize the ratio between habitable volume and exposed exterior surface. Given the latitude and sun angles the ksar is scarcely opti- mal in this respect, but it is designed as a tight aggregation with its few open spaces amply pro- tected by shade. Its main streets often run from east to west, so as not to be touched by the sun at the hottest time of the day, and its courtyards are designed with steep proportions so that the rays can rarely reach inhabited spaces. The vertical character of the buildings themselves also creates easily. The arrangement of the ksar house allows considerable flexibility in response to climatic vari- ation. When it is very hot, the inhabitants go to the lowest level with the cool water jars, the damp alfalfa, and the beasts. They open the door, and a circulation system is set in motion between the shaded street, the interior, and the courtyard which gets warmer the higher one goes and so draws the air. At night, when the weather is cooler, the family moves to the roof to catch the refreshing breezes. In winter the inhabitants linger in the closed areas of the house which they heat with open fires. They move like nomads, wandering through a sequence of caves. No use is made of sculpturally dramatic wind catchers, but wind is nevertheless a major consid- eration. The west wind refurbishes the streams in the mountains and so supports the life of the oasis in the long run; in the short run, however, it is a pest since it batters the west wall of the ksar with its showers. That is why the wall facing in this direction is often so patched and tattered, and why bundles of reeds are sometimes laid along the vulnerable edges of the parapet. When the wind comes up from the Sahara it is hot and dusty, and thus it is common to see windows facing that way fitted out with heavy shutters. Climate and geography exerted a consider- able influence on the morphology of the ksar but they did not determine it. It is arguable that other forms of tight mud aggregation would have done as well, if not better, in the same circumstances. Evidently climate is only one consideration among many. The stark walls of the ksar express a need to exclude hostile elements, and those can be human as well as natural. SOCIAL ORGANIZATION AND SYMBOLIC FORM Even to the observer innocent of the social com- plexities of the oasis populations, the form of the ksar suggests a strongly coherent unit of some kind. Terrasse intimated something of this when he wrote that close aggregations were "the most natural formation in a country where the social unit is at once very small and very solid."16 How- ever, one should beware of oversimplistic equa- tions between social and architectural forms. No society is static; breaks and divisions in a social structure can remain unrevealed in the visual ar- rangement. Making observations about the social life of the oases always risks the danger of over- generalization. Changes have been quite dramatic 190</page><page sequence="11">WILLIAM J. R. CURTIS 191 over the past two centuries;17 some have been mirrored in architectural form, others have not. Determining social expression in architecture is complicated in an area so manifestly confused in its cultural origins, its racial mixtures, and its fluid intertribal transactions. Similar building forms may be employed to house a village of Jewish metalworkers, an Arab tribal group, a Berber ikh of related families, or a town including all those groups and Haratin as well, although admittedly, in such an instance, some spatial divisions (en- forced by subsystems of the perimeter wall) would be found. To speak too assertively of a Berber architecture may also be to assume too strongly a sort of core identity stretching back to a time before the Arab invasions twelve hundred years ago. The skeptic may therefore like to assert that a Berber collective dwelling is simply one that hap- pens to have a majority of Berber-speaking people in it. A swift dissolution of links between inherited Berber social forms in the region and the forms of architecture may not be so easy, however. Mon- tagne, in his remarkable (and at times romantic) appraisals of Berber society, felt certain that he could identify traits that had proved resistant to outside influence.18 He stressed the almost exclu- sively rural character of social organization, the profound traditionalism of Berber life, and a sort of oscillation in the forms of polity between rule by council and rule by despot. He also emphasized the segregational character of intertribal relations and described a scheme of checks and balances at all levels known as the leff, which he felt ensured a kind of stability in primarily Berber zones and which was quite different from the chaos tradition- ally ascribed by Western observers to the bled-es- siba. In turn Montagne spoke of the fierce inde- pendence of the Berbers in the face of hostile forces, particularly the repeated attempts at paci- fication by the sultanate. There can be little doubt that Montagne was committed to distinguishing Berber elements from Arab ones, and that he was a little too enthusiastic in ascribing democratic tendencies to Berbers; nevertheless some of his instincts concerning the resilience of this culture may have been correct. The basic social unit is the patriarchal family, or fire, including a man, his wife (or wives), his unmarried children, his married sons, and their dependents.19 Among sedentary groups these fires may be assembled into an ikh of half a dozen or more close relatives who occupy a single village. The concept of tribe is complicated, where Ber- bers are concerned. On one level, there are the local groups of villages combined into larger states, which Montagne called cantons; on another level, not necessarily coincident with the first, are groups each tracing themselves back to a single ancestor. The Ait Atta of southern Morocco, for example, all think of themselves as descendants of one Dadda Atta. At the peak of their imperial expansion across the pre-Sahara in the nineteenth century this group numbered nearly one hundred thousand.20 Some of them were nomads and war- riors; others were occupied with controlling or managing oasis agriculture. To make some simple equation between ksar and tribal group is thus too easy. The interplay and conflict between nomads and sedentes, however, provide major reasons for the fortification of the oasis dwellings. The causes of conflict were many, but a classic one was drought, which forced nomadic populations to attack the villages. Elaborate controls of oasis resources were also necessary because of conflicts between warring nomadic groups. A sort of pro- tection levy, known as the raaya, by which defense was swapped for a reliable food supply, was occa- sionally worked out.21 Again, conflicts might occur between sedentary villages squabbling over water supplies, or, if they happened to be transhumant, over access to pastures in the Atlas during the grazing season.22 In any case, the core of the matter was usually the control and management of sparse natural resources and the ensurance of an adequate food supply. Little wonder that collec- tive grain bins or agadirs were regarded as sacred places and were highly fortified.23 Similarly, the dwellings of the sedentes them- selves had to be fortified. But what group would associate within a single enclosure? Again it seems that there is no single answer. In some cases, an entire community might belong to the same broad tribal group and also share a particular holy ances- tor. In the large ksour, a variety of families of different tribal lineage might nonetheless be asso- ciated through their cantonal allegiances. The mini-society of the ksar was never homogeneous. At the top of the social hierarchy there might be saints (mrabtin and charfa) who claimed direct accession from the Prophet; Gellner thought that their equivalents in the High Atlas at Zawiya Ahansal stemmed from a tradition of pre-Islamic, charismatic magicians.24 Next there might be free- men or harrar who constituted a sort of middle class and who were often in a position to own land and employ tenant farmers. At the lower end of the social spectrum there might be Haratin and gebbala, the former lowly agriculturalists (some of them slaves), the latter white peddlers. Then again there might be Jews, who were usually involved in WILLIAM J. R. CURTIS 191</page><page sequence="12">MUQARNAS metal crafts, and who lived either in their own ksar or in a separate zone of a ksar that also contained the other groups.25 These broad characterizations, however, no longer entirely apply today. Slavery was abolished decades ago, though racial discrimi- nation can still be sensed among the oasis popula- tions. Social structure is further complicated if one examines the history of political structures. Mon- tagne was intrigued by the democratic element in Berber political life reflected in the choosing of representatives and the annual election of a head- man or amghar.26 The duty of that group was to settle disputes, to manage irrigation and wells, to represent the village at a larger cantonal form of council, and even to handle legal matters. It seems that when this system was operative, authority was partly held in check by a democratic process. Meetings would take place once a week in the mosque. It is tempting to see in the visual empha- sis on such public elements of the ksar as the walls, the towers, the gate, the public square, and the collective storehouse or tighremt some evidence of a republican tendency, so to speak. Amghars were likely to be drawn from groups with preexisting wealth or status, however, and that prestige might be reflected in a larger or more ornate species of dwelling than usual, very close to a tighremt in form (plate 9).27 By the late nineteenth century, in any case, these political structures were under siege from the power thrusts of the Glawa, the Mtougga, and the other so-called Lords of the Atlas.28 The direct result in architectural terms was the destruction of numerous tighremts, since they were the very basis and symbol of republican independence. In turn, massive kasbas were built to one side of the vil- lages that had been subdued. Those included colossal households living around sequences of courts and were often decorated with motifs re- calling urban traditions of the makhzan. Thus one form of political structure replaced another and expressed its presence in a new form of symbolic appropriation of the land (plate 10). To have spoken at all of the concept of type in relation to the ksar is to have indulged in a risky abstraction, as if a species of built structure con- tained certain essential elements capable of surviv- ing major historical change. Therefore, one is bound to ask, what aspects of the type as so far described correspond to what typical aspects of the social structure, and at what stage? Since the sub- jugation of the Berber tribes of southern Morocco by the French in the twenties and thirties and the Plate 9.

Fortifica- tion of the entire collective entity has become far less important, as these changes have led to a new mode of grouping and a new spatial expression. What have been discussed here as the classic ele- ments of the ksar must belong to a phase of bal- anced opposition between small rural groups in which a species of local democratic government regulated the collective life. Perhaps the ksar was a threat to the new despots of the late nineteenth century for the same reason that the tighremt was: because it embodied a regularized system of coop- eration and conflict that had no place for an over- riding centralized authority. Whether these condi- tions were basic and ancient or passing and rela- tively modern is hard to say. But it does seem likely that the very means of survival in the oases and deserts of southern Morocco may, from early times, have required fortified entities reliant on a strong bond of cooperation in the face of hostile groups competing for resources. Perhaps we would do well to consider carefully Montagne's words on Berberness after all. Berber society, through its inability to construct lasting states and through the inertia with which it confronts those who would found new states within it, retains within itself an infinite capacity to endure. It accepts outwardly those forms of civilization which come from the outside: Rome and Christianity, Arabia and Islam, and now, in the twentieth century, France. But it never gives more than a part of itself and keeps for itself its secret essence. Its local dialects preserve an entire inner existence which is expressed in its poor literature, but which shelters, nevertheless, esoteric and enduring be- liefs. Above all, it maintains something that we cannot call "individualism," but rather a "particularism" of tribe and village. It preserves in its core the ever-faithful memory of the period of canton independence, and of leff solidarity.29 It would be insufficient to regard the ksar merely as a functional diagram resulting from the pressures of internal and external forces, however, for it seems likely that symbolism is also involved. To begin with, one may perhaps read the plan of the ksar as an idealization of the body politic (fig. 2). The individual dwellings are subservient to a larger pattern of relatedness expressed in the overall geometry and public elements of walls, towers, gate, mosque, square, and streets. If the village is seen as a much amplified version of the house, and the house as a much condensed version of the village, a striking consonance emerges be- tween door and gate, space of welcome and square, family fort and ksar. Whether that particu- lar reading is fanciful or not, it has to be admitted that the four-square, symmetrical ksar supplies an extraordinarily coherent image of the idea of a WILLIAM J. R. CURTIS 193</page><page sequence="14">MUQARNAS unified, balanced, and coherent community, what- ever the actual schisms within. The plan can be interpreted, then, as a sort of ideogram expressing the relationship between the governing and most sacred institutions and the populace. The mosque, of course, is used for council functions as well as religious ones. It stands with the gate at the head of the whole village. The main street makes a sort of spine to the ksar and, in those versions with a tighremt at the center, the town also has a heart, and perhaps even a stomach. There is no evidence whatever that anthropomorphism of this kind was intended, but it is a possible reading of the symbolism of a spatial layout (fig. 5). In the larger landscape of the oasis valleys the ksar was only one type within a hierarchy of func- tionally linked structures, which included kelaas, agadirs, tighremts, and kasbas. These buildings were cousins both to one another and to the ksar; a consistent language of elements was shared and emphasized in slightly different ways in each. The stark surfaces and regimented repetition of ele- ments might have been used to imply military character and strength; the crucial factor of size was undoubtedly read as an indicator of pros- perity, security, and independence. In the com- bined tighremt-ksar formula, the collective store- house made the village visible from afar and towered over the houses of the ksar. Ornamenta- tion was often used, as it was on the gate, to enhance its importance. But this form was not the emblem of tyranny: it was rather the expression of Figure 5. Diagram of typical ksar stressing relation- ship between public functions and elements. =+- .1~~~~~ I I. collective solidarity. The building was used to store each family's grain and as a castle keep for the community in times of stress; moreover, the tighremt was regarded as a sacred place.30 Even in those cases where the form was coopted by the amghar as a family residence, it still probably represented a coherent group expression. The imagery of the gate and the tighremt on axis with it, with the mosque and public square as part of the sequence, made a powerful, hieratic statement of the wealth and resilience of the community as a whole. Since at least some of these political and sacral overtones might have been possible using other forms, it is time to consider whether the four-square plan with an east-facing gate had any particular meaning. The orientation of the mosque to Mecca immediately comes to mind. If the retort is that correct orientation could have been achieved wherever the mosque was placed then the answer is ready: it is wrong to isolate this key sacral and communal function from the whole image of the ksar, and the easternmost position with respect to all other functions must surely be read as an emphasis of the entire community's religious allegiances. Just as Berber social forms blend many historical influences with ancient pat- terns, so the eastward placement of gate and com- munal space can be related to ancient mythical meanings. The fact is that the ksar as a whole has a remarkable mandala-like character, and that this particular image of wholeness is aligned with the main cardinal directions. May it not be possible that we have here an example of Islamic conven- tions lying over a substructure of Berber belief in such things as the renewing power of the sun or the regular shape of the cosmos? Is the ksar a representation of some sort of ideal world? Until much more is known of the history of Berber beliefs and their expression in emblematic and abstract forms, such suggestions must remain ten- tative. Here Bourdieu's ingenious interpretation of the Kabyle houses of Algeria comes to mind. He implies that all the main spaces of the dwelling must be read in terms of polarities between dark- ness and light, female and male social functions, and directions relative to the compass points.31 The value of these suggestions may be limited in this case, since there is little direct evidence for analogous interpretations in the reading of the southern Moroccan ksar dwelling. Perhaps it is safest to leave the matter in suspension and to concur with Bourdieu only in asserting that the Berber world of the imagination is haunted by magical forces related to a mythopoeic vision of 194 a ?II l m I a</page><page sequence="15">I~~~ILA . .CRI 9 nature.

The result is a forceful monumentality, even in quite small ksour, and this no doubt reflects a striving after grandiose and martial character. In southern Morocco walls are rarely painted; the articulation and decoration of the mud surfaces are provided by the small windows punched into them, by the holes left by shuttering and scaffold, by the stones inserted below each course, and by the split palm logs used as gargoyles (plate 2). Most of the ornament is made from necessary elements, but the tighremts, the houses of the well-to-do, and the gates may occasionally be embossed with ornamentation based on lozenges, diamonds, or other geometri- cal motifs (plate 12). On interior surfaces mud is often left bare, or occasionally covered with a sealant or paint. Two severe drawbacks to the local clay are the dust that floats everywhere and the insects that find in the thick walls their ideal nesting ground. Wood is also employed in the construction of the ksar. Palm logs make fine cylindrical supports, especially under the edges of the small courtyard aperture; boards of palm and other timbers are also used to make rafters for ceilings and floors. The spans are rarely more than a couple of meters. Palm fronds or rushes are laid over the rafters in crisscross patterns, and mud is then poured into place to make the floors. The whole process recalls the familiar moder sight of reinforced-concrete construction, but without steel or cement. In re- cent years canvas has also been employed in the floor structure to hold the mud in place. The effect when one is on the flat roof of a Berber dwelling is a little precarious as the timbers creak and give way slightly under foot. In essence, then, the structural system is a trabeated one. Domes are extremely rare, usually restricted to the tombs of saints, and so are arches, which are employed mainly for decorative pur- poses in gates (where the inverted horseshoe motif is the usual one) or around the courtyards of kasbas or other dwellings of the wealthy. It is arguable that these motifs reflect the impact of urban centers like Fez and Marrakech: the arch is most prevalent in areas of predominantly Arab population. One has the impression, in other words, that arch and dome are grafted to the substructure of the essential, regional kit of con- structional parts. In addition to walls, cylindrical wooden sup- ports, and cross beams, the typical system includes internal cross walls and mud piers (plate 13). The former are sometimes cast in place with shuttering, though it is usual to find mud brick being used when a new partition has to be put up to divide a room. In ruined ksour one occasionally comes across one of these walls sitting precariously over a void in the level below. The mud pier is usually square in plan and used in clusters of four. Con- ceptually it is a cousin of the thick wall, a sort of wall that has been cut into. In visual terms the groups of four supports toward the center of the dwelling inevitably recall the corner towers of the larger structure. It is altogether striking that this constructional grammar, so logical in structural terms, has its other rewards in aesthetic and visual consistency between part and whole. Thus one may think of the carcass of the oasis system of construction as a thick-walled armature encasing an ever more transparent structure of free-standing supports toward the courtyard at the center. In the transition between the two, parallel walls and cross walls are often employed close to the perimeter wall to buttress it and to limit the spans, since in the typical dwelling the highest and heaviest areas of the building tend to be close to the edges. Meanwhile, toward the center, there is less accommodation above, less weight, and less need for a thick-wall system. Functional and struc- 196 t i I</page><page sequence="17">I~ ~ WILA J. R.CRI 9 Plate 13. Ruined ksar in the valley of the Dra showing typical anatomy of cross-walls, piers, and floors. tural logic work in unison to create a spatial transi- tion of telling visual power: from dark to light, from thick to thin, from the dense public wall to the lighter (in many senses of the word) heart of the house. Something must also be said about the tower as a constituent element of the ksar vocabulary (plate 14). The primary rationale for the tower is defensive, as a lookout post above the level of the trees, but it is also used for stairs and for storage bins. As a structural element, it guards the joint between two walls, for in mud architecture corners are especially vulnerable to weathering. Towers have what one might call a visual structural pur- pose, too. They supply a grand order to ksar architecture suitable to the expression of the pub- lic nature of perimeter wall, gate, and tighremt. The tight, four-square clusters of towers along the Dades gorges or the more rambling lookout forts of the Dra make stunning images on the scale of the vast surrounding landscape. The towers stand between the individual community and the exte- rior world (plate 15). The oasis habitat, then, is made from a lim- ited set of elements, which are capable of produc- ing certain consistent interrelationships between material strength, technological procedure, use, and a strong indigenous feeling for geometry. The rammed-earth system with shuttering immediately implies the use of a module. It is no exaggeration to say that any one pier or wall is related not only Plate 14. The corer tower of a tighremt.

Note placement on slightly raised ground. to similar elements in other houses, but to the proportions and geometries of the entire ksar, and even to the grid of the oasis fields. Yet within this tight scheme an incredible richness of visual ex- pression seems possible. A style and a tradition together supply the basis for making major choices in advance, so that well-tried elements can be taken for granted. In a similar way the jewelers and textile makers employ standardized motifs to create entirely personal fantasies that still work within the conventions of their art. How is the system actually put together in the construction of the ksar or of the individual dwell- ing? A great deal of research still needs to be done on the regulations and debates that precede the choice of site, the laying down of the main wall, and the placement of the individual properties. Evidently the motives may vary. When an old ksar is felt to be beyond piecemeal repair, it is aban- doned and an entirely new ksar is built some way away. Traditionally, it seems, such major deci- sions were in the hands of the elected amghar and his council. A site might be preferred because of the presence of wells, because a piece of land was easily defensible, because of the proximity of a track, or for symbolic reasons having to do with the appropriation of land or the presence of holy ground. What is not clear is how the division of labor and cost between public and private areas was usually handled. One needs to know far more, as well, about the strategic discussions preliminary to the placement of a gate and the legal aspects governing street widths. More is known about the constructional proc- ess of the dwelling within the ksar.34 The size of the plot can be ten meters square or more, de- pending on the size and wealth of the family. The owner has the constraints of the street line and the party walls, so the plan will always conform to a rectangle. Accommodation is worked out casually between owners and builders who, contrary to the "architecture without architects" mythology, are very likely to be specialists. Two principals are in charge, one each for the monolithic and for the other sorts of construction, and the gang of la- borers may include some willing relatives of the future householder. As in other compartments of life, respect for tradition is considerable. Transac- tions thus occur on the basis of assumed aspects of a dwelling type. Once the outline of the house and its walls has been fixed, the foundation boulders are set in place, protruding a little above the ground as a damp course. The mud construction work is very arduous, for it is carried out with the most rudi- mentary tools. The clay is brought to the site in large baskets on the back of a mule. Water is heaved by hand in simple buckets. The shuttering is crude but ingenious. The entire framework is known as a louh, and it consists of three base logs into which six vertical staffs are temporarily notched, three along each side of the form. The mold itself is slid between these two parallel rows of staffs and is made from planks. The lateral ends meanwhile are closed off by sliding pieces of wood. The entire system is then bound together at 198</page><page sequence="19">WILLIAM J. R. CURTIS 1 the top with thongs. The louh is usually a meter or so high; its width will depend on the intended strength of the wall. The base of a three-story house can have walls more than a meter thick; the base of a tall tighremt can be nearly twice that. In each case the top of the wall will be about fifty centimeters thick. The mud is poured into the formwork with a rich mixture of gravel and straw or dung. These materials are then pounded down with an instru- ment called an imerhoz. When the mud is dry enough, the shuttering is easily removed, except for the three "put logs" at the base, which have to be eased out. The remaining holes are then filled with mud or stones. The resulting wall surface is a rich, textured brown, with lines of holes clearly showing the progress of the work (plate 16). Thus, as in beton brut construction (inspired, I believe, by mud examples), an even, modular surface pat- tern is created. However, the touch of the hand is felt throughout the ksar in the uneven textures and the slight departures from straight lines. Plumb lines were unknown in the oasis until the French arrived, and even now the traditional method for establishing a vertical is st;ll used: the head laborer dribbles from the top of the wall! If the wall is very rough, simple scrapers are used to make joints more even. While this method of construction is cheap in terms of the readily available materials, it is costly in terms of water and human time. A team of two principals and twelve laborers may take three months to build an average dwelling in the spring and summer building season, and even longer in the winter, when mud dries more slowly. It has been calculated that from ten to twelve pourings are possible in a single day, while two thousand small mud bricks can be produced in the same time. The traditional ksar construction is predi- cated on cheap labor; it is possible that in earlier days slave populations were sometimes involved in construction as well as in agriculture. The work is divided among groups who work either with monolithic walls, with bricks, or with carpentry. When the house begins to reach its full height, thought is given to the design of the roof. The roof poles are laid in place over the perimeter and interior walls and are anchored at the ends with large loam blocks, which form either a contin- uous parapet or a sort of crenellation. Corners are even more emphatically reinforced with elements that resemble pointed ears. The roof line has to be carefully adjusted to make a slight tilt, so that the rare rainfall will run off into the gutters that have been punctured in places. The reeds and fronds are laid over the rafters, and mud is then caked Plate 16. Detail of mud wall showing formwork imprints and joints. over the whole thing in a sort of wattle and weave. A square opening has to be left over the room that will be used for the kitchen in cold weather. Some- times sealant is applied around the gutters (plate 17). The visual character of the ksar dwelling thus relies on the sensitive handling of a highly stand- ardized system of construction. The results are often very striking and powerful, even today when circular-sawn planks leave a less interesting pat- tern than their roughhewn predecessors. They ex- hibit a sense of rhythm, placement, and propor- tion, and sometimes a little touch of fantasy perhaps an abstracted hand of Fatima or a little whitewash around a window. But the aesthetic effect of the Berber dwelling, like that of the ksar in which it is embedded, comes from a just han- dling of the relationship between bold forms and simple geometrical surfaces. The varied rhythms of openings, towers, and shadows recall the syste- matic polyvalence of Berber music. The rule of the type is tight, but within it a joyous and exuberant individual expression is quite possible. TYPE, PROTOTYPE, AND VARIATION The identity and the significance of an individual type show most clearly when it is compared with other building types in the same region. In the case of the ksar, which is both a building and a town, that comparison has to be made with both its architectural and its urbanistic cousins in the northern Sahara and Atlas region. Typological definitions of these structures are WILLIAM J. R. CURTIS 199</page><page sequence="20">MUQARNAS Plate 17. Detail of gutter in mud wall showing straw binding. binding. fraught with difficulties because, in reality, there are many overlaps of use. Etymology is only par- tially valuable in unraveling them, as the same words can have slightly different meanings from place to place. The word agadir, for example, can mean "collective store" in one place, "fortress" in another, and "wall" in a third, though the first meaning is the most common.35 But since the agadir is a collective store with high walls, that does not pose too much of a problem. The basic type is found most often in the Anti-Atlas. It consists of a high stone wall wrapped around a sort of inner street with small storage cells arranged in rows along each side (fig. 6). In the Anti-Atlas the agadir may stand some way from a village on a high point. Each head of a family has keys to two C Figure 6. Variants on the plan of the agadir (redrawn after Jacques-Meunie): (A) agadir of Ikounka, Anti-Atlas; (B) agadir at Tasgent, Anti-Atlas; (C) agadir of Sidi Mbark ou Aali, Skoura, Dad/s valley. 200 A B I r e J J _. ., . W- :</page><page sequence="21">W or three little rooms in which he keeps his grain supplies. At a time of extreme crisis the building may be inhabited, but it is primarily a fortified storage bin belonging to a village, a canton, or even a subdivision of a nomadic tribe. In the last case, presumably, the agadir stores the grain that the tribe has extracted from the sedentes in ex- change for military protection. The pattern comes in many variations. At Skoura, for example, the agadir is on a less elon- gated, squarer plan, and is made of mud rather than stone.36 The space at its heart is usually regarded as sacred, and at Skoura that religious meaning is enhanced by the presence of a saint's tomb. It is only one step from this species of agadir to the tighremt, and that step involves habitation, for, as well as being a collective emblem, it can be the residence of a holy or otherwise important family (fig. 7). The increased size of the tighremt with respect to the ksar obviously reflects some- thing of its importance. In the Dades valley, for example, cantonal chiefs adapted a form of tighremt for their households.37 In this particular setting, the tighremt seems to articulate the canton network rather than just the village one. Some of the kasbas are strikingly close to tighremts in form: this may be related to the periodic swings of Berber polity toward despotism. The majority of extant kasbas were built in the nineteenth century by sharifs who sided with Glawa caids. What seems to have happened offers an intriguing case of the transformation of sym- bols: the proud, stately, and powerful imagery of the tighremt was coopted for political purposes by Figure 7. Tighremt: typical section. Figure 8. Kelaa: typical plan. groups intent on subduing the independent tribes. In matters of architectural meaning it is possible for certain levels in the iconographical complex to shift, while others stay consistent. Kasbas tended to be sited in isolation and to be decorated with more elaborate ornamentation, even when they engaged the same kit of parts as tighremts. How- ever, certain of the kasbas (for example, that of the Glawa at Taourirt or the sprawling complex at Tagontaft) were certainly and unmistakably im- perial fortresses - hybrids, as it were, between hormone-fed indigenous forms and types modeled on the fortresses of the makhzan (plate 10).38 In them a liberal use of horseshoe arches in gates and a characteristically functional arrangement around sequences of large courts speak of urban influences from the north. They included colossal households and even dungeons, and they dominated passes and access routes to the valleys. Instruments of control, they stood apart from the networks of solidarity of the southern oases. Another local cousin of the ksar is the kelaa, also a fortified village, but far less regular in form than the ksar, in part because of its typical siting in the foothills or on mountain spurs (fig. 8).39 The function of the kelaa is slightly different, too, since often it is only used for part of the year when transient herders take their flocks to pasture. Ke- laas are often perched strategically on rocks and are therefore difficult to supply with food and water. They have little of the formal clarity of the ksar, and their hierarchy of symbolic elements is WILLIAM J. R. CURTIS 201</page><page sequence="22">MUQARNAS nothing like so clear. The kelaa conforms more than the ksar does to the stereotype of the peasant mountain village, with its celullar pieces jammed together in sprawling patterns and its stepped architectural forms merging with the strata of the surrounding landscape. The type naturally tempts one to pose the question: Is the ksar a regularized kelaa, or does the matter work the other way around? In passing one might remark that in present-day Algeria the word ksar refers to a higgledy-piggledy arrangement such as one finds in the kelaa. In his study of the peoples of the Sahara, Cabot Briggs draws a distinction between two types of settlement in oases: towns set among the plantations "so that the settlement as a whole presents the appearance of a collection of gigantic, roofless rooms, with trees and vegetables growing on their floors and boxlike dwellings set in corners here and there," and towns with "the dwellings jammed together on a rocky outcrop, with their gardens and palm groves down on the bottom land."40 Evidently the ksar is of the second type rather than the first. In turn Cabot Briggs elabo- rated a typology of function, distinguishing three main sorts: towns that exist principally as exchange centers between caravans; towns that exist in the desert proper merely because they happen to stand at an intersection of routes; and, finally, towns that exist solely for the exploitation of locally concen- trated natural resources. Evidently the ksar be- longs to this third type. However, some ksour do stand on major routes through the valleys, while others play a role in the exchange of goods and information between nomads and sedentes. The key issue is the placement of the public space. For even in ksour that have active relations with the outside world, the market takes place in front of the gate, in contrast to true termini, like Ghardaia in the Mzab, where caravans come close to the heart, and where accommodation of merchandise and foreigners is of far more basic concern. Thus the ksar seems to have a number of highly distinct formal, functional, and symbolic characteristics that set it off from both its local and its more distant architectural and urban relatives. The question is why this form is most prevalent in the southern Moroccan river valleys. Part of the answer, of course, lies in the unusually close prox- imity of linear oases and open desert, but we have come by now, I hope, to be suspicious of overly simple explanations. The ksar and its nearby rela- tives all respond to these special conditions in their various ways; indeed, one cannot resist abstracting a sort of overriding genotype with high walls, dense and inward-looking cellular spaces, and gate access. Within this formula the ksar still has its own accentuation and character, which must, one guesses, be due in some degree to other influences specific to the region. The search for the origins of the ksar is a teasing exercise in speculation complicated by the lack of documentary and archaeological evidence and by the relatively recent construction of the examples that remain. This is where some of the mythical views rush in to fill the vacuum of igno- rance. One needs to be on the lookout for explana- tions guided by an ideological bias, whether of a political or an architectural kind. There is value in stepping back for a moment and reflecting on the sorts of arguments that are sometimes adduced to explain the emergence of vernacular forms. At one extreme of the spectrum is the grass-roots functionalist who maintains that the vernacular building represents a unique species so well adapted to its region that it must have grown there without outside influence, through trial and error alone. This theorist will emphasize the special local climatic and geographical condi- tions and will treat the type as a natural and inevitable answer to them. His argument is liable to appeal to the Berber separatist, since in this scheme the later encroachments of Arabization can be argued away as only a thin veneer over a truly regional form of adaptation. Toward the other end of our hypothetical spectrum is the typologist, who claims that a totally indigenous type does not exist, and who argues that all formal arrangements ultimately derive from other forms. With as little hard evidence at his disposal as the grass-roots functionalist, the typologist will look for similarities between the ksar and other fortified types brought into the region over its long and varied history. He may even agree with his grass- roots colleague that the ksar does constitute a clever adaptation to specific conditions, but his explanation will differ: he will suggest that some relevant types were simply available as models and that these were knocked about a bit to fit the new locale. The typologist will look for influences from the outside, and in the Moroccan situation he will have no trouble finding them in the invasions and legacies of Carthaginians, Byzantines, Arabs, and even other wandering Berbers. Our typologist may betray a rather snooty attitude toward the indige- nous Berber's talent for civilization, implying, as did Gautier, that the truly indigenous form of the area must be the chaotic kelaa because it stands closer to old troglodytic patterns of life, while the ksar, with its refinement, geometry, order, and so on, must reflect the impact of a superior, invading 202</page><page sequence="23">WILLIAM J. R. CURTIS 203 culture of altogether more sophisticated and ur- bane persuasion.41 Gautier found the "superior invader" in the Arab. It is not hard to guess the appeal of such an argument in circumstances where national unity has been loosely predicated on Arabization and Islamic solidarity. But one also cannot deny the imperialist overtones of the argu- ment in the totally unsupported assumption that straight lines are somehow evidence of superior mentality, wavy ones of a lower form of life. The ksar is obviously a tantalizing building type precisely because so many good cases can be made at all points along the hypothetical spec- trum. It is well attuned to specific circumstances; it has obviously grown up on the edge of a number of competing cultural entities. Surely it is possible that indigenous tendencies and imported forms blended together so well because both possessed a range of functional flexibility. It is entirely reason- able, therefore, to consider the possible proto- types brought by invaders. Perhaps reflecting a certain pan-Mediterranean tendency, Terrasse, in the thirties, emphasized the similarity of the ksar and its individual dwellings to Roman equivalents. He compared the Berber courtyard house to the roman atrium, the plan of the ksar to the castrum, the tighremt to the castellum.42 Following this suggestion, the rectangular shape, the orientation to compass points, the emphasis on gates, the division of the city into four by the main streets, and the protective system with walls and ditches (fig. 9) are indeed striking; the public open spaces of the Roman town tended to be placed toward the center, however, and it is not at all clear how the form could have been transported to the southern oases. The nearest Roman outposts were far to the north, and relations between Romans and Berbers seem to have been relatively pacific. The transpo- sition of a typical arrangement from one context to another, however, does not necessarily require geographical proximity; all that is needed is a creative hunch that a form can have relevant func- tions in new and unexpected circumstances. Ob- viously the ksar, whenever it first appeared, had to cope with some problems similar to the ones the castrum and its later Roman derivatives had to tackle. Curiously, the matter of the ksar's origin also brings up one of those Rom oder Orient controver- sies that art historians seem to enjoy, for another possible prototype is the rectangular, walled- fortress type with a frontispiece gate that had its origins, in the long run, in such grand eighth- century Ummayad sources as Qagr al-IHayr in Syria.43 This time the fertilizing agents are seen as being the Arab invasions which swept across North c~~~i~~~M M" r E D . u 1rrni 7=iiann :_r _ r t"ilP'i~SODI 1'- C L "ESl'^iuur" r--t''W ^ E S 2l -r- .[aBi^^ff7'giSrtD ^?^^'3En *-.

Here again some of the similarities be- tween ksar and hypothetical prototype are obvi- ous: the high perimeter walls, the collective ac- commodations around small courtyards, the desert habitat, and the single gate (plate 18). In Cabot Brigg's typology, however, this species of fortified dwelling is closer to the trade and interchange function than is the ksar; the urban settlement at Qasr al-Hayr had a large open space at its core. The retort may be made by our typologist that not all aspects of a source need to be transferred. In the Moroccan context the most likely intermedi- aries, in any case, would have been the fortified ribats or monasteries, which partook of some fea- tures of the invading fortress types. The problem with the Arab hypothesis is that it is altogether too vague in terms of time. Are we dealing with an insemination that took place in the eighth century, or the eighteenth? The Latin champion can jump in and say that the fortress type from Syria is traceable to Roman sources, to which the grass- roots functionalist will respond that similar circum- stances always lead to similar forms. The appeal of such a theory with its pan-Islamic overtones is liable to be considerable, however, especially at a time when Moroccan newspaper editorials speak routinely of the fraternity between farmers in the Atlas and agriculturalists in the Euphrates valley.44 Another theory, also with a vaguely political appeal in present North African circumstances, we may call the pan-African mud-cousin theory. It *i ? I: -1 WILLIAM J. R. CURTIS 203</page><page sequence="24">MUQARNAS Plate 18. Qa$r al-Hayr, Syria, early eighth century. stresses the similarities between the ksar and, say, mud dwellings in Mali, the Sudan, or the oases of Libya, with vague intimations of a trans-Saharan archetype carried here and there on the backs of camels. Its hypothesis has a slightly populist flavor, since, in its Moroccan version, the Haratin become the heroes of the piece: it is argued that the expansions of the southern dynasties toward the Sudan brought back to the Maghreb both slave laborers and ideas of Sudanese origin.45 Even though the link is altogether too ingenious, the idea must not be rejected out of hand. Here I confess to a rumination three years ago while standing in front of the Temple of Medinet Habu near Luxor in Egypt (a complex approximately three millennia old). It struck me that some nearby mud dovecotes had a similar sloping and battered form. Then it occurred to me that the symbolic elements of the Egyptian temple - the great pylon gates, the thick sloping walls, the hypostyle - were long distant relatives of the structural elements of the ksar. This hunch, when rationalized, led to the usual mimetic theory by which the origins of Egyptian monumental art are traced to the mud domestic construction of the Nile valley.46 In short, no firm statements can be made about the origins of the ksar. One can simply point to vague similarities between it and other building types near and far, then make rough guesses about paths of influence. We have not yet had a palm log raft theory to explain some obvious similarities between tighremts and the "loam skyscrapers" of the Yemen, but one will surely come in time. All the theories that have turned up concur in feeling that the ksar of the past two centuries, which we can still see, must have very old roots in tradition. It certainly encapsulates a mood of the archaic and the archetypical. Little wonder that one French romantic thought he was seeing a living equivalent to the Old Testament structures of Babylon.47 Perhaps the morphology of the ksar, like Berber civilization itself, secretes various of these foreign influences, but over a curiously untouched and integrated core. And if the kernel aspects of the type lie deep in myth-laden responses to a particular landscape, as I feel might be the case, then the genotype can be ancient indeed. But, however long the history of the ksar may be, the question remains: What will be its future? THE KSAR AND RAPID CHANGE An architectural type will only be repeated so long as it continues to serve its purposes satisfactorily, and so long as the cluster of conditions which made it a useful solution continue to have an influence. If either human intentions or external circumstances are altered, then the type will have to be stretched, modified, or even replaced. Modi- fication will be no problem if the type has some flexibility, but if the kernel aspects are threatened 204 I I</page><page sequence="25">WILLIAM J. R. CURTIS 205 then fragmentation and collapse will ensue. Nor- mally, to judge from the history of types, such a crisis will be followed by a period of searching, after which will come the creation of a new syn- thesis. The ksar is admittedly a dying form; arguably it has been for some decades. The climate of southern Morocco has not altered dramatically in the recent past; indeed, if there is one constant, this is it. The major changes have been in the social sphere and, more recently, in the techno- logical one. For those who delight in blaming all major social disruptions in developing countries on the impact of European colonization, it has to be emphasized that the ksar as a type was already under attack (literally and otherwise) in the late nineteenth century by the grand caids of the Atlas. The rise of these tyrannical rulers, some of them in league with the sultan, was a blow to the independent Berber tribes. The makhzan was now able to impose its regulation more forcibly on some areas of the Siba than it had done before. But the architectural effect was more drastic, I believe, on the tighremt than it was on the ksar. The age-old disputes between groups continued even in those areas under new domi- nation. In much of the eastern part of the region, the squabbles between Ait Atta and Ait Yafalman continued unabated. The occupation of oases and the raiding of ksour were still frequent. Patterns of survival were far too deep to be affected by any mere tinkering with systems of law or taxation. The French protectorate, established in 1912, filtered its influence south of the Atlas only gradu- ally. Although generally the French sided with the forces of the makhzan, they did see fit to restore Berber councils of law. Throughout the teens and twenties attempts were made to subdue the High Atlas tribes, but, in part owing to the inaccessibil- ity of the remote passes, with mixed results. The south was easier to control, and after the battle of Bu Gafer in 1933 the back of Ait Atta power was broken.48 With this pacification went something of the system of oppositions and alliances that had been the raison d'etre of fortification in the ksar. The French also destroyed the slave system and so gradually altered the economic basis and social hierarchy of oasis life. The motor roads which they built over the Atlas in the twenties and thirties and along the route from Agadir to Ksar es Souk (now Er-Rachidia) in the latter decade were symbols of a new network of power which remained some- what removed from the core of the cultures of the south; nonetheless these, too, exerted a subtle influence by speeding up the transmission of goods and ideas and by taking the edge off the precari- ousness of economic supply and survival. The process of absorption of the small south- ern states into the fledgling nation state was set, irreversibly, on its course. With the declaration of independence in 1956, the oasis populations found themselves firmly under centralized control. Is- lamic law was reinstated; dissension and turbu- lence were no more tolerated than they had been by the French, and, anyway, loam walls were no match for moder weaponry. The forces that maintained the meaning of the ksar were falling away one by one. A new variant began to emerge; the high wall and gate had disappeared, and free- standing dwellings were placed on a grid of narrow streets (plate 19). Aspects of the tradition suited to the climate were maintained; those that were no longer politically or socially relevant were cast off. The mosque might now sit almost anywhere. The amghar was head in a far more limited sense than before; he was either responsible to government agencies from the north or left to deal with rather trivial concerns. Economic changes also took their course. By the fifties, people of the ksar were living in a mixed economy of bartering and money, and the produce of the oases had entered a far wider field of consumption. The legendary grocers of the Sous made giant profits by selling their goods in the industrial cities of the north, but they maintained much of their culture and returned home on a sort of rotating basis. Other subtle shifts in values came with education, which by degrees produced new splits in communities between those who were literate and those who were not. Continuity in values was further threatened by an unseen source, as radio waves let in new opinions in spite of thick mud walls. In recent ksour even an occa- sional television aerial can be seen. Perhaps a future historian with a far greater distance on his subject will be able to discuss the subtle impact on peasant folklore and crafts of the sort of rationality associated with modernization. With the loss of handicraft traditions comes a loss of connection with symbol systems whose meaning may have been dimly understood yet deeply felt. Mechanization brings entirely new techniques and possibilities for coping with change. The impact of industrialization on oasis life is felt in a number of spheres. Field patterns and the shape of ownership have to be altered to accommodate more profit- able implements like the tractor. The allure of money in the cities draws away youth. Building methods themselves begin to change. Close to the roads in southern Morocco are clumsily con- WILLIAM J. R.

CURTIS 27 structed concrete frame structures of a sort famil- iar in many other parts of the world. One can even occasionally find a concrete floor or beam in a mud dwelling. It is possible that a new set of images is beginning to exert its effects, and that the Berbers may allow foreign influences to infiltrate. Tourism is bound to play its part. One can easily conjure up eery visions of a picturesque air-conditioned ksar, full of bronzed foreigners and surrounded by a bidonville of concrete shacks where live the Ber- bers, now employed as waiters. If this happens, the usual debates about the relative values of modernization and the maintenance of tradition will no doubt take place: The present conservative regime in Morocco has a sensitive appreciation of the stabilizing power of agrarian traditions and of the revolution- ary tendencies which follow all too easily when an uprooted proletariat is allowed to come into being. One wonders what may happen if mineral wealth is exploited in the Sahara or if radical ideas are allowed to topple the Moroccan status quo. Would the civilization of the oases withstand a centralized Marxist state as it did the makhzan for so long? Does Montagne's assessment, made a few decades ago, still hold good? Shall we see modem Berber society emerge from its obscurity to give birth to new African Moslem nations, owing allegiance at the same time to Islam and the West? ... Many Frenchmen ... thought ... that it would be easy to assimilate the Berbers, because they were not Arabs; many Arabs have, for twenty years at least, proclaimed the Berbers as their racial brothers because they are Moslems. It is possible that history will prove both these sets of beliefs wrong by producing in North Africa a hybrid political variety.... But for such a development to take place it is neces- sary above all for the old conservative society... to begin to wither away.... That is, in fact, what is happening, although more slowly than one would imagine, for its ability to preserve and retain appear infinite.49 Doomed or not, the ksar confronts the designer of the present with an extraordinary range of lessons. It handles a classic problem of habitation - that of achieving harmony and dif- ferentiation of the individual dwelling within the collective whole - with a stunning elegance and simplicity; it demonstrates how a local material can be elaborated into a kit of parts capable of solving a wide range of climatic, structural, and symbolic functions simultaneously. The way the ksar - or any other vernacular type, for that mat- ter - can teach is not through the imitation of its external forms - at best this will only lead to an ersatz regionalism - but at the level of underlying principle. The principles of an indigenous system of forms can only be understood if the context is examined in all its complexity, as I hope I have done here. Surely there is a level in fine architecture that transcends cultural differentiation and regional definition by confronting us with essential aspects of both a medium and the form-making intelli- gence. The ksar is so convincing because it appears to universalize from the very specific conditions in which it occurs. Ultimately, perhaps, that is where the concept of the "typical" is useful, for it lays bare the substructure of earlier thoughts and reveals certain perennial patterns. Although the ksar may return to the mud from which it came, the prodigious intellectual and symbolic structures that informed it may possibly live on, but in an utterly transformed state. HARVARD UNIVERSITY CAMBRIDGE, MASSACHUSETTS NOTES 1. Some of the mud buildings of the region may date back to the eighteenth century, but these older structures have usually been extensively rebuilt or else are in ruins. The usual pattern is one of constant re- touching and extension. It is rare to find a complex in which all parts were planned and built at the same time. 2.

In spring 1978 and spring 1981 I traveled through the southern oases. I am grateful to the Oussidi family of Ksar Igargar (province of El Rachidia, close to the River Gheris) for their hospitality and to Hassaine in particular for having acted as both guide and interpreter on numerous visits to other ksour. 10. Recently, pan-Islamic abstractions of culture have obviously had a special appeal in some quarters. They tend to ignore drastic changes in space and time and to stress too much the effect of religious belief (which is also treated monolithically and over-simply) on cultural forms. Such antihistorical exercises in propaganda are liable to be even less valuable than usual when approach- ing an architecture which is at the fringe of Islamic influence. 11. In this I concur with A. Rapaport, House Form and Culture (Englewood Cliffs, N.J., 1969). 12.

One has to be extremely cautious in translating too literally discoveries made in one part of the Berber world to another. Many of the polarities that Bourdieu explores for the Kabyle house will not work for the ksar dwelling because the typical section and plan are altogether different. How- ever, one is struck by a certain obsessively binary ten- dency in Berber thought, institutions, and architecture, and it may be that Bourdieu's insistence on the meanings of eastward orientation (toward the source of the good and the lifegiving) is relevant to the overall orientation of the ksar. 32.

The authors evidently support an Arab hypothesis for the genesis of the ksar. They argue 208</page><page sequence="29">WILLIAM J. R. CURTIS that such a regular scheme of fortification may have entered the Moroccan oases in the twelfth century (their evidence for this date is not presented). In turn they note that the "purest" ksour seem to them to occur among the Arab tribes of the Tafilalt, i.e., toward the eastern end of the region. One is curious in that case to know why this Arab genius for regularity did not mani- fest itself across Algeria, which contained only isolated areas of Berber culture, and beyond. Moreover, as stated above, it is risky to argue backwards to origins from the social and architectural evidence of the recent past. 44. I recall an article in the Moroccan newspaper Matin du Sud, written in February 1981. 45. E. Laoust, "L'habitation chez les transhumants du Maroc central, III., L'Igerm," Hesperis, Archives Berberes et Bulletin de l'Institut des Hautes-Etudes Ma- rocaines 18, p. 136. The theory of a Sudanese slave origin for the ksar will appeal to those who interpret the word vernacular to mean "common usage" and who take it for granted that discoveries work up the social ladder from the bottom end. However, I hope I have managed to demonstrate that romantic populism may interfere with understanding the manner in which the architecture of the oases was adopted by power-holding groups to articulate their stance vis-d-vis the community as a whole. Lessons probably were learned and transmitted from below and above throughout the ksar's history. It should also be pointed out that the Haratin did not possess a tribal structure, though eventually they did occupy ksour. Once again one must be aware of the difference between social structure and the idealization of a particular sort of social structure in an architectural arrangement. 46. E.
