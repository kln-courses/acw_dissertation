The annual Public Programs Award budget is $3000. The Award Committee may make a single award, multiple awards, or no awards, but prefers to make several smaller grants. A grant may not be used for courses covered by existing scholarships, for personal-enrichment travel/study programs, or as a salary for a project director; it may be used, however, for a project's other administrative costs. The project must give prominence to its CAAS funding in its publicity. At the conclusion of the project a follow-up report, including detailed accounting of expenditures of CAAS funds, must be submitted to CAAS. Applicants must be planning to continue in the field of Classics for the coming year; preference will be given to CAAS members. Applications should consist of a one-page summary description of the proposed project, and should include: * justification of the project in terms of the goals of the CAAS Public Programs Award; * a statement of other potential sources of funding; * a list of other similar awards received within the last five years. Announcement of the award(s) will be made at the April 1992 CAAS Annual Meeting. Deadline for applications is February 15, 1992. Proposals or inquiries should be directed to: Dorothy K.
