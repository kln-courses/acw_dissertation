<plain_text><page sequence="1">Marbles Are In Some Observations on the "Seasonal" Nature of Children's Games in New Zealand BRIAN SUTTON-SMITH THIS ARTICLE is based on historical and psychological research carried out in the years 1949-1950 into the unorganized or folk games of New Zealand elementary school children. The subjects of the investigation were children between the ages of seven and twelve years in a sample of thirty-five rural and urban schools. One of these schools was observed intensively over a two- year period. In addition, reminiscence material, referring to the games played between 1870o and 1950 was received from some 250 persons in various parts of New Zealand. For this particular phase of the study further information was taken by questionnaire from forty teachers' college students. The supposedly mysterious way in which children's games come and go, wax and wane; the unusual rapidity with which a season arrives, and, as if by magic, all the children are playing only marbles, or tops, or skipping has been remarked upon at great length by the romanticist of children's games. It is a favorite theme, and the complexity of the factors involved lends itself easily to mysticism. In my presence a teacher marveled at the way in which, overnight, throughout the whole country, the games were transformed and the seasons changed as if by some widespread general intuition upon the part of the children. But if the complexity of this question lends itself easily to mysticism it does not lead so easily to scientific investigation. Nevertheless, in a general way, it is possible to build up a reasonably clear picture of the manner in which it happens that today a game is "timely," it is "in season" and tomorrow it is not. It can be shown that children's play seasons result from the interaction of children's groups with a variety of influences in their environment. The influences likely to be of importance are those arising from the nature of the physical environment, its flora, fauna, and climatic changes, and those which arise from the activities of adult groups of an eco- nomic and social nature. These influences interacting with the psychology of the children's groups as determined by age, sex, and dominant interests, produce the play seasons as we know them. In this article it is proposed to select only one facet from this complex [186]</page><page sequence="2">MARBLES ARE IN 187 picture; to note some of the observations which were made during the inves- tigation about tbh. effects of "climatic" seasons on children's games today. The aim is mainly negative; to dispel the romanticist illusion referred to above. The romanticist, it should be mentioned, seldom makes it clear whether he is talking about a climatic season or a play season, meaning by the latter a group play craze or habit. Here the focus is on the climatic season. For a start it must be stated that in modern New Zealand playgrounds, the effects of the changing climatic seasons are obscured by the existence of other influences brought into being by the organization of sport by teachers and community.' Thus Rugby football begins at an arbitrarily chosen date in the autumn around about Easter, not when the feeling arrives that, "Ah! this is Rugby weather." Minor unorganized games have to adapt themselves to the conventions of this and other organized sports, in particular, cricket, hockey, soccer, tennis, basketball, and softball. Either the minor games fit into the interstices of these organized sports or they fall into desuetude. At a certain date, for example, the first football practice is arranged. There is a craze for football which affects everybody for a few weeks and the chosen teams for the rest of the fixed "season." It is only when this initial craze has died down that the younger children and the disappointed sportsmen are sufficiently free from the group enthusiasm to turn elsewhere to some other novelty. At this point climatic change may have an influence upon a dis- sentient group sated with the current organized game. But the influence of climatic change is of a general nature only, not of the specific nature indi- cated by some folklorists when they have said: "The feeling of spring in the air which made the children spin, the lambs dance, and flowers rise from the earth, brought the gay little wooden tops to the villages."2 Spring "brings the gradual lengthening daylight which is put to good use in the seasonal urge to hop, leap, and move the arms and legs to rhythmic games."' Allow- ing for the fact that these are the reports of English writers, and that in Europe the spring sometimes has "seemingly miraculous"' effects, from the New Zealand point of view, these statements express half-truths only. It may be as Huntington has claimed at some length, that the spring seasonal change does increase.human vitality." That in itself, however, is no indication of just what type of reaction human beings will take when this seasonal change arrives. In New Zealand, at least, there is no narrow determinism. To link the somewhat anthropomorphic "feeling of spring" and "seasonal urge" to- 1 It will be realized that in New Zealand, in the Southern Hemisphere, the seasons are the reverse of what they are in the United States. 2 A.

This, apparently, is also the position in parts of the United States. And here the abruptness of the climatic changes in many places more nearly approxi- mates the conditions in Europe. And yet, Lehmann and Witty, after an exhaus- tive investigation, claimed that "the bulk of the play life of the child is not subject to marked variation effected by seasonal change."' In fact, in the game of marbles, which is generally reckoned to be the most "seasonal" of games, Lehmann and Witty found children playing at all parts of the year.

From this they concluded that "playing marbles appears to be not so much a product of seasonal change as of the whims of the community."" Nevertheless it would be wrong if the impression was conveyed that the changing climatic seasons have no influence whatsoever on game "seasons." They do make a contribution. In some cases it is highly specific, as for example when boys make bows and arrows with spring willow shoots, play conkers in the autumn with horse chestnuts, which are only mature at that time, play soldiers with the heads of spring plantain grass, go swimming and fish- ing in the summer, and snowballing and skating in the winter. Usually, how- ever, the influence is of a more general nature. Consider, for example, the following chart. Forty students from Wellington Teachers' College, New Zealand, including twenty men and twenty women, were asked to indicate in what seasons, autumn, winter, spring, or summer, they had played marbles, tops, kites, skipping, hopscotch, hoops, and tires. In every case the activities were spread throughout the year, although there were certain modes for each 6 H. C. Lehmann and P. A. Witty, The Psychology of Play Activities, p. 201. 7 Ibid. 8 Ibid.</page><page sequence="4">MARBLES ARE IN 189 activity. In some cases, of course, the students had either not played the games, or had forgotten the season in which they were played. In these cases they made no report. The details on the play of each of the above games are as follows: Marbles The majority of the students' reports state that autumn and winter were the marble seasons. In addition to this information, seventeen historical re- ports' indicated that marbles were played in autumn (eight of these in con- nection with May 1); sixteen, that it was played in winter, and nine, that it was played in spring. Overseas writers vary as to the time of the year with which they associate marble playing. Daiken and Spence associate it with autumn; Norman Douglas places it in winter;" A. B. Gomme, at the end of winter;" Lehmann and Witty, in the spring." The Woolworth's toy buyer of Wellington, New Zealand (the largest chain store), corroborated the au- tumn-winter emphasis. The peak sales for marbles, he said, were between the football (autumn) and cricket (summer) seasons. The toy buyer for McKenzies (the next biggest chain store in New Zealand) claimed that peak sales for marbles were in winter. Their statements, however, applied to those prewar years when marbles were freely available. At present (1949-1950) marbles, which are always in short supply, tend to sell as soon as they come into the shops. The shortage plays havoc with the "normal" seasons. The fact that most New Zealand play has been carried on in the autumn is nevertheless commemorated by a rhyme which has been widely used, namely, The first of May, Is Smugglers' Day This rhyme is not reported by British folklorists, though the term and prac- tice of smuggling (that is, thieving marbles) are well known.' Several other New Zealand references with dates are: May 2.4th is Smugglers' Day. But this was the Queen's birthday and in this case the solitary informant may have been confusing the marble rhyme with the traditional holiday rhymes which said: Hip hip hooray For the Queen's birthday On the 24th of May.

First of May, Smuggling day, Tops are in, marbles are out. But although ten historical reports were received in which dates were cited, as in the above rhymes, ten reports were also received in which no dates were mentioned. For example: Marbles are out Smuggles about. Marbles are out Smugglers are about. Marbles are out Smuggin's about. Marbles are out Smugglers are out Dubs when the bell goes. Marbles are out Kick 'em about. The seasonal emphasis of overseas reports (mentioned above) seems to be on the winter and the spring. Overseas, marbles flourished through the win- ter and terminated in the spring, that is, round about May. In New Zealand marbles began about May (autumn) and carried on through the winter. So that the two halves of the world had in common their marbles in winter. They also had in common the month of May as a limit of the season. In England it was the end limit. In New Zealand, the beginning. In England marbles traditionally terminated on May 1, or thereabouts, and then tops came in. The one New Zealand reproduction of this situation is to be found in the rhyme above where marbles finished on September 1 (New Zealand spring) and flicks (cigarette card game) came in. But a customary New Zea- land practice was to smuggle marbles on May 1 (if that was smugglers' day), and then, instead of going on to tops, to resume normal marble playing again the next day, for, after all, the season had only just begun. It looks as if New Zealanders brought from England the habit of playing marbles in the winter and also the association with the month of May. In England May finished the season. In New Zealand May started it off.</page><page sequence="6">MARBLES ARE IN 191 The question naturally arises, why should marbles be played mainly in winter? It is clear that it can be and often is played at any time in the year. In favor of the winter one could point to the pliability of the soil and its susceptibility to marble markings and holes; to the joy children get from chasing their marbles in and out of puddles. But this could be countered in turn by reference to the dampness of the ground and the inappropriate- ness of this relatively inactive pastime to a wintry climate. The favorableness of summer and autumn warmth could, in their turn, be offset by reference to the hardness of the ground. Again, what might be said in favor of spring could be countered by reference to chilblains. In fact, as long as marbles were freely available there does not seem to have been any good climatic reason why they should have been played in one season rather than another. Almost the only valid generalization that can be made is that marbles were not very frequently played in the summer and that they were in consequence associated more with climatic coolness than with heat. Possibly it was prefer- able to play the game when the temperature was cool and the ground pliable than to play it when the ground was hard out in the midday sun. There is, however, an additional factor which may have contributed its bias toward the winter season. We know, for example, that marbles have only been manufactured during the last few hundred years; and where they were not manufactured, that the game was often played with nuts and ber- ries." In fact, Daiken suggests that this is how the game originated. If this was the case, then at one time the origin of each new marble craze would have to wait on the season of "autumnal fruitfulness.""' When the autumn nuts and berries were to hand, the game could commence and the season continue from late autumn into winter. Further, the termination of this win- ter season with May Day "smuggling" may have been associated with rapa- cious May-Day customs.'" What would it matter if one's "Taws," one's nuts and berries, were stolen, and probably eaten by others. Next season the trees would be laden with new ones. The habit of playing marbles in winter, then, may have come down from those early times preserved by nothing but the fact that groups, having a group tradition of when and where to play, tended to play each year in the same fashion as they had in the last. But such a tradition would be a light bond-a bond easily interfered with by the commerce of marbles, the migra- tion of peoples, and the dominance of organized sports. The present varied distribution of marble playing may be a reflection of all these and many other factors, operating on the basis of this archetypical "season." 14 J. Strutt, The Sports and Pastimes of the People of England (London, 18o0), p. 304. 15 Daiken, op. cit., p. 167. 16 Spence, op. cit., p. 31.</page><page sequence="7">192 WESTERN FOLKLORE Tops Authorities on tops overseas almost universally place top playing in the spring and associate it with ancient spring rituals.' There can be little doubt, however, that in New Zealand it was played mainly as a winter game. In most cases its onset followed the flagging of interest in football just as the onset of marbles followed the waning of interest in cricket. A New Zealand toy buyer stated that the commercial peak was in early winter. There were three historical reports of the season being in autumn; seventeen in winter, and five in spring. Two reports specified that whip tops were played in the winter and peg tops in the summer. The other reports referred to peg tops. Skipping This is a warming activity and takes its place fairly decisively in the cooler months of winter. Wet weather, however, acts prohibitively on it as wet ropes are likely to have a punishing effect upon the imperfect player. The New Zealand commercial peak is in winter. Overseas authorities again place its occurrence in the spring." One historical report placed it in autumn, ten in winter, and one in spring. Hopscotch This game has also a tendency to flourish in winter but this is a modal tendency far less marked than with the other games. Hopscotch, with its wait- ing players, is a game which has its leisurely aspects. Children often report playing it at home irrespective of the fact that it is not "in" at school. Hop- scotch is generally placed in the spring by overseas writers. There is one New Zealand historical report of it being played in autumn, five in winter, and four in summer. Kites At first sight kite flying might appear to provide the clearest example of seasonal influence amongst the games being discussed here. Most reports state that kites was played in March and September and many informants claimed that playing with kites at these times was connected with the equinoctial winds of March and September. However, Kimble and Bush in The Weather state that "nowhere will you find much support for the popular idea that strong winds and gales are particularly common round the spring equinox.... Or the autumnal one for that matter."'9 It is probable then that the flying of kites 17 A. C. Haddon, The Study of Man (London, 1898), p. 255- s H.

This was brought out clearly in the students' lists. Many students explicitly mentioned making their kites in the May, August, and December vacations.

All the Woolworth shops in the main centers were approached to find out at what times in the year they sold the greatest number of kites. Their replies show very clearly the holiday appearance of the games. Conclusion This study of the effects of climate on children's play seasons or group crazes has sought to show that in general climatic influence on these activities is essentially limited; and, in consequence, that there is little merit in the romanticist's claim that spring or any other climatic season has a magical effect upon children's games.</page></plain_text>
