Nonetheless, the es- says, each interpreting congregations from par- ticular perspectives, are generally interesting m their own right. They include Brooks Holifield's survey and typology of changing conceptions and forms of the congregation in American history; Warner's sociological analysis of types and functions of congregations in contempo- rary America, including the aforelnentioned de act congregationalism; Langdon Gilkey's proS posal regarding altemative ways, based on dif- ferent ecclesial traditions, for recovering and nurturing a vital religious center in congrega- tions; Martin Marty's analysis of the public and private roles of congregations and proposed alternative to privatization and mediating struco ture theories in the image of congregations as "meeting places;" Bass's suggestive use of the work of Alasdair MacIntyre to ask how the congregations described in Volume 1 are bear- ers of tradition, giving local? culturally erlmeshed expression to great transnational traditions; and Don Browning's focus on congregational study as a form of"descriptive theology" and a con- tributor to the larger enterprise of "critical pracS tical theology*" Jay Dolan and Robert Franklin round out Volume 2 with essays on congregaS tional leadership: Dolan traces both Protestant and especially Catholic struggles over clergy versus lay control in parish and congregational life; and Franklinhighlighz the distinctive roles and types of pastoral leadership within black congregations, seeing such leadership as undero standable only in the context of black congregao tional culture. Both volumes begin with introductory chapters by the editors. The introduction to Volume 2 provides a particularly usefil over view of the history, recent though it is, of congregational studies. It is impossible to comment here in any detail on the merits and limitations of such a complex work. As in any collection, there are stronger and weaker contributions. Perhaps two general comments are in order: F*st, the work should be widely read by sociologists? historians, and others interested in American religious history. It will be difficult any longer to justify writing oS congregations as unimportant or irrelevant as one explores many aspects of American society. My second comment is more a reminder of a possible misperception that the volumes permit than a serious criticism. While de facto congregationalism is not arguable, ie volumes at times so privilege local congrega- tional forms that one might conclude that other religious expressions beyond local assemblies are of little significance, whether histoncally or in the present. That would be a mistake that the editors, I am certain, would not encourage. Various connectional structures (including muchSmaligned denominations), hierarchies, special purpose organizations, and loosely orga nized small groups must also be included to round out the picture This said, congregations are rightly the focus of these two volumes, and the attention given them is long overdue. One hopes that a paperback version is on the way that will make this valuable work more accesS sible tO a wide audience. Jackson W. Carroll Duke Uni(Jersity Faces in the Clouds: ANew Theory of Religxon, by STEWART EUIOT GU ruRlE. New York: Ox ford University Press, 1994, 290 pp. Can$: 44.50. S. E. Guthrie did not take Sesus's advice when planning this book. He has erected an intellectual edifice whose rooms are filled with delightful and provocative insights. Yethe built it on tautological sand. Like all such unstable castles, readers can learn much by visiting, but only the desperate will want to live there. Guthrie provides us with what he says is a new theory of religion. It is quite simple. He notes that humans survive by avoiding big risks. As we walk across the hillsides of life, we ersS counter things that could be either boulders or bears. If they are boulders but we treat them as</page><page sequence="2">BOOK REVIEWS 103 bears, we will seem paranoid but will otherwise not lose much. If, on the other hand, they are bears but we treat them as boulders, we will discover too late that we are not at the top of the food chain. Though there are more boulders than bears, it is clearly better to be paranoid than to be eaten. Guthrie argues that human evolution built this bias inter our senses; from hence it has come to structure our thinking. We see the inanimate world as having animate properties, and we then turn that animation into beliefs about beings that are not there. More generally, as humans are the most complex and danger- ous? beings around, we perceive the world anthropomorphically. We attribute human com plexity to simple objects and greater power to weak ones. Religion results from our tendency to see faces in the clouds and to think of them as gods. Though gods do not exist Guthrie is a thoroughgoing naturalist our belief in them stems from the same perceptual processes that protect us from bears and from other humans. The result is an updated form of Pascal's wager. Pascal urged us to wager God's existence, because an erroneous belief in the altemative would bring eternal daxnnation. Guthrie says that our neurosystem wagers for us, incorrectly but at little cost. Religious anthropomorphism is a by-product of an evolutionary heritage that protects us from the world's very real dangers. We are not trapped by this anthropomorphism -otherwise atheism would not be an option but our perceptual biases lead easily to anthro- pomorphic beliefs that falsely attribute order and meaning to the world. ForGuthrie, religion is merely the culmination of a perceptual strat- egy that served our ancestors well for millennia. The first part of this book strikes down or relativizes other theories of religion and gives us the general outlines of Guthrie's approach. The central (and best) part contains a discussion of anthropomorphism in perception, in art, in philosophy, and in science. The last revisits and restates his views about the anthropomorphic origins of religion. All are wide ranging and erudite, if repetitious. There are many nuggets here. Especially noteworthy are the chapters on perception and art. Unlike many previous theoS rists, Guthrie takes the findings of recent per- ceptual psychology seriously. From the acts of toddlers to advertising to architecture to litera ture, we do seem to attribute human action to non-human things. At least, we enjoy doing so in creative play. To argue that anthropomor phic play shows that the gods are similarly anthropomorphized, however, is another mat ter. So where's the sand? Theorists of religion from Feuerbach to Stark and Bainbridge have similarly reduced religion to natural processes. Guthrie's account is at least as good as the former's theory of projection and better than the latter's theory of "compensators." If one assumes that religion is in essence a belief in unreal supematural persons, then Guthrie's ac- count attributes these beliefs to human evolu tion, not to stupidity. Surely this is progress. The problem is that Guthrie defines reli gion to fit his hypothesis, thus producing a tautology. His most annoying chapter is his first, which tries to justi* his intellectualist/ substantivist approach. He covers all the mod- em social-scientific players, from Schleier macher to Robin Horton, but does so unevenly. Those whom he dislikes get short shrift, those whom he likes get better treatment. He airily dismisses the central points of those with whom he disagrees, often misunderstanding them in the process. One of his criticisms of Durkheimian functionalism, for example, rests on an unac- knowledged shift between two definitions of the moral sphere (pp. 17-18). Such philosophic shoddiness is all too common. Clifford Geertz somewhere remarks that such a prior1 definitions constrain thought more than they stimulate it. Most attempts to provide a unitary theory of religion, including this one, fail to see that religion is a fuzzy set rather than one identifiable thing. Were Guthrie to look at what people are actually doing when they areligify" (to create a term whose very awkward- ness echoes the multifacetedness of its object), he rnight see that perception-based anthropo- morphism is but a small part of the picture. At base, the problem is epistemological. Guthrie says that religion is false because it is anthropomorphism about the Ultimate, to ap- ply a Tillichian term. Yet we cannot know whether a worldview falsely attributes human- like meaning and order to the Ultimate unless we can somehow stand outside of that utorldview</page><page sequence="3">104 SOCIOLOGY OF RELIGION and see whether it is mistaken. To do this, we need a well grounded worldview to stand on. Yet as James McClendon has pointed out, any worldview, including our own, is ultimately based on faith. Guthrie would like to divide worldviews into false anthropomorphic faiths and true non anthropomorphic ones. To do so requires omniscience, hardly one of those faculS ties that God has granted us. James V. Spickard University of RedEmds Sex, P7iests, and Power: Anatomy of A Crisis, by A. W. RICHARD S1PE. New York: Brunner/ Mazel Publishers, 1995, xiv + 220 pp. $24.95. A. W. Richard Sipe, an ordained Roman Caiolic priest, now retired from active miniso try and a psychotherapist, has written this book as a companion piece to his earlier A secret world: Sexuality and the search for celibacy (Brunner/Mazel, 1990). That previous volume was much more statistical, examining the reS sults of interviews with hundreds of priests and many more with other persons who possessed first-hand knowledge of the sexual/celibate ad- justment of Catholic priests (over 1800 respon- dents altogether) . The latter topic in A secret life subsumed a wide range of behaviors, from ho- mosexual andheterosexual practices (including affairs with women parishioners and fellow clergy, pedophilia, and ephebophilia) to mas- turbation, pomography, transvestism, bestial- ity, exhibitionism, and even AlDS. Celibacy as institutionalized in the Church of Rome and the former's correlates formed the foci of Sipe's earlier volume. In Sex, p7iests, andpowerSipe's focus shifts to the more sociological lens of organizational power. Specifically, the author examines how the Roman Catholic Church is caught up in an "epic crisis" (the author's words) between, on the one hand, an allegedly celibate clergy that more often than is known betrays its ideals and, on the other, an increasingly cynical, aggres- sive, and at times exploited laity. The recent 1980s-1 990s scandalsofpriestly pedophilia, maintains Sipe, are primarily symp- toms of a flawed, unraveling, ecclesiastical power structure, one that no longer can even replace its own clergy. Ultimately, as Sipe wrote in his first book, the problem continually returns to the system of celibacy which began with Rome's proclamation after the Second Lateran Council in 1139 that celibacy be a requirement for . . . Orolnatlon. Sipe's prognostications are ominous (and despite his clinical orientation, he provides supportive statistics from a number of credible sources). True, clerical celibacy of a majority versus the hypocrisy and double lives of just some clergy might be one thing. But the wide- spread sexual corruption of vast proportions of the Roman Catholic ecclesia is another. And the issue of a rapidly growing homosexual ele- ment in the clergy aside, the statistic that per- haps as many as one-half the clergy at any given time are not living up to their vows bodes poorly for the Church in the next century. Meanwhile, an outraged laity is being sen- sitized and mobilized, not just to form victims' advocacy groups, but also to become punitive against its Church, with disastrous financial consequences for the latter. At the same time, Sipe draws on current research (including his own) to remind the reader that there is a broader pattern behind the recent pedophilia scandal. As he notes (p. 45): 'sFour times as many priests involve themselves with adult women, and twice the number of priests involve themselves with adult men." Sociologists can (and have) been critical with psychotherapist Sipe's methodology. He does not possess random sample survey data but rather extensive samples of convenience and judgmental samples of clinical studies gathered over one-and-one-half decades. After all, he is not a survey researcher, but in reply, what do his critics have to counter his estimatesw Sipe has been studying and formulating estimates and warnings for an uninterested, nonresponsive ecclesiastical audience since the mid-1970s.</page></plain_text>
