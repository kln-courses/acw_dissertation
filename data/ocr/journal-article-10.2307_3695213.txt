<plain_text><page sequence="1">'Rats are people, too!' Rat-human relations re-rated BIRGITTA EDELMAN Birgitta Edelman is Research Associate at the University of Durham. Her PhD, Shunters at work: Creating a world in a railway yard (1997, Dept. of Social Anthropology, Stockholm University) is a study of a group of railway shunters who are responsible for the manual task of assembling carriages to form trains. As aformer shunter herself she based her study on participation as well as observation. Her subsequent research has focused on the comparison of solidarity patterns, and the interpretation of rules and regulations in the US and Sweden, the acceptance offemale shunters, and the role of body language in manual work. Her interest in rats was sparked by the family's pet rat, Luah. The fact that such an enchanting and loving little creature could throw grown men, and women, into convulsions was a puzzle screaming for an answer. The brown rat, also called the Norway rat (Rattus norvegicus), is present in almost all human settlements on the globe. The physical proximity between the rat and the human animal does not, however, imply an easy relation- ship. On the contrary, for rats human encounters are dan- gerous, not to say deadly. Rats have been seen as vermin, and they have been killed for food, killed as a sport, or killed after having served as tools for experiments in labo- ratories. They have also been killed since they have been seen as carriers of infection and disease and a sign of unhygienic conditions and poverty in general. In 1898 Simond showed experimentally that rats could spread fleas infected by the bubonic plague bacterium (Yersinia pestis), and since then the rat has been considered the carrier of plague. (The information that dogs and cats may carry such infested fleas, and that cats can also carry the bacteria themselves, has spread much more slowly among the public.)' However, as Brian Morris, following Roy Willis, has pointed out, all human cultures show a structural comple- mentarity in their attitudes towards nature and animals. Conflict between human and animal does not come without simultaneous recognition of continuity and com- monality (Morris 2000). Human-rat relations might be one of the most extreme examples of such ambiguity, since despite all the animosity, some humans also enter very tender and caring relations with rats. In the case of human-rat relations the 'complementarity' is threefold rather than dualistic, a phenomenon Morris has described in relation to Malawian attitudes to animals and nature (Morris 2000). I shall therefore look at three dif- ferent areas of human-rat relations in the Western world: those where rats are seen as lovable (pets), detestable (pests), and scientifically 'neutral' (laboratory animals), respectively.2 I offer a brief historical overview to show that the devel- opment of each area of human-rat relations has an inner dynamic and a momentum of its own. Even though the dif- ferent areas are not hermetically isolated from one another, they are still surprisingly independent, each one relating more closely to changes in the general cultural concep- tions of nature and animals than to the others. -~~m; -?BkL~YPlsPAI~T--I!

It tolerates lower temperatures than the black or ship rat (Rattus rattus), which was already well established at the time of its arrival, and this is often quoted as the reason why the brown rat managed to compete success- fully with and eventually outnumber the black rat. Sometimes the brown rat is decribed as aggressive, actively exterminating the black rat (Rackham 1979), but breeders with experience of both species tend to describe the brown rat as more complacent and 'laid-back'3 (Jordan Fig. 1. 'The rat-killer', 1632, etching by Rembrandt. 1. The WHO reports between 1000 and 3000 cases of plague annually, worldwide. In the US the most common carriers of the disease are California ground squirrels and their fleas. Domestic animals such as dogs and cats, which may easily come into contact with small flea-carrying wild animals, are obvious risks for humans. (CDC.

Ratting as a sport was a short-lived fancy, but it clai- med tens of thousands of rats a year (From Mayhew 1967) Fig. 4. Jack Black, Her Majesty's Ratcatcher Killing rats, breeding pet rats, and studying the varieties and habits of rats were all integrated within Black's business. (From Mayhew 1967) 2000a, Robinson 1979, Twigg 1975). Today the black rat is rare and a protected species in many parts of Europe. When talking about 'rats' it is therefore generally the common brown rat people have in mind, since it is this rat that one finds in the wild, kept as a pet and used as a labo- ratory animal. In this paper I shall therefore take 'rat' to equal the brown, Norway rat. The three identities of the rat mentioned above - as vermin, pet and laboratory rat - seem incompatible, but they can all be traced back to Victorian London, where the three of them can be said to have found a meeting place in the parlours of two respected gentlemen. The well known chronicler Henry Mayhew describes rat sports, rat-killers, rat-tamers, and rat-breeders under the rubric 'The destroyers of vermin' in his monumental work London labour and the London poor. Mayhew (1967) presents interviews with two men who were involved in businesses involving rats during the first part of the 19th century. These two men were Jack Black, 'Her Majesty's Ratcatcher', and Jimmy Shaw, innkeeper and owner of the largest rat pit in London. Jack Black, certified as rat exterminator to the queen,4 caught and destroyed rats by appointment (Fig. 4). Dressed in a home-made 'uniform' he perambulated the London streets with a cart, peddling his 'composition', an allegedly very potent rat poison, to the public. Besides the poison his cart also carried a cage full of rats, and one of the popular features of Mr. Black's sales show was his fearless handling of these rats and the poisoning of one of them in front of his audience. In addition to killing rats Jack Black also collected live rats for the ratting sport that the other gentleman, Jimmy Shaw, arranged for the customers at his public house. Jimmy Shaw was also supplied with tens of thousands of i i. v \\-pr r, 4 (i : --- i ;-~?r~t-~ c" ~ .' ,C -i~-L--- --- -- I ?r, .r `` ~-7~2 ,"= L ~C---~S`_~t~;-r ~-~;i4~ -"t 4-- -- (D a, w rats a year by 'barn-door labouring poor' in the country- side. These rats were then sold by the hundred to dog owners, who had the rats dropped into the purpose-built pit, into which their dogs were then introduced (Fig. 3). Egged on by the audience, the pit-dogs5 set to work, killing the rats in a frenzy. In the mid-19th century there were about 40 rat pits in London (Mayhew 1967), but ratting turned out to be a shortlived fancy and had already been prohibited by the 1870s. Rats were described as 'contemptible and poisonous warmint' by these Victorian men. It may therefore seem surprising that certain rats were acceptable enough to be kept in the home, but both Jimmy Shaw and Jack Black bred rats of different colours and sold them as pets. Considering the high turnover of animals in the rat trades, these gentlemen must have had ample opportunity to find irregularly coloured rats among the masses, oddities that were selectively bred, producing offspring that could be sold for higher profit than their plain cousins which ended up in the pits. Jack Black told Mayhew: 'I've sold many [bred varieties] to ladies for keeping in squirrel cages', and Jimmy Shaw was particularly proud of a white specimen in his possession, saying he hoped he would be able, 'with time and trouble' to breed white rats. 2. Clinton Sanders talks about the 'sociogenic identity' of the dog as a result of the understanding relationship between a caretaker and his/her dog (Sanders, 1993). I have not used Sanders's term here, since I believe that the identity of the rat is shaped in the sphere of ideas and imagination more than in everyday interaction. 3.

Judge Val Brown inspects a rat in the 'pet class' at an exhibition in Telford, England, 9-10 September 2000. Ir V; White rats were at that time considered 'freaks of nature', as Jimmy Shaw put it, and quite marketable as curiosities. Other colours than white seem to have been produced as well, since Jack Black boasted: 'I've bred the finest collection of pied rats which has ever been knowed in the world. I had above eleven hundred of them - all war- iegated rats, and of a different specie and colour, and all of them in the first instance bred from the Norwegian and the white rat, and afterwards crossed with other specie.6 I have ris some of the largest tailed rats ever seen. I've sent them to all parts of the globe, and near every town in England. When I sold 'em off, three hundred of them went to France.' (Mayhew 1967) We can thus conclude that by the end of the 19th century the rat had established a dual identity as both dangerous vermin and cherished pet. Edgar Allan Poe (1978) used the vermin identity to horrify his readers, while Beatrix Potter dedicated her book 'Samuel Whiskers' to her pet rat 'Sammy, the intelligent pink-eyed representative of a per- secuted (but irrepressible) race, an affectionate little friend and most accomplished thief.' (Potter n.d.) The legendary rat-fancier and British eccentric Miss Mary Douglas kept the rat banner high during the first two decades of the 20th century, organizing shows and encour- aging youngsters to take up rat-breeding. She managed to raise enough interest to make the National Mouse Club (NMC) accept rats in their statutes in 1912. After the death of Miss Douglas in 1921 the rats were out in the cold again, losing their status in the NMC, and the rat did not regain its popularity as a pet until the 1970s (Mays 1997). Today there are fancy rat societies in most of the northern European countries, Japan, Australia and the US. There are magazines, shows and a lively exchange of pic- tures and advice on the internet. However, to the modem fanciers Jack Black is considered to be 'the originator of the first, true domestic rats' (Mays 1997), and it matters little whether Black's rats are the real ancestors of the modern pet rats, or whether Black is simply the earliest known breeder of fancy rats. What counts is his pioneering appreciation of the lowly animal. The laboratory rat The first known experiments performed on rats date back to 1856 in France, and in the following decades there were experiments involving rats in England as well as in Germany. It is not entirely inconceivable that the rats used in French laboratories originated from Jack Black's export of 300 rats across the Channel. The cradle of the modern lab rat is, however, considered to be the Wistar Institute in Philadelphia. The researchers at Wistar initially used wild rats, but switched to albinos in 1895. It has been suggested that these rats were brought from Geneva by Adolf Meyer, a Swiss neuropathologist, but it has never been positively established whether this was the case or whether the American albinos were local mutants (Lindsey 1979). There remains the curious possi- bility that a good part of the world's albino laboratory rats, just like some of the present fancy rats, can trace their genealogy back to rats bred by Jack Black and Jimmy Shaw. The reason for the predominant use of white or albino rats in labs remains uncertain. Size, easy handling and quick reproduction constitute some of the most quoted advantages of rats bred for experimental purposes and since domesticated rats, naturally including whites and albinos, are smaller and more affectionate, mature sooner and die earlier than their wild cousins (Robinson 1979), it seems likely that the albino variety was initially chosen because it was 'experiment-friendly', and not because its colour matched the laboratory environment. Like the transition from vermin to pet, the transition from vermin to the lab represented a dramatic advance in the social identity of the rat. Lindsey (1979) writes in The laboratory rat: '[...] the story is literally one of ascen- dancy from the gutter to a place of nobility, for what crea- ture is more lowly than the rat as a feral pest or more noble than the same species which has contributed so much to the advancement of knowledge as the laboratory rat!'. Good-natured rodent or venomous beast? The word 'disgust' entered the English language in the 17th century, but according to Stallybrass and White it was only in the Victorian era that disgust came to be associated with the lower parts of the body. The rejection and abhor- rence of everything connected with bodily functions from the waist down was also, according to these writers, reflected in the topography of cities like London and Paris, where covered sewers were constructed in order to hide and dispose of the refuse, and new streets and boulevards were built to clear away the unsanitary waste and the dirt - including the lower classes, the 'great unwashed'.7 The homological relations between low and elevated, dirty and clean, respectable and disgusting were inscribed in the new rules for hygiene, dress, manners, taste, lifestyle and architecture. Cities were made light and hygienic, pleasing and spectacular to, above all, the middle classes, who now took pleasure in strolling and observing, as well as dis- -i j? : .?~c~s~ii~c i i * ~W ~?

Bearing in mind that these were the dominant rat in Europe right up to the late 18th century, most of the traditional European idea of the ferocious rat is based on Rattus rattus, not on poor little fubsy inoffensive Rattus norvegicus.' (Jordan 2000b) 4. Black said that he was certified by the Board of Ordinance and his door bore the sign: 'J. Black, Rat Destroyer to Her Majesty' (Mayhew 1967). 5. Despite the pit-dogs being described as 'terriers' and 'pit- bulls' they were not the same as their namesakes of today. (The American pit bull terrier (APBT) FAQ. http://www.nyx.net/ -mbur/apbtfaqover.html) 6. Shaw and Black distinguished between different kinds of rats and we find designations as 'barn rats', 'water rats', 'blood rats' ('a dreadful, spiteful feller'), and 'sewer rats' (Mayhew 1967). 7. We are here talking about the construction of class through what has been called the 'geography of the nose'. For a more detailed discussion of the class structure of 'smellscapes', see Classen et al. 1994, Macnaghten and Urry 1998, Stallybrass and White 1986. 8. Mayhew notes that his interviewees use the words 'sewer' and 'shore' interchangeably (Mayhew 1967). For our purpose a confusion between the two matters little, since the sewers had their outlets at the shores, which were generally used as dumps. 9. Miller criticizes the theory presented by Douglas that polluting things are matter out of place (Douglas 1980), on the grounds that it is tautological. Miller concludes: '... most things that disgust fit rather Fig. 10. Cover of a book for rat enthusiasts.

The mall and the boulevard shaped, and were shaped by, the 'flaneur'. 'Picturesque' and 'sublime' were the words of the day (Green 1992, Urry 1990). In this new cleansing enterprise the fate of the rat was rather obvious. Being an inhabitant of the sewers,8 and as such belonging to the dirty and disgusting world which ought to remain unseen, unsmelled, and preferably also unmentioned, the rat was to be exterminated or expelled.9 Rats are agile creatures, even if their ability to penetrate and invade houses and secure spaces has often been widely exaggerated. However, the image of such a polluting trans- gression, of hordes of rats coming out of sewers, wells or catacombs in order to attack and spread disease is then also a picture of the potiential threat posed by the labouring classes. Masses of rats provoke disgust, while we saw that a single rat could be accepted as a pet, provided that it was cleaned and well presented, and preferably also 'dressed up' in fancy fur colour. The single pet rat in its squirrel cage was a cute curiosity and token of the natural 'other', just as Eliza is the charming, natural, working class spec- imen for Professor Higgins in Pygmalion.'o The accept- ance, and in carnivals even celebration, of excluded elements is called 'inversion' by Stallybrass and White. Inversion may thus momentarily reverse the orientation of the hierarchical order, but it nevertheless relies on an acceptance of the binary categories and of the ranking that constitutes that order (Stallybrass and White 1986). If we see the demonization of the rat as a corollary of the separation, rejection and disgust of the lower parts of the body, city and society - in short, of the processes of clas- sification that culminated in the Victorian era - we must ask how the rat fares today, when political order and social hierarchy can no longer be depicted as a simple dichotomy. William Miller talks about this change as 'democratiza- tion', and sees contempt as more assimilable to democracy than disgust." Disgust stands for downward rejection, while contempt can be directed upwards and towards the side as well as downwards and is 'readily available for everyone' in democracy (Miller 1998). Is the rat as a consequence today de-demonized, de-dis- gusted in the same way that previously rejected social cat- egories - women, the handicapped, racial and religious minorities, etc. - are finding increasing acceptance? Is the rat now less of a venomous beast and more of a neutral (perhaps even good-natured) small rodent that has the right to exist - in its proper place, of course? Miller seems to deny this, saying that since the rat was marginalized before the Victorian era and before the sewers, it will remain so, independently of the historical moment. He thereby misses the point he himself makes in connection with his theory of disgust; that verminhood, contempt and disgust do not necessarily coincide (Miller 1998). Thus, saying that the rat was 'marginalized' and considered vermin long before it became an inhabitant of the sewers is not identical with saying that it was disgusting. It became disgusting only in the 19th century - and was then blamed for the plague, not the other way around. We can observe two trends in the identity of the rat today. One trend is found in the horror genre, in films, books and cartoons where the demonized rat often plays the role of enhancer of disgust (Hodgson 1997). In the world of fiction the rat has become a symbol of evil, much as the dove is a symbol of peace, and the owl a symbol of wisdom. Arguments from ethology, saying that doves are all but peaceful towards each other, that owls are no wiser than jackdaws, or that rats are clean as cats and playful as dogs, are of no avail. The identity of the rat as a symbol for dirt, disease and evil aggression has taken on an independent existence, dif- ferent from, even impermeable to, the opposite trend, which absorbs arguments from biology and tends towards a 'normalization' or 'naturalization' of the rat into an 'ordinary' animal. This trend is the more general one, since it can be observed in all the three identities of the rat; i.e. the rat as pet, lab animal and vermin. I shall present examples of this trend from each of the fields. My exam- ples are taken from the internet, which today is the medium where the three otherwise isolated fields have found a virtual meeting place. Effects of the normalizing trend The field most exposed to the democratization trend is the field that lives on the image of the rat as dangerous vermin, the vermin exterminating business. In the light of what we know today, it is difficult to defend the view that the rat is a disease-carrying pest of a different magnitude from pigeons, sparrows, mice, or other rodents. It has also become evident that the frequency and size of rat colonies is directly related to careless and improper handling of produce, as well as refuse, and that removing rats without removing their food source only gives any remaining rats ample opportunity to raise large, healthy families. An Italian advertisement for ceramic rat-traps may therefore strike us as rather dated when it presents the rat as a dangerous monster. Two pictures accompany the mes- sage, one depicting a 'cute' cartoon rat holding a bunch of flowers, and the other one a dark 'naturalistic' rat, which, ready for attack, faces the viewer (Fig. 13). The legend under the first picture says: 'The rats we are concerned with are very, very different [i.e. from the cute cartoon character]...' The legend of the second picture announces: '...They are frightening. They steal, pollute, soil, infect us, and.., sometimes they kill us!' Rats are not only depicted Fig. 11 Left: The cover for The Coming of the rats by George H. Smiths illustrates the horror of a rat attack (Van Nuys: Pike Books, 1961). Fig. 12 Right: Ralph Meeker is overcome by a giant rat in Food of the gods, directed by Bert I. Gordon, 1976. well... It is not that things don't fit; it is that they fit right at the bottom of the conceptual grid.' (Miller 1998: 44-5) 10. A longer discussion of the Pygmalion phenomenon will appear in Edelman (forthcoming). 11. Though not fully content with the term 'democratization', I shall use it in the broad sense I understand that Miller does, as a term for the gradual dissolution of the dichotomy between upper and lower classes. According to Miller this dissolution is accompanied by tolerance and neutrality (a 'live and let live' attitude), rooted in the democratic system which, after all, claims that all individuals have equal rights and duties (Miller 1998). 12. These figures and trends are contested. Andrew Rowan writes that laboratory animals in the US have decreased by 50% since the late 1960s. Statistics from Sweden show conflicting trends. While the number of test animals has remained close to 500,000 per year between 1990 and 1998, there is an increase in the use of fish, but a decrease in 'other carnivores' (i.e. dogs, cats and ferrets). The number of rats has decreased slightly while the number of mice has increased. The two groups together made up 68% of the Swedish test animals in 1998 (Centrala F6rs6ksdjursnimndens skriftserie 1989-99). However, the Swedish definition of 'test animal' is broader than the EU one, which is based on the effect of the test upon the animal, while the Swedish definition is based on the purpose of keeping the animal and therefore includes animals that are used in behavioural or psychological studies. Using the EU definition, there were only 350,000 test animals in Sweden in 1991, decreasing to 325,000 in 1999 (Centrala Firs6ksdjursndimnden. Statistik). 13. For a summary of the development of using animals in research, see Mukerjee 1997. 14. Recent examples of this new trend include Burman &amp; Mendl 1999. The view of the rat as a genetic container and an animal that can/should be standardized as much as possible still dominates. A good examnple of this is Pearce 2001. 15. Similar thoughts on human-animal understanding can be found in Coy 1988. 16. The phrase is found in a 'ratty' homepage, 'Rats are people, too' http://www.geocities.com/ BourbonStreet/3518, 19.06.2001 6 ANTHROPOLOGY TODAY VOL 18 NO 3, JUNE 2002</page><page sequence="5">DERATTIZZAZION E TECNICHE OPERATIVE E METODICHE ATTE A GARANTIRNE I RISULTA TI EFFICACI ANCHE ALL'APERTO E SENZA PERICOLO PER PERSONE, ANIMALI DOMESTICI ED INQUINAMENTO DELL'AMBIENTE.

There is no hesita- tion over the death penalty in this advertisement. Anticimex, the largest Scandinavian exterminator enter- prise, on the contrary avoids such simplistic demonized imagery. Vermin are here depicted as 'animals out of place' rather than venomous beasts. Anticimex write: 'All animals have their place in the ecological system. Even the so called skadedjur (= vermin, literally 'harmful animals'). In nature they are just as useful as all other species... At times some animals happen to be interested in things that we humans want to keep or use ourselves... That is when we start to call them skadedjur.'(Anticimex, my translation and emphasis.) Anticimex describe nature as a 'system' where every animal has a rightful 'place'. However, the description seems to imply that the world of humans is something sep- arate from the ecological system, a space that we have the right to defend against invading nature. There is an apolo- getic and regretful tone to the message, leaving us con- vinced that Anticimex kill animals only when it is absolutely 'necessary'. We are not surprised to find that Anticimex also recommend preventive measures, stressing that they 'continuously search for alternatives to chemical pesticides'. The business profile of Anticimex is, in all, well adapted to the democratization process and the contemporary ecological trend. The latter is a natural corollary of the former, since the ecological view is based on a collapsed view of a hierarchy in nature. We have a 'balance' of equally important animals and organisms, not an animal 'kingdom' with higher and lower species. The field least exposed to the democratization trend is the world of the fancy rats. The pet rat is naturally already, by definition, accepted and lifted above the category of vermin. It is seen as an individual, not as a group or mass, and as such it cannot easily be subject to generalizations. It exists as an exception rather than as a rule. What is true of my pet rat is not necessarily true for rats in general. To a certain extent all pets are little purified 'Elizas' rather &lt;&gt; &gt; K1 ENVIRONMENTAL 0 O0 &lt; FACTORS 0o O c _- 0 0 0 n 0 t&gt; Temperature 0 F rood 0 St / GN- - O ) o 4A'[Humidity 1&gt; H /'GENEI C S Lghting Ft ' I&gt;FACTORS \ t ( J4wInsecticides Noise wo o Pheromones \ %U;) t " Chemiccais Population[ '- . i j' "0 f-  , P\athogens N 3 ,O O- MICROBIAL r -L , - than merely domesticated animals. We can therefore pre- dict that the 'normalization' process would leave the pet rat rather unaffected, but there is nevertheless a tendency to treat rats more according to what biology and ethology tell us about their needs, rather than to see them as homun- culi and dress them up as 'Santa Claus' or 'Tina Ballerina'. Owner's manuals repeatedly talk about what is 'natural' for the rats, for example condemning keeping rats as soli- tary animals (Mays 1997, Langos 1997, Bulla 1998). (This could be seen as a 'normalizing trend', since the reference to biology professes to accept the animal on its own prem- ises, while the homuncular view uses anthropomorphiza- tion as means of acceptance, but space does not allow me to expand on that subject here. I shall content myself with the conclusion that the fancy rat world, too, displays an 'ecological' trend, although there are also other trends which may or may not conflict with this one.) The third field to face the democratization trend is the scientific world, where rats are used as laboratory animals. Being considered vermin, rats are rarely seen by the gen- eral public as innocent victims. The fact that rats and mice make up the absolute majority of all lab animals and that their numbers grow, while the use of 'higher' animals in labs decreases,12 could be taken as an effect of the view of rats and mice as relatively worthless. Following the tradi- tion of the rat pits, they are seen to be expendable animals. Nevertheless, rats benefit from the laws and regulations that try to limit cruel experiments on animals,'3 and med- ical papers often use euphemisms such as 'put down', 'put to sleep' or 'sacrifice' in order to avoid the starker 'kill'. The democratization trend concerning laboratory rats does not, however, end with the inclusion of rats in cam- paigns for animal rights or using apologetic expressions for killing them; there is a whole new view of what exper- iments with rats entail. From the beginning of using rats in laboratory experiments it became clear that the rats had to be treated with great care. In the preface to Breeding and care of the albino rat for research purposes (1923), Greenman and Duhring state that 'It became more and more evident that clean, healthy, albino rats were essential for accurate research and that their production was a serious, difficult, and worthwhile task' (quoted in Lindsey 1979). It was also evident that there were 'inestimable advantages of direct and frequent handling of his stock on the part of the investigator' instead of using 'tongs or other rough devices' (Long and Evans, quoted in Lindsey 1979). Despite these early observations concerning the biolog- ical and social needs of the rats, we still find that the rodents were seen more as biological containers of genes than animals with complex social needs. In a paper signif- icantly titled 'Housing to control research variables', the view of the rat as a genetic container is marvellously cap- Fig. 13. Left: Rats - angels or devils?

The only social factor mentioned is 'population per cage', which is to be found in the outer ring of 'environmental factors', between the headings 'microbial' and 'physical' (Baker et al. 1979). Today an entirely different understanding of the rat is making its way into the scientific world. Rats are no longer seen simply as uniform and interchangeable units of labo- ratory equipment. There is a marked shift towards recog- nizing the social character of the rat, and the appreciation that experiments with individual rats are qualitatively dif- ferent from experiments with groups of rats, as well as an understanding that the behaviour of captive rats might not be identical to that of wild groups." As individual varia- tions, as well as complex social behaviour, are recognized in rats they have come to be seen as more 'human', even in the laboratory. This must not be interpreted as a trend towards an uninhibited anthropomorphism, but rather as an unofficial recognition of the quite interesting and cred- ible idea, put forward by D.R. Crocker, that all under- standing of animal behaviour presupposes some degree of 'humanizing' (Crocker 1984).'5 One might argue that such 'humanizing' is only an attempt at finding and acknowl- edging the common denominators in all animal behaviour - human as well as non-human. Conclusion The ratty world is a manifold one and the identity of a rat will vary greatly, depending on whether it is born into a good rattery, a laboratory or a sewer - or in a rat farm sup- plying snake food to pet shops. There is a possibility that rats in all these different contemporary worlds have common ancestry, since their roots intertwine in the sewers of early 19th-century London. The pet rats and lab- oratory rats of today may in fact be descendants of pecu- liarly coloured rats that the Victorian rat-breeders Jack Black and Jimmy Shaw cherished, saving them from being poisoned or torn to bits in the rat-pits. The Victorian divide between high and low, clean and polluted, accepted and rejected was simultaneously a hier- archy of disgust, which organized classes, bodily parts, city topography, manners and tastes. During this time the rat, as annoying vermin and inhabitant of the contami- nating underworld, was transformed into an abhorred anthropophagous monster, a demon of the dark, which, like all evils and sins, constantly lurked in the gloom, waiting to attack the pure and the innocent. However, even the low and rejected find their protectors and, by a logic of inversion, single, beautifully coloured rats were adopted into the parlour as curiosities and pets, all the while as their plain mates were killed by the thou- sands in the name of cleanliness, amusement or as expend- able objects of scientific experiments. It would be wrong to take the disparate identitites of the rat as evidence that arbitrariness pointed its finger at this particular rodent, constructing it to fit all these diverse fields. The morphophysiology of the rat, especially con- cerning reproduction, but also its habits and habitats, were concrete factors that made it easily adaptable to these diverse roles. Now that the former pattern of class domination has changed, the question is whether the identity of the rat is changing, too. All animals are now increasingly allowed their 'rightful' place in nature. While the image of the rat as a representative of the dark seems to have taken on a life of its own and will probably provide horrifying entertainment on the silver screen for some time to come, the identities of the rat are, slowly but steadily, changing in all other fields. Vermin exterminators talk of ecological balance and apolo- gize before they kill, laboratory staff see the rat as a human likeness in more than genetic terms and pet rat owners con- sider their rats to be animals with animal needs and not merely home decorations, toys or image enhancers. But the standard-bearers for the lowly rodent are the owners of pet rats, who do not stop at likeness or ecological legitimization. They have already opened the cage door and let the rats loose in the parlour, announcing: 'Rats are people, too!"'  IJL SL t* -R i Fig. 16.
