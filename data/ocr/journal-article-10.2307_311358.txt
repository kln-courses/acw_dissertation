<plain_text><page sequence="1">POETIC IMMORTALITY AND THE FEAR OF DEATH: THE SECOND PROEM OF THE DE RERUM NATURA CHARLES SEGAL In Memoriam J. P. Elder THE PROBLEM T HE celebrated Second Proem of the De Rerum Natura (1.922-930), continues to be one of the most fascinating and most discussed passages in the work. Here are the lines with which I am pri- marily concerned (1.922-930): sed acri percussit thyrso laudis spes magna meum cor et simul incussit suavem mi in pectus amorem musarum, quo nunc instinctus mente vigenti avia Pieridum peragro loca nullius ante trita solo. iuvat integros accedere fontis atque haurire, iuvatque novos decerpere flores insignemque meo capiti petere inde coronam unde prius nulli velarint tempora musae. The abrupt shifts in style, tone, and subject matter from the surrounding context have long made these lines a locus conclamatus among com- mentators.1 Some of the difficulty is probably attributable to Lucretius' mixture of poetry and philosophy or even to unresolved elements in his personality or poetic persona, the passionate "anti-Lucretius" chafing against the philosopher of disengaged ataraxia. A more concrete 1For 1.921-950 in the context of Lucretius' argument in the book see Lydia Lenaghan, "Lucretius 1.921-50," TAPA 98 (1967) 221-251. The text cited is Cyril Bai- ley, T. Lucreti Cari De Rerum Natura Libri Sex (Oxford 1947).</page><page sequence="2">194 Charles Segal source of the problem is what E. J. Kenney has called the "inescapable implications" of literary history.2 Lucretius is writing as the first Roman ever to tread the "pathless places" of his subject; yet he is also self-consciously walking along the well beaten track of the highly literary genos of didactic epic. Indeed this very celebration of a fresh start for Roman letters and Roman life carefully echoes famous pro- grammatic statements about poetry in Callimachus and, indirectly, refers also to Hesiod at the very beginnings of didactic poetry in the Graeco-Roman world.3 A related problem arises from the intensity with which Lucretius is drawn to another traditional poetic theme, namely the emotional violence of the "sharp thyrsus" that smites his heart and drives "sweet love of the Muses into (his) breast" (1.922-925). The Dionysiac word thyrsus alludes to the violence of poetic madness and inspiration familiar from Democritus and Plato.4 Yet less than ten lines later Lucretius reiterates what he considers his main virtue and the principal reason why the Muses will wreathe his head with the crown of victory. He wins his prize, as he sees the situation, not because of mysterious, irrational bursts of quasi-divine energy, but because of his clarity of exposition.5 He is thus capable of undoing the tight knots of mystification in which religio entangles us (1.931-934): primum quod magnis doceo de rebus et artis religionum animum nodis exsolvere pergo, deinde quod obscura de re tam lucida pango carmina, musaeo contingens cuncta lepore. This passage, in fact, frames the Second Proem proper, answering the 2 E. J. Kenney, "Doctus Lucretius," Mnemosyne, Series 4, vol. 23 (1970) 369. 3 See Callimachus, Aitia 1, frag. 1.25-28 Pfeiffer; also Hymns 2.110-112; Epigrams 7 and 28; Hesiod, Theog. 1-8.

There is still another problem posed by the Second Proem, and one that has received less attention in recent scholarship, namely the topos of literary immortality. When he mentions the coronal here in 1.929, Lucretius flirts with the traditional motif of the eternity of poetry, the poet's power both to confer and to receive immortal glory, the Homeric icXo;g &amp;pOvrov. As an Epicurean, however, Lucretius knows that noth- ing is immortal except atom and void - and death, the mors immortalis or mors aeterna of Book 3 (3.869, 1091). How seriously are we to take the discrepancy between the Second Proem's intense longing for poetic immortality and Lucretius' philosophical commitment to accepting death as an inevitable, impersonal process, the dissolution of all com- pounds, living beings included, into their constitutent atoms? Lucretius' sudden and passionate appeal to the traditional idea of the poet's immortality, I shall argue, is not merely a nod to literary conven- tion. It marks a stage in a dramatic progression within the poem toward a philosophical acceptance of death. This progression becomes clear, as we shall see, if we compare the Second Proem with the description of Epicurus' death at the end of Book 3 and also if we give due weight to the massive power of death in the concluding section of the poem. It would be a mistake, of course, to over-rationalize the mind of Lucretius and to smooth out all the tensions between the poet and the philosopher. But a closer study of the motif of poetic immor- tality will enable us to see Lucretius confronting these tensions and thereby making them both poetically and philosophically manageable. When he mentions the crown of honor that the Muses bestow on the poet, Lucretius is recalling his own earlier praise of Ennius' "eternal verses" (1.117-119): Ennius ut noster cecinit qui primus amoeno detulit ex Helicone perennifronde coronam, per gentis Italas hominum quae clara clueret. Ennius' "eternal verses," however, also contain dangerous fictions about "eternal punishments" (1.111). However much Lucretius</page><page sequence="4">196 Charles Segal admired Ennius as a poet of "eternal verses," he was not blind to his ignorance of the truth about the afterlife.6 Thus his praise of Ennius is imbedded in a passage warning us that just this ignorance makes man- kind a prey to superstitious dread (107-111): nam si certam finem esse viderent aerumnarum homines, aliqua ratione valerent religionibus atque minis obsistere vatum. nunc ratio nulla est restandi, nulla facultas, aeternas quoniam poenas in morte timendumst. Lucretius can hardly be innocent of irony, then, when within ten lines he applies the word "eternal" both to the mistakenly dreaded punish- ments of the mythical Hades and to the verses of the great poet who has so beautifully promulgated such false and noxious doctrine (1.120 f.): etsi praeterea tamen esse Acherusia templa Ennius aeternis exponit versibus edens.... Ennius' poetic immortality would confer an equal longevity on the "superstitions and threats of seers" (1.110), particularly the "eternal punishments" in the afterlife. The "threats of seers," minae vatum, however, are also the "threats of poets" like Ennius - threats of post mortem punishments fabricated by poets.7 The poets here join forces with the purveyors of fear and darkness. Elsewhere in the poem Lucre- tius vehemently attacks the poets for just such fictions (2.600 and 645-660, 3.628-633, 4.590-594, 5.405 f.). Should one, then, invoke the ghost of the old "anti-Lucretius" whose violent emotions break through the sober restraint of the philosopher, shaking him with the Dionysiac "sharp thyrsus" and the thump on the chest?8 Recent interpreters have pointed out tensions in the poem 6 See Gordon Williams, "Roman Poets as Literary Historians: Some Aspects of Imita- tio," ICS 8 (1983) 224-228, who explores this balance between Lucretius' admiration for Ennius as a model of style and his recognition of his limitations as a thinker. He suggests (228) that Lucretius feels a need to assert his originality in the Roman tradition, whereas he can accept his dependence on his Greek master (3.3-6). Williams does not, however, deal with the issue of poetic immortality. 7 On Ennius' use of vates as a term for poet, and particularly for his own predecessors, see Annales 214 V = 207 S; see the discussion by Kenney (above, n. 2) 377 f. 8 See Lenaghan (above, n. 1) 223-225, who acknowledges the anti-Epicurean element</page><page sequence="5">Poetic Immortality and the Fear of Death 197 between Lucretius qua poet and some of Epicurus' teachings, particu- larly those openly hostile to poetry.9 Boyanc6 and Schrijvers have suggested ways in which poetic immortality and Epicurean philosophy might coexist, but neither scholar takes sufficient account of the emo- tional force with which Lucretius asserts the universal power of death. 10 As he moves from Book 1 to Book 3, Lucretius reinterprets the topos of poetic immortality philosophically. He corrects the traditional view by suggesting that "true" immortality is to be sought not in the survival of the individual personality but in understanding the eternal processes of creation and destruction in the universe." Hence the immortality of Ennius' verses requires a qualification (note the etsi in 1.120), while the immortality of Epicurus' doctrines is more secure. To clarify this point, we shall have to look beyond the Second Proem to other parts of the work. First of all, it is important to observe the exact terms in which Lucretius assimilates the literary tradition of poetic immortality. Although he adopts familiar classical and Hellenistic images of and suggests an underlying "idea of ritual initiation and mystery" (224). This interpreta- tion, however, only displaces the problem from the area of emotion to that of religion. Marc Rozelaar, Lucrez. Versuch einer Deutung (Amsterdam 1943) 84 reminds us that beside the violence of the "sharp thyrsus" stands the "sweet love of the Muses" (1.924), with the gentler associations of suavis (e.g., 1.140 f.). On the "anti-Lucretius" generally see Diskin Clay, Lucretius and Epicurus (Ithaca, N.Y. 1983) 234 ff. 9 See Pierre Boyanc6, "Lucrece et la po6sie," REA 49 (1947) 88-102, especially 89-94, citing Epicurus fr. 229 Usener on "abominating all poetry as a destructive entice- ment of myths." See also Rozelaar (above, n. 8) 151 ff.; A. S. Cox, "Lucretius and his Message," G&amp;R 18 (1971) 1-16; J. J. Lienhard, "The Prooemia of De Rerum Natura," CJ 64 (1968-1969) 346-351, especially 346-349; Wolfgang Fauth, "Divus Epicurus: Zur Problemgeschichte philosophischer Religiositit bei Lukrez," ANRW 1.4 (Berlin 1973) 205 f.; Tatum (above, n. 4) 188 f. (the last two items contain extensive bibliography). 10 Boyanc6 (preceding note) 95 f. and 101 f. proposes a biographical solution: Lucre- tius was a poet before his conversion to Epicureanism and never outgrew the influence of the poetic tradition that he had assimilated earlier. For Schrijvers see n. 17 below. The most common position is that Lucretius resolves the conflict between his poetry and his philosophy by keeping in the foreground the purpose of the former as a means to spread the truth of the latter. So, with variations, Cox (above, n. 9) 10; Rozelaar (above, n. 8) 151 ff.; Otto Regenbogen, "Lucrez: Seine Gestalt in seinem Gedicht" (1932), in Kleine Schriften, ed. Franz Dirlmeier (Munich 1961) 371-375. 1 As both Rozelaar (above, n. 8) 75 and Fauth (above, n. 9) 225 point out, Lucretius does not regard the promise of immortality as sufficient to soothe the anxieties about death.</page><page sequence="6">198 Charles Segal flowers, springs, and untrodden paths,12 his concern throughout the work is less with the individual poet than with the creative energy in the universe that poetry both embodies and attempts to represent. When in the first proem Lucretius requests aeternum leporem for his dicta, he stresses the good that this "charm" will do Memmius and the Roman people rather than the reward of his own immortality (1.28). This lepos, furthermore, belongs not so much to the poem, as a sign of its eternal life, as to the goddess who brings to his work the life force that pervades all of nature, so that all living creatures, caught in a kind of Yeatsian sensual music of Venus' "charm" (capta lepore), partici- pate in her vital, procreative movements (1.14 ff.).13 This "eternal charm," then, is an aspect, in the realm of art, of the ultimately impersonal force of creation that is in continual counterpoise with dissolution and destruction. In asking for the goddess's "eternal charm" Lucretius is also momentarily arresting the destructive forces in the world and allying himself with the energies of creation. Venus can make him sexually, poetically, and intellectually generative all at once. To be captus lepore is also to participate in the suspension of Mars' chaotic power when the war-god is "conquered with the eternal wound of love" (aeterno devictus vulnere amoris 1.34). In requesting "eternal charm" for his verses, Lucretius is also drawing upon the pervasive feeling in classical Antiquity that deep wisdom or supreme poetic skill has a life that extends beyond that of its individual human creator. Such wisdom partakes of a supra-personal truth, whether that be defined as divine power, gift of the Muse, mystic vision, or sacred inspiration. Although Lucretius assimilates the literary tradition of poetic immortality, he holds back from laying claim to its ultimate gift. Even in 1.922-925 he asserts the hope rather than the possession of immor- tality (spes). Epicurus himself died (3.1042-1044), and it is precisely in the deep knowledge of universal death that Lucretius (thanks to Epi- curus) surpasses both Ennius and Homer. As 3.1042-1044 imply, Epi- curus' superiority to the poets rests precisely on this knowledge. As an Epicurean, Lucretius does not claim more than his master. 12 See note 3 above. 13 For lepos in the poem see Boyanc6 (above, n. 9) 99 f.; J. P. Elder, "Lucretius 1.1-49," TAPA 85 (1954) 106 ff.; Clay (above, n. 8) 93 ff.</page><page sequence="7">Poetic Immortality and the Fear of Death 199 Where Lucretius does juxtapose monuments of fame and the truths of Epicurus, he is ironical about the former. If our world has always existed, he asks in 5.324-329, why have the poets sung of nothing before Troy and Thebes? The "great deeds of men," preserved on "eternal monuments of fame" (facta virum ... aeternis monumentis famae insita 5.328 f.), are meaningless in the perspective of the inces- sant atomic cycles of agglomeration and dissolution. Even the sculp- tural and architectural memorials of great men disintegrate and perish (5.311): denique non monumenta virum dilapsa videmus? These monumenta virum, he observes in Book 6, are also vulnerable to destruction by lightning (6.239-242). Monumenta occur only in these three passages of the poem, and each time they are imperiled. Lucre- tius knows too that the "flowering" of honor for a new discovery is fleeting and precarious, for now one thing, now another passes from glory to disdain (5.177-180; cf. 5.1412-1424). Epicurus himself was famous for preferring a life of obscurity.14 Like Epicurus, Lucretius regards "praise" or "glory" (laus, honos) as an unstable, empty, and hence insalubrious goal (cf. 3.46 f., 5.1279 f.). Desire for fame, in fact, comes from just that area of human folly that Lucretius most vehe- mently combats, namely the fear of death and the ignorance that causes this fear (cf. 3.1076 ff.; also 1.107 ff., cited above). Lucretius never calls Epicurus himself "immortal." In fact he never uses aeternus or perpetuus of personal subjects; and of living beings only the gods are ever called immortales, and that only twice (5.53 and 165). How careful Lucretius is in bestowing these epithets appears clearly from his description of Empedocles in 1.729-733.15 Empedo- cles is the most "glorious" and "sacred" being that Sicily has brought forth, of "divine breast," and "scarcely seeming created of human 14 So Epicurus' celebrated maxim X&amp;O6E iPtdx'o, fr. 551 Usener. See also Kyriai Doxai 7 and 14 and fr. 548-560 Usener. 15 On this passage see Tatum (above, n. 4) 185 f., with the bibliography there cited; also Williams (above, n. 6) 227. It is interesting in this connection that, apart from Ennius' "eternal verses" of 1.121, Lucretius uses metaphorical equivalents for the poetic immortality of Ennius and Homer, the floral imagery of "ever-living foliage," perenni fronde coronam (1.118), of Ennius' crown and the "appearance" (species) of "always flowering Homer" (semper florentis Homeri) in Ennius' dream (1.124 f.). The latter phrase reminds us, subtly, that such notions of personal survival after death belong to unreality. When Lucretius describes his own corona, both here in 1.929 and in 6.95, he omits Ennius' attribute of permanence, dropping perennifronde.</page><page sequence="8">200 Charles Segal race"; yet he is not called "immortal" or "eternal." Lucretius believes in the immortality of Epicurus' thought, but he never attributes to the sage any desire for immortal fame such as that which he indulges for himself at 1.922 ff. If Epicurus is a god (5.8 and 51), it is because of his teachings, aurea dicta, / aurea, perpetua semper dignissima vita (3.12 f.; cf. 5.50-55). The proem of Book 6 doubly marks Epicurus as mortal: by his birth and by his death (genuere virum 6.4; extinctus 6.7). Yet his "divine discoveries" keep his fame alive, "soaring to the heavens," to the present day (6.7-8): cuius et extincti propter divina reperta divulgata vetus iam ad caelum gloria fertur. As in 3.1042-1044, Lucretius transfers to Epicurus the immortality of the great heroes of the epic tradition. Ad caelum gloria fertur in 6.8 literally translates the Homeric icXog; ou5pavbv i'cet. But just as the philosopher-hero in the proem of Book 5 surpasses the hero of physical strength, so here the divina reperta of intellectual discovery win the lasting glory that traditionally attends martial deeds. When we lesser mortals, like bees in a flowery meadow, feed on these pages with their honeyed gold, by implication "we" belong to the changing vegetal realm of poetic inspiration rather than to the per- manence of philosophic gold: tuisque ex, inclute, chartis, / floriferis ut apes in saltibus omnia libant, / omnia nos itidem depascimur aurea dicta ... (3.10-12). The poets too, like all the mortal beneficiaries of Epicurus' doctrines, move in the more fragile, cyclical, vitalistic realm of "leafage" and "flowers," however fresh and renewable this plant life may be (cf. perenni fronde coronam 1.118, and novos decerpere flores 3.928). Mutatis mutandis, we ordinary men are rather like Horace's low-flying Apulian bee beside the Pindaric eagle (Odes 4.2). In Book 1, however, Lucretius is not content with the mere meadows of Epi- curus' followers. His avia loca indicate a broader, more boldly essayed landscape than the bees' meadow. Immediately after the Second Proem, Lucretius compares his verses to the Muses' honey (musaeo contingens cuncta lepore 1.934; musaeo dulci contingere melle 1.947 = 4.22; also 1.938 = 4.13; cf. suavem amorem 1.924). The association of philosophic wisdom with honey in the proem of Book 3 invites us to compare the gifts of philosophy and the gifts of poetry. Lucretius means us to connect the two. But,</page><page sequence="9">Poetic Immortality and the Fear of Death 201 however sweet the charm of the Muses, only the philosophic vision and ratio transport us to the infinite reaches of the universe and to the "tran- quil abodes" of the gods in their "cloudless aether" (3.14-24; cf. 1.72-77). Epicurus thus becomes a paradigm among men of the wis- dom whose happiness resembles the serene beatitude enjoyed by the gods.16 CONTRADICTION OR INTENTIONAL CONTRAST? Hoping to pluck "new flowers" for a triumphal garland of his own (1.928 f.), Lucretius would be assuming the crown of the Muses that he attributes to Ennius early in the poem (1.118). Perhaps he would even contend with the "ever-flowering Homer" (semper florens Homerus 1.124). He thus claims a personal place for himself beside the great poets. However erroneous their beliefs, the verses of these poets remain "eternal" (1.120 ff.). When the poet asks Venus to bestow "eternal charm" on his dicta (1.28), he is only seeking what every poet hopes for, namely that his verses will continue to be read and even, like Ennius', will be "eternal" (1.121). Later, however, Lucretius will put forth a better model for survival, the aurea dicta of Epicurus (3.12 f.). But when, at the end of Book 1, he stresses the violence with which that "great hope of praise" strikes his heart (1.923 f.), he may be impli- citly acknowledging something disturbing about poetry from which he cannot entirely break free. The immortalizing expectations of the literary tradition remain strong. Is there, then, a hopeless contradiction between Lucretius' Epi- curean doctrine and his claims to poetic immortality? Schrijvers has suggested that the two sides of the opposition--Epicurus' insistence on tranquil obscurity and the poet's desire for immortal glory -can be reconciled if we accept a division between "objective" and "subjective" views of death and survival. Great poetry and philosophy possess a "subjective" capacity for continued existence, even after the "objec- tive" end of the individual creator, after his atoms have dispersed to form new compounds elsewhere in the universe.17 This approach, 16 For Epicurus' wisdom as a paradigm for godlike happiness see Francis Wolf, Logique de 1'"llment (Paris 1981) 71. 17 P. H. Schrijvers, Horror ac divina Voluptas. Etudes sur la podtique et la podsie de Lucrece (Amsterdam 1970) 79 f.</page><page sequence="10">202 Charles Segal however, does not fully resolve the contradiction, especially as Epi- curus himself is unlikely to have considered poetry per se worthy of immortality.'8 Although Epicurus perhaps made a grudging concession to fame as the source of "some pleasures" (fr. 549 Usener), nothing in his extant remains sanctions the vehemence with which Lucretius desires it in 1.922-925.19 Perhaps, then, to be a great poet means, ultimately, to be less of an Epicurean. Perhaps for all his philosophical acceptance of the power of death, something in Lucretius the poet has not given up "hoping" for what every poet since Homer had seen as his goal and his right. And that, perhaps, is the point: as Lucretius proudly recognizes (1.926-930), to have placed Epicurean philosophy in the poetic tradi- tion extending from Homer to Ennius was a tour de force. Epicurus could hardly have envisioned his doctrine cast in the form of an ornate hexameter poem.20 By associating the traditional desire for poetic immortality with the equally traditional connection of poetry with Dionysiac madness (1.922-925),21 Lucretius also shows his awareness that he is indulging momentarily and perhaps dangerously in the temp- tations of irrationality and falsehood that poetry holds out. Ennius had already succumbed to this danger of error (1.116-135). Lucretius knows that when he permits "great hope for praise" to smite his heart in so Dionysiac a fashion, he is momentarily joining the Heliconiadum comites (as Lucretius rather ironically calls the poets in Book 3) and indulging in the mythical fantasies of the Greeks. "Hope" is in fact rare in Lucretius. The noun spes, outside the Second Proem, occurs only three times, the verb sperare twice. In these three occurrences the noun denotes the false hope of the lover (4.1086 and 1096) or of the warrior (5.1347). The verb, in 4.805, describes the mind's perception of empty images in dreams and imagi- nation. Hope thus belongs among the irrational elements in human life, which Lucretius is trying to eliminate or reduce. Is he then simply 18 See note 9 above. 19 Indeed, Epicurus' dismissal of glory as a noble goal of life was singled out for polemic by his opponents: see fr. 550 Usener (= Cic. T.D. 2.12.28); Plut. Non posse suav. vivi sec. Epicurum 18-19 (1099F-1100I IOOD) and Latenter esse vivendum 1128A-1130E. It is interesting that Plutarch, in the former of the two passages cited above, scornfully uses the language of madness for Epicurus' alleged desire for fame (nEptigav~ g 1 100A). 20 See Boyanc6 (above, n. 9) 99 f.; Tatum (above, n. 4) 189. 21 See note 4 above.</page><page sequence="11">Poetic Immortality and the Fear of Death 203 overwhelmed by a poet's permissible irrationality when he so ardently feels the "great hope of praise"? Or is he just allowing himself the license of a venerable poetic tradition? His handling of that tradition, and particularly of its two most illustrious representatives, Homer in Greek and Ennius in Latin, I would suggest, shows that he knows better, and that he knows that he knows better. The two passages dis- cussed above, 1.102-126 and particularly 3.1024-1044, serve as a kind of antidote to the emotional exaltation of 1.922 ff. With the Dionysiac "hope" of 1.923 ff. we should contrast the more tranquil "hope" in the motives for writing given in 1.140-144, the only exception to the uses of the word described above: sed tua me virtus tamen et sperata voluptas suavis amicitiae quemvis efferre laborem suadet et inducit noctes vigilare serenas quaerentem dictis quibus et quo carmine demum clara tuae possim praepandere lumina menti.22 This context would be an excellent place for Lucretius to have expressed a "hope" for poetic immortality as a reward for his strenuous task of converting the "Greeks' dark discoveries" into luminous Latin verses (1.136 f.). Instead, he mentions only the intellectual reward of dispelling the mind's darkness (1.143-145). Where he speaks else- where of following in the footsteps of Epicurus and translating his difficult Greek into the sweetness of Latin verse, his concern is the healing and illuminating result of the message, and he says nothing about the fame that the poet himself might thereby acquire (cf. 4.18-25 = 1.943-950, 5.49-56, 5.335-337).23 We should contrast too the "sharp thyrsus" of Lucretius' deeply emotional longing for personal glory in the Second Proem with the "sharp virtue" that is stirred in Epicurus by the longing for the broad intellectual vision beyond the flaming walls of the world (1.69-71): 22 With this passage compare also 3.419 f. conquisita diu dulcique reperta labore. 23 Note the change to stress "usefulness" that the reader will derive from his doctrine when Lucretius takes over the Second Proem of Book I as the proem of Book 4. He alters the second half of 1.950 from qua constet compta figura to ac persentis utilitatem (4.25). On the question of the priority of 1.950 see Karl Biichner, "Die Proimien des Lukrez," C&amp;M 13 (1952) 189 f., but his arguments in favor of the priority of 4.25 rest on subjective judgments about style that do not seem to me convincing.</page><page sequence="12">204 Charles Segal sed eo magis acrem irritat animi virtutem, effringere ut arta naturae primus portarum claustra cupiret. sed acri percussit thyrso laudis spes magna meum cor... (1.922 f.) For the poet the intensity denoted by acer belongs to desire for fame; for the philosopher, to virtus. Epicurus' victorious mental journey across the newly penetrated infinity of the universe is the model for Lucretius' traversing of the "Muses' pathless places" (1.926). Only in these two passages (1.74 and 926) does Lucretius use the verb peragro in a finite form and with a distinct, named human subject (he uses the participle peragrans in 2.355, of the cow seeking her lost calf, and in 2.677 of the generalized reader, addressed as "you"). Both the poet and the philosopher exert extraordinary mental energy (cf. vivida vis animi, of Epicurus in 1.72 and mente vigenti, of the poet, in 1.925). But the philosopher's intel- lectual force wins its way through struggle (pervicit) to the world's lim- its (atque omne immensum peragravit mente animoque 1.74). The best that the poet can do is to reach "the pathless places of the Pierian Muses." The poet seeks the traditional Greek crown of honor for his own head (meo capiti 1.929). The philosopher brings back a less tangi- ble but ultimately more momentous gift, the intellectual grasp of the processes of creation and destruction in the universe. This is not just a personal prize but a boon for "us," for all mankind: unde refert nobis victor quid possit oriri, / quid nequeat (1.75 f.). The poet wins for him- self an unparalleled poetic contest, of which the crown is the trophy (1.928 f.). Epicurus goes where no mortal has ever ventured before; but his victory extends beyond himself to all of "us": nos exaequat vic- toria caelo (1.79). We may contrast 1.929 f., where the poet speaks of his own head and temples in the first person singular: meo capiti petere inde coronam / unde prius nulli velarint tempora musae. Viewed in this perspective, the poet's journey seems an ultimately more limited, more self-centered, and more narrowly emotional achievement.</page><page sequence="13">Poetic Immortality and the Fear of Death 205 THE PROEM OF BOOK 6: THE POET'S PROGRESS Let us, at this point, stand back from the individual texts and for a moment join Diskin Clay in his suggestive reading of the poem as con- taining an implicit growth or progress toward truth in the relation between poet and reader, and (I would add) a progress also within the poetic persona who addresses the reader.24 Such a reading, I believe, is illuminating for Lucretius' treatment of poetic immortality. By the end of Book 3 both poet and reader have confronted death and the poetic traditions about death (the false myths about the afterlife exposed in the last section of Book 3). When Lucretius now considers the motif of the poet's glory, he is beyond the violent emotionality of 1.922-925. Or, more precisely, his text can now represent a poetic per- sona that is beyond such violent desires. By substituting Epicurus for Homer in the immortalizing epigram of Leonidas (A.P. 9.24) in 3.1041-1044, Lucretius shows that true immortality belongs to the philosopher, not to the poet. And this is an immortality of ideas and aurea dicta, not of the individual personality. In like manner he recasts the Homeric Olympus as the philosophical serenity of Epicurean con- templation, perceiving the true nature of the world (3.17-30). When he comes to reuse the Second Proem of the work as the proem to Book 4 (4.1-25 = 1.926-950), he begins with 1.926, avia Pieridum peragro loca nullius ante / trita solo, and thereby avoids repeating the Dionysiac intensity of longing for poetic glory in the verses immedi- ately preceding (1.922-926).25 In his final proem Lucretius raises the subject of poetic praise for the last time. Now he underlines the finality of his treatment by the phrase supremae calcis and by the prayer for "rest" (requies, 6.92-94). He 24 See Clay (above, n. 8) 212-215, 231, 266. 25 It has often been argued that the repetition of the Second Proem as the proem to Book 4 is the work of a later editor, not Lucretius himself: see, e.g., J. Mewaldt, "Eine Dublette in Buch IV des Lucrez," Hermes 43 (1908) 286-295, especially 291 ff., and Wolfgang Schmid, "Altes und Neues zu einer Lukrezfrage," Philologus 93 (1938) 338-351, especially 347 ff. But there are good reasons for believing that Lucretius com- posed the Second Proem of Book 1 first, transferred it, with the modifications noted, to the proem of Book 4, and meant the lines to stand in both places: see Bailey's Prolegomena (above, n. 1: 1.36 and 163 f.) and his commentary ad 1.921-950 (2.757 f.); also Regenbogen (above, n. 10) 321 ff., 328; Hans Diller, "Die Prooemien des Lucrez und die Entstehung des lucrezischen Gedicht," SIFC 25 (1951) 5-30, especially 23. See con- tra Btichner (above, n. 23) 159-235, especially 187 ff.</page><page sequence="14">206 Charles Segal looks all the way back to the fame won by Ennius and to the poetic landscape of the Greek literary tradition in the opening of the work: Ennius ut noster cecinit qui primus amoeno detulit ex Helicone perenni fronde coronam. (1.117 f.) tu mihi supremae praescripta ad candida calcis currenti spatium praemonstra, callida musa Calliope, requies hominum divumque voluptas, te duce ut insigni capiam cum laude coronam. (6.92-95) Although Lucretius still desires "praise," he no longer feels the Dionysiac thrill of passion that he allowed himself in 1.922-925. Although he is still requesting instruction, he is far more confident of actually having this "praise" within his grasp: instead of petere coronam (1.925), he writes capiam coronam (6.95). Now the "praise" itself, not the "crown," is "glorious" (compare insigni ... cum laude coronam here with insignem ... coronam in 1.929). By thus denuding of its honorific epithet this traditional metaphor for poetic immortality, Lucretius shows himself somewhat less concerned with the external trappings of the literary tradition as they appeared in the first book (1.118 and 929). Here too the wish for praise is not just an isolated personal desire, as it was in 1.922-925 with its strong first-person emphasis (me ... fallit, meum cor, mi in pectus). Now this wish is guided by the Muse, in second-person address, as "leader" (te duce). The crown of praise in this last proem no longer belongs to the poeticized mountain and to the Muses of Hesiodic myth who meet the poet in human guise (cf. Heliconiadum comites 3.1037; also ex Hel- icone ... coronam, of Ennius, in 1.118), but rather to a Muse of philo- sophy (Lucretius is echoing Empedocles)26 who is herself another manifestation of the universal life-force. Through the verbal play on call-ida and Call-iope, this Muse is associated with intellectual creativity.27 Like Venus in the first line of the poem, she is also 26 Empedocles 31 B 131 Diels-Kranz, on which see most recently Clay (above, n. 8) 252, 255. 27 For the pun and its significance see Paul Friedlander, "The Pattern of Sound and Atomistic Theory in Lucretius," AJP 62 (1941) 20; Jane M. Snyder, Puns and Poetry in Lucretius' De Rerum Natura (Amsterdam 1980) 107; also Clay (above, n. 8) 255, with 242 n. 10.</page><page sequence="15">Poetic Immortality and the Fear of Death 207 associated with the "pleasure" (voluptas) that in its serene, "catastematic" form (cf. requies) is the ultimate goal of men and the eternal possession of the gods. Significantly, 6.94 is the only place in the poem where Lucretius uses requies in an affirmative sentence. Its four other occurrences in the poem are in negative statements and describe the incessant flow of atoms from which there is "no rest" (1.992 f., 4.227, 6.933, 6.1178). In his final invocation, then, Lucretius reminds his reader of how much both of them have traversed in their companionship across the extent of the poem.28 He also indicates how fully he has transcended the ornamental anthropomorphism surrounding the immortalizing power of the Muse and how completely he has absorbed into his Epi- curean "true doctrine" the literary traditions to which she belongs. At the same time that very struggle with the poetic tradition and with its immortal longings leaves scars which this poetry is too honest to efface. Taken together, these modifications of 1.922-925 in the later books suggest the poet's consciousness of his own gradual victory over the flawed beliefs that compose the poetic traditions of the past. By leav- ing behind a trace of that tradition in the momentary passion for praise in 1.922-925, the poet also marks his own progress in the course of the poem and indicates the victory of the vera ratio in his own realm of verbal art alongside its desirability in private life and in public affairs. DEATH AND THE POET'S GIFT So far, I have dwelt on the negative side of the contrast between poet and philosopher. I would like to suggest another way in which poetry and philosophy relate to the forces of life and death, a way that is complementary rather than contrastive. The outer fringes of the world to which Epicurus journeys in 1.72-79 are also the places through which death enters and eventual dissolution comes (cf. 2.1144 ff.). The philosopher's journey, and the teaching that results from it, bring us the knowledge of our world's destruction. This 28 On the relation between 1.1 and 6.94 see most recently Clay (above, n. 8) 183 and 213. I cannot agree with Bailey (above, n. 1) ad 6.94 that "the difference between the two invocations is seen in that here the expression is purely conventional, there [viz., in 1.1.] it has an esoteric meaning." See also Regenbogen (above, n. 10) 373 with n. 166.</page><page sequence="16">208 Charles Segal knowledge, by putting our individual deaths into perspective, vanqu- ishes the fear of death and thus enables us to attain inner peace or ataraxia. Ennius may have been the first to bring back the crown from "pleasant Helicon" (1.117-119), but Lucretius gives no details of that journey. Instead it is his own poetic journey that traverses "pathless places" and lies among fresh water, new flowers, foliage (integros fontis, novos flores, coronam). From archaic Greek lyric on, these are the holy places of poetic inspiration and, as has often been observed, they belong in a hallowed literary tradition. Yet in Lucretius' poem their features also correspond to the creative energies of renewal in the world. Thus in describing how atoms come together to create life, Lucretius uses the same combination of streams, freshness, and flowers (1.1031-1034): efficit ut largis avidum mare fluminis undis integrent amnes et solis terra vapore fota novet fetus summissaque gens animantum floreat et vivant labentes aetheris ignes. The nutriment that sustains life against the incessant blows of atoms from without works by "making fresh" and "renewing": omnia debet enim cibus integrare novando et fulcire cibus (2.1146 f.) The same imagery recurs just before the Magna Mater passage, where Lucretius explains that the earth contains the atoms of all things (2.589-591): principio tellus habet in se corpora prima unde mare immensum volventes frigorafontes assidue renovent, habet ignes unde oriantur. We may compare iuvat integros accedere fontis /... novos decerpere flores in 1.927 f. When the poet "takes delight in approaching fresh fountains" and in "plucking new flowers" in the Second Proem, he is participating in these creative processes as well as affirming his place in a literary trad- ition. The associations of these images with poetic originality mark</page><page sequence="17">Poetic Immortality and the Fear of Death 209 both the newness of Lucretius' advance beyond the poetic tradition (i.e., Ennius) and the Epicurean basis of that advance. Simultaneously he is pursuing the vera voluptas of Epicurean philosophizing on both the moral and psychological planes. He brings together Epicurus' serene garden of philosophical ataraxia and the traditional poetic landscape of the grove of the Muses. He thereby draws together both the moral and the poetic inspiration that makes his work possible. Probably going against the grain of the Master's own low regard for poetry, he manages to suggest that his own poetic activity, in the ser- vice of Epicureanism, is at least a modest equivalent to the thinker's remote journey (see above). Were modem man to confront this contrast between the fiery landscape of the philosopher's quest and the watery setting of the Muses, he would doubtless privilege the scientific side. Given our modern myths of omnipotent science and technology, we are disposed to view the flower-imagery as light and decorative, traditional and therefore of little value. Lucretius' Dionysiac excitement, however, suggests a different view of the poetic trappings, namely a conviction that the poet has something to tell us that the philosophy as such cannot convey. This is not just the freedom from an oppressive fear, but a freedom to enjoy the world as it is and to identify with its creative power. Nor is this gift of the Epicurean poet merely a corrective to the illusory speculation about shades in the false myths of the afterlife told by Homer and Ennius (1.112 ff.). It is a positive joy in the thrill of creative energy that the poet shares with the life of the universe. This life-affirming Dionysiac spirit is akin to the vital energies of Venus celebrated in the first proem.29 The echoes between the two pas- sages have often been noted (e.g., simul incussit suavem mi in pectus amorem / musarum, 1.924 f., and omnibus incutiens blandum per pec- tora amorem, 1.19). The only other extended Dionysiac imagery in the poem describes another personification of the creative cycle of the atomic processes, namely the Magna Mater (2.618-621): tympana tenta tonant palmis et cymbala circum 29 On Venus and the energies of creation see Regenbogen (above, n. 10) 363-365, 374 f.; Elder (above, n. 13) 101 ff.; Fauth (above, n. 9) 213 with n. 82, for bibliography; Eva M. Thury, "Lucretius' Poem as a Simulacrum of the Rerum Natura," AJP 108 (1987) 288 ff., especially 293.</page><page sequence="18">210 Charles Segal concava, raucisonoque minantur cornua cantu, et Phrygio stimulat numero cava tibia mentis, telaque praeportant violenti signa furoris.... As the springs of the Muses in 1.926 ff. contrast with the fiery limits of the world traversed by Epicurus, so the earth is the repository of atomic abundance and union, in contrast to the sea of atomic dissolution (2.547-564). We may recall here the cool fountains' continual renewal of the "measureless sea" in 2.589-591, cited above. When Lucretius harks back to the Magna Mater passage later in the poem, he repeats both the liquid and the bacchic imagery. The earth is deservedly named "mother," he explains, because "she herself has created the human race and poured forth every animal that goes in bacchic revel here and there on the great mountains" (5.821-824): quare etiam atque etiam maternum nomen adepta terra tenet merito, quoniam genus ipsa creavit humanum atque animal prope certo temporefudit omne quod in magnis bacchatur montibu' passim.... In counterpoint to Epicurus' vision of the ultimate destruction of all worlds, then, there runs another pattern: a line extending from the life- force of Venus in the first proem to Lucretius' joy and bacchic excite- ment in his own poetic creativity in the Second Proem, and then to the Magna Mater as a personification of creative energy in the earth.30 After Book 3, however, the vision of death's "immortal" power gains in strength and forces us to reconsider such outbursts of vitalistic enthusiasm as that of the Second Proem. That perspective modifies even the poet's traditional hope for the lasting fame of his work. The fresh fountains of the Muses in the Second Proem offer a sane alterna- tive to the "fountain of anxieties" about death, whose black liquid pol- lutes all "clear and pure pleasure" in Book 3, or to the treacherous "fountain of delight" in romantic passion with its "impure pleasure" in Book 4 (3.37-40, 4.1075 f. and 1133). But the last of the many foun- tains that we meet in the poem is not the fresh springs of the Muses' 30 See William S. Anderson, "Discontinuity in Lucretian Symbolism," TAPA 91 (1960) 6-11: Terra Mater embodies "that aspect of generation which depends upon the vital pro- perties of the earth" (6).</page><page sequence="19">Poetic Immortality and the Fear of Death 211 mountainside (1.927) but the wells of a sickened, dying city into which the victims of plague hurl themselves with desperate thirst (6.1172-1178). The pastoral and floral freshness of the traditional poetic landscape in the Second Proem and related passages may still remain a powerful symbol of hope;31 but it is a hope that neither the poet nor his audience can espouse in the joyful simplicity and enthusiasm of the first book. Like all else in this world, this locus amoenus coexists with its inevit- able and ceaseless struggle against the forces of death and dissolution. The never-resolved, evenly balanced alternation between life-processes and death-processes in cosmic isonomia extends to the poet's concep- tion of his work. Both poet and reader struggle for life, and both value the movements that make for life and renewal. But these are only half of the total picture. We need the strength, energy, and wisdom of the philosopher and the poet together to understand what our individual lives may, and may not, mean. And here, as the endings of Books 2, 3, and 6 suggest, the certainty of death for us and our world is our most fundamental recognition, and the most difficult. Our ultimate goal, then, would not be just the personal joy (iuvat, 1.927 f.) of going to the "pathless places" where poet meets Muse in a landscape of life-giving springs and flowers, but rather a directed jour- ney toward a remoter, less personal wisdom that includes fiery destruc- tion at the world's boundaries. In such a place the sage has seen the origins of all life and the forces of inevitable death, and that not merely for himself but for everything that exists. Such a setting holds terror as well as joy. When in fact Lucretius comes closer to the philosophic vision, following in the Master's footsteps in the proem of Book 3, he qualifies the simpler pleasure of the Second Proem's iuvat (1.927 f.) by a shudder of something like fear as he looks down at the infinity of emptiness "beneath his feet" (3.25-30): at contra nusquam apparent Acherusia templa nec tellus obstat quin omnia dispiciantur, sub pedibus quaecumque infra per inane geruntur. his ibi me rebus quaedam divina voluptas percipit atque horror, quod sic natura tua vi 31 See D. J. Gillis, "Pastoral Poetry in Lucretius," Latomus 26 (1967) 339-362; also my essay "Delubra Decora: Lucretius II.352-66," Latomus 29 (1970) 106-109.</page><page sequence="20">212 Charles Segal tam manifesta patens ex omni parte retecta est. The "divine pleasure" and tingling thrill of horror remind us that clarity and breadth of vision, however desirable as philosophical goals, are not feelings. As poet, Lucretius feels as well as sees. The earth's creative energy, personified in the Magna Mater, like the creative force of poetic inspiration, stirs strong and troubling Dionysiac emotions. It is the Epicurean poet's task not only to arouse these emotions but also to name and locate them and, ultimately, to enlist them in the service of truth and serenity, in order that the vera ratio and ataraxia of the Master's vision may replace the false images of the poets (1.120ff.).32 PRINCETON UNIVERSITY 32 I delivered a preliminary sketch of this paper at the Annual Meeting of the American Philological Association in December 1986.
