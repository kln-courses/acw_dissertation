<plain_text><page sequence="1">Galbraith symposium Galbraith and the theory of the corporation JAMES K. GALBRAITH On what question has John Kenneth Galbraith most deeply challenged the conventional wisdom? Most readers would point to his grand por- trait of the mixed economy, in American Capitalism, The Affluent Society, and The New Industrial State. Some would cite his attack on consumer sovereignty, or his early attention to the environment, or his advocacy of price control. A few would mention his work on the problem of power: between the sexes, within the household, in the marketplace, in the relationship of citizen to state. From the standpoint of economic theory, Galbraith's most important concept is his corporation. Galbraith's corporation is the centerpiece of his most sweeping analytical book, The New Industrial State. It is the entity with the longest pedigree in economic thought. It strikes more directly than any other at the heart of orthodox analysis. But while most economists who have written on the theory of the firm in Galbraith's time seem to realize that the foundations of their thought have been challenged, the nature of that challenge is not well understood. Whence it came Galbraith's corporation is in the American institutionalist tradition, which took its inspiration not from the Cambridge of Marshall and Keynes or the Lausanne of Walras, but from Germany. More precisely, an American sociology and economics of the corporation grew up in the twentieth century under the influence of German historical-school The author is Deputy Director of the Joint Economic Committee, Congress of the United States.

Galbraith's challenge is directed at the assumption of structural rationality of the firm, the condition which permits theory to treat an organization as if it were a rational individual. An organization may be said to exhibit structural rationality if, like a person, it is capable of purposeful sentiment and of the efficient transla- tion of purpose into action. The assumption that this condition holds is an essential premise of the orthodox theory of the firm. The theory has likened the firm to a "black box,"' which is of interest not for itself, but as a communications link in the interplay of the market: the firm receives signals from the outside world in the form of demand and supply curves and transmits back other signals as quantities and prices. Such a concept presupposes that the (unseen) circuits inside the box are closed, rather than open, and that they are wired so that a given set of signals received will, within reasonable tolerances, always generate a particular, and predictable, set of signals transmitted. The supposition of structural rationality is not much discussed. The literature brims with argument over whether profit-maximization is the right motivating purpose of the firm. But this is a debate over which purpose it is appropriate to assume-a second question whose posing presumes that the first question has been resolved. To participate, all protagonists accept that the concept of purpose may be applied to the behavior of the firm. And that implies taking a position, in an old controversy over the theory of organization, quite different from that which underlies the corporation according to Galbraith. Bureaucracy theory A starting point for discussion of the controversy may be found in Hegel, who applies to the State the same presumption of rationality that orthodox economics applies to the corporation. Hegel's arguments and the reaction to them led to the development of American bureaucracy theory, the insights of which underlie the institutionalist and later specifically Galbraith's concept of the corporation. For Hegel, the obstacle to the rational State lies not in the making of decisions, but in the design of an organization that could efficiently carry them out. The impediment to design is divergence of the personal interests of office-holders from the universal interests of the State. That barrier is overcome by bureaucracy, which divorces the bureaucrat's personal from his official life:</page><page sequence="3">GALBRAITH AND THE CORPORATION 45 What the service of the state really requires is that men shall forego the selfish and capricious satisfaction of their subjective ends; by this very sacrifice, they acquire the right to find their satisfaction in, but only in, the dutiful discharge of their public functions. (Hegel, 1975, p. 191) Weber systematized Hegel's thought and made it comprehensible-no small achievement-to the modern mind. Weber provides the rules of bureaucracy, which make plausible to utilitarians that bureaucrats might forego "the selfish and capricious satisfaction of their subjective ends." From the ten key characteristics of bureaucratic employment, one may derive the superior rationality of the modern state by compari- son with earlier social forms. By rationality Weber meant structural rationality, or efficiency in translating purpose into action. . . .the monocratic variety of bureaucracy, is from the purely technical point of view, capable of obtaining the highest degree of efficiency and is, in this sense, the most rational known means of carrying out imperative control over human beings. (Weber, 1965, p. 337) In principle, Weber's bureaucracy, unlike Hegel's, can be divorced from the State. Weber's ten characteristics of rational bureaucracy have nothing in them which cannot be applied to the modern private corporation. So it is possible to regard much of the subsequent writing on the sociology of the corporation as reaction to the Weberian idea that rational structure breeds efficiency in the translation of purpose into action. 'Weber's ten characteristics of rational bureaucracy were as follows: 1. The bureaucrat is a free man, subject to authority only with respect to his impersonal official obligations. 2. The bureaucrat's office is organized in a clearly defined hierarchical structure. 3. The office has a clearly defined sphere of competence. 4. The office is filled by a free contractual relationship, resulting from free selection. 5. Candidates are appointed, not elected, and on the basis of their technical qualifications. 6. The bureaucrat is paid a fixed salary in money, usually with pension rights, limited vulnerability to discharge, and a free right to resign. 7. The office is the primary occupation of the incumbent. 8. It is his career. 9. He is entirely separate from the ownership of the means of administration.. 10. He is subject to "strict and systematic discipline and control in the conduct of his office."</page><page sequence="4">46 JOURNAL OF POST KEYNESIAN ECONOMICS Critics of this view deny that institutions can by design alone suc- cessfully divorce the personal interests of the bureaucrat from his official duties. Either the state's interest will be overcome by the private purposes of bureaucrats,2 or the bureaucracy will fail to achieve rationality, owing to conflicts within the bureaucracy between public and private interests. Organization theory, leading to Galbraith's cor- poration, follows this second line of argument. The tendency to rigidity in bureaucratic life was one form of irratio- nality which was noticed quickly. To Americans, this seemed an evident flaw of the Prussian state, which had served as a model for Hegel and Weber, and Veblen made the connection explicitly in his essay on "Imperial Germany and the Industrial Revolution."' Veblen argued that the bureaucratic structures of the Prussian State, though suitable to "coercive, centralized and irresponsible control," were in fact "car- ried over from a recent and retarded past" and were "wholly out of consonance" with the long-term requirements of the machine age and industrial progress (Veblen, 1973, p. 559). Veblen also touched on the problem of cross-cultural comprehension, whose distant descendant is the subject of this essay, namely, the failure of English-speaking cul- tures to understand or incorporate in their social science the model of imperative control which the Prussian state sought and which, if Gal- braith is right, the modern corporation seeks today: Where the popular consensus so comes to coincide with the line of the State's initiative and unfolding power, as in the Prussian case, it will commonly happen that this happy consummation is reached through the community's accepting the State's ends as its own, and also commonly without such knowledge of the State's ends in the case as would enable the community to take stock of them and appreciate what has been accepted or assented to. (Ibid., p. 551) More theoretically, it has been argued that rigidity stems from the presence of operational risk. Bureaucratic rules tend inherently to become excessively detailed, restrictive, and pettifogging, irrationally 2Marx believed this. In his Critique of Hegel, Marx wrote, In bureacracy the identity of the state's interest and particular private purpose is es- tablished in such a way that the state's interest becomes a particular private purpose op- posed to other private purposes. (Marx, 1975, p. 109) For a like-minded modern exposition from an unlikely source, see the essay by James Buchanan, entitled "Why Does Government Grow" (Borcherding, 1977).</page><page sequence="5">GALBRAITH AND THE CORPORATION 47 limiting initiative, so that in the event of failure blame may be allocated to those found in violation of rules-whether they are substantively responsible or not: This emphasis leads to a transference of the [bureaucrat's] sentiments from the aims of the organization onto the particular details of behavior required by the rules. (Merton, 1940, pp. 560-568) These perceptions of corporate failings remain deeply imbedded in the popular mind today, although they have not been taken into account in economic theory. Later, as organization theory assimilated the cultural environment of North America, elements of democratic ideology also crept in. Gouldner (1954) argued that bureaucrats would not necessarily accept an arbitrary definition of their function; their consensus as to organiza- tional goals must be engaged as well as their sense of duty. Blau (1955) pointed out the need for esprit de corps, which is not necessarily compatible with Teutonic discipline and Prussian efficiency in all cul- tures (Blau, 1955). And so there emerged, in the American literature on bureaucracy, a general consensus that rational administration hinges on the coincidence of the private and public interests of bureaucrats, which cannot be merely assumed to exist or to follow from the design of a bureaucratic structure. With this, the way opened for investigation into the conditions under which group behavior might efficiently reflect a given set of purposes. It began to be recognized that small groups of people were easier to organize into efficient organizational prototypes than were large groups and that large organizations are nearly always concatenations of small organizations. Finally, it became clear that the sum of many rational and efficient small groups was not necessarily, or even prob- ably, a rational and efficient large group. For these insights and their application to the modern private business firm, Simon (1947) won a Nobel Prize in Economic Science and godfathered the corporation of The New Industrial State. Managerial firms A stream of literature from renegade economists runs parallel to Simon and the sociology of the bureaucratic corporation. Berle and Means, Penrose, Marris-all dispensing with the orthodox concept of the</page><page sequence="6">48 JOURNAL OF POST KEYNESIAN ECONOMICS unitary, rational, profit-maximizing firm-have had influence on and been influenced by Galbraith. All substituted for it an organization whose internal structure and operations were relevant to its external relationships in the market. Berle and Means (1932, revised edition 1968) first advanced the concept of the management-dominated firm. Their work spawned two strains of subsequent research, one of which ultimately led back to orthodox thinking, while the other leads logically, but in practice only with great intellectual tension, toward the Galbraithian corporation. In the former strain are those who have accepted, for purposes of argument, the transfer of control from owners to managers, but who are interested only in exploring the implications of rationally pursued managerial objective functions for the traditional theory of markets. Baumol (1962), for example, has presented partial equilibrium models of sales and growth maximization, and Williamson (1964) has postulat- ed that managers variously use their discretion in their own interest, maximizing staff, emoluments, and leisure. As will be discussed be- low, these abstractions have not succeeded as a replacement within competitive analysis for the orthodox postulate of profit-maximization, principally because they do not lead to transparently superior implications. The other group of Berle and Means's intellectual followers sees the deeper implication of managerial control: it undermines acceptance of the implicit postulate of structural rationality and requires the theory of organizational behavior to be brought to bear explicitly on the behavior of the firm. The Economic Theory of Managerial Capitalism (Marris, 1964, revised 1967) epitomizes the ambivalence of a card-carrying economist confronted with the modern corporation. Marris begins by establishing the institutional conditions under which firms operate and are evaluat- ed in capital markets. He presents his argument that, given these conditions, the managerial firm will pick a strategy of sustainable- growth maximization instead of static profit-maximization. This appealing hypothesis is neatly differentiated by its implications from the orthodox view. However, a contradiction must be resolved: managerial firms are organizations, and the proposition that organiza- tions can maximize anything is in doubt. Marris sees that he must establish the structural rationality of his sustainable-growth maximiz- ing firm. His argument founders in the attempt to do so. Marris postulates that</page><page sequence="7">GALBRAITH AND THE CORPORATION 49 "norms of professional competence" spring up to guide and spur the individual executive along the path of group rationality. These are bolstered by incentive schemes-stock options, for example. The goals themselves are given from above (by top management?) and passed along without problem to the managerial groups. Peer pressure, social- ization, and other manifestations of social psychology ensure the corre- spondence of management behavior with the economically rational objectives of the firm: "the social law becomes the economic one" (Marris, 1967, p. 97). But these are all the devices devised by genera- tions of sociologists since Hegel to assure that one can collapse an organization into a single rational actor. That is precisely what manage- rial control assures that one cannot do. Behavioral firms A much stronger break toward the organizational firm appeared just in advance of Marris's book, in A Behavioral Theory of the Firm (Cyert and March, 1963). However, even this classic statement of the behaviorist position contains an ambiguity, fostering the illusion that structural rationality could be brought back to the behavioral firm by the back door. For Cyert and March, following Simon, firms are coalitions, co- ordinated groups of entities with divergent objectives. Each entity, itself generally also a grouping, has a certain veto power over the decisions of the group. Such entities can therefore impose constraints on the policy of the organization. Side payments can reduce, but not eliminate, the conflicts arising from incompatible goals and con- straints. There is bargaining. Policy is decided when a mutually com- patible set of constraints on the outcome is agreed to. Work proceeds. If some constraint is not met, then search will be undertaken to improve the efficiency of policy in meeting its goals. Failing this, parties will bargain until a new and feasible set of mutual constraints has been arrived at. Having made their case for diverse, stable, consensual organization- al objectives, Cyert and March are in position to divorce the actions of an organization from purposiveness. But they then assert that, in fact, objectives change as time passes. In particular, the firm seeks to ac- complish increasingly difficult tasks. To cope with this, the authors introduce the concept of an "aspiration level," its interaction with organizational achievements over time, and so go on to generate a</page><page sequence="8">50 JOURNAL OF POST KEYNESIAN ECONOMICS theory of problem-oriented search and innovation. The aspiration level is the source of trouble, for its introduction neglects the question of whose aspirations grow over time. Cyert and March thus leave the impression that there is after all some first- among-equals, a guiding spirit behind the behavioral firm. Anthropo- morphism floods in through the loophole, and arithmomorphism, the reduction of the firm to a mathematical problem solver, is not far behind. (See Georgescu-Roegen, 1971.) If any purpose is possible at all, why not the orthodox drive for profit? But how can one logically get to an aspiration level if initially all one had was a set of mutually binding constraints? Suppose, for example, that the constraints imposed by labor, stockholders, and various operat- ing divisions of management are conceived and enforced in terms of the share as well as the level of revenue accruing to each group. In that case, the rising aspirations for a rising share of one consensual partner conflict directly with the aspirations of the others, all of whom would also like rising shares, and to speak of an aspiration level of the group makes no sense. Indeed, the original bargain is the only one which leaves no one worse off relative to what he or she was at least at one time prepared to agree to.3 But even that bargain is now (by hypothesis) unsatisfactory to at least one participant. So one can no longer explain the firm as a consensual organization, and the Cyert-March paradigm of group aspirations falls apart. It cannot explain decision-making under conditions of limited coercion, despite the fact that this is evi- dently the prevalent form of decision-making in modern corporate life. Nevertheless, most economists swallowed the Cyert-March notion of an aspiration level rather easily, since it leads back to the old familiar debate, which is over the claim that such constructs differ from and improve on profit-maximization in an uncertain world. As has been pointed out by defenders of maximizing models: ... it must be re-emphasized that the behaviorists never even suggest that the pricing procedures which they describe are in any sense irratio- nal. On the contrary, they maintain that these are part of a reasonable process of adaptation to the circumstances and, in particular, to uncertain- ty. (Baumol and Stewart, 1971, p. 134) 30ne might think that all participants could agree on the desirability of more rev- enue (a bigger firm), but even this is not so. Growth requires investment, which uses resources, and so even the rate of investment is limited by conflicting demands for wages, dividends, and other claims on income. More rapid growth also entails greater risk, which may lead to objections from risk-averse participants, and so on.</page><page sequence="9">GALBRAITH AND THE CORPORATION 51 In context, this remark is intended as a compliment to the Cyert- March approach. Yet, over the long run, the lack of a clear distinction between satisficing models and profit-maximization-under-uncertainty has discouraged research by economists into the real business corporation. Galbraith's corporation An emancipated theory of the corporation requires burning every bridge to the purposive, structurally rational, neoclassical firm. That is what Galbraith does. The corporation in The New Industrial State is first and last and only an organization. In Galbraith, organizational control is not a means to a purpose. It is simply a state of being. It exists, first, as an imperative of tech- nology, of the need for personnel deeply and narrowly imbued with specific technical knowledge, and of the vast diffusion of needed knowledge which such specialization entails. Second, it is an impera- tive of management, of the need for informed, reliable, and coordinat- ed decisions, and of the need to secure acquiescence in them of all parties who are contracting members of the organizational coalition. Decisions about complex technology in a complex bureaucracy in a complex market cannot be taken by individuals, only by groups. Gal- braith writes: When power is exercised by a group, not only does it pass into the organization but it passes irrevocably. (Galbraith, 1967, p. 66) The Technostructure is the group to whom power passes. On the nature of this entity there is particular confusion. Interpreters of Gal- braith tend to construe the technostructure as a specialized term for management, so that the goals of the technostructure can be thought of as the goals of management. For the professional analytical economist, it is essential to accept that Galbraith is dealing in loose but not necessarily unreal con- cepts. . . . Thus his "Technostructure" is an organism of large autono- mous cells, interacting, but not colluding, in a manner that justifies sometimes treating the whole as if it were a unified elite. (Marris, 1967, p. 240)</page><page sequence="10">52 JOURNAL OF POST KEYNESIAN ECONOMICS On this view, the Technostructure is nothing more than the Cyert- March coalition-firm whose consensual decision-taking apparatus makes possible treating it as if it were a growth-maximizer-under- uncertainty. And this leads to the reductionist conclusion that Galbraith's alternative economic system ... consists, in effect, of two elements-a skeletal growth model of the corporation . . . and a considerable body of politico-socio-economic flesh which is altogether fatter and pinker. (Ibid.) But this won't do. Behaviorism and managerialism can't substitute; (Germanic) social analysis is called for. The Technostructure is not itself an "organism," or an organization, a division of the corporation, or a synonym for multi-divisional management. The Technostructure is a class in society. As a concept, it is akin to the bourgeoisie, the proletariat, the affluent worker, the leisure class, and the organization man. Thus the goals of the Technostructure (growth, security, techno- logical virtuosity . . . ) are not the goals of the firm; they are attributes associated with prestige in a certain social element. There is no pre- sumption that an organization peopled by members of the Technostructure will effectively pursue the goals that its employees value. The point is instead that the many who do not perform up to the ideal will admire those few who do. Members of the Technostructure may have goals, but the corpora- tion does not. The corporation's employees seek to maintain it as a going concern, and within that framework seek their own advantage- wages, emoluments, job tenure, "golden parachutes," working condi- tions, shares in control-subject to the conditions imposed by all the others. If the corporation grows, that is because growth is a prerequi- site of security for the employees and because there are institutional forces within the firm which lay a claim on revenue for new invest- ment. Galbraith's corporation is not rational in the sense applied by orthodoxy to the firm, of adapting in reasonable ways to uncertain conditions in the pursuit of given goals. But it is not irrational either. It is simply neither anthropomorphic nor arithmomorphic: it aspires to nothing and it maximizes nothing. Where it went Galbraith's corporation is the logical culmination of behavioral and bureaucratic theory. But the economics profession has never taken up</page><page sequence="11">GALBRAITH AND THE CORPORATION 53 the challenge of the failure of the structural rationality postulate. For- mal economics makes no defense of the structural rationality of the firm. Galbraith's complaint-that actual economic organizations can- not do what theorists would like them to do-has gone unanswered. Instead, the response of the profession has been to focus attention on the much more narrowly drawn question of whether the specific objec- tive function which they had been maximizing should be retained or replaced. Thus the debate was over the use of the assumption of profit- maximization in an economics of the corporation. The debate is summed up in Marris and Wood (1971). Marris describes that book as "a professional response to both Galbraith and his critics." Contributors include Arrow, Baumol and Stewart, Solow, Marris, Wood, Lintner, and Williamson. Papers cover all aspects of the professionally respectable alternatives to profit-maximization, employing frameworks ranging from general equilibrium to partial equilibrium to behaviorist. There is an underlying consensus, expressed by Solow, that while "it is useful to think of a 'typical' firm as maximizing something, . . . it may not matter very much exactly what firms are trying to maximize" (pp. 318-319). Economic research can continue as before, incorporating the behaviorists and growth maximizers as interesting variants on the traditional theme. Thus the profession's response to Galbraith ignores his central point, which is that, however useful it might be, one cannot correctly theorize that a corporation maximizes anything. Work goes on, and profit- maximization appears entrenched. Yet all is not the same after Galbraith. One senses a steadily declin- ing conviction in the orthodox literature in the manner with which the profit-maximization assumption is advanced. Over thirty years, the methodological basis for the assumption has shifted, with each shift representing a concession that the previous ground was not secure. We have moved from a pure positivism, according to which heuristic modeling may be accepted so long as its forecasts are acceptable; to a pure market determinism, according to which corporation structure is irrelevant to price-quality outcomes; and then to a rough-and-ready methodological relativism, according to which analytical tools should be selected partly to maintain continuity with the work of other profes- sional economists. In the most recent work, there is an implicit recogni- tion that the profit-maximization assumption is not tenable after all, and a search instead for an alternative reconstruction of market deter- minism as the basis for welfare economics.</page><page sequence="12">54 JOURNAL OF POST KEYNESIAN ECONOMICS The declining defense of profit-maximization Milton Friedman long ago formulated the classic defense of profit- maximization (Friedman, 1953). Friedman argued that descriptive ac- curacy of assumptions is not necessary, so long as the behavior of firms corresponds to the predictions of a model which assumes profit-maxi- mization, that is, so long as firms behave "as if" they maximized profits. Friedman's argument is totally effective against most of the alternatives to profit-maximization which have been advanced on a purely deductive theoretical plane, to the extent that such variants can be reformulated as models of profit-maximization-under-constraints. If they can, there is a logical sense in which behavior by the alternative rules is "as if" profit-maximization held. To treat these alternative models as subsets of the profit-maximizing universe makes them acces- sible to the powerful methodology of mathematical maximization tech- niques, the existence of which, in economics, is a justifiably powerful force for methodological conservatism. Friedman's defense, however, fails when applied to the study of real corporations. Simon has explained why: the conditions under which it would be permissible to argue that firms do behave "as if" they maximized profits-competition, ownership control, perfectly rational corporate bureaucratic organizations-are not the conditions of real life (Simon, 1979). Friedman's familiar counter, that the falsity of the assumptions does not matter so long as the (indirect) implications are valid, is refuted as a basis for economic theory by Koopmans: such a methodology permits the reclassification of all falsified implications into assumptions and hence empties the theory of testable content (Koopmans, 1957, pp. 137-142). By now, most economists accept Koopmans's methodological position, and few would insist that re- search into real corporations be conducted under the presumption of profit-maximization or rest an argument for such a procedure on Friedman's grounds. Machlup, following Alchian and others, takes a different tack. He denies that there is any need at all for economists to study real business behavior. Rather, it is assumptions about markets, rather than about firms, which are the vital ingredients of price theory and welfare economics: The model of the firm in theory is not, as so many writers believe, designed to serve to predict and explain the behavior of real firms;</page><page sequence="13">GALBRAITH AND THE CORPORATION 55 instead, it is designed to explain and predict changes in observed prices (quoted, actual, received) as effects of particular changes in conditions (wage rates, interest rates, import duties, excise taxes, technology). In this causal connection the firm is only a theoretical link, a mental con- struct helping to explain how one gets from the cause to the effect. (Machlup, 1967) Like Friedman, Machlup has a point, appropriately directed at those who criticize from within the methodology of orthodox model-build- ing. The burden of the mainstream challenge to profit-maximization is to show, if possible, that different and superior price-theoretic implica- tions might be devised. In general this effort has been pursued under competitive assumptions, and under those assumptions in most impor- tant instances the results have not contradicted orthodox theory in sufficiently important ways. So the fact that managers, in these models, might think they are maximizing growth or sales is only a source of confusion: it is the market, not internal psychology, which is dictating the laws of behavior. The flaw in the conventional substitutes for profit- maximization is their injection of alternative behavioral hypotheses into an environment that does not admit alternative behavior. Galbraith's corporation transforms this situation totally. It is not subject to the market; its advertisers aspire to master the market. It deals through the media with the public as a molder (advertising, promotion, public relations) as well as observer of consumer demand. Therefore its behavior is not subject to the disciplines of competitive price theory. What the managers may think they are doing may be no more relevant to Galbraith than to Machlup, but Machlup's suggested escape from study of the behavior of the real business firm does not apply. And, once again, though not always for precisely this reason, most economists have retreated from Machlup's ground. Few would today regard market structure as sufficiently determinative to support normative conclusions (for example, on anti-trust matters) without independent research into business conduct and performance. With the principled versions thus in weak repair, Baumol and Stew- art (1971) offer a pragmatic variant of the orthodox defense. They do not insist that economic research either sublimate the firm into the market or impose its postulates a priori on real business behavior. They argue instead that behavioral and traditional models do not necessarily have different empirical predictions. Therefore, they say, the burden of proof should lie with the dissenters from profit-maximization, as the purveyors of a new theory, to show what difference their hypothesis makes:</page><page sequence="14">56 JOURNAL OF POST KEYNESIAN ECONOMICS While we have followed the standard discussion in contrasting the behavioral models with the more traditional maximization models, it does not follow that they are necessarily incompatible. One cannot assume in advance that they will yield conflicting predictions. Thus even if the empirical evidence turns out to favor strongly the behavioral models, we are not automatically forced to abandon our older tools even as instru- ments of description. Baumol and Stewart are correct in a sense: it is the obligation of the dissenter to overturn the established creed. However, the standard they set is unmeetable in principle. They challenge dissenters to present empirical implications of their theories which are "incompatible" with profit-maximization. Yet no such precise empirical implications of profit-maximization itself exist. The reason is that profit-maximization (and its "implications") are not hypotheses at all, not a set of supposi- tions which can be judged true or false by evidence, but assumptions, or a framework within which to interpret facts, a way of thinking about the world. Baumol and Stewart cite a preference for "older" methodology. By this they mean it is their preference not to trade a well-developed, elegant, and powerful system of thought for one whose implications would have to be worked out from scratch. This, too, is a perfectly valid defense against alternative formulations which accept the structural rationality of the firm. But it cannot defend the continued use of the neoclassical "firm" when Galbraith's "corporation" is needed, any more than Friedman's methodology can, for the same reason: the conditions under which it would be appropriate to employ such meth- odology do not hold. Again, many economists today would accept this. A new body of work on decision-making with limited information acknowledges de facto that profit-maximization is an untenable assumption (Nelson and Winter, 1976; 1977; Nelson, Winter, and Schuette, 1976). We have instead "intended profit-maximization" and the study of conditions under which it might coincide with the real thing. And recent work on industrial structure-the theory of "contestable markets"-appears heavily influenced by the perceived weakness of prior rationales for the use of orthodox methodology (see Baumol, 1982). Perfect contestability seeks to expand the domain in which the results of perfect competition hold, but finds instead that in the intertemporal case- which is to say the domain of all significant real phenomena-one cannot infer efficient resource allocation from contestable market</page><page sequence="15">GALBRAITH AND THE CORPORATION 57 structure. Thus orthodox economics, following its own development, is coming round to the conclusions that Galbraith reached, for different and less tortured reasons, fifteen years ago. Normative implications and professional politics The preceding arguments suggest that Galbraith's corporation has not yet been addressed by the economics profession but that the time may be approaching. If so, a serious subdiscipline within the profession, devoted to research on the corporation, is needed. Here, there is an- other problem. The research methods available for studying real corpo- rations are, at present, too primitive to command the respect of the economics profession. They involve techniques of field work which most economists have never learned. They require statistical knowl- edge sometimes quite different from that imparted in an ordinary econometrics training. There is a shortage of well-defined research problems. All of these difficulties are common at the outset of a new scientific endeavor. But whether they will be remedied is a matter of the politics of the economics profession: whether professional advance- ment can be tied to competent publication in this field. Whether this can be done may well hinge on a willingness by econo- mists to accept as legitimate a kind of normative analysis to which they are not accustomed. For the Galbraithian method divides normative from positive differently, and in a more value-neutral way, than stan- dard analysis does. Where the method of orthodox analysis is to define the conditions of the ideal-thereby injecting values into the analysis at the outset-and then to compare the ideal with the actual to see to what extent ideal conditions apply, the Galbraithian method is to define the conditions of the actual pure and simple, and only afterward and inci- dentally to pass judgment on it. As a matter of methodology, the necessity of having welfare bench- marks in one's theory ought to be considered a drawback. The fact that a theoretical system biases judgment, that it yields good descriptions of ideal outcomes though poor descriptions of actual situations, would not be thought in any other science to give it a special claim to dominate the art of describing actual situations. Yet, for orthodox economists this is the case: the normative superstructure of profit-maximization is a principal reason in favor of keeping it as the foundation of the theory of the firm. Without the prospect of progress toward efficiency, toward optimality, what would be the purpose of knowledge?</page><page sequence="16">58 JOURNAL OF POST KEYNESIAN ECONOMICS Galbraith's corporation, lacking structural rationality, is devoid of normative content. Galbraith has been read by some as a stern critic of the modern business firm, and by others as an apologist for it. But one cannot say from his theory whether the corporation is good or bad, efficient or not; the terms lose meaning when there is no goal for the corporation to pursue. In the matter of value theory, Galbraith drives us toward the original nihilistic conclusion of Veblen: . . in so far as business ends and methods dominate modern industry, the relation between the usefulness of the work . . . and the remuneration of it is remote and uncertain to such a degree that no attempt at formulating such a relation is worthwhile. (Veblen, 1978, p. 63) In Galbraith's theoretical world, all the values have to come from outside the theory. The theorist has freedom of choice to favor or oppose most given states of affairs; the theory itself does not say unambiguously which to pick. An example is advertising. Galbraith's view is not that economic theory shows advertising to be a social bad. It is instead that the orthodox defense of advertising on deductive grounds is invalid. Therefore, the theorist is entitled, as economist as well as citizen, to form his own judgment. Such a situation discomfits the orthodox. Economists feel entitled to opinions, but they do not feel that it is part of their professional license to inject opinion into their work. True members of the Technostructure, economists pursue the technocratic ideal, donning figurative white coats as they pass into the classroom or computer center. Orthodoxy is a package deal; the values come bundled into the theory. The net effect is that those interested in an allegedly value-free approach to welfare questions-while carefully safeguarding the par- ticular values the theory endorses-find Galbraith's freethinking para- digm inhospitable to their work. Institutionalism opens to question the ideals on which normative economics is based, and this is an annoying impediment to those who want to get on with it. The charge of opinionation and the label of critic are laid at Galbraith's door, when, from the other perspective, it is simply a matter of sanctioned against unsanctioned opinion. Conclusion Galbraith's professional colleagues have taken a long time, and a circuitous road, to arrive where he stood fifteen years ago before the</page><page sequence="17">GALBRAITH AND THE CORPORATION 59 void which is an economics pertinent to the modern corporation. The essence of that void is the underdevelopment in economics of a theory of power. Power relations, not market relations, are the heart of the corporation and its dealings with other corporations, government and labor, and often also with the consumer. Without a theory of power, no theory of the modern corporation can go beyond the anthropomorphism of the neoclassical view. It is perhaps not so strange, therefore, that Galbraith's own theoretical development has led him from The New Industrial State to The Anatomy of Power. One might hope that the elaboration of a theory of the corporation will now pick up again from here. REFERENCES Baumol, William J. "On the Theory of the Expansion of the Firm."
