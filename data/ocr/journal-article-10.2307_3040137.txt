<plain_text><page sequence="1">Ishmael and the Problem of Formal Discontinuities in Moby Dick An aspect of Moby Dick that Melvillians either take for granted or notice with uneasiness, without offering a satisfactory solution, seems to be the novel's modal heterogeneity.' Ishmael's narrative ranges through a gamut of styles that includes the colloquial, comical, descriptive, didactic and lyrical. This in itself is understandable, particularly in view of Melville's affinity for the Elizabethans. But when the mode of presentation abruptly changes from the first-person fictional convention established at the outset to the theatrical asides purporting to reveal the privacy of Ahab's mind, or of Starbuck's and Stubb's, and to the dramatized turmoil of the whole crew assembled in the forecastle, with apparently incongruous stage directions,2 we may ask if this leap violates the formal unity of the book. One example of such a glaring transition is to be found in Chapter 119: " Bad work, bad work! Mr. Starbuck," said Stubb, regarding the wreck, "but the sea will have its way. Stubb, for one, can't fight it. You see, Mr. I For instance, Gabriele Baldini in Melvi;lle o le ambiguit&amp;d (Milan, 1952) calls Moby Dick a " cento," while John Parke, author of " Seven Moby-Dicks " in Interpretations of American Literature ed. by Feidelson and Brotkorb (New York, 1959), downgrades Ishmael, for similar reasons, to the status of a mere narrative " device " having the only purpose of introducing us to Ahab, the real protagonist. R. W. Short, author of "Melville as Symbolist" in Inter- pretatiwons, cit., speaks of " incongruity " and of Melville's inability to create solid characters. Richard Sewall, in The Vision of Tragedy (New Haven, 1959) notices a shift in focus when Ishmael disappears from the stage to make room for Ahab; Granville Hicks instead, author of "A Re-reading of Moby Dick " in Twelve Original Essays on Great American Novels (ed. Charles Shapiro, Detroit, 1958), defends Ishmael's consistency as a dramatis persona and Melville's right " to break through the limitations of first- person narrative" to "enter directly into the mind of Ahab or any other characters." 2 Moby Dick, chapters 37-40; also chapter 108 and chapters 120-122. 516 Modern Language Notes</page><page sequence="2">Starbuck, a wave has such a great long start before it leaps, all round the world it runs, and then comes the spring! But as for me, all the start I have to meet it, is just across the deck here. But never mind; it's all in fun: so the old song says "; - (sings) Oh! jolly is the gale, etc. At the end of the chantey the narrative convention is re-established by an " ' Avast Stubb,' cried Starbuck, . . ." and sustained until Ahab's celebrated address to the spirit of fire occasions an interjected stage-direction that breaks once again the storytelling approach: " . Oh, thou clear spirit, of thy fire thou madest me, and like a true child of fire, I breathe it back to thee." (Sudden, repeated flashes of iightning; the nine flames teap length-wise to thrice their previous height; etc... . " The boat! the boat! " cried Starbuck, . . . These repeated modal shifts 'make for an instability of point of view which prompts some critics to discount Ishmael as a realized and consistent actor-spectator, and to consider him as a mere narrative device Melville feels free to discard when he sees fit. On this showing, Ishmael would fare very poorly when compared with another famous fictional narrator - Huckleberry Finn. Yet Melville had consistently used the autobiographical convention in the five novels that preceded Moby-Dick, and it was only in the last named that he allowed himself the modal discontinuities which seem to crack the unifying frame of first-person narration in the past tense. We can therefore assume that he was deliberately experimenting with his favorite fictional form, and if so, a closer look at the much- discussed masterpiece should yield some clue to the peculiar design he was thus striving to achieve. The imaginative contract he initially undertook to fulfill with his reader might then prove to have been honored in a subtler way than was expected. To begin with, in the crucial chapter-clusters where modes switch, the sequence reveals a significant order. Chapter 37, which gives, us Ahab's unspoken thoughts in the form of direct discourse, with the external presentation reduced to introductory stage directions in brackets, is prepared for by the ending of the previous chapter (". . . they all dispersed; and Ahab retired within his cabin."). Moreover, Chapter 36 itself contains an aside (interjected in the exchange between Ahab and Starbuck) that begins to tilt the prose form from narrative to dramatic. The chapter is full of lively dia- logue anyway and marks a high point in the development of the action, with Ahab subduing Starbuck's dissent and winning over to VOL.

The whole scene is loud and intrinsically theatrical; the transition to Ahab's inner monologue, followed by Starbuck's antithetic one in Chapter 38 and by Stubb's half-muttered, half-hummed divagations in Chapter 39, achieves an immediacy of its own in the very lowering of tone. Then, at the end of a very short chapter, Stubb emerges from his private, erratically carefree thoughts to answer Starbuck's call; and with this we are ready for a new outburst of theatrical action in the forecastle (Chapter 40). This picturesquely wild scene, with its sailor chanteys, its quick exchanges of jokes, insults and challenges, and its narrowly averted knife fight, functions like a diabolic chorus to Ahab's solo; and its ominous background is finally emphasized by Pip's lonely dismay in the storm. The return to a straight narrative form in Chapter 41 is skilfully modulated by the exclamatory beginning that reabsorbs all the turmoil in the narrator's own self without falling to an anticlimax: I, Ishmael, was one of that crew; my shouts had gone up with the rest; my oath had been welded with theirs; and stronger I shouted, and more did I haTnmer and clinch my oath, because of the dread in my soul. A wild, mystical, sympathetical feeling was in me; Ahab's quenchless feud seemed mine. . Because of its strategic collocation and of its intense tone, that initial phrase " I, Ishmael, was one of that crew " rivals the felicitous opening of the whole narration: " Call me Ishmael." And in a way it is as if the book began again, with the problem of the albino whale, Ahab's involvement in it and its meaning to each and all of the crew members, Ishmael in particular. The shock of demoniac revelation, conveyed in Chapters 36-40 in the appropriate form of dramatic immediacy, starts Ishmael's wholly unacademic meditations on Moby Dick, Ahab, the Whiteness of the Whale and the chances of meeting the same whale twice in mortal combat. He is now endeavoring to understand the confusing world of which he was a part, and his own part in it, by recollecting the " emotion" (and commotion) in a present situation of "tranquillity." He is really trying to understand himself; this is why, in the brooding sequel to the first dramatic climax of the book, he is once again in- tensely present, as he was in the very first chapters. Yet he is present here in a totally different way, for the Ishmael 518 Modern Lanauaoe Notes</page><page sequence="4">of those chapters had the objective presence of a character involved in comical adventures told by the narrating voice, while now his presence is felt as the very presence of the evoker in the act of con- juring up the past: "I, Ishmael. . . ." In a direct comparison of this beginning with the first beginning of the book, significance attaches also to the equally crucial, if inverse, part the narrator's name plays in each: for it appears as an object of the conjuring verb " call" the first time, and as an apposition to the conjuring subject the second time -nor is the difference a purely grammatical one. The focus was on the remembered actor of the adventure in the former context, and is now on the remembering spectator. We shall see that this shift in Ishmael's role, and his subsequent self-effacement in his own narra- tion, are of structural import. The second appearance of the dramatic form occurs in Chapter 108, with the " Promethean" dialogue between Ahab and the car- penter. This is in itself less climactic than the first dramatic cluster, as described above, or than the third one, which it may be said to forecast. The emphasis in the dialogue is on thought rather than action, with a strong ironic effect resulting from the interplay of the carpenter's uncomprehending good humor and Ahab's titanic defiance. Action, however, is not wanting, since the carpenter happens to be working on Ahab's new whalebone leg which will enable the Pequod's hitherto secretive skipper to appear more freely on deck and estab- lish a direct and frequent contact with his crew - with the momentous consequences we know. As for the dialogue itself, its poignant irony and philosophical overtones make it focal to an understanding of Ahab, who sarcastically likens his humbly creative interlocutor to the anthropomorphic God of popular religion by addressing him as " Man- maker," only to hurl against both the challenge of an unlimited Promethean freedom. He calls himself a "Greek god" and, like Diogenes, wants "a lantern" (the light of pure intellect) for he avowedly has no use for "a blind dome " (an unthinking head, as well as the cathedral of obscurantism) in the architecture of man. He wants an ideal man, untroubled by the weaknesses of the heart, superior to mere homo fabar and his mechanical contrivances, towering in the strength of unhampered mind. In this hybris lies his greatness as well as his damnation, for he repudiates what Hawthorne would call the " common bond " of humanity for the sake of his intellectual pride, and that will make him threaten and silence, in the sequel to this scene, the voice of reason in humane Starbuck (Chapter 109). VOL. LXXVI, June 1961 619</page><page sequence="5">Faustian man imperiously states his need for infinity, and he would probably scoff at the carpenter even if the latter could " work in clay " like the traditional God; in this arrogance he has his nobility and his demonic self-destructiveness, as he well knows since he himself men- tions to his dazed interlocutor the "fiery pains of hell," and when shortly after he brandishes a musket at Starbuck, we know that the demonic side is gaining the upper hand. " Queequeg in his coffin " (Chapter 110) seals this rapid sequence with an ill omen magically attendant on Ahab's dark victory. Thus the emergence of a theatrical mode in Chapter 108, well anticipated by previous discussion of our competent and unthinking carpenter, marks a climax too, albeit a minor one - and it should be added that the scene begins and ends with a soliloquy on the part of the carpenter, as if to stress the fact that his exchange with Ahab is no real exchange, but a mock dialogue. The third and final dramatic cluster centers on Chapters 119-122, and it constitutes a major climax, symmetrical to the earlier one in Chapters 36-40. The elements erupt as Ahab addresses the god of fire and binds the crew to his demoniac covenant (" The Candles "); as in the other cluster, which it resembles in many ways, the emer- gence of theatrical form is announced by the mixed mode of the first chapter of the series and culminates in a chorus of mates and crew. The latter is now represented by Tashtego on the main-top-sail yard, echoing with his mutter the thunder and lightning, although the whole crew has appeared around Lucifer-like Ahab in " The Candles"; and in between, the inevitable exchange of Ahab with Starbuck takes place (Chapter 120). We might observe that Chapter 118 (" The Quadrant") ushers in the whole scene by showing Ahab as destroyer of the all-too-rational instrument, and finds a symmetrical echo after- wards in Chapter 124 with the ominous inversion of the compass- needle. Though Ahab had asserted the supremacy of intellect in his talk with the carpenter, he is now discarding reason for magnetism; the demonic side (extrinsically symbolized by Fedallah) now domi- nates both the ship and his mind, as the blood-baptism of the harpoon had made clear in Chapter 113: "Ego te non baptizo in nomine patris, sed in nomine diaboli! " This last series of theatrical chapters prolongs itself, through " The Log and the Line," " The Life-Buoy " and the interjected " The Pequod meets the Rachel" (Ch. 128), in two additional dramatic ones: " The Deck " (Ch. 127) and " The Cabin " (Ch. 129). In "The Log and the Line" the crew tries to determine the position 620 Modern Language Notes</page><page sequence="6">of the ship, with what rudimentary instruments are left after Ahab's outbursts; in " The Life-Buoy " a sailor dies and is buried, ironically enough, in a " life-buoy," while " The Deck " reverses the irony by envisioning Queequeg's coffin as a life-preserver - which it will indeed become for Ishmael at the end of the adventure. Finally in Chapter 129, after the meeting with the ship that bears the name of Rachel, and that will pick up the lonely survivor of the Pequod's shipwreck, we hear Ahab talking to Pip in a return of humane mood, and Pip uttering intimations of death by water. The dramatic coda to our third cluster points to the resolving catastrophe. Obviously, then, the theatrical scenes are focal, and structurally related. The first marks the turn to tragic action and Ishmael's " second beginning " as actor-spectator, and the last precipitates Ahab's and the Pequod's doom; it is foreshadowed by the intermediate one of Chapter 108 and sequel. After "The Candles" there will be no more cetological digressions, only epic, lyrical or dramatic prose directly relevant to the action, and Ishmael will no longer assert his presence as, actor as in Chapter One, or as remembering actor-spectator as in Chapter 41, but will stay in the background, practically disap- pearing in his narration until the epilogue of the shipwreck sees him come to the surface again in objective shape, a survivor in Queequeg's coffin. The result is a speeding of the narrative rhythm towards the vivid conclusion of the third day of the Chase, and this speed-up itself stands out the more effectively because it emerges from the leisurely digressive pace of the first half of the novel. Ishmael's receding to the backstage balances Ahab's striding to the fore, and this suggests that his relation to the hero is very much like Quentin Compson's to Colonel Sutpen in Absalom, Absalom!8 So far, however, we have only shown certain generally structural functions of the dramatic chapters in the overall design of the novel; we still have to prove that their insertion in the narrative flow takes place without breaking the basic convention subscribed by the author. Either Ishmael is an obliging device, to be ignored when the author needs omniscience, or he is a consistent fictional creation, like Comp- son or, say, Conrad's Marlow;- either we see things through his imagina- tive mediation, or we eventually learn them from Melville when his SIt is to the credit of Richard Sewall, op. cit., that he has seen this momentous affinity, although he stops midway in his recognition of Ishmael's role in Melville's novel. Merlin Bowen instead, in The Long Encounter (Uni- versity of Chicago Press, 1960), makes the important point that Ishmael attains self-liberation through acceptance and expression of objectivity. VOL. LXXVI, June 1961 621</page><page sequence="7">talkative brainchild fails to sustain the part. Let us observe, then, that the switch from straight narrative in the past tense to dramatized monologue or scenic dialogue in the present tense is after all the mere heightening of a rhetorical device very common in the classical historians and poets, from Livy to Tacitus and Vergil, not to speak of Dante: the historical present, whereby the author who is telling his story of past events suddenly adopts the present tense to bring home to his audience the poignancy of some particular experience relived now. A typical example would be Aeneas' recounting of the destruction of Troy to queen Dido in Book II of the Aeneid, where the historical present expresses the presentness of grief: " infandum, regina, iubes renovare dolorem "- and Aeneas really renews his sorrow in the act of reminiscing. In Dante's Inferno, an appropriate illustration would come from Canto V, lines 25-28, where he re-enacts in harrowed memory his entrance into Hell's second circle: "Now the painful voices begin to be heard; now I have come where much moaning strikes me. I came to a place bereft of light. . . ." Melville himself liberally uses the device, as in the beginning of Typee, where the breezy introductory paragraphs sustain the illusion of an action contemporary to the telling of it, before shifting to the verbal per- spective of the past. Now, if we accept Goethe's theory that epic poetry has to do with the past while dramatic poetry unfolds an action imagined as present, Melville's shift from one mode to the other within a narrative (i. e. epic) work will appear to embody the natural movement of memory striving to recapture lost actuality. Ishmael, like Quentin Compson, like Aeneas, like Dante, is both his- torian and participant, and he spontaneously tries to pass, at the climactic points, from history as historia rerum gestarum to history as res gestae in the making; the shift takes place entirely within his consciousness. "I, Ishmael, was one of that crew . . . ;" it is as if he were saying: " I am the man, I suffered, I was there." And with a slight modification of another line from the same stanza of Song of Myself, Ishmael could also say: "I do not describe the wounded man, I myself become the wounded man. . . ." For he is a conjurer endeavoring to evoke, to make present, his improbable hero: "Ahab, my Captain, still moves before me in all his Nantucket grim- ness and shagginess. . . ." In this perspective, Ahab's, Starbuck's and the other crew members' asides do not lose plausibility; they are 4Moby Diok, chapter 33. 522 Modem Lc;nguage Notes</page><page sequence="8">the conjuring narrator's imaginative reconstruction of the characters he knew, the As If of imagination becoming a presentational Here. Melville's Elizabethan asides look forward to Faulkner's italicized stream-of-consciousness passages in the course of which Thomas Sutpen and his harried family rise from the dead in Quentin Comp- son's voice. There has been James Joyce in between, of course; but in both Moby DicAk and Absalom, Absalom! memory modulates into imagination, and we share the experience of creation in progress. For Ishmael is the artist in the act of telling us, and struggling to understand, his crucial experience. When his autobiography be- comes the history of the Pequod and Ahab, he is liberated from his " hypos" for the second time, and in a deeper sense: he attains the liberation of imaginative objectivity. Thus his vanishing from the stage after a certain point does not constitute a breach of poetical continuity, but a dialectical movement that reproduces and expands the repeated transition from narrative to drama, from memory to visionary actuality, from conjuring subjectivity to conjured objec- tivity. It will help to recall that Chapter 32 (" Cetology ") hu- morously describes the sizes of the various species of whales in terms of book-formats, an obvious literary metaphor, and that the allusions to the story as a book in the making (often attuned to self-mockery) abound significantly.5 If so, it should be possible to accept Ishmael as a persona of Mel- ville, invisibly present through his narration when he ceases to be directly present in it; and that this persona, even as he ceases to have objective existence, has dramatic existence as actor-spectator of a half-remembered, half-conjured action. Ishmael is the self-ironizing writer seeking, and finally achieving, realization through self-efface- ment in the work of art; following him in the process, we see the poetry arise from its (cetological) materials, and the discontinuities acquire the meaning of imaginative gestures within the context of a work in progress. They are indeed the structural equivalents of the copious hyperboles which animate Melville's baroque prose.
