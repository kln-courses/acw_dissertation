<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Horned Moses by E. G. SUHR THE transfiguration of Moses, as related by the writer of Exodus, is one of the most impressive scenes of the Old Testament. When Moses came down from Mount Sinai with the two tablets of testi- mony, 'Moses did not know that the skin of his face shone because he had been talking with God." In the following verse we read: 'And when Aaron and all the people of Israel saw Moses, behold, the skin of his face shone, and they were afraid to come near him.' At the end of the chapter the same manifestation is repeated: 'And when he came out and told the people of Israel what he was com- manded, the people of Israel saw the face of Moses, that the skin of Moses' face shone; and Moses would put the veil upon his face again, until he went in to speak to him (God).' First we must note that the word 'shone' is repeated three times, a fact that lends special emphasis to this feature of what has generally been called the theophany of Moses. We must also bear in mind that the attribute is applied to the skin, which implies that the shining brilliance covered his whole body and no doubt shone through his drapery; it was manifest not only on the head or a par- ticular area of the head. We are also told that it frightened the people of Israel. When this light is compared with that of the sun or with a light even more dazzling, we must admit it could be startling, even blinding, but why should it frighten the people? One might turn his eyes away from a bright light but not neces- sarily in horror. To mitigate the effects of the light Moses put a veil on his head, which was not necessary when he spoke with God, implying that Moses had become so imbued with divinity, he and he alone could stand within the radiance of the light of God. Such a manifestation of light we are also familiar with from the account of the arming of Achilles2 and the presence of the Arthurian Grail,3 where it also has a terrifying effect. 1 Exodus xxxiv. 29. 2 Iliad, XIX, 12-15. 3 Malory (Strachey), XIII, 7. 387</page><page sequence="2">THE HORNED MOSES When we turn to the Hebrew version or the Vulgate we find another word used in place of 'shone'. The latter renders Exodus xxxiv. 29: 'et ignorabat quod cornuta esset facies sua ex consortio sermonis Domini.' Verse 35 is translated as follows: 'Qui videbant faciem egredientis Moysi esse cornutam... .' Here we are told that the face of Moses was 'horned', and although the face alone is mentioned, we may assume that the quality of 'horned', whatever it was, can be applied to the whole face; we can hardly assume that 'horned' applies only to one or two small areas of the face. If 'horned' was confined to small areas, would it have frightened the people of Israel, and how could Moses have covered or con- cealed the horns with a veil? Is there any connection between the light implied in 'shone' and the horned quality of Moses' skin, and if so, what does it mean? Michelangelo and other artists of the Renaissance no doubt pondered over these passages before they added the two horns projecting from the head of Moses in painting and sculpture. The sculptor made them rather short, while Andrea da Firenze fashioned horns more befitting a god of the Norse sagas.4 De Tolnay5 claims the sculptor was misled by an erroneous translation, in the Vulgate, for the Hebrew 'light', and so the horns have no place on Moses' head. Interestingly enough, however, he adds that the Moses of Michelangelo is a cosmic being in which the elements of fire, water and earth 'burst forth in a cataclysm'. Louis Reau makes the following comment: 'C'est cette traduction fautive qui a donne naissance au type du Moise cornu.'6 Both critics claim, then, that the horns are due to a faulty translation, implying that the 'shone' is preferable. Whatever we may think of these state- ments, we can understand how Michelangelo and his contem- poraries, after examining other passages of Scripture in which the words horn and unicorn are used as symbols of power,7 finally settled on the projecting horns. But such horns, as we shall see, do not seem to fill the require- 4 M.

How is the awkwardness of the passage dealt with by the commentator ? One of the older authorities8 informs us that the Vulgate erroneously rendered the Hebrew 'Karan' as 'horned' instead of 'irradiate, to shoot forth or emit rays of light'. Another9 agrees on the error in the text, but admits that it is usual to render the Hebrew word for 'horned' as 'to radiate light'. If this statement is true, it means that the textual error is not so serious, that the Hebrew word carries implications of 'horned' as well as 'shining light'. What quality of the skin this can refer to will occupy our attention later. Cheyne adds that perhaps the two horns of Moses may be traced to the two horns of Amon of Egypt which were later used for the portrait of Alexander the Great on his coins. The Interpreter's Bible'o claims that 'horns', as in Job iii. 4, denote rays of light or lightning flashes; the veil was used to mitigate the reflection of divine glory too sacred for human eyes. My own experience has taught me to beware of accusing an ancient scribe or artist of making an error or using faulty symbolism in drawing; frequently this accusation turns out to be a confession of ignorance or an unwillingness to take into consideration adverse evidence for a pet theory, a procedure which tends to bounce back with a vengeance. In this case, it would be unwise to libel the scribe with a careless mistake, because the 'horned' is repeated three times in the latter part of the same chapter. If he was con- fused or in doubt about the word and its meaning, why did he choose the verb 'horned' to express his meaning, a word whose significance carries us to other parallels in messianic literature? I am inclined to believe that the Hebrew writer and the Vulgate are not in error, that the original scribe knew full well the meaning of the word and used it in the right context. I also agree that the word 'horned' carries the implication of shining light, and, while 'shone' does not bring us back to the original image, it cannot be called wrong. Whether the 'horned' refers to the shape or the surface quality of the original image must be left to the discretion of the reader, after we have made comparisons with other examples. 8 The Comprehensive Commentary on the Holy Bible, ed.

Io81. 389</page><page sequence="4">THE HORNED MOSES The most convincing parallel we find in the glorification or transfiguration of Siegfried. After slaying the dragon and bathing in its blood, his skin became 'horned',"l and loth as some may be to rank him with Moses, the fact remains that he is a messiah, although on a different plane. We infer that the dragon had some invulnerable quality which was passed along to the hero with its skin, and in this case no one has ever, to my knowledge, identified such a feature with a pair of horns on the head. Like Moses in his campaigns against the enemies of the Israelites, Siegfried was always victorious, after his experience with the dragon, on the battlefield, indeed against all foes until the last fatal blow was dealt by Hagen. Apparently the Styx river was also endowed with the dragon-like quality of invulnerability, for after his baptism in its waters by his mother'2 Achilles remained invincible until he was slain by Paris, whose arrow was guided by the god of the sun; we must remember too that the goddess of Victory, who eventually took up her residence with Zeus and Athena on Olympus,'3 was the daughter of the Styx. When Krishna engages the dragon-like monster Kaliya in mortal combat, we are told, the whole horizon was in a blaze from the heat given off by the beast. Encompassed by twining snakes, Balarama exhorts him to put off mortal man and reveal himself as a divinity. The females of the snake-king exclaimed: 'Thou art recognized, O god of gods.... Thou art light supreme, inscrut- able; thou art the mighty lord, the portion of that supreme light. ...' 'Thyself as an oviparous, hooded snake, art the upholder of the world.'l4 Krishna also took on the horned skin of the serpent to cope with the monster, and revealed his divinity in terms of a transfiguration. When Christ takes his position between Moses and Elijah on the mountain of transfiguration, the gospel writers make no mention of the horned skin, but he is saturated with the effulgence of light, and one tells us that 'the fashion of his coun- tenance was altered'.1 What the nature of the change was that came over his face we are not told; we note too that most authorities claim his transfiguration was patterned after that of Moses. Let us 11 Das Nibelungenlied (Karl Bartsch), 1956, III, ioo. 12 Statius, Ach., 269-70. '3 Hesiod, Theog., 386 f. 4" Vishnu Purana (HI. H. Wilson), V, 7. 15 Luke ix. 29. 390</page><page sequence="5">THE HORNED MOSES add here that another symbolic creature equipped with a single horn, the unicorn, has long been recognized as an associate of the messiah,16 albeit the connection between the two has remained nebulous through the ages. Before going further we must ask ourselves what we mean by a messiah. First, he descends from the powers on high, and through- out his life he maintains a connection with the divine, in fact there are a number of occasions during his missionary activity when he reveals himself as a divinity; Christ was the acknowledged son of God, Mithra was born of the sun and Krishna was an avatar of his father Vishnu. The messiah appears on earth in times of despair and persecution, he appears in response to a need, among people who see no way of overcoming the preponderance of evil in their world - he comes to defeat the powers of evil and restore the king- dom of the good; Christ overcomes the world in favour of the spirit; Moses leads his people out of Egypt, consecrates them to Jahweh and conducts them to the promised land; Krishna overwhelms countless evil men and monsters; Siegfried and King Arthur, on another plane, wage a constant war against evil men and render their realms safe for the weak and oppressed. In all the miracles in which the messiah is involved, he functions either as a healer or a provider. Once he has fulfilled his mission he is reabsorbed into the divinity from which he descended, at a time of life when he is still young and in full possession of his powers. No one knows where his mortal remains are buried. Many of the symbols associated with the messiah, e.g. the unicorn and the Grail, are likewise healers and providers, enveloped in mystery and endowed with supernatural strength as well as other miraculous powers. To learn why the messiah owes a debt of tradition to the dragon, we must find some original prototype for the anthropomorphic connection between the heavens and the earth, between a god above and destitute man below. I suggest this can be found in the total solar eclipse which, before primitive man learned the truth about such an astronomical phenomenon, presented itself to man's mind as a dragon-like monster rising from the earth to swallow the sun. We need not stress the shocking effect of such a dramatic experience on man's mind, when he saw the sun, the source of all 16 0.

The sudden- ness, the rapidity of the whole phenomenon made it the prototype,"7 I believe, for many other conflicts in human experience, such as that between summer and winter, day and night, life and death. When the darkness of terror engulfed the sun, it went down into the clutches of death, then was resurrected from darkness, when its light seemed to shine with more brilliance than before. All this was first the occasion of fright, prompting man to do all in his power to scare off the demon of darkness, then of exuberant rejoicing as the sun emerged victorious from the struggle. This experience was the beginning of so many varied connections be- tween heaven and earth in early tradition, sometimes called the cosmic column, then the cosmic tree and eventually the great chain of being, along which influences passed in either direction; it also became the pathway along which the messiah moved to and from the earth. The Hindus have given us the most convincing picture of this drama in one of the Rig-Veda hymns,1s about whose antiquity we can only vaguely speculate: Svarbinu, the later Rahu, discomfited over his failure to obtain his share of the elixir of immortality and his repulse at the hands of Vishnu, closes his jaws around Suirya, the sun. At this moment 'all creatures looked like one who is bewildered, who knoweth not the place where he is standing'. The sun cries out for help: 'Let not the oppressor with this dread, through anger swallow me up, for I am thine, 0 Atri ... thou and King Varuna be both my helpers.' Eventually the sun was revived again. 'The Atris found the sun again, him whom Svarbinu of the brood of Asuras had pierced with gloom. This none besides had power to do.' This incantation, we surmise, was accompanied with the appropriate ritual on the part of the priesthood to aid the sun in his struggle with the demon. As we all know, a similar mythological interpretation of this phenomenon was given by many peoples in various parts of the world. As long as the dragon monster was uppermost in man's mind, the whole experience, as far as the dragon was concerned, was fraught with fear. A decided change in attitude was necessary before it could be reckoned as a more bene- 17 The reader is referred to S. A.

Griffith), V, 40. 392</page><page sequence="7">THE HORNED MOSES ficient being, but it is important to remember that vestiges of the picture of the dragon survived, as we have noted, even in the later messiah. Where can we find a concrete illustration of the dragon attempt- ing to swallow the sun? The best example is on the facade of the sacred house of New Guinea.19 In the shadow of the high gable is a grotesque, round head with very wide open eyes, distended cheeks and an open mouth whose saw-like teeth are plainly visible. The mouth, without a lower jaw, is broad and gaping; a small stick is drawn through the septum of the nose. Beneath the head a long tapering triangle extends to the entrance of the building, its surface marked with scales along its whole length. It may be that the builders of the house knew about the lunar shadow and its shape during a solar eclipse, for the scaly body of the dragon conforms to its outline. Moreover, the expression of the face is mixed: it has an aspect of terror, which we naturally expect of the monster; the sun, however, which he attempts to swallow, radiates a glow of bene- ficence, even ecstasy through the dragon features, so that the creature, in spite of its original intention, is forced into an ambi- valent state. The same features and mixed expression are to be found on the kirttimukha20 of India, the t'ao t'ieh of China and the medusa21 of Greece, all three derived from the same phenomenon. It would be interesting to deal separately with each one of these masks, but it would not contribute much to the thesis of this paper. In the course of time the astronomers and intellectuals realized that the moon, not the dragon, was covering the face of the sun, but the common people persisted in their belief, and the original picture of the dragon survived in the mask for many centuries. Symbolism, over a period of time, has a tendency to be cumulative; while it takes on new forms, something of the original image clings to a later version, even to the anthropomorphic messiah. Once the moon asserted itself in the concept of the eclipse, the shadow and 19 W. H. Rassers, Pafji, the Culture Hero, The Hague, 1959, pl. IV; it was originally published by O.

Kramrisch (The Hindu Temple, II, University of Calcutta, 1946, pp. 322-31) has written an illuminating chapter on the kirttimukha which she calls the Face of Glory. 21 For the medusa see Berytus, XIV, 1961, pl. XIV, I, where the triangular lunar shadow extends through the centre of the forehead, and the eyes of the sun, well over to the edges, are vainly striving to look beyond the limitations of the eclipsing dragon's head. 2E 393</page><page sequence="8">THE HORNED MOSES mask were permeated with increased beneficence, for this heavenly body was an important factor in shedding fertility to the earth.22 The earth's satellite served as a filter or refiner of the light of the sun passing down to the earth, in fact an exchange of influences running upward and downward was thereby greatly facilitated; above all, it afforded man an easier access to the sun which, for many primitive peoples, was the dwelling place of their gods and revered ancestors. For our discussion it is important to know that the lunar shadow and its predecessor, the dragon body with its horned or scaly skin, established a functional connection between the earth and the heavens which could be used by gods and men to their mutual advantage. One more manifestation we must consider: the skin of Moses was not only horned but also included the implication of shining light, which can be accounted for by the light and heat of the sun permeating the body of the dragon or the lunar shadow. Most dragons, in whatever context they appear, are saturated with fire; they pour forth flames from the mouth, thereby scorching the earth and spreading pestilence. The dragon slain by Beowulf (897) was consumed by its own heat. We are also told by E. Topsell2 that when the Indian dragon sets up his scales they shine like silver, a statement that no doubt reflects an old and long- standing superstition, all of which may have some bearing on the manifestation of light during a transfiguration. At any rate, dark- ness and light are mentioned frequently in many of the accounts of theophany. We may consider it natural for writers to draw analogies from the sun and its light in an attempt to describe a theophany, but light radiating from within a body, whether from armour, the Grail or garments of a messiah, is supposedly more concen- trated than sunlight, as the writers admit, and demands further explanation. Let it be understood, in summary, that this investigation in no way weakens the historical validity of the messiah, where history is involved; it is a fact of mythology which may have been imposed on the historical figure after he passed from the scene. It does, however, explain how certain features of mythological symbolism 22 For further details on this subject see my Venus de Milo - The Spinner, New York, 1958, p. 26 f. 23 The Elizabethan Zoo, London, 1926, p. 149- 394</page><page sequence="9">THE HORNED MOSES could have been employed to exaggerate the outstanding features of an outstanding personality. While Michelangelo misinterpreted the horned skin of Moses, I see no reason why we should accuse the Hebrew scribe of an error; he evidently wrote in good faith and with conscious intent; our only regret lies in our ignorance of the context from which he drew his information. 395</page></plain_text>
