<plain_text><page sequence="1">Malcolm Davies TRITON AND THE ARGONAUTS IN PINDAR AND APOLLONIUS In his great commentary on the Fourth Pythian Ode, B.K. Braswell found himself unable to answer two self-posed questions: why does Pindar's Triton call himself Eurypylus? and why does the Argonaut Euphemus take the clod of earth given him by Triton and place it by the entry to Hades?1 In my opinion these questions had already received a satisfactory answer in the course of a very large book which is nowhere mentioned in Braswell's copious bibliogra phy, even though the book in question is the most important single volume to be published by an American classical scholar in the twentieth century2. Paradoxically enough, on one level Braswell's omission of the arguments advanced in Fontenrose's Python is of very little import: his attitude to a similar argument deriving from a different source3 strongly suggests that he would have been, or indeed was, unim pressed by Fontenrose's approach. But I think Fontenrose was right, though a full confirmation of that perception will involve a wide-ranging, if sometimes circuitous, investigation of other liter ary passages than Pindar's Fourth Pythian. To state matters briefly, Fontenrose4 supposed that both Triton/ 1 See notes on Pyth. 4.33 (b) and 44 (b) (Braswell, Commentary, 124). 'Unable' in my first sentence here means, of course, something like «incapable of discovering a solution that would meet the extraordinarily high scholarly standards of the commentary itself». 2 Fontenrose, Python. 3 See Braswell, Commentary, 125 on Pyth. 4.44 (b), where he concludes that «Pindar refers to [ Άίδα στόμα] simply because it was a well-known local landmark. With that we can dispose of the speculation of Malten, Kyrene, pp. 120 1 (cf. also Otto Schroeder, Pyth. ad 4.33), who saw in Eurypylus' name (Malten 120: 'die weiten Tore der Hôlle') a connection with Taenarus». 4 Fontenrose, Python, 482 f.: «Triton, himself son of Poseidon, took the form of Eurypylus, King of Cyrene, also son of Poseidon, when he appeared to Euphemus and guided the Argo through the shoals. Or, as Apollonius [Arg. 4.1561] has it, Triton and Eurypylus are the same ... [Eurypylus'] name, which means "he whose gates are wide", may well be an epithet of Hades». And again:</page><page sequence="2">54 MALCOLM DAVIES Eurypylus and Euphemus ('the originai euphemism') were in one sense death-demons. The names 'Eurypylus' and 'Euphemus' indi rectly allude to this fact. The hypothesis can be more readily proved for the former of these two figures so I begin with him. I Triton's claim to have been originally a death-demon rests upon two sets of considérations: (i) his status as an Old Man of the Sea; (ii) his status as, in folk-tale terms, a 'helper figure'. The first of these is relatively unproblematic. No one would seriously contest that Triton, like, for instance, Nereus, Proteus, Phorcys, represents that primeval entity known in ancient Greek as the άλιος γέρων5. The next stage, then, is to show that Old Men of the Sea were associated with the Other- or Underworld. This too is quite easily done, using evidence already available to, and largely exploited by, Fontenrose6.1 have recently reassessed this evidence in a différent context7 and found it more than adequate. The main aspect to be considered is the Old Man of the Sea's équivalence to the Herdsman of the Dead8, as evidenced by Proteus' herd of seals. Also relevant are connections between the Sea and the Otherworld9, the primeval notion of the realm of the dead as a territory to be reached beyond a stretch of water. Ali this is summed up eloquently in the words of one of the first classical scholars10 adequately to appreciate this side of the Old Man of the Sea: he describes him as «originally one of those démons which, for the benefit of the lonely skipper in «Euphemus... too was a son of Poséidon ... He came from Taenarum, well known for its passage to the lower world. It was he who received a clod of earth from Triton in Libya; and this clod he either cast into the sea or into Hades' entrance at Taenarum, in which variation we again perceive sea and underworld as équiva lents. His name ... may be a désignation of Hades or Thanatos, as Eumenides or Semnae Theae of the Erinyes». 5 See, for instance, my remarks in Davies, Stesichorus, 278 ff. and Forbes Irvine, Metamorphosis, 76 ff. 6 Fontenrose, Python, 331 ff. 7 Sec Davifs, Stesichorus, 278 ff. 8 See Davies, Stesichorus, 280 f. 9 See Davies, Stesichorus, 280 and n. 22, adding to the references in the lat ter Patch, Other World, Index, s.v. island and Horn, Insel. 10 Duhn, Begriissung, 121: «urspriinglich einer jenen Dàmonen, welche dem einsamen Schiffer in unbekannten...

These percipient words are a useful transition to the next, slight ly less tractable, stage of the argument. For Old Men of the Sea, like, for instance, Nereus in the Tenth and Eleventh Labours of Heracles, can play a role best epitomised by the phrase 'helper fig ure' . I use the words in what is virtually a technical sense to convey the fact that, in folktales dealing with an heroic quest, there is reg ularly an encounter between the hero and a numinous or demonic creature who has to be persuaded or compelled to provide tangible aid or less tangible guidance towards the goal of the quest11. Such an encounter has been given the appropriate label of ' Voraben teuefor 'preliminary adventure'12. There is no difficulty about interpreting in this sense Heracles' encounters with Nereus, as aforementioned, near the start of his quests for the cattle of Geryon or the apples of the Hesperides13, and Aristaeus' similar encounter with Proteus near the start of his quest to recover his bees (Vergil, Geòrgie 4.415 ff.)14. When we come to the Argonauts' encounter with Triton in Libya, however, we are faced with a problem of structure, as it were: for this is in no sense a 'preliminary adventure' near the start of a hero's quest15. On the contrary, it occurs near the end of the quest, and involves heroes who are trying to get home, having already won the Golden Fleece and carried off Medea16. But I believe one can advance a solution for this problem. The 11 This schema was first properly appreciated by Propp, Morphology (first Russian édition 1928; first English édition 1958: further détails in my article in n. 5 above, 278, n. 7). 12 A term first used by Meuli, Odyssee, 15 ff. = Ges. Schriften, 2, 604 ff. 13 See Davies, Stesichorus, 279, n. 10. 14 See Davies, Aristaeus, 58 ff. 15 The role of 'helper figure' in the early stage of the Argonauts' quest was originally occupied by Phineus, as Meuli (above, n. 12) first saw. Cfr. my remarks in Davies, Stesichorus, 283. 16 In a number of recent articles I have argued that features of the 'preliminary adventure' with the helper figure are to be discerned within épisodes of various stories, even though those épisodes occur near the end of the relevant quest: see on Jacob's wrestling with the adversary in Genesis my remarks in this same volume of «St. Class. Or.», 13-22 and on Neoptolemus' encounter with Philoctetes at Lemnos Davies, Philoctetes, 352. But I have decided the interests of scholarly rigour will be best served if I argue such an interprétation of Triton's role de novo here, rather than relying on the above potential parallele.</page><page sequence="4">56 MALCOLM DAVIES scholar quoted above on the Old Man of the Sea as guide through unknown straits had earlier written a dissertation entitled de Menelai itinere Aegyptio17, with reference to Menelaus' ambush of Proteus. In fact, this passage proves very much to the point. In Od. 4.360 ff., Menelaus' encounter with Proteus bears ali the marks of a 'preliminary adventure': at mid-day the hero ambushes a numi nous, demonic being on the sea-shore and compels him to supply information relevant to the goal of his journey. But actually, the adventure occurs nowhere near the beginning of Menelaus' quest; it occurs near the end of it, on his journey home. I have elsewhere18 explained this discrepancy in terms of Homer's acknowledged aversion to folk-tale values: instead of a hero who requires demonic aid to get from this world to the Otherworld, we find a hero preoccupied with escaping from the Otherworld (aptly represented by Egypt) back to this world, an exact reversai of the originai schema. But there are other points that need to be made about Proteus' function at this particular juncture of the Odyssey. It has been observed19 that when Proteus' daughter Eidothea directs the hero to her father, she «says ... that [he] will teli Menelaus the οδον και μέτρα κελεύθου / νόστον θ', i.e. implying geographical instructions. What he actually tells him is how he has offended the gods, the fates of his companions, and his own future». For a comparable discrepancy between the informa tion envisaged by a female who sends on the hero to an older, seer like maie figure and what that seer actually relates, we might cite the notorious case of Circe's despatching Odysseus to Tiresias in the Underworld20. With Homer's Proteus, therefore, we find the poet re working21 the original significance of the helper motif for his own ends. At this stage of the epic, he wishes to set before his audience the fates of many of Odysseus' former companions at Troy, something he does in a rather différent way, though one that again involves read justing a motifs original meaning, in the katabasis of Book Eleven. This transformation of the helper's function is not unique to the 17 Duhn,Menelai. 18 Cfr. my remarks in «Zeitschr. Pap. Epigr.» forthcoming. 19 Forbes Irvine, Metamorphosis, 179, n. 37. 20 Cfr. my observations in Davies, Aristaeus, 58, n. 11. 21 Though as regards Proteus' prophecy of Menelaus' translation to the Elysian fields (Od. 4.561 ff.), we should note that prophecies are an idiomatic fea ture of the helper figure's function: see Propp, Morphology, 120 and 129, and my remarks in «Zeitschr. Pap. Epigr.» forthcoming.</page><page sequence="5">TRITON AND THE ARGONAUTS IN PINDAR AND APOLLONIUS 57 poet. He is merely the oldest and most veneratile practitioner of a device others also found fruitful. Much further along the line we find Vergil and Horace, in Eclogue 6 and Ode 1.15 respectively, taking up this self-same figure of the helper, as personified by Silenus or Nereus, and giving him an entirely new function22. Instead of geographical directions, we hear tales of unhappy love or dire prédictions of future doom for Paris. And somewhere in time between Homer and Vergil, we find, or so I believe, Pindar practising something comparable with the fig ure of Triton in Pythian 4. If what I have said in the preceding para graphe has any validity, we should expect Triton's role to have been originally one of giving directions to the Argonauts, and that this should be largely what he does in Book 4 of Apollonius' epic, to which I shall shortly turn, is handy confirmation of my guess. What I am suggesting is that we have to hand one more instance of a poet «reworking the originai significance of the helper motif for his own ends», the ends in this case relating to the Cyrenean patron of Pindar's Fourth Pythian Ode23. For his sake, Triton's role is changed to that of bestower of the all-important clod of earth upon Euphemus - a détail which may, perhaps, be viewable as vestige of the magical agent24 which the originai folk-tale helper idiomatical ly bestows upon the hero to facilitate his journey towards the goal of his quest. By bringing forward Triton's intervention to a place so near the start of his poem, Pindar ingeniously gives the impression that the episode is occurring near the start of the heroic quest, which is where it would normally belong25. II It is time to move on to the Hellenistic poet's exploitation of the helper figure. But before we come to Apollonius' Triton, we must, for reasons which will shortly become plain, consider a previous episode: that of Jason's encounter with the locai nymphs or Heroines (vv. 1305 ff.). Vian26 has described this passage as a dou 22 Cfr. Day [ES, Aristotle, 685. 23 For the influence exercised upon Pindar's ode by this Cyrenean background see Braswell, Commentary, 6. 24 This concept too originates with Propp, Morphology (see 39 ff. of the English translation); cfr. Davies, Folk-tale, 6 ff. 25 Cfr. my remarks on Jacob in this same volume of «St. Class. Or.», 13-22. 26 See his Budé édition (1981): Vian, Apollonios, 61 (Introduction).</page><page sequence="6">58 MALCOLM DAVIES blet of the intervention by Triton («les Héroïnes sont, du point de vue de l'action, un doublet de Triton, puisqu'elles tirent d'embarras les Argonautes dans des circonstances similaires») and has drawn attention to the similar traits shared by the two sets of helpers in the two consecutive épisodes. Perhaps rather than talk in terms of dou blets, we should compare the relationship between the two consec utive épisodes implied by Pherecydes, FGrHist 3 F 16A, where nymphs résident by the river Eridanus direct Heracles on to Nereus, Old Man of the Sea; or between Eidothea's meeting with Menelaus and that hero's subséquent encounter with her father Proteus, another Old Man of the Sea, in Od. 4.351 ff.27. This latter example actually transpires to be remarkably similar to what we find in Apollonius' Argonautica. It is not merely that both epic passages présent us with a hero and his companions28 lost in extremis29 somewhere near the north coast of Africa; or that the significant encounter occurs when the leader is for the moment sep arated from his men. The motivation for the helper or helpers' inter vention is identical in each case (divine pity30 for the mortal's 27 I have already stressed the relevance of these two traditions for taies of this sort: see Davies ,Aristaeus, 57 ff. 28 At this relatively late stage of the quest (see above n. 16) the female figure who originally featured as the daughter of the vanquished folk-tale ogre/death demon (cfr. Davies, Achelous, 252) would also be expected to be présent, and Medea is accordingly pictured among the Argonauts. The Odyssey, however, is notoriously reticent as to Helen's whereabouts while Menelaus and his έταίροι are detained in Egypt. 29 Cfr. Hdt. 4.179.2 (Ίήσονι) άπορέοντι τήν έξαγωγήν λόγος εστί φανήνοα Τρίτωνα κτλ. Jung, Phenomenology (for references to first publication, English translation etc. see Davies, Aristaeus, 63, n. 34) has interesting observa tions on the tendency of the folk-tale helper to appear «when the hero is in a hope less and desperate situation from which only profound reflection or a lucky idea ... can extricate him. But since, for internai and extemal reasons, the hero cannot accomplish this himself, the knowledge needed ... cornes in the form of a person ified thought», i.e. the helper, representing «the purposeful reflection and concen tration of moral and physical forces that cornes about spontaneously ... when con scious thought is not yet - or is no longer - possible». This concentration «always looks like magie» since it involves «an unexpected power of endurance which is often superior to the conscious effort of will» (401 ff. = 217 ff.). Though original ly limited to the rôle of helper in folk-tale proper, these observations seem to me to be very suggestive for the function of the Apollonian Heroines (and, indeed, the Odyssey's Eidothea) in the folk-tale-derived épisodes now under investigation. 30 Burkert, Mitleidsbegriff, 142 ff. has some interesting remarks on the con cept as it involves 'Gott und Mensch' in the Odyssey, but does not discuss the Odyssean passage with which we are concerned. It may be more useful to consid</page><page sequence="7">TRITON AND THE ARGONAUTS IN PINDAR AND APOLLONIUS 59 plight) and is conveyed in strikingly analogous language («we would have perished but for this intervention»). So: Od. 4.363 ff. καί νύ κεν ήϊα πάντα κατέφθιτο και μένε' ανδρών, εί μή τις με θεών όλοφύρατο και, μ' έλέησε Πρωτέος ίφθίμου θυγάτηρ άλίοιο γέροντος κτλ. Αρ. Rhod. 4.1305 ff. καί νύ κεν αύτοΰ πάντες άπό ζωης έλίασθεν νώνυμοι καΐ άφαντοι έπιχΟονίοισι δαηναι ηρώων ol άριστοι άνηνύστω έπ' άέθλω· άλλά σφεας έλέηραν άμηχανίη μινύθοντας ήρώσσαι Λιβύης τιμήοροι κτλ. But what strikes me as more important than such verbal links is the folk-tale structure underlying each épisode, the story-pattern whereby the questing hero is sent on by one helper figure to anoth er (Old, Older, Oldest')31. The pattern is relatively simple in Homer (and Pherecydes, for that matter): Eidothea directs Menelaus to a place by the sea-shore where he and his έταίροι will be able to meet and master her prophétie father. Apollonius complicates matters somewhat: his female helper figures deliver themselves of an obscurely oracular pronouncement which Jason reports back to his er the role of pity in folk-tale. DaxelmÛller, Barmherzigkeit, 1253 f. allégés that 'Mitleid als Emotion ist wie jede andere innere Beziehung der handelnden Personen zueinander dem Màrchen fremd ... existiert B[armherzigkeit] im Marchen nur in Form der mitleidigen Tat, die erst ubernatiirliche Hilfe ermôglicht', with reference to the hero's pity for the figure who transpires to be the helper; for the implied principle of do ut des see RòHRICH, Bewàhrungsprobe, 276 («nur wer anderen uneigenniitzig geholfen hat, findet selbst Hilfe»). An example of this from Greek myth would be the pity which motivâtes Heracles to release Prometheus from his suffering in Pherecydes FGrHist 3 F 16A (for Prometheus as helper figure here see my remarks in forthcoming). If (see the previous note) the helper figure represents 'a personified thought', then the helper's motivating pity may represent an externalisation of self-pity: cfr. my remarks in Davies, Rumpelstiltskìn, 9, n. 31 on the way in which Rumpelstiltskin appears as soon as the princess dissolves into tears. Consider, at any rate, the episode of 'Cupid and Psyché' (Apul., Met. 6.10.5 f.) where the heroine, ordered to sort a heap of seeds into its constituent parts, immanitate praecepti consternata silens obstupescit. An ant takes pity on her (miseria) and rushing to her fellow ants likewise appeals mis eremini, which they respond to by helping Psyché. (Ants frequently feature thus in folk-tales as sorters of grains of rice, wheat, etc. in seemingly impossible tasks: cfr. KlÌma, Ameise, 451 f.). 31 See Lixfeld, Alteri, 383 ff. with my observations in Davies, Aristaeus, 58 and n. 11.</page><page sequence="8">60 MALCOLM DAVIES εταίροι. Light is cast upon this by a portent: a horse emerges from the sea and canters off (vv. 1365 ff.), which causes Peleus to inter pret the pronouncement and propose that the Argonauts follow it, hearing their ship upon their shoulders the while. In this way they reach Lake Triton, scene of their encounter with the epony mous marine deity. In spite of the surface complications, this sequence too dérivés from folk-tale. Animal helper figures who guide the hero on his way are fréquent here32 and are often combined with more anthropomorphic helpers: one thinks, for instance, of the interacting aid, provided to Cadmus as he searches for the site of the future Thebes, by the goddess Athena and the all-important cow. Apollonius' two successive scenes of Argonautic encounters with helper figures are therefore perfectly idiomatic in folk-tale terms. And if we now turn to analysing the earlier scene we shall find that this too has most of the features we have come to expect of numinous encounters between a hero and his helper(s). (1) Loca/e33 If we glance back at vv. 1246 ff. (especially 1248 f.) to refresh our minds about this, we shall remember that the entire adventure is located in a barren wilderness, the Libyan desert, in fact. This is the most appropriate setting one could desire for an encounter of hero with helper - it is, indeed, identical to the more general back ground of Aeneas' meeting with that ambivalent helper figure his mother Venus in disguise near the start of his Roman epic34. And numerous are the other instances that could be cited of similar encounters in a barren, lonely and deserted landscape35. Apollonius stresses the point by having Jason address the Heroines as ερημονόμοι (1333: cfr. οίοπόλοι, 1322). (2) Identity and number of helpers The Heroines are, in effect, locai nymphs (compare Pherecydes as quoted above) or deities, though they are disguised (so Jason at 1348 f. later makes plain) as young girls dressed in goatskins36. One 32 See Davies, Folk-tale, 8 f. 33 On this see in general Davies, Landscape. 34 See the article cited in the previous note, where I quote one earlier critic as referring to «Venus' accosting her son in the desert of Libya». 35 See the sanie article. 36 One may compare the similar encounter with a numinous helper figure at Theocr. Id. 7.13 ff., where the poet ironically stresses Lycidas' identity as goatherd (see my remarks in «Riv. Fil. Istr. Class.» forthcoming) and goes on to describe the goatskin he wears.</page><page sequence="9">TRITON AND THE ARGONAUTS IN PINDAR AND APOLLONIUS 61 might find analogous the rastic disguise of the Muses when they accosted the poet Archilochus in a similarly barren and deserted landscape37, so that he at first took them to be country wenches. Hermes likewise disguises himself as a young man when he falls in with Odysseus at 10.275 ff. of the epic in question38. As Jason again later makes clear (v. 1347), the nymphs are three in number, and this confirm the folk-tale origins39 of the story-pat tern, not merely in general terms but because the trebling of the helper figure40 is very much at home in such a context. One thinks, for instance, of the three goddesses who visit Paris on Mt. Ida, the three sisters whom Macbeth encounters after his victory in battle, the three Ladies of Mozart's Magic Flute, and so on41. (3) Time of encounter It occurs at mid-day (v. 1312 ενδιον ήμαρ), in the stultifying heat (1313) of a Libyan noon. Menelaus' encounter with Proteus took place at exactly the same time (Od. 4.450 ενδι,ος: cfr. v. 400) and Vian42 has observed that «l'heure de midi est propice aux apparitions divines». But we can be a little more precise, because the numinous figures thus encountered can frequently be shown to be (or to derive from) 'helper figures' in the folk-tale sense of that term43. So not only Proteus but Lycidas in Theocritus Idyll 7.13 ff. is encountered at this time of day. (4) The dream-vision This topic follows on seamlessly from the foregoing, because nothing would be more naturai in the mid-day heat than a siesta (compare Proteus' behaviour in the Odyssean passage mentioned above). Jason has wrapped his head in his cloak (v. 1314-1316) which is perfectly compatible with such a supposition. Even though he turns his head away from the goddesses, they stili remain visible to him alone (ν. 1316)44. A hero's encounter with his helper(s) is 37 On this biographical tradition concerning Archilochus see Davies, Judgements, 43 f. On the landscape see Davies, Landscape. 38 See Davies, Hermes. 39 On three as the archetypal folk-tale number see Davies, Judgements, 34, 40 For which see Propp, Morphology, 74 f. 41 See my remarks in Landscape. 42 Vian, Apollonios, 61. See further my remarks in «Riv. Fil. Istr. Class.». 43 See the article cited in the last note. 44 The motif of the hero's solitary state may have an additionale point here, since it is often (though not invariably) the case that the hero is alone when he encounters his helper. This is certainly true of Menelaus in Od. 4.367 and</page><page sequence="10">62 MALCOLM DAVIES often presented as such a dream-vision, be it at mid-day or some time of night. Hesiod's meeting with the Muses {Th. 22 ff.) was in antiquity interpreted as a dream45 and Archilochus' similar meeting, mentioned above, is also described in terms suggestive of a vision46. One might further think of Bellerophon's encounter with Athena (Pind. 01. 13.63 ff.)47. Vian is aware of the passage's visionary associations ('une vision plutôt qu'un songe') and devotes a 'Note complémentaire'48 to analysing its resemblances to and différences from Homeric proto types. But if one also bears in mind the folk-tale schema of an encounter between hero and helper(s), one's analysis of the passage's contents can become even more precise. For instance, the Libyan Heroines σχεδόν Αίσονί-δαο / έσταν (ν. 1313 f.) ~ έσταν υπέρ κεφαλής μάλ' έπ[.σχεδόν (ν. 1350) with which Vian compares, rea sonably enough, the Homeric dream vision's στη δ' άρ' ύπερ κεφαλής {II. 2.20 etc.). But a closer parallel for the former Apollonian passage, from the context of a vision-like encounter with a helper figure, would be ό δ' αύτω παρ ποδί σχεδόν φάνη from the meeting between Pelops and Poséidon at Pind. 01.1.72 f. Even more apposite a parallel is Od. 4.370 ή δ' έμεϋ άγχι στασα έπος φάτο φώνησέν τε of Eidothea's encounter with Menelaus as referred to above (there is no particular indication in this passage of the encounter's being a vision). (5) Contents ofhelper(s)'speech (i) opening vocative. The very first word uttered by the heroine is κάμμορε (ν. 1318). This is reminiscent of ω δύστηνε {Od. 10.281), from the first line of Hermes' speech to Odysseus when he encounters him alone near the palace of Circe. I have discussed elsewhere49 one commentator's évaluation of the tone of this Odysseus ibid. 10.275 ff. See further Davies, Paris, 184. For a further aspect of wrapping the head in a cloak see I Kings 19.13 cited below in n. 54. 45 MOLLER, Hesiod, 99 ff. and Davies, Landscape. 46 See Davies, Judgements, 43 and n. 58, on the idiomatic verb δοκέω in this context. But Vian, Apollonios, 64 and 128, η. 1 talks in terms of a studied ambi guity as to whether Jason is dreaming or not, and 1 now think this a more appro priate interprétation of the anecdote about Archilochus and other passages besides (cfr. n. 55 below). Note the absence from the Apollonian lines of any équivalent to εΰδεις; in Pindar's version of a dream featuring a helper figure (see the following note). 47 See Davies, Athena. 48 Vian, Apollonios, 192. 49 Davies, Hermes.</page><page sequence="11">TRITON AND THE ARGONAUTS IN PINDAR AND APOLLONIUS 63 Homeric vocative as exhibiting «compassionate but somewhat con temptuous expostulation», and the same words may be applied to Apollonius' passage. (ii) bracing questions. Cari Jung50 once observed that the Old Man who frequently functions as helper figure in folk-tales «often ... asks questions like who? why? whence? and whither? for the pur pose of inducing self-reflection and mobilising the moral forces». This généralisation can be fruitfully extended to helper figures other than old men: compare Hermes' opening words (see under heading (i) above) to Odyssey at Od. 10.281 f. πη δή αυτ' ... δι' άκριας έρχεαι οίος, / χώρου άϊδρις έών ; It can also be extended to ques tions other than those listed by Jung: compare Eidothea's opening to Menelaus (4.371 f.) νήπιός εις, ... λίην τόσον ήδέ χαλί φρων, / ήε έκών μεθιεις και τέρπεαι άλγεα πάσχων; The aim of «inducing self-reflection and mobilising the moral forces»51 remains the same in that instance and in the first words uttered to Jason by the Libyan Heroines (v. 1318): τίπτ' επί τόσσον άμη χανίη βεβόλησαι; (6) Hero's reaction: kataplexis52 Astonishment is regularly and idiomatically the hero's mode of reacting to the helper(s)' appearance, or words; or, even more often, to the disappearance of the helper figure(s). Note the use of κατα πλαγέντα to describe Archilochus' émotion when the apparent country girls suddenly vanished leaving a lyre at his feet53. Or, from a différent ambience, compare Macbeth's reaction to the abrupt dis appearance of his three weird sisters (and ambivalent helper fig ures): «The earth hath bubbles, as the water has / And these are of them. - Whither are they vanish'd?» (1 .iii.79 f.). As for Jason, even before his helping deities begin to speak, he has turned away his face in a gesture of religious awe (1316 δαίμονας αίδεσθείς)54. Note further that, when he reports back to his έταίροι the numi 50 Jung, Phenomenology, 404 = 220. 51 In the succeeding portion of the Heroines' speech, note the sequence άλλ' άνα (1324) ... άνστησον δ' έτάρους (1325), which has as its conclusion Jason's first physical response (1337) άναΐξας. Compare άνά δ' επαλτ' όρθω ποδί of Bellerophon's reaction to Athena's dream-vision at Pind. 01. 13.72. 52 On this feature in general see my remarks in Davœs, Paris, 183, n. 29. 53 See my remarks in Landscape. 54 On this gesture see e.g. Exodus 3.6 («And Moses hid his face; for he was afraid to look upon God»); and I Kings 19.13 (Elijah's response to the «stili small voice» is to «wrap his face in his mantle») with M. Cogan's Anchor Bible Commentary ad loc. for the implicit death after seeing God.</page><page sequence="12">64 MALCOLM DAVIES nous encounter, their reaction too is one of wonder ( 1364 πάντες έθάμβεον είσαΐοντες). (7) άφαντος εγένετο This useful phrase has been invoked55 to summarise the effect of the sudden disappearance of the helper figure(s) after the numinous encounter with the hero. That effect is vividly conveyed in the lines from Shakespeare's Macbeth quoted in the preceding section. Note too Hermes' sudden vanishing at Od. 10.307 ff. Apollonius' description of how the Libyan Heroines disappear as soon (1330 f.) as their words are finished is thus very idiomatic: ως άρ' έφαν και άφαντοι., tv' έσταθεν, ένθ' άρα ταί γε / φθογγη όμοϋ έγένοντο παρασχεδόν. Note too Jason's own recounting of this vanishing to his comrades at 1361 f.: ούδ' έτι τάσδ' άνά χώρον έσέδρακον, άλλά τις άχλυς / ήέ νέφος μεσσηγύ φαεινομένας έκάλυψεν. This further refinement is interesting, in view of what was said above under rubric (4) about the relevance of Hesiod's vision of the Muses. At Hes. Th. 9 the Muses are pictured κεκαλυμμέναι ήέρι πολλω and E.R. Dodds56 suggested that the reason why «Hesiod does not claim to have seen the Muses, but only to have heard their voices» was that he imag ined them as thus concealed57. Let us now move on to the second Apollonian episode, the Argonauts' encounter with Triton. If we leave aside as a special case the clod of earth given to Euphemus at v. 1531, Triton can be 55 By Cameron, Thalysia, 300. See further Davies, Paris, 183, n. 29. 56 Dodds, Irrational, 131, n. 86. Given the relevance of Shakespeare's Macbeth, it is interesting that commentators have sought to explain l.iii.38 of that play («So foul and fair a day I have not seen») by citing from James I's Demonologie the opinion that the Devil can «thicken and obscure so the aire that is about [witches] by contracting it strait together, that the beames of any other man's eyes cannot pearce thorow the same to see them». Cfr. «They made them selves air, into which they vanish'd» (Macbeth l.v.5). 57 Hesiod's Muses claim (Th. 27 ί.)ΐδμεν ψεύδεα πολλά λέγειν έτύμοισιν όμοια / ίδμεν δ' ευτ' έθέλωμεν άληίΐέα γηρύσασθαι, while Apollonius' Heroines state (1319 ff.) ίδμεν έποιχομένους χρύσεον δέρος· 'ίδμεν έκαστα / υμετέρων καμάτων, όσ' επί χθονός όσσα τ' έφ' ύγρήν / πλαζόμενοι κατά πόντον ύπέρβια έργα κάμεσίΐε. West on the Hesiodic passage observes that 'parts of είδέναι are not infrequently found in anaphora' and cites instances from archaic poetry, including the Sirens' song at Od. 12.189 ff.: 'ίδμεν γάρ τ ο ι πάνθ' όσ' ένί Τροίη εύρείη /'Αργέϊοι Τρώές τε &amp;εών ίότητι μόγησαν / ΐδμεν δ' όσσα γένηται έπί χθονί πουλυβοτείρη. The Sirens can be inter preted as the type of ambivalent helpers who act as temptresses to the hero: see Davies, Temptress, 610.</page><page sequence="13">TRITON AND THE ARGONAUTS IN PINDAR AND APOLLONIUS 65 said to help the Argonauts in two successive but interrelated ways: (i) by showing them the outlet of the lake; and (ii) by personally and physically guiding their ship towards the sea. In (i) he features dis guised as a young man; in (ii) he assumes his own genuine shape, part human, part fish. Starting with the first of these two stages, we can observe from the start those idiomatic aspects of encounters with a helper which we are already familiarised with thanks to their featuring in Jason's vision of the Libyan Heroines. Thus, on his first, sudden58 mani festation, Triton assumes the appearance of a young man (1551 αίζηω έναλίγκιος), just as Hermes did when he went to meet Odysseus {Od. 10.278 νεηνίη άνδρί έοικώς). The analogy between the two passages is underlined by the fact that exactly the same verb of encountering (άντεβόλησε, at line-end) with the rel evant helper figure as subject, is used in each case. One interesting différence between the épisodes of Triton and of the Libyan Heroines is that the latter, in a way perfectly in keeping with the ethos of folk-tale, appeared to Jason, just at the right time, certainly, and when his fortunes were at their lowest ebb59, but without any prompting on his part. Triton's intervention, by con trast, comes in response to the offer of a tripod as a gift to the god (vv. 1547 ff.). But this feature too has every right to be regarded as a vestige of folk-tale values. In folk-tale encounters between hero and helper, the principle of reciprocity, the validity of the dictum do ut des, is paramount, i.e. the helper's beneficent intervention is often motivated by an initial kindness and act of generosity or cour tesy on the hero's side60. Triton's first intervention comes to an abrupt end when he sud denly disappears into the lake (vv. 1589 ff.): άνΟέμενος τρίποδα μέγαν, ε'ίσατο λίμνην / είσεβαίνειν μετά δ' ου τις έσέ ορακεν, οίον άφαντος / αύτω συν τρίποδι σχεδόν έπλετο. 58 For the helper's manifestation as sudden (whether explicitly signalised or not) see Davies, Hermes. 59 See above n. 30. 60 Cfr. Rôhrich, Bewàhrungsprobe, 276: «nur wer anderen uneigenniitzig geholfen hat, findet selbst Hilfe». Triton's markedly positive attitude towards the Argonauts (note especially εύφρονέων at 1586) sets him apart from other Old Men of the Sea, who have to b t fore ed into co-operation. Cfr. Frànkel, Not en, 610: «die Argonauten und Triton uberboten einander mit gegenseitigen Gefalligkeiten·, je hàrter und grausamer die Natur jener Zone war, desto herzlicher gestalteten sich die persônlichen Beziehungen zwischen den Wenigen die sich inmitten der Wiistenei begegneten».</page><page sequence="14">66 MALCOLM DAVIES We have examined above61 the idiomatic motive άφαντος εγενε το which is reproduced here. The construction ε'ίσατο ... είσε βαίνειν at 1589 f. may be intended to recali the notion of a dream vision which often underlies such numinous encounters62. The immediate sequel, however, is unexpected: not kataplexis but joy (v. 1591) is the Argonautic reaction: τοΐσι δ' ίάνθη / θυμός, ô δή μακάρων τις έναίσιμος άντεβόλησε. The equating of Triton with a normal Olympian divinity certainly jars: Old Men of the Sea with their folk-tale credentials and origins are usually a million miles removed from such deities63. Perhaps Apollonius wishes to differentiate this encounter with a helper from the earlier interven tion on the part of the Heroines by dignifying Triton's rôle? Possibly connected with this feature is another unidiomatic divergence, Triton's reapparance from the waves (1602 ff.), this time in his own, divine, shape. No more than with his first mani festation is this occurrence unprompted: in the meantime Jason has prayed to him (1597 ff.): δαΐμον, δ τις λίμνης έπί πείρασι τήσδε φαάνθης, / ε'ί τε σύ γε Τρίτων, άλιον τέρας, ει τέ σε Φόρκυν / ή Νηρήα θύγατρες έπικλείουσ' άλοσύνδαμ / ίλαθί. και νόστο^ο τέλος θυμηδές όπαζε. It is notorious that the figure originally known as the old Man of the Sea later acquired a number of différent proper names (Proteus, Nereus, Phorcys, Triton, etc.) and by wittily parodying64 the religious formula illus trated by Fraenkel on Aesch. Ag. 169, Apollonius produces a humorous allusion to that fact. Triton's second and final disappearance (1618 δϋ δ' αίψα μέ γαν βυθόν) is, this time, accompanied by the appropriate kataplex is motif: ol δ' όμάδησαν / ήρωες, τέρας αίνόν65 èv όφθαλ μοϊσιν ίδόντες. With τέρας here compare the use of exactly the same word in a very similar context at Pind. Ol. 13.73, where Bellerophon, roused from his dream-vision of Athena, contemplâtes the bridle for Pegasus which she has left behind for him: παρκεί 61 See η. 30 above. 62 Cfr. η. 46 above. This implication of a vision is isolateci within the passage, but the same is true of the équivalent verb δοκέω in the anecdote about Archilochus mentioned above, n. 46. 63 See Forbes Irvine, Metamorphosis, 179. 64 Fraenkel, Aesch. Ag., ii, 99, n. 2, observes that «the ritual formula is often used in humorous parody» and compares Athen. 8.334e = Cypria Τ 8. 65 For the precise meaning of αίνος here see Frànkel, Noten, 611, who opts for uncanny ('unheimlich') as the best rendering.</page><page sequence="15">TRITON AND THE ARGONAUTS IN PINDAR AND APOLLONIUS 67 μενον ... τέρας is Pindar's kenning-like phrase for this. The treatments of both Apollonius and Pindar, therefore, confirm Triton's dual and ambivalent rôle: he is beneficent helper, but also connected with the Underworld and Kingdom of the Dead. Το quote (again) von Duhn's aperçu66, he is «one of those demons which, for the benefit of the lonely skipper in unknown seas or at the entrance to the Kingdom of the Unknown (Kingdom of the Otherworld would be a better way of putting it) must provide help so that he may travel onwards». 66 See η. 10 above.
