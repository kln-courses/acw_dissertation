Archaeology was well represented in the programme of the Anthropological Section of the British Association at the Bristol meeting in September last. A report of the proceedings appears in the November number of Man, from which in part the following notes are taken. The Presidential Address, by Dr. H. S. Harrison, on " Evolution in Material Culture," was a contribution to the discussion of the rival theories of diffusion and independent origin of permanent value. While not denying the possibility of independent origin in the case of simple inventions and discoveries, he showed himself a staunch diffusionist. He gave a much-needed precision to the terms " discovery " and " invention," and by an analysis of the psychological factors which underlie the latter, demonstrated the inherent improbability of the sequence of coincidences demanded by the theory of independent origin of any given material product. In regard to the question of America he asked why, if the culture of the American Indian was the result of independent origin, it stopped exactly where it did in many cases, and had not advanced equally with its parallels in the Old World. If the American Indian had discovered cereal</page><page sequence="2">428 SCIENCE PROGRESS culture, pottery-making, and metal-working, why had he not gone on to invent the plough, the rotary quern, the potter's wheel and iron ? Dr. Harrison inclined to look to South- Eastern Asia for the place of origin of most of American culture. The most important item of archaeological interest in the programme was undoubtedly a joint discussion, in which the Geographical, Geological, and Anthropological Sections took part, dealing with the relation of pluvial and glacial periods in prehistoric times. Evidence was brought forward from Europe, East and South Africa, America, Palestine, and China. Evidence pointing to two major pluvial periods, with a dry period intervening, was cited from the Faiyum by Misses Gardiner and Caton-Thompson, from East Africa by Mr. L. S. B. Leakey, and from South Africa by Mr. A. Leslie Armstrong. As the result of her recent excavations in Pales- tine, Miss D. A. E. Garrod has been led tò identify a relatively late pluvial period in that area. Mr. C. E. P. Brooks, referring to Dr. Simpson's theories of intense variations in solar radiation, gave the meteorological grounds for the correlation of pluvial and glacial periods - the first pluvial of the pleistocene being correlated with Günz and Mindel, and the second with Riss and Würm. In China, Prof. F. G. Barbour stated, study of the superficial deposits of late Pliocene and Pleistocene indicated two periods of aggradation separated by a period of erosion. The second aggradation) that of the Middle and Upper, was that of the great loess development ; but loess also occurs in the upper levels of the basal pleistocene earlier series. The loess is formed in semi-arid conditions, and it would seem that periods of low temperature in Europe and America correspond with those of semi-aridity in North China. As far as present palaeontological data go, these drier times correspond to the twin glacial epochs Günz-Mindel and Riss-Würm in Europe. Mr. L. A. Cammiade brought forward evidence from the Eastern Ghats and the Coromandel coast of India based on the formation and erosion of laterite which agreed with the view taken by Prof. Barbour. In this connection we may leave the proceedings of the British Association for the moment to refer to a paper by Mr. L. A. Cammiade and Mr. Miles Burkitt, which appears in Antiquity for September, entitled " Fresh Light on the Stone Ages in South-Eastern India," in which the question of the evidence from the laterite and associated stone-age industries is developed in more detail. On stratigraphical and typo- logical grounds a succession of four different cultures is dis- tinguished: (i) an industry characterised by the presence of hand-axes of various types which can be closely paralleled</page><page sequence="3">ARCHAEOLOGY 429 among various finds in South Africa ; (2) flake industries with more neatly made hand-axes ; (3) industries characterised by the presence of slender blades with blunted backs, a few burins, planing tools and end scrapers ; (4) microlithic industries. From the evidence of the laterite a climatic sequence has been worked out in which a long damp period is marked by the formation of laterite, and shows no human relics. This is fol- lowed by a long dry period, in which the people of the hand- axe cultures settled on the laterite plain. A period of violent rain followed, in which the weathered laterite was swept down and redeposited, the hand-axe culture disappeared, and the country was largely depopulated. A dry period followed, in which the people of the flake industry settled on the beds of detritai laterite and clay. A further wet period followed, less violent than the preceding, in which the alluvium was deposited. Herein occur the flake industries of series 2. A decrease in rainfall was followed by a period of denudation leading up to the conditions of to-day. Industries 3 and 4 are associated with these last periods. This succession of changes can be correlated in general with the climatic changes in Kenya, while the series of industries have exact counterparts in Africa, especially South Africa. The hand-axes, for instance, are the type of tool first recognised at Victoria West. In many ways the industries of series 4 are closely allied with the Wilton culture of South Africa, which is also found in Kenya and Uganda. The distinct rarity in India of industries of Upper Palaeolithic type, which occur in South Africa, are common in North and East Africa, and range as far north-east as Transjordania, suggests to the authors that in Southern India we are on the periphery of Upper Palaeolithic civilisation. On this last point it is possible that further light may come from farther East. In a recent number of the Proceedings of the American Philosophical Association (vol. 69, No. 4), Prof. Roland B. Dixon gives a brief account of what would appear to be a remarkable archaeological discovery in the Philippines, where Prof. Bower, of the Philippine University, has recovered some thousands of archaeological specimens from a prehistoric village and cemetery site, which was first brought to light in 1926 by the damning of a river in the course of engineering operations. It is said that these antiquities range in date from the Iron Age to the Upper Palaeolithic or even the Mousterian. The classification of the stone implements, however, seems to be purely typological, and no information as to stratigraphy is yet available. Returning to the proceedings of the anthropologists at Bristol, Mr. A. L. Armstrong, in discussing the bearing of the geological and archaeological evidence from the Victoria Falls</page><page sequence="4">430 SCIENCE PROGRESS on the problem of the antiquity of man in Africa, suggested that it demonstrated the relation of the stone implements to pluvial and arid periods in Africa, and thought it possible that if the pluvial periods are to be held contemporary with the glacial epochs of Europe, the African series of Lower Palaeolithic implements is probably a whole period earlier than the European parallels. Mr. L. S. B. Leakey reported finds of pottery in situ in the lower part of the Upper Aurignacian deposits of Kenya beneath a series of undisturbed strata. The pottery apparently was made by lining a basket with clay and then burning off the basket. Among the papers on British archaeology, reference may be made to the investigations at Barnwood, near Gloucester, described by Mrs. E. M. Clifford. The lower gravels of the site are rich in a mid-pleistocene fauna. In the gravels and brick- earths Aucheulian, Mousterian and Aurignacian implements have been discovered. No human remains were found in these strata ; but burials of a later date - a beaker burial, La Tène II, and an extensive Roman cemetery of the first and second century a.d. - were examined. In the last-named over a hundred inhumations and thirty cremations were found. The evidence suggests that the people buried here were native British, and the site is thus of considerable evidential value as to the culture of the West when it was reached by the Romans. A distinguished foreign guest of the Association, Dr. Miloje M. Vassits, of Belgrade, gave a description of his excavations at Vinča, a neolithic site on the Danube, in the current year. A full report of the paper also appears in Man for November (No. 141). The excavations were continued on the same area as had been excavated in 1929. At various parts of the site and at various levels remains of buildings which had contained clay stoves have been found. These buildings are rect- angular with roughly horizontal floors. The walls consist of frames on posts supporting wattle-and-daub walls. The floors were horizontal beams laid over with a mud plaster, the surface of which had been fired. Similar floors have been dis- covered at Tcherna-Voda in Bulgaria and in South-West Russia. In a building 7-45 metres below the surface, on a stand, a pithos was discovered, on which, over a chequer pattern and meander motives, rises a rough representation of a human face with modelled nose and mouth and eyes made by incised lines. , Implements and weapons were of stone, bone, and horn. For small knives flints, obsidian, and other rocks were used. Axes, mainly unbored, were of various shapes and of various stones. The shoe-last; celt, comparatively common in the later levels, was rare in the earlier. No sources of these rocks are known</page><page sequence="5">ARCHAEOLOGY 43 1 near Vinča, and they must have been brought from a distance. The obsidian may have come from Biikk, in Hungary. A large number of figurines, both human and animal, were found. They are made of stone, bone, and clay. The human figures are both male and female, the latter in the majority. A hermaph- roditic figure was found, steatopygous, with fully modelled abdomen and breast. The form of head suggests not a divinity but a masked person connected with some cult. Masked faces are common, and some show that the masks carried ox-horns. A prominent type of figurine has a conical cap. Those found in a good state of preservation are provided with male genitals. It is suggested that one type of these capped figurines may represent a warrior or sky-god. It is a type of wide distribution in the iEgean and neighbouring lands. Examples have been discovered as far apart as West Prussia and China. It has been dated to the fifteenth century b.c. in the iEgean, and in Cyprus to the second millennium before Christ. This dating would agree with its position at Vinča. A plume on the head of one characteristic figure definitely suggests the plumes on the head of a figure on a fresco in the palace of Knossos. ' Knowledge of the pottery has been much enriched. In form there is a rich gradation from rough pithoi to fine drinking vessels. Prominent forms are a vessel mounted on a stem and painted red and the anthropomorphic vase. A rhyton, now known as the Hyde vase, is in the form of a fantastic bird. This, and another fragment of a similar kind, is ornamented with ribbons of black material which burns in the flame of an acetylene lamp. The nearest analogy to this material is from Biikk. A special form of pottery resembles Minyan ware, if it is not indeed an offshoot of it - a further argument for the author's dating of Vinča at the beginning of Troy II. A sherd found at a depth of 6*5 metres bears a painted decoration for which parallels are to be sought in Cappadocian, Hittite, and Mycenaean ceramics. Vinča would appear to have had a form of civilised life superior to any between it and the .¿Egean. This was derived from the south-east, the iEgean, Asia Minor, and Cyprus. The author concludes that the relation was one of commerce and not of colonisation. The October number of Man is a special Indian number devoted to certain aspects of the archaeology of India. It is the work of a committee of the Indian Research Committee of the Royal Anthropological Institute, which is investigating the archaeology of the Indian bead. Mr. Horace Beck contributes " Notes on Sundry Asiatic Beads," which is illustrated by two plates, one of which is in colour. Mr. Beck describes a large number of beads from Southern India, Sarawak, and the</page><page sequence="6">432 SCIENCE PROGRESS Federated Malay States, and discusses their origin, affinities, and analogues ; many are of considerable antiquity. Mr. L. A. Cammiade describes a number of sites in the Madras Presidency on which he excavated urn-burials, and discovered some of the beads described by Mr. Beck. The number concludes with a paper by Mr. K. de B. Codrington on " Cairn- and Urn-burials," in which he makes a general survey of the pottery forms of the cairn- and urn-burials found in Southern India and the Deccan, and concludes that the evidence on the whole favours unity of culture in South India. The pottery wares fall generally into two classes - coarse unpolished wares used for the urns and large vessels, and a fine polished ware either black, black-and-red, or all red. The polished black wares are closely paralleled by the brightly polished black ware found on the classical sites of North India, Taxila, and Bhita. The types of burial are analysed, and as regards burial customs, Mr. Codrington comes to the con- clusion that the ceremonies must have been of a dual nature. In some cases the entire body was placed in the urn, in others only the skull and long bones. The urn-burials represent only the final stage of the ceremony, and probably were of a com- munal character. The recently published Journal of the Royal Anthropological Institute (vol. 60, pt. i) contains a number of communications on archaeological subjects. The Rev. Neville Jones writes on the occurrence of implements of rostro-carinate type at Hope Fountain, Rhodesia. Plaster casts of the implements were made and forwarded to Mr. J. Reid Moir, by whom the draw- ings were made for the plates which illustrate the paper. Mr. Jones considers that the occurrence of this form of implement at Hope Fountain suggests the identity of the race that evolved it iii South Africa and Europe. Mr. Ernest Mackay, writing on painted pottery in modern Sind, suggests that in the small village of Balreji, situated near the ancient site of Mohenjo Darò, the pottery industry, which in its type of wheel and in other respects differs from the potting of the rest of India, and also in certain features re- sembles some pottery types of the ancient East, may represent a survival of the ancient culture of the Indus valley, of which the now famous sites are being excavated by the Archaeological Survey. Mr. Daryll C. Forde writes on the use of greenstone (Jadeite Calíais, etc.) in the megalithic culture of Brittany. A communication of considerable controversial interest, by Mr. H. J. E. Peake and Prof. H. J. Fleure, " Megaliths and Beakers," puts forward views which are in opposition to theories at present current. They argue, as regards the megalith, for a megalithic evolution based on ideas that are analogous to those</page><page sequence="7">ARCHEOLOGY 433 behind the Messara civilisation of Crete - an evolution attended by simplification and reduction as well as local specialisation. They hold that the megalithic idea was carried via the Iberian coasts to Brittany, Ireland, and the Baltic. Interior France and parts of Britain may represent another extension zone of south-east Spanish influence. This then is why all ideas may not have come the same way. It is noted, for instance, that South France and the Marne have stones sculptured with a female figure and so has Guernsey, but these do not occur in either Morbihan or Finistère, Brittany. As regards the beaker culture, Sir Arthur Evans and others have thought that the bell-beaker was evolved in the Iberian peninsula, and that it originated from pre-existing pottery and from the tradition of esparto grass vessels. It is here suggested that the beaker was at least standardised in Central Europe, and owes its origin to influences around the fringe of the painted pottery in the south-east. It is further suggested that it reached out to Denmark, Holland, England, and Spain by land, making contacts in each region with the megalithic cultures which had spread mainly by sea-routes. In Man for Novem- ber, No. 142, Prof. Gordon Childe stresses the desirability of working out a pedigree for the bell-beaker culture on the lines suggested by Fleure and Peake, and says that as the result of a .careful examination of large collections in Continental museums, he has had it forced upon him that the bell beakers with their associated culture stand out as a closed group in marked contrast to all the neolithic and early bronze age cultures there represented. Another paper in the Journal of no little interest is by Mr. Blake Whelan. It deals with the flint industry of the Northern Irish (25 ft.) raised beach in its relation to the Asturian industry of Portugal. His conclusions are that the period of deposition of the raised beach included the local post-glacial optimum, and that the Spanish Asturian is referable to a similar period. The contents are the sweepings of an earlier horizon, probably of boreal date, a period of marked elevation in Southern Ireland. The Asturian culture of the coast of Western Europe exhibits a northward trend which may well have brought the race by land to Ireland in late boreal or early Atlantic times. The Irish industry is pre-Neolithic in every feature, but is not related to the early county Antrim culture of Aurignac type, also pre-Neolithic. The Portuguese Asturian stations suggest com- parison with Irish sites. The Irish raised beach artifact re- presents a somewhat crude translation of the Iberian quartzite implement into flint. In the leading implementai types of the peninsula the cultures correspond so closely as to establish close relation if not identity.</page><page sequence="8">434 SCIENCE PROGRESS At a meeting of the Peking Geological Society in July last, Dr. Davidson Black announced the discovery of a second skull from the caves at Chou Kou Tien. A brief account of the cir- cumstances of the discovery and of the skull is given by Prof. G. Elliot Smith in the Scientific American for November. The fragments were discovered in material which had been taken from the cave in the previous October, and was being examined in the laboratory of the Geological Survey. With them were associated a number of teeth, presumably belonging to the same individual.* Dr. Black is of the opinion that it is a young adult male. The greater part of the vault and a portion of the base of the skull have been recovered. It is said to yield valuable information as regards certain parts, especially the sphenoid and nasal bones. The frontal bulges are not so prominent nor the bone so thick as in the first skull. Prof. Elliot Smith points out in his article that both Pithecanthropus and the Piltdown man were discovered in gravels, and that though there can be little doubt that the heterogeneous fossils discovered with them were deposited at the same time, in the case of Peking man there can be no possible question that the bones of animals deposited alongside of them provide absolutely certain data for the estimation of their age. Dr. Davidson Black is of the opinion that Peking man represents an early or Proto-Neanderthal man, but Dr. Hrdlička in a survey of the skeletal remains of early man, recently published by the Smithsonian Institution, is not prepared to differentiate it from the Neanderthal group.</page></plain_text>
