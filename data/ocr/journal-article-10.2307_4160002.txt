<plain_text><page sequence="1">OWL. By William Service. Alfred A. Knopf, New York, 1969: 5 X 8 in., 93 pp., illus. with drawings by Walter Richards. $4.00. This might be called "just one more story of a pet owl"-but it is better than most. At least it was more appealing to this critic, perhaps because the author recognizes anthropomorphism for what it is and is rarely guilty of it, perhaps because of a rather unique style of presentation of his story. Mr. Service speculates on many aspects of Owl's behavior. He performs simple experiments with this bird, described what the bird did, and rarely fell into the trap of attempted interpretation of this behavior. Whether you like owls or not, you will like this appealing little creature. There is one serious omission. At no time does the author bring out the point that in many states it is illegal to have a Screech Owl in captivity. I find myself shuddering over the number that may be taken into homes now, in misguided attempts to raise a pet like Mr. Service's owl, without permit and without sufficient knowledge of how to do it.-SALLY H. SPOFFORD. ANNOUNCEMENT The North American Nest Record Card Program, Laboratory of Ornithology, Cornell UJniversity wishes to remind contributors that 1969 nest records are still welcome. In addition the Program desires to accumulate data on nests from the pre-mid-1940s (pre- pesticide era) for comparison. The Program still lacks Regional Centers in Idaho, New Hampshire, New Jersey, and Wyoming.</page></plain_text>
