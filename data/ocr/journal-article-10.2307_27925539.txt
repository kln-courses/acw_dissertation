<plain_text><page sequence="1">VARIA Two Inscriptions of Ramesses II R. GIVEON Tel Aviv University During road-construction south of Gaza, two architectural fragments with hiero glyphic inscriptions have come to light. Both are of local stone. Fragment Ax Height 53 cm., width 38 cm., thickness 13 cm. (PL 27: A). This inscription has two cartouches; to the left is the prenomen and to the right the nomen of Ramesses II: wsr-mVt- R\ stp -?-/?*; R' -mss-mri-lmn. The writing of the prenomen faces to the right and that of the nomen to the left. The prenomen is written in the most usual form and needs no comment; the partially destroyed letters can easily be reconstructed. The nomen has both R? and Amun in anthropomorphic writing. On dated documents this occurs first in the year eight of this king.2 The orthography of R'-mss with two s-signs (Gardiner's sign-list No. S. 29), instead of one of these s-signs together with sw (Gardiner's sign-list No. M. 23), is known from Ramesses IPs inscriptions, though it is less frequent.3 The sun-discs above the cartouches are unusual: normally the two feathers of Amun's headdress appear together with the discs. The upper edge of the stone, above the discs, is broken, and there is no way of knowing how far the block extended on both sides. If the object is, as we assume, part of a lintel, we would expect here epithets and representations like sphinxes. The lower border of the block is clearly indicated a little below the crossbars of the cartouches; this and the direction of the letters towards the centre would fit a typical Egyptian lintel.

The writing of the name is unusual: instead of the goddess Ma'at sitting, with the feather on her head, the 'ankh on her knees, the sign wsr before her and the sun-disc above both signs, we have here R? as a falcon-headed god, holding the Ma'at-feather on his knees. Re in this shape, holding Ma'at, appears in several inscriptions of Ramesses II.5 A scarab of Amenhotep III also has R5 and Ma'at thus combined.6 The block has broken edges on all four sides. The 'a?A:A-sign is too near wsr to have belonged to another inscription or scene. It seems to precede the prenomen, like the 'a?fcA-sign, which often precedes the Horus-name of kings, for purely magical reasons.7 Inscribed blocks from Egyptian buildings are extremely rare in Palestine, but we are reminded of the fragments of a doorway of Ramesses II from Jaffa.8 The archi tectural remains described here must come from Egyptian buildings of some size and strength. They probably belong to the 19th Dynasty fortifications along the road from Sile in the eastern Delta to Gaza. This chain of strongholds and fortified wells is best known to us from reliefs of Sethi I at Karnak.9 This is paralleled by a passage in Papyrus Anastasi I of the time of Ramesses II.10 The inscription of Sethi I has Raphiah as the northernmost point, whereas Anastasi I mentions Gaza. Both documents describe an important stretch of the military road between Egypt and Canaan, and in this respect Ramesses II continued the work of his father. Scarabs of Ramesses II have been found at Tell el-'Ajjul, 7 km. south of Gaza. In the cemetery near Deir el-Balah, which contained anthropoid coffins, more seals of 4 From the collection of M.
