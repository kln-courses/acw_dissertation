<plain_text><page sequence="1">Untimely Meditations: Nietzsche's Zeitatomistik in Context James I. Porter Es ist Zeit, da? es Zeit wird ?Paul Celan 1. Staging Time ^^urely one of the more bizarre stretches of writing in Nietzsche's VjNachlass are the few pages he composed in 1873 on the subject of Zeitatomistik of temporal atomism.1 The notes, replete with esoteric dia grams, are dense to the point of cryptic, and the ideas they contain are as strange (and incomplete) as any Nietzsche ever conceived. Nonetheless, the material is worth close attention, not least because it gives a foretaste of Nietzsche's use of atomism in his ongoing and future speculations about subjectivity, sensation, and power. If the later speculations tend to be lush and surreal, the view of the world given here is drastically spare and unreal, a minimalist's allegory of problems that were always at the center of Nietzsche's thoughts (for instance, in his earlier notes on ancient atomism or in his pages on Schopenhauer from 1870) and that would continue to occupy him in the years to come. The value of these problems for Nietzsche, I want to emphasize, is not so much philosophical as it is expositional and strategic. Indeed, the outlandishness of the conceits found in the Zeitatomistik pages is the very best evidence we have that taking them as an earnest ap proach to some deep metaphysical problem is bound to fail. On the contrary, through them (and, by analogy, in his earlier and later writings in a similar vein) Nietzsche is exploring at least three things, all of which are closely related. First, he is exploring what might be called an anthropology of time (whence the ineluctable anthropomorphism of his speculations, both now and later). Second, he is exploring the limits and fallacies of philosophical speculation: as always, what his writings do is to stage philosophical quan daries rather than to solve them; thus, he tries out (as it were, for the sake of Journal of Nietzsche Studies, Issue 20, 2000. Copyright ? 2000 The Friedrich Nietzsche Society. 58</page><page sequence="2">Untimely Meditations 59 the argument) positions that the very act of trying them out, in an unstated dialectical maneuver, performatively and theatrically undoes. And, third, he is exploring problems of representation, with an immediate bearing on the status of subjectivity and, less immediately but no less significantly, on the location, both historical and cultural, of subjects in the world. To anticipate the drift of his analysis, we might turn to an adjacent note: "A representing agency cannot 'not represent' itself, cannot represent itself away [Das Vorstellende kann sich nicht 'nicht vorstellen', wegvorstellen]" (575). And this, too, has an obvious bearing on the implications of his analysis for his larger cultural-critical findings, particularly if one tries to eliminate the act and agency of representation from some metaphysical framework that prom ises to open on to some timeless horizon of truth. Summing up these three faces of a single strategy, we might say that Nietzsche's argumentative style is dialectical in the ancient sense of the term: it presents a form of caricature, from within; it is the parody of a private, internal logic made public and extrapolated onto an outward scenario; and it is a virtual allegoria dramatization of the abstract (or of the act of abstraction) writ large.2 As such, Nietzsche's method itself parodies the logic of the kind of argument of which it is an instance, namely, the reductio ad absurdum. Such is the nature of Nietzsche's staight-faced philosophical pantomime, which he discovered at the very start of his career and which he never ceased to develop and refine in the years to come.3 The sketches on the will to power are the direct heir to this kind of argumentation, both in their style and in their substance. But before turning to the notes from 1873, it will be helpful to place them in the context of one of Nietzsche's ongoing if rather neglected concerns, the general problem of time and rhythm. Only once we grasp the general tendency of Nietzsche's thought in this one aspect and some of its sources and precursors in his earlier thinking can we begin to make sense of the notes on temporal atomism. 2. Time and Rhythm in Nietzsche's Thought: General Reflections The concepts and phenomena of rhythm and time are a constant motif in Nietzsche's writing throughout his career. But they also appear as a pair. Their significance to his later thinking, though not well recognized, is indis putable. One need only recall the prominence given to the "wave beat of [musical] rhythm" and its "formative power" in the early and closing sec tions of The Birth of Tragedy (1872), or the identification of this same plas tic power with the species activity of mankind in the later writings ("Man is a creature that fashions form and rhythm"), let alone the finely described dynamics of the will to power?its pulsations, its inner metabolism, its "forms</page><page sequence="3">60 James I. Porter of intermittence," and its varying tempos and rhythms (1885-87).4 At one point, in a synthetic gesture, Nietzsche would go so far as to characterize the Apollinian and Dionysian states in terms of "a difference in tempo," that is, as an alteration in the ordinary perception of "time and space," which is itself already in some rhythmic shape (1888).5 Crucial to the question is Nietzsche's underlying tendency to view time or (more abstractly) tempo rality as fundamentally linked to the "rhythmical" shapes in which it invari ably appears. "Rhythm is to be understood as something utterly fundamen tal, i.e., as the most primary sensation of time, as the very form of time" (KSA 7:9[116]; 1871). The formulation (though not the spirit) is Kantian, and it is natural that Schopenhauer should have something to say about the form of time. We might compare his Parerga und Paralipomena (II, ? 147a), against which we may measure his distance from Nietzsche: "The/orm of time is the very means?and this as if by design?by which we are taught the nugatoriness of all earthly enjoyments." If the analysis of time as a form of experience tends to evacuate the richness of experience by virtue of the abstract nature of the analysis, the rhythmical form of abstract temporality (the form of the form of time, if you like) reintroduces an aesthetic dimen sion to the problem that stands in the way of this same evacuation. Time for Nietzsche never appears in the absence of rhythm, however illusory both kinds of experience may turn out to be. This basic tension guides his inquir ies into time throughout his career. Nietzsche's later thinking on these topics is in turn indebted to his first encounter with rhythm as a philological problem during his studies at Bonn and Leipzig and then as a professor at Basel. The concepts and even the terms of the later reflections are all derived from this early phase, as is the tendency to sur round the question of time with philosophical perspectives, whereby rhythm tends to be viewed as a "symbolics of the drives"?so, already, a notebook entry from the fall of 1869, vaguely influenced by Schopenhauer (KSA 7:[49]). But so, too, is the further tendency to put these perspectives in the service of a wider-ranging critique of cultural perception, for rhythm is nothing if not a per ceptual phenomenon, a "symbolics," if you will, that is variously shaped by history and culture. That, at least, was the lesson of Nietzsche's first philologi cal reflections on the topic. As with his other investigations at the time, philol ogy could give even the most absjtruse of philosophical issues a historical di mension, a sense of their being time-bound rather than timeless. And rhythm, even more so than meter, proved to be an object-lesson in this regard. It was a study in the dimension of time itself. I have discussed in some detail Nietzsche's lectures and notebooks on rhythm and meter from 1870 to 1872 in another place (Porter 2000b, chap.3).6 My suggestion there is that Nietzsche's thinking on rhythm, in particular the evolution of Greek rhythmical theory down to the Peripatetic musicologist</page><page sequence="4">Untimely Meditations 61 Aristoxenus of Tarentum in the early fourth century and in his wake, was closely linked to Nietzsche's own interest in the problem of ancient philo sophical atomism, particularly in the fifth century bce (Leucippus and Democritus), a subject on which he kept copious notebooks and made a cornerstone of his teaching and thinking throughout his university career at Basel. A quick rundown of the connections between these two ancient theo ries, of atomism and rhythm, is worth repeating, because it is their conjunc tion that will lead to the later speculations on Zeitatomistik from 1873. 3. Atoms of Time Nietzsche's studies in classical Greek and Roman theories of rhythm coin cide closely with his interests in Democritus. His philological notebooks dating from. 1867 show how he could trace the dynamics of rhythm in the trajectory of lifeless atoms streaming through empty space, in their rhysmos (their trajectory) and epirhysmi? (their flowing in and out of our senso rium), and, more generally, in the "poetry" of atomism that enlivens but also falsifies Democritus's account of the world. The same notebooks also show how Nietzsche could make suggestive connections between the first known abstract theories of aesthetics in the Sophistic period and the physical theory of the early atomists. Obviously, the two kinds of historical study could overlap and intersect in Nietzsche's mind. And although it would be mis leading to state that he ever sought to discover historical traces of atomism in the ancient theories of rhythm (and he nowhere claims to have done so), it is not far wrong to say that he overheard echoes of atomism in those sources, as is perhaps only natural. The affinities between the two forms of inquiry, with their common roots in the Greek Enlightenment, can be striking.7 If atomism presents an abstract and rational model of the natural world, rhythm as grasped by the rhythmicists (rhythmikoi) is one such model incarnated in sensation itself?only here, the relation is a frankly aesthetic one. But there are more tangible connections as well. Democritus is known to have written not only on acoustics (as several fragments attest), but also on rhythm and harmony, alongside euphony and poetry (bare titles, or just topics, survive).8 These connections were thor oughly explored by Nietzsche (see Porter 2000b, chaps. 1, 2). To these, we may now add the consideration, which surely would have played a part in an atomistic conception of rhythm, that Democritus conceived of time itself in purely phenomenal terms. "Time is an appearance [phantasma]" a mere simulacrum, "resembling day and night," hence unreal (Sextus, Against the Mathematicians 10.81 [DK 68A72]; see Guthrie 1967, 2: 429-30): it is a sensation generated epiphenomenally from configured bits of material real ity, a synthesis with only a psychological reality. The thought would have</page><page sequence="5">62 James I. Porter been congenial to proponents of one of the earliest theories of rhythmic sen sation, especially as Nietzsche reads them. These rhythmicists stood in a tradition of musical theory that sought to explain its objects "not in terms of the physics of sound production or by abstract mathematical considerations [as in the Pythagorean school] but through principles inherent in our experi ence of sound as musical, and depending ultimately on aisth?sis, on what we perceive as melodious, concordant, and the like" (Barker 1978a, 16; see further 1978b; 1984; 1989, 123-25). Following phenomenalist principles in their own way, the rhythmicists, for their part, could conceive the units of rhythm as minimal "atoms" con sisting of indivisible chronoi, or time-lengths (quantitative durations of time)?specifically, "the first durationfs] that can be grasped by percep tion": these are the minima of rhythmical synthesis, or composition, that get thrown into complex interrelations, the perceptual effect of which is rhythm. They are, in effect, atoms of rhythm. Thus, Aristoxenus, in his Elements of Rhythm 2.11, would coin the phrase chronos pr?tos ("primary time-length" or "duration") and define this entity as the foundational element of rhythmi cal patterns. (He also devoted an entire treatise to the problem, entitled "The Primary Duration," only a fragment of which has survived.9) Later on, in the second century ce., the musical theorist and more-or-less orthodox Aristoxenian Aristides Quintilianus would write: "pr?tos... chronos atomos kai elachistos [the primary duration is indivisible and smallest]" (De musica 1.14). This formula, pr?tos elachistos kai atomos [or amer?s], "first, small est, and indivisible," is used in a variety of analytical approaches in antiq uity that exhibit what might be called "conceptual" or "theoretical atom ism" (the analysis of systems of relations?whether made up of sound or bodies or times?into constituent irreducible ["indivisible"] elements).10 The possibility that this kind of thinking ultimately reaches back to Democritus is tantalizing. Democritus is known to have written on rhythm and other aesthetic topics, and it stands to reason (and we have a few hints to this affect as well) that he would have extended his conceptual model of atom ism by analogy to other domains. Nonetheless, the evidence we have, while suggestive, falls short of making these connections for us, and consequently the possibility of a link can only be speculated.11 The connection to atomism in the area of rhythm is in any case loose and conceptual, to be sure. Atoms of matter are the smallest imperceptible constituents of the world; atoms of rhythm are the smallest perceptible ele ments of perceived musical time (although in point of fact rhythmical dura tions are not directly perceived; they are perceptually inferred). At most, a common model about the construction and articulation of perception is per haps all that is shared. Nor is the connection ever anything more than impli cit in Nietzsche's view. We might recall a comment of his from a lecture</page><page sequence="6">Untimely Meditations 63 about Greek lyric and music (1878/79) on the way in which rhythm "colors thoughts, permits a certain selection of words, groups together the atoms of the sentence [gruppirt die Atome des Satzes]" (KGW 2.2:375) and then compare how in his notes on rhythm he claimed that for the Greek ear rhythm is an "undular beat: every word is perceived in an aesthetic way, at the very moment it is spoken and heard, as a group of times [(eine) Gruppe von Zeiten]" (KGW 2.1:338). The meaning of the first phrase emerges only in the light of the latter set of notes: the atoms in question are of time.12 And al though the rhythmicists would not have considered themselves to be atomists of any kind, and presumably would have taken no position on the meta physical nature of time, they did hold that rhythm is the sensuous division of time, the means by which time is divided into recognizable parts (chronoi) and so becomes aesthetically palpable, as an appearance, as an aisth?sis.13 Rhythm here seems to occupy the elusive place of time on the atomistic theory, that of a mere relative duration, while the nature of abstract time, time uninflected by rhythm or rhythmic perception, is left invitingly open. As one of the ancient musical theoreticians says, and as Nietzsche under scores in the first pages of his notes, "time does not divide [lit., "cut"] it self; it must itself be divided, into parts and through the agency of a mate rial body (104; Aristoxenus, Rhyth. 2.6). In Nietzsche's reformulation of this position, "chronoi are the cuts of abstract time" (emphasis added). Simi larly, the atomists: "Since [time] depends for its existence on the bodies whose motion etc. it measures, it certainly cannot exist per se" (Long and Sedley 1987, 1: 37).14 But beyond these glancing comparisons there is the shimmering prospect, for the modern mind at least, of recovering in Democri tus and in the rhythmicists the principles of an archaic sentience, "the Greek aisth?sis," which is not ours (109). Dangling this prospect before his reader, and provoking reflections on the dilemmas of historical recovery and con temporary desires and projective understanding, in a word, on the pitfalls of "untimeliness," are what motivates Nietzsche's studies on rhythm. 4. Zeitatomistik (1873) Above I mentioned some of the possible points of contact between atomists and the ancient rhythmicists, a comparison that Nietzsche does not, how ever, care to make himself. Be that as it may, whatever comparisons be tween atomism and rhythmic theory may have run quietly through Nietzsche's mind during the period from 1869 to 1872, the two concerns resurface to gether in an entirely explicit form in the spring of 1873, when Nietzsche sketches out his theory of Zeitatomistik. Let us turn directly to that docu ment now.</page><page sequence="7">64 James L Porter The opening premise is Kantian: "Matter is given only as sensation." This is how Nietzsche puts things in an entry that immediately precedes the printed pages on Zeitatomistik proper (26[11]; 575), but the thought lies behind the theory of Zeitatomistik as well. In the earlier entry, the indepen dence of matter from representation is directly challenged, albeit in a con ventional way, which is to say in the language of sensualism and subjectiv ity: "I have nothing but sensation and representation" (574); "being is sen sation and representation [Vorstellung]" (574); and finally, "sensation and representation are the reason why we believe in foundations [or 'causes,' Gr?nde], impacts, [and] bodies" (575). Thus, the opening premise, though phrased in a Kantian way, has un-Kantian implications that finally can be drawn out: "The contrast between matter and representation does not exist at all" (575). The circle of subjectivity and representation (this latter under stood broadly as thought or sensation) is closed, but also inescapable: there is no way to stand outside the ground it traces for us. That was Nietzsche's position in his essay on the Presocratics from the same year, in a startling statement that takes away some of the luster, and the apparent dangerous ness, of his early reading of Plato's forerunners: "It is absolutely impossible for a subject to want [viz., and to be able] to see and know something be yond itself: knowledge and being are the most contradictory spheres there are"; for the "subjective concept" is "eternal": we can never accede to a region "beyond the wall of relations" by which we are conditioned, for be yond these lies merely "a mythical primordial ground of things" (PTG 846 [1874]).15 A similar thought is found in notes from drafts of The Birth of Tragedy, for instance, when he declares that "this whole process [that of a postulated metaphysical Being residing behind all Becoming, ? la Schopenhauer] is only our necessary form of appearance and thus utterly lacking in any metaphysical reality: . .. with all our proofs we cannot get past these barriers, and at most we are able to recognize them as such"; that nobody can step "beyond the anthropomorphic circle" we inhabit; and, fi nally, with a crushing insight into the constitutional weakness of the human mind, "But who could endure existence without such mystical possibili ties?"16 And that is pretty much how he leaves things here in this prequel to the pages on Zeitatomistik. As I hope to show, his position remains un changed in those subsequent pages. At any rate, the note closes with a segue to the theory of Zeitatomistik: our belief in causes, impacts, and bodies them selves can be traced back to their sources in "motion and numbers" (575). If the claim has a Pythagorean ring to it (cf. KGW 2.4:340-50), the position it announces is anything but Pythagorean, as we shall see. The handful of pages on Zeitatomistik which follow and which elabo rate Nietzsche's theory of atomistic "time-points" (Zeitpunkte) and punc tual "time-atoms" (Zeitatomen) transform beyond recognition both the</page><page sequence="8">Untimely Meditations 65 premise from above ("matter is given only as sensation") and its conclu sion, starting with the annulment of the initial contrast between matter and representation. Looking ahead, we can say that matter here has only a false consistency: it is not "given" per se, but rather consists of a perpetual down ward raining of points of time and force, or more exactly, that of a single, essential punctuality that is variously distributed, thanks to its representa tion by a subject, over an illusory continuum, the foundation of which is nothing but an imaginary convergence of time and space. Matter, seemingly full, is actually empty; but then so is the imaginary instance that replaces it. Herein lies the enigma at the heart of Nietzsche's conception in these pages. Matter dissolves into what it is not. But how can the same fail to be true of its representation? And if the representation of matter is not only purely imaginary, but also devoid of meaning, what has been gained? Before con fronting this worry, let us first attempt a sketch of Nietzsche's nearly private scenario. Beginning where he left off, with the claim that the problem of repre sentation can be reduced to motion and number, Nietzsche's first move is to show why motion is not in fact the answer to the problem, and he does this by way of a reductio. Suppose that A impinges causally on B. A is defined by its location in space and time (it is a "Raumpunkt" at a certain "Zeitpunkt" for "motion [occurs] in time" 575). And the same holds for B. But if A causes B, a convergence takes place: A meets in space and their temporal identities (seemingly conceived here as "signatures" that so to speak mark and thus exhaustively define the objects in question) merge as well. So the problem is how A can affect and vice versa without ceasing to be A and B, respectively: at the moment of their causal contact and because of it, both change. But if they change, then in what sense is it right to say any longer that A impinges on B? Yet, if they don't ever converge and thus don't forfeit their identities, then A and cannot ever come into reciprocal contact and thus cannot affect one another. They cannot both remain what they are if they meet (a view that recalls Plato's Phaedo)11 and be "wirksam" or have any causal power, if this is true. Nietzsche's assumption seems to be that for something to act is for that thing to lose its identity; it no longer is what it was. What is more, for it to act it must be constantly losing its identity ("If we take a causal entity in time, then that entity is a different one in every smallest temporal moment" [575]). But then in what sense is this something, this "Wirkende" anything at all? Its identity is forever being lost; and its actions are forever being fractioned. Time, far from helping to register the identity of a causal entity (something that is, and that has an effect at any given temporal moment), instead serves to locate the fugitive identity of what a thing does, of a thing that is no more and possibly, in a strict sense, never actually is: "That means:</page><page sequence="9">66 James L Porter time demonstrates the absolute nonpersistence of a [causal] force [Das hei?t: die Zeit beweist das absolute Nichtbeharren einer Kraft]" (576). One threat ening consequence of this logic, beyond the puzzle of identities we have just witnessed, is that motion becomes a "contradiction" (576). And if motion is contradictory, then what does the world look like? Nietzsche's reply is not all that comforting: "Here we can be helped by the assumption that either time or space = 0," namely, that one or the other exists, in the other's ab sence.18 Unwilling to give up yet on the idea of time, Nietzsche instead lets go of space. Since there is no compelling reason why space has to be jetti soned in this way, we can only follow Nietzsche's argument as it develops and hope to make sense of it on its own terms. Let us consider, then, how he lays out the nature of time. Time is to be conceived as "endlessly divisible" (576)?not yet into durations, but first into "moments" or "points" (575) occupying a locus in space and separated by spatial intervals, that is, by gaps of time (Zeitzwischenr?umen, 576). These intervals are in turn infinitely divisible and thus occupied (in theory) by further points and further intervals, and so on endlessly. The regression in infinitum is imagined, moreover, as a con vergence, whereby the intervals shrink to such a degree that "all punctual atoms collapse into a single point" out of which are generated, once again, a widening of intervals, their arraying into "time-lines" through the repeated positing of ever new points, or, rather, of this one point in ever new inter vals, and eventually their proliferation into bodies endowed with extension, not to mention the appearance of a contiguousness (or contemporaneity) of events, and the subsequent translation of these event-like appearances into their appearance as a process of becoming (which can only be the genera tion of appearances that was just witnessed). All of this is grasped by the mind of a subject ("a reproductive being") that holds all earlier temporal moments present in its mind and so construes them, in the form of their imaginary representation (576-77).19 Who that subject is, on this bizarrest of scenarios, is unclear, but since subjects in the plural are envisaged, it is likely to be ourselves.20 What is left unclear is whether these subjects are the points where, or perhaps just when, time or its imaginary representation converges upon itself. Before moving on, we need to address the problematical point of con vergence that is signaled by the phrase "all punctual atoms collapse into a single point." Nietzsche's reasoning and his language are obscure here, but I believe we can make sense of his argument along the lines just suggested. The first step is a reductio based on the infinite divisibility of space, accord ing to which all the "intermediate spaces" between atoms are taken to be infinitely small. On this basis, Nietzsche concludes, "[therefore] all punc</page><page sequence="10">Untimely Meditations 67 tuai atoms converge in one point" (576). He seems to want this one point to be a spatial point (cf. "dem einen Raumpunkt" 576; or "The reality of the world would consist in one remaining [or "persisting," verharrenden] point," 577). If so, then in what sense is it that "space = 0"? Possibly, in the follow ing sense. Just to reduce space to a single point with no spatial extension but with only a temporal character that is free of temporal extension (as Nietzsche appears to do) is effectively to reduce space to naught. It is to translate space into temporal terms, into a duration of time.21 This "one point" that is left when the reduction is complete would thus mark a theoretical point of convergence between the axes of space and time, but without belonging to either dimension: its function would be merely to mark a (literally virtual) starting point in the subsequent construction of the world (the extension of time into times, the generation of appearances, of bodies, and so on). Out of this point are "constructed" everything with which we are familiar: the laws of space (which, nonetheless, do not any longer "legitimate the existence of space"; on the contrary, if anything, the extensions of this point, or rather the dimensions intensively extended "within" it, are made up of time: they are Zeitzwischenr?ume, "intermediate spaces of time"), sequentiality (Aufeinanderfolge), contemporaneousness and contiguity (alles Nebeneinan der), and "the whole world of bodies." Thus, Nietzsche can postulate (with out really having earned the claim) that "the whole world is possible purely as a phenomenon of time (so ist die ganze Welt m?glich rein als Zeit ph?nomen)" For the same reasons, all phenomena familiar to us (e.g., bodies in space) are broken down into a series of time-sequences, of mere punctualities of time that get woven, by an imagining instance, into textured phenomena. Here, number reenters the picture, for in the repetition (the reiterated posit ing) of the single, original point, it is "the number and the kind of sequence" of the posited points that determine, literally "make up" (ausmachen) the resulting bodies. In this way, Nietzsche can truly call the construction of the apparent world its analytical decomposition (Aufl?sung, 576). To make up a body is to postulate further points, further atoms (and these are of time); it is to break down what is being built up. And what about time itself? Isn't time likewise constructed, as a phenomenon (appearance) or, in Democritus's language, a phantasm? Indeed it is. Nietzsche's conception is utterly alien ating to habitual notions of time ("One can no longer speak of time, but only of time-points," 579). Time, reduced to its own endless constituent moments (which themselves seem to have no measurable temporality to them), is not merely turned into an instrument for constructing the apparent world; it is used to defeat the world, in a kind of Zeno's paradox writ large, whereby space is absorbed into ever smaller divisions of time.</page><page sequence="11">68 James I. Porter The final key to this problem is touched on but never fully answered within Nietzsche's sketch: it is the question of where and when the conver gent point that supplies the whole thought-experiment its underlying "real ity" is supposed to obtain. As I mentioned, it seems inevitable that this sin gular point, which plainly lies outside of both space and time (and is merely their common condition of possibility and irreality), has to be an imaginary one, a kind of theoretical vanishing point. Whether this imaginary point has to coincide with the imaginary instance for whom the world appears re mains to be seen. A further ingredient is introduced a few pages into the sketch, although its involvement was implied all along: it is the agency, or rather presence, of force, which Nietzsche posits as integral to each time-atom, and as varying with each as well. Presumably, at the point of total convergence described above, the single point out of which all else is generated contains this differ ence of forces and of time within itself. Force has a peculiarly ambivalent status. It seems, above all, to be synonymous with relation, and in fact, true to the overriding reductivism of Nietzsche's scenario, force consists uniquely in the temporal relation of one point to another, that is, of the initial point to itself in all its temporal variety. Once we "translate all laws of motion into proportions of time," time would have to be conceived as "effectual [wirkend]" according to "laws" and endowed "with a constant force": the result is that "we would then have a punctual force, which would stand in relation to every later temporal moment of its existence, i.e., whose forces would consist in .. . figures [sc., of time; Zeitfiguren] and relations [like wise composed of time]" (577). Force is also, however, an agent of change and of difference, but only insofar as it is itself constituted by change and difference. "Only absolutely changeable forces can have any causal effect, viz., those which at no given moment are the same," which is why force is but a "function of time" (578), thanks to which changes can take place, even if time in turn seems to be a function of its being represented by a subject. Through force, time becomes a dynamic field of relations: time is "translated into space" (578); it becomes phenomenally available. Perhaps force is simply the dynamic aspect of time, time's rhythm. Here, Nietzsche's conception does indeed betray the influence of his earlier stud ies on rhythm and tempo: "Forces, as functions of time, are expressed in relations of time-points that are closer or farther removed [from one an other], that is, quickly or slowly. Force lies in the degree of acceleration" (578). Force is a function of tempo, if not this tempo itself (cf. p. 60 above). Elsewhere, as we have seen, he describes these differential relations of time force, which are beginning to look more and more like durations (and spe cifically like the temporal durations of Greek rhythm), as "proportional," namely, as relat?ve "proportions of time" (577, 578). Force can be under</page><page sequence="12">Untimely Meditations 69 stood as the relative difference in the proportions between temporal dura tions, as it were, the rhythmical (and mathematical) movement between one duration and another and between groups of durations. Finally, the whole complex of temporal points seems geared to "making visible these propor tions of force," which is to say, to generating the appearance of the world to hand and as we know it (die vorhandene Welt), through the translation of the proportions of force into space (578). There is perhaps nothing in this scenario that reminds us of anything we know. But in Nietzsche's mind at least, the world's appearances are courtesy of the rhythms that make it up in our minds, as we take in that world through our senses. At the end of his brief sketch, Nietzsche comes back full circle to the problem of sensation from which he set out: 'Temporal atomism coincides, in the end, with a doctrine of sensation. The dynamic time-point is identical with the point of sensation. For there is no simultaneity in sensation" (579). Atoms of time are the minima of sensation and its minimal requirement as well. Sensation takes place in time. A discontinuous event, sensation does not so much rupture the homogeneity of time as it is the final proof of time's discontinuous essence,22 for time and its sensation seem to be not only coterm inous, but also equivalent. Against Kant, Nietzsche might have written: "Time is given only as sensation." For Kant, time is a transcendental condition of perceptual awareness. For Nietzsche, time is an effect of representation.23 What these pages on temporal atomism trace is in essence the abstract equivalent of what appears to have been premised in the studies on Greek rhythm: durations, which divide time, are both parts of time and the parti tions within a sensible body that generate time, or rather a sense of time, while rhythm is nothing other than this generation of a sensation. Time comes rhythmically shaped. And yet in and of themselves, time and rhythm are nothing but an abstraction, the mere presence of a system of relations within a sensuously apprehended body. Of course, the notes on temporal atomism do not simply attempt to restate the lessons of Greek rhythm. What they do attempt, we might say, is to encompass some of the paradoxes of those les sons in a single, comprehensive image.24 The result in the present case is an unimaginable conundrum. But Nietzsche would claim that similar puzzles and tensions result on the Greek scheme as well. 5. The Question of Force and the Return of the Subject Nietzsche does not go on to develop this particular view of temporal atom ism, which is not lacking in philosophical precedents,25 any further than these few pages take him. Many of its aspects are, however, visibly at play in the later theory of the will to power (whereby agencies of will are con ceived in atomistic terms, namely, as Kraftatomen [atomistic Kraft-Punkte</page><page sequence="13">70 James I. Porter or Kraftcentren], or simply as Atomen)** while both discussions resume the speculations in a more Schopenhauerian vein from 1870/71 Whatever other influences are at work in these pages, Democritean atoms are clearly one inspiration.28 Indeed, Nietzsche's sketch of temporal atomism is in essence physical atomism done up as an abstract painting. Only, what is depicted is the very construction of the atomistic hypothesis, rather than the material reality the hypothesis seeks to capture. (Nietzsche likewise had accused the atomists of importing subjective traits into the objective features of atoms, such as motion and weight, in his early and never-finished Democritea [ 1867-68].) And the same would hold for later variants of atomism, whether as proposed by Boscovich or Fechner, which Nietzsche would claim perpetu ate the atomistic hypothesis in its most abstract and immaterial form (see Beyond Good and Evil 12 on the residual "atomistic need" of Boscovich that runs parallel to the broader and no less disparaged "metaphysical need" of all-too-human subjects). Nietzsche's atoms, in any of their forms, are lit eral mirrors of a subject, and so the sketch on time-atoms represents less a "continuation of atomism" than the radical exhaustion of that hypothesis, much like the so-called "doctrine" of the will to power in its wake.29 Democri tean atoms are expressly rejected at one point as unfit for the purpose at hand: "As a rule, in atomistic physics one assumes the existence, in time, of impassible atoms of force [Atom-Kr?fte], in other words, of onta [beings] in the Parmenidean sense. These, however, can have no effect" (578)?not, presumably, because they are too much a mirror of the object-world (at least in intent), but because the very idea of effect is doubtful, seemingly inca pable of coherent explanation (see below). Interestingly enough, as later in his reflections on the will to power, here too Nietzsche does not expel atoms altogether. Retaining their use-value as powerful signs of a rupturous repre sentation, Nietzsche stays within a pluralist paradigm (and as it were pre sents a kind of inverse argument against Zeno's famous paradoxes of time and motion).30 He merely dresses atoms up in a different guise, the guise they originally had (pace the atomists), namely, as changeful, nonself-iden tical (at least from moment to moment), enlivened by time, and therefore too by a representing subject. Unlike physical atoms, time-atoms work, are ef fective (wirken), in the form of a phenomenology of their appearances, "as a Zeitph?nomen" a phenomenon consisting of time (576). Bodies on the Democritean scheme are voided by the discontinuity of matter. On Nietzsche's alternative scheme, they are voided by time ("in such a way that we dissolve bodies into interrupted time-lines," 576). But in the end and on both schemes, what finally voids body is its representation. Surely the most eloquent argu ment for this last point is the extravagance of Nietzsche's own conceit itself, the sheer effort that goes into its representation by him, and its purely (and emphatically) hypothetical character. (To return to his earlier aper?u, "A</page><page sequence="14">Untimely Meditations 71 representing agency cannot... represent itself away.") The result in each case leads only to "an impossible representation!"31 So much for bodies, but what moves a body? The answer is force, which (for Nietzsche) is to say, once again, a subject, for it is the subject that "moves" atoms, animating them by representing them. Hence the equivocal role of force on Nietzsche's account: on one level, force is a causal agency; on another, it is the sign of the subject's inescapable presence and the ani mating agency of its own. (This goes some way toward explaining the odd and strictly illegitimate designation of Democritean atoms as "atom-forces," Atom-Kr?fte, which introduces the subjective component directly into the substance of the atom. Elsewhere, Nietzsche is careful to distinguish mate rial atoms ? la Democritus from the concept of force.32) But force is simulta neously, and for the same reason, troubled?-for what is it that moves a subject! The tensions in Nietzsche's account of force, illustrative of this larger and insoluble tension, can be laid out quickly. Whatever else it may be, force for Nietzsche is in any case not a mover of bodies. At the very least, it is an agent in their construction, and then, finally, it is the inverted reality of time itself. This needs to be explained. On the one hand, "time testifies to the absolute impermanence of a force" (576): it is the point at which force attains a duration of zero?literally fails and expires?in order to have an effect.33 On the other hand, this point of con vergence, of a force that lapses in an infinitesimal gap of time, just is (or rather, "would then have to be," for we are never allowed to forget the ex hypothesi force of the account) the "one enduring [or "persisting"] point" that is real, in contrast to the plurality of its subjective representations (577). The irony at the heart of Nietzsche's conception is that reality is a nonactuality, a point of failure, a mere gap, while the plurality of appear ances rush in to fill this gap. Consequently, reality has no duration, no con sistency in and of itself, and no uniformity. Its only temporality is that of a fading off into irreality. This gives Nietzsche's remark, which echoes his studies in rhythm, its full force: "We have absolutely no means at all for setting up a law of time" (577); time is too various and too discontinuous to obey laws.34 If this remark appears to validate the inference that is made to "a punctual force," what it actually leads to is the puncturing of force by its irreality. Time falls in its wake, as do time-atoms, which were never really atoms to begin with, but were rather (paradoxically enough) their own op posite, mere voids of time, time's real irreality, a mere leap of thought?a fantasy. "Actio in distans temporis punctum" (577).35 In this way, the hypothesis of atoms of force and of time points finally to itself and to its founding fiction, its proton pseudos. After all, the story of the sense of time and its generation is not just the story of how the world is only as real as our representations make it. It is also a parable of self</page><page sequence="15">72 James 1. Porter delusion. Plurality, appearances, bodies, in short, the world, all arise on Nietzsche's scenario in virtue of the fact that "representing beings," at ev ery imaginable instant, repeatedly hold in their minds (welche... wiederholt d?chten) the one enduring point that is the reality of the world (even if that point seems to exist nowhere else than in their minds). The discontinuity of time alone seems to be a direct function of this interrupted contemplation: time cannot exist homogeneously because it cannot be thought continuously. But why, we might well ask, must the subjects in question think the point re peatedly! What is the compulsion behind the thought, and why must the ef fort to "think" time flag only to be renewed? Nietzsche nowhere says, but the implication is that the failure is due to the intrinsic limits of the representa tional mind itself. Time seems to come into being at a point of failure, the point at which the force of thought expires, repetitively and compulsively. But what is worse* if the world is the result of its failed representation, it is also the result of an error, and here Nietzsche couldn't have been more expli cit: for the thinking and representing subjects in question are "beings that take [annehmen, 'suppose'] the point at different time-points to be non selfidentic?l and then [jetzt] receive these points in a simultaneity" that is, at and as a self-identical temporal moment, in their synthesis (as a Zeitph?no men, or as a body, etc., 577). Or, need we add, as that compressed point at which time and space seem, fleetingly, for a moment, to intersect in reality, as the sole ground of reality? What subjects behold is simply the fruit of their misprision. Only, when do they do this? And (incidentally) where do they come from to begin with? Nietzsche's thought circles around itself end lessly. As with the notes on rhythm, so too here: time is an effect of an illusion, its history is an error. But then, so too is the history of that history. Appendix: Zeitatomistik and Nietzsche's Theory of Rhythm The resort to diagrams in the later philosophical speculations on time-at oms, and thus the attempt to visualize the phenomenon of time, its shape and rhythm, is reminiscent of the philological lecture notes from just a few years earlier. At one point in those lectures Nietzsche writes, Different things are included under rhythmical beat [or "pulse," Takt] 1) the "perpendicular rhythm" 2) a new perpendicular rhythm. Takt consists in two or more perpendicular rhythms that can be perceived together.</page><page sequence="16">Untimely Meditations 73 In the visual perception of a perpendicular there is a resting-point for the perpendicular, where it spins its motion around [viz., generates its mo tion]. In aural perception there is the need of a gap, of a very small pause. The sound dies at this point. The whole process is a wave of sound coming to rest. The quickest motion of a pendulum [comes] in the first half of its fall, the strongest sound [comes] at the start of the sound wave [Tonwelle]. It is a force [Kraft] that is used up. Be it a breath or a beating, the sound [Klang] will always be strongest at its beginning. The ictus (the thesis of a beat) is the convergence [Zusammenfallen] of all new perpendicular motions, of all the fastest motions in the resounding [im Klange] of all the strongest sounds [T?ne]. (KGW 2.3:162-63) Rhythm is here conceived as a formal synthesis of a perpendicular (namely, linear) array of quantities of time, quantities that are indivisible (as on the Zeitatomistik scheme) and convergent upon a single point. Thus in the later notes we read, "all punctual atoms converge [fallen zusammen] in a single point," the point that contains the structure of the whole phenom enal, spatialized world within itself. This singular point is peculiar in that it both mobilizes the world (everything is "payed out," so to speak, "from [this] one point" [alle aus einem Punkte bestritten], along [likewise] inter rupted perpendicular lines (in unterbrochene Zeitlininen aufgel?st, 576); and it is the point at which the motions of the world come to a rest, spinning on their immobile axis. The ictus is the rhythmical equivalent of this para dox of rest and motion: it lies, in fact, at the very point at which motion and silence (the pause or rest) converge.36 On Nietzsche's adaptation of Aristoxenian rhythmical theory, the pause alone is sensible: "The time of the static pause is knowable by sensation; the time of movement, of the transition, is unknowable by sensation" (KGW 2.3:104). A pause will consist in the foot coming to rest on a thesis (positio) or in the chorus-master's finger being held stationary at the extremes of its pendular motion. So the thesis is here defined as a resting of the baton or foot, at the end of its downward arc, not in virtue of its audible qualities: rhythm is purely a function of time (this is the essence of Nietzsche's innova</page><page sequence="17">74 James I. Porter tion in his theory of Greek rhythm and his argument against an audible, stressed rhythmical ictus).37 The thesis of rhythm, as opposed to the upward lifting arsis, implies downward motion, but more significantly, in structural terms, it implies motion reaching its limit: in itself it is still (motionless) and quiet (soundless); and the elements of rhythm converge around such silent, immobile points, whose interrelation (whence the idea of minimal pairs: 'Takt consists in two or more perpendicular rhythms that can be perceived together") constitutes a rhythmic sequence that is felt but not quite heard.38 The measure between these pauses creates the intervals, or temporal lengths, of a rhythmical pattern. Aristides, in his De Musica (1.14), calls these mini mal lengths of distended time, "points," "just as geometers have used the term 'point' for what in their science has no parts." These are the atoms of rhythm mentioned above, whose significance is purely structural and rela tional.39 Nietzsche's theory is based on the analysis of these atoms of time grouped in relationships around "single points" that have no perceptual basis (they are silent and motionless) except in relation to one another, in their mutual contrasts. Their proportioned relations constitute "rhythm." The "single point" of convergence in the Zeitatomistik sketch is another such virtual, systemic moment, one that virtually contains within itself the arrays of space and time that consitute phenomenal perception (see fig. 1): Fig. 1 And, not by accident, the "paying out" (as one does with a line) of relations results, on the Zeitatomistik theory, in a relation (what he there dubs a "force" and later calls a retroactive product, a mere "function of time"): "[T]he sequence will be in some proportion or other and the world before us [die vorhandene Welt] will consist in the becoming visible of these proportions of force, i.e., [a] translation into the spatial dimension" (578). From this, it follows effortlessly that "time is not a continuum; there are only totally different points of time, no line" (579). The diagram that is used to illustrate this point (fig. 2) can be read in this light: it graphically represents the interruption of a linear continuum; the points of interruption are points of time; but to speak of these one has to speak of their mutual relations?namely, their rhythmical shape.</page><page sequence="18">Untimely Meditations 75 Fig. 2 The arcing semi-circles in the diagram, descending along a perpendicular line, must be the graphic equivalents of these relationships, the proportionalities of time-quantities40 that together produce the effect of time upon our sensorium: we perceive a rhythmic shape and we call that shape time. What is not represented in the earlier diagrams, but is implicit in them, is the fact that within the singular point of the thesis of rhythm resides the source of perceptual awareness that is itself lacking in perceptible qualities: it is a phantasmal point of subjectivity, the true source of all action at a distance. The lesson of the notes on Greek rhythm carry over to the later notes on temporal atomism here too. University of Michigan jport@umich. edu Notes 1.

The term "the forms of intermittence (Intermittenzformen) of the will," glossed by "rhythm," is from KSA 7:3[ 19] (1869/70) and from DW 574; likewise in connection with pain and pleasure (see Porter 1992); the term may derive from D?hring 1865, whose critique of Schopenhauer's view of music (see Die Welt und Wille als Vorstellung ["W] 2.2: 535, with the concept of Zeitpunkte already here) may also have had an impact on Nietzsche. The connections between the motions of becoming and rhythm are traditional and nearly automatic; see Lange 1866, 285: 'The genuine mate rialist will always be inclined to direct his gaze at the vast world of external nature and to regard man as a wave in the ocean of the eternal motion of matter"; cf. Heraclitus's vision of becoming, "ebbing and flowing in the brazen beat of rhythm," which leads to an insight into the abstract form of time itself (PTG 823); and also Democritus, who availed himself of similar imagery (waves beating upon the beach, analogized to the sorting actions of the cosmic vortex); cf. DK 68A135. 5. KSA 13:14[46]: "There must be a difference in tempo in [and between] both condi tions." He goes on to describe the Apollinian condition in terms of a "slowing down of the sensation of time and space," but never finishes the contrast; presumably the Dionysian is an acceleration of these sensations. If the thought recalls a Gedankenexperiment that was made in the lecture on Heraclitus in "The Pre-PIatonic Philosophers" (KGW 2.4: 268-69), this is no accident. There (267-69), Nietzsche was working with the hypotheses of K. E. von Baer (1860), who was concerned to locate the subjective basis of perception in physiology by isolating the minima of temporal sensation ("the time it takes to register in our consciousness an impression on our sense organ"), but also the proportionality of the pulse-rate to the rate of conscious sensations. These are precisely Nietzsche's concerns in his lectures on rhythm, in the notes on temporal atomism, and, evidently, in the later notebooks as well. On Nietzsche and Baer (but with no reference to the lectures on rhythm or to the continuity of these interests in Nietzsche), see Schlechta and Anders 1962 (64-66, 152). 6.

Pearson). Translations of this text below are from Barker 1989 and Pearson 1990, with occasional modifications.</page><page sequence="20">Untimely Meditations 77 14. The statement just quoted occurs in a summary of Epicurus's view, which is better attested than Democritus's and doubtless derivative of it. Cf. Asmis: "[T]ime is nothing but the relative duration of properties," namely, perceptual properties (1982,33). It seems, more over, that Epicurus accepted the concept of time-atoms. Cf. Lucretius, De rerum natura 4.794-96 (quia tempore in uno,/ cum sentimus, id est, cum vox emittitur una,/ tempora multa latent, ratio quae comperit esse) and puncto tempore in 6.231. None of our evidence establishes that Democritus connected atoms to time. For all we know, he did. 15. Cf. WP 565: t4[Q]ualities are insurmountable barriers for us; we cannot help feel ing" that qualities are irreducible to quantative differences because "qualities are an idiosyn crasy particular to man." This is Nietzsche's earlier argument too; cf. KGW 2.4: 333, where the secondary qualities of atoms are an aspect that cannot be "thought away." These ex amples could be multiplied. See further Porter 2000b, Introduction, on this text and chapter 5 on the tendency of scholars to read a will to power and not, say, to delusion, into the efforts of Nietzsche's Presocratic philosophers. 16. KGW 3.5.2:1060-61 = KSA 14, p. 541 (1871), dilating on ? ?5, ad fin. 17. Phaedo 102d-e (said of opposites). Lucretius (De rerum natura 1.760-62) would deny this about atoms, but assert it to be true of compounds. Cf. further Plato, Parmenides 156c-d: "But when, being in motion, [the one, which is postulated as being 'both one and many and neither one nor many and is in time'] comes to a stand, or, being at rest, it changes to being in motion, it cannot itself occupy any time at all for this reason. . . . That cannot happen to-it without its changing. But there is no time during which a thing can be at once neither in motion nor at rest-When does it make the transition, then? ... Consequently, the time at which it will be when it makes the transition must be that queer thing, the instant. [In the instant, the One] occupies no time in making [the transition] and at that moment it cannot be either in motion or at rest" (trans. Cornford). 18. Whence the deduction Nietzsche feels he has earned: "All laws of space [in their ordinary understanding] are thus conceived as timeless" which is to say, as unconstrained by time; if time were reintroduced as a real factor, a contradiction would result, the one he believes he has shown (576). 19. There are Kantian overtones here. Compare the following: "To know anything in space (for instance, a line), I must draw it, and thus synthetically bring into being a determi nate combination of the given manifold, so that the unity of this act is at the same time the unity of consciousness (as in the concept of the line); and it is through this unity of con sciousness that an object (a determinate space) is first known. The synthetic unity of con sciousness is, therefore, an objective condition of all knowledge. It is not merely a condition that I myself require in knowing an object, but is a condition under which every intuition must stand in order to become an object for me. For otherwise, in the absence of this synthe sis, the manifold would not be united in one consciousness" (Critique of Pure Reason 137 38; first emphasis added). Nietzsche's subsequent critique (see below) of the view of time as a line (cf. ibid., B50), should make us wary of reading the above as an endorsement of a Kantian position. 20. As Nietzsche himself suggests when he puts the positing agency in either the first or third person: "Since time is infinitely divisible, the whole world is possible purely as a phe nomenon of time, because I can occupy (besetzen) every time-point with the single space point ..."; "there is place for an unending series of time-points between every intermediary space of time: thus, one could imagine an entire world of bodies ...," which is exactly what transpires: "we need a reproductive being" to posit and to synthesize the points of time; "and therewith are our bodies imagined" (576-77). (On the mythological nature of this kind of Wesen, see KGW 3.5.2:1060-61 quoted earlier at n. 16.) Thus, whatever echoes of Leibniz one may overhear on this model are turned inside out.</page><page sequence="21">78 James L Porter 21. Cf. p. 579: "It is possible: 1) to reduce (zur?ckzuf?hren) the existing world to a punctual spatial atomism; 2) to reduce this further to temporal atomism." Later on, space will be reintroduced via a translation of prior elements into the language of space ("that is, translation into spatiality [d. h. ?bersetzung ins R?umliche]" 578). 22. "Time is by no means a continuum; there are only totally different points of time, no line" (579). 23. Nor are matter and representation opposed (575). The echoes from Kant in these notes are rife and deserve closer examination. 24. One further indication that this is so is Nietzsche's attempt, in his notes on rhythm (KGW 2.3, pp. 162-63), to depict in a graphic image Greek rhythmical beat as consisting in "perpendicular rhythms" that "converge" in the thesis (marked by the ictus of a chorus master), as though at the base of a pendular swinging motion, wherein motion ceases and is renewed: the ictus thus marks the convergence, or rather meeting-point, of stasis and mo tion, of silence and sound. Strangely similar descending graphs representing his conceit of time-atoms are given on pages 576 and 579 of his notebooks (see appendix, below). 25. See Sorabji 1983, chaps. 21-25, for one account. 26.

Schlechta and Anders 1962,153, rightly note the combined influence of Boscovich, Spir, and Z?llner on Nietzsche's theorizing here. But they overlook Nietzsche's earlier specu lations from 1870/71, which already fold atomism, the studies on rhythm, and his borrow ings from Z?llner (not to mention von Hartmann) into a critique of Schopenhauer (see KSA 7:7[168], qtd. below in n. 35). Had Schlechta and Anders added von Baer to their list (see their discussion on pp. 64-65), they might have recognized more readily the connection with Greek rhythm: von Baer's hypothesis is that the speed of sensation in animals is directly proportional to the speed of their pulse rates (see n. 5, above). Cf. KSA 7: 21 [16] 1872/3 (notes to "Philosophy in the Tragic Age of the Greeks"): 'The essence of matter. Absolute logic. Time, space and causality as preconditions of effectuality [Wirkungsvoraussetzung]. Forces [Kr?fte] are left over: in every smallest moment [there are] other forces: in the infi nitely smallest space of time there always is a new force." An excess and exceeding of force is inevitable. "That means," Nietzsche concludes, "forces are not in the slightest bit rear (KSA 7: 21 [16], p. 527). 29. Pace Schlechta and Anders 1962, 148, who cite KSA 7: 26[1], p. 572 (1873), ? contemporary note on Pythagoreanism: "Continuation of atomism, [whereby the] mechan ics of motion is ultimately a description of representations." 30. See the admirably lucid presentation of Zeno of Elea, the pupil of Parmenides, in PTG ?12, where the infinite divisibles of time, corresponding to the divisibles of space, are each called an "atom" (Atomon), namely, an "indivisible" (KSA 1:849). 31. Nietzsche's words for Zeno's objections to the pluraliste, whose logic leads to his paradoxes (576). In one way, however, Nietzsche's view coincides with Zeno's: for Zeno is made to deny the reality of time, motion, and the plurality of temporal moments?for en tirely different reasons, however. 32. E.g., AW 4:83, where Democritus is explicitly said to have denied the identity of atoms with teleological factors such as "intelligence" and "force" ("noein and Atomkr?fte"): "he recognizes only a mechanistic causality." But at KGW 2.4: 334 Democritean atoms are again called "Atomkr?fte." 33. It fails in one other important respect: namely, whenever we try to hypostasize whatever it is that force is or does. Force, strictly speaking, does not exist; but (Nietzsche seems to insist) mere is force. Is force even a coherent notion? Nietzsche seems to give two accounts of force in these notes: (1) as absolutely impermanent; and (2) as relative (an</page><page sequence="22">Untimely Meditations 79 acceleration). "Absolutely impermanent" must mean absolutely nonexistent, since anything that exists has a degree of permanence; force has none, and it is like time in this respect: timeless, impermanent, dimensionless, hence unreal. No doubt, anyone seeking a theory of force or power (or its precursor) here will want to claim the opposite, namely, that force has to be conceived as instantaneous, and then to claim it as absolutely existing. But there are no instants, and not even one of them, outside of a phenomenal framework. To show that this is so is the burden of Nietzsche's entire theory of temporal atomism. At any rate, Nietzsche ensures that we can only fail to make sense of force: squaring ( 1 ) with (2), namely, force ( 1 ) as an absolute and (2) as a relative entity, is logically impossible?unless we posit force as a relation that depends absolutely upon a plurality of phenomenal relationships; on this view, force has a virtual (unreal) existence only; its punctuality (577) is a mere extrapolation, correlative to its moment of positing and to the temporal moment onto which it is calqued ("in jedem kleinsten Moment" seil., "jenes einen oft gesetzten Punktes" 577); and it exists only in relation to a representing (positing) instance that surveys (and misreads) these rela tions, construing them as time in its dynamic aspect. Nietzsche says as much himself, and is crystal clear about the dependencies: "All forces are only a function of time" (578); and "the dynamic time-point is identical with the point of sensation" (579). In all of this, far from showing himself to be in line with Boscovich, Nietzsche is dia metrically at odds with him. Force for Boscovich is ineliminably real. Not so for Nietzsche. And the comparison stumbles in two other significant respects. Boscovich's theory is based on irreducible and multiple point masses (forces) whose temporal and spatial properties supply them with their "modalities" of existence (Boscovich 1966, 197). Nietzsche's build ing blocks are time-atoms simpliciter; but these are further reducible to a single point. There is no corresponding further reduction in the system of Boscovich, nor is the compresence of forces, which he vaguely allows as a theoretical possibility (but discourages, since "matter is interspersed in a vacuum," 21), a concept that adequately explains Nietzsche's final (i.e., original) and intensely radical reduction. These are the fundamental areas of disagreement, but there are further disharmonies. Consider the following: "A continuous line, or a continu ous time is understood to be generated, not by repetition of points or instants, but by a continuous progressive motion, in which some intervals are parts of other intervals; the points themselves, or the instants, which are continually progressing, are not parts of the intervals" (198). Nothing could be further from Nietzsche's view of the generation of sequence (and of plurality) by way of a repetition of points (or rather, of a single point). Indeed, Boscovich's statement reads like an objection to Nietzsche. But the reason for this difference has already been given above: Boscovich, who does not start with a theory of time-atoms, is talking about a generation of temporal sequence in reality; Nietzsche, who does, is speaking about the projection of a perception: the repetition takes place in somebody's mind, as does the resulting apparent continuity. And so, metaphysically (not to say rhetorically), the two theo ries really have nothing in common at all. 34. One thrust of the lectures is to deny the law-abiding nature of the Greek sense of time, whence the multifarious and highly subtle aesthetic quality of Greek rhythm. Cf. KGW 2.1:126, and the comment at page 268: "In contrast with individual rhythmical schemata, on my theory there are no sure decisions, but many possibilities" (a comment which is partly also about the irrecuperability of Greek rhythm today). See further, Porter 2000b, chap. 3. 35. Cf. KSA 7:7[168], p. 204, where similar dilemmas are put in a Schopenhauerian idiom. "Primordial process: the one world-will is simultaneously self-perception: and it per ceives itself as the world, as appearance. Timeless: [there is] perception of the world in every smallest point of time [Zeitpunkt]: were time real, there would be no succession. Were space real, [there would be] no succession. Irreality of space and time. No Becoming. Or: Becom ing is appearance. But how is the appearance of Becoming possible? i.e., how is appearance possible alongside Being? When the will perceives itself, it must see the same thing, always,</page><page sequence="23">80 James I. Porter i.e., appearance must equally be, like Being, eternally unchanged. There can thus be no talk of a goal, still less of failing to reach a goal." The points are of time: "die ganze Welt ist Erscheinung , durch und durch, Atom an Atom, ohne Zwischenraum. Voll als Erscheinung wahrnehmbar ist.19 Cf. 7[204]: "die Welt . . . ist ein fortw?hrender, Erscheinungen projicirender und dies mit Lust thuender Krampf. Das Atom als Punkt, inhaltslos, rein Erscheinung, in jedem kleinsten Momente werdend, nie seiend." 36. Perhaps there is an echo here of the paradoxes raised by Plato (n. 17, above). 37. See Porter 2000b, chap. 3. 38. The same applies to notes taken as (marking) a thesis. Within utterance, the articu lations of the singing voice and those of its rhythm do not coincide, except at the limit of an irrational (unrecognizable) quantity. Transitions "from note to note [and] syllable to syl lable," while constitutive of rhythmic patterns, cannot in fact be registered by the ear. It is the stable "pauses," the platforms of voice, which are the sensible durations, and which delineate the places where "the singer will locate each of the notes" (Aristoxenus, Elements of Rhythm 2.11); "for the voice [when it sings] moves while it makes an interval, and stands still on a note" (Aristoxenus, Elements of Harmony 12.20; trans. Barker; cf. 12.9). 39. See further Porter 2000b, chap. 3 nn. 14, 47, and 97. 40. Thus, what appear to be "leaps" from time-point to time-point, namely, instances of "action at a distance" (578), are in fact proportionally organized by and for a perceiving subject. There is a bit of a puzzle remaining: the appearance of linear temporality ought to be the result of proportionality (578: "the making-visible of these proportions of force"). But it seems that the proportions are generated first as proportions and only then as a line. Nietzsche owes us an account of this process. I believe this account would have to do with the process of misprision described earlier: the "leaps" are those made by a perceiving subject as it misreads the relationship between points of time, which are not intrinsically proportioned, but only intrinsically infinitesimal, while time under either description may at any event be nothing more than a projection of a perceiving subject.
