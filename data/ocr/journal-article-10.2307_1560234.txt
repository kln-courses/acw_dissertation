<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE BODMER PAPYRUS AND THE PROLOGUE OF ST. JOHN'S GOSPEL BY W. A. WORDSWORTH Honiton On the 28th of December I956 The Times printed a photograph of the first thirteen lines of St. John's Gospel from this MS which was acquired recently by the BODMER Library of Geneva. Its date is thought to be about 200 A.D., i.e. at least Ioo years earlier than Codex Vaticanus and its only rival Sinaiticus, which was purchased from the Russians for the British Museum in 1933 for ? Ioo,ooo. There is extant a precious scrap of papyrus (in JOHN RYLANDS Library) which contains a few words of St. John's Gospel, dated about I30 A.D., but this BODMER papyrus is an even greater treasure, for it is a witness to the text of almost the whole of the Gospel, copied at a date which can hardly be more than Ioo years removed from the original dictation. According to the famous "Anti-Marcionite" preface, which is preserved only in a few ancient MSS of the Vulgate, but was derived from a Greek document of the middle of the 2nd Century A.D., and ultimately from statements of PAPIAS, this Gospel was written down from John's dictation by the hand of MARCION. This brilliant son of the Bishop of Sinope was soon afterwards excommunicated-as the preface tells us- by John; and also by his own father. Half a century later he had become the most famous of heretics. In c. 154 A.D., when, in Rome, he met POLYCARP, the faithful disciple of John and martyr Bishop of Smyrna, he had the impudence to remind him of their former acquaintance; for they had both been pupils of the aged Apostle. "Do you not recognise me, Polycarp ?" "Yes", he replied, "I recognise you as the first-born of Satan." This expression is found also in the Epistle of POLYCARP, in close connection with a quotation from the Ist Epistle of St John, which was also directed against the heretical, docetic, opinions of Marcion, who "denied Jesus Christ to have come in the flesh and did not acknowledge the witness of the Cross." Novum Testamentum II I</page><page sequence="2">W. A. WORDSWORTH It is to the versatile, learned but speculative, scholar, ROBERT EISLER, showing the way to the restoration of the true punctuation of the apparently disjointed Vulgate Preface, that the recovery of this startling testimony concerning the origin of the Johannine Gospel is due. The evidence is given in EISLER'S Enigma of the Fourth Gospel. From the main thesis of his book I differ completely, but it is a lively stimulus to thought. We will now turn to the first lines of the BODMER Papyrus. In these there are only two clear differences from the generally accepted text, and these both come in- the place where it would most naturally be expected; that is at the critical point of junction between verses 3 and 4. It should be observed that though there are some punctuation marks in the MS, here, where most needed, none appears. The Authorised Version rather awkwardly renders verse 3 "All things were made by him: and without him was not anything made that was made. (4) In him was life... etc." In Greek there is no choice, such as we have to make, between Him or It as the pronoun for the Word, the Logos. A perfectly literal translation of the text underlying A.V. is "All things became through it, and apart from it became nothing". In place of "nothing" almost all the best MSS and modern Editors read "not even one." Only the first hand in Codex Sinaiticus, and Codex Bezae wrote "nothing". Now the BODMER Papyrus decidedly supports the original witness of those two MSS, which are the pride of the British Museum and of the Cambridge University Library. The second and more sur- prising variant of the Papyrus is the omission of the two letters EN after yeyovev; instead of "what has become. In it was life", this scribe wrote "what has become. To it was life". It is curious and perhaps significant that these two letters EN are identical in form with gv = one, read "not even one" immediately before it in most MSS. Before discussing the meaning of this BODMER text, I invite attention to three important considerations. (I) The word Xopq "without" occurs twice again in this Gospel: In xx 7, "The napkin which was about his head, not with the linen clothes lying, but separate, wrapped up into one place." So also in xv 5 the idea of separation is stressed: As the branch separated from the vine, so (literally) "Apart from me ye are not able to do nothing." This leads to my second point. (2) In Greek a double negative does not 2</page><page sequence="3">THE BODMER PAPYRUS cancel but emphasises the negative, and this Evangelist seems to use it on almost every possible opportunity: therefore if he intended to say "Without him was not anything made", we should expect him to write "Apart from him was not made nothing." (3) It is essential to bear in mind that this prologue is an echo of the begin- ning of Genesis, especially "And God said, Let there be light , and there was light." To this I shall return; but it is certain that no one can understand the mind of John unless his mind also is steeped in the thought and language of the Old Testament. I suggest therefore that the text of this papyrus should be read: "In the beginning was the Word; And the Word was with God; And the Word was God. This was in the beginning with God: All things became through it: And, separated from it, what has become became naught. To it was life; And the life was the light of men: And the light shines in darkness; And the darkness did not apprehend it. It was the true light that lightens every man; Coming into the world." "Apart from him, what has been made, was made naught", "became nothing." It should be remarked here that in the Septuagint, in at least five places, "Nothing" represents the Hebrew Tohu, which one might represent by "Nohow." The prologue "In the beginning" at once carries the reader's mind back to Genesis. But it is not generally recognised how paradoxical are these first words of our Bible. "In the beginning God created the heavens, and the earth. And (But) the earth became Tohu and Bohu"-(higgledy piggledy) chaos, "and darkness upon the face of the earth". After "the beginning" earth fell away and became separated from Heaven. It is the same idea as in chapters 2 and 3; the good God created something that was good in its origin, but it soon fell under the sway of evil. The first chapter attempts no explanation of the fall; it leaves the mystery of the origin of evil inexplicable, as creatures of time must leave the unimaginable Eternity from which wec ame. I am being who I am being. To ov "art, TO [l ov oux eartv. The being is, the unbeing is naught. After this bare statement of the mystery, that "God created", the writer proceeds immediately to speak of that which can be revealed to man. "God said", "God breathed"; the Word and Spirit of the Almighty set to work on the redemption of the fallen world, on the first day of the new creation, or regeneration, saying "Let there be light" and there was light. The theme of holy scripture 3</page><page sequence="4">W. A. WORDSWORTH is not the primaeval creation-speculation may be left to philoso- phers-but the salvation of the fallen and ruined world of our experience. The word of life has spoken, "And the life was the light of men; and the light shines in the darkness; and the darkness did not apprehend it. It was the true light which lightens every man, coming into the world." The earth became naught after this beginning, falling apart from God; but there came for it a new beginning, since in the determinate counsel of God the Word willed to become incarnate in man upon this planet-and, for all we know, in millions of other forms in millions of other worlds, for "on His Head are many crowns". It is enough for us to know how the Word became flesh in Jesus Christ upon our little earth. Enough indeed. One other recently discovered MS may be brought to bear upon this mystery of the new creation: The "Dead Sea" MS of Isaiah. This Scroll from the Qumran cave (I.Q.Is.a)-which I will call D.S.-in chapter xlv, verses 7 and I8, has three times (out of four) a remarkable variant; instead of the word "creating", which one may represent by the letters BRA, it writes BRH. This verb BRH occurs only once in M.T., in I Samuel xvii 8, where Prof. S. R. DRIVER and the Lexicon reject it without just cause. According to A.V. GOLIATH challenges the army of Saul: "Choose you a man for you" to come out and fight with me. It implies selecting, but the root meaning is probably "cut", and so separate. Before quoting the text of Isaiah xlv I must interject that, in place of the name Jehovah or Yahweh or The Lord, I prefer to substitute YEABE, which preserves in an English form the essential significance inherent in the name, which to Hebrew suggested He was and is and is to be. In Isaiah xlv, M.T. is read: "I am Yeabe and there is none else; Forming light and creating darkness; Making peace and creating evil. I am Yeabe making all these." D.S. is written "Form- ing lightand separating darkness:making good and separating evil; I am Yeabe making all these". In Hebrew the difference between "create" and "separate" is only one letter; but the differ- ence between "peace" and "good" is complete: there could be no confusion in copying. D.S. "good and evil" is obviously better than "peace and evil." Moreover "all these" is rather strange in reference to only two pairs. I do not see how anyone who examines the Hebrew, and is familiar with the faults of scribes, can question the probability that each text has missed out part of a line. I prefer 4</page><page sequence="5">THE BODMER PAPYRUS 5 to retain the two lines of D.S., and insert: "Making peace and creat- ing knowledge", which represents the line from M.T. with knowledge (or opinion) substituted for evil; the confusion between the letters D and R, so familiar to readers of Hebrew. In verse I8 of this chapter D.S. distinguishes the two verbs; "For thus saith Yeabe: Separating the heavens, he is the God; And forming the earth and making it: And he himself makes it sure; Not to tohu he created it: etc." The superiority of the reading "separate" in Is. xlv 7, I8 should be plain to anyone who is willing to see and hear; but, as indicated in Isaiah vi 9 f (and passim) such hearers and seers of his message are rare. How unwilling scholars can be is illustrated by Professor BURRowS' treatment of Isaiah xlv 8 on page 309 of his otherwise excellent book on the Dead Sea Scrolls. He completely ignores differences between the MSS in this verse, which are considerable, and only notices a trivial one. (Much gratitude is due to him for his prompt editing and his generous haste to share the "great spoils" of the Isaiah and other MSS with all who are ready to study them. The overwhelming demands made by the quantity and quality of the treasures found in the caves is sufficient excuse for any defects in his work.) It is an obvious inference from his treatment of verse 8, that he must have dismissed, as careless mistakes of the scribe, the spelling BRH twice in verse 7, and BRH once, with BRA once, in verse I8. So also he leaves unnoticed countless other interesting and important variants throughout the MS. Why should we be hypnotised by the tradition of the Scribes? On the face of it this Dad Sea Scroll is Iooo years older than any previously known MS of the Hebrew text of Isaiah. From the point of view of textual criticism the Massoretes have, with conscientious deliberation, queered the pitch. To save the people from corruption by the slightest error in the sacred scriptures, written by inspired prophets and miraculously preserved and restored by Ezra the Scribe, it was expedient that all errant witnesses should be decently interred- entombed with the corpses of venerable Rabbis. Genesis itself witnesses to the truth that God did not create darkness, but separated it, though it uses a different verb; "God saw the light that is was good. And God separated between the light and the darkness". So also by the firmament he sepa- rated the waters above and beneath. Darkness is nothing; a ne- gation, a separation from light. "And apart from Him all things</page><page sequence="6">W. A. WORDSWORTH became nothing". "God is Light and in Him is no darkness at all", but without Him all is outer darkness. It may be objected that in practical effect there is no real dif- ference between saying "God created" and "God separated" dark- ness and evil. His responsibility for the existence of evil remains. Whenever we attempt to speak about the Infinite and Eternal we inevitably speak foolishly, as Job acknowledged: "I have uttered that I understood not: things too wonderful for me, which I knew not". What is meant by the word create? Anthropomorphism is in- escapable. In man "creation" implies the creative artist giving visible or audible expression to something which he has received in his imagination; he knows not whence it came or whither it goes. When God creates, does he make something out of nothing? BERDYAEV seems to have regarded the meonic "Nothing" as an eternal, unsubstantial substance over against God who is Spirit. Is it not better to say that God, in creating, brings something out of the Being of his Eternal Logos into existence, making it "stand out" into a condition in which it has a potential quasi-independence; whence it may evolve, in the fullness of time, into a personal res- ponse to its creator in free and loving obedience ? What can we say? The Infinite cannot have parts, but out of Infinite Being, something-including ourselves-has evidently come apart into existence.-Yet, by definition nothing can be outside the Infinite.-To itself, when it attains to human consciousness, it appears to be separated from God, the Infinite and Eternal. This must be in some sense an illusion, much as darkness is mere negation, nullity of light, incapacity of reflection. As darkness had a potential existence in light-even in God, "in whom is no darkness at all"-so also in God there are possibilities which could become evil, if it were possible for his Being to become divided, his Power separated from his Wisdom, his Justice separated from his Love, his Spirit working against his Word. But what if Love must in- evitably create spirits which reciprocate his Love? In coming into distinct existence they must fall short of omniscient wisdom; and then how can they certainly avoid experiment in the knowledge of good and evil? How can the liberty of one lacking perfect know- ledge be preserved from all possibility of error ? Socrates was perhaps fundamentally right in identifying sin with ignorance. "Forming light and separating darkness: making good and 6</page><page sequence="7">THE BODMER PAPYRUS 7 separating evil". The Hebrew prophet hardly recognises "secondary causes"; everything is an act of God. So for Hebrew thought "God separates darkness" is virtually equivalent to saying "God allows darkness to separate itself"; much as: "The scripture saith unto Pharaoh, even for this same purpose have I raised thee up, that I might show my power in thee, and that my name might be declared throughout all the earth". The problem of evil in God's creation is for the finite mind in- soluble, but the best pointer towards understanding seems to lie in the words of St. John's Gospel, whatever text be correct. "All things were made through him and apart from him they all became naught. What has been made one, to it is life: and the life was the light of men".</page></plain_text>
