Body language and spiritual harmonies In 1800, little was known about the great apes and their actual apti- tudes. They were still called « orangs-outangs », a generic term taken from Malay designating « woodsmen ».The scientific monographs of the day re- inforced an ambiguity in their representations. Like the natural man of the century of the Enlightenment, the ape remained an intermediate creature, identical to physical man with whom it shares sensibilities and excesses. It would be the task of functional anatomy to measure the extent of the apes' intelligence, no less than to assess the conditions of its perfectibility and its place in hierarchy of living animals. The anthropomorphic depictions lastingly obscured all the symbolic borders between the realms of humans and animals. However, beginning in the years from 1820 to 1830, the discovery of adult orang would rectify this ambivalence. Arrested in its cerebral development at puberty, the ape underwent a regressive metamorphosis that caused its decline. While man rose, ennobled, the orang regressed towards a bestial existence. Fascination and repulsion never ceased to accompany this scholarly fiction. Annie Duprat, Ah, the cursed animal ! Starting from the well-documented observation of the important role caricatures played in the emergence of public opinion, this article will demonstrate why such or such an animal had been chosen by such or such a group or in such or such a circumstance. This effort at establishing an animal alphabet primer will review different animal « stars » (pigs, ostrich, crane, snake, frog, crawfish and so forth) classifying them according to the factions that produced these images and by the moment of their circulation. Deborah COHEN, Live like the dogs? Animal life as a model and anti-model after the Year II After the 9th Thermidor, the animality that militant radicals had de- fended as the foundation of a possible human equality and of a social democracy was set aside by the neo-jacobins in favor of a decorous frugality, as well as by the reactionaries in their construction of the « Other » ; the animal represented for them the jacobin, the People, the negation of civilization. This Annales historiques de la Révolution française - 2014 - N° 3 [277-279]</page><page sequence="2">278 Abstracts article will show that beginning in Thermidor, there was a dramatization of forms of conduct and dress, and in the way of using one's voice and one's body. It is here that the differences are going to play out, the common animality being forgotten. Malik Mellah, Tubs , salons , and stables . The animal companion in Revolution What about the animal companion at the end of the eighteenth cen- tury ? Using a collection of more than two hundred letters sent by urban owners to professors at the Veterinary School in Alfort, this article aims to show that more than just a vogue for scientific knowledge or a change in sensibilities at the end of the Old Regime, the Revolution made the animal into a political question. If veterinarians were present in the salons of the Parisian elites in the mid- 1780s, this appearance owes more to the practice of animal magnetism than to a craze for animals as pets. The issue of animal care has more to do with the concept of utility than with a veritable mutation in sensibilities. Centering on the concept and value of utility, beginning in 1789 and more still after the Year II, the revolutionary dynamic seemed to introduce a new discourse on companion animals. Pierre SERNA, Controlling Animals and Monitoring Citizens, or How to Police Beasts to Better Organize Humans between 1789 and 1799 Co-traduction de Stephen Clay et de Hannah Callaway This article undertakes an unprecedented study of the police of animals in Paris using the procès-verbaux of Section commissioners held at the archives of the Prefecture de Paris. This inquiry reveals the omnipresence of animals in the capital, and the worries they caused for public officials. Not only a source of accidents, and at the very center of debates about public health, in addition to having a commercial interest as meat for butchers, animals raised political questions as well. The way that animals were treated became a matter of concern for it symbolized the relationship to « inferiors » that the spectacle of urban life could rapidly transform into a subject of social tensions. Public order and public health, republican theater, the regulation of commerce, the protection of the weak were all questions that the policing of animals represented in the daily life of the police in the New Regime. Richard W. Burkhardt, Jr., The voice of the lion keeper, or the multiple meanings of the animals of the menagerie of the Museum dyHistoire Naturelle The Museum national d'Histoire Naturelle was represented during the Revolution as a site where the display of the proper images of Nature would</page><page sequence="3">Abstracts 279 help elevate public morality. At the Museum's new menagerie, one claimed, citizens would learn to behave better toward one another if they saw animal nature improved through kind treatment, social interaction, and the enjoyment of at least a certain amount of liberty. There was a gulf, however, between theory and practice. The desired scenarios were not easy to produce. Nor was it easy to control the conclusions that the menagerie's visitors derived from what they saw there. This paper focuses on the lions of the menagerie and the diverse and sometimes contradictory narratives and human projects that emerged in connection with them. Whereas Lacepède suggested that a modern menagerie would be better without lions, the public wanted to see lions, the keeper of the menagerie's fierce animals wanted to exhibit lions, and the government was pleased to have lions as symbols of France's political eminence and global reach. Laurent BRASSART, « Animal Farm » or the invention of the politics of the « useful animal » under the Consulate With the access of leading agronomists to major political posts under the Consulate, the State developed a specific policy concerning « useful animals ». Concentrating on sheep, horses, and to a lesser degree, cattle, this program aimed at the regeneration of French breeds. A plan for importing animals coming from occupied or conquered countries was implemented. National farms were created to improve the breeds and to organize crossbreading with indigenous animals. Yet, at the end of the Empire, the results of this undertaking were disappointing.The scientific uncertainties, the limited support afforded by notables to this project, and in addition, the political and economic circumstances, help to explain this fact.</page></plain_text>
