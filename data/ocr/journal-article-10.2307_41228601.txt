<plain_text><page sequence="1">Jan R. Landwehr, Ann L. McGill, &amp; Andreas Herrmann It's Got the Look: The Effect of Friendly and Aggressive "Facial" Expressions on Product Liking and Sales When designing their products, companies try to employ shapes that are both emotionally appealing and compatible with the brand's image. One way to accomplish these aims is to anthropomorphize a product's appearance. The current research investigates how people decode emotional "facial" expressions from product shapes and how this affects liking of the design, using three studies in the domain of cars and one in the domain of cellular phones. In accordance with theories on the perception of human faces, the first study shows that perception of friendliness is limited to the grille (mouth), while aggressiveness can be communicated with both grille and headlights (eyes). The next study examines the best-liked combination of these two emotional expressions and finds that consumers prefer the combination of an upturned (friendly) grille with slanted (aggressive) headlights. The authors further explain this finding on a process level by showing that this combination triggers a positive affective state of both high pleasure and arousal. The third study validates the results with automobile sales data, and a fourth study extends the findings to another product category. Keywords: product design, anthropomorphism, emotional facial expression, car sales commonly see faces on inanimate objects, including products. For example, knobs, buttons, win- dows, and lights in the right configuration might be perceived as eyes. Handles, trim, slots, grilles, and clasps might convey mouths. The ease with which people see faces in their environment is illustrated in Audi's recent advertise- ment (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=91-HAFm7TPo) and American Express's ad campaign (http://www.youtube. com/watch?v=m56F4EKN9hg), both of which show "faces" on a variety of objects such as handbags, locks, fur- niture, buildings, and cars (see also www.facesinplaces. blogspot.com). A readiness to see faces in objects is per- haps not surprising given psychological research showing that the human face poses an evolutionary, highly relevant stimulus configuration that is processed more quickly and with more attention than most other stimuli in the environ- Jan R.

Indeed, Windhager et al.'s (2008) recent study of car designs confirms the widespread tendency for people to see faces on products. Furthermore, recent research has suggested that the ten- dency to anthropomorphize products in this way goes beyond simply picking up the resemblance to a face. That is, people do not align specific design features with facial features simply to appreciate the analogy but instead seem to actually perceive concrete facial expressions. For exam- ple, Aggarwal and McGill (2007) find that people interpret an upturned grille on a car not simply as a mouth but more specifically as a smile. Participants in Windhager et al.'s (2008) study reported seeing emotional expressions such as aggression and anger in cars. Furthermore, other research has found that design elements corresponding to facial fea- tures affect product liking (Aggarwal and McGill 2007; Windhager et al. 2008). Product designers' ability to suggest a human face and, more specifically, one that conveys a particular emotional expression should provide a powerful tool for marketers. In addition to the direct effect on liking, the facial features of the product might be used to communicate an emotionality corresponding to the brand personality (Aaker 1997; Fournier 1998). Marketers seem to recognize that the face of the product can be an important brand element. For example, when Porsche expanded its product line to the Cayenne sport utility vehicle and Panamera sedan, design- ers were charged with giving the new models the typical Porsche face, familiar to consumers through the well- known 911 and Boxster models.

However, when designers are asked to start from scratch to convey specific emotional expressions in a product's face, they find little research to guide them. Although the current marketing literature acknowledges the importance of product design for a product's success (Bloch 1995; Chitturi, Raghunathan, and Mahajan 2008) and offers rich insights into the effects of elicited emotions on consumer behavior (Bagozzi, Gopinath, and Nyer 1999), the percep- tual and evaluative processes of particular emotional shapes and expressions have received only limited attention. In par- ticular, beyond the general finding that people see human facial expressions on product "faces," no research has been conducted to date showing how particular design elements come together to convey specific emotional expressions. Furthermore, although studies have suggested an effect on liking of facial features, the research is limited and contra- dictory (Aggarwal and McGill 2007; Windhager et al. 2008). Thus, despite the strong tendency to see faces on products and the potentially powerful effect of this tendency on brand perception and liking, the marketing and con- sumer behavior literatures offer nearly nothing on the effects and underlying process of this form of product anthropomorphism, an astonishing omission. The current research is intended to fill these gaps and contribute to the marketing literature in three major respects. First, using extant research on the decoding of emotional expressions in human faces, we show which of a product's design features can be used to express friendliness and aggressiveness. These results contribute to the develop- ing literature on anthropomorphism, and they form a basis from which we can derive practical implications for design- ers hoping to convey emotional expressions corresponding to particular brand personalities. Second, we integrate the conflicting results reported in prior research of a preference for friendly (Aggarwal and McGill 2007) versus aggressive (Windhager et al. 2008) expressions in car fronts by consid- ering the phenomenon from the perspective of the pleasure- arousal theory of emotions (Russell 1980, 1989). This approach enables us to derive and test more fine-tuned hypotheses about the underlying processes responsible for consumers' liking of emotionalized product faces. Third, we address questions of generalizability and external validity by conducting our laboratory studies on two product cate- gories - cars and cellular phones - and by examining real sales data for cars, respectively. We organize the remainder of the article as follows. In the theoretical section, we review literature streams on per- ception of emotional expressions in human faces; emotional facial expressions' role in eliciting pleasure and arousal; and the relationship of pleasure, arousal, and preference judgments. In the empirical section, we report the results of four studies, and in each one we focus exclusively on the effect of design elements that may be perceived as corre- sponding to eyes and a mouth. The first study establishes that people perceive latent predispositions such as friendli- ness and aggressiveness in products when these design ele- ments are shaped to mimic human emotional facial expres- sions such as happiness and anger. Furthermore, perception of these predispositions seems to follow the same rules that have been observed for the processing of human facial expressions. The second study examines how shape manipulations influence consumers' liking and explores the underlying process in a causal model that includes partici- pants' perceptual responses and the corresponding emo- tional reactions as mediators. The third study examines the effects of feature shape on car sales in the German market, and the fourth study extends the findings to cell phones. In the concluding discussion, we provide theoretical and managerial implications and offer recommendations for fur- ther research. Theoretical Background and Hypotheses To allow for a practical application of our findings, we began with objectively defined feature shapes in a product's design and, from there, set out to understand consumers' liking of car designs and their ultimate success in terms of sales. In our research, we focus on shapes associated with the two basic emotional expressions of happiness and anger and how these shapes are perceived and interpreted in terms of the behavioral predispositions of friendliness and aggres- siveness because prior research on human faces has given substantial attention to these expressions (e.g., Ekman 1993; Winkielman, Berridge, and Wilbarger 2005) and they are frequently employed in car design (Welsh 2006). In studies of humans, emotional expressions are under- stood to indicate a person's inner emotional state. In par- ticular, an upturned mouth and arched eyes result when a person feels happy, and a downturned mouth and slanted eyes result when a person feels angry (Ekman 1993). Emo- tional states prepare the organism for specific behavioral responses, and because emotional expressions are recog- nized as reliable indicators of inner emotional states, they contain highly relevant information about likely behavioral tendencies of another person (Frijda 1986). Most important, from an evolutionary point of view, they indicate whether the other person is prepared to attack or cooperate, the most basic tendencies in social behavior (Plutchik 1980). Thus, for their own well-being, people assess the meaning of emotional expressions in terms of the behavioral predispo- sitions they imply - for example, going beyond the interpre- tation of the expression as reflecting happiness (the internal state of the person) to seeing the person as being friendly (the behavioral predisposition; Frijda 1986). Therefore, we formally define "perceived aggressiveness" as the predispo- sition implied by an observed angry facial expression and "perceived friendliness" as the predisposition implied by an observed happy facial expression. In our studies, we mea- sure these predispositions, not the implied emotional states of happiness or anger. In the next sections, we explain when and how these perceptions of friendliness and aggression are also likely to result from product shapes that mimic emotional expressions. Furthermore, we present a theoreti- cal reasoning for downstream effects of these perceptions on liking of the product's appearance. It's Got the Look /133</page><page sequence="3">Perception of Predispositions from Product Shapes Numerous studies have shown that people readily recognize human shapes in nonhuman entities - for example, perceiv- ing the shape of a bottle as suggesting a human body and the dial and hands of a clock as resembling a human face (for a review, see Epley, Waytz, and Cacioppo 2007). This phenomenon is a component of a broader process of anthro- pomorphism, which is the tendency to attribute humanlike characteristics, intentions, and behavior to nonhuman objects. Thus, people not only perceive morphological simi- larities between objects and humans, but they also tend to use the information provided by these physical similarities to infer underlying characteristics of the anthropomor- phized object. Importantly, components of objects that could connote emotional facial expressions are especially likely to be anthropomorphized because, as we outlined in the previous section, these expressions constitute evolution- ary highly relevant cues in the environment (Plutchik 1980). Thus, people may go beyond seeing the clock as having fea- tures that align with those on a human face to perceiving the clock as being friendly or aggressive. As the preceding example suggests, we expect emo- tional expressions in products to trigger perceptual mecha- nisms similar to those triggered by human faces. In particu- lar, research on the decoding of emotional expressions from human faces has established an important asymmetry between the perception of aggressiveness and friendliness: Whereas the perception of aggressiveness is cued by the shape of both the mouth and the eyes, with both features contributing almost equally to the impression, the percep- tion of friendliness is assessed to a much greater degree on the basis of the shape of the mouth, with the shape of the eyes having less influence, though this effect may depend on the respondent's cultural background (Bassili 1979; Elli- son and Massaro 1997; Katsikitis 1997; Yuki, Maddux, and Masuda 2007). The approaches chosen in this line of research range from showing only the upper or lower part of a face (Bassili 1979), to computer-generated artificial faces with fully crossed manipulation of the eye and mouth shape (Ellison and Massaro 1997), to multidimensional scaling of judgments of posed photographs (Katsikitis 1997), to experimentally manipulating photographed faces by substi- tuting features of contradictory emotions between faces (Yuki, Maddux, and Masuda 2007). The faces generated by this latest approach are called chimeric faces (De Bonis 2003) and seemed the most promising for our studies because they provide an experimentally tightly controlled set of natural stimuli. For the object of the current study, cars, Windhager et al. (2010) establish that the grille is perceived and inter- preted as a human mouth and the headlights as human eyes (see also Aggarwal and McGill 2007). Thus, our experi- mental manipulation of emotional expressions involves mouth shape, represented by the grille, as either upturned (friendly) or downturned (aggressive), and eye shape, repre- sented by the headlights, as either arched (friendly) or slanted (aggressive; see Figure 1, Panels A and B). Given people's inherent tendency to anthropomorphize nonhuman FIGURE 1 Compact Cars A: Compact Cars with Upturned Grille and Arched Headlights B: Compact Cars with Downturned Grille and Slanted Headlights entities, we posit that the same asymmetry with respect to perceived behavioral predispositions reported for human faces will occur for product faces: Hj: A downturned grille shape (a) decreases perceived friend- liness and (b) increases perceived aggressiveness com- pared with an upturned grille. H2: (a) Headlight shape does not influence perceived friendli- ness, (b) Slanted headlights increase perceived aggressive- ness compared with arched headlights. Ht and H2 follow from prior research that has estab- lished people's generally high inherent readiness to anthro- pomorphize objects with humanlike morphological configu- rations (Aggarwal and McGill 2007; Epley, Waytz, and Cacioppo 2007; Windhager et al. 2010). Nevertheless, the tendency to anthropomorphize has also been conceptualized as an individual characteristic that makes some people espe- cially prone to anthropomorphize nonhuman entities (Waytz, Cacioppo, and Epley 2010). In addition, people may be more likely to anthropomorphize under specific cir- cumstances - for example, when they feel lonely (Epley, Waytz, and Cacioppo 2007). A person's tendency to "see" a 134 / Journal of Marketing, May 2011</page><page sequence="4">human facial expression on a product may also depend on particular aspects of the product design and its similarities to an activated schema (Aggarwal and McGill 2007). Thus, the effects described here may be muted or enhanced depending on the extent to which people are able to per- ceive the design elements of the products as conveying human qualities. The following hypotheses reflect this pre- dicted moderation by anthropomorphism: H3: (a) The negative effect of a downturned (vs. upturned) grille on perceived friendliness and (b) its positive effect on per- ceived aggressiveness is amplified by participants' anthro- pomorphization of the product, (c) The positive effect of slanted (vs. arched) headlights on perceived aggressive- ness is amplified by participants' anthropomorphization of the product. Affective Responses to the Perception of Emotional Product Shapes The preceding predictions center on people's perceptions of product "facial" expressions as having friendly or aggres- sive predispositions. Next, we examine downstream conse- quences of these perceptions, beginning with affective responses to products perceived as having friendly or aggressive predispositions and then turning to preference for products with such expressions. Research on human emotional facial expressions has established that the mere perception of an emotional expression is sufficient to trigger a differentiated affective response (Duelos et al. 1989). That is, perceiving a given emotional expression with its implied latent behavioral predisposition results in an expression- specific affective response characterized by a particular pro- portion of elicited pleasure and arousal (Reisenzein 1994) - the two core components of any emotional experi- ence (Russell 1980, 1989). In particular, as is directly rele- vant for our investigation, stimuli indicating a friendly behavioral predisposition, such as baby faces and happy human faces, trigger responses characterized by greater pleasure than arousal, while stimuli indicating an aggressive behavioral predisposition, such as angry human faces and snakes, trigger responses characterized by greater arousal than pleasure (Lang 1995; Tanaka-Matsumi et al. 1995; Vrana and Gross 2004). On the basis of people's readiness to anthropomorphize emotional expressions in nonhuman entities, we would expect that the observation of an emo- tional expression in a product's design does not stop with the perceptions of a latent behavioral predisposition but triggers the corresponding pleasure-arousal pattern. Thus, we posit the following: H4: (a) The perception of friendliness triggers an affective response predominantly characterized by pleasure (i.e., the effect of perceived friendliness on experienced plea- sure is greater than its effect on experienced arousal), and (b) the perception of aggressiveness triggers an affective response predominantly characterized by arousal (i.e., the effect of perceived aggressiveness on experienced arousal is greater than its effect on experienced pleasure). Preferences for Emotional Product Shapes The affective response a stimulus elicits is a major determi- nant of its liking (Bagozzi, Gopinath, and Nyer 1999). In particular, people tend to prefer stimuli that elicit high lev- els of pleasure, making pleasure an essential determinant of overall liking (Donovan and Rossiter 1982). In accordance with this proposition, human faces with an upturned "mouth" and arched "eyes," conveying a facial expression of pure friendliness and thus eliciting a high level of plea- sure, are preferred over all other emotional facial expres- sions (Vrana and Gross 2004). However, human facial expressions are unique: Biological reasons limit the extent to which the emotional expression of the eyes can diverge from the emotional expression of the mouth (Ekman 1993). In other words, both facial elements tend to appear either happy or angry; it is difficult to express a mixture of both emotional states. In contrast, when designers provide a product with an emotional "facial" expression, they are free to mix shapes with contradictory emotional meaning. In particular, they can mix a happy expression, which is expected to add pleasure to the affective experience, with an angry expression, which is expected to add arousal to the affective experience. According to the pleasure-arousal approach to emotional experience, such a mixture should be superior in terms of liking because arousal intensifies the experience of pleasure. That is, the overall hedonic value of an affective response is maximized when pleasure meets arousal (Reisenzein 1994). In accordance with this notion, empirical studies in such diverse fields as aesthetic liking of art and abstract patterns (Berlyne 1974), preference for advertisements (Gorn, Pham, and Sin 2001), taste of food (Miniard, Bhatla, and Sirdeshmukh 1992), evaluation of acquaintances (Paulhus and Lim 1994), and effects of store atmosphere (Donovan and Rossiter 1982) have shown that arousal is a moderator that amplifies the positive effect of pleasure on preferences. Thus, we posit the following: H5: (a) The pleasure elicited by a product's appearance increases its liking, (b) The effect of elicited pleasure on liking is moderated by arousal, such that arousal amplifies the positive effect of pleasure. When we combine these predictions of the pleasure- arousal theory with the previous predictions regarding the perceptual mechanisms of emotional facial expressions, it becomes possible to derive detailed predictions about the combination of emotional shapes that consumers should prefer in anthropomorphized product designs. Liking is maximized when a design is able to elicit high levels of pleasure and arousal simultaneously. When a design implies a latent aggressiveness, it elicits high levels of arousal and only low levels of pleasure. When a design implies a latent friendliness, it elicits high levels of pleasure and only low levels of arousal. Therefore, we expect a design that implies both friendliness and aggressiveness to be most liked because this combination elicits high levels of pleasure and arousal. Based on the asymmetry in perceiving these latent predispositions, one particular mixture of emotional facial elements can be expected to be most liked: Because friend- liness is only perceived in a product's "mouth," this feature must appear happy by being upturned. Although aggressive- Iťs Got the Look /135</page><page sequence="5">ness can in principle be perceived in both a product's "eyes" and its "mouth," it must be communicated by the shape of the "eyes" because the "mouth" is already in use to commu- nicate friendliness. Therefore, the "eyes" must appear angry by being slanted to add arousal to the overall experience. Thus, to summarize our theoretical reasoning throughout this section and to integrate the seemingly contradictory findings of Aggarwal and McGill (2007) and Windhager et al. (2008), we propose the following: H6: (a) A downturned (vs. upturned) mouth decreases con- sumers' liking of a design, and (b) slanted (vs. arched) eyes increase consumer's liking of a design. Study 1 : Perceived Emotional "Facial" Expressions We designed the first study to test Н1а-Н2ь - specifically, whether the decoding of emotional expressions in product "faces" follows the same perceptual rules as the decoding in human faces. We expected that friendliness is only per- ceived in the mouth, while aggressiveness can be recog- nized in both the mouth and the eyes. Design, Stimuli, and Procedure Participants in the first study were presented a set of car "faces" with emotional expressions and asked to indicate perceived aggressiveness and friendliness. Our experimen- tal design involved grille shape (upturned, downturned) and headlight shape (arched, slanted) as within-subject factors. To ensure that the effects obtained are due to mouth shape and eye shape and not to some other inherent aspect of the stimulus material, we employed multiple operationaliza- tions (16) of each of the four (mouth shape by eye shape) experimental cells. An additional fifth cell contained the corresponding 16 neutral facial expressions as a control condition. The car faces were created in a two-stage approach. First, the 16 most important compact cars on the German market were photographed in a comparable grey metallic paint under standardized conditions in a professional photo- graphic studio. Second, a team of professional car designers modified the grilles and headlights of these cars to resemble the shapes of happy- and angry-looking human faces (Ekman 1993). The resulting feature shapes were combined in a full 2 (grille shape: upturned vs. downturned) x 2 (headlight shape: arched vs. slanted) experimental design and accompanied by a neutral version (straight grille/ straight headlights), resulting in five versions of each of the 16 original cars (for illustrative examples, see Figure 1, Panels A and B). To validate that the shape manipulations of a down- turned (upturned) mouth and slanted (arched) eyes primar- ily elicit the corresponding perceptions of aggressiveness (friendliness), we conducted a qualitative pretest with N = 44 typical car consumers (57% women, Mage = 46.5 years). To this end, we showed participants the neutral, upturned grille/arched lights, and downturned grille/slanted lights version of 1 of the 16 cars (randomly chosen). The partici- pants were asked to produce for each of the three pictures the adjective that best described the car. In accordance with our expectation, we found that the downturned/slanted car was most often described by an adjective related to aggres- siveness (47%) and the upturned/arched car was most often described by a word related to friendliness (35%). For both versions of the car, "sportiness" was also mentioned several times (17% and 19%, respectively), but no other adjective was used frequently (all other frequencies &lt; 8%). To find out the extent to which people perceive friendli- ness and aggressiveness in the manipulated car faces, we created an online questionnaire in which participants were randomly assigned to 1 of the 16 multiple operationaliza- tions. Participants were shown all five versions of the cho- sen stimulus in random order. In accordance with research on the perception of emotional expression in human faces (Tanaka-Matsumi et al. 1995), participants were asked to indicate for each of these stimuli how strongly they perceive friendliness and aggressiveness, respectively, on visual ana- log scales with the endpoints labeled "not at all" and "very strong." The scales had a resolution of 1000 points, no fur- ther identifying marks other than the labels, and a default position for the slider at the lower end of the scale. Partici- pants had the opportunity to adjust the slider before provid- ing their final evaluation, and they provided their judgments at their own pace. A market research company assembled a sample of 263 participants (36.9% women, Mage = 35.65 years) according to the following criteria: (1) The monthly household income should be in a range typical for new car buyers, and (2) participants had to have bought a new car within the past year or had to be planning to buy a car within the next two years. Participants were financially compensated. Results We analyzed responses using a repeated measures analysis of variance (RM-ANOVA) with grille shape (upturned, downturned) and headlight shape (arched, slanted) specified as within-subject factors. We performed separate analyses for perceived aggressiveness and friendliness. Figure 2 depicts the means and standard errors for both these depen- dent measures. With respect to perceived friendliness, we obtained the highest rating for cars with upturned grille/arched lights (M = 289.07, SD = 17.22), closely followed by the combination of upturned grille/slanted lights (M = 271.50, SD = 17.16). The ratings for both the downturned grille/slanted lights (M = 151.54, SD = 13.72) and downturned grille/arched lights (M = 143.89, SD = 13.27) are considerably lower. The results of the RM-ANOVA reveal that only the shape of the grille exerts a significant impact on perceived friendliness (F(l, 262) = 97.47, ρ &lt; .001; ηρ = .271) but neither the main effect of headlights (p &gt; .713) nor the interaction reaches significance {p &gt; .185). Compared with the neutral control condition, all four conditions differ significantly (p &lt; .001). In other words, an upturned "mouth" increases the percep- tion of friendliness compared with a neutral shape, and a downturned "mouth" decreases such a perception. A neutral shape itself lies in between and is perceived as expressing a moderate level of friendliness. 136 / Journal of Marketing, May 201 1</page><page sequence="6">FIGURE 2 Perceived Friendliness and Aggressiveness in Car Fronts Depending on Feature Shape with Standard Errors Indicated A: Perceived Friendliness 400 | 350 i ^300 Τ ι200 ■ ■ &amp; 1 1 ■ ι Arched Slanted Arched Slanted Neutral Eyes Eyes Eyes Eyes Expression Upturned Mouth Downturned Mouth B: Perceived Aggressiveness 400 ι l· о 300 | Щ о 300 Щ illl Arched Slanted Arched Slanted Neutral Eyes Eyes Eyes Eyes Expression Upturned Mouth Downturned Mouth The second dependent variable, perceived aggressive- ness, reaches its maximum for a car with downturned grille/ slanted lights (M = 353.00, SD = 19.65), followed by the combination of upturned grille/slanted lights (M = 271.03, SD = 18.02), downturned grille/arched lights (M = 244.91, SD = 17.96), and upturned grille/arched lights (M = 189.13, SD = 15.25). In contrast to the results obtained for per- ceived friendliness, both grille shape (F(l, 262) = 28.97, ρ &lt; .001; ηρ2 = .100) and headlight shape (F(l, 262) = 31.57,/? &lt; .001; ηρ2 = .108) influence perceived aggressiveness, according to the RM-ANOVA. However, the interaction of these factors was not significant (p &gt; .257). The upturned grille/arched lights condition does not differ significantly from the neutral control condition (p = .594), though all other conditions do (p &lt; .001). This indicates that either slanted eyes or a downturned mouth (or both) must be pre- sent to elicit a perception of aggressiveness. However, arched lights combined with an upturned grille do not elicit a remarkable perception of aggressiveness and are on the same level as neutral shapes. Discussion The results of our first study replicate prior findings, indi- cating that consumers perceive cars, at least to some extent, as having faces similar to those of people (Aggarwal and McGill 2007; Windhager et al. 2010). Participants reported seeing latent behavioral predispositions in car faces and seemed to perceive the grille as a human mouth and head- lights as human eyes to judge the meaning of emotional expressions. More important, we were able to support our hypotheses by showing that, in line with what is already known about human faces, perception of friendliness is exclusively influenced by the shape of the grille (Hla and H2a) while perception of aggressiveness is influenced by both grille (Hlb) and headlight (Н2ь) shape. In other words, an upturned grille, like the smile it resembles, conveys a friendly behavioral predisposition, whereas a downturned one conveys an aggressive behavioral predisposition. Head- lights do not influence perceived friendliness, but slanted lights convey aggressiveness. This finding extends existing knowledge with the notion that some fundamental princi- ples of emotional decoding of human faces also hold for anthropomorphized objects and helps designers focus their work on particular features when they intend to express a certain behavioral predisposition in a product's "face." Study 2: Emotional Facial Shapes and Liking: A Causal Model of the Underlying Mechanism Study 1 establishes that people use the same perceptual schemata to decode emotional expressions in a product's face that they do in human faces. However, it does not pro- vide further information about the important practical and theoretical question which combination of emotional shapes consumers prefer. Instead of providing a clear picture, exist- ing research poses a theoretical puzzle regarding people's preferences for emotional expressions in product faces. While Windhager et al. (2008) find evidence for a prefer- ence for angry expressions in car fronts, Aggarwal and McGill (2007) find that people prefer car fronts with a smile. A closer examination of the methodological approaches these two research teams employed might help identify dif- ferences in the respective approaches responsible for the contradictory findings. Participants in the Windhager et al. study indicated their liking of existing car models and showed a preference for car models that conveyed an expression of power - in particular, models that tended to sit low or wide and have slanted headlights with a wider air intake. Windhager et al. interpret these findings as showing It's Got the Look /137</page><page sequence="7">a preference for aggressive or angry-looking cars. However, a difficulty of this research is that it used existing car mod- els and did not systematically vary the shapes of features within a given model. Although appealing in its use of real products, this method creates a confound between designer and design. That is, the tendency for participants to like angry-looking cars, such as the BMW 5 series, might be the result of talented designers at BMW choosing an angry design. The preference may come from the overall quality of the design, not its specifics. Had less talented designers produced angry cars, the designs might not have been so well liked. Taking a different approach to the evaluation of car faces, Aggarwal and McGill (2007) use a methodology that allowed for more finely tuned inferences regarding the effect of facial features on evaluations. Specifically, they presented an otherwise identical model of a car with its grille in a turned up or down position so that the specific, independent effect of the feature could be examined. They showed that a smiling grille is preferred over a frowning grille, but only if the car could be anthropomorphized (when it was presented in human terms). In contrast, when the car was presented as an object that inhibited anthropo- morphization, people's preference did not depend on grille shape. This finding points to the importance of perceiving the analogy between a product's face and a human face before effects of emotionalized facial features can occur. If this process of anthropomorphism is actively inhibited, as in Aggarwal and McGill's second condition, the effect of emo- tional expressions on liking seems to diminish. The current research integrates and extends the findings of both these prior investigations of car faces by focusing more clearly on the two major facial features that convey emotionality: the eyes/headlights and the mouth/grille (Welsh 2006). As outlined previously, Windhager et al.'s (2008) experimental design considers only the emotionality of the headlights, while Aggarwal and McGill (2007) exclu- sively investigate the emotionality of the grille. To investi- gate the potentially interactive effect of these two design features on liking, we independently manipulated and crossed both elements with each other, as in our first study. Furthermore, while Aggarwal and McGill provide impor- tant insights by considering the effect of hindering anthro- pomorphization, they do not examine the plain effects of emotionalized facial features in products without any pre- ceding activation of human or object schemata. The current study is intended to do so and to provide more detailed information about the underlying process. Design, Stimuli, and Procedure To test the mediating mechanism between headlight and grille shape on the one hand and liking on the other hand, we employed a 2 (headlight shape: arched vs. slanted) χ 2 (grille shape: upturned vs. downturned) x 16 (multiple car operationalizations) between-subjects design. The employed stimulus material was identical to that of our first study. Participants were randomly assigned to 1 of the 64 experi- mental stimuli and were asked to evaluate it on several mea- surement scales, which were each shown on a separate screen, with the car's picture always presented on the top of the page. Whenever possible, we used existing measures of the constructs and adapted them to this study's context. First, they had to indicate their global liking of the car's design on a seven-point Likert-type scale ("How much do you like this car's design?" 1 = "I don't like it," and 7 = "I like it very much"; adapted from Windhager et al. 2008). Next, they were asked to indicate their perception of latent behavioral predispositions. In contrast to the first study, we used two-item measures for each dimension, established in research on human face evaluation, to capture more facets of the predispositions and increase the comparability to research on human face perception (Oosterhof and Todorov 2008; Tanaka-Matsumi et al. 1995). In particular, participants were asked to indicate perceived friendliness and trustworthi- ness and perceived aggressiveness and dominance on separate seven-point scales ("This car looks friendly/trustworthy/ aggressive/dominant"; 1 = "does not apply," and 7 = "applies"). We pooled the first two items to build the latent friendliness construct (Cronbach's α = .89) and the last two items to build the latent aggressiveness construct (Cron- bach's α = .80). Thereafter, they were asked to indicate their experienced pleasure and arousal measured by the Self- Assessment Manikin scale, which, similar to the origi- nal version, consisted of nine images (Lang 1980). Previous research has confirmed desirable psychometric properties of this scale (Bradley and Lang 1994), and thus, it seems adequate for the current research context. Finally, partici- pants were also asked to indicate to what extent they had anthropomorphized the car's face on another seven-point item (anthropomorphic perception: "How strongly does this car design remind you of a human face?" 1 = "hardly," and 7 = "strong"). Prior research has established high correla- tions among measures of anthropomorphism (e.g., Aggar- wal and McGill 2007, from which the preceding measure was adapted; Kim and McGill 2010), giving us confidence in this single-item measure of the construct.1 A market research company assembled a sample of members of a consumer online panel and screened out par- !In addition to our global liking measure, we also included two further measures that tap related aspects in an automotive context: Intention to test drive ("I would like to test drive this car"; 1 = "disagree," and 7 = "agree") and to buy the car ("I could imagine buying this car"; 1 = "disagree," and 7 = "agree"). Both measures are highly correlated with our global liking judgment (r &gt; .78, ρ &lt; .001) and are affected in a similar way. We also included a mea- sure to control for the alternative that the emotional shapes affect consumers' liking because of the perceived innovativeness of the car's design ("I consider this car design [compared to recent car designs] to be ..."; 1 = "classic," and 7 = "innovative"; adapted from Carbon and Leder 2005). We tested this measure as an addi- tional mediator in an alternative model in which it was specified to mediate, in addition to the paths described in our theoretically derived model, between the experimental conditions and liking. Because our baseline model is not nested within this alternative, we cannot perform a formal test of comparative model fit. How- ever, both Akaike information criteria (AICbaseline = 21,409.20, AICaiternative = 23,104.88) and Bayesian information criteria (BICbaseline = 21,571.83, BICalternative = 23,293.88) indicate that including the innovative measure is not justified. Moreover, it does not have a significant effect on liking (p = .626), indicating that our baseline model is a sufficient representation of the data. 1 38 / Journal of Marketing, May 201 1</page><page sequence="8">ticipants who finished the questionnaire in less than half the expected time and had a monotonous answering scheme, resulting in a final sample of N = 599 participants (48% women, Mage = 44 years), who were financially compen- sated for participation. Results The second study is intended to provide further evidence for Hla-H2b and to test H3a-H6b. Figure 3 provides an overview of our hypotheses and the implied causal model. In particu- lar, as proposed in Н1а-Н2ь and already supported by our first study, we expect yj to be negative, γ2 and γ3 to be posi- tive, and Y4 to be nonsignificant. That is, perceived friendli- ness is only affected by grille shape, while perceived aggressiveness is affected by both grille and headlight shape. As postulated in H3a-H3c, we further expect that an anthropomorphic perception amplifies the effects given by yh γ2, and γ3. According to H4a, we expect ßi to be larger than ß2. That is, perceived friendliness triggers predomi- nantly pleasure and, only to a lesser extent, arousal. H4b pos- tulates that ß3 is larger than ß4, which means that perceived aggressiveness triggers more arousal than pleasure. H5a states that experienced pleasure increases liking (ß5) - an effect that is, as H55 states, further amplified by arousal (βγ). Table 1 provides an overview of the relationships between the eight constructs and the four interaction effects given in the hypothesized causal model summarized in Fig- ure 3. Furthermore, the bottom of Table 1 provides means and standard deviations of our model's endogenous variables conditional on the experimental condition. These descriptive statistics are accompanied by the results of a one-factorial ANOVA, which tested for mean differences between the experimental cells. Ultimately, it is of primary interest which combination of feature shapes consumers like best. According to our theoretical reasoning, we would expect the highest liking ratings for cars with an upturned grille (H6a) and slanted headlights (H6b). Thus, before we evaluate the process mechanisms of our model, we intend to establish the total effect of the shapes on liking. Figure 4 provides the means and standard errors of the liking judgments conditional on the experimental manipulations. A two-factorial ANOVA shows that an upturned grille is preferred over a downturned grille (F(l, 595) = 9.65, ρ = .002) and slanted headlights are preferred over arched headlights (F(l, 595) = 3.89, ρ = .049). However, these two features do not interact with each other (F(l, 595) = 1.33, ρ = .249). Thus, our data support H6a and H6b. Following the guidelines MacKenzie (2001) proposes for the analysis of experiments using structural equation models, we estimated the causal model shown in Figure 3 using Mplus 4.1 applying the scaled Satorra-Bentler proce- dure (Muthén and Muthén 2007). We constrained the error variances of the two items measuring aggressiveness and the two measuring friendliness to be equal to ascertain that the model is locally identified. The resulting overall fit mea- sures indicate that our model is a plausible representation of the structures underlying the empirical data: χ2(47) = 246.40, ρ &lt; .001; comparative fit index = .926; Tucker- Lewis index = .890; root mean square error of approxima- tion = .084; and standardized root mean square residual = .050. Of the 13 hypotheses, 12 are supported, with parame- ter estimates significant at least at the 5% error level and in the expected direction. Perceived aggressiveness is significantly influenced by headlight shape (slanted; γ3 = .170, ρ &lt; .001) and grille shape (downturned; γ2 = .1 15, ρ &lt; .001).

Moreover, we found a significant main effect of anthropomorphic perception (γ = .158, ρ &lt; .001). However, the interaction of the two feature shapes and the interaction between headlights and anthropomor- phic perception do not reach significance (p &gt; .131). There- fore, Hlb, H2b, and H3b find statistical support, but we must reject H3c. In accordance with Hla, perceived friendliness is signif- icantly influenced by grille shape (downturned; у{ = -.242, ρ &lt; .001) - an effect further amplified by anthropomorphic perception (γιχ = -.162, ρ &lt; .001) - but, as H2a predicts, not by headlight shape (γ4 = -.005, ρ = .893). Moreover, we find a significant main effect of anthropomorphic percep- tion (γ = .138, ρ &lt; .001). The interaction of the two feature shapes and the interaction between headlights and anthro- pomorphic perception do not reach significance (p &gt; .077). Therefore, Hla, H2a, and H3a find statistical support. As H4a predicts, perceived friendliness triggers predom- inantly pleasure φλ = .820, SE = .042, ρ &lt; .001) accompa- nied by a comparably smaller amount of arousal (β2 = .628, SE = .045, ρ &lt; .001; Δβ1, β2 = .192, SE = .045; t(45) = 4.293, ρ &lt; .001). In contrast, as H4b predicts, perceived aggressiveness triggers predominantly arousal (β3 = .461, SE = .051; ρ &lt; .001) accompanied by a comparably smaller amount of pleasure (β4 = .304, SE = .048, ρ &lt; .001 ; A$x ^ = .157, SE = .045; t(45) = 3.511, ρ = .001). Thus, both H4a and H4b find empirical support. 140 / Journal of Marketing, May 2011</page><page sequence="10">FIGURE 4 Liking of Car Fronts by Shape of Grille and Lights with Standard Errors Indicated 5.0 1 1. 1 Arched Slanted Arched Slanted Eyes Eyes Eyes Eyes Upturned Mouth Downturned Mouth Finally, liking is positively affected by pleasure (ß5 = .790, ρ &lt; .001), an effect further enhanced by the interaction of pleasure and arousal (β7 = .039, ρ - .021). Moreover, the main effect of arousal also reaches statistical significance (β6 = .089, ρ = .004). Thus, our empirical findings also sup- port H5a and H5b. In total, 71.4% of the variance in our lik- ing measure can be explained by the current model. Prior theory has suggested that arousal and pleasure are likely to be positively correlated, especially when the evalu- ated stimuli do not elicit strong displeasure (Bradley and Lang 1994), and that perceived friendliness and aggressive- ness are negatively correlated (Windhager et al. 2008). Thus, we included these correlations in our model estima- tion and found empirical support for both (rpleasure&gt; ^ο^ = .208, ρ &lt; .001; rfriendliness, aggressiveness = "-236, ρ &lt; '.001). In addition, we performed a formal test of mediation to exam- ine the sequential pattern of effects hypothesized in our model. We tested an alternative model to our previously described baseline model that additionally included direct paths from our experimental manipulations on liking. Because we used Satorra and Bender's (2001) scaled chi- square statistic for our calculations, we followed their rec- ommended procedure to obtain the appropriate chi-square difference test statistics. We found that including the direct paths did not significantly improve the model's fit (%d(3) = 6.30, ρ = .100), which indicates full mediation. In summary, our analyses support the hypothesized two-step mediation by perceptual and emotional processes. Discussion The results of the mediation model provide rich insights into the influence of grille shape and headlight shape on the evaluation of cars. First, our findings indicate that people perceive emotional expressions in car "faces" in the same way they do in human faces, thus replicating findings of Study 1. That is, friendliness is only perceived in an upturned grille (mouth), while aggressiveness is perceived in both a downturned grille (mouth) and slanted headlights (eyes). It is noteworthy that the effect of the grille shape on perceived predispositions is moderated by people's anthro- pomorphic perception of the car fronts. In other words, the effects become stronger when people see the car front as a face. Unexpectedly, the effect of headlight shape on per- ceived aggressiveness was not moderated by anthropomor- phic perception. This finding is probably due to the estab- lished insight that the eyes are the most important perceptual feature of the human face, which is always con- sidered first and longer than all other facial features (Wind- hager et al. 2010). Thus, eyes are probably such an impor- tant facial feature that they are perceived as humanlike independently of a person's anthropomorphic perception. In summary, consumers seem to evaluate cars not solely on the basis of the direct aesthetic appeal of grille or head- light shape but also because these shapes convey different emotional expressions. However, the overall liking of a car front's appearance does not result strictly from the inherent valence of the involved emotions but rather is a joint func- tion of the pleasure and arousal elicited by perceived friend- liness and aggressiveness. While perceived friendliness pri- marily triggers pleasure (H4a), an additional perception of aggressiveness enhances the emotional experience by adding a high level of arousal (H4b). In accordance with the pleasure-arousal theory of emotions (Russell 1980, 1989), our results further show that pleasure and arousal both posi- tively affect liking of a car's design. Importantly, arousal not only yields a main effect but also moderates the effect of pleasure on liking. That is, arousal increases the effect of pleasure on liking, which further supports the notion of a complementary function of pleasure and arousal, in support of H5b. In conclusion, the mediation model sheds light on the underlying mechanisms that make people prefer a car with an upturned grille (H6a) but slanted headlights (H6b). Study 3: The Best-Selling Mix of Emotional Facial Shapes The third study is aimed at generating evidence for the external validity of the results. We also estimate the impact of designing a product's appearance according to human facial shapes on its ultimate success in terms of sales. Design, Stimuli, and Procedure We chose to analyze car sales in the German market during 2008 because the German Federal Motor Transport Author- ity (Kraftfahrt Bundesamt, KBA) provides official statistics of admissions of new cars. We analyzed all mass-market car segments (from mini cars to executive cars, omitting luxury cars, sports cars, sport utility vehicles, and vans) but omit- ted cars that were sold less often than 100 times during 2008 from the analysis because they constitute outliers and are not important market players. Likewise, we also omitted cars that were introduced during 2008 because, on the one hand, their sales are biased due to their recent introduction (attraction of the new) and, on the other hand, any extrapo- lation of partial data onto the whole year might be biased It's Got the Look /141</page><page sequence="11">because of seasonal effects. We included 123 cars in the analysis, which account for approximately 73% of all car sales in Germany during 2008. For each car, we obtained the aggregated sales during 2008 as the dependent variable from the statistics of the transport authority. To determine the shape of the cars' headlights and grilles, we asked three psychologists trained in the categorization of emotional facial expressions according to Ekman (1993) to rate images of the cars according to the shape in a forced-choice procedure. All three judges were blind to our research hypotheses. We intentionally based the categorization of the cars on expert judgments, which are less likely than con- sumer judgments to be biased by preexisting associations, because we are interested in the basic relationship between two inherently objective measures: the mere product shape and its actual sales. The ratings achieved a reliability of .85 according to the proportional reduction in loss approach (Rust and Cooil 1994), which indicates adequate observer agreement. For cars for which one rater disagreed with the other two, we chose the shape categorization of the major- ity. The respective car images for the expert ratings were provided by a leading commercial car database (Eurotax- Glass's International), which also provided information on the cars' market price as a control variable for the analysis. Furthermore, we obtained data on the subjectively experi- enced brand image and the environmental friendliness of the cars from a leading German magazine (Focus; www.focus.de), which conducted a large consumer survey with 182,475 ratings for the first control variable and 177,811 ratings for the second. Results Before conducting the analysis, we checked the distribu- tional properties of the dependent variable sales, because the automobile market is characterized by a high amount of heterogeneity and likely outliers. In accordance with this expectation, we found the sales variable to be highly posi- tively skewed. Thus, we log-transformed sales to normalize the distribution and allow an analysis that includes all cases. We checked for the distribution of the log-transformed sales and found the assumption of normality fulfilled. We used this transformed variable for all subsequent analyses. Figure 5 shows the means and standard errors of the log- transformed sales variable depending on the factors grille shape (upturned vs. downturned) and headlight shape (arched vs. slanted). As Figure 5 shows, and in accordance with the earlier results, we found the highest sales for car designs with an upturned grille but slanted headlights (M = 9.19, SE = .24), followed by an upturned grille with arched headlights (M = 8.56, SE = .30), a downturned grille/slanted headlights (M = 8.38, SE = .28), and a downturned grille/arched headlights (M = 7.75, SE = .42). We tested these mean differences for significance by regressing the log-transformed sales on headlight shape (-1 = arched, 1 = slanted), grille shape (-1 = upturned, 1 = downturned), and their interaction. As con- trols, we included price of the car, rated brand image, rated environmental friendliness, and segment (dummy coded: small cars served as the reference category, and five cate- gories were considered in total) to account for potentially FIGURE 5 Sales of Cars by Shape of Grille and Lights with Standard Errors Indicated 10.0 s: 9.5 « l^ φ 9-0 ; Η ο τ ΗΗ .s |^ НН τ 1 1 il Arched Slanted Arched Slanted Eyes Eyes Eyes Eyes Upturned Mouth Downturned Mouth confounding effects. In accordance with the results for lik- ing in the second study, the regression model shows a nega- tive effect of a downturned (vs. upturned) grille shape (b = -.359, t = -2.325, ρ = .022) and a positive effect of a slanted (vs. arched) headlight shape (b = .328, t = 2.106, ρ = .037). Furthermore, the model indicated a positive effect of brand image (b = 1.501, t = 1.886, ρ = .062) and negative effects for compact cars (b = -.702, t = -1.779, ρ = .078), midsize executive cars (b = -1.357, t = -2.601, ρ = .01 1), and execu- tive cars (b = -1.897, t = -2.207, ρ = .029). AU other effects were not significant (p &gt; .626), and the model explains 34% of the variance in the log-transformed sales. Discussion The third study extended the findings of Studies 1 and 2 to a real-world dependent variable that is of maximal rele- vance to marketers: the absolute sales of a product. We were able to replicate our questionnaire-based results in the con- text of sales. That is, for both liking judgments and sales, customers prefer the combination of an upturned grille and slanted headlights. Importantly, this effect also holds when we control for potentially confounding variables such as price, brand image, environmental friendliness, and car seg- ment. Thus, an appealing combination of emotional expres- sions in a design conducive to anthropomorphizing not only fosters liking but also pays off in monetary terms. Study 4: Generalizability to Other Product Categories: Cell Phones The first three studies examine the effect of product shapes conducive to anthropomorphizing using car fronts and pro- vide converging evidence that consumers prefer the combi- nation of an upturned grille/mouth and slanted headlights/ eyes because of the simultaneous elicitation of pleasure and 142 / Journal of Marketing, May 2011</page><page sequence="12">arousal this combination of features achieves. Although all three studies attest to the robustness of the general pattern, the generalizability of the obtained results is nevertheless questionable because we used only cars as stimuli. Cars are used in a more social manner, and a mixed expression of friendliness and aggressiveness may be particularly appeal- ing for drivers in negotiating the complexities of traffic. Therefore, we cannot rule out the caveat that cars are a spe- cial product category and the obtained preferences for fea- ture shapes only hold for cars. To examine the generaliz- ability of the obtained effects and the underlying mechanism, we designed the fourth study to replicate the results for a completely unrelated product category - namely, cell phones, which provide an example of the increasingly important product category of consumer electronics. Design, Stimuli, and Procedure A modern cell phone with two upper buttons in a configura- tion so that they might be perceived as corresponding to eyes and a larger lower button corresponding to a mouth served as a starting point for the stimulus material. A pro- fessional graphic designer removed all indications of the particular manufacturer of the cell phone and manipulated the buttons according to the experimental conditions. To this end, the designer manipulated both upper "eye" buttons on two levels (arched vs. slanted) and the lower "mouth" button on two levels (upturned vs. downturned). Figure 6 depicts the resulting images. We manipulated both factors within subjects, resulting in four images that were shown in random order. Partici- pants indicated their liking of the cell phone on a seven- point Likert-type scale and arousal and pleasure on a nine- picture version of the Self- Assessment Manikin scale (Lang 1980). A market research company assembled a sample of 146 consumers (47% women, Mage = 44.49 years), who were financially compensated for participation. Results To account for the repeated measurement structure of the data, we used linear mixed models that include a random intercept to account for the intercorrelation induced by the repeated measurements. All analyses are based on the LME function of the NLME library of the statistical package R with all estimation parameters set to their defaults (Pinheiro et al. 2008). Figure 6 contains the descriptive statistics; in accordance with the previous studies, a cell phone with upturned mouth and slanted eyes received the highest liking ratings. To test for significance of the mean differences and to establish arousal and pleasure as mediating constructs, we estimated three types of regression equations. In the first model, we regressed liking on the effect-coded experimen- tal conditions and their interaction. In accordance with the results for car fronts, we found a positive effect of a slanted (vs. arched) eye shape (b = .217, t = 4.393, ρ &lt; .001) and a negative effect of a downturned (vs. upturned) mouth shape (b = -.334, t = -6.745, ρ &lt; .001) but no interaction (p = .972). Second, we regressed arousal and pleasure on the exper- imental conditions. For arousal, we found a positive effect of a slanted eye shape (b = .219, t = 4.361, ρ &lt; .001) and a negative effect of a downturned mouth shape (b = -.229, t = -4.566, ρ &lt; .001) but no interaction (p = .785). Although we would have expected the effect of eye shape to be larger than the effect of mouth shape, a post hoc test revealed that the absolute values of these two coefficients do not differ (Ab = .010, SE = .071, t(435) = .145, ρ = .885), indicating FIGURE 6 Cell Phones with Shape Manipulation and Corresponding Liking Judgments 1 1 j^H^I II t Щ^В^н · ifl^l^H 1 1 ll^l^l 1 1 iHf^H II I 1Иг^И 1И!^И 1 1 ЯИР^Н I} : 1Ш;'^^^И lil ^'"·*^ίΗΕΕί^Η * ■ ;t :?

For pleasure, we found a positive effect for a slanted eye shape (b = .291, t = 4.996, ρ &lt; .001) and a negative effect for a downturned mouth shape (b = -.517, t = -8.874, ρ &lt; .001) but no interaction (p = .725). Importantly, a post hoc test revealed that the absolute values of these two coefficients differ significantly (Ab = .226, SE = .082, t(435) = 2.743, ρ = .006), indicating that, in accor- dance with our prior findings, the mouth is a more powerful trigger of pleasure than the eyes. Finally, we regressed liking on the experimental condi- tions in addition to pleasure, arousal, and their interaction. Again, we found significant effects of pleasure (b = 1.300, t = 28.027, ρ &lt; .001; Sobel: ζ = 8.460, ρ &lt; .001), arousal (b = .202, t = 4.131, ρ &lt; .001; Sobel: ζ = 2.999, ρ = .003), and their interaction (b = .061, t = 1.932, ρ = .054; Sobel: ζ = 1.888, ρ = .059) but no effect of the experimental conditions anymore (all/?s &gt; .305), indicating full mediation. Discussion Study 4 provides evidence that the proposed preference for an upturned mouth and slanted eyes in products conducive to anthropomorphizing is not limited to the design of car fronts but can be extended to other product categories that are not as heavily associated with the face metaphor, such as cell phones. Importantly, we replicated not only the gen- eral liking pattern but also the proposed underlying mecha- nism of an enhancement in the experienced pleasure accom- panied by arousal, which further attests to the robustness of the obtained results. General Discussion This article begins with the observation that consumers fre- quently see faces on products and that marketers can design these "faces" to convey brand image and personality. The front of a car may readily be perceived as a face, given the standard placement of the two headlights and the grille. Clocks and watches are also commonly described as having a face, especially because they frequently have a round dial and hands that in the right combination tip up or down like smiles or frowns. However, functional components such as buttons, knobs, clasps, and openings make many other products candidates for anthropomorphism, including cell phones, lamps, handbags, printers, and chests of drawers. Depending on the placement of windows, doors, and sashes, some houses may seem to have a face. Even when a product's practical components do not configure in a way to suggest facial features, trim can be applied to make it appear more like a human face (e.g., Kim and McGill 2010). Prior research has suggested that faces automatically draw atten- tion, trigger strong emotions, and affect liking, making them a potentially fruitful target for design efforts. How- ever, currently, designers are afforded little guidance from consumer research about which features to use to communi- cate a desired emotional meaning and which combination of emotional shapes consumers prefer. In four empirical studies, we fill this gap in the literature by providing insights into the perceptual and evaluative effects of employing emotional shapes in the design of features corre- sponding to the human mouth and eyes, respectively. We obtain three central insights with both theoretical and prac- tical implications through these studies. First, when judging the meaning of the expression of a product conducive to anthropomorphizing, people use the same facial elements in the same combination that they do in judging human faces. That is, friendliness is primarily decoded from the mouth, whereas aggressiveness can be decoded from both the mouth and the eyes. At least for the mouth, the perception of these latent behavioral predisposi- tions is further enhanced when people show a tendency to process the product's "face" like a human face, which points to the notion that anthropomorphic design may tap deeply anchored perceptual principles of human face per- ception (Windhager et al. 2010). For marketing managers, this finding has important implications for the transforma- tion of the brand's inherent attributes into specific design features. For example, if one of a brand's core attributes is kindness and a company's cars should accordingly look friendly, this company is well advised to focus on the car's grille and give it an upturned shape. Critically, the designers should not waste time and resources attempting to design the shape of the car's headlights in a friendly way, though it is conceivable to imagine the temptation to do so in the absence of our findings. Second, the conflicting findings of Windhager et al. (2008), who find a preference for aggressive-looking cars, and Aggarwal and McGill (2007), who find a preference for smiling cars, can be reconciled by our present finding that it is not about either an aggressive or a friendly look per se but rather about the optimal combination of emotional shapes to convey friendliness and aggressiveness simultane- ously. In particular, we show that the mix of a friendly, upturned mouth and aggressive, slanted eyes is preferable to consumers and that this preference is due to potential to increase pleasure and arousal simultaneously. Our studies also extend the results of Aggarwal and McGill (2007), who confine their analysis to evaluating products that marketers had first presented in human terms. In our studies, we merely show that consumers anthropomorphize designs without any explicit request to interpret the design in human terms. Nevertheless, participants in our studies perceived the anthropomorphized designs and their emotional expres- sions consistently in human terms and judged them accord- ingly. From an applied point of view, this is an important extension of extant insights because it points to the generic applicability of the observed findings to the design of prod- ucts independently of any other marketing attempts to facil- itate anthropomorphism. Finally, we replicated the preference for products with a friendly mouth and aggressive eyes in a product category other than cars - cell phones - which attests to the robust- ness and generalizability of the current findings. According to the coherent results across these different product cate- gories, we would expect that the findings are generic and thus should also hold for other product categories con- ducive to anthropomorphizing, whose features potentially correspond to mouth and eyes. Furthermore, we find that 144 / Journal of Marketing, May 2011</page><page sequence="14">cars with such a combination of emotional expressions not only are better liked in our laboratory studies than either neutral or otherwise emotionalized designs but also sell bet- ter in the market, which strongly suggests that it is impor- tant for product designers to consider the emotional expres- sions of their product shapes carefully to increase their products' success. Our findings provide concrete guidance on how this can be achieved. With regard to further research, cultural differences regarding the perception of emotional expressions conveyed by a car's grill and headlights would be of interest. As we suggested in the "Theoretical Background and Hypotheses" section, particular differences are to be expected in Asian and collectivist cultures because the eyes represent a much more important source of information regarding the emo- tional feelings of other people in these cultures. An appro- priate cross-cultural study, most importantly including Asian cultures, would add to the understanding of anthropo- morphism in general and to limitations of the use of emo- tionalized shapes in particular. Furthermore, it would also be of interest to determine the extent to which the perceptions of these mixed emotions (aggressive headlights, friendly grille) remain constant over multiple exposures. Because customers generally scrutinize a vehicle and, therefore, its design intensively before pur- chasing, this is a highly relevant question, especially from a practical point of view. For example, it might be possible that one of the emotional expressions dominates the other after several exposures. An examination of various mea- surements taken at different times could provide informa- tive findings. Another question that needs answering pertains to other emotional expressions. In addition to friendliness and aggressiveness, the two dominating emotional expressions when designing vehicles, other emotional expressions that can be communicated through design elements should be taken into consideration. In this respect, it is important to find out which effects are produced by these emotional expressions and through which design elements they can be communicated. This would allow researchers to derive even more fine-tuned guidelines for the application of anthropo- morphized elements in product design. As the current research shows, anthropomorphized design elements are a promising avenue to optimize a product's appearance with respect to both consumers' liking and its ultimate success in the market.
