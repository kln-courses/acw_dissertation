<plain_text><page sequence="1">POLYIKONIC SCULPTURE FROM THE UPPER PALEOLITHIC SITE OF KOSTENKI I* E. E. FRADKIN (Translated by Richard G. Klein) The materials from the excavations of the Paleo- lithic site of Kostenki I became known to the archae- ological profession long ago. The monographs, arti- cles, and other publications dealing with Kostenki I comprise an extensive list containing dozens of items.1 The Kostenki I sculpted and incised depictions of animals and people enjoy particular fame. Many Soviet and foreign scholars have used these remark- able finds from Kostenki I in their discussions of the culture, ideology, and thought patterns of Upper Palaeolithic man. The first art object from Kostenki I - a sculpted depiction of a female torso - was found in 1915 by the well-known Polish archaeologist, Stefan Krukow- ski. However, Krukowski's account was not pub- lished and the find remained unknown for a long time. Therefore, even today, we do not know whether he recognized an art object in the small lump of marl he found with the stone tools. The first information about the sculpture and other finds of Krukowski was published by S. N. Zamyatnin (1922:4, 6-7, Figs. 1 - 3) in his work on the prehistory of the Voronezh region. The female torso from Kostenki I was the first Paleolithic sculpture found on the territory of the USSR. It represented the first piece in a large col- lection of sculpted and incised depictions of ani- mals and people obtained in the course of syste- matic excavations of Kostenki I. In 1923 and 1931- 36, these excavations were conducted under the direction of P. P. Efimenko (1958). In 1953, the collection of art objects from Kostenki I was further supplemented by A. N. Roga- chev (1957:27, Fig. 3). He found a new section of the cultural level and discovered in it the sculpture of a nude woman cut out of ivory. Translated from So vet sk aia Etnografiia, 1969, No. 1:135-142. *A detailed bibliography on Kostenki I is pre- sented in P. P. Efimenko1 s monograph Kostenki I (Moscow-Leningrad, 1958). With the exception of the finds made by Roga- chev, the art objects and artistic artifacts from Kostenki were studied by P. P. Efimenko who de- voted a series of publications to them. The most detailed characterization is contained in his mono- graph, where along with descriptions and drawings there are data on the distribution of the finds over the area of the site, and the field ciphers are repro- duced. In the 19 60 's the art objects from Kostenki I were reexamined in publications by Z. A. Abramova, devoted to problems of Paleolithic art. (Inter alia, see Z. A. Abramova 1966.) The art objects from Kostenki I are presently kept in the archaeological section of the Museum of Anthropology and Ethnography of the Academy of Sci- ences of the USSR (Leningrad). The basic part of the collection is accessioned under the No. 6223. As the inventory list accompanying collection 6223 shows, in addition to this collection there is a "re- serve," a supplement consisting of three groups of marl objects (marl comprises the raw material for the majority of art objects from Kostenki I.) The total number of marl lumps in the three groups is 65. 2 In the inventory list, the first group of marl lumps bears the name "indeterminate objects," the second group "lumps with traces of working," and the third "lumps without traces of working." In P. P. Efimenko 's monograph there are no descriptions, photographs, drawings or other materials bearing on the marl lumps. And this is fully understandable since Efimenko did not think that these included ac- tual art objects. However, it was just these marl lumps that be- came the object of our investigation. We found a whole series of sculpted depictions on more than 30 of them.3 2Museum Inventory of the Museum of Anthropol- ogy and Ethnography of the Academy of Sciences of the USSR, p. 27. 3Numbers are not present on the objects since they did not form a part of the basic collection. On 129 Arctic Anthropology VII-2, 1970</page><page sequence="2">130 Arctic Anthropology VH-2 The study of the material allowed us to recog- nize a phenomenon which was both unexpected and until now unknown for Upper Paleolithic art. While some stones bore just one depiction, others turned out to have two, three, or even more. We called them "polyikonic," coining this term from the Greek words poly meaning many and ikon meaning a depiction.4 In the present article we examine four stones with polyikonic depictions: (1) Three animal heads are depicted on a lump of grey marl of irregular form (4.8 x 3.8 x 3.0 cm). The first depiction is of the head of a beast with anthropomorphic features.5 An interesting feature of this sculpture is the fantastic combination of animal and anthropomorphic characteristics. The left profile (Fig. 1:3) recalls the snout of an anthropoid with depressed eyes and swollen eye- lids. The snout is vividly modelled by a play of light and shadow. When we turn the head around and examine it face on (Fig. 1:2), there appears before us the depiction of a camel or a sheep with slightly set-off forehead, soft nostrils, broad lower lip, and hair hanging on the neck. Continuing to turn the head to the left, we see the right profile of the sculpture (Fig. 1:1) with the bulging right eye, lo- cated lower than the left and giving the impression of weak eyesight. This sculpture gives us a very clear example of the clever use of the natural form of a stone and also of its surface. On the right side of the anthropoid snout, in the lower part of the broad, thick neck are visible deeply incised verti- cal grooves - a short one (slightly more than 1 cm long) and a longer one (almost 3 cm long). These deeply incised grooves, which are seemingly inex- plicable in the given depiction, become understand- able and even necessary if we turn the stone lump through an arc of 90° and look now at its lower part (Fig. 1:4). The neck of the beast with anthropomorphic fea- tures is then transformed into an extended muzzle, some of them there are field numbers, but these were unfortunately not carefully rendered and are not really suitable for citation.

V. Ivanov in the search for a term. labelling the depictions 1, 2, 3, etc. is con- sidered totally provisional, since we cannot deter- mine which of them was done first. It is also impos- sible to determine whether the makers of the depic- tions in each case had the intention of making one of them the main or basic one. recalling the snout of a boar, and the deeply in- cised lines create the relief of the form. The mouth of the beast is depicted by an obliquely incised line. The opposite side of the stone is not a sec- ond profile of the same animal, but turns out to be an independent depiction (Fig. 1:5) recalling a dog or a lion with clearly modeled meaty nose. (2) The second stone is a flat, irregularly shaped tablet of yellow marl with unworked reverse surface (3.0 x 3.5 x 1.0 cm). There are two depictions on it - a man and a lion, occurring as sculpted silhouettes with features of the face and snout emphasized. The human face is depicted in profile; the strongly extended nose seems to continue the line of the forehead (Fig. 2:1). The straight lips almost touch the nose. The small chin is set off by a thin incised line. The depiction is completed by an arc- shaped line recalling the headdresses of the Ameri- can Indians. Several striations on the depiction of the human head which appear at first glance to be accidental or superfluous attract attention. They include an ob- liquely incised line across the cheek, a vertical line passing from the forehead to the cheek, and short, parallel scratches on the neck (they are not visible on the drawing.) However, if we turn the marl tablet around on its axis by 180°, the lines become explic- able and give us a new (second) depiction. The line forming the chin and neck turns into the outline of the forehead and nose of the muzzle of a beast (Fig. 2:2). The incised line forming the mouth of the man now portrays the nose of a lion. The line expressing the human nose renders the lower lip of the beast, and the "superfluous" obliquely in- cised line across the cheek renders the beast's eye. The inexplicable vertical line passing from the fore- head to the cheek in the human depiction here gives the beast's cheekbone. And finally, the short parallel striations, "superfluous" on the human neck, turn into a schematic representation of the lion's hair. (3) Two depictions occur on a lump of grey marl of irregular forms (3.3 x 2.8 x 2.4 cm). One of them is the head of a lion (Fig. 3:1, 2, the right profile and the face), the second is the head of a bear (Fig. 3:3,4). The left eye of the lion is rendered by a deep hollow of irregular form, the right is less deeply in- cised and is shifted with respect to the left. The broad, thick nose, modelled on the end, is depicted as a whole in thickened form. The cheekbones are slightly modelled. The mouth, rendered by a deep, broad depression, produces the impression of being open. The ears are barely depicted by a bulging con- tour line. The chin, which is too sharp for the head of a lion, forces us to search for an explanation. And actually, when we turn the stone through an arc of al- most 180° we make out the second depiction - the head of a bear, where the chin of the lion is turned into the left ear of the bear (Fig. 3:4). The right ear of the bear apparently was never depicted; upon superficial examination of the stone, it is possible</page><page sequence="3">Fradkin: Polyikonic Sculpture from Kostenki I 131 Figure 1.

Having carefully examined the "fracture" we be- came convinced that there are no traces of working on it. Therefore, taking account of the fact that this is a natural fracture, the craftsman did not make any attempt to incise a second ear. The fore- head, eyes, and nose are modelled in a very gen- eralized way, but at the same time more fully than in the first depiction. This head is easily recog- nized as that of a bear with broad, bulging forehead and extended nose. The left profile is especially indicative (Fig. 3:4). (4) Several sculptures on a single lump of grey marl (2.8 x 1 .7 x 2.0 cm), with one exception, por- tray fantastic, unreal beings. Two large, round pro- truding eyes and a small nose or beak recall an owl or some kind of fantastic bird (Fig. 4:1-3). An abundance of details is expressed on the very small lump of marl. The swollen lids above the eyes make them still more expressive. In left profile there are distinctly visible arc- shaped, incised striations (Fig. 4:3) which are clearly too numerous for such a small head. Their placement beyond the possible limits of the head (it is necessary to understand that the contour of the head on the stone is not delimited by anything), in combination with an obliquely incised line and a protuberance of indeterminate form, point the way to the next depiction. Actually, only turning the stone slightly (Fig. 4:4), we see the profiled depiction of a completely fantastic being. Its eye is formed by the left eye of the bird, and an obliquely incised line renders its tightly compressed mouth. A "beard" under the blunt nose is rendered by vertical parallel lines. In that part of the stone where the "beard" is portrayed, the stone narrows sharply, and looking at this part while turning the stone downwards, we differentiated yet another depiction - the head of a dog or of a lion (Fig. 4:5, 6). The eye of the dog is less deeply incised, the forehead is modeled and separated from the muzzle. A shallow depres- sion expresses and models the cheek. The nose and nostrils are incised. Small striations distinctly and vividly portray hair (Fig. 4:6). It is necessary to note that the right profile of the dog's muzzle is much richer in detail than the left (Fig. 4:5). At the same time, since the whole head is rendered on a bevelled piece of stone, it does not portray any- thing when viewed face on. All the described stones had irregular form, which apparently prompted the creation of several artistic depictions on one lump of marl. The polyikonic depictions are far from straight forward. At first, when we found the new depictions in the reserve of the collection, we turned our at- tention to the "superfluous lines" and "superfluous spaces" present on almost half the depictions we found. This forced us to investigate stones more carefully in order to find an explanation for this phenomenon, to find regularities in it. However, the full absence of experience in the study of such phenomena forced us into a blind alley. In the ethnographic literature we have data on the damaging of depictions, including sculpted ones, in the process of carrying out various rituals. For ex- ample, in the past among a series of Siberian peo- ples, discontent with the conduct of a "spirit" evoked destruction or damage of its depiction. That is why, to begin with, we were inclined to see the "superfluous lines" as the results of "cruelty" to a sculpture. But how then to explain the "superfluous spaces?" Why were the "superfluous lines" and "superfluous spaces" found only on stones of ir- regular form? At the same time, the character of the incised "superfluous lines" showed that their crea- tion demanded a .great deal of time and effort, and their appearance could not be an accident. So it was necessary to reject the first explanation as un- sound. It was necessary to look for regularities of this phenomenon in the very character of the sculp- ture, in the laws of artistic creativity. We began to turn the stones around and to ex- amine the "superfluous lines" and "superfluous areas" from various points of view and at various distances under various kinds of lighting, mainly lighting from the side. For only side lighting can expose the comparatively low relief, which as we now know, is so characteristic of the Kostenki sculp- ture in general and of the polyikonic sculpture in particular. And at that point the "superfluous lines" and "superfluous areas" found their explanation. It is they which create the multiple depictions on one lump of stone. Thus, one of the main features of polyikonic sculpture is a keen sense for the ma- terial, the ability to visualize and to use all of a stone - its form and its surface. So a new world of artistic expression opened before us - expression unknown not only for the Upper Paleolithic, but also generally for the history of art among all peoples at all times. What accounts for the appearance of polyikon- ism? At the present time we can only speculate. Following many investigators we are inclined to consider that the sculpture, like all Upper Paleo- lithic art, was created mostly for utilitarian goals. The polyikonic depictions could best facilitate the achievement of these goals. With a stone bearing several depictions of men and beasts, the primitive hunter could more easily and simply render his knowledge, experience, or myths at the time of various ritual activities, in- cluding initiation rites. It is not accidental that stones of irregular form were selected for the cre- ation of polyikonic depictions. Such stones could in and of themselves bring polyikonism to mind, since their various spaces could be similar in nat- ural form to a beast, a man, or a bird. The business</page><page sequence="7">Fradkin: Polyikonic Sculpture from Kostenki I 135 Figure 4. A polyikonic sculpture with four depictions.

Besides this, a stone of irregular form was far easier to work. Polyikonism is so far known only in the ma- terials from Kostenki I, but it is possible to boldly assert that this phenomenon will be discovered also among the materials from other Upper Paleolithic sites, if they are examined according to the method we have suggested. Investigating the lumps of marl with depictions, it is possible to see that they are all strongly rounded. The question of the time of origin of the rounding naturally arises. We took this question to the petrographer G. M. Kovnurko. He kindly agreed to examine the stones in our collection. Kovnurko confirmed that nearly all the stones in our collection are marl, while a few of them are limestone. In nat- ural conditions, the marl occurs in the form of sharp- edged fragments with rather regular geometric shapes. The rounding of the lumps of stone in our series, in Kovnurko 's opinion, occurred prior to their falling into human hands. Such a conclusion wholly agrees with our observations. As we already noted, the artists who made the depictions, in a series of cases, used the natural surface of the stone, and even the rounding was purposefully included in the final product. We decided to check our observations with the help of a binocular microscope, using the methodol- ogy of S. A. Semenov. Examination of the stones under a binocular microscope could, besides this, help to determine the types and forms of the tools that were used by the sculptor. The latter subject was of considerable interest. At our request, S. A. Semenov and G. F. Korob- kova, a Research Associate in the Laboratory of Primitive Technology of the Paleolithic Sector of the Institute of Archaeology of the Academy of Sciences of the USSR (Leningrad Branch), examined about 30 stones at magnifications of 16 and 32 times. As we expected, all the lines and depressions on the sur- faces of the stones turned out to be of artificial origin. The ancient craftsmen of Kostenki I used burins, borers, and stone knives with edges of vari- ous widths. Investigation under a binocular micro- scope showed that, in a series of cases, a surface which appeared to us untouched or natural, in ac- tuality had traces of human handiwork (incisions and scratches) on it. Smoothing resulting from long stay in the soil and limey films do not always allow us to see this working with the naked eye. In the present article we limited ourselves to the characterization of only four stones because space limitations did not allow us to describe all the stones we investigated or even the remaining unique depictions. The discovery of a large series of sculpted de- pictions, including polyikonic ones, in the materials of Kostenki I, certainly demands reexamination of previously investigated art objects and checking to see if they have been correctly identified. Anew classification of the Kostenki I art objects is also necessary. In part this work has already been under- taken by us (Fradkin 1968). BIBLIOGRAPHY Abramo va, Z.
