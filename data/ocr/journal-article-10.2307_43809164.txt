<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE ANIMALS CAN REMEMBER': REPRESENTATIONS OF THE NON-HUMAN OTHER IN ALICE WALKER'S THE TEMPLE OF MY FAMILIAR Amanda Greenwood Department of English , University of Hull Abstract This article offers an ecofeminist reading of representations of non-human animals in Alice Walker's The Temple of My Familiar. It takes as its starting point Warren's definition of ecofeminism as a term that encompasses "a variety of multicultural perspectives on the nature of connections within social systems of domination . . . and the domination of non-human nature. (Warren 1994: 1). Walker's own identifica- tions of connections between 'social systems of domination' particularly of 'people of colour' and 'nonhuman nature' are examined within the context of Warren's definition and with reference to Walker's poetry collection Horses Make A Landscape Look More Beautiful and the essay 'Am I Blue?' The article then focuses on The Temple of My Familiar , arguing that throughout this deeply intertextual novel, Walker tran- scends stereotypical representations of women and people of color by choosing to celebrate the perception that they are "close to nature". Keywords: Walker, ecofeminism, Irigaray, myth, reincarnation, familiar, animals The Temple of My Familiar (1989), is a complex and deeply intertex- tual novel, connected to Walker's other works, The Color Purple (1983) and Possessing the Secret of Joy (1992). In this paper I want to explore the conceptualisation of the 'human' and 'non-human' in Walker's writing, in particular in The Temple of My Familiar and to consider how, through the personal and family histories of her many pro- tagonists, she offers revisions of patriarchal myth and discourses such as Darwinism and the story of Genesis. In undertaking this explo- ration, I will adopt a primarily ecofeminist perspective, drawing on the work of Karen Warren and Luce Irigaray. I begin, therefore, by offering Karen Warren's summary of 'ecofem- inism' as the most coherent working definition of the term which I have found to date. Warren (1994: 1) explains that: "Ecological feminism" is an umbrella term which captures a variety of multicultural perspectives on the nature of the connections within social systems of domination between those humans in subdominant or subordinate positions, particularly women, and the domination of nonhuman nature.

(Warren 1994: 1) Walker herself highlights throughout her poetry, fiction and pol- emical writings such connections between 'social systems of domi- nation' of 'people of color', particularly women, and 'nonhuman nature'. Her collection of poems Horses Make a Landscape Look More Beautiful was inspired by a move from Brooklyn to northern California which as Walker records enabled her 'for the first time [to] admit and express [her] grief over the ongoing assassination of the earth, even as [she] accepted all the parts, good and bad, of [her] own heritage' (Walker 1991: 311). As Walker reveals in the opening poem 'Dedication', this 'heritage' is not only Afro-American, but '"part" Cherokee' and 'white (Anglo-Irish-Scotch?)' from the great-great- grandfather who raped and impregnated Walker's great-great-grand- mother when she was eleven years old. In 'Dedication' Walker (1991 [1985], 312-313). attempts to reconcile these potentially warring aspects of her 'heritage': Rest. In peace in me the meaning of our lives is still unfolding 'Remember?', the second poem in the collection, begins to incor- porate animals into its redemptory message. The poem is prefaced by a quotation from Lame Deer addressed to 'the white man': 'For bringing us the horse we could almost forgive you for bringing us whiskey. Horses make a landscape look more beautiful' (1991: 315). Here the horse signifies as mediator in the attempted reconciliation of coloniser and colonised, its beauty 'almost' transcending the issue of domination. Yet Lame Deer's 'almost' is significant, undercutting the apparently simplistic message that redemption is attainable through 'beauty'. In her essay 'Am I Blue?' Walker addresses directly the difficulties inherent in constructing the horse as aesthetically pleasing</page><page sequence="3">1 66 AMANDA GREENWOOD 'other'. The eponymous 'Blue' appears initially as 'a beautiful part of [Walker's] landscape, very peaceful to look at through the win- dow, white against the grass' (Walker, 1988, 8). Recalling a friend's comment that the ' white horse' is 'the very image of freedom' Walker reflects that . the animals are forced to become for us merely "images" of what they once so beautifully expressed'. Analysing her encounter with Blue Walker writes: 'I was shocked that I had forgotten that human animals and nonhuman animals can communicate quite well'. Gretchen T. Legier (1997: 231) argues that: Walker connects this realisation about our notion that "beasts" can- not feel grief or happiness with similar notions about women not being able to think, about blacks being "naturally" lazy, about slavery being a "natural" institution . . . about oppression justified by "natural" fact. Legler's identification of Walker's alignment of women and Black people with animals highlights a problematic aspect of Temple , as we shall see - its potentially dangerous message that to be Black is some- how to be close to nature. Yet Walker's caveats against aestheticism extend to the Afro-American quest for 'roots'. A short poem from African Images (1991: 63) reads: A tall man Without clothes Beautiful Like a statue Up close His eyes Are running Sores In the context of Warren's identification of connections between 'social systems of domination' of 'people of color' and of 'non-human nature' Walker's perceptions of the dual sentimentalising of Africans and animals is significant. Walker is not, as Catherine Nash puts it in her discussion of Mahasweta Devi, falling back on tired concepts of women's 'natural, organic and intuitive closeness to nature' or of 'a native, childlike and racial closeness to nature' in people of colour (Nash 1993: 39). Rather Walker transcends stereotype whilst main- taining that humans have much to learn from non-human 'others'. This position is exemplified in Temple by a white woman's account of a visit to Africa, in which she reveals that she, unlike 'the natives',</page><page sequence="4">THE ANIMALS CAN REMEMBER 167 is unable to hear a 'little serpent' sing (1990: 239). This paper argues that whilst appearing to perpetrate Darwinist constructions Walker is actually subverting these in line with her own agenda. She cele- brates the perceived closeness to nature - and specifically to primates - of Black women in particular through revisions of Darwinian and Biblical discourses which, though incompatible in obvious respects, have each been used in the interests of patriarchy to construct women, animals and people of colour as inferior. In 'Am I Blue?' Walker (1991: 8) reveals the nihilism inherent in the construction of 'inferiors'. The horse, initially able to understand concepts of 'justice' and 'peace', is degraded by the enforced loss of his mate: ... in Blue's large brown eyes was a new look . . . the look of disgust with human beings, with life; the look of hatred. And it was odd what the look of hatred did. It gave him, for the first time, the look of a beast. 'Beast' is a term distinct from 'animal'; in The Temple of My Familiar, 'animal' suggests a being different from, but no less wise than, a human. The issue of the reduction of 'being' to 'beast' is addressed in The Temple of My Familiar through the story of Creighton, Miss Celie's dog. Celie and her friend and lover Shug first appear in Walker's earlier novel The Color Purple , which deals principally with issues of race and gender, touching only obliquely on non-human nature. Celie, freed from double jeopardy by her relationship with Shug and the realisation of her ability as a seamstress, is perceived by her granddaughter Fanny - one of the main protagonists of The Temple of My Familiar - as a 'gentle, loving person' who wholly transcends power dynamics and their attendant repercussions (Walker 1990: 344). Yet Fanny is disabused of this notion by her mother Olivia's recollection of Celie's ill-treatment of Creighton, to whom she shows 'a detached, brutal disregard'. Creighton is ultimately rescued by Shug, who 'liberate [s] him' by taking him away for a summer. When they return he is 'no longer a slave' but 'a dog' who bites Celie the next time she tries to beat him. Shug has transformed Creighton from a beast into a being, and Celie, thus humiliated, 'begfins] to feel for everything, ant, bat, the hoppy toad flattened on the road' (1990: 345). This episode reveals not only that no-one is immune</page><page sequence="5">1 68 AMANDA GREENWOOD from the dynamics of what Warren terms 'social systems of domi- nation', but that the animals at the bottom of the heap need some- one to speak for them. In The Temple of my Familiar Lissie is the character best qualified to undertake this responsibility since she has been a lion in a pre- vious incarnation. Lissie leaves a letter to be read after her death revealing that: The animals can remember; for, like sight, memory is renewed at every birth. But our language they will never speak; not from lack of intel- ligence, but from the different construction of their speaking appara- tus. In the world of man, someone must speak for them (Walker, 1 990 [1989], 226). In this context Legler's outline of Walker's concept of 'nature' is use- ful. Legier suggests that Walker wishes '"nature" [to] be conceived of as more than inert matter . . . that it have metaphorical status as a speaking, feeling, alive subject' (1997: 232). Indeed, whilst wholly endorsing Legler's viewpoint, I would like to argue further that Walker is calling for far more than 'metaphorical status.' The work of Irigaray - who has herself been identified as 'eco- feminisÅ¥ - provides helpful insights here. She argues significandy, that 'nature is not one ' (Whitford 1991: 95; Irigaray 1996: 36). Addressing the issue of constructions of woman and nature as 'other' Irigaray argues that in the current symbolic order man is 'the divine for the female animal realm' and that 'in wishing to be God man has lost the culture of his own body' (1996: 36). Although many versions of Dar- winism seek ostensibly to challenge concepts of 'the divine', Darwinism remains a part of western discourse and culture which constructs women, non-human nature and people of color as 'other', thus per- petuating the notion of the coloniser as somehow 'divine' and 'right'. Interestingly in the light of Walker's explorations of the 'being/beast' issue, Irigaray claims that because man has been interested only in gaining access to the divine, he 'has yet to attain human status' and is therefore by implication less of a being (1996: 36). Irigaray sug- gests that this situation can be remedied by 'start [ing] over' 'from the natural' with 'new values founded on natural reality' (1996: 37- 39). Though the concept of 'natural reality' is problematic Irigaray (1996: 41) goes on to explain that she is not simply perpetuating the man = culture/reason, woman = nature dichotomy; rather, she is seeking to deconstruct this through the creation of a new symbolic order. She argues that:</page><page sequence="6">THE ANIMALS CAN REMEMBER 169 It is a mistake ... to claim to be free and sovereign over nature. As I am only half the world, I am not free in the way this is generally conceived. I am free, on the other hand, and as I should be, to be what or who I am: one half of human kind. In that sense, and in that sense only, right - my right - is a function of respect for life. Similarly in her essay 'Everything Is A Human Being' Walker argues that 'nature' constructed as 'other' may exact revenge for mankind's tendency to homogenize, commenting that 'we are judged by our worst collective behaviour' (Walker 1988: 142). The title of this essay can be read as ironic; it is ostensibly modelled on Native American philosophy, but as well as highlighting the rights of trees and snakes to their being it suggests that humanity is capable of relating to nature only through anthropomorphism. In her essay 'Leisure: Celebration and Resistance in the Ecofeminist Quilt' Karen M. Fox suggests that in writing 'Blue' Walker is 'lead[ing] us into a political discussion about how we treat each other and ani- mals' (Fox 1997: 168). Again this suggests that Walker herself sees communication between human and non-human nature as more than the metaphorical concept identified by Legier. In her essay 'Frida: The Perfect Familiar' Walker comments on her experiences of writ- ing in the countryside, revealing that: A year or so after being there I reconnected with the world of ani- mals and spirits ... I had known and loved as a child. I became aware that there is a very thin membrane, human-adult-made, that separates us from this seemingly vanished world, where plants and animals still speak a language we humans understand . . . (Walker 1997: 124). Walker's heightened realisation of a lost common language led her to conclude that her cat Frida 'understood English'. Toril Moi (1994: 5) argues that when looking at the literary and autobiographical texts of a single author 'the point is not to treat one text as the implicit meaning of another, but rather to read them all with and against each other to bring out their points of tension, contradiction and similarities'. In this context, it is significant that the non-fictional 'Frida: The Perfect Familiar' and the fictional The Temple of My Familiar both reinforce Walker's idea of the status of animals by using the term 'familiar' rather than the somewhat degrad- ing 'pet'. In 'Frida' Walker reveals that while she was writing The Temple of My Familiar '. . . the land I lived on became the home of more and more animals, who, I sometimes joked . . . had somehow gotten word that this was going to be a breakthrough book' (1997: 124).</page><page sequence="7">170 AMANDA GREENWOOD I will now move on to develop this discussion of The Temple of My Familiar as a 'breakthrough book' in terms of Walker's exposition of a 'seemingly vanished world' and of the possibilities offered for re- claiming a language common to human and non-human nature. The Temple of My Familiar As I pointed out in the introduction, the narrative structure of Temple is deeply complex. In terms of language, though, one of the most important narrative threads is the story of 'Lady [Eleandra] Peacock'. This story is narrated by the lady's great-great niece, Mary Jane, who reads and relates Eleandra's journal. The journal has been writ- ten within the contexts of nineteenth century colonialism and Dar- winism, and it reveals Eleandra's discovery of an African woman, M'Sukta, living in a reconstructed African village in a museum. M'Sukta's situation is significant in the context of Fox's ecofeminist analysis of leisure (mentioned in relation to 'Am I Blue'). Fox points out that: 'Historically, both work and leisure have been described in terms of "virtue" and "goodness" which were associated with a rul- ing class or government' (1997: 157). M'Sukta is commodified in the interests of the 'improving' leisure activities of the coloniser. This constitutes an inversion of what Fox identifies as the ecofeminist leisure principle; Fox argues that leisure 'provides a context for or connection with the natural environment for women, and may pro- vide one more avenue for resisting domination and sustaining cul- tural traditions vital to the survival of nature, women, and other groups' (1997: 160). M'Sukta's 'cultural traditions' are sustained arti- ficially and in isolation from 'the natural environment'. Her boy com- panion has died and she is kept on as an exhibit, watched 'round the clock, just as though she were a sick elephant' (1990: 251). Sensing M'Sukta's fear, Eleandra reflects that: 'Animals in zoos were afraid of me as simply another human being come to stare at them but this was different, somehow. If she was afraid of me, then it was definitely my whole existence that was "wrong" . . .' (1990: 250). With this awareness Eleandra herself becomes fearful: ' "Where does she really live?" I was frantic for an answer now, feeling my whole being, further back than I could remember, involved'. Eleandra is initially unable to communicate with M'Sukta; she recalls that 'The languages I knew failed me entirely when I saw</page><page sequence="8">THE ANIMALS CAN REMEMBER 171 her' (1990: 254). But 'years later' the two women are able 'haltingly' to converse. M'Sukta reveals that 'her '"words are all that kept me going'" and that '"they were truly my ancestors' gift to me"' (1990: 256). Significantly M'Sukta observes that white westerners are 'most afraid of what they have been' (1990: 257). This highlights once again the extent to which whites are perceived as having detached themselves from nature. Eleandra, defined by race and class rather than by gender, is initially aligned with white male colonisers rather than with the African woman M'Sukta. But Eleandra's growing realisation of her connection to M'Sukta - and this is highly significant in the context of nineteenth century Darwinism - leads her to a hatred of her own society and specifically of its women. Deciding that she does not want to follow her des- tiny as 'a lady', Eleandra reflects that '. . . there was something so artificial about ladyness, something so separate from others and from the world. The ladies one saw . . . tripped ahead on the pavement in their tight shoes, their large feathered hats floating above them. And they looked at themselves in shop windows and admired them- selves' (1990: 254). A connection with feathers is highlighted. In the light of Eleandra's later life - she 'goes native' and marries an Arab - it seems ironic that she is dubbed 'Elly Burnham Peacock'. Her niece recalls seeing her 'going by in a carriage with her dress all pea- cockish greens and blacks and purples and blues . . .' and thinking that she ' was a peacock [my emphasis]' (1990: 236). Yet the name is perhaps more redemptive than ironic, suggesting that Eleandra's communications with M'Sukta and alliance with a non-white man have helped to reestablish the connection with the natural world which was lost to the perpetrators of nineteenth century colonialism. Furthermore Eleandra has become true to M'Sukta's words for 'human beings', which translate as 'those alone on earth who think of what is just'. M'Sukta's words for 'just' translate as 'two hands holding equal amounts of grain' (1990: 256). In M'Sukta's language a sense of justice is the only factor which privileges human over non-human nature and this along with the connection of human and non-human nature is seen to have been lost. But Walker goes fur- ther in 'speaking for' the animals. M'Sukta's story clearly reveals that concepts of 'justice' are by no means exclusive to the coloniser, but Temple also challenges the exclusivity of 'justice' to humanity as a whole. (In this the novel echoes 'Am I Blue' in which Walker attrib- utes understanding of 'truth' and 'justice' to the horse).</page><page sequence="9">172 AMANDA GREENWOOD Walker's character Lissie, whose words I used to open this paper, remembers an incarnation in which she was a pygmy girl whose tribe interacted with chimpanzees. It is significant that this is one of Lissie's happiest incarnations. In photographs of Lissie taken during the narrative present, shades of previous incarnations show through. This is interesting in the context of the connection between sight and memory made by Lissie when she claims that 'like sight, mem- ory is renewed at every birth' (1990: 226). The photograph which 'remembers' Lissie's incarnation as a pygmy is 'the happiest-looking of all the pictures', revealing a 'squat, tiny' figure 'with a waist like a wasp's, her hair in woolly ringlets, her eyes bright and laughing' (1990: 109-110). Lissie remembers how she 'stayed with the cousins and hung out in their trees' (1990: 109). The 'cousins' referred to throughout this account are chimpanzees. The affectionate use of the familial term highlights Walker's revision of Darwinian discourse; the relation between human beings and chimpanzees is one founded on mutual cooperation and respect rather than simply on evolutionary connection. The chimpanzees are rep- resented as a 'serene' tribe who generate 'safety around their trees' and who help 'clumsy' humans to dig up roots. The girl narrator recalls having spent 'a lot of time with the cousins' because her own mother was often angry. The 'cousins' like other animals are per- ceived as exemplary child-carers; when the narrator has a baby of her own she runs away 'to stay with the cousins, who in most things took a decidedly more progressive attitude than [her] parents' (1990: 102). Non-pygmy humans - 'the giant cousins' - are represented as a threat and eventually effect the breaking away of pygmies from chimpanzees by forcing them to respond to attack with poison arrows, 'blowguns and slingshots' (1990: 103). The narrator charts the sub- sequent development of human society: . . . my mate and I never forgot what we learned from the cousins. We brought up our children to be as much like them as possible . . . It was this way of living that gradually took hold in all the groups of people living in the forest . . . until the idea of ownership - which grew out of the way the forest now began to be viewed as something cut into pieces that belonged to this tribe or that - came into human arrangements (1990: 103-104). The narrator goes on to link the desire to accumulate property with the development of the nuclear family and with patriarchal domi- nation of women. It is significant that conflict is linked to 'the idea</page><page sequence="10">THE ANIMALS CAN REMEMBER 173 of ownership - which grew out of the way the forest now began to be viewed as something cut into pieces that belonged to this tribe or that . . .' (1990: 104). Indeed, it is possible to trace here another link between Walker and Irigaray, who attributes slavery to the Tact' that 'society is con- trolled by money' (Irigaray 1996: 49). Irigaray argues that 'the sys- tem of production in which we live': . . . creates a society without any freedom, with sudden aggressive out- bursts from individuals, groups, or nations. Everyone wants to assert that their subjectivity, their resources, their culture, or their power per- mits them to make a special case for themselves amidst the general state of dependence and interdependence. For a while, they becomc the focus of attention; sub-systems are organized in a different way but fundamentally things remain the same (1996: 49-50). Irigaray goes on to link the accumulation of property with the dom- ination of nature. In the context of Walker's positive representations of tribal cultures it is worth noting Irigaray's argument that: 'Exogamy requires that one leave one's family, tribe, or clan, in order to make alliances' and that ultimately 'the society we know, our own culture, is based upon the exhange of women' (Irigaray 1985: 170-172). Irigaray points out that: 'Without the exchange of women, we are told, we would fall back into the anarchy (?) of the natural world, the randomness (?) of the animal kingdom' (1985: 170). Both Walker and Irigaray hint strongly that this kind of 'anarchy' and 'random- ness' may have something to recommend it. Certainly in The Temple of My Familiar Lissie's memories of the chimpanzees lead her to reflect that this is the only 'peaceful' incar- nation she has ever known. Significantly, though, she terms this incar- nation a 'dream memory', introducing the possibility that her account may not be 'real'. This is interesting in the light of Jim Cheney's argument that the best means of realising 'an appropriate ecofemi- nist philosophical notion of difference' which 'extends the feminist notion of difference so as to include nonhuman nature itself in a "power-charged social relation of 'conversation'" is through story- telling. Cheney proposes that: The tales we tell of our, and of our communities', "storied residence" in place are tales not of universal truth but of local truth, bioregional truth, or ethical vernacular (Cheney 1997: 4).</page><page sequence="11">174 AMANDA GREENWOOD Lissie argues that '. . . the memory, like the mind, has the capac- ity to dream, and just as the memory exists at a deeper level of con- sciousness than thinking, so the dream world of the memory is at a deeper level still' (99). This concept of 'memory' allows Walker to experiment not only with the 'memories' of her human and non- human characters, but with cultural 'memory', the importance of which is exemplified by M'Sukta's tragic transposition to the museum. Lissie's remembered reincarnations encompass revisions not only of Darwinism but of creation myths, particularly as exemplified by .Genesis. Like Darwin Lissie identifies Genesis as 'myth', but unlike the projected 'naturalist' of the Zoologici Journal of 1924 she does not see 'Man' as 'pre-eminent in the dominion of his reason' (Vol. 1, 1824, vii). Lissie argues that a human couple founding their own tribe, as they do in her 'dream memory', is: . . . also the fantasy on which the Old Testament rests . . . but with- out any mention of our intimacy with the other animals or of the brown and black colours of the rest of my folks (1990: 401). In this context it is significant that Jim Cheney identifies the difference between Christianity and religions such as those of the American Indians - whose creation myths Walker partially borrows - as that '. . . the American Indians did not regard their religions as exportable. That is, they are not instruments of colonisation, but, rather, expres- sive of defining relationships between people and place' (Cheney 1997: 166). Whilst undoubtedly advocating respect for 'place' Walker, unlike Cheney, does not seem to see 'universal' and 'bioregional' truths as incompatible. Through her own 'storytelling' she promotes the ideal of 'residence' rights for all. In the 'chimpanzee' episode of The Temple of My Familiar there is cooperation among human and non-human animals; the narrator reveals that 'we shared the tree with other creatures, who, in raucous or stealthy fashion - there was a python, for instance - looked after us' (1990: 100). In this episode Walker redeems through 'storytelling' the incident which she recalls in 'Everything Is a Human Being' in which she kills a 'small, no doubt bewildered and disoriented' snake largely as a result of Christian patriarchal conditioning: Everything I was ever taught about snakes - that they are dangerous, frightful, repulsive, sinister - went into the murder of this snake person, who was, after all, only trying to remain in his or her home ... I knew at once that killing the snake was not the first act that should</page><page sequence="12">THE ANIMALS CAN REMEMBER 175 have occurred in my new garden, and I grieved that I had apparently learned nothing, as a human being, since the days of Adam and Eve (Walker 1988: 143). Walker goes on to confess that after the event 'the little snake I [she] killed was always with [her]'. In The Temple of My Familiar cooperation between species is envi- sioned through the 'tree of life' metaphor which replaces the patri- archal concept of the Garden of Eden. In the context of an ecofeminist reading of The Temple of My Familiar and specifically of Fox's iden- tification of the centrality to ecofeminism of women's leisure it is significant that the tree of life figures in a painting by Lissie. Through painting Lissie is able not only to reconcile her many disparate incar- nations - an achievement which echoes Walker's expressed aims in the poem 'Dedication' - but to 'provide a context for or connection with [her] natural environment' (Fox 1997: 160). Lissie concludes her narrative by revealing a further 'dream mem- ory', one which she admits to having 'repressed for all I am worth. Regardless, it is still with me because, like other memories, it is me' (1990: 392). This particular 'dream memory' has been 'repressed' because it reveals Lissie as having been the first white man. The narrative revises the Bible; Lissie comments that: In the Bible I know there's a line somewhere about a time in the future when the earth will be at peace and the lion will lie down with the lamb. Well, that has already happened, and eventually it was to the detriment of the lion (1990: 393). Lissie goes on to reveal that: In the days of which I am speaking, people met other animals in much the same way people meet each other today. You were sharing the same neighbourhood, after all. You used the same water, you ate the same foods ... I think my mother and her familiar had known each other since childhood . . . But although women have familiars, 'in the men's group or tribe there was no such thing'. The narrator's mother's familar is a lion called Husa, who is represented as 'strong and also gentle'. Lissie later argues that in patriarchal mythology such as the story of Daniel 'no one understood what was happening from the lion's point of view' and that Daniel actually 'had a perfectly safe and comfy night's sleep, with his head resting on one of [the lion's] sides' (1990: 405). In The Temple of My Familiar Husa's family visit the human tribe,</page><page sequence="13">176 AMANDA GREENWOOD sharing the evening fire, helping with childcare and joining in expe- ditions for food. The narrator reflects: 'I wish the world today could see our world as it was then. It would see the whole tribe of cre- ation climbing an enormous plum tree' (1990: 395). In Lissie's pre- patriarchal society men and women live in separate tribes, visiting each other along with the women's familiars. But this idyllic status quo is destroyed by the narrator who, ashamed of his own whiteness and feeling like 'a ghost', establishes his identity by killing his woman's familiar and founding the first nuclear family (1990: 399-400). The theme of patriarchal destruction of women's autonomy and familars is continued in Lissie's account of her incarnation as a lion. In this incarnation the lion, like Husa, lives alongside a young woman and her children, but is driven away by men and their dogs. The narrator reveals: I think I knew we were experiencing one of the great changes in the structure of earth's life, and it made me very sorrowful . . . Soon we would . . . Forget [woman's] language ... All of this friendship would be lost, and she, poor thing, would be left with just man, screaming for his dinner and forever murdering her friends . . . (1990: 403). The repercussions of patriarchy are exemplified by Lissie's account of a visit to the zoo with her friend Rafe during her current incar- nation, by which time 'colored could go even to the [zoo] in Baltimore' (408). Lissie takes a large mirror hoping to give the lions a sense of identity, but the results are not encouraging: One or two of them saw something. But it only made them sad. They slunk back to a corner of their cages and put their heads down between their paws . . . Rafe carried me back home, a pitiful wreck . . . and put me to bed (1990: 408-409). Walker's alignment of women and animals is, like her affirmation of perceptions of Black people being 'closer to nature', as I have already suggested, potentially dangerous. It is hardly necessary to reiterate the problematics of the naturalisation of women; as Karen Warren puts it, 'we exploit nature and animals by associating them with women's lesser status, and, conversely, dominate women by associ- ating women with nature's and animal's inferior status' (Warren, 1997: 190). But I wish to argue ultimately that Walker's alignment of women and nature is celebratory , and that her agenda is to rec- oncile 'others'.</page><page sequence="14">THE ANIMALS CAN REMEMBER 177 The Temple of My Familiar concludes with the posthumous revela- tion of Lissie's last paintings by Suwelo, the character who holds all the strands of the narrative together. Suwelo looks at: 'The one of what he has come to think of as the tree of life . . . and the last one in a series of five that she did of lions' (1990: 456). The 'tree of life' painting 'includes 'the little white fellow' in its branches', hinting at the possibility of redemption for patriarchy and the destruction of familiars. It is interesting that this painting reminds Suwelo of a Rousseau; once again Walker is revising patriarchal representation of nature (1990: 457). The 'other painting, of the great maned lion' causes frustration to Lissie's partially sighted friend, Mr Hal, who though he has been told that Lissie put herself into every painting can only see 'a reddish spot'. But Suwelo: . . . looks straight into Lissie's dare-to-be-everything lion eyes. He knows, and she knows, that Mr Hal will be able to see all of her some day . . . and in the meantime . . . can while away the time contemplating the 'reddish spot' which marks the return of Mr Hal's lost vision. For on Lissie's left back paw, nearly obscured by her tawny, luxuriant tail, is a very gay, elegant, and shiny red high-heeled slipper (1990: 457). Hal's blindness serves a dual purpose. Like Mr Rochester's it signifies patriarchal failure of vision; it also reiterates the interconnectedness of 'sight' and 'memory'. Walker's redemptive ending suggests that 'vision' such as Lissie's can be recovered through what Cheney terms 'storied residence in place' and that humans, as well as animals can, with prompting, 'remember'.
