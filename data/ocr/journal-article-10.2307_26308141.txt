<plain_text><page sequence="1">EURIPIDES' USE OF MYTH Robert Eisner Competition in chess problems is not really between White and Black but between the composer and the hypothetical solver (just as in a first-rate work of fiction the real clash is not between the characters but between the author and the world).... Vladimir Nabokov1 What distinguishes Euripides' treatment of the mythical material he inherited is not any special technique of direct narrative, but a sometimes abstruse, sometimes shocking juxtaposition of the world of myth with a more everyday "reality." Euripides' approach to myth was more private and varied than Aeschylus' and Sophocles', but still acceptable to those of the audience who perceived what Euripides was doing with the stories they had always known. This essay will focus on the most elaborate, fantastic parts of the mythic world in Euripides' plays - the choruses - and on the most adrupt shifts from fantasy to reality, especially in the Hippolytus, Electra, Heracles and Helen. Nearly every critic and literary historian concerned admits that Euripides is different. Aristophanes provides good evidence that Euripides' contemporaries often thought the same, though this judg ment was partly a prejudice based on certain eccentricities of his life that irritated the demos.2 But my concern is with Euripides' work, not his life: primarily with discovering how he built his plays, and then with why he built them that way. Since my premise is that Euripides is different, we must briefly look at the methods of his predecessors to see what he differs from. The main literary tradition, and the only tragédie tradition, was mythological.® This tradition extended even into areas that at first do not seem friendly to fantasy: the myths appear as "ancient history" in Herodotus and Thucydides, and have left a mark on the very form that some of Herodotus' narratives take (the Gyges and Candaules episode, the childhood of Cyrus).4 I have elsewhere discussed the Greek predilection for myth in terms of a native tendency towards the 153 Arethusa Vol. 12 (1979) 2.</page><page sequence="2">154 Robert Eisner typical and ideal as opposed to our fictional tradition of the particular and "real."5 A few additional comments are necessary: The Greek tragic idea seems to have had its roots in the desire to find some principle by which the catastrophic CnffûPÏnrT aKcqptjO Kl A in hViû πτηρΐ ri min-Vif chaotic, haphazard and senseless, but as a part of an intelligible order .... It is difficult to attach ideas on the nature of the universe, and on the meaning of suffering and evil, to the particular and contingent happenings of everyday life .... How much more universality the poet's tragic view achieves when it is demonstrated not in situ ations made especially for the purpose but in famous paradigms of human suffering which have already acquired a certain archetypal status!6 Aside from the main, mythical plot of the play or poem, there were also allusions to other comparable or contrasting myths. The most famous example of the use of such allusions is in the Odyssey, where the references to Agamemnon and Clytemnestra form a counter plot to the return of Odysseus, reverberating the main themes of the poem.7 The common body of myths, then, formed a code for the writer. I define "code" as a system of signs capable of carrying information. "Code" in this use is a medium of communication and occasionally of secrecy, though we who have no such code may more than occasion ally feel left out.8 The essence of the mythic code is, as with simile and metaphor, comparison and contrast. The poet relates the common experience of his audience to the typical experience of the mythologi cai cnaracters; ana ne encourages comparison οι one mytn to anotner, to amplify the meaning of his chosen myth. I add the term "code" to "mythology" in order to emphasize both the conscious infusion of meaning by the dramatist into relatively neutral myths and mythical allusions and the task of exegesis that the audience or readers is then faced with. The signs of the code by themselves are relatively in significant; it is the dramatist's use of them that charges them with meaning, although he must pay due attention to the dregs of meaning his allusions carry with them from their old contexts. Often there is some moral point to the comparison.9 The mythical plots and the allusiveness were the dramatists' raw material. In the epics emphasis fell on narrative, plot, the plain</page><page sequence="3">Euripides'Use of Myth 155 events, rather than on explanations of those events.10 In tragedy, made from the received material of the epics, the emphasis almost invariably fell on something other than the plot (despite Aristotle's pronounce ments). It has been pointed out often enough that what interests Sophocles in Oedipus the King is not really the plot - though he has taken a certain obvious pride in its construction - but the character of the hero.11 Sophocles did not write a play about fate, but one about what sort of a man would unknowingly, but characteristically, fit the T~\ _ 1 — l 3 I 3 _ J olbUd LlUli pi CUIblGU uy une υιαυισ α,υ 1S\^±±J ιι± auu uuiiu^vx uutyu v\j fiiw playwright by tradition, and who then would insist, with dawning con sciousness, on discovering the truth. Sophocles repeats this pattern throughout his work: a portrait of the will of the lone tragic hero battling with the forces of the universe.12 Aeschylus is preoccupied with something beyond character or plot. The real subject of an Aeschylean tragedy, as C. J. Herington is fond of pointing out, is not on stage at all.15 The events on stage are symptoms of the evolving doom of gods and men off in the cosmos. In this way Aeschylus and Sophocles each presented a single view of tragic suffering, a single dramatic form," and a single use of myth. This is not to say of Aeschylus or Sophocles, as has fairly been said of P. G. Woodhouse, that if you've read one you've read them all. Their formulae are not that static. My generalizations do not sum up all their work. But one can come to understand the technique of each in one or two plays and comfortably transfer that understanding to the other plays.15 Vi η !»Λ V\/\ Α(η τττίιττ f Uî case with Euripides. A common explanation is that Euripides was forced by tradition to use the myths, though he did not want to, and so he tried various ways of escaping from the tradition. But the perplexity of the modern reader is due as well to the contradictions resulting from the conventions which compelled Euripides to express himself in terms of tradi tional mythology, though it was fast losing its signifi cance. In consequence form and content are often at variance with each other; what the poet has to say may be inconsistent with the implications of the legend he is dramatizing.16</page><page sequence="4">156 Robert Eisner The humanization of myth ... proves to us that the in herited myth is increasingly rejected as unnatural.17 Euripides did the best he could - quite well, in fact - under the circumstances. This kind of discussion often winds up contrasting Euripides' view of "reality" with the world of the myths: ... il ne s'agit pas tant d'interpréter les données de la mythologie par des tragédies que d'écrire des tragédies sur la réalité humaine telle qu'il la conçoit en restant en deçà des limites que la matière mythologique lui procure...." And this leads to the argument over Euripides' piety or impiety. If, at heart, he rejected the matter of the myths, did he also reject the traditional religious beliefs that the myths circumscribed? Or, since the essence of religion is in ritual, not in myth, should we con clude that in his daily life Euripides was probably as religious as anyone else?19 D. J. Conacher does the best job of justifying Euripides' attitude and explaining away the puzzlement of the modern reader. Euripides did not fully accept the world of the traditional material; he used a variety of methods to work this material for his own ends; "and this very virtuosity has sometimes been mistaken for confusion and uncertainty on the poet's part."20 The problem is simply literary, not one of literary biography or speculation on Euripides' actual participation in rituals. As a literary problem it is first one of construction, form, and pattern, then one of interpretation. In rereading through the works of Euripides one is im pressed not only by his artistic virtuosity, but by his artistic play fulness. We must extrapolate from what we know of the working methods of writers to conclude that Euripides could not have felt as con strained by the tradition as has been suggested and still have written some ninety-two plays, five or six of them great. He may have felt limited by the mythic mode, but he played with those limitations. One's impression is that before writing each play Euripides set him self a new problem to solve, that the act of composition for him was very much a working out of the solution to this problem, and that both the problem and the solution were - uniquely for the age - private artistic matters, not necessarily clear to the original audience,</page><page sequence="5">Euripides'Use of Myth 157 who were kept very happy by other, more easily perceived aspects of virtuosity - rhetoric, characterization of the pathological state of mind, music, and the very tragicness of the horrible deeds he some times portrayed.21 However different his approach might be in each play, the basis of each problem is always the relationship between the world of accepted mythology and the everyday "reality" of his audience. This inevitably means, if I am right, that Euripides saw his function as more purely aesthetic and less didactic (or counter HiHanfip^ than Hiri Apsphvlns anH Snnhnnlps 22 I am suggesting that much of what goes on in a play of Euripides is a private game of the author, though not as abstruse as those games Verrall claimed Euripides was playing. It may have been Verrall's elaborations that led Waldock to insist that one of the rules of inter preting drama is that because of the popular form of the art, "drama tists do not tuck away meanings."23 But the form was meant to be read as well as witnessed, perhaps especially so meant by someone like the bookish Euripides.24 If the Hellenistic poets could tuck away meanings from their age, why could Euripides not be ahead of his time as we think: the allusions found in a typical play of Sophocles can put quite a strain on the cleverness of the audience. In Philoctetes, 986-90, Philoctetes prays to the Hephaestus crafted brilliance of the sun (the volcano of Lemnos). Odysseus, his enemy, tells him to forget about Hephaestus, that Zeus is god here. The reader or careful listener may think of the argument that Zeus and Hephaestus had. Zeus threw Hephaestus out of heaven because he sided with Hera in her attack on Heracles. Hephaestus landed on Lemnos, the site of Philoctetes' present abandonment. Hephaestus is more than the god of Philoctetes' island. He is a cripple with a limp like Philoctetes', an outcast like Philoctetes, whom the Olympians had to beg to return when they needed him to release Hera, as the Greeks are now seeking the help of Philoctetes. The cause of the original dispute in the gods' fight, Heracles, is the deus ex machina in Philoctetes' dispute with the Greeks. With such elaborate allusions as this found in the "standard" tragedian, let us not out of hand reject tucked awav meanings.25 It may be that our sympathy with Euripides' eccentricity has been influenced by the eccentric tendencies in modern literature.26 Private games have become the signature of the serious writer of fiction: Nabokon in Ada and Look at the Harlequins, Raymond Queneau</page><page sequence="6">158 Robert Eisner in Exercices du style, Italo Calvino in Cosmicomics, Flann O'Brien in At Swim Two Birds, Julio Cortâzar in Hopscotch, Donald Barthelme in his many New Yorker pieces, and of course Alain Robbe-Grillet. That such private games can achieve widespread popularity has been proved by Gabriel Garcia Marquez in Latin America and, to extend the examples beyond the printed word, by Fellini all over the world and occasionally by Antonioni (in "Blow-Up," made from a Cortâzar OUVJLL iDljKJLyj. I suggest that some of Euripides' technique (and therefore meaning) is of the tucked away sort. Before focusing on what was unusual in his technique, we should see some of the methods he had in common with Aeschylus and Sophocles. The juxtaposition of worlds is what distinguishes Euripides, but he made some standard use of literary allusions. The allusions are of two sorts: to other myths that by comparison or contrast can expand on the myth being dramatized, and to other stages of the same myth — what happened before the play opens or will happen after the play ends. Both sorts of allusions add resonance to the segment being dramatized. Both sorts of allusions are more common in the other two tragedians than in Euripides, but an examination of their appearance in Euripides can illustrate what was a common technique with common property. Allusions to Other Myths: Iphigenia in Tauris 392-406. The Chorus may be comparing the wanderings of the Greeks to the Tauric Chersonese to the wanderings of Io. (The text is corrupt.) By implication they may also be comparing Io to Iphigenia and Hera to Artemis, in suffering and in cruelty. Helen 375-83. Helen says that Callisto, changed into a bear, was happy compared to her mother Leda: hos polu matros emas elakhes pleon (377). And Callisto the bear did no harm compared to Helen, whose beauty destroyed Troy and the Achaeans. Again the cruelty of the gods is part of the point. Orestes 588-91. Orestes contrasts Odysseus, Telemachus, and Penelope to Agamemnon, himself, and Clytemnestra. Euripides is here picking up the paradigmatic allusion of the Odyssey. Medea 1282-92. The Chorus compares Medea's murder of her children to Ino's murder of hers. The focus of the comparison is</page><page sequence="7">Euripides' Use of Myth 159 Hera's crime in driving Ino crazy (maneisan ek theôn) (1284) as op posed to Medea's crime in motivating her own crime. Later we learn Medea will bring the children to Hera's temple (1379). Euripides has chosen the Ino paradigm because Hera enters into Medea's crime. Medea acts like a goddess, with the gods' tacit approval, especially the approval of the goddess of marriage and childbirth, who herself once made a mother kill her children.27 Hippolytus 453-67. The nurse is arguing the ineluctable power of love to Phaedra. Zeus loved Semele (453-54). Dawn ravished Cephalus off to the gods' company (455). Yet all these dwell in heaven (45b-5/,). So too should you submit to love (459 ft'.). Her point is that Phaedra should not try to be better than the gods and heroes of the past. (But, since both Semele and Cephalus ended unhappily, Euripides implies that Phaedra will end unhappily if she too submits.) Hippolytus 545-64. The Chorus is singing of the dangers of love. As types of love connected with death they mention Iole, whose wooing by Heracles caused the death of her brother and father (545-54). And they mention Semele (whose love for Zeus eventually led to her death) (555-64). Cyclops. William Arrowsmith thinks the Cyclops was performed with the Hecuba, probably in 425. He suggests that the blinding of Polymnestor in the other, and that Polyphemus' final appearance from the cave reflects Polvmnestor's emergence from the tent. The nnint nf the comparison is civilized brutality and barbaric vengeance upon a barbarian who violated xenia. Arrowsmith suggests there is also a parallel in the portrayal of Odysseus in the two plays. With delightful irony Euripides forces the man who denied Hecuba mercy to plead for mercy himself." This kind of parallelism between satyr plays and preceding tragedies is likely to have been common. There are not many more such allusions to other myths in Euripides' work. Sophocles and Aeschylus made far more, and usually their allusions are in some way didactic, as are most allusions in Greek literature. At least half of Euripides' are counter-didactic or critical of the gods. Euripides was not so interested in adding the mythical reso nance of other myths to his chosen myths nor in making his little world on stage a part of the larger mythical world. A. J. Podlecki has made the incisive suggestion that, when a character in a play makes</page><page sequence="8">160 Robert Eisner an allusion to some other common myth, he is not only relating the mythical play to the larger world of saga, but also to the daily life of the audience.29 "I'm as bad off as Callisto" (cf. Helen 375) is pre cisely the sort of lament an ancient Greek might have made to his friends and relatives. That Euripides did not use many such outside allusions indicates that he linked the mythic world with the reality of the audience by quite different means. Today the lament would be "If things get any worse I'm going to pull a Mary-Hartman," i.e., check into the looney bin, as the soap opera heroine did. The world of soap operas and situation comedies has a number of parallels with the world of myth. It has now achieved a large enough reality that characters can safely cross over from show to show. Mary Tyler Moore appears on "Rhoda," Rhoda and Phyllis on "Mary Tyler Moore." Cross-references can be made by characters of one show to characters and events on another. And the networks can feel as secure as Greek dramatists that the audience will get all of this.30 Allusions to other stages of the same myth under dramatization are also rather uncommon, compared to the practice of Aeschylus or Sophocles. Such allusions often occur in a prologue. In the prologue to the Orestes Electra carefully summarizes the problems of the house: 5-10, Tantalus and his punishment (see also 351); Pelops (see also 972); 13-15, Atreus and Thyestes and the cannibal feast; in 17 ff. she carries the genealogy up to herself and the murder of Agamemnon and the collapse of Orestes. Iphigenia in Aulis 697-712. In dialogue between Agamemnon and Clytemnestra, the ancestry of Achilles is described at length. After several good marriages of ancestors are mentioned, the final (false) marriage of Achilles and Iphigenia comes. Usually an allusion com pares misfortune with misfortune. Poignancy is added to the plight of Iphigenia by the reversal of the point, misfortune with good fortune, and by Clytemnestra's ignorance of her daughter's real future. Iphigenia in Aulis 1036-88, choral ode. A long description of the marriage of Peleus and Thetis (to 1079); then, by contrast, the future sacrifice of Iphigenia is described (1080-88). A crown (also worn at a wedding) will be placed on the head of Iphigenia as she is about to be sacrificed: se d'epi kara stepsousi kallikoman plokamon, 1080-81. As in 697-712, the contrast is between a happy wedding and a wedding</page><page sequence="9">Euripides'Use of Myth 161 aborted by this sacrifice, with the two weddings related by family connections. Iphigenia in Aulis 1171-76, Clytemnestra wonders how she will feel towards Agamemnon waiting at home in Argos after the death of Iphigenia. Could one of Agamemnon's children, she asks (1192-93), look at him after he has killed Iphigenia? The passage is full of dramatic irony on several levels. The audience knows how Clytem nestra will feel back home, and it knows that Orestes and Electra will continue to love Agamemnon; but this knowledge comes from the Oresteia, produced some fifty years earlier and revived some ten years earlier (according to the more or less accepted date for the production of Euripides' play).31 And the placing of Agamemnon's seat at Argos is a direct literary allusion to the Oresteia." So a mythologi cal allusion is often a literary allusion as well, almost by necessity since the fifth century author had no neutral handbook of classical mythology to consult, but only the charged works of his predecessors. He could agree with the previous tellings of the myth, as Sophocles may have done in his Electra; or he could disagree, as Euripides (and perhaps Sophocles) did in his Electra; or he could be neutral or regard the previous telling as now part of received traditon, as Euripides seems at this point to be doing.33 Hippolytus 337-39. Phaedra laments her mother Pasiphaë's lust and calls on her sister Ariadne, "Unhappy sister, bride of Dionysus." Euripides here seems to be following the Odyssey ver sion, where Dionysus must have been Ariadne's first husband, whom she betrayed for Theseus." Phaedra concludes (343) that hers is an inherited curse. Winnington-Ingram identifies heredity (physis, Phae dra's Hippolytus') with the mythic past of a character." The fates of Phaedra's family and of Hippolytus and Theseus are also linked by the bull, who in the past loved Pasiphaë and in the future will destroy Hippolytus and through him Theseus.36 Hippolytus 1290-95. Artemis curses Theseus: go to hell (or maybe turn into a bird and avoid destruction) and you should keep apart from good men. Both curses will be fulfilled. Theseus will descend into Hades with Peirithous, almost as a burlesque of the mythologem; and he will be exiled to Scyros, where he will die in obscurity and isolation. (Perhaps avoiding destruction in the form of a bird is a black-humored reference to his fall off a cliff.) So, as with</page><page sequence="10">162 Robert Eisner Creon in the Antigone, we are tempted to follow the tragic figure beyond the confines of the play to his ignoble end. Teiresias had cursed Creon with death in his house and with the attack of the rela tives of the six unburied heroes, 1078-83. The first part of the curse is fulfilled in the play, the second after the play. Hippolytus 1420-22. Artemis says to the dying Hippolytus that she will get even with Aphrodite by waiting until the next time Aphro dite loves a mortal. Then she'll shoot him down with her arrows. The audience wonders if anyone specific is alluded to. Perhaps Artemis has no one in mind, but Euripides does: in one version Adonis was was killed by the boar because of the anger of Artemis (Apollod. 3.14.4.1,) Euripides in making allusions of the two kinds discussed was using the technique of his predecessors, though in his own peculiar way. He made a third use of the mythic material, neither narrative nor simple allusion, and this was unique to him. It was his main use of the material, and one he invented. He juxtaposed worlds, the mythic one that he inherited and the new, "real" one that he invented. The parados of the Hippolytus takes the following form: 1 9.1-30 Pa ra u/a \r crpncrranhv nf rnnlrs anil run nine u/afpr nf Ocean, whence came the friend who told the Chorus of Phaedra's illness. 131-40. Description of Phaedra's wasting away. 141-50. Can it be a frenzy or madness like one of these: Pan's, Hecate's, that of the Corybantes, of the Mother, or of Dictynna-Artemis? 151-60. Or could it be some other woman in Theseus' life or bad news from Crete? 161-69. A closing generalization on women s unhappiness and an obeisance to Artemis. Conacher has pointed out the regular progression in Euripides' choruses "from literal and specific mention of divine visitations to a more general expression of the power in nature which such tales symbolize."38 We can see much of that going on here. Within the ode there is also an alternation of fantasy, distance, and generalities with</page><page sequence="11">Euripides' Use of Myth 163 the reality of Phaedra's problem, but its general tone is elevated, removed, mythical. Immediately after the ode the most quotidian character in the play enters, the Nurse. She, too, is full of thoughts on the trials of this life, but she delivers them in the chatter of a nurse or a washerwoman, in short, jangling phrases. Phaedra has entered with the Nurse, and she is longing to flee to the distant world such as the parodos opened with: ... if only I could draw from the dewy spring a draught of fresh spring water! Tf nnlv Τ onnlrl lie flmnnp- the nnnlars . Brings me to the mountains! (208-10, 214, Grene) In 281 we learn that Theseus is absent in foreign (unspeci fied) lands. This is an absence from "reality" (what is happening on stage) and a presence in a faraway, mysterious geography that often seems identified with the world of myth, even for the characters on stage. The Chorus begins the second ode with a dysapotropaic prayer against love (525-34). After mentioning how love is not given honors consonant with his powers (535-44, a passage that Plato may have picked up in the Symposium 177A-B), they describe the destructive "marriages" of Iole (545-54) and Semele (555-62), and close with a general simile on the destructive power of love (563-64). This ode is immediately followed by Phaedra's realistic excitement and despair as she learns that the Nurse has propositioned Hippolytus; and then by Hippolytus' appearance: he expresses his disgust, then fantasizes absurdly about how babies ought to be born (616-24). The third choral passage returns to the geography of faraway places (732-51), where the Chorus wishes it could go and be changed into a bird (me pterousan ornin, 733).39 Apparently this other world feeds the imagination of escapism. Suddenly the Chorus switches to the closer, but still mythical, world of Phaedra's story: her voyage from Crete to Athens (752-63). They end with a brief description of her suicide within the skënë (765-75). The reality of her death and the impact of it on Theseus take up the scene that follows. Like a movie cameraman Euripides zooms in from mythic distance to close reality, then moves out again to a wide view in the next ode. George Walsh has analyzed the structure and allusions of. the first stasimon of the Electia along similar lines. Walsh points out the</page><page sequence="12">164 Robert Eisner importance of understanding Euripides' choral odes to the under standing of his plays and how inadequate our experience with Sopho cles' and Aeschylus' choral techniques is for approaching Euripides' odes. The odes disturb the audience's involvement with stage reality and offer a different illusion. The great decoration of the lyrics helps to make the odes stand apart from the rest of the play. The escape odes are more ornate than the narrative odes. The present time and place are contrasted with a remote place or the distant past. The first stasimnn nf the Rlentra 1432-4861 contrasts Orestes' doubt and anti heroism with a vision of legendary heroes. The rhetorical progression runs from remote to immediate, from Achilles to Agamemnon to Aga memnon's death. Similarly the geography moves from the remote to the present scene. The epode makes the final link with the present situ ation; it replaces the shining Achilles "with the blood and dust of battle." The exact connection is made at 482 ff.: "Achilles was glorious, and so was his commander Agamemnon; Agamemnon was killed by Clytemnestra; Clytemnestra therefore must die, for having murdered such a hero."40 After such an ode Orestes, the son-avenger, does not fit the expected image. He comes stealthily as Electra's sav ior would not (534 ff.). Orestes is compared to Fterseus and Bellerophon, and Clytemnestra to Medusa or the chimaera. Orestes is not of the heroic mold of Perseus, but like Bellerophon he will end his life in exile.41 In short, the ode provides a bright contrast to the dramatic action and a reproach to the unheroic characters, but it also fore shadows the disastrous end of the play and the future obscurity of its characters. Of course there is always a letdown, musical and metrical if not mythological, after a choral passage. But the letdowns are unusually sharp in Euripides. Complaints from critics about this have often sprung from an assumption that Euripides was using his choruses simply for decoration or as metrical showpieces, with the result that ne IS Diameu ΙΟΙ me ueuillie L&gt;1 lue eiimu» IIUUI au uigaiue liait ui uic play's structure to mere entr'acte.42 I believe that in these seemingly decorative choruses, Euripides is deliberately juxtaposing realities for dramatic effect, and that this technique is similar to his manipulation of some of the material out side the choruses. When Theseus invokes the curse of Poseidon on Hippolytus (887-90),"This sudden switch from the natural to the super natural, or vice versa, is a typical feature of Euripidean drama."45</page><page sequence="13">Euripides' Use of Myth 165 Similar shifts are found in the Medea, where the plot is developed entirely in terms of her character, but the escape is made by divine means (the Sun's chariot, 1321-22), and in the Heracles where the direction of the shift is reversed. When the Heracles opens the hero is off in the world of myth, capturing Cerberus. On the reality of the stage his wife, children, and "father" Amphitryon are under threat of death from Lycus, the usurper of the throne of Thebes. Heracles soon returns - from myth to reality - and saves them. Now that he has completed his athloi, however, Hera is free to attack him. She maddens him, and he kills his wife and children. When he comes out of his madness, he repudiates the whole mythological machinery that has just destroyed his sanity and his family (1340-46). A puzzled Albin Lesky wondered whether Euripides did not "invalidate the presuppositions of his own work by such criticism."44 Justina Gregory insists that Heracles is actually con demning the false stories about the gods rather than the gods them selves.45 Is the repudiation of myth or of the poets' lies? The two are one and the same. Heracles denies that the gods bind one another or that one is master of another, "for god (ho theos) lacks nothing, if indeed he is truly god" (1345-46). Faintly, in the afterglow of his madness, Heracles is rejecting polytheism and its vehicle, the myths of the poets: "these are the wretched stories of singers (aoidôn)" (1346). Ironically Lycus, the enemy usurper, has already rejected much of myth by depreciating Heracles' deeds at the opening of the play (151 ff.). The maddening and ultimate restoration of Heracles is strikingly paralleled in some episodes of the soap opera "Mary Hartman, Mary Hartman." Mary's emotional collapse occurs during and because of her appearance on the "David Susskind" show - a "real" show within a fictional one - when she cracks under the vicious questions of three — j c„ ward, she is advised to prove she is normal by watching some TV. Although her rejection of the medium that she is a part of and that drove her mad is not as explicit as Heracles', the criticism of the entertainment medium by the authors of the show is every bit as vigorous as Euripides' was of the mythological medium.46 Of course, this shift of Heracles is of the sort favored by those critics who concentrate on Euripides the intellectual, chafing in the bonds of the received tradition. But what of the other shifts? Euripides</page><page sequence="14">166 Robert Eisner is enjoying the tension between the two worlds, using, even playing with it, as the creators of the soaps are playing with their worlds. His motives for creating this tension must be aesthetic as well as critical. Richard Altick says: "Criticism is coming more and more to recognize the advantages of considering literary works as implicit dialagues between writer and reader, their effect residing, to a greater or less degree, in the tension between the writer's purpose and his reader's preconceptions and expectations concerning the subject under discus sion "47 Surh an invifafinn te nlav with a master is ap.r.Anteri nnlv hv daring and skilled readers or members of the audience. Less clever members observe the master's play from the sidelines. Aesthetically healthy authors find their worthiest opponents in their best readers. Euripides' famous habit of bringing wretched characters on stage in rags achieved the same jarring juxtaposition of the real and the mythological as did his fanciful choruses following or preceding sordid scenes. Euripides shocked the philistines and did it with calculation. He managed the contrast and the resulting shock in a variety of ways. As Winnington-Ingram pointed out, in the Phoenissae Polyneices is first described by a young, romantic Antigone as she sees him at a distance from the walls of Thebes (161-69). His subsequent entrance with his nerves, at least, in tatters (,20211.; jars witn tne image 01 a shining warrior that she manufactured for the audience. Of course part of Euripides' intention here was critical, to strip the heroic figure of some of his legendary glamor.48 Euripides used many such shifts in the Electra, apart from the choral shifts already noted. Bernard Knox has pointed out the domestic nature of the play's opening. Ironically, this results in an invitation to detach ourselves - from the passions and actions of common human beings - rather than to identity ourselves with tne neroes 01 didactic tragedy.49 Actually the "daily reality" of the play begins only after the farmer's long mythological prologue, when Electra enters in rags with a water jar on her unwashed head (54 ff.), a common scene from the daily life of the peasants and urban middle class. One wonders if the mask-maker wasn't tempted to give Electra just the trace of a moustache. At 357 ff. the farmer offers the strangers, Orestes and Pylades, hospitality. This could be an epic motif, but here is treated rather more as the hospitality of impoverished daily life known to many among the audience and readers. Electra complains of the poverty</page><page sequence="15">Euripides' Use of Myth 167 of the house at 404-05. Hospitality in the epic manner is offered to Orestes rather by Aegisthus (779-80). At 427-31 the farmer praises wealth; here again, instead of the gold of saga and quest, we have the longings of a commoner, for the stuff to buy food and pay doctors' bills with. At 880 ff., Electra gives Orestes an heroic greeting after he has killed Aegisthus; but the tone of the scene is quickly lowered when Orestes suggests throwing Aegisthus' corpse out to the beasts and vultures or displaying his head on a stake (896-99). At 988 ff. the Chorus give Clytemnestra an epic greeting; she ignores this and asks for someone to give her a hand down from the chariot Î998-99): the right director could do much with this. Throughout the play the bour geois nature of the crime is emphasized and compared with the epic stature of the long myth it brings to a close. The grandeur of the myth resides in the choral passages and in the characters' expectations. The bourgeois reality of the crime is revealed in the characters' actions, iambic dialogue, motives (neurosis and materialism), dress (at least in Electra's case), and undoubtedly in their gestures and physical carriage on the stage. Often the two worlds are linked up at the ends of the plays by Aetiological denouements,50 as in Hippolytus 1423-30 where Artemis founds the cult of Hippolytus for brides at Troezen, that link the customs of the day with the world of myth. The deus ex machina endings can serve a similar function of lxlicuxxj VC'ACJ/Oj.iig, tuo IVVKJ wmiuo auci Micy liavc UCCIl UUIllIclSlt5U 1UI II1UUI1 of the play. At the end of the Electra the tension is explained, though not justified, by the Dioscuri who tell Orestes and Electra that they have done wrong. The Dioscuri then depart to aid the Athenian fleet in Sicily (1347-48), thus relating the play to a national crisis of the moment.51 Before the exit, though they refer to the story that Helen never went to Troy: it was a phantom in her stead (1280-83). This allusion does several duties. It destroys any real justice in the sacrifice of Iphigenia, the crime that started the chain nf mnrriers in rhic 1 Ο (TOη or_ ation that ends with the murder of Clytemnestra in this play. Secondly, the theft of Helen and the punishment that the Greeks inflicted on the Trojans is the mirror-myth in this play for the crime of Clytemnestra and the vengeance of Orestes and Electra (432-86, first mentioned 213-14) (just as the story of the unfaithful Clytemnestra and her</page><page sequence="16">168 Robert Eisner family is the mirror-myth throughout the Odyssey to the faithful Penel ope and her family). So, when Euripides discredits the vengeance in the main plot here (1244 ff.), he also discredits the paradigm for that vengeance. The Dioscuri are the best figures to accomplish that discrediting: they are the physical link between Helen and Clytem nestra who is "our murdered sister, your murdered mother," (1243, Vermeule). Helen moreover will help to bury Clytemnestra (1280).52 Thus artistic form, mirror-myth, follows function. Thirdly, the phantom Helen story refers to a play that Euripides has not yet written, but seems to have in mind to write.53 Such cross-references not only tie an author's work together, but tie the whole mythical world together. This excursus on the Electra, then, aside from illustrating another Euripidean use of myth, justifies my claim that though Euripides may have criticized the belief in the gods as represented in, say, Homer, he found the structure he inherited a delight to play with. The Helen is one of the richest and most delightful playgrounds for myth and reality. C. P. Segal has analyzed "The Two Worlds of Euripides' Helen" - tragedy and comedy, appearance and reality, nomos and physis. If the Helen has to be given one label, the most fitting is romance: "One of the recurrent devices of romance is the division between two worlds, a 'real' world of pain and trouble and an 'ideal' world of peace, serenity, simplicity, rustic ease."54 The first line of the play creates a sense of never-never land: "These are the streams of the Nile with beautiful nymphs" (or "virgin streams of the Nile"). In this fantastic setting, however, elements of the two worlds intermingle, salvation and danger, beautiful queen and beggar king, myth and reality. The myth of the Trojan war is destroyed by the truth. The truth turns out to be a phantom. Heaping irony on irony, Enrinides has both Helen (229-51) and the phantom itself (via a mes senger speech, 608-15) reveal the truth. Mythical characters question myth: Helen has doubts about the story that Zeus as a swan was her father— .. if this story is true" (21). The Dioscuri, intermediaries between Helen and Clytemnestra in the Electra, here at first are not clearly inhibitants either of the world of myth or of the world of reality. (Teucer:) They are dead and are not dead; there are two stories. Men say they are gods, having become like stars.</page><page sequence="17">Euripides' Use of Myth 169 [or] That they breathed out their life in slaughter, on account of their sister. (138, 140, 142) Euripides invented this last version, "As an unfounded rumour to add to Helen's load of misery," as A. M. Dale says in her commentary ad. loc.55 I am not sure this was Euripides' only motive. The standard story of the Dioscuri lies somewhere between the two versions here: Pollux is immortal, Castor mortal; they share this immortality by alternating a day in heaven together followed by a day in Hades (Pindar Nemean 10.55 ff.; Apollodorus 3.11.2). Euripides has chosen to report the different versions first, in order to widen the gap between myth and reality; ultimately he decides for myth and a happy ending. After the reunited Helen and Menelaus have sailed off back to Greece (the real world), the Dioscuri appear and quell King Theoclymenus' rage at losing his intended bride and victim. They declare to him and to the audience that Helen will become a goddess and Menelaus will go to the isles of the blest. They then leave to hasten and guard their sister's voyage. Myth and the ideal win out at the end of this romance. But the last words of the Dioscuri (if not spurious) are a patent lie: "For it is not that the gods hate the nobly-born, but these have more trials to undergo than men of no account" (1678-79, Dale). The audi ence of this play, in which thousands were shown to have died for a phantom, must have gasped. Euripides may be asking if such a happy ending can be any more real than the Helen for whom Troy was de stroyed.56 He did find things wrong with the interited structure. His gods are the most Homeric of Greek tragedy. This throwback to the old anthropomorphism was a deliberate reductio ad nauseam of the com monly accepted personalities of the gods: Aphrodite and Artemis in the Hippolytus, the whole Olympian structure in the Heracles, Dionysus in the Bacchae, Apollo in the Electra, divine vengeance in the Medea. But criticism was not all Euripides was up to.57 Although he sometimes projected elements of the characters' personalities (sexual repression in the cases of Hippolytus and Pentheus) the myth was not a detach able framework from the psychological structure.58 Euripides' talent was varied and he made varied use of it. I started this essay by assuming that the Greeks preferred types to individuals in their art, the recurring themes of myth to the sands of daily experience. Euripides, perhaps partly because of his penchant</page><page sequence="18">170 Robert Eisner for pathological states of mind, sought for truth or for a medium of expression "in the shifting world of experience that element of neces sity with which man's free choices come in conflict"59 as well as in the myths. His attitude to the past was clearly different from that of his fellow poets. Both the audience's and the playwrights' attitude to myth was a recherche du temps perdu, because in the past were to be found the patterns of present experience. Euripides, Thucydides, and their contemporaries in medical research revolutionized thought: they claimed to be discovering the typical in the flux of the present (Thuc. 1.22). But only Euripides chose to juxtapose a myth or the world that could be recovered from myth with the truth or world of his present. This involved uprooting characters from their natural setting in myth and displaying them in unfamiliar robes, as out of place as African masks nailed to the walls of a modern atelier all chrome and plexiglass. The juxtaposition creates a tension that is aesthetically stimulating and, at least in the case of Euripides, intellectually illuminating.
