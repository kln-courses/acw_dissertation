<plain_text><page sequence="1">A Joint Enterprise: Indian Elites and the Making of British Bombay. By Preethi Chopra, pp. 293, University of Minnesota Press, Minneapolis and London, 201 1 doi:io.ioi7/Si35Ã³i863 1 1000484 To the eyes of Londoners a first glimpse of central Bombay can be startling. The towering Gothic and sleek Art Deco buildings, the red double-decker buses (until recently) plying down parades, drives and</page><page sequence="2">196 Reviews of Books circles bearing English names, and the heterogeneous mix of people negotiating the zebra crossings, stimulate a strange familiarity. The persistent humidity and a whiff of sea breeze are reminders that one is far from home, but one might be forgiven if one's first impression is of something transplanted. Bombay at first appears as the quintessential colonial city. What this book admirably sets out in detail is what the visitor soon begins to discover, if only by reading the names inscribed on buildings, on dedication plaques and on statues: that far from being created solely by and for the British, Bombay in the colonial era was a joint enterprise. From the outset, Indian elites lived in and contributed to the city's construction; in the case of some communities - notably the Parsis - disproportionately in relation to their numbers. Leading Indian businessmen and philanthropists participated in the unlikely project of constructing the Empire's greatest city on this fragile spit of land, by building hospitals, colleges, libraries and sundry other public amenities. And these buildings were not mere ornaments or additions to whatever was provided by a patriarchal British Raj: they were essential components of the emerging infrastructure. Without them, Bombay could not have functioned as a city. The observation that many of Bombay's public buildings were sponsored by people like the Jeejeebhoys and Tatas is not new, and Preeti Chopra does not offer it as such. What she does do is tease out how shifting one's perspective from the colonial to the Indian elite viewpoint subtly changes the meaning of the city and of its constituent urban spaces. The frequent retelling of tales about how Indians were excluded from certain buildings, not to mention the buildings' stylistic resemblance to British architecture, might incline us to think of Bombay as a place where Indians were admitted on sufferance, or only on British terms. But Chopra points out how Indian communities in the city had their own spaces - private, shared and exclusive - and their own regulations. No one owned (or could even access) the whole of Bombay. It was a patchwork of overlapping cities, read differently according to which group you belonged to. Chopra's focus is on the major phases of urban reconstruction that occurred in the period between the 1850s, when the first textile mills were built, and the First World War. Her case for seeing Bombay (thus correctly spelt) at this time as a shared endeavour is made substantially in her first chapter. In later chapters of her book she moves on to related matters. Chapter Two considers the dominant styles of Victorian and Edwardian colonial architecture - notably Gothic and Indo-Saracenic. Chopra's purpose is not to describe the development of these styles, nor to show how they embody imperial ideology (both of which have been done before) but to try and uncover what they conveyed to Indian audiences. This is an interesting question that has often been raised, but never satisfactorily answered. For the benefit of readers less familiar with architectural matters, Chopra rightly insists (albeit at the end of her chapter, on p. 72) that "Discussions about style . . . were not superficial". Throughout the period in question it was widely understood that architectural styles - through visual associations - bore meanings in the public domain, and that those meanings formed a component of a building's function. In journals and other public forums, there was much discussion and even heated debate about which style was best suited to this or that Indian city, and why. Unfortunately, the readily available records of that debate preserve the voices mainly of the British architects, politicians and commentators; and Chopra is also right in complaining that much recent art-historical writing, while unravelling such questions as "What image of the Raj is conveyed by the Indo-Saracenic style?", tends to focus on British voices rather than Indian ones. This matters because the Indian public formed the largest constituent of the audience. We want to be able to ask: if this architect or politician intended that style to convey such-and-such a meaning to the general public, did it work? What did Indians think of the Gothic style? Sadly, despite the lucid delineation and frequent flagging of the question, Chopra's discussion gets us no closer to an answer. Coming to the point (on p. 60) she starts by quoting from the memoirs of</page><page sequence="3">Reviews of Books 197 a prominent Parsi, Sir Dinshaw E.Wacha, who was evidently unimpressed by Bombay's new Gothic buildings constructed in the 1860s, dismissing them as being "of no striking or original design". He in turn is equally summarily dismissed by Chopra as being "hardly representative of Bombay's public". The discussion immediately moves forward to the voices not of other Bombayites but to those of Antonio Gramsci and Pierre Bourdieu, whose concepts respectively of 'hegemony' and 'savoir' are invoked to justify - in the absence of any further contemporary Indian voices - speculation by the author on what Bombay's citizens 'would have' thought. Thus we are informed that "most of Bombay s population would not have known of or understood the significance of the Gothic Revival", in a religious sense. But, she goes on to point out, Gothic buildings commonly bear lots of sculpture depicting animals and people and "many would have" responded to these because "sculpture was familiar to Indians" (p. 61). Being unaware - unlike their British neighbours - of Gothic architecture in Britain, and thus associating it only with their own immediate environment, they would have interpreted it (she surmises) as expressing the chief characteristic of that environment, which was precisely that sense of Bombay being the product of a joint enterprise, as described in Chapter 1. To Indian eyes - Chopra says - the Gothic style lacked the Christian and national associations it bore for the British. "Instead, it represented the new public landscape for Bombay's citizens, funded by both the colonial regime and philanthropic natives", (pp. 62-64) The conclusion is attractive, but it may not escape readers' notice that it rests on a theoretical crutch and is not corroborated by Indian voices of the period: it moves from the author's own hypothesis ('would have') to a simple assertion ('it represented'). In style and method the book as a whole aligns itself with that body of scholarship that designates itself postcolonial. Beyond the political posturing, there is a worthy purpose to this widespread approach, namely to examine aspects of colonialism - including its cultural products - from perspectives other than those of the colonial producers. In part this responds to studies that are felt to depend too closely on the official colonial archive - a substantial but inevitably partial resource. The challenge is to find evidence of other views. There is more to that process of discovery than locating the alternative archive: typically it involves an engagement with theoretical ideas to find new strategies of interpretation. But in cases where the evidence is scanty, critical theory alone is used to fill the gap - not always successfully. Chapter 6 contains a discussion that opens with the assertion that "the British were engaged in the process of converting some Indian religious buildings to secular use" (p. 192). Readers who believe that the British in India were generally wary of meddling with buildings set aside for active worship will no doubt be intrigued by this claim and eager to read on. We are soon told that examples include "a governor's residence". When we get to the detail (pp. 194-195) we may feel short-changed on learning that "The Government House at Parel was formerly a church and convent belonging to the Jesuits and is probably the only example in Bombay where the British actually occupied a former place of worship". And anyway this appropriation is said by Chopra to have been political, not religious (though one doubts whether anyone on the receiving end of such an act would appreciate the distinction). There is briefly renewed hope in the next paragraph with mention of "another Government House", built at Malabar Point after 1812, "next to the ancient Hindu village ofWalkeshwar". But this example too looks as though it will fail to substantiate the claim about conversion, because as Chopra points out, "The Portuguese or Muslims destroyed the original Walkeshwar temple, but the British donated land for the new temple" (pp. 195-196). No evidence, then. At this point a French theorist is introduced to save the day: one Pierre Nora, speaking of the "conquest and eradication of memory by history". This idea is deployed to suggest that by building near the temple, the historically situated British caused a "clear rupture" from the site's association with "mythical events that took place in</page><page sequence="4">198 Reviews of Books time immemorial" (p. 197). The notion that Indian perceptions of the past are founded in 'memory' and British ones in 'history' looks like an outmoded essentialism. Besides, one might equally say that the British action at Walkeshwar did not replace but merely added another layer of meaning to the site. Or indeed invoke Nora's (dubious) distinction to reach the opposite conclusion: for the Walkeshwar temple is still active today, a living historic site, while the British Government House is a mere faded memory. The argument has imploded for lack of data, while the theorist - floating in a vacuum - tells us nothing. The account of the successful career of the Parsi engineer and architect Munchegi Cowasji Murzban, which occupies Chapter 3 , is more firmly rooted in archive material and is consequently much more engaging and instructive. The chapter details Murzban's contributions to numerous public buildings from high profile projects like Elphinstone College to lesser known Parsi hospitals and even residential communities founded by Murzban himself. Since almost all his designs are in variations of the Gothic style, the discussion also allows Chopra to develop further her argument about the meanings of the Gothic to Indian audiences. She demonstrates persuasively in the singular, particular case, Murzban's lack of engagement with any association that the style might have held for British audiences (such as Christianity) and his full and active participation in the idea of the joint enterprise. Constructing buildings for Murzban was about housing institutions with a role to play in the public sphere, a sphere that was partly shared and partly segregated but to which all contributed. The theme surfaces again in the second part of Chapter 6 (pp. 202-220), which explores how the joint enterprise found further visual - indeed anthropomorphic - expression in the city's many memorials, monuments and statues of both British and Indian worthies. Chopra's sensitive reading of these objects identifies them as the icons of what she calls a 'civil religion' of Empire. The book as a whole does not have the most coherent plan, but its apt title draws attention to its more engaging and persuasive sections. Giles Tillotson Royal Asiatic Society</page></plain_text>
