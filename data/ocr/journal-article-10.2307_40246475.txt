<plain_text><page sequence="1">Sappho's Apples: The Allusiveness of Blushes in Ovid and Beaumont THERESA M KRIER In the early sixth century b.c. , Sappho wrote lines that survive today only as a fragment: "As the sweet-apple reddens on the bouglvtop, on the top of the topmost bough; the apple^gatherers have forgotten it - no, they have not forgotten it entirely, but they could not reach it" (Campbell 130; Fr. 105a). In Augustan Rome Ovid used Sappho's simile, along with other important images of reddening, drawn from mythic and literary tradition, in his narrative of the myth of Salmacis and Hermaphroditus in the Metamorphoses. And in 1602 Francis Beaumont published Salmacis and Hermaphroditus, his own English Ovidian narrative of the passionate nymph and the reticent youth, imitating and outdoing Ovid in the flurry of mythic blushes with which he packed his poem. l Mythic blushes, in fact, are found everywhere in Renaissance romance, drama, lyric, and epyllia. In this essay I want to take Sappho's simile as exemplary of a tradition of mythic blushes, asking how later poets adapted the lines, how the fragment interacts with other allusions to other kinds of reddenings, and what these allusions imply about the shape of imagination in each poet. The topos of blushing in the poems of Ovid and Beaumont raises two key issues, the stylistic issue of allusive imitation and the ethical issue of the nature of erotic desire. To instantiate this claim is to sketch the contrasts between the two narratives, their controlling visions, and their authors' management of the prior texts invited into their own poems.

Published by The Pennsyl- vania State University Press, University Park and London.</page><page sequence="2">2 COMPARATIVE LITERATURE STUDIES want to show that Ovid's uses of Homer, Sappho, and Virgil are allusions - specific, precise, carrying their own strongly arranged story about the diminishments of desire and society; while Beaumont's impor- tant invocations of Ovid and of Edmund Spenser are echoes: large-scale, non-specific, and concerned less directly with the issue of Salmacis's problematic libido than with the suitability of mythic language to describe human conditions and drives. Sappho's lines are part of an epithalamion; they have been taken so since antiquity. It was the rhetorician Himerius (b. ca. a.d. 315) who preserved the fragment in an opulent prose epithalamion of his own; in it he compares the bride to the apple and the groom to Achilles, thus confirming the mythic basis of the simile.2 He represents Sappho's sweet- apple as an image of innocence growing naturally toward the threshold of experience, as an image of the body alluring both in its innocence and in its ripening, as an image linking the ripening of the apple to the various reddenings of ascendent human sexual consciousness, as an image ac- knowledging both tenderness and threat as responses to the blush.3 The simile attracted Ovid, in whose work the story is so regularly that of innocence threatened, shattered, transformed into erotic consciousness at considerable cost. In his work, especially in the Amores and the Meta- morphoses, the bodily sign of preserved single identity is virginity; its psychic sign, the candor of the sole selfs assumption of solitude; its color, the white of undisturbed innocence. The colors of love in European literature, red and white, reside in the arousing alternatives of innocence and experience, candor and shame, the quotidian complexion of white broken by the rising blood of erotic self-consciousness. That awareness in the innocent can be triggered by the physical desire of an observer who intrudes on the hidden or solitary condition of the innocent.4 To observe the rising blood in the face is to observe the most deeply internal being made external and visible against the will; as an opening up of interior identity, the blush in Ovid functions as a proffer of intimacy, even against the consent of the blusher. We will see Salmacis's desire intensified by Hermaphroditus's blush; elsewhere, the amator of Amores 2.5 is aroused after his cruelty to the woman makes her blush; Narcissus's frustrating desire intensifies after he sees his image redden in the pool (Met. 3.477- 93). Both of these two blushes are characterized with a cluster of allusive similes, that of Narcissus by a group including an adaptation of Sappho's original simile.5</page><page sequence="3">SAPPHO'S APPLES 3 Ovid's tale of Salmacis and Hermaphroditus is one of those told by the daughters of Minyas at the beginning of Met. 4. It immediately follows the heavy pathos of the tale of Clyde, who loved the Sun in his human form but whose fate is to become a flower, turning daily toward the sun in its natural form. Her helplessness, grief, and ultimate exposure contrast at every point with the greater vigor of Salmacis. Salmacis, a renegade from Diana's band of nymphs, prefers the luxuries of bathing, grooming, and self-admiration over the more strenuous pleasures of the huntress. This gentle narcissism remains her condition until she sees the son of Hermes and Venus, bashful youth overwhelmed by Salmacis's explicit declarations of desire and her physical advances. His plea for her to stop is only partly successful: though she refrains from throwing her arms around him, she does hide in the bushes, to watch with increasing desire his bathing and his delight in apparent solitude. The urgency of her longing leads her to a remarkable exclamation of triumph in possession quite unlike anything that the child- like Clytie could muster - " Vicimus et meus est* exclam√¢t" (Met. 4.356). In this ecstasy of possession she leaps into the pool, risking all for love as Narcissus never did, and holds tight to the struggling youth, in a passage laden with allusive similes from epic (Met. 4.361-67). Their metamorpho- sis is a merger into the form that has ever since been called the hermaphro- dite, male and female in one body, image simultaneously of grotesqueness, of sexual union and its bliss, and of male depletion by the female. In this essay I want to discuss only a few lines of Ovid's narrative, the description of Hermaphroditus's blush at Salmacis's first overtures. The boy's blush occurs as part of another dense cluster of similes, characteristic of Ovid and always worth the assumption of something important going on in the lines.7 They are also specific allusions to older texts, used in the service of describing nascent erotic awareness, including Ovid's reference to Sappho's round, maidenly sweet-apple. The similes reflect the interest that Ovid takes in Hermaphroditus's integrity of bodily consciousness, and the eventual loss of that integrity via the divorce of bodily experience from interior identity. Ovid begins by depicting the extensiveness and delight of the self in privacy, as we can tell by the relative absence of erotic innuendo in Hermaphroditus's real happiness of the senses, a happi- ness always linked to solitude in Ovid's work: turn quoque respiciens, fruticumque recondita silva delimit flexuque genu submisit; at ille,</page><page sequence="4">4 COMPARATIVE LITERATURE STUDIES scilicet ut vacuis et inobservatus in herbis, hue it et hinc illuc et in adludentibus undis summa pedum taloque tenus vestigia tinguit; nee mora, temperie blandarum captus aquarum mollia de tenero velamina corpore ponit. (Met. 4.339-45) This ease of Hermaphroditus's self-possession within nature is almost im- mediately threatened by the pressure of Salmacis's watching; Ovid keeps a tight focus on the single relation between nymph and youth, figured in the line of sight from her eyes to his nakedness: turn vero placuit, nudaeque cupidine formae Salmacis exarsit; flagrant quoque lumina nymphae, non aliter quam cum puro nitidissimus orbe opposita speculi referitur imagine Phoebus . . . (Met. 346-49) The consequence of Salmacis's kindling is a frantic, funny, and ghoulish drive toward the victory of possession. This drive is not much different in degree from that of the male pursuers in the poem, but the emphases on the inflammation of female libido and the final metamorphic fusion of masculine and feminine form make Salmacis's desire more grotesque than that of the gods in the early books of the poem. Salmacis is equally aroused by Hermaphroditus's blush, figured in those similes for redness adapted from Homer, Sappho, and Virgil: . . . pueri rubor ora notavit; nescit, enim, quid amor; sed et erubuisse decebat: hie color aprica pendentibus arbore pomis aut ebori tine to est aut sub candore rubenti, cum frustra resonant aera auxiliaria, lunae. (Met. 4.330-33) The blush which evokes these comparisons is specifically the blush of erotic inexperience and embarrassment, the kind of blush that is both aesthetically beautiful and erotically arousing. The very pace of the minia- ture catalogue of similes supports Salmacis's rapid process of desire, in its</page><page sequence="5">SAPPHO'S APPLES 5 swift movement from "aprica pendentibus arbore pomis" to "ebori tincto" to "sub candore rubenti . . . lunae." That pace is a crucial mark of Ovid's Salmacis, and distinguishes her from Beaumont's more prolix and expan- sive heroine, as we will see. Nymph, poetic style, and experience of desire are much more brisk, not to say urgent, in Ovid than they will be in Beaumont. But the reader has the privilege, as Salmacis has not, of slowing the urgency of the text and lingering over those allusive similes. Ovid first recalls Sappho, but in order to mark his own shift in tone, and more exactly to mark the tone of Salmacis's desire. He cuts the failed reach of the apple- gatherers, for Salmacis after all succeeds in gathering her apple; her hearty wooing is quite without the tentative reticence of Sappho's self-correction (". . . no, they have not forgotten it entirely ..."). He drops too the gradual action of apples reddening, and the unintentionally alluring reserve implied in "on the bough' top, on the top of the top-most bough. " Hermaphroditus's blush is one of innocence abashed and made awk- ward, innocence the more poignant for being on the verge of sexual experience (which in Ovid's poem is generally equivalent to loss). The simile of the apple suggests as much; the brief reference to "painted ivory" sustains the possibility. For the latter phrase is itself a palimpsest of allu- sions to epic similes, which Ovid truncates for comic purposes. "Painted ivory" looks forward to the ivory figures encased in glass in the simile of lines 354-55; but it also looks backward in time to Homer and Virgil. The oldest layer in the palimpsest is Homer's ivory dyed with crimson, a simile for the blood stains of Menelaos's wound: As when some Maionian woman or Karian with purple colours ivory, to make it a cheek piece for horses; it lies away in an inner room, and many a rider longs to have it, but it is laid up to be a king's treasure, two things, to be the beauty of the horse, the pride of the horseman; so, Menelaos, your shapely thighs were stained with the colour of blood, and your legs also and the ankles beneath them. (IL 4.141-47) W. R. Johnson rightly observes that the ivory "is emblematic both of the glory of his wound and of his vitality and his health as a warrior . . . blood</page><page sequence="6">6 COMPARATIVE LITERATURE STUDIES from the wound might be thought to defile Menelaus' health and beauty, but in fact it only accentuates them" (Darkness Visible 57-58). The Ho* meric simile concerns itself with the beauty possible in a warrior society and the vigor of equestrian heroism; the typically Homeric appreciation of excellence in craftsmanship as well as of the warrior's more glamorous skill - both defined by the notion of arete - outlines the appropriateness of heroic valor and opens an ordered place for such a drive within society. Virgil takes this simile over in the Aeneid; he transfers the image to the blush of innocence contemplating its own extinction, as Menelaos's battle wound becomes instead the sexual wound of Lavinia's growing consciousness, when she hears Aeneas spoken of as her potential con* queror and husband. It is a blush that inflames Turnus to his disastrous battle: accepit vocem lacrimis Lavinia matris flagrantes perfiisa genas, cui plurimus ignem subiecit rubor, et calefacta per ora curcurrit. Indum sanguineo veluti violaverit ostro si quis ebur, aut mixta rubent ubi lilia multa alba rosa: tales virgo dabat ore colores. (Aen. 12.64-69) The lilies lose their perfect purity by being mixed with roses, and so they blush; but that loss is beautiful and arousing, as ivory "stained" with blood-red purple sustains a loss that is beautiful; the potential loss of Lavinia's innocence is what makes her blush and what feeds Turnus's frenzy.8 Rubescence signifies the possible loss of psychic candor, at the same time that it arouses the fever of Turnus and later of Salmacis as she observes Hermaphroditus's maidenly blush. The clarity and aptness of heroic vigor that Homer had observed in the lucid red stains of his simile have undergone a fall in their Virgilian transformation. It parallels the larger fall from Homer's grandeur to Vn&gt; gil's darker world, and the later author's somber meditations on the dis- tance between the possibilities for heroism in Achilles's world and Turnus's. What drives Turnus is less an enabling and ennobling arete than a tragic furor compounded of muddied motives, aroused by reddening stains which are not elegant aggrandizements of an already pure artifact (part of the plenitude of Homer's world), but a loss within a person. The</page><page sequence="7">SAPPHO'S APPLES 7 loss of Lavinia's innocence transforms into the loss of Italy to the Latins, through Turnus and his response to her blush. The movement from the recUand-ivory of Homer's simile in the Iliad, to Virgil's simile in the Aeneid, thence to Ovid's in the Metamorphoses, is a tiny history of human drives. Homer's tragic gaiety provides an unclouded vision of heroic valor as the shaping human drive that gives significance to acts of making, to the roles of men and women, to forms of military beauty; the simile brings to the wounding of Menelaos the spaciousness and articulations of a whole and ordered society. Virgil both undermines that notion of the drive of arete, and laments its loss: compared to Homer's picture of ideal valor governing a whole culture, Turnus's furor is considerably murkier in its inward origins, more individual, and more explosive in its results. Virgil achieves this inwardness and complicates Homer's pictured ideal with the tainted eroticism of those roses among the lilies. The red of crafted dyes and blood nobly shed is appropriated for the blush of sexual awareness that arouses both rage and desire. (It is in this way that Ovid too uses the simile of roses and lilies in the complex blush of shame of Amores 2.5.) Homeric arete falls to Virgilian furor, thence to Ovid's tale, where the simile loses the craftsmanship of the women, the joy of making, the scope of social order and the Virgilian pudor of female desire, and becomes in its comic diminishment only the aestheticized whiteness and blushing that inflame Salmacis to exert her frantic and comic pressures on Hermaphroditus. My argument is that Ovid makes part of his story the allusive reflections on drive and ambition embedded in the similes of reddening; that he values Virgil's expansion of the similes' connotations to include eroticism; in short, that Ovid's allusive choices in this group of similes are made with precision. Ovid in his turn shifts Virgil's elegant picture of erotic drive infecting heroic valor to a comic and terrible picture of erotic drive undermining not an epic sense of identity (that is Turnus's tragedy) but the pastoral identity of a youth barely reddening into maturity, like an apple not quite accessible. Francis Beaumont's 1602 Salmacis and Hermaphro√†tus is an engaging elephant of nearly one thousand lines, an intentional expansion of Ovid's 103 lines. The poem is to be not a translation of one Ovidian passage, but, like the Renaissance Metamorphoses itself, a compendium, a roomy and entertaining collection of as many myths as can conveniently be included.</page><page sequence="8">8 COMPARATIVE LITERATURE STUDIES Each of Beaumont's two principal characters acts as a kind of magnet for an interlocked chain of stories. Hence Hermaphroditus attracts to himself stories about Diana, about Apollo (both of whom find the boy nearly irresistible: Beaumont's offhanded mention of pederasty aims to suggest a nonchalant sophistication of tone), about Cupid's eyes, about the nymphs' pleasure in watching the hero, even a little aetiological myth about white roses. And Salmacis, who appears here not as an image of the horror of female lust but as a comically attractive tart,9 suggests to the writer a fantastic linkage of stories about Jove and herself; about Jove and Venus in the palace of Astraea (who functions here as a kind of celestial notary public, witnessing a vow by Jove to make Salmacis a star); about Venus and Vulcan's blackmail of Jove; about Bacchus, Apollo, and Mercury, and spats among them; about Aurora. This habit of linking tales in a lively tangle of feuds, politics, and backbiting has the effect of implying that the piece could continue expanding indefinitely, for as long as the gods continue to wheel and deal. What unifies this meandering narrative is a tone of evident happiness, taken in all the stories, the characters, the events. This happi* ness amounts to a kind of complacence in the narrator's tone; it is an amoral happiness, in the sense that the narrator treats all events and objects in the poem as equal providers of delight, both to himself and to the characters. There is a subliminal hilarity that the world should offer such tantalizing gifts to enjoy; things exist in the world, as do persons, largely to give happiness simply by existing as entertainment. Salmacis herself is a complacent courtesan, the relaxed enjoyer of the affections of the greatest gods - Jove, Apollo, Bacchus have all been in love with her. In spite of her easy welcome of these attentions, though, she is strictly still a virgin.10 She is both opportunistic and hoydenish. The former quality allows for the story of her shrewd bargaining with Jove for stellification; the latter results in her doing a favor for Apollo which he thanks by giving her access to a beautiful boy. He promises her that . . . she should enjoy The heavenly sight of the most beauteous boy That ever was. The Nymph was pleas'd with this, Hoping to reape some unaccustom'd blisse By the sweet pleasure that she should enjoy, In the blest sight of such a melting boy. (535-42)</page><page sequence="9">SAPPHO'S APPLES 9 This generosity of Apollo's carries none of the connotations of pimping, whether turned to comic or vicious ends; this is partly a function of the diction, to which I shall return, but it is also due to the fact that the author simply ignores the existence of such connotations, in favor of the entertainment value of this "blest sight." Hence the narrator's indulgent smile at the nymphs ("wanton wenches"): The lovely Nymphes have oft times seene him swimme, And closely stole his clothes from off the brim, Because the wanton wenches would so fayne See him come nak'd to ask his clothes againe. (89-92) As in this passage, one of the large subjects of Beaumont's poems is the pleasure of sexual watching. All the characters and objects in the poem watch each other all the time. It is in no way a furtive or sordid activity; taking pleasure in watching is simply the most pervasive erotic activity in the poem, far more frequent than the occasional and trivialized drive toward sexual union - that is until the moment when Salmacis sees Her- maphroditus. The object most watched is the youth himself, toward whom the whole natural cosmos yearns, with a light but unmistakable pathos: He then, supposing he was all alone . . . Runs here and there; then on the banks doth look, Then on the crystal current of the brook; Then with his feet he touch'd the silver streams, Whose drowsy waves made music in their dreams, And, for he was not wholly in, did weep, Talking aloud and babbling in their sleep . . . ... he did begin To strip his soft clothes from his tender skin. When straight the scorching Sun wept tears of brine, Because he durst not touch him with his shine . . . (827-40) The sexual play of the waters here derives from Sidney's Arcadia (217; 2. 1 1. 14). But these waves, weeping in their sleep, reveal a greater pathos</page><page sequence="10">10 COMPARATIVE LITERATURE STUDIES than Sidney's in their Caliban-like perception of a proximate mysterious bliss, and their presence expands the ironies of Hermaphroditus's false assumption of solitude.11 (Ovid focuses the pleasure of sexual watching - a good deal more dangerous and fierce than in Beaumont's titillated and titillating world - into a few lines about Salmacis only; no hint of erotic desire in the landscape supports or shares the intensity of her desire. ) But this pathos is rare in Beaumont's poem. More often a self' consciously jocular tone dominates: not only "Isn't this a pleasure to look upon?" but also "What a grand joke that we keep seeing these things!" - and extends to the characters' responses as well. Jove, describing to Astraea how he fell in love with Salmacis, disingenuously marvels at seeing the naked bather, and turns it into a kind of childish dirty- mindedness masked as awe, prefaced by a cautionary decency for which we don't often give Jove credit:12 When first he laid him downe, there was none neere him: (For he did call before, but none could heare him) But a faire Nymph was bathing when he wak'd, (Here sigh'd great Jove, and after brought forth) nak'd . . . (243-47) Beaumont's thematic interest, until Salmacis sees Hermaphroditus, lies in the depiction of a relaxed, amoral pleasure in which erotic intensity gives way to titillation; there is very little real drive for achieved sexual activity. But Ovid is interested precisely in such drive and in the ways that it bears upon, and undermines, individual identity. Ovid traces tensions among his characters partly through the dichot- omy of hiddenness and exposure, with its burdens of invasive violence, as when gods continually pierce the hidden solitude of nymphs and pursue them. Beaumont approaches the same issues, but he transforms the va- lence of a hiddenness that preserves identity into mere piquancy, and the taut emotions associated with exposure (in Ovid, for example, in the exposures of Io or Callisto) into the charm of visible objects. Beaumont relaxes the tensions of erotic vision that Ovid apprehends, and he does so by reorganizing and expanding brevities and obliquities in Ovid - if "reor- ganizes" is not too strong a verb for the contentedly loose and wandering treatment in the later piece.</page><page sequence="11">SAPPHO'S APPLES 11 The loose handling of ocular motifs in the poem, reflecting this diffuse and not particularly urgent sexuality, becomes more vigorous in the rela- tion between Salmacis and Hermaphroditus.13 The most crucial of these motifs is one that the poet ramifies at some length: the embarrassment, to the sexually innocent, of being seen, and the arousing effects of their blushes. Beaumont translates from Ovid to describe Hermaphroditus's blush, with the addendum linking the blush to shame: At her loose speach Hermaphroditus blusht: He knew not what love was, yet love did shame him, Making him blush, and yet his blush became him: Then might a man his shamefast colour see, Like the ripe apple on the sunny tree, Or Ivory dide o're with a pleasing red, Or like the pale Moone being shadowed. (660-66) Beaumont has no interest in the provenance of these similes further back than Ovid; his line about the moon's eclipse suggests either scant understanding of or scant interest in the human efforts to relieve the moon's eclipse, as Ovid depicts them. Nor is he much interested in the Ovidian implications of those three similes. Where then does Beaumont direct his attention? I can best suggest an answer by quoting from the profusion of reddenings elsewhere in the poem. Salmacis's overtures have so abashed Hermaphroditus that he bolts, to hide in the grass; this flight triggers a long monologue from Salmacis, in which Beaumont departs from his momentary fidelity to Ovid's text. The speech is di- rected half to herself, half to him, musing on his blushing erotic shyness but deflected again and again into the other reddenings of erotic arousal and boldness: Why wert thou bashfull, boy? . . . His eye is gray, so is the mornings eye, That blusheth alwayes when the day is nye. Then his gray eye's the cause: that cannot be: The gray-ey'd morne is farre more bold then he: For with a gentle dew from heavens bright towre, It gets the mayden-head of ev'ry flowre. . . .</page><page sequence="12">12 COMPARATIVE LITERATURE STUDIES Besides, his glorious eye is wondrous bright: So is the fierie and all-seeing light Of Phoebus, who at ev'ry mornings birth Blusheth for shame upon the sullen earth. Then that's the cause; and yet that cannot be: The fierie Sunne is farre more bold then he; He nightly kisseth Thaetis in the sea: All know the story of Leucothoe. His cheeke is red; so is the fragrant Rose, Whose boldnessse may be plainely seene in this, The ruddy Rose is not asham'd to kisse; For alwayes when the day is new begun, The spreading Rose will kisse the morning Sun. (747-78) In instance after instance, Salmacis takes a picture of reddening not from a specific literary text but from the larger, more general body of mythic perception which ancient literary texts used so variously; she tries to apply the example to herself; she finds that the language of myth can offer neither accurate descriptions nor causal analyses of her own experience; but she finds too that myths do circle around the issue about which she herself worries. First she hopes that the analogy between gray-eyed morn and gray-eyed youth (an analogy logical in the Greek cosmos, where the figurative sun's eye is also the literal eye of the god) will be a cause for Hermaphroditus's reticence. Yet "that cannot be," for the blush of the morning's eye, which is dawn, naturally and inevitably becomes a male boldness that takes the "mayden-head of ev'ry flowre." The natural world knows a fulfilled eroticism unavailable to the more human consciousness of the nymph, and the unspoken mythic premise of correspondence be- tween natural and human realms fails her. A similar thing happens with her invocation of Phoebus at dawn, when he "blusheth for shame upon the sullen earth." Salmacis immediately recognizes this as an inappropriate image for her condition, as well as an inappropriate description of Phoebus's reddening. Apollo, as she knows from Ovid, is involved in all sorts of visual-erotic intrigues, not least with Salmacis herself; the intrigues that Salmacis cites come from the same book of the Metamorphoses in which she herself resides, Book 4.14 The fieriness of the sun means male boldness, and fails to suggest any consola-</page><page sequence="13">SAPPHO'S APPLES 13 tion to the nymph for Hermaphroditus's reluctance. Salmacis gradually works her way round to the specific failures of consonance between myth as she understands it and her own erotic experience: (a) she takes redden- ing as a sign of abashedness, but the myths that she recites effectively identify it as forwardness; (b) she identifies boldness as a masculine qual- ity, but in her own case all the boldness of erotic drive is hers, and the youth disconcertingly bears the traditionally feminine condition of reti- cent apple on the topmost bough. Given these two difficulties in her efforts to adapt myth to her own case, it is significant that Beaumont does not give her the story of Aurora blushing as she rises from Tithonus's bed, her shame bringing the red dawn, although he gives to her so many of Aurora's mythic analogues. In fact Beaumont has already used Aurora (595-608), in a description of dawn that aligns her with Hermaphroditus in her purity, abashedness, and identification with light.15 But Aurora's blushing femininity will hardly suit Salmacis, who needs a natural and mythic image of a bold female rubescence. That sanctioning image she finds in the roses at the end of her speech - an image of feminine sexual experience that is prior to the possibility of human shame because the roses' easy spreading to the sun, passive and bold at the same time, exists in the realm of nature. Although Salmacis cannot know it, one reason that the rose analogy can satisfy her is that it bears echoes of Edmund Spenser's handling of myth; Spenser mediates between Ovid's comic-grotesque treatment of mythic tales and Beaumont's gossipy trivializations of them, and allows Salmacis a way out of her dilemma by providing her with an alternative language of myth. Her troubled movement of mind along all the stories of Phoebus's reddenings is also a movement between the Ovidian Apollo, who in human form has lively sexual exploits ("all know the story," says Salmacis), and Spenser's august Titan whose joyous rays make him the potent progenitor of natural processes. We have seen that Ovid's Clytie (Met. 4.190-273) falls in love with the anthropomorphic "son of Hype- rion," and her consequent fate is to turn, forever unfulfilled, toward the natural object which is the sun; much of the piquancy of Ovid's tale emerges from this hopeless doubleness of the god's human and solar forms, and from Ovid's insistence on keeping the two aspects distinct. But Spen- ser's Chrysogonee, to take one example from The Faerie Queene of a nymph loved by the sun, is impregnated by a benign force only partially personified:</page><page sequence="14">14 COMPARATIVE LITERATURE STUDIES It was vpon a Sommers shynie day, When Titan faire his beames did display, In a fresh fountaine, farre from all mens vew, She bath'd her brest, the boyling heat t'allay . . . Till faint through irkesome wearinesse, adowne Vpon the grassie ground her selfe she layd To sleepe, the whiles a gentle slombring swowne Vpon her fell all naked bare displayed; The sunne beames bright vpon her body playd, Being through former bathing mollifide, And pierst into her wombe, where they embayd With so sweet sence and secret power vnspide, That in her pregnant flesh they shortly fructifide. (FQ 3.6.6-7) Spenser blurs the sharp edges between human and solar aspects of the god, so that the sun's activity is a natural process, a fructifying rather than a rape. Chrysogonee herself is at this stage imperturbably simple; she is assimilated into the natural world when the ground welcomes her, one of the flowers spread naturally to the sun. (That her impregnation might prove a sexual wounding that leads to human consciousness, Spenser hints when she laments her pregnancy; but she delivers the twins un- awares, and slips out of Spenser's purview. ) This sense of the sun's fused natural and mythic potency, and of sunrise as bringer of energy and of a hallowed eros, pervades The Faerie Queene. It is this particular sense of myth, to which I will return, that Salmacis discovers as she works out the processes of the sun's time-bound and time- marking reddenings, a discovery that culminates in the loosely Spenserian image of the bold female roses turning willingly toward their celestial paramour. Beaumont's poem is a veritable encyclopedia of metamorphoses and examples of erotic vision and the related issues of exposure, shame, and visual pleasure (only a few of which I can attend to here). The poem is dedicated to Venus, and is dominated at the start by the "blisses" of Jove: over Astraea's throne, curiously, are painted "the wanton unseen stealths of amorous Jove" (214). But it is really Phoebus who presides over the poem as arch-lover and arch-observer, roles fused in the sun,</page><page sequence="15">SAPPHO'S APPLES 15 the eye of heaven, with his profiise dependent imagery of shining, reflect' ing, dazzling, of crystalline brooks and crystalline eyes, of mirrors that enkindle love by reflection in sometimes benign, sometimes pathological forms of narcissism. It is Phoebus who sees everything that goes on in terrestrial affairs, who sees Bacchus's attempts on Salmacis and who chivalrously saves her (but "against her will," 468), who provides the disingenuously innocent nymph with Hermaphroditus to look at, in lines that support her equivocal innocence by their Spenserian erotic diction. This diction is so important that it is worth quoting the lines again: . . . The Nymph was pleas'd with this, Hoping to reape some unaccustomed blisse By the sweet pleasure that she should enjoy, In the blest sight of such a melting boy. (539-42) Phoebus makes possible the Spenserian Aurora's entrance into the poem, by sending her to bring dawn while he lingers with Thaetis (573-92). Most important, Phoebus makes possible all the instances of natural red' dening that Salmacis considers in her long speech, thus assimilating the different blushes of both nascent sexual self-consciousness and of expert enced desire to the natural, recurrent events of sunrise and sunset. This is in part another Spenserian inflection of Ovidian language. Beaumont has first loosened the tensions of Ovidian drive in the comic beginning of his poem, and then dignified Salmacis's desire, made it appear more innocent and more natural than it does in Ovid.16 This he can do because of Spenser. Spenser is one of the chief transmitters of mythic language to writers of the late Renaissance (and, ultimately, to rehabilitators of myth in Ro- mantic and modern poetry). He can be so because The Faerie Queene is profoundly pervaded by the notion of metamorphosis, in so profoundly English a way. Leonard Barkan suggests that in The Faerie Queene "meta- morphosis is more than a wicked or an empty condition of false love: it is an essential condition of all love; and it forges a link among all the types of love" (Gods Made Flesh 239). More, metamorphosis is a condi- tion of individual identity, a mediating principle among divine, human, and natural aspects of the self, as in the cases of Chrysogonee and</page><page sequence="16">16 COMPARATIVE LITERATURE STUDIES Phoebus, who is both divine and natural. It may even be possible to conceive of benign metamorphosis in Spenser's poem as a steady-state condition, not a process of sudden change and contagion of boundaries but a fluent metaphor for human nature embracing its divine and natural aspects. How does the influence of Spenser's great metamorphic poem make itself felt in Beaumont's pleasant, unwieldy, and minor work? Spenser's mythic narrative redundancies, his frequent rehearsals of a mythic plot motif - like a virginal nymph surprised at her bath - make an issue of the poet's challenge to find a language adequate to his meaning. In Salmacis and Hermaphroditus, as we have seen, desire is much diffused and ex- panded from its Ovidian original; relaxed indulgence rather than obses- sion is desire's most frequent form, and even Salmacis's drive becomes less a compulsion than a Chaucerian urge to fulfill the law of kind, in another of her addresses to Hermaphroditus. This leisurely expansion of desire manifests itself as expansive clouds of allusion. Renaissance literary ideals of copiousness make possible Beaumont's dilations, as in the piled-up images of blushes and reddening, in her long speech. It is the very abun- dance of such images that puzzles Salmacis, and instigates her troubled fascination with language - specifically, with the difficulty of achieving an Ovidian precision that matches mythic allusiveness to individual expe- rience. Mythic language in Beaumont is instead a slippery mediator be- tween natural eros and human consciousness. Salmacis faces the chal- lenge of rhetorical invention: she contemplates a myth, finds something to say about it, "yet that cannot be," it is not a true thing for her to say. She struggles until the image of roses opening to the sun presents itself as an apt and unproblematic use of language, presenting the one correct dynamic of boldness and reserve, blushing and enkindling, activity and receptivity, male and female, that suits her condition and enables her actions. Beaumont's prolixity is one response to the Renaissance problem of invention: how does one find something new to say about old tales? How does one structure them into the syntax of a language that will suffice? Beaumont reflects on the problem by re-creating it for Salmacis, and finds one solution by diverging from Ovid's exact and controlled references to prior texts, toward that metalepsis that John Hollander has discussed as "echo metaphorical" (Figure of Echo 62f.). Beaumont wel-</page><page sequence="17">SAPPHO'S APPLES 17 comes Spenser's voice, Spenser's way with myths of the potent sun, into his own poem, where it resounds within the caves of Ovidian myth. Thus Salmacis's pleasure of anticipation at viewing the boy alludes to no specific Spenserian passage; Beaumont intends no single context of Spen- ser's to qualify his own. But he uses diction heavily reminiscent of erotic loci in The Faerie Queene: "hoping to reape . . . blisse"; "the sweet plea- sure . . . the blest sight of such a melting boy" (540-42). These echoes hover in the space above the Bower of Bliss, the Garden of Adonis, the Garden of Venus, the mythic tapestries of Faerie Queene 3, and Arlo hill where Faunus sees the blest sight of Diana.17 Beaumont's very use of these echoes is a mark of a cagey, perhaps irresponsible, indeterminacy in the text, for by using tropes that are more echo than allusion Beau- mont evades the Spenserian issues of guilty or innocent sexuality while invoking Spenser's opulent mythic language to sanction his own brand of narrative redundancy. "Echo metaphorical" acknowledges the domi- nant prior poet, Ovid. But it also answers the challenge of Ovid's pres- ence, by expanding myth's abundance into a flurry of echoic tales, and by invoking echoes of Spenser in order to transform the links among language, desire, vision, and exposure that Ovid figures with his allusive similes for the blush. Spenser's use of myth is characteristically anti-aetiological (and to that degree un-Ovidian). That is, he plots mythic stories not to show that a natural phenomenon occurs because of some primordial human or divine event, but to show that a human drive, once rectified, can be naturally eloquent. Britomart's first analogy for herself as horrified victim of love- sickness, for example, is Narcissus: she fears the potentially monstrous drive within herself (FQ 3.2.44). But Narcissus is less apt an analogue than the comically blushing Aurora whom Spenser grants her as a simile "both grand and charming" (Alpers, Poetry 394). 18 So with Beaumont's poem: his first fable of roses (45-54) tells how white roses, those that failed to blush with a maidenly pudor when Hermaphroditus lay down on them, were punished by being deprived of scent. To the extent that it is concerned with origins, that it is aetiological, this story is Ovidian. But the second fable of roses - Salmacis's image of their unashamed opening to the sun - drops the aetiological motive, and echoes instead a Spenseri- an mode of benign natural eros. The charm and natural delicacy of Sappho's sweet-apple blushing on the verge of sexual experience are</page><page sequence="18">18 COMPARATIVE LITERATURE STUDIES threatened and finally destroyed in Ovid's tale; this happens not only in the plot but also in the tightly controlled allusive context of the similes. Beaumont, unperturbed by Ovid's notions of eros, is less attentive to Sappho's sweet-apple than to the strong mythic reddenings of sexual arousal that Salmacis considers in her speech, until they culminate in an echoing Spenserian image that allows once again for a note of tenderness like that in Sappho. Salmacis's discovery of an apropos Spenserian image is like that of Wallace Stevens's protagonist in "Two Illustrations That the World Is What You Make of It": "The appropriate image of himself, / So formed, became himself and he breathed / The breath of another nature as his own" (Poems 513). Stevens is one of this century's most powerful theorists of the possible freshenings of enervated myth; like Spenser, he challenges and replenishes the mythic potency of the sun. In a late poem, "A MythoK ogy Reflects Its Region," Stevens suggests the challenges that faced Ovid and Beaumont, and their resolutions. Like Ovid in Augustan Rome and Beaumont in late Elizabethan England, Stevens "never lived in a time / When mythology was possible," certainly not an innocent mythology, free of self-consciousness. But if we had - That raises the question of the image's truth. The image must be of the nature of its creator. It is the nature of its creator increased, Heightened. It is he, anew, in a freshened youth And it is he in the substance of his region . . . (Opus Posthumous 118) Ovid acknowledges, indeed affirms, the problematic triviality of myth in a late age by treating it as gossip throughout the Metamorphoses. But the gossip is complicated by pervasive tones of both grotesqueness and pathos. Beaumont constructs, at the start of his poem, a charming trivialization of myth, mytlvas-entertainment without the tensions of Ovid's tales. In this we can say that Beaumont admits the potential depletion of myth, tales so old that they have become childish again. But with his echoes of Spenser, Beaumont anglicizes his myth and so makes it "the substance of his re- gion." By pressing the nature of the mythological image which can satisfy</page><page sequence="19">SAPPHO'S APPLES 19 only if it is "of the nature of its creator," Beaumont discovers a freshened youth in an etiolated myth. University of Notre Dame NOTES 1. Attribution of the 1602 poem is uncertain, but authorship is usually taken to be Beaumont's. Because the issue is moot, I have refrained from drawing on any of the dramatic work that we know is Beaumont's; in any case accurate attribution has no bearing on my argument. See Philip Finkelpearl, "The Authorship of 'Salmacis and Hermaphrodi- tus,' " Notes and Queries 214 (October 1969): 367-68. 2. Oration 1.16.

In this essay I have kept these generalizations brief; some of them are worked out in detail in my "The Mysteries of the Muses: Spenser and the Epic Tradition of the Goddess Observed," forthcoming in Spenser Studies. Virginity as a figure for unbroken solitude and integrity is central to all the tales in the Metamorphoses of nymphs pursued and taken by gods. The disaster of being unwillingly made visible is worked out, e.g., in Ovid's twin narratives about Callisto: Met. 2.409-65 and Fasti 2. 153-92; in the linked tales of Io and Argus, Met. 1.568-746; in Diana's response to Actaeon, Met. 3. 165-93. 5.

Keach provides the best study of the poem to date, as well as a general discussion of Beaumont's genre, passim. For this latter subject, see also Clarke Hulse, Metamorphic Verse: The Elizabethan Minor Epic (Princeton: Princeton UP, 1981). 10. The combination of sexual license and coy restraint that Salmacis exhibits is an anticipation of important motives in libertine poetry later in the seventeenth century. See William Kerrigan and Gordon Braden, "Milton's Coy Eve: Paradise Lost and Renaissance Love Poetry," English Literary History 53 (1986): 27-51, especially the discussion of the antifruition topos, 33-37. 11. Contrast the broader, less poignant treatment of the same motif by Marlowe: Neptune's attempt to seduce Leander in Hero and Leander: "He watched his arms, and as they opened wide / At every stroke, betwixt them he would slide / And steal a kiss, and then run out and dance, / And as he turned, cast many a lustful glance ..." (36; Sestiad 11.183-86). 12. This episode provides an interesting comic variant on the ancient motif of the goddess bathing, for which see Otis, Ovid 133f., 367-71, and Leonard Barkan, "Diana and Actaeon: The Myth as Synthesis," English Literary Renaissance 10, 3 (Autumn 1980): 317-59. 13. It is not only specular but also more purely ocular matters that take Beaumont's interest. Hence the bizarre episode of Venus's seizing of Cupid's eyes and implanting them in Hermaphroditus's face, rectifying the slight dullness of the latter's own eyes, 59-78. 14. In Ovid, Sol is not Apollo, and it is Sol the sun god who has these adventures. But in the Renaissance, the Ovidian sun is regularly taken to be Apollo, and I have followed this usage in discussing Renaissance works. 15. Beaumont would have known Spenser's Aurora simile for Britomart: . . . her pure yuory Into a cleare Carnation suddeine dyde; As faire Aurora rising hastily, Doth by her blushing tell, that she did lye All night in old Tithonus frosen bed . . . (FQ 3.3.20) An important function of the simile is to balance the hot congestion and confusion of Britomart's sexually abashed blush with the coolness of dawn's natural, inevitable, and benign qualities - one of the prime uses of mythic dawns, which Beaumont adapts in Salmacis's speech. Ricks suggests that "what the pathetic fallacy does is spare our blushes" (Keats 201). See other appearances of Aurora in FQ 1.2.7, 1.11.51; appearances of Phoebus, 1.2.1, 1.2.7; 1.5.2; 1.11.33-34; 1.11.51; 2.3.1; 2.11.3; 6.3.45. 16. It appears more innocent and natural partly because Salmacis cannily uses tradi- tional arguments about the need to fulfill the law of kind, 875-88. 17. At the heart of the Garden of Adonis, Venus is wont "often to enjoy / Her deare</page><page sequence="21">SAPPHO'S APPLES 21 Adonis ioyous company, / And reape sweet pleasure of the wanton boy" (3.6.46). See also FQ 2. 12 (the Bower of Bliss), 4. 10 (the Temple and Garden of Venus); 3. 12 (the tapestries depicting mythic loves in Busyrane's palace); the visions of Arlo Hill, 6.9 and 7.6. 18. It is not accidental that, when Britomart first sees and is smitten by the image of her future consort in a magic glass, he is said to look forth "as Phoebus face out of the east, / Betwixt two shadie mountains doth arize" (3.2.24).
