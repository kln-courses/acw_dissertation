<plain_text><page sequence="1">321 Ceramic Microtypology and the Territorial Expansion of the Early Monte Alban State in Oaxaca, Mexico Charles S. Spencer Elsa M. Redmond Christina M. Elson American Museum of Natural History The Late and Terminal Formative (ca. 300 b.c. to a.d. 200) was the crucial period during which the early Monte Alban state came into being and began to extend its political influ ence over a wide area in what is now the Mexican state of Oaxaca. One of the most distinc tive and frequent ceramic types of this period is the G12, which is agrayware (gris) bowl with characteristic incising on the interior rim and base. Originally defined by Alfonso Caso, Ignacio Bernal, and Jorge Acosta based on their excavations at Monte Alban, the G.12 bowl has also been found at many other Oaxacan sites. The incised motifs on the inte rior bases of G.12 bowls show substantial variability, but researchers have been uncertain whether any portion of this variability shows chronological patterning. We present a new microtypology of G.12 bowls based on our recent excavations at three sites near San Martin Tilcajete, some 27 km south of Monte Alban. Our analysis yields a finer-grained chronology that helps elucidate the step-by-step territorial expansion of the emergent Monte Alban state. Introduction The Late and Terminal Formative (approximately 300 b.c. to a.d. 200) was a period of dramatic change in Oax acan prehistory. It was preceded by the Early Monte Alban I phase (500-300 b.c.), during which the site of Monte Al ban was founded on a hilltop in the central part of the Oax aca Valley (Blanton 1978; Kowalewski et al. 1989). Begin ning in the Late Monte Alban I phase (300-100 b.c.) and continuing through the Monte Alban II phase (100 b.c.-a.d. 200), key characteristics of state organization such as a four-tiered setdement hierarchy, the palace, and the specialized multiroom temple?made their appearance and Monte Alban began to extend its influence over the rest of the Oaxaca Valley and some other surrounding re gions (Balkansky 1998, 2002; Blanton et al. 1999; Marcus and Flannery 1996; Sherman 2005; Spencer and Red mond 2001a, 2004a). Recent radiocarbon analyses have indicated that Monte Alban's conquest of certain distant regions such as the Canada de Cuicadan (fig. i) occurred surprisingly early, perhaps by the onset of the Late Monte Alban I phase (Spencer and Redmond 2001b). Such a result suggests models of early state formation in which aggressive terri torial expansion plays an important causal role (Algaze 1993; Carneiro 1970; Marcus 1992; Marcus and Flannery 1996; Spencer 1998; Webster 1975). At the same time, other research indicates that certain parts of the Oaxaca Valley that lay much nearer to Monte Alban than the Cana da were not incorporated into the early Zapotec state until later, perhaps not until the Monte Alban II phase (Elson 2007; Elson and Sherman 2007; Feinman and Nicholas 1990; Spencer and Redmond 2003, 2006). These results, taken together, imply that the emergent Monte Alban state expanded its territory through an asymmetrical process, a conclusion with implications for understanding early state formation in general. It is, however, important to empha size that the proposed timing of Monte Alban's expansion is tentative and requires additional confirmation and re finement.</page><page sequence="2">322 Ceramic Microtypology of Early Monte Alban in Oaxaca, Mexico/Spencer, Redmond, and Elson Figure 1.

Complete G.12 vessel (adapted from Caso, Bernal, and Acosta 1967: fig.l31a). We are in agreement with Wright's (2006) call for a re newed emphasis on the chronological refinement of se quences of early state formation from around the world. In the Oaxaca case, for example, we want to distinguish reli ably between occupations of the Early Monte Alban I, Late Monte Alban I, and Monte Alban II phases, a chronologi cal sequence that derives from the pioneering work of Al fonso Caso, Ignacio Bernal, and Jorge Acosta (1967). Ca so and his colleagues used a number of ceramic types? some rare and some abundant, with varying lifespans?to define these and other phases of occupation at Monte Al ban. Unfortunately, archaeologists conducting surface sur veys or excavating at valley-floor sites have found few of the rare ceramic types and thus relied on more abundant types to date occupations. Especially notable among these more abundant types is the G.12, a grayware (?fris) bowl with characteristic incising on the interior rim and base. Its high relative frequency and distinctiveness have long made it a favorite chronological indicator for Oaxaca archaeologists. Yet, as we explain in the next section, Caso, Bernal, and Acosta (1967) originally proposed that the G.12 lasted at least five centuries, encompassing both the Late Monte Al ban I and Monte Alban II phases, a lifespan that makes it difficult to use the G.12 by itself to distinguish between these phases. Although archaeologists have long been aware of considerable variation in the style and execution of G.12 incising, they have been uncertain whether any of this variation represented chronological patterning. We present here new data on chronological variation in the in cised decoration on G.12 bowls, derived from our recent excavations at three sites (El Mogote [SMT-lla], El Palenque [SMT-llb], and Cerro Tilcajete [SMT-23]) near the town of San Martin Tilcajete (henceforth Tilcajete), in the Ocotlan district of the Oaxaca Valley (fig. 2). These da ta help verify or refine the occupational sequences at these and other Late and Terminal Formative sites and relate to the broader issue of the development and territorial ex pansion of the Monte Alban state. The G.12 Grayware Bowl: Stylistic Variation, Microtypology, and Chronology The G.12 ceramic type was originally defined in La Cerdmica de Monte Alban (Caso, Bernal, and Acosta 1967: 25-26). They noted that the interior rim of a G.12 bowl was usually decorated with two incised lines while the in terior base often had incised designs that included concen tric circles, wavy lines, scalloped lines, zig-zags, and points. They illustrated several examples of complete G.12 bowls (Caso, Bernal, and Acosta 1967: figs. 130-131), showing the co-occurrence of incising on rims and bases (fig. 3). They also provided illustrations of G.12 sherds (Caso, Bernal, and Acosta 1967: figs. 4-6). Most of their illus trated sherds were either rims or bases, not rim-to-base sec tions, a situation that contemporary archaeologists usually face when they encounter G.12 sherds on survey or during excavation. Although Caso, Bernal, and Acosta used G.12 to refer to both the rims and bases, it has been noted that G.12-style double-line incising on rims does not always oc cur with G.12-style incising on bases; indeed, it appears that G.12-style rims started earlier and lasted longer than</page><page sequence="4">324 Ceramic Microtypology of Early Monte Alban in Oaxaca, Mexico/Spencer, Redmond, and Elson 0 10 cm Figure 4. Examples of G.12a incised bases. The designs were probably made with a thorn rather than a comb.

G.12-style bases (Kowalewski, Spencer, and Redmond 1978; Spencer and Redmond 1997: 166-167). We suspect that Caso, Bernal, and Acosta considered making a typo logical distinction between the incised rims and bases, be cause the figure captions for their figures 5 and 6 (which show incised bases) referred to the type as "G.14," even though each individual base was labeled "G.12" and C&lt;G.14" was never mentioned as a type in the body of the text. By contrast, the caption for their figure 3 (depicting incised rims) referred to the type as "G.12," as did the in dividual labels beneath the drawings. In the end, however, it is clear that Caso and his colleagues decided to use "G.1255 to refer to rim sherds with double-incised lines and also to the base sherds with the distinctive incising. When we conducted our analysis of ceramic samples from the ex cavations at the three Tilcajete sites, we decided to record separate frequencies for G.12 rim sherds, G.12 base sherds, and G.12 rim-to-base sherds. Oaxaca archaeologists have long noted that there is con siderable stylistic variation among the base sherds classified as G.12 (Caso, Bernal, and Acosta 1967: figs. 5-6). Dur ing our Tilcajete analysis, we were able to define three mi crotypes of G.12 incised bases that included the variability in our Tilcajete samples as well as that in the sample illus trated by Caso, Bernal, and Acosta (1967: figs. 5-6). We called the three microtypes G.12a, G.12b, and G.12c; ex amples of each microtype are illustrated here in our Figures 4, 5, and 6. Microtype G.12a consisted of base sherds that had been incised with a single or double thorn, not a fine toothed comb (fig. 4). Microtype G.12b represented base sherds with carefully executed fine combing, with minimal skipping or disjointed motifs (fig. 5). Examples of the G.12c microtype (fig. 6) were often (though not always) executed with a fine-tooth comb, but they were distinctive for having motifs that appeared incomplete or carelessly rendered, usually with notable skipping, or disjointed mo tifs. We called G.12c the "sloppy55 microtype; we surmised that it had been executed in a hastier, less meticulous fash ion than the G.12b. During our research we found that all analysts could readily classify most G.12 base sherds into one of these three microtypes, and we coded the hard-to classify examples as "indeterminate55 or "other.55 The chronology of the G.12 has been of considerable in terest to archaeologists. Caso, Bernal, and Acosta (1967: 25) noted that the G.12 first appeared in deposits of their "nivel lb55 (midway through their Epoca I), which would correspond to the interface between what Marcus and Flannery (1996: table 3) have called "Monte Alban la55 and "Monte Alban Ic55 Others have called these phases Monte Alban Early I and Monte Alban Late I (Blanton et al. 1982; Kowalewski et al. 1989) or the terms we use here: the Early Monte Alban I phase (500-300 b.c.) and the Late Monte Alban I phase (300-100 b.c.) (Spencer and Redmond 2001a). Caso, Bernal, and Acosta (1967: tabla VI) noted that the G.12 continued to be used during their Epoca II, what others have called Monte Alban II (100 b.c.-a.d. 200) (Marcus and Flannery 1996: table 3). Ca so, Bernal, and Acosta (1967: tablas II, XIII) also report ed that the G.12 persisted into their Epoca Ilia, called Monte Alban Ilia (a.d. 200-500) by Marcus and Flannery (1996: table 3). Caso and his colleagues viewed the occur rences of G.12 in Ilia contexts to be relatively infrequent "supervivencias de la Epoca II,55 i.e., "survivals55 from the Monte Alban II phase (Caso, Bernal, and Acosta 1967:</page><page sequence="5">Journal of Field Archaeology/Vol. 33, 2008 325 ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ . .

Recent extensive excavations in the Monte Alban Il ia occupation at Santo Tomas Jalieza (Casparis 2006; Lu ca Casparis, personal communication 2007) recovered no examples of G.12 (either rims or bases) associated with clear Monte Alban Ilia pottery types such as G.23, a gray ware bowl with carving on the exterior wall. G.12-style rims and bases have been reported over a large area of Oaxaca, including all major sections of the Oaxaca Valley (Kowalewski et al. 1989: fig. 6.1) as well as in surrounding regions, such as the Canada de Cuicatian (Spencer and Redmond 1997: figs. 4.60, 4.62, 4.64), the Sola Valley (Balkansky 2002: plates 3.1, 3.2), the Miahu adan Valley (Markman 1981: plate 5), the Mixteca Alta (Acosta and Romero 1992: fig. 51; Joyce et al. 2006: fig. 3), and the Pacific coast (Joyce, Winter, and Mueller 1998: figs. 2.13, 2.14). There is evidence that this wide distribu tion was probably not the result of large-scale exportation of G.12 bowls from a single production site. For example, neutron-activation analysis (NAA) found that some G.12 bowl sherds in the Canada de Cuicadan were produced in that region, though other G.12 examples were determined to be imports from the Oaxaca Valley (Redmond and Har bottle 1983). The NAA results discussed by Joyce and col leagues (2006) show that some G.12 bowls were exported from the Valley of Oaxaca to the Lower Rio Verde, the Mixteca Baja, and Mixteca Alta, while others were made lo cally in each region. Another NAA study concluded that G.12 bowls at the Late Monte Alban I phase site of El Palenque near San Martin Tilcajete were probably pro duced in the vicinity of that site, which lies in the northern part of the Ocotlan district, while G.12 bowls from the Yaasuchi site, in the southwestern-central Oaxaca Valley,</page><page sequence="6">326 Ceramic Microtypology of Early Monte Alban in Oaxaca, Mexico/Spencer, Redmond, and Elson CZZHKZZIJHEZZZ]* ^ Figure 6.

The top row of sherds was redrawn from Caso, Bernal, and Acosta 1967: fig. 5; the second row of sherds is from excavations at El Palenque; the third and fourth rows of sherds are from excavations at Cerro Tilcajete. were probably produced in that locality (Mine et al. 2007). A grayware production site dating to the Early and Late Monte Alban I phases was discovered through survey and excavation at San Agustin de las Juntas, also in the central Oaxaca Valley; it is likely that a series of grayware vessels, including G.12 bowls, were produced at this site (Feinman 1986; Winter 1984). A recent petrographic study of Oax acan graywares, which included examples of G.12 from Monte Alban, indicated that some G.12 bowls were made at Monte Alban itself, while others were evidendy pro duced at locations several km to the sw of Monte Alban (Fargher 2007: table 2). As Feinman and colleagues (1989: 331) point out, G.12 bowls were probably not high-status items; they were less elaborate and less variable in overall appearance than other contemporary vessels. The presence of broadly similar G.12 bowls over multiple regions probably reflects the exchange of stylistic information among producers and users in numerous locales, through modes of interaction that were relatively informal and not gready distorted by political interference. To draw a contrast, it is likely that the G.12 distribution during the Late Monte Alban I and Monte Alban II phases was less affected by political affilia tion between individual communities and Monte Alban than was the distribution of contemporaneous types of the cream or crema ware (e.g., C.2, C.6, C.7, C.ll, C.12, C.13, C.20); all crema wares were evidently produced with clay from deposits in the near vicinity of Monte Alban it self (Elson and Sherman 2007; Feinman 1982: 188-191; Flannery and Marcus 1994: 22; Joyce et al. 2006). Indeed, recent excavations of Monte Alban II phase kilns near the Main Plaza of Monte Alban yielded a predominance of these crema wares (Martinez Lopez and Markens 2004: 91; Markens and Martinez Lopez 2004). It has been observed that the relative frequency of such crema wares at sites of the Late Monte Alban I and Monte Alban II phases exhibits notable variation among different localities within the Oaxaca Valley (Elson and Sherman 2007; Spencer and Redmond 2006). For example, Kowalewski and colleagues (1989: 139) reported a Late Monte Alban I site (1-6-164-166), located ca. 12 km nw of Monte Alban and 5 km south of San Jose Mogote in the Etla-central area, which yielded a surface collection where in half of the sherds were composed of crema jars and bowls, followed by gray types, including G.12, as well as cafe (brownware) types. They drew a contrast with two other Late Monte Alban I sites: one of these (4-6-57, 59, 60) was situated about 7 km nw of Yegiiih in the Tlacolu la subvalley, while the other (3-6-136) lay 18 km sw of Tilcajete in the Ocotlan-Zimatlan subvalley (fig. i). Sur face collections at these two latter sites did not contain any crema sherds, though they did have sherds of G.12 bowls as well as examples of cafe ware. This ceramic pattern is consistent with the proposition that Monte Alban was more closely linked to the Etla-central area of the Oaxaca Valley than it was to the Tlacolula and Ocotlan-Zimatlan areas during the Late Monte Alban I phase (Feinman 1998: 128-129; Marcus and Flannery 1996: 163; Sher man 2005; Spencer and Redmond 2001a). In view of the possible effects of variable political affili ation on the distribution of crema wares, it would be help ful if a widely produced and distributed non-crema ware could be called upon to distinguish between Late Monte Alban I and Monte Alban II occupations. The G.12 is a candidate for this task, but what is needed is a finer-grained analysis of G.12 stylistic variation than has been conduct ed. Such an analysis requires excavated samples with reli able chronological assignments, as well as data on the dis tribution of stylistic variants among the samples. Such in formation is now available from our Tilcajete Project.

The three sites, which were lo cated by the Valley of Oaxaca Settlement Pattern Project (Blanton et al. 1982; Kowalewski et al. 1989), appear to have served sequentially as the first-order center for the Ocodan-Zimatlan subvalley during the Early Monte Alban I phase (El Mogote), the Late Monte Alban I phase (El Palenque), and the Monte Alban II phase (Cerro Tilcajete). As a consequence, we were able to recover abundant sam ples of pottery for each of these three phases, with negligi ble inter-phase disturbance. El Mogote was the largest site in the Ocotlan-Zimatlan subvalley during both the Rosario phase (700-500 b.c.), when it covered 25 ha, and the succeeding Early Monte Al ban I phase, when the occupation area grew to 52.8 ha. The Early Monte Alban I occupation featured a 2.2-ha plaza oriented 17 degrees east of magnetic north (fig. 7). Based on our excavations in Mounds A, K, and D?on the northern and eastern sides of the plaza?we conclude that the plaza itself was laid out at the transition between the Rosario and Early Monte Alban I phases. The plaza con struction project included the filling of depressions in the bedrock with trash, as exemplified by our Feature 6, which was stratigraphically beneath Mound K. Feature 6 pro duced a large sample of pottery and a radiocarbon age of 2490 ? 60 b.p. (Beta-98740), in uncalibrated radiocarbon years (all dates are uncalibrated unless otherwise indicat ed); this is equivalent to a conventional radiocarbon date of 540 b.c. ? 60, approximately at the end of the Rosario phase and beginning of the Early Monte Alban I phase (table i). A total of 369 diagnostic sherds (which includes all sherds except undecorated body fragments) were recorded in this feature. Of these, only two were recorded as G.12 rims with double-line incising; no G.12 incised bases were found in Feature 6. The El Mogote plaza and its associated buildings were occupied throughout the Early Monte Alban I phase. Among the constructions in use was Structure 1, a one room temple on Mound K, on the plaza's east side, and a high-status residential complex (Structures 10,12,13, and 18/19) on Mound A, on the plaza's north side (fig. 7). At the end of Early Monte Alban I, the El Mogote plaza was burned and abandoned. Our excavations found that the uppermost floors of the plaza and adjacent buildings were littered with charcoal and burned debris. One of these burned deposits, on the plaza surface near the southeastern base of Mound A, produced a radiocarbon age of 2280 ? 40 b.p. (Beta-147541), or a conventional radiocarbon date of 330 b.c. ? 40, near the end of the Early Monte Alban I phase (table 1).

The site's main plaza shows scant evidence of utilization during the Late Monte Alban I phase, when the focus of major public construction in the Tilcajete area had shifted some 800 m to the west and upslope to the El Palenque site. The ceramic samples we recovered in our excavations on the northern and east ern sides of the El Mogote plaza should therefore pertain only to the time period between the construction and the abandonment of the plaza, i.e., the Early Monte Alban I phase. As Table 2 indicates, out of the 6257 total diagnos tic sherds recovered in the plaza area excavations at El Mogote, 34 sherds (0.54%) were G.12 rim sherds, while 51 sherds (0.82%) were G.12 base sherds; no G.12 rim-to base sherds were found. Most of the G.12 base sherds (42 sherds or 82.35%) at El Mogote were recorded as our mi crotype G.12a (single or double thorn incised) (fig. 4). Only a few (4 sherds, 7.84%) of the G.12 bases were of mi crotype G.12b (fine combing), which became much more popular during the succeeding Late Monte Alban I phase. No examples of microtype G.12c were recovered at El Mogote. Our survey and excavations at the El Palenque site (fig. 8) indicate that the setdement was founded around 300 b.c., at the interface between the Early and Late Monte Al ban I phases, and was abandoned in the 1st century b.c., in the early years of the Monte Alban II phase (Spencer and Redmond 2005). The new plaza at El Palenque had the same orientation and a similar overall layout as the earlier one at El Mogote, and neither plaza closely resembles (ei ther in orientation or layout) the Main Plaza at Monte Al</page><page sequence="9">Journal of Field Archaeology/Vol. 33, 2008 329 Figure 8.

The total occupation in creased to 71.5 ha, including all of El Palenque and most of the residential sector (though not the plaza) of El Mogote. Thus, the size of the Ocotlan-Zimatlan subvalley first-order center at Tilcajete grew from 25 ha in Rosario phase, to 52.8 ha in Early Monte Alban I, and then to 71.5 ha in Late Monte Alban I. On the north side of the El Palenque plaza (at Mound I) we excavated the well-preserved remains of what we have interpreted as a palace, called the Area I palace, which covered some 850 sq m and was securely dated to the Late Monte Alban I phase (Spencer and Redmond 2004b). On the east side of El Palenque's plaza, at Mound G, we exca vated a Late Monte Alban I temple structure (Structure 16 in Area G) that is similar, though not identical, to the two room temples that Marcus and Flannery (1996: 182) have described for the later Monte Alban II phase (Spencer and Redmond 2006: fig. 2.7). We recovered several radiocarbon dates spanning the occupation of El Palenque in our excavation of Structure 7, one of nine interconnected structures that made up the en tire Area I palace (Spencer and Redmond 2004b). The ear liest sample from Structure 7 yielded a radiocarbon age of 2300 ? 80 b.p. (Beta-147540), or a conventional radio carbon date of 350 b.c. ? 80, near the interface between the Early and Late Monte Alban I phases (table i). The sample was a chunk of charcoal imbedded in the mud mor tar between foundation stones on the east side of Structure 7 in Area I. This charcoal probably resulted from burning associated with the clearing activities that preceded con struction on the previously unoccupied hillside; the char coal was probably added to the mud mortar during the building process. Another sample was a piece of charcoal lying on the floor of a room in Structure 7 of Area I; it pro duced a radiocarbon age of 2110 ? 60 b.p. (Beta-143354), or a conventional radiocarbon date of 160 b.c. ? 60, with</page><page sequence="10">330 Ceramic Microtypolqgy of Early Monte Alban in Oaxaca, Mexico/Spencer, Redmond, and Elson Table 2.

Yet an other sample was a piece of charcoal lying on a corridor surface between the south wall of Structure 7 and Structure 8 of Area I, a stone platform that overlooked the El Palenque plaza; it yielded a radiocarbon age of 2080 ? 60 b.p. (Beta-143351), or a conventional radiocarbon date of 130 b.c. ? 60, in the latter half of the Late Monte Alban I phase (table i). Our excavation in Area P, some 50 m west of the south western corner of the El Palenque plaza (fig. 8), exposed Structure 9, which was probably a high-status residence? although it covered just one-eighth the area of the Area I palace. Structure 9 had an associated midden (Feature 14) as well as a tomb (Burial 4) that contained three individu als, probably buried sequentially, accompanied by two grayware anthropomorphic urns, other vessels, and shell beads. A charcoal sample from one of the lower levels of the midden yielded a radiocarbon age of 2270 ? 70 b.p. (Beta-160901), or a conventional radiocarbon date of 320 b.c. ? 70, roughly contemporaneous with the aforemen tioned earliest date from Structure 7 (table i), indicating that the initial occupation of El Palenque was probably not limited to a small area. The occupation of El Palenque came to a sudden end in the latter part of the 1st century b.c. Evidence of burning was extensive across the uppermost levels of our excava tions. The patio of Structure 7 was among the areas with large deposits of charcoal, ash, and burned adobes and earth. A charcoal sample from the patio produced a radio carbon age of 1970 ? 60 b.p. (Beta-143355), or a con ventional radiocarbon date of 20 b.c. ? 60 (table i). Structure 16, the multiroom temple, had a similar deposit of ash, charcoal, and burned earth that probably formed when the structure was burned in the conflagration that marked the end of habitation at El Palenque. A charcoal sample from this deposit yielded a radiocarbon age of 1980 ? 70 b.p. (Beta-143353), or a conventional radiocarbon date of 30 b.c. ? 70, virtually identical to the final date from Structure 7 (table i). Our excavations on the north ern and eastern sides of the plaza, as well as those in Area P, Area Wl, and Area W2, indicate that the entire El Palenque site was abandoned in the 1st century b.c. Based on the radiocarbon dates, the time span repre sented at El Palenque runs from the middle of the 4th cen tury b.c. to the latter half of the 1st century b.c., corre sponding to the Late Monte Alban I phase and perhaps the</page><page sequence="11">Journal of Field Archaeology/Vol 33, 2008 331 first few decades of the Monte Alban II phase. Since a small number of potsherd types usually associated with Monte Alban II were found in the El Palenque excavations, it is not implausible that the occupation of the site lasted a few years into that phase (Spencer and Redmond 2004a). As Table 2 shows, out of the total of 12,861 diagnostic sherds excavated at El Palenque, 2790 (21.69%) were G.12 rim sherds, 2425 (18.86%) were G.12 base sherds, and 68 (0.53%) were G.12 rim-to-base sherds. In contrast to the El Mogote samples, very few (8 sherds or 0.32%) of the G.12 base sherds were recorded as microtype G.12a (sin gle or double thorn incised) (fig.4). Nearly all (2384 sherds or 95.63%) of the G.12 base sherds were recorded as microtype G.12b (fine combing) (fig. 5). A smaller number (48 sherds or 1.93%) of the G.12 base sherds were examples of microtype G.12c (sloppy combing) (fig. 6). When El Palenque was abandoned in the 1st century b.c., Cerro Tilcajete was founded atop a hill less than 1 km to the north (fig. 2). Excavations conducted by Elson (2003, 2006, 2007) revealed that Cerro Tilcajete (fig. 9) was occupied throughout the Monte Alban II phase, at the end of which (ca. a.d. 200) the site was abandoned. Elson (2003: table 5) reported numerous examples of well known Monte Alban II pottery types in her excavation samples, including incised crema types C. 11 and C. 12 (Ca so, Bernal, and Acosta 1967: 68), painted amaritto type A.9 (Caso, Bernal, and Acosta 1967: 70) and incised gris type G.21 (Caso, Bernal, and Acosta 1967: 67). The G.21 type (Caso, Bernal, and Acosta 1967: fig. 43) has incising on the interior base, but it differs from G.12 in that G.21 in cising consists of wider lines that seem to have been exe cuted not with a comb or thorn but with a stick (estaca) or a piece of cane (carrizo), when the clay was dry but before firing (Caso, Bernal, and Acosta 1967: 67). At Cerro Tilcajete, Elson excavated a number of struc tures, among them a two-room temple (Structure 2) very similar to those previously reported for the Monte Alban II and later phases at Monte Alban and San Jose Mogote (Elson 2003: fig. 41) (fig. i). Two plazas at the site were defined, and excavations in both of them recovered radio carbon samples dating to the Monte Alban II phase. In Plaza II, the excavation of Structure 1 on Mound A (a high-status residence) produced a sample that yielded a ra diocarbon age of 1870 ? 70 b.p. (Beta-143356), or a con ventional radiocarbon date of a.d. 80 ? 70 (table i). In Plaza I, a plaster floor was exposed deep beneath Mound E; associated with this floor was a sample that produced a radiocarbon age of 1810 ? 60 b.p. (Beta-165487), or a conventional radiocarbon date of a.d. 140 ? 60 (table i), near the end of the Monte Alban II phase. Elson (2003, 2007) has proposed that Cerro Tilcajete functioned as a secondary administrative center of the Monte Alban state during the Monte Alban II phase. With an occupation covering some 24.5 ha at this time, Cerro Tilcajete was less than half the size of the Late Monte Al ban I occupation that was focused on El Palenque?a dra matic reversal of the aforementioned centuries-long trend toward greater population nucleation at the first-order cen ter in the Tilcajete locality. The rest of the Monte Alban II phase population in the Ocotlan-Zimatlan subvalley was mostly distributed in a series of modest-sized villages (Kowalewski et al. 1989: fig. 7.23). Cerro Tilcajete sits on a high ridge overlooking the Ocotlan-Zimatlan subvalley and has an uninterrupted vi sual connection to Monte Alban; our survey mapped a well-preserved road that ascended the ridge from the Monte Alban side, passed through Cerro Tilcajete, and then descended toward the Tilcajete locality and the Ocodan-Zimatlan subvalley proper (fig. 9). Consistent with Elson's interpretation of the site as an administrative center under Monte Alban's control are not only the afore mentioned two-room temple but also an increase in the rel ative frequency of slipped and/or painted crema ceramics (as noted earlier, probably produced at or very near Monte Alban) at Cerro Tilcajete compared to the earlier occupa tions at El Mogote and El Palenque. Figure 10 presents a line graph showing the relative frequency of slipped/paint ed crema potsherds from excavated Early Monte Alban I deposits at El Mogote, Late Monte Alban I deposits at El Palenque, and Monte Alban II deposits at Cerro Tilcajete; these data are compared to excavated samples for the same three phases from Monte Alban. The relative frequency was computed by dividing the total number of crema pot sherds with slipped or painted surface treatments by the to tal number of diagnostic potsherds in the sample; diag nostic potsherds are all potsherds except undecorated body sherds. The crema types used in the analysis included C2, C.4, C.5, C.6, C.7, C.ll, C.12, C.13, and C.20, following the typology of Caso, Bernal, and Acosta (1967). The Monte Alban data come from Tabla I in Caso, Bernal, and Acosta (1967: 97-98), which presents the relative fre quencies of ceramic types from the "P.S.A." excavations. In Figure 10, the Early Monte Alban I (la) sample comes from Pozo 18 (Bolsa # 73), the Late Monte Alban I (Ic) sample is from Pozo 17 (Bolsa # 398), and the Monte Al ban II sample is from Pozo 16 (Bolsa # 326). Between Early Monte Alban I and Late Monte Alban I, the propor tion of crema wares holds steady in the Monte Alban sam ples; by contrast, the Tilcajete samples show a decline in the proportion of crema wares between Early Monte Alban I and Late Monte Alban I, followed by a sharp increase in Monte Alban II (fig. 10). The results are consistent with a</page><page sequence="12">332 Ceramic Microtypology of Early Monte Alban in Oaxaca, Mexico/Spencer, Redmond, and Elson X.

Relative frequency of slipped/painted crema ceramics in Early Monte Alban I (Early MA I), Late Monte Alban I (Late MA I), and Monte Alban II (MA II) phases at Monte Alban (top line) and the Tilcajete sites (bottom line). Data from El Mogote (Early MA I) and El Palenque (Late MA I) are from excavations directed by Charles S. Spencer and Elsa M. Redmond. Data from Cerro Tilcajete (MA II) are from excavations directed by Christina M. Elson (2003, 2007).

Monte Alban data on relative fre quencies are from Caso, Bernal, and Acosta (1967: tabla I). pattern of reduced interaction between the Tilcajete sites and Monte Alban that not only continued but declined fur ther between Early Monte Alban I and Late Monte Alban I. A reversal then followed, as the proportion of crema wares in the Tilcajete sample rose abruptly, probably re flecting an increase in interaction between Monte Alban and the Tilcajete area from Late Monte Alban I to Monte Alban II, when it appears that the Tilcajete area was inte grated into the Monte Alban state (Elson 2006, 2007). Because Elson found that Cerro Tilcajete (particularly the Plaza I area) was partially reoccupied during the Monte Alban Illb-IV phase (a.d. 500-1000), our analysis of G.12 sherds utilizes deposits that date unequivocally to the Monte Alban II phase. These include samples excavated from Structure 1, Area A (on Mound A); Structure 3 and Feature 1 from Area C; and Structure 4 on Terrace 171 (fig. 9). Structures 1 and 3 are associated with Plaza II and are interpreted as high-status residences; Feature 1 was a midden associated with Structure 3. Some 260 m south of Plaza II lay Structure 4 on Terrace 171, which was resi dential in character; its inhabitants were probably of a somewhat lower status than those of Structures 1 and 3 (Elson 2003, 2007). As Table 2 shows, out of the total of 7520 diagnostic sherds in these samples, 530 (7.05%) were G.12 rims and 340 (4.52%) were G.12 bases. No ex amples of microtype G.12a were recorded. A bit less than half (162 sherds or 47.65%) of the G.12 base sherds were recorded as microtype G.12b (fine combing) (fig. 5). Just under a quarter (76 sherds or 22.35%) of the G.12 base sherds were noted to be microtype G.12c (sloppy comb ing) (fig. 6). Chronological Patterning in G.12 Bases Since our radiocarbon dates support the proposition that El Mogote, El Palenque, and Cerro Tilcajete were se quential occupations, we can bring the ceramic samples from these sites direcdy to bear on the problem of G.12 chronology. In Figure 11 one can see that G.12 bowl sherds (both rims and bodies) achieved their highest rela tive frequency during the occupation of El Palenque (Late</page><page sequence="14">334 Ceramic Microtypology of Early Monte Alban in Oaxaca, Mexico/Spencer, Redmond, and Elson 451-1 40- - ? 35 i M S 30 i I 1x- - i- - 0\- - -^^B--, El Mogote El Palenque Cerro Tilcajete Figure 11.

Monte Alban I phase), with the rims and bases together amounting to 41.08% of the diagnostic sherds at that time. G.12 sherds are present less frequently at Cerro Tilca jete; the G.12 rims and bases constitute 11.57% of the di agnostics in the Monte Alban II phase sample from that site. G.12 sherds (rims and bodies) are very rare indeed in the Early Monte Alban I deposits at El Mogote, adding up to just 1.36% of the diagnostics. One can reasonably infer from these data that the G.12 bowl was largely a Late Monte Alban I and Monte Alban II type, a conclusion that would agree with long-held views in Oaxaca archaeology. Using G.12 sherds to distinguish between Late Monte Al ban I and Monte Alban II phase deposits is a more chal lenging problem, however. Although we have document ed a substantial decline in relative G.12 frequency between the two phases, there is sufficient representation in each phase to make it unwise to use the frequency of G.12 sherds to date a surface collection or a small excavated sam ple to either the Late Monte Alban I phase or Monte Al ban II phase exclusively. A finer-grained analysis is needed and is provided by the relative frequencies of G.12 mi crotypes in the samples from the three sites. There is a pronounced asymmetry in the distribution of microtypes G.12a, G.12b, and G.12c among the excavated samples at El Mogote, El Palenque, and Cerro Tilcajete (fig. 12). Most notably, G.12a (thorn incised) bases are al most entirely restricted to the El Mogote samples, all of which derived from excavations in the structures hning the northern and eastern sides of the plaza; as we have noted, this plaza was burned and abandoned around 300 b.c., at the end of the Early Monte Alban I phase. Since no G.12 bases at all were found in the Feature 6 sample (dating to ca. 500 b.c., the onset of Early Monte Alban I), we suspect that G.12a bases appeared toward the end of the Early Monte Alban I phase, when they were the most frequent G.12 microtype. G.12b (finely combed) bases made their appearance as a minority microtype before the end of the Early Monte Alban I phase, but they surged in popularity during the Late Monte Alban I phase and came to vasdy outnumber G.12a bases, which became very rare in the Late Monte Alban I phase and disappeared by the Monte Alban II phase. G.12c (sloppily combed) bases made their earliest appearance in our Late Monte Alban I phase sam ple from El Palenque; though more numerous than G.12a bases, they were still overwhelmed by the predominant G.12b bases. In the Monte Alban II phase sample from Cerro Tilcajete, the relative frequency of G.12c bases grew dramatically while G.12b bases waned, although G.12b bases continued to be more numerous overall. Our results could be helpful to archaeologists who seek to distinguish among occupations of the Early Monte Al ban I, Late Monte Alban I, and Monte Alban II phases. We recognize that the Tilcajete samples were large and were from excavated proveniences for which we had relatively secure chronological control and, ideally, we would rec ommend that others compare our results with similar ex cavated samples. Nevertheless, some of the features of our analysis should be useful even if one is faced with a small excavated sample or a surface collection. For example, we suggest that the presence of one or more G. 12a base sherds in a small sample or collection constitutes evidence of a</page><page sequence="15">Journal of Field Archaeology/Vol. 33, 2008 335 highly-probable occupation dating to the late years of the Early Monte Alban I phase, but not later. G.12b occurs over a wider time span and is less useful for chronological purposes; nevertheless, its relative frequency varies consid erably, which allows for chronological assessments of vary ing levels of probability. We suggest that the presence of one or a few G.12b sherds in a sample would point to a Late Monte Alban I occupation of relatively high proba bility, a Monte Alban II occupation of medium probabili ty, or an Early Monte Alban I occupation of very low prob ability. The presence of one or a few G. 12c sherds in a sam ple is much more likely to represent a Monte Alban II oc cupation than a Late Monte Alban I occupation; it is not likely at all to represent an occupation earlier than the Late Monte Alban I phase. Broader Implications The results of our G.12 analysis might also have impli cations for the study of broader issues that call for fine grained dating of Late/Terminal Formative occupational sequences. To illustrate, let us explore one of these issues: the territorial expansion of the Monte Alban state, a topic of considerable interest and debate among Oaxaca scholars (Balkansky 1998, 2001; Flannery and Marcus 2003; Joyce 2004; Joyce et al. 2000; Marcus and Flannery 1996; Red mond and Spencer 2006; Sherman 2005; Spencer 2007; Zeitlin 1990; Zeitlin and Joyce 1999). Spencer (2006, 2007) has proposed a two-stage model of this process that sees Monte Alban annexing the Canada de Cuicatlan, the Petioles area, and the Sola Valley during the Late Monte Alban I phase and then expanding the range of its control during the Monte Alban II phase to include the Ocotlan Zimatlan and Tlacolula subvalleys as well as the Ejuda and Miahuatlan valleys, Ocelotepec, Chiltepec, Nejapa, and possibly the Tututepec areas (fig. 13). Spencer and Red mond (2003, 2006) have discussed the various resistance strategies that the polities in the Ocotlan-Zimatlan and Tlacolula subvalleys may have used to withstand Monte Alban throughout the Late Monte Alban I phase. In the Canada de Cuicatlan, several lines of evidence (in cluding the abrupt relocation of settlements accompanied by violence, reorganization of local social and political or ganization, restructuring of local economic activities, and imposition of an oppressive foreign ideology), support the proposition that the Canada was conquered by Monte Al ban around 300 b.c. and remained in a subordinate rela tionship until approximately a.d. 200 (Spencer and Red mond 1997, 2000, 2001b). This interpretation is consis tent with Marcus's (1976,1980,1983) hypothesis that the inscription on Lapida 47 on Monte Alban's Building J refers to a conquest of the Canada. During the 1977-1978 Canada Project (Spencer and Redmond 1997), excava tions were carried out at two major components of the La Coyotera site (Cs25) (fig. i): Llano Perdido, occupied during the Perdido phase (750-300 b.c.), corresponding to the Rosario and Early Monte Alban I phases; and Loma de La Coyotera, inhabited during the Lomas phase (300 b.c.-a.d. 200), corresponding to the Late Monte Alban I and Monte Alban II phases. The Llano Perdido occupation pre-dates the proposed takeover of the Canada by the Val ley Zapotec; the village was burned and completely aban doned, after which settlement was shifted to the Loma de La Coyotera ridge that overlooks the earlier village (Red mond 1983: fig. 48). The latest radiocarbon sample we re covered from the Llano Perdido site yielded a radiocarbon age of 2370 ? 100 b.p. (Beta-143347), or a conventional radiocarbon date of 420 b.c. ? 100, and a 2-Sigma cali brated result of 790-195 b.c. (Spencer and Redmond 2001b: table 1). The earliest radiocarbon sample we exca vated from the Loma de La Coyotera site produced a ra diocarbon age of 2170 ? 70 b.p. (Beta-143349), or a con ventional radiocarbon date of 220 b.c. ? 70, and a 2-Sig ma calibrated result of 390^0 b.c. (Spencer and Red mond 2001b: table 1). The midpoint of the overlap be tween this pair of 2-Sigma ranges is approximately 300 b.c. (Spencer and Redmond 2001b: fig. 8). It is notable, and consistent with the radiocarbon dates, that G.12 bases were not found at Llano Perdido, while excavations at Lo ma de La Coyotera produced many G.12 bases, including examples of what we would now call G.12a bases (Spencer and Redmond 1997: fig. 4.64: SI-148, fig. 4.65: SI-156) and G.12b bases (Spencer and Redmond 1997: fig. 4.64: SI-146, SI-147). A comparison of excavated midden de posits reveals an increase in the relative frequency of im ported Oaxaca Valley crema wares from 2.55% of the di agnostic sherds of the Perdido phase to 6.77% of the di agnostic sherds of the Lomas phase (Spencer and Red mond 1997: table 4.2), a likely indication of greater inter action between Monte Alban and the inhabitants of this Canada community after 300 b.c. At roughly the same time as the abandonment of Llano Perdido, the plaza area of El Mogote at Tilcajete was burned and abandoned (ca. 300 b.c.). Unlike Llano Perdi do, however, much of the residential zone of El Mogote continued to be occupied after the plaza was burned. We found G.12b bases in 22 of our 54 controlled, intensive surface collections at El Mogote; the distribution has a "doughnut ring35 shape, with the plaza area located in the "doughnut hole" of the distribution, where G.12b bases were absent. Spencer and Redmond (2003, 2006) have proposed that El Mogote was attacked around 300 b.c., probably by forces from Monte Alban, but they have also</page><page sequence="16">336 Ceramic Microtypology of Early Monte Alban in Oaxaca, Mexico/Spencer, Redmond, and Elson /^"^^ ^%caRaoaoecujcatlAn v Nochiictt&amp;n ] . ) v^l Monte Negro A. goSC**^ ^^^^ ^^j^^ Figure 13. Two-stage model of Monte Alban's territorial expansion: the solid line shows the proposed extent of territory dominated by Monte Alban during the Late Monte Alban I phase (300-100 b.c.), which expanded during the Monte Alban II phase (100 b.c.-a.d. 200) to include the area bounded by the dashed line. (Map redrawn from Spencer 2007: fig. 3.2; base map redrawn from Marcus and Flan nery 1996: fig. 242). argued that Tilcajete's inhabitants, in contrast to those of the Canada, appear to have withstood the attack. They re built their plaza on a higher, more defensible ridge, at the El Palenque site, and continued to resist Monte Alban un til the 1st century B.C. Among their resistance strategies were: an increasing nucleation of population at the first-or der center, from 25 ha in the Rosario phase to 52.8 ha in the Early Monte Alban I phase, then to 71.5 ha in the Late Monte Alban I phase; a continuation between Early Monte Alban I and Late Monte Alban I of the traditional Tilcajete plaza layout, distinct in orientation and configuration from that of Monte Alban; the development of secondary state organization at Tilcajete by Late Monte Alban I (palace, multiroom temple, four-tier settlement pattern in the Ocotlan-Zimatlan subvalley) (Spencer and Redmond 2004a, 2004b); and reduced interaction between the Tilca jete locality and Monte Alban between the Early Monte Al ban I and Late Monte Alban I phases, as evidenced by the aforementioned crema ceramic data (fig. io). Further more, because G.12a sherds were recovered from the plaza area of El Mogote, but not from the Llano Perdido site in the Canada, we conclude that the proposed attack on Llano</page><page sequence="17">Journal of Field Archaeology/Vol. 33, 2008 337 Perdido, while roughly contemporaneous, nonetheless must have preceded the abandonment of the El Mogote plaza?by an unknown number of years, but probably sometime in the final decades of the Early Monte Alban I phase. Turning now to the Mixteca Alta, Balkansky, Perez Ro driguez, and Kowalewski (2004) have asserted that the site of Monte Negro (fig. 13) was probably not part of Monte Alban's expanded polity during the Early Ramos phase (corresponding to the Late Monte Alban I phase). Rather, it is more likely that Monte Negro was a center of Mixtec resistance against Monte Alban, which appears to have ex panded into the northern part of Penoles, partially pene trating the Mixteca Alta. Finsten (1996: 84) noted pottery "virtually indistinguishable from vessel fragments found at contemporary Valley of Oaxaca settlements55 dating to the Late Monte Alban I and Monte Alban II phases at sites "along a communications corridor that must have been im portant to the Monte Alban state.55 Monte Negro covered some 78 ha in the Early Ramos phase and contained a population of some 2500-5000 people, making it the largest site of its time in the Tilan tongo area. It was located on a steep-sided, defensible hill top, 2600 m in elevation and some 500 m above the valley floor (Balkansky et al. 2000; Balkansky, Perez Rodriguez, and Kowalewski 2004). Monte Negro was preceded by the Late Cruz phase (750-300 b.c.) center of La Providencia, which sprawled over 91 ha on a lower hilltop a few kilo meters to the ne (Balkansky, Perez Rodriguez, and Kowalewski 2004: fig. 6). The ceramic assemblage at Monte Negro includes materials associated with the Late Monte Alban I phase, including G.12 bowl sherds and G.17 "fish plate55 sherds (Balkansky, Perez Rodriguez, and Kowalewski 2004: 50-51), but no materials associated with the Monte Alban II phase. They conclude that the oc cupation of Monte Negro corresponds "to the Ic phase (that for us would include the transitional, seldom-used, and brief lb phase)55 (Balkansky, Perez Rodriguez, and Kowalewski 2004: 51). Let us use our G.12 base microtypology to compare the timing of Monte Negro's founding to the burning and abandonment of Llano Perdido in the Canada and the El Mogote plaza at Tilcajete. Illustrations of two G.12 base sherds are presented by Balkansky, Perez Rodriguez, and Kowalewski (2004: fig. 12c); they are both examples of what we would call G.12b bases, implying a Late Monte Alban I phase occupation contemporaneous with El Palenque and Loma de La Coyotera. Excavations conduct ed in the 1930s by Alfonso Caso yielded a large ceramic sample, including what we would call G.12a bases (Acosta and Romero 1992: figs. 51b, 51c) and G.12b bases (Acos ta and Romero 1992: figs. 51a, 5 Id), but no examples of our G.12c bases. We would consequendy align the aban donment of La Providencia and the founding of Monte Negro with the attack on Llano Perdido and the founding of Loma de La Coyotera in the Canada, but with an im portant difference: the new site in the Canada was proba bly under Monte Alban's thumb while Monte Negro re mained autonomous and continued to resist. Balkansky (2002) has argued that his survey data from the Sola Valley, about 75 km sw of Monte Alban (fig. 13), indicate that this region was also brought under Monte Al ban's control by Late Monte Alban I. Whereas the Early Monte Alban I phase in the Sola Valley was a time of sparse occupation (a single small site), the Late Monte Alban I phase saw a major influx of settlement, associated with ce ramics that closely resemble those of the Oaxaca Valley, in cluding G.12 bowls (Balkansky 2002: 37, plate 3.2). His analysis demonstrated that the distribution of Late Monte Alban I sites does not correspond to the distribution of the best quality agricultural soils (Balkansky 2002: 42). Not ing that several key sites are located along what would have been the major route between the Oaxaca Valley and the Pacific coast, he suggested that "Monte Alban's expansion into the Sola Valley seems intended to control this bound ary region for its access to the coast55 (Balkansky 2002: 84). He concluded that the Sola Valley continued to be domi nated by Monte Alban through the Monte Alban II phase (Balkansky 2002: 95). Monte Alban's sphere of control appears to have ex panded still further in the Monte Alban II phase, and may have eventually covered as much as 20,000 sq km (Marcus and Flannery 1996: 206). Among the areas that were pos sibly subjected to Monte Alban's expansionistic designs was Tututepec, on the Pacific coast (fig. 13). Marcus (1976) proposed that the conquest slab inscription on Lapida 57 of Building J at Monte Alban referred to Tu tutepec. Marcus and Flannery (1996: 201) drew attention to pottery from the Tututepec region that showed a close relationship with Monte Alban I and Monte Alban II pot tery (DeCicco and Brockington 1956: 59). Yet, investiga tors working recently in the Tututepec area (Workinger 2002) and in the Lower Rio Verde zone (fig. 13) (Joyce, Winter, and Mueller 1998) have suggested that the Pacific coast may have had a somewhat different relationship to Monte Alban than the Canada or the Sola Valley. We sus pect that Monte Alban utilized a variety of military, diplo matic, and economic tactics as it sought to expand its in fluence; moreover, it undoubtedly encountered a range of responses from the various target regions. Some regions may have capitulated outright, others may have negotiated an uneasy truce nourished by tribute payments, and still</page><page sequence="18">338 Ceramic Microtypology of Early Monte Alban in Oaxaca, Mexico/Spencer, Redmond, and Elson other regions may have been drawn into exchange rela tionships that were less favorable to them than to Monte Alban. In any case, the regions over which Monte Alban managed to exert some form of dominance by the Monte Alban II phase probably included not only the Ocotlan-Zi matlan and Tlacolula subvalleys of the Oaxaca Valley, but also Ejuda (Feinman and Nicholas 1990), Miahuatlan (Brockington 1973; Markman 1981), Nejapa, and Ocelotepec (Marcus and Flannery 1996: 199-202). Addi tional research in all these areas would do much to help clarify the nature of their relationships with Monte Alban during the Late Monte Alban I and Monte Alban II phases. Conclusion The ceramic data are consistent with a model of asym metric territorial growth of the emergent Monte Alban state, which sees Monte Alban launching a campaign of ag gressive extra-valley expansion to the north, west, and southwest at the beginning of the Late Monte Alban I phase (ca. 300 B.C.), while the eastern (Tlacolula) and southern (Ocotian-Zimatlan) subvalleys within the Oaxaca Valley continued to resist. Moreover, our comparison of G.12 microtypes at Tilcajete versus those in the Canada and at Monte Negro leads to a finer-grained conclusion: that Monte Alban commenced its extra-valley expansion even earlier than the action which led to the abandonment of El Mogote's plaza and the construction of a new plaza at El Palenque by the resisting Tilcajete leadership. The eventual annexation of the Tilcajete area by Monte Alban came much later, in the first century of the Monte Alban II phase (ca. 20-30 B.C.). The overall picture is of an emer gent Monte Alban state that found it feasible to expand in to weaker but more distant regions before bringing its nearer but more daunting rivals in the Oaxaca Valley under its political control. At the same time, the conquest of dis tant regions like the Canada would surely have posed ma jor administrative and military challenges. Monte Alban seems to have responded to such challenges by developing a more complex political and military organization during the course of the Late Monte Alban I phase, a transforma tion that could have been financed, in part, by tribute ex acted from the conquered areas. By the onset of the Monte Alban II phase, an increasingly powerful Monte Alban turned its sights on lingering centers of intra-valley resis tance (such as Tilcajete), and it was not long before the en tire Oaxaca Valley was incorporated, along with other re gions, into the expansive Monte Alban state.
