<plain_text><page sequence="1">Religion: Japan. Aston 23 Ancestor-worship in Japan. By W. G. Aston. Both "ancestor" and "worship" are ambiguous terms. The ancestor may be the ancestor of the individual or a deceased forefather of the race. In the latter case, it would perhaps be better to use some such word as hero worship. The mere racial ancestor is worshipped not qua ancestor but for his services or merits, real or supposed. Worship may be of a mere man, alive or dead, in which case it is not religion, or of a deity. Shinto, the old native religion of Japan, had no cult of true ancestors, whether of the individual or of the race. The greater gods are not deified human beings but nature deities, as the sun, the moon, the wind, the rainstorm, the earth, the process of growth, &amp;c. Even the minor Kami, when not themselves obviously elemental deities are for the most part satellites or children of gods of this class though some are at the same time deified types of classes of human beings. There is no clear case of a deified individual man. An official collection of prayers and other religious formul~ made early in the tenth century contains none addressed to true ancestors and makes no reference to a continued life after death. Shinto had no funeral service, that which is now so called being an innovation dating from 1868. It would have been inexpressibly shocking to an ancient Japanese to see a Shinto priest take part in any ceremonial connected with death. The institution of adoption, so common in modern Japan, was unknown in ancient times. As this custom had for its chief object the maintenance of the worship of the ancestors of the family, its absence from ancient Shinto has a significance which will be readily recognised. Whence, therefore, comes the widespread belief, not only in Japan but even in this country, that Shinto is or is based on ancestor worship ? In Japan and China Captain Brinkley says: "Ancestor-worship was the basis of Shinto. The divinities, whether "celestial or terrestrial, were the progenitors of the nation, from the Sovereign and the "princes surrounding the throne to the nobles who discharged the services of the State [35]</page><page sequence="2">No. 23.] MAN. [1906. " and the soldiers who fought its battles." Let us examine first the case of the Sovereign viz., the descent of the Mikados from Amaterasu. It is this to which reference is made in the Times and in Reuter's telegrarns when the latter is called " the first Imperial Ancestor" and when the Mikado's visit to Ise last autumn is spoken of as ancestor- worship. Now Amaterasu (the Heaven shining one) is at one time tlhes Sun itself, and at another, by a confusion of ideas familiar to mythologists, an anthropomorphic goddess. She is also called Hirume or the Sun-female, and Hi no Kami, the deity of the Sun. She has for brothers the Moon-God, the Rain-Storm, the Wind, and other unmistakeable nature deities. The genealogy which traces the Mikado's descent from her covers a period of some 2,000,000 years, and includes such incidents as the producino of children by cruLnching jewels in the mouth and spurting out the fragments. Yet this is what we are asked to believe when we are told that Shinto is ancestor-worslhip. It is true that there are Euhemerists in Japan who try to make out that Amaterasu was a mortal Empress who lived in a place on earth called Takama no hara (the Plain of High Heaven) and talk of the " principles of rice-culture and weaving" " being known in her reig,n. Moto(iri, the greatest Shinto theologian, treafs such speculations with uitter contempt. We may well follow his example. The Mikados were not the only Japanese who claimed descent from deities. All the great Houses who constituted the hereditary governing caste in ancient times had their ujigami (surname or House deity) to whom they devoted a special cult and from whom they were supposed to be descended. A work entitled Shojiroku, compiled in 815, traces the descent of a large number of these families from ancestors who generally turn out, upon examination, to be nature-gods or their children or satellites. Among them are the Rain storm (or the Rain-storm God) the Sea God, the God of Growth, the Yatagarasu or Smn-crow, a three-legged bird of a red colour which inhabits the sun1, and the chief officials of the Court of the Sun-goddess. Clearly these are not true ancestors. In the worils of Dr. E. Caird, " it is not that the being worshipped is conceived of as a God because he is an ancestor but rather " that he is conceived as an ancestor because he is believed to be their God." Still there may be real ancestors among the obscurer personages of the old genealogies, though of subordinate importance and of later date. Take, for example, Nigi-haya-hi, ancestor of the Mononobe House, a chieftain of one of the Yamato tribes subdued by Jimmu Tenno. He is described as a child of the Heavenly Deity who came down from heaven riding in a heavenly Rock-boat. This, with his name which means " Mild-swift-sun " and the analogy of Amaterasu and the Mikados suggests that he was the Sun-deity of the tribe. On the other hand, it is possible that we have here a case of what Herbert Spencer calls " compliinentary naming after the Sun," of which examples are not lacking in Japanese legenld and history. The older Shinto has little or no trace of genuine ancestor-worship. In the NihoDgi there are one or two isolated cases of " worship " being, paid by Mikados to recently deceased parents or forefathers, but there is nothing to show that it had a religious cliaracter. They had apparently no shrines and their was no regular cult in their honour. It is not until the ninth century that cases begin to occur of norito (pravers) of a distinctly religious character beino addressed to deceased Mikados. The deificatioin of deceased heroes dates from about the same period. The worship of his ancestors by the Mikado is at the present day an established Court ceremonial, and the offerings at their tombs have been assimilated to those made at tlle shrines of nature-deities. In all this I stroDgly suspect Cihinese inifluence. Early in tlle nineteenth century, the Shinto theologian Hirata made an attempt to introduce a general cult of real ancestors on the Chinese model. He instructed his disciples to address prayers to their ancestors of every generation from the parents of the worshipper up to the " Great Ancestor," the founder of the family. Their spirits [ 36 ]</page><page sequence="3">1906.J MAN. [Nos. 23-24. are to be adjured to avert evil from their descendants and to grant them prosperity and long life. Chinese (and Buddhist) influences are also responsible for the Shokonsha (shrine for calling upon souls) erected at Tokio soon after the restoration of 1868. Here periodical memorial services are held in honouir of departed soldiers and others who have done good service to their country. The views expressed in this paper are in substantial agreement witb those of Dr. Florenz, the principal German authority on the subject. (See his Japanische Mythologie, p. 253.) W. G.
