<plain_text><page sequence="1">fiction Sergej Ivanovic Pavlov. O\eanavty. Moscow. Molodaja gvardija (Mez. kniga, distr.). 1972. 255 pages, ill. 42 k. The author of this book is a 33-year-old engineer in geophysics. The search for petroleum, natural gas and rare metals have taken S. I. Pavlov to the Karakum sands, the "Hungarian Steppes," the Tadzhikistan ranges, the Siberian taiga and the Arctic waste lands. Perhaps as a consequence of all this since 1966 he has been publishing science fic- tion stories located in exotic surroundings. With no preparatory explanations the reader finds himself engaged in a fantastic episode, sailing on the deck of an oceano- graphic research vessel in the Indian Ocean, with a multinational crew and in a rather rarified setting, objective, indifferent, remote. Yet the lyrical element appears with the introduction of the Russian, Igor Sobolev. Furthermore, emotional involvement and the appreciation of nature's beauty become possi- ble with the presence of the Russian ship, of Russian characters. A submarine research station becomes the center of exciting and rather baffling experi- ences. Communication with marine life seems possible. Anthropomorphic and fishlike robots function satisfactorily. Yet the interference of a giant, highly intelligent octopus becomes deply disturbing. The memory, all the knowl- edge of a human, has been implanted in the brain of the creature of the ocean depths, desperate in its quest for adaptation to its new condition. The shorter story, "Cherdak vselennoj" (The Attic of the Universe), published for the first time in 1971, deals with interplanetary "transposition" (beaming) of the human body and of objects on a larger scale than we have been used to seeing even on Star Trek. The nightmare described by a member of the space station at the beginning of the story tends to explain the setting and the nature of the problem. Transpositation beyond the solar system emerges as a possibility. Humor- ous elements add relaxation to the seriousness of the situation at the space station. Here again, as in the first story, the structure of the novelette and the treatment of the un- known are very much those of the mystery novel. These two Russian science-fiction stories make very enjoyable reading. Olga Prjevalinskaya Ferrer University of Maryland, Baltimore</page></plain_text>
