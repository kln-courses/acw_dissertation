<plain_text><page sequence="1">"Dream Is Destiny": Waking Life and the Digital Aesthetics of the In-between Maja Manojlovic —Gilles Deleuze, "Immanence: A Life"1 The iguana will bite those who do not dream. —Fedenco Garcia Lorca, quoted by Speed Levitch in Waking Life2 This essay examines how the cinematic figuration of the digital aesthetics in Richard Linklater's animated film Waking Life (2001) dissolves the conventional referential networks of sensation and signification. Generated by the animation technique called A life is everywhere, in all the moments that a given living subject goes through and that are measured by given lived objects: an immanent life carrying with it the events or singularities that are merely actualized in subjects and objects. This indefinite life does not itself have moments, close as they may be one to another, but only between-times, between moments; it doesn't just come about or come after but offers the immensity of an empty time where one sees the event yet to come and already happened, in the absolute of an immediate consciousness.

I suggest that this interstitial aesthetics provides a platform for the transvaluation of the notion of life in contemporary cinema, is the process of interpolated rotoscoping used in Waking Life both materially constitutes and conceptually models digital aesthetics and its assimilation into contemporary culture. During the first fifteen minutes oí my big-screen experience of the film at the Laemmle's Sunset 5 Theatres in Hollywood, the sensation of nausea prevailed. This wasn't the delayed effect of being disoriented in the labyrinth-like parking garage, frantically looking for a place to park—a sensation one learns to transcend very quickly in Los Angeles. Rather, once immersed in the film, I was perceptually overwhelmed by the wobbly lines of the animated figures and the persistently shifting spatial layers, resisting the commonsense efforts of my brain to work along the habitual pathways of stable cognitive mapping. I found that my sense of orientation was dislocated, but not in exactly the same way as it was in the parking garage, where my sense of space was grounded in the materiality of the garage's physical delimitations. The dislocation of my sense of orientation induced by my immersion into the unstable imagery of Waking Life was anchored inside my body. It thus had a more profound effect on me because it required a rerouting of my embodied perceptual habits themselves, instead of, as in the case of the parking garage, merely demanding me to recall and solidify the structure of spatial object(ive) markers outside of the body. Now, this experience—I couldn't simply transcend. Instead, my nausea slowly gave way to various degrees of hypnagogic and hypnopompic states of alertness (or even drowsiness), all characteristic of the liquid quality of in between states of consciousness. Such intermediary states also mark the diegetic thread of Wak ing Life. Its protagonist, Wiley Wiggins, is a traveler who becomes a dreamer. He arrives in town by train, can't connect with his friend; embarks on a taxi-boat; arrives at a destination chosen by a mysteri ous man riding in the cab with him; and is hit by a car while paus ing on a crosswalk to pick up a piece of paper with an inscription that anticipated the car's arrival. After that, as Wiley listens, the discontinuous diegesis meanders through a series of encounters with colorful, vivid characters who talk about what life is and what living means. Only later does Wiley participate in the conversations. As it turns out, Wiley is actually dreaming throughout the movie, or dreaming the movie, and all his encounters are a part of his dreamscapes where he seems to be more actively awake than in his actual waking life.</page><page sequence="3">186 Maja Manojlovic Nonetheless, although this movie presents Wiley as its protago nist, it's ultimately not about Wiley's life, but about a life, as defined by Gilles Deleuze. Waking Life doesn't build or emphasize its signify ing momentum by fleshing out Wiley's individuality or character through narrative continuity. Instead, its discontinuous fragmentary series of vignettes about human encounters ride the force of the present moment and carve out a portrait of a singular life, immanent to Wiley. The film's power resides in its ability to generate a space for the conceptualization of a life that is everywhere, "in all the moments that a given living subject goes through and that are measured by given lived objects: an immanent life carrying with it the events or singularities that are merely actualized in subjects and objects."3 The particular space that allows that immanent life to come through exists in-between those wobbly lines and shifting planes of the animated images, resisting recognition and insistenÜy scrambling the viewers' referential network. To better understand such disfigurations of the conventional sense-making due to the uncontrollably emerging "immanence" as "a life," I want to clarify Deleuze's explanation of these terms. In "Immanence: A Life," the first chapter of his book Pure Immanence: Essays on A Life, the author explains that we can speak of a "plane of immanence" only "when immanence is no longer immanence to anything other than itself."4 He continues, No more than the transcendental field is defined by consciousness can the plane of immanence be defined by a subject or an object that is able to contain it. We will say of pure immanence that it is A LIFE, and nothing else. It is not immanence to life, but the immanent that is in nothing is itself a life. A life is the immanence of immanence, absolute immanence: it is complete power, complete bliss. Deleuze s definition of immanence as a life thus reevaluates the notion of life: the author asks us to understand it as imper sonal, instead of seeing it in terms of the life of an individual. Such singular life resists the commonsense subjective and objective delimitations imposed either from inside (individuality) or outside (society). Instead, it releases a pure potentiality of an event (or experience) that is not predetermined by the conventional sense making processes of recognition or identification. A singular life acknowledges a sense that doesn't require any other referent than its own expression and thus catalyzes the processes of differentiation. Moreover, a singular life experiences a sensation as an encounter with the world, "discovering syntheses prior to the identities of figure and perception."6</page><page sequence="4">"Dream Is Destiny " 181 Being inherent to a life as singularity, such a-referential differ ence thus eludes conventional cultural and political systems of con trol, causing their abstract and homogenized space to randomly tear. These tears or interstices become germs of differential processes, potentially generating a "new concept of society in which what we have in common is our singularities and not our individualities."7 Such a concept of society (residing on the notion of singular life) necessitates a fresh understanding of the body, where we do not solely talk about an individual "some-body" but also the singular "any-body" (quelconque): "Underneath the identity of our bodies or organisms, we each have what Deleuze calls a body (a mouth, a stomach)."0 Again, the concept of any-body implies a body that cannot be framed within the cultural conventions or disciplined by the power structures of sociopolitical institutions. Incorporated into the context of Waking Life, the singularity of Wiley's life as a life of any-body comes through its spatialized anima tion aesthetics. This essay therefore explores the notion of a life through the unique spatial aesthetics of this digitally rotoscoped and animated film. I argue that this particular and rotoscoped film's unconventional aesthetics of space not only reconfigures our habit ual sense-making and sensing processes but also reflects the effects of the digital aesthetics. By considering the various components that make Waking Life such a compelling and challenging film, I hope to conceptually explore and identify the visual dynamics of the assemblage constituting digital aesthetics enveloping contemporary culture. Could we not say that contemporary digital aesthetics as incorporated in Waking Life reveals a situation of being9 (gener ated by the in-between states), one that stimulates us to expeiientially allow for a Deleuzian plane of immanence to be present (reflected) in our own waking lives, just as it is in our dream life? Or, in other words, is our sensing and sense-making experience of life, as such (as immanence), any different in the context of the "in-betweenness" generated by the spatializing digital aesthetics? If that is the case, then Waking Life's technologies trigger a conceptual and aesthetic perceptual refiguration that allows for a differential processes to unfold and thus for a transvaluation of life. Throughout the inter stices of the visible and sensible, this film's digitally rotoscoped aesthetics transvalues life by weaving in the pure potentiality of the Deleuzian plane of immanence—a life. Indeed, along the lines of Louis-Georges Schwartz s discussion of Deleiize's Cinema 2,1 suggest that Waking Life "transvalues life by making explicit the concept implicit in contemporary thought and by revising it not according to judgments o/life, butjudgments by life."10 This is to say that Waking Life's animation aesthetics makes explicit</page><page sequence="5">188 Maja Manojlovic the emerging structures of sense and sensation that are implicit in the spatiotemporal experience of contemporary culture by revalu ing/ recontextualizing the Deleuzian notion of a life as immanence, constituting ajudgment by life par excellence." Therefore, my core argument in this essay is that Waking Life's spatialized digital aesthet ics reanimates the potentialities repressed by habitual conventional cognitive referential networks of sensation and signification. By reanimating the virtual, the digital aesthetics of Linklater's film formally (and materially) acknowledges the infinite potentiality of the plane of immanence, which does not transcend the actual forms that are "able to contain it" and is not determined by them. The Production of Space With its unusual visual aesthetics that destabilizes conventional cognitive referential frames, Linklater's Waking Life reimagines spatiality (and temporality) in the context of the digital aesthet ics permeating contemporary urban culture. Waking Life's vital narrative strategy and its aesthetics both reflect an assemblage of contemporary culture's spatializing tendencies, determining its framing of life.12 These spatializing tendencies are a part of our daily, embodied urban experience in which we are continuously required to interact with the electronic screens of ATMs, cell phones, and computer screens of various sizes or to orient ourselves within a maze of decentered postmodern urban geography and flat, reflective architectural surfaces. Moreover, this quotidian experience of the contemporary urban environment closely overlaps with the quality of our interactions with electronically generated environments such as cyberspace where, again, a spatial logic prevails. Correlative to these culturally pervasive components of daily life is Waking Life s discontiguous narrative flow, where sequences follow one another without spatiotemporal continuity. It is this film's intense animated aesthetics of spatialization that forms the experiential, sensible grounds for its understanding of contemporary sense to emerge. This spatialized aesthetics follows the general paradigm of a space of flows, corresponding in a high degree to the experience of navigating the electronic space of the Internet. Manuel Castells defines a space of flows as an "articulated ter ritorial concentration and decentralization in which the unit is the network."13 Although he understands electronic space to be a part of the space of flows, it is not its only part. The space of flows "is made up first of all of a technological infrastructure of information systems, telecommunications, and transportation lines."14 Its main</page><page sequence="6">"Dream Is Destiny " attribute is that the material arrangements within this space "allow for simultaneity of social practices without territorial contiguity."15 Castells's idea of the space of flows is further complemented by Mario Gandelsonas's concept of the X-Urban city, which he defines as a "new urbanity not organized any more in oppositional terms such as center versus periphery but as a multicenter city, not as a dominant totality versus subordinated parts but as a nonhierarchical fragmented urbanized territory."16 These transformations of the urban also bring about changes in the field of vision. According to Gandelsonas, computer technolo gies such as computer design, animation, and magnetic resonance imaging destabilize the notion of representation and relocate vision by separating it from the human observer: "Today vision is situated in an electromagnetic terrain of bits as opposed to both classical perception and the twentieth-century analog media such as photog raphy, film, and television."17 If the notion of classical perception, however contrived, entails an observer with a perspective that is situated within the references of an actually existent and materi ally tangible space, and analog visual media mimetically reproduce such "real" space, then computer-generated imagery introduces "fabricated visual 'spaces'" that no longer have any reference "to the position of an observer in a 'real,' optically perceived world."18 Instead, such computer-generated images can be described as refer ring to "millions of bits of electronic mathematical data"19 and elicit new ways of experiencing our embodiment and senses in relation to such abstractly configured spatiality. As these definitions suggest, the space of flows consists of expen entially destabilizing mome n ts, which affect the emergence of specific paradigm (s) of the production, conceptualization, and imagination of space. Here I focus on a dominant destabilizing tendency, which manifests as a sense of dislocation.201 take up this notion from Abbas Ackbar's Hong Kong: Culture and the Politics of Disappearance (1997), where he suggests that instead of "thinking in terms of displace ment, a movement somewhere else," we should think in terms of dislocation, a transformation of place. The sense of dislocation is an embodied sensation generated by the barely discernible trans formations of our immediate living environment. These almost invisible shifts become perceptible only after we've "changed our forms of attention"21 in order to re-cognize our reconstructed ref erential network, which simultaneously implies a potential shift in signification. Besides retuning our cognitive attitudes, our immedi ate environment, characterized as the space of flows, also prompts us to readjust our habitual sensing patterns. Such slight dislocations of conventional sensing and signifying referential networks are further</page><page sequence="7">190 Maja Manojlovic highlighted by the contemporary digital aesthetics that permeates our culture and its spatiality. If we refer this contemporary sense of dislocation back to Henri Lefebvre's earlier, seminal book, The Production of Space (1991), we can see how dislocation opens up the possibility of understanding the cultural assimilation of digital aesthetics as a part of the contra dictory processes that transform abstract space into differential space. Abstract and differential spaces are both part of the space of flows. For example, in his article "Grassrooting the Space of Flows" (2000), Castells discusses the contradictions within the abstract space of flows that engender possibilities of resistance to the global capitalist economy, arising from the different aspects of the space of flows. Indeed, it is precisely the experiential unease (nausea) of dislocation that subverts the homogenizing tendencies of the pervasive abstract space wrought by capital. According to Lefebvre, abstract space is produced by capitalism, as the effect of the independence of abstract productive activity from reproductive processes and labor. It sustains itself as a world system through a vast network of business and information centers, as well as highways and airports. Abstract space is characterized by the capacity to act like a subject that "transports and maintains specific social relations, dissolves others and stands opposed to yet others."22 It relates positively towards technology, applied sciences, and knowledge bound to power. Lefebvre claims that abstract space functions as an apparent subject (capable of dissolving and incor porating former subjects and also replacing them); an "impersonal pseudo-subject," which hides within it the real "subject"; namely, state political power.23 According to Lefebvre, abstract space is not defined on the basis of what is perceived. Rather, it crushes lived perceptual experience with what is conceived. The spaces of represen tation (concerned with writing, imagery, and media) are therefore endowed with illusory power, where their abstraction produces an "awesome reductionistic force vis-à-vis lived experience."24 One of the many consequences of such abstraction, Lefebvre points out, is the "centering the knowledge on discourse," which avoids the "topic of the relationship between knowledge and power."25 This emphasis on discourse also tends to conflate nonver bal expression, such as music, paindng, sculpture, architecture, and theater, into the same category as verbal symbols. Such conflaüon, in fact, ignores, or, at best, diminishes the space of these nonverbal signifying sets and ignores that they are irreducible to a purely men tal (or abstract) realm. Furthermore, underestimating the space of these nonverbal signifying sets amounts to the "overestimation of texts, written matter, and writing systems, along with the readable</page><page sequence="8">"Dream, Is Destiny " 191 and the visible, to the point of assigning to these a monopoly on intelligibility."26 It thus becomes evident how abstract space as pseudosubject functions as a regulatory tool of the state, systematically framing embodiment and life as textual (or possible, which means they are already predetermined by existing cultural codes) rather than endowed with the power of the virtual, where the process of dif ferentiation is inherent in its actualization. In this way, embodiment and its reproductive biological force of life are most likely channeled into fueling the nationalistic and ethnocentric ideologies of the state. Biological conception and reproduction therefore become functions of national state control, such as the economic stimuli for married couples to conceive more children to increase the number of citizens. Once in service of the nation-state power structures and ideologies, the notions of the any-body-whatever (embodiment as such) and a life are conflated: as though body is not a body if it doesn't possess life (in its death, in terms of human bodies, and its immobility, in terms of object-bodies) and as though life is not also a life if not determined by a specific—human—form. Such anthropocentric (and anthropomorphic) evaluations of embodi ment and life derive precisely from the homogenizing tendencies of the abstract space and its power structures, valuing body only as far as it can perform (pseudo)subjectivity that functions as a clearly intelligible text.27 However, Lefebvre argues, along with such centralizing and homogenizing principles, abstract space also "carries within itself the seeds of a new kind of space" that is not centralizing or homogeniz ing. This internal contradiction derives from a tendency inherent in abstract space—a tendency towards the dissolution of old relations, on the one hand, and the generation of new relations, on the other. Out of this contradiction (and others) is born differential space.™ Differential space is a spatial and social opening, an as-yet uncodified and uncommodified space that allows for novel and not contextual ized relations (at least for a time). This differential space restores unity to what abstract space alienates (the social practice and the integrity of the individual and social body) and differentiates what abstract space identifies (i.e., social reproduction and genitality, social relationships and family relationships). By dislocating the conventional distribution of relations within the abstract space, differential space has the potential to engage the notion of any body-whatever, a singularity that acknowledges life as such: neither solely transcendental nor determined by (human) embodiment. This indeterminacy of life as such is brimming with its full intensity in the ceaselessly undulating, constantly shape-shifting,</page><page sequence="9">192 Maja Manojlovic yet insistently plentiful, imagery of Waking Life. With its unique use of animation techniques, Waking Life conceptually dislocates the classical and analog codes of visual perception and thus questions and transforms the habitual cognitive mapping of our environment. I have already mentioned that Linklater's use of interpolated rotoscop ing produced nausea in me; I would like to suggest that this unpleas ant psychophysical experience comes from the film's making the processes constituting the space of flows visible and sensible. Indeed, the pseudosubjectivity of abstract space is visualized as conceptual and therefore modifiable, rather than seamlessly homogenized in the illusory "stability" of the conventional representational space of cinema. Whether nauseating or simply intense, the undisciplined, undulating imagery that defies conventional cognitive relation ship to background and foreground, as well as insistently shifts the delimitations of material forms as such, ultimately expands the space allotted to the nonverbal signifying sets. Besides accentuating the spectator's awareness of a lived, embodied experience, these nonver bal signifying sets also reveal the contradictory moment within the abstract space where its conceptual and arbitrary nature unfolds into a process of differentiation. The visual and perceptual experiences of destabilized conventional referential networks deconstructed by Waking Life's rotoscoped animation thus tear into the abstract space to generate differential space. Moreover, the conceptual placements of the subjective and objective are dislocated, as well. Namely, this film turns external urban space inside out as it invites us into a subjective drift in the urban dream world of its protagonist. Similarly, in the context of digital aesthetics, the Internet as an electronic part of the space of flows turns our subjective space into public space and simultaneously makes public space a part of the subjective within one and the same technical device. The result is a world defined by digital aesthetics and a reflexive spatiotemporal dynamics of a Möbius strip where there's no inside or outside discernible even as they do seem to exist. These reconfigurations of the spatiotemporal referential network in the context of digital aesthetics necessarily elicit a reconsideration of the notion of life. As Waking Life's fluid, continuously undulat ing, and spatialized animation suggests, the conceptualization of a life cannot be more rigid than its components. For example, if the homogenizing tendency of abstract space has mainly political use value in maintaining the stability of power and the state as such, this means that the concept of life that ensues incorporates this very homogenizing principle. Conversely, the digitally crafted aesthetics of Linklater's film insistently resists homogenization by evoking the unstable, constantly shifting core of the life force that cannot be</page><page sequence="10">"Dream Is Destiny " 193 measured by the purely programmatic and fixed parameters gener ated by the abstract space. Although the abstract space of capitalist exchange inevitably appropriates all creative imaginative efforts, Waking Life grants glimpses into a differential space through the animation aesthetics produced by its specific use of digital technology. It thus reexamines the dominant cultural assumptions underlying the production of urban space as reflected in the representational space of traditional narrative cinema. Rotoshop and Its Spatialized Aesthetics The key technology that generates the possibility for differential space to arise in the interstices of the spatial layers of Waking Life's visuals is the animation software known as Rotoshop, which was devel oped by Bob Sabiston, an MIT graduate in computer animation. He first used this software in short animated films, such as Project Incognito (dir. Bob Sabiston and Malissa Ryder, 1997), Roadhead (dir. Bob Sabiston, 1999), Snack and Drink (dir. Bob Sabiston, 2000), and Grasshopper (dir. Bob Sabiston, 2004), all of them displaying interest in "the minudae and details of everyday communication"; in them, the animation was based around short interviews and Rotoshop "interpreted" what was said.29 As Paul Ward explains, Rotoshop follows some of the same principles as ordinary rotoscop ing, in that it traces over live-action footage. The key difference is that the process is computerized. Live-action footage is shot digitally, saved to computer and converted to QuickTime files. The resulting footage can be viewed one frame at a time and transformed using the Rotoshop program.30 This user-friendly software enabled Linklater to engage a variety of painters and other artists to animate sequences of Waking Life. As the animation artists play the footage, they carry out the animation process through the use of a Wacom Tablet and an electronic pen. To avoid the painstaking tracing of each frame, Sabiston's program includes a process he refers to as "interpolation." This interpolated rotoscoping [a] Hows the animator to draw lines in one frame (for instance, follow ing the movement of someone's face as they talk), use the computer to skip forward a number of frames, and then trace the same line where it is now, relative to the last line. The program will then smoothly fill</page><page sequence="11">194 Maja Manojlovic in the lines that have not, literally, been drawn. In many respects, this behaves in much the same way as in-betweening does in conventional eel animation.31 Interpolation thus gives the animation a look of shimmering impressionism with pop cartoon flair"32 and "creates a whole new way of seeing."33 Another important feature of the Rotoshop program is to isolate "levels" of the footage and thereby allow the animators to concen trate on one level at a time. For example, background items, such as the sky or houses, can be "frozen": "this means they can be colored or shaded and fixed in place by the push of a button," while the anima tor works on movements in other parts of the image, relative to the fixed level. Moreover, as Sabiston explains in the "Special Features" section of the Waking Life DVD, the program enables the animation artist to "make the background object disappear completely, in order to better see the moving objects in the foreground."34 While this separation of layers is an essential feature of eel animation, now incorporated in the Rotoshop software, this "freezing" of individual layers in the animation process ultimately reanimates the live-action footage by accentuating the rapid panning and sudden lurches of the handheld digital camera movements, as well as reimagining its constantly moving, shifting, and changing perspective.35 These programming features and aesthetic effects of Rotoshop make it interesting not only as a complex animation technique but also, and more pertinently to this essay, an assemblage of signifying and sensible dynamics modeling digital aesthetics and the processes it generates, and thus contributing to its accelerated assimilation into the contemporary cultural imaginary and its practices. Indeed, the dynamic interrelatedness of Rotoshop's programming software features and the spatializing effects of its digital aesthetics evoke and visually reconfigure conventional signifying and sensible referential networks and question the commonly accepted notion of life. Although framed by the big screen of cinema, Waking Life's digitally created aesthetics with its smooth-yet-undulating look invites the spectator to radically shift her cognitive habits and take a very peculiar ride. For some viewers (as it did for me), this experi ence becomes literally nauseating; for others, it induces a sense of drowsiness or a hypnagogic in-between state similar to being on the edge of sleep or on drugs.36 The cause of these intensely stimulating, yet diffused, psychophysical states lies in Rotoshop's manipulation of how we perceptually and conceptually relate to abstract space. Indeed, the animation of Waking Life deconstructs abstract space by</page><page sequence="12">"Dream Is Destiny " 195 revealing its three aspects, or formants,37 as Lefebvre calls them—the geometric, the visual, and the phallic (the hierarchical)—and the way these formants are interrelated. More precisely, the movie reveals the way these formants imply and simultaneously conceal one another.38 Entering the animated world of Waking Life, the spectator has to give up the illusion of isotopic, homogeneous Euclidean space as the space of reference. Namely, the ceaselessly shifting planes of space colored into discrete strata disrupt the illusion of spatial homogeneity. Furthermore, spatiality resists constituting itself along the grid of habitual perception: the unstable background makes it difficult for us to locate the core object; that is, the focal center of our vision (however virtual it is). Instead of a central vision, which focuses on a core object, our visual field is reconstituted to include the horizon of our field of vision. The spectator's visual perception is therefore dislocated from its habitual paradigm of fixing on the focal center, which diffuses towards periphery. The aesthetics of this particular form of animation demands a retrain ing of our visual perception to simultaneously expand its focus to the point of dispersion and actively include the fringe; hence the dislocation of our habitual visual focus. Moreover, the primacy of the visual as the totality of the experiential is questioned by exposing its métonymie nature. Paradoxically, the quivering ground plates and shape-shifting dreamscapes of Waking Life, its lush imagery, and its colorful vibrancy prevent "the gaze" and "the thing seen" from being perceived as a totality: there's always something beyond the gaze and in between the shifting planes. By dislocating the visual field, the broader conceptual dimensionality of our sense percep tion is restored. We are not relating to visuals as the dominant text; on the contrary, they suggest the dimensional richness of the orga nization of the sensual beyond (or in the interstices of) the visible. This decentered multidimensionality forgoes the perpendicular, phallocratie (or hierarchical) orientation of space and therefore, again, resists the illusory homogenization of abstract space. It is through these contradictory interstices, embedded in abstract space, that Waking Life s digitally processed aesthetics seeps into the differential space of contemporary culture. With its digitally mastered imagination, this animated film revitalizes the potential of the representational space of cinema to again invoke differential space, where the acquired cultural assumptions about our sensory perceptive habits can be reconfigured, re-cognized, and critically reexamined.</page><page sequence="13">196 Maja Manojlovic Reconfigurations of Referential Networks As the animation in Waking Life colors the formants of abstract space, it simultaneously reveals new potential sets of references. This new cognitive space, freshly carved out of the interstices of the visible, engages embodied signifying processes that interact with the context of the digital aesthetics of the movie. The referential network of Waking Life's aesthetics is multiplied not only because it is fictional but also because of the constant mobility of its different spatial strata. It is thus difficult for the spectator to find any conventional, commonsense grounds to anchor her desire experientially or herme neutically to assign a stable meaning to any visual element. Indeed, it is often difficult to discern background from foreground, as well as figure from ground, which contributes to the dissolution of the illusion of a rigid hierarchy and unidirectionality in the process of signification. This difficulty in isolating core images and meanings results in the dispersion and multiplication of signifying processes, just as the focal point extends to include the fringe. Such dispersion and multiplication of both signification and spatially interrelated phenomena therefore generate a dynamic dimensionality. As Vivian Sobchack explains in The Address of the Eye: A Phenom enology of Film Experience, the cinematic is a dynamic relationship between equally engaged subjects: the spectator, the film, and its context. Film is understood as more than "a visible object (some 'thing' already seen, already constituted)." Sobchack points out that film is a "performative and communicative act of vision (a now-seeing, a now-constituting activity) that implicates a viewing subject (an always perceptive and always-constitutive enworlded lived-body) engaged in the act of signifying."39 Film experience is therefore a dynamic intersubjective signifying relationship between all equally engaged agents (subjects). I would suggest that the digital animation of Wak ing Life not only engages this interrelatedness but also adds to it by interfering with the apparently transparent act of signifying. For the spectator, this interference manifests in a sort of hypnagogic state in between heightened awareness and sleep. This in-between state is demonstrative that, in the interstices of the visible, operate processes resisting the formation of signification along the established web of references. Such resistances evoke the process of the actualization of the virtual, which plays by the rules of "difference or divergence and of creation."40 To explain the dynamics between virtual and actual, real and possible, I quote from Deleuze's Bergsonism: While the real is in the image and likeness of the possible that it real izes, the actual, on the other hand, does not resemble the virtuality that it</page><page sequence="14">"Dream Is Destiny " 197 embodies. It is the difference that is primary in the process of actualiza tion—the difference between the virtual from which we begin and the actuals at which we arrive, and also the difference between the comple mentary lines according to which actualization takes place. In short, the characteristic of virtuality is to exist in such a way that it is actualized by being differentiated and is forced to differentiate itself, to create its lines of differentiation in order to be actualized.11 We can now see how the tension between such differentiations (constitutive of the actualization of the virtual) dislocates the com monsense signification pertinent to the real (realized "in the image of the possible"). This dislocation happens as the frequency of the oscillation between the virtual and the real generates an interstice (in betweenness) that cognitively translates into an effect similar to the visual adjustment towards the fringe. In other words, the quivering of lines and the instability of the ground produce the indeterminacy of reference and therefore signification. Hence the hypnagogic state, where being-in-the-world oscillates between the present moment on the screen and the movement of world, independent of the screen and evoking the plane of immanence, a life. The intensity of the spectator's experience of the movement of world corresponds to the intensity of the visuals and the passionately rendered presences of the "animated" actors. As Gaston Bachelard puts it in the chapter "Intimate Immensity" in The Poetics of Space, "the exterior spectacle helps intimate grandeur unfold." Bachelard furthermore explains that to [discover that immensity in the intimate domain is intensity, an inten sity of being, the intensity of a being evolving in a vast perspective of intimate immensity. It is the principle of correspondences to receive the immensity of the world, which they transform into intensity of our inti mate being. They institute transactions between two kinds of grandeur.42 It is precisely the pleasure of the intensification of the senses, where "the sense of existence is immensely increased,"43 that is evoked by the correspondences between the intimate grandeur/ intensity of the spectator's own interiority and the immensity/ intensity of the digitally animated presentation of the protagonist's dreamscapes. Although similar to daydreaming,44 this intensity (and simultaneously expansion) doesn't alienate the body's sensitivity but only dislocates the habitual network of perceptual references with which the spectator operates. The experience of intimate immen sity therefore expands the referential network and opens up into a dialogic relationship with "the vast" or, as Bachelard would say, a</page><page sequence="15">198 Maja Manojlovic dialectic of the inside and outside, which become interchangeable and reversible. The heightened sensitivity of the spectator s body is triggered by the indeterminacy of perceptual and signifying references. The pul sating images create rhythms within the image, where the animated spatial layers float and undulate almost independently from one another, indicating the dissonance and heterogeneity inherent to the apparently homogeneous movement of the whole. Waking Life's digital aesthetics thus radically reconfigures spectator's sensual and cognitive experience of what Jacques Rancière calls the distribution of the sensible, which, according to Rancière, is a "system of divisions and boundaries that define, among other things, what is visible and audible within a particular aesthetico-political regime."45 Aesthetics therefore isn't limited only to the domain of art but includes "the conceptual coordinates and modes of visibility operative in the politi cal domain."46 As Waking Life's digital aesthetics redistributes the sensible and undoes the spectator's conventional cognitive habits and signifying processes, it prompts the spectator to potentially gen erate an awareness of a singular any-body. Such acknowledgment of depersonalized singularity of a body as "the germ of life"47 affects our comprehension and experience of what life is and its valuation. It is from the awareness of such an impersonal any-body that a "new body" develops. This new body is still a body, but one with a reconfigured referential network that can account for the recombined—as well as intensified and expanded—modalities of perception, sensation, and expression. The intensification of the senses that manifests as both nausea and pleasure necessarily amounts to the redistribution of the sensible, where the elements that are usually silenced by convention forcefully modify and assert their place in experience of life as such. Therefore, through its figuration in cinema, the contemporary and culturally pervasive digital aesthetics necessitates a transvaluation of life by restoring the embodied, sensory link between (wo) man and the world. Namely, by eliciting the intense and expansive, yet indeterminate, sets of cognitive references, Waking Life's spatialized digital aesthetics forcefully prompts the spectator to reassess the world and reconnect in a conscious, meaningful way to what she internally feels and perceives from the outside.48 After absorbing its fascinatingly disorienting imagery and its fragmented story of a dreamer who potentially never awakens but süll dares to dream on, the spectator inhabits a world with a different distribution of the sensible. Reanimated by the digital animation aesthetics, this world's expanded boundaries incorporate the color ful vibrancy of the virtual, with the intensity of the differentiation processes being acknowledged as its constitutive part. The fixed</page><page sequence="16">"Dream Is Destiny " 199 power of state ideology is dislocated by the power of the now and of the movement of the world. The prevailing consumerist imagination is reoriented towards imaginative existence; human encounter is redistributed from simply being a part of discursive networks to a real human experience—a "holy moment" in which two people acknowl edge each other outside of the commonly accepted boundaries assigned to their individual subjectivities and instead acknowledge a life not only in each of them but also everywhere. A life likened in this way to the plane of immanence, outside of any control systems (from the politics of the state repressive apparatuses or health care institutions), undoubtedly dislocates the dominant, nation-state, and global market economy's power dynamics. Indeed, the digital aesthetics of Linklater's film insistendy defies representing life in terms of any kind of use value; on the contrary, the discontinuous, experimental narrative and the digital aesthetics of interpolated rotoscoping dislocate and redistribute the commonly accepted distribution of the sensible and its consumerist value system to the realm of those who dream. Notes I thank Suzanne Buchan for providing invaluable insight into the animation processes used in Waking Life and especially for her encouraging comments on an early draft of this essay. 1 also thank Vivian Sobchack and Louis-Georges Schwartz for their inspiring suggestions. 1 Gilles Deleuze, "Immanence: A Life," in Pure Immanence: Essays on A Life, trans.

This misunderstanding can be clarified by considering an example of his discussion of body in the second section, entitled "Second Series of Paradoxes of Surface Effects," of The Logic of Sense (trans. Mark Lester, with Charles Stivale [New York: Columbia University Press, 1990], 4-7), where he relies on the Stoics, for whom only bodies " (understood in the broadest possible sense, and including all living and non-living things) have depth and real existence, while events float on the surface of bodies and cannot be said to ex-ist but rather sub-sist or per-sist in the relation between bodies" (quoted from Gilles Deleuze: Key Concepts, ed. Charles J. Stivale [Montreal: McGill-Queen's University Press], 67). Furthermore, Deleuze's collaborative work with Félix Guattari and their favoring of nonhierarchical, rhizomatic thinking also speak to his insistence on the corporeal, which does not have a higher or lesser value then the metaphysical, but is equally important. 12 In his seminal work Postmodernism, or, the Cultural Logic of Late Capitalism, Post-Contemporary Interventions series (Durham, NC: Duke University Press, 1997) Frederic Jameson wonders what kind of forms will "time, temporality, and the syn tagmatic" take in "a culture increasingly dominated by space and spatial logic" (25). 13 Manuel Castells, "Grassrooting the Space of Flows," in Cities in the Telecom munications Age: The Fracturing of Geographies, ed.

(in Cyberspace: First Steps, ed. Michael Benedikt [Cambridge, MA: MIT Press, 1991 ], 81-118), discusses the "decoupling of the body from the subject" relying on Francis Barker's 1984 study The Tremulous Private Body: Essays on Subjection" (New York: Methuen):</page><page sequence="18">"Dream Is Destiny " 201 Frances Barker suggests that, because of the effects of the Restoration on the social and political imaginary in Britain (1660 and on), the human body gradually ceased to be perceived as public spectacle, as had previously been the case, and became privatized in new ways. The body (and the subject, although she doesn't lump them together in this way) became "the site of an operation of power, of an exercise of meaning ... a transition, effected over a long period of time, from a socially visible object to one which can no longer be seen" (Barker 1984:13). While the subject in Barker's account became, in her words, "raging, solitary, productive," what it produced was text. On the other hand, it was the newly hidden Victorian body that became physically productive and that later provided the motor for the industrial revolution; it was most useful as a brute body, for which the creative spark was an impediment. In sum, the body became more physical, while the subject became more textual, which is to say nonphysical. If the information age is an extension of the industrial age, with the passage of time the split between the body and the subject should grow more pro nounced still. But in the fourth epoch the split is simultaneously growing and disappearing. The socioepistemic mechanism by which bodies mean is undergoing a deep restructuring in the latter part of the twentieth century, finally fulfilling the furthest extent of the isolation of those bodies through which its domination is authorized and secured. 28 Lefebvre, Production of Space, 52. 29 Paul Ward, "Rotoshop in Context: Computer Rotoscoping and Animation Aesthetics," Animation Journal 12 (2004): 32-52, quotation on 32-33. 30 Ibid. 31 Ibid., 33-34.

He defines classical rotoscoping as eel based, because it uses "live-action footage which is then traced frame-by-frame onto eels" (46). 38 Richard Linklater's film A Scanner Darkly (2006), an adaptation of Philip K. Dick's 1977 novel, uses Rotoshop to support a narrative about Keanu Reeves becom ing addicted to "Substance D"—standing in for methamphetamine (crystal meth). 37 Lefebvre, Production oj Space, 285. 38 Ibid. 39 Vivian Sobchack, The Address of lite Eye: A Phenomenology oj Film Experience (Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press, 1992), 56. 10 Gilles Deleuze, Bergsonism, trans.

As the film progresses, Wiley's ability to move is diminished, and it is therefore "the movement of the world" which supplements his faltering movement. This movement of the world is "a virtual movement, but it becomes actual at the price of an expansion of the totality of space and of a stretching of time" (Gilles Deleuze, Cinema 2: The Time-Image, trans. Hugh Tomlinson and Robert Galeta [Minneapolis: University of Minnesota Press, 1989], 59). This amounts to a depersonalization of the character, which, as I've suggested in the introductory part of the essay, evokes the plane of immanence—a life. 45 Jacques Rancière, The Politics of Aesthetics: The Distribution of the Sensible, trans, and introd. Gabriel Rockhill (London: Continuum, 2004), 1. Strictly speaking, distribution refers to forms of inclusion and to forms of exclusion, whereas sensible refers to what is amenable to being apprehended by the senses (85). Essentially, the distribution of the sensible "determines a mode of articulation between forms of action, production, perception, and thought" (82). 46 Ibid., 82. 47 Deleuze, Cinema 2, 173. When Deleuze discusses the loss of the belief in this world as it is and suggests that cinema's task is to restore it, he suggests that "believing is no longer believing in another world, or in a transformed world. It is only, it is simply believing in the body. It is giving discourse to the body, and for this purpose, reaching the body before discourses, before words, before things are named." (172-73). 48 Again, in his discussion of the loss of belief in this world in Cinema 2, Deleuze points out, Man is in the world as if in a pure optical and sound situation. The reaction of which man has been dispossessed can be replaced only by belief. Only belief in the world can reconnect man to what he sees and hears. (172) If this "reaction" has been alienated from man by the horrors of World War II, the contemporary age of digital aesthetics and its spatialized nature force him to reinvent his affective and sensory referential networks because they are the only way to navigate and survive in this world. Or, in other words, to enter contemporary discursive net works, one must use the nonverbal and haptic abilities of our embodied experience.</page></plain_text>
