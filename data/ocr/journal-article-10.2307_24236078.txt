<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE OTHER RUMPELSTILT SKIN'S NAME ERNEST MUNDT * IN one of the fairy tales of the brothers Grimm, a little girl finds herself at the mercy of a frightening wood sprite simply because she does not know his name. One night, she happens upon him dancing around a fire and singing to him self, "It's so good that no one knows my name is Rumpelstilts kin." This revelation breaks the spell. Now the little girl can call him by his true name, and the sprite, with his identity revealed and his power of secret gone, must respect the girl's wishes. It is the poets among us, the story seems to say, who, by finding names—symbolic expressions of identity—give us access to what must remain foreign without their aid. It is the poet's symbolist images, I should like to add, that supply the link between myself and the fact of life I encounter that does not fit into a familiar mold. In a world of affinities, the poet's many-valenced words (or sounds or pictures) bring to gether the inner self and the outer event in a meaningful experience. I encountered the woodsprite the other day. He frightened me with his strange nature. The names by which I was told to call him must have been the wrong ones because I am still frightened. I am now calling for the poet to perform the proper introduction. The poet had better be good. . . words strain, Crack and sometimes break under the burden, Under the tension slip, slide, perish, Decay with imprecision. . * Associate professor of art, San Francisco State College; formerly director, California School of Fine Arts; author, A Primer of Visual Art (1950), Art, Form and Civilization (1952), and Birth of a Cook (1957). 208</page><page sequence="2">WINTER 1959 THB OTHER RUMPBLSTILTSKIN'S NAME Mr. Eliot's excuse for poetic shortcoming (quoted from Erich Heller's The Hazards of Modern Poetry to which I shall return presently) is convincing—but then, good excuses always are. What I need is not excuses but the poet's live symbols. Perhaps this is an unreasonable demand. But I am not reason able: as I have said, I am frightened. Some of the hollows carved by primeval waters out of the western slopes of the California Coast Range near Santa Cruz hold remnants of untamed nature, groves of Sequoia sempervirens. Sheltered under the protection of the Division of Beaches and Parks of the Department of Natural Resources of the State of California, "saved from the woodman's ax," as one of the local tourist folders puts it, the gigantic red woods are offered for inspection to the public. "Association with the redwoods does much for man," the official folder of one of the parks asserts, "and a walk through one of the groves is a matchless and inspiring experience." I have asso ciated with redwoods by taking such walks in Big Basin and Henry Cowell State Parks. I am not sure as yet what this has done for me, and whether the experience will prove to have been inspiring or not. The answer depends on some interpreta tion I am waiting to receive. All I can say at this juncture is that, unable to place, to name what has happened to me among the redwoods, I am frightened. To indicate the nature of the terror I have experienced, I should say that, to me, "tree" is not the proper word for these wildly proliferating growths. They rise in teams shooting up from near-continuous beds of live, rooted matter that, though seemingly frozen for the moment, appear to be seeth ing and writhing under this visitor's feet. Some of these shoots, two to three hundred feet tall and thirty to fifty feet in girth, eventually fall, and moulder away to become food once more for their kin. Others, parting from a common base, form seemingly separate trees—only to meet way up among their branches and, incestuously connecting with live tissue, grow into one again in utter denial of individuation. Others yet I have found to crawl with live skin, burls, and 209</page><page sequence="3">ETC.: A REVIEW OF GENERAL SEMANTICS VOL. XVI, NO. 2 cancerous growths over dead remains for the sole purpose of living on and on. A poster mounted at the entrance of Henry Cowell Park identifies one of these specimens as having been living from the days of Alexander the Great through the first Christmas some three hundred years later, and thence on through some relatively recent events such as the discovery of America and the Declaration of Independence, to the days of the United Nations. Big Basin perhaps has been the more overwhelming of the two groves I have visited—what with its wild abandon of growth and decay, of young shafts shooting like arrows through the tangle straight toward the light; of huge, solid stems sheathed in foot-thick, bursting, shredding bark mon strously asserting their existence; of burned, wrecked ruins raising torn limbs and hideous stumps in gestures of accusa tion and despair, or sinking away in resignation-—but Henry Cowell's redwoods, once ravaged by fire (at the time of the original Mayflower), have affected me more potently with their determination—frightening to me, invigorating, perhaps, or intoxicating to others—to keep going without pride, without beauty, without any aim other than, in this case, to stretch a hideous growth of scab tissue over the raw burns and to con tinue living. I had visited Big Basin first. Thankful for its un-tidied-up state, obsessed, benumbed by what struck me as the ob scenity of its growths, its grotesque vitality, I could not see how this blatant contradiction of all civilized behavior could be made acceptable to a visitor who would be hard put to it to make esthetic or symbolic sense of this attack on his sensi bilities and values—the label "Park" having prevented him from by-passing the challenge by simply considering these redwoods a useful stand of timber. I am glad to report that the people at Henry Cowell Park have labored to blunt the edge of this attack or rather to twist it around so as to make it point in a properly acceptable direction. What does it matter if, in the process of explanation, they have used an anthropomorphic symbolism that has prosti 210</page><page sequence="4">WINTER 1959 THE OTHER RUMPELSTILTSKIN'S namb tuted the redwoods? After all, the redwoods are owned by the State now. ("Amidst fanfare from several bands and marching units," the folder says, "the deeds were formally presented to the California State Park Commission.") What does it matter, I say, if these explanations cheat the visitor out of the possible catharsis of a confrontation with a shocking otherness—as long as they spare him the shock and even suc ceed in making him feel better? It has been wondrous to see how a group of symbols drawn from the short-circuited feed-back system of the socialized self has been offered here as a bridge beneath which a, to me, as yet unanswerable threat to cultural assumptions could be allowed to drop out of sight. Already at Big Basin I had been confounded by three signs singling out three random, relatively isolated, impres sive, upstanding specimens unencumbered by throngs of off spring, by naming them Mother of the Forest (the tallest by about one hundred feet), Father of the Forest (shorter, but just as big around the middle), and Daughter of the Forest (distinctly clean of growth and somewhat less big). Yet, as compared with Henry Cowell Park, this was no more than a token effort to use the cliches of familiar nomenclature as a means to bring order into chaos. At Henry Cowell, the redwoods had been caged—not only by the balustrades that, bordering a gravelled path, differentiate between the wilder ness and the orderly world of the tourist—but also by a system of labeling, by type-written notes tucked behind glass in red wood frames bolted to the banisters. These labels at Henry Cowell Park, assiduously studied by all visitors, effectively turn all exposure to nature-in-the-raw into a socially conditioned "experience" that can safely be handled by any man, woman, or child, even though it be at the cost of logic and common sense. Some of these labels are matter-of-fact, and help to secure factual information. Thus No. 1 states: "Big Shell—the hollow remains of large redwood with a new tree growing from the top;" and No. 2, "Natural 'Graft'—Two trees grown together." Most of the other labels, however, sym 211</page><page sequence="5">ETC.: A REVIEW OF GENERAL SEMANTICS VOL. XVI, NO. 2 bolize with a vengeance. No. 4, for instance, reads: "Mother and Daughter—150 feet above the ground, these two trees have grown together to heal the scar left when the trees rubbed in the wind." One does not have to be a Freudian here to see the Mother-in-Law Complex at work. Wind, scars, and togetherness: mother and daughter, indeed! No. 8 indicates sheer nonsense, liberating though it may be in its appeal to man's superior imagination. "Jumbo Tree —254 feet high," one reads. "Named from the odd-shaped growths at its base resembling the heads of an elephant, a monkey and a bison." No. 7, two trees, is called "Three Sisters" (one has fallen). Then, thanks to some corkscrew deformation of growth, occasion is found for a joke. "Three Twisters," No. 11 is called: "The bark shows four complete twists around each tree from base to top." Aside from family references, there are those to church and state. A "Cathedral Group" (No. 16) and an "As sociation Group" (No. 17) are surrounded by a Harrison Group and by trees dedicated to Sherman, Roosevelt, Grant, and McKinley. "Because of illness he (McKinley)the folder says, under No. 10, "could not attend its dedication, but was represented by Secretary of State John Hay." Some of these dedications, one would surmise, have been part of the struggle for the conservation of natural resources. But then there stands in Henry Cowell Park also a "Pacific Fleet Tree. . . . Named during a visit of the Pacific Fleet in Santa Cruz in 1919." One of the lesser trees—No. 20, found near the exit— bears a plaque reading: "William T. Jeter, 1850-1930. Whose unselfish efforts made possible the public ownership of the Santa Cruz County Big Trees Park" (the former name of part of the present Henry Cowell State Park). This dedication rings a more complicated kind of bell, combining public thanks to Mr. Jeter with the redwoods' gratitude for having been allowed to survive and be seen. 212</page><page sequence="6">WINTER 1959 THE OTHER RUMPELSTILTSKIN'S NAME Only once in this park covering seventeen hundred acres does the labelist's symbolizing intention falter and per mit a look at a tree as a tree. It occurs at No. 19. "Wonder Tree—Fire some 250 years ago," the label asserts, "damaged the base. From 100 feet above the ground the redwood sent downward two growths which have completely covered the charred hollow base and now support the tree. The foliage of this tree is dwarfed and differs from other redwood foliage." (One can squint up into the distance beyond the growths sent down by the redwood over the charcoal and notice the oddly feathery web of twigs and needles born of the con vulsions attendant upon this feat of survival. It was when seeing this transmutation that terror gripped me). The label at the Wonder Tree adds that this transformation is some thing of unique interest to botanists—thus again turning the impact and its pain successfully away into the safe channels of science as pursued by others. Had I not seen the abandon of Big Basin before, perhaps I should have been able to accept these labels, grateful to him who had explained things to me, who had showed me that big presidents of these big United States naturally would have big trees to represent their size; and that mothers and daugh ters and sisters were the kind of people who would keep things going, with the help of scientists who kept a watchful eye on aberrations. Yet, as it was I could not forget the terror I had felt—this and the chilling inadequacy of those type-written comments. Here was life—in its glory? in its monstrosity?— and there, bereft of symbols of adequate power and dignity, was I, terrified. Where were the symbols to contain for me this life and its terror—contain them because they could speak of them, name them in terms I could accept? Where are these symbols now? Exhausted if not deranged, I arrived at my host's moun tain cabin. On my bedside table I found The Disin herited Mind by Erich Heller, and I gave my attention to "The Hazards of Modern Poetry," one of his essays. Con 213</page><page sequence="7">ETC.: A REVIEW OF GENERAL SEMANTICS VOL. XVI, NO. 2 fronted with the ironic discrepancy between current symbols and encountered reality, faced with the enormity of things that necessarily remain outside of my experience because no tool is given me to handle them, I have been grateful for what Mr. Heller has had to say. He quotes, for instance, T. S. Eliot, as I have mentioned above, continuing: . . . and so each venture Is a new beginning, a raid on the inarticulate With shabby equipment always deteriorating In the general mess of imprecision of feeling, Undisciplined squads of emotion . . . This quotation alone—wrapping, as it does, the cloak of humility around the Henry Cowell Park efforts at explanation —has helped to ease my discomfort. Mr. Heller goes farther and recognizes a revolution that, beginning with the Renais sance, has come to a climax today. "One way of speaking of the revolution I have in mind," says he, "is to say that it reduced the status of the symbol to the merely symbolic. Thus it deprived the language of religion as well as of art—" and, I want to add, of nature—"of an essential degree of reality . . . Reality, freed from its commitments to the symbol, be came more really real than before." And "as reality became more real," Mr. Heller continues ironically, "so the symbol became more symbolic and art more artistic." "But there were also signs of uneasiness," I was glad to hear Mr. Heller say in his essay. "What was first felt to be a liberation appeared more and more as a robbery. Robbed of its real significance, what did the symbol signify? Robbed of its symbolic meaning, what did reality mean?" Amen, I had wanted to say here; now the wood sprite will soon receive his name. . . But soon after having made these promising remarks, Mr. Heller disconcertingly refers to the "discovery of inward ness" as a refuge for adventurers "driven from their home land by the impoverishment of its soil." Mr. Heller here speaks of the history of poetry; he also touches upon my quest for a symbolism fit to deal with the redwoods. (The 214</page><page sequence="8">WINTER 1959 THB OTHER RUMPELSTILTSKIN'S NAME symbolism attempted at Henry Cowell Park is preposterous in more ways than one. A couple of trees becoming one flesh half way up their history should be called Marriage, to say the least, instead of Mother and Daughter. But I suspect that even such legitimate reference to "the Flesh" would not be considered acceptable by whoever they are who might effec tively criticise the symbols employed here). At Big Basin and Cowell both, unadulterated reality stares this visitor in the face—and no symbols in sight seem adequate to help him join forces with the intensity of its existence. Who is to supply the needed symbols if not the poet? I do not understand Mr. Heller's contention that the home land soil of poetry is so impoverished as to drive the poets inward. Surely a thirsty person needs a glass of water—water as well as a glass by which to convey it. The glass, if I read Mr. Heller correctly, is the symbol in the poets' hands—hands which beautify the container but are said to be unable to fill it with the much-needed water. The water, meanwhile, spills away down the gulley, mixed with sand and soil so that ani mals may drink it but not men—heavens! not civilized men who would rather drink a nationally advertised beverage drawn from a factory tank and served in bottles ("you can always rely on its quality"), thinking meanwhile of a redwood tree as a decoration in a president's button hole. The poets cannot have forgotten me for long. I am still caught in the redwoods, anxious to learn the magic name, waiting for the symbolic link . . . I remember an earlier line of Heller's: "Despair, recon ciled to life through beauty." This reconciliation, I feel, is the function of the poet. Here lies the need for communica tive symbols. Here stands my desire, waiting to be fulfilled. The redwoods are alive. In what sense am I part of them? I am back among people, among houses and books. The red woods are still with me—like a dream, perhaps, or like a 215</page><page sequence="9">ETC.: A REVIEW OF GENERAL SEMANTICS VOL. XVI, NO. 2 nightmare more real than day's life—and the wound they have torn is still unattended. Have the poets spoken? New images alone are not enough to quench the thirst and heal the wound. There is Kepes' New Landscape—showing me, among other things, the structure of smoke, enormously enlarged; or the shape of an antibiotic as revealed by an electronic micro scope. Exciting pictures all—but, alas! only pictures. Mole cules and redwood tissue: both show an overwhelming desire for control of environment. A simple fact, this is—yet one of those facts that stand frighteningly unrelated to my own need for an encompassing configuration of meaning There is L. L. Whyte's Aspects of Form, describing life a-forming in crystals, in galaxies, in patterns of thought. It is the same set of facts again: all parallels, never converging upon the aim of my quest. There also is poetry—torrents of poetry capturing the meanings of the past; and poetry today, given, according to Heller, to "the colonization of inwardness." What about the redwoods? What about the other Rumpelstiltskin's name? Where, oh poet, are the symbols that will connect my con templation with the world of action? Am I, or am I not, part of Sequoia sempervirens? I am still afraid. I am still waiting for an answer. 216</page></plain_text>
