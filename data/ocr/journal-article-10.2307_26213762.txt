By titling the feature ‘‘Conversation’’, the intercultural dimension of the construction of science is highlighted. The circulation of knowledge – be it international, interdisciplinary, or tied to specific practices – is creative, but also the result of dominating effects and misunderstandings. The choice of geopolitics as a theme is both deliberate and contingent. It is a Dresch J., Hartke W., (1955). ‘‘Discussion  sur  response to the enthusiasm this field has elicited in geography; an enthusiasm that la géopolitique’’. explains the current glut of publications and journals for the general public in a Allemagne, no. 38-39,  p. 10-13.

Over the last thirty years, this field of knowledge has been mainstreamed and rehabilitated. A ‘‘discussion on geopolitics’’ was held at the Sorbonne sixty years ago, bringing together two leaders of the French and German schools of geography. We chose this moment as a starting point for a current debate on these themes. Little known, despite having figured in the bibliographies of W. Hartke and J. Dresch, this discussion took place a mere decade after the fall of the Third Reich. During a Franco-German encounter, what terms could possibly be used to examine geopolitics? Which action models could the era’s politic players use to discuss geopolitics, based on either current events or their own experience? Featuring this conversation was our way of paying homage to two key geographers of the 20th century. W. Hartke (1908-1997) was an eminent founder of German social geography. He spent his lifetime committed to maintaining a fruitful dialogue with his French colleagues2. It was also an opportunity to reconsider Jean Dresch (1905-1994), both through his perspective on his positions concerning geopolitics and political geo- graphy and his testimony on one of his lesser known commitments: his early support for Communist China. The conversation reveals the reactions of a communist geographer to his trip to Mao’s China, only a few short years after the revolution. These reactions are all the more forceful today in light of current changes across the globe and amongst the world’s political powers. We begin with long excerpts from this ‘‘discussion on geopolitics’’ that took place between two young geography professors, J. Dresch from the Sorbonne and W. Hartke from Munich (cf. Document). Led by Henri Brunschwig, a colonial historian, the dis- cussion (in fact, two parallel lectures) was followed by questions from the public, mostly eminent French Germanists (Alfred Grosser, Edmond Vermeil, Louis Leibrich, Jacques Verdeaux, and the jurist Bernard Lavergne). All were highly committed to the reconciliation between France and Germany; already underway ten years after the end of the conflict, though still heavily influenced by the idea of German guilt.

Participants were Professor HARTKE, Director of the Institute of Geography of Munich, and Professor DRESCH of the Sorbonne. It was chaired by Professor BRUNSCHWIG of the École nationale de la France d’Outre-Mer and the Institut d’études poli- tiques. Though we are proud to have been able to triple the normal amount to this interesting debate, cuts were still needed. As usual, we reduced very little of what was said about Germany and rather, chose to pare down the discussion on France. We extend our apologies to Professor Dresch and several other participants of the discussion). M. BRUNSCHWIG’S INTRODUCTION I am greatly humbled and honored to present today my two colleagues in geography, despite being a historian myself. Professor Hartke is an old friend I met in Berlin. Today he brilliantly represents the new German School of Geography that is particularly inter- ested in Social Geography. By focusing on man, this School is linked to the French School of Geography, the heirs of Vidal de La Blache. The French School is also brilliantly represented by Professor Dresch from the Sorbonne, whom you all know. He too, in his publications and research primarily focused on North Africa, has always been essentially interested in man and his impact on the environment. The subject we have chosen is Geopolitics. It is a subject that most presume to know. We all have our position on the subject and question it when we look to focus our opinions. It is a well-known topic because, over the past several decades, there has unfortunately been much debate over the question. As we all know, Geopolitics was the official doctrine of National-Socialism. It is still debated and certain countries are still proud to encourage its progress. I hope that after this debate, we will have a precise definition of the field; which will inform our choices on whether to defend its inclusion as one of the sciences or to deploy our best efforts ‘‘to wring its neck’’. M. HARTKE’S LECTURE Geography as science or justification For many foreigners, as well as many Germans, Geopolitics is an error of science, a false ideology. Those who condemn it thusly also frequently add that it was invented by the Germans. This statement is both false and in a sense true. It is false in that the very term did not come from Germany. The Swedish professor of Political Science, Dr Kjellén formulated the oft quoted definition, ‘‘Geopolitics is a science of the State as a geographical organism, a phenomenon in space.’’ It would also be wrong to attribute to German Science, to German Geography, the exclusive responsibility of the invention of geopolitics. Undoubtedly, a large number of German geographers, even well known best friends, have written works and collaborated on Geopolitical journals. One of our geographers, Banse for example, has surely so 3 Discussion sur la géopolitique </page> <page sequence="4"> utterly played with this notion that even the leaders of National Socialism considered him unbearable. However, in many other countries there are active protagonists of geo- political thought amongst both our precursors and our contemporaries. It is in the United States that we are witnessing one of the most vigorous resurrections of geopolitical ideas. From 1934 to 1942, when they reached their peak in Germany, dominating how politics was conducted, there was barely a social gathering from Washington to Chicago where they were not discussed with the utmost seriousness. Many geo-politicians, who were ashamed in the past, now appear publicly in Germany and seem to have noticed portents on its new departure. However, it is true that Geopolitics is a German invention in that it is in Germany that it very recently held sway over practical politics. It was the doctrine of the Nationalist Socialist state. Its beginnings were successful and it developed to attain great success, before knowing no success whatsoever but with much blood, sweat and tears from the entire world. It is thus easy to understand that first Geopolitics, then geo-politicians, were held responsible for the crimes of National Socialism. The great criminal was Hitler; but to the eyes of the world, Haushofer was the father of his ideology. Since the latter was an officer, a general, and a professor in one of Germany's greatest universities; since he had traveled extensively and was knowledgeable in many topics; he became representative. He became the scapegoat, responsible for all damage caused by National Socialism. Through him, all of German science was held responsible for the wrongdoings of the regime and for abusing a notion, which, if it had been kept strictly within a scientific field, might have been useful... and I underline the ‘‘might have been’’! What were the origins of this notion? [...] How is it [that this doctrine] was used by politi- cians and that its lessons continue to haunt them across the world, despite the disastrous consequences it had had on Germany? It is probably due to the fact that politicians constantly need to justify their actions... ... However, in what measure is it exact, as stated by politicians, to say that geography determines the politics of various countries? Which factors and which geographies are we talking about? The question has not always been considered. When the Pope divided the world between Spain and Portugal, to the treaty of Tordesillas, during the 15th cen- tury, there was no need for a geopolitical doctrine. He knew that God’s representative on Earth would be obeyed. There was also no need when the principle of ‘‘cujus regio ejus religio’’ was still in vigor. This principle continues to explain, in large part, the territorial map of Germany. The Prince's authority sufficed during the 18th century. ENVIRONMENTAL DETERMINISM? The question was raised when scientific progress led men to hope that they would discover all of nature's secrets and when they began to invoke natural laws to justify their endeavors. The first to formulate determinist ideas, both in geography and politics, were certainly the French, Vauban for example, then Montesquieu. Then, naturally, appeared the godfathers of Geopolitics: the philosophers Fichte, Herder, Hegel; then the great minds of the 19th century in Germany, Humboldt, Ritter, Ratzel; and finally the Anglo-American Orienta- lists, Mackinder, Markham and Semple, Huntington, Van Valkenburg, contemporaries of Haushofer. © L’Espace géographique 4 </page> <page sequence="5"> For the philosopher, Herder, the earth is a sort of educational institution. The Lord had built it but it was up to man to recognize its aspects and limits and to adapt. This meant hard work but with the promise of happiness, eternal happiness... A state apparatus that would eradicate the deep opposition between man and nature, one that would offer man a perfect education, his perfect adaptation to the conditions laid down by God... that would be true paradise! In a similar conception, everything we see in nature and in the landscape, everything that is used as the foundation for the politician – or any other individual – to act: nature, the ground, the climate, frontiers, their value in the life of a people, the very character of these peoples, everything is offered by Providence. We can make mistakes and be mistaken, cons- ciously or not, in the exploitation of certain regions; but sooner or later, whether we want to or not, God and the law of nature he created will put us back on the right path. The newly discovered natural sciences would help us. Man need only follow their laws in order to live in good faith with a good God. This then, Ladies and Gentlemen, is the origin of the doctrine on space, considered a natural organism - we all remember Kjellén’s term – one which is independent, obeying to its own, biological laws, and in opposition to man. Here are the roots of the doctrines of the sense of space, of the constraints of space, of national space, of vital space, of natural space. Here are the roots of concepts such as mare nostrum or mar liberum, natural frontiers be they rivers or mountains, but always the only frontiers possible. And here too are the roots of a certain idea of nature's vengeance... when its imperatives have been neglected by politicians whose sense of space has proven to be deficient. This has led to the need for an adequate science, a perfect knowledge of the essential factors of the mechanism. Let us take a closer look at the factors. It is of course very easy to classify the superficial forms of topography. The earth’s relief presents, among other things, the considerable advantage of not protesting when misinterpreted by man. For elements such as the climate, it is already much more diffi- cult to understand its relationship with man and with the creation of States. We are already hard pressed to establish the limits between a dry climate and a wet one. ... We cannot blame Ratzel, whose chair I am honored to occupy, for having tried to infer the politics and the character of sea populations from the form of their coasts. A hundred years ago, he did not have access to the same knowledge as we do today. We had absolute faith in the existence of a causal relationship between the shape of coasts and man, between the climate and man, between blood and soil. No scientific experi- ment had been carried out. Observations and statistics were inexistent in the social sciences. Ratzel’s faith, perhaps a rather mystical one, was valued as scientific hypothesis. Ratzel himself was aware of this. However, any author who, in 1942, writes a book on the man of granite and the man of Buntsandstein, on their different behaviors, and who finds a publisher, has no excuse. The 19th century produced a large body of research on the reciprocal influences of man and nature. Real scholars know the precariousness of their theories. They have often warned their public of applying their theories towards a practical goal. However, their ideas have a distinct advantage that has since turned out to be a great danger. The doctrine of 5 Discussion sur la géopolitique </page> <page sequence="6"> immediate causal relationships between man and nature, between man and his environ- ment, was easily accepted by the masses that were beginning to grasp such ideas. [...] The disciples of the great geo-materialists of the 19th century took advantage of this. THE PERMANENCE OF MYTHS It is certainly for this reason that these old notions have remained so vital, that they reappear periodically, and are used by political leaders looking for a myth to lead the masses. Scholars, with their slowness, their doubts, their conscience disappoint politicians who pretend they detain the truth when scholars continue tirelessly to search for it. Therein also lies a great temptation for leaders with weak characters, who are as prolific in politics as they are, for example... in universities! The temptation is to blame Providence, or the Führer, or space, or any other element of the environment, from the ground to the climate. They are thus nothing more than executors; they are following the laws of nature. This is where notions of vital space intervene, notions of the Heartland, the Catena mediana, of natural frontiers, of all these organisms with their own lives and who impose their laws on man. The most recent of these notions comes from America. It is the notion of the peripheral zone, launched by Spykman, in his 1942 work on the strategy of America and world politics. According to him, the peripheral regions, in this case the Old World, Europe, are literally begging a strong power to protect them so that peace can reign across the world. Spaces beg even if the populations do not understand the joy that is to befall them. Spaces also threaten so that a neighbor does not take them over and use them. And the laws of biology that are immanent to space in the end, gives reason to the strongest, the one with the best geographer – what an honor! – one who reacts most quickly. According to this thesis, it seems to me that what remains of Germany today could very well be considered a peripheral region by certain contemporary geo-politicians to such an extent that the slogan of the Heartland (mother region), situated by Mackinder in central Europe, is no longer fashionable. Thus, as you can see, any form of geopolitics is an attempt to create a science of the relationship between man and his environment as needed by the practice of politics. In other words, it is a sort of guide to the art of being right. All versions of geopolitics run the same risk as yesterday’s German geopolitics or America’s current version. The danger is to surpass the limits of science. Geopolitics does so when it affirms more than we know about infinitely complex relationships; when it does not stand up to those who glean more from its factors than the doctrine can give. At first, Haushofer was not conscious of these breaches. Then he wholeheartedly protested against them and it is perhaps the consciousness of his responsibility that drove him to sui- cide. [...] It is perhaps not a coincidence that so many grand utopias, such as the irrigation of the Sahara, human impact on the climate, the drying up of the Mediterranean Sea, the National Socialist program... were authored by engineers. We now know why something as primitive as geopolitics has survived so long; why this determinism is still allowed when physics long ago renounced its own form; that the psychology of crowds has long abandoned the methods of Dr Le Bon, etc. The only expla- nation is in the ease. Today, things have become so complicated for man to understand. Therefore, in order to act, we use old explanations, immediately intelligible by the leaders and the masses. It is © L’Espace géographique 6 </page> <page sequence="7"> therefore the task of true scholars, of defenders of a well-understood geopolitics, to warn the general public against the dangers and the abuses of this pseudo-science because a certain form of geopolitics is as dangerous as an atomic bomb. [...] THE TWO HAUSHOFERS It is a scholar’s duty to warn the public because his dignity and scientific liberty are at stake. We Germans witnessed a perfect example when geopolitics reigned over our land. Hausho- fer's destiny illustrates these dangers well. Arrested at the end of the war, he was questioned for months by the Americans. He was freed before committing suicide. He had not been mistreated; it would seem that his judges hoped the interrogation would reveal the secret of National Socialism. Instead, Haushofer became aware of his responsibility. He had created an instrument that politicians used in hopes of creating a military empire and thus obtain absolute power. He had first been flattered by the success of his ideas; later, when he wanted to intervene, he was shunned by his own disciples. Finally, his examining magistrates hated him. One of them, the highly honorable American geo-politician, Edgar Walsh, was questioned by Haushofer’s son about what remained of the accusation against his father concerning his alleged war crimes. The judge answered, ‘‘Very little, but at the same quite a lot. Geopoliticians taught national socialism to think through space.’’ And he added, ‘‘We cannot like them but we cannot deny that we have learned a lot thanks to them.’’ Haushofer’s second son, Albrecht, was also a Professor of Geopolitics in Berlin. His work on geopolitics appeared posthumously in 1951. He vainly tried to sway the Nazi leaders away from their errors. He was executed without trial literally on the last day of the catastrophe in 1945 by an anonymous SS, who stood for the system birthed by geo- politics. Albrecht Haushofer was considered dangerous for the future; he was blamed for his integrity and for his knowledge about the true relationships between Man and his environment. If you would like to know more about the moving tragedy of this man and his family, you can read the document found in the hands of Albrecht Haushofer, dead among the ruins somewhere behind the Berlin prison, the Moabit, during the fall of Berlin. It is titled the ‘‘Sonnets of Moabit’’, which I have in my hands and whose French translation has just been published. [...] M. DRESCH’S LECTURE French scholarship against geopolitics After Professor Hartke’s limpid presentation, it is clear the extent to which geopolitics has been lauded in Germany and the weighty responsibilities it has indubitably shoul- dered. The same cannot be said of France where the very term ‘‘geopolitics’’ has yet to be introduced into our language. We can go so far as to say the very notion of geopolitics has not entered our traditions. Occasionally, there is talk of Political Geography in the general public, in the newspapers, in journal articles. Political Geography is not taught. Though there is a Chair at the Sorbonne for ‘‘Political and Economic Geography’’, I do not think the chair holder has ever tried to truly give a class on geopolitics. Ultimately, 7 Discussion sur la géopolitique </page> <page sequence="8"> because there is occasionally the need to address the themes of geopolitics, we do some- times look for the relationship between man and space, planning, the occupation of space. However, we are reluctant to place these discussions and debates under any specific banner. Occasionally, we look for new terms, larger and more comprehensive ones. One example is the more comprehensive term ‘‘Geohistory’’, which one of today's foremost historians has tried to launch. What are the reasons behind such scruples amongst professors, French professors that is, concerning Geopolitics? I see two main reasons. First, Geopolitics is generally considered to have come to us from Germany. This is par- tially correct, though more incorrect than not [...][but] German authors introduced Geopolitics to France and every Frenchman knows that this form of geopolitics was used to justify a policy, which in general was used against the French. It is therefore not surprising that Geopolitics has had bad press. However, I do not think this is the only reason that we are so wary of this science. I believe that the discretion of professors when confronted with Geopolitics is largely explained by the very structure of our University system. French scholarship has long enjoyed a practical and theoretical freedom from public powers. It is very proud of this and it nourishes an instinctive wariness of any political manifestation, at least those that are overtly visible. It jealously protects a sense of the relativity, at least the objectivism of which most of our universities are extremely proud. This sense of relati- vity, this objectivism has unfortunately often resulted in confining French scholarship within the nation. The university scholar remains in its chair [...] and we are forced to admit that science is rarely called on, despite being recognized, when it comes to applying it to events involving politics [...] and a subject of rather frequent grievances and complaints amongst my colleagues is that they consider their role is to solely create students and nothing else. [This is why] Geopolitics has clearly been poorly received since it is by definition definitively an applied form of politics. [...] THE GEOPOLITICS OF JUSTIFICATION IN FRANCE However, this does not mean that Geopolitics does not exist in France. We could even say, as Professor Hartke remarked, that Geopolitics is a French invention. Starting roughly around the 17th century, it saw the day in France with Cardinal de Richelieu himself, France's greatest geo-politician, whose legacy is a masterpiece on the subject. There were many other authors during that century as well. Professor Hartke talked of Montesquieu and the geographical determinism that underlies his works, the influence of climates, the influence of space... Many other philosophers throughout the 17th century can also be considered true founders of geopolitics as a science in and of itself, at a moment when the natural and the political sciences were developing. However, we are forced to realize that though French geopolitics may have had an indirect influence on revolutionary doctrines, it did not have any true practical application, which was certainly to its advantage. It was only during the 19th century in France that Geopolitics was practiced to a cer- tain extent, though no longer by university scholars, nor philosophers, nor patented geographers. Circumstances were very different during the 19th century. Certainly, in © L’Espace géographique 8 </page> <page sequence="9"> Germany, Geopolitics was created as a discipline and given a well recognized name. It was to be a scientific discipline following the evolution of both the natural sciences, as always, and a political science based for the most part on the interpretation of the development of the great modern States. In France, Geopolitics, from this moment on, never entered University. It was more or less clearly presented outside the realms of scholarship by publicists or politicians who used the givens of Geopolitics or more precisely, geopolitical theories, in order to justify a state of affairs. What was this state of affairs? During the 19th century, the world was divided up between a certain number of Imperialist powers, one of which was France. Geopolitics, in France, was given the goal of justifying this imperialism, in other words the power of a dominant bourgeois class that basically sought, within a strongly constituted and industrialized State, to justify the economy that it enjoyed, an economy based on the export of capitals, the search for markets of raw materials, and basic outlets that would allow it to control key communication channels. Thus, geopolitics, was indeed destined to justify the supremacy over a space that had spread to include the entire world; but justification was the goal, political justifica- tions, moral justifications. Furthermore, starting at this moment, especially in France, geopolitics was presented as the contrary of a science. Indeed, it had never been presented by scholars. The goal had been reached; the empire was built. It was simply a question of legitimization... ... Thus, we engaged in geopolitics. We could even say that France introduced geopolitics. However, when Geography was established as a science, the patented geographers stopped using geopolitics. [...] What were or are the themes of French geopolitics? [Professor Dresch proceeds with a brilliant demonstration of themes such as ‘‘the will for (French) power’’: a theory of large spaces, the spread of the revolutionary legacy, EurAfrica, etc.] [...] We might be led to believe that any geopolitical activity, in France or Germany, is the contrary of science and that there is no scientific Geopolitics. Geopolitics would thus be nothing more than a pseudo science. Politicians or politicists stole it from geographers and used it for partisan goals. SERIOUS GEOPOLITICS AND THE EXAMPLE OF CHINA I think geographers – and I believe Professor Hartke agrees with me – may protest at this point, defending the existence of a true political geography or Geopolitics, that is to say an applied geography such as a science of space, a science of the occupation and planning of said space. Clearly, this science must, like all sciences, be a science with a careful and rigorous methodology. It must start by meticulously compiling a complete inventory of all natural phenomena. It must be said that French geopolitics, when less applied to Europe – which of course we are starting to know – and with more of a focus on Overseas, could not be used scientifically on Overseas Territories for which it had no topographic maps, no geolo- gical [or] climatic maps. [...] [The] fact that the study of our Overseas Territories remains in its infancy [shows] what is left to accomplish in order to precisely conceive 9 Discussion sur la géopolitique </page> <page sequence="10"> a certain number of speculations on the possibilities of rationally occupying these terri- tories. However, I believe that if [...] we each work methodically in our domains and accumulate sufficient knowledge to offer precise information on the physical and human environment, then geography can [...] become a true science of the relationship between man and his environment, of the occupation of the land, of the development of the land. There are countries where this science is an applied reality, or at least where an effort has been made to apply it. I will give only one example that I personally witnessed six months ago during a trip to China and which, in this perspective, was for me extremely instructive. China is a vast country that was, and remains, an underdeveloped country, if such a notion can be applied, and by which I simply mean a country whose resources have not been entirely revealed, those that are known are only partially developed, a country where heavy industry in particular has only just begun. When the Chinese gained control over their destiny, they set out to scientifically dis- cover their country and immediately used the acquired information to begin organizing their country at the regional level. And this regional level of organization poses political problems. It is extraordinary to witness the ferocious desire of the Chinese to discover their own country. Countless teams of scientists were sent in all directions in order to draw up topographical, geological, mineralogical, pedological, etc maps of their country. They also set out to discover the human side of their country. After the long consultation and the long survey that accompanied the first scientific census of their population – its first scientific accounting –, when they were trying to determine the composition of their population, they also launched an extremely detailed human investigation that is the basis of their draft constitution, voted last September. Indeed, China has a centralized constitution, it is a centralized state and not a federal one; however, within the centralized State, there are a number of national minorities. What is a national minority? It is difficult to explain. While it is clear that a national minority is defined by its language, its historical traditions, its customs, its national conscious... these languages, especially amongst relatively backward populations, are complicated by a number of dialects; the customs imply a number of local varieties. How does one define a national minority on a map? How is its frontier delineated? Well, these Chinese men of science launched and are pursuing a veritable scientific investigation in order to discover how to precisely define and project a national minority on a map. They sent teams of linguists, teams of ethnographers, sociologists into the regions where these national minorities live. After lengthy studies, they managed to deli- neate a certain number of national minorities that are recognized as such and who have maintained the use of their language, their customs and have organized themselves into administrative units. They are continuing their observations. [...] A human reality has been recognized. However, these national minorities, the result of a long historical tradi- tion, are not necessarily viable economically and the task of confronting, of balancing human and economic realities, of respecting all these realities and ensuring they coexist harmoniously, is, in my eyes, a true geopolitical project, a Geopolitics that is not simply theoretical, but is applied without doctrine, except with respect to science. Thus, I believe that Geopolitics can be a science, an applied science, one of the most typical forms of application in Geography. © L’Espace géographique 10 </page> <page sequence="11"> M. BRUNSCHWIG’S COMMENTS Thank you Mr. Dresch for such an interesting lecture, following up Mr. Hartke’s pre- sentation. I noticed that one and the other are both in agreement over the fact that Geopolitics, as defined until now, is not a science. It was taught by professors and scholars in Germany. These professors and scholars created demi-scholars who were attracted to the ease of the ideas presented. However, in reality, as Hartke so rightly pointed out, this German Geo- politics does not deserve to be called a science. It has been more a political arsenal than a true science. In France, stated Dresch – and his remark is extremely curious – geopolitics has never entered the University. To what extent do the different ideals and theses, on which we based the conquest of the Colonial Empire, pertain to geopolitics? [...] It is clear that we must correlate them with the ideas expressed by other metropoles during the same time period: the English, the Americans, the Russians, and the Germans too, who also had their colonial Empires. In any case, the two speakers both condemn previous forms of Geopolitics as a science; it was not a science. Does this mean that the problem it raises, a fundamental problem in the relationship between Man and his environment, cannot be addressed scientifically? I believe that our two speakers would also agree on this point. The only objection I may have is when Dresch speaks of China. I would like to know if the term ‘‘Geopolitics’’ is important to him, because the work program he presented has more to do with Geography. The latter is enough without using the term Geopolitics, which could be misconstrued. Furthermore, as it has been applied until now, it has not been very satisfying for humanity in general. [...] THE DISCUSSION M.GROSSER. — I would like to ask Mr. Hartke to explain the difference between Geopo- litics as defined by Mr. Dresch and the untranslatable German term ‘‘Raumforschung’’? M. HARTKE. — I will try to answer in French, please forgive me if I do not express myself clearly. Raumforschung is something entirely different. It is an attempt to study, to inventory, similar to that carried out in China. We are only too aware that, from time to time, perhaps without even wanting to, ideas emerge that we know very well, Geopolitical ideas if you will, geographical ideas, sometimes racist ideas, and other ideas too, more pleasant ones. However, there are also ideas that are just as vigorous, effective, perhaps without wanting to. You all know that in West Germany at least, everyone has become a democrat; we took advantage of a deep-seated education, we have nothing else left, however... M. BRUNSCHWIG. — ... only, clearly, here too we encounter an idea that I noticed several times during Mr. Hartke’s conference and which struck me. At several moments, he used the expression ‘‘consciously or not’’. Well, when you speak with certain German colleagues – which has happened often during my trips – or read certain books, it is very surprising to encounter certain terms. This is why I spoke up, I protested earlier against the word ‘‘Geopolitics’’. We end up using words from a lexis that previously meant one thing, which may be slightly different 11 Discussion sur la géopolitique </page> <page sequence="12"> than today. We are once again confronted with sub-conscious memories of what National-Socialist Geopolitics used to be. Let me explain with an example I find truly curious. Recently, I came across a book written by a well known German Professor, W. Hellpach, who states he is the founder, or at least one of the founders, of another new science in Germany: folk psychology (Völkerpsychologie). M. HARTKE. — ... Geopsychology... [...] M. VERMEIL. — Hellpach published a book that is interesting in that the author tries his hand at ‘‘Stämme’’ psychology. In French, I have dubbed this ‘‘ethnic groupings’’ who have crossed the Elbe in order to colonize. This sums up German history. What struck me is that Meinecke and others use psychology in terms of space to demonstrate that the German ethnic groupings that arrived in Bavaria remain Saxon; but their chil- dren become Bavarian. I don’t know how much is true in the account. However, there are elements of Vôlkerpsychologie. M. HARTKE. – I am not Bavarian, on the contrary; but there is an excellent example in Munich. I am not Bavarian, nor Prussian, I am lucky to be from the Rhineland. In Bavaria, there is a boundary that has remained very distinct between Franconia and Bavaria. This boundary cuts through Munich and Augsburg. [...] People still quarrel over the topic. M. VERMEIL. – The author I mentioned asked himself the following question, ‘‘Do the German people share general characteristics?’’ This same question appears in the work of other historians. [...] Can a science be created here? Geopsychology? M. HARTKE. – It's possible. I see the possibility to use something that comes from America, which is really interesting. With modern methods, we can one day solve terribly complicated problems. I believe that here, we can find the way, the system, to slip into the complex, which certainly plays out psychologically first. [...] M. GROSSER. — Forgive me for forging ahead on this path. I regret that Mr. Minder could not attend this evening because we are heading straight towards a question Mr. Brunschwig addressed with his question on Hellpach's book and the question of determining characteristics based on ethnic data. M. LAVERGNE. — You mentioned China. I am not a geographer but it seems that you alluded to how the Chinese use Human Geography and their knowledge of the subject. This is not geopolitics. M. DRESCH. — They gave a general definition of political geography. Let us not use Geopolitics anymore since we have given the term a pejorative definition. Let us simply talk about Political Geography to avoid all pejorative or laudatory connotations. If Political Geography is a form of geography applied to the occupation and planning of a given space, then the Chinese practice Political Geography. M. LEIBRICH. — The term ‘‘Geopolitics’’ is fundamentally ambivalent. It is not at all equivalent or synonymous with Political Geography. However, Geopolitics, according to both of your presentations, is in the end a form of politics that can be explained and justi- fied; whereas ‘‘Political Geography’’, which you would like to use instead, is an expression with little meaning in French. The word ‘‘geopolitics’’ was imported from Germany, and for this very reason is wrong, because the word ‘‘geopolitics’’, in German, means a policy based on the study of geography and not a geography that studies political realities. Thus, we could substitute Mr. Brunschwig’s suggestion and replace Geopolitics by © L’Espace géographique 12 </page> <page sequence="13"> Human Geography, or Political Geography, or Economic Geography, which then would be a specifically French expression that would express a more tangible reality for the French mind. M. VERDEAUX. — It would seem that the idea of Geopolitics is the idea that there is a relationship between the composition of a terrain and the politics to be undertaken. It is an idea and it is possible to have it. We discussed Russia. Whether or not it has clearly manifested itself, there is a Russian Geopolitics. It is the search for free spaces, where people can live and be secure. [...] I believe that in this form of politics, there is something more scientific. However no doctrine has ever been stated. I believe it could be Geo- politics. M. DRESCH. — Certain would even say Geohistory. M. VERDEAUX. — Which would explain the politics. Like Mr. Jourdain who used prose without knowing it, so they used Geopolitics without knowing. M. DRESCH. — It is Geohistory that clearly takes into account data from Physical Geography [...]. There are a certain number of themes that were ridiculed for being simplistic. This does not mean there wasn't a grain of truth. [...] Geopolitics was ridiculed because it has always been made up of slogans or simplistic ideas that are by definition unscientific. * Source: ‘‘Discussion sur la géopolitique’’, Allemagne, 1955, no. 38-39, p. 10-13.

Later that same year, the journal published the discussion between Wolfgang Hartke and Jean Dresch, chaired by Henri Brunschwig5. I would like to take this opportunity to present a few remarks inspired by Hartke’s presentation and by the different comments that followed. First though, I would like to take a moment to discuss the context of the May 6, 1955 meeting, held right before the tenth anniversary of Germany’s surrender. I do not know if the entire lecture and the public's remarks were published. It was not easy for a professor from across the Rhine to convince a public to accept his defense of German geography. Thus, Brunschwig, one of the first to talk, was concerned about the renewed use of the word ‘‘Geopolitics’’ and of the return among certain authors, such as Willy Hellpach, of terms he qualified as ‘‘sub-conscious memories’’ of the Socialist-National Geopolitics. Hartke clearly knew how to convince with the sincerity of his answers, all the while putting things into perspective with quite a bit of humor when it came to the corporation's tendencies and practices. ‘‘Geography as science or justification’’ is a title that clearly states his position. His aim in the aftermath of the terrible Nazi military adventure was to show the extent to which the conquests undertaken were preceded and supported by assertions and the legitimization of many German intellectuals. The latter borrowed the term ‘‘geopoli- tics’’ (Geopolitik) from Rudolf Kjellén and multiplied publications aimed at preparing the Third Reich's annexations and the suppression of minorities. For Hartke, if such publications were distributed so widely, it was because there is an apparent facility in wielding determinist explanations: the annexation of a space is considered because the region in question offers ‘‘favorable conditions’’ for the German people. Hartke shows that geopolitical argumentations were based on research carried out by German geographers; some of whom were quite prominent such as Friedrich Ratzel. He thought he could link ‘‘natural conditions’’, notably the configuration of space occupied by a population, with  the character of the inhabitants. Hartke exone- rated Ratzel by explaining that ‘‘the same knowledge was not available [at the time] as it is today’’. Then, Hartke attacked the permanence that many attribute to the myths concerning spaces conceived as organisms. Here he glossed over living space, merely mentioning it. It would have been interesting to discuss the drift of the word ‘‘Lebensraum’’, literally ‘‘life space’’, that is to say, the space in which life is deployed, along with the circulation and activities of a population. This is how it was first used by Ratzel, the term later came to 5. Dresch J., Hartke W. (1955). ‘‘Discussion mean a space claimed for the well-being of a people (Volk ohne Raum). However, this sur la géopolitique’’. passage is undoubtedly the sharpest criticism of Geopolitik. ‘‘All geopolitics are an effort Allemagne. no. 38-39,  p. 10-13. to create science with the relationship between man and the environment needed by the practice of politics; or geopolitics is a kind of guide in the art of always being right.’’ He 6.

In the passage sub-titled ‘‘The two Haushofers’’, Hartke discusses the dramatic turn of events. The illusory and criminal nature of the geopolitical theory turned against their main author. Overwhelmed by the tragic events he helped to create, after the fall of the Reich, in prison, he became aware of his crushing guilt and committed suicide. His second son, Albrecht, a more critical geopolitician, had fallen out of favor and was assassinated by the SS... Hartke ends his lecture evoking these tragic ends and with a quote from the ‘‘Moabit sonnets’’ by Albrecht Haushofer: ‘‘The time has gone when a scholar, not needing morals, abandoned to the government the use of his body and the knowledge he had earned.’’ Hartke’s morality is revealed in the closing lines of his lecture, as in several of his answers to the public’s questions and remarks. With incredible honesty – he does not hesitate to criticize the Raumforschung, institutionalized and in vogue at the time, qua- lifying it as an inventory of diverse spatial content. ‘‘From it appears [...] Geopolitical ideas, [...] sometimes racist ones.’’ Along the same lines, ‘‘The Naturraum, the natural regions. This is how to proceed to deliver something to the government. We draw up maps [...]. We publish them, we get funding that makes real geographers jealous.’’ In other words, he had a sharp sense of humor... punctuated with sincerity and spontaneity. In response to a question by Edmond Vermeil on the psychology of the Stämme (ethnic groups established during the Middle Ages), he drops, ‘‘I am not Bavarian, I repeat, nor Prussian, I am lucky to be from the Rhineland’’. I simply wanted to state what a pleasure it was for me to discover this text and its answers. It brought back the moments spent by his side, both during the tour of Germany he organized in 19717, and when he participated in meetings for L’Espace géographique.— Pierre Riquet 1955, geopolitics and applied geography The start of the dialogue between these two geographers can be pinpointed: the beginning of the French-German reconciliation of course, but also the moment in France when the Indochinese war as well as the French colonial presence in Tunisia and Morocco had all come to an end. Though the Algerian war had just started in November 1954, nobody at the time imagined what would come. In August 1954, in Skikda (Philippeville), the National Liberation front (FLN) would assert itself as a real armed force. Our two geographers dismissed the term ‘‘geopolitics’’ as a mystification. For Wolfgang Hartke, it is an analysis of the role of geography as a justification for terri- torial politics, as either development policies within the State or imperial politics (blaming societies' internal failures on nature or ‘‘fate, or the Führer, or space’’. He notes that adhering to geography as applied by demi-gods (irrigating the Sahara... but he does not mention the great water works in the USSR) is more the result of work by engineers than of pure scientists. In a commentary on Jean Dresch, Hartke explains that in order to accept planning, ‘‘we do use certain ideologies, certain 7.

And, with nothing better to offer, (1972, no. 447) on governments are given natural regions and ‘‘we even celebrate the fact that there are ‘‘La République fédérale certain similarities’’ with certain social realities. This is when ‘‘we get [governmental] allemande’’, which waswritten after this study funding that makes real geographers jealous’’. trip. 15 Pierre Riquet </page> <page sequence="16"> For Dresch, French geography is safe from being exploited thanks to the com- partmentalization of university disciplines (a compartmentalization he criticizes, citing Fernand Braudel’s geo-history, which was just barely emerging in 1955). Within this compartmentalization, politics was only barely a scientific object and only very recently at that: in 1945, the École libre de sciences politiques was natio- nalized and in 1955, none of the provincial Political Science Institutes  had yet been created after the Parisian Institute. For Dresch, a possible geopolitics would be the applied geography that was emerging at the time in France and which needed to start with ‘‘meticulously compiling a complete inventory of all natural phenomena.’’ This required, especially for ‘‘our overseas territories’’, the addition of studies in the humanities, which were still in a state of ‘‘infantilism’’. Dresch had just returned from his first trip to the People’s Republic of China and had seen the emergence of a form of applied geography that inspired him. The first priority was the inventory of the resources of an unfamiliar country where ‘‘heavy industry had only just begun’’ (an implicit reference to Soviet development). There was also a need to know the territories and their populations in a heavily centralized State, which however included a certain number of national minorities. Scientists had managed to ‘‘surround’’ (meaning to grasp and define... but also to protect as well as supervise?) these national minorities, who were to be integrated into viable regional units. Dresch’s experiences in northern Africa had undoubtedly made him more attune to the problems of these minorities (he knew their Berber counterparts in the Arab speaking world).— Claude Bataillon, Cnrs Toulouse Geopolitics: From radicality to ubiquity Though the debate may seem a bit dated today, we must bear in mind that at the time, it was impossible to forget the Nazi conception of geopolitics. More deeply however, the divergence is due to the conception of geography as uniquely a science of the ‘‘relationship between man and his environment’’. Jean Dresch underlines the distinction between the natural environment and the human factors that use the environment. As a part of physical geography, dominated at the time by morphology, the natural environment obeyed its own laws that were in opposi- tion to man, and it operated in a single direction on human societies. There was simply ‘‘a relationship between the composition of the terrain and the politics to be followed.’’ This explains why there is a geography of Russia in the research for free space. The other element of this disparity with the years that followed is the dis- trust of politics, which led Dresch to extol the ‘‘serious geography of Communist China, dedicated to the objective analysis of national minorities (an objectivity that was tempered however by the need to integrate certain of these minorities into ‘‘viable economic units’’ which would cause them to disappear...). The man of science ‘‘had no geopolitical ideas in mind’’. The phenomenon of differentiation and the contradictions that developed among societies and the spaces they occupy were not taken into account and were erased in favor of ‘‘geo-history’’, considered synonymous with geopolitics. It would be another twenty years before the publica- tion of the American journal, Antipode, and Yves Lacoste’s book, La Géographie, ça sert, d’abord, à faire la guerre. Their aim was to explain political behaviors through geographic variables, to analyze the interaction between geographic space and the © L’Espace géographique 16 </page> <page sequence="17"> resulting realities of power, the rivalry and tensions that began and grew within the territory. In the context of French geography in the 1950s, imagining a ‘‘politically engaged’’ discipline was simply impossible. The 21st century has of course added to the debate the analysis of the represen- tations of ethnic groups, religious confessions, and environmental attitudes. In a sense, we could say that geopolitics has become omnipresent, but in a very different context than that which garnered criticism and skepticism from geographers in the 1950s.— Yves Guermond, université de Rouen China as seen by Jean Dresch in the mid 1950s In 1955, Wolfgang Hartke and Jean Dresch engaged in a conversation on geopolitics, mediated by Henri Brunschwig, and published in the revue, Allemagne. The speakers reframed the notion historically, traced its instrumentalization by the former German National-Socialist regime, and questioned its scientific legitimacy. At the heart of the debate, the notion of ‘‘milieu’’ became a central issue. Geopolitics had become a political ‘‘ustification’’ for Nazi leaders as they attempted to validate their acts with natural systems, according to the scientific theories of Karl Haushofer. The wider debate distinguished between political geography and geopolitics. Jean Dresch’s complex participation was infused with a latent tension, expressed at the end with his exasperation at being compared with Molière’s Mr. Jourdain. The opposition was tacitly ideological when Jean Dresch expressed his enthusiasm for the accomplishments of socialist countries, citing the example of communist China, 8. Dresch J., 1955, which had been founded six years earlier. To strengthen his position, he used infor- ‘‘Populations et mation gathered during his 1954 trip to China with the Association des Amitiés ressources de la Chine franco-chinoises; the USSR – and therefore the French Communist Party – were the nouvelle’’, Annales degéographie, no. 343,  new Chinese regime's allies in the edification of a socialist society.

The great Chinese inventory In his conversation with Wolfgang Hartke, Jean Dresch defined geopolitics as ‘‘an applied geography such as a science of space, a science of the occupation and planning of said space.’’ He judged the Chinese as having begun, with pertinence ‘‘and method’’, the accumulation of ‘‘sufficient knowledge to offer precise information on the physical and human environment’’ in order to plan and develop their territory. He highlights the extent to which the Chinese ‘‘had set out to scientifically discover their country [...] to begin organizing their country at the regional level.’’ Jean Dresch discussed the incredible inventory the Chinese Communists had undertaken as soon as they came to power in an immense country that had long been divided. Even though inventory attempts in various fields had been initiated previously by Chinese or foreign academics, especially in the 1930s, it was the demographic census of 1953 that constituted one of the true turning points. As stated by Jean Dresch, this census had three goals: to count the citizens of the People’s Republic of China (PRC), to localize geographically the population and identify their urban or rural situation; and finally to ‘‘ethnically’’ categorize the populations. Follo- wing the census, the central government would establish the PRC’s first constitution in September 1954. 8.

There were those nationalities with their own territory, culture, and history and who were similar but dis- tinct from the Hans. This group included the Mongols, the Uyghurs, and the Tibetans. Then there was the Hui nationality, based on a single religious criterion: Islam. Finally, there were the various nationalities scattered across the territories; mainly in south-west China. Starting in the 1950s, authorities established surveys, publications, research insti- tutes, and official validation for these minorities. Certain minority populations were forgotten and did not obtain political recognition, thus failing to obtain the status of "minzu". Others on the contrary were created by grouping diverse populations, some completely foreign to each other, and even certain who were Han. Finally, independent administrative units – scrupulously linked to a Party cell headed by the Han – were created to display the multiculturalism of the People’s Republic of China. At the provincial level, five independent regions were constituted between 1947 and 1965: Inner Mongolia (Mongol minority, 1947), Xinjiang (Uyghur minority, 1955), Ningxia (Hui minority, 1957), the Guangxi (Zhuang minority, 1958), and Tibet (Tibetan minority, 1965). A form of geopolitics that bears the name without addressing the issues/A geopolitics in name but not in action Though we agree with Jean Dresch that the strategies adopted at the time by the Chinese Communist Party belonged to a ‘‘geopolitical’’ approach, we can no longer define the term in the same fashion. Our contemporary geopolitical approach aims to be a purely scientific process and cannot be reduced to an assessment of spatial planning. Since Dresch, scholars have begun to analyze the games played by stakeholders, which has revealed territorial stakes, power struggles, and possible sources of conflicts. The now classic geopolitical analysis underlines the rivalry of powers over territo- ries at various levels. This very definition seems reductive. It is interesting in that its scope is global (physical and human). It assembles and slots together the various levels. It integrates both external and internal geopolitics. However, a wider approach is necessary to fully define geopolitics. The central question is rather that of power: real, perceived, or claimed over a terri- tory. This power can be wielded over a territory that is being disputed; but more often, it is over a territory that has been appropriated, is under control, supervised (legitimately or not) and not being disputed. Geopolitics is then an interrogation of the structures of power that produce territories, with actors at diverse levels and with differing natures, the State remaining one of the first elements of analysis, even in its eventual weaknesses. The possible geopolitics of China in the 1950s In China in the 1950s, the vision offered by Jean Dresch is influenced by his anti- colonialist convictions and his enthusiasm for the achievements of a new regime at the head of an immense country. The Chinese regime was already strong and intended to intensify its supervisory grid over its population both at work – the creation of work units (danwei) in urban envi- ronments, the collectivization of means for agricultural production, and soon the collec- tivization of land and the constitution of people’s communes (renmin gongshe) – and at 19 Thierry Sanjuan </page> <page sequence="20"> home – the State was becoming increasingly interventionist in its policy, which would ultimately result in the radical and dramatic collectivization of the Great Leap Forward. In terms of minority nationalities, Jean Dresch underlines the Chinese leaders’goal to ‘‘integrate them into an economically viable regional unit’’. For him, their dual goal of first balancing human and economic realities and also ‘‘having them live in harmony’’ was a real geopolitical undertaking, as an applied science. In their deeds, the new regime was looking to appropriate the margins of their national territory. As early as 1950, for both external reasons – in terms of their Soviet ally and neighbor – and internal ones in order to neutralize the separatist threats of the non-Han populations, China sent the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) to occupy Xin- jiang and develop the first State farms to settle and develop a pioneer front. In Tibet, the Chinese ended the Tibetan State’s independence, which had been established in 1912, and the future autonomous region would correspond to a greatly diminished Tibetan region. In Mongolia, the agriculture front was quickly established in order to increase Chinese useable agricultural land. The limits of a retrospective reading A dynamic reading of the actors and their territorial desires allows us, today, to gain better perspective on the development strategies of the New China of the 1950s. Only now can we more clearly analyze these political and territorial logics. At the time, few, if any, individuals – even in China – could imagine the depths to which the Chinese regime would plunge in subsequent years, dragging hundreds of millions of Chinese with it. By looking backwards, we run the risk of underestimating the territorial and ‘‘organizational’’ – though discordant! – achievements, along with the social moderni- zation of the first thirty years of the communist Chinese regime. Such reflexive geo- graphy, re-situating the ‘‘Maoist’’ era in its continuities and breaks with the Republican period, could establish a decisive form of geopolitics to study the internal stakes of a modern day, globalized China. – Thierry Sanjuan, université Paris 1 Panthéon- Sorbonne An attempt to exhaust a Parisian conference The postwar decades are often presented as a moment when ‘‘politics’’ ebbed, if not disappeared, from French geography. This is generally explained by the fact that the Haushoferian project had been discredited and by the distrust of an analytical approach that a purely economicistMarxism would have durably imposed. Such a widespread idea is based on bibliographic evidences (the quotable texts are not in profusion) and on the absence of key figures that would have led the defense of such a disciplinary sub-field – as compared with today’s abundance. The fact that a Franco-German conversation was held in 1955 concerning the issue of Geopolitics is one of the signs that the subject requires a fresh examination, in order to reconsider what was ‘‘thinkable’’ at the time, and to try as much as possible to distance ourselves from a ‘‘presentist’’ reading; in other words, a reading influenced by our contemporary formulations. I would like to offer a reading based on the ‘‘letter’’ (or the speech) it elicits, in hopes of restoring its singularity, its remoteness, and its historicity. Such a task is delicate because the document in question has certainly undergone many successive editions © L’Espace géographique 20 </page> <page sequence="21"> (transcriptions, cuts, re-readings, additions, revisions, yet we do not know to what extent) and inscrutable decisions have been made. It is especially difficult to establish the portion of improvisation in a transcribed conversation, as well as what has been re- written after the fact, and its dialogical depths in general. Subsequently, the supposed linearity of the discourses and their ‘‘on the spot’’ nature cannot be candidly assumed; despite the temptation to consider them verbatim. We will accept the deployment of the text published in 1955 as a horizon of intelligibility, contingent perhaps but sufficiently coherent to allow for a limited exegesis. The framework of arguments Let us start with a brief analysis of the framework of arguments, which will allow us to more easily suggest interpretations. Wolfgang Hartke begins the discussion with a clear desire to contextualize. Confronted with the overly simplistic equation of assi- milating ‘‘geopolitics’’ and ‘‘German ideology’’, he aims to demonstrate the foreign origins of the term (via Kjellén); its international attractiveness (in the United States notably); without forgetting its specific incarnation under Nazism), tempered however by the desire to show the driving role of its instrumentalization by ‘‘politicians (who) constantly need to justify their acts’’. After having established this first point, W. Hartke begins to retrace the genealogy of geopolitics, going back to the French theoreticians of natural determinism. This determinism was built into a tale by the German Romantics and developed into a principle of explanation at once immanent and enchanted (Nature and its God-given laws). It became the basis of a myth and an explanatory hubris whose effectiveness resides in the fact that it cannot be proven. This was the explanation for geopolitics’ growing contradictions with the heightened awareness of the limits of science. Then comes the third movement that underlines the ‘‘weakness’’ of this schema: calling on one of Nature’s ‘‘plans’’ is equivalent, accor- ding to Hartke, to abdicating all responsibility when confronted with reality and to producing adequate utopias (concepts with reversible content, like organicism, anthropomorphism, etc.) thanks to which leaders and their auxiliaries justified their most outrageous schemes. The very effectiveness of this image-making process resides in the fact that it simplifies a world whose scientific explanation had become more and more incomprehensible to the non-initiated. Such a drift can thus be compared to the fate of the Haushofers, both father and son, which Hartke describes as tragic. At the eve of their respective deaths, they realized they had given birth to an uncontrollable process. Jean Dresch speaks next, first in the name of a ‘‘French University’’ whose dis- trust and independence from ‘‘public powers’’ would have immunized it against ‘‘geo- politics’’’ compromissions, which were inseparable from its German origins. The ‘‘sense of relativity, the objectivism’’ that is inseparable from French science may have imprisoned it inside an ivory tower; resulting in a frustrating but sometimes advanta- geous situation. From here, J. Dresch offers a sort of narrative, a partial answer to W. Hartke’s suggestion, that designates the location of geopolitics in France: a sove- reign ideology that has become a bourgeois justification for colonial imperialism, defended by ‘‘publicists or politicians’’, but with no echo among ‘‘patented geogra- phers’’. In place of this ‘‘pseudo-science’’ stolen from geographers, a ‘‘serious’’ alter- native should be chosen, one based on inventories and cartography that would lead to ‘‘a real science concerning the relationship between man and his environment’’. He 21 Olivier Orain </page> <page sequence="22"> goes on to illustrate this point with the virtuous practices of a ‘‘Chinese example’’, which he enthusiastically and overarchingly presents. A doctrine at the court of science? This ‘‘Franco-German conversation’’ on geopolitics appears to conceptually base its structure on a dialogue and a debate between two ‘‘soloists’’, as well as between them and an educated public. Henri Brunschwig should be viewed as a third protago- nist considering the weight of his interventions and comments during the session, which he introduces and reformulates before the general discussion. His approach is to 10.  Aside from transform the event into an opportunity to deliberate once and for all on geopolitics accusations aimed at another German scholar, and its vocation as a science.

Furthermore, this subtly change the scale11 and the parameters of the analyses. As for J. Dresch, he does designates in the final discussion what J. Dresch away with the initial deliberation by exonerating French science and offering a personal describes as reinterpretation of the general issues ‘‘geopolitics’’ could assume. He begins with a Raumforschung, in a relative kinship with motive (the ‘‘justification’’ of an act or a political intention) that he abandons in the geopolitics, due to similar end for another (territorial inventory as preparation and ‘‘application’’). In doing so, his "dangers". The "padding" called for by the analysis strays far from what his German colleague had proposed 12 in that ‘‘politics’’ is "government" is a lure only a framework whose configuration is to be defined by science ex-ante.

This perspective is highly present in In many ways, this difference re-enacted what may have separated the (former) the works of F. Ratzel acceptation of ‘‘politics’’ in geography as a national framework for enquiry13 from a more and P. Vidal de la Blache performative use by Haushofer and his imitators. With this in mind, it is not surprising (notably in  ‘‘La Géographie politique, that J. Dresch defends a different expression, ‘‘political geography’’, a much older term à propos des écrits de used in the 1930s to distinguish from ‘‘geopolitics’’, even if he did also add that it was not M.

That same year, ‘‘Geopolitics’’ appeared much more pertinent, albeit painful. In a rather conver- Maurice Étienne Dumont would attempt, using gent fashion, the main speakers do not question the existence of geopolitics, an exis- genealogy as well, tence that cannot be reduced to its circumstantial incarnations. Its objectification is to redefine more the thread throughout their speeches, which try to establish its formula. In order to do precisely the disciplinary tags of the duo so, W. Hartke and J. Dresch call on genealogy – as a means to mobilize and reinterpret geopolitics-political the past. This leads them to consider ‘‘geopolitics’’ as an ancient point of view; one geography concerning which ‘‘confusion remains sees it at work amongst thinkers and the other amongst political actors.

Hartke is more © L’Espace géographique 22 </page> <page sequence="23"> deliberate when he situates the crystallization of the myth on which geopolitics is based among the apologists of Romanticism. Dresch is more literal when he cites Richelieu15 and the bourgeois imperialism of the 19th century as the premises by virtue of which France introduced geopolitics. The German geographer is the only one to sketch a more historical perspective (the terminological role of R. Kjellén partially clears German geography) even if his goal was not to write the history of the term. In many ways, in this conversation, geopolitics is the name given to the temptation for geographers to put themselves at the service of the State or its incarnations (the ‘‘poli- ticians’’ that mobilize W. Hartke's analysis more than J. Dresch’s). The former, deeply skeptical, considers it results in tragedy or an unhappy conscience; whereas the latter optimistically considers the Chinese example. The temptation to serve or advise must certainly have been burning during an era of Promethean and providential States; it is an incarnation of a project-based rationality that is also echoed loudly in contemporary texts, notably P. George. It is clear that the two speakers do not have the same levels of faith, certainly due to their different historical experiences, but also due to differing visions on the point of entry of a geographical discourse into the course of action (cf. supra). Implicit However, this temptation is based on what constitutes a ‘‘black box’’ or a gap in the reflection of the orators: we will never know anything definitive about ‘‘politics’’, 15. At the same period, either as a category or a specific field of intelligibility (if not by its attributes). There is Jean Gottmann believed Vauban to be a brilliant here a characteristic trait of how ‘‘classic’’ (or at least French) geographers think when precursor of a philosophy contextualizing the sensation of imprecision and indetermination that these analyses of spatial organization  (cf. “Vauban and modern elicit.
