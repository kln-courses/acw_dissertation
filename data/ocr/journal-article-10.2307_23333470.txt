It is a means to experiment and to initiate speculative ways to deal with the immediate and concrete facts which dwell in our worlds,... [and] their stubborn persistence. —Dimitris Papadopoulos, Niamh Stephenson, and Vassilis Tsianos, Escape Routes (2008, 66) This issue of WSQ seeks to experiment with the powers and seductions of enchantment in an attempt to intervene in the present moment. When survival is a question for so many, when things seem impossible and the world impassable—how to find and create places of allure? How to imag ine a world in which one could flourish? What might be the serious and playful role of enchantments in materializing that world? We experiment with enchantment as both a content of thought and as a way of think ing because the present so desperately requires the fabrication of escape routes that are not escapist. Our call for papers for this issue was partly inspired by Jane Bennetts book from over a decade ago, The Enchantment of Modern Life: Attach ments, Crossings, and Ethics (2001), and her more recent book Vibrant Matter: A Political Ecology of Things (2010). Seeking to invent new ways of conceptualizing the world, Bennett refuses the traditional dichotomy that reserves agency exclusively for humans, insisting that objects do not just block or hinder our actions. What if things really can hail us? she asks. Bennett takes the risk of a certain anthropomorphism in order to "culti vate moments of enchantment"—moments of wondrous yet disturbing WSQ: Women's Studies Quarterly 40:3 &amp; 4 (Fall/Winter 2012) All rights reserved. © 2012 by Ann Burlein and Jackie Orr. 13</page><page sequence="2">14 Ann Burlein &amp; Jackie Orr surprise. Drawing from Foucault s work on practices of the self (1985, 28), Bennett contends that ethics entail more than a code and principles, for sheer commitment (or will) is not enough to ensure we live ethically. Thus Bennett turns to enchantment as a way to "augment the motivational energy needed to move selves from the endorsement of ethical principles to the actual practice of ethical behaviors" (xi). Her assessment of the demands of the present is shared by Joshua Landy and Michael Saler, co editors of the collection The Re-Enchantment of the World: Secular Magic in a Rational Age (2009). Landy and Saler conclude their introduction with a confession of genuine urgency: . .it will not do to revert to prior forms of wonder, order and redemption. No, the world must be enchanted anew— human flourishing requires it" (14). At the same time, in developing this issue we drew from the incite ments of Comaroff and Comaroff in Millennial Capitalism and the Culture of Neoliberalism (2001). Written during the same years as Bennetts early work but from the transnational perspective of historical ethnographers, the introduction to the anthology documents the "rise of new forms of enchantment" (3) as millennial capital incorporates entrancing strategies and speculative seductions. Marked by "occult economies" devoted to the magical, paranormal production of value, and by popular cultures of evan gelical contagion and moral panic, the enchantments of contemporary capital augur "a world in which the only way to create real wealth seems to lie in forms of power/knowledge that transgress the conventional, the rational, the moral" (26). In this world, both Weber and Marx's diagno sis of enchantment as an exhausted force in the calculating economies of modernity looks dreadfully wrong in the face of zombie powers. Vampire culture. The long night of the living dead lingers on. Trans-Forms // Bending Lines of Flight (Sensual Matters) We can begin to map the tensions evoked, then, between enchantment as potential line of flight and as canny technique of power in the complex charms of the response to our call. WSQs inclusion of works by scholars, poets, artists, and creative writers offers a variegated textual, and textured, milieu for the scene of enchantment. As Roderick Ferguson writes in these pages, channeling the erotic-theoretic poetics of Audre Lorde, "the serious ness of intellectual work lies in the critical activation of sensual matters."</page><page sequence="3">Introduction 15 The force of enchantment, as several of our authors foreground, activates sensual matters in uncertain ways, via rhythm, play, poetic gesture, vibra tory frequencies that confuse or re-fuse familiar temporalities, and initiate transformed perception. Formal matters and the materiality of forms are never far away from enchantment s vortex of attraction, intensity, muta tion. 'Shape-shifting,' a popular word in the lexicon of Euro-North Ameri can magical practices, calls attention to this transFORMational matrix at the imaginary (and material) heart of human-animal-object relations. WSQ. shifts the shape of an academic feminist journal into a thoughtful, sensual collection of genres (essay, poem, story, visual art), reflecting the currents of enchanted intellectual work that have coursed through femi nism for decades. Betty Bayer s "Enchantment in an Age of Occupy," which opens the vol ume, pulls together a sonorous meditation on resonant, expressive forms of enchantment, a feminist attunement to Virginia Woolf's rhythmic and dislocating writings, and a sustained attention to the Occupy movement's reverberating politics of making space in which to dwell. Dwelling herself within an extended fieldwork of sympathetic vibrations, Bayer "hears" Occupy within a sound ecology where fields of revolt resonate across time and place, from the Arab Spring in 2011, through the labor, suffrage, and abolition revolts across Europe and North America in 1848, to the Mos cow winter of 2012. Reminding us that in the belly of enchantment lies the alchemy and etymology of the song—chanter, to sing—Bayer identifies the lyric ontology of the chant ("Mic Check!" "Mic Check!") as an incan tatory spelling of a world that insists on becoming a heard world. Noting that the so-called modern passage to disenchantment "carries within it many partings of the way, of the extra-ordinary from the ordinary, irra tional from rational, spiritual from material, and in each paired instance a haunting of one term by the other," the essay invents a haunted practice of enchantment composed of broken pieces of the ordinary the material, flecked and thrown into a conceptual mosaic designed as an experiment with form. The shape-shifting force of language itself, as a non/human vector of vibrant, vibrational change, animates AnaLouise Keating s analysis of Gloria Anzaldùa's work. "Speculative Realism, Visionary Pragmatism, and Poet-Shamanic Aesthetics" ties Anzaldùa's project and the indigenous the ories with which it engages to the physicality of performative language—</page><page sequence="4">16 Ann Burlein &amp; Jackie Orr a language that forms the very worlds it speaks. The potent alchemy of matter, language, and world becomes the material base for a poet-shaman aesthetics of healing and transformation. Like the lyric ontology of the chant, the ritualized performance of words en-chants an order of things shaped—substantively, ceremonially—at the meeting place of incanta tion and existence. Keating s nuanced discussion of Anzaldùa's decision to use the contested word shamanism to describe her own ritual/writing practices highlights the dangers of a racialized relay of meanings of indi geneity across centuries of colonizing violence, what Jodi Byrd (2011) names the "transit of empire." Anzaldùa risks the dangers of appropriation in her wager that a poet-shaman aesthetics might produce curative wis dom. Importantly, enchantment is not a word used by either Keating or Anzaldùa. Instead, it rests in uneasy, hopefully generative, alliance with the decolonizing, visionary knowledges both authors pursue in a pragmatic dream of collaborating with the numinous. Code switch. We're still dreaming but in a different style. The solar sys tem is being reformatted after a U.S. military-inspired apocalypse on Earth, and a hybrid cast of mestizajes, astrosociologists, and intragalactic avant garde artists compose the newly flexible gene stock of "transhumanity." Katherine Angel Cross takes an imaginary line of flight in "The New Labo ratory of Dreams: Role-playing Games as Resistance" toward the trans formations enacted in Eclipse Phase, an offline (pen and paper) game that presents human-animal bodies as the deeply contested terrain that they really are. Situating the sensual matters highlighted by Eclipse Phase within a storied history of feminist science fiction that redesigns gendered power relations, Cross offers an ethno(bio)graphy of the collective, lucid dreaming invited by role-playing. For Cross, the fantastic enchantments of game design, in which the rules of power are playfully recoded, evoke transgender theorist Susan Stryker's vision of trans-formation. If magical practice in contemporary North American pagan cultures is understood as the craft of bending energy into desired forms through collective ritual (Starhawk 1999), then the embodied enchantments of role-playing ana lyzed by Cross can be read today as a form of popular spellcraft. This section of Enchantment ends with an open door—artist Jeanine Oleson trans-forms the fabulated unicorn. In "Mythopoeia," the magical horn of the unicorn takes flight in a (sur)realist photo series of transforma tions that ends with an image that makes you... wonder.</page><page sequence="5">Introduction 17 Strange Time, Queer Temporalities If enchantment arises as the refrain amid sensuous resonance, it unfolds and extends no less through the felt force of time. Recent years have seen a flourishing of work on queer temporalities, which explore how "nonse quential forms of time... can fold subjects into structures ofbelonging and duration that may be invisible to the historicist eye" (Freeman 2010, xi). Refusing the propriety of time, queer temporalities open time to a ghostly touch in which queerness "seems immaterial," not quite there but discern ible nevertheless (Freccero 2006, 15-16). Intimately connected with queer temporalities, the time of enchantment enacts repetition's strange power through relays across time that aren't supposed to happen; serial re-turns to the charged, passing moment between the ordinary and the extra-ordinary; rematerializations of what-has-not-yet-been in a charmed conditional tense. Anastasia Kayiatos's "Silent Plasticity: Reenchanting Soviet Stagna tion" pursues a temporal genre that can narrate the enchantment of a his torical moment that appears to us in the present as no more than silence. What queer form of historiography might capture the strange time of Enchanted Island, performed in 1972 by the Soviet Theater of Mimicry and Gesture by deaf actors who refused a socialist state aesthetic of compulsory lip synching and instead, under the direction of gay writer Evgeny Khari tonov, staged an extended, silent pantomime play? Working through scat tered archival traces, and oral histories (translated from signed to spoken Russian) with some of the deaf actors still alive today, Kayiatos documents a time during Soviet late modernity when pervasive political stagnation was synched with a performance of an "unlikely dreamworld forged for a flickering instant by socialisms silent others: the queer and the deaf, the unspeakable and the unspeaking." At a punishing moment for gender and sex dissenters, when imagining an other world elsewhere became a strat egy of survival, Kharitonov and his actors employed the plastic forms of gesture and mime to materialize an enchanted theater where deaf perform ers in matching wigs and fishnet body stockings "queerly crossed" the gaze of Soviet audiences. In a related gesture of queer timing, Kaitlin Noss loops the allure of Utopia back toward a memory of what-might-yet-be in "Queering Utopia: Deep Lez and the Future of Hope." Captivated by the curious enchant</page><page sequence="6">18 Ann Burlein &amp; Jackie Orr ment that an earlier moment of radical lesbian feminism now holds for younger genderqueer, trans and lesbian generations, Noss works with artist-scholar Allyson Mitchells invention of Deep Lez to perform a "tem poral drag toward a different kind of time" (Freeman 2010,85). Part politi cal manifesto, part slumber party invitation, Deep Lez finds and remakes connections across time and among subaltern political projects. In affirm ing the ambivalent and risky desire to renew hopeful pasts and cultivate sustaining futures, Deep Lez activates present longings from lesbian, gen derqueer, trans, and subaltern people to reclaim the practical magic of a past era. The essay stages recent debates about desires for queer futurity, and in a recuperative turn, presents a never-yet-utopian lesbian subject that is visible in the archives of the Radicalesbians. Susana Morris explores strange time from a different direction than the past in "Black Girls are from the Future." For Morris, Octavia Butler s novel Fledgling tells a counter-narrative to the standard vampire script. While powerful, Butler's vampires remain vulnerable to racism and are therefore committed to creating a future that rejects racist ways of know ing. In affinity with the political imaginaries of Afrofuturist feminism and the possibilities that open up when blackness is linked to futurity, Butler subverts the conventional trope of prey and predator in which vampires see humans as natural resources or blood banks. Insistently framing their powers of enchantment as a social issue, Butler depicts agency as a vexed but shared series of negotiations between species. In Fledgling, Butler envi sions an epistemological shift concerning the ethics of identity, intimacy, and family by imagining vampires whose strength lies not in their brawn, speed, or seduction, but in hybrid symbiosis with humans. Naomi Edwards explores the troubled waters of queer temporalities in her reading of Monique Truong's 2003 bestseller, The Book of Salt, which offers a counter-narrative to the Paris of Gertrude Stein and Alice B. Tok las, instead telling the story of their Vietnamese chefs through the char acter Binh. Refusing narration in favor of asserting the uneven textures of multiple temporalities, Binh turns time into something felt by the body; he relives time as a desirous sting, but not as something he can narrate as a subject of history. Yet this lack of narration renders him vulnerable: banished from his home in Vietnam for his homosexuality, Binh is no less invisible in Paris and the Stein/Toklas residence. Edwards's reflections suggest that the strangeness of queer temporalities might be harder to think than we know.</page><page sequence="7">Introduction 19 If queer(ing) time is a rather recent pastime of critical scholarship, it is a practiced art of storytelling and modern visual cultures. In Strange Time, we welcome the flash fiction of Ann Podracky, who plumbs the enchanted dream- and memory-scapes of extra-ordinary experience: the charlotte russes lined and ready in the bakery trays, flashing a sensuous memory of childhood. Visual artist Zoe Beloff s A Drive-in Dreamland conjures the imaginary-archival remnants of queer times in World War II U.S. con sumer cultures, as she tours the latent architectures of a proposed roadside attraction: a multi-story structure in the shape of a nude woman's torso. In the souvenir shop, the ninety-nine cent version of Freud's "mystic writing pad," the Magic Slate, is always on sale, as Beloff sketches memory traces on the surface of an enchanted screen, beautifully ruined by the strange play of time's erasures. Power as Ambivalent Allure: Dis/enchantment and its Discontents Dis/enchantment is often an effect of narrative, of where one stands. The world appears disenchanted from the subject position of the Enlighten ment or of academic discourse, which has powers of critique we remain indebted to even as we desire to see beyond its provincial horizons, even as we desire to shift critique toward its outside. Might enchantment be a surface effect that moves and stirs us, yes, washes over and shifts us, but underneath which lurk riptides that catch us up and spin us around, so that we wind up facing precisely the direction we sought to leave behind? Enchantment is also a contested strategy, shot through with ambivalences, from the monstrous, seductive "magic of the state" (Taussig 1997) to the "occult economies" that are sparked by increasingly speculative, and spec tral, capital (Comaroff and Comaroff 2001). This ambivalent intermixture forms the subject of anthropologist Diane Nelson's "Banal, Familiar, and Enrapturing: Financial Enchantment after Guatemala's Genocide." In the Mayan highlands of Guatemala, farm ers hedge their risk by using Monsanto products alongside careful ritu als around seeds, abstinence from sex and from foods associated with the Spanish conquerors. Nelson explores the ponzi scheme masked as a devel opment project that was pulled off by El Millonario through his Mayan run NGO One Heart and Faith Association for Needs, which bankrupted tens of thousands of people. In answer to stereotypes about gullible Indi ans and hysterical women, Nelson contends that highland Maya who</page><page sequence="8">20 Ann Burlein &amp; Jackie Orr believed El Millonario were no more gullible than the North Americans who believed Bernard Madoff or the mystical prognostications of the Wall Street Journal. Yet ultimately for Nelson, this classic critical move— which reverses stereotypes by deeming Europe's so-called Enlightenment to be the real enchantment—misses the point. For this move obscures the capacity of numbers to act as familiars, "suggesting a witchy sense of companion species, non-human actants in intimate connection, like Dur kheim's 'something impersonal in us .., because there is something social in us'... " Relational projects take shape in a dreaming. In numbers, there lives a collective life. Nelson points to this collective life as the source of enchantment s ambivalent allure, for it is both magically productive and all we have: banal, familiar, but perhaps also enrapturing. It is difficult to speak of enchantment in terms of the ordinary and mundane—to pass beyond the superficial effects of the uncanny to ana lyze the substratum of banal enchantments that are social and impersonal. In "Mana and Mystification," Randall Styers sketches a moment in the genealogy of religion that helps explain why. Styers focuses on the work of R.R. Marrett, the last armchair anthropologist, whose analysis of mana challenged one of the most misleading under-currents in dis/enchant ment narratives: namely, their tendency to reinscribe religion as interior and private by positioning religion against reason/science and magic/ superstition. Rejecting the animist theories of Tylor and Frazer which attributed religion to conjectures of individual primitive philosophers, Marrett contended that religion primarily concerns affect and behavior. He traced mana to the field of communal feelings and experiences that arise out of emotional and motor processes, conceding that perceptions of mana were socially conditioned. Yet even Marrett could not resist the cultural logic of modernity, at least insofar as Marrett too could not escape conceptualizing mana as personal agency or will-power. By ignoring the concrete socioeconomic mechanisms through which personal agency is produced, secured and maintained, Marrett s thoughts on mana shored up the status quo. It is not just scholars who become transfixed before the altar of will. Cindy McMann's article, "Helen Adam's Occult Reworkings" explores the poets and artists of the 1950s and early 1960s in San Francisco, who sought a sorcery in poetry through which to counter the academic con strictions of the New Criticism. They drew on occult cosmologies of the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, whose theorists saw natu</page><page sequence="9">Introduction 21 ral magic as a form of science insofar as it worked with physical laws or sympathies, and assumed a hierarchical universe in which the magician applied his active force. McMann focuses on the poet Helen Adam, whose works intervened in this masculinist discourse of coercive will by re-locating magic to the realm of the imagination and to the natural envi ronment, thereby formulating an alternative vision of power. This exploration of how to extricate enchantment from 'will' contin ues in Karen Gregory's ethnography of tarot card readers in contemporary New York. In "Negotiating Precarity: Tarot as Spiritual Entrepreneurial ism," Gregory portrays the process by which readers come to trust the cards as an attempt to use the tarot deck as a "vibrant object," with agency and energy to fuel the invention of new affective assemblages that turn a card reader s very being into a potential economic resource amid a situa tion of precarity. It is these assemblages that are experienced as spiritual, Gregory contends, insofar as they help tarot card readers feel that new connections and networks are possible, thereby enabling them to take the leap into new forms of work—as if the world can be enchanted if they just try hard enough. We leave the last words about the ambivalence of dis/enchantment to creatures forced to live forever in its embrace. The fairy Tinkerbell on uppers and a drunken Wendy, plucked from the imaginary empire of Peter Pans Neverland, inhabit the dark charms of the art installation/per formance piece, The Wendy House. Performance scholar-artists Heather Warren-Crow and Kelly Rafferty ask how the language of empire can remain "sensuously" enchanting even after its magic is revealed as no more than glitter and glue. While Tinkerbell can be heard muttering: "Tell him I've quit smoking. I don't want to be myself anymore. No. I'm tired of mice and children and the Great White Father. I never loved them anyway. I'm not dressed for it." In-conclusions "[W]e must constantly encourage ourselves and each other to attempt the heretical action our dreams imply and some of our old ideas disparage," writes Audre Lorde (1985, 133) in "Poetry is Not a Luxury," one of two essays by Lorde we selected to include in the Classics Revisited section. Audre Lorde's incitement might ring with nostalgia today as a longing for a time when dreaming had more collective force than in our seemingly</page><page sequence="10">22 Ann Burlein &amp; Jackie Orr foreclosed future-present. We might live, as Lauren Berlant (2011) has recently argued, in an extended moment of neoliberal transition not only between modes of production, but between modes of sustaining fantasy. And our hope to animate a politics of enchantment may well be a kind of "cruel optimism," or a form of desirous, phantasmatic attachment that undermines the very aim of our desire (ibid). If so, then we leave it to the Classics Revisited authors to persuade you of the ongoing power, the reverberating sensual matters that Lorde s work still embodies, especially as this issue comes out twenty years after her death in November 1992. The twelve poets whose work is published in the volume also attest to the necessary, profoundly poetic struggle to create sustaining fantasies and visionary languages today. We want to end by presenting enchantment as an invitation to think hard and differently about the force of all that which escapes our critical apparatus, including our own everyday escape routes that nourish our dreambodies, while perhaps never satisfying our deepest hungers for change or justice. At the same time, we cheerfully align our experiment with the queer arts of failure (Halberstam 2011), agreeing that we have failed to effectively uncover the magical, material forces of enchantment in all their culturally specific, historically weighted, politically ambivalent complexity. But we hope at least to persuade some of you that enchant ment is a practice that together with its complicated kin—imagination, fantasy, seduction, desire—calls for a response. The response that we have tried and certainly failed to make has been to learn how, as Diane Nelson encourages us, "to think enchantment without losing it."
