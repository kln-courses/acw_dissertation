(a) The People. As introduction to this paper, a brief summary may be given of the social organization of the Orokaiva. These people occupy the greater part of the Northern Division of Papua. Geographically, their country is bounded on the north by the River Waria, or, roughly speaking, the old German boundary; on the west by the Central Range; and on the south by the Hydrographers, though there are some sections of the people scattered along the seaboard further southward. The people are predominantly Papuan, with not improbably a strain of Melanesian blood. They were cannibals, and noted for their fighting quality; their weapons are the spear, club, and shield. They live in the main by their gardens, of which the staple product is taro, and, secondarily, by hunting, fishing, and sago. The Orokaiva territory is for the most part plain country; there are tracts of lalang grass and broad expanses of sago swamp, but by far the greater area is under thick forest. The inhabitants of this country speak various dialects of the same language, and have no practical difficulty in understanding one another. This language has</page><page sequence="2">406 F. E. WILLIAMS.-Plant-Emblems among the Orokaiva. been called Binandele, because the dialect of that particular tribe has been the most studied. There is a general similarity in physical type throughout the popula- tion, and a general similarity in manners, customs, and material culture. Making due allowance for certain tribal differences, we may still refer to the Orokaiva as a fairly homogeneous group. (b) Division into Tribes. The group is divided, on no very strict basis, into a number of tribes. These have been mapped out by E. W. P. Chinnery and the late W. N. Beaver in " Papua, Annual Report, 1914-15 " (p. 158). The tribe usually, but not invariably, occupies one continuous area of land, i.e. it is in the main a local unity. It is distinguished by some linguistic differences, not always very great, but immediately obvious to the native, who by way of linguistic classification gives nicknames Aia Mama, Aiaka Mamaka, Aha Maha, etc.-to the tribes according to their several phrases for " Mother and Father." Mutual enmities and alliances, more or less permanent, have served to mark the political identity of the tribes, and there are some cultural differences between them. My own investigations have been principally among the following tribes: Aiga (of the middle Opi); Binandele (Mambare, Gira, and lower Kumusi rivers); Tain Daware (coast between Mambare and Kumusi); and Wasida, or Jegasi Sarahu (on the plain immediately north-west of Mount Lamington). But enquiries in the other tribes as well as these show that the social organization is practically the same; and in respect of the Plant-emblems and the Clans (which together form the subject of this paper) the evidence has revealed a marked consistency throughout the whole people. (c) Division into Clans. Each tribe is split into a multiplicity of small clans; and from time to time the clans will further multiply themselves by subdivision. Whereas there are about ten tolerably well-defined tribes of the Orokaiva, the clans number hundreds. They are so small as usually to occupy only one village; and sometimes they can boast no more than two or three representatives. Whereas the ultimate bases of the tribal division are political and economic, that of the clan system is lineal. The Orokaiva were formerly a people of fierce temper and restless habits, given to raiding, cannibalism, and interminable feuds. In the peculiarly merciless warfare of earlier times-the disruptive effects of which are sometimes, perhaps, under- estimated there are authentic tales of extermination, and, more often, of flight, dispersal, and migration. It comes about, therefore, that some clans have been widely scattered; there has been interpenetration, and now representatives or branches of the same clan miay be found in different tribes, where they have taken on the slightly new colour of their surroundings. It will be obvious that the division into tribes and the division into clans cannot always be mutually conformable.</page><page sequence="3">F. E. WILLIAMS.-Plant-Emblems among the Orokaiva. 407 (d) The Clan and the Village. The village is usually small-in these days of peace and security smaller perhaps than formerly. In the larger villages there are often two clans or more, which occupy separate ends or parts of the settlement. On the other hand, a vigorous clan may occupy several adjacent villages; and, as was said above, it may be scattered far and wide. However, the normal disposition is, one clan one village. Indeed, it appears that the clan in the first instance coincides with the village. For there is a tendency for individuals to strike out on their own account and found little homestead villages on the site of their gardens. At first they retain their old clan names; but, as the family thrives and develops into a small patriarchal group, it may take to itself a distinctive name and so become a young clan. The manner in which this clan name is acquired is a matter of principal importance in this paper. (e) The Constitution of the Clan. The Orokaiva clan is patriarchal and of very simple constitution. The child belongs to his father's clan, and his plant-emblem is that of his father. There are rare exceptions, cases in which a clan has been named after a woman, and in which the mother's plant-emblem has been adopted as that of the incipient clan; but these may be taken as proofs of the rule. The father is undisputed head of the family. The maternal uncle has certain ceremonial duties to perform, e.g. that of piercing the child's nose, but he cannot be said to exercise any authority in the normal instance. Between the nephew and his maternal uncle there are cordial relations, but no subordination and control. It may be remarked in passing, however, that the relation between the father's people and the mother's people is, in practice, so friendly and intimate that the child associates himself almost as readily with the latter as with the former; and it is common for the plant-emblem of the mother (and of the maternal uncle) to be taken by the children as a secondary badge. Indeed, although it is not regarded as correct, an inexperienced child, if asked for his plant-emblem, will often enough give his mother's and forget his father's. In effect the Orokaiva organization very nearly approaches a bilateral system, though in theory it is patrilineal. There is no rank of chieftainship, but a recognized ascendancy of the old men. The leader and ruler of any clan is simply the eldest of its men, provided he be not so old as to be incompetent, and provided always that his personality is equal to his position. (Where the clan is scattered there is no single leadership.) Over and above these clan patriarchs there are recognized leaders of small clan confederacies and even-in war-time-of tribes; but these need not be discussed, as our concern at present is the clan. Roughly speaking, the clan is exogamous. But it is not strictly so. Sometimes informants will claim that it should be exogamous, but investigation reveals many instances in which it is not. On the other hand, it is sometimes maintained that it VOL. LV.' 2E</page><page sequence="4">408 F. E. WILLIAMS.-Plant-Emblems among the Orokaiva. is a proper thing to keep the women in the village, in the hope of building up its population.' On the whole, one may say that there is no strict rule, but only a general practice of clan exogamy. Marriage is normally patrilocal, though the contrary cases are quite numerous. Where marriage happens to be matrilocal the rule of patrilineal descent is not broken, though no doubt the influence of the maternal side is stronger. It is not unusual for a man to divide his time between the villages of his wife's people and his own, living as comfortably in one as in the other. The last point with regard to the clan is the fact of its common ancestry. The members of the clan itself always claim or assume a common ancestor, and there is no doubt that their assumption is in the main correct. Sometimes they cannot give a name, sometimes they can. Sometimes the namne is only a generation or two old, and this, indeed, is what must be expected. If new clans are constantly springing into existence in the way I have described (a process partly neutralized by the dying- out of old clans), then it follows that the originator will frequently be a very definite personality who may have lived within the memory of one's informants, or in the extreme case be an informant himself. II.-THE PLANT-EMBLEM OR HERATU. Every clan has a distinctive emblem or associate, in the great majority of cases a species of the vegetable kingdom. Among the Aiga tribe (of whom my information is the fullest) this is called the heratu, and throughout the remainder of this paper the word heratu will be used as the equivalent of plant-emblem. Kenatu is the form in the Binandele and Tain Daware languages; in Wasida a different word, hae, is used; and throughout the whole Orokaiva people alternative names are evobo and ahije, or some nearly equivalent forms. It may safely be said that the heratu is universal among the clans, and almost invariably it is some plant or tree. The Orokaiva are mostly forest people. In the tropical bush there is infinite variety, and (what makes the bush so difficult for the timber-getter and so easy for the native) this variety is forever repeating itself. Give a native a moment and he will look about him and pluck you his heratu. The botanical names are of no consequence-fortunately so, as I cannot give them. There are large forest trees, such as Boruga and Siruga, the " canoe tree " ; creepers and bushes; grasses and weeds. Sometimes they have an economic value; com- monly they have none whatever. It is certain that they are not selected as heratu because of any use they may have. The accompanying photograph will give an idea of the plant-emblem; it is usually no more than a twig or an unpretentious handful of grass. (See P1. XXXII, Fig. 1.) I This, I believe, is usually when there is a surplus of women in the village, and this is a somewhat unusual state of affairs.</page><page sequence="5">F. E. WILLIAMS.-Plant-Emblems among the Orokaiva. 409 Since the heratu is in so great a majority of cases a vegetable species, the phrase " plant-emblem " seems to be justified. There are, however, some interesting variants, including a number of bird-associates and certain simple emblematic devices. Though I describe these somewhat in detail, it must not be forgotten that they are, relatively speaking, a very small category, and that the heratu is normally a plant or tree. In the Wasida tribe I came across three bird-associates, Kombu, a certain black bird whose name " Kombu " is meant to reproduce its cry; Hiviki, the hawk; and Hororo, a small ground forager. These were all subsidiary emblems, and the clans to which they belonged had heratu of the ordinary botanic kind. Further, they were not, as far as I know, used for the regular purpose of the heratu, viz., a badge or token of identity. However, among the Binandele there was the Diriu, or common blue pigeon, of the Diriu clan; and among the Tain Daware the Bangai, or eagle hawk, of the Bangai-unji; and it was claimed that the feathers of both these birds were used as identity marks. The blue pigeon (with a slight dialectical change of name) is again heratu of the Dirou about the Hydrographer foot-hills, but I have no very trustworthy note on this instance. Among several score of heratu I have lighted upon only these six instances of birds, so that they may be considered very rare. A few examples may be given of the semi-mechanical devices which sometimes serve as heratu. Among the Aiga the Honia-Noduru clan use a split stick-not a particular stick, but simply any small branch torn from a tree by the track and split half-way down its length. The Samberota clan has for its heratu a sambt, i.e. a green stick flattened or squashed at the end, as a wooden peg is splayed out by hammering. The Simborota, besides their plant-emblem Simboro, have a habit of stamping their heel (atu) into the soft ground to leave the print of it as their mark, Among the Binandele we find topo, any broad leaf rolled into a spiral with the same quick turn of the hands which we see behind the grocer's counter; and pono, a foot or so of creeper fashioned into two tangent circles in imitation of the ornament pono, which consists of two circular pig tusks. The Umbengi clan of the Tain Daware have for their heratu, umu-bengi, literally "water-clod," i.e. the clod of earth con- tinually dislodged by the stream from the river bank. Further instances of this nature could be given. It will be seen that all these, like the usual plant heratu, have this much in common, that they may be extemporized in a moment. A native cannot lay hold of a bird or an animal whenever he wants it; consequently birds are rarely adopted as heratu, and animals or fish, so far as my investigations go, never. It is common, almost regular, for the clan to have one or more alternative heratu. For this there are several explanations which may be regarded as concurrent. In the first place, it is well to have an alternative or emergency heratu. If the tree Tuvira is not handy, then ehe jakara, a grass stalk will do, and, failing that again, 2E 2</page><page sequence="6">410 F. E. WILLIAMS.-Plant-Emblems among the Orokaiva. komusu, a leaf of any kind made into a scroll, and by one or the other of these you may know that a Serugahije man has passed. Secondly, there is a sort of hierarchy of heratu. As was said before, the clan is continually subdividing. The sub-clan or incipient clan, even the individual, may adopt an independent heratu, but, still belonging to the parent body, continue for a time at least to use the parent heratu. Thus two branches of the clan Simborota, retaining their original heratu, the river-grass Simboro, have each their distinctive mark, one the tree Ominga, and one, atu, the imprint of a heel. Thirdly, a man uses both the paternal and the maternal heratu. As I have previously mentioned, the heratu proper is the former, and the contrary instances which do occur are exceptional. The heratu of the father is passed on by inheritance, whereas that of the mother is not normally handed down beyond the generation of her offspring. However, so close is the intimacy between the two branches of the united family, that the son or daughter may be as familiar with the mother's heratu as with the father's. Within the clan, indeed, it is the distinctive mark of the house- hold, and a man may often employ his father's and his mother's emblems simul- taneously so as to make his identity the clearer. Further, as it is customary for a man to spend some of his time in his wife's village, it follows that the son must spend some of his time in his mother's village, and while there he may use his mother's heratu in preference to his father's, which would be less familiar among the surrounding villages and clans. III.-USES OF THE HERATU. (a) As an Identity-Token. So far I have not mentioned the uses of the plant-emblem. If one asks a native what he actually does with his heratu, he will assuredly answer: " I place it on the track so that others who follow may know I have passed that way." This, indeed, though not the only use for the heratu, is the commonest. At a junction of two paths, I have come upon eight different kinds of leaves or grass, placed there during the morning and as yet scarcely wilted. My boys, who were inhabitants of the district, were able to identify each clan by its heratu; the owners of them had passed this spot at intervals, all bound for one village as guests to a feast and dance. The stem of the leaf, the root of the grass, or the butt of the branch, should point in the direction which its owner has taken, but apparently this rule is not observed with strictness. There is another use similar in principle. When a hungry man sees a ripe bunch of bananas in the garden of his friend he will not hesitate to help himself. It is to be feared that he would not hesitate over long if he met the same temptation in the garden of a stranger. In the first instance, however, he will eat his fill of the bananas, or whatever it may be, and leave his heratu. When the owner comes to his garden and sees this he will be satisfied, for no native begrudges food to his friend.</page><page sequence="7">F. E. WILLIAMS.-Plant-Emblems among the Orokaiva. 411 I have had occasion myself to use this simple expedient. Finding a village where we meant to lunch for the time being deserted, we steal a bunch of bananas, cook them, and go on our way with invigorated and cheerful carriers. To account for this act of pillage we need only leave a stick or two of tobacco by the remains of the banana bunch, tied to a sprig of croton, which happens to be the heratu of a rather distinguished old native who is with me. We may then feel that we have not only made payment but given the fullest possible account of our behaviour. In these two uses the heratu is an identity-token, having a sort of evidential value in proving presence or agency, like a national flag left planted on the North Pole, or a visiting card slipped under the front door. It may be remarked that the heratu is never worn or carried by a man simply as a badge. It is an identity mark in absentia. (b) As a Mark of Individual Abstinence. The next use for the heratu is a somewhat singular one. It is used by individuals as a sign of abstinence, a sort of self-inflicted tabu; and this, it would appear, is invariably the outcome of some quarrel or grievance. The Orokaiva is very prone when his feelings are hurt to punish himself rather than the man who has hurt them; or, perhaps better, to take revenge upon the other party by punishing himself. Thus, if a man fall out with his wife, he will thrust a sprig of his heratu through his armlet, and while he continues to wear it will receive no food of her cooking. Not that he altogether starves himself into relenting; some friend will cook for him until his mood softens, and then there are interchanges of gifts between the wife's people and his own, and, as I am told, invariable reconciliation. Similarly, a wife who has been accused by her husband of sponging on him, not working for her keep, will advertise her grief and indignation by wearing her heratu, and will, for the time being, refuse to eat another taro out of his garden. A bunch of drooping leaves may be seen tied to a coco-nut palm in the village. The owner has fallen out with a neighbour over the boundary of his garden. The row of tree trunks which constitutes the mutual garden border has been displaced and shows an encroaching and unwarrantable bulge. Therefore he has set up his heratu to indicate that he has been imposed upon, and has broken off friendly relations with his neighbour; he will accept no hospitality from him (and give none) until the matter has been adjusted. Another man nurses some resentment against a near-by village. If he were bidden to a feast there he would go, but with his heratu in his armlet, and when the wooden dish of savoury taro was placed before him he would wave it aside, or lay his heratu upon the food to show that he could not accept the hospitality of those who had wronged him. Then the offender would be put to shame and punished, and be sorry for what he had done.</page><page sequence="8">412 F. E. WILLIAMS.-Plant-Embl ems among the Orokaiva. (c) As the Naterari or Village Tabu-Post. The heratu appears again in its most interesting character as the village tabu- post. In many parts of the territory it is the custom long before a feast to set up some tangible sign of tabu upon the coco-nuts. Among the Orokaiva this sign commonly takes the form of a wooden post or pillar, roughly carved and painted; and this post should, properly speaking, be of that particular wood which the clan owns for its heratu. This, however, cannot be a universal rule, because the heratu is often a grass or some small plant; but it may be said that, when the heratu is a tree, the tabu-post is a stump of that tree. (In the other cases it may be a post of some alternative wood, or-a frequent substitute-one or two wands of the very light timber called Pamba tied horizontally to a palm.) Among the Aiga such a post is called naterari, and this word will be used as an alternative for tabu-post. Na means " village " and terari "to close up," as a creek is dammed up with stones, or as the hollow drum is closed at one end with the lizard-skin. The Binandele word is ao, apparently a contraction of ago (another dialectical form); I cannot make any suggestion as to its real meaning. In Wasida the same object is called itembari, probably a compound of i, " tree," and tembari, " to place on top." In Dobaduru the word was natembahije: na (village), temba (to place on top), ahije (ancestor). I propose to deal somewhat lengthily with the functions of the naterari, because they may throw a light on the real nature of the heratu. Some time after a man's death it is customary to give a large feast to which all the mourners are invited. Such a feast is usually accompanied by a dance, and perhaps by some other ceremony (such as the debut of initiates), which may have no immediate connection with the deceased. This, indeed, is merely to kill two birds with one stone, or to satisfy more than one social obligation with the same batch of pigs. However, the feast at any rate is to be regarded as placatory to the departed spirit. Some months after the man's death the naterari is set up in the centre of the village, and from this moment the coco-nuts are not eaten green, but allowed to ripen and fall, until at last there is a tremendous accumulation, perhaps laid out in lines on the ground, or else piled on a mountainous tripod. Meanwhile the naterari has been standing in the village clearing, as if silently watching the slow preparations, somewhat weatherbeaten by now, and with its originally garish make-up a little faded. It is, however, treated with a certain amount of care and respect. It is not uncommon to see a miniature four-legged shelter to protect it from the rain, with a gabled roof of sago-thatch, and perhaps underneath the roof a little platform. (P1. XXXII, Fig. 2.) On this platform may be found an old bamboo cylinder pipe, a lime gourd, perhaps a handful of withered betel-nuts; and beside these a few fragments--fresh or mouldy-of cooked taro. These are so placed for the spirit of the departed, or, to use the Aiga word, the sovat. It will come by night and refresh itself to that extent which is proper for a spirit, or as a native will say, with a twinkle in his eye, taking no more than an ant might</page><page sequence="9">F. E. WILLIAMS.-Plant-Emblems among the Orokaiva. 413 eat. In addition to these offerings there may be found certain mementoes of the deceased-an old banana-seed necklace, a shell bracelet, in one case a broken gourd that had been a urinary for an invalid and bed-ridden old man. When the preparations for the entertainment are complete the naterari is removed, and, with its removal, the coco-nut tabu comes to an end. Normally, it would appear, the naterari stands through the time of feasting and is removed afterwards. Sometimes, I am told, the provisions for the feast are displayed before the post-row upon row of wooden dishes piled with cooked food-and it is called upon to witness the feast in its honour. There is still something of reverence in the final disposal of the naterari. When I suggested chopping it up for firewood I was made to feel that this was rather a bad joke. In the inland village it is put aside in the outskirts of the bush, sometimes with a small platform close by for a continuation of the food offerings, and there allowed to decay. On the River Opi it is placed, with other paraphernalia of the dance, upon a raft; with some little ceremony this raft is guided into midstream and released to follow its unattended course toward the sea. Sometimes the naterari is stowed away in a house. At any rate, it is not simply thrown away and dis- regarded. For this two reasons are given: first, that the sovai, or spirit, would be angry; second, that the people feel too sorrowful to treat the naterari thus. It is worth referring to the forms or patterns of the tabu-post. The variety is very great, for each example seems to take shape from the individual carver's imagina- tion. There is no such thing as a distinctive clan device; and there are no names for particular patterns. In one village a newly erected naterari of an unusually pretentious character had been recently substituted for another of inferior work- manship. The latter, though discarded, had not been destroyed. Both belonged to the same clan and village, and were set up for the same occasion, but they were wholly different in pattern and appearance. The treatments range from the very simplest of formal designs to somewhat elaborate representations of the human figure. The latter probably throw some light upon the former. For instance, the prevalent device of cutting through the post so as to leave two separate supports may be reminiscent of the obviously human- like legs of more elaborate figures. There are many naterari which apparently do not conform to the implied explanation, but nevertheless it may be said that many do show a slight, and others an unmistakable, anthropomorphic character. The accompanying sketches were made at various times and entirely at random. (Fig. 1.) Enough has been said to show that the naterari is very closely associated with the dead man for whom the feast is to be made. I do not remember hearing in so many words that the naterari actually represented such and such a dead man; but the fact that the feast is definitely made for the dead man, the care with which the naterari is treated, the offerings made to it, the mementoes of the deceased which are attached to it, and the ceremonious way in which it is finally disposed of, would</page><page sequence="10">414 F. E. WILLIAMS.-Plant-Emblems among the Orokaiva. all lend colour to the suggestion that it is regarded as a representative of the dead, and is, inimagination, identified with him. One could not go so far as to say that it was actually an image of him; but in view of its occasionally striking anthropo- morphism, it is not impossible that originally the naterari was in reality set up as a crude model of the dead. I may give one illustration to show that this notion, or a similar one, has not been entirely forgotten. In No. iv, Fig. 1, primitively painted on one facet of the post may be seen the figure of a man. The naterari was cut out, set up and painted by one Bararipa, pending a feast in honour of his deceased father Komona; and the figure, by Bararipa's word, was a picture of Komona himself. Another bond between the naterari and the dead, viz., that of a common name, will become evident when we have proceeded further. IV.-THE HERATU AS ANCESTOR. Having described the uses of the heratu, I may now endeavour to explain them. The fact of first importance is that the heratu of the clan is constantly referred to as " our ancestor." The words used are evobo and ahije: the former (which in this connection is the usual one) seems always to have the extra connotation of " ancient." The latter may mean either literally " grandfather," or else an ancestor more remote. It is always difficult to determine the proper limits of native categories. Heratu, which I have used as synonymous with plant-emblem, would seem with some informants to have a rather more limited application, i.e. it refers to the plant-emblem especially qua mark of identity; whereas evobo is rather a more comprehensive term, covering not only the special plant-emblem ancestor, but the whole march-past of forefathers. However, the plant-emblem is called an ancestor. When a man is dead and lies awaiting burial, the women may be heard crying to him as the offspring of his heratu-" Asava-jai, Hombiga-jai ! " i.e. " Child of Asava, child of Hombiga ! " the word jai being used in every-day speech as we might use the word " piccaninny." Now, I have many times asked the native what he means by calling the plant- emblem his ancestor. Sometimes he cannot give an answer, but very commonly he can, and then it is always the same: " Our real ancestor," he says, " was a human being, not a tree; it was a man with a tree-name." For once, I believe, our native has given the really true explanation. I will proceed with the evidence for this hypothesis, viz., that the normal heratu is a species of plant representing a human ancestor of the same name. There are certain reasonably authentic incidents in which a human namesake, or, rather, original, of the heratu is well remembered. Thus there is a Binandele clan named Yegaboda whose heratu is Watora, the reed. During their latter migra- tio.ns these people hid from their enemies among the reeds, and here a baby was born to whom was given, in a very characteristc fashion, the name Watora. In</page><page sequence="11">F. E. WILLIAMS.-Plant-Emblems among the Orokaiva. 415 A~~~~~ 17 p,i FIG. 1I.-EXAMrLES OF NATERARI, OR TABU-POSTS (HEIGHT 3 oR 4 FEET).</page><page sequence="12">416 F. E. WILLIAMS.-Plant-Emblems among the Orokaiva. due time this child became the chief man of his clan, which adopted Watora, or the reed, as its heratu. So we find two widely separated branches of the clan Samanahu, one among the Aiga, the other, an emigrant section, among the Binandele. The Aiga section, still retaining their name of Samanahu, have now the alternative heratu Asava and Hombiga, evidently acquired subsequently; while the Binandele branch has kept its original heratu, the tree Samana. Both sections, however, told the same tale of Samana. He was their common ancestor, not a tree, of course, as they affirmed, but a man, and one who, as it chanced, acquired his name from the fact that he was brought to birth under a Samana tree. It happens that in each of these two cases the ancestor has acquired his tree- name in much the same way; and in fact this habit of naming a child from some odd circumstance attending its birth is very common: instance the names Abiga, " Ashes," and Ijita, " The Sun," given for precisely similar reasons. But whatever the origin of the tree-names for human beings, I shall presently have to stress the fact of their extraordinary frequency among the Orokaiva. To give further instances, a man of the Aiga clan Johari, whose heratu is Saga, declares that Saga was a man of flesh and bone, and gives, with confidence, a genealogy in which he proves him to be his great-grandfather. Another, an old man with heratu, Okomba, says that he remembers seeing in his boyhood the real Okomba. In a certain village on the Kumusi the heratu is Juara, a creeper. This will not make a suitable tabu-post, so the chief, one Euga, cut out a post from the Euga tree; and on another occasion used the tree Hamanya, because a paternal ancestor had borne the name. Of individual heratu I shall have more to say presently. But an instance may be given here to show how the heratu represents the human being with the tree-name. The Pure clan on the Mambare has for its heratu the plant Pura; but two individuals prove to possess heratu of their own, one the tree Goru, from his paternal grandfather of the same name, and the other a pair of alternatives, Simbiri (the croton), his mother's name, and Eua (a kind of bread-fruit ?), his father's name. Instances could be multiplied. From constant questioning I have come to form the opinion that in the very great majority of cases the heratu has been adopted in this manner, viz., as a tangible emblem of the synonymous ancestor. I have four cases in which a contrary explanation was offered. A fugitive section of the Serugahije clan, making its way northward toward the River Mambare, settled for some time in a place of abundant sago, and thereafter abandoned the original heratu, Tuvira, and adopted Ambe, or sago. A clan of the Tain Daware named Giriri had for its original ancestor, one Bono. But they were constantly using a certain hard-wood called Giriri for building, and consequently took this for their heratu and their clan name. The Gonini clan of the Tain Daware have for their heratu, Gonini, and occupy four villages. In one of these, Sivariri, there is growing a large tree of the same name, and its inhabitants have taken this species</page><page sequence="13">F. E. WILLIAMS.-Plant-Emblems among the Orokaiva. 417 (iSivariri) for their heratu. The fourth instance is that of the Binandele clan Diriu. These people, who long ago lived on the Kumusi, were fishing in a small creek when the body of a blue pigeon (Diriu) came floating down. They accordingly named the creek Diriu, and, it would appear, adopted the name for themselves and their heratu. Though the clan was long ago driven out by the Aiga, this same creek and the adjacent village are still known as Dirou, a circumstance which gives a colour of truth to the legend. These four cases, however, are not typical. The usual explanation is the one I have given above. In many cases, of course, no explanation whatever was forthcoming. On the whole it may well be surprising that the native should have so often been able to suggest a plausible origin for one of his customs. After some acquaintance with the Orokaiva, one may safely say that, although of a highly imaginative nature, he is not such a fool as really to believe himself descended from a tree. V. THE ORIGIN OF CLAN NAMES. It must be remembered that these natives have a habit of identifying themselves by their father's,' or their grandfather's, or their clan's names as much as by their own. When the fortunate hunter drives his spear into the pig, he shouts, not his own name, buLt such a phrase as Kaiepa-tahije-" Grandson of Kaiepa," or Kaiepa- ta-bijari " Begotten of Kaiepa," or perhaps he will use his clan name, Jagasi- tahije2-" Descendant of the Jagasi." So also at a feast or a ceremony, or a mustering of the neighbourhood for some warlike demonstration, when from different directions the clans come pouring into some central village, each contingent will arrive in single file led by its chief man, and those who are already assembled will greet them with shouts and say, " Here come the followers of Embuja," or " the followers of Tembari " whoever the leader may be. All the underlings of any particular old warrior are 'called (in the Sangara dialect) tekahoka, his " following "; they are in fact collectively known by his name. The nearest equivalent in this language to our word " chief " is embo-javoari, " the man who gives the name," i.e. the man whose name will serve to identify all his followers. A similar expression is used in Wasida to signify a leader of a group, embo-peni-javo, literally " man-big-name." It will be seen how readily in this simple and patriarchal organization the group may take its collective name from the leader or patriarch. Further, one may be surprised on asking who is the embo-javoari of a certain group to be given the name of a man who is dead. Chieftainship among the Orokaiva is so rudimentary that a successor may not yet, so to speak, have taken shape. But that does not matter. I "Father's " in the classificatory sense. Sometimes the maternal uncle's name is used. 2 Ahije is a reciprocal term-grandparent or ancestor on the one hand, grandson or descendant on the other.</page><page sequence="14">418 F. E. WILLIAMS.-Plant-Emblems among the Orokaiva. The group is content to be known as the followers of the dead man. This latter is indeed a very common phase. The clan takes its name from a leader alive or dead; if he be a distinguished man his name will live after him as the collective name of his descendants. As the process of clan disintegration proceeds the small bodies which split off will take names of their own, though perhaps retaining as well the original and more general name of the parent clan. Thus we find between the Opi and Kumusi rivers two Aiga clans, Serugahije and Samanahu, occupying respective ends of the same village. With two other clans they form a little group known as H:ani. What is the origin or meaning of the name Hani no informant could tell me; but Serugahije was admitted to be the first of the clans, from which the others had branched ofi; and this clan had been founded by one Seruga, an emigrant from the Kumusi to these parts. The clan Samanahu, already mentioned, had been founded by Samana, who, it would appear, was originally a Serugahije man. This habit of naming the clan after its leader or ancestor is not, however, universal. I propose to examine a series of clans-as complete as I could make it- of the Aia tribe. The terminations of the clan names will require a note. Ahije means " descendant"; uhu means literally and somewhat picturesquely " the trunk of a tree," much as we should sav " stock ; embo means " man ; aha may mean "m mother," as it does in one Orokaiva dialect, though not in that of the Aiga; -ta is simply an associative or possessive suffix.

(Jega (?); Karenga, parrot) .. ? 1 The same heratu may belong to apparently unrelated clans.</page><page sequence="15">F. E. WILLIAMS.-Plant-Emblems among the Orokaiva. 419 (3) There is, thirdly, a miscellaneous class of names, nicknames, ancestral names, and possibly tree names, which I cannot attempt to explain, but will only put down for the sake of making the list complete: Clan Name. Heratut. Airahije .. .. .. .. Horo. Ata .. .. .. Evija .. .. .. Isuga. Horipahije .. .. .. Ongo. Jarutuhu .. .. .. Embara, Kitikukumi, Ehe. Johari .. .. .. .. Saga. Koariahije .. .. .. Tandeii. Komahije .. .... Tutengi. Ngiriahije .. .. .. Boruga.1 (4) Lastly, there is a long list in which the clan name is that of a tree or plant:- Ango-uhu.. .. .. ..? Aseahije .. .. .. .. Pogera, Ase. Borugaha.. Boruga.1 Bove .. .. .. .. Simbinr. Eugahu .. .. .. .. Euga Honia-Noduru .. .. .. (? a split stick). Hojavahije .. .. .. Hojava. Isugahije.. .. .. .. Isuga. Jautiahije .. .. .. Jauti.

Soriho. It seems probable that the majority of this last category, besides being names of trees or plants, are names of ancestors as well. Now the heratu of the clan is at once plant and "ancestor," and in the typical instances the names of clan and heratu 1 The same heratu may belong to apparently unrelated clans.</page><page sequence="16">420 F. E. WILLIAMs.-Plant-Emblems among the Orokaiva. will correspond. By comparing the second column (heratu) with the first (clans) in the preceding table, we will see that this is so in a large percentage of cases. On the whole, I think the clan and its heratu come into being simultaneously and in this manner: an individual secedes from the parent clan and his family grows into an independent clan, taking its name from him and adopting for its emblem the plant which bears the same name as, or a name similar to, its founders. The exceptions (i.e. where the clan name and heratu do not correspond) may be explained in several ways. (1) A sub-clan may retain the old heratu but take a new name. So the Autembo are a fugitive section of the Johari who took to the bush (aute) in order to avoid reprisals for a murder. While they are known as Autembo they have kept the original heratu of the Johari, viz., Saga. (2) A local branch of a clan may keep its original clan name but adopt a distinctive heratu. A migrant section of the Simborota still call themselves Simborota, but have assumed Boruga as their heratu. (3) A clan may discard an old heratu and take the synonymous plant of a new leader. Thus a very old man tells me his heratu was formerly Tumena (a variety of taro), but nowadays it is Bari, because his son Barigi, an ex-sergeant of Native Police (made famous by C. A. W. Monckton) has taken his place as leader of the clan. VI.-PLANT NAMES FOR HUMAN BEINGS. I mentioned at an earlier stage the frequency with which plant names are used for human beings among the Orokaiva. It is time that this statement should be substantiated. In the first place, with a people of the forest, depending on its products for so many purposes, and with such a familiar and intimate knowledge of it multifarious flora as no European save a botanist could possess, it may not be altogether surprising that they should draw upon this inexhaustible store for their own personal names. Name-giving customs among the Orokaiva are an interesting subject in them- selves, though they cannot be treated at any length in this paper. Suffice it to say that, besides the formal names passed on by god-fathers and god-mothers, there are countless nick-names (as we should call them) originating from some chance circumstance of birth or early youth. The formal names appear to be as odd as the others, and have no doubt arisen in the same haphazard manner. Most personal names permit of interpretation, and provided their owners or their owners' parents are present, the interpretation will often recall some homely anecdote of childhood. But, however they may have arisen, plant names form a large proportion of them. In a random list (two series of men who submitted themselves for physical measure- ment) we find such names as Half-cooked, Shell, Lizard, Pus, Cry-baby, to Stretch, to Miss with the Spear, Wet, Roasted, and so on. But by far the largest category is that of plant names. In a list of 57 names (13 of which were not interpretable they added up to 15 or 26 per cent.</page><page sequence="17">F. E. WILLIAMS.-Plant-Embl ems among the Orokaiva. 421 VII.-THE HERATU AS BADGE. (a) The Use of Nearly Synonymous Heratu. As only a proportion of men have actual plant names, it is obvious that not everyone can have a synonymous heratu. There is, however, an important considera- tion which does much to remove this difficulty. Although a man has not a plant name, nevertheless some plant with a name resembling his will be made to stand for him. The instance of the altered heratu, Bari (p. 420) is a case in point. Barigi, as far as I know, is not the name of a plant; but Bari is a sufficient approximation, and will do for the heratu of Barigi's clan. So we have Pura as heratu for the clan Pure, and Anderi for the clan Andere, their owners laying stress on the difference in pronunciation. Again, for the clan Samberota (named from the plant Sambero), we have Sambi, the flattened stick (vide p. 409). [We even find a closely related variety of plant made to do service for the proper heratu, though it has an entirely different name. Thus the tree Benoma may be a substitute for Samana of the Samanahu (Binandele branch); Omba for Pirn of Piri-bijari; Pogera for Ase (both varieties of Job's Tears) of the Aseahije.] What with the frequent occurrence of plant names and this convenient possibility of using as heratu a plant that is only nearly synonymous, it is hardly impossible that any and every Orokaiva should have his plant-emblem. (b) The Individual Heratu. This brings us to the individual plant-emblem, which has already been touched on here and there. The matter does not require a long consideration, for it will be obvious that the principle of the individual plant-emblem will be precisely the same as that of the clan plant-emblem; indeed, in all typical cases the latter has come into being as an individual emblem. One sometimes finds a man living as a member of a clan and owning its heratu, but at the same time boasting a private sign for himself. We have seen a man Euga of the Jega-Juaraha (heratu, Juara) setting up a naterari of Euga wood (vide p. 416); and two members of the Pure clan distinguishing them- selves by the synonymous plants of their grandparents or parents. In the Binandele clan of Diriu is a man Taimi, who, besides the feather of the blue pigeon (Diriu), has a heratu of his own, viz., tai, a root. No doubt the pigeon feather is not always at hand; but the root of any plant placed conspicuously on the track is enough to show his friends that Taimi has passed by. (c) Summary on the Heratu as a Badge. It remains to say something more of the heratu as a badge or identity-token, and lastly to discuss its bearing on the question of totemism. Of the three main uses of the heratu previously described, viz. (1) as an Identity- token; (2) as a Mark of Individual Abstinence; (3) as the naterari, or Village Tabu- post, the last will seem tolerably clear. The naterari stands as a symbol of the dead</page><page sequence="18">422 F. E. WILLIAMS.-Plant-Emblems among the Orokaiva. man in whose behalf the tabu is imposed. Formerly it may have been something more than a formal symbol of the dead-in fact, a crude image. This association between the wooden post and the' dead man which it represents is strengthened by using his particular namesake tree; then, besides other associations, the two have this important bond between them-a common name. The second use remains somewhat obscure, though it has this in common with that of the naterari, that in both the heratu is really a tabu sign. The first use, however, is the fundamental one. The heratu is a badge; and it is a badge by virtue of the fact that it bears the same name (or nearly the same name) as the man or men it represents. We may therefore call it a synonymous badge. A man named Waiwa once explained the matter to me thus: " You white men," he said, " have your books. If you went to your friend's garden and took his taro, you would write your name in the book, and when he came and saw your name there he would be content, knowing that his taro had been taken by a friend. But the New Guinea man cannot write his name on paper, so he leaves his name behind him in another fashion. I should look about me," he said, " and find some tree with a name like 'Waiwa,' break off a branch of it, and leave it by the broken taro tops. Then my friend, the owner of the garden, would say, ' Aha ! Waiwa is we]come tomy taro.'" In the article referred to at the beginning of this paper, viz., " The Movements of the Tribes of the Mambare Division of Northern Papua " (Chinnery and Beaver), there is an interesting anecdote, still well remembered in the region of which it is told. The Binandele, led by a man Waia, had been raiding on the river Gira, and searching for their real enemies had in error attacked the Yema tribe, killed the chief, and captured a youth, Jiani. For this unhappy mistake Waia expresses his sorrow, and desires that Kewatai, the absent son of the chief, be sent on a visit to the Binandele country in order to effect reconciliation and alliance. " Then Waia said, ' My name is Waia; can you remember this name?' Jiani replied, 'Yes; we call this tree (pointing to a certain tree called Warawa in Binandele) Waia.' The chief then cut off a piece of the bark, and gave it to Jiani for remembrance, and told him to put it in Kewatai's house, and to tell him that he (Waia) was sorry." When Kewatai does visit the Binandele country, it is only by remembering the name of Waia that he saves himself from being eaten. In such uses as these the heratu is something more primitive than a pictograph -it is a very material symbol, a sort of vegetable signature. VIII.-THE HERATU AS TOTEM. Throughout this paper I have avoided the word " totem," using in preference the non-committal, if awkward, phrase, " plant-emblem." I may now review the evidence which might have justified the use of the former term.</page><page sequence="19">F. E. WILLIAMS.-Plant-Emblems among the Orokaiva. 423 (1) The heratu is normally connected with a definite social group, viz., the clan (though sometimes with the individual and his immediate family). (2) The clan is usually exogamous in practice, though by no means strictly so (p. 407). (3) The clan commonly, in the typical case always, takes its namne from the heratu, or, more strictly, is synonymous with the heratu (vide (5)). (4) The clan uses its heratu first and foremost as a badge. (5) The heratu is called an ancestor (though the Orokaiva does not really believe that his ancestor can be a plant or tree). Thus far, it would seem, the heratu has conformed very nearly to the tenets of totemism. It remains to be considered whether the clan possesses any magico- religious sentiment for its heratu such as typically unites the group and its totem. The evidence is here somewhat conflicting. Generally speaking, the plant- emblem (except as naterari) is treated with no semblance of respect or reverence. In clearing the bush a man will fell his heratu-tree without a thought; if it bear edible fruit, like Junga, the wild fig, he will eat it; if it be, as in one case it is, Ambe or sago, he will not forswear one of his principal means of subsistence. There is a large clan, the Umondaha, one of whose heratu is nothing more nor less than water. In one or two instances, however, informants have claimed that they will not cut down their own tree; but such are distinctly exceptional. No case has come to light of a useful heratu which its owner will not use. With the rare bird-heratu the case is almost the same. A Diriu man, ex-constable, avers that he has shot many a Diriu (blue pigeon) for his master, and would be only too glad to shoot and eat another if I will lend him a gun. Perhaps at first he was like the other who " sighed as a member of the cockatoo totem but obeyed as a policeman," but his scruples are long since gone, if he ever had any. A man whose subsidiary heratu is the bird Kombu, says that, while he would not hesitate to kill it (if he couild get near it) he would still refrain from eating it. It is apparently for reasons of sentiment alone that he would not eat it, for he declares there would be no evil effects upon him if he did (as I believe he might) yield to the temptation. On the other hand, however, a man of the Bangai-unji, or children of the eagle- hawk, who use one of its speckled feathers for their mark, avers that he would neither kill nor eat the bird; and further, volunteers that if a Bangai fledgling, being caught and kept in the village, were to die, it would not be eaten or thrown away, but buried. Lastly, there is one isolated note which may have some significance. The bird Hororo (mentioned on p. 409) belongs especially to a certain man Erupa. Should its cry be heard near the village, the people would say, " Erupa will be successful in the hunt to-day." In passing I may mention a point of some interest. Among the Orokaiva there are certain strict rules of etiquette between relatives by marriage (particularly between the man and his parents-in-law), exemplified by a very strict name-avoidance. VOL. LV 2 F</page><page sequence="20">424 F. E. WILLIAMS.-Plant-Emblems among the Orokaiva. Now, although a man will cut down his own heratu-tree without mercy, he will hesitate to do the same with a tree that happens to bear the name of his atovo or imboti, i.e. his father-in-law or his mother-in-law, and may request one of his com- panions in the clearing to fell this particular tree for him. Similarly he will not eat any food, animal or vegetable, which happens to be synonymous with either of his parents-in-law. Now this rule is based on sentiment-there are no magico-religious sanctions to it-and where a similar tabu is observed with regard to the heratu, we may probably assume that this is likewise no more than a sentimental avoidance. The foregoing evidence has been set down for what it is worth. On the whole, there would appear to be no very special regard for the heratu, though here and there will crop up a strong manifestation of such regard. It may not be surprising that this is relatively more marked in the few cases of birds than in those of the usual botanic heratu, because the former, with their more definite personality, are in themselves likelier objects of regard than the latter. In fine, it is of little consequence whether the plant-emblem be called a totem or not; it will be obvious that it is very much like one. There is in my own mind little doubt as to how the system came into being. The heratu is a synonymous badge for the leader of the clan, and through him for the group to which he gives his name. It has been maintained that totemism was evolved in more ways than one. This, at least, is one feasible way. More thorough-going totems may well enough have sprung, like the plant-emblems of the Orokaiva, not from communal nicknames, but from names, and furthermore, from individual names. The thesis of the present paper may be summarized very briefly: the clan heratu originates from the individual heratu of its leader or ancestor, and the individual heratu is some plant which serves as a token of identity because it bears the name of its owner.</page><page sequence="21">Journal of the Royal Anthropological Institute, Vol. LV, 1925, Plate XXXII. gii FIG. 1.-EXAMPLES OF HERATU OR PLANT-EMBLEMS.
