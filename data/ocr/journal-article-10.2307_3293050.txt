<plain_text><page sequence="1">GEORGE E. MCCRACKEN relationships, without excluding religious considerations," but "the attitude of the Christian authors is almost exclusively theo- logical. It is based on two principles: the Jews occupied a chosen part in the divine plan of history; the Jews persecuted Christ and put Him to death, and acted in a similar way regarding His disciples and Apostles. . . . But Christians are not to be prosecutors of the Jews, rather they are to see in them the types of the things planned and ordained by God." It is therefore clear that though many of the Christian writers studied began life as pagans, they were not influenced by what they-may have known of the Jews be- fore their conversion but by the official Christian position. [Those who wish to ex- amine a comprehensive summary of the atti- tude of the Catholic Church towards the Jews, written from the Jewish point of view, may be referred to George LaPiana, "The Church and the Jews," Historia Judaica ii (1949) 117-44, which doubtless appeared too late for inclusion in the bibliography.] With Father Wilde's conclusion there can be no complaint but the execution of the dissertation leaves much to be desired in de- tail. A more careful scrutiny of the manu- script by his instructors would doubtless have eliminated some of the many blemishes. For example, it is naive to say that the "Jews had been the object of literary attention for about four centuries before the Christian era" (32) even if one deliberately excludes from consideration the Old Testament. When Wilde says (51) that complaints "against the wealth of the Jews did not exist in classical Antiquity," he is assuming too much-all that he is justified in saying is that he has found none in the surviving material ex- amined. What is meant by the statement that Apion "stultified himself" (58) is not clear. Since Nero died in 68 there is a chronological difficulty in the sentence (69): Philostratus "has Euphrates a philosopher advise Ves- pasian, while Vespasian was in Alexandria in the year 70, the army employed against the Jews were better employed against Nero," and the difficulty is not in Philostratus. I dis- sent from the criticism (85) of Kleist's render- ing of Ignatius, Ep. ad Magn. 9: Kara KvpLaK?jv as "regulate their calendar by the Lord's day." The antecedent is mixed up in the sentence (ioo): "It is that Jerusalem, cap- tured by the Romans, whose destruction was prophesied .... "Bardenhewer's great work once more is carelessly called (xiii) the Geschichte der altchristlichen Literatur where- as the word is really 'altkirchlichen.' One is somewhat shocked to find 'acropolis' used (i6) as the name for a part of Jerusalem. If in Hellenistic times Jewish and Samaritan temples were dedicated in Palestine, the deity would have been Zeus and not Jupiter (17). In mentioning pagan interest in riddles (43) an allusion to the most famous example, that of Oedipus, would have been apposite. Misspellings are very frequent: Guerriere (xi and 222) but Guerriere rightly (222 bis, 235); Kirchevdtern for Kirchenvdtern (xiii); Kaisar Julian for Kaiser Julian (xiii); Tolling- ton for Tollinton (xiv, 175 bis, 239); Epistola for Epistula (29, I31); Nicholas of Damascus (49 f., 237); Ptolemy Lathyrus twice correctly and twice as Lathryrus on the same page (52); Bocchoris (52 bis) but Bochoris (57, 234); Nicharchus (56, 237) for Nicarchus; "apud Eusebius"!

Lagrange (193); Appolonius (233) but Apol- lonius (i6); Pausanius (237) but Pausanias (67); Stahlin (239) but Stihlin (82). The index, moreover, is far from complete and it is to be regretted that the printer appears not to have possessed a font of Greek type, necessitating the use of transliterations on the relatively rare occasions when Greek is quoted. GEORGE E. MCCRACKEN Drake University WALZER, R., Galen on Jews and Christians. Oxford, 1949. pp. viii+- io. Ios. 6d. THIS MONOGRAPH is a contribution to the recovery of ancient Greek literature from Arabic sources. It deals with certain writings of Galen. Three Arabic translation passages are presented, from otherwise lost works. They are discussed in the light of related statements preserved in Greek. 204</page><page sequence="2">BOOK REVIEWS In four chapters the author presents fea- tures of Galen's life, the transmission of his writings, Greek and Arabic textual problems, and interesting sidelights on the history of Greek philosophy, especially as related to the Church of the latter part of the second cen- tury. A philosopher as well as a physician, Galen was also acquainted with Jews and Chris- tians. He approved their manner of life, but denounced their uncritical acceptance of the authority of Scriptural revelation. This criticism of Jewish belief may go back as far as Hecataeus of Abdera. Galen's views in these matters are similar to those of Paul of Samosata, and others whom Catholic Christianity has classed as heretics. It is stated that Christians were in- terested primarily in virtue, rather than truth, whereas Galen put truth first. Religion for him, as for Greek intelligentsia generally, had become intellectualized. The reader may well question whether Christians have not shifted their interest from virtue to doctrine. It seems to be Judaism, rather than Chris- tianity, that preserved the primacy of ethical interest. Doctrinal interest, however, is to be dis- tinguished from the intellectual interest of the Greek philosopher. Certain Christian writers strongly attacked non-Christian Greek culture; and they did so largely be- cause Greek intellectuals had attacked Chris- tianity's major premise. "Premises" is more correct. Tertullian said, "We want no curious disputation when we possess Jesus Christ, no intellectual inquiry when we enjoy the Gospel!" Galen is presented as "the first Greek philosopher who, without becoming a Chris- tian himself, gave a fair and sympathetic appreciation of the Christians for philosophic reasons." He considered myths and miracles useful instruments of mass education, for producing right belief, even if by non-rational conviction. At Rome, at the end of the second cen- tury, there had developed a rapprochement between Christianity and the cultured classes. One factor in this situation was Galen. J. MERLE RIFE Muskingum College AUGUSTINE'S CORRESPONDENCE KOOPMANS, J. H., Augustinus' Briefwisseling met Dioscurus. Amsterdam, Jasonspers Universiteitspers (I949). Pp. 278. THE WORK UNDER REVIEW is a doctoral dis- sertation of the University of Amsterdam. It contains an Introduction, Latin text, Dutch translation, and extensive commentary of Letters 117 and 18, of the Augustinian corpus. A summary in English is given after the commentary. The author is evidently a student of great industry and has tried hard to give a useful work to the public. This reviewer feels that his attempt has, in general, been successful. Yet, it would be hard to give unreserved agreement to all the statements or conclusions of the author. The field of Augustinology is a vast one, and it is exceedingly difficult for one person to master all the materials needed for a complete understanding of his profound thought. Dr. Koopmans should not, therefore be harshly criticized if there are gaps in his commentary. These gaps are especially evi- dent in philosophical sections of the com- mentary, where the author is much less capable than in the linguistic sections. In the refusal to identify Dioscorus with the physician, Dioscurus of Hippo, Koopmans is more convincing. To a student of Augustine's thought, some of Koopmans' generalizations are amazing: for instance, the statements in the summary (p. 237) that Augustine "hates the Greeks" and that his ethics are not free from some anthropomorphic eudemonism. Had Koop- mans read Charles Boyer's Saint Augustin in the series "Les Moralistes Chretiens," he would not have fallen into such a hopeless error. Augustine's statement about the ac- cessibility of abstract truth to the intellect alone (683, 20-2I) is a far cry from Koop- 205</page></plain_text>
