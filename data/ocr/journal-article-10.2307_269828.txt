<plain_text><page sequence="1">Metamorphosis in Greek Myths. By P. M. C. FORBES IRVING. Oxford Classical Monographs. Oxford: Clarendon Press; New York: Oxford University Press, 1990. Pp. xv + 326. $69.00. Forbes Irving's book is divided into two parts, of which the first is not labelled and the second is entitled "Catalogue of Transformation Stories." It is not imme- diately clear what the relationship of the two parts is intended to be, and when the author first refers to "the main part of the book" the reader may be uncertain whether he has in mind the 100-page catalogue, for which the first part would then serve as a long introductory essay, or the 200, page initial essay, for which the cat- alogue would then be a substantial supplement. In any case, in the first part of his book, which proves to be the main part, F. I. is concerned with interpreting a se- lection of Greek transformation stories, drawing largely upon structuralist tech- niques and contextualizing the stories within the patterns of Greek mythology and within the themes of Greek culture. In the second part he attempts to list and dis- cuss every ancient transformation story, often in considerable detail, tracing its development over time. Turning to myths of the metamorphosis of humans into mammals, which (though few in number) include some of the best known myths of transformation, F. I. first takes on two approaches originally inspired by early anthropology: the animal-cult theory and the ritual-initiation theory; and then illustrates the princi- ples of his own approach. A sampling of these chapters will give a good sense of the book. Scholars of an earlier generation commonly explained stories of transformation into animals by reference to religion, seeing their origin in historical animal cults. (While this theory is no longer fashionable, F. I. points out that it continues to ap- pear in reference books as the standard explanation.) According to this approach, there occurred in Greece a general development from the worship of animals to</page><page sequence="2">BOOK REVIEWS 259 the worship of anthropomorphic beings, but the new gods, unable to shake off their animal associations completely, transferred their animal form to another character in their myth. For example, in the myth of Artemis and Callisto, the lat- ter is transformed into a bear, and in the myth of Hera and lo, the latter is changed into a cow. But the theory is circular, argues F. I., since the principal evidence for the existence of the animal cult in question is the mythical metamorphosis that it seeks to explain, nor does the comparative evidence from Egypt and Mesopotamia support the supposition that animal cults actually give rise to such myths. More- over, it is inadequate, since at best it explains only one motif (namely, why the heroine becomes a particular animal) and therefore treats myths as arbitrary col- lections of motifs. It has become increasingly common to explain transformation myths by refer- ence to rituals marking the passing of a person from one social state to another. Such rites tend to have a pattern of separation from family and society, a liminal period (sometimes with status-reversal, disguise, or disfigurement), and a reinte- gration into society. Proponents of this connection identify the narrative metamor- phosis with the ritual's liminal stage. F. I. sees as a major attraction of this theory, in comparison with the animal-cult theory, that it offers an explanation for the whole story rather than for a single motif. But the author disposes of this approach also, by arguing, first, that it is speculative, since there is little evidence for age- group initiations in ancient Greece. Second, it is unclear what explanatory force is being claimed for the approach: was the story adapted to the rite or did it spring from it? If the latter is intended, then one must object that the sequence of events is so general that it is in fact also the pattern of most traditional stories (that is, leave home, have adventures, return home), and so it is scarcely capable of proof or disproof. Moreover, in known Greek myths connected with rites of consecra- tion, the story is not parallel to the rite at all but rather explains the occasion for it, such as that the rite is performed in expiation for a crime. After showing the inadequacies of the reigning approaches, F. I. illustrates his own method. When (he argues) aitiai are developed into stories they acquire an in- terest that is distinct from their explanatory function. The structure of a story must be explained in terms of an internal logic-narrative factors that make a story a satisfying whole. The transformation stories must have involved their audience in a metaphoric or symbolic perception of the narratives. They must have played upon traditional ideas and metaphors about the relation of humans to animals in or- der to present an imaginative and mythic expression of familiar human concerns. The imaginative or mythical projection of a human concern can have various levels of contact with reality. For instance, in the case of the group of young women who take to the wilds, we have a wholly imaginative or metaphoric con- struction, for Athenian women would probably have virtually no contact with the wilds. The female hunter in particular seems to be entirely a fantasy. The myths of lo and Callisto are members of a set of thematically similar myths that also includes the myths of Atalanta, Taygete, Hippo, the Proitides, Leto (as wolf), and Philyra. The central action in each myth is typically an illicit sexual experience, usually involving the loss of virginity. This experience is usu- ally followed by the woman's going to the wilds, undergoing a transformation, giving birth, and eventually experiencing a marriage or catasterism or death. F. I.</page><page sequence="3">260 BOOK REVIEWS holds that the function of the animal transformation in these myths can be illumi- nated by animal metaphors applied to women in Greek literature and life. Women are most commonly compared to animals with respect to their sexuality. The wilds are a place in which there is no sexual order; the wilds, as opposed to the parents' house, suggest excitement. In myth, Artemis and her band roam the wilds resisting or succumbing to various male advances. Aggressively chaste huntresses express sexual potential that is tamed and brought under male order. Accordingly, the events in stories of this type do not reflect any actual practice or activity of Greek women, but form an entirely imaginative and metaphoric pat- tern. Just as female sexuality can be expressed in metaphors of animals, transfor- mation reflects the traumatic effect of change from young girls to sexual objects. This may be either positive sexuality and fertility or more usually a frightening and repellent outbreak of wildness that is opposed both to the childhood home and to marriage. Indulging in sexual activity turns these women into animals and is part of a breakdown in order in their lives that may be further associated with pol- lution and madness. F. I. continues his method with other classes of transformation: birds, plants, stones, sex changes, and shape-shifters, looking for patterns in each group of sto- ries and interpreting them in terms of basic structural oppositions and by constant reference to the larger context of Greek mythology and culture. The arguments are clear and well documented, and they are often imaginative and sometimes inge- nious, if not always convincing. The second part of the book, the "Catalogue," lists every mythological meta- morphosis in classical literature that the author can locate, including transforma- tion into fishes, insects, and other forms that are not dealt with in the main essay. Here the emphasis is upon the sources and the historical development of the sto- ries, and the format is that of a work of reference. The catalogue, like the rest of the book, is carefully and intelligently executed, though the author sometimes succumbs to the familiar temptation of deriving little-known stories from better- known stories (the myth of A is "clearly modelled on that of" B) when there are no good grounds for doing so. This is a very rich book, which mythologists and scholars of mythologically- inspired literature such as Homer, Hesiod, the tragedians, and Ovid will profit from reading.
