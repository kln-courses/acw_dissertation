(Figure 1) When Helen modeled the first Storyteller doll in 1964, she made one of the oldest forms of Native American self-portraiture her own, reinvented a longstand- ing but moribund Cochiti tradition of figurative pottery, and engen- dered a revolution in Pueblo ceramics comparable to those begun by Nampeyo of Hopi and Maria of San Ildefonso - a revolution that has reshaped her own life as well as that of her family and her pueblo, not to mention the fortunes of innumerable other Pueblo</page><page sequence="3">358 * Journal of the Southwest potters.1 (Figure 2) She is not, however, without ambivalence about the consequences of her creativity: See. I just don't know. I guess I really started something. I guess Vm a big Indian artist. But, she will hasten to add, / don't like to be called famous. My name is Helen Cordero. It's my grandfather, he's giving me these.2 (Figure 3) But, like it or not, Helen, like her grandfather, Santiago Quintana, who was Ruth Benedict's favorite teller of Cochiti tales, is one of those "gifted individuals who have bent the culture in the direction of their own capacities" (Benedict 1932: 26). I first met this indefatigable woman who is always in a hurry on a June afternoon in 1978. Fascinated by the Storyteller dolls then becoming popular, I had finally screwed up my courage and driven to Cochiti Pueblo to talk with the inventor herself. That particular day Helen was having a new hardwood floor laid in her pottery room, so we sat outside under a cottonwood tree. After we had talked for over an hour about her potteries, her patrons, and her grandfather, she asked me why I was asking her all these questions. I replied that I was thinking about writing an article about Story- teller dolls and without hesitation she responded: There are three books about Maria [the famous potter of San Ildefonso Pueblo] and none about me. Thus began a complicated and important relation- ship that has redefined my life and my work. The difficulties as well as delights that Helen and I have had gathering all these words and pictures together into a big book about her art and experience have convinced me that representing another woman is not an un- problematic enterprise. Betwixt and between Cochiti Pueblo, mu- seum archives, and the world of dealers and collectors who traffic in Indian art, I have been forced to rethink and revise many assump- tions about women's art and creativity, about feminism and cross- cultural inquiry, about biography, autobiography and life history, and about the meaning of things. When I turned from talking with Helen and many other Pueblo 1. For discussion and documentation of the Storyteller revolution, see Babcock (1983) and Babcock and Monthan (1986). 2. This statement and those which follow in italics were made by Helen Cordero in conversations between 1978 and 1984. When we began to work on the story of her life and art, she insisted that she would not spill the beans, and I have not discussed sacred discourse or social and ceremonial organization with her or any other Cochitis. The information about these matters that is contained in this essay was obtained from already published accounts by various observers of Cochiti and Keresan life in the past century and from conversations with anthropologists who lived and worked at Cochiti under very different constraints in previous decades.</page><page sequence="4">At Home, No Womens »&gt; 359 potters who have imitated her invention to reading scholars in an attempt to understand the dynamics of this revolution in contempo- rary ceramics, I discovered that for the most part discussions of innovation in ethnic and tribal arts have followed an art-historical approach, examining the creativity of the artist or performer in relation to the tradition he or she has inherited, and the subsequent changes his or her work has wrought in the aesthetic system (Biebuyck 1969). In contrast to modern Western art, primitive and folk art is generally regarded as subservient to tradition and com- munity values, and the assumption that such "art forms reinforce the bonds of the community rather than make manifest and chal- lenge the oppositions within it5' is rarely questioned or examined (Firth 1966: 167). Less frequently and more recently (d'Azevedo 1973), innovation has been interpreted from a psycho- or sociobio- graphical perspective - i.e., in relation to the life history and motiva- tions of the innovator, and the ways in which he or she is already "marginal" or "deviant." Unfortunately, this necessary corrective to the myth of anonymous, collective, tradition-bound creativity tends toward a romantic reification of the alienated genius, which says a great deal more about how "we" regard the creative person than "they" do. That is beginning to change as scholars move beyond or behind these extremes to examine the dialectic of creativeness and constraints, the sociocultural consequences of and conditions for creativity, and the politics as well as the poetics of innovation.3 In insisting on the inseparability of the poetic and the political, of artistic innovation and social innovation, I am indebted both to Ruth Benedict and to Victor Turner, who opposed the separation of the social and the symbolic and the related separation of science and humanism in anthropological analyses. Rather, they insisted on cul- ture as creative process and on the ways in which performers and performances, be they verbal, dramatic, or artifactual, not only fol- low but revise and revitalize accepted rules, acting out and challeng- ing aesthetic conventions and social values.4 More than simply reflecting or expressing social structure and worldview, any significant new form reconstructs cultural reality, causing a dislocation in the economy of cultural representations: "A 3. For a general theory of the nature of innovation and the consequences of, as well as conditions for, the appearance of novel ideas, see Barnett (1953). 4. Many of these points are made by Judith Modell in her discussion of Zuni Mythol- ogy. She argues that Benedict's achievement in this and "other folklore pieces, was to incorporate a notion of imaginativeness into the study of culture" (Modell 1983: 243).</page><page sequence="5">360 &lt;■ Journal of the Southwest work of art does not substitute, but institutes an original awareness of existence, on the whole; it does not so much reproduce and represent as produce and present a total experience55 (Kaufmann 1969: 147). The Storyteller doll as conceived and realized by Helen Cordero not only "materializes a way of experiencing55 and "brings a particular cast of mind out into the world of objects, where men can look at it55 (Geertz 1976: 1478), but comments on and expands the premises of Pueblo existence. When Helen Cordero re-created her grandfather in clay, it was one of those "fecund moments55 when an artist discovers a structure for her sensibility and experience that "makes it manageable55 for herself and "at the same time accessible to others55 (Merleau-Ponty 1964: 169). It is, therefore, "in the tenor of its setting,55 in the discourse that surrounds it, that I have looked for both the sources and the consequences of the powerful genera- tive image that she created, asking, to paraphrase Roy Wagner, how Helen Cordero5s invention is related to a Cochiti woman's percep- tion of herself and her world.5 All innovation involves a dialectic between convention and inven- tion, and when Helen Cordero began making little people over twenty years ago, she continued, with a difference, a centuries-old ceramic tradition. For over a thousand years, Puebloan potters have shaped the clay of the Southwest into representative human and animal forms as well as utility ware. The majority of prehistoric anthropomorphic figurines are female, and on the basis of con- textual archaeological evidence as well as ethnographic data from the past century, archaeologists have conjectured that the Pueblo figurine complex was associated with reproductive ritual - both ag- ricultural fertility cults and rites of human increase.6 Historic fig- ures such as this mother- and-child effigy made at Cochiti over one hundred years ago would seem to confirm these connections. (Fig- ure 4) Her dress is painted front and back with corn-plant designs, and here, as throughout Pueblo ritual and religion, the combination of painted and modeled design makes explicit the relationship be- tween human reproduction and other life-giving forms of genera- 5. Much of my argument, in addition to this statement, is indebted to Roy Wagner's stimulating meditation on culture as creativity, as invention, in The Invention of Culture (1981). 6.

As the Anglo presence increased with the coming of the railroads to New Mexico in the 1880s, the production of figures such as this markedly decreased. Pueblo potters did not, however, hesitate to capitalize on the growing tourist market, and in addition to bowls and jars, Cochiti women made and sold an abundance of small, desacralized human and animal figures. Anglos bought and sold countless "curiosities," "idols," or "monos," but did not regard them highly or, excepting Santa Fe dealer Jake Gold, encourage their production. In the first half of this century, pottery production at Cochiti, as in many other pueblos, declined. As Helen Cordero has said, for a long time pottery was silent in the pueblo. Nonetheless, this ancient tradition endured, and among those few figurative forms that continued to be made, the image of a woman holding or carrying a child or a water jar or a bowl of bread, such as this figure made before 1930, was the most popular. In the decade before Helen Cordero started up on little people, at least three Cochiti pot- ters were still making these singing ladies, singing mothers, or madonnas. (Figure 5) By the late 1950s, the six children that Helen had raised were grown, and like other Cochiti women, she began doing bead and leatherwork to make a little extra money. Unfortunately, most of the profits went for buying more materials, and one day Fred Cordero's aunt, Grandma Juana, said, Why don't you girls go back to potteries? You dorit have to buy anything; Mother Earth gives it all to you. And so, Helen started on pottery with her kinswoman Juanita Arquero, who had learned to make pottery as a child, and spent six months under her. Helen's bowls and jars were all crooked and she despaired of ever getting it right. Juanita suggested that she try figures instead and it was like a flower blooming. She began with little animals, but was soon shaping countless small standing and seated figures, many 7. For an encyclopedic inventory of Pueblo religion, see Parsons (1939).

(Figure 6) One of the first times Helen showed them out at a Santo Domingo feast day, folk art collector Alexander Girard bought all that she had and asked her to make more and larger figures and bring them to his home in Santa Fe. The first Storyteller (Figure 2) was made in response to his request for a larger, seated mother with more children. Helen recalls that when I went home and thought about it&gt; I kept seeing my grandfather. That one, he was a really good storyteller and there were always lots of us grandchildrens around him. In addition to telling stories to his many grandchildren and being esteemed in the pueblo as a gifted storyteller, the leader of one of the clown societies, a "mucho sabio" and the most powerful of the "principales" (the tribal council), Santiago Quintana (Figure 3) was the valued friend and collaborator of several generations of anthro- pologists and observers of Cochiti life: Bandelier, Starr, Saunders, Curtis, and, lastly, Ruth Benedict, who collected many of the Tales of the Cochiti Indians from him and wrote warmly of her "old man" in letters from the field.8 When Helen Cordero remembered her grandfather's voice and shaped that first image of him telling stories to five grandchildren, she made two significant modifications in the singing mother tradition: 1) she made the primary figure male rather than female, and 2) she placed more than a realistic number of children on him. In addition to embodying this dialogic relation- ship between convention and invention, Storytellers are obviously "about55 relationships - between generations, between past and fu- ture, and between stories and potteries? (Figure 7) Less obviously, Helen's figures in particular are about the relationship between male and female creativity and the reproduction of the cultural order. Her reinvention of this important mode of cultural production and tradition of representation - pottery making - controlled by women transformed an image of natural reproduction into a figure of an important mode of cultural reproduction - storytelling - that is con- trolled by men and that both embodies and expresses generativity. 8. For descriptions of Santiago Quintana, see Benedict's preface to Tales of the Cochiti Indians (1981: xi) and her letter of September 5, 1925, to Margaret Mead in Mead (1973: 300). 9. In his important essay, "Style, Grace, and Information in Primitive Art," Bateson argues that it is probably an error to think of art as being about any one matter other than relationship (1973: 254-55).</page><page sequence="8">At Home, No Womens &lt;■ 363 From the body of the Storyteller sprout countless children and grandchildren, and from his open mouth emerges "life for the peo- ple" in the shape of stories, testifying yet again to Pueblo culture's instinct for survival and its capacity to revitalize itself.10 Whether one looks at Pueblo worldview and its dynamics of cultural survival from the perspective of religion, kinship, pottery making, or narra- tive traditions, one finds that Pueblo identity and individual and social integration are conceived in terms of fertility and regenera- tion: "one story is only the beginning of many stories" (Silko 1981: 56); clay images of domestic animals are blessed and buried in the corral "so that there will be more of them" (Parsons 1919: 279); and corn, "the seed of seeds," multiplies itself many times from a single grain (Cushing 1920: 54). The history of the Storyteller is itself an expression of this reproductive dynamic, for that first Storyteller was the beginning of countless little people. Helen herself has made more Storytellers and won more prizes than she can or will count - it's like breads, we don't count. (Figure 7) By 1973, when the "What is Folk Art?" exhibit was mounted at the Museum of International Folk Art in Santa Fe, the success and popularity of the Storyteller was such that at least six other Cochiti potters had imitated her inven- tion. (Figure 8) A decade later, no fewer than fifty other Cochiti potters and over a hundred potters throughout the New Mexico Pueblos were shaping Storytellers and related figurative forms. Many of these imitations are female figures, and as far as Helen is con- cerned, they are empathically not really Storytellers. They may call them Storytellers, but they don't know what it means. They don't know it's after my grandfather. At home, no womens are storytellers!11 10. For discussion of the Pueblo capacity for revitalization, the dynamics of cultural survival, and the importance of art therein, see Ortiz (1976) and Brody (1976, 1979). The description of stories as "life for the people" is from the title poem of Leslie Silko's novel Ceremony (1977: 2). 11. The image of a large composite figure covered with smaller versions of itseir universally connotes reproduction and, by implication, femaleness. Not surprisingly, Helen's Storytellers have been perceived as female both by Anglo consumers and by Pueblo potters who have imitated her invention. In his suggestive essay, "Levels of Communication and Taboo in the Appreciation of Primitive Art," Leach argues that punning, particularly sexual ambiguity, is very common in art forms: "My general propo- sition is that all true artists tend to devote their principal efforts to themes which contain elements of sensory ambiguity and are subject to taboo.... When we examine the products of exotic cultures the confusions which first fascinate us are those which have a phys- iological base, they are the confusions between male and female, between food and not food, between symbols of dominance and symbols of submission" (1973: 230, 234).</page><page sequence="9">364 -fr Journal of the Southwest [Figure 1] Helen Cordero shaping a Storyteller at a Pecos National Monu- ment demonstration in 1974.

Given the fact that both she and her mother (who was Esther Goldfrank's principal informant) tell stories, and that half of Ruth Benedict's narrators were most assuredly female, why this assertion that appears to contradict observed "fact"? And why, I have asked much more recently, given the obvious economic benefit to the pueblo, did one of its officers try to persuade the tribal council to forbid the well-known Cochiti Storyteller potters - all of whom are women - from having exhibits of their work and from giving pottery-making demonstrations at museums and national parks? What I would like to suggest is that these two questions are not unrelated and that answers to them provide clues as to the local significance of Helen Cordero's creativity and to the generative and transformative and dangerously liminal power of the image she invented. It seemed very strange indeed that the all-male tribal council would have debated whether or not women potters should demonstrate the making of Storytellers to Anglo tourists when extra income is sorely needed to support summer ceremonials and when Pueblo pottery has been made for an Anglo market for over a century. The more I considered this "social drama" which occurred in the summer of 1982, the more entangled I became in a compli- cated situation involving the politics of reproduction and issues of discourse and authority - of who has the right to represent what to whom. Crises initiate reflexivity and this one forced me to realize that I had naively assumed - as have other scholars of Pueblo ce- ramics - that pottery and politics have nothing to do with each other. As I contemplated conflict and clay, I began to see that Storytellers as conceived and invented by Helen Cordero were not just pretty things made for money in terms of personal identification (All my potteries come from my heart. Theyte my little people), but in terms of the degree to which they resist and revise discursive con- straints.12 When Helen Cordero insists upon the ancestral and masculine attributes of her Storyteller, she is doing much more than emphasiz- ing the difference and uniqueness of her potteries. She is both ex- 12. For discussion of Helen's potteries as autobiographical statements, as shaping and shaped from personal experience, see "Modeled Selves" (Babcock 1985).

Explicitly, by in- voking ancestral authority and power: It's my grandfather, he's giving me these. He was a really wise man. He had lots of stories and lots of grandchildrensy and we're all in there, in the clay.13 Implicitly, by insisting on the masculinity of her composite figure, she identifies her pottery with a sacred, masculine activity - a tradition that is both patriarchal and genealogical. Women do tell stories at Cochiti, but they do not tell "the55 stories - the master fictions by which the people live. As Parsons (1939: 40) and many other Pueblo scholars have pointed out, men and women have differential access to sacred discourse. Origin myths and legends as well as songs and drums and kachinas and kivas and all the other aspects of sacred discourse, including the ceremonial Keresan in which it is spoken, are con- trolled by men. As Helen5s uncle, Joe Trujillo, remarked several decades ago: "Our kivas are like - how you say in English? Yes, like men5s clubs. The women are only admitted for certain ceremonies, but most of the time we men are there alone. Religion is man's business with Indians55 (Mason 1948: 85). If women are practically peripheral, they are symbolically central to this "man's business,55 which involves, among other things, a transcendental appropriation of the female principle. Pueblo reli- gion is elaborated around the idea of fertility and is indigenously described as a vast, interconnected symbolic web, at the center of which sits Spider Woman, Thought Woman, the "mother of all55 (Parsons 1939: 192-93). Not surprisingly, the practice of reli- gion involves both comic and serious female impersonation. The "cacique,55 or religious leader of the pueblo, whose chief functions concern rain and fertility and the well-being of his "children,55 is not only regarded as the representative of Iyatiku, the Corn Mother; he is, after he is installed in office, symbolically viewed as a woman and referred to in female terms.14 The "cacique55 is responsible for the 13. Lange (1968: 232) has this to say about ancestral power: "A fundamental belief in the religious orientation of the Cochiti is that supernatural power is believed to be held by certain individuals at specific times because these powers have been transmitted to cultural predecessors from supernatural beings during various eras of the past. The specific powers vary in accordance with the person's official capacity, or status, and also to the extent to which he is worthy of that status" 14. See especially Foxs discussion ot the term "yaya ("mother ), which is used both for the "cacique" and his stone fetish (1967: 143).</page><page sequence="19">374 4- Journal of the Southwest spiritual and physical welfare of the pueblo and he "takes care of his people by looking after chis children5 just as the Mother (Iyatiku) whom he represents looked after the images in her basket" (Parsons 1939: 336). In Keresan emergence narratives, Spider Woman sends Iyatiku ("bringing to life55) and her sister Nao5tsiti ("more of every- thing in the basket55) up into the light, to this earth, with baskets crammed full of seeds and little clay images and sacred cornmeal with which they create and pray into being all forms of life.15 The continued association of clay figures with the creation, mainte- nance, and reproduction of Pueblo life is this practice of collectively representing Keresan townspeople in male and female clay images which are kept and cared for by the "cacique.55 If Iyatiku5s clay figures are regarded as the embodiment of "life for the people,55 so too are the stories about Iyatiku that are kept and told by men like Helen's grandfather. Both sacred and secular stories were and are primary modes in which the family, the clan, and the community regenerate themselves, for such narratives both describe and create "chains55 linking generation to generation and back again, and involve what Silko describes as the vital dynamic of "bringing and keeping the people together55 (1981: 59). 16 In the words of contemporary Keresan storytellers Leslie Silko and Simon Ortiz, "you don't have anything if you don't have the stories55 (Silko 1977: 2), and "the only way to continue is to tell a story and there is no other way55 (Ortiz 1977: 9). What is remarkable about these stories, past and present, oral and written, is that the idea of fertility and the model of reproduction is presented again and again in the language of the stories, in their content, and in the embedded style in which they are structured and told. Nowhere is this more man- ifest than in the images of a grandfather storyteller, his belly full of "life for the people,55 giving birth to both children and stories that 15.

The motif of creation through the molding of meal, dust, or clay is not limited to origin myths, but is widely found throughout Pueblo narratives. 16. For a very suggestive Jungian analysis of the importance of "chains" of genera- tions in creation myths as a way of being linked "with historical continuity, i.e., from the inside, with one's ancestral soul, to be connected with the archetype foundations of the psyche, as counter-magic against dissociation," see Marie-Louise von Franz (1978).</page><page sequence="20">At Home, No Womens * 375 Leslie Silko and Helen Cordero have created in words and in clay. (See Figure 8 and Silko's title poem in Ceremony, 1977: 2.) Both cosmologically and socially, the Keres world is constructed of a series of oppositions, of which male versus female is primary.17 Given the fact that woman is ideologically and symbolically central, that clans are matrilineal, and that residence was traditionally matri- local at Cochiti, it has been fashionable if not doctrinaire to de- scribe the distribution of power as complementary and to ascribe to women much more "real" power than they in fact have.18 Once upon a time, a Cochiti child received his social identity and physical place from his mother.19 But times have changed, and while a child is still of his mother's clan and clans still fulfill a nurturant function, Cochiti clans and "clan mothers" are far less important and power- ful than they once were.20 Wage labor, increased prosperity, and government housing have virtually abolished matrilocal residence - a man who wants his own house, builds it. If one's livelihood doesn't depend on one's fields, the fact that one's wife "owns" them matters little. And, with Catholicism in the Rio Grande Pueblos, 17. Pueblo "world structure" as a "relentlessly connected universal whole" in which "men, animal, plants, and spirits are intertransposable in a seemingly unbroken chain of being," constructed in terms of a series of oppositions (Ortiz 1972: 143), is something of a structuralist's dream. For a structural analysis of Tewa worldview, see Ortiz (1969); of Keres through their creation myths, see Sebag (1971). 18. The position one ascribes to women in Pueblo society depends significantly on whether one focuses on ideology or on praxis. As Bennett and others have remarked, those interpretations (e.g., Benedict) which center on the former, which Bennett calls "organic," see Pueblo culture and society as integrated and harmonious. Those who focus on the latter (e.g., Goldfrank), which he calls "repressive," emphasize the tension, con- flict, and fear of Pueblo life, and the extent to which the individual (male or female) is suppressed and repressed (Bennett 1946: 361-74). The truth, I suspect, is somewhere in between, and one must look at the position of women in both ideology and praxis. On the basis of cross-cultural evidence, including Alice SchlegePs Hopi work, Peggy Sanday (1981: 114) argues that "female economic and political power is ascribed as a natural right due the female sex when a long-standing magico-religious association between maturity and fertility of the soil associates women with social continuity and the social good." I would respond "not necessarily so," especially not in increasingly acculturated situations which have modified both the social and religious position of women, and certainly not among the Keresan Pueblos. 19.

Upon marriage, women become members of their husbands' kivas and assume the role of "helpers"; children take their father's surname and belong to his kiva. Today, kiva membership is a much more significant deter- minant of Cochiti social identity than clan affiliation. Man's business at Cochiti is political as well as religious, for the Pueblo government is a theocracy. Supreme power resides with the "cacique" and the heads of the three medicine societies who an- nually choose the six major secular officers - Governor and Lt. Gov- ernor, War Captain and Lt. War Captain, and "Fiscale" and "Lt. Fiscale" - who are equally divided between the two kivas and who become members of the tribal council for life. While the governor controls secular affairs and the "fiscale" manages the Catholic church, the war captains, who represent the mythic twin war gods, are the "ceremonial police," whose principal duties are preserving traditions and secrets, and leading the fight against tribal enemies.22 In sacred discourse and religious practice, in social and political organization, and in domestic and family situations, the relationship between the sexes is a classic example of female power and male dominance.23 For all their ascribed symbolic significance, Cochiti women are, in Edwin Ardener's terms, a "muted" rather than an "articulate" group, excluded from "the dominant communicative system of the society - expressed as it must be through ideology and that 'mode of production' which is articulated with it" (1975: 22). 21. In discussing Pueblo attitudes toward innovation in 1949, John Collier observed: "With Christianity, in the Rio Grande Pueblos, came the morality and custom of indis- soluble marriage. It was a radical innovation, and apparently was welcomed by the males because it increased their status and power: the man no longer dwelt in the kiva, but lived in his children's home as co-head of the establishment. The absolute prohibition of divorce became a custom, guarded as such by the officials and priests of the ancient Pueblo religions" (51). For further, cross-cultural discussion of the decline in indigenous female power with colonialism, see Sanday (1981: Chapter 7). 22. For discussions of Cochiti social and ceremonial organization and changes therein between the early 1920s and the early 1950s, see Goldfrank (1927), Lange (1968), and Fox (1967). 23. Here and elsewhere, I am following FriedPs definition of "male dominance" as "a situation in which men have highly preferential access, although not always exclusive rights, to those activities to which the society accords the greatest value, and the exercise of which permits a measure of control over others" (1975: 7).</page><page sequence="22">At Home, No Womens * 377 We don*t have any say about that is a phrase I have heard from women at Cochiti more times than I can count. However, as Ardener and others have pointed out, in a world in which discourse is controlled by men, women's ideas or models of the world about them find expression in forms other than direct speech. But, as Ardener also notes, far too few ethnographers have talked to women or deemed their modes of expression worthy of investigation. This is true even in Pueblo studies where, despite the fact that a larger than usual amount of ethnography has been done by women, the overwhelm- ing focus has been on male-dominated discourse. Cushing, who was an iconoclast, and Ruth Bunzel, who was a woman influenced by Boas's insistence on the importance of art, were exceptions to this male bias in their recognition that for gener- ation upon generation of Pueblo women, pottery making has been a primary and privileged mode of expression.24 In Pueblo life, pot- teries are one of the few forms of "objective culture" that have been identified with and created almost exclusively by women.25 Tradi- tionally, men were associated with this mode of production, but excluded from the transformative activities of shaping and firing clay. "In the beginning, Itc'tinaku (Spider Woman) considered how the people should live,55 and sent her mother and father down to them as "Clay Old Woman and Clay Old Man.55 Clay Old Woman "began to coil a pot with her clay, and Clay Old Man danced beside her singing while she worked55 (Benedict 1981: 12). "He55 has con- tinued to dance and sing, and "she55 has continued to shape the flesh of Mother Earth into ceremonial, utilitarian, and commercial forms, talking to and thanking Grandma Clay at every stage of the creative process. As archaeologists have demonstrated, as Cushing so finely de- scribed in "Zuni Breadstuff,55 and as the Cochiti story about the 24. In particular, see Cushing (1886, 1920) and Bunzel (1972 [1929]) for discussion of the meanings, uses, and importance of pottery in Pueblo life. 25. Simmel describes objective culture as the world or cultural rorms and their artifacts that have become independent of individual human existence. Objective culture is the domain of objects that function as instruments for the cultivation of the person, or as conditions under which he can become a cultural being. He observes that objective culture is overwhelmingly a product of male activity and that, with few exceptions, the artifacts of culture represent the objectification of the male spirit. In his insightful discus- sion of "Female Culture," and the ways in which female psyche "becomes visible," he notes that "we should expect from women a special interpretation and mode of forming phenomena in the plastic arts" (1984: 6-7, 22, 83).</page><page sequence="23">378 &lt;■ Journal of the Southwest origin of pottery I have just quoted reflects, settled Pueblo existence as it developed in the southwestern United States over two thou- sand years ago and was lived until the latter part of the nineteenth century was inconceivable without rain, without the cultivation of corn, and without pottery to store water and grain. Clay was not only essential to life, but in traditional Pueblo belief was regarded as a living substance. A pottery vessel was not thought of as an inert object, but as a "made being," acquiring a kind of conscious and personal existence as it was being made. "As a receptacle for water and food, it held, and was in turn, a source of life" (Hardin 1983: 33), and the designs with which it was painted had "one dominant theme, a prayer for rain for the maturing crops" (Chapman 1950: 6). Moreover, in the Keresan origin myths I have already cited, innumerable forms of life originate as clay images. In addition to the descendants of these clay people that the "cacique" takes care of, human and animal ceramic figurines are associated, both historically and prehistorically, with the idea of fertility, with agricultural fer- tility cults, and with rites of human increase.26 In this worldview, baby making and culture making are not only not incompatible, they are inseparable; with both their bodies and their hands, women reproduce the cultural order. If Pueblo ceramics were once a primary mode of production, they were also and still are symbolic forms, containers of cultural value and models of and for reproduction and regeneration.27 Their pot- 26. See Parsons (1918, 1919, and 1939) for beliefs and practices associated with rites of increase, and the use of clay figures therein. For further discussion, see Babcock and Monthan (1986). 27. Here and elsewhere, I am indebted to Annette Weiner's "model of reproduction," derived in part from Bourdieu, which she has developed in several essays (1978, 1979, 1980, 1982) and which is based on the premise "that any society must reproduce and regenerate certain elements of value in order for the society to continue.... These elements of value include human beings, social relations, cosmological phenomena such as ances- tors, and resources such as land, material objects, names, and body decorations" (1980: 71). Within this model, she distinguishes between "reproduction," referring to cultural attention and meaning given to acts of forming, producing, or creating something new, and "regeneration," referring to the cultural attention and meaning given to the renewal, revival, rebirth, or recreation of entities previously reproduced. More recently, she has formulated the notion of "elementary cycling," by which she means "the cultural config- uration of the state of affairs that encompass birth, growth, decay, death, and regenera- tion.... The life cycle of individuals, now understood as those processes which attach relations and objects to an ego and detach them at other times for other egos, cannot be separated analytically from the societal configuration wherein the natural phenomena of</page><page sequence="24">At Home, No Womens 4- 379 terieSy like their stories, their rituals, and their kinship system, con- nect the reproductive aspect of generation with the cultural basis of thought, transmission, and "in a different voice," clay sings. With the encroachment of an Anglo world and the expansion of an Anglo market for Indian objects, pottery making has become increasingly important as mode of cultural survival and as a cultural voice, a statement of ethnic identity. Potteries are, in Bourdieu's apt phrase, "symbolic capital," for "in a very real way, the survival of the craft symbolizes the survival of the people" (Brody 1976: 76). And, al- though ceramic scholars have not talked about it in these terms, precisely because it is "symbolic capital," Pueblo pottery making is an institutionalized mechanism for consolidating and preserving female power.28 While women produce these necessary and symbolic vessels, men have nonetheless traditionally controlled their distribution and mar- keting, along with other forms of communication with the outside world. This, too, is reflected in the Cochiti story about the origin of pottery as well as in subsequent ethnographic accounts: after Clay Old Woman shaped the clay, "the old man took the pot and gave a piece of it to everybody in the village" (Benedict 1981: 12). Since at least the fifteenth century, "the exchange of pottery has played a considerable economic role in Rio Grande Pueblo culture" (Snow 1973: 55), and this trading has been the business of men. Matilda Coxe Stevenson recorded the following situation at Zia Pueblo in the late 1880s: The Sia women labor industriously at the ceramic art as soon as their grain supply becomes reduced, and the men carry the wares to their unfriendly neighbors for trade in exchange for birth, growth, decay, and death are culturally circumscribed... in this way, the configura- tion of elementary cycling is the basic logical form out of which integration between the individual and society takes place" (1982: 10). Whatever else it may be, the Storyteller as conceived and created by Helen Cordero is the embodiment of elementary cycling. I am also indebted to Meillassoux's Marxist analysis of pre-capitalist formation in which he argues that "agricultural self-sustaining formations described here... rely less on the con- trol of the means of material production than on the means of human reproduction: subsis- tence and women. Their end is reproduction of life as a precondition to production. Their primary concern is to 'grow and multiply' in the biblical sense... the relations of produc- tion are established between 'those who come before' and 'those who come after' " (1972: 100-102). 28.

As long as the Sia can induce the traders through the country to take their pottery they refrain from barter with their Indian neighbors. The women usually dis- pose of the articles to the traders, but they never venture on expeditions to the Santa Ana and the Jemez. (1894: 11-12) After 1880, the railroads and the influx of Anglos to the territory created both an expanding "tourist" market for Pueblo pottery and wage-earning jobs for men, and women took increasing responsi- bility for marketing the products of their labor. Predictably, there was resistance, and as late as 1925, when Chapman, Halseth, and others at the Museum of New Mexico were encouraging pottery "revivals," they discovered that the Santo Domingo Pueblo council did not want Santo Domingo women to take their pottery to the newly instituted Indian Fair in Santa Fe. Acculturation, auto- mobiles, and the advent of an Anglo "art" market that names and wants to know its Indian artists have changed all that. Women still dominate the manufacture of pottery (only twenty of approximately two hundred figurative potters at present are men), but they have also assumed control of its distribution, and have entered into a cash economy and the business of communicating with the outside world - activities that were once their husbands' prerogatives. While Pueblo pottery has continued to be an important vehicle of identity maintenance, it has also become a means of identity change and a crucial variable in the transition from a subsistence to a cash econ- omy.29 Both the fortunes of this ancient craft in this century and the recent "social drama" centering on pottery at Cochiti support the argument of several students of material culture that the things cultures produce are both more conservative and more innovative as well as more readily diffused than a culture's behavioral and ideo- logical aspects.30 In the remarkable revival of figurative pottery that Helen Cor- dero's Storyteller has engendered in the last twenty years, women potters have done much more than reshape their traditional roles in 29.

Both endorsing and challenging men's ideological hegemony, a clay Storyteller is a woman's visual re-crea- tion of a man's verbal and symbolic representations of a woman's biological experience. It is her re-appropriation both of her own symbolic power and his right to articulate it. The very gender ambi- guity of Storytellers - both presentational and perceptual - is a state- ment of competing interests in the terrain of symbolic production. At home, no womens are storytellers, but women are potters and with the transformative power of their hands, they have contrived to tell stories about storytelling, to subvert masculine discursive control, and to profoundly disturb the distribution of power. In this case, the struggle between the powerless and the powerful has been dis- placed quite literally onto the surface of things. It would seem, in terms of Bauman's reformulation of the distinction between static and dynamic cultures, that the sociocultural system at Cochiti - and probably in other pueblos as well - is changing from a static one "in which rights to signs are derivative from social position" to a dy- namic one "in which social position is derivative from the posses- sion of signs" (Bauman 1971: 287). Helen Cordero and her sisters are manipulating considerably more than clay. They are reproducing "with a difference," and they are figuratively as well as literally playing with fire. Helen teases me a lot, and on one recent occasion, I couldn't resist the temptation to give her a hard time about her fancy new Frigidaire Harvest Gold ice-dispensing refrigerator. She stopped making tortillas, turned from the stove - which she had also just replaced with a new Magic Chef because the old one with its self-cleaning oven had ruined the potteries that she was preheating before firing them outside in the old way, the right way - and said quite seriously, Fm getting me what I always wanted. And, she has empowered three generations of other 31.

Clearly, Evans-Pritchard talked to very different "primitive women" than the ones that I have - if he talked to them at all - and just as clearly the tribal official's attempt to silence them reflects the highly authoritarian nature of Pueblo society and bespeaks a recog- nition that continuity over time is a political as well as a biological and cultural problem.32 Although his motives were reportedly baser, in acting as he did, that officer was re-asserting the traditional Pueblo male right to mediate with the outside world and protect what he deems sacred discourse as well as attempting to re-invoke an ancient male prerogative to appropriate and control female gener- ativity and creativity. It was, you can almost hear him saying, one thing for old Santiago Quintana to travel to California or to share his culture and its stories with Bandelier and Benedict; it is quite another for his granddaughter to hop a plane in Albuquerque, and to make Storytellers and talk about her grandfather and his stories in Denver. Times have changed, and this time he lost his case against the womens, but that's another story....33* 32. In addition to Weiner (1978, 1979, 1980), see O'Brien (1981), Paige and Paige (1981), and Zelman (1977) for further discussion of the "politics" of reproduction. There is abundant evidence and discussion of the highly authoritarian nature of Pueblo society and the power exerted by the religious hierarchy, but see especially Goldfrank (1945), Ellis (1953), Dozier (1961), and Fox (1973). See also Meillassoux (1972: 100-102) for a Marxist perspective on the politics of reproduction. He argues that in "agricultural self- sustaining formations [which Pueblo society once was] concern for reproduction becomes paramount... [and] reproduction of the unit, both biologically and structurally, is assured through the control of women... [and] the shift from production for self-sustenance and self-perpetuation to production for an external market, must necessarily bring a radical transformation, if not the social destruction of the communities." 33. In conclusion, my thanks to Helen Cordero, who has shared her life and her work with me and changed my life in the process, and to Susan Aiken, with whom I have shared the experience and the interpretation of mutedness. Cochiti Pueblo is not a place where the politics of reproduction are discussed as such and feminist anthropologists have been rightly cautioned both against projecting our own political concerns and theoretical models onto our analyses of the position of women in other cultures and against using data about women there to buttress arguments about women here. None- theless, if we are not attuned to gender dynamics and the politics of discourse in the cultures we are studying as well as in our own, we will perpetrate such idealistic and protective distortions as the ideas that simpler societies are not contaminated by sexual politics and that potteries and politics have nothing to do with each other. Finally, my apologies for being both unable and unwilling to give a more detailed account of what transpired at the tribal council.</page><page sequence="28">At Home, No Womens * 383 REFERENCES Ardener, Edwin 1975 "Belief and the Problem of Women and the 'Problem5 Revisited."
