<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Ethics of Animals in Adorno and Kafka Christina Gerhardt If animals did not exist, the nature of man would be even more incomprehensible. ?Georges-Louis Buffon The rhetoric of nature, often neglected in studies of Adorno, is central to an understanding of his views on a wide variety of concerns, from the figurative movement of literature to a theory of the political, and from philosophical issues to questions of ethics in a world after Auschwitz. In suggesting that we link Adorno's engagement with tropes of nature to larger questions of history and aesthetics, I argue that Adorno stages, rather than explains, concepts that would propose alternative historical and aesthetic models. His complex con structions of nature as natural history and natural beauty belong to concepts that are always already suppressed.1 The first task, then, is to lift and preserve I thank John Abromeit, Martin Jay, Robert Kaufman, Gerhard Richter, Eric Santner, and Chad Wellmon for providing substantive and useful feedback on earlier drafts of this article, which is based on a chapter of my dissertation. The dissertation is titled "The Language of Nature in The odor W. Adorno's Philosophical and Aesthetic Writings." 1. The structural model by which Adorno seeks to reveal the always already suppressed ele ment is most starkly laid out in his Negative Dialectics, in which he seeks to come to terms with the antagonisms of history and philosophy. For this reason, as the title suggests, he examines the antago nism that was suppressed or subjugated. Yet since any concept or term contains within it that which it seeks to suppress or negate, it is only by tarrying with the negative that its redemptive or explo sive potential can be found. Natural history instantiates such a particularity, which has been disre garded for the sake of the universal, of the world spirit, or of human history. And in this way, a New German Critique 97, Vol. 33, No. 1, Winter 2006 DOI 10.1215/0094033X-2005-009 ? 2006 by New German Critique, Inc. 159</page><page sequence="2">160 The Ethics of Animals the suppressed element, in this instance nature. But Adorno does not merely propose that we prefer natural history over human history, natural beauty to cultural beauty, or animality to humanity. Rather, he restores the focus on the dialectical tensions between these constructions and on what generates these tensions in the first place. Additionally, Adorno opens the door for a rethink ing of the ethical and political significance of these concepts. This essay con centrates on a significant part of this suppressed nature: the animal. Rhetorical figures and dialectical images of animals and animality tra verse the entire corpus of Adorno's writings. Animals are a trope not only in Adorno's "Notes on Kafka" (1953) and in the notes to Dialectic of Enlight enment (1944) but also in Minima Moralia (1951), in the reflections on meta physics and Auschwitz at the end of Negative Dialectics (1966), and in Aes thetic Theory (1970). While the trope of animals assumes different shades of meaning depending on its context within the trajectory of Adorno's oeuvre, it consistently highlights the inhumanity of humans. Decisive here is the affinity of animals with "the nonidentity of identity." Animals remind us that nature for Adorno is the condition of possibility not only for reading the self, humans, and culture but also for an unreadable other, alterity. Adorno's obsession with animals has not escaped his attentive readers. For example, in his recent biography of Adorno, Detlev Claussen recognizes the significance of animals for Adorno, stating that "solidarity with animals, expanded to solidarity with all living things, recalls the suppression of internal and external nature, recalls domination."2 Stefan Miiller-Doohm, too, lingers over how important animals were to Adorno, discussing a song, "The Return Home of the Mammoth with a Trunk," that Adorno composed in February 1941 about Max Horkheimer's return to New York: "What's driving there in the car and sticking out its long trunk? / it's a mammoth, it's a mammoth and it's driving home."3 And in "Bringing Nature Back In," Jay Bernstein argues that "Adorno's gamble, the gamble animating his late works, is that the imma nent critique and correction of the dualisms of idealism's concept of the con cept, as the philosophical apotheosis of identity thinking, will bring anthro reading of natural history affords an understanding of the alternative model of history that Adorno proposes. It proposes that one read history heeding not only the revealed (human history) but also the suppressed or subjugated (natural history). 2. Detlev Claussen, Theodor W.

In what follows, I scrutinize Adorno's rhetorical employment of animals by considering how it offers a critique of the Kantian account of practical reason;5 by examining how it seeks to diverge from fascist politics; and by placing it into relation with discourses on the animal by other think ers, such as Walter Benjamin, Sigmund Freud, Franz Kafka, H?l?ne Cixous, Jacques Derrida, and Emmanuel Levinas.6 4. Jay Bernstein, "Mastered by Nature: Abstraction, Independence, and the Simple Concept," in Adorno: Disenchantment and Ethics (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2001), 197. 5. Adorno was one of the most Kantian members of the Frankfurt School perhaps as a result of his early indoctrination when he was only fifteen years old to reading Kant's first critique with Siegfried Kracauer, a family friend fourteen years his senior. Adorno was Kantian not in the sense of blindly adhering to Kant's philosophy but rather in the sense of aspiring to understand the short comings ofthat philosophy's logic and how they impeded the realization of idealism's ideals. Thus, Adorno's critiques of Kant's logic are intended to strengthen its aspirations. That Kant remained central to Adorno's thinking is evidenced by the fact that Kant's philosophy was the focus of Adorno's major speculative works: Aesthetic Theory and Negative Dialectics. Additionally, Adorno also frequently taught courses on Kant: in 1951, a seminar on the Critique of Judgment; in 1954 and 1959, lecture courses on the Critique of Pure Reason, in which he laid bare the contradictions of Kant's philosophy and introduced Negative Dialectics; in 1955, a course on the Critique of Practi cal Reason; and in 1963, a lecture course titled Problems of Moral Philosophy, which sought to provide an account of Kant's moral theory. As becomes clear, Kant remained central to Adorno's thinking throughout his life. With this in mind, it is with, rather than against, Kant that Adorno critiques Kant's philosophy. 6. See also Robert Savage, 'Adorno's Family and Other Animals," Thesis Eleven, no. 78 (2004): 102-12. In his informative article Savage details Adorno's lifelong obsession with animals, which began with frequent childhood visits to the zoo. Adorno took particular delight in herbivores, such as hippopotamuses, rhinoceroses, and wombats. He constructs a private mythology for his imme diate family during his childhood and later for his closest friends. For example, Adorno addresses his mother as the "hippopotamus mare," his aunt Agathe as the "tigress," his father as a "wild boar," and later his wife, Grete, as "the giraffe." Adorno's interest in the herbivores and wombats remains with him into adulthood. Upon his return from exile, Adorno even writes the director of the Frankfurt zoo, Bernhard Grzimek, to request that wombats be reintroduced to the zoo's hold ings. He also offers to write in support of the director's campaign to have safari hunting outlawed, for although his support has nothing to do with the official duties of the Institute for Social Research, they are "much more aligned with the deeper impulse, that such an Institute obeys, if it wants to be right in its humane responsibilities" (quoted from Miiller-Doohm, Adorno, 525; translation my own). As Savage clearly points out here, Adorno believes the ethical treatment of animals and humans to be related.</page><page sequence="4">162 The Ethics of Animals Animality as Materiality While Adorno's trope of the animal is inscribed in a whole network of theo retical concerns, it plays its most crucial role in his reading of the politics of fascism. Writing in Negative Dialectics about Kant's account of practical reason and ethics and about Auschwitz, Adorno indicates that at the end of a long humanistic tradition, the individual stands confronted with the figure of animality. Adorno suggests that the individual is "left with no more than the morality for which Kantian ethics?which accords affection, not respect to animals?can muster only disdain: to try to live so that one may believe him self to have been a good animal."7 In other words, according to Adorno, the very animal that Kantian ethics regards with such disdain should not be the source of derision but instead the guide to morality.8 Kant believes that the difference between animal and human is human reason, or rather the human potential to actualize reason and thus ultimately to reason. Adorno, however, argues that the animal describes the limits of the human, functioning as the alterity of animality and as the specter of a terri fying inhumanity. The relevance of Adorno's arguments was underscored when Derrida called attention to them in his acceptance speech upon receipt of the city of Frankfurt's Adorno Prize in 2001. Quoting the following passage from Adorno, Derrida criticized Kant for his views on the domination of nature and his denigration of animals: "The domination of nature is directed against animals," since "nothing is more hated by the Kantian than the resemblance to animals of humans."9 Derrida continues, quoting Adorno, who draws a parallel between the treatment of animals in Kantian idealism and of Jews by fascists in Nazi Germany: "The animals play virtually the same role for the 7.

That is, the Holocaust is about the annihilation of the Jews, but it is also about the annihilation of a phantasmagoric other. In other words, the treatment of Jews by fascist Nazi Germany and the role of ani mals in the idealist system both pinpoint a phantasmagoric relationship to the other. This phantasmagoric other bespeaks the fears and fantasies of the Nazi ideology and of idealist philosophy. What Adorno's system seeks to reveal are the ideals of idealism that were not realized and to pinpoint pre cisely what prevented them from being realized or, worse, allowed them to turn into their opposite. For this reason, in seeking to work through the past, Adorno lingers over the role of animals in Kant's philosophy. In another text Derrida, a reader of the alterity of animals and of Adorno's philosophy, discusses what an ethics founded not on human logic but on the animal would change and permit. Quoting Jeremy Bentham, Derrida asks in L'animal autobiographique: "Can animals suffer?"11 Previously, philosophers had tried to determine whether animals could think or use language. Derrida refers to Aristotle, Ren? Descartes, and Martin Heidegger in this lineage. As Derrida points out, Bentham's reformulation of the question allows a consid eration of pity and of compassion. Suffering, as Derrida states, asks for com passion and therefore positions animals as equal to humans. In this way, Bent ham's question?can animals suffer??differs radically from the position to which animals, in Adorno's reading, were relegated by Kant's idealism, which positions the animal as radical other to the human. In Dialectic of Enlightenment Horkheimer and Adorno describe how nature and animals are tied to their abilities to articulate the reason of man. In a section titled "Man and Animal" Horkheimer and Adorno elaborate how this structure works: "The idea of man in European history is expressed in the way in which he is distinguished from the animal. Animal irrationality 10. Derrida, Fichus, 55-56.

In "Concept of Enlightenment," Horkheimer and Adorno elaborate on how man's domination of nature and animals forms part of the larger ideology of domination: "The essence of enlightenment is the alternative whose ineradicability is that of domination. Men have always had to choose between their subjection to nature and the subjection of nature to self."13 Outlining the history of this distinction between man and animal, Adorno explains, "To be condemned to an animal body was to be damned."14 Acknowledging the animal and animality is integral for Horkheimer and Adorno's dialectical materialism and its negatively dialectical project. At the outset of the third section of Negative Dialectics, Adorno argues that perhaps the only way for metaphysics to win is by passing over into material ism: "The enervation that metaphysics might win only by discarding itself applies to such other truth. It is not the last among the motivations for the pas sage to materialism."15 Adorno invokes materialism, for example, in the form of nature or animals, to place it into a dialectical tension with metaphysics. To be sure, he does not argue for assimilation to materialism, for this would belie the very structure of dialectics itself, and especially of a reactive dia lectics. Instead, Adorno dwells on materialism to critique the Enlightenment from within. For, as Adorno puts it, "its [dialectics'] objective goal is to break out of the context from within. . .. [It] lies in the disposition of negative dia lectics that it will not come to rest in itself, as if it were total; this is its form of hope."16 The hope resides in that which inhabits the negative dialectic: 12.

"However void every trace of otherness in it [this world]," Adorno tells us, "the Being is, in the breaks that punish the lies of [a cohe sive] identity, still pervaded by the always again broken pledges of that other ness. All happiness is but a fragment of the entire happiness, which denies itself to humankind and which humankind denies itself."17 In other words, the pledge of otherness is a promise of happiness, which man denies to him self by suppressing his animal otherness. Precisely "the breaks that belie iden tity" bespeak dialectical tension between identity and its suppressed other, and point to the nonidentity of identity. Pinpointing these breaks and the dialecti cal tension that resides within them allows for change. Adorno's understand ing of the animal and animality therefore reveals the ruptures that belie cohe sive identities and points to his theory of the nonidentity of identity, that each entity contains its opposite within itself and is thus constituted, by this tension of identity and nonidentity. Writing about animals, Adorno's close friend Benjamin, to whose works Adorno is deeply indebted,18 develops a similar argument in his 1934 essay "Franz Kafka." Turning Kantian practical reason on its head or underscoring the dialectic's negativity, Benjamin states, "This much is certain: of all Kafka's creatures, the animals have the greatest opportunity for reflection."19 Thus, Benjamin, too, locates the capacity for reflection in animals. Lingering over this philosophical premise, Adorno compares Benjamin's Kafka piece with his own Kierkegaard book: "Please do not take it as presumptuous if I begin by saying that I was never so completely conscious of our central philosophi cal agreement as here."20 Adorno acknowledges the affinity between his work and Benjamin's: both emphasize the moment when the animal appears and articulates man's suppression of his animal self. In this way, the truth emerges precisely at that moment when the human slides into the animal, when both man and animal are presenced and stand in a dialectical tension to one another. The challenge is to maintain a productive balance between them. 17. NDe, 404; M), 396.

For example, in Dialectic of Enlighten ment he invokes the animal as it appears in Homer's Odyssey. In the chapter "Odysseus or Myth and Enlightenment" Horkheimer and Adorno discuss how "Circe tempts Odysseus' men to give themselves up to instinct," stating that "the animal form of the tempted men has always been connected with a rever sion to basic impulse."21 Here, by turning Homer's men into swine, Circe "lib erates at the same time the repressed nature in them," which Adorno goes on to define as sexual desire.22 But if the historical gaze is turned the other way, the animal becomes visible in our own discourses as well. For instance, Adorno's emphasis on the repressed animal desire in humans links his work to that of Gilles Deleuze and F?lix Guattari, the French philosophers and readers of the animals in Kafka.23 While Adorno argues that animality functions as an index of what reason has repressed, Deleuze and Guattari develop a psychoanalytic reading of the human's encounter with the animal within, which, in their study of Kafka, they refer to as the "becoming animal" of the human. In fact, this quality leads Deleuze and Guattari to argue that Kafka's stories "are essen tially animalistic even though there aren't animals in all the stories."24 Thus, the term becoming animal encompasses both the stories with animals in them as well as those without. By calling them animalistic, instead of animal, stories, Deleuze and Guattari focus on the animality of the human in the stories (rather than the animal). For both Adorno and Deleuze and Guattari, Kafka's animal parables articulate the moment when humans are, and are not, themselves, when they are experiencing that part of themselves that is animal. Adorno's own contemporary Benjamin seeks to lay out what is at stake in the animals that appear in Kafka's tales in his essay "Franz Kafka." Ben jamin presents the origins of Kafka's preoccupations: "To Kafka, the world of his ancestors was as unfathomable as the world of realities was important for him, and we may be sure that, like the totem poles of primitive peoples, the world of ancestors took him down to the animals."25 That is, for Kafka, 21.

Benjamin, "Franz Kafka," 132.</page><page sequence="9">Christina Gerhardt 167 the animal expresses the familial, whereas previously totem poles expressed the familial. Benjamin here draws directly on Freud's theory of animism and of totems, expressed in Totem and Taboo, which Horkheimer and Adorno dis cuss at the outset of Dialectic of Enlightenment (DoE, 11; DdA, 27) and Adorno discusses in Aesthetic Theory.26 In the opening sections of Totem and Taboo Freud explains his theory of a totem: "What is a totem? It is as a rule an ani mal ... which stands in a peculiar relation to the whole clan. In the first place, the totem is the common ancestor of the clan.... The totem is the basis of all his social obligations. ... In almost every place where we find totems we also find a law against persons of the same totem having sexual relations with one another and consequently against their marrying."27 According to Freud, the totem forbids intermarriage and incest. Later on, Freud provides a genealogy of man's relationship to animism, locating it first in the actual creatures, then in totem poles, later in religion, and lastly in man himself, as he transfers his belief in Allmacht (omnipotence) to himself, the all-powerful being with the capacity to reason. As Freud puts it in Totem and Taboo, "At the animistic stage men ascribe omnipotence to themselves. At the religious stage they transfer it to the gods.... But in men's faith in the power of the human mind, which takes into account the laws of reality, some of the primitive belief in omnipotence lives on."28 In other words, in Freud's worldview, the taboo against incest expresses itself in primitive societies in the animal totem. Since this totem no longer exists in modern society, and since the omnipotence has been transferred to man, the animism has been transferred to man and needs constantly to be suppressed. These suppressed incestuous desires, Freud argues, express themselves in the transference of wishes onto animals. He mentions two cases to illustrate this.29 First, in his "Analysis of a Phobia in a Five-Year Old Boy" (1909), Freud examines a boy who has a phobia of horses and fears more specifically that a horse will come into the room and bite him; a punish ing fear, the boy says, for his wish that the horse fall down and die.30 The boy's feelings are actually directed toward his father, Freud argues, but transferred to 26.

The second example draws on "The Case of Little Arpad" as reported by the psychoanalyst Sandor Ferenczi, in which Arpad fixates exclusively on chickens and other feathered creatures, which he alternately hates and pretends to slaughter, and then loves. Arpad makes sure that his play is not misunder stood, frequently saying, "My father is the cock."31 Neurosis, according to Freud, expresses a sublated incestuous desire, or the animalistic in the human that is subjugated. And as Benjamin reminds us, "Kafka is not the only writer for whom animals are the receptacles of the repressed incestual desire. In Tieck's story 'Fair Eckbert,' the forgotten name of a little dog, Strohmi, stands for a mys terious guilt." "Strohmi" is etymologically related to the German word Strom, which means "river," and to the river Lethe, the river of forgetfulness. But what is this forgotten guilt to which Benjamin calls our attention? As we learn at the end of "Fair Eckbert," the guilt is over incest. And as Benjamin states, "One can understand, then, that Kafka did not tire of picking up the forgotten from animals. They are not the goal, to be sure, but one cannot do without them."32 In other words, one cannot do without animals, as Kafka, too, affirms in his animal stories, since as totems animals at once express and suppress these incestuous desires. As Adorno himself says of Kafka in Minima Moralia, "Heading the list is the proscription of erotic pathos, evinced ... by the col lective ban on sexuality in Kafka's works."33 Arguing a similar point, Deleuze and Guattari claim that in Kafka's "Metamorphosis," "becoming animal" involves a desire for what the wife and the parents should not see: "What Kafka does in his room is to become animal and this is the essential object of the stories. The first sort of creation is the metamorphosis. A wife's eyes shouldn't see that above all else, nor should the eyes of a father or mother. We should say that for Kafka, the animal essence is the way out, the line of escape, even if it takes place in place, or in a cage."34 The desire to which animals refer here involves Gregor Samsa's incestuous desire for his sister, Grete. 31.

Instead of human dignity, the supreme bourgeois concept, there emerges in him the salutary recollection of the similarity between man and animal, an idea upon which a whole group of his narratives thrives."36 In this way, Adorno brings the argument about animals that appears in the first two chapters of Dialec tic of Enlightenment into conversation with Kafka's writings. Indeed, many of Kafka's narratives do thrive upon the similarity between man and animal: Gregor Samsa appears as a giant insect in "The Metamorphosis"; a former ape presents "A Report to an Academy"; a dog composes "Investigations of a Dog"; and a mouse sings in "Josephine, the Singer or the Mouse Folk."37 But in Adorno's thinking, Kafka's tales of animals actually tell us more about the animality of humans than they do about animals. On the Animality of Humans The suppressed animality of humans, Adorno argues, is a symptom of mod ern society; its antidote is sympathy with the suffering of animals, something Adorno and Horkheimer borrowed from Arthur Schopenhauer, as Adorno's Lectures on Moral Philosophy indicates. In these lectures, delivered in 1963, Adorno takes up Kant's Groundwork of the Metaphysic of Morals and the Critique of Practical Reason, emphasizing the limits of moral philosophy.

Adorno stated that his study of moral philosophy, together with Negative Dia lectics and the incomplete Aesthetic Theory, was to "represent what I have to throw into the scale."38 Critiquing "the idea of reason as an ultimate end of mankind,"39 Adorno cites Schopenhauer and specifically his discussion of ani mals: "In his day Schopenhauer held it to be the particular merit of his own moral philosophy that it also included a view of our treatment of animals, com passion for animals, and this has often been regarded as the cranky idea of a private individual of independent means. My own view is that a tremendous amount can be learnt from such crankiness."40 In Adorno's eyes, what has often been dismissed as mere crankiness actually provides the grounds for a radi cally different relationship between humans and animals in which animals are not mere things but rather beings worthy of compassion. Adorno's observations are based on Schopenhauer's On the Basis of Morality, in which Schopenhauer criticizes Kant's account of reason for how it deems animals not as equals worthy of our compassion but rather as crea tures that allow us to exercise our compassion for other humans.41 As Scho penhauer points out, Kant, in paragraph 17 of The Metaphysical Principles of Virtue, states that "cruelty to animals is contrary to man's duty to himself, because it deadens in him the feeling of sympathy for their sufferings, and thus a natural tendency that is very useful to morality in relation to other human beings is weakened."42 Schopenhauer argues, "Thus only for practice are we to have sympathy for animals. ... I regard such propositions as revolting and abominable."43 To Schopenhauer, they are indications of the animality of humans, of the limits of their capacity to reason. Adorno agrees: 38.

For a longer study of Schopenhauer, examining his criticism not only of Kant's</page><page sequence="13">Christina Gerhardt 171 I believe that Schopenhauer probably suspected that the establishment of total rationality as the supreme objective principle of mankind might well spell the continuation of that blind domination of nature whose most obvious and tangible expression was to be found in the exploitation and maltreatment of animals. He thereby pointed to the weak point in the transition from sub jective reason concerned with self-preservation to the supreme moral prin ciple, which has no room for animals and our treatment of animals. If this is true, we can see Schopenhauer's eccentricity as a sign of great insight.44 What matters to Adorno is "changing the circumstances that give rise to the need for it [the idea of compassion]."45 As he tells us further on in his lectures, "The pity you express for someone always contains an element of injustice towards that person; he experiences not just our pity but also the impotence and the specious character of the compassionate act."46 For pity or compassion to work, one must, as Adorno puts it, change the hierarchical structure, which sets rational humans over animals and which allows only pity, to one that allows com-passion or em-pathy (feeling with). The only way that reason can sustain itself in its current structure is by acknowledging absurdity, as Adorno points out on numerous occasions, most notably in aphorism 128 in Minima Moralia, which explores the moral of a childhood song about two rabbits that he remembers (MMe, 199-200; MM, 226-28). The song, "Between the Mountain and the Deep, Deep Vale," tells a tale "about two rabbits, who, regaling themselves on the grass, were shot down by the hunter, and, on realizing they were still alive, made off in haste."47 Adorno but also of Hegel's philosophy, particularly vis-?-vis natural history, see Alfred Schmidt, Idee und Weltwille: Schopenhauer als Kritiker Hegels (Munich: Hanser, 1988), esp. 21-27. 44.

Adorno discusses the value of the absurd in Samuel Beckett, Kafka, and others in various works. The lesson of absurdity would encourage one in this song "to follow the example of the two rabbits when the shot comes, fall down giddily, half-dead with fright, collect one's wits and then, if one still has breath, show a clean pair of heels."49 For "the capacity for fear and for happiness," Adorno continues, "are the same, the unrestricted openness to experience amounting to self-abandonment in which the van quished rediscovers himself. What would happiness be that was not measured by the immeasurable grief at what is? For the course of the world is awry."50 As Alexander Garc?a-D?ttmann points out in his introduction to a careful study of this aphorism, "Being right or proving to be in the right is not an ethical cate gory." Taking up this concept of the absurd again, Garc?a-D?ttmann continues, "If, however, the meticulous search for the better argument amounts to a ratio nal persistence and implementation that places the one in the right, the other in the wrong, then the concept of a discourse ethics reveals itself to be absurd."51 Minima Moralia: Reflexionen aus dem besch?digten Leben might be read as "Reflections on Damaged Life," in the sense of emerging out of a damaged life. For this reason, perhaps Adorno's aphorism 128, titled "Regressions," tells a moral less about how to live the good life and more about how the absurd allows one to survive the irrationality of a world gone awry. Cixous?like Adorno, a great thinker of animals52?also addresses instances where figures of animals bring to light absurdity, the animality of 48. MMe, 200; MM, 228.

In her autobiographical story, "Stigmata, or Job the Dog," Cixous tells the tale of the dog, Fips, she had as a young child.53 More specifically, she tells how Fips experienced borders created by nation states, colonization, race, class, and religious beliefs, which are incomprehen sible to the animal. The story takes place in Algiers, Algeria, in an Arab neigh borhood, that is, not in the part of town in which most of the French colonizers resided. Her father was a physician and humanitarian, who thus chose to live in a somewhat destitute neighborhood so that he could offer his services to the area's inhabitants. The Arabs, Cixous tells us, read her family as French, that is, as colonizers, despite her father's commitment to helping them. For her, this reading compounds the fact that her family had just, as she puts it, "re-become" French: "As Jews during the war we were thrown out of French nationality, we became nothing" (JD, 183). As French Jews and as humanitarians she and her family did not really identify with the French or with the French colonizers in Algeria. Additionally, she tells us that her family was originally Spanish on her father's side and German on her mother's side. "But the history of nationalities had in turn made us French, de-French and re-French, and we were Jewish. Yet we did not identify with any nationality. For the Arabs this jewfrenchness was a double original sin" (JD, 183). In other words, Cixous's identity destabilizes a whole range of borders?ones created by colonization, wars, and nation-states, and ones suggesting differences of nationality, race, class, and religion. Cixous, however, shows us how slippery these borders are, since as a Jew she sometimes adhered to more than one category or none, or slipped from one to the next and back. Or as humanitarians, her family overstepped and overlooked boundaries determined by race and nationality and class to emphasize humanitarian aid for well-being and health instead. Cixous's dog, Fips, bears the brunt of these confusing border crossings. As long as her father is alive, the neighborhood tolerates her family's presence. As soon as he dies, there is discord. Neighboring residents begin to pelt her family's house with rocks: "It was then that from outside the garden the hunt was unleashed against us. Our Arab neighbors encircled us in a daily siege." Fips was kept on a chain outside the house. "Ten times a day," Cixous tells us, "there rained on the family a hail of stones. In no time, the volleys that wounded our spirit made Fips into a mad dog" (JD, 189). As a result of the daily barrage, Fips began to lose his patience, not understanding the religious, political, colo nial sources of these tensions: 53. H?l?ne Cixous, "Stigmata, or Job the Dog," in Stigmata, 181-94. Hereafter cited as JD.</page><page sequence="16">774 The Ethics of Animals Fips, you wanted so much to cross, all your forms outstretched every day to try to pass through, to shatter the walls, you wanted to break the prisons, lacerate the skins, your soul called for deliverance, never have I seen a being in such furious rebellion against the ancient fates that fix our bounds right from birth, the policies, the stupidity, les b?tises that have debasing power over every creature who goes beyond. ... He stands up to the attack ing worlds. (JD, 184-85) Fips understands neither the walls and the barriers nor the laws that cre ate them, but he wants to break through and create another world. In this way, Cixous argues, animals suggest a different relationship to the world: they lack the rational knowledge of categories that humans have created and vehemently defend. "A dog does not understand our bad complications," Cixous tells us. And she goes on, "I should have spoken to him. I should have, if I had been able to understand him but I thought him perhaps incapable of understanding for I was then not capable of understanding the profound animal humanity" (JD, 190). In other words, what Cixous realizes retrospectively is that a dog? not understanding the rigid and somewhat arbitrary structures of humans and the consequent animality of humans?inversely possesses, nonetheless or perhaps precisely because of this, a profound animal humanity. The lesson that Adorno had picked up on from Schopenhauer?to have compassion for animals?and the sort of compassion that Cixous has for Fips yield up the insight that animals, rather than serving as the antithesis to human reason, may be the source of a profound humanity, an "animal humanity." On the Humanity of Animals Levinas, too, believes that animals possess a vast sense of this so-called animal humanity, and, like Adorno, he places hope precisely in the animal. Levinas's essay "The Name of a Dog, or Natural Rights" tells of his time as a Jewish concentration camp inmate in Nazi Germany. The gaze of humans, he states, "stripped us of our human skin. We were subhuman, a gang of apes.... How to deliver a message about one's humanity which, from behind the bars of quo tation marks, will come across as anything other than the language of pri mates." The gaze of his fellow humans, he argues, not only dehumanized him but also turned him into a subhuman, an animal, one among a gang of apes. Ironically, the arrival of a dog had the inverse effect: "For a few short weeks, before the sentinels chased him away, a wandering dog entered our lives. .. . We called him Bobby, an exotic name, as one does with a cherished dog. He would appear at morning assembly and was waiting for us as we returned,</page><page sequence="17">Christina Gerhardt 175 jumping and barking in delight. For him, there was no doubt that we were men." Paradoxically, it is in the dog's presence, just outside the gates of the concentration camp, that the humanness of the prisoners, reduced as they were to an abject state of animality, was salvaged. "This dog," Levinas states, somewhat quixotically, "was the last Kantian in Nazi Germany."54 Since Kant had laid out that the human ability to reason set men apart from animals, Levinas's statement seems to be a paradox: how can a dog be the last Kantian in Nazi Germany? One way to answer this question is to discern what it would mean to be the last Kantian, or to have Kantian ethics. As early as 1785, in his Ground work of the Metaphysics of Morals, Kant seeks to establish a basis for moral philosophy through the categorical imperative: "Act only according to that maxim through which you can at the same time will that it should become a universal law." The concepts and moral philosophy that Kant lays out first in the Groundwork and then in Critique of Pure Reason and Critique of Practi cal Reason form the basis of what later became known as Kantian ethics. According to Kant's philosophy, one could read the behavior of Bobby, the dog, as both thwarting and preserving Kantian ethics in that he restores or preserves the humanity of Levinas and the others imprisoned in the camp. That is, he acts in a way that preserves the Kantian categorical imperative. Yet the categorical imperative, and later moral law, is a fact of reason. And if reason is that which separates human from animal, the dog, by being the agent, could be read as thwarting Kantian reason.55 Thus, Levinas's observa tion that "this dog was the last Kantian in Nazi Germany" could be read as an instance in which Kantian morality is simultaneously thwarted and pre served. Yet in Levinas's tale, the preservation of Kantian ethics hinges on the figure of the dog, which has to be taken into account. For Levinas turns Kan tian ethics on its head, by arguing that the possibility of acting ethically is rooted in a condition of passivity, in which I am compelled to respond to a command from an other with whom I find myself in a "face-to-face" relation ship. This condition of responsibility in the face-to-face is something that Levi nas regards as prior to any act of cognition, to any conscious act of which I could be the author. Responsibility is thus conceived as a condition in which 54. Emmanuel Levinas, "The Name of a Dog, or Natural Rights," in Difficult Freedom: Essays on Judaism, trans. Sean Hand (Baltimore, MD: Johns Hopkins University Press, 1990), 152-53. Translations modified. 55. I thank Chad Wellmon, although our readings may differ, for pushing me further on my argument about the dog as guarantor of Kantian ethics.</page><page sequence="18">176 The Ethics of Animals I find myself responding to an unconditional demand made upon me. Addition ally, Levinas's concept of alterity plays a vital role in his conception of ethics. For Levinas, however, who wrote from a distinctly postwar and post-Holocaust vantage point, the project of breaking with totalization and a thinking of "the same" in favor of a thinking of "alterity" is aimed at addressing the legacy of political-historical totalitarianism as well as of philosophy. And when Levinas is telling about his experiences in Nazi camps, precisely this other appears in the form of Bobby the dog. Thus, one could seek, however, to understand Levinas's puzzling state ment that "this dog was the last Kantian in Nazi Germany" by pursuing another logic: if, as Adorno argues in his essay on Kafka, the animals in Kafka's short stories provide "the trial run of a model of dehumanization," animals could be understood as articulating the limits of humanity or of humanity's dehu manization.56 In other words, the dog that Levinas encounters could be read as the last Kantian. For as Adorno says in the final section of Negative Dialectics, which is, among other things, a meditation on Auschwitz, "Hitler has imposed a new categorical imperative on the humans in their stance of unfreedom: to arrange their thoughts and actions so that Auschwitz will not repeat itself, so that nothing similar will happen."57 After Auschwitz and after Hitler, Adorno states one must reconsider not only actions but also thoughts, so that Ausch witz will not be repeated. Adorno sets up this imperative before us, explicitly referencing Kant's categorical imperative. It is the project of Horkheimer and Adorno's Dialectic of Enlightenment to tease out the relationship between Enlightenment-era thinking, by which they mean not only Kant or the Kantian Enlightenment but also the fascist era. To be sure, neither Horkheimer nor Adorno argues that the Enlightenment bears sole responsibility for produc ing the Holocaust. As they state in the first sentence of Dialectic of Enlighten ment, "Enlightenment" should be understood "in the widest sense of advanc ing thought."58 Horkheimer and Adorno do, however, point out how particular aspects of Enlightenment philosophy permit a thinking that made what ensued possible. For example, a logic that suppresses some or instrumentalizes oth ers, creates, according to Horkheimer and Adorno, a condition of possibility for the Holocaust. It is the hierarchy, by which humans are deemed superior by 56. NK, 255; AK, 266-67. "Anstelle des Eingedenkens ans Menschliche die Probe aufs Exem pel der Entmenschlichung." 57. NDe, 365; ND, 358.

"Im umfassendsten Sinn fortschreitenden Denkens."</page><page sequence="19">Christina Gerhardt 177 dint of their ability to reason, and animals are deemed inferior because of their inability to reason, that also concomitantly sets up a diametrically opposed relationship between the rational and the irrational, one that must be enforced at all costs. The need to suppress any irrationality or any animal desires is what? precisely because of the stringent binary that is impossible to maintain?rears its head and becomes unmanageable or fascistic. The fear of the irrational, of the other within oneself, became transferred to the other, where one sought to eradicate it by eradication of the other. As Horkheimer and Adorno argue in Dialectic of Enlightenment, it is the attempt to erase the dialectical tension, to act as though it had been superseded, that had such unenlightened conse quences. And it is this negative and suppressed aspect of the dialectic, be it natural history or animals, over which Adorno lingers in Negative Dialectics and elsewhere. What is very much in keeping with Adorno's philosophy is that the sen tence rests on a dialectical tension put into play through the figure of the dog. The dog cannot possibly be a Kantian, much less the last Kantian; the dog is the last Kantian. In this way, by mustering compassion and respect for the animal as Adorno and Cixous had proposed earlier, rather than just affection as Kant had done, a last chance to redeem the ideals of Kantian ethics pre sents itself. The Alterity of the Animal Thus, while animals provide, as Adorno puts it when talking about the ani mals in Kafka's short stories, "the trial run of a model of dehumanization," they also inversely suggest a so-called humanizing potential.59 Adorno ques tioned the viability of Kantian ethics in the wake of the Holocaust, arguing that at the end of a long humanistic tradition, the individual stood confronted with the figure of animality. This animality is a vestige of the repressed, of the animalism that Freud argued had been allowed expression through the totem and that, when not allowed expression in modern society, he explained, showed up in repressed incestuous desires, what Deleuze and Guattari in discussing Kafka's animal tales called "becoming animal." Animality in humans could be altered only if the structure in which they were embedded as other to humans were changed. That is, following Schopenhauer, Adorno, like Derrida or Cix ous, proposed that one have compassion for animals or for otherness. Adorno's model, like that of Levinas, proposes a recognition of alterity, of the other, in this case, the animal. Thus, a different relationship to animals allows one to 59. NK, 255; AK, 266-67. "Die Probe aufs Exempel der Entmenschlichung."</page><page sequence="20">178 The Ethics of Animals avoid the pitfalls of idealism while realizing the ideals of idealism or of a radically different relationship to the other. It is in this dialectical sense that Adorno's use and discussion of animals must be understood. For the discourse about the other is never merely about the other but also about the fears and aspirations of the self. Allowing a recognition rather than a suppression of the animality within allows a recognition of the humanity, too. This is the com plex dialectical meaning and revision that lies behind Levinas's dog, who may indeed have been the last Kantian in Nazi Germany.</page></plain_text>
