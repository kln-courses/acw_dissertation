<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE DESIGN AND MYTH IN EURIPIDES' ION BY CHRISTIAN WOLFF 'AA&amp; LE-VTOL, 87 OS., or) P(X8LWS EVP7G)ELSt ~AAo tL TE 7TOV Eo' 7Tp(TTELv, EXlV TO E,7rTLUr)LqoVWS. aTt/LaG,77s. Plato Charmides 173d6f TON has not the bitterness of an Electra or Hecuba, nor the force of a IMedea or Bacchae. It seems more like a romance. And, like Helen, Iphigenia among the Taurians and Orestes, it has no catastrophe. Disaster is averted, though very narrowly. If one thinks of it as a kind of romance, then a certain leisurely digressiveness - descriptions, talk of myths, of political life in Athens - is not inappropriate, and a number of critics, complaining of distracting irrelevancies, might be fairly answered. Yet the play is also genuinely serious, to which at least its near catastrophe can testify; it must somehow qualify as a tragedy. To try to show wherein Ion's seriousness lies is the object of this essay. But to do so we shall have to account further for the play's seeming digressions, the role of Athens in it, and the way the myth is used. And for that purpose we begin with its formal design, its plot. I Hermes opens the play; Athena appears at its conclusion. Gods frame its action, suggesting their providential care yet also underlining the helplessness of human beings acting within the limited spheres of their knowledge and on the impulses of their feelings. Humans have to be protected from themselves. The prologue spoken by Hermes recounts the past and forecasts the outlines of the plot to come: that Apollo's oracle will give the god's child by a human mother to her human husband Xuthus (69f), that Creusa will know her lost son when he comes to her house (7If), and that Apollo's union with her will be kept secret as Ion comes into his inheritance (73). Yet this forecast omits the principal substance of the play; its main action will originate in human impulses and feelings. Xuthus thinks it better to hide from his wife the son that the god has 6*</page><page sequence="2">170 Christian Wolff given him. Yet she finds the deception out and in her outrage plots to kill Ion, forcing the god's hand. Recognition takes place in Delphi, not Athens, and what the god had intended to keep hidden is revealed. The prologue gives only a partial and - an unusual feature - an inaccurate forecast. Even a god's foresight, even Apollo's, who is said to prophesy "the things that are and that will be" (7), seems to be limited. We are, after all, left with doubts about the god's reliability. And his limitations are brought to light precisely by the force of human feelings. Divine providence, evident though it finally is, is only at the edges, so to speak, in the past and future, of human experience. That Hermes should speak the prologue keeps Apollo, whom we might have expected, at a certain distance - which will be maintained through- out the play. Athena, in turn, will speak for him at the end because he "does not think it fitting to appear lest he incur public blame for what is in the past" (i557f)-1 Hermes, on the other hand, is a more familiar god, a mediator between gods and men. He is also sometimes a guide out of dangerous or remote places. In Helen it is Hermes who brings the heroine to Egypt, saving her from the havoc at Troy and the loss of her virtue (Hel. 44, 670, 9I0), and it is he who promises that she will return home (57). It was also Hermes who came to say that Odysseus would have to leave Calypso's island, "the navel of the sea" (Odyssey 1.50). It was Hermes, he himself now tells us, who brought the infant Ion to Delphi, having helped to save him from death at his exposure (37ff). And now he has come to find him once more, a youth grown up, at the "navel of the earth" (5, 223), and to introduce the action that will bring Ion back to Athens and his inheritance.2 The appearance of Hermes, then, is the first of a series of repetitions, and so establishes the principal means of the play's construction. The story of Creusa's unwilling union with Apollo, her secret giving birth, and the child's exposure - in the same cave in which the union took place (I7f) - is repeated six times. The past is continually kept before us, while each telling of the story, always in a somewhat different mode and context, marks successive turns of the plot. For all its surface action, intrigues and violent complications, this plot turns on revelations of the truth about the past, on knowledge and recognitions (recalling, in this respect, the story of another foundling, Oedipus). After Hermes' detached expository account in the prologue (8-27), Creusa tells her own story, or rather, only as much of it as she knows, and disguises her part in it by claiming to speak for a friend (338ff). She tells it to Ion, its other human protagonist, in stychomythic ex-</page><page sequence="3">The Design and Myth in Euripides' Ion 171 change, neither of course knowing his true relation to the other, though the boy notices how close the story is to his own (36of, cf. 354). The exchange reveals an unconscious sympathy between the two (cf. 307, 312, 320), while underlining the lack of knowledge which separates them. A brief retelling follows by the chorus who evoke the mythical coloring of the story's setting, Athens' Steep Rocks and the cave of Pan (492-506). They too are in ignorance, unaware that their mistress is the subject of their song. Next, at the center of the play, in the middle of the third of five episodes, Creusa tells her story once again (88Iff). But now she speaks openly - or rather sings, for it is a lyric monologue, an aria, which carries the rush of her feelings. The story is given in its fullest detail, an intimate revelation and re-evocation of the ex- perience of its human participant. At this dramatic crux of the plot an expression of the greatest intensity of feeling coincides with the greatest ignorance of circumstances. Revealing her innermost experi- ence, Creusa is in the deepest obscurity about its actual ramifications. Her despair is occasioned by wrongly thinking her child dead and her sense of betrayal by supposing Apollo had abandoned it and has now given, not her, but Xuthus another. Her revelation is repeated in an exchange with her old manservant (936ff) as the sense of having been wronged is turned outward into a plan for revenge, a plot on the seeming intruder's - Ion's - life. Finally, at the recognition of mother and son, when the story nears its conclusion, it is told once more (i479ff). The human actors in it have identified one another. The loss it re- counted is made good. And yet at this point, with a shift from the interplay of knowledge and ignorance to that of doubt and belief, Ion finds that he cannot wholly accept the story. Though once having been convinced that Apollo might have ravished a woman (339ff, 355), he now rejects the possibility and refuses to believe that the god could have deceived (i523ff, i537ff). Athena must appear to persuade Ion, com- plete the story and give it her authority. The retelling of a story out of the past marks the stages of its fulfill- ment in the present - the actual plot that we witness. This latter too, then, is partly made out of a repetition of elements of the oft-told tale. Hermes who first saved Ion's life is once again present as Ion finds a new life. Ion's extraordinary survival with a god's help at his birth recalls his mother's miraculous survival as the only child of Erechtheus (277ff; cf. 280 and 31). Ion's birth is repeated symbolically in the action of the play. He is given a name for the first time (81, 661, 8ooff). A birthday feast is arranged for him (651ff). He learns who his parents are, and he is assured of his inheritance. " Having died " and</page><page sequence="4">172 Christian Wolff seeming "no more dead" (I444), he is born again to a new life.3 And Ion's second birth is accompanied by a violence of despair as his first birth, preceded by the violence of desire (cf. ii), is attended by the violence implicit in fear. Creusa plots to kill Ion, in the course of the play's action, at the celebration of his birthday, and so un- wittingly repeats the past. She had left her nameless child - nameless as the Ion against whom she plots is anonymous - to die (cf. 18, 27), principally out of fear and despair (cf. 898, 1497; yet contrast 965). But just as the god did not let the infant Ion die, so chance - or provi- dence - causes Creusa's attempted poisoning to fail (II87ff). Ion's own actions, his violent intentions against Xuthus (524f) and Creusa (1261ff),4 have of course no correspondence in the past, yet they suggest in part his family past, his father. Ion's ultimately harmless violence parallels Apollo's original violence to Creusa, a violence mixed with love and fortunate in issue. And Ion's first appearance, it has been pointed out, a handsome youth, wearing fillets (522) and carrying a bow (io8, 158), would recall the figure of Apollo.5 The setting in which he appears, further, the splendid morning scene of Delphi, is like a counter- part of the beautiful landscape in which Apollo appeared to Creusa (887ff). The play's action is also made up of formal structural repetitions. Two recognition scenes, a deceptive one between Ion and his supposed father Xuthus and the true one between Ion and his mother, are its focal points. Two consultations of Apollo's oracle initiate it, Xuthus' about progeny and Creusa's more private inquiry about the fate of her lost son. And two attempted killings, Creusa's of her son and Ion's of his mother, mark its dramatic climaxes.6 Thus far one might say that the effect of these repetitions and doublings out of the past is to give the play a specifically mythical atmosphere, a dream-like quality and a sense of ddjat vu; doublings are one of the most characteristic features of mythical stories.7 Euripides appears to be making a particular effort to evoke a sense of legend and myth. Thus the play also includes an unusually high number of passing references to myths not directly affecting its action. And, of course, the outlines of its story - about a foundling, child of a god, who after an obscure youth and apparent death is revealed as the eponymous hero of a great people - include some of the most common archetypal features of myths. But a certain nostalgia informs this treatment of myths seemingly for their own sake. As the play moves out of a marvelous past to complete its story in a more ambiguous present, its purpose is shown to be more than the re-creation of a legendary mood. The</page><page sequence="5">The Design and Myth in Euripides' Ion 173 very time of its composition, in the latter years of the fifth century,8 would indicate as much. One further repetition may serve as demonstra- tion: Ion's double parentage. He has two fathers, one divine and in- visible, the other human and present. The one, we are assured, is the true father, the other, we see, is only putative, only in the " fond illusion " that he is father (I602). (Ion's other mother is Apollo's priestess, the Pythia; cf. 321, 1324.) And yet the true father is a figure in the remote world of a divine story, while the supposed one stands before us, drawn with an all but comic realism.9 What, in fact, the play asks in an almost Pirandellian fashion, is the substance of the truth. We must now follow its wry, ironic, sad and comic interplay between the remote and immediate, realistic and mythical, true and suppositious; between the nostalgia - and absurdity - of dreams and the disillusion of conflicting harsh feeling and reason. II The setting of the play is, of course, Delphi. But the story is an Athenian one. The chorus is made up of visiting Athenian attendants on an Athenian grande dame, Creusa. That Xuthus is not a born Athenian is the principal cause of the suspicions held against him by the chorus and Creusa. Ion, raised in Delphi and devoted to its life, will almost be killed as a foreign pretender to Athenian rule (702ff, 8i3ff, io58ff). The final scene of recognition will also be a recognition of Ion's true city, and the play ends with a departure, or rather return, to Athens, under the guidance of Pallas Athena who, " gracious in Athens and in this place" (1554), comes to Delphi to set the seal of her authority on Ion's parentage and progeny. The play is also filled with the figures of Athenian legend: Cecrops and his daughters the Aglauridae (23, 272ff, 1163), Erechthonius, Erechtheus (cf. 24, 267ff, 723f, 999ff), the Gorgon (210, 999ff, 10o55, 1265), and, of course, Athena herself (cf. 209ff, 452ff, 991ff). The procession to Eleusis and the celebrations there are recalled as a peculiarly Athenian privilege (o074-1o89). The setting of Apollo's encounter with Creusa, the landscape at the edges of the Acropolis, the Steep Rocks, the hill and cave of Cecrops (936, 1400), the cave and probably later shrine of Apollo (283f), a cave and altar of Pan (49off, 938, cf. Herodotus VI.1o5), are all continually evoked. We hear of an apparently current practice of putting amulets into the cradle of a new-born child (20of, 1322f), and it is these, together with a typical Athenian girl's weaving, picturing a Gorgon, and a branch of Athenian olive, that are the tokens by which Ion is recognized</page><page sequence="6">174 Christian Wolff (1416-1436). He finds his mother and his city by the latter's charac- teristic emblems. For some commentators Ion is in fact principally a kind of glori- fication of Athens.1o No doubt Athenians would take pleasure in their national stories. But the extent of this glorification may be gauged by contrast to a play such as Euripides' Suppliants, an "encomium of Athens," as the hypothesis calls it, or to Erechtheus, Euripides' earlier treatment of this part of Athenian legend - both plays of the later 420's."1 The tenor of Ion, on the other hand, is not so much praise of Athens, but rather nostalgia for the city's past expressed through poetic elaborations on her earliest mythology and lingering recollections of the hope of a Ionian empire (cf. 74f, I575ff). It is a nostalgia which may well be imagined in the years after Sicily. Further, if the play is considered patriotic, it shows a patriotism of the narrower sort. Athens is no longer represented as the city of refuge for outsiders or the op- pressed as before in Medea, Heraclidae, Suppliants or Heracles. We see an Athens for the Athenians, insisting on her autochthony and the ex- clusiveness of her citizenry (cf. 589ff, 673ff, 29off), a reflection of a more militant and inflexible national attitude, and of a more intolerant self- assertiveness suggestive of the latter years of the war.12 But the most telling indication of how we may view Athens' political life breaks in on the action of the play when Ion speaks against it. It has been noted that Ion, without knowing that he is born of an Athenian mother, is drawn rather like a young Athenian of good family, similar to the young men in some of Plato's dialogues.13 Yet he first reacts to his presumed father's offer of wealth, rule and family in Athens by rejecting it. And through his long speech of rejection - usually ignored or declared irrelevant by the commentators'4 - Euripides momen- tarily dispels the legendary aura otherwise surrounding Athens in the play. Beside the mythical he sets a contemporary view. The resulting clash, then, is surely not a sign of incompetence - at such length in so polished a play - but a deliberately disturbing interruption. Like almost all the speeches in Euripides which have a programmatic look about them or seem out of context, this one is qualified by its situation. Ion is moved to speak, in great part, by the mistaken assump- tion that he is illegitimate and of foreign birth. And, though he begins by remarking that the appearance of things is not the same seen from a distance as it is close up (585f) - preparing us for a disparity of view- points, he nevertheless goes on to describe an Athens he has never seen and knows only "from a distance." But the substance of what he says still serves to remind his audience of contemporary politics.</page><page sequence="7">The Design and Myth in Euripides' Ion 175 We hear that if anyone seeks to play a prominent part in the city, he is hated by the powerless many out of envy for his gifts, ridiculed by those who are "good" and have the sense to keep quiet, uninvolved in public affairs, and kept from office by the extreme contentiousness of those who hold it (595-606). These are all motifs characteristic of the history of Athenian politics, though hard to locate at any specific moment of it.15 After indicating the difficulty of taking part in Athens' political life, Ion passes on to a rejection of political life as such. He does this by the somewhat oblique way of a critique of tyranny or kingship (62Iff), begun with a repetition of the distinction between pleasant appearance and questionable actuality (622f).16 The contrast between public and private life then becomes one between life in Athens and life in Delphi (633ff), a transition effected by Ion's refusal of wealth with its troubles and his preference for a "measured" existence "with- out pain" (629-632). Delphi is thus a place of refuge and withdrawal, and Ion wishes to choose a life whose terms, as his language suggests,17 can be called hedonistic. Ion ends his speech asking to be left to live his life in Delphi, "for there is equal charm in delighting in great things" - the public life of rule - " and in having the small with pleasure " (646f). This slightly contradictory close - for it qualifies rather than drives home the point of his argument - suggests that preference for Delphi is in part theo- retical; it makes the qualification "other things being equal." But in fact they are not, and there is actually no question of Ion's not going to Athens with his new father. Xuthus simply ignores Ion's arguments altogether (650ff). On the other hand, Ion has made clear how qualified his acceptance of public life is and at what cost he leaves Delphi. An ideal of existence, poetically exemplified in his opening monody (82-183), is expressly preferred to the fulfillment of a national destiny. And, aside from the contrast of ways of life, we see in Ion a young man at a transition between them, growing up to face a harsher kind of existence and first recoiling at the difficulties of it. An immediate question frames his speech: who is his mother (540ff, 563ff, 668ff)? (This preoccupation is unconsciously reflected in the middle of his speech when he expresses pity for the childless Creusa [6I8ff].) The speech itself turns on the question "where can he live?" Ion, unable as yet to see their interrelation, knows only that neither ques- tion can be satisfactorily answered. Thus he falls back on what he has known, his life in Delphi, and what he has been, a servant of Apollo. By giving a qualified view of Athens and suggesting an ideal of life</page><page sequence="8">176 Christian Wolff whose values are private and nonpolitical, Ion's speech, then, has its place in the dramatic fabric of the play. Furthermore, one can also see through it the play's principal affective motifs. As the plans of Apollo had intended the action's end in Athens and yet it was precipitated in Delphi, so the mood and feelings ascribed by Ion to his prospective home erupt already in his present one. Athens he had described as "a city full of fear" (6oi) and the life of the tyrannos as beset by fear (624, 628). Fear also moves the present actors. Xuthus is fearful in his anxiety over Ion's distraction (584). After witnessing the reunion of Ion and Xuthus and having been threatened with death if they reveal it, the chorus look forward with fear to misfortune (686); and so too then Creusa and her attendant (757, 755). Ion had, in his speech, expressed fear of his presumed stepmother if he should come to Athens (61xff). It is a fear fully warranted by the plot against his life in the following scene, a plot encouraged by the suspicious fear which ignorance generates (cf. 685ff, 8o8ff, I300f). Creusa, as we noticed earlier, is here moved by a fear comparable to the one which had originally caused her to expose her child (898, 1497). Ironically, it is only her hesitating fear, before planning her vengeance on Apollo, which she finds easy to overcome (975ff). But, her plan discovered, she flees, once again in fear, to Apollo's altar (cf. 128o). And at the end, even Apollo is moved, Athena tells us, to allow the reunion of Ion and Creusa in Delphi rather than Athens, "fearing" that mother and son might kill one another (i564f). Yet the last inner disturbance, and that most ambigu- ously resolved, is again human. Ion is "shaken" lest Apollo's oracle prove false (i537f). This fear calls forth Athena herself to resolve it, or rather to reconcile Ion to the fact that the god did lie. The youth's equanimity is disturbed before he comes to the "city full of fear." The simple life of Delphi he had thought he could choose is disrupted for him willy-nilly. Ion's speech links fear with hatred and violence. The powerless in the city would hate him, he says (597), and so straightway the chorus of Athenian women turn against him and wish him dead (704, 720). The hatred Ion foresees from his apparent stepmother (611) is im- mediately revealed in his unknowing mother. A tyrant hates the good citizen (628). Ion himself becomes an object of hatred and then turns with hatred on the woman who plotted his death. He had spoken of the proverbial violence of women, given to poisoning and murder (616), and of the violence threatening the tyrant's life (624 [if we read Stephanus' Pflav], 628). Yet violence is at the heart of the story from the beginning. Apollo took Creusa by force (flta, 11, 437, 892), a</page><page sequence="9">The Design and Myth in Euripides' Ion 177 characteristically Olympian way, Ion remarks (445). The violence these actors intend against one another we have already noticed. And through- out myths of violent action are recalled: Heracles, Bellerophon, and the Olympian gods destroying monsters and giants (190-218), Erechtheus killed by Poseidon (282), the daughters of Cecrops making bloody a cliff in their death (274), Athena warring on the Earthborn and slaying the Gorgon (987ff, cf. o1054f). In all the reaches of the play - among its individual actors, in the distantly apprehended world of politics, amidst the figures of the myths - there is violence and force. What is threat- ened in the human world, however, is never, in the course of the action, realized, while the gods' violence proves beneficent. Ion's outburst about Athens - the interruption of a contemporary view of the city in an otherwise legendary setting - is an isolated occurrence in the play. It is only a momentary reminder. And as it is allowed to fade, so is violence shown finally under control. Though violence permeates the action, it is subordinate to an apparently provi- dential design. To what extent that design is due to a genuine sense of divine ordering or to poetic - and thus wishful and hypothetical - disposition remains to be seen. For the moment we may notice the ineffectiveness of human actions which the plot shows, men's inability to realize on their own what they wish.18 Human capacity for violence is not a capacity for strength. We see it most clearly in Creusa's old manservant, who has barely the strength to get himself on stage, "willing" though he is (746, cf. 1215),19 and, of course, in Creusa herself who suffered Apollo "against her will" (94I). In trying to kill Ion, Creusa had acted, she says, "unwillingly" (1500). We might have expected her to say "unknowingly ": human action without knowledge seems no more than human suffering under constraint. The implica- tions of this thought Ion had indicated earlier (when Creusa would have forced an answer about her son from Apollo): "We should indeed be foolish were we to try to make the gods speak against their will what they did not wish" (374f, cf. Sophocles OT 280f). "For," he continues, "what we strive after by force, against the gods' will, we shall obtain as goods of no use, but in those things they give willingly we shall profit" (378ff). To Ion, at this point, a life without involvements, apragmosyne, seems divinely ordained.20 He remarks in his speech about Athens that he himself is "what one would wish for men, even against their will," namely of a just nature (642f). If humans cannot quite achieve what they wish by force, they may have it forced upon them. And yet even Ion, who had said that the god's hand could not be forced, tries finally to do so in order to assure himself of his true paternity (i547f).</page><page sequence="10">178 Christian Wolff He thus brings about the appearance of Athena. It is a curious final compromise between human and divine intentions. If the motif of violence and force in the play shows how powerless humans are, their helplessness is yet a condition of favor, though that favor may be mixed. The play has a happy ending. It shows favor. The human actors, on the one hand, are bound up in fear, hatred, and futile violence. Compassion alone sometimes redeems them: the Pythian priestess who takes in the infant Ion out of pity (cf. 47); the mutual sympathy of Ion and Creusa when neither knows the other (cf. 307, 312, 359f) - though Ion is tempted by a kind of Apollonian indifference (433f, cf. 439); Ion's pity for the childlessness of Creusa (6i8f); his pity for his un- known mother - ironically expressed as he holds Creusa at bay before Apollo's altar (i276f, i369f, i378f); and the compassionate, if mis- guided, loyalty of Creusa's manservant (cf. 925ff). But such feelings alone are not sufficient. Only by divine favor are these figures saved, a favor sometimes distant, sometimes violent (cf. Aeschylus Ag. 180-4). Apollo's rape is called a "favor" done Aphrodite (896). Hermes rescues the infant Ion as a favor to his brother (36f). Divine gracious- ness is evident only in the larger perspective of time. Human beings, for the most part, can hardly understand it. Creusa, unaware of its future, feels only the "thankless betrayal" of her union with Apollo (88o), and immediate circumstances confirm her feeling. Offering thanks to the chorus for any news of Xuthus' consultation of the oracle (751), she must hear that her husband, to whom no favor seems due (914), has been given a child, she none. Yet she had herself been given to Xuthus in recompense for his service to Athens (62, 297). He, in turn, seems only to have shown ingratitude, hiding from her his son (iloo) and presumably having done another woman favor (IIo4). The only favor bestowed by a human and referred to as such is done in deception. The old manservant pretends to do Ion a favor as he hands him a poisoned cup (i 183). Between the distant divine favor and the immediate obscurity of human passions - between Apollo and Creusa - stands Ion. Set apart from ordinary circumstances, his past life had a gracious quality about it, but now we also see its limitations. Not only a god's son, he finds ties to humanity. Not only son of a remote and heavenly Apollo, he discovers his mother, granddaughter of one of the earthborn. Favor is shown him by the discovery of his parentage. Yet, as Ion finds his mother and comes into an inheritance proclaimed glorious, he loses the peace of his early life, is caught up in violence and may look</page><page sequence="11">The Design and Myth in Euripides' Ion 179 forward, in an Athens he had described, to new hazards. Favor has its price. However, we are made to see not only its qualified nature but also a view of things in which it is possible. III Human feelings such as the play represents are immediately recog- nizable. We can call them realistic. Divine favor, on the other hand, is part of a myth, a poetic invention. Thus, similar to the repetitions in the present of a story out of the past shaping the play's plot, there is a drama in the interaction of what is immediate and human with the remote and divine. And a like interaction between what is mythical and what seems humanly reasonable is dramatized principally through the characters of the play themselves. But before turning to them we should notice the way mythical elements as such are represented, for, aside from being the drama of its actors, the play is, in a sense, also about myth itself. The chorus makes its entrance singing an account of what they see represented before them on Apollo's temple: Heracles destroying the Hydra, his companion Iolaus, "subject of stories told as we sit by our weaving," and the battle of "Giants on the marble walls" with the Olympians, among whom Athena is singled out (i9off, 205ff, 209ff). We are reminded at the beginning of the play's action that the figures we see on stage may also be part simply of a body of stories. Athena, who will herself appear at the end, is also seen as a figure in stone at the beginning. The play thus creates effects of perspective, of seeing, as it were, double from differing angles. The action we witness is com- pelling, but throughout it we are reminded that there are others like it which are only stories one tells (cf. 225, 265, 275, 506, 994) or works of art one sees (cf. 271) - such as these sculptures, or the tapestries of mythical beings and the story of Cecrops' daughters later described at length by the messenger (I I4ff, I 58ff). (The tapestries in turn are out of another story, Heracles' gift, we are told, of his spoils from the Amazons [i i44f].) Pointed at in this way, the mythical elements in the play are distanced and isolated as such; they are made to appear decorative.21 It has been observed that the opening chorus' description of statutary, while apparently unique in tragedy as we know it, corresponds to a characteristic feature of epic, namely the description of a place when someone first arrives there (cf., for example, Odyssey 5.63ff, 7.84ff).22 Such description sets a scene, of course; but it also serves to introduce</page><page sequence="12">i8o Christian Wolff that scene from a distance and in a contemplative mode. Thus one finds it associated with the motif of gazing in wonder (cf. Odyssey 5.74f, 7.82f, I33f, 4-43f) and, in Ion, with an emphasis on seeing (cf., in this passage, 190, 194, 201, 205f, 2o8f, 211, 214; and cf. later 1142). Once again there is an effect of distancing. Art is set before us detached and for the viewing. This detachment corresponds to the play's mood of withdrawal and Ion's first peaceful life. And just as there is a movement from with- drawal to the involvement and pathos of events, so descriptions and static pictures only furnish pauses in which the distance of seeing is interposed between the conflicts of feeling and action. Ion's opening monody, for example, begins by describing a beautiful morning scene: the sun's rising, the heights of Parnassus and the smoke of myrrh rising to the temple eaves (82-90o). He then goes on to appoint and ful- fill the various tasks about the temple, and finally ends with the flourish of chasing away the defiling birds - and it is only in the latter part of his song that Ion indicates the possibility that he may have to leave this life (i52f). The scene is an outline of the play's procedure. Similarly the messenger's speech - so puzzling to critics because of its elabora- tions - begins with a full description of a setting and of the tapestries we have already mentioned, and only then goes on to relate what has actually happened, the attempted killing of Ion. (The tapestries, inci- dentally, themselves first represent static scenes of nature and then scenes of action [I i47ff].) The initial description, almost half the length of the messenger's speech, is so evidently contrary to dramatic exigency - the burden of the message is a matter of life and death to the chorus (ii i9f) - that we cannot fail to notice the artifice of the pause. But the most striking juxtaposition - or rather, in this instance, superposition - of detachment and involvement, of the stasis of description and the pathos of human feelings, is found at the center of the play in Creusa's monody. It is an explosion of despair and out- rage (cf. 862ff); and yet simultaneously it suggests a withdrawn calm. Its procedure approaches the formality of a hymn,23 a striking irony: its substance, a denunciation of Apollo, is cast in the form of praise. For all the sorrow Creusa expresses, we are but half moved or at least reconciled, knowing that it will prove groundless. And her outcry is modulated by the accompanying evocations of nature and the god. She begins her revelations by invoking the heavens, "Zeus' many-starred seat" (870, cf. I, 796f), and Athena as goddess of her city's "rocks" and of the Tritonian lake (87if). The scene of the rape is colored by the flash of divine gold, of the gold and saffron of gathered flowers and the</page><page sequence="13">The Design and Myth in Euripides' Ion I8I whiteness of a girl's wrists (887ff). If in her anger Creusa cries to the god that "Delos hates you," she continues, "and the laurel's shoots next to delicately-tressed palm, where Leto gave birth to her sacred offspring, you, by Zeus' harvesting" (919ff). Her feeling seems dis- solved by the beauty of the images which accompany it. Apollo, presumed betrayer, is yet described "making sing the seven-toned cithara's voice, sounding between the lifeless horns of field animals fair-sounding Muses' hymns" (88Iff). The god's music stands for the detachment of art; and at the same time, before the immediacy of human feeling, for Creusa in her ignorance and overwhelmed by her sorrow, it represents divine indifference (cf. 905f; cf. Io9of). That Apollo is here described almost exclusively in his musical aspect suggests that Euripides equates him with poetry. Because we know that in time the god will put the tangle of human affairs in order, the play can sustain its poise between obscure, explosive feelings and an ironic, poetic sense of distance. If the god stands for poetry, his divine favor is the decorative work of the playwright. The myths, then, as they are presented partly suggest detachment, a self-sufficient poetry, enhanced by images of nature - stars (84, 797, 870, 10o78, II47, 1151ff), sun (41, 82f, II34, I148, 1439, 1467, I516, 1550), moon (Io8o, 1155), night (85, 717, 955, 1049, II50), rocks (Ii, 274, 492ff, 714f, 871, 936f, 1267, 1479f, 1482), caves (17, 288, 500ooff, 892, 937f, 948, 958, 1239, 1494), water (95ff, o105f, ii6ff, 147ff, 167, 174f, 872, 1075, Io8Iff), laurel (76, 80, 103, 112f, 148, 422, 919), ivy (217), olive (I433ff, 1480) - and the coloring of gold (9, 25, 146, 157, 192, 431, 459, 887, 890, 909, 1007, 1030, o85, II154, II65, 1175, 1182, I429f). But even as these elements of nature, apart from their suggestion of a withdrawn calm, take on the associations of a story which began in the darkness of a cave and unfolds in the natural beauty of Delphi, so the myths have their symbolic relevance. That they reflect the role of violence in the play we have already noticed, and with violence a benign end. The images of fire and snake are similar. Iolaus, in the sculptures described by the chorus, carries a fiery torch against the giants (195) and Zeus burns one down with his thunderbolt of fire (212ff). That violence serves order. On the other hand, fire is the weapon of the monster Chimaera (202). Within the action of the play itself Creusa's manservant suggests burning down Apollo's temple in revenge for her wrong (974). And Creusa, justifying her attempt on Ion's life, says she had feared he would set her house on fire (1293f)- Both are fantastic suggestions, yet an indication of irrational impulses</page><page sequence="14">182 Christian Wolff for which a Chimaera is emblematic. However, as Olympian violence, like Apollo's--whose "Pythian lightnings" consecrate the Steep Rocks where he took Creusa by force (285) - ends with favor, so fire is also associated with the torches of Dionysus' celebrations (550, 716f, 1125f), of the Eleusinian processions (Io75f), and with the sacrifices attending Ion's birthday celebration (7o7f). The snake (continually recalled through the figure of Cecrops [272, 936, 1163, 1400, 1571] usually represented as half snake [1164, cf. schol. Aristoph. Wasps 438]) likewise stands for a double power. The snake-haired Gorgon is a threatening figure destroyed by Athena (99of). Yet, turned into an image on her aegis, it becomes protective (995f). At Delphi there are two Gorgon figures who keep watch on Apollo's temple (224). Athena had put snakes by the infant Erichthonius to protect him (22f), and "in imitation of the ancient Erichthonius" snake amulets were put into Ion's cradle (i427ff), apparently an old practice of Athenian mothers (cf. 20, 25f). The positive, protective aspect of this mythical force is realized when it becomes a representation or artifact. It is like Euripides' treatment of the myth whose fantastic, irrational substance is not denied or by-passed, but preserved as it is distanced. The twofold force of the snake, finally, is perfectly expressed by the nature of the Gorgon's blood: it can either kill - as the poison intended for Ion - or it can heal and "sustain life" (IoI3ff). The myths are most relevant as they are associated with the charac- ters of the play's action, and to their relationship we turn next. Creusa, the burden of whose life is in the past, is most closely linked to the various mythical figures of the play - which is also appropriate to the feminine intensity and irrational feeling in her character. The latter Ion forcefully expresses through the images of snake and fire just noticed: " Oh father Kephisus of the bull's shape, what serpent is this woman, your progeny, what snake glancing a fire's murderous flame, all of whose rashness is the nature of the drops of the Gorgon's blood " (1262ff). The mythical images characterize precisely an immediate, psychological fact.24 Creusa's closeness to the mythical world, then, is indicated by her ancestry which includes not only the river Kephisus but also one of the earthborn, her grandfather Erichthonius (20, 267f, 1000).25 (His infancy was attended on by Athena [2If, 27o] and it was from her that he received the drops of Gorgon's blood which are handed down to Creusa [ioolff].) Her father was Erechtheus who was swallowed up by the earth after being struck down by Poseidon (28If). And to complete her associations with legend, Creusa bears Apollo a son.</page><page sequence="15">The Design and Myth in Euripides' Ion 183 Xuthus, though a grandson of Zeus (63, 292), is, on the other hand, farthest from the mythical world. The point is nicely made when Ion, trying to discover who his mother might be, asks whether the earth might have born him. Xuthus answers drily that "the earth doesn't bear children" (542), a reasonable answer setting into a comic light all the earthborn which the play tells of - Erichthonius, the Giants (218), the Gorgon (989). However, Xuthus' is not the view of the play. He is a limited figure whose imagination does not extend beyond the everyday world and whose feelings, though well-intentioned, are obtuse (cf. 401ff). His way is to let things fall out as they might, pursuing no inquiry too far (659f, 575)- We noticed that he hardly seemed aware of Ion's feelings at the prospect of leaving Delphi. And as for the mother of his new-found son, he forgets to ask the oracle who she might be; the question is raised only at Ion's insistence. Xuthus' exchange with his apparent son, the so-called " false" recognition scene, is characterized by a lightness of tone approaching comedy and by its realism. There is nothing mythical about the incident revealed out of the older man's past: he once seduced one of Delphi's girls (545ff). This dialogue is a counterpart to the one just preceding between Ion and Creusa which was characterized by its pathos, the excitement of a possible recognition and the unconscious feeling of sympathy between the speakers - in contrast to Ion's first repulsion of Xuthus' eager embrace (519ff). Yet the exchange between Ion and Creusa was also filled with mythical tales (cf. 265ff, 275ff, 336ff). The truer situation and the greater psycho- logical rightness, the more substantial feelings, unconscious though they may be, are associated with the more extraordinary world of the myths. Through Xuthus, too, the myths are distanced. And his role well illustrates the fact that, though distanced, they do not necessarily lose their symbolic force. We are, instead, allowed to confront them with a measure of detachment, failing which they would seem only absurd and Euripides no more than a mocker of the old stories. But once the myth is pointed at for what it is, or when it is seen, through such a figure as Xuthus, in a realistic and half-comic light, we are disarmed; our belief is easily suspended. And thus we can reconsider the myth's possible meaning and our relation to it. Xuthus' limitations lead us to look again beyond him.26 The myth, more generally, may also reveal the limitations of human reason and human feeling. It has been well pointed out that Creusa's manservant, hearing of Xuthus' new son, deduces a plot --that Xuthus is trying to pass off an illegitimate child on the royal family</page><page sequence="16">184 Christian Wolff (8I6ff) - by the common sophistic and rationalist procedure of in- ference from likelihood, ElKOS.27 He makes a reasonable assumption given the appearance of things. And yet, in fact, he could not be in greater error.28 The myth here stands for a greater incommensurability in things, which the old man leaves out of his reckoning (a reckoning further obscured by his strong sense of loyalty; cf. 81 if). By a particular irony Creusa too fails to regard the implications of the myth. She who had had so much experience of the extraordinary despairs of its possi- bilities. Her immediate, human sense of betrayal keeps her from hope in the miraculous. (Thus she also excludes any possibility of a fortunate turn in her situation, though she had herself remarked that mortal affairs are continually subject to reversal [969].) There is the implica- tion that a sense of the mythical might keep one from despair. But Creusa's sense of injury outweighs hope and makes the extraordinary seem far distant. Both the simple reasoning of the manservant and the feeling of Creusa are baffled and insufficient before the obscurities which a mythical world represents. Between Creusa who is closest to the world of legend, though misunderstanding it, and Xuthus who, in his narrower, ordinary way, is farthest from it, there is Ion. His life, as we first see it, is in accord with Delphi and the service of its god. He has an intuitive understanding of his relation to Apollo, calling him "father" (136-9, cf. lo9). Though thinking he speaks symbolically, he unconsciously speaks simple truth. For him myth and his own innocent sense of the world coincide. But it is a precarious coincidence. Straightway the encounter with Creusa follows in which Ion comes to believe that Apollo, as careless seducer, does not measure up to the claims of human decency. "The god," he admits, "is unjust" (355, cf. 341, 254). But Ion still prevents Creusa from consulting Apollo's oracle. He with- draws to the view, which we noted earlier, that the criterion of divinity is power and the god cannot be forced (373ff). Tempted, next, to put Creusa and her accusations against Apollo out of his mind and to return to his simple existence (433ff), Ion nevertheless reconsiders further: "I must give Phoebus some advice. What is the matter with him?" (436f). His naivet6 and the colloquial turn 29 are light in tone. At the same time his language changes from the poetry of his opening monody to a more prosaic and rational questioning. 30 A critique of divine morality follows whose general substance is the familiar philosophical and rationalist attack on the traditional gods of the myths. Ion gives abstract formulation to the tension in the play between the mythical</page><page sequence="17">The Design and Myth in Euripides' Ion 185 and the human, particularly as the latter is represented by reason and moral feeling. The gods, Ion says, strong (439, 446) and violent (437, 445), act in a way that is incommensurable with human morality and justice (cf. 449-51). And yet they "write" men's laws (442f). Where, then, in the obscurity of their circumstances, can men find an objective justice (449ff)? However, what the gods do is "beautiful" (450).31 The myth and the irrational state of things for which it stands are in- compatible with a notion of justice, at least justice in a political, that is, human sense. For such conflicts the play indicates no solution; it simply raises them and, by the manner of their presentation, distances them. Thus Ion's words are qualified not only by a certain lightness of tone,32 but also, as in his speech about Athens, by his lack of knowledge. He is, after all, himself an unknowing witness of the fruitfulness of the god's violence. Apollo's greatest injustice, he imagines, is to have taken no care for his offspring (438f). Yet among Ion's first words in the play was a thanksgiving for the care the god had shown him (iio, I37, 183; cf. 323, 327; 36). The formulation of a conflict between human and divine is subordinate to a demonstration of the limits of human knowl- edge. The incompatibility of "beauty" and "justice " is the result of an obscurity in the human situation from which only "beauty" - the myth - can on occasion distract us. Creusa, we saw, resists the myth's suggestion of miraculous possi- bility because of the intensity of her feeling. Ion, on the other hand, recoils from a mythical world because of his demands for reasonable- ness. Yet both are fundamentally moved by a similar impulse. When they next confront each other, after Creusa's attempt on her son's life, she seeks asylum at the altar of Apollo. (It is a beautiful irony, not only because Creusa had denounced the god and had despaired of his help, but because she is now driven to risk her life on the efficacy of his divinity and Ion's persuasion of its worth.) Ion, then, as Creusa had been before, is impelled by his sense of injury, and he would be avenged for the attempt on his life. But first he must exclaim on the behalf of reason: the god has not made intelligent or good laws,33 for the rights of his sanctuary should be reserved only for the good who deserve them (1312ff). And, once again, though Ion makes the reasonable objection and attempts to formulate a more rational justice, the circumstances belie his words. His argument would justify tearing his mother from the god's altar to put her to death. Once more a critical perspective on the myth is itself qualified by a deeper human ignorance, more specifically now an ignorance about one's origins. Ion does not know who his mother is (cf. 1277, 1307, 1324, 1363, 1375ff); the only hint is part of an old story.</page><page sequence="18">186 Christian Wolff Creusa is partly saved by the god's "unreasonable" laws. She is also saved by the entrance of the Pythia, whose office is to "preserve the old law - nomos" of Delphi (1322). The priestess comes with a "new story" ([00os0 vios, 1340), which is actually the old one of her taking in the infant Ion. Her appearance is another of the play's repeti- tions, as her tale is twice-told. Having in the past been moved by her human pity and by the god's guidance to take in the child left at the temple gate (42ff), she now comes again before the same temple to urge Ion's pity and, unaware of their implication, brings the old tokens of recognition. Together with the past, the myth comes again to the fore. Creusa had been condemned by a decree of the rulers of Delphi (1ii if, i222f), a public enaction of the law. Yet when Ion comes to carry out the decree, he speaks and acts for his own outraged feelings. The decree is not mentioned, nor will the play refer to it again. Instead, the Pythia, representative of an "old law," appears and brings it about that the rights of sanctuary which Ion had attacked are upheld. She achieves this, however, not so much by appealing to them but to Ion's own feelings and understanding for the plight of Creusa (1327ff). Private feelings supplant considerations of public decree and simple reason. Implicit, as throughout the play, is a devaluation of the public, political sense of law. The actions of the gods, Ion had indicated, obscure justice for men (442-51). His speech rejecting Athens raised doubts about the meaningfulness of the city's public life. Being made a citizen "by the laws," 34 Ion remarks, will never take precedence over citizenship by birth (674f). No law, claims Creusa's manservant, stands in the way of doing an enemy ill (io46f), a view which then tempts Ion. Birth, nature, and subjective feeling overweigh the usual public sense of law. The latter is replaced by the Pythia's appeal to Ion's natural feelings and to "law," nomos, as a way of life established by its age and, presumably, apprehended by those of better nature. It is this kind of nomos which Ion refers to when he says that "a way of life and nature" (d vo4pos 7q ~brs 0' apa) combined to make him "just" (643f)035 In this sense nomos also meets the myth on the ground of their remote past.36 The world of the myth and human feeling coincide at their greatest intensity in the play's climactic scene, the recognition of mother and son. The past is fulfilled. The old, reiterated story is coming to an end. The recognition is part of the myth, partly miraculous - Ion's cradle as fresh as the day it was made (i39iff), and the olive branch in it still green (1435f) - and partly providential - the Pythia's entrance and the general turn of events which Ion will call tyche (1514). Or, to put it</page><page sequence="19">The Design and Myth in Euripides' Ion 187 another way, the recognition is part of the play's plot, resulting from what is beyond the apprehension of the characters rather than from their reconciled feelings. But it, in turn, releases one of the most moving of human feelings, the immediate joy of a sense of life at once newly discovered and happily preserved (cf. 1444 with 953, 1038, I44If, I496ff). And yet there is still a snag - the demands, once again, of human thoughtfulness. The final recognition scene is a counterpart to the earlier one in which Ion and Xuthus recognize one another falsely as father and son. The contrast between the two scenes'3 now recalls the question of who Ion's father really is, or rather, that Ion does not know. The reversal from ignorance to knowledge, which should charac- terize a scene of recognition, is not complete. At the moment when Ion's ties to both the human and divine world seem confirmed, he must question the latter. He cannot believe that Apollo is in fact his father, though he had before figuratively thought him so. Human experience suggests that Creusa has substituted the god for a human seducer (1523ff, cf. 325, 341), an assumption Ion shares with the Pythia (44f, I365f), and for which there is precedence in Xuthus' past.38 Ion, like Creusa before him, now holds to human experience, and doubts the divine. It is the play's last perspective of reason on the myth and is focused by raising the question of truth and falsehood. If Apollo is Ion's father, the god who prophesies "the things that are," "the truth" (-V&amp; v-r, 7; cf. 531, 537, I288),39 has simply lied by indicating Xuthus to be father. "Has the god prophesied true or vainly" (&amp;AXvs ~C/r1v7, 1537; cf. 1488)? This question "shakes" Ion's heart "reasonably" (ElKdTWS, I538; cf. 557, 6ii). But the question of the truth or falsehood of Apollo's oracle is the last in a series asked about the myths. "Is the story true or false" (&amp;A'JXOS - ltl-rvjv) that Erechtheus sacrificed his daughters? Ion had asked Creusa (275). "Is it true, the story they tell" (&amp;Avj7O-s CO LEeLVOEV-rCL) about Erichthonius (265)? Did the earth "truly" (d&amp;X60,5&amp;) swallow up Creusa's father (281)? Is Apollo's temple "really" (vTCOws) the earth's navel (223; cf. Or. 33I)? These questions are like the pointing at the myths which we noticed earlier and have a similar effect of dis- tancing. They are also the most explicit references from within a play to the traditional associations of poetry and lying.40 When the old stories are questioned, the effect may be partly playful, a game of perspectives between sophisticated skepticism and the seemingly naive fantasies of the myths. But the play does not rest there. Its plot, we saw, continually shows the insufficiency of isolated reason, sensibility</page><page sequence="20">188 Christian Wolff or feeling. Thus the question "true or not ?" can also be serious. Truth is not only questioned in a detached, ironic way, but also dramatically, in the light of one human being's despair, another's shaken faith, and a third's deception. All the questions about the truth of the mythical stories are answered in the affirmative by the characters in the play. But Ion's question about the truth of Apollo's oracle is not. And though attacks on Apollo's oracle are not unusual and oracles themselves are notoriously ambiguous about the truth, such a realization can be critical in a particular instance. For Ion the play's action culminates with doubt, not simply about the life to which he has been dedicated, but - once more - about his origins, his father. He is left with the alternative of ignoring the truth or losing his sense of its worth. Ion's doubt calls forth Athena to resolve it. But the play's happy ending is not an ideal ending. Athena's resolution is not on the private, simply human level, but on a public and aetiological one. Mythical past and aetiological future are not quite harmonized with a human present. Ion who would have lived in anonymous obscurity in Delphi will be famous, giving the Ionians their name (1575, I587f). Between the private person we have seen and the legend that is announced there is a certain discontinuity. Between the human individual and the myth there is still some distance and obscurity. Apollo, with whom Ion seemed so closely bound at the play's beginning, who moves so much of the story's original and final action, is never seen. Like the presence of Hermes at the start, that of Athena at the end underlines Apollo's absence, his actual remoteness even in Delphi. The play also ends with a specific deception, a residue, as it were, of its action which had been an interweaving of deceptions and truths.41 All the actors have been in some degree deceived, by others, circum- stances, or themselves. Apollo - to sum it up - had deceived Xuthus into believing Ion his son, a belief Ion is first made to share. Xuthus sets out to deceive Creusa by keeping from her the god's gift of a son, albeit he is well-intentioned, wishing to put off her grief at remaining childless (656ff). Creusa, learning of his deception, in turn assumes Xuthus is working a fraud by it. These deceptions, revealed and again misunderstood, lead to a revelation of the sum of Creusa's grief, her story kept hidden for so long (874f, 895f).42 But another deception, the plot on Ion's life, follows. It is uncovered and the "revealed" son (978, 1188) is saved. Yet he, in his turn, is straightway shown in his greatest ignorance, about to kill her whom he would most know (cf. I276ff, I378f). The next reversal is the recognition of mother and son. But its revelations too are insufficient, neither final nor entirely</page><page sequence="21">The Design and Myth in Euripides' Ion 189 persuasive, until Athena, ex machina, comes on to reveal the truth about Apollo's purposes and to give the legend her authority. And now her final resolution includes the continued deception of Xuthus with which the action had begun. He will be kept in the "fond illusion" that he is Ion's father (1602). "Apollo has managed everything well," Athena tells us (1595; cf. Or. 1664), and we can have no argument with her. But we have also been shown that the conditions under which the gods' providence works are less commensurable with truth than with poetry. And poetry, like the sung oracle (cf. 6, 92, 682) of the musician god, is a deception which can be questioned only at the risk of sorrow. That Xuthus will remain deceived is not altogether inappropriate, for he had himself tried to deceive Creusa about a son, and as an outsider not of Athenian origin (and thus comparable to the deceived barbarian kings of IT and Helen) he might be considered fair game for such a deception - which, finally, also befits the comic qualities of his characterization. There is comedy, Plato says, in the misunderstanding of appearances, in a failure of self-knowledge, so long as these are joined with harmlessness (Philebus 48c6-49c5; cf. Aristotle, Poetics 1449a34). And this, on the whole, covers Xuthus' situation. That he is only a secondary character no longer seen on stage after the first third of the play suggests the degree to which the play may be considered comic. The ignorance of Ion and Creusa is both painful and potentially dangerous. They are saved only by extraordinary circumstances. Therein lies the play's serious- ness and "tragedy." We are shown the ignorance of the human state as such and - even for better natures, such as these figures clearly are - its hazardousness. The play raises the question of how one can act in a world where so much is unknown, kept hidden, or unexpected; how one can humanly reason; and how survive the intensities of human feeling. In a sense there is a moral implicit. Creusa's manservant once expresses the familiar and accepted Greek sentiment that nothing should withstand doing an enemy ill (io45ff).43 But he does this in justification of the plot to kill Ion. The play thus undercuts the tradi- tional view by raising the question: how can you do an enemy ill when things are such that you cannot really know who your enemy is? All of Ion's rationalism had been similarly undercut. Yet, beyond this implied "moral," which suggests an extreme reticence and caution for all human actions - the withdrawal, in fact, which so tempts Ion, there is still the unresolved fact that humans must act, reason, and feel passions, and that thus, in the very expression of their humanity, lies their greatest danger. The gods, at some remove, help to define this</page><page sequence="22">19o Christian Wolff situation: the condition of human life has always some final obscurity about it. But the gods may sometimes be gracious, as in this play which, as a result, communicates its seriousness with calm. NOTES i. Compare the absence of Artemis, around whom so much of the plot turns, in Iphigenia among the Taurians. And contrast the presence of the gods immediately concerned in the tragedies of final disaster such as Hippolytus and Bacchae. 2. Hermes, one might add, associated with lucky finds and discoveries, appropriately assists at the "discovery" (1441, cf. 1424) of Ion. 3. The prominence of the motif of birth and children in the play is noticed by A. Pippin Burnett, "Human Resistance and Divine Persuasion in Euripides' Ion," CP 57 (1962) 101, 103 n.4. 4. Cf. his threat to kill the birds defiling Apollo's sanctuary (I58ff). Creusa continually imagines her abandoned child as prey of birds (cf. 504, 902, 917, 1494f), but it is a bird, accidentally dying from the poison intended for Ion, that saves his life (I I96-12o8). Violence preludes fortunate providence. 5. F. M. Wasserman, "Divine Violence and Providence in Euripides' Ion," TAPhA 71 (1940) 6oi. 6. Cf. also Xuthus' consultation of two oracles (300, 405ff) and Creusa's invention of a fictitious double of herself through whom she first tells a story about a son who would correspond exactly in age to the one standing before her (cf. 354). 7. See, for instance, Otto Rank, The Myth of the Birth of the Hero (Vintage Books, New York 1959) 71f, 85ff, where a connection between doubling and the motif of rebirth is also noticed. Cf. J. A. Stewart, The Myths of Plato (London 1905) 474: "With regard to... the fancy that 'our youth was a dream' [the reference is to Republic 414d] - I would only remark that Plato seems here to appeal to an experience which is by no means uncommon in childhood - to the feeling that the things here are doubles of things elsewhere. The production of this feeling in his adult patient ... [is] one of the chief means by which the poet effects the purpose of his art." 8. The late date of Ion, sometimes questioned, now seems to be agreed on. See, e.g., M. Pohlenz, Die Griechische Tragoedie, ed. 2 (Goettingen 1954) II, I65; Wilamowitz in the preface to his edition (Berlin 1926) 24; E. B. Ceadel, CQ 35 (I941) 78f. G. Zuntz, The Political Plays of Euripides (Manchester 1955) 64 n. i, suggests a connection between the play's prominent Erechtheus mytho- logy and the rebuilding of the Erechtheion, substantially completed by 408 (I.G. I2, 373, line i; cf. also T. Dohrn, Attische Plastik [Krefeld 19571 ] 30). The earlier date (some time between 418 and 414), however, is again supported by D. J. Conacher ("The Paradox of Euripides' Ion," TAPhA 90 [I959] 26ff, 38) who doubts that Euripides could deal lightly with Athens' relation to Ionia after the Ionian revolts of 412. But, in the first place, there is really nothing in the play which can be shown to have a specific reference to the actual relations of Athens and her former colonies (cf. Zuntz' note above). And, furthermore, we have a good instance of Euripides' light treatment of serious matters of immediate relevance in Helen: discussion of war, exile and death is not there avoided</page><page sequence="23">The Design and Myth in Euripides' Ion 191 though following directly on the Sicilian defeat. Metrical criteria must surely come first in trying to date a Euripidean play, and these support the later date (Ceadel, above, n.8). For other possibly relevant considerations see p. 174 below and nn.15 and 36. 9. The confusion may be increased by the fact that there is a twofold tradition about Ion's father. Xuthus actually seems to have the earlier claim (so Herodotus VII.94, VIII.44 and Euripides himself, Melanippe the Wise Iof, Page). And it may be Euripides who first makes Apollo the father, for Ion is the earliest reference to that tradition (later there is Plato, Euthyd. 3o2d I). For the whole matter see A. S. Owen's edition of the play (Oxford 1939) x-xvii. For the extensive use of two superimposed mythical traditions compare Helen. io. E.g., H. Gr6goire, in his introduction to the Bud6 text (Paris 1950) i68ff. i i. Though Erechtheus was about sacrifice in a national cause, the world of this legend is, so to speak, pre-political. The political life and organization which the Athenians associate with their city traditionally begins with the kingship of Theseus (cf. Suppliants 352f, 404ff; Thucydides II.15.1). 12. One might also note that the indiscriminate acceptance of foreigners in Athens is a charge made against the "extreme" democracy (cf., e.g., Aristoph., Clouds 998, I321ff, Frogs 730ff, 'Xenophon,' Rep. Ath. I.iof, Plato, Republic 563a). Ion on the whole suggests a conservative point of view, supported, for example, by the continuous emphasis on good birth, eugeneia (for which see Wassermann [above, n.5] 594). Professor J. H. Finley has pointed out to me that Frogs 964ff suggests Euripides' association with the oligarchic moderates such as Theramenes mentioned there. Cf. also Frogs 952ff, where Euripides is warned not to push a claim to be "democratic." 13. Wassermann (above, n.5) 593. 14. E.g., Wilamowitz (above, n.8) 15. I5. Thus, e.g., the opposition of the members of the extreme democracy to the well-born (cf. G. Hignett, History of the Athenian Constitution [Oxford 1952] 262ff) and "keeping quiet" (cf. V. Ehrenberg, "Polypragmosyne," fHS 67 [19471 46ff). Pericles is made to point out that anyone intending "to do something," unlike the uncommitted and withdrawn apragmon, will necessarily incur hatred by his rule (Thucydides 11.64.4-5). One may also recall the figure of Antiphon, at a time closer to Ion, who took part in politics only from behind the scenes, "held in suspicion by the multitude because of his reputation for skillfulness" (Thucydides VIII.68.i). 16. Cf. Suppliants 428ff, where, however, tyranny is rejected for Athenian democracy. Closest to this passage in Ion is Hippolytus o103ff where tyranny is considered by Hippolytus to be simply corrupting; he prefers to live among his friends without hazards and his principal ambition is to win at the Pan- Hellenic games (as Ion would spend his life at the "Pan-Hellenic" Delphi). But while Hippolytus is destroyed within the confines of his life, Ion will be drawn out to another. 17. Thus SdV (622, 641, 647), "8o01v (627), Xalpret (639, 647), -rEp7rdvv (630), Avrrpd (597, 623, cf. 632), wrLKpcs- (6IO, 613); 'yaO0 and 81Katos appear just once each (633, 643). Such language is, to be sure, not uncharacteristic in non- philosophical contexts. Pleasure rather than virtue, fame, or even advantage, is given as the standard of life: for instance, Hipp. IoI3, IoI5, Io2o, Sophocles, OT 592f, 596, Thucydides 11.38.1, 11.40.3, Xenophon, Hiero i, 2-8.</page><page sequence="24">I92 Christian Wolff I8. The prevalence of this theme throughout the plays of Euripides has been well observed by H. Strohm, Euripides: Interpretationen zur dramatischen Form (Zetemata 15, Munich 1957); see his index under "Entwertung der Tat." 19. Cf. Wilamowitz, Herakles, ed. 2 (Berlin 1895) II, 28, on lines 107-37. 20. Cf. 598f. Creusa's plot on Ion's life is also a form of arovS3 (cf. Io61, 1226; 1028). Ion uses the word in connection with the god's unjust pursuit of pleasure (449). But Athena uses it of her ready coming at the play's resolution (1556). 21. Such an effect of distancing seems new with Euripides. It may stem from the device of citing a statement or recalling a mythical figure and then refuting the statement or contrasting the speaker to that figure: cf., for instance, Aeschy- lus, Ag. 75of, Sophocles, Ant. 621, Trach. Iff, Phil. 676ff. The effect in these cases, however, is to intensify the particular point of the speaker's thought or situation, whereas in Euripides the effect of pointing at the myth is one of detachment or ironical contrast to what is actually presented. For the explicit breaking into a narrative one might compare Pindar pausing to indicate that he has revised a myth (O I.28f), though he is, of course, under no obligation to sustain his narrative throughout a poem. Breaking the dramatic illusion by calling attention to the myth is, on the other hand, akin to the practice of comedy which so often plays with the fact of its own fiction. As for the references to works of art, we might recall that Euripides was reported to have practiced painting (Genos 2). There is a striking example of the use of an image from that art in Hecuba when the old queen asks Agamemnon to "stand back like a painter" and view the sum of her disasters (807f). 22. P. Friedlaender, Johannes von Gaza (Leipzig &amp; Berlin 1912) 5f, 28f. 23. As first remarked by W. Schadewaldt, Monolog und Selbstgesprdch (Neue Philologische Untersuchungen 2, Berlin 1926) I6if. For a fine analysis of the monody see also Strohm (above, n.I8) I6Iff, and cf. Burnett (above, n.3) 95f. 24. Cf. Plato Rep. 588c where an "image of the soul" is described like "such ancient natures as they fable, the Chimaera's or Scylla's or Cerberus'." Cf. also 59oa9-bI where the middle part of the soul is called "lion- and snake- like" (the latter should not be emended [as Jaeger suggested, Eranos 44 (1946) I23ff]; the middle part of the soul is as contradictory and problematic as the combination of the natures of lion and snake - which is specifically suggested when Thrasymachus is compared to both [341CI-2, 358b3]). See also Phaedrus 229d2ff: there Centaurs, Chimaera, Gorgons and Typhon are figures of the obscurity of the soul which cannot be rationalized away. 25. His birth - like Ion's - is the fortunate result of an unhappy encounter. Hephaestus was his father, impregnating the earth on failing in an assault on Athena. 26. This is, I think, sufficient refutation of Verrall's view of the play, namely that a hoax has been perpetrated and that Xuthus is in fact Ion's real father, thus making the play an elaborate mockery of Apollo and Delphi (see Euripides the Rationalist [Cambridge 1895] I29ff, or the introduction to his edition of the play [Cambridge 189o]). There is of course an element of mockery, but it is such that it does not exclude the meaningfulness of what is mocked. Xuthus' character is clearly delimited. If we are persuaded that he is Ion's true father, then we must reduce the meaning of the play to his horizons. Verrall's observa- tion that the play has a double aspect, a human and divine one, the first reason-</page><page sequence="25">The Design and Myth in Euripides' Ion 193 able, the other preposterous - apparently, is most helpful. However, by denying any meaning at all to the latter aspect, he by-passes a good part of the play's substance. Recent critics, notably Wassermann (above, n.5) and Burnett (above, n.3), while adding a number of fine insights, fall to an opposite extreme - by accepting the terms of Verrall's argument - and interpret the play as a vindica- tion of Apollo (e.g., "the revelation of the quality of Apollo's power is the true purpose of the tragedy," Burnett 94). But why, we might ask, should Apollo need vindication? And why should not the human aspect of the play command equal attention and interest? 27. W.-H. Friedrich, Euripides und Diphilos (Zetemata 5, Munich 1953) 20ff. 28. Creusa and her manservant "mean to assassinate the boy they accuse Apollo of having allowed to die, and to protect the House of Erechtheus by killing its scions" (Burnett [above, n.31 99). 29. TI dtaoXEL (cf., e.g., Aristoph. Wasps I). The phrase is nicely echoed towards the end of the play when Ion addresses it to himself (1385). 30. Compare, then, how he expresses his feeling that Apollo is his father first in the monody (i36ff) and then (1288) with the unique use in tragedy of the abstract o'aacl in the sense of "being." 31. Cf. Aristophanes' Clouds 1o2of, 1078, Birds 755f, Plato, Gorgias 482e4-5: what is "natural" is taken as beautiful and considered "right," setting beautiful and good at odds. The immediate sense of Ion's phrase r&amp; - 1v OECOV KaAh is probably ironic (" the fine doings of the gods "). But our abstraction from it here seems possible in the context of the play as a whole which so often makes the association of gods and the beautiful, and also because speculative argument underlies Ion's speech. For another, though more striking, example of kalos in both an ironical and literal sense see Bacchae 1163 and cf. Ioo7 (cf. also Phoen. 821, Hesiod, Theog. 585). 32. One should also notice the incongruity of Ion's applying the language of private law-suit (444ff; see Wilamowitz [above, n.8] on 449) to the gods. As in his familiar form of address to Apollo, he unwittingly uses the language of an anthropomorphism which he seems to attack. 33. The question of such a relationship - between a god and intelligence or moral sensibility - is raised a number of times in Euripides (cf. Med. 223, Hipp. 951, HF 347, 655f, El. 294f, Troad. 972, 981, Hel. 1441, Phoen. 86). For the connection of intelligence and justice cf. HF 347 and Thucydides 111.42.3, VI.4o.I. 34. Reading Conington's v4potwcv for the weak Ao'yotwrv of the manuscripts. 35. Such a sense of nomos, as partly internalized, as it were, is also suggested by Democritus when he speaks of a "law for the soul" (frg. 264, Diels). 36. It is worth noting that the phrase vd'ov aoovU used by the Pythia (1322) had been used of Creusa's observance of the tradition of putting amulets in an infant's cradle (20) - amulets which will be one of the means of identifying Ion. Could there be in these references to the "old way" an oblique allusion to the patrios nomos, the ancestral constitution, which the oligarchic conserva- tives claimed to be restoring - during the period to which we would assign this play (cf. Thucydides VIII.76.6)? 37. Each recognition is accompanied by a temptation to withdrawal on Ion's part. After the recognition with Xuthus he asked to be left in Delphi. Before the recognition of Creusa he is, for a moment, about to let the question of who his 7 + H.S.C.P.</page><page sequence="26">194 Christian Wolff mother is go unexamined, fearing that he prove base-born (i38off). This latter withdrawal from knowledge has as its outward sign the dedication of Ion's unexamined birth tokens to Apollo, that is, it suggests a withdrawal back into the mythical, into the unquestioning state in which we see Ion at the beginning of the play (cf. 433ff). But Ion here is only briefly tempted by what is in fact - like his refusal to go to Athens - impossible, an impossibility now dramatically evident in the silent, almost forgotten figure of Creusa cowering at the altar behind him. That his doubts should come first after a false recognition and then before a true one is a particularly nice psychological as well as dramaturgical point. 38. For a similar doubt about divine birth compare Ba. 28ff. A purely human version of this story, in which the vanished and returned seducer is a man rather than a god, makes up the plot of Menander's Epitrepontes. 39. For C4v as "true" cf. Herodotus' frequent ro E'dv (e.g., 1.30.3, 97.1, IV. 32), Thucydides VII.8.2, Aristophanes, Frogs 10o52 (Euripides speaking), Euripides, El. 346. 40.
