         <p>The notions of obedience and authority are central to Nietzsche's thinking about the achievement of intelligibility. For example, in <italic>Twilight of the Idols</italic>, Nietzsche writes that “Wherever authority is still part of accepted usage, […] one does not ‘give reasons’ but commands” (<italic>TI</italic> “Socrates” 5).<sup>1</sup> And in <italic>Beyond Good and Evil</italic>, he writes, “what is essential ‘in heaven and on earth’ seems to be […] that there be obedience over a long period of time and in a single direction: given that, something always develops, and has developed, for whose sake it is worth while to live on earth” (<italic>BGE</italic> 181). The suggestion in these passages and elsewhere is that the philosophical demand for reasons to ground human judgment is a failure of obedience to the authority of one's culture, a failure that amounts to a form of alienation that deprives one's life of meaning. Nietzsche's point is not that our judgments do not often stand in need of reasons but that, like any human practice, the practice of giving reasons depends itself on something achieved only gradually and at length and that does not itself rest on reasons. The source of our ability to make sense is, on this account, twofold. On the one hand, judgment is impossible where nothing counts as anything, and that <italic>x</italic> counts as <italic>y</italic> (that, say, this is a reason for that) is not itself the result of the judgments that its so counting makes possible. On the other hand, however, a culture has no more authority than its members grant it. In other words, the context of judgment is provided by a speaker's willingness to rely on the practices that make judgment possible at all. That the rationality of such willingness cannot be determined from a point of view external to it need not, in Nietzsche's view, be understood as undermining the speaker's claim to it: whence Nietzsche's suggestion that we think of judgment as commanding.</p>
         <p>Here I would like to suggest how one might begin to explore Nietzsche's conception of obedience and authority from the perspective of dog training.<sup>2</sup> The suggestion that the trainer's perspective might illuminate Nietzsche's thinking is not as outlandish as it might at first appear to be. After all, trainers who insist that the dogs they train be reliable when not on a leash are fundamentally concerned with the nature of obedience and authority and with how they are achieved. The vocabulary to which such trainers appeal in both their thinking and their teaching is, as we will see, at least as rich as Nietzsche's own.<sup>3</sup>

         <p>Let us begin with the trainer's claim that obedience is the end, not the means, of training. As the trainer understands these things, obedience cannot be the means of training, because the ability to command—which is the mark of authority and hence the context for obedience—depends on training, not the other way around.<sup>4</sup> Clarity about this claim will allow us to make a dog trainer's sense of the way <italic>On the Genealogy of Morals</italic> draws the distinction between the individual and the herd, and this will in turn shed light on the difference, as Nietzsche sees it, between guilt and responsibility. I spoke a moment ago of a trainer who insists on off-lead reliability, but not all trainers do insist on it. “Reliability” is another name for obedience in this sense. Those who do not insist on obedience tend to offer a variety of reasons, often having to do with the dog's safety, for recommending that one never let one's dog off its leash. But some trainers go further and suggest that it is simply unreasonable to expect a dog to be 100 percent reliable and that it is therefore grossly irresponsible to let a dog off-lead. A trainer like Bill Koehler, however, insists that “the criterion in comparing training methodology [is] always the absolute reliability of a trained dog in off-lead control.”<sup>5</sup> Such trainers contend that it is wrong to speak of a dog being well trained who is not reliable off-lead, but they would also insist that reliability not be confused with predictability. As another name for obedience, “reliability” refers to an aspect of relationship and means much the same as “trustworthiness.”<sup>6</sup> By contrast, someone (or something) could be predictable enough without being, in the relevant sense, trustworthy.</p>
         <p>Consider, as an illustration of this sort of confusion, some remarks by a prominent dog trainer. In an essay entitled “Reliability and the Retrieve,” Suzanne Clothier rails against so-called force trainers who insist on what she calls “100% reliability” on the retrieve.<sup>7</sup> She contends that, in an imperfect world, there is no more reason to insist on a dog's reliability than on our own. Indeed, she defies her reader to point to a single instance of 100 percent reliability <italic>anywhere</italic>. It is hard to disagree with the facts: the unanticipated does occur. But imagine someone trying to excuse himself for a missed meeting by saying that, well, he's just unpredictable or who, when called to task for a broken promise, reminds us that, as Clothier puts it, “nothing is unchangeable, immutable, immune to alteration or failure.” In cases in which someone has been accused of a failure of trustworthiness rather than of being unpredictable, such remarks are irrelevant.</p>
         <p>Clothier, however, is quite ready to speak in the same breath of the unreliability of her dog and of her truck: “If my truck fails at the wrong moment, it can be deadly—literally. If my dog fails to retrieve a dumbbell, no one is hurt.” The suggestion is that the failures in question are of a piece; the only difference is in the relative severity of the consequences. The idea that a failure to retrieve might represent a betrayal—a breach of trust—seems not to have occurred to her, but this is just what the trainer who demands reliability will say of the dog who chooses to chase the cat rather than to complete the retrieve. Such a trainer will also insist that the handler who fails appropriately to praise or correct her dog is guilty of a similar failing. Your wandering attention may well bring it about that you fail to praise your dog's good work, but it provides no excuse for doing so.</p>
         <p>Clothier correctly maintains that not even trainers insisting on off-lead reliability will—unless they want to train for that sort of thing—correct their dog for deciding to break off a retrieve to deal with his handler's being attacked mid-exercise by a lunatic. But such a decision indicates something about the dog's unreliability in the relevant sense <italic>only</italic> if we conflate, as she seems to do, reliability and predictability.<sup>8</sup> Contrary to what she maintains, we may speak of a dog being 100 percent reliable without committing ourselves to the view that there are <italic>no</italic> circumstances in which it may reasonably decide to do something other than complete a retrieve. Similarly, if I tell you that I am trustworthy, I am telling you that you can take my word, but I am not telling you that there <italic>cannot</italic> be circumstances in which I will decide I must break it. If in the future I do decide to break my word, we will have to determine how that decision affects our relationship. Certainly, I cannot break it just like that and continue to consider myself trustworthy. But it adds only confusion to respond to a broken promise by saying, “Look, I'm only 98 percent trustworthy. What can you do? Nobody's perfect.”</p>
         <p>If we insist on this distinction between reliability and predictability, we can see through the confusion expressed in Clothier's thought that any failure to retrieve indicates that the dog is something less than 100 percent reliable. If I say that my dog is reliable, I mean that I can count on it, not that it can intelligibly respond to the demands of the situation in only one way. “Reliability,” after all, is derived from the word “rely,” which means “to bind together.” It refers, therefore, to an aspect of relationship or mutuality. By contrast, we speak of “predictability” where questions of mutuality have not arisen. This is why certain failures of obedience can be considered breaches of trust. And it is why, pace Clothier, I can acknowledge such failures without having to give up talk of 100 percent reliability as the aim of training.</p>
         <p>Trainers, then, who insist on off-lead reliability maintain that trustworthiness is the goal of training, and they think of such trustworthiness as a form of mutuality, a kind of community between dog and handler. It is in this sense that the trainer wants to insist on obedience as the end or goal of training rather than the means to some further end.</p>

         <title>II</title>
         <p>It is time to make good on my promise that clarity about the trainer's notion of reliability would shed light on the distinction Nietzsche draws between individuality and the herd and thereby help us begin to make sense of the difference, as he sees it, between guilt and responsibility. Nietzsche characterizes the former distinction as that between having and not having “the right to make promises” (<italic>GM</italic> II:1). Promising here is a figure for speaking. To have what Nietzsche calls the right to make promises is to be, in the sense we have been exploring, a <italic>reliable</italic> speaker. Reliability, as before, refers to an aspect of relationship or community.<sup>9</sup> As we will see presently, Nietzsche himself treats reliability as a mark of community just as does the dog trainer who insists on it.</p>
         <p>At the beginning of <italic>GM</italic> II:2, Nietzsche characterizes the right to make promises in terms of the notion of responsibility and goes on to suggest that that notion has its proper home in a conception of community. The basic idea is simply that taking responsibility for what one says functions as the condition of the possibility of communication and, in that sense, of community. When speakers fail to honor the obligations of speech, the result is something less than community—what Nietzsche generally refers to as a “herd.” This distinction is absolutely crucial to making sense of what Nietzsche says next. The responsible speaker—the animal with the right to make promises—“possesses his <italic>measure of value</italic>: looking out upon others from himself, he honors or he despises; and just as he is bound to honor his peers [die ihm Gleichen] […] he is bound to reserve a kick for the feeble windbags [Windhunde] who promise without the right to do so” (<italic>GM</italic> II:2). Brief as they are, these remarks seem to me to provide one of Nietzsche's most useful examples of the twin marks of community on which he always insists: pathos of distance and order of rank. Honoring and despising in this context are both, Nietzsche says, “necessary” (“nothwendig”), not optional, as though a more tolerant individual might allow for different sorts of relationships to one's words. According to Nietzsche, responsible speakers consider both themselves and their “peers” <italic>fundamentally</italic> different from irresponsible speakers and <italic>necessarily</italic> better than them. There is, in Nietzsche's view, no room for responsible speakers to say that their and their peers' way of speaking is just one way among many, no better and no worse than the herd's, as though their humanity were a hobby they might take up or set down at will. This is not something a human being can <italic>say</italic>. An individual cannot, in this sense, treat himself or herself as optional—though, in Nietzsche's view, precisely this is true of most of us. As we live now, our lives are mostly no more than “accident, fragment and riddle” (<italic>Z</italic>:II “On Redemption”). Similarly, trainers who insist on reliability cannot meaningfully say that their training relationship with their dog is just one among many, no better and no worse than others—though, in the trainer's view, this is precisely true of most people and their dogs. And this is why a trainer who insists on reliability will typically resist the suggestion that training simply makes a dog “useful” for various purposes (though it is certainly true that dogs can be trained to work in useful ways) or that training is a form of behavior management.<sup>10</sup>
         </p>
         <p>But the passage at hand tells us more than just this much about Nietzsche's conception of community. He himself insists on the notion of reliability in this context. The responsible speaker's peers are
<disp-quote>
               <p>the strong and reliable [Zuverlässigen] (those with the <italic>right</italic> to make promises [die welche versprechen <italic>dürfen</italic>])—that is, all those who promise like sovereigns, reluctantly, rarely, slowly, who are chary of trusting [mit seinem Vertrauen geizt], whose trust is a mark of <italic>distinction</italic> [der <italic>auszeichnet</italic>, wenn er vertraut], who give their word as something that can be relied upon [der sein Wort giebt als Etwas, auf das Verlass ist] […]. (<italic>GM</italic> II:2)</p>
            </disp-quote>
Clearly, then, the responsible speaker's peers—those with whom he or she lives in community (with whom he or she communicates)—are the reliable, trustworthy ones: die Zuverlässigen. These are contrasted with those “who promise without the right to do so [welche versprechen, ohne es zu dürfen]” (<italic>GM</italic> II:2). To be a member of this latter group is to be “a liar who breaks his word even at the moment he utters it” (<italic>GM</italic> II:2)—a remark intended to echo Emerson's complaint in “Self-Reliance” that our “conformity makes [us] not false in a few particulars, authors of a few lies, but false in all particulars.”<sup>11</sup>
         </p>
         <p>I stress Nietzsche's commitment to community in these remarks in part because recent critical work on his thought reflects uneasiness with his talk in this passage of the “sovereign individual's” “power over [him]self and over fate” (<italic>GM</italic> II:2). For example, Simon May contends that the sovereign individual's “aim at … autonomy would arguably be yet another symptom of the urge to be insulated from contingency,” and he argues further that the individual's supposed autonomy would be undesirable anyway, since such self-containment as it seems to May to represent would mean that the individual's “self-overcoming” would cease, and “when overcoming comes to an end so too does a worthwhile life.”<sup>12</sup> Similarly, Lawrence Hatab maintains that “Nietzsche rejects [the] modernist model of an individual, unified, substantive, autonomous, rationally ordered human nature. The self is not an enduring substance, not a unified subject that grounds attributes, that stands ‘behind’ or even distinct from performance.”<sup>13</sup>
         </p>
         <p>Hatab argues, more specifically, that “‘individualism’ is disrupted by the fact that most of what we recognize as human is a social [and, hence, linguistic] phenomenon.”<sup>14</sup> Individualism is also, he insists, at odds with what he refers to as Nietzsche's “agonistic psychology,” which construes a person as ever only a temporarily stable arrangement of drives and affects continually (and, hopefully, productively) struggling for dominance over each other.</p>
         <p>The worry of commentators such as May and Hatab seems very generally to be that Nietzsche's emphasis in the <italic>Genealogy</italic> on the individual's autonomy is at odds with his insistence elsewhere both on the interconnectedness of everything and on the irrational elements of human life. Further, the recommendation of individualism as an ideal worth emulating seems at odds with a reading of Nietzsche's fatalism like Brian Leiter's, according to which who one is is largely determined by what type of person one is, the type of person one is being fixed by natural facts outside one's control.<sup>15</sup> From these perspectives, the emphasis in the <italic>Genealogy</italic> on reliability and Nietzsche's talk of the responsible speaker's “mastery over himself” and “over circumstances, over nature, and over all more short-willed and unreliable creatures” seems to slide dangerously close to a conception of freedom of will incompatible with Nietzsche's conception of us as fully embodied, fully historical beings (<italic>GM</italic> II:2). Thus, I take it, Nietzsche's talk in the <italic>Genealogy</italic> of the sovereign individual's self-mastery would seem to these readers to clash with Nietzsche's insistence early in <italic>Beyond Good and Evil</italic> that
<disp-quote>
               <p>the <italic>causa sui</italic> is the best self-contradiction that has been conceived so far, it is a sort of rape and perversion of logic […]. The desire for “freedom of the will” in the superlative metaphysical sense[, …] the desire to bear the entire and ultimate responsibility for one's actions oneself, and to absolve God, the world, ancestors, chance, and society involves nothing less than to be precisely this <italic>causa sui</italic> and, with more than <italic>Münchhausen's</italic> audacity, to pull oneself up into existence by the hair, out of the swamps of nothingness. (<italic>BGE</italic> 21).</p>
            </disp-quote>
Some commentators go so far as to take the apparent friction here as grounds for rejecting readings of the <italic>Genealogy</italic> that treat sovereign individuality as expressing “Nietzsche's ideal of a self-creating individual in contrast to the herd.”<sup>16</sup> It should be clear from what I have said so far, however, that the reliability that characterizes the animal with the right to make promises is far indeed from the sort of metaphysical autonomy Nietzsche rightly rejects in <italic>Beyond Good and Evil</italic> and elsewhere. The reliable speaker—and, hence, Nietzsche's conception of community—is fully historical in a number of important senses. First, responsibility is something that Nietzsche considers possible only at a particular point in the Western historical tradition (the death of God) and that would make little sense outside that context. He may be wrong about this (after all, people trained dogs before the end of the nineteenth century), but it seems to be a view to which he is firmly committed. But reliability is also fully historical in a second—call it “Emersonian”—sense; namely, it is only by taking responsibility for what one says that one adequately acknowledges that what one says has consequences that extend through time. Moreover, the individual's “entry” into history is, in this sense, possible only as an entry into community with others. In this sense, most of us live <italic>un</italic>historical lives: not in a timeless metaphysical eternity but in the interminable daily routine of the herd.</p>
         <p>It is the first sense of “reliability” to which the bulk of the second essay of the <italic>Genealogy</italic> is devoted. Although a detailed examination of the second essay's long and complicated genealogy of a person who is finally capable of turning his or her bad conscience against itself and learning to feel guilty about feeling guilty about himself or herself is beyond the scope of my remarks here, let me nevertheless say a bit more about the <italic>second</italic> sense of history that Nietzsche invokes in the essay. To appreciate what is at stake here, we need to understand the difference between Nietzsche's sense of autonomy and the metaphysical one that is indeed at odds with the genealogical story the <italic>Genealogy</italic> tells about the meaning of sin. It is in this context, in particular, that the dog trainer's perspective may be helpful.</p>
         <p>Reliability, he says, is “the real problem regarding man.” Our transition from animality to humanity depends on our becoming reliable in this sense. But Nietzsche claims that reliability demands what he calls “a real <italic>memory of the will</italic> [ein eigentliches <italic>Gedächtniss des Willens</italic>]: so that between the original ‘I will,’ ‘I shall do this’ and the actual discharge of the will, its act, a world of strange new things, circumstances, even acts of will may be interposed without breaking this long chain of will” (<italic>GM</italic> II:1). The trainer insisting on reliability will understand Nietzsche's suggestion here to be that most of us in fact lack such a memory and that our forgetfulness in this sense ruins our reliability. We issue commands (“Fetch!,” “Come!,” “Down!,” “Stay!”) but fail to remember that doing so obliges us as much as our dogs. For example, although unfortunate, the following situation is not at all far-fetched: I place my dog on a down stay and then go about writing this article. The phone rings in the other room, and I get up to have a long-overdue conversation with an old friend. Ten minutes later, my dog comes to where I am standing and flops down at my feet, lays his head flat on the floor and looks away from me. The moment is complicated. I have trained my dog to do out-of-sight stays for longer than this. But I have, as I realize, forgotten that I'd left him on a stay at all. Assuming, therefore, that I do not fail to recognize his actions as a reminder and a rebuke, do I correct him for breaking his stay? Obviously not. But there is no happy solution to this problem. In my absent-mindedness, I have clearly let him down. In these circumstances, my dog has every right to be disappointed in my unreliability, and a refusal to recognize that disappointment only adds insult to injury.</p>
         <p>The trainer insisting on reliability has no time for handlers inclined to complain that my talk here of canine disappointment is rank anthropomorphism. Only a skepticism that confuses predictability with reliability will countenance loneliness as the only plausible account of my dog's willingness to break his stay. Ascribing disappointment to my dog in this context does not depend on attributing an especially complex inner life to him; it is rather part of the vocabulary trainers insist on in order to understand their own and their dog's obligations. If I ignore my failure here and try to correct the dog back into his down stay, I run the risk of justifiable rebellion in response, something that never happens when a correction is fair. And if I take my failure personally (if I confuse guilt with responsibility), the dog will simply have to wait to get back to work while I berate myself for being such a bad handler. My sense of <italic>guilt</italic> has, properly speaking, nothing to do with him. By contrast, my <italic>responsibility</italic> is to make damned sure it doesn't happen again.</p>
         <p>Whether I <italic>can</italic> make sure it doesn't happen again is up to no one but me, and there is no such thing as doing so “once and for all.” This is why Nietzsche is willing to talk about “abysses” in this context. The handler who takes responsibility for his commands has indeed audaciously bootstrapped himself out of a swamp of nothingness. But the nothingness in question is that of the weak-willed herd, not that of the metaphysician. It makes sense to talk of an abyss in this context not because there is metaphysical groundlessness that must be confronted but rather because no one can do the business of meaning what I say for me. Nietzsche is everywhere on the alert for our tendency to intellectualize the latter fact into the former pseudo-problem. Doing so disburdens us of the task of living and keeps us in our comfortable prehuman, animal state.</p>
         <p>Such is the nature of what Nietzsche calls “the extraordinary privilege of <italic>responsibility</italic>, […] this rare freedom, this power over oneself and over fate” (<italic>GM</italic> II:1). As far as I can see, there is no reason at all to saddle Nietzsche here with a <italic>metaphysical</italic> conception of freedom of will. Indeed, later in the aphorism in which the passage about the <italic>causa sui</italic> appears, Nietzsche goes on to say that we should reject as nonsensical the traditional dichotomy between free will and determinism and replace it with a distinction between “<italic>strong</italic> and <italic>weak</italic> wills” (<italic>BGE</italic> 21). It is only a foolish commentator's consistency that would insist that he must be contradicting himself when in <italic>The Gay Science</italic> he expresses his hope for a “pleasure and power of self-determination [and] a <italic>freedom</italic> of will” (<italic>GS</italic> 347). That his hopes may be vain is a human problem, not a metaphysical conundrum.</p>

      <sec id="s04">
         <title>III</title>
         <p>As I have indicated, <italic>On the Genealogy of Morals</italic> tells a long story about the origins of our moralized sense of guilt. This is the part of Nietzsche's discussion that seems most clearly to foreshadow Freud's account of the origins of morality in <italic>Civilization and Its Discontents</italic>. For both thinkers, what begins as a reasonable sense of the risks to which one's instincts expose one's life in community turns eventually into self-recrimination and a sense of oneself as <italic>fundamentally</italic> flawed. In effect, one passes from the thought that one must be careful not to try to satisfy these instinctual demands (both Nietzsche and Freud seem to have aggression in mind) to the thought that one is worthless because one has these instinctual demands at all. The transition from the first thought to the second is, on Nietzsche's account, more mysterious than it might at first appear. Only a person who <italic>needs</italic> to think of himself or herself as fundamentally flawed would be inclined to condemn himself or herself in such a way, and Nietzsche offers us no real account of why anyone would need to think of himself or herself like that. We can think of this as the problem of explaining the <italic>appeal</italic> of Christianity, which Nietzsche tries to solve by suggesting that it has provided the only compelling interpretation of human suffering so far: namely, we suffer because we deserve to. This account is of a piece with Nietzsche's apparent conviction that the world contains two types of people (with various mixtures between these extremes): those who suffer from their suffering and those who do not.</p>
         <p>But the dog trainer will be less concerned with the details of Nietzsche's genealogy of our sense of sinfulness than with his or her conception of the way out of the impasse it represents. Nietzsche writes,
<disp-quote>
               <p>Man has all too long had an “evil eye” for his natural inclinations, so that they have finally become inseparable from his “bad conscience.” An attempt at the reverse would in itself be possible […]—that is, to wed [verschwistern] the bad conscience to all the <italic>unnatural</italic> inclinations, all those aspirations to the beyond, to that which runs counter to sense, instinct, nature, animal, in short all ideals hitherto, which are one and all hostile to life and ideals that slander the world. (<italic>GM</italic> II:24)</p>
            </disp-quote>
It is the bit here about binding the bad conscience to our unnatural inclinations—learning, in effect, to feel guilty about feeling guilty about oneself—that is likely to catch the trainer's eye. For it is just this that handlers learn as they learn the discipline of reliability.</p>
         <p>Some commentators find that Nietzsche's thought about the individual's learning to feel guilty about his or her guilt represents no progress at all. Aaron Ridley, for example, considers the whole notion of sovereign individuality nothing more than “a fancy, a morale booster, not a solution,” “a rather misty, if beautiful, kind of hope for man's future, as a wish, the vaguest prophecy.”<sup>17</sup> Judith Butler goes further and considers such sovereignty not just vacuous but to represent a conceptual impossibility because, in her view, there can be no “model of promising that does not from the first presuppose bad conscience.”<sup>18</sup> But Ridley's complaint that individuality is vague or Butler's thought that it is impossible because it is rooted in guilt both seem to me to beg the question of whether the sovereign individual's sense of responsibility demands the sort of metaphysical purity of which both Ridley and Butler are understandably wary. Certainly, the claim that individuality—understood here as reliability—is a <italic>conceptual</italic> impossibility will strike the trainer insisting on it as the intellectualization of a human (call it “existential”) problem. As Vicki Hearne points out, “The trainer has occasion to be aware, as few people are, that human authority is corrupt to the core, and that any trope of ascendancy—especially the trope of nobility—stinks of the immodest, the self-righteous and the sadistic. Yet the trainer must get on with training the dog. The dog is compellingly present.”<sup>19</sup> The trainer insists that our refusal to take responsibility for what we say makes <italic>us</italic> vague, and the thought that it is <italic>in principle</italic> impossible to take responsibility for what one says will strike him or her as pure evasion. Let me offer the following anecdote in illustration.</p>
         <p>Several years ago, Ruth requested a trainer's help training her pit bull pup Daisy. Daisy is a dog of exceptional talents with a truly visionary temperament. The story I want to tell here is about reliability in heeling specifically, so I need finally to say something about how training for that exercise actually proceeds. Training for this command aims to put the handler in a position to say meaningfully, “Daisy, heel!” Prior to training, uttering those words is meaningless, not in the sense that the words mean something that the dog fails to understand but in the sense that, prior to training, the handler means nothing by them. Meaning in this sense becomes possible in three steps: placing, teaching, and training.</p>
         <p>
            <italic>Placing</italic>. For twenty minutes twice a day for a week, Ruth brings Daisy on a six-foot leash and choke collar to a place with as few distractions (i.e., birds, balls, other dogs, boys on skateboards, and so on) as possible. Once there, she stands with Daisy to her left, standing or in a sit (Daisy's choice). From a stationary start, Ruth drops the hand that holds the leash from her belly to her right hip, steps calmly forward with her left foot, and begins to walk in whatever direction she and Daisy were facing when they started. As she steps forward, she says, “Daisy, heel!” as brightly as she can. Because the leash has been lowered by Ruth's moving her right hand to her hip, she will catch it somewhere between her knee and the instep of her left foot as she begins walking. Daisy will therefore hear “Daisy, heel!” at exactly the moment the leash gently pulls her into motion. If Daisy runs ahead of Ruth, Ruth will make a quick about-turn and move off in exactly the opposite direction. Because the leash passes to her left, Daisy will find herself back in the heel position with Ruth to her right. If Daisy lags behind, Ruth will simply run forward, with the same result.</p>
         <p>
            <italic>Teaching</italic>. After a week of placing using this exercise, Ruth is ready for the first time to give the command, “Heel!” As before, she puts herself to Daisy's right, but this time does not drop the lead to her hip. She simply says, “Daisy, heel!” and marches off. When Daisy moves off smartly with her, Ruth lavishes her with praise for work well done. Without the time spent placing Daisy in the heel, there would have been no work to do and nothing to praise. If Daisy's attention wanders, Ruth will move from a walk to a run and propel Daisy forward into the heel position at her left. This part of the training is done, again, with as few distractions as possible.</p>
         <p>
            <italic>Training</italic>. At this point, Ruth and Daisy are ready to begin the real task of dog training: working with distractions. Over the next several weeks, Ruth will present Daisy with increasingly demanding distractions—the boys, birds, and balls they avoided earlier. Each time, Daisy is offered a choice between Ruth's company and whatever distraction can be provided. They will work gradually; with most dogs, other dogs are the greatest distraction, so they work with them after mastering the birds and boys. But in every case, the practice is the same: Daisy will be presented with a distraction and praised to the skies for choosing Ruth's company instead and corrected (by Ruth's quick dashes in the opposite direction) for choosing anything else. And each time she chooses something other than Ruth's company, Daisy will be given a chance to make the right choice after a correction for the wrong one. Eventually, all this work will be repeated off the leash until Daisy is reliable working that way.</p>
         <p>Let us return to the anecdote. Ruth and Daisy have been working this way for several weeks, but Daisy is still extremely distractible. The trainer understands her difficulty as the result of Daisy's not being given a clear choice between the distractions with which she is presented and her handler's company. As a result, Ruth's corrections are ineffective, and Daisy's heeling is spotty at best. Praise in these circumstances is impossible. One day after a desultory session practicing the heel down a city sidewalk, Ruth lets it be known that she is feeling tremendously guilty about failing her dog. She feels (rightly) that she is letting her dog down, but she has no idea how to proceed. As she is telling her trainer all this, Daisy watches intently as a bumblebee hovers around a patch of weeds next to the sidewalk, and the trainer watches her watching. Occupied as—and in the way—she is with her failings, Ruth naturally sees none of this. When she works Daisy at this point in her training, her attention is focused entirely on—indeed, <italic>at</italic>—her dog, ready, as it were, to pounce with the correction that she thinks will solve all her problems. And yet there is no community between them, so “nothing works.”</p>
         <p>To get Ruth out of her head and into community with Daisy, the trainer recommends that she start seeing the bumblebees, boys, and whatnot <italic>before</italic> Daisy does. As Ruth starts off (“one last time,” she says) down the sidewalk with her attention opened to the world, Daisy's interest in bumblebees and the rest evaporates. Just like that. No tugging, cajoling, or pleading. No corrections. It is a moment of some delicacy, an adequate description of which will have to await another occasion. Reliability has begun because Ruth is now present as company. The transformation is striking, and it is far from permanent. Ruth's future is full of self-overcoming, and her authority is never “pure.” But Daisy now knows what she needs to know: that her handler can be company. And the only thing that has made this sort of responsibility possible, I suggest, is Ruth's learning how to feel guilty about feeling guilty, her coming to understand how she has moralized her failings as a handler. This is the transition from guilt to responsibility, as the trainer understands it.</p>

         <p>“Guilt” is Nietzsche's name for a person's sense that nothing about his or her life alone could conceivably anchor meaning to the world. Meaning seems possible only on the basis of something that transcends the details of one's human, all-too human life. “Conscience,” by contrast, is his name for a sense of responsibility that has grown to be a person's “dominating instinct.” I have suggested that the trainer who demands reliability would greet skepticism about the very possibility of a transition from guilt to responsibility as an expression of an intellectualization of a human problem. We can see better now what this means. Nothing at all <italic>guarantees</italic> that handlers will let themselves become company for their dog. Handlers often remain unavailable for their dogs. <italic>This</italic> particular “swamp of nothingness” is a human, all-too human, possibility. But the absence of any guarantee here is precisely the aspect of reliability on which I have been insisting: no one can do the business of meaning for you. Such, Nietzsche might say, is life.</p>
