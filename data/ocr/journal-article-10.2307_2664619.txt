One may think, for instance, of methods for analyzing the basic molecular units of heredity; of proposals and clarifications of the appropriate methods of classifying organisms; of exciting new ideas about the nature of the fossil record and their implications for the elucidation of evolutionary mechanisms; and of ways in which the biological study of behavior has been extended, theoretically and experimentally, and of supposed implications for humankind. To add to these internal issues, the outside world has also seen much debate on biology &amp;ndash; in the world of education, for instance. These and other issues have made biology one of the most exhilarating areas of science, and have aroused in biologists and philosophers an awareness that there is a need for meta-theoretical analysis, both about the very nature of biology, as well as about its social implications. Biologyand Philosophyis aimed at a broad readership, drawn from both the sciences and the humanities. The journal subscribes to no specific school of biology, nor of philosophy, and publishes work from authors of all persuasions and all disciplines. The editorial board reflects this attitude in its composition and its world-wide membership. Each issue of Biology and Philosophy carries one or more discussions or comparative reviews, permitting the in-depth study of important works and topics. 'Biology and Philosophy has started well ...it will perform a genuine service... this is a journal that no thoughtful biologist should ignore.'

Snyder Publisher: The University of Chicago Press Sponsor: Division of Comparative Physiology and Biochemistry, SICB Since 1928 Physiological and Biochemical Zoology (formerly Physiological Zoology) has presented current research results in environmental, adaptational, and comparative physiology and biochemistry. Providing a rich forum for scholars, scientists, and students from around the world, PBZ's sponsorship by the Division of Comparative Physiology and Biochemistry of the Society for Integrative and Comparative Biology indicates its commitment to quality and ensures that the material you read meets rigorous academic standards. Published bimonthly, Physiological Zoology began publication under its new title-Physiological and Biochemical Zoology-in January 1999. This title change does not alter the focus or editorial direction of the journal, but rather, conveys more accurately the journal's traditional emphasis on original research in environmental, adaptational, and comparative physiology and biochemistry. Today, Physiological and Biochemical Zoology continues to present relevant and significant scientific inquiry. Articles published in PBZ-both field and laboratory based-are drawn from an impressive roster of international contributors from a broad range of specialty fields. The journal's research papers and essays generate thought-provoking perspectives, debate, and commentary in such areas as: evolutionary physiology nutrition and digestion temperature adaptation sensory physiology acid base balance osmotic and ionic regulation respiration neural coordination metabolic physiology and biochemistry With a new title and the launch of its electronic edition-accessible via the world-wide web at http://www.journals.uchicago.edu/PBZ-Physiological and Biochemical Zoology ushers in a new era in 1999. Readers now have immediate access to the latest investigations right from their desktops.

ROBERT SHIRRELL, Journals Manager</page><page sequence="22">INSTRUCTIONS TO AUTHORS OF REVIEW ARTICLES HE REVIEW ARTICLES published by The Quarterly Review of Biology are intended primarily for the informed general biologist. Manuscripts should both present a summary and critical j evaluation of significant investigations and provide suggestions for further research. Theo- retical papers should clearly identify the focus of study, review the relevant literature, and develop approaches to new levels of understanding. An article should be written in concise and sufficiently nontechnical language to be intelligible both to general biologists and to specialists in other fields. Interpretive diagrams are desirable. Since space is severely limited, most articles longer than 20 journal pages (approximately 50 double-spaced manuscript pages or their equivalent in bibliographic or illustrative matter) will be returned for shortening. An article must be preceded by a brief abstract that summarizes the principal conclusions of the paper. In most matters of style, conformity to the guidelines in Scientific Style and Format: The CBE Manualfor Authors, Editors, and Publishers, Sixth Edition, published by Cambridge University Press (40 West 20th Street, NewYork NY 10011- 4211) is recommended. Recent issues should be used as a model for style with respect to (1) section headings in the text, (2) literature citations in the text, and (3) list of references; a detailed set of instructions may be requested from the journal office. If possible, lines should be numbered consecutively throughout the manuscript. Reference citations should be limited to those essential for documenting specific statements. Journal titles used in the list of references should not be abbreviated. Each entry should give the full title and inclusive page numbers of the article cited. Authors should provide photocopies of all quoted passages, including page numbers. Footnotes to textual material are not permitted, but explanatory material of special interest may be set off in the text in small print. Send glossy prints of illustrations, but do not send original artwork until requested to do so. Authors who acknowledge assistance by a funding agency with a policy of publication support will be expected to meet charges of $40 per journal page for each of the first 20 journal pages. Authors not supported by funding agencies and authors of invited articles are eligible for 20 free journal pages. All authors are charged $80 for each page above 20. An original and two copies of all manuscripts submitted for consideration should be sent to The Editors, The Quarterly Review of Biology, 110 Life Sciences Library, State University of New york, Stony Brook NY 11794-5275, accompanied by a computer disk containing the article in IBM-compatible format.
