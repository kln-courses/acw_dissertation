<plain_text><page sequence="1">SPECIAL CREATION AND ORGANIC EVOLUTION NORMAN D. NEWELL' Chairman and Curator, Department of Invertebrate Paleontology, American Museum of Natural History (Read April 19, 1973) RESURGENCE OF CREATIONISM FOURTEEN YEARS AGO the American Philo- sophical Society held a symposium on organic evolution to commemorate the centenary of Darwin's little book on evolution by natural selection, The Origin of Species. At that time, we congratulated ourselves on truly remarkable progress toward an understanding of the evi- dence of the unity of organic nature and the mechanics of evolutionary changes. By that time evolution was widely accepted as the per- vasive principle that integrates organismic biol- ogy and historical geology. Evolution provided meaning to the classification of organisms ac- cording to their demonstrated or inferred rela- tionships and it provided the basis for chrono- logic classification of stratigraphy on which much of geological history is based. Now, there has always been some resistance on religious grounds to the idea of man's kin- ship with nature and this was a favorite subject of discussion in the nineteenth century. For example, George Perkins Marsh, a contempo- rary of Darwin, concluded his Man and Nature (1864) with the words "The collection of phe- nomena must precede the analysis of them, and every new fact, illustrative of the reaction be- tween humanity and the natural world around it, is another step toward the determination of the great question whether man is of nature or above her." But most literate persons had perceived that while anthropomorphic inter- pretations of nature may be instinctive and therefore universal, they provide a very dis- torted and inaccurate view of man's role in the universe and they could lead to his downfall. Man's kinship with other organisms is now self- evident to all who will see. This was Darwin's greatest gift to humanity. 1 I am pleased to acknowledge helpful suggestions about the manuscript of this paper by my wife, Gillian, and several colleagues at the American Museum of Natural History, Professor John J. Lee of the City College of New York, and Professor Ernst Mayr, Harvard University. We are in the midst of an atavistic revival of the primitive idea of the supernatural creation of individual species, especially man (Wade, 1972). This revival is riding a more general wave of antirationalism characterized by emo- tionalism, mysticism, astrology, and other occult arts, and is accompanied by widespread mistrust of the objectivity which is the foundation of science and reason. The rise of creationism in what Hobart Smith (1973) terms "polarization of evolutionary and religious thought" is shown by an almost in- credible flood of literature on the subject mainly by fundamentalist and quasi-fundamentalist re- ligious sects and by the birth and growth of a Creation Research Society. A few charac- teristic examples of recent publications are by Gish (1970) (ably answered by Harvard evolu- tionist Ernst Mayr [1971]), Frank Lewis Marsh (1963), Zimmerman (1970, 1972) and books and magazines, e.g., Anonymous, 1967, Did Man Get Here by Evolution or Creation? published by the Watchtower Bible and Tract Society of Pennsylvania. Publications of this society are distributed at less than cost in editions reaching many millions and translated into all the major and many of the minor languages of the world. This literature is not an analysis and ration- alization of the creationist arguments, but rather it is a massive attack on the methods, assump- tions, and limitations of scientific knowledge in biology and geology. Such an attack could be highly beneficial if it were an objective critique of scientific errors accompanied by constructive suggestions for improving scientific knowledge. Unhappily, science is presented to the unwary reader as an entrenched and ultraconservative establishment. Many of the components of scientific knowl- edge are inherently controversial at some stage in their development. The creationist litera- ture, stressing selected examples of this uncer- tainty, cites obsolete quotations many of which PROCEEDINGS OF THE AMERICAN PHILOSOPHICAL SOCIETY, VOL. 117, NO. 4, AUGUST 1973 323</page><page sequence="2">324 NORMAN D. NEWELL [PROC. AMER. PHIL. SOC. are taken out of context. The purpose clearly is to demonstrate that the students of evolution are and have always been divided or confused. It is a disservice to the non-technical reader to argue that science or any facet of human knowledge to be valuable should be unanimous, complete, unchanging and infallible. The crea- tionists offer the reader a choice between the "certainty" which they attribute to the Book of Genesis or the uncertainty and fluidity of imperfect scientific knowledge which inevitably must be modified to incorporate new discoveries. The realm of observations in which the scientist operates admits only evidence received through his senses and analyzed by the logic by which he evaluates, selects, and reasons. This demand for certainty in science shows an egregious misunderstanding of the aims and methods of science, which, although dedicated to the search for truth, regards all truth as relative and elusive. Much scientific knowledge is empirical and cumulative, and all is subject to improvement and self-correction. It does not depend on tradition, consensus, opinion, or taste. What is unique in the "scientific method" is the continuous interplay between observed facts and abstract ideas. Traditional knowledge on the other hand resists change and much of it is inherently authoritarian. The scientist is trained to be suspicious of tradition because experience shows that claims of certainty usually are unreliable. On the other hand, statistical probability is a basic principle of modern science and it works! It is ultimately responsible for most of the tech- nological achievements of civilization. We are dealing with a familiar nostaglia, the idea that civilization is a disease, the only pos- sible cure for which is a return to the old ways, the simple, more primitive life. This idea fre- quently is attributed to Jean Jacques Rousseau, but it is ancient and universal and recurs periodically through history. The idea of super- natural creation of life pervades the folklore and religions of virtually all human cultures. This explanation of life is attractive because it answers universal questions and is simple and direct. Basically, it stems from popular views about design and purpose in nature. However, apart from the questions of improbability and non-testability of creationism as a formal hy- pothesis, this explanation of life is intellectually stultifying, because it discourages investigation into man's origin. Intellectual curiosity, usually regarded as one of man's sublime traits, is viewed by some as inimical to religious tradi- tion and, of course, to authoritarian knowledge. Questions of a first cause in the cosmos, the ultimate origin of energy and matter, probably are beyond the reach of science, but few scien- tists object to the idea of a real origin at some point in time. If the cosmos is the product of a supernatural creative act then the theo- logian cannot reasonably object to the proposi- tion that God's preferred method of creating and operating His cosmos is by natural laws. If God occasionally were to revoke these laws on divine impulse, that would be the business of God and the theologian, not the scientist. The scientist cannot subject the supernatural to objective tests. But there need not be any conflict between rational evolutionists and ra- tional theologians since their fields of compe- tence are mutually exclusive. Thoughtful persons will be interested in the point of view expressed by J. Franklin Ewing: The old-fashioned dependence on the immediately verbal exegesis has given way to an appreciation of the "literary form" of Holy Writ. We are be- coming increasingly aware of the fact that the human authors of the Bible used story, parable and statement in keeping with the cultural dic- tates of the Near East; the most important thing, therefore, is to determine what religious lesson is proposed in any section of the Bible, not as in a modern scientific textbook, but as in a document that is at once very human and divine. (Ewing, 1960: p. 27.) Creationism, already deeply entrenched in Tennessee, has tried to invade the public schools of California (Wade, 1972). The California State Board of Education, an agency that cer- tifies textbooks for the elementary schools of that state, has tried to require science teachers to present creationism along with evolution as a plausible alternative "theory" of man's origin (e.g., Lucas, 1973). Teachers and scientists of California and Tennessee, and the National Association of Biology Teachers, have mobilized against what they regard as a threat to aca- demic freedom, and perhaps an unconstitutional intrusion of religion into their classrooms. Certainly, a formal approval of supernaturalism as a serious alternative to rationalism in public school curricula should stimulate widespread attention by educators. The position of political and educational leaders in the two states has been protested by many leading scholars, including many Nobel</page><page sequence="3">VOL. 117, NO. 4, 19731 SPECIAL CREATION AND ORGANIC EVOLUTION 325 laureates, and the membership of the National Academy of Sciences. It was the considered belief of the National Academy that the result of including creationism in otherwise non-reli- gious textbooks would be to impair the proper segregation of the teaching and understanding of science and religion. That body of distin- guished scholars holds that the foundations of science must exclude appeal to supernatural causes not susceptible to validation by objective criteria. Science and religion being mutually exclusive realms of human thought, their pre- sentation in the same context is likely to lead to misunderstanding of both scientific theory and religious belief. THE STRATIGRAPHIC SEQUENCE OF FOSSILS More than a century ago, Charles Darwin was concerned about the fact that fossil remains of animals and plants in the earth's crust yielded very few examples of gradual evolu- tionary change of the sort that his theory seemed to require. The creationists made much of this incompleteness of the record. Although their argument long since has been rendered obsolete by continued discoveries of connecting links they still argue that discontinuities in the fossil record support the idea of instantaneous special creation of each kind of animals and plants either singly or by episodes. Discovery of fossil representatives of the myriads of major and minor groups of organisms depends on very many chance factors so that complete repre- sentation of past life, even under the most favorable circumstances, is highly improbable. Nevertheless, even before Darwin's day, ge- ologists had learned to identify geologic ages of strata by their distinctive assemblages of fossil remains of organisms virtually all of which were extinct. The major outline of a universal geologic time scale was completed and routinely employed all over the world for the correlation of events on the separate continents and for compiling a geologic history of the globe. The facts of the chronologic sequence of animals and plants were compiled empirically; they are not deductions based on theories or premises. Hundreds of successive fossil assemblages of land and sea organisms, virtually all but the youngest of which are extinct, have been traced and are employed in systematic mapping of useful deposits of rocks, minerals, and fuels. One interpretation of the stratigraphic se- quence of fossils frequently advanced in the Arthropods (Including Insects) 57.4% MO 1uscs 7.3% species of ana Higher Plants t 19.6% FIG. 1. This diagram illustrates the percentages of living species of animals and plants that have been studied and named. The total number is estimated at around one and a half to two million species but they are thought to constitute only about one-fifth to one-tenth of those that are still living. Estimates that include all the species that ever lived are as high as one-half billion. Explanation: Higher plants: gymnosperms and angiosperms; lower plants: ferns, mosses, fungi and slime molds; other invertebrates: annelids, nematodes, flatworms, brachiopods, echinoderms, bryozoans, rotifers, coelenterates, sponges, and others; chordates: tunicates, prochordates, vertebrates. years before Darwin required hundreds of epi- sodes of creation of new faunas and floras similar to, but different from, those below and above, episodes that were set apart by hundreds of catastrophes that eliminated all life on both land and sea. Most modern creationists ded- icated to a literal interpretation of the Book of Genesis prefer not to extrapolate so far from the Scriptures as to suggest a vast number of episodes of special creation spread over several billions of years of geologic time. The Scrip- tures do not hint at thousands of episodes of creation, and the creationists ignore the dilemma. Even early in the nineteenth century, ge- ologists were well aware that fossilization must be a rare accident limited to hard skeletal structures such as bones and shells. Fleshy organisms without resistant parts rarely are preserved. For example insects (fig. 1) con- stitute about three-quarters of all organisms</page><page sequence="4">326 NORMAN D. NEWELL [PROC.

Fossiliferous layers con- taining enormous numbers of specimens are separated by barren layers. Some of the latter (black) are of non-marine origin indicating alternate advances and retreats of the sea. Twenty-four species shown here are classed by experts in eight separate evolutionary lines (genera). (After M. L. Thompson, 1954.) known to be living today, but their fossil record, which reaches back 375 million years to the Early Devonian Period, is nevertheless extremely poor. The bodies of insects generally are destroyed almost immediately on death by bacteria and by inorganic disintegration. An important gain in paleontology during the past few decades has been a gradual increase in appreciation of the positive merits of the fossil record and this is a subject which I have reviewed elsewhere at some length (Newell, 1959). The data of paleontology are empirical and cumulative. Very many "missing links" predicted by Darwin have been discovered and are now part of the known record. Gaps that still remain are for the most part the effect of sampling bias, that is, non-preservation and non-discovery (Raup, 1972) and many may never be filled, but this negative evidence is quite consistent with sedimentary processes and evolution theory and does not at all support an hypothesis of special creation. The petroleum industry over the world has invested an immense effort in learning the evolutionary history of small fossils such as the Foraminifera, as an aid in identifying the geologic ages and positions of strata of petro- liferous provinces (figs. 2 and 3). Very often the evolutionary status of a fossil species is sufficient for determination of geologic age. Although the creationists are silent about this practical application of evolutionary theory, it works. The oil experts who deal daily with these facts of evolution are not impressed by the creationist denial of organic evolution. DESIGN, PURPOSE, AND ADAPTATION IN ORGANISMS Creationists and evolutionists alike are deeply impressed by the intimate correlation between function and structure in the organic world. In fact, it is this indication of purpose and design in the construction of organisms that has impelled people from the earliest recorded times to assume planning and execution by a supernatural higher intelligence. The hand, the eye, the ear, all clearly have special functions and it is semantic quibbling to insist that they are not the effects of design and purpose (Simpson, 1964). However, evidence is over- whelming that natural agencies have been in the past, and still are, responsible for this biologic fitness for behavior and environment. This fit- ness is known to evolutionists as adaptation. The causes of adaptation are poorly, or not at all, understood by the general public and by the creationists who prefer to explain the construc- tion of organisms simply as God's will, but I suspect that they would agree that the con- struction of a watch or an automobile is based on purely scientific principles. One large aspect of design in the organic world is the amazing diversity of living orga-</page><page sequence="5">VOL. 117, NO. 4,1973] SPECIAL CREATION AND ORGANIC EVOLUTION 327 ..... .....

These fossils are prized and inten- sively studied in the petroleum industry for their exceptional value in determining the geologic age of enclosing deposits. The validity of this evolutionary pattern is being tested and affirmed daily in many parts of the world.

Known and studied species number somewhere between one and a half and two million; it is not possible to be more definite on this (fig. 1).

NEWELL [PROC. AMER. PHIL. SOC. P L A C E FIG. 4. Evolutionary importance of environmental shifts and migrating habitats.

In time these become genetically independent and a new species results. This is speciation, a basic evolutionary process. man before they are recognized (Raven, Berlin and Breedlove, 1971). Habitable space commonly, but not always, is occupied by large numbers of kinds of orga- nisms adapted to the particular conditions that pertain at each locality. In part, occupancy is determined by accessibility and of course by suitability. Another factor, commonly over- looked, is chance or accidental elements in the seeding or dispersal of progeny by such variable agents as rainfall, wind, and water currents so that the members of each species may be con- centrated in bands or clusters or unevenly scat- tered over terrain that apparently would support a more dense and uniform population (fig. 4). How did this astonishing diversity of the organic world come about and how have orga- nisms been fitted to the environments for which they clearly are designed? The creationist is satisfied to accept all of this without curiosity as a manifestation of Divine will. But how does God exercise His will? Professor John J. Lee (personal communica- tion) and his students at City College of the University of the City of New York, after many years of field work on salt marshes near that city, have determined that one cubic centi- meter of green seaweed (Enteromorpha) con- tains 10,000 to 25,000 microscopic organisms representing some 175 species (fig. 5) that wax and wane in numbers and variety with the passing of seasons, so there is an annual cycle of succession in the community composition of these little creatures. And, of course, these provide much of the food and other resources for crustaceans, fishes, and birds that comprise the more conspicuous fauna. All of these orga- nisms live together more or less harmoniously, sustaining each other within their manifold particular environments, or niches, that are as diverse as are the species-one set of require- ments for each-an incredibly complex environ- mental web involving all sorts of nutritional, chemical, and physical factors. Similarly, Sanders and Hessler (1969) working out of Woods Hole, Massachusetts, have found as many as 365 species and 25,000 individual organisms, mainly smaller than a child's fin- gernail, living together upon and just below the surface of bottom muds over about one- half square meter of the deep sea floor, while Dobzhansky (1950) reports similarly diverse organisms of an Amazonian forest. There, he found 423 medium to large trees in 87 species over one hectare (10,000 square meters). The associated plants, animals, and micro-organisms living among and upon these trees probably run into thousands of species, many of which have not yet been described and named. The point that impressed Darwin and sub- sequent environmentalists is that every species has its own special requirements with respect to its biological associates (which shape and modify the environment) and its physical re- quirements. In a given area (habitat) there is much sharing and overlap in utilization of resources, but each species has its own way of life that is significantly unlike that of all of its immediate neighbors. Organisms are delicately adjusted to their surroundings and usually they cannot prosper, or even survive, if deprived of any of their more basic needs. On the other hand, if all of the needs of any single species are abundantly satisfied, it tends to multiply, or "bloom" ex- travagantly, depleting the essential resources to its own and its neighbors' detriment. Another example of design in the world of organisms forms the basis for biological classi- fication. Closely similar animals and plants are grouped into species, genera, families, or- ders, etc., by the degree and extent to which they share characters in common, homologous</page><page sequence="7">VOL. 117, NO. 4, 1973] SPECIAL CREATION AND ORGANIC EVOLUTION 329 features so similar in growth, structure, and function that they suggest relationship and common origin. The creationists have shown little curiosity about the significance of the thousands of simi- lar or almost identical homologies in the com- parative anatomy of closely similar groups of plants and animals, for example the chim- panzee and man, which together with other hominoids, differ in only a few salient traits but are closely similar in thousands of ways. Furthermore, the points of difference increase in number if we compare these with other groups of mammals. The obvious question to be asked is, how was this design in comparative anatomy accomplished? Was it created in- stantly, or gradually by organic evolution? The latter alternative is supported by mountains of evidence. There is, of course, no evidence that they appeared suddenly. Science cannot yet specify the conditions and events responsible for the origin of life but there is now a great body of experimental data on non-biological origins of amino acids and other large, complex molecules based on carbon. Eventually, living cells will be created by man in the laboratory, and this event (already du- biously claimed from time to time) will occur under generally acceptable circumstances before very long. Carbon, the most characteristic chemical sub- stance in protoplasm, is an element that is common throughout the universe and it is quite remarkable in its tendency to form an extraor- dinary, almost limitless, variety of molecules. Ultimately, this is the basis for the reversed entropy in the organic world whereby living systems tend to become increasingly complex rather than to decompose and simplify. There is much chemical and genetical evi- dence of essential unity and kinship of all life on earth. For example, there are many simi- larities in basic design of genetic systems of all sorts of organisms ranging from viruses or bacteria to man. The creationists have little to say about all of this. The two varieties of nucleic acid, deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) and ribonucleic acid (RNA), by which all heredity is coded, stored, and retrieved, and the energy storing compounds, such as adenosine triphos- phate, are ubiquitous among living organisms. DNA molecules are paired spiral chains wound around a common axis, the "double helix," and these chains are formed by com- $ 175 species .'7 25,000 Individuals(1 FIG. 5. Diversity and density of microorganisms in one cubic centimeter of green seaweed (Enteromorpha), of a salt marsh near Southampton, New York. (Data provided by John J. Lee.) pounds, termed "nucleotide bases," which vary in sequence within the chains. The number of nucleotide pairs in a gene may range into the thousands, giving the genes the potential for immense variability so great that it very prob- ably exceeds the realized diversity of organisms that have ever lived on earth. The hereditary mechanism of all higher or- ganisms is essentially the same. This may be interpreted as evidence of their fundamental interrelationship. Individual genes are chain- like sequences of the nucleic acids DNA, RNA, and nucleotide bases arranged in protein mole- cules. Variations in the sequences in which these chains occur make the possible variety of genes enormous. The genes have two func- tions. They serve as templates for the forma- tion of fascimile proteins and they provide infor- mation which directs the cellular metabolism. Four "genetic letters" of the DNA are em- ployed to spell out "genetic messages" formed by different linear series of the genetic letters. The near universality of this "design" is an impressive confirmation of the kinship of all earthly life and sustains the independent evi- dence from other biological and geological sources. Evolution has taken place by the formulation of new messages and not of new letters (Dobzhansky, 1970: p. 10).</page><page sequence="8">330 NORMAN D. NEWELL [PROC. AMER. PHIL. SOC. The creationists still refer to gene mutation as the presumed chief cause of genetic changes. It has been known for many years that many mutations tend to be deleterious in a given environmental context because the number of possible changes toward improvement in any well-adapted organism is small as compared with possible harmful changes. The creation- ists are therefore quite right in downgrading the importance of genetical mutations as the chief cause of organism variations so important in evolutionary theory. Certainly, viable muta- tions do influence the course of evolution, but they are not sufficiently frequent to be regarded as the main mechanism of evolutionary change. Genetics shows that the vast number of bene- ficial changes available to higher organisms are brought about by the recombination of genetic traits of male and female sex partners. Viruses and bacteria use several parasexual mechanisms for the recombination and transmission of hered- ity. But all higher organisms, both plants and animals, rely on a sexual system which involves a stage with two (diploid) sets of chromosomes in the cycle combined with reproduction by eggs and sperm each possessing a single (haploid) set of chromosomes. The resulting shuffling and recombination of genes in the chromosomes takes place in the DNA double helix of the cell nucleus. It always involves genetic seg- ments already tested and screened by natural selection, as handed down by ancestors. This recombination does involve a large element of chance that guarantees that no two individuals of the same species (except for identical twins and members of clones) will be genetically identical. This is the basis of the common phenomenon of rejection of organ transplants, a matter of great popular concern in modern medicine. While there is, indeed, an element of chance in sexual reproduction and genetic recombina- tion it must be borne in mind that the genes and their constituents are not dismantled at time of reproduction. They are not comparable to a pile of bricks. A better analogy is to compare them with prefabricated modules fre- quently employed in constructing buildings. Genetic units "prefabricated" by natural selec- tion are joined in the fertilized egg at time of reproduction. This joining is by no means random since the range of adaptive combina- tions is limited. At the same time, minor variations inherent in the process are not likely to deviate widely from the established pattern of adaptation. Gradual changes in the environ- ment place a premium on certain genetic varia- tions in the populations. The population then changes genetically in the direction of maintain- ing its adaptation to environmental changes, or it perishes. The fossil record is replete with examples of organisms that were unable to relate to those environmental changes. The development of electron microscopic tech- niques for studying the mechanisms of cell nuclei and the practical experience of age-old breeding of animals and plants combine to show that natural selection is a directed process that strongly favors some gene combinations over others. Shifting environments (fig. 4) with con- sequent fragmentation and isolation of segre- gated breeding groups, permit genetic changes to produce local populations that differ from the ancestral and neighboring populations, much as in artificial selection. And if physical isola- tion and the continued processes of genetic divergence continue through thousands or mil- lions of generations, instead of the short spans of time available to stock breeders, speciation occurs, and the new populations will not inter- breed with and merge with related populations when they come together again. The creationists stress the well-known fact that new species usually are not created by artificial breeding. At the same time, they resist the idea that continued small genetic changes of the sort observed in the laboratory will produce large changes over a sufficient length of time. The fossil record shows that this is exactly what has happened. It is curious that many creationists are now willing to accept the immensity of geologic time, but not the great antiquity of man. If geologic time must be measured in billions of years, as demonstrated by the radioactive time clock, then the main foundation of the creationists is a myth, e.g., that the earth is only a few thousands of years old. Geologic time and evolution go together. Fitness is maintained through environmental changes by selective reproduction of individual organisms having the most advantageous traits. Statistically, these are most likely to reproduce themselves. Even a slight numerical superiority in progeny can quickly produce marked popula- tion changes in time, because the spread of the favored strains is multiplied, rather than added,</page><page sequence="9">VOL. 117, NO. 4, 1973] SPECIAL CREATION AND ORGANIC EVOLUTION 331 much as a bank account may grow dramatically in a few years by accumulating compound in- terest. This is neither random nor accidental. Only the creationists now so consider it. Direction in evolutionary change is plainly illustrated by the artificial development of new strains of food cereals used for human consump- tion, and improvement of livestock by selective breeding, arts as old as civilization. The con- stant struggle to prepare vaccines against evolv- ing viruses, and pesticides against evolving insects, is another example of the practical benefits to humanity of understanding the nature and causes of direction in evolution. While the existence of design and adaptation in organisms has been fully accepted by biologists since Aristotle they were rightly reluctant to accept any single explanation that clearly was not wholly adequate to explain the wonderful designs and obvious purposes of organisms. We now do have such an explanation and, although there is much to be learned, it ap- pears to be adequate to explain the phenomenon of organic evolution and adaptation of organisms to their environments. The changes in com- position of whole faunas and floras, over count- less millennia, have been a major cause as well as effect of changes in the environmental milieu, as demonstrated by the geological sequence of fossils. There is now no need to postulate a super- natural origin for each of the millions of species. If there is an intelligent Designer or Planner responsible for the cosmos, He certainly has chosen to carry out His purpose by means of natural laws in a manner far more wonderful and meaningful than resorting to ad hoc miracles for each and every event. The heart of both religion and science is adherence to a body of law-indeed, the same body of law- that can be referred to by one as the Word of God, by the other as Natural Law. This evolu- tionary thought, as an aspect of science, fortifies the great moral principles of all major religions, of nurture of good will among all men, of the Golden Rule, of the Ten Commandments, of evolutionary principles yet to be codified and widely recog- nized. . . . Any effort that impedes general rec- ognition of the compatibility of evolutionary thought and enlightened religion-that polarizes their proponents into antagonistic camps-is griev- ously misguided (Smith, 1973: p. 27-28).
