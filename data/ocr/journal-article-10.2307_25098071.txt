Nearly half a century has passed since "L'Affaire Sade" of 1956, the cen sorship trial brought against publisher Jean-Jacques Pauvert for his landmark edition of the complete works of the Marquis de Sade. Pauvert "lost" in terms of the actual judgment, which was sustained on appeal, but he "won" inasmuch as the appellate court dropped the order to seize his books and imposed only a sym bolic fine. Sade had long since won over artists and intellectuals, of course; Jean Paulhan, Andr? Breton, Jean Cocteau, and Georges Bataille testified for the de fense; Simone de Beauvoir republished her essay "Faut-il br?ler Sade?" in 1955. Even before its conflicted final judgment, however, the Sade trial was rife with mixed messages: the state prosecutor worried openly about finding a place in literary history alongside the denouncers of Flaubert and Baudelaire, Bataille ad mitted that Sade's books shouldn't fall into the hands of just anybody, and both prosecution and defense agreed that Sade was "boring." Sade's paradoxical status continues to this day. While in many respects his work has entered the eighteenth-century canon, there are still indications?

Voltaire, c'est la faute ? Rousseau")?contemporary critics are unlikely to classify themselves as Voltaire's "admirers" or "detractors," or the "cultural left" and "cultural right" as either for or against Rousseau. On the other hand, a columnist for the National Review recently had no qualms about citing Sade as "accessory before the fact" to a series of murders committed in the 1960s. Taking the recent release of the movie Quills as a starting point, she makes much of the fact that the one of the perpetrators of the "Moors Murders" of 1963-65 possessed a paperback copy o? Justine (in addition to a dysfunctional childhood amidst urban blight and multiple early signs of sociopathic behavior, none of which apparently mattered as much). The immediate targets are, of course, "Hollywood liberals." (Florence King, "Misanthrope's Corner: Misrepresenta tion of the Marquis de Sade as Hero in the Movie Quills," National Review, June 11, 2001). Given his lifelong attachment to the theater, Sade would have doubt less appreciated the connection. Of the books under consideration here, two scholarly monographs and a biography, none are "critical" of Sade, but they go about the business of studying the Marquis and situating him in literary and intellectual history in very different ways. Norbert Sclippa's Le Jeu de la Sphinge is unabashedly "pro-Sade." Although he ultimately argues for Sade as an "Enlightenment philosopher," he sets his study in the broadest possible context: the mythic confrontation between Oedipus and the Sphinx. ("Sphinge," in Sclippa's terminology, is meant to reflect the creature's triple aspect of "femme, lion, et aigle" [8]). Sclippa reads the scene as a play of mirrors in which "man deceives himself to the extent to which he takes himself to be other than a monster: blind, incestuous, murderous" (14; my translation). Whereas mainstream philosophes, we are told, optimistically (naively) believe in human perfectibility?the elimination of monstrosity?Sade's heroes "recognize themselves" in the mirror and "accept the consequences" (22). In itself, this is not terribly original: Sade's "lucidity" has been a theme of commentators from Apollinaire to Foucault. Sclippa's merit lies rather in his abil ity to interrogate the category of "monstrosity" in a broad, synthesizing reading of Sade's works, and to set Sade in dialogue with the evolving philosophical con text from his day to ours. It is not an historically grounded investigation into the category of monstrosity as it arises in medical and moral discourse, such as recent studies by Marie-H?l?ne Huet, Andrew Curran, and others; here the discussion is carried out on a metaphysical plane, or in Sade's own terms. Subsequent chapters take up different aspects of what Sclippa calls Sade's "mat?rialisme int?gral," arguing that while Sade is definitely a product of the Enlightenment's intellectual environment, he surpasses it. For example, Sade is "uniquely" aware of the com patibility of the libertine and philosophical traditions (37); he is more consistent and "modern" in his relativism and as such provides an important critique of Enlightenment systematicity (44). However, whereas Sade may have "gone be yond the anthropomorphism of his contemporaries" in his view of nature, Sclip pa (following the lines of Carl Becker's classic argument in The Heavenly City of the Eighteenth-Century Philosophers) observes that nature still retained for him "the transcendent characteristics that mark the thought of the period" (58). The discussion of Sade's materialism takes an odd turn, however, in Chapter 4 ("Vio lence et coprophagie"), where Sclippa emphasizes that the "sadism" of the novels is a "metaphor" (74), murder "allegory" (78), and that while the eating of excre ment underscores the universality and endless cycling of "matter," still "at the</page><page sequence="3">Reviews 471 level of the fiction, indeed, excrement has neither odor nor taste" (81). (Or, as Barthes phrased it long ago: "?crite, la merde ne sent pas"). If the focus is to turn on questions of language and absenceMibertine ascesis, then this would have been an interesting opportunity for a more "material" approach, a properly rhetorical reading of the cognitive and ethical stakes in Sade's substitutions, disjunctions, allegories. The final chapter offers a thoughtful discussion situating Sade with respect to the theory of tragedy. Sade achieves tragedy through his participation in "the infinite" (90), even as by his lucidity he "deconstructs the tragic machine" (98). Sclippa's thorough knowledge of Sade's oeuvre allows him to deploy a wide range of references from throughout Sade's novels and to juxtapose them in interesting ways with passages from Voltaire, Rousseau, d'Holbach, La Mettrie, etc. If I have a reservation, it is less with the major points of the analysis per se, but with what it leaves untouched and unsaid. There is a relative lack of engage ment with most contemporary Sade scholarship, despite some perfunctory refer ences here and there to works from the 70s and 80s, as if the conversation had not significantly moved on from discussion of Blanchot's "homme int?gral." And the unspoken restriction of "Sade" to the pornographic works gives pause. Sade certainly wanted to be read as a subversive philosophy and can be read produc tively in that manner; but he also wanted to be recognized as a legitimate man of letters. There is something rather unsatisfying, for example, in the statement that Sade's theater "adds nothing fundamental" to the theories of the tragic that are being drawn from his other works (87n). Sade's theater, indeed, was hardly "trag ic"?but its automatic excision points to a troubling absence. To concentrate ex clusively on the clandestine texts?and to treat them as all one "text"?is to do an injustice to the complexity of the work, its multiple voices, genres, tones, ironies. Caroline Warman's recent book, Sade: From Materialism to Pornogra phy, also focuses on Sade's clandestine writings, but deliberately, explicitly, and with a very different point of view. Eschewing from the outset an approach to Sade's writings in terms of his "personal fate," she argues for the greater impor tance of his intellectual context in achieving a full understanding of his work. While recognizing the important contributions of earlier scholars such as Jean Deprun, Michel Delon, Hans-Ulrich Siefert, and Jean-Marie Goulemot in setting Sade in his literary and philosophical environment, Warman proposes a more thorough examination of Sade's intellectual indebtedness to eighteenth-century materialism, the better to understand the stakes in his particular way of bringing philosophy into literature. The first chapter, "Sade and Materialism since 1945," considers the scant attention paid to materialist thought in the readings of Sade by the postwar phi losophers/critics who were so largely responsible for conferring on him whatever canonical status he may have today?Pierre Klossowski, Maurice Blanchot, Si mone de Beauvoir?and the similar neglect by the Tel Quel group in their highly influential readings from the late 60s. While focusing on the "materiality of the signifier," these critics tended to ignore the role of materialism itself and to claim that Sade's engagement with the philosophy of his day was unsystematic and superficial. Reviewing a number of the contributions to Sade criticism since the 70s, Warman finds that despite an enhanced appreciation for Sade's "use" of materialist sources?the work of Jean Deprun and Michel Delon being crucial here?we still lack the tools for discussing the essential links between Sade's liter ary production and his philosophical framework. Her next two chapters under</page><page sequence="4">472 Eighteenth-Century Studies 37/3 take to lay out that framework, first by culling through the works of Helv?tius, La Mettrie, d'Holbach, Condillac, and others to reconstruct the tenets of "sensa tionist materialism," particularly as it relates to theories of language; she then reflects on the "rhetorical profile" of materialist philosophy, especially the "more than ordinarily aggressive" qualities of d'Holbach's style. This is both careful intellectual history (the discussion of the relationships between Condillac's "sen sory" understanding of language and the work of Helv?tius and the others is particularly interesting) and careful reading (for example, the reflection on the role of "personification" [56] and the subliminal "sexual under-narrative" in d'Holbach [67-68]). She then turns to "Sade's system," arguing that "the tenets of sensationist materialism in conjunction with its rhetoric generated the main points of Sade's text" (86). Sade's writing, she contends, is not simply an out growth of materialism, but a powerful individual interpretation of it; the remain ing chapters look to his use of specific literary techniques ("dramatization" and "literalization") within the broader context of pornographic and clandestine writing. Overall, Warman is very successful in accomplishing what she sets out to do, offering a nuanced reading of Sade and his intellectual interlocutors that re spects their connections and sheds light on his originality. Methodologically, there is an occasional strain. Warman wants to show "Sade's general debt to a general way of thinking" (69), which leads her to construct a philosophical "system" that belongs to no single philosopher, but is rather stitched together from many. To be sure, the case can be made that Sade was familiar with all or most of these texts, directly or indirectly, but the work of synthesis is still Warman's, not Sade's or Condillac's or d'Holbach's. On the other hand, she also wants to argue, as I un derstand it, for the textual specificity of Sade's engagement with his reading; yet on one major occasion, in the discussion of the violence underlying writing with in the alchemical tradition (110-114), she offers no stronger connection to Sade than that "magical, mystical, cabalistic, and alchemical texts were still present to the minds of the readers that the Encyclop?die was trying to educate" (114)? which seems rather weak. Furthermore, while the analysis shows a reasonably thorough engagement with Sade criticism, it might have benefited from a wider range of recent scholarship: one thinks of John O'Neal's book on sensationism, The Authority of Experience (1996), Anne Vila's Enlightenment and Pathology (1998), or the studies of Sade and early modern pornography by Lynn Hunt, Peter Cryle, and others. (I'd also be interested in knowing what Warman thinks of the dramatically different account of alchemical writing given in Evelyn Fox Keller's Reflections on Gender and Science [1985]). These are mild reservations, howev er; Warman's book offers a judicious blend of the history of ideas, language the ory, rhetoric, and careful close reading in her timely interpretation of Sade's work. If Sclippa and Warman represent two very different approaches in Sadean criticism?one broadly atemporal, the other resolutely historical?Neil Schaef fer's book is a reminder that the some of the most visible contributions to Sade scholarship in recent years have been in the realm of biography. However much literary scholars like Warman might prefer to set Sade's work in the context of intellectual history, his "personal fate" continues to exercise a powerful appeal. The differences between Sade's "author-function" and other eighteenth-century writers are clearly evident in the fascination accorded his life via biographical and cinematic representation. Diderot scholars might chuckle over the comic "day in the life" of their philosopher in Gabriel Aghion's 2001 film Le Libertin, but that film pales in comparison?in both high-minded seriousness and box office reve</page><page sequence="5">Reviews 473 nues?with Philip Kaufman's 2000 Quills. The plot of Quills, like that of its powerful predecessor play, Peter Weiss's Marat/Sade, is more interested in the symbolic value of Sade's life in the Charenton years than in biographical "fact." Like literary criticism and biography, such representations constitute not just a commentary on the place of "Sade" in contemporary culture, but other forms of reading and interpretation. The materialist Sade is always good "material." Space unfortunately does not allow me fully to situate Schaeffer's project in the context of the remarkable outpouring of Sade biographies in French and in English since the late 80s by Jean-Jacques Pauvert, Maurice Lever, Alice Laborde, Laurence Bongie, and Francine du Plessix Gray. Much of this work has been stimulated by the publication by Lever, Laborde, and J-L Debauve, working with Sade's descendents, of new archival information, letters, and other Sade family documents. The continuing fascination and scattered state of the Sade correspon dence are both evinced by the recent flutter in the French press over the publica tion of four new letters concerning Sade's sister-in-law (Anne-Prosp?re de Launay, ed. Pierre Leroy [Paris, 2003]). Of the recent works in English, Schaeffer's biography is broader in scope than either Bongie's, whose primary aim is debunking the "Sade myth," or Du Plessix Gray's, which focuses on the women in Sade's life. For those who are familiar with the scholarship in French, Schaeffer does not offer "new research" per se?he conscientiously documents his sources in the earlier biographies of Gilbert Lely, Lever, and Pauvert, and helpfully notes the points on which they disagree. His is also the first English-language biography to make a thorough use of Alice Laborde's exhaustive edition of Sade family correspondence and to offer translations of many letters. Unlike Bongie or Du Plessix Gray, Schaeffer does not offer a preface or prologue to give a background for his project or to explain why a new biography might be needed in English (Lever's biography had been trans lated into English in 1993): he simply launches his story. He tells the story very well. Sade's life continues to disturb, to call out for interpretation, as much as his works. Schaeffer makes pertinent observations and offers an even-handed account of those murky areas that biographers continue to ponder, sorting out the differing interpretations of Paul Bourdin, Lely, Lever, and others, on such matters as the timing and extent of Sade's affair with his sister-in law, the events of the winter of 1774-75 at La Coste, the relationship between Sade and his wife. Above all, he is interested in "making sense" of Sade; looking to the events of his childhood, the relationships among family members, and the repeated missteps and miscalculations of his adult life, the biographer attempts to understand the marquis's endlessly self-destructive behavior, his sexual identity, his capacity for both callousness and friendship, his arrogance and cruelty?and his apparent charisma. Sade is no hero here, but neither is he a villain. In Schaef fer's skillfully-written account, a plausible "character" takes shape. Schaeffer's psychoanalytic speculations will not be to the taste of all readers, but I found them thought provoking and often illuminating. Without attempting to analyze Sade's writing in depth, Schaeffer reflects astutely on the development of his sense of a literary vocation and on the importance of his correspondence in that pro cess. He has one of the better discussions of Sade's "folie de chiffres" that I have encountered (282-91); his one extended discussion of a literary work, a chapter on Les Cent-vingt journ?es de Sodome, is a thoughtful, readable introduction to that difficult, "unreadable" novel.</page><page sequence="6">474 Eighteenth-Century Studies 37/3 "Reading Sade" is difficult. His life is perplexing and troubling; his works remain controversial. There is also a tendency?among both his admirers and his detractors?to reduce "Sade" to a set of abstract ideas, rather than to engage with the words that he wrote and the multiple discourses and genres in which he wrote. Each of the books discussed here has the merit of attending to Sade's texts, though they do so in very different ways and with different frames. Each helps to see the frames of the others, and to illuminate the complexity of the works. A last word on framing. Near the end of Pasolini 's 1975 film Salo, based on Les Cent-vingt journ?es de Sodome, one of the master libertines, who has been impassively observing the tortures in the courtyard below his room through a pair of field glasses, suddenly reverses the binoculars and looks through the op posite end. The scene before him, which we see from his perspective, is suddenly made smaller, more distant; we are aware of the optical intervention and the presence of the lens. Is it a retreat from the horror, a necessary distancing? Or a reminder of the factitiousness of representation? So too Sade's texts, framed by critics, themselves offer multiple, contradictory, endlessly readable frames.</page></plain_text>
