<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE DIVINITIES OF ANCIENT IRELAND. (Continued). Dear Sir, In niy previous letters I dealt, at some length, with the question of Ancestor Worship and its con nection with the magical activities of the mythical heroes of the l)e Danaan and other tribes. I also produced some evidence, mainly etymological, of the j existence of Departmental Gods of Nature among j our prehistoric ancestors as exemplified by the "De | Danaan Trinity/* Eathoir, CeaHhoir. and Tethoir. | I do not, however, believe that Ancestor Worship and the belief in powerful and original gods of Nature, by any means exhaust the possible, or even the actual, spiritual beings worshipped, feared, or reverenced by the inhabitants of Ancient Ireland. The innumerable spirits of mountain and valley, of lake and river, of tree and well, of earth, air, and sea in short, slip through the meshes of my theory and elude explanation. Whether these are ade quately accounted for by the anthropomorphism of early man, and his habit of placing a Person behind those phenomena which modem science regards as the transient symbols or fleeting shadows of some hitherto unexplained Natural Force is a question which I am not competent to discuss, though it seems that much has been written on the dream and spirit world of savage races, and analogies drawn there from to early man and his religious habits, which is of very doubtful value, owing to the impossibility of getting clear and exact notions of the mind of the savage. The Daimones of the Greeks; th- Peris and Dives of the Ancient Persians ; the genii of the Romans ; the guardian sprits of the sacred trees and holy wells of oui1 own land ; and the analogous beings of other countries seem to have occupied a position in the spiritual world intermediate between those of the ghosts of deceased ancestors and the higher spirits of Nature. They may possibly have been survivals from that far-off time when every village was a separate and independent community with a pecu liar, social, and religious organization. This would account for the numerical preponderance of the genii locotum as compared with deifed ancestors and Nature gods. It would also account for the diversity of their attributes and their limited territorial juris diction. But they may also have been the logical outcome of early cosmogonie systems; The ancient Greeks at least found room for them in theirs, and appa rently regarded them as a higher race of men. Hesiod tells us plainly enough that the beneficent daimones were the first race of men formed by the Olympic gods. They were the golden race of the world's golden age. And though they have received the gift of immortality from the gods, they nevertheless live here on earth, and move among us as the silent and invisible ministers of Heaven, dispensing its favours and its blessings to frail, and helpless humanity, and guiding it by ways unknown to us along the path of righteousness. Nor is their labour a sinecure. For Hesiod also informs us. that the men of the silver age, having failed to fulfil the mission entrusted to them by the gods, suffered the punishment which, sooner or later, overtakes all transgressors of the eternal laws. They were allowed to retain the:r immortality; but it be came a curse instead of a blessing, condemned as they were to painful and endless toil in the service of Hades. Like Satan and his legions they are per petually opposing and thwarting the designs of the gods, and neutralizing as far as lies in their power the beneficent labours of their more fortunate pre decessors. Plato held that the Daimones were emanations from the divine essence of the Supreme God, and re garded them as intermediate in character to the gods of Olympus and human nature. They would thus b^ naturally liable to be confounded with the ghosts of dead ancestors on the one hand, and with the Olympians or Nature Gods on the other. Of these intermediate spirits our own country had her share. The genius loci has left his memory in all parts of the land. The Holy Wells of Ireland, her sacred trees and rivers, her bays and invers, were once the patrimony of those spirits; and likely enough they had to contend for their rights and pos sessions with the spirit? of mortal heroes who frowned</page><page sequence="2">ALL IRELAND REVIEW. 161 down on them from the summit of a cairn, or mo lested their ancient tenure with his solitary crom- ! le?h. And do we not actually know that they fought a gallant, if forlorn, battle, against the early saints i and many foreign missionaries with such vigour and pertinacity, that though final defeat is inevi- I table the struggle is not yet wholly over. - The i banshee and the leprechaun, Cleena and Findvarra, Ma?anan, Tir-na-nogue, and Tir-fa-toun may now be mere fables; but they have left an impress on the mind and character of the Irish race deeper even I than Christianity has left, and which even all-cor- j roding time itself may not wholly destroy. ! While believing, ijhen, that Ancestor Worship j does not adequately explain the origin of the spirits ! referred to above, neither do I believe that it gives j a satisfactory explanation of the originating cause ! of the belief in a Supreme Being, whose knowledge and power is as infinite as Time and Space ; to whom all the spirits of earth, air, and sea. are subordinate ? ministers and obedient vassals. j The origin of this belief is a matter of endless j controversy; but however it originated, we know that it was held at a comparatively early stage of j man's development, at least by the thoughtful heads | of the race, who found the multiplicity of spiritual powers with which popular theology filled the world too complicated, and perhaps too irrational for their minds. It may be that they were urged to believe in a Supreme God by logical necessity, or perhaps from anology with social institutions around them. At all events we know they did believe in one Great Cause, and whether they named it Jupiter, or Bal, or Brahm matters little. The theogony of Orpheus represents Love as a beneficent deity who created form and order out of chaotic matter ; and who from its spiritless substan tiality evolved the incomprehensible alternation of vegetable growth and decay; and the still more wonderful principle of animal life, with its count less diversified manifestations, from the minute, almost lifeless, and probably senseless monad, to the delicate and complicated mechanism of the human body. And long before the days of Orpheus, the sages of Egypt and Chaldea had reached the belief in a Supreme Personal Cause. The, inadequacy of materialism as an explanation of life and destiny, and the absurdity of conferring the attributes of omnipotency and ubiquity on the . ghosts of mere mortal men would naturally lead to t the belief in One Supreme Being. I do not know whether our Aryan ancestors had reached this stage of religious development before their dispersion. But we have some evidence in our traditions and literature that the De Danaans had reached it at or before the date of the Milesian invasion. The Dagda, for instance, as known by the titles of "An Dagda Mor" and Ollathair, or Father of All.* He was apparently the Jupiter of the De Danaan ? Olympus. The epithets Mor and Ollathair taken in connection with the compound word Dagda itself, Which, I think, means beneficent God, points to his ? divine supremacy, and the recognition of that supre macy by the De Danaans. I Lir too stands out pre-eminently above his fellow- i gods. He was the vital spirit of the boundless in finite sea, or rather, to keep close to etymology, of the boundless All of Space; the ruler of the vast in finite which contains not only the sea, but Earth, Heaven, and Hell also. In origin he was probably the god of some vigorous maritime tribe who felt the Infinite in their voyages on the open sea, the boundlessness of which would suggest the attributes of Lir. Compared to him the Dagda was a mere god of terra firma, whose attributes were correspondingly limited by his terrestrial jurisdiction, .while Lir had the infinite waste of waters and the boundless and unknown world under his control. He was in. short the vital spirit of the Universe. His son Ma?anan obtained the sea for his patrimony. M. M. (To be continued).</page></plain_text>
