<plain_text><page sequence="1">John Henry Raleigh THE NOVEL AND THE CITY: ENGLAND AND AMERICA IN THE NINETEENTH CENTURY Genesis: A Parable As was well known to Hegel and others, Adam and Eve did not "fall" in the Garden of Eden. They simply became human beings, albeit very simple ones, too simple to be regarded as the first agents or the founders of such a com- plex and sinful affair as human history. The real "Fall" was to come when Cain murdered Abel. For what Adam and Eve were like when they left the Garden of Eden, the poet John Milton may be taken as the most authoritative and reliable wit- ness. According to Milton, the expulsion from the Garden was preceded by a preview of human history given by the angel Michael to Adam, while Eve slept. All the horrors of history were paraded before Adam's eyes, especially those mass horrors connected with wars, cities, and the bloody intercourse of tribes, cultures, and nations.

Others to a city strong Lay siege, encamped; by battery, scale, and mine, Assaulting; others from the wall defend With dart and javelin, stones and sulphurous fire; On each hand slaughter and gigantic deeds. (Paradise Lost, XI, 638-658) But Adam is assured that he and Eve, and any other individual in human history, need not partake of, or participate in, the murderousness of history and that mankind, as an aggregate of individuals, can be free, good, and happy, happier even than in Eden: "only add Deeds to thy knowledge answerable, add faith, Add virtue, patience, temperance, add love, By name to come called charity, the soul Of all the rest: then wilt thou not be Loth to leave this Paradise, but shalt possess A Paradise within thee, happier far." (XII, 581-587) As Adam and Eve left the Garden, they did drop some tears "but wiped them soon," for "The world was all before them." What happened was that Adam and Eve did not go far, but stopped soon and built a cottage on the Mesopotamian plain. Adam constructed a wooden fence around the cottage, and Eve planted a few rose bushes in the yard. Within this cottage Eve brought forth her children in pain, and outside, out of the stony, dry soil, Adam earned their daily bread by the sweat of his brow. Each evening as the sun set Adam returned to the cottage, where Eve would tell him about the children, and he would tell her about the farm. They would then sit down to their humble evening repast, a bowl of goat's milk, for which they said Grace and thanked the Lord. Then to bed. Every so often Adam would by chance encounter a neighboring farmer, who would tell him about the latest iniquity that had taken place in Sodom or Gom- morah, the nearest cities. Upon his return to the cottage, Adam would tell Eve of these urban evils, and that night when they thanked the Lord for their sustenance, they also thanked Him for having made them rural and virtuous. But the city and its evils were far away, and the daily routine, day after day, week after week, month after month, year after year, decade after decade, VICTORIAN STUDIES 292</page><page sequence="4">THE NOVEL AND THE CITY century after century, was a constant round of sober rural virtue. It was not that they were spared all the heartaches of parents, for, on a day that still lives in infamy, their bad son, Cain, killed their good son, Abel. Cain was banished by the Lord, leaving our first parents childless for a time. But as the Lord taketh away, he also giveth, and in Adam's one-hun- dred-and-thirtieth year Eve presented him with a son, Seth, who turned out to be virtuous, the joy and pride of his parents. There followed a host of sons and daughters, as the centuries went by. When Adam lay on his death bed, in his nine-hundred-and-thirtieth year, and reckoned up his blessings, he found that Michael had been right and that he and Eve had not really lost Paradise: It had been within them all those centuries. Adam died in the odor of sanctity. The real "Fall," the first shriek of a human being in mortal pain and the first murder, came with Cain, who turns out to be the authentic father of mankind (which makes Adam our virtuous grandfather). Michael had already told Adam all about Cain and Abel and had given him the customary visual preview, of the unjust son slaying the just son. Adam at once sees its signifi- cance: Death. "Alas both for the deed and for the cause! But have I now seen Death? Is this the way I must return to native dust? 0 sight Of Terror, foul and ugly to behold, Horrid to think, how horrible to feel!" (XI, 461-465) But Michael spares him nothing: "Death thou hast seen In his first shape on Man; but many shapes Of Death, and many are the ways that lead To his grim cave, all dismal; yet to sense More terrible at the entrance than within. Some, as thou saw'st, by violent stroke shall die, By fire, flood, famine, by intemperance more In meats and drinks which on the Earth shall bring Diseases dire, of which a monstrous crew Before thee shall appear, that thou may'st know What misery the inabstinence of Eve Shall bring on men."

(XI, 466-493) This preview of a large urban hospital and mad-house moves Adam, who was a good man, to tears. So history, as She is lived, begins with Cain, the fratricide and the builder of the first city. It is instructive to review the punishments visited by the Lord upon Cain, and Cain's reactions to them. The Lord tells him that he is "cursed"; that he can no longer till the soil, for it will henceforth be barren to him; and that he will thereafter be a fugitive and a vagabond on the face of the earth (the good Lord did not know the word, "alienation"). Cain's response: "My punishment is greater than I can bear." (How many bil- lions of times in subsequent history was this to be said: "It is more than I can bear"?) But the Lord makes sure that this death-in-life of Cain's will not be cut short, by putting upon him a mark that will insure that no one will slay him. Cain's reaction is to leave the vicinity of Eden, going eastward to Nod, to "know" his wife, starting a line that was later to produce the evil Lamech, and to found a city. Thus in the fourth chapter of "Genesis" we have: fratri- cide; sterility or barrenness or lack of creativity; alienation; sexuality; and urbanization. In other words Cain is the narrator of Notes from Underground, except for the act of murder which the Underground Man would certainly like to re-enact and lacks only the courage to do. Never mind, Raskolnikov will do it for him, as will Smerdyakov, and Verkovensky, all heirs of the man who first said: "Am I my brother's keeper?" So if one looks up the tree-lined vistas opened up by the version of the story of Adam and Eve presented here, one sees Wordsworth's "Michael" or Levin mowing the fields in Anna Karenina, but if one looks down into the boiling depths uncovered by the story of Cain, one sees the world of Crime and Punishment or Bleak House or Pierre or The Naked Lunch or An Ameri- can Dream. IN THE BEGINNING WAS THE WORD It is a commonplace of novel criticism that the novel, especially the novel of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, is a City animal' 1 The standard discussion of urbanization and the English novel is, of course, Ian Watt's The Rise of the Novel (Berkeley and Los Angeles, 1959), especially pp. 177-186. VICTORIAN STUDIES 294</page><page sequence="6">THE NOVEL AND THE CITY (by City here is meant the megalopolis). It comes therefore as a sur- prise to realize, at least it does to me, that if one catalogues the major novelists (which will be my concern here) of Europe and America by degree of urbanity over the last two centuries, it turns out that the novel is more accurately described as predominantly a Provincial animal or, in the American mode, a denizen of the wilderness or the sea or the river, or a haunter of the past. For it is the province, town or village or estate, that is, more often than not, the focal point of the novel. One has only to think, in the nineteenth century, of Turgenev, Flaubert, Stendahl (although Paris does come in), Scott, Austen, Eliot, the Brontis, Hardy, Cooper, Melville (with some significant exceptions), Twain, and Hawthorne, to realize the force of this actuality, to which list would have to be added in the twentieth century Silone, Malraux, Mann, D. H. Lawrence, Conrad, Hemingway (except for part of The Sun Also Rises), Fitzgerald (except for parts of This Side of Paradise and The Great Gatsby), and Faulkner. (It should be added, of course, that the whole picture gets considerably complicated by two other urges of the novel that have nothing to do with the City-Province an- tithesis that is being sketched here: first, the impulse, since Scott, toward the past; and, second, the generic impulse toward the exotic or the far-away or the out-of-the-way - Conrad or Malraux or Tolstoy's Cau- causus stories or Hemingway's forays into Spain.) The major novelists who are also predominately urbanists are Dostoevsky, Tolstoy, Balzac, Dickens, Thackeray, James, and, later on, Proust and Joyce. But if one accepts the definition of City-Novelist that I am going on here, namely, that a novelist of the City is one who uses as back- ground, and therefore renders, a large metropolitan City, further quali- fications have to be made, even with the avowed urbanists. For exam- ple, it has always seemed to me, and to others, that Joyce's Dublin is not a modern City at all but is more like a medieval burgh (Joyce once said that if he could have had his choice of occupations in life, he would have preferred to have been the mayor of a continental medieval burgh). And that Bloom is not "modem man" but is, in the words of Robert Tracy,2 a Hungarian-Hebraic-Hellenistic-Hibernian living in a very special, non-modern culture in a very special, non-moder city which is more like a provincial town than anything else. It should be remembered that Joyce finally forsook Dublin for dream and history and that one anecdotal report about what he was planning to do next, 2 Robert Tracy, "Leopold Bloom Fourfold: A Hungarian-Hebraic-Hellenic-Hibernian Hero," Massachusetts Review, VII (1966), 523-538. MARCH 1968 295</page><page sequence="7">John Henry Raleigh after Finnegan awoke, has it that he contemplated an epic on the sea. Similarly, Thackeray slowly but surely turns away from the modern City and recedes into the past. His greatest novel, Vanity Fair, is magnifi- cently urbane and its presentation of the life of the middle and upper classes during the Waterloo era and the 1820's is certainly social and urban history of a high order. Though his physical descriptions are slight compared to those of Dickens, they are exact and effective, espe- cially, perhaps, because of their rarity; Gaunt House, Vauxhall, Baker Street, the birds singing in the early morning in Russell Square. Other aspects and haunts of London appear in Pendennis and The Newcomes. But it is significant that as he had ridiculed the age-old antithesis, Country (virtue) and City (vice), in Vanity Fair, he himself employs it (Laura and the country) in Pendennis, and, of course, with Henry Esmond, The Virginians, and "Denis Duval," we are once more in the past. Tolstoy presents another set of qualifications, somewhat similar to those made of Joyce. War and Peace has two kinds of alternations going on, that announced in the title and an internal one between Moscow (standing for Holy Mother Russia) and St. Petersburg (stand- ing for moral corruption and Western ideas), with side-trips to the provincial estate of the Bolkonskys. But neither city is a megalopolis, it being 1812, and both are seen from a very special perspective, that of the higher strata of Russian society, where everyone knows everyone else; and thus the social texture is that of a small town. The same is true of Anna Karenina which, of course, has one of the two main centers in the provinces, on Levin's estate. The bulk of the rest of Tolstoy's work does not occur in the City, and all of it constitutes a running jeremiad against the City. (Tolstoy, being usually the biggest of every- thing, is also the biggest city-hater.) This leaves us with Balzac, Dostoevsky, Dickens, James, and Proust (it is perhaps picayune to note, but it is nevertheless true that vast stretches of Remembrance of Things Past take place in the Prov- inces). But even here some reservations should be made. Perhaps even Balzac, so some of his critics think, was not one of those quintessential denizens of the City, with the names of City streets stamped into his soul, and its coal dust clogging his pores, that for example, Dickens and Dostoevsky would appear to have been. He began in the provinces and, even when attempting to bolt Paris whole, he remained, in some deep senses, in and of the provinces. As Donald Fanger says, "Balzac had begun his career with a series of conventional, romantically melodra- VICTORIAN STUDIES 296</page><page sequence="8">THE NOVEL AND THE CITY matic novels and only discovered Paris, literarily speaking, when he was about thirty."3 To which may be added Martin Turnell's remarks: "It must be remembered that Balzac was born in the provinces and at heart he remained a provincial all his life. That explains why he re- garded Paris naively as "the city of sin," indulged in the Paris novels in the absurd division into black and white and presented such an exag- gerated picture of contemporary life."4 Similarly, in criticizing Balzac's habit of bestowing personal obsessions, with little psychological subtlety or insight, upon his Parisian characters, Turnell says that this habit was "less of a handicap in the provincial novels when Balzac is, for valid reasons, dealing with a simplified mentality; and in the minor characters it becomes a source of positive strength" (p. 229). Even with Dostoevsky some very significant qualifications should be made of his major works. Notes from Underground, Crime and Pun- ishment, and The Idiot, all take place in St. Petersburg, and this urban setting is all important. The narrator of the Notes, the first alienated urbanite, the first urban insect in fiction, tells the reader, insistently, that a part of the misery - although most of it is self-inflicted - of his miserable existence results from the fact that he is a denizen of St. Petersburg: I swear, gentlemen, that to be conscious is an illness - a real thoroughgoing ill- ness. For man's everyday needs, it would have been quite enough to have the ordi- nary human consciousness, that is, half or a quarter of the amount which falls to the lot of a cultivated man of our unhappy nineteenth century, especially one who has the fatal ill-luck to inhabit Petersburg, the most theoretical and intentional town on the whole terrestrial globe (there are intentional and unintentional towns).5 But The Devils, and The Brothers Karamasov, his greatest and last novel, take place in the provinces, in towns. And this fact is of some consequence. In The Devils, via the Biblical fable of the Gadarene swine, Dostoevsky wanted to show an entire human community being infected by what Dostoevsky regarded as a set of pernicious ideas, a kind of ideological plague. As the novel goes on, this is precisely what happens, and when the novel ends the community qua community has dissolved. Obviously, he could not have achieved this effect with St. Petersburg as background. Again the setting of The Brothers is all im- portant. For one thing, by the climax, the murder trial, Dostoevsky wanted to give the sense of an entire community, every last man, 3 Donald Fanger, Dostoevsky and Romantic Realism (Cambridge, Mass., 1965), p. 75. 4 Martin Turnell, The Novel in France (New York, 1958), p. 229. 5 Notes from Underground, trans.

Second, the actual physical setting is of great importance in the moral symbol- ism of the novel. As for general geography, in Ralph Matlaw's words, "The novel ranges far in geographical location as in social hierarchy: Mt. Athos in the South; Obdorsk in the North, the rising and setting of the sun are the horizontal religious boundaries; Odessa, Petersburg, Siberia (America) and Spain the temporal; the action takes place in a town (Staraja Russa) located exactly in the center."6 Further, the town itself is named Skotoprigonevsk, which in Russian means "beast cor- ral" (or "beast pen"), and the Karamasov garden, the focal point of the novel, is at the dead center of the town. There live the most dubious characters, the elder Karamasov, Ivan, and Smerdyakov. Just outside lives a better character, Dimitry, and, out of the town altogether, at the monastery, lives the saintly Alyosha.7 Again, obviously, such sym- metrical and all-encompassing effects could not have been achieved in the shapeless mass of St. Petersburg. In other words, for his greatest novel Dostoevsky moved out to the provinces, just as it can be said that the greatest novel of the English nineteenth century, Middlemarch, is of the provinces. Even with Dickens certain qualifications should be made. It is easy to forget, so vivid is his picture of London, that much of the action and thus the background of his novels, takes place outside of the City. There are at least eight geographical centers in Dickens' world: Lon- don, Coketown, the Cathedral town, the provincial town, the village with the Church, the country town, the country estate, and the country- side, each with its own range of symbolic meanings, ranging from the tranquility, venerability, and peace of the Cathedral town (usually Rochester or Canterbury), to the hellish horrors of Coketown, to the massive and inchoate intricacies of London, to the rural beauty, peace, and security of the countryside. Very often there is a basic peripatetic movement in many of his novels from place to place, between two, or more usually, three places. The Dickensian urge to move outward and away, to escape the City, is most powerfully wrought in that epic, purga- torial, "Pilgrim's Progress" journey in The Old Curiosity Shop of Little Nell and her grandfather. Up out of the twisted old depths of inner London; through its great financial center; out through its concentric rings of boroughs and suburbs, the City successively dwindling, the 6 Ralph Matlaw, "The Brothers Karamasov," Musagetes, II (1957), 34. 7 Edward Wasiolek, Dostoevsky: The Major Fiction (Cambridge, Mass., 1964), ch. ix.

Then, "clear of London" - freshness of the day, birds, grass, leaves, flowers, scents, sounds, deep joys.8 The odyssey continues through purgatorial industrial regions of polluted rivers, barren ground, noise, smoke, gloom, fire, machines "like tortured creatures," threats of revolution and plague. Then back on the road by stage to an old town with a church and old houses, peaceful, serene, old: "the old grey porch, the mullioned windows, the venerable gravestones dotting the green churchyard, the ancient tower, the very weather cock; .. . the blue Welsh mountains far away" (ch. xlvi).

Dickens too brings in the question of attitudes towards the City. If to the question of where does the novel take place, is added the question of what is the attitude of the novel toward the City, the answer is, almost unanimously, that it hates it, and with some passion. In The Rise of the Novel Ian Watt points out that at the very beginning of the English novel, in Richardson (in both his fiction and in himself) can be seen the beginning of what we have finally come to call urban neuro- sis: alienation, anxiety, loneliness. Carl Schorske makes the point that in the eighteenth, nineteenth, and twentieth centuries, three attitudes toward the City emerged in European thought: the City as Virtue; the City as Vice; and the City as beyond Good and Evil.9 (Ironically enough, in terms of what will be discussed in this paper, when Voltaire championed the City, as the home of freedom, commerce, art, industry, and pleasure, it was not Paris but London he was talking about.) The novel, of course, is almost all on the side of the thesis that the City is Vice, and this detestation is felt not only by provincial City-haters, like Tolstoy or Melville or D. H. Lawrence, but is expressed, if anything even more mordantly, by the City novelists themselves, quintessentially in Balzac, Dickens, and Dostoevsky. In some ways Remembrance of Things Past is the greatest, as it certainly is the longest, jeremiad of all. Only Henry James, almost alone of the major novelists, can be finally found to be a heartfelt, although not uncritical, celebrator of the metrop- olis and its Voltairean and civilizing virtues. The City and the novel then have a very uneasy and equivocal relationship. Of the major novelists only Henry James has practically all his novels, from first to last (and he has his country estates), take place almost entirely in the City, and he alone is a lover of the City. Looked at in this perspective then, the novel would seem to be most fundamentally oriented - even, or especially, in the age of great cities, as in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries - to its seminal archetype: Don Quixote. Only in England, in Defoe, Richardson, and Fielding, does its emergence coincide with the emergence of a modem megalop- olis. It would not be overstating things to say that for the novel the City has been the Enemy. The final or ultimate nightmare behind Dos- toevsky's unpalatable politics is that man will finally turn into an ant, and will exist in one vast ant-heap. In War and Peace when the French enter Moscow, the City is described as a ruined bee hive; its rebuilding, 9 "The Idea of the City in European Thought: Voltaire to Spengler," The Historian and the City, eds.

VICTORIAN STUDIES 300</page><page sequence="12">THE NOVEL AND THE CITY later on, is likened to a desecrated ant-hill reorganizing itself. For Mel- ville the City is a stone-desert very similar to Spengler's "Cos- mopolis": The stone Colossus, "Cosmopolis," stands at the end of the life-course of every great culture. Its image, as it appears with all its grandiose beauty in the light-world of the human eye, contains the whole noble death-symbolism of the definitive thing- become. The spirit-pervaded stone of Gothic buildings, after a millenium of style- evolution, has become the soulless material of this daemonic stone-desert.0l To which could be added the various epithets of Patrick Geddes and Lewis Mumford who, one might say, are "City-novelists": Insectopolis; Parasitopolis; Patholopolis; Psychopatholopolis; and Tyrannopolis. For Proust it is Sodom and Gomorrah. The unpleasant metaphors multiply. Perhaps the novel is now moribund because its traditional enemy, Urbs, has finally prevailed. I The first thing then to be noted about the representation of the City in the major English and American novels of the nineteenth cen- tury is that, in the American mode, it simply is not there most of the time, and that in the English mode it is not there as substantially as one might - cursorily - have thought, at least in what have come to be regarded as the major writers. (This would be, if anything, even more true of poetry, which will not concern me here.) Thus the urban classification cuts out, by and large, the major American novelists, except James, in the nineteenth century, and all the major ones of the twentieth. Applied to the English line, it would leave out the greatest English novelist of the twentieth century, D. H. Law- rence, and the second greatest, Joseph Conrad, except for The Secret Agent. In the nineteenth century it excludes Scott, Austen, Eliot, the Brontes, and Hardy (not to mention the greater part of Trollope and Meredith). In other words what disappears is most of Leavis' great tradition: Austen, Eliot, Conrad, and Lawrence (James would be saved, but for the wrong reasons, according to Leavis). The first question to be asked about the English novel in the nineteenth century, then, is why, when London, its dominant and domi- nating center, had become so huge and when the whole culture was becoming "so thoroughly of the town" that it has been said to be the first 10 Oswald Spengler, The Decline of the West (New York, 1962), p. 248.

Moreover, the growth in size was accompanied by an increase in density,l1 and thus more people were being packed into less space than ever before, a fact which could not fail to change profoundly human relationships, as Georg Simmel first recognized. It now seems certain too to the demographers that this growth of cities was accomplished almost wholly by rural-urban immi- gration, not by an indigenous increase in the population of cities where the death rate was one-third higher and the birth rate one-third lower than those of the rural areas.12 Thus it was that of as early a period as 1815 Elie Halevy could say that England was becoming bifurcated into town and country and that the country districts were becoming "enor- mous parks, solitudes abandoned to the contemplation of the artist."l3 It must, however, have appeared differently to the people of the time, and although everyone knew that cities were growing, no one could finally have seen the cataclysmic implications, which we are only really beginning to see today, of this fundamental change. In the first place, up to the present day villages or towns, which seem at last to be on the verge of being overwhelmed, have proved to be remarkably dur- able as historical institutions. Traditionally there have always been two types of human clusters, the village or town and the city. And, once more historically, the chief characteristic of the City has been its muta- bility, for it has usually been tied up with the fate of nations and empires and thus with the rise and fall of civilizations ("World-history is city- history," and "in a real sense history is the study of urban graveyards."14) Towns and villages, on the other hand, are remarkably durable and persistent, and although they may die, they are hardly ever destroyed 11 This earth-shaking change still continues; so that today in the United States 70 per cent of the population is on slightly more than 1 per cent of the land; while in Britain 40 per cent of the population occupy 4 per cent of the land.

In 1841 the life expectancy in London was 36 years; in Liverpool and Manchester, 26; in England and Wales, 41. Even as late as 1901-10 the death rate in the urban coun- ties of England and Wales was 33 per cent higher than the death rate of the rural counties. At the same time birth rates were noticeably lower in urban areas, and there is a progressive fall as well. The United States may be taken as representative: in 180o urban women had 36 per cent fewer children than their rural counterparts; in 1840, 38 per cent fewer; in 1930, 41 per cent fewer. 13 A History of the English People in 1815 (New York, 1924), p. 457. 14 Spengler, p. 247, and Gideon Sjoberg, "The Origin and Evolution of Cities," Cities, PP. 25-39.

In The City in History Lewis Mumford quotes the old proverb: Musselburgh was a burgh When Edinburgh was nane, And Musselburgh will be a burgh When Edinburgh is gane. Mumford goes on to point out that the town or the village multiplied and spread over the whole face of the earth much more rapidly and effectively than did the City and that it maintained its ancient folkways for thousands of years and survived the continued rise and destruction of its bigger, richer, more alluring rivals.15 Mumford also remarks, For what we call primitive today, even when it shows few traces of recent con- tact with more developed cultures, has behind it continuous linkages and changes over as great a span of history as any more complex national group or urban unit. Perhaps the best sources of early village culture remain in the surviving customs and superstitions, still kept alive in rural areas almost until our own day. This archaic culture, as Andre Varagac called it, seems to be the unweathered stratum beneath all the Old World cultures, however civilized and urbanized. (p. 18) If we enlarge the population of such units to the size of what Gideon Sjoberg calls the preindustrial city (population, according to him, of 5,000 to 1o,ooo) the same persistence and durability can be seen: "Not only do preindustrial cities survive today, but they have been the foci of civilization from the time of its first appearance in Mesopotamia in the fourth millenium B.C."16 Finally Mumford cites French geographer Max Sorre to the effect that even today, when the village is about to be finally wiped out by urbanization, four-fifths of the population of the world still lives in villages, functionally closer to their archetype of neo- lithic times than they are to a moder City (p. 54). In England in particular this durability of the old-style village or town or rural community, with its attendant culture, would be especially pronounced. First, even from a demographic point of view, it can be asserted that England was far from urbanized, in the modern sense, throughout most of the nineteenth century. In refuting Arthur Young, who had said in 1770 that half the population was urban, Adna Weber, one of the first of the modern demographers, said in a now classic pio- neering work that not more than one-third of the population of England and Wales in 1801 could be properly described as urban.17 And Kingsley Davis, a leading contemporary demographer, in considering the cen- 15 The City in History (New York, 1961), p. 28. 16 The Preindustrial City (New York, 1960), p. 5. 17 Adna Weber, The Growth of Cities in the Nineteenth Century (Ithaca, 1963), p. 45.

Further, in Great Britain the number of males occupied in agricultural pursuits reached its peak (1.8 million) in 1851 (in 1961 it was 0.5 million). In addition, in nine European countries during the period of fastest urban growth, the latter half of the nineteenth century, growth of cities in absolute terms was only 2.1 per cent (see n. 12). England in particular tended to be decentralized, a fact which impressed de Tocqueville, who came from a culture where the central city, Paris, tended to be dominant and where the separate parts of the country tended to have little of the rich, thick, distinctive local life as was the case with England. (In Webster's Collegiate Dictionary one of the definitions for the plural of "province" is, "In England, all the coun- try outside of London.") Asa Briggs points out that London did not be- come completely dominant until the 189o's and that throughout the cen- tury the provincial cities, especially the older ones, bitterly resisted, and protested against, the constantly growing size and importance of Lon- don: "The story of Victorian cities in the nineteenth century is the story of separate provincial cultures which during the last ten years of Queen Victoria's reign were increasingly 'nationalized.' "18 As important - or more important - as the facts are the myths, and England is in some respects the ancestral home of the myth of the rural paradise. In surveying European culture as a whole, Schorske speaks of even Adam Smith as embodying "that nostalgia for the rural life which was to characterize so much of England's thought on the city during the nineteenth century" (p. 1oo). Schorske mentions Gold- smith's, Wordsworth's, Blake's, and Coleridge's assaults upon the mod- ern megalopolis and their accompanying apotheosis of the rural or pro- vincial life. What happened in England in the nineteenth century, in my opin- ion, is that the myths of rural goodness and of urban evil, though both having a considerable basis in fact, became exaggerated and did in fact take on the status of Myth. Cobbett had christened the City "The Wen" and the complicated financial structure (all urban sociologists remark on the fact that when Christopher Wren redesigned London after the Great Fire he placed the Royal Exchange rather than St. Paul's at the architectural center) that held it up "The Thing." Malthus, so potent a figure in nineteenth-century thought, had denounced urban life as un- 18 Victorian Cities (London, 1963), p. 45; see also pp. 376-377, 41. By 1960 the 845 square miles of greater London contained one-fifth of the total population and one- third of the total ratable value of all property in England (Frank Smallwood, Greater London [Indianapolis, 1965], p. 55). VICTORIAN STJDIES 304</page><page sequence="16">THE NOVEL AND THE CITY wholesome and unclean. Most of the great Victorians, as is well known, lamented the coming of the rail and romanticized the coaching days. Nostalgia is one of the great, pervasive notes or moods of the age. When Monckton Milnes reviewed the "historical" novel Middlemarch, he re- marked that it seemed to him that it belonged to a "somewhat older form of our society than that of the days of the first Reform Bill."19 Older men at the end of the century, looking back, thought they had once walked in Elysian Fields. Thus Sir Francis Doyle in his Reminiscences, in which he frequently remarks on the "terrible" condition of a great modern city, calls up the spring in the country in 1832: The spring of 1832 was more beautiful than any spring that I remember.... Throughout the whole month of May, from morning to evening, the sun shown brilliantly, though a soft west wind kept the air tolerably cool; but every night the clouds gathered, and heavy rain fell till shortly before dawn. The result was an affluence of bloom, and a splendor of vegetation that made England look more like what we conceive the Elysian Field to have been.20 Along with this went the moral myth of rural goodness and sim- plicity. It mattered not that a rural clergyman wrote to Henry Mayhew that things were much improved in the country: that twenty years ago in his parish there was not a virgin in the village, or a man that was not, or had not been, a drunkard, but that now everything was better, with a change in land allotments and because of the impact of such urban institutions as horticultural societies, lending libraries, and so on.21 Or that Macaulay could ask, rhetorically, in a review of Southey, "Does Mr. Southey think that the body of the English peasantry live, or ever lived, in substantial or ornamented cottages, with box-hedges, flower- gardens, and orchards?"22 Or that George Eliot could say, But no one who has seen much of actual ploughmen thinks them jocound; no one who is well acquainted with the English peasantry can pronounce them merry. The slow gaze, in which no sense of beauty beams, no humour twinkles, - the slow utterance, and the heavy slouching walk, remind one rather of that melancholy animal the camel, than that of the sturdy countryman, with striped stockings, red waistcoat, and hat aside who represents the traditional English peasant.23 Though the squirearchy lived gracefully and graciously, the peasantry had it otherwise. In a recent review of Sybil Marshall's Fenland Chron- icle Angus Wilson mentions "the brutish, sterile life to which the country 19 Edinburgh Review, CXXXVII (1873), 248. 20 Reminiscences and Opinions (New York, 1887), p. 410. 21 London Labour and the London Poor, 4 vols.

Whether anyone actually believed this, literally, it is difficult to say, but that the image certainly provided a powerful tug on all sensitive souls is indu- bitable. True or not, there could be no one who was appalled - and most were - by the ravages of City, mine, factory, and railroad who would not have liked to live in the world called up by the children's rhyme, "The Boy," which was cited by Chesterton as the likely refrain for the life of Cobbett: Bees are bees of Paradise Do the work of Jesus Christ Do the work that no man can; God made bees and bees make honey God made man and man makes money God made man to plough and reap and sow, And God made little boys to scare away the crow.25 I think what disturbed and frightened most people the most, as it still does, was simply never-ceasing change, and the change itself seemed to extend to almost everything, even to Oxford. In his Romanes Lec- tures on Gladstone, G. M. Young says, "Of Oxford, Mark Pattison said that a man who had gone to sleep in 1846 and woken up in 1850 would have found himself in another world."26 Young continues, "the differ- ence between the England of the last Chartist demonstration in 1848 and the Great Exhibition of 1851, is like the difference in one's own feel- ings at the beginning and end of a voyage in wartime through waters beset by enemy ships" (p. 25). The image of imminent disaster was not far from some minds. On 18 March 1828 Lady Holland wrote to her son and described an accident, a run-away carriage, with the driver killed: "Accidents are becoming much more frequent within these few years."27 In the novel in particular the nostalgic mode is built into the medium, nowhere more so than with the urbanists themselves, like Dickens and Thackeray, where the ubi sunt theme is in many ways the dominant one. All of them, as Kathleen Tillotson has pointed out, tended to follow Scott in placing their novels back in time. They had all been brought up on Scott, and in his work there was at least one great and grim picture of the antithesis between town and country, between fu- 24 The Observer, 9 April 1967, p. 27. 25 William Cobbett (London, n.d.), p. 3. 26 Mr. Gladstone (Oxford, 1944), p. 24. 27 Lady Holland to her Son, ed.

It occurs in the Introduction to Chronicles of the Cannongate: A nobler contrast can hardly exist than that of the huge city, dark with the smoke of ages, and groaning with the various sounds of active industry or idle revel, and the lofty and craggy hill, silent and solitary as the grave; one exhibiting the full tide of existence, pressing and precipitating itself forward with the force of an inunda- tion; the other resembling some timeworn anchorite, whose life passes as silent and unobserved as the slender rill which escapes unheard, and scarce seen, from the fountain of his patron saint. The city resembles the busy temple, where the modem Comus and Mammon hold their court, and thousands sacrifice ease, independence, and virtue itself at their shrine; the misty and lonely mountain seems as a throne to the majestic but terrible Genius of feudal times, when the same divinities dispensed coronets and domains to those who had heads to devize, and arms to execute, bold enterprises.28 The corollary of the myth of rural beauty and virtue was the idea of the absolute Evil of the City, with the result that even in the urban novelists the pomp and power of a world capital, the beauty of certain districts, the amenities of a high civilization, all of which London embodied, are seldom seen. What is seen most often is squalor, misery, poverty, and, above all, the "blackness" of London, both figuratively and literally. I think, however, that London or any of the new large cities must have been equally disturbing, at almost a subconscious level, for two other reasons (not that the squalor was to be disregarded): one, it was so large that no one could grasp it; and, second, it was always chang- ing and growing, so that it constituted a new paradox in man's history: a huge "thing" that was "alive." And in some ways it is these aspects that were finally to defeat the imagination even of a Dickens or a Balzac. For this part of the problem I can do no better than to quote the words of a contemporary Englishman, Richard Church: I have known London since my birth in it more than seventy years ago. Still it is largely unknown to me. Like the fabulous serpent Ouroboros, it is a self-consuming organism, perpetually destroying and renewing its fabric. The scope of these articu- lations is too vast for one man's comprehension. He sees changes here and there, in districts and institutions familiar to him, and in moments of enlarged imaginative insight he can appreciate the gradualism of this awe-striking metabolism, the self- maintenance of a great city. Balzac tried to present the dreaded "wholeness" of Paris; Dickens that of London. Both captured only fragmentary sloughings of this metamorphosis.29 In so far as a great City was imaginatively graspable, it seemed to be a gigantic embodiment of the Manichean dualism and the Mani- chean struggle.

MARCH 1968 307</page><page sequence="19">John Henry Raleigh London Poor in 1861 the Rev. William Tucknis said just this: "London then may be considered as the grand central focus of operations, at once the emporium of crime and the palladium of Christianity. It is, in fact, the great arena of conflict between the powers of darkness and the ministry of heaven. Here, within the area of our metropolis, the real struggle is maintained between the two antagonistic principles of good and evil" (IV, xv). Because of the historic East-West cleavage of Lon- don, which had begun in Elizabethan times, this duality was physically palpable: in Asa Briggs' words, "The 'two worlds' of London, one dark and mysterious, the other dazzling and ostentatious" (p. 328). One would have thought that such a grandiose duality would have engaged the imagination of novelists, but such was not the case, except for Henry James. Either the City was ignored or only one side of the antithesis was taken hold of. Thus in Scott, Austen, Eliot, the Brontes, Hardy, and D. H. Lawrence, the City is, by and large, passed by, and its rendering after Dickens seems to have passed, by way of Gissing - the grimmest city-portrayer of them all - to Arnold Bennett, John Galsworthy, H. G. Wells, and, in a very special way, to Virginia Woolf. The other tradition, which ends with Lawrence, becomes, as it goes on, more and more archaic, turning back more to the past in Hardy and becoming positively primitivistic in Lawrence. At the same time its denunciations of its rival and conqueror-to-be, the City, become more passionate and all-encompassing. One of the basic dramas in Hardy's novels is the intrusion of an interloper or devil figure, who is usually an urbanite, into a rural paradise, as in Far From the Maddening Crowd. At a charitable estimate, Lawrence's concept of the City was that it, and its inhabitants, were obscenities, as, for example, in Women in Love, in which the industrial system that in part built the City is also mordantly analyzed. In any event the last expression of genuine genius in the English novel was that of the archaic culture that had already been left behind by the culture of the twentieth-century City. A final summarizing word on the chief differences in English culture between the City-novel and the Provincial-novel, which are four-fold. Obviously, the natural world came in, often with great splen- dor, in the Provincial genre. Second, as might be expected, the satiric impulse is stronger in the City-novel. Third, passionate love, as in the Brontes, Hardy, and Lawrence, seems to be a believable, and a drama- tizable, human emotion in the Provinces, whereas in the City-novel, as in Dickens and Thackeray, it dwindles to nothing but the narrator's statement that it exists. Fourth, time in the City-novel is clock time (the ringing of Big Ben, the chimes of Mrs. Dalloway); whereas in the VICTORIAN STUDIES 3o8</page><page sequence="20">THE NOVEL AND THE CITY Provincial-novel time is rhythmic (the roll of the seasons in Hardy or Lawrence). Hence Virginia Woolfs preoccupation with duration, and hence Lawrence's rhapsodies on the life outside of time.30 II The American novel and the English novel of the nineteenth cen- tury are in some ways a cultural continuum, with Dickens' London at one end of the spectrum and Cooper's prairie or Melville's Pacific at the other, with in-between the various gradations of city, town, village, and countryside. The authors often knew one another and certainly read one another. The overpowering influence of Dickens can be seen in such disparate American writers as Melville (the first part of "Bar- tleby the Scrivener" is straight Dickens), Henry James (The Princess Cassimassima is full of Dickensian touches), and Mark Twain (Senator Dillworthy in The Gilded Age is the American Pecksniff). The cultural situation was analogous: cataclysmic change and the dream of a stable, rural paradise. If anything the Myth of the rural paradise is even stronger in America, being built into the very ideologi- cal fabric, through Jefferson and others, of the culture. Henry Nash Smith says, "One of the most significant facts of American intellectual history is the slow and inadequate fashion in which the momentum of the new forces was appreciated, or, to put the matter another way, the astonishing longevity of the agrarian ideal in the accepted view of Western society."31 And R. Richard Wohl remarks that there is in 30 One of the most pervasive senses of the City is, of course, the sense of Time, and this sense seemed to have been especially developed in London in the nineteenth century. A visiting German, Frederick Von Raumer, remarked: "No where is time more precious than here; the value the English set upon it is conspicuous in everything" (England in 1835, trans. Sarah Austin and H. E. Lloyd [Philadelphia, 1836], p. 62). And this preoccupation with mathematically-measured time is one of the chief differences be- tween ancient cities and modern cities. In the Daily Life of Ancient Rome, trans. E. O. Lorimer (New Haven, 1960), Jerome Carcopino points out that Roman time was elastic or fluid, the length of day and night and hour perpetually varying day by day and season by season, with no sense of the exact sixty seconds to a minute, sixty minutes to the hour, of modern concept and practise: "These simple facts had a profound in- fluence on Roman life . . . [which] was never regulated with mathematical precision. . . . Busy as life was in Urbs, it continued to have an elasticity unknown to any modern capital. For another thing, as the length of the Roman day was indefinitely modified by the diversity of the seasons, life went through phases whose intensity varied with the dimensions of the daily hour, weaker in the sombre months, stronger when the fine luminous days returned; which is another way of saying that even in the great swarming city, life remained rural in style and in pace" (p. 150). Someone like Lawrence, obviously, harkens back to this time-sense. 31 Virgin Land (Cambridge, Mass., 1950), p. 159. For a summary of the persistence of this attitude in America's writers and intellectuals, see Morton and Lucia White's The Intellectual Versus The City (New York, 1964). This book, it should be said, is a catalogue of opinions and not an evaluation of them. For a thorough and illuminating discussion of "ruralism" and the impact of technology in American culture, see Leo Marx's The Machine in the Garden (New York, 1964).

In the first place every culture develops its cities in its own unique, historically "given," ways. In the Decline of the West Spengler, who hated cities, argued that German cities had evolved in such a special way as to set them off, almost in kind, from other European cities. So Christopher Dawson argues for the uniqueness of the English urban historical pattern, as contrasted to that of the Continental: And whilst in France and the countries under French influence, the Renaissance monarchy gradually changed all this [the contempt of the feudal lord for the town and townspeople], and converted the nobility into a new class of courtier-townsmen, in England the Renaissance monarchy was defeated and the landed aristocracy gained control of the whole political order. The country squires, the lineal descend- ants of the medieval landowners, still lived on their own estates, with a true feudal contempt of the city, and a more than medieval passion for the chase. As Justices of the Peace they were the true rulers of the country; and, as members of Parliament, they absorbed the power formerly possessed by the Court on the one hand, and the yeomanry and the corporate towns on the other. The whole evolution of English society from the seventeenth to the eighteenth century was the inverse of that of the continent; it moved from Urban monarchy to rural aristocracy. And it was the England that followed these traditions and was governed by this class that was sud- denly precipitated into the full current of the Industrial Revolution.34 And the American historical context was totally different from either the Continental or the English. For one thing, the word "city" in Amer- ica is an exceedingly ambiguous term since it can be applied officially, and often is, to clusters of buildings and people that could best be de- scribed accurately as villages or hamlets. In the United States the title of "city" is granted by state legislatures. This investiture confers full municipal functions and was widely bestowed in the nineteenth century. In England, on the other hand, "city" is a title conferred on towns for some preeminence and does not in itself confer municipal functions. As a result, in England and Wales in 1956 there were 47 cities; while in the United States in 1950 there were 4,284.

It is extraordinarily difficult to make any generalizations about American cities. As Alan Trachtenberg says, "The impact of the city upon American culture is one of the most obscure problems historians face."35 About the only thing one can say with certainty is that most of the successful ones were founded near water, either harbor or river. As Anthony Trollope said, "They have known that water carriage is almost a necessity for commercial success, and have chosen their sites accordingly."36 Moreover there was no consistent pattern of evolution of cities on the American continent. Some on the Eastern seaboard had evolved slowly and haphazardly in the European pattern, although in a much shorter space of time. Trollope described the English historical process: Two or three dozen men required habitations in the same locality, and clustered them together closely. Many such have failed and died out of the world's notice. Others have thriven, and houses have been packed on to houses, till London and Manchester, Dublin and Glasgow have been produced. Poor men have built, or have had built for them, wretched lanes, and rich men have created grand palaces. From the nature of their beginnings such has, of necessity, been the manner of their creation. (p. 126) But visiting the American Midwest Trollope came to feel that American cities were the first cities in history that were genuinely planned. America, he thought, was the heiress of all the ages, besides having endless space. To her city-founders were known: sanitation, modern construction, the need for light and air, for broad streets, and so on. These American cities were genuinely created de novo; further, they often were, in the greedy imaginations of their "booster" founders, future Romes. "The city at its commencement is laid out with an in- tuition that it shall be populous" (p. 126). Repeated failures, villages that never did grow into towns or cities, disturbed the empire-building not at all. In a weird and quite unconscious way, the founding of this type of American city was a reenactment, in secular rather than religious terms, of the ritual drama by which ancient cities were founded, as Romulus and Remus created Rome at a stroke. Fustel de Coulanges remarks that ancient cities were never created by degrees: "They founded a city at once, all entire in a day."37 Or perhaps there is a better parallel in the historical, rather than the mythical, building of Rome.

As Lewis Mumford puts it, "a scale so gigantic that either its builders must have clairvoyantly seen, at the earliest moment, that this heap of villages would become a me- tropolis of a million inhabitants, or else they must have taken it for granted that the chief business and ultimate end of life is the physio- logical function of evacuation" (p. 214). In the far Western United States still another pattern of city-building evolved. As described by Josiah Strong: "In the Middle West the farms were first taken, then the town sprung up to supply their wants, and at length the railroad con- nected it with the world; but in the West the order is reversed - first the railroad, then the town, then the farms. Settlement is, consequently, much more rapid; and the city stamps the country, instead of the coun- try's stamping the city."38 The burgeoning of these cities occurred on a scale unprecedented in history, and all classes of cities, that is, all sizes, continued to grow. Here is Adna Weber's table (p. 40): 18oo 1850 1890 Classes of Cities No. Pop. No. Pop.

At the same time America had no dominant City, as was the case with London and England, and no Dickens or Thackeray to por- tray it if in fact it had existed. De Tocqueville had noticed this in the 1830's, and James Russell Lowell, throughout a long career, continuously lamented the lack of a literary capital, such as London provided for England and Paris for France.39 Nor was there amidst all this bustling, anarchic centripetalism any stabilizing element from the past, such as provided an anchor for European cities. The elder statesman of American letters in the nine- teenth century was James Russell Lowell, and the lament for the non- existence of an American past is one of the ground-themes of his work. In "Cambridge Thirty Years Ago" (1844), he spelled out the dilemma: 38 Our Country (Cambridge, Mass., 1963), p. 198. This was originally published in 1886. 39 Thus there was no real "literary life," as in Europe. For example, Ludwig Lewisohn reported that Theodore Dreiser had once wanted him (Lewisohn) to do a book about him, and added: "In any continental country this [need] would have been seen. But in America there still prevailed the silly notion that only the dead are worth discussing" (Cities and Men [New York, 1927], p. 92). VICTORIAN STUDIES 312</page><page sequence="24">THE NOVEL AND THE CITY 313 For so rapid are our changes in America that the transition from old to new, the shifting from habits and associations to others entirely different, is as rapid almost as the passing in of one scene and the drawing out of another. Here, as in a theatre, the great problems of anthropology- which in the Old World were ages in solving but which are solved, leaving only a dry net result - are compressed, as it were into the entertainment of a few hours.40 Thus perhaps the signal difference between English cities and American cities is that the American cities had no real "past," so to speak, and have had no anchors therein, and were thus always oriented toward the future and hoped-for growth. Thus they tend to be much more fluid than their English counterpart; and they have always been, and still are, in a permanent state of transition. Wohl has said that American cities regularly pass "through a whole series of cycles of obsolescence" (p. 54). For example, in 1900, when the street-car mode of transportation was at its height, it would have been possible, for a determined and indefatigable man, to travel from New York to Sheboy- gan, Wisconsin, by street car. Now the street cars are gone, except for the cable cars of San Francisco, an inefficient but colorful anachronism lovingly clung to by the citizenry (and the Chamber of Commerce). Except for a brief interlude in the eighteenth or nineteenth century in Boston or New York or Philadelphia or Charleston, which was funda- mentally oriented to Europe anyway, there was none of the centuries- old stability of so many European cities. In "Brooklyniana," a series of articles written for the Brooklyn Standard in 1861-62, Walt Whitman, who was a celebrator of the City, evidenced some dis-ease about the lack of stability: "The whole spirit of a floating and changing population like ours is antagonistic to the recording or preserving of what tradi- tions we have of the American Past."41 To the anarchical tendencies was added grievous political cor- ruption, for American cities have been awesomely ill-governed, as James Bryce pointed out. In Wohl's words: "In a very literal sense, the insub- stantial structure of American cities was jerry-built like many of the slums" (p. 54). Their governmental dialectic has thus been between corruption and malfeasance, on the one hand, and short-lived reform on the other. (In older American movies the "pols" at City Hall are always cleverer, if more cynical, than the starry-eyed reformers.) What happened was that American city governments were originally set up on the model of the state legislature, with a resulting corruption that saw to it that every interest was taken care of except the public interest. Genuine reform has come about in the late nineteenth and twentieth 40 The Works of James Russell Lowell (Boston and New York, 1904), I, 13. 41 Quoted by Alan Trachtenberg, Brooklyn Bridge (New York, 1965), p. 37. MARCH 1968</page><page sequence="25">John Henry Raleigh centuries when the American city began to model itself after its Euro- pean counterpart with a strong office for a mayor, or a city manager, and a council. Thus, in contradistinction to the "newness" and "unique- ness" of American cities that I have been stressing here, one might say that in respect of governance, they have had to reenact in a short period of time the development of a governmental structure for cities that Europe had evolved over centuries.42 And when these cities came to be packed with emigrants, as they were in the later nineteenth century, they seemed to be, to the Protestant-rural imagination of America, great hives of corruption and crime. Thus when Theron Ware, in The Dam- nation of Theron Ware, the novel par excellence of the American small town in the nineteenth century, meets a Catholic for the first time, his imagination conjures up the Inferno of the City: "sculptured rows of lowering, ape-like faces ... and out of these sprang into the vague upper gloom, on the one side, lamp-posts from which negroes hung by the neck, and on the gibbets for dynamiters and Molly Maguires; and be- tween the two glowed a spectral picture of some black-robed, tonsured men, with leering satanic masks, making a bonfire of the Bible in public schools."43 And, in fact, the reality was often sufficiently horrific: But hell-holes there were. The city [Chicago] was filthy with mud, offal, and sewage. Streets, barely above lake level, were unpaved. Sewage fed into the river and thence out into the lake, the source of the city's drinking water. Evil smells permeated everything. Typhoid, smallpox, and cholera struck yearly; tuberculosis was chronic. The city's death rate in 1855 exceeded New Orleans'. In summer the heat could be stifling; in winter bitter winds swept in across a thousand miles of prairie to cut through the flimsy boards of the hastily built huts and shanties that housed much of the city. Prostitutes, gamblers, and card-sharpers, drunkards, confi- dence men, pickpockets, thieves, and murderers flourished in a community where everyone appeared to be too intent on getting ahead to be greatly concerned. There was vulgarity, vice, and violence, but there was also virtue, and always vitality. About the hot winds of summer and the icy blasts of winter the city could do nothing. About the crime and petty viciousness she did little beyond applauding an occasional police raid or voicing protests over police laxity; Chicago's reputation as a Gehenna of Abominations would endure for decades.44 By the late nineteenth century the great American city seemed to some reformers the Sodom and Gommorah of Western civilization.

All the dangers of all these perils, Mormonism excepted, were increased in the City: "The city is the nerve center of our civilization. It is also the storm center" (p. 171). And in the introduction to The Man from Main Street Sinclair Lewis remarked, "Back in 1905, in America, it was almost universally known that though cities were evil and even in the farmland there were occasional men of wrath, our villages were approximately Paradise."45 Moreover, many of the cities were - and are - just plain ugly.46 When the American critic W. C. Brownell returned to America from some years in Paris, he was struck upon entering New York harbor, and getting a first glimpse of New York itself, by its "characterless individ- ualism." Paris had been complete and homogeneous; New York was all materialism and individualism.47 Robert Herrick makes much the same point about Chicago (Grove Avenue): "India, the Spanish-American countries, might show something fouler as far as mere filth, but nothing so incomparably mean and long.... The same blunt expression of wilful individuality was evident in every line of the building. It was the apoth- eosis of democratic individualism."48 And as in England, only more so, the cities became the largest and most visible sign of that ceaseless change that was the mark of American life. Edith Wharton said that between the point of view of her Huguenot great-grandfather who came from the French Palatinate to participate in the founding of New Rochelle and that of her own father who died in 1882, there were fewer differences than between her father and the post-war (W.W.I) generation.49 At the same time, as in Eng- land, the lure of the City continued unabated, so much so that by the 188o's, the crucial decade in their growth, some states initiated "back to the farm" movements.50 Cities then semed to offer nothing to the imagi- nation but growth, change, corruption, crime, poverty, and ugliness. Thus, as in England, only more so, the splendors and amenities of the City simply never appear and when the City itself does come into liter- ature, as in Pierre, it is the Stone Desert. Indeed almost from the begin- 45 The Man from Main Street, ed. Harry E. Maule and Melville Cane (New York, 1953), p. 214. 46 H. J.

MARCH 1968 315</page><page sequence="27">John Henry Raleigh ning it seemed to some astute observers that there was something posi- tively ominous about the future and fate of the great and growing American cities. No less than de Tocqueville prophesied: The United States has no metropolis, but it already contains several very large cities .... The lower ranks which inhabit these cities constitute a rabble even more formidable than the populace of European towns. They consist of freed blacks, in the first place, who are condemned by the laws and by public opinion to a heredi- tary state of misery and degradation. They also contain a multitude of Europeans who have been driven to the shores of the New World by their misfortunes or their misconduct; . .. as inhabitants of a country where they have no civil rights, they are ready to turn all the passions which agitate the community to their own advan- tage; thus, within the last few months, serious riots have broken out in Philadelphia and New York.... Nevertheless, I look upon the size of certain American cities, and especially on the nature of their population, as a real danger which threatens the future security of the democratic republics of the New World; and I venture to predict that they will perish from this circumstance, unless the government succeeds in creating an armed force which, while it remains under the control of the majority of the nation, will be independent of the town population and able to repress its excesses.51 But the mainstream of America, or the mainstream of American ideology, throughout much of the nineteenth century, flowed through the small town. De Tocqueville noted in his journal: "the town is the ultimate individual in the American system."52 According to Page Smith America was really appropriated and organized by the small town, "the most intense community experience of modem times."53 Even when in the late nineteenth century the City began to appropriate the Continent the small town ethos still prevailed - as it in some ways still does. In Thorstein Veblen's words: "it is the soul of the country town that goes marching on."54 But even the American town or village very often had not the stability and permanence, or even the clear out- line, of its European counterpart. When de Tocqueville saw Pontiac - twenty neat and pretty houses and "the eternal forest about" - he re- marked, "The sight of this place recalled to me what Mr. Gallatin had said in New York a month before: 'There are no villages in America, at least in the sense you give the word.' Here the houses of the farmers are scattered through their fields."55 51 Democracy in America, Reeves translation, Vintage Edition (New York, 1954), I, xviii, n. 1. 52 Journey to America, ed. J. P.

At the beginning of Israel Potter Melville takes the reader on a tour of the Berkshire mountains of Massachusetts, and one of the sights is the deserted buildings: Though they have never known aught but peace and health, they, in one lesser aspect at least, look like countries depopulated by plague and war. Every mile or two a house is passed untenanted, the strength of the frame-work of these ancient buildings enables them long to resist encroachments of decay. Spotted grey and green with the weatherstain, their timbers seem to have lapsed back into their woodland original, forming part now of the general picturesqueness of the natural scene.56 But the English countryside which he subsequently visits provides quite the opposite impression: "The villages surprised him by their number and proximity. Nothing like this was to be seen at home" (ch. iii). Writ- ing in the twentieth century, Van Wyck Brooks remarked on the insta- bility of the American village: "But it is the American village that most betrays the impulse of our civilization, a civilization that perpetually overreaches itself only to be obliged to surrender again and again to nature everything it has granted."57 Like London itself, American urban life was perpetually renewing and destroying itself. Moreover, life in these little rural towns was very often likely to be mean and barren and sterile, as was to be shown by Mark Twain, by Edith Wharton's Ethan Frome, Ed Howe's The Story of a Country Town, Harold Frederic's The Damnation of Theron Ware, Eugene O'Neill's Desire under the Elms, and other "exposure" literature of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries.58 In a lecture, "The American Van- the houses are scattered all over the country. What you take for villages had better be called towns as they are inhabited by shopkeepers, craftsmen and lawyers" (Journey to America, p. 21). 56 Israel Potter (New York, 1957), ch. i. 57 "Enterprise," The Seven Arts, I (1916-17), 58. 58 The debate about rural virtue and urban vice went on in America, with much to be said on both sides. But the Myth of Rurality was by far the more potent. One sociologist who tried to redress the balance on the side of reality was Adna Weber, who put the case against Josiah Strong. In The Growth of Cities in the Nineteenth Century he gave the following instance of smalltown "virtue." It is a quotation from the Hartford Times about the assault, robbery, and murder of one Mrs. McCloud of Shelburne Falls, Mass., by one Jack O'Neil: "This is a lesson for our New England communities in the career of Jack O'Neil, the Shelburne Falls hoodlum and ne'er-do-well. O'Neil was what the specialists would describe as a true degenerate. He was an idle, worthless, drunken, penniless fellow, hanging around the entrances to the village dramshops (of which Shelburne Falls plainly has too many), sponging his food and lodging out of his mother, a hard-working washer-woman, and as sure to develop into a criminal as darkness is to succeed daylight.... The evidence at the trial in Greenfield showed that O'Neil was only one of a gang of youthful 'bums' and hoodlums who are tolerated in Shelburne Falls, and whose ill-gotten gains furnish considerable support for a lot of cheap and nasty dramshops which disgrace the place. How many other New England villages present the same conditions? A good many to our certain knowledge" (p. 407). MARCH 1968 317</page><page sequence="29">John Henry Raleigh dal," first given in November 1867 and later widely delivered, Mark Twain said, "You never saw a bigoted, opinionated, stubborn, narrow- minded, self-conceited, almighty mean man but he had stuck in one place ever since he was born and thought God made the world and dyspepsia and bile for his especial comfort and satisfaction."59 On the other hand, the solidities, the simplicities, and the reassurances of American small-town life, which must have been real, in great part, appear only in popular literature, hardly ever in serious literature. Serious writers knew, however unhappily, that the City was here to stay. In Harold Frederic's Seth's Brother's Wife, Irene, a sophisticate, says, "The trail of the serpent is over it all - rich and poor, big and little. The nineteenth century is a century of cities; they have given their own twist to the progress of the age - and the farmer is almost as far out of it as if he lived in Alaska. Perhaps there may have been a time when a man could live in what the poet calls daily communication with Nature and not starve his mind and dwarf his soul, but this isn't the cen- tury."60 Amidst all these contradictions, one cultural fact was apparent, namely that for the American novelist, there was no real national cul- ture, in the English sense, nor was there that sustaining provincial cul- ture that nourished some of the English novelists. I could not add much to what I regard as the brilliant exposition by Richard Chase of the differences between the British and the American novel in his intro- duction to The American Novel and Its Tradition (1957), except to em- phasize, from the point of view I am sketching here, that there is in the American line no real tradition at all. All the English novelists are in a genuine, if multistranded, literary-cultural tradition. If you look at Dick- ens you can see behind him Scott and Smollett and Ben Jonson, among others; at Thackeray, and Scott and Fielding appear; at Scott, and the whole eighteenth-century tradition is apparent. But there is almost noth- ing, in the sense of a genuine indigenous literary culture, behind Cooper or Poe or Hawthorne or Melville or James or Dreiser. As a result all im- portant American writers are a new start. This may account, in part anyway, for the travail and loneliness of their lives and perhaps for their failures but also almost certainly for their originality and their dark inwardness, which was lost on their contemporaries but has intrigued the twentieth century, from D. H. Lawrence on. It accounts too for the fact that the American novel does not move in a kind of flowing "river," such as English culture provided for its novelists. But the "river" has 59 Mark Twain's Speeches, ed. A. B. Paine (New York, 1923), p. 30. 60 Seth's Brother's Wife (New York, 1887), pp. 32-33. VICTORIAN STUDIES 318</page><page sequence="30">THE NOVEL AND THE CITY also a kind of "braking" or inhibiting effect, and without it, as in the American "tradition," a genre moves by a series of quantum jumps, with the result that the medium itself in America develops with startling rapidity: from Wieland in 1798; to The Pioneers in 1823; to The Scarlet Letter in 1850; to Moby Dick in 1851; to Portrait of a Lady in 1881. There is less than a century between the preposterosities of Charles Brockden Brown - and much less than a half century between the cru- dities of James Fenimore Cooper - and the fine, rare mastery of the medium exhibited by Henry James, at whose feet European practitioners were to sit. The evolution of subject matter is even more startling: from raw and wild frontier (Cooper) to the urban and urbane drawing room (James). With Dreiser and Sister Carrie the modem American mega- lopolis finally emerges in the novel full blown, as the living, breathing "monster" of Dickens' and Balzac's imagination.61 But while the nation, in part, accepted the myth of the rural para- dise, the novelist, unlike his English counterpart, did not, although he paid lip-service to it. What he did accept, even more fervently and com- pletely than his English equivalent, was the idea of the City as the "City of Dis" (although only Melville gives it a full dramatization). He turned away from the whole thing, the bustling, ever-changing, frenetic scene; and, lacking a sustaining provincial culture, he either turned to its physical fringes (Cooper) or remained there (Twain); or he moved outside of it, East or West (James to Europe, Melville to the Pacific), or he turned back to the past (Hawthorne and Twain). Thus the major efforts of the American novel, during the century of City-building, have their imagined setting on the Western frontier, in seventeenth-century Salem, on the Pacific Ocean, on the Mississippi River, and in European country estates and cities. Essentially, however, the American scene is an exaggeration of the English scene: the retreat from the metropolis and Urbs as Enemy. In both cultures the history of the novel and the history of cities are askew. III I now propose to undermine the argument outlined above by showing how important was the City to the imagination of specific novelists. But first I should like to make some preliminary generaliza- tions. The first concerns the differences in the manner in which the 61 Properly speaking the urban novel does not begin in America until Dreiser. See Blanche Housman Galfant's The American City Novel (Norman, Okla., 1954). MARCH 1968 319</page><page sequence="31">John Henry Raleigh City is treated by British and American novelists. In a general way (and I would have to add twentieth-century American writers like Dreiser and Dos Passos to make the contrast) the essential differences between the English fictional City and the American fictional City is that the English City tends to be presented in more detail and more literally and is thus more concrete, tangible, and "human." Whereas the American City tends to be presented more impressionistically or ab- stractly or symbolically and is thus more "inhuman" (Dickens and Mel- ville are good examples of these divergent tendencies). De Tocqueville had predicted that Americans would be pantheists. We have, however, turned out to be pantheists-in-reverse; the universe is full of meaning but all of it is dark and confused, or confusing. Thus it is that Melville is the prophetic soul of the national psyche. But having said that the City in English and American fiction is different, one must immediately add that as every city is unique, every novelist differs in his treatment of it (and he can also change his attitude over his career as a whole, as did Dickens). I propose to demonstrate this by three specific examples, which, happily, provide an almost novel- istic symmetry: an American, Melville; a Britisher, Dickens; and an Anglo-American or an Americano-Britisher, James. Melville: the City as a Metaphysical Entity Foreign cities appear in Redburn (Liverpool and London) and Israel Potter (London and Paris). "Bartleby the Scrivener" takes place in New York, as does part of Pierre. Cities are invariably Evil, heartless, remorseless, indifferent. In Israel Potter London is the "City of Dis," grimy, crowded, always in motion, "the gulf-stream of humanity- which, for continuous centuries, has never ceased pouring, like an end- less shoal of herring, over London Bridge." "London, adversity, and the sea, three Armageddons, which, at one and the same time, slay and secrete their victims" (ch. xxv). Liverpool means poverty and starvation. New York is blank, heartless, and cruelly indifferent. Pierre is the Ameri- can Paradise Lost, as the characters fall from the beautiful rural para- dise of upper New York State into the heartless voids of New York, and finally to destruction. But the real significance of Melville and the City goes deeper than this. At the deepest strata of Melville's imagination is, as usual, an antithesis between two substances: one is huge (it can be bounded or unbounded), cold, abstract, colorless (it can be either white or blank), inhuman, frightening, unknown, indifferent, silent; the other is small, VICTORIAN STUDIES 320</page><page sequence="32">THE NOVEL AND THE CITY enclosed (often), concrete, green, fecund, creative, life-giving and life- renewing. In John Marr and Other Sailors with Some Sea Pieces there are two companion poems - "The Berg" - "Hard Berg (methought) so cold, so vast" - and "The Enviable Isles" - "But nearer, green; and, on the marge, the sea. / Sweet-fern and moss in many a glade are here" - which illustrate this antithesis expressly, but it crops up constantly in Melville's work. At times the sea itself (which is a constantly changing metaphor) is seen as this appalling "Other," as in Moby Dick in the chapter entitled "Brit," where the mind or the consciousness or the un- consciousness of man is seen as a vast and terrible sea, with its creatures practising universal cannibalism but within it there is a tiny "insular Tahiti": the "Other" is also, of course, the subject of the chapter "The Whiteness of the Whale," with the "green" being the mind of Ishmael shuddering at the white, vast blanknesses of the universe. In Pierre when the protagonist and his two young lady friends, Isabel and Delly, arrive in New York, it is, significantly, night-time, and the following dialogue (which I condense) is heard: Pierre: "The pavements, Isabel; this is the town." Delly: "It feels not so soft as the greensward." Pierre: "No, Miss Ulver, the buried hearts of some dead citizens have perhaps come to the surface." Pierre: ". . . never yet have I entered the city by night, but, somehow, it made me feel both bitter and sad." Isabel: "What are they [side-streets]? They seem terribly still. I see scarce any body in them;- there's another. See how haggardly look its cris-cross, far-separate lamps." Isabel: "But I like not the town. Think'st thou, Pierre, the time will come when all the earth shall be paved?" Isabel: "These silent side-glooms [streets] are horrible; ..." Isabel: "Pierre, this silence is unnatural, is fearful. The forests are never so still." Pierre: "Because brick and mortar have deeper secrets than wood or fell, sweet Isabel."62 Later on they see people, movement, vice, degradations, and hear shouts and curses, but the initial impression is one of hard, cold, blank, silence; in other words the City is the appalling "Other." "Bartleby the Scrivener" makes this even more explicit. Subtitled, "A Story of Wall Street," the story takes place in great part in the office of the narrator, a lawyer, whose office at one end "looked upon the white wall of the interior of a spacious sky-light shaft, penetrating the build- ing from top to bottom."63 And Bartleby's desk looks out through a small 62 Pierre, ed.

Here sits the utterly isolated man, whose only comment is, "I prefer not to," and who subsequently makes his home in this tomb. At one of the climactic moments in the story the narrator visits Bartleby in his "home" on a Sunday morning, and once again there is the same unnatural silence, as in Pierre: "but his solitude, how horriblel Think of itl Of a Sunday, Wall Street is deserted as Petra; and every night of every day it is an emptiness. This building, too, which of weekdays hums with industry and life, at nightfall echoes with sheer vacancy, and all through Sunday is forlorn" (pp. 22-23). At the end Bartleby is taken to the Tombs, where he dies, but not before the silent-blankness, living-greenness antithesis is evoked once more: "The yard was entirely quiet. It was not accessible to the common prisoners. The surrounding walls, kept off all sounds behind them. The Egyptian character of the masonry weighed upon me with its gloom. But a soft imprisoned turf grew under foot. The heart of the eternal pyramids, it seemed, wherein, by some strange magic, through the clefts, grass-seed, dropped by birds, had sprung" (p. 45). The green grass, I take it, stands here for the kindness of the narrator, his solicitude for Bartleby, amid the "Descartian vortices" of the City, and for the closing benediction of the narrator: "Ah, Bartlebyl Ah, humanity!" (P. 47). The point with Melville is two-fold: that the City is so large that only one aspect, and that the most abstract, is really rendered;64 and, second, that the City is like a mirror giving back to the novelist yet another image of one of his most profound insights (and fears) into the nature of man, the natural world, and the final meaning of expe- rience. Dickens: The City as Visual Image I could not add anything much to what has already been said of Dickens' use of London as a symbol or as a complicated set of mean- ings by the many critics who have written about it, or touched on it, from Humphry House to Donald Fanger, Hillis Miller, and Steven Mar- cus. What I shall stress, cliche that it is, is how much the sights of London meant to his imagination. In solution, in the reportorial Sketches By Boz, can be seen the whole mighty pageant of his novels, the sights, the sounds, the talk, the very themes and characters. Sam Weller, Man- 64 This is the point, over-stated in my opinion, of David Weimer's The City as Metaphor (New York, 1966), that the City in fiction and poetry is never, or hardly ever, seen literally but is used as a vast metaphor.

The long-standing predi- lection for the old, the quaint, the ancient, the ubi sunt theme, perme- ates the book, as does the master drive to immortalize in print the dark old twisted by-ways of the huge City that obsessed his imagination but which he knew was, like everything else, at the mercy of time: A few years hence, and the antiquary of another generation looking into some mouldy record of the strife and passions that agitated the world in these times, may glance over the pages we have filled: and not all his knowledge of the history of the past, not all his black-letter lore, or his skill in book collecting, not all the dry studies of a long life, or the dusty volumes that have cost him a fortune, may help him to the whereabouts, either of Scotland-Yard, or any one of the landmarks we have mentioned in describing it.65 Indeed the conjunction of Dickens and London is unique, a non-repeat- able historical phenomenon whereby a writer of genius with an extraor- dinarily visual imagination appeared on the scene when the first of the giant cities was still graspable, at least in its parts, by an indefatigable pedestrian. Dickens may be said to have done for old London what Wordsworth did for the Lake Country landscape: he permanently fixed it in the human imagination, caught at a very special angle and in a very personal way, to be sure, but so powerfully wrought that for liter- ary people, at least, especially Americans, the physical scene itself, a century or more later, comes in on the retina through Dickensian spec- tacles. (Unfortunately he did not tell us how to look at the Hilton Hotel or the Post Office Tower.) But I will confine myself to one aspect of this: "Town and Todgers." A commonplace of Dickens criticism, from Taine and Bagehot on down, was that he could see the parts, but never the whole, all the details but never a pattern. For example, "Town and Todgers" is de- scribed in great detail as a crazy-quilt: no pattern, "devious mazes," no streets, a labyrinth, filled with churches and ghastly little churchyards; decayed mansions, gloomy court-yards; cellars, rats, queer old taverns. Todgers itself is ancient, twisted, decayed. The view from Todgers is similar: "Steeples, towers, belfries, shining vanes, and masts of ships: a very forest. Gables, house-tops, garret windows, wilderness upon wilderness. Smoke and noise enough for all the world at once."66 My point is the simple one that Dickens showed no pattern because there was none and that he had an extraordinarily acute sense of sight, and, evidently, quite a memory for detail and that what we are 65 "Our Parish," Sketches By Boz. 66 Martin Chuzzlewit, ch. ix. MARCH 1968 323</page><page sequence="35">John Henry Raleigh getting in his descriptions is a linear or temporal photograph of this section of London. Further, when a contemporary urban-planner looks at a city he sees just what Dickens saw: a chaos of details. Thus Kevin Lynch's The Image of the City sets itself to consider "the visual quality of the American city by studying the mental image of that city which is held by its citizens."67 Lynch's chief point is that these cities are not "legible": "a legible city would be one whose districts or landmarks or pathways are easily identifiable and are easily grouped into an overall pattern."68 Thus Dickens' novels are essays on the illegibility of London. Henry James: The City as Anthropomorphic "Being" A City has a character, no matter how large it may be. Certainly anyone living in or visiting London in the nineteenth century was super- conscious that he or she was immersed in an absolutely unique phe- nomenon of an unprecedented size, as a multitude of witnesses testify. Countess G. I. Hahn, a German friend of Monckton Milnes, said in a letter to a friend, "I expected to find a gigantic town and found a world. ... I spent five of the most tumultuous weeks of my life there, whirling like an atom through this universe of diamonds and mud."69 In 1855 in a review of John Timbs' Curiosities of London, Dickens said he knew London as well as any man and went on to describe "its stony streets, its heart of marble, and its entrails of brass."70 For Hardy London was the Wheel and the Beast, the Wheel being the roar of the day, the Beast being the night: "a monster whose body had four million heads and eight million eyes."71 About his stay of a week in London, which he called "Baal," Dostoevsky said: Everything is so huge and garish in its individuality. And this individuality can be deceptive. Each object of garishness, each contradiction lives alongside its antith- esis and obstinately walks hand and hand with it; they contradict each other. They all seem to defend themselves stubbornly, living in their own way and appar- ently not hurting each other. Yet simultaneously one finds even here the same relent- less, vague, chronic struggle between the individualistic basis of the whole Western world and the necessity of finding some way to live together.72 67 The Image of the City (Cambridge, Mass., 1960), p. 2. 6s Lynch, p. 3. See also Lynch's "The City as Environment," in Cities, pp. 192-202. The main faults of Cities, according to Lynch, are four: perceptual stress (noise, heat, con- fusion, pollution); lack of visible identity (lack of diversity); illegibility; and rigidity (lack of openness). This, of course, describes the nineteenth-century City. 69 James Pope-Hennessy, Monckton Milnes, 2 vols.

VICTORIAN STUDIES 324</page><page sequence="36">THE NOVEL AND THE CITY What these descriptions have in common is an emphasis on grandiosity coupled to a feeling that the megalopolis is so distinctive that it can only be accurately described by metaphor or personification. It is a living thing with a 'body" and a "character" of its own. "Paris," said Balzac, "is a living being" (quoted in Fanger, p. 26). By the late nine- teenth century this same kind of poetical hyperbole is being used about the now gigantic American cities. Thus Dreiser on Chicago: "This sing- ing flame of a city, this all-America, this poet in chaps and buckskin, this rude raw Titan, this Burns of a city!" (The Titan, ch. ii). But like Lon- don, of course, Chicago is also "heartless." The leading literary connoisseur of cities in the nineteenth cen- tury was Henry James. In both his travel sketches and in his novels he gives us, repeatedly, Rome, Paris, Venice, Florence, New York, Boston, and London, even Northampton, Massachusetts. Each has a distinctive "flavor" or "character" impressionistically evoked. But James's most abiding interest was London. Thus one of the most ambitious, fullest, most sensitive, and most convincing pictures of a large city in English or American fiction is in The Princess Cassimassima, which is James's most comprehensive treat- ment of, and tribute to London. Here the City operates on three levels: as a physical organism that encloses everything; as a shaper of, and con- stituent of, the human beings who inhabit it; and as a Ding Am Sich; a great Hindu idol with hundreds of arms and legs and eyes; breathing smoke with an everlasting hum or roar; powerful, pitiless, rich; full of pomp and full of misery; grand and sinful; at once the greatest failure and the greatest achievement of the human spirit. And, like history itself, it seems to have a force and a character of its own, independent of the centuries and the millions of human hands that built it and maintain it. In fact what History was to the imagination of Tolstoy, the City was to the imagination of James: the alpha and omega of the whole human enterprise. A full explication of the picture and function of the City in The Princess Cassimassima would constitute a paper in itself; but here I will confine myself to a brief example of each of the three aspects mentioned above. The Princess Cassimassima is filled with London places: Penton- ville, Soho, Hyde Park, Bloomsbury, the Strand, Belgrave Square, Lomax Place, Mayfair, Lisson Grove, Edgeware Road, East End, and so on. Moreover, the exact quality (on an esthetic-socio-economic scale) of these places is often suggested. For example, Madeira Crescent is "mean and meagre and fourth-rate" but it is "not squalid." It has to "the MARCH 1968 325</page><page sequence="37">John Henry Raleigh highest degree that parochial air."73 Hyacinth Robinson, the protago- nist, is a printer, who lives in Pentonville and works in Soho and takes his pleasures, such as they are, in and on the streets of London. Through him the reader partakes of the peripatetic life of the London working class: pubs, theatres, long summer evenings in Hyde Park; an excursion on the Thames to Greenwich; endless walking and talking: "nights of November and December, as he trod the greasy pavements that lay between Westminster and Paddington, groping his way through the baffled lamplight" (Bk. V, ch. xxxviii). The one great component of this life that is left out, and James would have been as incapable of drama- tizing it as his public would have been incapable of accepting it, is its bawdiness, raciness, and sexual mores. The word "bloody," for example, is never heard, and - the second great lack - the whole question of accents, so important in this world, is passed over: they all speak the equivalent of the King's English, with a few dropped 'h's" here and there. (And, of course, if James had tried his hand at real Cockney, the results would have been unbearable.) Several of the chief characters are what they are in great part because they are Londoners. Georg Simmel was one of the sociological pioneers in attempting to define the City in terms of the human types it produces, and Henry James, along with Dickens, may be regarded as his novelistic equivalent. Thus the vital, handsome Millicent Henning: She was to her blunt, expanded fingers a daughter of London, of the crowded streets and bristling traffic of the great city; she had drawn her health and strength from its dingy courts and foggy thoroughfares and peopled its parks and squares and crescents with her ambitions; it had entered into her blood and bone, the sound of her voice, the carriage of her head; she understood it by instinct and loved it with passion; she represented its immense vulgarities and curiosities, its brutality and its knowingness, its good-nature and its impudence, and might have figured, in an allegorical procession, as a kind of glorified Townswoman, a nymph of the Wilder- ness of Middlesex, a flower of the clustered parishes, the genius of urban civiliza- tion, the muse of Cockneyism." (Bk. I, ch. v) As Millicent embodies the vitality and indestructability of London, Hyacinth represents the fragility it produces in less vital, more sensitive souls: "There was something exotic in him, and yet, with his sharp young face, destitute of bloom, but not of sweetness and a certain conscious cockneyism that pervaded him, he was as strikingly as Millicent, in her own degree, a product of the London streets and the London air. He looked both ingenuous and slightly wasted, amused, amusing, and in- definably sad" (Bk. I, ch. v). 73 The Princess Cassimassima (New York, 1948), Bk. IV, ch. xxxiii. VICTORIAN STUDIES 326</page><page sequence="38">THE NOVEL AND THE CITY In the urban allegory of the novel the two women with whom Hyacinth is involved both represent cities: Millicent, of course, being London; and Christina Light, the Princess, being Paris, which Hyacinth once visits, finding it "tremendously artistic and decorative" (Bk. IV, ch. xxix). But there is a third "love-affair" going on between Hyacinth and London itself, which, it could be argued, is the most important component of his life: "He liked the reflexion of the lamps on the wet pavements, the feeling and smell of the carboniferous London damp; the way the winter fog blurred and suffused the whole place, produced halos and dim radiations, trickles and evaporations on the plates of glass" (Bk. I, ch. v). Not that London is romanticized, for sharp and extended pictures of its horrors punctuate the book: "the deep perpetual groan of London misery seemed to swell and swell and form the whole undertone of life" (Bk. II, ch. xxi); "The workhouse and the gutter, ignorance and cold, filth and tatters" (Bk. III, ch. xxviii); "the foul horrors of the worst dis- tricts of London, Pictures of indescribable shame and suffering" (Bk. IV, ch. xxxv). Above all, London's very grandiosity dwarfs or reduces to nothingness its human constituents; thus in the innermost or deepest strata of Hyacinth's consciousness is a sense of his own insignificance, "morbidly conscious" that the circle in which he lived was an "infini- tesimally small shallow eddy in the roaring vortex of London" (Bk. I, ch. ix). Nor are the various uglinesses of his life glossed over: "the ugli- ness of a dingy, belittered exterior, of battered dispapered walls"; ... "busy, pasty, sticky, leathery little world, where wages and beer were the main objects" (Bk. II, ch. xx). And it is his resentments against these things, as much as the impelling attractiveness of the Princess, that lead him into revolutionary politics. Still the overwhelming spell of London never ceases. Paris tem- porarily seduces him, and in its ambience London looks "vague and blurred, inarticulate, blunt and dim" (Bk. IV, ch. xxix). But as the book nears its climax, his first love, London, reasserts her force and power and spell with finality: "The influences of his permeating London had closed over him; Paris and Milan and Venice had shimmered away into reminiscence and picture; and as the great city which was most his own lay around him under her pall like an immeasurable breathing monster he felt with a vague excitement, as he had felt before, only now with more knowledge, that it was the richest expression of the life of man" (Bk. V, ch. xxxviii). And at the end, having been rejected or be- trayed by the Princess, it is to London that he turns: "Anyhow he went forth again into the streets, into the squares, into the parks, solicited by MARCH 1968 327</page><page sequence="39">John Henry Raleigh an aimless desire to steep himself yet once again in the great indifferent city he so knew and so loved and which had so many of his smiles and tears and confidences. The day was grey and damp, though no rain fell, and London had never appeared to him to wear more proudly and pub- licly the stamp of her imperial history" (Bk. VI, ch. xlvii). This, as it turns out, is his last walk on earth, for finding out in his walk that Millicent, the daughter of London, has also betrayed him, he returns to his lodgings and commits suicide. For the City finally is as indifferent to individuals as is history, but, unlike history, it has a char- acter, a personality - it is still, for all its size, anthropomorphic. The modern City sums up, incorporates and epitomizes all the problems - leaving out abstract thought - of mankind. That it is grand, grimy, terrible, indifferent, and infinitely seductive, and that it alters - widens, deepens, confuses, narrows- human consciousness is no less than the truth, and no less than the theme of The Princess Cassimassima. And that the destiny of mankind will be decided and played out in cities seems no less than the truth today, as James's instincts told him a century ago. But what we have in our imaginative literature is mostly a catalogue of its horrors. This is perhaps only fitting and just, since a humane instrument, in this case literature, must react seismographically to inhumanity, and if we ever were to try to forget the horrors of our cities, our literature would not let us, at no time more so than today. However, since the poor old City always takes such a beating in these discussions, I would like to conclude with a statement by one of the most eminent of City-Appreciators, Charles Abrams: A city, even an American city, is the pulsating product of the human hand and mind, reflecting man's history, his struggle for freedom, his creativity- and his selfishness and errors. It is the palimpsest on which man's story is written, the record of those who built a skyscraper or a picture window, fought a pitched battle for a play street, created a bookshop or bakeshop that mattered. It is a composite of trials and defeats, of settlement-houses, churches, and school houses, of aspirations, images and memories. A city has values as well as slums, excitement as well as conflict; it has a personality that has not yet been obliterated by its highways and gas stations; it has a spirit as well as a set of arteries and a voice that speaks the hopes as well as the disappointments of its people.74 University of California, Berkeley 74 Quoted in a profile of Abrams, who is Chairman of the Division of Urban Planning of Columbia University, New Yorker (11 Feb. 1967), pp. 45-46.
