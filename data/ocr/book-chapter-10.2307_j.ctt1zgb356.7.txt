Taçon, Melissa Marshall, Inés Domingo Sanz,  Faye Prideaux and Sean Paul Stephens Introduction The painted and beeswax rock art of Ingaanjalwurr rockshelter in western Arnhem Land  is a  unique  assemblage of art within an unassuming rockshelter. By combining a variety  of approaches and methods to the study of Ingaanjalwurr, we were able to draw together an  important archaeological context for inferring the antiquity of the painted rock art, as well as  direct dates for the age of beeswax art. This chapter provides an overview of the rock art at  Ingaanjalwurr, ethnographic information regarding the use and production of art at the site,  archaeological information relevant to understanding the antiquity and context of painted rock  art, and the results of direct dating of beeswax art. It has been argued that rock art on the northwestern Arnhem Land plateau provides evidence for  ‘outbursts of art production’ as opposed to ‘a steady, constant rate over time’ (Taçon 1993:113).  Taçon (1993) reached this conclusion by examining the chronology of different styles within his  study areas, and counting the number of images representing each style. He suggests that two of  the most significant such outbursts are represented by Dynamic Figure art and the later Freshwater,  Recent X-ray art (Taçon 1989, 1993), with relatively little rock art production between these two  periods (Taçon 1993:113). A similar conclusion is reached by Gunn et al. (2012:61) for Nawarla  Gabarnmang in Jawoyn Country, western Arnhem Land, arguing that a large quantity of rock  art was produced in that site within the past c. 350 years (see also Chapters 11 and 12; David et  al. 2011:76; Gunn et al. 2012:61). The Ingaanjalwurr site provided an opportunity to further  explore such ‘outbursts of art production’ for western Arnhem Land. Ingaanjalwurr rockshelter Ingaanjalwurr is a rockshelter located in Manilikarr Country, western Arnhem Land. It is  situated at the base of an escarpment that overlooks Red Lily Lagoon (Urrmarning) (Figure 3.1).  The escarpment runs broadly east–west, parallel to the main Jabiru-Gunbalanya (Oenpelli)  road, and reaches a maximum elevation of 75 m above sea level directly behind Ingaanjalwurr.  The rockshelter is c. 9 km southwest of Gunbalanya, with Ingaanjalwurr being the Urningangk  </page> <page sequence="2"> 52    The Archaeology of Rock Art in Western Arnhem Land, Australia name (original language of the Nayinggul family and Manilakarr clan) for the site provided by  senior Traditional Owner Nakodjok (who passed away in 2012; in respect of his family’s wishes,  we refer to him only by his skin name). Figure 3.1 Location of Ingaanjalwurr and other key sites mentioned in this chapter, in relation  to topography. Source: Map by Duncan Wright. The name Urrmarning derives from a purple lily (Nymphaeaceae spp.) that is common within  Red Lily Lagoon. It applies to a rockshelter (Urrmarning rockshelter), the lagoon and much of  the surrounding landscape (Figure 3.2). The English name Red Lily Lagoon is commonly used  today, and has been in use since c. 1900 when the buffalo hunter Paddy Cahill was working in  the area (Mulvaney 2004). The Red Lily vicinity also contains a rockshelter complex named  Minjnyimirnjdawabu, which was partially recorded as Inagurdurwil during the American- Australian Scientific Expedition to Arnhem Land (the ‘Mountford Expedition’) in 1948  (Mountford 1956). The rock art of both Minjnyimirnjdawabu and Urrmarning have been  partially recorded in more recent times by Robert Gunn (1992).  The Ingaanjalwurr site itself is 10.5 m wide, 3.5 m deep and has a maximum height of 1.6 m.  It is located under a c. 15 m wide sandstone boulder that possesses a wall inclined at an angle  of c. 45° on its northern side (Figure 3.3). A semi-circular ring of roof-fall surrounds the shelter  floor, providing some protection to the accumulated deposits and rock art. While no disturbance  of the floor deposits from feral animals or macropods is apparent, two dormant termite mounds  were observed at the dripline. A number of small trees are positioned at the northern limit of the  overhang. Surface deposits of charcoal, as well as the painted and beeswax art, indicated prior  human use of the rockshelter. The rock art and surface charcoal are concentrated in two locations  where rockfall seemed to have provided greatest head room. terra australis 47 </page> <page sequence="3"> 3.

Internationally recognised through UNESCO World  Heritage Listing for its rock art heritage, this region has one of Australia’s largest concentrations of  rock art sites (Chaloupka 1993; May and Taçon 2014:4235). The vast majority of rock art in this  region is painted or stencilled, with fewer engravings, prints and beeswax figures. Ingaanjalwurr has  a high density of beeswax art (45 examples) compared to the more typical painted art (76 examples). Beeswax rock art concerns the application of native Australian beeswax onto rock surfaces in  what Brandl (1968:19) describes as an ‘assumed deliberate design’. Such designs can be made  by forming pellets, strips and sheets from the prepared wax. The use of the word ‘beeswax’ for  this type of rock art is not as straightforward as it first appears. The ‘beeswax’ used for rock art is  a resinous compound. There are rare examples of rock art made from other resinous substances  including gabbai, made from the roots of the ironwood tree (Erythrophleum chlorostachys), and  another resin called kalapartaman found in central Arnhem Land (Chaloupka 1993:161; Taçon  and Garde 2000:71). Throughout this chapter, the term ‘beeswax’ (sugarbag wax such as that  found at Ingaanjalwurr) is used as a common name for the substance left when the honey has  been extracted from a clump of sugarbag (the nest-building material of the Australian native  stingless bee). The majority of beeswax art is found in northern Australia, specifically western  Arnhem Land and the Kimberley, with a few scattered examples in northern Queensland.  The first researcher to publish specifically on beeswax art was Brandl (1968). Brandl (1968:19– 29; 1973:177) recorded nearly 30 images from eight rock art sites in western Arnhem Land and  recognised the potential for directly radiocarbon dating beeswax art. Following Brandl’s work,  there was a break in detailed published research that lasted nearly 20 years and ended with the  commencement of the ‘Beeswax Art Project’ in the 1990s (Nelson 2000; Nelson et al. 2000;  Taçon and Garde 2000). Other researchers (e.g. Bednarik 2001; Chaloupka 1993:158–161;  Gunn and Whear 2008; Gunn et al. 2012; Morwood et al. 2010; Taçon et al. 2003, 2004, 2010;  Walsh 1988; Welch 1995) have used beeswax art to develop site chronologies and as part of  general rock art studies. Most beeswax art dates to within the past 1500 years (e.g. see Gunn and  Whear 2008; Morwood et al. 2010; Taçon and Garde 2000:74), although one example has been  dated to c. 4000 years ago (Nelson et al. 1995:152; Watchman and Jones 2002). Previous ethnographic research offers interpretations into the social role of beeswax art in  Arnhem Land. Brandl (1968:28) suggested that retouched beeswax art may have been indicative  of increased ritual use of a site. Other researchers have noted that single pellets or irregular lumps  of beeswax were stuck to rock for good luck when playing cards in central Arnhem Land and  as a tick removal procedure in western Arnhem Land (Chaloupka 1993:158; Taçon and Garde  2000:74). It has also been argued that by forming double rows of dots or depicting the Spirit- Being Narmarnde, it was possible to make a rockshelter habitable for the next season (Chaloupka  1993:158; Taçon and Garde 2000:74). Rock art recording took place at Ingaanjalwurr in 2006 (beeswax art) and again in 2011  (paintings), with the latter occurring at the same time as the archaeological excavations. Rock paintings A total of 76 painted images were identified at Ingaanjalwurr, a considerable number given the  small size of the rockshelter and relative exposure of the panels to direct sunlight and rain in the  wet season. Two clearly distinct groups of paintings were recorded – red images (including all  anthropomorphic figures, e.g. Figure 3.4) and white-infilled images usually with red outlining  (Figure 3.5). While often in poor states of conservation, and superimpositions at times partly  obscure underlying images, Table 3.1 presents a general list of motif shapes.  terra australis 47 </page> <page sequence="5"> 3.

Sorcery images are common  throughout the East Alligator River region  and elsewhere in Arnhem Land (Chaloupka  1993:207–211). On nearby Injalak Hill,  one sorcery painting was ethnographically  documented to have been produced to bring  pain to the depicted individual, and other  sorcery figures were painted to represent evil  spirits such as Namorrodoh (May 2006; Taylor  1996; W. Nawirridj, pers. comm. to Sally K.  May 2010). Another four of the human-like rock art figures  appear to have Yawk Yawk (female water spirit/ mermaid) tails instead of legs. Yawk Yawk is  the Kunwinjku language term used for young  women, but it is also used for special female  water spirits that have fish tails. Sometimes they  are described as mermaids that are said to live in  water in special places in western Arnhem Land.  They are considered minor regional spirits  (alongside Mimi, Namorrodoh and other types  of Spirit-Beings) that are still painted today by  artists in western Arnhem Land (May 2006; Figure 3.6 Digital tracings of photographed  Taylor 1996:88). beeswax images from Ingaanjalwurr  The painted art at Ingaanjalwurr is dominated (images are at different scales to each other).  by depictions of human figures and minor Darker colouring indicates greater thickness of surviving  Spirit-Beings that are still widely known today beeswax, with lighter areas signalling only staining  remaining on the rock surface. in western Arnhem Land.

On stylistic grounds,  painted images at Ingaanjalwurr correspond to  the later Estuarine Period and early Freshwater  Period, which are thought to date to the past  3000 years or so (Chaloupka 1993:153–189). terra australis 47 </page> <page sequence="7"> 3.

As can be seen in Figure 3.6, most (93 per cent)  of the beeswax images at Ingaanjalwurr consist  of applied dots. Only one image was created  using the strips of beeswax, and two images  (including a quadruped) were constructed by  applying sheets of beeswax. The beeswax images are mainly geometric  in design, with circular and row designs  being most common (Table 3.2). Of the  row designs, double rows and arched double  rows predominate (see Figure 3.6). Only  four figurative images were clearly identified:  a  barramundi (Figure 3.7), an unidentified  fish, an unidentified fish or turtle and  a horse or cow (Figure 3.8). The barramundi  is depicted with its head broken, said to  assist with carrying the fish back to camp  (Thompson Yulidjirri, pers. comm. to Sally  K. May 2005). This manner of depiction is  common in painted art of this region (Taçon Figure 3.7 Beeswax image of a fish, with  1989) (Figure 3.9).

Source: Photograph by Sally K. May. Figure 3.9 Painting of a fish with head broken to assist with carrying, Injalak Hill. Source: Photograph by Sally K. May. The quadruped is clearly a European-contact period figure, most likely depicting a horse. Rock  art produced during the contact period is widely documented for western Arnhem Land (e.g. see  Chaloupka 1979, 1993; Gunn et al. 2012; May et al. 2010; Taçon et al. 2010). The depiction  of horses is rare but not unique in this region. A remarkable example of a painted image of  a horse was recently documented at Nawarla Gabarnmang in Jawoyn Country (Gunn et al.  2012:60; Chapter 12), and may date from Leichhardt’s 1845 expedition across the region.  The Ingaanjalwurr depiction of a horse or cow in beeswax is unique, however, as no other such  depictions are known. Most of the beeswax art at Ingaanjalwurr is in a poor state of preservation, with pellets exfoliating  from the rockshelter walls. Despite the detachment of pellets from the wall, none were recovered  in the excavations. Many of the geometric images are badly deteriorated, with termite tracks  observed over several of the beeswax designs. Numerous images using dots have almost no  beeswax remaining and remain identifiable only as stains or ‘shadows’ on the rock surface.  This degradation made identification of several of the images difficult.  terra australis 47 </page> <page sequence="9"> 3.  The rock art of Ingaanjalwurr, western Arnhem Land, Australia    59  Direct radiocarbon dating of beeswax art To ascertain the antiquity of beeswax art, pellets from two images were collected for accelerator  mass spectrometry (AMS) radiocarbon dating: • Sample 1: A beeswax figure of a fish (Figures 3.7). This fish image is superimposed over a red  painting of a human-like figure and, as such, provides a minimum age for that painting.  • Sample 2: A single line of beeswax pellets (Figure 3.10). This beeswax linework is superimposed  over a red painted sorcery figure.  The resultant AMS dates on these beeswax pellets are both in good chronological agreement,  suggesting they were both made sometime within the period 8–275 cal BP, and most likely  sometime after 150 cal BP (Table 3.3). The similarity of the two radiocarbon dates for the two  beeswax images suggests that these two types of figurative and geometric forms are broadly  contemporaneous. The dating of the beeswax art also provides minimum ages for the paintings  that underlie them. At Ingaanjalwurr, beeswax images frequently overlie the painted art in  patterns of superimposition, but never the reverse.  Table 3.3 Radiocarbon dates from Ingaanjalwurr beeswax figures.

These were designed to provide information regarding the settlement history of the site  and to explore relationships between sub-surface archaeology and the various rock art traditions  evident on the rock walls (see Shine 2014 for detailed information on the excavation methods  and results). Square 1 was positioned within the rockshelter’s dripline in proximity to surface  charcoal, the main concentration of rock art and smoke staining on the ceiling. The square was  excavated in 34 excavation units (XUs) to a maximum depth of 68 cm below ground, although  rockfall significantly reduced the excavation area below XU2. Square 2 was excavated just outside  the dripline, c. 4.1 m northwest of Square 1 and beyond apparent surface rockfall. Square 2  was excavated in 40 XUs and reached a maximum depth of 88 cm, although here from XU6  down rockfall reduced the excavation area. Confined space forced the discontinuation of both  excavations without reaching culturally sterile deposits. The arbitrary XUs followed the observed strata during excavation. XUs averaged 2.0 cm in  thickness in Square 1 and 2.2 cm in Square 2. All excavated sediments were dry-sieved through  2.1 mm mesh on-site, and then archaeologically floated through 250 μm mesh at a dedicated  field facility at Gunbalanya. The resultant floated and sieved materials were air-dried before  being transported to Monash University (Clayton) for sorting and analysis. The provenance of  artefacts observed in situ and large fragments of charcoal were plotted in three dimensions and  individually bagged.  Both squares contained relatively homogenous brown sands, differentiated into three stratigraphic  units based on variations in compaction and inclusions (primarily charcoal). Sediments were  acidic, varying in pH from 3.0 to 3.4 in Square 1 and from 2.7 to 3.0 in Square 2. Minor  biogenic disturbance from insects and roots was recorded in both squares. Both squares exhibit good chronostratigraphic integrity (Table 3.4). In Square 1, the upper four  dates span the period c. 500 cal BP onwards; minor chronostratigraphic reversals are consistent  with the ‘old wood effect’. In general, in Square 1 the radiocarbon dates suggest relatively rapid  sediment accumulation from XU26 onwards, from c. 500 cal BP to very recent times. A basal  date from XU34 (Wk-33539) looks anomalously old (given the date from XU31) and potentially  represents older, residual charcoal within mixed ancient and more recent sediments associated  with the roof fall event. A broadly similar chronostratigraphic sequence occurs in Square 2, except  for a younger-than-anticipated date from XU33 (Wk-33534) that is interpreted as intrusive,  younger charcoal. Archaeological excavations recovered a total of 617 stone artefacts; worked (27.6 g) and  unworked (44.8 g) ochre, neither of which is natural to the site; three metal artefacts and one  glass artefact from Square 2. Large quantities of charcoal were collected as sieved macrocharcoal  pieces (&gt;2.1 mm: Square 1 = 1979 g; Square 2 = 1607 g), and also comprised the majority of  retrieved flotation organics (&gt;250 μm and &lt;2.1 mm: Square 1 = 2353 g; Square 2 = 5231 g).  The vast majority of both the macro and floated charcoal from Ingaanjalwurr is considered to  be associated with human occupation at the site, because peaks in macrocharcoal and flotation  correspond to peaks in stone artefacts. Ochre was recovered in both excavation squares: six pieces of unworked ochre (1.0 g) and two  pieces of worked ochre (8.3 g) in Square 1, and 25 pieces of unworked ochre (43.8 g) and 11  pieces of worked ochre (19.3 g) in Square 2. Even allowing for its greater depth and greater  amount of excavated sediment, Square 2 still contained significantly greater amounts of worked  terra australis 47 </page> <page sequence="11"> 3.

This pattern of peak ochre deposition occurring outside the dripline may suggest  spatial patterning of site use at Ingaanjalwurr.

The colour of ochre pieces recovered from the excavations is consistent with the rock paintings  at the site, consisting primarily of red, red-purple and red-yellow, with one unworked yellow  piece recovered from XU19 in Square 2. Although white pigment is absent from the excavated  assemblage, 18 per cent of paintings recorded at the site (N = 14 of 76 paintings) were either  white (N = 6) or contained white (N = 8). Colour differentiation in the excavated red ochres,  both worked and unworked, was in a comparable range as evident in the rock art, with 15 red,  15 red-purple and 13 red-yellow excavated pieces.  terra australis 47 </page> <page sequence="12"> 62    The Archaeology of Rock Art in Western Arnhem Land, Australia There is a clear concentration of ochre, especially worked ochre, in the upper levels of both  excavation squares. The uppermost 11 XUs of both squares contained all but two (85 per cent) of  the worked ochre pieces. Taken at face value, this distribution indicates a concentration of ochre  grinding after c. 300–460 cal BP, namely upward from XU11 in Square 1 and XU13 in Square 2.  However, such an interpretation does not take into account preservation biases, such as increased  rates of ochre disintegration with depth and through time. Archaeological evidence for an earlier phase of ochre use is limited to one stone covered with red  ochre, and a single piece of worked ochre, both from XU24 in Square 2. A radiocarbon date from  XU21 indicates that XU24 is older than 1295–1370 cal BP (Wk-31821). The decorated stone  (size: 32.9 × 21.8 × 7.4 mm; weight: 4.8 g) is a fragment of an originally larger piece, possibly  originating from the ceiling of the rockshelter. A major period of site use at this time is suggested  by elevated rates of stone artefact discard and charcoal deposition. In short, archaeological excavations at Ingaanjalwurr point to two primary periods of human  activity: (a) an earlier phase from c. 1900 to c. 1300 cal BP; and (b) a later phase commencing  c. 300–460 cal BP, which seemingly increases in intensity towards European contact. These two  key periods of occupation at Ingaanjalwurr are separated by low-intensity site use. Although  there is no guarantee that the excavated pieces of ochre relate to nearby on-wall paintings (see also  McNiven et al. 2009), the chronostratigraphic integrity of excavated deposits and the congruence  of peaks of worked ochre with those of stone artefacts suggest that the worked ochre is associated  with pulses of occupation. Ethnographic evidence for activities at Ingaanjalwurr Discussions with Nakodjok and other Traditional Owners took place during June 2011 concerning  past activities at Ingaanjalwurr. Over the past 100 years, the rockshelter has been used as a short- term camp by people walking between Gunbalanya, Mudginberri, Pine Creek and other smaller  settlements. Nakodjok was born in 1943 and recalled camping at the shelter in his youth ‘for a day  or two or maybe a week ... it was a good feeding ground for people those days ... looking for small  breams and mussels’ (Nakodjok, pers. comm. to Denis Shine 2011). Nakodjok stated that the  camp was used during the dry season when the floodplains were drying out and bream could be  easily caught with nets in retreating water pools around Ingaanjalwurr Creek. None of Nakodjok’s children remember camping at the site, suggesting that it had ceased to be  used as a camping place by the 1960s, but they had occasionally visited the area to hunt rock  wallaby (Petrogale spp.) since that time.

Namarnyilk (this senior Traditional Owner passed away in 2012; we refer to him by  a  shortened version of his name out of respect for his family’s wishes) and Don Namundja,  agreed that hunting was particularly rich around Ingaanjalwurr Creek. While not having specific  knowledge of the site, they referred to the broader Ingaanjalwurr vicinity as an area that was  regularly visited to hunt. Nakodjok was interested in the high density of beeswax art present at Ingaanjalwurr.  He understood that previous Traditional Owners of the area ‘would invite other people to come  and stay and that is why they did all those paintings’. He believed the density of beeswax art at  the site resulted from ‘somebody ... learning how to use the beeswax and paint’; ‘when he learnt  he’d do more better one ... somewhere else’ (Nakodjok, pers. comm. 2011). Nakodjok also  suggested that the concentration of beeswax art may simply reflect an availability of materials,  as ochre is not easily available on the adjacent floodplains: ‘because they had no colours you see  a lot of wax painting there is no black or white, red, yellow ochre, all just wax, well you know  they had plenty of wax to do the job’. terra australis 47 </page> <page sequence="13"> 3.  The rock art of Ingaanjalwurr, western Arnhem Land, Australia    63  Nakodjok believed the beeswax quadruped at Ingaanjalwurr depicts a horse. Horses were first  introduced at early British fortified settlements such as Port Essington (AD 1838–1849) (Powell  1996). The image could also post-date AD 1845, when Leichhardt visited the region on horseback;  or possibly dates to the early 1900s when these animals were first introduced in large numbers  by buffalo hunter Paddy Cahill (May 2006; May et al. 2010; Mulvaney 2004). Nakodjok had no  recollection of people making beeswax art when he camped at the site, indicating that beeswax  art was probably no longer being practised at Ingaanjalwurr in the mid-20th century. Discussion and conclusion We began this chapter by exploring the idea that in many rockshelters across western Arnhem  Land, rock art was produced during bursts of activity (Taçon 1993:113) rather than gradually  accumulating over prolonged periods of time as implied by Chaloupka’s (1993) notion of  ‘longest continuing art tradition’. Accordingly, rock art at Ingaanjalwurr and elsewhere, as  reported by Tacon (1993) and Gunn et al. (2012), was produced during relatively short periods  of time associated with intense periods of occupation. Comparisons with the published data  from Nawarla Gabarnmang to the south are of particular interest. Here Gunn et al. (2012:61)  argued that a large quantity of art was produced within the past c. 350 years, while associated  archaeological evidence suggests low-density occupation during the preceding 1000 years or so  (David et al. 2011:76; Gunn et al. 2012:61; see Chapters 11 and 12). At Ingaanjalwurr, we found  a period of beeswax art production dating to sometime after c. 275 cal BP, either commencing  in, or continuing into, the European-contact period (as indicated by the likely depiction of  a horse). This period of heightened artistic activity coincides with a peak period of occupation  commencing around c. 300–460 cal BP, as evidenced in the results of the archaeological  excavations. There is also evidence for an earlier phase of activity at the site (including the use  of red ochre) commencing within the calibration range 1726–1873 cal BP and continuing until  c. 1295–1370 cal BP. However, the vast majority of the excavated red ochre fragments date  to the later period of occupation, c. 300–460 cal BP. In short, the majority of surviving art at  Ingaanjalwurr appears to have been produced during a short burst of activity incorporating the  European-contact period.  If we accept that the past few hundred years witnessed increased human activity at the site,  along with the appearance of beeswax and painted sorcery figures, then we must also question  what cultural conventions inspired the making of such assemblages of art. Any such assessment  requires consideration of the site within the transformational social contexts of the past 500  years, i.e. the period preceding and including European contact.  For at least the past 350 years, Aboriginal people in the East Alligator River region were in regular  contact with Macassans (e.g. Macknight 1969, 1976, 1986; Taçon et al. 2010; Theden-Ringl  et al. 2011) and, later, European explorers, hunters, settlers, police, World War II personnel and  missionaries (i.e. Forrest 1985; Levitus 1995; Mulvaney 2004; Robinson 2005). Connections with  more recent European settlement are suggested by the geographic positioning of Ingaanjalwurr  rockshelter on an Aboriginal walking route linking Oenpelli with other settlements, such as  the cattle station and Aboriginal encampment at Mudginberri (Levitus 1982; Esther Manakgu,  pers. comm. to Sally K. May 2011). During the European-contact period, Aboriginal migration  to, and between, European settlements was known to have been extensive in the East Alligator  River region (Levitus 1995). Here, European contact resulted in a retraction of Aboriginal  movements across the landscape, to direct routes between historic settlements such as the  Oenpelli Mission (May et al. 2010). We suggest that Ingaanjalwurr was used intermittently,  perhaps opportunistically, as Aboriginal people journeyed between these emerging settlements.  terra australis 47 </page> <page sequence="14"> 64    The Archaeology of Rock Art in Western Arnhem Land, Australia The use of Ingaanjalwurr as a temporary camp on such journeys (as opposed to sustained  occupation) is also reflected in the archaeological record for the site, with its relatively small  number of artefacts but large volumes of charcoal and considerable number of rock art images,  including contact period rock art. Likewise, the ethnographic information provided by Nakodjok  specifically suggests that Ingaanjalwurr was a short-term camp for people moving along walking  routes between settlements and utilising areas known for particular food resources.  There is also an interesting link between the earlier painted art of Ingaanjalwurr and the European- contact period. An important feature of this painted rock art is the presence of sorcery figures.  Associations between rock art, sorcery and European illnesses across the region are well established  (e.g. Chaloupka 1993; Taçon 1993). For the East Alligator River region, Chaloupka suggests that  the majority of sorcery paintings date to the contact period and that they were probably a ‘direct  product of the stresses and sicknesses introduced by contact, such as the documented epidemics  of influenza, measles, and leprosy which affected perhaps the majority of the population in the  vicinity of Oenpelli’ (Chaloupka 1983:15). European diseases in the East Alligator River region, possibly deriving from contact with residents  of or visitors to early British fortified settlements (Allen 2008), were recorded as early as the mid- 19th century (McKinlay 1866). However, both the incidence and array of European diseases  increased massively following the foundation of Oenpelli and its development as an Anglican  Mission Station after 1925 (e.g. see Barker 1978:12; Mulvaney 2004:53–55).  As Oenpelli grew, it became the primary source of European disease in the East Alligator River  region (Taçon 1989:161–162) as well as, ironically, a place of pilgrimage and refuge for those  seeking treatment. Sorcery figures are common in this area and are generally considered to be  ‘recent’ in age, with none thought to be associated with art forms more than a few hundred years  old (Chaloupka 1983:15; Taçon 1989:161). The sorcery figures at Ingaanjalwurr are depicted with swollen/malformed joints. Taçon  (1989:161) has previously contended that swollen joints were painted by Aboriginal people to  document a symptom of Ross River fever, a type of mosquito-borne virus, which causes an  influenza-like illness and polyarthritis (causing swelling and stiffness of joints). While Ross River  fever was not officially named until the mid-20th century, Paddy Cahill documented serious  outbreaks of a similar illness, which he classified as influenza, in 1917 and the early 1920s.  The depiction of swollen joints on sorcery figures at Ingaanjalwurr, as at several other sites, could  record Aboriginal perceptions of the disease that was at that time understood to be influenza.  Alternatively, the disfigurement on these figures could relate to physical deformities caused by  other diseases, such as leprosy and smallpox, which were also common in the East Alligator  River region.  As noted above, some painted sorcery figures have been connected ethnographically to  Namorrodoh, a malevolent magic man who Aboriginal people in the East Alligator River region  associate with death and illness (e.g. Taçon 1989). Namorrodoh features heavily in Aboriginal  narratives of the East Alligator River region, and have been documented from the Manilikarr  and neighbouring Bunidj clans (see Shine et al. 2014). Among these clans, oral traditions  pertaining to Namorrodoh have been recorded for Canon Hill, as well as for Owurrngarndt  and Ubirr (e.g. Gunn 1992; Taçon 1989). Within the Manilikarr estate, Namorrodoh’s image  is depicted at Ubirr and Minjnyimirnjdawabu. Also located close to Minjnyimirnjdawabu, and  contained within Red Lily Lagoon (Urrmarning) is Kungk, an Aboriginal sickness site, which was  previously documented by Gunn (1992). Kungk, the Kunwinjku word for ‘gut’ or ‘waist’, is the  only recorded sickness site within the Manilikarr estate and is associated with severe diarrhoea  in local Aboriginal narratives (Gunn 1992:93). terra australis 47 </page> <page sequence="15"> 3.  The rock art of Ingaanjalwurr, western Arnhem Land, Australia    65  Ethnographic associations between beeswax art and sorcery, evil spirits and ritual activity have  also been documented (Taçon et al. 1997, 2003:8). As mentioned above, Brandl (1968:28)  suggested that some beeswax art could indicate increased ritual activity at a site. It has also been  argued that by forming double rows of beeswax dots, or depicting the evil and dangerous spirit  Narmarnde, it was possible to make a rockshelter habitable for the next season, presumably by  ridding the shelter of these spirits (Chaloupka 1993:158; Taçon and Garde 2000:74). While  this is, of course, just one level of interpretation, it does provide an interesting insight into the  cultural complexity of this art form. Beeswax art has also been associated with the containment of  deceased Ancestral spirits, the empowerment of body parts, and beliefs relating to the Rainbow  Serpent (Chaloupka 1993:158; Chaloupka and Alderson 2000:24; Taçon et al. 2000). Each of  these studies indicates that beeswax art can be imbued with a vital spiritual element, and that  beeswax art is recalled ethnographically as being related to death, sickness and/or sorcery. The concentration of sorcery figures at Ingaanjalwurr may be deliberate and part of a trend in the  East Alligator River region, whereby Aboriginal people recorded the impact of European illnesses  in both oral and visual (i.e. rock art) means. Thus we propose that much of the beeswax art and  the painted sorcery figures may detail Aboriginal perceptions of a traumatic period in western  Arnhem Land’s history, a time that saw new introduced illnesses spreading quickly. The art thus  arguably represents a form of social response to, and/or documentation of, a time of radical  societal change.
