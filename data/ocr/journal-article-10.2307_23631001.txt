<plain_text><page sequence="1">NEW GLYPTIC EVIDENCE IN RELATION TO SOME BIBLICAL CONCEPTS Othmar Keel University of Fribourg, Switzerland The following lines, dedicated to Amnon Ben-Tor in admiration of his archaeological work, present some new findings and a short discussion of their contribution to the religious history of Jerusalem and Israel in the second and first millennia bce, which I attempted to reconstruct in my 1,384-page work Die Geschichte Jerusalems und die Entste hung des Monotheismus Bull-worship Literally thousands of pages have been written about the places in the Hebrew Bible dealing with the cult of the bull in ancient Israel. The most important of these are: 1 Kg. 12:26-33, Hos. 8:5 and 10:5-6; Ex. 32; Dt. 9:13—21.2 These passages reveal that in the Northern Kingdom there was a cult of the bull, dedicated to YHWH, the "bull of Jacob" (Gen. 49:24; Ps. 132:2, 5; Is. 49:26, and 60:16), who led Israel out of Egypt. To be pre cise: no bull was ever worshipped as a god in the ancient Near East. It was only ever a symbol for a complex deity, which was also manifest in other phenomena, for example the thunderstorm or the moon. The perception of YHWH as a bull has sur vived as a metaphor: "God, who brings them out of Egypt, is like the horns of a wild bull for them'5 (Num. 23:22). The cult image, on the other hand, was rejected by the Yahwistic orthodox because of their increasing tendency to aniconism. In fact, the "golden calf' became the very paradigm of idolatry. Until recently, evidence of the bull cult was more intensively sought in the pages of the Bible than through archaeology and iconogra phy.3 T. Oman, in her contribution from 2001, insists on two masters of the bull, the moon-god and the weather-god. She overlooks YHWH, which is understandable, as there is no established YHWH iconography. In Jerusalem, if not else where, YHWH was apparently never represented anthropomorphically or theriomorphically (Keel 2001). The discovery of a small bronze bull at a high place north of Samaria, perhaps belonging to an early Israelite group, is taken as the main archaeological evidence for the cult of the bull in the Northern Kingdom.4 Further evidence of a bull cult can be found in a series of stamp seals bear ing images of bulls (with a god figure represented above), found mainly in the territory of the North em Kingdom, particularly in Samaria.5 A further, as yet unpublished, piece of evidence is kept in the storerooms of the Israel Antiquities Authority in the Rockefeller Museum, and has the inventory number 34.7665 (Fig. I).6 The index card gives the provenance as "Balata Exc. 1934 No. 3145." The item therefore comes from the final campaign of the Austro-German expedition led by Ernst Sellin in 1934. His excavation report, on which he worked until 1943, was destroyed during the war (Camp bell 1993: 1347). The item remained unpublished and the exact archaeological context is not known. The object takes the form of an almost circu lar plaque with rounded edges and a convex upper side. Seals from Ashdod, Bethel and Tell Beit Mirsim (Keel 1997: Aschdod Nr. 42; Keel 2010: Bet-El Nr. 2; Bet-Mirsim Nr. 105) have a similar form. The piece is very worn. The engraving is hollowed out and the individual elements of the image are no longer connected. The material is olive green, blackish and white-veined stone, probably serpentinite (Marino Maggetti on the 33*</page><page sequence="2">34* OTHMARK.EEL Fig. basis of a photo). Remains of a bronze ring are preserved in the perforation hole. The dimensions are 21.1x20.6x12.3 mm. The base shows a figure seated on an unclearly defined stool. The figure appears to be wearing an ankle-length garment. The Assyrian, or at least, Assyrianising coiffure is characterized by a beard and a knot of hair at the neck. The figure holds his hand in front of his nose, a gesture of reverence, which in Akkadian is called laban appiJ In front of the worshipper stands a bovine, probably a bull, which is walking away from him. Only three legs are visible. The tail is raised high above the back, the head with its horn facing forward is bent back towards the worshipper. In front of the bull's head is a hole whose function is unclear. Parallels to the bull and its particular attitude are found on an Assyrian stamp seal impression from Sultantepe in Northern Syria (Herbordt 1992: 253 and Taf. 16,13), on a round plaque, which was bought in Aleppo (Buchanan and Moorey 1988: p. 50 and pi. XI,328), and on a scarab from Achziv (Cowie 2004: 209 no. 32), although the tail on this one is not raised. In neither case is the bull represented alongside a seated worshipper. On the other hand, seated worshippers in a similar atti tude are found in front of a tree or branch e.g. on a clay relief on a pot of Phoenician origin found at En-Gedi (Fig. 2 = Stem 1978: 12-13 fig. 1) and on a similar tiny relief from Tell er-Rameh in the southern Jordan Valley (Ninow 2003: 193 Abb. Fig. 2 1-2). A series of scarabs from Cyprus and other objects from Phoenicia and Palestine also show a worshipper seated in front of a tree (Keel 1998: 44-46, figs. 87-96). The fact that the worshipper is seated probably means that he considers himself at home in the holy place or in the sanctuary, yashab means at the same time "to sit" and "to dwell." To sit/dwell in the sanctuary is a sign of confidence (cf. e.g. Ps. 23:6). Priests in particular dwell in the sanctuary (1 Sam. 3:3). The shape, style and iconography of the seal date it to the end of Iron Age IIB or Iron Age IIC (ca. 750-600 bce). How the seal came to Shechem is, of course, impossible to know. Thus, we can't be sure if it belonged to a travelling merchant or soldier, to one of the settlers brought by the king of Assyria to that region after the destruction of Samaria (2 Kg. 17:24-41), or if local people who remained in the country continued to worship YHWH in the form of a bull. The Two Functions of the Cherubim Since the rediscovery of the ancient Near East, it has become clear that cherubim are not angels in human form but hybrid creatures composed of a lion's body, a human head and vulture's wings. The idea that this combination signifies a superior being characterized by a human mind, leonine strength and vulture's speed has to be abandoned. According to the ancients, the heart was the center of thinking, not the head with its brain. These hybrid creatures were unearthly, dangerous and frightening (Keel 2007: 294-301). In the iconog raphy as well as in biblical texts they fulfill two functions, as guardians, particularly of the sacred tree (Gen. 3:24; Ezek. 41:18; Keel 2007: 311-313, figs. 199-203) and as a kind of throne seat (1 Kg. 6:23-28; 1 Kg. 19:15; Ps. 80:2; 99:1).</page><page sequence="3">NEW GLYPTIC EVIDENCE IN RELATION TO SOME BIBLICAL CONCEPTS 35" The cherubim throne is derived from the pha raoh's throne flanked by two lions (Keel 1977: 29-33). In Iron Age IB from about 1150-950 bce and Iron Age IIA (ca. 950-825 bce) the person seated on the cherubim is normally the king, living (Megiddo Ivory: Keel 2007: figs. Ill) or dead (Ahiram sarcophagus: ibid., fig. 175). This appears to apply to a scarab excavated by the Hazor expedition (Fig. 3) headed by Amnon Ben-Tor.8 The shape of this scarab is rough and it resembles a scaraboid from the side. The lunate head is separated from the rest by the two prono turn lines and a simple line indicates the elytra. Similarly schematic scarabs are Keel 2010: Bet Schean Nr. 70; Keel 2010a: Tell el-Far'a-Sud Nr. Fig. 3 367; Megiddo: Loud 1948, pi. 153:225. They are typical of the tenth and ninth centuries bce. The scarab from Hazor was found in area A4, locus 80018, a fill under a plaster floor dated to the early tenth century bce.9 The base is broken at one side. The engraving is hollowed out with some hatching. The material is a blackish stone, probably lime stone. The measurements are 16x12.2x8.3 mm. The base shows a human figure facing left. It wears an ankle-length cloth. The head has no features. The left hand rests on the knee, the right is raised in a gesture of greeting or blessing. The figure sits above a squatting cherub. It is probably supposed to be flanked by a second one, which together form a throne of cherubim. Above the right arm is a lotus blossom, behind the enthroned person a branch. Since the person has no divine attributes it is probably a king as depicted on the Megiddo ivory or the Ahiram sarcophagus. Bios som and branch probably indicate a garden. The cherubs function as a kind of bodyguard. Ezekiel says of the king of Tyre: "You were the signet of perfection ... in Eden, the garden of God ... with a cherub as guardian" (28:12-14). The description fits closely the iconography of the Hazor scarab.10 Another seal from Hazor has the shape of a hammer (Fig. 4)." Seals of this type are quite common in southeastern Anatolia and north ern Syria of the tenth-ninth century (Buchanan and Moorey 1988: 34f, nos. 250-255). They are, however, extremely rare in the southern Levant. A similar one was found on the Jordanian side of the Jordan Valley (Eggler and Keel 2006: Tall Abu Charaz, no. 2), a second one with a slightly differ ent shape at Tell Jemmeh in the southern coastal plain (Petrie 1928: pi. 20: 17 = Keel 1997: 784 fig. 9). A third one is a recently published surface find from Azekah (Gal 2009). The present seal from Hazor, found in the area of W.5199 "has unfor tunately no stratigraphic context, as it was found during restoration work in 2005."I2 The base of the seal is damaged and partly broken. The engrav ing is hollowed out and hatched. The material is a creamy-white stone, probably limestone. The mea surements are 21x18.5x17 mm. The base shows a cherub. Its position, because of the break, is not entirely clear. Most probably it was portrayed walking. In front of it is a tree or branch, above its wing a palm-like tree, and above the back a flower. The cherub thus seems to be represented as guardian of a place characterized by trees and flowers, a kind of paradise. It seems to have a similar function to the cherubim in Gen. 3:24. Only at the end of the Iron Age IIB and particu larly in Iron Age IIC do we have clear examples of deities sitting on or between cherubim (Keel 2007: 299-301 with figs. 184-186; Avigad and Sass 1997: no. 736). Before that period only a simple empty throne or chair symbolized most probably the pres ence of YHWH in the Holy of Holies beside the ark. Originally the empty seat was the symbol of</page><page sequence="4">36* OTHMARKEEL Fig. 4 the Jerusalem sun-god (Keel 2007: 302-304 with figs. 188-190) with whom YHWH later merged and was identified. One of the almost 200 bullae and fragments of bullae from the end of the ninth cen tury bce discovered by R. Reich and E. Shukron beside the Gihon Spring shows an empty throne with a high back with a winged sun disc above (Fig. 5; Keel 2007: 304, fig. 191 ).13 The winged sun disc is fixed on a pole. The throne rests on a curved element which evokes the Egyptian sun boat, represented several times in contemporary glyptic (Keel 1994: 76-78, 126, figs. 14-16, Tafel 14:15-16). Part of the motifs found on Reich and Shukron's bullae are clearly locally made and not found elsewhere (Keel 2007: 359, figs. 256-259). Mineralogical investigations have confirmed that the clay from which many of these bullae were made was local. As far as I can see, the motif of Fig. 5 has no exact parallels elsewhere, though the winged sun disc above an empty chair was, tfsk B-S Fig. 5 as mentioned, well known at this time. The chairs are, however, not thrones with a high back and the winged sun disc is not fixed at the top of a pole. It is very possible that Fig. 5 represents the cult symbol of the Jerusalem temple before the eighth or seventh centuries when the simple throne was replaced by a throne formed by two cherubim. YHWH as a God of the Baal-Seth Type In the history of religion the god of Israel already mentioned in the Mesha Stela was often considered as a kind of Levantine weather god. As early as 1862 the Dutch scholar W. Pleyte in his book La religion des pre-lsraelites. Recherches sur le dieu Seth (Utrecht) related YHWH to the Egyptian Seth. The book received almost no attention. Some 70 years later all eyes turned to the texts from Ugarit where the weather god Baal is one of the main actors. In contrast to the north Syrian weather god, YHWH was, however, at the beginning not related to fertility but rather to storm, volcanic eruption, earthquake, and war. In the 19th Dynasty at the latest, the southern Levant had identified the Canaanite Baal with the Egyptian god Seth. This intercultural ligature puts the accent on war and fighting and is much closer to the early biblical YHWH than the Canaanite lord of the fertile land (Keel 2009). Two recent finds confirm that this type of deity was not unknown in Jerusalem in the tenth and ninth centuries bce. Among the finds recently made by E. Mazar in her excavation in the City of David she discovered a typical mass-produced Post-Ramesside scarab14 showing the winged Baal Seth standing on a lion. The motif is well known (cf. Cornelius 1994: 197-200 nos. BM45-55, pi. 48, BM45-55). A hitherto unpublished scarab of this type is kept at the Bible+Orient Museum in Fribourg (Fig. 6).15 Eilat Mazar's scarab was found in a locus that is a Persian period layer directly under the (Hasmonean) Northern Tower. It may be that material from the palace's early floor's fill was cleaned and removed but it was not shown in the pottery assemblage.16 Among the seals and bullae found by R. Reich and E. Shukron mentioned above are also a few seals. One scarab shows the figure of Baal-Seth (Fig. 7; Keel 2007: 207, fig. 126). The rather rough</page><page sequence="5">NEW GLYPTIC EVIDENCE IN RELATION TO SOME BIBLICAL CONCEPTS 37s I-**2 fym !**י- - י 18* L. m ! '■'" / r *frv Fig. 6 scarab has a lunate head. Pronotum and elytra are indicated by simple lines. The humeral callosities are rendered by two V-shaped marks. These are very uncommon on typical post-Ramessid mass produced scarabs and the object was probably produced a little bit earlier than these, at the end of the Ramessid period in the twelfth or early elev enth centuries. The engraving is hollowed out. The material is the typical baked steatite. The measure ments are 12.3x8.5x5.6 mm. The base shows an anthropomorphic figure with the strange head of the Seth-animal with its typi cal long ears. Instead of arms the figure has out stretched wings, an attribute of a storm deity (cf. Psalm 18:11; 104:3).17 The god is flanked by two Fig. 7 uraei, the biblical Seraphim, and his head is flanked by two sun discs. A sun disc also accompanies the Baal-Seth of Fig. 6. In the Ramesside period the figure of Seth is often accompanied by the epithet "loved by the sun god (Re)" (Keel 2009: 90-102, figs. 1-15, particularly figs. 11-12). The reason for this love is the fact that Seth fights the Apophis snake, which threatens the sun during its nightly course through the underworld. Two scarabs do not constitute overwhelming evidence. But considering the small number of scarabs from this period (eleventh-ninth centu ries bce) from Jerusalem, the two scarabs are quite remarkable.
