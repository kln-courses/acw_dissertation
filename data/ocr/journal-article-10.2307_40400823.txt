<plain_text><page sequence="1">MISADVENTURE OF IDEAS: A STUDY OF WHITEHEAD'S PHILOSOPHY H. FRANKEL life work of Alfred North Whitehead is easily divisible into three periods. He was first a mathematician with more than a slight interest in logic. As early as 1898 he produced the first (and only) part of A Treatise on Universal Alge- bra, which aimed "to erect a calculus to facilitate reasoning in con- nection with every province of thought, or of external experience, in which the succession of thoughts, or of events, can be definitely ascertained and precisely stated."1 To erect such a universal cal- culus was evidently too much for one man. Fortunately, in 1903, Bertrand Russell's Principles of Mathematics appeared and, dis- covering they were working along identical lines, they joined forces to produce the monumental Principia Mathematica. The publication in 1915 of Einstein's General Theory of Rela- tivity stimulated the best scientific and philosophical brains to in- vestigate its implications. One of the first to see serious objections to Einstein's theory was Whitehead and, in The Concept of Nature, An Enquiry Concerning the Principles of Natural Knowledge, and The Principle of Relativity, published between the years 1919-22, he formulated an alternative thesis. These are the core of his second period, in which he attempted to produce a theory of physical nature -"pan-physics," as he called it. Finally in 1925 he moved into his third period with the publica- tion of Science and the Modern World, in which were presented the principles of his philosophy of organism. It was of this book that Herbert Read wrote: "This is perhaps the most important book published in the conjoint realms of science and philosophy since Descartes' Discourse on Method. . . ." i A Treatise on Universal Algebra (Cambridge, 1898), p. viii. loa</page><page sequence="2">154 SCIENCE AND SOCIETY These three periods- logicomathematical, "pan-physical" and philosophical, are linked together. Indeed the last is in a way the synthesis of the first two, plus a strong metaphysical ingredient which lifts them on to a different plane. The Nature of Whitehead's Natural Philosophy I. The Aim In his three "pan-physical" books Whitehead adopted a stand- point common among scientists and contemporary philosophers, namely, of rejection of "metaphysics." "We are concerned," he de- clared, "only with Nature, that is with the object of perceptual knowledge, and not with the synthesis of the knower with the known [i.e., the relation of thinking to being- H.F.]. This distinction is exactly that which separates natural philosophy from metaphysics. Accordingly none of our perplexities as to Nature will be solved by having recourse to the consideration that there is a mind knowing it. Our theme is the coherence of the known, and the perplexity which we are unravelling is as to what it is that is known."2 He rejected the escape of the idealists, Berkeley and Leibnitz. "The primary task of a philosophy of natural science is to elucidate the concept of nature. . . ."3 And in his last "pan-physical" work he was even more definite as to the subject-matter of philosophy. "It is well to understand the limitations to the meaning of 'philoso- phy' in this connection," he wrote. "It has nothing to do with ethics or theology or the theory of aesthetics. It is solely engaged in de- termining the most general conceptions which apply to things ob- served by the senses."4 "Things observed by the senses" clearly implies that things ob- served must lie outside the senses. It would appear, then, that Whitehead was drawn towards materialism, towards the belief that the world exists outside of any mind observing or perceiving it. And indeed he says so, although not daring to adhere openly to mate- rialism. "Nature can be thought of as a closed system whose mutual 2 An Enquiry Concerning the Principles of Natural Knowledge, Preface. 3 The Concept of Nature (Cambridge, 1920), p. 46. 4 The Principle of Relativity, "Preparatory Explanations."</page><page sequence="3">whitehead's philosophy 155 relations do not require the expression of the fact that they are thought about. Thus in a sense nature is independent of thought. By this statement no metaphysical pronouncement is intended."5 Thus in this period he adopted a standpoint, without using the word, nearest to materialism, rejecting decisively a reliance upon God or "mind" to overcome the fundamental question of the rela- tion between thinking and being. As to whether cognition of the real world was possible Whitehead appeared again to come down on the materialist side. The aim of natural philosophy was, he wrote, "to analyze how these various perceived elements of nature are connected,"6 implying, therefore, the possibility of such analysis. But it was precisely the effort to achieve this on the basis of New- tonian physics that received such devastating criticism from Berke- ley. Newtonianism, through the philosophy of Locke, asserted that the sizes, shapes, colors, etc., perceived by the senses came from ob- jects external to us. But, said Berkeley, if all our knowledge of objects is in the mind, how can one say the objects existed outside the mind and hence all objects outside the divine mind? Further, according to the Newtonian doctrine, matter was senseless: how then, could senseless matter give rise to sense-impressions? Berke- ley's solution was to identify the object with the sensations and im- plant both in "spirit." What, then, becomes of the laws of nature? Berkeley claims they were merely "the set rules, or established meth- ods, wherein the mind we depend on excites in us the ideas of sense."7 Naturally, Berkeley's "solution" could hardly satisfy Whitehead: in the end, he remarks, it develops into solipsism-one is left alone in the world of one's imaginings. On the other hand, Newtonian- ism, further complicated by subsequent centuries of scientific dis- coveries, must split the world into more sectors still more difficult to unify. For example, suppose we are sitting in front of a fire. We see redness and feel warmth; but both are somehow produced by the motions of atoms and molecules within the fire. The great prob- lem, said Whitehead, was how to put redness and warmth on the 5 The Concept of Nature, p. 3. 6 Ibid., p. 29. 7 Berkeley, A Treatise Concerning the Principles of Human Knowledge, sec. XXX.</page><page sequence="4">156 SCIENCE AND SOCIETY one hand, atoms and molecules on the other, and all the inter- mediate stages (of radiant energy and bodily functions) into one sys- tem of relations. For, "Unless we produce the all-embracing rela- tions, we are faced with a bifurcated nature; namely, warmth and redness on one side, and molecules, electrons and ether on the other side."8 Therefore it was clear that, in contradistinction to Newton's "sense-less" pieces of matter, the fundamental units or "ultimate facts" of nature must be capable of producing redness as well as atoms, warmth as well as molecules; or else we must relapse into bi- furcation and the inevitable Berkeleyan "solution." II. The Outcome "The ultimate facts of nature/' Whitehead declared, ". . . are events connected by their spatio-temporal relations, . . ."9 Events are the "happenings" in nature. "An actual event is thus divested of all possibility. It is what does become in nature. It can never happen again; for essentially it is just itself, there and then."10 Space-time is infinitely divisible and its divisions Whitehead called "durations." Now, while a duration could extend in time to a million years or be as brief as a millionth of a second, spatially it was co-extensive with the whole universe. As Whitehead said: "A duration is a cross-section of the universe; it is the immediate present condition of the world at some epoch. . . ."n Hence every duration is dissectable into events. The birth of a star, a flash of lightning, a walk as well as each step in that walk, are all events. And the spatio-temporal relations connecting them "... are in the main reducible to the property of events that they contain (or ex- tend over) other events which are part of them."12 It is this over- lapping of events that gives Nature its seeming continuity. Thus the "event-nail" of one of my fingers, Whitehead says, is a part of 8 The Concept of Nature, p. 32. 9 An Enquiry Concerning the Principles of Natural Knowledge, p. 4, my italics. 10 Ibid., p. 61. 11 Process and Reality, p. 175. 12 An Enquiry Concerning the Principles of Natural Knowledge, loc, cit.</page><page sequence="5">whitehead's philosophy 157 the whole event that is "I" and the event "I" is a whole extend- ing over innumerable parts which are the events of my life-history. It would seem, therefore, as though one should be able to per- ceive and delimit events; for example, that "I" was born at a certain time and shall die at a certain time. Unfortunately, this is not so, says Whitehead, because it is impossible to say, "At this instant I was born": we find that this "instant" extends over a certain dura- tion, which by definition comprises in turn a number of events of lesser duration, and so on ad infinitum. Therefore we cannot, in fact, perceive events. "The definition of an event by assignment of demarcations is an arbitrary act of thought corresponding to no perceptual experience." They have the suspicious character, he confesses with some dismay, "that we are driven to accept them by abstract logic and not by observed fact."13 A further obstacle to accepting Whitehead's events as the "ulti- mate facts" of nature lies in the notion of infinite divisibility. White- head compares the containment of events in other events to the Chinese nest of boxes, where each contains one smaller than itself. But infinite divisibility must lead to a vanishing; and Whitehead therefore suggests that this, which he calls the Method of Extensive Abstraction, is like the differential calculus. But, as Wells, one of the most important critics of Whitehead, says: "In the latter, divisi- bility leads to a qualitative change through quantitative change- that is, through the procedure something determinate is arrived at in the sense that the arrow has arrived at its target. But in White- head's method, the terminus of division or abstraction is an ideal limit, an unextended point or division or instant at which all con- tent is lost."14 The only way to prevent this vanishing away must be by putting a stop to the divisibility or abstraction at a stage where and when we can perceive whatever is perceived. That this is crucial to the whole of Whitehead's philosophy we shall now see. If, then, we do not perceive events, what do we perceive? White- head answers, objects. We apprehend events, he says; we recog- ió The Concept of Nature, p. 22. 14 Harry K. Wells, Process and Unreality (New York, 1950), p. 32.</page><page sequence="6">158 SCIENCE AND SOCIETY nize objects. Objects, the "recognita" amid events, are those entities possessing a degree of permanence. "The self-identical object main- tains itself amid the flux of events/'15 The unchanging cliff, the woolen sock through all its darns and Cleopatra's Needle are all objects. But the unchanging cliff originated at some time and will, at some future date, vanish; the woolen sock wears thin and even Cleopatra's Needle will crumble away. Objects, then, cries White- head, are vague and their unity delusive; they cannot be regarded as primary; they are not the causes but the results of perception. They are as much abstractions from nature as events. The distinction between events and objects, too, is vague and unsatisfactory. Consider a flash of lightning, say. In "happening" in nature, it is an event. But it is also perceived therefore it must be an object. How can the object be distinguished from the event? Whitehead argues that the event was the "seat" or "situation" of the object. Further, he confesses himself unable to answer the question: If we perceive only objects, how do we know about events? Clearly, "objects" are created by the perceiving mind, i.e., they are just as much as "events," mental constructs. The process of perceiving objects out of the flux of events (which, according to Whitehead, is nature) is a selective process of the mind. But we are then faced with the great question, how does this selective pro- cess (putting a stop to abstraction) take place, and according to what laws? Aware of the artificiality of his scheme, yet without trying to answer the great question, Whitehead attempted to improve his posi- tion by analyzing types of objects and so to derive from a considera- tion of them some unifying principle. Whitehead discerned three such types: scientific objects, sense objects and perceptual objects. Of these, scientific objects, e.g., atoms and electrons, are least in space-time, and almost coincide with events of the same degree. Sense objects are the data that enter our minds through the senses, for example, a patch of red, a hard surface or a musical chord. Perceptual objects, finally, are the ordi- nary objects of common experience- chairs, stones, trees. If "non- delusive" they are called physical objects. The events, says Whitehead, are the "seat" or "situation" of 15 An Enquiry, etc., p. 63.</page><page sequence="7">whitehead's philosophy 159 the object with which they are associated. "According to scientific theory and to common-sense the event which is the situation of a physical object is the chief conditioning event for the appearance of that physical object." Evidently he considers the event or events to be the cause of the object and not the other way about. But since, by definition, events overlap and contain one an- other, the events which are the "situation" of the associated object are a limiting set. This limiting set Whitehead calls the "intrinsic character" of the object. It follows that the source of limitation (of extensive abstraction) lies within the object itself and not with the events. As he says: "An object is an ingredient in the character of some event. In fact the character of an event is nothing but the objects which are ingredient in it and the ways in which those ob- jects make their ingression into the event."16 In other words, the object determines all. Thus Whitehead contradicts himself. Events cannot be the fundamental units of nature. As for objects, the problem facing Whitehead was, if they are the fundamental units, how to unite the three types. This he essayed when he postulated a further type of "object," a "multiple relation between objects situated in various parts of the whole event. . . . Such an object is a pattern."17 But this merely added another concept to his list without approaching any nearer a satis- factory solution of the problem of connecting the "elements of na- ture" or producing the "all-embracing relations." The existence of life complicated his analysis further. "The in- dividual life is/' he wrote, "beyond the mere object. . . . The specific recognizable liveliness is the recognized character of the relation of the object to the event which is its situation."18 In other words, life is neither object nor event but the relation between them; and it follows that entities other than objects and events may be the "ulti- mate facts of nature." He recognized that his three types of objects were by no means the only types. "There are, I think, an indefinite 16 The Concept of Nature, p. 143, my italics. 17 An Enquiry, p. 195. 18 Ibid., p. 196.</page><page sequence="8">160 SCIENCE AND SOCIETY number of types of objects. Happily we need not think of them all."» "I agree that the view of Nature which I have maintained in these lectures is not a simple one/' he concluded. "Nature appears as a complex system whose factors are dimly discerned by us. But, as I ask you, Is not this the very truth? Should we not distrust the jaunty assurance with which every age prides itself that it at least has hit upon the ultimate concepts in which all that happens can be formulated? . . . The guiding motto in the life of every natural philosopher should be, Seek simplicity and distrust it."20 Recapitulation Our examination of Whitehead's "pan-physics" began with a reference to the struggle between idealism and materialism, with ag- nosticism trying to steer an impossible, middle course. Whitehead rejected the idealist refuge and tended, on the whole, towards ma- terialism. The true aim of natural philosophy, he believed, was to analyze how the elements of nature were connected. Before putting forward his own views he launched a massive attack upon Newton- ian mechanical materialism, which had split nature into bits of quality-less matter on the one hand and subjective qualities (sights, sounds, emotions, etc.) on the other. In his view the ultimate elements of nature were events. But the things perceived were objects. Our examination, however, has disclosed that Whitehead's events are mental constructs, the exist- ence of which cannot be verified. Further, it appears that the "ob- jects" determine the events and not the other way about. But the "objects" as possible elements of nature elude unification into the whole that is nature. In the end Whitehead admits that his efforts at analysis have failed. The questions we must now ask ourselves and try to answer are, Where did Whitehead go wrong and why? ///. The Dilemma In an important passage in Socialism: Utopian and Scientific, 19 The Concept of Nature, p. 149. 20 Ibid., p. 163.</page><page sequence="9">whitehead's philosophy 161 Engels explains how in ancient times certain Greek philosophers, in particular Heraclitus, pictured nature and human activity as ". . . an endless maze of relations and interactions in which nothing remains what, where and as it was, but everything moves, changes, comes into being and passes out of existence/'21 Such a picture concentrated more on the movement and transition and less on the details. "It was the fruit in the intellectual field of a reasonably happy society which had launched a vigorous attack upon nature and had the picture in its mind of man as an ingenious and resourceful creature capable of indefinitely improving his conditions of life/'22 Of course, the attack upon nature was at an elementary level. Subse- quently, there was a metaphysical trend. The fundamental characteristics of metaphysics are that it con- siders things, images and ideas in their isolation, as fixed and immu- table objects, which either exist or do not exist; and that opposites such as negative and positive, cause and effect, free will and deter- minism absolutely exclude one another. But when metaphysics ventures into the field of scientific re- search the results are, to say the least, extraordinary. Examples of this are extremely numerous, and we may cite Whitehead's own discussion of "objects" as illustration. It will be remembered that he realized that in time all objects change and will pass away, even cliffs and Cleopatra's Needle. And through wear and darning a woolen sock, while still recognizable as the sock, yet changes into what it was not. Thus the idea of eternally fixed "objects" is self- contradictory. The overcoming of metaphysics and the recovery of the Hera- clitean mode of thought, but with centuries of great scientific and historical advance to expand it, is the essence of modern dialectics, which "... grasps things and their images, ideas, essentially in their interconnection, in their sequence, their movement, their birth and death l&gt;23 Nature and human thought go through real historical evolution. 21 F. Engels, Socialism, Utopian and Scientific, in Marx, Selected Works, Vol. I (Lon- don, 1935), p. 156. 22 Benjamin Farrington, Greek Science (London, 1953), p. 149- 23 Engels, op. cit., p. 159.</page><page sequence="10">162 SCIENCE AND SOCIETY Endless examples of this advance exist and, for illustrative pur- poses, some may be cited. Engels himself instanced the case that, while for everyday purposes it is simple to say whether an animal is dead or alive, physiologists had long ago discovered that dying was a lengthy process which could not, except for everyday purposes, be established as occurring at any exact point in time. On the issue as to whether something is living or non-living a similar difference is now acknowledged, including examples of substances that are alternately the one and the other according to different circum- stances. The nature of any piece of matter is not something inde- pendent of its environment but radically depends on temperature, pressure and other conditions. Even the most generalized relation- ships, space, time and motion, it is now universally agreed, cannot be regarded in isolation but only as related to the circumstances in which they are considered. At this stage the non-Marxist asks whether there are not certain absolutes even in materialist dialectics. The answer is that there is one, which Lenin described as follows: The only immutability is the reflection by the human mind (when there is a human mind) of an external world existing and developing independently of the mind. No other 'immutability/ no other 'essence/ no other 'absolute substance/ in the sense in which these concepts were depicted by the empty professorial philosophy, exist for Marx and Engels. The 'essence' of things, or 'substance/ is also relative; it ex- presses only the degree of profundity of man's knowledge of objects; and while yesterday the profundity of this knowledge did not go beyond the atom, and today does not go beyond the electron and ether, dia- lectical materialism insists on the temporary, relative, approximate char- acter of all these milestones in the knowledge of nature gained by the progressing science of man. The electron is as inexhaustible as the atom, nature is infinite, but it infinitely exists. And it is this sole unconditional recognition of nature's existence outside the mind and perceptions of man that distinguishes dialectical materialism from rela- tivist agnosticism and idealism.24 From this passage it will be seen that both similarities and dif- 24 Lenin, Materialism and Empirio-Criticism (1908), ch. 5, sec. 2.</page><page sequence="11">whitehead's philosophy 163 ferences exist between Marxism and Whitehead's pan-physical phi- losophy. The similarities are: (1) Whitehead appeared on the whole to agree that nature ex- ists independent of any mind. (2) He realized also- eventually- that nature is infinitely com- plex; indeed when he wrote that ". . . the structure of the natural complex can never be exhausted in thought, just as the factors of fact can never be exhausted in sense-aware- ness. Unexhaustiveness is an essential character of our knowledge of nature,"25 he was almost paraphrasing Lenin. However, the differences are more profound than the agreements. These differences are: (1) Although he realized that other scientific objects would displace protons and electrons from their position as basic units, Whitehead did not adhere to the standpoint of "the temporary relative, approximate character of all these mile- stones in the knowledge of nature/' and set up as new, fixed and immutable units his "events" (and "objects"). There- fore, he contradicted his own statement of the inexhausti- bility of the "natural complex." Events are logical con- structs; i.e., they exist only in the mind. (2) For Whitehead, too, in opposition to dialectics, a thing either exists or it does not exist. The fact that his efforts to separate the various entities into distinct compartments, which he could then bring together into a whole, ended in failure, shows some fault in this assumption- for assump- tion it is. Indeed his elaboration of the doctrine of events and objects contradicts it. An event is not only what it is, but is determined by all which it is not, namely, the rest of nature and specifically (spatially) by the rest of its "dura- tion." Even more clearly self-contradictory is the "object," which is and is at the same time moving to non-existence, as for example, the woolen sock. Thus the maintenance of this classical, metaphysical precept of mechanical ma- 25 The Concept of Nature, p. 14.</page><page sequence="12">164 SCIENCE AND SOCIETY terialism directly contradicted his own deepest observations. It was an unconsciously assumed, never-questioned absolute. Whitehead's pan-physics, in short, amounts to a different form of the very (metaphysical) mechanical materialism he aimed to re- but and replace. For "self -enduring, identical bits of matter" he substituted non-contradictory, self-identical "events" and non-con- tradictory, self-identical "objects." The activity and process of na- ture occur only in respect of the passage of these units, not vice versa; and he is left in the end still searching for that which binds the entities together. Now, therefore, he must either abandon the very notion of fixed entities and return to true materialism (nature external to mind and inexhaustible); or, adhering to "metaphysics," either refuse to pursue the problem (i.e., be agnostic) or seek an answer in something outside of the entities themselves- if that is possible. It is, we contend, not entirely accidental that he took his next step just after being appointed to the Chair of Philosophy at Har- vard. It appeared first in Science and the Modern World (1925) and came to full fruition in Process and Reality (1929). The Philosophy of Organism I. What Whitehead Meant by Speculative Philosophy Whitehead opened Process and Reality with a declaration of aims: this was "... the endeavor to frame a coherent, logical, neces- sary system of general ideas in terms of which every element of our experience can be interpreted. . . ."26 This laudable endeavor he called "speculative philosophy." At the same time, true to his final pan-physical scepticism, he warned that no general system could be immutable. For, he argued, the ultimate principles were veiled from us and we could approach them at best asymptotically, never actually reaching them. This fact should not deter us, for this was also the case with science, yet theories were the hallmark of scientific progress. Indeed, without 26 Process and Reality, p. 3.</page><page sequence="13">whitehead's philosophy 165 generalizations, he argued, we should possess only "brute matters of fact"; and in any case no one could consider the latter without going beyond them. For example, early man's consideration of stones led to him generalizing that some stones, sharpened, were valuable as implements. What, however, was the value of philosophical systems? White- head asked, and answered, not their "finality" but simply their progress. This begs the question. What is the touchstone of prog- ress? Whitehead answers this by considering first why philosophies fail. It is, he says, because of "incoherence" or lack of "logical per- fection"; for example, the existence in Descartes' philosophy of two separate substances, mind and matter. Of course, Whitehead must here have been very conscious of his own pan-physical dualism; in fact, Whitehead himself saw loopholes in this assertion, for, he con- tinued, the test of any metaphysical27 system was practice. "Whatever is found in 'practice' must lie within the scope of the metaphysical description. When the description fails to in- clude the 'practice/ the metaphysics is inadequate and requires revision."28 Elsewhere he wrote that: "This interplay of thought and practice is the supreme authority. It is the test by which the charlatanism of speculation is restrained."29 Clearly this important declaration was a consequence of his earlier failure; and it is synonymous with Marx's second thesis on Feuerbach: "The question whether objective truth can be attributed to human thinking is not a question of theory but is a practical question. In practice man must prove the truth, i.e., the reality and power, the 'this-sidedness' of his thinking." However, Whitehead goes on immediately to bind the practical value of philosophy to religion. Philosophy, he says, frees itself from the charge of ineffectiveness by its close relations with science and religion and by fusing the two into one rational scheme of thought. In the sense that both are attempts to justify brute fact, science, he argues, is only a variant of religion. But in another sense they are opposed. "Religion deals with the formation of the ex- 27 This is not Engels' use of the term. Here it means strictly "beyond" physics. 28 Process and Reality, p. 17. 29 See The Function of Reason,</page><page sequence="14">166 SCIENCE AND SOCIETY periencing subject; whereas science deals with the objects, which are the data forming the primary phase in this experience."30 This significant declaration lays bare the whole basis of the phi- losophy of organism, of Whitehead's "speculative" philosophy. On the one hand he inveighs boldly against all the agnostics (and espe- cially the growing school of logical positivists): man can not only not help himself, he must theorize and philosophize; and the value of all his theories is always measured by their practical efficacy. Such a view supports all that is most valuable in philosophy. At the same time he raises religion to a more important level than science in the formation of philosophy. Science provides only the data; the forma- tion of the experiencing subject, however, is religion. Critical questions such as: does this constitute an insurmount- able dualism? what is the ontological (existential) status of the concept "nature"? is the philosophy of Whitehead "logically per- fect"? does it stand the test of practice? must now be put and answered in the light of an exposition of the main aspects of the philosophy. //. The Basic Concepts We have previously examined the concepts of Whitehead's pan- physics. We found that, in his endeavor to avoid mechanical mate- rialism which he confounded with true materialism, Whitehead bi- furcated nature again into events and objects. Nor could he base a working physical philosophy on them, because on the one hand events were imperceptible, and on the other hand objects, the "recog- nita," were too vague and evaded unification. In the fully developed philosophy of organism Whitehead intro- duced three new, basic notions, which he hoped would cover all other concepts and unify them. These basic notions were actual entity, prehension and nexus. "In the three notions- actual entity, prehension and nexus- an endeavor has been made to base philosophic thought upon the most concrete elements in our experience."31 (1) Actual entities (or actual occasions) are the "final, real 30 Process and Reality, p. 22. 31 Ibid., p. 24.</page><page sequence="15">whitehead's philosophy 167 things" which go to make the world.32 There is nothing be- hind them in the sense in which Hume and Kant conceived of a reality behind "experience." The earlier concept "event," he explains, is more complex than "actual entity": any event consists of a number of actual entities. "God is an actual entity, and so is the most trivial puff of existence in far-off empty space."33 Actual entities, then, appear to be all pos- sible units. If one considers any thing or event, and breaks it down, presumably, according to Whitehead, the result is actual entities. One's first reaction must be that, apart from any other consideration, such a breakdown must depend upon the level of human knowledge. But to this we shall return. Actual entities, he goes on, are analyzable into (2) Prehensions, an analysis which exhibits "the most concrete elements in the nature of actual entities."34 Prehensions are a generalization of Locke's "ideas," in the same way that actual entities are a generalization of Locke's "powers." And it is important to emphasize that Locke defined his "ideas" as the "objects of thinking," not as the objects in nature. A prehension is, as the name implies, essentially a grasping-in of things to create something new. In other words, it is the actual entity as "seen," so to speak, when and where it is formed. A prehension expresses Nature's restlessness and activity, "the activity whereby an actual entity effects its own concretion of other things."35 For example, the for- mation of a molecule of salt from an atom of sodium and an atom of chlorine considered as a formation, a process, is a prehension. But prehensions are of all kinds, not merely chemical. Prehensions occur at all levels. A prehension has, to use a mathematical term, a vector character and "in- volves emotion, and purpose, and valuation, and causa- tion."36 32 Cf. Wittgenstein's "The world is the totality of facts not of things" (Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus, I 1). a« Process and Reality, p. 24. 34 Ibid., p. 25. 35 Ibid., p. 71. 36 Ibid., p. 25.</page><page sequence="16">168 SCIENCE AND SOCIETY Finally, by reason of their prehensions of each other, ac- tual entities are connected. Any such "particular fact of togetherness" is called a (3) nexus (plural nexus). These notions show why Whitehead called his philosophy "organism" and why he regarded the world as process. For in his view the essence of the universe was that it is in continuous process, whereby entities are grasped in to form nexus, or coalesce to form new entities, which in turn pre- sent themselves for further prehension. The resulting en- tities are the organisms, conscious and not-conscious, large and small, long- and short-lived. The universe itself is an organism. The notion of "organism" is combined with that of "process" in a twofold manner. The community of actual things is an organism; but it is not a static organism. It is an incompletion in process of produc- tion. Thus the expansion of the universe in respect to actual things is the first meaning of "process"; and the universe in any stage of its expansion is the first meaning of "organism." In this sense, an organism is a nexus. Secondly, each actual entity is itself only describable as an organic process. It repeats in microcosm what the universe is in macrocosm. It is a process proceeding from phase to phase, each phase being the real basis from which its successor proceeds towards the completion of the thing in question. Each actual entity bears in its constitution the "reasons" why its conditions are what they are. These "reasons" are the other actual entities objectified for it.37 At this stage one can say that Whitehead's idea of the universe both as an organism and as organisms in process resembles the ideas of the school of evolutionary philosophers. Whitehead sees Nature's movement and its evolution. But, in sharp distinction to dialec- tical materialism, Whiteheadian process seems to have a strange bias, not least arising from the introduction of "God." Here, at least, he departs from his "pan-physics." Whitehead followed on the three basic notions with an exposi- 37 Ibid., pp. 304/.</page><page sequence="17">whitehead's philosophy 169 tion of a host of categories describing the varied conjunctions and disjunctions of actual entities and prehensions. Of these, two may here be described. First is the category of the Ultimate, Creativity, "the universal of universais characterizing ultimate matter of fact/*38 Creativity unites the one and the many, the conjunctive and the disjunctive. It is also the principle of novelty, whose application to each particu- lar novel situation is the "creative advance" of Whitehead's pan- physics. But in neither sense is it explicable in terms of higher uni- versais or its own components. "The sole appeal is to intuition/'39 The second is the Eternal Objects. "Any entity whose concep- tual recognition does not involve a necessary reference to any definite actual entities of the temporal world is called an 'eternal object/ "40 The most concrete instances of eternal objects appear to be definite patches of distinct colors, distinct chords, and so on, each of which can, by addition, alter the balance of a picture or of a piece of music. In the actual entity described by "red coloring the sky this evening/' the eternal object is the particular and unrepeatable red at that time in that space. The introduction of the concept of eternal object marks a fur- ther considerable change from the pan-physical notion of types of objects. All the various types are replaced by the one notion, from which the other types arise. Eternal objects are an extension of Locke's "ideas." Locke wrote: ". . . men have in their mind several ideas, such as those expressed by the words, 'whiteness, hardness, sweetness, think- ing, motion, man, elephant, army, drunkenness/ and others."41 Whitehead argued that Locke was wrong to limit this to human con- sciousness. The whole of reality could be analyzed as the "ingres- sion" of Locke's "ideas"- eternal objects, into actual occasions. Another extension, this time from Whitehead's own pan-physics, occurs in the replacement of "events" by "actual entities." In contrast to the earlier concept, actual entities invade and include 38 Ibid., p. 28. 39 Ibid., p. 29. 40 Ibid., p. 60. 41 Locke, Essay Concerning Human Understanding, 1,1, 1.</page><page sequence="18">170 SCIENCE AND SOCIETY that other part of reality which, in his pan-physical period, White- head insisted it was not the job of philosophy to consider. For now, actual entities include all happenings from God to the "most trivial puff of existence in far-off empty space"; so that, via the analytical prehensions, which involve emotion, purpose, etc., the philosophy of organism embraces ethics and theology and esthetics. White- head's speculative philosophy aimed to be all-embracing. But clearly, Whitehead has not succeeded in producing the all- embracing system. True he wrote: "The theory of 'prehensions' embodies a protest against the 'bifurcation' of nature. It embodies even more than that: its protest is against the bifurcation of actu- alities."42 But the fact is, that he has redivided nature again- this time into actual entities and eternal objects. However, he tries to deny this re-bifurcation by asserting that the two notions differ from the classical concepts of universal and par- ticular. Like Hegel, he says that in considering any "particular" our attention is invariably drawn outside it for its full understand- ing; and conversely, consideration of any "universal" includes the particulars contained within it. For example: the particular "A. N. Whitehead" implies a distinction from other persons with the same surname; and conversely, the universal, "man," implies the existence of separate men. Whitehead, therefore, defined actual entities as the final, real things in, and eternal objects as the pure potentials of, the universe. The eternal objects determine how the actual entities come into being and how they vanish into their successors. But if the two concepts cannot be considered apart from each other, it must also be asked, is it possible to separate them at all? In the case of "red coloring the sky at evening" it seems quite clear that the separation is not in objective reality but in the thinking mind of the observer. "Red" cannot be isolated from "coloring": is "red coloring" an eternal object or an actual entity? Whitehead refers, in another context, to Locke's difficulty in separating simple from complex "ideas." Evidently this difficulty would constantly occur with Whitehead's system. As the late Professor Stebbing remarked: 42 Process and Reality, p. 410.</page><page sequence="19">whitehead's philosophy 171 "It would seem, then, that there is no function performed by eternal objects that is not also performed by actual entities/'43 In order to maintain a distinction between the two "notions," Whitehead hits upon the old Aristotelian conceptions of potential and actual. The actual entities are actual; the eternal objects merely potential. But the result is an even more formidable dualism- that between actual and potential ' 'worlds/' And, since eternal objects determine how the actual entities come into being, the po- tential here is logically prior to the actual; and it is therefore perti- nent to enquire how we know when actual entities come into being and whether there is any sense in speaking of a "potential world" if the eternal objects are known only in their actuality. The whole Whiteheadian "speculation" is honeycombed with absurdities. Many non-Marxist philosophers have rejected the idea of "eter- nal objects" on another ground, which follows logically from White- head's own criticism of "universais" and "particulars." This ground, which is in fact a criticism of non-dialectical philosophy as a whole, is the demand to know how entities like eternal objects can be singled out at all. For when we see the particular color of the sky at evening, we see the sky and all its features. The mind extracts the particu- lar color and defines it; we may photograph it; but the coloring remains an inseparable part of the sky as a whole. Finally, from the claim that nothing lies "behind the actual entities two conclusions follow. First, if everything in the universe (including God- if he exists) consists of varieties of the one unit (actual entities), then all reality is reduced to a single level and ". . . the process of actualization is thereby reduced to a mere shuiffling ... of primordial qualitative factors. In short, creation in the proper sense is denied. . . ."44 Consequently, it is meaning- less to talk of different levels, e.g., animate and inanimate. "Feeling [or positive prehension-H.F.] is predicated indiscriminately of di- verse entities on all levels. Such a procedure makes a discussion of various levels pointless."45 4« L. S.

Hence, all that phi- losophers and scientists could do after him was to build upon the "foundations" of the philosophy of organism, and to go no deeper. But, of course, scientists have not as a body ever accepted an abso- lute barrier to the further penetration of nature. Being a modest man, Whitehead probably never appreciated the enormity of his pre- sumption. We suggest that the "basic notions" of the philosophy of or- ganism are appropriate to, and reflect, twentieth-century capitalism. By comparing "eternal object" with the Platonic Idea, it should be possible to show this and, in particular, why Whitehead insisted on a distinction between his and Plato's concepts. The Platonic Idea comes to us through the famous analogy of the prisoners in the cave who, chained with their backs to the en- trance, see only the shadows of things thrown upon the wall. These shadows, Plato argued, are the familiar things of this world; that is to say, they are not real. The "real" things, the "Ideas," are those outside the cave, which the prisoners do not see. "The first we say are seen but are not thought, while the Ideas are thought but are not seen."46 If the prisoners are released and turn towards the cave mouth, they would be blinded by the light; but slowly and carefully some might finally adjust their eyes to see the forms in the external world. Analogously, Plato says, by dint of application to the study of geometry, the pursuit of philosophy, and so on, men may raise themselves towards the gods, towards knowing the Ideas; for knowl- edge of the Ideas is the only true knowledge. The background to the Platonic theory is classical Greece at a period of considerable internal strain. Of the eighty-five years sepa- rating the beginning of the Peloponnesian Wars and the Mace- donian conquest of Greece, fifty-five were occupied by wars. Society was so torn that demands arose for the abolition of all debts and for the redivision of the land. Any young Athenian born at about the time of Pericles' death found himself in an age of conflict wherever he went [writes Breasted]- an 46 Plato, Republic, Bk. VI, trans. A. D. Lindsay (London, 1926). I have substituted the word "Ideas" for the original "Forms" in the translation.</page><page sequence="21">whitehead's philosophy 173 age of conflict abroad on the field of battle as he stood with spear and shield in the Athenian ranks in the long years of warfare between Athens, Sparta, and Thebes; an age of conflict at home in Athens amid the excited shouting and applause of the turbulent Assembly or the tumult and even bloodshed of the streets and markets of the city as the common people, the democracy, struggled with the nobles for the lead- ership of the state, and, finally, an age of conflict in himself as he felt his once confident faith in old things struggling to maintain itself against new views.47 It was at this time that the Near Eastern countries, engaged in rapidly expanding trade, perhaps suggested to Plato the "solution" to this state of affairs- the rule of the Near East by a king or kings, who could combine authority with wisdom- philosophler-kings. And indeed only a few decades after, came Alexander the Great who finally formed a kingdom stretching from Greece to India. Who, according to Plato, were the philosophers? The philoso- phers were those who saw reason, who discerned the truth, the Ideas, behind the appearances of ordinary things. These philosophers could not be of the multitude, who were like the chained prisoners, see- ing only the shadows on the wall. "Is it possible that the multi- tude will endure, or believe in, the existence of beauty itself, or of any reality itself? They only admit the existence of many expres- sions of beauty, and many expressions of each reality/'48 Farrington has shown how Plato tried to fuse the discoveries of ancient Greek science, which demonstrated the flux of nature, with the ideas of Parmenides, for whom the flux was non-existent. Thus, while accepting that nature was in flux, Plato added that the flux was only the shadow of reality. This reactionary thesis was the philosophical basis of The Republic, a great but aristocratic appeal, by the principal Athenian philosopher of his time, for order in a slave society shaken by internal conflict. In Whitehead's Process and Reality there is no such linking of social ideas with philosophy as occurs in The Republic. But after what has been said of Plato, which is now commonly accepted, it 47 J.

According to Marxist theory, we are living at the imperialist stage of capitalism and during the epoch of socialist revolution. Like Plato's Athens, but on a far greater scale, society is in throes. Economic crises occur regularly, delayed only by wars and the ac- cumulation of armaments. Monopoly ". . . increases and intensifies the state of chaos inherent in capitalist production as a whole."49 The export of capital to underdeveloped countries, where profit is high, leads to economic, then to political-military redivision of the world among the great powers. The First World War killed mil- lions by actual fighting, starvation and disease. Political and eco- nomic disintegration, combined with a growing desire among the European masses to end the intolerable system that produced such misery and slaughter, brought about revolutions in many coun- tries and the establishment of proletarian dictatorship in the former Russian Empire. The situation in Western Europe and the United States in the nineteen-twenties has, we think, some particular significance in the development of the philosophy of organism. For while the United States, under its postwar relief program, supplied food to the devastated countries virtually free, as far as raw materials were concerned, business was business, and Europe's desperate need in this respect enabled American businessmen to amass colossal fortunes.50 A short boom in Europe, based on postwar shortages, soon collapsed, except in France. But in the United States, the boom continued right up till 1929, when, just as Britain was begin- ning to recover, the Wall Street collapse plunged this country and the United States into the greatest of all slumps. Process and Reality was written before the crash. Also it is important to add that, de- spite economic stagnation in the twenties, technical progress con- tinued and production rose. In short, although production was in conflict with social development, not all the bourgeois philosophers would become converts to the nihilism of positivism. Pointing to 49 Lenin, Imperialism, chap.

II.</page><page sequence="23">whitehead's philosophy 175 slow recovery after the disasters of war some would, in the twenties, still assert a slow progress. Under capitalism, also, science had advanced at a tremendous pace. In particular, physicists had discovered that the so-called ele- mentary particules displayed both wave and particulate properties; and in the idea of the process of actual entities and their concres- cence Whitehead sought to philosophize quantum and wave-me- chanical descriptions of nature. Also this appeared to agree with the facts of organic evolution. In other words, twentieth-century science having analyzed na- ture in much greater detail than anyone in Platonic time could have even envisaged, Whitehead interpreted it in a way which reflected his bourgeois view of contemporary history. Science had advanced to "practically perfect" knowledge of nature; therefore, what was to Plato mere shadow is much more real to Whitehead: nature in process is actual entities. But, in virtue both of lessening bourgeois confidence and the much smaller field left for metaphysical specu- lation, Whitehead replaces the Ideas Plato set on a pinnacle, by the less mighty and less definite eternal objects. While Plato declares that knowledge of Ideas can be attained only through the greatest mental and spiritual effort, Whitehead causes eternal objects quietly and mysteriously to ingress; they are dethroned Ideas. The "basic notions" of the philosophy of organism represent at once an advance upon, and a decline from Platonic idealism. Finally, Whitehead's notions appear to stand for an inversion of Platonic idealism. For Plato's "reality" consisted of Ideas, or gen- eralizations from particulars- class-words- while Whitehead's "real- ity" is comprised of actual entities which, inasmuch as they perish, cannot be regarded as anything but the opposite of generalized terms or class-words like "man." Again, to Plato the objects, or things of ordinary perception, are mere shadow-appearances, whereas the shadow-appearances in Whitehead's system are not the things but the eternal objects, which have this in common with Plato's Ideas, that they can be categorized as pure forms. But the apparent opposition conceals an identity. For both Plato's Ideas and Whitehead's actual entities, both regarded by their creators as composing "reality," are not real at all but fictions. The</page><page sequence="24">176 SCIENCE AND SOCIETY inversion reflects the different epochs of the two philosophers, while their identity reflects their common ruling-class standpoint. ///. The Formation of Reality In the concrescence of actual entities to form another, an eternal object is said to ingress in a particular "mode." Therefore, says Whitehead, ". . . how an actual entity becomes constitutes what that actual entity is. ... Its 'being' is constituted by its 'becoming/ This is the 'principle of process/ "51 "Process is the becoming of experience," he says further on. "It follows that the philosophy of organism entirely accepts the sub- jectivist bias of modern philosophy/'52 In other words "process" is a subjective affair directed towards the formation, by concrescence, of each and every actual entity. Incidentally, as far as Whitehead's acceptance of the "subjecti- vist bias of modern philosophy" is concerned, this contradicts his previous rejection of the subjectivism of Eddington and others.53 This rejection was on three grounds that: (1) the world is not within us, but that we are within the world; (2) there was a time on earth when no living being existed; and (3) our instinct for action is linked with the instinct for "transcending" ourselves. It should be said at once that Whitehead's subjectivist bias is quite different from Eddington's. Eddington believed that material things were illusory, whereas Whitehead here asserts that nature- in-process, which is reality, is directed towards the formation of ac- tual entities as "experiencing subjects." From our previous re- marks it is evident that Whitehead's philosophy of organism is sub- jective, but does not assert the illusoriness of nature. In Whitehead's concept of "process," however, the actual entities come into being and perish. "Process" transcends the particular actual entities. Whitehead, therefore, sets himself the task of ex- plaining what this transcendence is. For if there were no transcend- ence, there would be only what he calls "bare activity." "How do 51 Process and Reality, p. 31. 52 Ibid., p. 233. 53 Science and the Modern World, chap. V.</page><page sequence="25">whitehead's philosophy 177 we add content to the notion of bare activity?' ' he asks. "Activity for what, producing what, activity involving what?"54 The answer he gave lay in his theory of "feelings/* Feelings are positive prehensions, as opposed to negative prehensions, which exclude anything from the process of concrescence. Feelings may be simple or complex; and the process of concrescence of any actual entity consists of many phases in which the later, complex feelings integrate the earlier, simple feelings up to the final phase which is termed a "satisfaction/* As "satisfaction* * the actual entity then be- comes a "decision" for further feeling. Already, Whitehead's theory has a decidedly irrationalist tinge and also suggests a sort of animism, as if the phases of concrescence involve a living principle. Indeed he writes: "In its self -creation the actual entity is guided by its ideal of itself as individual satis- faction and as transcendent creator. The enjoyment of this ideal is the 'subjective aim/ by reason of which the actual entity is a de- terminate process. This subjective aim is not primarily intellec- tual; it is the lure for feeling. This lure for feeling is the germ of mind. Here I am using the term 'mind* to mean the complex of mental operations involved in the constitution of an actual entity. Mental operations do not necessarily involve consciousness."55 It is difficult at first to understand what all this means. No reputable scientist would maintain the view that all natural processes involve some sort of life, as Whitehead's terminology suggests. Sci- entists would ridicule the suggestion that in, say, the formation of a mountain before the appearance of living things on Earth, the latter "felt" the movement or "felt" a "satisfaction" when the process was completed. Again, who or what made the completed action a "de- cision" for something in the future? (To this Whitehead would an- swer, the mountain itself!) Or, when sodium and chlorine, say, are united by natural or human action to form common salt, White- head says the atoms "lure" one another, or are lured. Clearly these terms are part of a new mumbo-jumbo and a misuse of language that explains nothing. But, of course, there is meaning to it. This irrational animism 54 Modes of Thought, p. 200. 55 Process and Reality, p. 118.</page><page sequence="26">178 SCIENCE AND SOCIETY is not peculiar to Whitehead. It is one more form of the trend that includes Bergson's intuitionism and the whole school of philoso- phies which try to unify so-called physical nature and the "world of value and emotion/' not by "universal mind" but by its apparent opposite, a universal drive whose meaning is beyond scientific un- derstanding. In the philosophy of organism the universal drive is called sub- jective aim. "The 'subjective aim* at 'satisfaction* constitutes the final cause, or lure, whereby there is determinate concrescence; and that attained 'satisfaction* remains as an element in the content of creative purpose. There is, in this way, transcendence of the crea- tivity. . . ."56 Or, putting it another way, the nature of "reality" must be re- garded as in two parts. On the one hand there is the "extensive continuum," as revealed through mathematics and physics; this is the picture of the universe, sensed as continuous, but in fact divided and atomic, being a multiplicity of actual entities."57 On the other hand, "The bare mathematical potentialities of the extensive con- tinuum require an additional content in order to assume the role of real objects for the subject. This content is supplied by the eternal objects, termed sense-data."58 It follows that, whichever way the matter is looked at, all content constitutes a world other than that of the actual entities. Nature regarded "scientifically" is merely an extensive, atomic continuum, without meaning in itself. "Lure," "feeling," "satisfaction," "deci- sion" and "subjective aim" emerge from that other world, which is described as always potential, only becoming actual when the eter- nal object ingresses into and transforms the past actual entities into the present concrescence. But this inversion of Aristotelianism means that the actual is dependent upon, and logically a posteriori to, the potential. "Na- ture" awaits "life," actual entities cannot come into being without eternal objects, the extensive continuum is nothing without sub- jective aim. How the potential can be more "real" than the "ac- 56 Ibid., p. 121. 57 Ibid., p. 85. 58 Ibid., p. 86.</page><page sequence="27">whitehead's philosophy 179 tuai" Whitehead can explain only idealistically- by assuming that it can be more real and by asserting the existence of another being which, so to speak, orders the appearance and ingression of eternal objects, i.e., orders the "aim" of the universe. This being is, of course, God. "Apart from God, eternal objects unrealized in the actual world would be relatively non-existent for the concrescence in question."59 Let us revert for a while to the question of the atomistic view of nature. In the first place, can actual entities, eternal objects, or their "feelings," be said to exist outside Whitehead's mind (or the minds of those few who believe in these notions)? The answer must be, no; and indeed no evidence appears throughout Process and Reality to prove their existence. Quite the contrary. "Owing to the vagueness of our conscious analysis of complex feelings, perhaps we never consciously discriminate one simple physical feeling in isolation," he says.60 Yet he coolly goes on: "But all our physical relationships are made up of such simple physical feelings, as their atomic bricks."61 In other words, although we cannot perceive simple physical feel- ings, Whitehead claims they are the basic units of physical relation- ships. Clearly Whitehead can make no such claim. Also, this non- discrimination of simple physical feelings, i.e., feelings of single actual entities, throws additional doubt upon the existence of actual entities. What, then, is the ontological and epistemological status of the actual entity, the "really real thing"? It is a subjective fan- tasy of Whitehead's reflecting the widely-held view that nature is ultimately atomistic. That belief in its existence is a matter of faith is supported by the inclusion of God among actual entities. How much more a matter of faith must be belief in eternal ob- jects, which are not even "actual" but only "potential"? And the whole philosophy of organism- its theory of nature and of becoming, is based upon these two notions! Whitehead certainly fails accord- ing to his own criterion of practice. In this respect the course of his philosophy resembles the fate 59 Ibid., p. 42. 60 Ibid., p. 335. 61 hoc. cit.</page><page sequence="28">180 SCIENCE AND SOCIETY of logical positivism. This philosophy started off with Bertrand Russell arguing that the world consisted of "logical atoms," which were then succeeded by Wittgenstein's "atomic facts." Rejecting this, the Viennese Circle went on to assert that philosophy dealt, not with "objects" and "states of affairs," but simply with words and statements; i.e., philosophy was merely the analysis of language. Where belief is expressed in the analysis of nature into ultimate units, therefore, an inevitable narrowing of the content of philosophy ensues, for the belief is at variance with knowledge. It is important to record that the view that nature is particulate at all, has had a checkered career. While it was, rightly, to the fore in periods of scientific advance (e.g., with Democritus and Newton), it was invariably opposed by the view that nature was fluent (e.g., by Heraclitus and Huyghens). Today, after decades of "atomism," the fluency theory is again attracting scientists' attention. In 1947, for example, Heisenberg argued that there were two reasons for the failure of the theory of elementary particles: (1) that it does not take into account the size and mass of the different particles, the number and variety of which are continually increasing, and (2) that it neglects the fact that particles could be transformed one into the other. Heisenberg, therefore, urged that the fundamental fact to be considered was the interaction of particles.62 In the Soviet Union, J. Frenkel has proposed a theory that matter is basically fluent, and the various elementary particles knots or nodes in it. It is true that Whitehead's type of atomism is not strictly New- tonian or in line with the quantum theory of matter. Whitehead's atomism leaves no gaps in nature, no "empty space" between the units. It simply divides up the universal continuum like a jigsaw puzzle. His error, therefore, lies more in trying to build nature with unreal bricks than in puzzling out what lies between the bricks, or where the bricks end and "empty" space begins. Where he is at one with the "atomists" is in looking at reality not, as he claims, in process, but to create ultimate units with which he can, like God, build the universe. But his reality becomes dual, and both halves unreal; and to heal the division, to try and make real what is 62 W. Heisenberg, Two Lectures delivered at the Cavendish Laboratory, 1947 (Cam- bridge, 1949).</page><page sequence="29">whitehead's philosophy 181 unreal, to bring "content" into "bare activity," he flies willy-nilly to "God." IV. God and the World We have described how and why Whitehead finds the source of eternal objects, of novelty and unity in God. To discover whether this really solves the problem of formulating a "coherent philoso- phy," valuable in practice, we must examine this God. Whitehead regards God as having two "natures," the "primor- dial" and the "consequent." The primordial nature is God as the origination of the world and his immanence in it. It is an abstrac- tion, in Whitehead's own words, which expresses itself as an "urge towards the future." It is "deficient in actuality." "Viewed as pri- mordial, he is the unlimited conceptual realization of the absolute wealth of potentiality. In this aspect, he is not before all creation, but with all creation."63 At the same time God's immanence in the world via his pri- mordial nature carries with it no ideological implications. That is to say, the primordial nature does not determine how the universe evolves. "The given course of history presupposes his [God's] pri- mordial nature, but his primordial nature does not presuppose it."64 It follows that God, in respect of this primordial nature, is in- different to both good and evil in the world. "He [God], in his primordial nature, is unmoved by love for this particular, or that particular. ... In the foundations of his being, God is indifferent alike to preservation and to novelty."65 "This function of God," he declares, is analogous to the remorseless working of things in Greek and Buddhist thought."66 However, there must necessarily be another side to God, which comprehends the particular facts, gives some "reason" for them- in short, provides the teleological principle lacking in the primordial nature. It is this other side which Whitehead calls God's "conse- 63 Process and Reality, p. 486. 64 Ibid., p. 60. 65 Ibid., p. 46. 66 Ibid., p. 345.</page><page sequence="30">182 SCIENCE AND SOCIETY quent" nature. "God, as well as being primordial, is also conse- quent. He is the beginning and the end. . . ."67 But, says Whitehead, being "the end" does not mean that God, in his consequent nature, comes after the world: this would in fact divorce God from the world. "The completion of God's nature into a fullness of physical feeling is derived from the objectification of the world in God. He shares with every new creation its actual world. . . . This prehension into God of each creature is directed with the subjective aim, and clothed with the subjective form . . . his [God's] derivative nature is consequent upon the creative ad- vance of the world."68 God's consequent nature is his judgment on the world. "It is the judgment of a tenderness which loses nothing that is saved."69 Within the consequent nature "there is no loss, no obstruction. . . . The revolts of destructive evil, purely self-regarding, are dismissed into their triviality of merely individual facts."70 And, in a way over and above both the primordial and the consequent nature, God in fact determines everything about the world. "Apart from the intervention of God there could be nothing new in the world, and no order in the world. The course of creation would be a dead level of ineffectiveness, with all balance and in- tensity progressively excluded by the cross-currents of incompati- bility."71 This reference to the "cross-currents of incompatibility" is a passing recognition that the course of creation is not a steady prog- ress, as the nineteenth-century liberal philosophers envisaged it. In his categorical scheme Whitehead recognized the undoubted diver- gences, setbacks and regressions in nature and history under such terms as "objective diversity," "conceptual reversion" and "transmu- tation." These terms indeed were equivalent to aspects of the dia- lectic, of the opposites in nature. But now all such diversities and dialectical changes vanish within God. 67 Ibid., p. 488. 68 Ibid., p. 489. 69 hoc. cit. 70 Ibid., p. 490. 71 Ibid., p. 349.</page><page sequence="31">whitehead's philosophy 183 A hundred years ago Marx wrote what subsequent discussion of the subject shows to have been the profoundest analysis of reli- gion. "Man," he wrote, "is not an abstract being existing outside the world. Man is the world of men, the State, society. This State, this society, produces religion- an inverted consciousness of the world- because the world itself is an inverted world. Of this world religion is the general theory, ... its moral sanction, its sol- emn completion, its universal ground for truth and justification. It is the imaginary realization of the human essence, necessary be- cause the human essence has no true reality/*72 That this social basis of religion is true is now so widely accepted that a leading religious historian can almost paraphrase some of Marx's eloquent phrases, when, speaking of primitive religion, he writes: "The pressing events in the external world and in the imme- diate circle of human relationships, the struggle for existence and survival, the innumerable daily frustrations and awe-inspiring ex- periences, often completely outside human control and beyond comprehension; above all the ceaseless preoccupation with the means of subsistence and continuance of the species- these were and are the causes and occasions of the emotional situation out of which rite and belief have emerged."73 These rites, James continues, not only help primitive people to carry out vital functions, but are also ". . . the expression of a sense of dependence on a power outside both man and society, a power that may be described as Providence in the sense of the concrete universal good, the sum total of the bene- ficence and bounty of the world and its processes."74 As Marx implied, and as many historians of religion have shown, different societies produced different religions. Whitehead specifi- cally compares his type with Buddhism, but we must bear in mind that he was reared in the Anglican tradition. Christianity can, for our purposes, be understood as an alternative to Hebraism, in which God was seen as a being cast in human images- an anthropomorphic God who intervened to guide his people, reward good deeds and punish wickedness. As Hebraic power in the Near East declined, 72 Marx, Introduction to a Critique of Hegel's Philosophy of Law, 73 E. O. James, The Concept of Deity (London, 1950), p. 17. 74 Ibid,, p. 21.</page><page sequence="32">184 SCIENCE AND SOCIETY so did this vision change, some of the "cruder" anthropomorphisms being rejected. In the turmoil of the rise of Roman power and what it meant in suffering for slaves, other lower classes and minor races, Christianity, with its conception of a suffering, personal and re- deeming God not confined to one race, inevitably won millions of hearts. In modern times Christianity, as the great subjective reli- gion, was the perfect instrument for the bourgeoisie to employ against feudal autocracy. Therefore, Whitehead's religion is likely to carry this element of Christianity; and quite clearly this is contained in his conception of God's "consequent" nature, in which Christ's self- sacrifice for man's redemption is transformed into the idea that all man's evil and suffering vanish into their "triviality." However, Whitehead's transformation of Christianity takes it further along a road on which it becomes less and less like its origi- nal. It is now well known that the Christianity of, say, Matthew, with its uncompromising rejection of wealth and its forthright sup- port for action and the here-now- "God is not the God of the dead, but of the living," was toned down by Paul and deflected more to man's reward in the hereafter. In this sense Whitehead is definitely with Paul and against the original Christianity. This tendency is reinforced by Whitehead's sympathy with a Buddhism that is not popular Buddhism, but the Buddhism of the monks. Popular Buddhism, like early Hebraism and early Chris- tianity too, conceived its supernatural figure- the Buddha, inter- vening in the world to help the people. When taken up by the monks it degenerated, as one might say, like Christianity under Paul.75 Why, then, should Buddhism appeal to Whitehead? Because, in its later development, Buddhism's final goal "was and is deliver- ance from all striving and the attainment of a state of passionless peace. . . ."76 And in a period of capitalist decline, such a quiescent religion bears a certain attraction, particularly when it is set up on a quasi-scientific foundation.77 75 Cf. D. Saurat, A History of Religions (London, 1938), pp. 281 /. 76 James, op. cit., p. 68. 77 This is not to say that Buddhism has no positive features. Buddhism's emphasis on peace is a major factor in the anti-war attitude of the peoples of the Far East.</page><page sequence="33">whitehead's philosophy 185 Among religious philosophers, however, Whitehead's concept of God is criticized chiefly on the grounds of its uselessness. W. G. de Burgh declared that "... we are left with a God who, though not identical with the totality of the universe, is wholly relative to its temporal history. . . . While he [Whitehead] recognizes the need of a permanent amid change, he leaves us uncertain as to the man- ner in which this need is met by his philosophy/ '78 And while its quasi-scientific basis gives it a certain appeal among scientist-philosophers- "I personally am convinced that if there is a God who has anything to do with nature, he is the sort of God who appears in Whitehead's system"79- it is criticized on the ground that it explains nothing that is not already known or understood. The notion of God as the origin of all value, remarks one non-Marx- ist critic, although possessing "emotional force," is a tautology.80 Whitehead's God is, therefore, unlikely to have a wide appeal, because it cannot satisfy the need of those who today seek a Good Lord. It is not, in the words of Professor James, "responsive to hu- man needs, the . . . sovereign moral ruler of the universe, . . . the ultimate standard of conduct, a worthy object of worship, the guide of man from the cradle to the grave and the hope of immortality."81 This evolving, endless, fatalistic God is at odds with, at least, the Christian conception of a self-existent, complete and infinite being. No wonder one honest religious critic was moved to state: "If the term or concept of God were to be eliminated from Whitehead's explications of these esthetic, moral, and spiritual aspects of the temporal world and of human experience, what would be the alter- native? We would still be faced with the existence and reality of these aspects of experience. Man would still establish standards of value and make value judgments; he would still compare the world as it is with the world as it might be. He would still write poems, paint pictures, compose music, and aspire towards ideals in all phases 78 Philosophy, XIV, 211. 79 V. Lowe, in the symposium, Whitehead and the Modern World (Boston, 1950), p. 22. 80 R. B. Braithwaite, Mind, 1926, pp. 498 ff. 81 E. O. James, op. cit., p. 152.</page><page sequence="34">186 SCIENCE AND SOCIETY of his life. He would still, above all, combat evil in the form of dis- ease, conflict, and every other form of destruction."82 And, finally, Whitehead's God fails to meet Whitehead's own criterion of logical perfection. For this is a dual God which, in the attempt to bring eternal objects to the actual entities, novelty into the world, presents a new cleavage, a new division. Whitehead's God is a deus ex machina designed to provide a means of healing the split in Whitehead's concept of nature. It is no more real than his eternal objects or actual entities. It sunders itself. Realizing that his conceptions of a God- World dualism and a dual God were fatal to his philosophy, Whitehead supposed a su- perior unity, Creativity, or the Creative Advance, which ". . . achieves its supreme task of transforming disjoined multiplicity, with its di- versities in opposition, into concrescent unity with its diversities in contrast. . . ."M This is followed by a final phase, in which the "perfected actuality passes back into the temporal world, ... the kingdom of heaven is with us today."84 This process, Whitehead recognizes, still does not abolish the dualism in his system. On the contrary, he comes finally to the con- clusion that dualism is inherent in the nature of things. "Thus the universe is to be conceived as attaining the active self-expression of its own variety of opposites- of its own freedom and its own necessity, of its own multiplicity and its own unity, of its own imper- fection and its own perfection. All the 'opposites' are elements in the nature of things, and are incorrigibly there. The concept of 'God' is the way in which we understand this incredible fact- that what cannot be, yet is."85 Even non-Marxist metaphysicians found the notion of Creativity most unsatisfying. Dr. A. E. Taylor called it pure nothing and said: "I cannot conceive of a pure nothing which, remaining a nothing, has a vague impulse urging it on to acquire some sort of features for itself. . .

At this stage, Marxist criticism diverges from purely analytical criticism. The latter concludes that Whitehead's concepts are "non- sense/* because the statements involving them are unverifiable. While agreeing that the concepts are full of absurdities, Marxists go on to say that they reflect a certain attitude to the world, to reality. The "analysts" say, "This may well be so, but that is the business of psychologists and sociologists/' But, apart from any other con- sideration-such as that bourgeois psychologists and sociologists tend themselves to base their theories upon the unconsciously-adopted tenets of idealism or of positivism, the analytical reply, by putting up artificial barriers, succeeds in stultifying the study of philosophy. In our case this is overwhelmingly evident at this stage, when the logical analyst would say, "You have gone too far already; for you have discussed extensively a whole series of nonsensical concepts and trespassed upon the territory, not only of the sociologist but of the historian and economist also. Besides, all you have been doing is trying to adduce support for a single theory, which is metaphysical in itself." But in the next section we compare the philosophy of White- head with the philosophy of Hegel, one of the few great philosophers whom Professor Ayer, at least, does not claim to have been primarily an "analyst." For between Hegel and Whitehead some have dis- cerned a more than striking resemblance, even almost an identity.88 We will try to show how they differ, and how the difference reflects the important historical changes that took place between the times of the two philosophers, roughly a century apart. V. The Hegelian-Marxist Alternative The basis of Hegel's logic or philosophy is, of course, the idea of contradiction. "The ground ... is to be sought in a perception of the 87 C. Hartshorne in Whitehead and the Modern World, p. 40. 88 R. C. Whittemore, "Hegel's 'Science' and Wihitehead's 'Modern World, Philoso- phy, January 1956. Whitehead himself saw a marked resemblance.</page><page sequence="36">188 SCIENCE AND SOCIETY necessary conflict with each other of the determinations of Under- standing."89 For " . . . all things are contradictory in themselves "90 This view was in direct opposition to the traditional logic, in which ". . . determinations are assumed to stand immovably rigid and are brought into a merely external relation with one another";91 i.e. what Engels called metaphysics. Hegel stressed that contradiction did not, as in traditional logic, mean simply dissolution, the end, but transition to a new and higher level. The one and only thing for securing scientific progress (and for quite simple insight into which, it is essential to strike) -is knowledge of the logical precept that Negation is just as much Affirmation as Negation, or that what is self-contradictory resolves itself not into nullity, into ab- stract Nothingness, but essentially only into the negation of its partic- ular content. . . . Since what results, the negation, is a definite negation, it has content. It is a new concept, but a higher, richer concept than that which preceded; for it has been enriched by the negation or opposite of that preceding concept, and thus contains it, but contains also more than it, and is the unity of it and its opposite.92 What attitude, he asked, had hitherto been taken to the exist- ence of contradiction? In the first place, "Contradiction, both in actuality and in thinking reflection, is considered an accident, a kind or abnormality or paroxysm of sickness which will soon pass away.93 And, in the second place, it has been regarded as being less important logically than the principal of identity. But, said Hegel, "... if there were any question of rank, and the two determinations had to be fixed as separate, Contradiction would have to be taken as the profounder and more fully essential. For as opposed to it Identity is only the determination of the simple immediate, or of dead Be- ing, while Contradiction is the root of all movement and life, and it is only in so far as it contains a Contradiction that anything moves and has impulse and activity."94 For Identity, he argues elsewhere 89 Hegel, The Science of Logic (London, 1929), I, p. 56. 90 Science of Logic, II, p. 66. 91 Ibid., p. 63. 92 Ibid., p. 65. 93 Ibid., p. 67. 94 Loc. cit.</page><page sequence="37">whitehead's philosophy 189 in The Science of Logic, being merely the assertion that A is identi- cal with A and is not-A, is merely tautology. What is clear from the preceding quotations is the difference between Whitehead's ' 'active self-expression of the variety of oppo- sites" and Hegel's principle of contradiction. The basis of the phi- losophy of organism is not in the perception of contradiction in all things, but in the assertion that all things are reducible to units. This assertion is a form of the principle of identity; the actual entities and eternal objects have their own particular identity and contain no internal contradiction. Rather, in Whitehead's scheme contradiction is precisely that which Hegel rejected as ". . . deter- minations [which] are assumed to stand immovably rigid and are brought into merely external relation with one another." The actual entities do not reveal themselves as self-contradictory; and their relations are defined according to Whitehead's theory of extensive connection - by such terms as inclusion, exclusion, overlapping and intersection, i.e., what Hegel calls external relations. Also, when a duality appears, this becomes, not a Hegelian negation, which is a transition to a higher level, but what the discoverer of the dialectic called a nullity, in as much as it can only be surmounted by the introduction of an external concept, e.g. God, Creativity, which is not the result of the clash of opposites but an instrument to "prove" that the duality is not really real. , Where Whitehead resembles Hegel is in religion. Here the Prussian patriot from Stuttgart abandoned his own logic, finding no contradiction in the Absolute, a line which right and neo-Hegel- ians took up, subordinating the dialectic still further to mysticism. Whitehead did in fact read neo-Hegelianism, in Bradley. The result is a resemblance which reveals another interesting divergence. According to Hegel the creation of the world has the form of a triad. There is God in his eternity before the creation of the world- the absolute, eternal Idea. What God creates is his Other, to which it is in his nature to reconcile himself. In reconciling itself with its Other that God or Spirit fulfills itself; and in this way Spirit is pres- ent in its Church. Or, ". . . put more definitely, what is involved in this idea is that the Universal Spirit, the Whole which this Spirit is, posits itself together with its three characteristics or de-</page><page sequence="38">190 SCIENCE AND SOCIETY terminations, develops itself, realizes itself, and that only at the end we have in a completed form what constitutes at the same time its presupposition."06 This he put still more clearly in The Science of Logic: ". . . Absolute Spirit, which is found to be the concrete, last and highest truth of all Being, at the end of its evolution freely passes beyond itself . . . What is essential for the Science is not so much that a pure and immediate is the beginning, but that itself in its totaliter forms a cycle returning upon itself, wherein the first is also last, and the last first."96 In Whitehead this movement of the Absolute, Spirit or God is similar yet subtly different. True, there is God and there is the world and each actuality in the world has its correlate in God: God and the world are * 'reconciled," indeed are never parted. Also the consequent nature of God, this endless reconciliation and "perfected actuality," is not the end of the matter, but, as in Hegel, passes back into the world- "For the Kingdom of heaven is with us today."07 Thus the movement is similar to Hegel's, but different because for Hegel God himself was absolute, whereas in Whitehead neither God nor the world is ever really absolute. "It is as true to say that God is permanent and the world fluent, as that the world is permanent and God fluent. ... It is as true to say that God transcends the world, as that the world transcends God."98 It is our contention that a com- parison of their historical backgrounds should promote some under- standing of both the similarity and the difference. The early nineteenth century in Europe was, as everyone knows, a period of reaction and "restoration under control." The dissolu- tion of feudalism in France inspired an alliance of the ruling class of the principal European states to crush the international revolu- tionary movement. Their slogan could well have been Metternich's dictum: "Sovereigns alone are entitled to guide the destinies of their peoples, and they are responsible to none but God." But, while the movement could be checked, it could not be ok Hegel, Lectures on the Philosophy of Religion (London, 1895), Vol. Ill, pp. 1 /. 96 The Science of Logic, I, 83. 97 Process and Reality, p. 497. 98 Ibid., p. 492.</page><page sequence="39">whitehead's philosophy 191 halted. East Prussia remained a Junker autocracy, but the West had been "contaminated'' by revolutionary ideas during the French oc- cupation and some concessions were necessary. The abolition of serfdom and other measures assisted in the creation of a patriotic sentiment. In turn the Junkers, through Metternich and the King of Prussia, repressed all radical and liberal ideas. However, the Indus- trial Revolution had also begun and rapid advances in manufacture, transport, power and communications, especially in England, had broken down old barriers and opened up great, new prospects. A working class was growing up, learning its historic role in fac- tories and mills. Progress in Prussia as a whole was slow because of several fac- tors, the most important of which was perhaps the lack of German political unity. In 1818, it is true, Prussia created a single tariff system and invited other German states to join it. The actual poli- tical unity did not come for several decades. The great step in philosophy made by Hegel when he discovered the dialectic was, of course, also a reflection of this historic period. The scientific-mechanistic method applied by Locke and Hume had reached a critical stage. Kant had shown that to fundamental ques- tions regarding the universe there were contradictory answers. This, against a background of violent historical change, provided a stage, not only for Hegel's great discovery, but for its subordination, among his ' "right" disciples as well as with Hegel himself, to the Absolute, the visible political expression of which was the Prussian State. The dialectic ended supremely in the Absolute, because the class Metternich represented was so confident in its rule. In Whitehead's case the situation is quite different; for, although there was a change in the first quarter of the twentieth century, it was not of the same kind. The expansion and revolutionization of industry, conflicting with its private ownership, produced well- known characteristics- boom and slump, the drive for markets and raw materials, and the re-division of the world. Just when Whitehead was turning to philosophical considerations came the first holocaust, through which millions died, either in actual warfare or by its by- products, starvation and disease. Still, mankind went on, for Euro- pean society began to recover- very slowly in the immediate post-war</page><page sequence="40">192 SCIENCE AND SOCIETY years, picking up during 1925-1929, in the last year of which Process of Reality appeared. But recovery was uneven; Russia as far as the bourgeoisie were concerned, had gone to the devil anyway, and Germany had collapsed completely. Idealist philosophers inevitably saw humanity as a vast, conflict-ridden mass of individuals, social groups, whole nations and above all the human race itself, struggling for survival and progress apparently under a divine guidance that was hard to understand. In their view only God could be the source, urge and final aim of this movement. No other view, except a causal- materialist, dialectical one, in which historical development arises from the class struggle, or one which denied causality altogether, was possible. Physics seemed to provide additional evidence for this view. On the one hand, research into the constitution of matter showed it to be composed largely of empty space in which infinitesimally small particles moved according to strange, new laws which appeared to deny causality. On the other hand, Einstein's theory of relativity had, much against its author's own wishes, been reinterpreted to support the view that all knowledge was relative to one's own stand- point and that, consequently it was nonsense to talk of an objective reality independent of mind. Caudwell has explained how and why the bourgeois philosopher confuses causality with pre-determinism." Pre-determination, what bourgeois philosophers erroneously call determinism, is the doc- trine, embodied in Laplace's idea of a super-calculator, that once the dispositions and velocities of certain particles or events are known, the whole future of the universe can be predicted, i.e., is predetermined. But this means that the calculator (or observer) is standing outside the universe, and so equates it or him with God. Such strict determinism (pre-determinism) is characteristic of meta- physical mechanism, which was apparently being abandoned by ' 'rebel" bourgeois scientists in the twentieth century as a result, di- rectly of the discoveries in physics, and more deeply as a reflection of the degeneration of capitalism in the imperialist stage. Because those scientists fail to see that causality- the cause-effect relationship (which is one description of the movement of reality) is dialectical, 99 Caudwell, The Crisis in Physics (London, 1939), chaps. IV and V.</page><page sequence="41">whitehead's philosophy 193 the twin alternatives are the abandonment of the idea that there is any law at all in the universe (logical positivism), or its transference to God (overt idealism). The alternatives are twins, because in each case objective reality is regarded as "lawless" in itself. The older, traditional idealists of this period, of whom White- head may be regarded as the supreme example, and among whom Einstein may, with qualifications, be included, realized that the trend towards subjectivism ends logically in solipsism, and fought against it. Whitehead asserted the objective existence of something, but this something was mechanistic- an "ether," continuum or field of absolute units. Such a structure corresponds to the division of labor in capitalist society. Like factories, companies and other capi- talist units, the actual entities are only in spatial relationships to- wards one another; and these relationships are accidental. The inte- gration of actual entities is achieved by something outside the units themselves, corresponding to the mystique of the "market." The evolutionary integration of wider and wider "organisms" in White- head's philosophy is a particular reflection- perhaps the most com- petent in traditional idealist form, of capitalism at its highest and most contradictory stage. And therefore Whitehead could not rejoice, as did Hegel, in the discovery that contradiction was the essence of things. In Whitehead the opposites are regretted; they are a sickness, to use Hegel's word. Nor could he envisage men attaining perfection: there is no Abso- lute Idea, eternal, changeless: Creativity does not abolish the op- posites but transforms them into "contrasts." Idealist philosophers cannot in the twentieth century look forward with the confidence their predecessors could a hundred years before. VI. The Final Phase Faced in his philosophy of organism with the irremovable dual- ism, even within God, which is simply the contradiction between what is and what ought to be, put idealistically; and unable to point the way out of the contradictions because this would mean pointing the way out of capitalism, Whitehead took the last steps away from reality, into the ivory tower.</page><page sequence="42">194 SCIENCE AND SOCIETY At first he sought to find the understanding of things in esthetic satisfaction. Thus, in December 1936, concluding a discussion of his philosophy at Cambridge, Massachusetts, he said: "My own be- lief is that at present the most fruitful, because the most neglected starting point [in philosophy] is that section of value-theory which we term esthetics."100 For example, the judge of the Supreme Court gives his decision "on the basis of the esthetic satisfaction of the harmonization of the American Constitution with the activities of modern America."101 To the extent that there is satisfaction in a job well done this is true; but at the same time esthetics can never explain why there is an American Constitution, a modern America, or even a judge of the Supreme Court! One of the false assumptions of modern esthetics is that art is simply design, the arrangement of patterning of colors, lines, vol- umes, the meaning of which is inessential to the result. In this way art is said to be akin to mathematics, which is regarded as mere patterning or arrangement of symbols whose content is irrevelant to the mathematical processes. Whitehead went still further. "Ac- tivity," he declared, "means the origination of patterns of assem- blage, and mathematics is the study of pattern. Here we find the essential clue which relates mathematics to the study of the good, and the study of the bad."102 Yet, as he pointed out a few years earlier, mathematics, which he joined with the Platonic Ideas, could not contain civilization's ultimate quality. "The Platonic 'Ideas' and 'Mathematical Relations'," he wrote, "seem to kill it by their ab- sence of 'life and motion/ Apart from it, the pursuit of 'Truth, Beauty, Adventure, Art* can be ruthless, hard cruel. . . ."103 What then was this ultimate quality? It was "Peace." "I choose the term 'Peace' for that Harmony of Harmonies which calme des- tructive turbulence and completes civilization."104 But Whitehead's Peace is not the mundane peace of absence of war. It is a subjective, 100 Philosophical Review, March 1937. 101 Loc. cit. 102 Loc. cit. 103 Adventures of Ideas (Cambridge, 1947), p. 366. 104 Ibid., p. 367.</page><page sequence="43">whitehead's philosophy 195 mental and physical withdrawal from life- a nirvana. As Hart- shorne rather delicately describes it: "The term 'peace' has a rather technical meaning. It is not the mere absence of strife, in- ternal, industrial or international. It is a genuine immunity to the distractions of fame and fortune, and, in general, the many things which make our lives miserable."105 And while Whitehead adds that Peace requires its opposite, Zest, their union also produces nirvana. "The Adventure of the Universe starts with the dream and reaps tragic Beauty. This is the secret of the Union of Zest with Peace- that the suffering attains its end in a Harmony of Harmonies."106 This withdrawal, this mysticism, signified Whitehead's retreat from the problems of real life. But life, the real world, was with- drawing from Whitehead. His form of objective idealism may be pursued by his disciples, but neither it nor any philosophy of the same type can be any other than a means to justify capitalist so- ciety, a means which must inevitably fail in its aim.
