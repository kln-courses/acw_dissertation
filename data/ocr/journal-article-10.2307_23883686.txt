Using this criterion, a more convincing case for symbolism can be made for engravings found on 270 ostrich eggshell fragments from Diep Figure2.

How ever, the redder ochre is, the higher its iron con tent, and the higher the iron content, the better it makes bone or stone points stick to wooden shafts, as it critically contributes to the homogeneity of the adhesive.69 Moreover, in small-scale societies, red ochre is also used for tanning hides, as an in sect repellent, or for medicinal purposes, although it is unclear whether Pleistocene hunter-gatherers used it as such. Therefore, the selection of red ochre could have been for functional, rather than aesthetic or symbolic, purposes, though one does not exclude the other—there is no way to make it out. The MSA engravings are geometric, mostly consisting of straight lines. Geometric designs are a pervasive element of Paleolithic art. They fea ture on most of the Swabian figurines and are found alongside many animal paintings in Franco Cantabrian cave art.70 Did straight lines appeal aesthetically to Paleolithic people, as they did to more recent artists like Mondrian or Malevich? According to Hodgson, the pervasiveness of geo metric motifs across human cultures from the ear liest art onward can be explained by the fact that such designs evoke strong responses in our early visual system.71 Orientation-selective cells in the primary visual cortex (area VI) respond strongly to straight lines, especially horizontal and verti cal ones.72 Does the fact that geometric designs appeal aesthetically to us imply that the MSA engraved objects were intended to be aestheti cally pleasing? After all, some of the regular geo metric designs on younger African artifacts have been interpreted as calendar notation systems.73 In those cases, notches are grouped into sets that have some numerical correspondence to lunar cy cles or other seasonally recurring events.74 The older MSA material does not show this system atic grouping, making a notational interpretation unlikely. It seems reasonable to infer an intended aesthetic value for the Diepkloof ostrich eggshells, especially given that the geometric designs show a high degree of standardization, being stably re produced for long periods of time. The Biombos material is more idiosyncratic: if it appealed aes thetically to its engravers, this did not lead to a widespread adoption of designs in the community. What guides our spontaneous recognition of some Paleolithic artifacts as artworks? A cognitive approach allows for a relatively fine-grained con ceptual analysis of artworks. Because it does not require culture-specific contextual information, it can be extended to the study of first art. Underly ing our ability to recognize art are three cognitive abilities: design stance, symbol-mindedness, and aesthetic sensitivity. By conceiving art as an abil ity that is present in all neurologically healthy hu mans, it is possible to trace continuities between early artworks and art today. In this context, it is meaningful to say that the Swabian ivory sculp tures and perhaps also the more elaborate among the southern African engraved objects, especially the decorated eggshell flasks from Diepkloof, are artworks.75 JOHAN DE SMEDT Department of Philosophy and Ethics Ghent University 9000 Ghent, Belgium internet: Johan.DeSmedt@ugent.be HELEN DE CRUZ Centre for Logic and Analytic Philosophy Katholieke Universiteit Leuven 3000 Leuven, Belgium internet: helen.decruz@hiw.kuleuven.be 1.

In archaeology, it is the standard way to specify dates in the past. 'Present' ac tually refers to 1950, roughly the beginning of radiocarbon dating. 3. For example, Nicholas J.

In using developmental studies, we do not mean to imply that Paleolithic artists were like children. Rather, the results of developmental psychology point to stable features of human cognition that robustly arise early in development. 23. This refers to the subdiscipline of archaeology that seeks to identify thought processes and cognitive abilities of past peoples from their material culture. 24.
