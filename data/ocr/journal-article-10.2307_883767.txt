George Hersey has grasped the echinus of Classical architecture, a courageous act for someone who realises that an 'echinus' is really a hedgehog or sea-urchin. His courage comes from his urge to tackle the important question, 'Why do architects still erect columns and temple fronts derived ultimately from ancient Greek temples, when ancient Greek religion has been dead for centuries . . .?' His answer is founded on his belief that the ancients 'at a certain point saw their temples as assemblages of the materials, including food, used in sac- rifice' and that 'the rules for the orders, as taboos, partake of the obsession with body parts that runs through pagan sacrifice'. It is on this basis that he goes on to relate the Vitruvian myths of the anthropomorphic origins of the orders to Greek rituals in- volving human sacrifice and the treatment of prisoners of war, and then does the same with the Roman writer's stories about the invention of such substitutes for columns as Caryatids and Persians. Up to this point the book is a heady mixture of philology and phantasy. Words like 'echinus' 'metope' etc., which form the basis of Greek archi- tectural terminology, are first studied in terms of their original meaning and then become the subject of inventive 'tropes' or puns. In the second half, which deals with the renaissance, the theme is again the assimilation of the figure to the column, but the dictionary and the 'trope' are now replaced as the principal aids to enquiry by illustrations in manuscripts and printed books. The anthropomorphic interests of Francesco di Giorgio and Michelangelo are accordingly dealt with in some detail, with particular attention being paid to the herms and captives of the Julius tomb. There follow substantial analyses of Cesariano, who is revealed as one of the most articulate thinkers on the subject of the column as figure and the figure as column, and of Cesariano's successors, of the Vitruvius Teutsch and ofHugues Sambin. As a study of the relation between man and the column this section is unrivalled. Finally, a conclud- ing chapter, which for the first time con- centrates on real buildings, brings a per- ceptive comparison between Washington's Mount Vernon and a modern house by Robert Venturi, in both of which taboos and pediments are significantly broken. It is hard to evaluate this ambitious book. Hersey's idea of recovering the original meaning of ancient architecture through a study of its descriptive terminology is challenging and extremely useful, but his project is substantially flawed by his indul- gence in literary 'troping', of which he says: 'It is playful and poetic, not scientific, and it is often etymologically incorrect. But it is unquestionably the way the ancients, in- cluding Vitruvius and his contemporaries, thought about words'. While this may be true of Greek and Roman dinner-table conversation, it is certainly not a fair de- scription of the use of words by the builders of the first Greek temples. If they identified an element as an 'echinus', a hedgehog or sea-urchin, they were hardly being playful. Rather they were in deadly earnest, as Hersey himself admits when he for once exposes himself to such buildings' power. In a chillingly persuasive passage he says of the temples erected at Paestum by the Greek invaders of Italy: 'these columns ... resemble files of gigantic warriors march- ing ashore, armed and menacing, bearing aloft their weapons and supplies'. The Greek temple was, evidently, not a sacri- ficial assemblage, but a military formation, and the spiny echinus was not a bizarre offering, but an element in the hoplite's brutal armoury. Indeed Hersey makes many other observations which show that he sensed the military quality of the ancient orders, even if he could not admit it as a global explanation for their equipment of aggressive 'darts' and 'dentils' (teeth). Again and again this book offers glimpses of truths which are never revealed. Often Hersey seems to stand in his own way, as when he chooses to illustrate his theory of the sacrificial origin of the Greek orders with modern American monuments. It is not that these are inappropriate subjects for the purposes of his study, only that they can hardly tell as much about archaic Greece as can buildings of that period. It is as if Hersey does not really know exactly which period he is writing about. Certainly such a confusion would explain why he proposes a sacrificial interpretation for a group of buildings to which such analysis seems quite inappropriate, when it would have been brilliantly suited to another. For his interpretation is as appropriate to Italian renaissance architecture as it is in- appropriate to ancient Greek. While sac- rificial objects such as paterae and bucrania are exceptionally rare on antique friezes, they are frequent in the renaissance, and indeed often feature in canonical Doric, as Hersey's own illustration from Barbaro's Vitruvius makes clear. Sixteenth-century architects apparently found it natural to give conscious or unconscious expression to a Christian view that Classical architec- ture was associated with the blood sacrifices of paganism. What Hersey does is impose on ancient architecture an interpretation which he has internalised from his experi- ence of renaissance buildings. Without realising it, he thus provides impressive evidence for the preeminence of the visual over the verbal in shaping our understand- ing of architectural meaning. If he had from the beginning given more weight to his visual experience and less to his study of texts and terminology, he might have realised that it was his unconscious mem- ories of the sacrificial entablatures of the renaissance which 'troped' him into his misinterpretation of antiquity.
