Nereids in Archaic and Classical Greek Art. Pp. xx+276; 156 plates. Ann Arbor: University of Michigan Press, 1995. Cased, $52.50. Who and what are Nereids? Are they a homogeneous group? Do they have a recognizable presence in ancient Greek pictures? Are they a subdivision of the genus nymph? Are there any famous individual Nereids? Few conventional handbooks of mythology or iconography answer these questions directly: B.'s book begins by answering the easy ones: they are minor goddesses, associated with the sea, but usually thought to be distinct from nymphs. The most famous individual one is Thetis, the mother of Achilles. From here, the book asks rather wider questions about the function and importance of Nereids, who are present in literature as early as Homer and Hesiod and as late as Eustathius in the twelfth century A.D. They have a quiet but persistent presence in visual representations from the sixth century B.C. onwards: probably their most familiar visual manifestation is as intercolumnar figures on the Nereid Monument in the British Museum. B. wisely confines her discussion to Archaic and Classical Greek art, while signalling the possibility of future work on Etruscan and Roman representations. Nereids are one category in the very large class of supernumerary figures who appear in mythological scenes. They are usually represented simply as female figures, often carrying fish or small dolphins or identified by attributes peculiar to the context in which they appear, or by inscriptions. Some illustrations, such as those of the production of new armour for Achilles, rely on the viewer's knowledge of literary material for the identification of the women carrying the armour as Thetis' sisters. There are some illustrations which have a much more tenuous link with other visual representations and with literature, where identification is more difficult and the role of these female extras is much less evident. B. is concerned to establish a functional connection between the various apparently disparate scenes which will demonstrate that Nereids are to be differentiated from the anthropomorphic wallpaper or picture-frames common in late Archaic and Classical vase-painting. As B. says, the striking thing about Nereids is the wide variety of contexts in which they appear. These include identifiable myth-illustrations such as those related to Thetis and Achilles, the exposure of Andromeda, the Birth of Aphrodite, Herakles' wrestling matches with marine deities, and Theseus' Cretan adventure, but they also include gynaikeion scenes, non-narrative scenes of the marine thiasos, and the Nereid Monument-the tomb of a Lycian ruler-and a small number of fish-plates from the Black Sea region which show the abduction of Europa. The connection B. establishes, on the basis of exploration of the contexts, literary, visual, and those of cult practice, in which Nereids do, and more importantly do not, appear, is one suggested by her title. Nereids are escorts of a specialized kind: they do not appear with the dead on the battlefield, or at weddings, but they are present on the journey to Hades, and in scenes of wedding-preparation or, even more significantly, abduction. In the earliest representations they are, logically enough, the protectors of those foolhardy enough to travel by sea, a dangerous and often lethal process. By gradual extension, they begin to move outside their obvious sphere of influence to protect heroes in dangerous encounters with marine opponents, and eventually travellers on other journeys, largely metaphorical or psychological ones, whether from life to death, often thought of as a journey over water, or through the other states usually now characterized as liminal or transitional ones. Literary evidence, and in particular Euripides' Andromache 1254-68, supports the idea that Nereids can confer immortality, first on Peleus, joining Thetis in the house of her father Nereus, and then the human dead, including, eventually, the Lycian ruler commemorated by the Nereid Monument. B. makes two connections between Nereids and Dionysiac worship. The first argues, following Seaford, for a status similar to that of female followers of Artemis and of Dionysos, both cults which exclude men and classify the female participants as ' wild' women. The second associates the Nereids' immortalizing capacity (they are mentioned in the Orphic Hymns) with those of Dionysiac mystery cults-the marine thiasos as a parallel with the Dionysiac one. Both of these ?

How do those roles connect with their appearances on Roman sarcophagi, or in literature of the early Christian era? University of Glasgow ELIZABETH MOIGNARD D. HAYNES: The Technique of Greek Bronze Statuary. Pp. 156; 15 plates, 9 line drawings. Mainz, Rhein: Philipp von Zabern, 1992. Cased, DM 65. Statues by famous bronze-casters were long considered the glory of Greek art. They were highly praised by critics in antiquity and enthusiastically copied in marble for admiring Romans, but so tempting was the material for reuse that only a handful escaped the melting pot. Not surprisingly, therefore, study of the technique that produced them lagged well behind aesthetic appreciation. Spectacular recent finds, however, have greatly increased the material available and stimulated investigation of and controversy over the techniques involved. This work by the late Denys Haynes, a former keeper of the Department of Greek and Roman Antiquities at the British Museum, is an elegant distillation of a life-time's study. Concise and yet detailed, the book guides the reader systematically through the processes employed. While statuettes can be simply made of solid bronze, statues on a larger scale, which are normally hollow, require more complicated procedures. They can be produced in two ways: either by hammering sheet bronze or by casting molten metal. The earliest large-scale Greek bronzes were hammered (sphyrelata) and H. begins with them. By the middle of the 6th century B.C., however, the Greeks had found a way to hollow-cast large statues, and hammering became restricted to the vase-makers and armourers whose techniques had been drawn upon to make sphyrelata. Mastery of hollow-casting enabled the Greeks to produce their most celebrated and innovative creations. H. therefore devotes much of his book to discussing the origin and development of the indirect lost wax process, which provided the technical means for these achievements. He does not immediately state his own theory-namely that Rhoecus and Theodorus invented piece-moulds which enabled large bronze statues to be hollow-cast in sections-but instead enumerates all possible modes of casting and eliminates those which are inconsistent with the evidence of surviving statues or the materials available in antiquity. His arguments rest on well- documented current and post-antique practice, coupled with close inspection of ancient bronzes. H. begins his survey of bronze-casting with an analysis of the technical options, and then turns to the question of the sculptor's model. A number of scholars maintained that it was made of wood, but H. persuasively argues that it was normally clay, a material that encourages the experimentation so characteristic of classical Greek art. He then chronicles the intricate steps required for piece-moulding and casting and describes the casting pit and melting furnaces. Next he discusses various alloys and gives a clear exposition of the consequences to the colour, malleability and propensity to crack on cooling which result from the addition of different proportions of tin or lead to the basic copper. He concludes by explaining the final touches required after casting, including finishing, joining, patching, and mounting, preparing and inserting the eyes and attaching copper inlays for nipples and lips. The book is a tour de force of brevity and clarity, qualities increasingly revealed by repeated readings. Profusely documented, the book contains some 38 pages of notes and 16 of bibliography. Unfortunately only 15 photographs and nine line drawings accompany the text. Although each is well chosen and illuminating, the book would certainly have been easier to understand and more accessible to a lay audience had it been more generously illustrated. A number of explanatory diagrams would have been particularly welcome in the earlier sections. By intelligently combining astute observation with critical reasoning, H. succeeds in covering virtually all aspects of his subject, from the first creation of a model through the extreme delicacy of those final touches that brought a Greek bronze statue to that state of perfection that has called forth admiration throughout the ages.
