<plain_text><page sequence="1">Animality is at the core of much of Rachel Rosenthal's performance art and painting. Looking to the work of Rosenthal (as well as Plato, Shakespeare, Rauschenberg, and others), this essay is an attempt to understand the intricate relationships among the artist, the animal, the audience, and the notion of performance itself. Rachel Rosenthal Is an Animal H. PETER STEEVES AUTHOR: first love, The first animal being. This is first first philosophy, part is to be first read performer, aloud. first image, first sound, AUTHOR: first love, first being. This first part is to be read aloud. ROSENTHAL: (Stands) "Communicate! Communicate! My deep preference is always to chuck it all and go live with the animals in the bosom of the Earth. I keep putting it off in order to perform pieces that bring the Earth into conscious focus" ( Rachel 196). AUTHOR: We're grateful for deep lack of freedom. Procrastination in a myopic world.

KAFKA: (Rising) "A parable: Leopards break into the temple and drink the sacrificial vessels dry; this is repeated over and over again; finally it can be calculated in advance and becomes a part of the ceremony" ( Collected 7). (Cue leopards.) In the fall of 1980 Rachel Rosenthal began performing with a rat. Tatti Wattles - in Bonsoir, Dr. Schön!, riding on Rosenthal's head, tangled in her still-present hair - took to the stage as if he had been born for it. He was soon a star. Rosenthal, for her part - and as always - put on a show. At one point, she detonated little fireworks, spun, yelled, and screamed: "I am a vampire!" And in the panic of the performance, Tatti left his nest of hair, slid down Rosenthal's face - claws marking and tearing her cheek, blood streaking to her neck - and settled on her shoulder. His work quick and true, the rat made of Rosenthal a bloody beautiful human-rodent hybrid, eine schöne Fledermaus , transforming her before the audience and giving her wings. ROSENTHAL: "Tatti had a good sense of timing [...]. [He] had a great stage presence [...]. He loved being in the limelight and never hid or presented his backside. All the photos show him, handsome, looking directly into the camera. In performance, he always knew where his light was" ( Tatti 37, 50). ( She tosses the cabbage back into the PIT. ) In later versions of the production, Rosenthal would construct a miniature bat costume for Tatti and swing him through the air. They were vampires together in those years. When Nicholas Ridout recalls how he once saw a mouse cautiously and appar- ently improvisationally make an entrance from downstage left in a London theatre's production of Harold Pinter's The Caretaker , he uses it as an opportunity to think through how worries about animal exploitation in the theatre point to the real exploitation of the human actor on stage. "The theatre is all about humans coming face [to face] with other humans and either liking it or not liking it," explains Ridout. "The animal clearly has no place in such communication [...]. It should not be there because it does not know what to do there, is not capable of performing theatrically by engaging a human audience in experimental thinking about the conditions of their own humanity [. . .]" (58). The rodent, for Ridout, is a sign. Though he struggles to "let</page><page sequence="3">H. Peter Steeves 3 1. Martin Cohen. "Rachel Rosenthal in her studio with Cagney," 2005; photograph (courtesy Rachel Rosenthal). the animal be" and not "commit the act of violence of putting it on stage as a sign" (61 ), its exploitation is, inevitably, but a symbol for the human actor's exploitation on stage. Forced to speak the playwright's words, forced to contort her body according to the director's desire, forced to make her work invisible so the paying audience sees only the "play" (i.e., fun, joy, recreation, amusement) rather than the labour, the human actor is exploited, and the animal points to this in its own miserable presence on stage. This, then, is one of the fascinating and transcendent aspects of Rosenthal's work: she will have none of it. Not that Rosenthal is not worried about human exploitation in the arts. She has, time and again, fought for sweeping political and cultural changes such that artists could be "truly sustained by an economic structure that regards art making as integral and indispensable to the health of the people"; and she has gained national notoriety as an activist for human artists as well as nonhuman animals, having appeared before a 1991 House subcommittee to deliver for Congressional record her denouncement of the NEA's decency clause ( Rachel 199). One knows of Rosenthal's raging against the economic indecency of having to suffer financially to make art in a capitalist society in the first place; but one imagines her less inclined to see the artist as especially exploited. The stage, for Rosenthal, is not teleologically a product, though it is a place of produc-</page><page sequence="4">4 Mosaic 39/4 (December 2006) tion. Art, even trapped as it is - as all things necessarily are - in the political and eco- nomic contexts of its production, is revolutionary and potentially transformative. Not in a naïve sense of creating paradise ex nihilo, but in a postmodern sense of exposing the aesthetic artifice, admitting to its role in the production of that artifice, and envisioning something other. Still, one wouldn't wish to put words in Rosenthal's mouth. ROSENTHAL: ( Suspicious ; mutters inaudibly) Instead, let us say that, for Rosenthal, the animal surely has a central place in com- munication, and a central and indispensable method for getting an audience to think experimentally about its humanity - and its animality. Aesthetically, this is accom- plished with grace and beauty. Ethically (as if there is a difference), it is accomplished with questions of justice at the forefront. AUTHOR: Metaphysically - let us abandon all false distinctions at once! - it is accomplished with the realization that animal Others are not signs, not there-for-us, not truly Other even in their being named as such. There is no justification for our most trusted distinctions. ROSENTHAL: "There is no justification for our persecution of the Others. We do it because we are stronger. This democracy, like every other human society, is erected on the fascist oppression of other sentient beings, because they are other and we have might" ("Others" 106). AUTHOR: The ethic of "might makes right" is always functioning and always in need of questioning. After Foucault, too long in the pit, we know that Reason is Power, and even those who demand equal consideration of animals are already complicit, already merely hoping to gain the authority and command and strength, as it were, to make the audience see that animals matter. Language, even, can be a whip. We must admit to it. And then we must do better. ROSENTHAL: "'If might makes right,' then we have done away with morality alto- gether and, as a species, are morally bankrupt" ("Others" 106). ( She jumps into the PIT. ) "Might makes right" is not a bad ethic; it is the abandonment of morality itself, a forsak- ing of the debate on what constitutes justice in the first place. And all art, therefore, that employs an animal as a symbol of exploitation is always already exploitative. This is something Rosenthal comes back to over and again in her work. So many others do not. Think of Robert Rauschenberg's Monogram (1955-59), a stuffed dead angora goat with a tire around his waist, standing on hinged and painted wood that has been dec-</page><page sequence="5">H. Peter Steeves 5 orated with a tennis ball, paint, collage, and newspaper. The debate that raged - and perhaps still rages - was "What does the goat mean7" Some saw a postmodern Pan; some saw an organic digester of human trash. Robert Hughes insisted that the work was an homage to "male homosexual love in modern culture, [. . .] an image of anal sex [. . .] ." That horny goat head bursting through the opening of the constricting black tire? "The satyr in the sphincter," demanded Hughes. Rauschenberg, characteristically, wanted the art to be about nothing other than itself. Dismissing Hughes's analysis, Rauschenberg claimed: "A stuffed goat is special in the way that a stuffed goat is spe- cial" (qtd. in Baker, Postmodern 80). Steve Baker sees this as a quintessential postmod- ern animal appearance in art: the animal that is not a sign or a symbol, but merely a thing. "Humans," he writes, "have typically wanted [animals] [. . .] to be meaningful, and want [ed] to control and be consoled by those meanings. Postmodernism mistrusts this comfortably centered self's desire [...]. [T]he postmodern animal is there in the gallery not as a meaning or a symbol but in all its pressing thingness" (82). And yet if we follow Baker and his Heideggerian desire to "let the animal be" - poor-in-world as the animal is - are we not forcing the animal's identity, are we not constructing for it an unbending role, the role of a thing? Is this not exactly what a postmodern mistrust of identity should help us avoid? An animal's "thingness" is not pressing; "thingness" is something that is pressed upon the animal. Let us say that Shakespeare's Bottom is a modern ass. He is, typically, read as a symbol of buffoonery, stupidity, and crude animal body - symbols and signs we hope to control, meanings we think are stable and exhaustibly definable. Mufasa in Disney's The Lion King (1994) and the tigers in the Ringling Brothers Circus are also typically read with a modern lens: the animal before us means something in its animality, it stands for something, is an allegory or a code: it is there for us (which exhausts its being) and means something for us (which exhausts its meaning). What passes for postmodern animals in art, though, are seldom truly postmodern. Rauschenberg's reading of his own piece, and Baker's reading of that reading, are modernist denials that there is a context that comes attached to all production. In further reifying the animal - and note importantly here, a dead animal, killed and stuffed and put on dis- play - so that it is claimed to be merely a thing, all possible further meanings and all possible subjectivity are immediately denied. This is, in fact, the epitome rather than the transcendence of modernity's error: a stable identity is suddenly set for the ani- mal in the art - "What does it mean? It means itself, and thaťs all And thaťs exactly what it means" The truly postmodern animal is neither paraded on stage as a naïve symbol in some human fable, nor is it placed before us as if it could possibly mean nothing, as if the artist is somehow beyond or outside the web of culture, language,</page><page sequence="6">6 Mosaic 39/4 (December 2006) symbol, etc. that makes the appearance of art possible. Modernism perhaps begins by ignoring its own immersion in context, but it is a modernist mind that still thinks it can identify that context, rise above it so that it is no longer immersed in context, and show us the bird's eye view of the things-in-themselves. Postmodernity is, in part, marked by the awareness of the context and of one's own complicity in perpetuating the very structures that gave rise to it. What folly to think that a dead, stuffed goat does not necessarily mean myriad things, not the least of which is that the animal is there for us to kill and manipulate and consume. Ralph Ortiz decapitating live chickens on stage and Peter Brook burning a live butterfly before an audience do not raise ques- tions about what is real, what is the symbol, what is the animal, what is the nature of power, what is performance, and so on (see e.g., Kirby 12-13). They are the worst final throes of modernism: a modernism that actively and knowingly denies its own moder- nity; not a questioning of the animal and a nullification of the animal's meaning, but, in fact, a tacit assumption of the worst sorts of clichés about animals. Rosenthal and her nonhuman performing partners are always and utterly differ- ent. Tatti Wattles was not a trained rat doing tricks. Tatti Wattles was not put on stage as a sign for human disgust or fear. Tatti Wattles was not presented as meaning noth- ing, as a thing, as "a rat." Instead, Tatti Wattles was acknowledged as animal, as human, as vermin, as rodent, as friend, as lover, as a ham, as feared, as fearful, as brave, as cre- ative, as Rachel, as Tatti, as performer. In her landmark show The Others (1984), forty- two nonhuman animals shared the stage and the playbill with Rosenthal. Goats, snakes, rabbits, squirrels, monkeys, turkeys, macaws, dogs, cats, rats Each animal had a printed bio; each animal was presented and named during the show; each animal appeared not as a symbol for its kind nor as a blank slate on which Rosenthal and her audience could write, but as equals, as performers, as co-constitutors of this art and this world. The call was for animal rights - the call clear and loud, as Rosenthal attacked the way we control, tor- ture, and murder animals with our language, our hearts, and our hands. But any pos- sibility of a cartoonish sentimental plea was eradicated by the co-constitution of the performance by Rosenthal and the nonhuman actors. This was not Noah's stage; Rosenthal was not parading the animals before us as captor and saviour. This was not a modernist's stage; Zato the dog did not mean Domestication or Obedience when he took his turn in the spotlight (and yet, of course, he brought such meanings with him to his performance, twisting them in new ways, yet twisting them not as something he represents but as something we are called on to question in our representation of him). The stage was neither the prelude to the abattoir nor the tabula rasa of heaven, but rather Here, Earth, Community. It was not, that is to say, Ridout's stage: a place-</page><page sequence="7">H. Peter Steeves 7 less place that "rigorously excludes nature [. . .] [and] stays where it is, in the city. [A 'place' where] no natural light comes in, [. . .] [where] there is culture raised to the power of two, as temporary floors and walls simulate the rooms of our own homes and other built spaces [...]. Bringing an animal in here is courting disaster" (58-59). AUTHOR: When her stage lowers and rises, when Rosenthal ascends and descends dais and mechanical orchestra pit, surrounded by human and animal life, . . . (ROSEN- THAL springs out of the PIT and climbs to sit on the highest PLATFORM) . . . when the artifice of the stage is made apparent and the traditions of theatre are acknowledged, not denied, not transcended, we know that she is telling the truth: the stage is real and is never separate from the Earth. Even at the end, in the cliche of the blackout. (BLACKOUT followed after several seconds by a TIGHT SPOT on the PIT that grows wider to encompass whole CAST. ) ROSENTHAL: "To be enlightened, we have need of darkness. They, the Others, can never be enlightened, for they have never fallen from grace" ("Others" 105). This is the real world. What else could it be? The tear cried on stage is a real tear. What else could it be? After their performance, the dogs and cats from the local shelter that had been on Rosenthal s stage were put up for adoption. Audience members went home with new family members, Others made otherwise. Was the adoption process after the blackout still part of the performance? Did Rachel the artist perform the matchmaking or did dogs and cats find human homes only off the stage? Is this activism? Is it art? Our false distinctions have us chasing our tails to the grave. We think that animals can't be smart enough to act. All performance must be a cruel trick. We think that the light of reason does not shine in small cabbages. We tell a story about our own Fall, a story that so often exists only to set up the narrative of our rise to dominance. But this is not true Grace, a truly infinite love, mercy, accom- modation, and decency. Rosenthal's body moves with the grace of a dancer in liquid light; her animal voice sings to human, animal, and Goddess. She acts like the Book of Acts (a book she will have none of, of course). DESCARTES: (From offstage) "The community of believers was of one heart and mind, and no one claimed that any of his possessions was his own, but they had every- thing in common [. . .]. There was no needy person among them, for those who owned property or houses would sell them, bring the proceeds of the sale [. . .] and they were distributed to each according to need" (Acts 4: 32-33).</page><page sequence="8">8 Mosaic 39/4 (December 2006) Could Tatti act? The assumption is not merely that animals are too unenlightened to understand narrative and the realm of the aesthetic, but that, having no access to truth, they are therefore incapable of lying. And acting, so goes the ill-formed thought, is a lie. Composer and performance artist Laurie Anderson recalls hiring a dog wrangler to bring some angry-acting canines to her loft so that she could film the dogs for an accompaniment to a song she was recording. The trainer promised "'They re vicious! Really vicious!' But he could only get them into attack mode for a few seconds at a time before they began to smile those happy dog smiles they've all got. That's what I love about dogs," concludes Anderson, "they're such lousy actors" (qtd. in Williams 35). Rosenthal performs with animals who share a life with her. She has friends bring animals from their homes as well. Everyone knows everyone else. No wranglers or trainers, no paid strangers are hired. No money is exchanged for tricks that are taught and reproduced. And Rosenthal's scripts allow for a sort of freedom that is unprece- dented on the stage. It is a freedom that, rather than let the animal be and rather than force the animal to be something else, allows the humans and animals to become something together. Shakespeare came close but never quite hit his mark. In The Two Gentleman of Verona , Crab the dog often gets the most laughs. On the pages of the script Crab is said to be disobedient and unwilling to take orders; he is not even housebroken. As a mat- ter of necessity, goes the common wisdom, Shakespeare is thought to have written the character as such, that way while the dog "playing" Crab in each production of the play simply goes about his own doggy life, indifferent to the narrative around him, his sup- posed inability to act will not hinder the production. Animals make lousy actors, so write a play in which they needn't lie, needn't act, needn't be something they are not. Michael Dobson goes so far as to say that "Shakespeare finds in Crab's sheer dogginess a superb comic indifference to the claims of the story into which he is dragged, mak- ing him the perfect straight-man (or straight-dog?) to Lance's unavailing emotional claims on him. So far from being a mere function of the plot, Crab is more likely to make the people around him look as though they are the ones doing mere tricks [...]. Crab embodies a giddy Shakespearean freedom" (1 18-19). If, however, we do not look to the author's intention for the meaning of the role (for the author, after all, has - like the rest of us - but one interpretation of that role, and occupies no privileged spot from which to apprehend and announce the true meaning of a work), if instead we merely look at the production itself, are we not forced to say that most dogs who play Crab on stage are in fact performing wonderfully, playing the role exactly as it is writ- ten, taking the author's direction ("be uncompanionable and unhygienic") seriously and then adding their own creative interpretation to that direction?</page><page sequence="9">H. Peter Steeves 9 DESCARTES: (From offstage) Animals have no creativity. They are without mind. They do not belong on stage. Thinking a dog is performing well when he is directed to "Be unhygienic" is like thinking a rock is performing well if its part in the play calls for it to "Stay." Also, this is a terrible philosophy essay. It's not even an essay. ROSENTHAL: (To the audience) "I used to hate a lot [. . .]. René Descartes, the guy who said that the whole Universe was a mechanism. That animals were machines. That you could vivisect them because their screams were just the sounds of gears and springs. Boy did I loathe him!" ("filename" 206). (Rosenthal begins growling like an angry dog then smiles that happy smile she's got.) Jannis Kounellis 's Horses (1969) was an installation of a dozen live horses in an empty wing of the Galleria L'Attico in Rome. Tied facing the walls, the horses ate and defecat- ed - as horses will do - over the days of the installation, apparently not missing the fact that the walls were bare and there was nothing for them to see while in the museum. "Were we missing the art as well?" seemed to be one of the questions being asked. "Or, like the horses, were we actually incapable of seeing art if the presence of the horses was itself the art?" In 1974, Joseph Beuys spent a week in the René Block Gallery in New York City in a chain-link enclosure partitioning his space from the main gallery. Here, he interacted with a live coyote named Little John in a performance entitled Coyote: I Like America and America Likes Me. Little John, for his part, would rip apart The Wall Street Journal that Beuys brought with him, pull - like a dog with one end of a sock - at the blanket in which Beuys wrapped himself, and be threatened with a stick-beating if he got too ferocious or unpredictable. A pair of brown gloves were continuously thrown at the coyote, which, Beuys explains, "represent my hands, and the freedom of movement that human beings possess with their hands [...]. Hands are universal [...]. They are not restricted to one specific use like the talons of an eagle or the mole's diggers. So the throwing of the gloves to Little John meant giving him my hands to play with" (qtd. in Baker, "Sloughing" 73). The horses and the coyote on stage here are not asked to perform, not expected to perform. And as a result, the ethics, aesthetics, and metaphysics become question- able. Like a chain-smoking, tuxedo-wearing chimpanzee forced to make faces in front of an audience or else get a shock, so too are the horses and coyotes of such perform- ances disrespected, manipulated, and controlled when they are not thought actually part of the show, co-stars, co-authors, co-beings on stage. They are mere props, then. Things, machines, mechanisms in a Cartesian sideshow. Leave it to Rosenthal to put the horse before Descartes, to bring the animal and</page><page sequence="10">10 Mosaic 39/4 (December 2006) the human onstage in what is a mutual co-construction of Protean identity and fluid art, in what Williams might call an "inter-subjective encounter," a "delirious and deterritorializing provocation" (36, 38). Of course Tatti Wattles could act. Being is acting. LINGIS: (Lowered from the rafters on a crystal chandelier , he wears a turquoise sarong.) "Sage grouse inhabit the vast plains of the northwestern United States and southern Canada [...]. In late February or early March, the cocks gather in traditional ceremo- nial arenas, on open plains or gentle slopes covered with short grass [...]. They come here from as far as a hundred miles away. The arena is long and narrow; it may be as large as half a mile long and two hundred yards wide. Up to 400 cocks come to per- form there. The performances are held each day in the late afternoon. The performers position themselves thirty feet apart, and dance over an area from sixteen to twenty square yards." ROSENTHAL: (Stage-whisper) "I am becoming less and less inclined to think of myself as making ťarť" ( Rachel 195). LINGIS: "It is the centre of the arena that is the place of greatest prestige, and even- tually the most magnificent performer occupies it [. . .]. Hens first appear at the arena two or three weeks later [...]. As they stroll through the 400 assembled dancers, they pause near a dancer whose performance impresses them. Over the course of days they gravitate to the master cock, who may thus have 50 to 70 hens watching his perform- ance [...]. Once a hen has chosen her lover, and made love with him, she leaves [...]. The cocks do not acknowledge their paternity, and do not assist her in any way." ROSENTHAL: "Oh shit" ("Pangaean" 183). LINGIS: "They are full-time professional performers [...]. [So too] in the eastern forests of Australia perform the satin bowerbirds [...]. [The male] clears a patch of ground of every tiny twig, stem, leaf, and root [...]. He then covers the cleared area with a mat of coarse grasses and twigs [. . .] [where he also] places a collection of objets d'art. He travels far and wide to bring back blue parrot feathers, blue flowers, blue berries, blue beetles, fragments of blue grass, pieces of blue crockery, blue buttons. These decorative objects are laid out in the display area; not one blue object can stray inside the bower. Every day he runs a careful check on his collected objects. If any have lost their colour during the night, flowers wilted or berries shrivelled, they are dis- carded on a garbage dump, far from the stage [...]. The performance is scheduled for dawn [...]. At times he seems to pour harmony from his very soul."</page><page sequence="11">H. Peter Steeves 1 1 DESCARTES: (From offstage) Give me a break. LINGIS: "He imitates the calls of the kookaburra (only the first two bars), the butcher bird, the grating cries of the white cockatee, [. . .] the crow shrike and the magpie, [. . .] the peculiar grunt of the native bear is true to nature. Spotted bower birds imi- tate the cries or calls of eagles, hawks, butcher birds, magpies, [. . .] domestic cat[s]." AUTHOR: They perform comedy. LINGIS: "One spotted bower bird precisely mimicked the sound created by sheep scrambling though a wire fence, [. . .] the whirring of a cicada when held by a bird, [. . .] the distressed croak of a frog when caught by a snake." AUTHOR: Tragedy. ROSENTHAL: "When we hear a bird we are overjoyed. Song birds, like in the old days, are gone, of course. But other birds still do make croaking sounds" ( Rachel 198). LINGIS: "A female who comes to watch stands inside the bower [...]. After making love with their chosen top performer, a female leaves [. . .]. The fathers continue to tend their bowers, embellish them, and vocalize and dance for months after. When the young are raised, the males leave their bowers, and collect in gregarious flocks, until the next theater season." (A Bach fugue plays and LINGIS is raised into the rafters , humming along , waving goodbye.) KAFKA: (Lowering) "I have completed the construction of my burrow and it seems to be successful [...]. I begin once more to dream my dream of a completely perfect burrow and that somewhat calms me; with closed eyes I behold with delight perfect or almost perfect structural devices for enabling me to slip out and in unobserved [. . .]. [T]he smaller rooms, each familiar to me: [. . .] they enclose me more peacefully and warmly than a bird is enclosed in its nest. And all, all still and empty" ("Burrow" 271, 291, 294). All living things - and perhaps nonliving things - perform. Always. We exist in nar- rative, playing communitarian roles, affirming or denying or strengthening or weak- ening the relationships that inflate us to being and constitute us. When the leopards broke into the temple and emptied the sacrificial vessels, who is to say that the notion of incorporating the ransacking into the ceremony came later? Who is to say that the leopards have not been playing their part all along and the artist merely acknowledges their performance and draws attention to it: now it is part of the ceremony; now the</page><page sequence="12">12 Mosaic 39/4 (December 2006) leopards appear on cue to wreck the temple; now everything is - in shambles, destroyed, drunk, and gone - ordered because it is performed, because it is a story. We merely came in late. There is not a moment in life that you and I are not performing. I stand before my students and act out the part of the professor. It is a show. When the lecture is done, the sacrificial vessels dry, the last student gone from the room, I feel the change in me. I drop out of character. My body contorts and shifts, eases and then tightens and repositions. Not to something that is now truly me but to another performer and another show: I walk through the hallway and then through the day as a colleague, as a worker, as a man, as a Midwesterner, as a son, as a worrier, as a failure, as a comedi- an, as a would-be saviour, as a tragic figure, as this and that and the other thing. I practice each part, always standing from the vantage point of yet another character as I rehearse and learn. It is not a lie. It is the necessary structure of being. And I imitate. The Deleuzean conception of "becoming-animal" rather than "being animal" is supposed to keep us from the trap of the production of identity, but it goes astray. Imitation does not need to assume a fixed identity for the thing being imi- tated in order to work. Deleuze and Guatarri condemn imitation, identification, allego- ry, and anthropomorphism. Yet to condemn anthropomorphizing an animal is to think that there is something it definitely means to be human and something it definitely means to be animal and never the two shall meet. A postmodern anthropomorphism is potentially true and good because it realizes the bilateral nature of the projection, the fluidity with which judgments are made and change and are always up for grabs. It is all right to see one's dog as feeling ashamed after he has messed the floor because, in part, we come to have the experience of performing shame ourselves by learning it from the performance of dogs. Humanity itself is a performance. I sleep like a rock, dream like a dog, wake like a whale. I face the day and go about preparing to perform my humanity: I choose the appropriate costume, hairstyle, and smell before going on stage. I put on a suit and tie, trim my beard, and shower. (When Rosenthal shaved her head bald on stage in Leave Her in Naxos [1981] it was not merely an act of identification with the horrors of Auschwitz. It was an act of animality. [The two, of course, are sadly linked.] It was not merely a new beginning for her, a new moment for a heart to grow from the snow and love again, but an act of clearing, of starting over, of going feral.) I act my human- ity all day long. I grunt at other humans, making human noises they anticipate and will understand - different noises from the mooing I do with cows, the whistling I do with birds, the silence in which I sit with rocks. All of this is imitative and echoing. It is performing. And this is what it means to be human.</page><page sequence="13">H. Peter Steeves 1 3 Animality is performance. Performance is found not merely in the strutting of the bowerbird or the chaos of Crab's trodding the boards in all his lack of hygiene. It is in the raccoon who accidentally popped my friend, three-year-old Leah's, inflatable kiddie pool after spending an hour late at night this past summer floating, swimming, and playing with the colourful plastic balls left there from earlier in the day. It is in the mouse, Mr. Jingles, who both frightens and keeps my mother company in her apart- ment when it starts to get cold outside. It is in the lazy self-assurance of iguanas eating rotten mangos in the streets of Venezuela when I lived down there. In the birds who sing at my feeders, the squirrels who plot schemes to get more sunflower seeds for themselves, the rabbits who yearn for pizza crust and turn up their noses at celery tops on my porch. All of these beings are performing, performing their animality and their existence, inhabiting roles and becoming their relationships. It is only performance; and this is what it means to be an animal. ROSENTHAL: "I remember gathering when I was a child in France. In the woods. Berries, mushrooms, lilies of the valley [...]. It was great. Finding something that isn't guaranteed to be there. What a rush!" ("filename" 206). The world is not built for us. And the script is always changing because we are always changing. Recognizing that performance is not something relegated to a stage - or better yet, that the stage is part of the Earth and art is the necessary mode of our exis- tence - Rosenthal casts and co-authors productions with animals without force and without presumption. Knowing that they will be performing at all times, just as she will be, Rosenthal allows animals to be with her in a way that is unprecedented in per- formance art. Or any art, for that matter, for all art needs to be performed. We read the poem aloud in our head to the audience of our many selves; we touch the statue with our eyes and feel it build up in the phenomenological play of presence and absence as we circle around it; we scan the painting in staccato stochastic circadian rhythms, focusing here, focusing there, building up the painting temporally and spatially; we even perform philosophy, rehearse academic arguments, and tend to think in the form of a play. You, READER, performer, human, animal: you know what I mean. Tatti Wattles brings blood to Rosenthal's neck and the moment is ripe with vam- pirism. Did he mean it? Did he perform it? Did she? Even when animals are not present on stage, they are always with Rosenthal. Each performance of Zato (1990) was improvisational, and each performance told the story of Rosenthal's dog, a blind poodle she rescued and named Zatoichi, an echo of the blind swordsman of the same name in Japanese samurai films. Warrior and wan- derer: we are immediately reminded of Homer, too - the blind storyteller of the</page><page sequence="14">14 Mosaic 39/4 (December 2006) west - as Rosenthal begins her performance, the oral account of the odyssey of her hero dog. Deaf, arthritic, epileptic, senile, and incontinent as well as blind, Zato, Rosenthal tells us, "tried to be a dog [...]. He knew he didn't have the knack." Canis familiaris, like Homo sapiens , is a performance: bark at the right time, wag the tail in a way that is understood, love and learn and live like a dog in order to be a dog. It is, as the char- acter's name implies, a familiar and familial performance to be a dog star. Domestication - for humans and for nonhumans - is merely a form of rehearsal, and most dogs are Method actors. Zato tried to be a dog. And even in his failure to be a dog, he helped expand the description of what it means to be a dog: it is a contradic- tion only to a metaphysic that demands stable, finite identity. Zato's heart, we learn, was enlarged ("too much loving, perhaps"); he walked in circles and pushed his head against walls as if they would crumble against the force of one sick dog's skull. Zato and Rosenthal performed/lived/existed together: they slept together, woke up together, urinated together. He took away her freedom and, in dying, liberated her: it is a contradiction only to an ethic that demands finite, calcu- lable duty. Rosenthal, the hero who will not euthanize a happy dog no matter how her own suffering grows, is no mere maiden in distress. "Kill me!" she screams. "Not the dog." But this part Zato could play and write: the warrior who wanders in, saves the girl, lib- erates with his heart, and dies "easy, simple, and brave." As the performance unfolds, when Rosenthal speaks of Zato she does more than speak. She shows us the limits of speech, turning - as she must in order to convey truth - to the flesh, to song, and to silence. She turns to Zato. To say that she becomes Zato on stage is to fail to capture the point: she is Rosenthal and she is Zato and she is more. This becoming-animal is not some Disneyfied mockery, and yet it is more than a Deleuzean daydream. Rosenthal is not on all fours barking before us with a pink - or white - panting tongue, as if mockery and mimicry were the same thing. And yet Zato is present in her every move. Zato, in his absence, is of her present flesh, her voice that becomes a sweet dog-howl in song in order to express love unutterable by humans. These are the limits of language and the blurry boundary of the aesthet- ic: emotion and torment and indecision personified in cried gibberish after she learns that the dog who demands her constant care and attention is not dying and will like- ly live another year; the horror of the puddle-of-pee repeated - the puddle! the pud- dle! the puddle! the puddle! - in every way until any meaning of the word "puddle" is gone and there is only the felt sense of mutual frustration; the growing realization reflected in the growing intensity of her precise pronunciation that she is no more</page><page sequence="15">H. Peter Steeves 1 5 special than Zato though she alone, she is told, possesses logos and makes art; the silence that hangs at the end marking the death of the warrior, the space between despair and relief, life and death, presence and absence. This space is not an empty space on Rosenthal's stage. Like the space between words, it is responsible for all meaning: without silence there is no communication. And without the animal, no Rosenthal, no performance, no art, no hope for us all. AUTHOR: We are using words to talk about words. It is a form of narcissism - reflex- ive, human, blinding us to the Others not in the mirror. And it is a recipe for failure. Like screaming to make a child be quiet, or killing to stop a war. (ROSENTHAL becomes KOKO the gorilla and climbs down from her platform. DESCARTES enters dressed in modern scientist clothes and plays the role of her TRAIN- ER. The AUTHOR cracks a whip and DESCARTES jumps nervously ; it is clear that DESCARTES is being forced into this, that he is being trained as well as training. KOKO jumps into the PIT, discovers the cabbage , and sits on the edge of the PIT, nibbling at the cabbage as she begins to speak.) KOKO: "Koko wants to tell about the sky, the food, the playing, and the breaking of branches. She wants people to know about the feelings of a fine animal who loves life. Everything is sensuous and important [...]. Hard to remember to say things in small pieces [...]. TRAINER: One last time, Koko, this is the good one. To be or not to be, I think there- fore I am. KOKO: (Chuckling and scratching herself) I am my beard s friend, my nipples' friend, my big belly's friend. And I like all these parts tickled, fondled, and hugged. Moments ever new, surprising, nurturing, dependable. I know and trust they'll be there. So I abandon myself and drift, tenderly rocked as I navigate among the branches, feeling the tug of the Mother in my gut. (She mimes hanging and swinging gently from a branch, her eyes closed, ecstatic. She comes to, sits on the platform, signs correctly. ) To be or not to be, I think therefore I am. TRAINER: You got it, Koko! Good girl! Smart gorilla! KOKO: (Yawns) Gorilla sleepy [. . .]" ("Rachel's" 129-30). AUTHOR: "We communicate with other human beings through language. Most of our relations with animals are therefore based on attempts to teach them words, for</page><page sequence="16">16 Mosaic 39/4 (December 2006) the most part 'commands': 'Sit!,' 'Stay!,' 'Heel!/ 'Whoa!,' 'Giddyup!,' etc. We get impa- tient and angry when animals don't 'understand,' and we think them bad, stupid, or in need of more training. We seldom consider learning their language" ( Tatti 28). (The lights dim and everyone finds a place to lie down on stage to take a nap. Jungle sounds play softly in the background. Everyone sleeps. From the back of the theatre SOCRATES enters. He makes his way through the audience and toward the stage. He seems ready to give a speech , but no one is awake to hear him , so he is disappointed. He kicks the AUTHOR lightly with his sandaled foot to wake him and looks away. He does it again with a bit more force, and the AUTHOR speaks , apparently dreaming and still fully asleep.) AUTHOR: Just a few more pages. I'm almost done. (SOCRATES, disgruntledy kicks the AUTHOR firmly in the crotch. The AUTHORy who will now play the role of PHAEDRUS, screams and jumps up. SOCRATES is looking the other way, pretending not to have done anything. ) SOCRATES: Oh, say, Phaedrus. Is that you? PHAEDRUS: What? I . . . Oh. It's you. Yeah. Yes. It's me, Phaedrus. Pray tell me Socrates, whence come you and whither are you going? SOCRATES: I come from my walk outside the walls of the city zoo, and I am going to the grave, sweet boy, and then to immortality; but first to the theatre. I'm off to see Painting is Hell by Irosenthal of Gaul. They say she offends the gods, speaks with animals, and has a head as smooth as the lower cheeks of Venus. I plan to heckle her loudly. PHAEDRUS: I don't see the point. SOCRATES: She will. PHAEDRUS: Sometimes I fear you have no soul, Socrates. By the gods, you are mean. SOCRATES: You jest, boy. Now tell me what you thought of Irosenthal's show. Did you find the performance inspired and the paintings inspiring? Recount to me in every detail how the spectacle unfolded and tell me what you made of it so that I can, myself, be better prepared and know when best it will be to dislodge these rotten tomatoes I have hidden beneath my robes and thus make my point heard on her stage. PHAEDRUS: Nothing would please me less, Socrates, but I have not seen the show. I've been writing lately and have been busy at home.</page><page sequence="17">H. Peter Steeves 1 7 SOCRATES: I would have believed your every word and left you here to your own misguided reverie had I not seen the playbill from the show there tucked in your pack on the ground. So tell me of the performance and of the evening you had. Start with what you wore, end with what you did at home later that night, and leave nothing out in between. PHAEDRUS: Ah, you are too nosey for me to practice my art on you. Shall we speak, then, of the nature of the soul and the horses and charioteer that comprise it? SOCRATES: I love you, Phaedrus, but you really shouldn't take me so literally. Half of this stuff I'm just pulling out of my . . . PHAEDRUS: Literally or literarily, Socrates? Aren't most distinctions questions of convenience? I think you miss the point. Irosenthal is an artist, and her work is con- stantly questioning distinctions, rejecting violence, showing as well as saying. I have written a commentary on Painting is Hell Here, let me share some of it with you. SOCRATES: You know, Phaedrus, writing shares a strange feature with painting. The off-springs of painting stand there as if they are alive, but if anyone asks them any- thing, they remain solemnly silent. The same is true of written words. You'd think they were speaking as if they had some understanding, but if you question anything that has been said because you want to learn more, it continues to signify just that very same thing forever. When it has once been written down, every discourse roams about everywhere, reaching indiscriminately those with understanding no less than those who have no business with it, and it doesn't know to whom it should speak and to whom it should not. And when it is faulted and attacked unfairly, it always needs its father's support; alone, it can neither defend itself nor come to its own support. PHAEDRUS: Its mother should have taught it not to speak to strangers. SOCRATES: Hmm? PHAEDRUS: Or perhaps forcing others to listen and to talk back is really merely put- ting words in their mouths. But listen: painting is not silent. It is more like a dialogue. The trainer writes words in the air with Koko's hands; he writes in monologue for her. But Irosenthal - when she is becoming-gorilla she has more to say, more truth to reveal without logos than we ever seem able to muster. Irosenthal, alone on stage, dialogues. SOCRATES: Madness! How I look forward to seeing this for myself. (His hand disap- pears as he reaches for the tomatoes beneath his tunic) Rotten! Oh! You really have my</page><page sequence="18">18 Mosaic 39/4 (December 2006) juices flowing now. Tell me, please dear Phaedrus, about her latest performance; tell me of Painting is Hell and don't make me beg again. PHAEDRUS: First, you should know that she says it is not a performance. She's retired, you know. She smiles and says - while on stage, mind you - that she is not performing. In fact, the audience is told that this is to be a "reality show." SOCRATES: Like "Survivor: Thrace"? PHAEDRUS: Stay with me, Socrates. She is making a point about how reality is always already a show. When she tells everyone that this is the story of how she "transitioned" from performer to painter, she is performing. The script is referring to itself - though she also tells us that there is no written script, and I'm inclined to believe her. The stage is essentially barren as Irosenthal explains that she is going to tell us about her becoming-painter journey. Gilah, the painting mentor, is introduced. She will be cri- tiquing the artist's work just as she does in her home studio. For the first time, we, the audience, will witness such a session and thereby purportedly gain insight into IrosenthaTs work and her life. SOCRATES: I see. PHAEDRUS: A slide comes up on the large screen on stage. An image of one of IrosenthaTs paintings - one of dozens that will be projected during the show, nearly all of them a painting of a dog. SOCRATES: What a waste! Exquisite! PHAEDRUS: Indeed, they are exquisite. The colours are vibrant and primary, pastel and earthy, sweet and evocative. She begins with an early work - something with "Identity" in the title, I recall. In the centre there is a little brown-and-white dog, sketched in only the quickest outline, mere points for eyes and nose, yet wholly there, his tail wagging and his haunches trembling. He is frightened yet bravely facing his per- formance - that is to say his being, his life. He stands in water - on water - light blue and white. On either side there is earth, soil, land, cave, solidity: brown. These patches of cave-dark-brown have ethereal female outlines drawn on them, nude women in pink and orange. (And will it surprise you, Socrates, to learn that the "costume" Irosenthal uses on stage is a pink blouse, covered with an orange-red shirt, covered with a brown- black vest, with orange pants? She is there, materialized from the first painting she shows us!) The pink and orange figures' limbs are elongated and graceful (with feet still planted below), as if prehistoric paintings on the wall. The setting, we know, is primal.</page><page sequence="19">H. Peter Steeves 1 9 2. Rachel Rosenthal. "Identity," 2004; oil on canvas, 48 x 60" (courtesy Rachel Rosenthal). In the center, where the patches of curved-brown rise up and meet like buttocks, there is a gray diamond - a void, a vulva, the eternal cavity-abyss and emptiness from which all things emerge and come into being. The pup has just been born, the Ur-creature of the universe fallen to the earth. His birth was unexpected and askew (the off-center Y of blood leaking into the world tells us this), but he is strong. There are rocks and wood to offer him a home, streaks of green on the horizon to offer him hope. And the Mother is miraculously full again, new water to break, a little seed growing in her sky-womb: company, soon, for the First Dog. But now, here, alone, small, and strong, he will make us all possible, make who we are possible. It was amazing, Socrates. SOCRATES: Yes, well ... . PHAEDRUS: Gilah critiques the work, speaking only of mechanics, weight, and bal- ance. "You have a blue problem," she says. (A SLIDE appears, projected on the screen on stage) wtIn those difficult times, Tatti seemed to be my only link to life I said his name and he clucked back. This scanty dialogue was enough to anchor me when it seemed the ground had shifted danger- ously under my feet.' - Rachel Rosenthal" (Tatti 40-41).</page><page sequence="20">20 Mosaic 39/4 (December 2006) (SLIDES of stills from various ROSENTHAL productions now begin to show in rapid succession over the course of three or four minutes. They conclude with a SLIDE of ROSENTHAL in Painting is Hell (2004). PHAEDRUS watches the SLIDES but SOCRATES seems oblivious.) PHAEDRUS: Irosenthal tells us that her only problem now is that she has a carpet of dogs in her studio and it makes it hard to paint. Things are a chaotic mess. "The dogs come into the studio one colour and they leave another," she remarks. SOCRATES: You mean she literally paints her dogs? PHAEDRUS: Literarily. Now pay attention because this next part you are going to like. A dog comes onto the stage. SOCRATES: (lumping up and down excitedly) Then it's true! Oh, the folly! PHAEDRUS: His name is Cagney. He enters with a human named Tad, and the two dance and sing. Cagney is spun on his back on the floor, breakdancing, and then is nestled in the arms of Tad while they ballroom dance across the stage. SOCRATES: I can barely contain this joy, sweet Phaedrus. The hound has a human name? And his passivity and manipulation are taken for true dancing? PHAEDRUS: That he does and that it is. And it is, further, some of the finest stage dancing I have seen. At any rate, the slides continue to flash on the screen, Gilah con- tinues to no avail to engage Irosenthal in discussion about her art, and dogs continue to make their appearance on the stage, each one being named by the artist along with the dog's human companion. As the dogs increase in number - one, two, a dozen, two-dozen - the audience is taken over by huge fits of laughter. SOCRATES: Ah, so the people of Athens are not seduced after all, but see this debacle for what it is. PHAEDRUS: On the contrary. They laugh not because it is unserious, but because it is the opposite of tragedy. Sasha the dog, for instance, makes his appearance and com- mands the stage; and the audience is in awe of his beauty. SOCRATES: This is my point, dear boy. There are relations among things, yes, but there are clear boundaries between what is good and evil, what is true and false, what is this and that. A dog - even a handsome dog named Sasha - is not to be accorded such laurels. He is but a shadow of the true Dog. Just as a single sandal can make</page><page sequence="21">H. Peter Steeves 2 1 many impressions in the mud as a man walks along the banks of a river, and each impression will be similar yet distinct from the last, so is each individual earthly dog but an impression of the Formal Dog. Now, the common man studies mud; the philosopher ponders sandals. And the artist merely paints muddy toe impressions with mud that . . . uh . . . without sandals . . . and . . . uh . . . PHAEDRUS: So much obsession with feet, Socrates! This performance was about art as much as it was about animality. When Sasha, for instance, is there on stage, Sasha also suddenly appears in a painting in one of the slides. Gilah tries desperately to entice Irosenthal to attend to the painting. "Look here, it's Sasha," she says. "A painting of Sasha. Let's talk about it." The artist glances up, says "No, no, no. Oh, yes, that is Sasha" and then adds, pointing to the flesh and blood dog before her, "But this is Sasha. Let me just explain ..." Do you see what she is doing here? She is an artist; she creates these beautiful canvases; she performs for us. And yet she insists that we not make of the ani- mal an artistic abstraction, a theme, a bodyless object to be a mere symbol - either for something else or for itself. We hear the story of how Sasha was rescued, for instance, and we cannot see Sasha in the painting as a mere thing. Suddenly, art and life are not separate. All of these false dichotomies are crumbling before us as she works her craft. "Sasha is my lover," Irosenthal announces. "The best lover I have ever had." But then, immediately, she tells us that he is not her lover because she is, unfortunately, not into bestiality. Later, she will introduce Lucy, a sweet little human girl wearing a t-shirt that says "The Amazing Duckie," telling everyone that Lucy is a "two legged dog." SOCRATES: But . . . PHAEDRUS: Art and reality, human and animal, painting and flesh, lover and nonlover. What is the nature of art, the human, the painting as opposed to these lat- ter concepts in each pair? What is the nature of the lover? Consider: in this "nonper- formance," Irosenthal brings out the friends and animals she loves so dearly, and, so that we can get the point - the point about the "reality" and the performance of it all, the point about the relationship between animality and art - she then begins to insult everyone. Praising, for instance, her friend, Anna's, kindness, and her dog, Annabel's, beauty, Irosenthal turns and says "Don't be fooled! Annabel is a bitch and Anna is a witch!" (Neither of which, of course, are labels Irosenthal actually thinks are bad!) Appearance and truth are the topic here, and the artist is calling everything into ques- tion. If this is a reality show, the reality is that everything is performance and every- thing is art, yet not in the sense that such things are untruthful. Like you, Socrates, Irosenthal wants to question authority and shake things up. She lets her dogs run off</page><page sequence="22">3. Martin Cohen. "Rachel Rosenthal and Sasha," 2005; photograph (courtesy Rachel Rosenthal).</page><page sequence="23">H. Peter Steeves 2 3 leash, we are next told, because the state has no right to dictate such oppression of the flesh. I heard her say that the police are looking for a woman with a big white dog: "We are the Bonnie and Clyde of the park!" she tells the audience. Of course she would choose such a metaphor, alluding to performance - fixing roles to secure iden- tity for a moment - from the artistic past of Hollywood, film, and lore. But she might as well have said that she is being chased by the elders of the city for corrupting the pups of Athens. SOCRATES: This I don't follow. Why risk so much for an animal? What could they ever give us in return? What could they ever truly appreciate being given from us, appreciate as such ? PHAEDRUS: Socrates, you owe a cock to Asclepius, but what do you owe the cock? Think carefully about your true final debts. SOCRATES: Watch your tongue, Peter. Do not deny me a third time. PHAEDRUS: I owe you a great deal, my friend, but not more than I owe the truth. (Andrew Lloyd Webbers "John Nineteen: Forty One" plays softly in the background. The sound is scratchy ; as if on an old phonograph. After a minute , the song begins to skip, stuck on the same groove. The music fades, skipping. During this time , DESCARTES has awakened , looked around, and climbed down into the PIT where he cannot be seen, laid to rest. Now the jungle sounds gradually grow louder as the show concludes. ROSEN- THAL sits up, stretches, and listens to the continuing dialogue.) SOCRATES: I think I'd better cover my head. (He puts on a pair of Mickey Mouse ears and closes his eyes) PHAEDRUS: To speak to dogs, one must know the language of dogs. "'Dog,'" the artist tells us, "is not a dog word." Neither are "Come" or "Sit." Spoken words get clos- er: "Herewego!" and "Tothecorner!," Irosenthal suggests, are acceptable in certain local canine patois. Nothing is universal, I'm afraid. Nothing ever is. Our own English has already taken much from Dog. We get the word "awesome" from the word a dog pro- nounces when he yawns, the word "like" from the word he repeats when he licklick- licks his chops. As with all true dialogue, the exchange goes both ways. I have to admit that I especially like the awesome fact that at this part in her performance when she is talking about language, words, and communication, the stage is so crowded with dogs and humans moving around and talking to each other, that it is increasingly hard to hear what Irosenthal is saying. She has to project more than normal, almost shouting</page><page sequence="24">24 Mosaic 39/4 (December 2006) to the audience. We feel as if we are in her studio, perhaps - so many friends under- foot - and the act of talking and the act of painting are being compared and explained for us. What a joyous chaos! Oh, and it is then that the siren begins to sound. (Pause. The jungle sounds stop. Silence. Everyone waits as if a siren is about to go off. After ten to fifteen seconds of silence , the jungle sounds return and PHAEDRUS continues:) The dogs in the studio always howl when an emergency truck with sirens blaring passes by, and so Irosenthal plans to have a siren go off to interrupt her speech and fill the theatre with howls. The sound begins, but with the siren being a mere recording, the context of the stage, the excitement of the performance, not a single dog howls. Immediately, though, without pause and without time for thought, the humans on stage - followed by the humans in the audience (another dichotomy being taken apart for us here) - all begin to bay and howl in harmony with the siren, the canines staring at the humans in amazement. It is a lovely moment, a deep moment. Humans in the throes of anti- linguistic language, singing their non-words; dogs silent and still, as if puzzled. As the dogs watch in wonder, performing perfectly their silence, we come to see language - ours and theirs and the false dichotomy of ours-and-theirs - in a new light. We are all brought together. And now that Irosenthal has us just where she wants us - the paint- ings on the screen flying by at too great a speed to make much out (colour! dog! colour! sky! dog! dog! dog!), the drumming in the background increasing in volume and intensity, the communal howl fresh in our ears - she preaches again her sermon against the leash and has us scream together "I hate leash laws!" before announcing in a guttural shriek of freedom "Everybody off leash!" (ROSENTHAL stands and walks off stage.) The dogs that were leashed and held and embraced and restrained by the cast members are now let loose; and as she lets slip the dogs of chaos, they wander all around the theatre, sniffing the humans, sniffing each other, petting and being petted, creating a kinetic painting and dissolving the final scaffolding of the artifice of the theatre and the expectation that we are somehow different, somehow better, somehow Other. I close my eyes now, Socrates, and I am still in the midst of those fine dogs, still able to see her paintings nearly turned into a kinescope flashing so quickly before me, still basking in the freedom she bestowed upon me. I am transformed. SOCRATES: (Removes his hat and speaks humbly) I never I wonder How Do they throw flowers and sweet figs down upon her when she concludes and receives her final tribute onstage? PHAEDRUS: She merely waves goodbye in the middle of the chaos and leaves, the dogs still roaming, the show still going. If you are not attentive, you might miss that she has stepped aside because everything she has created is still there.</page><page sequence="25">H. Peter Steeves 2 5 SOCRATES: Then, no conclusion?
