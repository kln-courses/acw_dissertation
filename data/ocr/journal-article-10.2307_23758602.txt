The Council of the Nahua Peoples of the Upper Balsas (CPNAB), situated in the Mexican State of Guerrero, is attempting to draw international and scholai attention to the décision of the Mexican govemment to allow its Federal Commission on Electricity (CFE) to construct a hydroelectric plant in the San Juan Tetelcingo area of the Upper Balsas Valley. The Council, which was founded in San Agustín Oapan on 21 October 1990, is alarmed by the plan, which, if carried out, will result in the displacement of more than 40,000 inhabitants of some 22 towns and villages. The Nahuatl-speaking Citizens of this région stand to lose their homes, fields, Springs, natural resources, places of worship, and such ceremonial centres as the archaeological zone of Teopantecuanitlan, an Olmec site on the banks of the Balsas in the municipio of Copalillo, if the plant is built. The Council is desperately seeking support, both moral and economic, in their struggle for ethnie survival. For further information contact: CAN c/o J. A. Flores, Apdo. Postal 19-695, C.

In December 1990 the remains of a structure that might have funetioned as a</page><page sequence="2">bench for ceremonial or ritual events were unearthed in Ocotelulco, Tlaxcala. Ocotelulco is known primarily for the role it, as one of four city-states governing the "republic" of Tlaxcallan, played in the Spanish conquest of Mexico Tenochtitlan. Archaeologists working under the direction of José Eduardo Contreras have been excavating and examining the newly discovered structure, which measures 7 m in length and 64 cm in PERALTE???, for a little over a year now. In the middle section of the bench a trapezoidal altar, 58 cm high anda maximum of 78 cm in width, was found. Both bench and altar are covered in rich polychrome symbolism. Skulls, human hearts, hands, and circles on a black ground adom the bench. A distinct resemblance has been noted between this sacrificial iconography and that of the upper border of the stone of Tezcatlipoca, discovered in 1987 in the palace of the exarchbishopric of the City of Mexico. There are moreover, familiar parallels in the polychrome altars of Tizatlan, Tlax. The altar of Ocotelulco exhibits on its free west, south, and east faces paintings thatare in agood state of préservation. These painted surfaces display in descending sequence eight nasked personages with red bands representing the blood of acrifice. The scenes with these personages stand on a base with black lines and white circles.Each figure has a serpentine body, sharp-clawed hands, and distinctive facial masks. The latter correspond to those of known Nahuaü deities, such as Quetzalcoad, who is painted black three times and, in one instance, yellow with black lines. Tezcatlipoca's face, is recognizable by v irtue of its black ground wi th two horizontal yellow bands, one at the height of his eyes and the other at that of the mouth. Like the mask of Xolod, it appears on one occasion with furrows of brown, while the mask of Tlahuizcalpantecuhtli is distinguishable by its white spots. Fig 1.
