It might seem inauspicious to recall this study's account of Chaplin was mentioned by Paul Merton as exemplifying over-intellectualisation of creative genius in a popular medium (during a BBC interview about the stand-up's own history of silent comedy.) Merton's remark highlights perennial difficulties in bridging the chasm between academic approaches and wider cultural experience and values. However, to be fair, Trotter's book concentrates on deducing what artistic 'highbrows' might have derived from film's early years, rather than on its 'mass' reception as such. Moreover, he ventures beyond most academic precedents, to explore what writers might have seen in film before and beyond screen experiments explicitly affiliated with Modernism itself. He deals with Modernism's The Review of English Studies, New Series, Vol. 60, No. 244 y ine Author ivw. monshea oy Uxtord university rress l\)W, au ngnts reserved</page><page sequence="2">REVIEWS 325 engagement with a spectrum of forms developing from the 'cinema of attractions' (follow- ing the Cinematograph's patenting in 1895) to the global dominance of Hollywood's 'cinema of narrative integration' in the 1910s and 1920s. Trotter conducts his enquiry with admirable historical rigour, rightly castigating approaches which have proved anachronistic in relation to the film-making of the period. He also wisely avoids simplistic models of causality and influence, in favour of subtler aesthetic 'convergences' and 'parallelism'. This grounds his case for interdependency: that we can't fully understand cinema without literary Modernism, and vice-versa. Trotter's initial focus is on early cinema's fundamental tension between 'immediacy' its impression of virtually tangible, stereoscopic realism (especially foregrounded in close- ups), and 'hypermediacy', self-reflexive awareness that this was a complex technological effect. He examines this through manifold critiques of cinematic absent-presences and ontological equivocations in the fiction of D. H. Lawrence, Elizabeth Bowen, and others. A similar tension between the moving photographic image's excess of 'sense' (i.e. indis- criminate recording of all phenomena in its visual field) and the imposition of moralizing narrative 'meaning' persists in the Biograph films of D. W. Griffith. These are normally seen as key to converting cinema into an editorially- abstracted, story- driven 'space- time' based on (proto-)montage. Nevertheless, 'Sense, in the Biograph films, is intelligibility's anti- system, a counter-narrative which articulates contingency or the "material life" as presence effect' (p. 62). Hence if Griffith's melodramatic form of parallel editing was indeed the most widely available example for effects of simultaneity and suspenseful convergence when Joyce devised the interpolations of Ulysses' 'Wandering Rocks', then the novelist was producing a parody of it, deliberately eschewing climactic showdown between 'hero' and 'villain'. Alternatively, Trotter suggests 'Wandering Rocks' 'remediates' the earliest 'Living Dublin' topicals (notably recent restorations from the Mitchell and Kenyon archive). Joyce captures Dublin's bustling street milieu with the indiscriminate excess of a mobile camera, to subvert both cinematic and civic ceremonies of recognition and acknowledgement contemporary to the action (1904). Trotter also argues the lateral tracking shot (known as Cabiria movement, from Pastrone's 1914 film) is 'the least anthropomorphic ... of all camera movements', drawing attention to the act of filming by departing 'from natural lines of sight and movement' (p. 103). However, his excursus on its deployment in various epics by Gance, Vidor, and Dreyer (self- admittedly) only seems to 'lead us back, in a roundabout way' (p. Ill), to Joyce and is Trotter's most labyrinthine section. He doesn't finally produce a clinching match from Ulysses for this specific trope of screen 'automatism', though his general conclusion, that 'Wandering Rocks' too represents an important break with 'lines of sight and movement' constructing narrative space in fiction hitherto, remains sound. Trotter insists bluntly that Eliot, unlike Joyce, 'did not write cinematically' (p. 126), despite his correspondence's intimate familiarity with film's narrative 'grammar'. The cine- matic qualities of Eliot's poetry reside not in style, but deeper philosophic implications raised by its technological prehistory. Hence Eliot resurrects the magic lantern, as struc- turing metaphor for 'Prufrock's' febrile self-projections, and mutoscope peepshows, for similar ends in Tiresias' voyeuristic (reviewing from The Waste LanSs 'Fire Sermon'. For Woolf on the other hand, the creative outcome of the conclusion of her essay on 'The Cinema' - that it shows 'life as it is when we have no part in it' in a simultaneously objec- tive and haunting form - is the 'Time Passes' section of To The Lighthouse. This consists of a similarly 'observerless' narration, presenting the symbolic deterioration of the holiday home in the posthumous absence of the Ramsay family's maternal centre.</page><page sequence="3">326 REVIEWS Readers will have to decide whether they agree with Merton's conclusion about Trotter's concluding chapter: comic 'hypermimesis' in Chaplin's Essanay films is compared to that of Wyndham Lewis's The Childermass, for example. However, his study takes justifiable risks in breaking new ground with ingenuity and eloquence (even if particular yokings of the two media might seem less fitting or contestable occasionally). Trotter's approach is based on profound engagement with André Bazin's The Ontology of the Photographic Image'. Early actualities seemed to record reality so accurately it appeared to merely reproduce itself. There's no doubt this 'original neutrality' gradually sponsored profound and diverse synergies in a literary period fascinated by 'disembodi- ment of perception by technique' (Garrett Stewart, quoted on p. 6). Trotter shows how it figured not just in Modernists' deconstruction of inherited categories of mimetic realism, but in energising discursive experiments and thematic preoccupations which exploited equivalent 'automatisms' of language and literary form, epitomised by Eliot's 'poetics of impersonality'. However, automatism, cinema's impression of representation without intervening con- sciousness, can be critically exaggerated. Statements such as 'to see only as a machine sees', 'view the scene as a machine would view it' (pp. 95 and 98) are far from literal. The repeated verb is a metaphor telescoping a mediating process. This starts and ends in human inter- vention and cognition, albeit the middle stage employs Bazin's 'nonliving agent'. From this standpoint, cinema's absolute neutrality becomes (technological fantasy. The apparatus required eyes and brains to train and direct it; to receive and 'animate' its projected results. The persistence of vision effect is also essential to blurring successive still photographs into illusory life. Film 'mimics' our way of seeing in order to work on us as a representation with the deceptive quality of a perception. It is thus always a complex human -machine- human interface, as many Modernists realised. If cinema is a 'prosthetic' making things visible in new ways, then surely it 'grafts' on the eye (as Dylan Thomas noted), rather than functioning independently of it? keith Williams University of Dundee doi:10.1093/res/hgnl66 Advance Access published on 29 January 2009</page></plain_text>
