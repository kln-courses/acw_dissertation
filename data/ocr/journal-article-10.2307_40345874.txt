<plain_text><page sequence="1">282 BRIEF COMMUNICATIONS JEA 94 A rock art palimpsest: evidence of the relative ages of some Eastern Desert petroglyphs* In general it is difficult to base reliable estimates of the date of a petroglyph on its degree of patination because the rate at which the patina forms is unknown. In some cases, however, the conditions to which adjacent images have been subject, and therefore their rate of patination, can be assumed to be similar and the sequence in which they were drawn can be deduced. One such, in the Eastern Desert east of Kom Ombo, is reported here. Groups of images of different subjects, mainly animals and anthropoids, drawn in different styles, can be distinguished and conclusions about their ages can be drawn. Of all the potential means of dating petroglyphs patination is the most tantalising. It is clear to a casual observer that the clean rock surface exposed by a petroglyph artist becomes progressively discoloured with time and that the degree of discolouration therefore holds information about the age of the work, but it is in most cases impossible to decipher this information in terms of years. This is because the rate of formation of the patina causing the discolouration is affected by many circumstances that differ markedly for different rock faces. Thus, while a heavily patinated image that has acquired colouration similar to that of the adjacent undisturbed rock is clearly 'old', and one that is clean showing the colour of the substrate is 'recent', often nothing more can be said about their ages with confidence. The patina is a layer typically a few hundred microns thick, consisting partly of material leached from the body of the rock and partly of material accreted from blown dust. Leaching takes place if the rock is immersed in water and also (much more slowly) under the influence of water deposited as dew. The water causes metal ions to move to the surface where they give the patina its characteristic colours, reddish for iron and black for manganese.1 The dust component of the patina is mainly tiny particles of silica, but among them are occasional organic particles such as fibres of decayed vegetation. Such particles, though very small (typically weighing only a few micrograms), can be used to provide 14C dating infor- mation. This has been done in a few cases for Egyptian petroglyphs,2 but the technique is difficult and time-consuming and has not yet been used extensively enough to establish a firm basis for dating the various images found in the region. The rate at which a patina is formed depends on the exposure of the rock to wind and sun, dust and humidity.3 As no two surfaces can be assumed to be alike in all these respects it is very difficult to make any clear deductions about age from the patination of petroglyphs on different surfaces. Cervicek has made an ambitious attempt to do this but it is very elaborate and depends on the availability of detailed information about colour and degree of patina- tion, information that has to be presented in a standardised manner for each petroglyph image.4 It is not certain that data collected by different observers and presented in different publications are standardised well enough for this method to be used on the Eastern Desert petroglyphs. The situation is not so discouraging for petroglyphs on the same surface. If there are two or more petroglyphs close together, it is sometimes possible to discern the order in which they were drawn. If they are in identical positions - that is the images overlap - it is almost always possible to see which was drawn first. If two or three images are close - within say a few tens of centimetres - and if the surrounding rock surface is flat and its patina is uniform, it is similarly usually possible to determine the order in which they were drawn in a reliable way. However instances where this is possible for more than a few images, or for images of * The author wishes to acknowledge the assistance of colleagues of the Eastern Desert Survey, particularly Geoff Phillipson, and the staff of Ancient World Tours. 1 A.

The purpose of the present note is to discuss one of these rare instances. A much-used rock face In the Wadi Sha^it, some 3 km from its confluence with the Wadi Muweilhat, about 90 km east-north-east of Kom Ombo, there is a large fairly smooth rock face, some 2 m high and 10 m wide, that is covered with petroglyphs drawn in several different styles and exhibiting various degrees of patination. It was visited and photographed by the author on 19 February 2003 in the course of an expedition mounted by the Eastern Desert Survey. For the purposes of reference it was designated Site SH5. Figure 1 is a composite view of the rock face showing the many petroglyphs. Because the two photographs from which it is made up were taken from the same point there is some overall distortion but this does not affect the relationships between neighbouring images. Fig. 1. Composite view of Site SH5. It is apparent that the patination of the undisturbed rock face is not uniform. There is a horizontal band of dark colour at the base of the face and several vertical bands of lighter and darker colour. Superimposed on these features there are diagonal bands of lighter colour towards the left of the face and a larger light area above the centre. These light areas are associated with the edges of cracks where slabs of rock have at some time spalled from the surface. It seems likely that the dark colour was caused by exposure to water. The base of the face may have been covered at some time either by standing water or by moist sand or soil that has since been washed away. Similarly the vertical dark bands may have been caused by water cascading or dripping down the face. The fact that these gradations of colour are not reflected in the petroglyphs suggest that the episodes of flooding and cascading took place before the earliest of the petroglyphs was drawn. The edges of the spallation cracks on the left of the face are discontinuities in the form of steps, and as such are exposed to slightly higher air speeds as the wind blows over the surface. The result appears to be that enhanced erosion by wind-born sand or dust at the edges of the cracks has caused the patina there to be removed rather than deposited, resulting in the lighter colouration. The petroglyphs It is clear that the petroglyphs have very different degrees of patination. Some are so dark as to be barely distinguishable from the undisturbed rock surface while others are very bright, and there are many intermediate shades. In addition, several different types of image can be seen: there are what appear to be animals of various degrees of realism; there are human figures in various poses; there are shapes that might be fanciful representations of animals,</page><page sequence="3">284 BRIEF COMMUNICATIONS JEA 94 Fig. 2. Petroglyphs at the centre of site SH5 (lighter = older, darker = newer). human or otherwise; there are linear features, some straight, some tortuous; and there are abstract shapes and what appear to be letters. The petroglyph images were grouped according to degree of patination using the following technique. The original 35 mm colour transparencies were scanned digitally at high resolution and then amalgamated using Adobe Photoshop software to produce figure 1 . This was then enlarged in sections to about A3 size and printed. The petroglyphs were traced from the prints, by hand, and the tracings were digitised again. The traced images were then classified into five groups, members of each group exhibiting similarity of style and subject matter and also similarity of patination, making allowances for the way the patina of the undisturbed rock varies across the rock face. It is important to note the subjective nature of the tracing stage. This is unavoidable. Attempts were made to avoid personal judgement in identifying the images but they failed because it is not possible to distinguish by mechanical means a mark on the rock made by a petroglyph artist from a mark that has occurred naturally. For example software that takes account only of light and dark cannot be made to distinguish the large light area in the top centre of figure 1 from the light animal images below it. It must also be recognised that there is also a significant subjective element in the classification, particularly with respect to style and subject matter. Groups of petroglyphs Figure 2 is an enlarged portion of a tracing of the centre part of figure 1 which conveniently includes examples of all five groups of petroglyphs, as indicated. Figure 3 consists of trac- ings of the petroglyphs assigned to each group. Group 1. These are the darkest and most heavily patinated images on the rock face. Among them are five which are the most difficult to interpret in terms of what, if anything, they represent. They might be animals or anthropomorphs. All have elliptical 'bodies', four limbs (although one limb is almost missing on the small creature on the left), and a tail. Two have elongated 'necks', the 'head' on one of which is very small, and both 'heads' are deco- rated with horizontal protuberances that curve down at the ends. Three have what appear to be 'fingers' on one upper limb (but not the other) and one has a tuft of 'hair' (or possibly 'fingers') on its tail. One (which does not appear on figure 2, only in figure 3) has eyes. One has five vertical strokes on its 'head' that might represent either hair or decorations, possibly plumes. The star-shaped image on the left of the Group 1 section of figure 3 and the nearby indeterminate objects seem, because of their dark colour, to belong to the same group.</page><page sequence="4">2oo8 BRIEF COMMUNICATIONS 285 Group 1 m Group 2 &gt;; Group 3 V* Group 4 ^f_J ^T Group 5 Fig. 3.

Above and to the left of the large Group 1 object to the right of the centre of figure 2 are a number of images, made up of curved or straight lines, that are only slightly lighter. The highest appears to be a simple representation of a man, with curved lines for arms and legs, a small round head and an exaggerated penis. To his left are what might be animals, possibly an ibex, a crocodile, and an ostrich, in a similar linear style. There is also an object shaped like a letter T\ There are more linear features and indeterminate objects, all with similar patination, to the right in the Group 2 section of figure 3. Group 3. Figure 2 also shows, either side of the large Group 1 object, several images that appear quite clearly to represent animals and an ostrich. Near the right 'foot' of the large object there is another man, similar in form to the Group 2 man described above but lighter in colour and smaller. There are more, similar animal images on the right-hand part of the rock face. Several appear, because of the exaggerated curved horns, to be ibexes. To the left, lying across the 'neck' of the other large Group 1 object, is a linear feature with branches at its top that in form appears akin to Group 2 but is considerably less darkly patinated. Above the right-hand group of 'animals' there is a feature consisting of three incomplete touching circles one of which has a dot at its centre. Group 4. To the left of the large Group 1 object there is a particularly light and detailed image of an animal with long straight horns (possibly an oryx) suckling its young. Farther to the left there are several other animal images, all quite light and comparatively detailed. Among them are two ostriches and three enigmatic 'maned' animals that may be wild asses. There are two more small animals on the extreme right of the face that are similarly light. Apart from the obvious difference in patination these images are distinguished from Group 3 by their detail and relative realism. Group 5. The brightest images on the rock face include the man at the top of figure 2. He appears to be a copy of the nearby Group 2 man. To his left is an anthropoid image, appar- ently an archer. Farther to the left, in the Group 5 section of figure 3 but not in figure 2, are two other anthropoid images which seem to be of a man who carries a bow and a man riding a camel. To the right in figure 2 there is what appears to be a copy of the three-circle Group 3 object, and also three symbols that might be letters. All are very bright and almost without patina. The group appears to be characterised by an interest in people rather than animals, and also to copies of earlier images. Comparisons Most of the images on this rock face are familiar in the Eastern Desert. Animals with long horns curved almost in a semicircle - presumably ibexes - are widespread,5 as are ostriches. The 'wild asses' of Group 4 are also fairly common in the region, especially south of the Wadi Barramiya.6 Camels, ridden or riderless, and usually lightly patinated (confirming their comparative recent date) are also frequent. There are, however, some notable differences from the wider corpus of Eastern Desert rock art. Firstly, several of the images common elsewhere are absent from this site. It has very few wild animals apart from the Group 4 oryxes, ibexes, and ostriches and the Group 2 crocodile mentioned above. There are no giraffes and no elephants. More remarkable is the complete absence of the cattle which are very common at many nearby sites in the Wadi Sha^it and its adjoining wadis. Also there are no boats, images of which are common north of the Wadi Barramiya. The second feature that makes this site almost unique is the presence of the five Group 1 objects that might be anthropomorphic images. Nothing remotely like the two long-necked images has been reported anywhere else in the Eastern Desert, the Nile Valley, or even, as far as the author is aware, in the rest of the Sahara. The three 'short-necked' objects are almost 5 D. Rohl (ed.), The Followers of Horus: Eastern Desert Survey Report (Basingstoke, 2000), passim (e.g. 58.4, 139.2); M. Morrow and M.

Similar images have been reported at only two other sites: between Mamla and el- Otwani in the Nile Valley, on the east bank just north of Edfu, where there are three exam- ples;7 and at Khor el-Aqiba, near Tumas, some 150 km south-west of Aswan, now under Lake Nasser, where there are four.8 Of these the former are most like those reported here in that they have 'fingers', while the latter are less detailed and are in some respects similar to some adjacent images that look more like crocodiles or lizards. Cervicek (Felsbilder, 76) makes the point that the three images at Mamla are dark, almost as heavily patinated as the undisturbed rock. Conclusions - vela tive da ting From the average patination of each of the groups of petroglyphs at site SH5 it is reasonably clear that they were drawn in sequence, Group 1 being the oldest and Group 5 the newest. The ambiguous Group 1 images that might be either animals or anthropoids are the oldest images, and this conclusion is confirmed by the observations reported by Cervicek. The sequence of animal images in Groups 2, 3 and 4 show a progression from less to more realistic in style. This confirms an impression gained from other Eastern Desert images notably of giraffes.9 However, a different conclusion was reached from observations of petroglyphs in the Nile Valley,10 where examples of superposition show that, in some cases, realistic images were superseded by more diagrammatic. If, therefore, it is concluded that the development of the petroglyph artists' work was from less to more realism, this can be asserted at most for the artists working in the region of the Wadi Sha^it. It is not necessarily the case elsewhere. It seems that at most times the petroglyph artists were interested in ibexes, because images of these animals appear in both Groups 2 and 3. This is hardly surprising because ibexes have probably always been present in the Red Sea mountains and their western wadis, as they are to this day. Other animals, such as oryxes and 'wild asses', were the objects of inter- est later. Camels appeared later in the petroglyph record. This confirms the conclusion that is suggested by several observations of relatively lightly-patinated camel petroglyphs from many places in the Eastern Desert. Some of the latest petroglyph artists copied the work of their predecessors. Conclusions - absolute dating Because the difference in patination between Groups 4 and 5 is relatively slight it is tempting to conclude that the earlier groups, especially Group 1 , which is so dark, were drawn very much earlier, possibly several millennia earlier. However this would not be correct because allowance must be made for changes in climate. Before about 3000 bc what is now the Eastern Desert was more humid than it is now, to the extent that it had sufficient vegetation to support the range of wild and domestic animals seen in the petroglyph record. One effect of the humidity would have been that the rate of patination, and especially the rate of discoloura- tion of newly exposed rock surfaces, would have been greater before the end of the fourth millennium than later, after the region became as desiccated as it is now. This suggests that the petroglyphs of Groups 2 and 3, and, most interesting, the strange images of Group 1, were drawn before the mid-fourth millennium, but it is not possible to say how long before. On the other hand it is of interest to note the four absolute 14C dates obtained by Huyge et al." The earliest of these, from the dark patina of a 'fish trap' petroglyph from el-Hosh in the Nile Valley, about 100 kilometres west of our site SH5, lies in the range 5900-5300 bc (68% confidence limits). A date in the sixth millennium, which might appear attractive for 7 P.

Cervicek presents estimates of the dates of various classes of petroglyphs from the Nile valley south of Aswan.12 His results may not be comparable with those presented here, partly because his region is some 150 km from site SH5, and partly because images from few of his categories are present there (as mentioned above there are no giraffes, elephants, cattle or boats, all of which occur frequently in the valley). However, in the cases that can be com- pared, the suggested dating presented here is not incompatible with Cervicek's. In particular his rinding that most of the ostrich images date from the New Kingdom suggests that our Group 4 images, with the more realistic animals, are from that period. Similarly his finding that camel images date from after 1070 bc (if a curious anomaly that some appear to be from the Middle Kingdom is overlooked) is compatible with the absence of camels from Egypt before the first millennium bc and is in agreement with a late date for Group 5. 12 Cervicek, Jahrbuch fiir Prdhistorische und Ethnographische Kunst 23 (1973), 82-7, pis 50-3.</page></plain_text>
