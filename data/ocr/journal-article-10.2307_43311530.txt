<plain_text><page sequence="1">A second opinion It has become de rigueur for many who are deeply concerned about the environment to look askance at books or articles that foresee anything but environ- mental apocalypse. Thus it is not surprising that T.H. Watkins of the Wilderness Society is so crit- ical in his review of A Moment on Earth: The Coming Age of Environmental Optimism by Gregg Easterbrook ( Issues , Fall 1995). Easterbrook has written a courageous book that, while still recognizing that serious problems remain, posits that environmen- tal degradation is being arrested in many unappreciated ways,. The book is not a scientific vol- ume but an ambitiously compre- hensive overview by a well- known journalist for Newsweek magazine. Easterbrook displays a familiarity with environmental science, but some of his inter- pretations are debatable. It is a monumental effort. Easterbrook presents his views in three parts. He devotes about 70 percent of the text to an assessment of what has happened to environmental conditions in the recent past and to what is likely to occur in the immediate future. Easterbrook amasses a re- markable catalog of statistical measures of improvements in the environment that have occurred over the past several decades as a result of the concerted action of humanity, especially in industri- alized countries. His introductory and final sections express his personal phi- losophy about the relationship between humanity and the envi- ronment. His thesis is that in the long term the earth is remarkably resilient. Indeed, he endows na- ture with an anthropomorphic character that makes it sound as if it is exhibiting innate intelli- gence in its response to assaults. In the final section of the book, which addresses the green future, Easterbrook presents a hopeful, but in same cases fanciful, out- look for humanity. Expressing deep concern that the environmental movement could become just another inter- est group, Easterbrook urges ac- tivists to move from overstate- ment to "ecorealism" in thought and action. His principles of eco- realism include: acceptance of an ever-changing environment in which habitats are not static; greater dependence on market forces as a way to address envi- ronmental problems; faith in the ability of technology to provide a path to a better environment; in- vestment by the industrialized world in the environmental pro- tection of the developing world; special attention to species ex- tinctions (one of the few irre- versible environmental tragedies); and finally the awareness that hu- manity is one with all other liv- ing things on the planet. Easterbrook certainly pro- vides fodder for debate and argu- ment. Though optimistic, this vol- ume does not minimize the many critical environmental issues that humanity has yet to face. His book should be welcomed by those deeply concerned about the environment, since it suggests a hopeful environmental future. ROBERT M.
