<plain_text><page sequence="1">S. PARANAVITANA, C.B.E.,PH.D.: THE SCULPTURE OF MAN AND HORSE NEAR TISAVAVA AT ANURADHAPURA, CEYLON THE SUNKEN RELIEF REPRESENTING THE SEATED FIGURE OF A MAN, WITH THE head of a horse behind his right shoulder, cut out of the living rock at the ancient site now called Isurumuni at Anuradhapura, is well known to students of Indian art (fig. i, frontispiece). An authority of the standing of Laurence Binyon has referred to this sculpture as 'a tremendous work, impossible to forget when once seen';' it is generally accepted that this is one of the masterpieces of the plastic art of ancient Ceylon. For the aesthetic appreciation of the form and technique of the sculpture, it may be immaterial to consider what it represents; but a knowledge of its subject is essential in coming to conclusions about the significance of the form, the purpose which the sculptor had in view when he undertook the execution of his task, the degree of success he had achieved in the realisation of his purpose and the means he had adopted to do so. There is no tradition with regard to what this sculpture represents. The people living in and around Anuradhapura appear to have entirely forgotten the significance which their ancestors attached to this mysterious figure, seated high up on the face of the rock, gazing intently forward. The pilgrims who flock to the site rarely take any notice of him. The priests and the guides relate no story with regard to him. The sculpture, however, aroused the curiosity of Dr. A. K. Coomaraswamy at the time when he, during the youth- ful years he spent in the land of his birth, was just embarking on his career as an interpreter of Indian art and culture-a career in which he was to achieve such distinction in sub- sequent years. Dr. Coomaraswamy (who was the first to realize the artistic value of this sculpture), arguing mainly on the presence of the horse, concluded that the man represented 1 Saturday Review of I8th February I9I I, quoted by V. A. Smith in his History of Fine Art in India and Ceylon, I st edition, p. 95. I67</page><page sequence="2">Fig. i Sculpture of Man and Horse at 'Isurumuni'. Anuradhapura S. Paranavitana: The Sculpture of Man and Horse near Tisivdva at Anuradhapura, Ceylon</page><page sequence="3">in this sculpture is the sage Kapila, figuring in the first episode of the well-known Indian myth of the descent of the Ganges from heaven.2 The great prestige of Coomaraswamy has secured unquestioning acceptance for this identifi- cation, and many a writer who has had the occasion to refer to the sculpture, for instance Dr. V.A. Smith, has introduced it to his readers as Kapila. Why this legend was selected to be illustrated in a sculpture at this particular place, why this incident of the legend was singled out for representation in preference to its main interest, whether this legend formed a part of the religious traditions of the people of Ceylon at a particular period, and a number of other questions pertinent to the identification have not even been raised. One or two eminent authorities on Indian art, however, have expressed doubts with regard to Dr. Coomaraswamy's identification of the sculpture. Prof. Vogel,3 for instance, says: 'The presence of the horse seems hardly to supply sufficient justification for identifying the figure as Kapila Muni'. Dr. William Cohn has pointed out that the man is seated in the attitude called maha-raja/-l-la, which is not appropriate if the sage Kapila, deeply immersed in me- ditation, was meant to be represented.4 Apart from the pose, the figure of the man has not the emaciated body and the matted locks which are characteristics of sages and ascetics in Indian art. This point will be brought home if the reader were to compare the figure of the seated man in this Anuradhapura sculpture with that of an ascetic in the well-known Mamallapuram relief pictured at Plate 9 3 of Dr. Cohn's Indische Plastik. In my view, the fact that the man in this sculpture is not seated in a yoga pose is adequate ground to reject Dr. Coomaraswamy's theory that he is Kapila Muni. For an investigation of the identity of this sculpture and the purpose for which it was created, a consideration of its main characteristics, its location and the possible relation it has to other sculptures on the same rock will not be without their bearing. I, therefore, preface my own suggestions about the identity of the sculpture with some observations on these aspects of the subject. 2 The story has been summarised by Vincent Smith, op. cit., p. 95. For Coomaraswamy's views on the sculpture, see Spolia Zeylanica, Vol. VI, p. 132. 3 Buddhist Art in India, Ceylon and Yava, Oxford, 1936, p. 84, n. I. 4 Indische Plastik, Berlin, 1923, p. 8I. t68</page><page sequence="4">The rock on which the figure is carved is one (the third from the north) of a group of seven gneiss boulders, situated below the bund of the irrigation reservoir called Tisavava (Tissa-vapl in the Mahabvamsa) which was originally constructed by king Devanampiya Tissa (the contemporary of the great Asoka of India) and still perpetuates his name. The reservoir, covering an area of 396 acres, was not only the principal source of water supply to the inhabitants of ancient Anuradhapura, but also irrigated extensive rice fields, as it does even today, and the produce of these fields must have constituted a good proportion of their food supply. The life of ancient Anuradhapura, thus, depended to a great measure on the availability of a plentiful supply of water in the Tisavava. The seated figure is at a height of 15 ft. from the present ground level, which does not appear to differ much from that in ancient days, on the north-eastern side of the boulder, close to the point at which it touches the boulder to the north of it. The impenetrable gaze of the mysterious figure peeping out of the rock is thus fixed on the rice fields which extend from the embankment of the irrigation reservoir up to the banks of the ancient Kadamba- nadi, now Malvatu Oya. The seated figure, which is rather less than life size, measuring 2 ft. 712 in. from the waist to the crown of the head, is inside a shallow, arched cavity, the chest being almost a continuation of the vertical plane of the rock. The figure is not seated on an alsana, but on the flattened ground of the cavity. The left leg is placed on the ground and is stretched out; but is curved and returned at the knee so that the left foot touches the right thigh. The left arm stretches vertically down like a pillar from the rounded shoulder, and the hand is placed palm downwards on the floor. The right leg, bent at the knee, is raised, the out- stretched right arm resting on it. The trunk is erect but not stiff. The entire pose gives the impression of one confident of his power and strength. The expression on the face, as Dr. Vincent Smith has remarked, is that of calm and abstracted but not unconscious dignity. The upper part of the body is bare; the folds of a thin cloth which drapes the lower half of the body are shown at the waist, and the hem of this garment is indicated by a faint line below the knee of the raised right leg and at the ankle of the left leg placed on the ground. A necklace hangs down the chest. Heavy ear-rings are shown suspending from the elongated lobes. On the upper right arm is worn a bracelet (angada). The seated figure has been I69</page><page sequence="5">described as wearing a helmet on the head. From its shape, the helmet appears to be made of metal. A thick plume forms a crest on the top and hangs down the back. 5 In the alternative, the hair may be taken as treated in the style called jatubhara in South Indian iconography.6 While there is clear definition of the facial features, and the chest and abdomen have been realistically modelled, the fingers and toes, respectively, of the hands and the left foot placed on the ground, have been left vague. The hands and the foot have merely been blocked out. Being seated on the rock itself, and the hands and one foot merging into the indefiniteness of the rock, the figure of the seated man appears to be organically one with the mass of the rock. Above the left shoulder is shown the back of a seat against which the figure is resting; on the right side, this feature also, like the hands, is lost in the background of the rock. The head of a horse is seen emerging out of the rock behind the right arm of the seated figure. From the position of its head, the animal's body must be taken as in the bowels of the rock. The snout of the horse's head has been damaged and has been recently restored in cement. The photograph, therefore, is deceptive when it shows the horse's head as touching the arm of the man who is seemingly oblivious of the beast's presence. Dr. Vincent Smith has described the seated man as holding the halter of the horse. This is due to an error; he has probably mistaken the bracelet on the arm of the man for a halter. Bordering the base of the boulder at its north-western side, as well as the two boulders adjoining it to the north, is a pond, the sides of which at present are lined with dressed stone, collected at the site. The pond itself, however, is an ancient feature. Being fed by the adjoining reservoir, this pond is full at all periods of the year. Just above the water-level of this pond, there are, at the base of the boulder containing the sculpture of the man and horse, the fore-parts of four figures of elephants roughly delineated in the round (figs. 2,3). Touching the water at the base of the adjoining boulder is the figure of an elephant, in low relief, very naturalistically rendered with upturned trunk, as if pouring water over its body (figs. 2 4). The tail of another elephant, whose body apparently has to be taken as immersed in the water, is seen to the left. Representations of leaves and buds of the lotus suggest that the 5 Parker, Ancient Ceylon, p. 545. 6 Gopinatha Rao, Elements of Hindu Iconography, Vol. I, part I, plate IX, fig. 3. 170</page><page sequence="6">Fig. 2 Carvings of Elephants at base of rock at 'Isurumuni' elephants are bathing in a pool. On the northern boulder, at a height of about 7 ft. from the water-level of the pond, an arched cavity, 2 ft. 7 in. broad and 2 ft. 7 in. in height, has been scooped. A small shrine has been excavated on the eastern face of the boulder containing the sculpture of the man and horse. In it is a seated Buddha, at present coated with plaster and paint, which is the main attraction to the pilgrims today. No reliable description is available of this excavated shrine as it existed before it was subjected to restoration about a hundred years ago. We cannot, therefore, be certain whether the Buddha is rock-cut or of brick and stucco. The priests assert that it is cut out of the rock, and that it dates from the reign of Devanampiya Tissa. As this second claim is manifestly impossible, the first is also open 171</page><page sequence="7">,Iunutunnsi, 1P as-oH puu urW J0 aja3udlnS SuTueuoT : lU o jo asjeq aqi 1e pa3 :A 'punoj aoq u!

The decorative details of the makara-torana at the entrance to the rock-cut shrine are in a style appropriate to the tenth century or later. The capitals of the pillars in the porch also support this conclusion. Flights of stone steps lead to the shrine through an artificial terrace in two stages. In the recent restoration work carried out at the place, a number of sculptured stones collected from here and there have been used in the retaining walls of these terraces. Probably assuming that the sculpture of the man and horse is contemporaneous with the '73</page><page sequence="9">rock-cut shrine, Dr. William Cohn has ascribed it to the twelfth century.7 But, Prof. J. Ph. Vogel8 has pointed out that this sculpture has undoubted affinities with the simple and severe style of Pallava art. It cannot, therefore, be later than the seventh century in date; but may be considerably earlier. It also follows that the rock-cut shrine is several centuries later in date than the sculpture of the man and horse. The site of the sculpture is now called Isurumuni (P. Issarasamana) Vihara, a monastery originally founded by the first Buddhist king of Ceylon, Devanampiya Tissa, in the third century B.C., and subsequently repaired and enlarged in the fifth century by Kassapa 1.9 The old Sinhalese form of the name, Isiramarza, is found in first or second century inscrip- tions engraved on living rocks at the site now called Vessagiri, about a quarter of a mile to the south of the site now called Isurumuni.10 The old Issarasamana Vihara, therefore, is the modern 'Vessagiri', where there are numerous caves with pre-Christian Brahmi inscriptions, in addition to structural remains of later date. It is not possible to take, as Dr. Wickremasinghe has done, that the ancient Issarasamana Vihara extended as far north as to include the modern Isurumuni, (fig. 5) for the boundary wall (prakara) which defined its limits on the north can still be traced on the ground in the rice fields between the two sites. The southern prakara of the establishment, in which was included the rock-boulder containing the sculpture under discussion, can also be traced in the same rice fields some distance away from the northern prakara of the real Issarasamana. The northern boundary wall of our site is 348 yards away from the southern prakara of the Royal Pleasure Garden, the ancient Ranmasu (Gold-fish) Park. The site of our sculpture, therefore, was an ancient establishment between the Royal Park to the north and the Issarasamana Vihara to the south. There is, however, little doubt that it was a Buddhist religious establishment, for apart from the Buddha image in the rock- cut shrine, the summit of one of the boulders was occupied by a small stupa which has now been restored. I shall discuss its identity after giving my views on the subject of the sculpture. 7 Indische Plastik, plate 13 I. 8 Buddhist Art in India, Ceylon and Java, p. 84, See also Ceylon Journal of Science, Section G., Vol. I, p. 96. 9 Mahavamisa, Chap. xx, vv. 14 and 20, Chap. xxxix, vv.

A much weathered bas-relief slab of a 'Man and Horse' has been discovered by Dr. Quaritch Wales at a site named Si Tep (Sri Deva) in Siam1l. In this sculpture, which has been ascribed to the fifth century, the man is standing with his arms akimbo. The horse is to the right of the man, as in the Anuradhapura sculp- ture. Not only the head, but the two forelegs are also shown. The extremely weathered condition of the slab, however, precludes any further comparison of the Siamese 'Man and Horse' with the Anuradhapura example. The association of horse with man is not rare in Indian sculptures which have story-telling for their purpose. Numerous are the scenes in which Prince Siddhartha is shown with the horse Kanthaka. But the attitude of the man in this sculpture does not suggest that it is in 7 . R. A. S. for I946, p. 147 and Plate XVII; Indian Arts and Letters, Vol. X, p. 83. I75</page><page sequence="11">any way connected with this theme of perennial interest to Buddhists. Moreover, its setting and the related sculptures cannot be explained on such a hypothesis. The story of Simihala and the horse named Valaha (cloud) might also suggest itself,12 but the sculpture that we are dealing with does not appear to be narrative in character, but is clearly meant to serve as a sign (nimitta) directing the mind to religious conceptions familiar to the people when it was carved. In Indian religious literature, there is an association of man and horse which, in my opinion, fits in admirably not only with the peculiar characteristics of the composi- tion, but also with the setting of the sculpture and the other figures carved on the same boulder and the adjoining one. In Book I, chapter 3 of the Mahabharata, there is the story of a Brahmin youth named Udafka who was sent by his preceptor's wife on an errand to bring the ear-ornaments belonging to a Ksatriya's wife. Having successfully obtained the coveted article of jewellery, Udanka was returning to his preceptor's abode when the Nagaraja named Taksaka managed to secure it and went with it to the nether world. Udanka rushed after him and, in the nether world, saw a vision of two women weaving a cloth on a loom with black and white thread. The wheel of the loom had twelve spokes and was being revolved by six boys. By the side of the loom was a man mounted on a horse. Udafika, by the favour of Indra whom he praised at this vision, managed to get back the ear-ornament and returned to his teacher who explained the meaning of the vision as follows: The two women are the creator gods Dhatr and Vidhatr, the black threads represent the night, white threads the day. The wheel is the year, its twelve spokes being the twelve months. The six boys revolving it are the six seasons. And, what is germane to our present purpose, 'the man- he is Parjanya, the horse-he is Agni'.13 Parjanya, it may be mentioned, is the personification of the Rain-cloud; Agni, of course, is Fire or Heat. The story itself is an allegory which must have originated among an agricultural people to whom the calendar, with its regular rotation of the seasons and, above all, rain and heat in their proper seasons, were of vital importance. And Parjanya, if we take him to be the man on the rock at 'Isurumuni', has a vital role to play in replenishing, in 12 Divyavadana, edited by Cowell and Neil, pp. 523-8. See also Valahassa Jataka, _ataka, translation, Vol. II, p. 89. 13 Yah purusah sa Parjanyah, yo'svas so'gnik. 176</page><page sequence="12">its proper season, the reservoir by the side of which he is shown with his benevolent gaze fixed on the rice fields in front of him. No less important is the function of Agni, if that god is represented by the horse, in making the seeds to germinate and the rice crop to ripen in due season. The identification of the Man and Horse with Parjanya and Agni, taking the Mahabhairata as our authority, thus fits in very well with the setting of the sculpture: but would Parjanya have been at home in ancient Anuradhapura? Parjanya4 was a deity honoured among the Indo-Aryans from the earliest times, but he never succeeded in securing for himself a position of pre-eminence, only three hymns being exclusively dedicated to him in the Rg-veda.15 His functions were included in those of Indra and, when we come to epic times, his identity is often merged in that of the latter. The relative position of the two gods in the epics has been summarised by Hopkins in the following words: 'Parjanya is, in short, the rain-form of Indra, though given a distinct personality.' 'In short, Parjanya is the bucolic Indra, chief god of ploughmen, but the greater province remains Indra's.'16 In the Pali Buddhist literature, the god is referred to by the slightly different name of Pajjunna, and is treated as a deity distinct from, but subordinate to, Indra. The mythology of Parjanya seems to have developed between the Vedic and the Buddhist periods; for, in the Samyutta Nikaya17, two of his daughters, Kokanada (Lily) and Culla-Kokanada (Little Lily) visit the Buddha. The younger of the two daughters of Parjanya is apparently the deity, named Culakoka-devata, represented on the southern gate at Bharhut. The statue of Mahakoka-devata, inside the temple at Pathora, is probably a representation of her elder sister. s The names, no doubt, were in popular vogue in an abbreviated form. There are several references to Pajjunna, and his function of bestowing rain, in the canonical as well as in the exegetical literature of the Theravada Buddhists. Buddhaghosa identifies him with Vassa-valahaka (Rain-cloud) generally referred to as a devaputta. 9 To that great Congress 14 Parjanya is said to be the same as Perkunas, the highest god of the Slavo-Lithuanians. 15 For Parjanya, see Macdonell, Vedic Mythology, pp. 83-85 and Ragozin, Vedic India, pp. 205-209. 16 Hopkins, Epic Mythology, p. 128. 17 P.

Pajjunna and Vassa-valahaka. 177</page><page sequence="13">of Celestials held in the forest near Kapilavatthu, 'Pajjunna came thundering'20 to pay his meed of honour to the Buddha. As the text dealing with this Congress-the Mahasamaya- sutta-is one of the 'protective discourses' (paritta) often recited to the laity, the name of Pajjunna must have been quite familiar to the Buddhists of old, laymen as well as bhikkhus. The Mahavamisa relates a story in which the petition of an old woman inconvenienced by the vagaries of the weather reached as far as Sakka (Indra). That Ruler of the Universe, thereupon, summoned Pajjunna and ordered him to see that it rained in due season only.21 In the commentary, Pajjunna is called a king of gods (deva-raja). 22 References to Parjanya (Pajjunna or Padum) are not wanting in Sinhalese literature. In the Sinhalese glossary (circa 12th century) of the Pali Kankhavitaranz, the word deva, occuring in the phrase deve vas- sante (when the god was raining), is rendered by Pajjunna. 23 The word devo in the phrase devo sammla pavassatu occuring in the Pali Maha-bodhivamsa has been explained by the Sinhalese glossary as Meghaya-tema (the Cloud). 24 Pajjunna and Megha were thus held to be synonymous and were equivalent to deva, at least where rain was concerned. In agreement with this, the Ruvanmala (v. 55), a Sinhalese lexicon of the 1 th century, gives padum (Skt. Parjanya) and dev (Skt. deva) in a list of synonyms meaning 'cloud'. In Sanskrit itself, the word deva does not have the meaning of 'cloud'. The Kdvyasekhara, a Sinhalese poem of the 15th century, eulogises a king in the following words: 'When king Padum (Parjanya) in the form of that king was raining down showers in the form of liberal gifts, the high em- bankments called excessive greed in the reservoirs which are the hearts of the poor burst asunder.'25 It is noteworthy that Parjanya is here referred to as a 'king'. In addition to what the Sinhalese Buddhists of old learnt about Parjanya (Pajjunna) from 20 Thanayaizm aga Pajjunno yo disa abhivassati, DZgha Nikdya, P. T. S.

I78</page><page sequence="14">the Pali texts, this god appears to have been a part of the heritage that they brought with them when they originally came from North India and settled down in this Island. The personal names figuring in the earliest Brahmi inscriptions (3rd century B. C. to i st century A. D.) give some indication of the gods whom the Sinhalese were wont to honour before they embraced Buddhism. In an inscription at Baimbaragala26 in the Kandy District, figures a local ruler (raja) with the name or title Pocani; two epigraphs at Ambulaiibe in the Matale District refer to a Pacina-raja. The names Pocani and Pacina can stand for Sanskrit Parjanya and Pali Pajjunna. It may, however, be objected that the mention of Parjanya's name in Pali and Sinhalese literature does not necessarily constitute proof for the existence of a cult of that deity, and that such a cult ought to have prevailed in Ceylon in the past if an ancient sculpture is to be taken as a representation of the god. Happily, we are in a position to establish that Parjanya did receive the homage of the ancient Sinhalese, for in a tenth century Sinhalese inscription, there is a reference to the invocation of Parjanya, and that too in association with Agni, just as in the Mahabharata, though it has not hitherto been recognised as such. The slab inscription of Kassapa V (908-918) found in the precincts of the old Abhayagiri (now mis-called Jetavana) Vihara at Anuradhapura,27 in recounting the benevolent deeds of that monarch, states that he made agriculture (lit., 'work in the fields') productive (lit., 'advantageous'). The means adopted by the king to bring about this desired end is stated by a complex compound podon-avulu-pulunzdavuluyen, formed of words occuring nowhere else in Sinhalese epigraphy or literature. Dr. Wickremasinghe, who edited this inscription, probably guided by the consideration of the ways in which the state today comes to the aid of agriculture, took this compound as embodying the names of two irrigation works. But the usual manner in which the epigraphs and the chronicles record activities of kings in providing irrigation facilities is by stating that a reservoir or a channel was constructed, not by merely giving the proper names of reservoirs in the instrumental case, as has been done in this instance, if we take the compound as interpreted by Dr. Wickremasinghe. In the Sinhalese language of the tenth century, the names of reservoirs almost invariably have the 26 Annual Report of the Archaeological Survey of Ceylon for 1935, p. Io. 27 Epigraphia Zeylanica, Vol. I, pp. 41-57. 179</page><page sequence="15">element va or viya (Skt.vap) which is wanting in the compound under discussion. Moreover, the statement that the king made agriculture productive by the action indicated in the expres- sion podon-avulu-pulundavuluyen is given as the cause of the two next statements that the Is- land of Lahmk was 'made to sprout'28 and that the fear of famine was dispelled. These conditions of prosperity and the absence of a fear of famine throughout the whole land could not have been brought about by the construction of two irrigation reservoirs. The names of the two irrigation reservoirs which Dr.Wickremasingha has extracted from this compound do not occur in the hundreds of names of such works forthcoming in the chronicles, and the ancient names of almost all the major irrigation works in the Island are known. It is unlikely that the construction of a small reservoir would have been recorded in the inscription as having contributed to the 'sprouting of Larka'. We have, therefore, to reject Dr.Wickremasinghe's interpretation of this compound and seek for one more satisfying. Podon, the first element of the compound, can be taken as the equivalent in Sinhalese of Skt. Parjanya, through the Middle Indian Pajjunna, preserved in Pali. Avulu, in my opinion, is derived from Skt. dhviana or havana, and means 'invocation'. A variant form of the word is aivili found in the Sigiri graffiti. 29 The first half of the com- pound would thus mean 'invocation of Parjanya' by which means it is quite appropriate to say that the Island of Lamka was made 'to sprout'. Of the rest of the compound, Pulun- davuluyen, the last element -yen is the termination of the instrumental case which also refers to the first half, Podon-avulu. Pulundadvulu has to be broken up as Pulunda and avulu. Avulu has already been dealt with. Pulun.da, in my opinion, is the same as Skt. plostr 'the consumer', i. e. Fire (Agni). The phonological changes by which Skt. plostr would assume the form of pulun.dd in Sinhalese can be exemplified by words of which the etymology is beyond doubt. The Skt. root plus, of which plostr is a derivative, is represented in Sinhalese by words like pulussana and pulutu, which are very common in the mouths of the people today. If the above interpretation of the words in question be accepted, the epigraph referred to can be taken as recording that Kassapa V caused public celebrations of the worship of Parjanya and Agni, with the productivity of agriculture as the purpose to be achieved. 28 Siri-Lak londurvay. Wickremasinghe has also not understood this phrase. 29 Graffito No. 370 in the forthcoming Volume entitled S&amp;giri Graffiti. 18o</page><page sequence="16">The 'sprouting' of the land, i. e. the vegetation thereon, and the removal of anxiety on the score of food, are precisely the purposes for which Parjanya was invoked by the early Indo-Aryans, whose culture was transplanted into Ceylon and has had an evolution con- tinuing up to the present day. One of the singers of the Rg-veda, for instance, has addressed the god in these words: 'Thou hast shed rain: now wholly cease; thou hast made the deserts passable again. Thou hast made the plants to grow for the sake of food; and thou hast found a hymm of praise from (thy) creatures." 80 This similarity in the aims to be achieved lends support to the interpretation of Podon, occuring in the tenth century Sinhalese inscription, as Parjanya, based on philological grounds. We now proceed to consider whether the location of the sculpture and its peculiar characteristics are consonant with the identification proposed above. It has already been stated that the site now called Isurumuni Vihara is situated between the ancient monastery of that name to the south and the Royal Pleasure Garden to the north. The Sinhalese glossary of the Mahabodhivamsa furnishes us with a clue to the identity of the site. This text relates the land-marks of the consecrated boundary of ancient Anuradhapura, as fixed by Devanampiya Tissa in the third century B. C., with the topography of the city in or about the tenth century. Between the Dakkhina Thupa and a path leading from the eastern gate of the Royal Pleasure Garden, a bathing pond which belonged to a Met-giri-vehera is referred to in the course of this topographical survey. 31 The pond in question, therefore, must have been situated not far from the rock containing the sculpture that we are dis- cussing, and the vihdra to which the pond belonged could very well have been the site now called Isurumuni, for, apart from the ancient Isurumuni (now miscalled Vessagiri), there is no other site in the locality bearing ancient remains of any significance. Old Sinhalese Met-giri would be equivalent to Metta-giri in Pali, which is very unlikely to have been the name of a Buddhist religious establishment. No such name occurs anywhere 30 Avarsir varsdm ud u su grbhdya, dkar dhdnvini dtietava u Ajzjana bsadhir bhojanaya kam, utdprajabhyo avido mansam Rg-veda, V, 83, 10. The translation given above is that of R. A. Macdonell in his Vedic Reader for Students, Oxford, I917, p. 10o. 31 Mahabodhivaisa-granthipada-vivaranaya, op. cit., p. I34. i8i</page><page sequence="17">in the historical writings of Ceylon. The form Met-giri found in the printed edition of the text is very likely due to a copyist's error,82 and the most probable emendation of the reading is Mey-giri, the Pali equivalent of which would be Megha-giri (Cloud-Rock). A vihdra of this name is mentioned in the Dthiavahmsa.33 It was there that the Tooth-Relic, when it was first brought to Ceylon, found a refuge before it received royal recognition. The Dathavamsa, however, refers to Megha-giri Vihara as located to the north of the city of Anuradhapura, whereas the modern 'Isurumuni' is to the south. A tenth-century pillar inscription found at the modern Kiribat Vehera, to the north of Anuradhapura, refers to a garden belonging to Uturme-giri34 (= P. Uttaramegha-giri), presumably close to the spot where the inscribed stone was originally set up. It is, therefore, certain that a Megha- giri existed in the tenth century to the north of the city of Anuradhapura, but the fact that this shrine had Utur, meaning 'northern', prefixed to its name, indicates that there was another, probably earlier, Megha-giri in the vicinity of the capital. This inference is sup- ported by the Sinhalese Daladd-sirita, dating from the 14th century, which deals with the history of the Tooth-Relic, but is independent of the Pali Ddthavainsa. The Daladt-sirita 5 records that the Megha-giri Vihara, the first resting place of the Tooth-Relic in Ceylon, was in the Mahamegha Park which we know was to the south of Anuradhapura. It was in the Mahamegha Park that the Bodhi tree was planted. The modern 'Isurumuni' is a little over half a mile to the south of the Bodhi tree. The ancient Isurumuni, immediately to the south of the present 'Isurumuni', is stated in a tenth-century inscription to have been in the Mahamegha-vana. 36 The present 'Isurumuni' was, therefore, within the limits of the Maha- megha-vana, as the Meghagiri Vihara was. The existence of a monastery named Meghagiri (Cloud-Rock) in the park named Maha- megha (Great Cloud) is significant. The Mahamegha-vana, we learn from the Mahavamsa, 7 was inaugurated by Mutasiva, the father of Devanampiya Tissa in whose reign the Tisaviava was constructed and Buddhism adopted as the state religion in the 3 rd century B. C. The 32 Manuscripts of the Sinhalese glossary of the Mahabodhivamsa are very rare and generally corrupt. 33 Dathavamnsa, Canto V, vv. 7 and 13. 34 Epigraphia Zeylanica, Vol. I, p.

It is, therefore, clear that the establishment of the park was not dictated purely by aesthetic considerations. The primary duty of the ruler of an agricultural com- munity in those early days--the ensuring of rain in due season by the performance of appropriate ritual as laid down by tradition -must have been one of the reasons, if not the main reason, which urged Mutasiva to establish the Mahamegha-vana in the vicinity of his capital city. And the Megha-giri (Cloud-Rock) in that park must have played a prominent part in the ritual. Now, in the earliest religious literature of the Indo-Aryans (of whom the ancient Sinhalese were an offshoot, at least culturally), the Cloud is symbolised as a rock and the shattering of the cloud-rocks was the function which the storm- and rain-gods, in particular Indra, were excepted to perform, for the benefit of humanity, in return for the oblations offered to them at the sacrifice. The position has been admirably summarised by Ragozin in these words: 'There is nothing a solid bank of clouds with its broken outlines against the horizon more resembles, and many a mariner longingly looking out for land has been deceived by this mirage of the sea. These castles, these mountains with their deep, dark caves, are the fastnesses wherein wicked robbers hide the stolen cows or maidens, over whom the dragon cloud-fiend, Ahi, the Serpent, who loves to lie on the top of mountains, and the shaggy monster, Vritra, the Enfolder, keep watch, until the Thunderer's lightning spear pierces and tears them to pieces, while the castle walls or mountain sides burst open under the resonant blows of his fiery mace, and the captives come forth.'89 This drama in the at- mosphere, giving us rain, is one of the main themes of Vedic poets. In the Nighantu, the words adri, giri and parvata, meaning 'mountain' or 'rock', are given as synonyms of megha, 'cloud'. 40 The identification of 'cloud' with 'rock' is not unknown to the later epic literature. A sage named Narada-Parvata, 'water-giving rock', is represented as the main source of communication between Heaven and Earth, and as fomenting quarrels and creating much mischief in his constant coming and going between the two spheres. In 38 Naminuga-gunoditam. 39 Ragozin, Vedic India, London, 1923, p. I95. 40 Jaska's Nirukta samt den Nighantavas, Gottingen, I852, pp. 6-7. I83</page><page sequence="19">some places Narada ('Cloud') and Parvata ('Mountain' or 'Rock') are represented as two different sages, almost inseparable, but at times quarrelling with each other,4 for strife and music are the two subjects in which Narada has specialised. The word for cloud in modern Sinhalese is vala-kula which means 'cloud-rock' or 'cloud-mountain'. The identification of 'cloud' with 'rock' is not a peculiarity of the Indian mind. The English word 'cloud' is derived from the Anglo-Saxon clud, meaning 'rock' or 'hillock'. Now, if invocations of the Cloud, or any ceremonies of the nature of imitative or sym- pathetic magic with rain-making as their aim, were conducted in the ancient Mahamegha Park of Anuradhapura in pre-Buddhist times, as seems very likely, the Megha-giri in that park must have been the locality particularly set apart for such purposes. And, in the area which we can consider as having constituted the Mahamegha Park, there is no cluster of rock boulders more impressive than that at the modem 'Isurumuni' Vihara, on one of which is carved the figure that we have identified as Parjanya. Originally, the rock by itself would have been the Megha-giri. 'In the pre-logical age, as we have seen, art could not be clearly separated from nature; a natural stone would serve the purpose of a work of art just as well as a sculptured one.'"2 The worship of natural rock- boulders is a practice that can still be observed in Ceylon. A solitary boulder on the em- bankment of the reservoir called Periyakulam near Nilavali in the Trincomalee District receives offerings as the guardian of the adjoining rice fields. In many villages of the Kurunagala District, a deity called Gale-deiyo (the god of the rock) or Gale-bandara (lord of the rock) is propitiated by the peasants. All this worship of rocks probably had its origin in Vedic religion, wherein the rock was conceived as identical with the water-giving cloud. Early Buddhist texts contain references to the worship of rocks and other natural phenomena. 4S Such practices are condemned as inefficacious and not beneficial as going to the Buddha for refuge. But the efforts of the early Buddhists to discourage such practices 41 W. Hopkins, Epic Mythology, p. I88. 42 Herbert Read, Art and Society, London, Faber and Faber, 1947, p. 47. 43 Bahuim ve saranam yanti pabbatdni vandni ca Ardma-rukkha-cetyani manussa bhaya-tajjitd The Commentary on the Dhammapada, P.

The existence of a vihara at the Megha- giri of Anuradhapura seems to indicate that the samgha in Ceylon had to come to terms with these pre-Buddhist practices. A large number of the lay-supporters of the saingha would have been at least as concerned with a plentiful harvest in the immediate present as they were with heaven and final liberation in the hereafter. They would have been slow to give up their faith in the rites and performances which, for many generations, had been observed by their forefathers and were considered efficacious in the achievement of the desired end of seasonal rainfall. Provided that such rites did not involve the slaughtering of animals and other practices repugnant to Buddhist sentiment, the bhikkbus, in the past, in order to retain the support of the lay community, might have tolerated ceremonies con- nected with the water-giving rock, just as their counter-parts of today instal the images of Hindu gods within shrines dedicated to the Buddha. The inscription in which it has been approvingly recorded that a Sinhalese Buddhist king of the tenth century ensured the productivity of agriculture by invoking Parjanya (the Rain-cloud) was set up in a Buddhist monastery. If the Meghagiri-vihara, as we have surmised, specialised in rain-making ceremonies, that would also explain why the royal couple from Kaliiiga who came to Ceylon with the Tooth-Relic in the fifth century thought that they would be sure of a welcome in that establishment. The Tooth-Relic has always been credited with the power of causing rain; and, on that account, its possession was jealously retained by royalty. Even before it was brought to Ceylon, its reputation for efficacy in rain-making must have reached this Island, and the persons who brought it here would have, in the first instance, thought of an institution where this aspect of its appeal to the people would have received due considera- tion. Precisely for that reason, it was appropriated by the king; but the orthodox Mahavihara at Anuradhapura, during the seven centuries it remained at that city, does not seem to have been enthusiastic about it. It was to the heterodox Abhayagiri Vihara that the Tooth-Relic was annually taken from the royal palace and exibited to the populace. In course of time, the primitive imagery of the rock itself representing the cloud seems to have been dimmed in the minds of the people, and it became necessary to have recourse to art in order to justify the appellation of Meghagiri applied to the rock. It was probably for I85</page><page sequence="21">this purpose that the figures of elephants were carved at the base of the rock. For, in later Indian religious literature, the elephant symbolises the rain-cloud. The elephant of Indra, Airavana, is the personification of the rain-cloud. 'Airavana draws up water from the under-world for Indra to rain, evidently from irdvat as the nourishing rain-cloud and its lightning stroke; whence airavatas are lightning clouds.'4 In classical Sanskrit poetry, the comparison of clouds to elephants is very common. In Kalidasa's Meghad7ta (v. 2), the cloud on the peak of a mountain appeared to the exiled yaksa like an elephant sporting on a rampart. Whether the figures of elephants in the round at the base of the rock at 'Isuru- muni' were carved at the same time as the man and horse, it is not possible to say. They appear to represent a more archaic phase of art than that of the man and horse. But the presence of these elephant figures gives support to the identification of the man as Parjanya and to the views detailed above with regard to the identity of the site. The sculpture of the man and horse, assuming that they represent Parjanya and Agni, was intended to indicate, to one familiar with the religious lore of the period, that the rock on which they are carved was a Cloud-rock (Megha-giri), even more explicitly than the figures of elephants. The anthropomorphism of Parjanya was less developed than that of most other Indian gods, and the word often means the rain-cloud itself. The god, therefore, was the spirit of the cloud and hardly had an existence outside it. The artist has deliberately attempted to emphasise this fact in the manner he has carved the figure of the man--being seated on the rock itself, the back of the throne being slightly indicated behind the left shoulder, the two hands and the left foot being left unfinished, merging into the rock, and the entire figure being in a recess and not standing out of the rock. The impression that the artist has striven to create is that the figure of the man is growing out of the rock, as if the Spirit of the cloud, i. e. of the rock, had manifested himself to his votaries in human form, but has not fully divested himself of the element in which he has his being. The manner in which the horse has been shown in the sculpture is quite in keeping with the relation of Agni to Parjanya, as we gather from Indian religious literature. Parjanya, being the Rain-cloud, represents water; and, in the Vedic and epic literature, it is in the water that Agni (Fire), particularly that form of Agni representing lightning, was believed 44 Hopkins, Epic Mythology, p. 127. I86</page><page sequence="22">to originate. 45 Agni Vaisvanara, conceived as a horse, was regarded as the vehicle not only of Parjanya but also ofIndra. In the hymn to Indra uttered by the Brahmin youth Udamka, when he saw the vision of Parjanya and Agni as Man and Horse, we read: 'To him who is accompanied by the vehicle, the horse Vaisvanara (Fire), which is the ancient embryo of the Waters, to that Purandara, the Lord of the Universe and the Sovereign of the three worlds, let there be constant salutation.'46 Agni being the embryo of the Waters (garbham apam), the horse symbolising Agni must be in the interior of the Cloud-rock and not visible. The artist, therefore, has shown the horse as coming out from the bowels of the rock, the head alone having emerged. The god has manifested just enough of his form for his votaries to recognise him. The association of Parjanya and Agni goes back to Vedic times, for the two deities are lauded together in two verses of one hymn of the Rg-veda (VI, 52). 47 The Mahabharata bears witness to the joint worship of Parjanya and Agni Vaisvanara. 'That Fire which is honoured with the foremost of oblations, on the festival of the four-month seasons, in the company of Parjanya, is the illustrious Vaisvanara.'48 The carving in low relief, at the base of the second boulder, of the head and uplifted trunk of an elephant and the tail of another, together with lotus leaves and buds, in my opinion, has to be interpreted in relation to the sculpture of the Man and Horse, high up on the boulder adjoining it. The latter being Parjanya and Agni, the elephants and lotus leaves illustrate the effects of the manifesta- tion of these two divinities. With the upturned trunk, one elephant is pouring water on its own body; of the other, only the lifted tail has been shown, the body being assumed to be immersed in the water. The elephants, therefore, are sporting in the water. As these carv- ings actually rise from the water in the pond, the effects of Parjanya's activity are very 45 See Macdonell, Vedic Mythology, p. 92 and Hopkins, Epic Mythology, pp. 85 and 92. 46 Yo vajinan garbham apim puranam Vaisvanaram vahanam abhyupetah Namah sada'smaijagadi-varaya Lokatrayesaya Purandaraya.

I87</page><page sequence="23">realistically shown. The god has carried out his function of causing rain to fall. His ap- pearance in person high up on the adjoining boulder, evidently, had not been in vain. Parjanya not only sheds rain, but also 'places seed in the plants as a germ'. The 'seed', really, is the Fire which is the 'embryo of the waters'. 'In the rain, Fire descends not upon but into the ground, and thence rises into the plants as sap and life.'49 The beneficial activity of Agni, who has manifested himself in the form of the horse, has been indicated by the lotus leaf and bud. Thus, it would be seen that the location of the sculpture, its peculiar characteristics and the other carvings on this boulder and the adjoining one, all gain significance through the identification of the figure of the man with Parjanya and the horse with Agni. The pose maharaja-lUla, in which the figure is portrayed, is appropriate to Parjanya who in Sinhalese writings is referred to as a 'king'-raja or deva-raja. The arched cavity on the northern boulder is perhaps meant to represent an actual cave. The cloud-rock is often described in poetic descriptions as having caves. In the course of this enquiry we have often appealed to the Mahabharata. In justification of this procedure, we may point out that some of the religious beliefs reflected in the earlier parts of that great epic were current among the early Sinhalese, as we have found in tracing the origin of Upulvan, the Sinhalese national god (vide, Vol. VI of the Memoirs of the Archaeological Survey of Ceylon, pp. 25 ff.). Moreover, the religious beliefs which have been given plastic representation in this sculpture seem also to underlie the concepts regarding the institution of kingship which prevailed among the Sinhalese during the period to which it can be ascribed. From the evidence of the inscriptions, coupled with data gathered from the chronicles, we know that, from the ninth to twelfth centuries, two throne names were borne alternatively by Sinhalese kings. One of these is Siri-sangha-bodhi (Sinhalese Sirisangabo and variant forms), the Buddhist significance of which is quite apparent. The other is Sila- meghavanna (Sin. Sala-me-van and variant forms).50 I have elsewhere shown that vanna in this title stands for Skt. Varuna; 5 the full title is thus a compound meaning 'Rock-Cloud- Varuna'. Sometimes, it is shortened to Megha-vanna, sometimes to Sil-megha, the latter '9 Ragozin, Vedic India, p. 162. 50 Epigraphia Zeylanica, Vol. II, p. 9. 51 Memoirs of the Archaeological Survey of Ceylon, Vol. VI, pp. 54 ff. i88</page><page sequence="24">meaning 'Rock-Cloud', of which the identity with Megha-giri 'Cloud-Rock' needs no stressing. Though the evidence for the regular use of this title is available only for the period between the eighth and the twelfth centuries, the chronicles have sporadic references to kings who bore these epithets in periods much earlier. The earliest ruler who bore the title of Megha-vanna (Cloud-Varuna) was Gothabhaya52 (circa 309-322), while the epithet Sila- megha-vanna (Rock-Cloud-Varuna), in its Sinhalese form of Salamevan, has been applied to Silakala (circa 529-542).53 In the Mahavamsa, the title Silamegha (Rock-Cloud) occurs for the first time in connection with Aggabodhi VI (72 -76 ). 5 The last king who had the title of Salamevan was Parikramabahu VI ( 1410-1467). 5 Half a century before Silakala, who bore a title containing in it the elements of 'Rock' and 'Cloud', Kassapa I built a magnificent palace on the top of a wellnigh unscalable rock, the steep side of which was adorned with the figures of females, some fair, others dark, rising from clouds-possibly representations of 'Cloud- Maidens' and 'Lightning Princesses' referred to in the commentary of the Mahavainsa.56 Royal names compounded of 'Rock' and 'Cloud' were not a speciality of Ceylon. About the fifth century, South India was ruled by a dynasty called the Kalabhras who had a bad reputation among the orthodox Brahmins, but are referred to with respect by a Buddhist writer.57 The name Kalabhra, if we read the dental for the lingual /,58 can be analysed as Tamil kal, 'rock' and Skt. abbra, 'cloud'. It thus corresponds to the title Sildmegha borne by Sinhalese kings. These royal titles must have originated through the ancient conception of king as 'rain-maker', identifying him with the cloud conceived as a divinity. It is also interesting to note that in the title Sild-megha-vanna ( Varuna), the three factors or divine forces which co-operate in the phenomenon of rain are so arranged as to convey one from the material to the immaterial, and from the proximate to the remote. The Rock or Mountain conceived to be identical with the Cloud, is not only material but is also near to man. Apart from its being symbolically identified with the Cloud, it attracts the Cloud 52 Mahavarmsa, Chap. xxxvi, v. 98. 53 Epigraphia Zeylanica, Vol. III, p. 80 and Nikaya Sangraha, C.M. Fernando's translation, Colombo, I908, p. 16. 54 Mahavarmsa, Chap. xlviii, v. 42. 55 Prakumbasirita, v. 80. 56 See India Antiqua, Leyden, 1947, pp. 264-269. 57 K. A. Nilakanta Sastri, The Co/as, Vol. I, p. 121. 58 The name occurs only in ancient inscriptions which very often have the lingual I where the standard Tamil usage prescribes the dental. i89</page><page sequence="25">as a matter of fact. The Cloud is less material and more remote than the Rock, but is brought nearer to man by the Rock. The last of the three component words in this com- pound, Varuna, is the personification of Heaven,59 or the encompassing Sky, in which clouds move about, and from which rain falls down. It is the least material and the remotest of the three, but was the first to be deified by primitive man, for it was to Varuna that the ancient Indo-Aryans prayed for rain before other gods like Indra usurped his sovereignty.60 The king was thus the intermediary between Heaven and Earth. Parjanya, being the spirit of the Rain-cloud, may be considered as identical with 'Megha' in these royal titles. But, in Sanskrit writings, 'Megha' does not actually occur as a name of Parjanya. The Harivamsa61 refers to Meghan (plural) regarded as divinities distinct from Parjanya. But, it has been shown above that in Sinhalese writings, Parjanya and Megha are interchangeable. The ancient belief in India was that the king was an embodiment of Indra. In a hymn to Indra in the Mahabhrata, in which that god is lauded as the Supreme Being and identified with a number of other gods, we read: 'Thou art, verily, Megha' and 'Thou art King (raja)'62. Megha in the Sinhalese royal title may thus identify the king with Indra or with Parjanya. But the Sinhalese Buddhists conceived Indra as the Ruler of the Universe who exercised the function of bestowing rain through a deputy. And that deputy, as we have seen, is Parjanya (Pajjunna), who is called 'King' in the Kavyasekhara, already referred to. In the Pujaval, 63 a Sinhalese work of the 13 th century, the Rain-cloud is referred to as 'King' (Megha-raja).64 Megha in the Sinhalese royal title may, therefore, be taken to mean Parjanya. If our identification of the 'Man and Horse' is found tenable, it is per- missible to conjecture that this sculpture was not unconnected with the above royal titles borne by Sinhalese kings, and we may visualise to ourselves solemn functions performed in the presence of the seated figure, now brooding in his neglected state, when the rulers of Ceylon publicly assumed such titles. 59 Macdonell, Vedic Mythology, p. 27. 60 Macdonell, Vedic Mythology, p. i66 and Ragozin, Vedic India, p. 202-205. 61 Harivamsa, Chitrafala Press, Poona, 1936, pp. 5 ff. 62 Tvam eva Meghah (Mbh., I, 21, 9); tvarm raja (Mbh., I, 21, 12). 63 Pijavalz, 34th Chapter, edited by Rev.
