<plain_text><page sequence="1">Common ground, a naturalist's Cape Cod.-R. Finch. 1981. Boston, David R. Godine Publishers. xi + 142 pp. $12.95.-This series of essays de- scribes scenes, experiences, and images of plants and animals encountered on Cape Cod. They represent a personal view of the dynamic aspect of nature on the Cape. The 32 essays cover such diverse creatures as cormorants, juncos, owls, gannets, whales, moths, and foxes, and describe the typical habitats such as marshes, woods, and the open beaches. Scientifically, the facts are generally correct. But more importantly, his inferences and musings ac- curately reflect nature. Descriptions of the plumage patterns of birds, the behavior of owls disturbed by humans, and the life cycles of various animals are correct. His knowledge is far-ranging, from refer- ences to loon fossils to descriptions of the population cycles of lemmings in the far north. In describing plants, animals, and the environment, he discusses several rather sophisticated concepts, such as pop- ulation dynamics, relationships of predators and prey, effects of man on population numbers, tide cycles, erosion, and shore-line dynamics. He handles such topics well, mixing fact with impressions to make these topics understandable and interesting. The au- thor usually avoids being anthropomorphic, al- though his description of ants seeking a solution to their plight of being caught-on a burning log in his fireplace (pp. 89-90) is both anthropomorphic and a bit sadistic (or, at the least, too realistic). Several species and themes run throughout the book. Gulls and terns recur in several essays, al- though they are not the main topic of any one essay. Man's significant effect on specific organisms and man's insignificant effect on the nature of the Cape itself are frequently intermingled in the same essay. In his essay on foxes preying on tems, Finch dis- cusses the value of both animals, stressing the plea- sures of seeing a family of foxes among the dunes. He asks the question, How many tems is it worth to see a family of foxes? This is a question managers frequently ask, and one that requires an answer. Throughout the book Finch clearly describes his own sense of insignificance against the cold, wind, and starkness of the Cape. Some essays seem to confirm the universality of our feelings toward the unrelent- ing nature of Cape Cod. From my perspective, the book would be more en- joyable with detailed maps of the Cape and the places Finch describes. It is not possible for a casual visitor to the Cape to locate the places that Finch describes. This series of essays would be particularly enjoyable for anyone who has spent any time along the coast and is familiar with marine and estuarine organisms. But I suspect it would also be useful for any natu- ralist. It is well written and easy to understand, and is thus suitable for any age group. It is not written for professional ornithologists, but for naturalists. I found it fun to compare my impressions with his. Thus I would recommend it as pleasant reading for cold, winter evenings.-J.
