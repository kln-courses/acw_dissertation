<plain_text><page sequence="1">Man, Morals and History. By CHESTER C. McCowN. New York: Harper &amp; Brothers. Pp. xvii + 350 + 15 illustrations. $5.00. McCown was one of the foremost scholars of his generation in the field of the Near East. Not only was he eminent in New Testa- ment studies, which was his subject as professor in the Pacific School of Religion, but he was a distinguished archeologist, familiar with the culture of Palestine from the earliest times. He participated in excavations during terms as fellow, professor, and director of the American School of Oriental Research, Jerusalem, and produced the monumental two-volume report on Tell en-Nasbeh. After his retirement in 1947 he continued his activities, one of which was the writing of a book which sets forth his credo regarding the meaning and value of the archeological, linguistic, and historical information which has come from explora- tion, excavation, and study of the ancient civilizations around the eastern end of the Mediterranean. The sub-title of the volume is "Today's Legacy from Ancient Times and Biblical Peoples." At the time of his unexpected death at the age of eighty-one on January 11, 1958, "he was in the process of reviewing certain editorial changes which had been suggested by the publisher." This task was completed by Dr. John H. Otwell and Mrs. Beatrice McCown Mattison. In the preface McCown makes clear his belief "that the experience of the past gives mankind reason for hope in the future, a hope that is not mere wishful thinking." His work "is not a theological treatise but a historical sketch of human achievements." He recognizes "order, meaning, and purpose in the universe." He acknowledges his indebtedness to Alfred North Whitehead in phildsophy, to A. L. Kroeber and R. E. Lowrie in anthropology, to W. F. Albright in chronology, and to R. H. Pfeiffer in some Old Testament criticism. The chronological tables, by the way, are one of the most valuable features of the book. History is taken to commence not at the appearance of writing and metal but at the beginning of the earth. So there is discussion of theories regarding the formation of the earth, the development of life, and the appearance of man, who "originated in Africa or Central Asia, possibly in both." But Paleolithic man has been found in Palestine and that little land "has more to offer and has been more intensively studied over a longer period of time than any similar area." The study, however, is not confined to Palestine but must take into account the contiguous countries which developed their particular cultures and contributed to the material and spiritual development of this little territory. The author, taking the Holy Grail as a pattern, uses the figure of a vessel consisting of an inner and an outer cup. The inner cup is Palestine itself and the outer cup the surrounding nations. In Part 1 there is treated the story from the beginning of time to the age of Ham- murabi. It is not a mere catalog of events, but an interpretation of the effects that the developments produced on the people who emerged as the Hebrews. After the ice age there was prehistoric savagery, then pre- historic barbarism, and then the first city. The book was written before Miss Kenyon's last season at Jericho and so Jarmo is called "the earliest available village" in the Fertile Crescent. Now that in the 1957-58 excavation Miss Kenyon went down several levels before what was previously uncovered, it appears that Jericho has claims on being the first site as yet discovered where man built houses and lived in an organized community. Except for pushing back the date of the plastered-floor stage, these new findings cause no serious alteration in the general picture.</page><page sequence="2">BOOK REVIEWS 139 Another minor correction may be made. On page 41, in the discussion of the mineral products of Palestine is the statement, "There is no marble." Recently marble has been found in Palestine and a busy factory in Amman turns out marble slabs for build- ings and furniture. But this development is new. Part 2 traces the course of the Hebrew people from their emergence in Palestine to the time of the destruction of the Second Temple in A.D. 70. They are considered to have entered Canaan some time in the fourteenth century and it is taken for granted that they were in some measure the same as the Khabiru or cApiru. Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and Jacob's twelve sons may be taken as historical characters, "not merely historical names." And a plausible theory is that an important part of the nation was for some generations in the eastern delta of the Nile, possibly at the time of Akhenaton, and brought out with them a protomonotheism. In Part 3 McCown's discussion of Hebrew monotheism is interesting and pertinent. While he ignores the theory of logical development from animism to monotheism, he sees different conceptions influenced by various factors. Unlike Greek monotheism it was not philosophical but the result of organic thinking, with relation to the idea of Covenant and Chosen People. "If Moses was a monotheist, it mattered little to the rest of the people. Amos is the first datable evidence for the type of thinking that logically and organically suggests mono- theism." Not until the time of the Gospels is there evidence that monotheism was the accepted belief of the majority of the Jews. It is held that the Jews had no idea of resurrection or immortality until their con- tact with Zoroastrianism and Hellenism. The shade went to Sheol, outside of God's world. Rewards and punishments for good or bad conduct were given in this world. This was the view of the Deuteronomist. The elaborate Egyptian beliefs in immortality are considered to have had little or no effect on Hebrew beliefs. Notions of God were anthropomorphic; the deity was thought to communicate directly with man as neighboring peoples thought their gods did. And the Hebrews considered themselves God's Chosen People with the mission to save the world by ruling it. Part 4 is entitled "Ideals-Achievements- Hope." There is appreciation of the develop- ment of the social conscience of Egypt during the First Interregnum and the Middle Kingdom and its subsequent decline, though the ideal of protection for the poor, the widow, and the fatherless persisted. And the same principle is shown in the oldest known codes of Sumer and Akkad as well as in the Code of Hammurabi. The ideal appears also in the Ugaritic poetry. The problem of the righteous sufferer is in Babylonian and Hebrew literature. In the Hebrew nation the prophets were a unique institution. They developed a social conscience beyond that of their neighbors. Nehemiah, who was concerned about ritual, acted vehemently against the Jews who were foreclosing mortgages and selling Jewish children into slavery. McCown rejects the proposal that the earlier prophets did not mean to do away with the temple sacrifices but meant only that sacrifices and offerings should be accompanied by correct attitudes. Sayings of Amos, Isaiah, and Micah clearly are anti-cult. So are some passages in the Psalms. During the Persian and Greek periods there came into Hebrew thought new con- ceptions-resurrection, final judgment, re- wards in heaven and hell, and a Satanic rule on earth. Evidence is offered to show that Judaism of the last centuries of the Second Temple and eventually Christianity owed a great deal to Mazdaism. Thus the Gospel of John and the Covenanters of Qumran are said to have derived from Mazdaism the idea of conflict between light and darkness. In this last section are some statements that will shock the Orthodox and be resented by the Neo-orthodox. Jesus and his age were below the prophets; for the prophets believed that God worked "in history through human agency," while Jesus thought that the end</page><page sequence="3">140 JOURNAL OF NEAR EASTERN STUDIES was at hand. Jesus never called himself the Messiah or the Savior of the world or hinted that to placate the wrath of the Father he was "dying an innocent victim to save others from punishment." Yet the influence of Jesus, "as divine Counselor, has never perished from the earth." "Today the neo- prophetic hope is as sadly splintered as Christendom itself. The apocalyptic element lives on in Second Coming and millenarian sects. The prophetic proletarian ethical tra- dition is maintained chiefly by liberals to whom apocalypticism is anathema. The majority of Christians care for neither, but divide their interests among ritual, theology, conventional individualistic morality, emo- tional salvation, and churchmanship of which Jesus knew nothing." The destruction of Jerusalem is called "one of the great constructive catastrophes of history," in that it "potantially emancipated both Judaism and Christianity from a barbarous cult of bloody sacrifices... as well as bondage to an unholy city that stands in history as a symbol of crass racialism, political intrigue, military force, and murdered prophets." McCown condemns the critical super- naturalists, the conservative biblicists, and those who try to produce a consistent biblical theology. From his study he sees no promise of a stagnant, peaceful Paradise on earth; but the good is in striving for a goal which cannot be reached. "The potentialities of response are built into man's nature, and the divine impulse of energy in the universe is on the side of him who bravely responds." A prodigious amount of reading and thought has gone into this last book of a great scholar. Reading it is a stimulating and rewarding experience. O. R.
