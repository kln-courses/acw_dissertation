<plain_text><page sequence="1">Architectural Invention in Sacred Structures The Case of Vesara Temples of Southern India AJAYJ. SINHA, Mount Holyoke College INTRODUCTION Architects, in the sense understood in the West, barely exist in the historiography of Indian temple architecture. It is generally assumed that temples respond to religious rituals and that their form is the product of India's religious traditions. This assumption, partly fed by Western definitions of individuality and ideas about originality, can be challenged through an examination of a series of eleventh-century temples built in sandstone in the Karnataka region of southern India. Though geographically close to each other [Figure 1], these Karnataka temples are so diverse in their design that we must posit the intervention of their designers, drawing upon local traditions to create works that cannot be fully predicted by previous monu- ments in those traditions. Bolstered by a rare epigraphical record that specifically mentions an architect by name and responds to his work, this article attempts both to document these architectural inventions in Karnataka as well as to argue that sacred structures in India, as buildings everywhere, evolve and change because of the way their designers engage with their tradition.' In drawing attention to architects, I do not aim to invoke their subjective creative will or to argue for any form of Western individualism, but rather to emphasize that a living relationship exists between the makers and their monuments. By "living," I mean that architects negotiate architectural traditions as well as religious ideas in the act of creating the formal details of their monuments. Far from reproducing canons fixed in sacred texts, they define new norms for temple structures through practice itself. It is my aim to explore this practice in eleventh- century Karnataka, but I do not mean to claim insight into the workings of the mind of the architects.2 I use the word "architect" to suggest an agency or even loosely a certain mentality that has given monuments their visual definition. Although the makers of Karnataka temples remain mostly unknown, a series of formal choices documented in these temples suggests the way their architects fundamentally changed the formal as well as the conceptual basis of the southern architectural tradition to which they belonged. Their experi- ment, conducted in a piecemeal, cumulative manner through- out the eleventh century, suggests a deliberate search for a new organizing principle, giving temples a consciously modern form. The modernity of the eleventh-century experiments in Karnataka has been overlooked by scholars, although it is well known that the temple form that emerged from these experi- ments eventually dominated Karnataka and the neighboring regions for more than two hundred years. Scholars have called this new regional form Vesara, a term influenced partly by a regional bias and partly by the Sanskrit word vesara, found in twelfth-century southern religious texts such as the Kdmikd- gama, which scholars have usually taken to mean "mule" or "hybrid."3 Vesara has thus been generally defined as a hybrid style of architecture created by mixing typical features of South Indian (Drivida) and North Indian (NMgara) architecture. Some scholars have considered such a hybridization to be natural in Karnataka, a region geographically contiguous to parts of North India and the southern extremes of South India.4 Others have used Vesara's intermediate place in the classification of Indian temples to emphasize its derivative status.5 I retain the term because it has validity in ancient texts and especially because it helps to underscore the self-consciousness with which these Karnataka architects dis- tinguished their design from both previous monuments in the region and from temples elsewhere in India, convey- ing a fundamentally different sense from its current explana- tions. Providing one argument against Vesara's derivative status within modern classification systems for temple architecture, an inscription in the Joda Kalasa ("twin pot") temple at Sfidi, dated A.D. 1060, shows the excitement with which contempo- rary viewers might have perceived the novelty of its Vesara form. Mentioning the designer of one of the two shrines of this major twin Vesara temple, the inscription reads: "SafkarArya ... constructed in the middle of the town of Sundi a dwelling for Ndgesvara so that the finials were completed in a manner that none could possibly imagine."6 The amazement of the scribe of this inscription is justified by many unusual features of the shrine, to be described later. First, it is important 382 JSAH / 55:4, DECEMBER 1996</page><page sequence="2">to point out, by examining a few monuments preceding Sfidi, that Safnkararya's shrine is not simply a novelty but part of a widespread change in the temple architecture of Karnataka that began earlier in the century and led to the standardization of the Vesara form by mid-century. The Sfidi inscription is rare, but its tone shows an active response to architectural changes that must correspond to the level of engagement of such Vesara architects as Safikararya. Lacking the documentary evidence available to historians of other periods of world architecture, I propose to trace Vesara's innovations by analyzing the monu- ments themselves. CONCEPTUAL SHIFT WITHIN THE SOUTHERN FORM M. A. Dhaky, a major scholar of Indian temple architecture, has observed that Vesara architecture is based on a regional variant of the typical form of South Indian architecture called Dr.vida.7 Dhaky's observation is borne out by the Kallefvara temple at Kukkanfir, datable to c. 1000-1025, which shows all the features of a regional Dravida temple [Figure 2].8 In its solid stone tower, clearly marked by horizontal stories, the temple evokes a multistoried mansion for the divine image housed in the sanctum, as is typical of earlier Drivida architecture [Figure 3]. Each story is defined by a stringcourse (hdra) of miniature architectural representations above the walls. As is typical in Drivicda architecture of the Karnataka sort, these BOMBAY MAHARASHTRA ANDHRA PRADESH Mahakut a Aihole .r,,Oadra B adu udi r~ -svali jIoKukkanur 4D Lakkundi Bay of Bengal - 01averi KARNATAKA MADRAS Arabian Sea 0 MYSORE TAMILNADU 0 100 200 miles SRI LANKA Indian Ocean FIGURE 2: Kukkan0r, Kalle'vara temple, sanctum exterior, west elevation, c. 1000- 1025. The wall has a wide, staggered central projection (bhadra) separated from corner piers (kamrnos) by narrow recesses. On the temple's solid stone tower, consisting of three horizontal stories and a dome, each story has a stringcourse (hdra) of miniature architectural representations, namely, square-domed pavilions (kOtas) above corners and a staggered variant of an oblong, barrel-roofed hall (0dl0) above the central projection. miniature models at Kukkanfir are composed mainly of square- domed, hut-shaped pavilions (kf2tas) at corners and an oblong, barrel-roofed hall form (?dld) in the center, the latter appearing split and staggered at Kukkanfir in a way that becomes significant in the development ofVesara architecture, as will be shown later. An arch-shaped dormer (ndsi) suggesting an attic window fronts each of these miniature representations, and is especially emphatic on the ?dld. On the basis of such formal continuities, architect-scholar Adam Hardy, in a recent work on Karnataka architecture, has taken the position that Vesara is only a continuation of Drivida architecture into later centuries, not a new form.9 This opinion is refuted by a close examination of Kukkanuir. While using the Drlvida vocabulary, Kukkanfir introduces significant changes in the basic Dravida architectural scheme. For instance, it has a FIGURE I: Southern India, showing Vesara sites SINHA: VESARA TEMPLES 383</page><page sequence="3">FIGURE 3: Mahdkjta, MahakCtesvara temple, west elevation, seventh century, showing typical features of a Dravida temple wide, projecting offset (bhadra) in the center of its wall, unlike the narrow feature in a Drdivida temple. Also unlike the latter, which is articulated as if it were a porch in which the resident deity of the mansion appears in its sculptural form, Kukkanfir simply uses a regular rhythm of thin pilasters to define evenly staggered planes of stone masonry.'0 The difference between Kukkanfir and the earlier Drivida temple suggests not simply a reduction of details but a concep- tual shift. Unlike the Dravida example, Kukkanfir's bhadra projection is widened to span the sanctum, as is visible in plan [Figure 4]. A proportional relationship is thus achieved between the inside and the outside of the temple in a way that had not concerned architects of earlier Drivida temples. Instead of being merely an architectural frame for the divine figure, the expanded bhadra at Kukkanfir becomes a more positive expres- sion of the temple's sanctum itself. The mass of the bhadra projection is conveyed especially by pinched recesses on either side, whose narrow, deeply cut lines separate it from the temple's comer piers (karnas). Quite conspicuously, the Kukkanir temple shows an archi- tectural motif on the central masonry face of its bhadra instead of a figural divinity [Figure 5]. Carved in relief, this motif has a square Drivida dome supported on a pair of tall, thin pilasters. The dome is crowned by a pot, similar to that on the temple's 384 JSAH / 55:4, DECEMBER 1996</page><page sequence="4">own finial. Such blank Drivida pavilions also occupy comer piers and the depth of the recesses, providing an austere decorative scheme for Kukkanfir's exterior walls. Although Kukkaniar's decorative use of architectural motifs is not unusual in the history of Indian temple architecture, the choice of these motifs as primary wall ornament is remarkable. The choice also suggests Kukkanfir's departure from Drivida temples, the walls of which had consistently shown anthropomorphic divinities singly or in narrative panels occupying decorated niches.1" The superstructure of Kukkanfir is reformulated to accom- modate changes on the temple's walls. The oblong ?dld motif on each of its stories (called madhya~ild on account of its central position) is drawn out, fragmented, and manipulated to re- spond to the increased width and staggered offsets of the bhadra projection below. The new configuration in fact looks as if it were made up of two "idlds, with the barrel vault of one of them telescoped into that of the other. The vertical side panels -j-~ N FIGURE 4: Kukkanflr, plan, showing sanctum (above) connected by a vestibule to a closed hall in front and a porch. The central projection of the sanctum wall reflects its interior. FIGURE 5: Kukkanur, south, showing architectural motifs as wall ornament. North Indian motifs are visible on the wall connecting the sanctum to the closed hall (extreme right, close-up shown in Figure 7). On the superstructure, the nested configuration of oblong motifs in the center of each story, with large, circular, dormers forming vertical pairs, responds to the staggered wall projection below. of this "nested" madhya~ial are carved virtually independent of the barrel-shaped backs, and are visibly taller. The panels correspond with the thin pilasters below and make the revised madhyasdld motif compatible with the offsets of the bhadra projection. Finally, the domed finial of the temple also has divisions reflecting the serial folds of the madhyailds below. The Draivida details on Kukkaniir's superstructure interfere with the horizontal effect of the stack of stories essential to its identity as a Dravida temple. The tall panels on the side of the nested madhyasdlds, for instance, produce gentle vertical accents across the superstructure. Below the large, projecting dormer (mahndsis) in the center of each madhyaidld, Kukkanfir also has an additional dormer fronting the moldings of the string- course. The arbitrary pairing of dormers in the exact center of each story is unprecedented, and it violates the architectural logic that is typically maintained in a Dravida temple. At Kukkanoir, however, linked dormers form a vertical spine for the entire superstructure, made emphatic also by the shortened walls for each of the stories and the resultant compression of the superstructure. SINHA: VESARA TEMPLES 385</page><page sequence="5">The only feature that continues to mark the horizontal stack of stories at Kukkanoir and is consistent in all later Vesara temples is the set of square kfitas at each corner of the stringcourse. These karnakutas continue to project the temple's Drivida profile in a relatively unaltered form. Within this emphatic Dravida frame, however, Kukkanfr rearranges and complicates Dravida details. To explain this reconfiguration as a deliberate departure from Drivida form, we can compare Kukkanfir to the Adakegvara temple at Mahakita, a contempo- rary structure that shares with it most of the formal Dravida ingredients [Figure 6].12 Their advancements over earlier temples provide a basis for dating these two monuments to the same period (c. 1000-1025). The differences between the two temples, however, can be attributed to aesthetic choices of the builders. In basic composition of wall offsets the Mahikfita temple closely matches Kukkanir. Both temples are distinguished by a very wide bhadra twice indented and separated from karnas by narrow recesses. Each of their offsets is framed by pilasters that are considerably thinner than those of the late tenth century at Aihole. There are also minor differences between the Kalleg- vara temple at Kukkanfir and the Adakesvara temple at Mahakfita. For instance, the north side of the Mahikfita temple, which most fully preserves its features, shows a molded basement (adhistldna) whose moldings are somewhat thicker than those at Kukkanir, reminding one of late tenth-century temples at Aihole.13 Mahakfita's walls also begin directly above the adhisthdna, as in those Aihole temples, without the molding of interlocked rafters (pratikanthas) present at Kukkanfir. The offsets and recesses at Mahikfita are not as deep as at Kukka- nfir. The indentation of offsets is shallow and so is the depth of the recesses. Architectural motifs are also not fully encased within the recesses as at Kukkaniir. The difference between Kukkanfir and Mahikfita is con- spicuous in the superstructure. Both have three stories and a dome, unlike a typical two-storied temple at Aihole. The manner of their upward progression, however, differs. At Mahakita, the hdra just above the sanctum wall has a nested madhyaidsa; the one above it has an unmodified Draivida sd'lW; and the topmost has only moldings supporting the hdra without the string of architectural motifs that characterize other stories. In effect, therefore, Mahiakita seems to show only two fully articulated stories below the dome, as in some temples at Aihole. At Kukkanfir, in contrast, each of the three stories depicts a full sequence of hlra motifs, only diminishing their size as stories ascend to the domed finial. While high walls enclosing each story give the Mahakita temple a somewhat ungainly appearance, it is significant that they also emphasize the temple's Drfivida accent, which can only be contrasted with Kukkanfir. The madhyamsld of the second story especially dominates FIGURE 6: MahikOta, Adakesvara temple, north elevation, c. 1000-1025 Mahakfita's superstructure. While at Kukkanfir the nested s.ld motif on this story is only a smaller version of that of the story below, the madhyasald at Mahkfiuta, which is not nested, is equal to the width of the inner part of the nested sdMld of the first story. This "la-/ also soars above the main wall of the sanctum as if it were raised on the wall of a second story directly above the inner sanctum, as in the earliest Draivida temples in the region (Figure 2).14 The prominence of this wall and its /al crown asserts a Dravida identity against the compressed and inte- grated effect of the wall so fully extended to the superstructure at Kukkanfir. The profile of Mahakfita's dome shows an S-curve closely comparable with Kukkanfir. The dome, however, stands over a visibly high collar, as is typical of Drivida temples in the region. It also harks back to the older Drivida mode of showing a single offset on its body rather than multiple projections reflecting the arrangement of nested madhyasdlds at Kukkanfir. The differences between Kukkanfir and Mahakfita suggest a tension between two contemporary monuments that otherwise share a common architectural vocabulary. Mahakfita insists on a Drivida form, while Kukkanfir introduces within that formal vocabulary a series of conceptual shifts that complicates its Dravida identity. Dhaky suggests that Vesara architecture is poised between North Indian (Nagara) and South Indian (Dravida) architecture. While Dhaky's observation resembles a longstanding scholarly belief, namely, that the Vesara form is created by mixing forms from these two regional sources,15 386 JSAH / 55:4, DECEMBER 1996</page><page sequence="6">Dhaky explains that "there is, in point of fact, nothing about (a Vesara) superstructure that can be directly sensed as Nigara. And yet the building can no longer be termed Drdvida in the sense the earlier buildings are."''16 Applying to Kukkanfir Dhaky's observation about a Vesara detail, it seems that the interlinked ndszis on the central face of its superstructure coalesce almost "in the fashion ofa lata (webbed central band) in a Nagara fikhara (tower)."'7 This Nagara cadence without an explicit use of Nigara forms is part of a self-conscious innovation, as we shall see. Dhaky explains that the vertical link of nadss in such temples as Kukkanir is an "archaistic" reminder of "a stage, which, centuries before, the Nigara form in its throes passed through, much before it achieved its fuller integrated and articulated form."18 This observation should be qualified by pointing out that Kukkanfir's Nigara-like formulation is in fact a late Drivida mimicry, not an attempt, progressive or regressive, at the integrated web of a Nagara temple's latd. The "archaistic" look of Kukkanfir continues in mature Vesara temples of the eleventh and twelfth centuries, and at once betrays a Vesara conceit by which architects showed off their knowledge of advanced, contemporary North Indian forms by rendering them accurately on walls of their monuments.19 The K iviivesvara temple at Lakkundi, a major Vesara temple of c. 1075, demonstrates this conceit most clearly (see Figure 10). The temple is built in gray soapstone, the preferred material from that period onward, which allows smoother surfaces and sharper details than sandstone. The temple has a large shrine model on its bhadra showing a type of multispired Nagara tower known from contemporary North India. On the left karna of its south wall it also precisely displays another contemporary northern variant called Bhfimija-a temple showing a vertical chain of spirelets on its tower. This temple's superstructure, however, extends Kukkanfir's archaism. In particular, Kukkanir's arbitrary linking of dormers in the center of each level now develops into a trefoil arch cascading across the moldings of the stories, spewed out by a gorgon mask filling the large dormer of the idld above. The decorative arch frames the tower of the large wall shrine underneath. While Kukkanir's idiosyncrasy may remind modern scholars of a North Indian feature, Lakkundi's developments suggest that the idiosyncrasy was in fact perceived as a local, Dravida invention in Karnataka from which architects produced further non-Nagara elaborations. INTRODUCTION OF AN ANOMALY Kukkanir's invention suggests the beginning of a series of unconventional ways in which Dravida features were manipu- lated. The deliberate nature of this effort is marked at Kukka- nir by an unprecedented motif inserted within the ornamental scheme of its exterior walls. This motif can be called a Nagara kfitastambha, a miniature version of a tall, curvilinear tower typical of a North Indian temple, shown standing on a single engaged column. The motif appears on the connecting wall between the sanctum and the closed hall in front [Figure 7], in the recesses of the sanctum's north wall, and at a few places along the exterior of the closed hall. A northern motif is unusual in the tradition of southern architecture to which the Kukkanfir monument belongs. The practice of building northern temples had already ceased in Karnataka more than two hundred years earlier. Nor can the reappearance of this form as a wall motif be accounted for simply as an evolution within the ornamental scheme of Drivida architecture. On the Kukkanfir wall, the Nigara kfitastambhas are an anomaly. Kukkanfir's kfitastambha motif is borrowed from North In- dian sources, especially Bhfimija temples, where such a motif was commonly used to create a vertical chain of spirelets on the superstructure.20 Its use on temple walls, however, is original to Kukkanfir, where it is distinguished from the general array of Dravida motifs. While a Drdvida motif recalls an open pavilion, with a pair of pilasters supporting a square dome similar to the temple's own finial or the kilta roof in the comer of each story, the Nagara k2itastambha is distinguished by its slender tower as well as its single columnar support. The use of Nagara kztastambhas on walls signals a change in the conceptual framework of Dravida architecture at Kukka- nfir. On temples earlier than Kukkanir, the ubiquitous Dravida kftta pavilion motif could have been read as an abstract representation of the sheltering form of the temple itself, making the monument and the ideograph on its wall directly reflect each other. At Kukkanir, this earlier, modular relation- ship between the structure and its ornament is qualified by the presence of a Nagara kftastambha. Adjacent to the Dravida kfita-pavilion, the Nagara kztastambha motif evokes a different reference. In its single column supporting a northern tower, the motif represents an irreducible form of a Nagara temple, imagined in its North Indian context as an ornamental stone casing for a column of smoke and fire rising above the temple's symbolic altar platform.21 As an embodiment of this basic northern imagery, the Nagara kItastambha differs fundamen- tally from the shelter form of a Dravida ideograph. The play of wall motifs at Kukkanir creates a tension within the temple's Dravida matrix, the resolution of which resulted in the emer- gence of the new regional architectural form we know as Vesara. Kukkantr is the first known temple in Kamrnataka that departs radically from the tradition of Dravida architecture. In the Rimalinigeivara temple at Gudir the anomalous northern motif introduced at Kukkanfir is fully absorbed within a decora- tive scheme of the sanctum wall [Figure 8]. In a Kukkanir-like wall composition, simplified to a bhadra with two rather than three stepped offsets, this small temple, datable to c. 1025-1050, SINHA: VESARA TEMPLES 387</page><page sequence="7">FIGURE 7: Kukkanor, south elevation, detail of the juncture wall between the sanctum and closed hall showing four North Indian motifs, miniature towers on single engaged columns shows Nagara katastambhas uniformly occupying all wall re- cesses and distinguished from the Drdvida kiita pavilions on projecting offsets. For about fifty years following Kukkanfir and Gudiir, temples built in their vicinity in northern Karnataka show a pattern of deliberate play between Nagara and Drdvida vocabularies, evolving into a conceptual logic different from that of Drivida architecture. The term Vesara should properly refer to this shift within the Drdvida formal repertoire, not simply a regional hybrid, as it is presented in current scholarly literature. The features of Vesara conceptual logic will be revealed first in an elaboration and systematization of the visual formula created at Kukkanoir, and then in two different anomalous treatments of Dr~vida forms. ELABORATION OF KUKKANOIJR'S FORMULA The Mallikarjuna temple at Sfdi (c. 1025-1050), northwest of Kukkanfir, elaborates on the visual formula of the Kukkanfir temple [Figure 9].22 Within a Kukkanfir-like wall scheme, the Mallikarjuna temple introduces an additional offset, called the pratiratha, between the bhadra and the karnas, providing addi- tional projecting as well as receding surfaces for more shrine motifs. The pratiratha is surmounted by a large nads pediment, repeated on each story of the superstructure. The additional pair of offsets is indicated in the temple's finial, whose profile otherwise is remarkably close to that of the Kukkanfir temple. The Mallikarjuna temple is boldly sculptural in its massing. Its walls are given a lofty effect by pavilion motifs that reach only half their height-a characteristic it shares with the Adakesvara temple at Mahakaita. The addition ofpratirathas also increases the lateral span of Mallikarjuna's walls. As a result, the super- structure sits on a very broad base, from which it rises in a distinct stepping of stories to a small dome. The walls of each story are pulled inward to enable the quick upward progression toward the dome. The stepped, wavy outline of the superstruc- ture created by the silhouette of curved kIta roofs on corners is different from the harmonious pyramidal profile of Kukkanir. As in Kukkanfir, the Mallikarjuna temple has three full stories on its superstructure, except that above the third it also has the wall segment and a set of lower moldings of a typical 388 JSAH / 55:4, DECEMBER 1996</page><page sequence="8">stringcourse of an additional story, on which the temple's domed finial rests. The ndsi pediment facing the finial is also small enough to continue the sense of graded rhythm of the stories, unlike the large mahdndsf facing Kukkanfir's dome, which distinguishes the finial from the lower stories. The Mallikirjuna's dome thus appears to be an incipient fourth story. Its indented face also corresponds to the width of the staggered bhadra of the temple. The central spine of Mallikarjuna's superstructure is con- ceived in a way different from Kukkanfir's. While at Kukkanfir, the nested madhyasad-tl rises from story to story in a progressively diminished scale, in the Mallikarjuna only a block of stone with a mahdnads pediment (some left uncarved) persists in the center of each story. On the second story, this ndst is backed by a simple, barrel-vaulted sdla rather than its nested variant. On the third story, only the mahdndsf block remains. This formula of removing peripheral elements of the madhyascdl motif in order to accommodate the narrowing of stories seems to correspond to that used in the Adakesvara temple at Mahakfita. Here, however, it achieves the opposite result. Whereas Mahakfita emphasized distinct stories in a Dravida manner, Sfdi helps condense the stories and even integrate the finial within its wavy profile. The decorative wall scheme that began at Kukkanufr and Gudir is given a systematic form in the Mallikarjuna temple at Sfdi. Wall offsets and recesses are filled with two types of blank architectural motifs. Drivida pavilions occupy projections as well as the inner pair of recesses flanking the staggered bhadra. Nagara kfitastambhas fill only the outer pair of recesses, those between the pratirathas and karnas. In using a Nigara motif only in the outer pair of recesses, the Mallikarjuna temple at Sfidi provides early evidence for an emerging Vesara morphology. Reflected also in other temples of the mid-eleventh century, the scheme is expressed perhaps most fully in c. 1075 in the KMilivisvesvara temple at Lakkundi. In the complexity of its wall surface one continues to see dwarfed Nagara kfitastambhas clearly marking recesses between the karnas and pratirathas [Figure 10].23 The Kdiilvisvesvara temple, like the Malliktrjuna temple at FIGURE 8: Gudor, Rimali6gesvara temple, north elevation, c. 1025-1050 FIGURE 9: SodT, Mallikarjuna temple, west elevation, mid-eleventh century. Note the addition of subsidiary offsets (pratirathos) between the central projection and corner piers. North Indian motifs occupy only the pair of recesses between the subsidiary offsets and the corner piers. SINHA: VESARA TEMPLES 389</page><page sequence="9">FIGURE 10: Lakkundi, K Tvi've'vara temple, south elevation, c. 1075, Architectural motifs include the large, multispired, North Indian (Nagara) shrine for a niche on the central projection; a variant of a North Indian temple tower of the Bhomija type on the extreme left; and tiny Nagara towers on short columns in the recesses adjacent to the comer piers. Three "gateway" motifs decorate the basement moldings below the wall level. i!! Ir FTI FIGURE I 1: LakkundT, plan, showing sanctum walls including, within the girth of their central mass, the bhadra projection as well as the pair of pratiratha offsets flanking it Sfdi, has a five-part wall, comprising a pair of karnas, prat- irathas, and a staggered bhadra projection. The bhadra now has a conspicuous niche crowned by a large North Indian tower. As against the advanced wall composition, however, Lakkundi's ground plan reveals a simpler, tripartite division recalling Kukkanfir and GudOr in its single, expanded central projection distinguished from a pair of comer piers [Figure 11]. The components of this basic layout are further emphasized on the basement moldings, where three gateway motifs (toranas) front each of the three primary offsets. Above, the primary division is maintained by distinguishing wall recesses. The outer pair, separating the central mass from the comer piers, are carved deeper than the inner pair, immediately flanking the bhadra. More significantly, only those outer recesses are filled by dwarf Nagara kfitastambhas, embellished now also by a variety of highly decorative surrounds. At Sfdi, the primacy of these outer recesses was shown only by the northern ornament. Distinguished sufficiently from a general array of southern motifs, the Nigara ktitastambha systematically defined the five-part wall of that Vesara temple into a central cluster of offsets, which included the pratirathas and corner piers. Lakkundi quite literally includes the wall's pratiratha offsets within the projecting mass of its central cluster. I call the combined bhadra-cum-pratiratha projection that evolves on these and other mid-eleventh-century temples a bhadra cluster, because it corresponds to the effect of an expanded bhadra projection developed first at Kukkanir. The bhadra cluster is an original Vesara conception, created by inducing a shift of focus within Dravida's formal vocabulary. The significance of Stidi's Mallikirjuna temple is that it indi- cates the new conceptual frame using Nigara motifs to define the central cluster of offsets. Lakkundi extends Siadi's Vesara logic by massing out the bhadra cluster on a tripartite plan, visually binding its components by a remarkable tracery of interwoven architectural motifs. The bhadra cluster provides Vesara architects a basis to organize a complex and varied formation of the temple's elevation on a relatively simple 390 JSAH / 55:4, DECEMBER 1996</page><page sequence="10">underlying plan. In ways that are quite unlike any known in a Dravida temple, Lakkundi's projection of overlapping struc- tural motifs around a Nagara wall shrine is one of the many expressions of the bhadra cluster created by Vesara architects of Karnataka.24 STANDARDIZATION OF VESARA ARCHITECTURE In the second half of the eleventh century, Vesara architecture was standardized, by which I mean that a tacit agreement seems to have been reached among architects in Karnataka about the basic components and the architectural logic of a fully devel- oped Vesara temple. Reflected in a variety of monuments, the agreement is best expressed in one of the two shrines of the twin temple at Sfdi mentioned earlier, popularly called the Joda Kalaia (twin pot). Sfidi is called rdjadhdnf (capital) in contemporary inscrip- tions, which may at least suggest a major city if not one of the capitals built under the Chilukya rulers of northern Karnataka. In any event, it certainly was a principal site for building projects in the middle of the eleventh century, having at least two large temples-the Mallikurjuna and the Joda Kalaga-as well as an extensively carved step well. The two shrines of the Joda Kalaia, known as the Western and the Eastern, share an open, pillared hall with conspicuously drooping eaves [Figure 12]. The Western Shrine completes the formative period of Vesara architecture; the Eastern Shrine is an anomaly discussed in the next section. A foundation inscription in the temple makes the Joda Kalaia a chronological touchstone for this period. The inscrip- tion, from the reign of the Chalukya king, Somesvara I, and dated Saka 981/1060, mentions that the army general (dandandyaka) Nigadeva, who seems to have been a native of Sfidi, constructed a temple here named Nigesvara, from his own name, "attached to the Nagaresvara" ["Lord of the City"].25 The two shrines of the twin temple may thus properly be designated as the Nagaresvara and the Nigesvara. It is the Eastern Shrine of the Joda Kalaga (right in Figure 12) that may have been referred to as the Nagesvara in the SOfdi inscription. Although the Western Shrine (left), to which it is attached, has some similar features that suggest that the two parts of the twin temple belong to the same period, the Eastern Shrine might be marginally later, a fact to which the inscription seems to refer. The Western Shrine of Joda Kalaia gives the architectural elaborations of mid-century temples such as Sfidi's Mal- likarjuna temple a formal coherence similar to that of Kukka- nfr. The shrine shows five projecting offsets on its walls, separated by recesses [Figure 13]. For pratirathas it uses thick, molded half pillars, which provide a more robust frame for its bhadra cluster than the thin framing pilasters for offsets in the Mallikirjuna temple. These intermediary half pillars hereafter became a typical feature of Vesara temples in Karnataka.26 For the first time, the superstructure of the Western Shrine has four fully articulated stories of a standardized Vesara temple. These four stories are well integrated by the diminish- ing of individual units of each story so that our eyes are smoothly led up to the dome. In particular, the nested madhya- FIGURE 12: SOdi, Joda Kalasa ("twin pot"), south elevation, c. 1060, showing the Western (left) and the Eastern (right) shrines SINHA: VESARA TEMPLES 391</page><page sequence="11">FIGURE 13: SdiT, Western (Nagareivara) Shrine, south elevation ?dld is maintained as a unit reduced gradually in subsequent stories, as at Kukkanfir but differing from the treatment at Mallikarjuna, where the ?dld around the mahadnsf block is gradually whittled off. In the Western Shrine, the dome also stands apart from the four stories and is made to harmonize with the sloping profile of the superstructure by an increase in its size. Its face is marked by a large dormer as at Kukkanfir, distinguishing it from the gradual progression of levels of the superstructure. The Western Shrine of Joda Kalaia employs the Nagara kfitastambha motif uniformly in each of its wall recesses, obscur- ing the motifs systematic use, by contrast with Mallikdirjuna, where it indicates the central cluster of offsets. This "overuse" at Joda Kalaga might suggest a fascination with what might have been considered a modem motif in a period of tentative explorations. The excess may also indicate an aesthetic choice. The slender Nagara ornament fits more comfortably in re- cesses that have been narrowed by the massive pratirathas, and that consequently could have become cluttered by the pair of pilasters and the square finial of a Drivida pavilion motif. Of course, a motif need not always be limited to its original function; while marking the evolution of an architectural principle, it is more likely to vanish or be transformed when the principle is internalized.27 The overused northern motif may in fact be a sign of an internalized Vesara standard. While giving sufficient hint of the bhadra cluster embedded in the systematic Vesara composition at Sfid.i's Mallikdrjuna temple-a composi- tion strengthened by thick half-pillars on the Western Shrine- the Nagara kiftastambha motif is now also treated as a decorative device. Occupying the shrine's recesses, the slender motif regularly alternates with the more rectangular Dravida pavilion fronting wall offsets. If such a use of the Nigara ornament obscures its systematic function, it also sets a pattern for standard Vesara temples of c. 1100, where Nigara towers are replaced altogether in recesses by a steady refrain of Vesara towers standing on their single columns.28 IRREGULARITIES OF THE FORMATIVE PERIOD In contrast to the Western Shrine, which represents a develop- ment of earlier experiments into a new architectural norm, the Eastern Shrine ofJoda Kalaia at Sfid-i preserves one of the most daring Vesara experiments, its audaciousness recognized and remarked upon by contemporary viewers. The shrine shares its basic composition with the Western Shrine except that it is smaller and has three instead of four stories on its superstruc- ture [Figure 14]. It nevertheless exploits the wall surface avail- able with the addition of pratiratha offsets far more than the Western Shrine [Figure 15]. The shrine is especially distin- guished by its array of architectural motifs, which are far more varied in type than those of the Western Shrine. On karnas and in recesses, large shrine motifs stand on paired pilasters; those on the half-pillars of pratirathas stand on single thick columns. Some are simply towers, some are full-blown shrines with walls. They all seem to fold into each other, multiply, and shift on the wall as if seen through a prism. Small kitastambhas are embed- ded into each of the large motifs on offsets, except on the bhadra, which itself is radically transformed. Among the temple types depicted on the walls of the Eastern Shrine, large Ndigara towers occupy the easterly re- cesses on the south wall (Figure 15; proper left of the bhadra), Bhfimija temple form-recognizable by small spirelets strung together on the tower-appears as a small kdtastambha embed- ded in a Drfivida motif on the western pratiratha (proper right of the bhadra). The Drivida motifs also vary in form. The east harna of the south wall has a double-storied Draivida structure with a cadld roof; the western harna has a broad-based, single- storied temple with a square cupola. The recesses flanking it have a pillared wall section reminiscent of the Dharmaraija Ratha at Mahfibalipuram in Tamilnadu-showing awareness of a Drivida variant of a neighboring region. The pratiratha adjacent to this harna has a shrine, the dome of which is 392 JSAH / 55:4, DECEMBER 1996</page><page sequence="12">reminiscent of the Lower Sivdlaya in Badami--showing a local regional memory.29 The bhadra of the Eastern Shrine is rendered in an unusual way. Its most conspicuous feature is its centralmost face (su- bhadra), which has a projection that is turned at a 45-degree angle to the shrine's orthogonal plan. A thin pilaster clinging to it marks the exact center of the bhadra. To either side of the central mark are Vesara kFitastambhas, also at an angle.30 The wide subsidiary level behind the subhadra shows a partly hidden oblong pavilion, carved in detail with a shaded, second-story verandah with set-back cells and a barrel roof with lions at each end.31 The framing pilasters of the whole bhadra support a barrel vaulted adld at the level of the stringcourse of the superstructure. The superstructure, preserved most fully on the east side, responds to the overlap in the features of the wall. Above the subhadra the thin cornice (kapota) of the horizontal story-- which usually has a quarter-round profile-is turned into tapered eaves. Thicker than the kapota cornice, these eaves project into a pointed ridge providing shade to the angled fold of the subhadra. Above it, and instead of the components of the usual nested madhyasld, is a square kftta inscribed against a single Oild back. The kuta shows a projection in the center, turned at an angle. Two tiny corner pavilions on either side of a turned third in the center enhance the nested, folded arrange- ment of kftas. The ruffled dome of the temple fully reflects the composition of the wall as it is conducted through the superstruc- ture. The dome is unusual in that it also has a dormer on either side of its ridged bhadra, corresponding to the temple's dormer- topped pratirathas. The angled subhadra and its kfta crown appear as if they were part of a projecting corner from another shrine imagina- tively embedded in the main temple. This imagery of embed- ded shrines, carried as a theme also through the miniature models on the walls, becomes the basis for Vesara's many bold and innovative experiments with the bhadra cluster.32 At Sildi the architect dared to manipulate the structural parts of the temple to make this kind of statement for the first time. The foundation inscription from the Joda Kalaca, discussed above, mentions the architect of the Eastern (Nageivara) Shrine, stating that "this Sanikarurya, a vakrokti-vdcaspati, a teacher to the loyal, undertook the charge and constructed in the middle of the town of Sundi a dwelling for NMgeivara so that the finials were completed in a manner that none could possibly imagine."33 The scribe could only have been referring to the architectural innovations of the Eastern Shrine. The Sanskrit phrase vakrokti-vdacspati, used in the inscrip- tion to describe the architect, has been translated as "the master of punning phrases."34 Vdcaspati, the second term in the phrase, means "master of speech" in the same way that sthapati, a term commonly used for architect in India, might literally mean "master (creator) of place." Vakrokti, the first term, refers to a concept from Indian literary criticism that implies a twist of phrase produced in speech to reveal unexpected meanings. Some Indian aestheticians regard this quality of deviance to be the heart of poetic language.35 The use of the phrase vakrokti- vdcaspati in the inscription may thus reflect the reaction of a sophisticated, literate member of the urban public who wrote it. It is significant, however, that the literary phrase is used here to refer to an architect, conveying the scribe's sense of wonder at his architectural creation. The finials that the writer of the Sfidi inscription noted with amazement must first refer to the temple's exceptional super- structure. However, the reference may also be to the impressive display of architectural models used as ornaments for this monument, including some elaborate contemporary North Indian towers, which here make their first appearance in the region. But there is more to inspire the writer's amazement. The temple's central wall offset and the superstructure are unlike anything seen in Karnataka or in the entire Dravida tradition of South India. Experimentation with such a turned FIGURE 14: SOdT, Eastern (Ndge'vara) Shrine, east elevation. The turned projection in the exact center affects the details of the temple from its plinth to its domed finial.

Under the conspicuous, tapered eaves the turned projection partly obscures the oblong shrine motif on the wide central offset. offset had been seen only in the North Indian architectural tradition. Sfidi's central projection might compare, for in- stance, to the bhadra of the Siva temple at Dhobini in eastern India [Figure 16].36 At Sfidi, however, the North Indian formula is made fully consistent with the southern architectural vocabu- lary. In calling Safikararya a "master of poetic deviance," the literate writer of the Sfidi inscription may have been referring to the northern interpretation the architect of the Eastern Shrine has given to his southern monument. The Eastern Shrine ofJoda Kalasa is anomalous within the Drivida tradition. Its idiosyncrasy sets a precedent for Vesara architecture in the latter half ofthe eleventh century. The rotated central offset makes Joda Kalaia perhaps the first temple in Karnataka to attempt a deviation that gives the wall a prismatic effect, one that is further articulated by turning pratiratha piers in the Sfrya temple at Lakkundi [Figure 17]. The shrine motifs used as ornament on the Eastern Shrine reveal a knowledge of a variety of temple-forms including-for the first time-- Bhimija, which we also see later on the Kadiviivesvara temple at Lakkundi. Finally, this temple's somewhat overburdened layer- ing of architectural motifs on offsets contributes to an effect of embeddedness of the shrines that can also be found in the twin Kafiivisvesvara and Sairya shrines at Lakkundi, where it is given greater conceptual refinement and symbolic meaning. The Brahmadeva temple at Savadi, another Vesara anomaly farther west of Sfdi, provides yet another link in Karnataka with North Indian architectural experiments, breaking ties with its Dravida precedents [Figure 18]. Built in c. 1050-1075, the Brahmadeva temple provides one of the earliest examples of a fully stellate temple in northern Karnataka.37 Its dating is supported by a comparison with Sfidi. For instance, the adhis- tthdna of the Brahmadeva temple compares with those on the Joda Kala'a at Sfidi. Also, the walls are exaggerated in height to fit figurative panels in the upper section, but the shrine pavilions on them stand low, unlike those of temples built after c. 1075. The temple's sanctum uses four rotated squares to create sixteen comers on which the karna piers of the temple are located. The wall shows a column wedged between the karna piers. The column is created within the boundaries of the rotated square by simply carving back the recesses around it, while the monotony of its excessive height is broken by plain bands along the shaft. Like S0di, the Savadi temple abounds in references to North 394 JSAH / 55:4, DECEMBER 1996</page><page sequence="14">India [Figure 19]. All recesses are filled with Nagara kktastambhas. an excess Savadi shares with the Western Shrine atJoda Kalasa. Karnakftas above at the superstructural level are also faced by a Nigara kzftastambha. Although ruined, the moldings of the hdra above the sham column between the karna piers suggest that it would also have been crowned by a Nigara tower, so that the entire stringcourse above the wall would then have had a row of such northern ornament. The emphasis on North Indian architectural models is unusual in this temple only because it is overdone. All karna piers are fronted by Bhfmija shrine models-a form that was introduced on the Eastern Shrine at Sidi at a much smaller scale. In his study of architectural models on Vesara temples in relation to two architects' inscriptions that discuss these, Dhaky has noted an ambiguous relationship between Vesara and Bhfmija.3 The Bhfimija shrine, occupying a place on the karna typically reserved for Vesara pavilions in later temples (except on the south side of the KS ivisveivara temple at Lakkundi) suggests that this ambiguity might have a basis in real confu- sion. Savadi reinvents the components of a Vesara temple to fit the needs of its rotating plan. Staked out by Nagara kiitastamb- has in adjacent recesses, its sham columns suggest a series of bhadra clusters collapsed into emblematic, pratiratha-like half pillars. Karma piers are also employed as never before; alternat- ing and multiplying, they open up the core of the temple to reveal the condensed bhadra cluster through their facets. The Eastern Shrine of the Joda Kalaia at Sfidi and the Savadi temple, built not far from each other and datable to c. 1050-1075, create different monuments from shared ideas. Sfidi's shrine could have been planned by a single rotation of the square diagram of the temple to create central wall offsets turned at a 45-degree angle, as at Dhobini in eastern India. Savadi shows a stellate plan of sixteen comers created by rotating the diagram four times. Si.di's angled subhadra is articulated as if it were the karna of a hidden shrine, with its implied karnakfita revealed at the hdra level against the temple's dald. The rotated plan at Savadi creates serial folds of alternat- ing karnas and bhadras. The contemporaneity of these two variants suggests that they are not part of an internal develop- ment of regional architecture. In both cases, their architects seem to be looking outside the region-perhaps to the neigh- boring regions of eastern and central India-for formulas to FIGURE 16: Dhobini (eastern India), Siva temple, east elevation, c. 700, showing the central projection turned at a 45-degree angle FIGURE 17: Lakkundi, SGrya temple, east elevation, c. 1075, showing turned subsidiary offsets SINHA: VESARA TEMPLES 395</page><page sequence="15">modify their Drdivida tradition. In using those borrowed formu- las for quite distinct results, these two temples demonstrate the originality of the Vesara experiment in Karnataka. CONCLUSION Vesara architecture emerged in the eleventh century when architects made conceptual and formal changes to the formal matrix of South Indian architecture of Karnataka. The forma- tion of Vesara architecture is marked by anomalies and some- times daringly unprecedented play with regional conventions. The opening up of a South Indian or Drivida temple in a way that incorporates North Indian or Nagara references suggests Vesara's mode of departure from its native tradition. By introducing Nigara references into Drdivida formal matrix, Vesara architects changed Drivida architecture from a tradition to be preserved and reproduced to a problem to be explored. It is true that a Vesara temple of the early eleventh century shares all its architectural elements with contemporane- ous Drivida temples. To become Vesara, it does not replace features of Drivida architecture with a typology of new forms.39 On the contrary, it insists on a Drivida profile, especially by maintaining the kttas at the corner of each of its distinct stories.40 But it is a mistake to consider Vesara only as a late, eclectic stage of Drdvida architecture, as some scholars of Karnataka architecture have suggested.41 Ndgara architecture, used as a motif in the decorative scheme of a Vesara temple, as an aesthetic reference in the overall organization of its eleva- tion, and as a formula to transform its ground plan, shows various means by which eleventh-century Karnataka architects achieved a tension within their Drivida tradition. Their experi- ments, including anomalies within the framework of Drivida as well as highly irregular structures, permanently changed the character of Drivida architecture in the region.42 The complexity ofVesara's play is not sufficiently explained by our current classification system for Indian temple architec- ture, where Vesara is given an intermediate status between North Indian and South Indian architecture. From an early period, temples in Karnataka have commonly combined bor- rowed features, owing to the region's location between north and south.43 The deliberate nature of Vesara's innovations in the eleventh century as well as their intentions must be under- scored against the natural eclectic tendencies shown by temples in Karnataka. In breaking away from the Drivida tradition and bringing about a conceptual shift in its basic framework, Vesara archi- tects searched beyond regional hybridization to give their FIGURE 18: SavadT, Brahmadeva temple, south elevation, c. 1 050-1075, showing a stellate configuration of the sanctum 396 JSAH / 55:4, DECEMBER 1996</page><page sequence="16">FIGURE 19: SavadT, northwest elevation, detail of sanctum exterior structures a contemporary form. My analysis of their experi- ments shares with recent studies of South Asian art and architecture an emphasis on artistic practice against the burden of normative, sacred texts.44 Those studies, however, seek models to define ancient practice in an ethnography of living, folk-art traditions. Such extrapolations from an area whose major theme has been the reconfiguration of traditional crafts within a modem market economy bias the issue toward the artists' capacity to adapt and survive rather than their capacity to engage and to give shape. The makers of Vesara temples in medieval South India deserve credit for a lot more initiative than we have been willing to grant them so far. Notes I thank Michael T. Davis, my medievalist colleague at Mount Holyoke College, for pointing out that the issues in this article have relevance beyond the field of Indian temple architecture. A glossary of Sanskrit architectural terms used in the text follows the endnotes. I This article is part of a larger study of architectural inventions in southern Indian temples on which I am currently working. In the early twentieth century, Ananda K. Coomaraswamy, who formulated the traditional scholarly understand- ing of the role of the makers of sacred monuments in India, contrasted it to Western individualism, explaining that "all craftsmen regard their art as a mystery, and look upon its traditions, handed down in pupillary succession, as invested with sacred and scriptural authority." Ananda K. Coomaraswamy, The Arts and Crafts of India and Ceylon (1913; reprint New York, 1964), 34. In a somewhat different formulation that feels closer to the rationale for iconoclasm, Stella Kramrisch pointed out that the makers of sacred monuments were required to remain strictly "harnessed" to prescribed norms because temples were such powerful and efficacious instruments that an idiosyncratic design could have disastrous consequences on society. See Stella Kramrisch, "Artist, Patron, and Public in India" (1956), reprinted in Barbara Stoller Miller, ed., Exploring India's Sacred Art: Selected Writings of Stella Kramrisch (Philadelphia, 1983), 57-58. 2 Michael Baxandall, in his definition of artistic intentions, has provided me with a tool to explore practice. Baxandall explains intention as the "forward- leaning look of things ... not a reconstituted historical state of mind, then, but a relation between object and its circumstance." This definition is particularly useful for Indian art because it addresses thinking embedded in the works of art themselves, while avoiding the problematic, and from an Indian point of view irrelevant, issue of the subjective will of the maker. Patterns of Intentions: On the Historical Explanation ofPictures (New Haven, 1985), 42. 3Vesara is traditionally considered part of a triadic classification of temple architecture in India. N. V. Mallaya, "Ndgara, Dravida, Vesara,"Journal of the Indian Society of Indian Art 9 (1941): 94, suggests that the Sanskrit term Vesara, "in its primary, significatory capacity denotes a 'mule.'" Stella Kramrisch borrows Mallaya's idea of"heterogeneous parents" to define Vesara as a "mixed style" of architecture. Stella Kramrisch, The Hindu Temple (Calcutta, 1946), 291. 4 The triadic classification of Indian temple styles is based, arguably, on the geographical distribution of monuments in medieval India: Drivida suggests a style dominating South India; Nagara, North India; and Vesara, Karnataka. See M. A. Dhaky, Indian Temple Forms in Ka.nuita Inscriptions and Architecture (New Delhi, 1977), 29-34, for a good summary of extensive debates over such a classification. Emphasizing geography, Kramrisch (The Hindu Temple, 291) explains Vesara's hybridization in Karnataka as "natural in a region betwixt two powerful schools of which Nagara, the first and foremost is centered in Madhyadefa... and Drivida in South India." The notion of Vesara as an intermediary style is reflected in many subsequent studies as well as standard surveys. 5 Using a phrase from E. H. Gombrich, I would call such a use of Vesara a critic's "term of exclusion." See his "Norm and Form: The Stylistic Categories of Art History and Their Origins in Renaissance Ideals," in Norm and Form: Studies in the Art of the Renaissance (London, 1966), 88-89. Probably the first modem scholar to resolve the three traditional styles of Indian temple architecture into "essentially" two, the Nagara and the Drivida, was S. K. Saraswati, who dismissed Vesara from the triad on the basis of its hybrid nature. S. K. Saraswati, "Origin of Medieval Temple Styles," Indian Culture (Journal of the Indian Research Institute), 8/2-3 (1941-1942): 184. 6 Lionel D. Barnett, "Inscriptions ofSfidi," Epigraphia Indica 15 (1919-1920): 85-94, especially lines 29-30. The inscription is discussed more fully later. 7 M. A. Dhaky, Indian Temple Forms in Ka.rnta Inscriptions and Architecture (New Delhi, 1977), 26. 81 discuss Kukkanfr's date elsewhere by comparing it, on the one hand, to late tenth-century temples, principally at Aihole and Ron and, on the other, to the mid-eleventh-century temples such as those at Sfidi (the latter also are discussed later in this article). See Ajay J. Sinha, "Originality and Origination of Vesara Architecture," Ph.D. dissertation, University of Pennsylvania, 1993, 58-60. 9Adam Hardy, in "Patterns of Thought and Form in Hindu Temple Architecture," Architecture and Design (November-December 1986): 51, has specifically argued for treating the eleventh-century monuments only as part of a continuous development of Dravida architecture in Karnataka-an argument fuilly detailed in "The Karnmata Dravida Tradition: Development of Indian Temple Architecture in Kamrnataka, 7th to 13th Centuries," Ph.D. dissertation, Birmingham Polytechnic, U.K., 1991. I have not yet seen Hardy's recent book based on the dissertation (Indian Temple Architecture: Form and Transformation, The Karnata Drtvida Tradition, 7th to 13th Centuries (New Delhi, 1995). t0 Arguing against Hardy's treatment of Vesara as if it were Dravida archi- tecture, I concur with Dhaky's choice of the word "basis," which suggests that Dravida is a foundation for the architectural vocabulary of Vesara but does not determine or predict the direction of Vesara's developments.

SINHA: VESARA TEMPLES 397</page><page sequence="17">I1 The Kalleivara temple at Kukkanfir is not the first to show this shift in the ornamental scheme of a Dravida temple although it is a prominent example. Small tenth-century temples at Aihole provide earlier evidence of the drift from figural to architectural motifs. Sinha, "Originality and Origination of Vesara," 46f. 12 Although the temple, located in a coconut grove near the main temple compound at Mahdkfita, is called Ndgandtha in the American Institute of Indian Studies photo archive, suggesting Dhaky's designation, some scholars also call it the Adakeivara ("lord of betel-nuts"), a name that has some local relevance, although most pilgrims will not recognize either of the two names. (Conversation with S. Rajashekhar, Dharwar, India, 1989.) I prefer Adakesvara because the other misleads visiting scholars to the Nagandtha temple at Nagaral, a well- known eighth-century temple near Mahdkfita. 13 Sinha, "Originality and Origination ofVesara," 40-56. 14 For other early Dr~vida temples, see K.

Pramod Chandra (New Delhi, 1975), 90-113. 21 I borrow here from Michael W. Meister, who has shown that, while all temples in India represent a shelter for the enshrined divinity, the Ndgara form overlays this architectural reference with a symbolic surface that represents a sacred altar, where ancient Indian fire rituals embodied the process of cosmic creation. Michael W. Meister, "On the Development of a Morphology for a Symbolic Architecture: India," Res 12 (Autumn 1986): 38-39. The conceptual distinction between DrSvida and Ndgara forms earlier made more succinctly in his "Altars and Shelters in India," AARP: Art and Archaeology Research Papers 16 (1979): 39. 22 The date is borne out by an inscription in the temple dated 1054 A.D. that mentions it as Akkeivara and records rules for its funding. Epigraphia Indica 15 (1919-1920): 80-83. The temple could predate the inscription. 23 Other temples of this period showing such a distinct arrangement of motifs are the Sfirya shrine connected with the K aivilveivara at Lakkundi (Figure 17, showing Ndgara kiosks with standing figures instead of the columnar northern motif) and a Vesara temple in Badami next to the well-known eighth-century Jambulifiga temple. See Sinha, "Originality and Origination of Vesara," 73-75. 24 Ibid., 149-157, for numerous other experiments with the bhadra cluster later in the eleventh century. 25 Barnett, "Inscriptions of Sfdi," verse 16. 26 In temples such as the Sfrya at Lakkundi, the architectonic effect of half pillars is conveyed by pulling them substantially out of their recesses and turning them at a 45-degree angle (Figure 17). 27 Michael W. Meister, "Mandala and Practice in Nagara Architecture in North India," Journal of the American Oriental Society 99 (April-June 1979): 204-219, makes a similar point in relation to the sacred diagram underlying the square plan of a typical Hindu temple. 28 The switch from Nagara to Vesara kitastambha ornament occurs first in the Siddheivara temple at Haven of c. 1100, and is consistently maintained thereafter. Sinha, "Originality and Origination ofVesara," 116 and passim. 29 For reproductions of the seventh-century Drivida temples named, see Encyclopaedia of Indian Temple Architecture, ed. Michael W. Meister and M. A. Dhaky, vol. 1 (South India), parts 1 and 2 (1983, 1986). 3o A short wall between the Eastern Shrine and the connecting open hall of theJoda Kalaia is rendered in the manner of the shrine's bhadra, except that the offset with canted pilasters is replaced by a thick pier, and the kitastambhas fronting the angled walls are without their ornamental frame. 31 One of these lions survives on the motif on the south wall. 32 For these experiments, see Sinha, "Originality and Origination of Vesara," 144-159. Lakkundi's use of the bhadra cluster as a pictorial frame for a series of overlapping architectural motifs is one such example (Figure 10). 3 Barnett, "Inscriptions of Sfdi," verse 16. 34 Ibid., 93. 35R.

A. Sundara, "Some Temples of North Dharwar District," TheJournal ofKarnataka University (Social Sciences) 9 (1973): 107. 38Dhaky, Temple Forms, 25. 9 Michael Meister has observed that precisely such a substitution and alteration had separated Nigara architecture in about the seventh century from previous temples in North India that had shared with the more evolved, multistoried Dravida temples of South India a formal basis in hut-shaped structures. See Michael W. Meister, "Prisida as Palace: Kftina Origins of the Nigara Temple," Artibus Asiae 49 (1988-1989): 254-280. The creation of Vesara differs from such a process of substitution. 40 On the basis of such formal similarities, some scholars have suggested that Vesara is merely a late expression of Drivida architecture. The view was held originally by archaeologists in the nineteenth century, as shown by the first major monograph on architecture in Karnataka. See Henry Cousens, The Chalukyan Architecture of the Kanarese Districts (Archaeological Survey of India, New Imperial Series, vol. 42, Calcutta, 1926). More recently, Adam Hardy has continued Cousen's framework for formal analysis of Kamataka architecture. See note 9. 41 Hardy has even argued against using the term Vesara to distinguish architecture of this period from the preceding Drivida. See "Patterns of Thought and Form in Hindu Temple Architecture," (see n. 9). 42 The impact of these eleventh-century experiments is evident in the spread of Vesara architecture in all areas of Kamataka and neighboring regions over more than two hundred years. 43 Michael W. Meister, in "Reading Monuments and Seeing Texts," in Shastnrc Traditions in Indian Arts, ed. Anna Libera Dallapiccola et al. (Stuttgart, 1989), 169, discusses an exchange of features between South and North Indian temples in Karnataka in the seventh century. 44 A recent interest in the makers of sacred monuments is indicated in a set of papers presented at the College Art Association meetings in February 1994 in New York City (see panel titled "Alternate Models: Present-Day Artists Working in the Traditional Modes," chaired byJanice Leoshko, under the auspices of the American Council for South Asian Art). The purpose of the panel was to find models for the role and identity of ancient practitioners in an ethnography of modem folk artists. See also Michael W. Meister (ed.), Making Things in South Asia: The Role ofArtist and Craftsman (Philadelphia, 1988); and Joanna Williams, "From the Fifth to the Twentieth Century and Back," ArtJournal (special issue, New Approaches to South Asian Art) (winter 1990): 363-369.
