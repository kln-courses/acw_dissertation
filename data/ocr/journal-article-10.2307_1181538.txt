Her reinterpretation works most convincingly when she focuses attention on the painting Ameri- can Landscape (1930), a view of the Ford manufac- turing complex seen from across the River Rouge and reflected in its calm water. Questioning Leo Marx's interpretation of the painting in his influ- ential The Machine in the Garden (1964) as "the in- dustrial landscape pastoralized" by a superimposi- tion of "order, peace, and harmony," she points to the tiny figure of a man running along a railway track in the distance-one of the few representa- tions of humanity in Sheeler's paintings and the only instance in which Lucic chooses to use a detail illustration (p. 104). Dwarfed by the factory com- plex, trapped within the lines of its railway tracks, this figure suggests not the ambiguity but the abso- lute horror of a wholly artificial world. Lucic point- edly ends her discussion of industrial landscapes with the ironically named Water (1945), with its vaguely anthropomorphic pumping stations, de- void of human operators, looming grimly over a massive pipeline in a sterile desert. Her reinterpre- tation of Sheeler successfully reveals just how far out of step he was with the celebrants of the ma- chine age even in his earliest work, a fact observed by his friend William Carlos Williams but until now not fully understood.

Dickey was a prolific architect working in Hawaii and California from 1896 to 1941, and he is considered by regional architecture histori- ans, architects, and builders to have been one of Hawaii's leading designers in the pre-World War II period. Dickey's professional achievements in- clude large-scale commissions for educational and medical institutions, religious groups, commer- cial clients, and the government, and designs for private residences. His surviving California work includes the Claremont Hotel in Berkeley and Kahn's Department Store in Oakland, and in Ho- nolulu the Stangenwald Building, Alexander and Baldwin Building, Kamehameha Schools, and the U.S. Immigration Station. A number of houses built by Dickey for wealthy clients in Hawaii also exist. They are typically characterized by steep- pitch, double-hipped roofs, extended eaves, and deep and airy lanais (verandas) appropriate in Hawaii's environment. At least a dozen of his dis- tinctive landmarks have been listed in the National Register of Historic Places, a fact that might have interested Dickey, one of the first preservation ar- chitects in the Islands. With the exception of an interpretive essay and a separate research catalogue of Dickey's buildings by J. Meredith Neil, which appeared in the Papers of the American Association of Architectural Bibli- ographers, and The Hawaiian Journal of History, there has been no reliable, liberally illustrated study of Dickey's architecture until the publication of Robert Jay's The Architecture of Charles W. Dickey: Hawaii and California.' Jay has taken a conventional approach to the subject, one committed to building aesthetics, style, and the visual effects of proportion, shape, and ornament as the major components of architec- tural history. His study is complemented through- out, however, by other historical considerations, most notably a discussion of the role of the pri- vate and public support that generally decided when, what, and how Dickey built. The introduc- tory chapter interprets the historical context of nineteenth-century Honolulu building traditions, drawing upon the research by Neil, Charles E. Peterson, and several Australian architecture historians.2 The Architecture of Charles W. Dickey is organized around three phases of Dickey's career: his early work and partnerships in Hawaii after architec- tural training at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology; twenty years of architectural accom- plishments in Oakland, California; and his profes- sional work in Hawaii from 1925 until his death soon after Pearl Harbor. Jay notes that Dickey was the first person raised in Hawaii to receive a formal architectural education in the United States. His schooling at M.I.T., where he graduated in 1894, 1 J.

As an architecture historicist throughout his career, Dickey was also influenced by the design of early nineteenth-century Western- style buildings in Hawaii. He was particularly fa- miliar with the American mission buildings on Kauai associated with his grandfather, the Rev. William P. Alexander. Alexander was responsible for constructing the Protestant Waioli Mission Church in 1841. The meetinghouse, which Dickey and architect Hart Wood helped to restore in 1920, is a significant example of Anglo-Hawaiian, or bicultural, adaptation in its use of native Hawai- ian and American forms and materials. The Waioli church roof and others like it served as historical models for many of Dickey's later roof designs.3 It is clear that he valued regional historical examples and their memorial and symbolic visual associa- tions along with his academic, classical training in architecture. These helped to give a distinctive identity to Dickey's work, especially after his return to Hawaii from California in 1925. In his chapter on the architect's early years in Honolulu, Jay describes Dickey's partnership with Clinton B. Ripley, a builder with whom he collabo- rated on a number of business and public struc- tures, churches, and houses. Ripley and Dickey's buildings were variations on the Romanesque re- vival and Renaissance revival styles. Their largest and most complicated commission was the six-story Stangenwald Building finished in 1901. Jay writes of the exuberant design that "it was as though the young Dickey had determined to use the entire range of beaux-arts devices, both in the intricate brick masonry and in the application of a great variety of terra-cotta and copper molded decora- tive motifs" (p. 46). In response to the need for fireproofing after a Honolulu Chinatown fire, the Stangenwald Building was raised on a steel frame with concrete foundations and steel and concrete floors. The Ripley and Dickey partnership also pro- duced a number of churches and residences in a variety of historical styles. Only a few of the many houses they designed for the social elite survive, but historical photographs show that many would not have looked out of place in mainland cities. The exceptions are arresting, however, and in- 3Barnes Riznik, Waioli Mission House, Hanalei (Lihue: Grove Farm Homestead and Waioli Mission House, 1987), p. 9; Alan Gowans, Fruitful Fields: American Missionary Churches in Hawaii (Honolulu: State Historical Preservation Division, 1993), PP. 8-42, 105. clude some smaller one-story cottages and bunga- lows that Jay notes, "reflect their most sincere ef- forts to develop a distinctive domestic style for the Islands" (p. 66). In Honolulu houses built for Henry Cooper (1897), A. F. Judd (1899), Irene Ii Brown (1899), and in his own bungalow, Dickey for the first time began to adapt traditional func- tional island building forms. As Jay observes, the lack of preserved original plans and drawings, es- pecially from an architectural office with so much practical and varied building experience, is an un- fortunate documentary gap. One set of Dickey's residential blueprints that Jay overlooked is in the museum library collection of Grove Farm. The house plans are for the one-story cottage Dickey designed in 1903 as the home of Mr. and Mrs. Ralph Wilcox on Kauai. The plans detail Dickey's interest in functional adaptations of Hawaii's phys- ical and social traditions: the kitchen with a wood- burning stove and chimney is separated from the living and sleeping spaces by a covered lanai, fol- lowing the nineteenth-century arrangements of other Hawaiian plantation houses and maintaining the lifestyle preference of the owners. Dickey entered into a new business partnership after 1900 when Ripley decided to specialize in concrete construction and engineering. Dickey joined former Boston architect Edgar Newcomb and designed several schools in Honolulu and on Maui, but opportunities for new contracts began to decline during an economic recession, and he relocated to Oakland where he had family ties. Jay points out that it was an historically opportune time to move to the East Bay: business was boom- ing, and it expanded even more rapidly after the disasterous San Francisco earthquake and fire in 1906. Dickey continued to work in a variety of his- torical revival styles, and his first attempts at Span- ish mission style came in 1905 when he designed the California State Building for the Lewis and Clark Exposition in Portland, Oregon. In collaboration with Walter Reed and facing formidable architectural competition, Dickey's En- glish Tudor design won him the commission for the Claremont Hotel in the Berkeley hills. The 300oo-room structure, still a landmark resort hotel with lofty views of San Francisco Bay, was part of the entrepreneurial scheme of the developers of the new Key Route System, the forerunner of to- day's BART, and was built to provide efficient transportation to San Francisco with electric train and ferries for the growing number of urban and suburban commuters from the East Bay. The Claremont's original building finish of half- 202</page><page sequence="3">Book Reviews timbering and numerous gables and dormers added to Berkeley's dominant, eclectic architec- tural character. In addition to the formal Classical Renaissance campus monuments designed by John Galen Howard for the University of California, ar- chitects and builders in Berkeley were working in a variety of styles: Tudor revival, Spanish mission revival, Moorish and Spanish colonial revival, East- ern American Gothic revival, arts and crafts, and Swiss chalet. Dickey's Claremont rambled to a length of nearly 700 feet, capped by a 14o-foot tower. There was a complex hall, stairway, and ele- vator system connecting seven floors that led guests downstairs to public rooms and verandas and to a separate entrance that accessed the Key Route tracks. Like many new, smaller Berke- ley hillside buildings, the Claremont provided a series of vertical and horizontal physical spaces and visual experiences that challenged "Alice in Wonderland."4 Jay uses documentation found in period photo- graphs and articles Dickey wrote for the Architect and Engineer of California to describe his other suc- cesses in commercial and public building commis- sions in Oakland and Berkeley. Drawing on his experience with the Stangenwald Building in Hono- lulu, Dickey designed the six-story Oakland Bank of Savings with a steel frame and reinforced con- crete floors to be "as nearly earthquake and fire- proof as the achievement of modern skill and sci- ence will permit" (p. 86). In 1909 he designed a mission revival-style residence in Berkeley for gold and oil magnate Howard H. Hart. The 43- room house was not only the largest residence ever built in Berkeley, but it was the largest one Dickey ever designed. Dickey reestablished his connections in Hawaii through several commissions. He was chosen to design the Hawaii Building at the 1915 Panama- Pacific International Exposition in San Francisco and the next year was invited by his cousins on Maui to build a memorial church and a large house for Harry A. Baldwin. Dickey also designed a new Honolulu headquarters for the Castle and Cooke Corporation in 1919. That same year he opened a Honolulu office and brought in Hart Wood, an established San Francisco architect, as his partner. Dickey also prepared a "Garden City Plan" for the development of the Waikiki wetlands, embracing 4 David Gebhard et al., A Guide to Architecture in San Fran- cisco and Northern California (Salt Lake City: Peregrine Smith Books, 1973), pp. 17, 240-71. the planning philosophy of the City Beautiful movement. Dickey's plan was never adopted, how- ever, and the district was laid out in a grid. In 1920 Dickey changed his mind about resum- ing his architectural career in Hawaii when he was chosen as the supervising architect for the Oakland Public Schools, a position that fully occupied him until 1923 when, according to Jay, Dickey was caught in a political and architectural cross fire of rival interests and was dismissed. Dickey took time off after this disruption, vis- iting monuments of medieval and Renaissance ar- chitecture in Europe and avidly collecting architec- tural books. He went as far east as Turkey before he returned to California. In 1925, however, Dickey once again was attracted by design and con- struction opportunities in Honolulu. The final de- sign of the Honolulu Academy of Arts by Bertram Goodhue and Hardie Phillip embraced early Ha- waiian roof forms and appealed to him in strong ways. Dickey became a joint partner with the New York office of Goodhue Associates, and they de- signed a new campus for Kamehameha Schools on Oahu. In 1926 he also renewed his partnership with Wood and moved back to Honolulu. Jay treats Dickey's important architectural work after 1925 in an excellent chapter on the Dickey and Wood partnership, the Alexander and Bald- win Building, the Halekulani cottage hotel, Ka- mehameha Schools, and numerous other commis- sions on Oahu, Maui, Kauai, and the big island of Hawaii that included restoration of the historical Mission House in Honolulu and Mokuaikaua Church in Kailua-Kona. In all his later building designs, Jay suggests, Dickey maintained what he described as "well balanced and well proportioned masses, graceful lines and a pleasing color effect" (p. 166). His urban building designs in Honolulu and Hilo were "low rise." Most had large entrance porticos, deep porches, strict rectilinear fenestra- tion, and double-hipped roofs combined with or- namental details that included stylized Chinese decoration and Hawaiian-inspired floral forms ex- pressed in enamel tile and terra-cotta. Dickey's buildings remained restrained; they were classical, in the Western sense, but they were also regional. The structures were the mature reflections on Dickey's career of architectural work; moreover, they were serene expressions of his self-awareness with a quality that created an individual sense of place for Hawaii's formal architectural environ- ment fifty years ago. If there is a significant limitation to The Architec- ture of Charles W. Dickey as an interpretation of the 203</page><page sequence="4">204 stylistic development of the architect's work in Hawaii and the East Bay, it may be found in Jay's thin treatment of Dickey's later residential commis- sions. Jay mentions the openness, cross-ventilation and integration of lanais into large interior rooms, but we learn little of the relationship of Dickey's pre-war residential designs in Hawaii to the deco- rative arts and landscape architecture. Some of Dickey's private houses were inspired by the Hono- lulu Academy of Arts (1927) where architecture, the art collections, shady courtyard gardens, and the adjacent Thomas Square park coexisted in equilibrium, and it would be valuable to have had a closer focus on the interiors, garden plantings, and site planning of Dickey's later houses. Neil's previous research on environmental design in Hawaii, particularly his bibliography on residential landscaping, is not fully utilized by Jay, and there are too few references to luxurient vegetation and tropical shade trees, and to visual relationships cre- ated by buildings, plantings, and sites. Jay concludes his study with an assessment of architecture in Hawaii in the postwar period and the impact of mainstream modernism and urban development. He cites the few examples of de- sign that he finds achieve a true spirit of regional architecture. The Architecture of Charles W. Dickey deepens un- derstanding of regional formal architecture in pre-World War II Hawaii, and an observation made by architect Alfred Preis, who practiced in Hawaii from 1943 to 1963, seems to fit C. W. Dickey's architectural legacy: "In a world where everybody reads the same architectural magazines and where ever increasing land costs shrink open spaces required for air flow into uselessness, it is difficult to maintain hope for architecture custom- made to regional requirements. "On the other hand, we are physically insulated by at least 2,500 miles of open sea from other in- habited areas. We are composed of nothing but ethnocultural minorities, each striving for self- awareness and expression. And we are, most im- portantly, geographically so small that even a few successful architectural examples can contribute to a sense of place."5 BARNES RIZNIK Waioli Mission House and Grove Farm Homestead 5 "Architecture: Yesterday, Today, and Tomorrow: An In- terview with Alfred Preis, FAIA-ME," Hawaii Architect 13, no. 12 (December 1984): 9.

Alison Lurie's 1988 novel The Truth about Lorin Jones tells the tale of an art historian named Polly Adler, who takes on the task of writing the biogra- phy of a "lost woman artist," the abstract painter Lorin Jones. Her intention is to champion Jones as a positive feminist role model, a heroine, "an unrecognized genius destroyed by the male [art] establishment" of post-World War II. Polly runs into problems, however, when she uncovers vari- ous inconsistent, and definitely not feminist, as- pects of Jones's not-so-heroic personal history and when she recognizes, further, that the book she is writing will have an enormous impact on her own entry into the art world. Polly's dilemma is thus: if she writes an ex- panded catalogue raisonne of Jones, casting her as an eccentric genius lovingly supported by her gen- erous and tolerant husband, her dealer, and her patrons, she is assured of her own success, glowing reviews, and further art world projects. "You've got her paintings, that's all you need to make a good book," one character tells her. If, on the other hand, she sticks with her original goal of feminist recovery, she will either have to lie or suavely accommodate Jones's imperfections and will certainly alienate her newfound professional connections. Still another approach-representing Jones as an innocent woman controlled by manipu- lative men and a victim of bad love and cruel life- might generate an Irving Stone cum Danielle Steel best-seller (The Agony and the Ecstasy meets Passion's Promise), as popular success seems guaranteed al- most any gossipy account of the stereotypical boozy, lusty, and lunatic artist. Such an angle, how- ever, would not do much for Polly's art history career choice or her feminist motives. In the end, Polly opts to "take a chance" and write an "un- focused and inconsistent" biography, "the whole truth about Lorin Jones, with all the contradictions left in."2 Lurie's book is really about the problems of writing history, about recognizing that writing his- 1 Alison Lurie, The Truth about Lorin Jones (Boston: Little, Brown, 1988). 2 Lurie, Truth about Lorin Jones, p. 32, 327.</page></plain_text>
