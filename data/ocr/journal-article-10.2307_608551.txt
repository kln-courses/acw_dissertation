<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Place of Politics in the Philosophy of Ibn Rushd By ERWIN I. J. ROSENTHAL 1 rT HE significance of Political Philosophy for the philosophy of Islam and Judaism in the Middle Ages has been recognized in recent years, and the importance of Plato's Republic and Laws together with Aristotle's Nicomachean Ethics for the faldsifa is becoming increasingly evident. Attention has been drawn to Alfarabi's political treatises, to Ibn Bajja, to Averroes' Commentaries on Plato's Republic and on Aristotle's Nicomachean Ethics, to Ibn al-Tiqtaqa and to Ibn Khaldun. The reception of Platonic and Aristotelian political ideas conditions-in varying degrees-the attitude of the faldsifa to the State as such, to the Muslim State in particular, and therefore to the SharV'a of Islam and to Greek philosophy, both practical and theoretical. This is already clear from the writings of Alfarabi, but in his attempt at blending and harmonizing Greek-Hellenistic and Islamic conceptions no Alfarabian philosophy proper with distinct features of a definitive, authoritatively formulated synthesis emerges. It was left to Averroes-to use the name by which Ibn Rushd was generally known to the West-to work out a peculiarly Islamic religious philosophy. He establishes in unequivocal terms the supreme authority of the Shar^'a and its identity of purpose with falsafa, religious philosophy in the Fasl al-maqdl, the Mandhij, the Tahdfut al-tahdfut and his Commentary on Plato's Republic. The last named forms the main subject of the present article. In an earlier study it was considered in connexion with his Commentary on Aristotle's Nicomachean Ethics already, but not with his other treatises just mentioned. This is, however, necessary in order to gain a correct, balanced view of his philosophy, and especially of his political thought. It is equally important to see his political Commentaries against the background of his active life as qadd and of contem- porary Muslim history in the Maghreb. The views here offered are the result of a study of the Commentary on the Republic in this setting. At this juncture they are still provisional. Some aspects require further study, others will remain hypothetical as long as we have to rely on the Hebrew version of the lost Arabic original of this as well as of his Commentary on the Nicomachean Ethics, and as long as Ibn Rushd's theological and legal treatises are not found. But it is hoped that my views will 1 This article offers an interpretation of Ibn Rushd's Commentary on Plato's Republic in the context of his other writings. It is the result of work on the edition of the Hebrew version of the Arabic original which is presumed lost.

Though reference to this forthcoming publication is made constantly the present article forms the general conclusions drawn from it and warrants separate publication, the more so since it contains matter not connected with the edition of a text.

I. CRITIQUE OF THE MUSLIM STATE OF HIS TIME 1. The nature of the Commentary on the Republic is clear proof that it is more than a substitute for the Politics of Aristotle-though it is this too, as Averroes himself tells us; for it differs fundamentally from his other Com- mentaries. In the first place it contains a comparatively large number of references to the political history of the Maghreb in the 11th and 12th centuries which-as is stressed in the notes on these passages in my edition-are far more than illustrations: they represent a critique of a Muslim philosopher who is a disciple of Plato and Aristotle, whose political philosophy he takes very seriously and applies to his own civilization and its State and Society, past and present. Then we meet with strong criticism of certain persons and classes of contem- porary society, like the mutakallimiun, on the lines of his criticism and strictures in his religious-philosophical, polemical treatises (Fasl, Mandhij, Tahdfut al-tahdfut). This criticism is an important aspect of his opposition to dialectical as against demonstrative arguments and of his claim that the speculative philosopher is alone qualified and entitled to search for and explain the inner meaning of those passages in Qur'dn, Hadith, and Shar' which require expert interpretation by and for the adept of philosophical sciences. In other words, the correct interpretation of religious beliefs and convictions is the business of the failasaf, the religious philosopher. It is for this reason that Averroes stresses his exclusive concern for the theoretical statements contained in the Republic and insists on the employment of demonstrative proof. Finally, seen in the context of his philosophy as a whole, Averroes' references to the SharV'a of Islam-often in contrast to Plato's vo/Los and its use in Aristotle-constitute perhaps the most important of the distinguishing features of this Commentary. For the Sharn'a is not merely adduced as an illustration of Plato's argument, as a clever stratagem to secure a superficial adaptation to Islamic concepts and conditions for the benefit of Muslim readers and for his own safety. Nay, it serves to explain the religious law of Islam in terms of the Ideal Constitution on the basis and with the help of Plato's discussion of the Ideal State and its deviations. Just as Plato measures the character of State and individual by the standards of the Justice that inspires the law of the Ideal State, so does Ibn Rushd contrast the contemporary Muslim scene with the rule of the SharV'a in the time of the four khulafd rdshidtn. 2. Averroes stresses the obligation of the speculative philosopher to remain in the state and fulfil his duties of citizenship. If he were to isolate himself-as Ibn Bajja advocates in his TadbTr al-mutawahhid-he would forfeit highest perfection and ultimate happiness. Averroes is thus a true disciple of his masters in Political Science, Plato and Aristotle, as I have stated elsewhere. Since 247</page><page sequence="3">E. I. J. ROSENTHAL- the philosopher cannot rule except in the Ideal State, he must serve the community in another capacity. In his Commentary on De Partibus Animalium (Venice edition, f. 103b) Averroes tells us that the performance of his public duties occupied much of his time: ' Nobis tamen non est concessa huiusmodi facultas hac nostra tempestate, neque in hac provincia nostra, immo si aliquid incidentur scivimus de his rebus, est quid minimum. Cuius rei veritatem cognoscet qui nostram hanc tempestatem viderit, vel hanc provinciam nostram, scil. Andalugiae: et quot damna passi sumus nos, et alij homines sunt passi multos labores ad necessarias res adipiscendas, quibus conservatur sanitas corporea...' Similar passages in the Commentary, e.g. his comment on Republic 567 about the people of Cordova under Ibn Ghaniya, or about himself at the end of this and in others of his Commentaries reflect his preoccupation as qadz and as personal physician to the Almohad amir al-mu'minn Abiu Ya'qub Yusuf-in succession to Ibn Tufail. Remembering what Plato said about judges and physicians and particularly Aristotle's definition in the Nicomachean Ethics (x, 9, 1180b) of jurisprudence as a branch of political science, we realize how well qualified Averroes was to observe the political scene and to pronounce upon it. If the office of qadd under the Almohads corresponded to what it was under the Almoravids who preceded them, it meant for its holder much more than applyingfiqh in the law courts. It constituted the highest civil authority as we know from Ibn Rushd's grandfather Abu Walid, Grand Qadi of Cordova, who crossed over to North Africa in 1126 to secure the active help of the Almoravid amir al-muslimin, 'Ali b. Yusuf b. Tashfin, against the Christian threat to Cordova. (It is not without irony to find the grandson criticizing the very man whom the Almoravid ruler appointed governor of Eastern Spain--with residence in Cordova-Yahya b. 'All b. Ghaniya as a result of the grandfather's mission, if my identification of him with the Ibn Ghaniya of our Commentary is correct.) His office enabled Averroes to gain insight into the administration of the Almohad State and thus offered ample opportunity to test Plato's theories in practical politics. Yet this would not account sufficiently for the telling criticism of contemporary events and persons. It cannot be ruled out entirely that the unfavourable judgment on the Almoravids was proffered at least partly for personal motives in order to cover up his family's connexion with these enemies of the now ruling dynasty. This applies in particular to the criticism levelled against a member of the Banu Ghaniya, symbol and rallying point of Almoravid opposition. In his comment on Plato's discussion of the transformation of the timocratic into the plutocratic man and their corresponding states Averroes says: ' In general, the transformation of the timocratic into the hedonistic man is obvious, be it that he takes delight in money or in the other remaining pleasures. The same seems to apply to the timocratic and the hedonistic state. For the plutocratic and the hedonistic state belong to the same category. We often see kings becoming corrupted into such like men. Similarly there is in our time the kingdom of the men known as Almoravids. At first they were imitating 248</page><page sequence="4">THE PLACE OF POLITICS IN THE PHILOSOPHY OF IBN RUSHD the constitution based on the Law-this under the first of them [Yusuf b. Tashfin]-then they changed [it] under his son ['All b. Yisuf b. Tashfin] into the timocratic [constitution] together with an admixture in him of the love of money as well. Further, it changed under his grandson into the hedonistic [constitution] . .. and perished in his time. The reason was that the constitu- tion which was opposed to it at that time resembled the constitution based on the Law.' (III. xi, 4-5.) A similar comment is offered with regard to the transformation of the Ideal State-' the government of the Arabs in the earliest period '-into the timocratic one. ' For they used to imitate the ideal constitu- tion and then were transformed in the days of Mu'awiya into timocratic men; and so it seems to be the case with the constitution that exists now in these islands.' (III. ix, 13.) The end of III. xi, 5, and ix, 13, seem to refer to the Almohads, in the first passage to Ibn Tumart and 'Abd al-Mu'min, in the second to Averroes' two masters, Abu Ya'qib Yusuf and Yusuf Abu Ya'qub al-Mansur. A similar comment is again offered in connexion with the transition of democracy into tyranny and the corresponding rulers: 'You can discern this from the democratic rule that exists in our time, for it frequently changes into tyranny. Take for example the rule existing in our own country, i.e. Cordova, after 500 [A.H.]. For it was almost completely democratic, [but] then after 540 [A.H.] it turned into tyranny.' (xv, 13.) If we compare this comment with that in xi, 5, quoted above, we notice that what is called timocracy there is called democracy here. The contradiction can perhaps be resolved by assuming that 'democratic' refers to the Council of the Almoravids as representing the jama'a of Almoravid Islam in the Maghreb ? Further, when discussing tyranny and its effect on the citizens smarting under it, Averroes says: 'All these acts of tyrants are, indeed, evident to the men of our own time, not through a dissertation alone, but also through their sense-perception and evidence.' (III. xvi, 7.) It is difficult not to refer this courageous utterance to Averroes' own experience and it may be explained as referring to the administration rather than to the Almohad caliph himself. It may, however, apply to the muluk al-tawd'if and the Almoravids, especially Ibn Ghaniya. There is support for this interpretation in Averroes' comment on the change human dispositions undergo in the wake of a change in the laws governing State and Society: ' You can discern this in the qualities and morals that have sprung up among us after the year 40 [540 A.H.] among the rulers and dignitaries. For because the timocratic constitution in which they had grown up was weakened, they came by these vile character traits which they now [exhibit]. Of them he only perseveres in the excellent virtues who is excellent in accordance with the religious laws, and this is rare among them.' (III. xix, 5.) This outspoken criticism of Almoravid rule is significant, together with ix, 13 and xi, 5, in that it shows two important trends in Averroes' political thought. In the first place Averroes is quite in keeping with the orthodox interpretation of the Ideal Muslim Polity under the four khulafd rdshidin which was perverted by the mulk of Mu'awiya, for which Averroes uses the Platonic term 'timocracy'. He is 249</page><page sequence="5">E. I. J. ROSENTHAL- clearly in earnest when he applies Platonic observations and thought-categories to Islamic civilization, and thus considers Platonic notions-conditioned by Greek concepts and institutions-as fully valid general principles, applicable to Muslim concepts and institutions. The analogy is not simply an illustration but the outcome of the recognition of Greek political thinking as relevant to Islamic thought and practice. Yet, Averroes made one very important modifica- tion and this is the second trend in his political thought: he saw Greek thought with the eyes of an orthodox Muslim who acknowledges the absolute authority of the SharV'a. In this sense, his assertion about the religious laws, just quoted, clearly implies two related concepts: the identification of the Ideal State with the Islamic, i.e. SharV'a, State, and the conviction of the superiority of the excellent religious law. But he is realist enough to add that its observance is rare. We also note that in his critique of contemporary Muslim history in the Maghreb he attaches great importance to the year 540 A.H. as a turning point in the Platonic sense. Since these quotations are at least in part clearly directed against Almohad administration an ulterior motive, assumed as not entirely unthinkable, is not very likely in the man who wrote the Fasl and the Mandhij. Nor is it very plausible that he attacked the Almoravids in order to distract attention from his criticism of the existing Almohad State. It seems more reasonable to see in these criticisms, together with his references to family-associations centred in a household and his identification of 'imam-states' or 'imam-parts ' within existing states-which will occupy us presently-a concerted effort on the part of an exponent of practical philosophy in the meaning Aristotle gave to this term, to influence the course of history by subjecting contemporary politics to a sustained critique. This critique takes the SharV'a as its norm and is waged with the weapons which Plato's and Aristotle's political philosophy furnish. There is, therefore, meaning and significance in the parallels drawn as a matter of course between the vices, defects, faults, and errors which Plato adduces as evidence for the uselessness of philosophers in his day, for the necessary transformation of the various constitutions from one to another as the result of the bad character of the rulers on the one hand, and recent and contemporary Muslim history in Spain on the other. These parallels are intended as object lessons for his countrymen. The judge-physician turned political critic as the disciple of Plato and Aristotle. However, an element of uncertainty remains since we cannot be sure-in the absence of the Arabic original-whether the Hebrew translator renders accurately Ibn Rushd's thought. 3. There remains one further group of references to contemporary states: the imam-state, madina imSmzya in Ibn Bajja. Averroes clearly distinguishes between two kinds of 'priestly' states, as we have to translate literally the Hebrew equivalent. The one known as having existed among the ancient Persians is quoted by Ibn Bajja on the authority of Alfarabi. It is possible that such a reference was contained in Alfarabi's lost Commentary on the 250</page><page sequence="6">THE PLACE OF POLITICS IN THE PHILOSOPHY OF IBN RUSHD Nicomachean Ethics where Aristotle, however, refers to Persian rule as tyrannical, as Plato does in his Laws. Averroes says in II. xvii, 5: ' States that are excellent in deeds alone are called " priestly " ' [i.e. they are imam-states], with reference to the ancient Persians. (We shall come back to this definition presently.) The other imam-state is linked with tyranny by Averroes and con- nected with contemporary Muslim states. In III. iv, 11, he speaks of the democratic state as in utmost opposition to the tyrannical one. Economic power is in the hands of the ruling family; bayt has here the meaning of dawla. Averroes goes on: 'For this reason the " priestly " part in them is to-day completely tyrannical.' In III. v, 6, he points again to 'the similarity that exists between the imam- and tyrannical states in that the " priestly " parts ... are transformed into the tyrannical ones and disparage him whose aim in respect of them is " priestly ", as is the case ... in the states to be found in our time '. What connects the two kinds of imam-state is naturally the word imam, defined by Averroes in II. i, 6, as the one 'whom one follows [as chief] in his actions '. This definition, together with the equation of philosopher with imam is borrowed literally from Alfarabi. If we are justified in treating the adduced passages as a whole for the purpose of their application to Averroes' own State it appears that a dynasty is meant which is inspired by the SharV'a and whose head looks upon himself as imam in the sense this word has in orthodox Sunnite Islam. III. v, 6, may then be interpreted as an attempt to exculpate the caliph Abu Ya'quib Yfsuf, his patron, from complicity with his ministers responsible for the administration of the Almohad State. For Ibn Rushd emphasizes the caliph's intention to be the imam, as represented by his father 'Abd al-Mu'min, the founder of the dynasty. In that sense Leo Africanus speaks in his Descriptio Africae of the Almohads as pontifices. (But his statements must be treated with reserve.) There is a possibility that these passages refer to the Almoravids. Yet this seems unlikely since Averroes criticizes and condemns them elsewhere in his Commentary-with the exception of their founder-and the phrase 'in this our time ' rather points to the Almohads. I can only say with Averroes: ' this is a matter for [further] consideration'. 4. The Position of Women.-Ibn Rushd's critical attitude to State and Society of his time is also shown in his outspoken pronouncement on women and their status in contemporary Islam. It is also an interesting application of Plato's ideas about the equality of women as far as civic duties are concerned. The relevant passages are found in the first treatise of the Commentary (xxv, 6-10). It is for our purpose sufficient to quote paragraphs 9 and 10-Averroes' application to his own time and place: ' Yet, in these states the ability of women is not known, only because they are being taken for procreation alone therein. They are therefore placed at the service of their husbands and [relegated] to the position of procreation, for rearing and [breast] feeding. But this undoes their [other] activities. Because women in these states are not being fitted for any of the human virtues it often happens that they resemble plants. That they are a burden upon the men in these states is one of the reasons for the poverty of 251</page><page sequence="7">E. I. J. ROSENTHAL- these states. For, they are found in them in twice the number of men while at the same time they do not support any (or: carry on most) of the necessary [essential] activities, except for a few, which they undertake mostly at a time when they are obliged to make up their want of funds, like spinning and weaving. All this is self-evident.' This pronouncement runs counter to Islamic teaching and practice and is the more remarkable since it is made by an orthodox member of the Muslim community which was ruled by the amir al-mu'minin, and moreover by a practising lawyer steeped in fiqh. He openly attacks their way of life as the result of the official attitude. It is clear that Plato's ideas must have drawn Averroes' attention to the wastage of human labour so detrimental to the State, and led him to advocate a reversal of orthodox Muslim policy. It is the more surprising that this realistic criticism of the position of women in Islam and its bad effect on the economic health of the nation should have gone unnoticed, together with his repeated critical remarks about the contemporary Muslim state as a whole and some of its prominent classes. For as far as I am aware no trace can be found in the sources that his enemies and opponents used them against him. Yet it may well be that they meant this criticism when they allegedly cast doubt upon his orthodoxy, though the sources give different, conflicting reasons for his temporary disgrace. 5. 'Philosophers ' and Dialectic Theologians.-Ibn Rushd's criticism so far discussed has been rather guarded with the exception of the last example. But his defence of hikma (or falsafa) and the faldsifa is bold and explicit as is his criticism of the 'false' philosophers, the ' sophists' of his own day, and his attack upon the theologians, especially the mutakallimiun among them. Since he identifies himself with Plato's strictures on the ' sophists' in the latter's time no quotation of the relevant passages is required. Averroes' own contribu- tion is simply a reference to so-called philosophers in his own time and the extension of the term 'sophist' to the mutakallimiun. Berber fanaticism created an atmosphere singularly uncongenial to the unhampered development of a speculative philosophy which was conscious-in the vein of Plato and Aristotle- of its political obligation to the community. The true philosophers were, no doubt, few and could pursue their search for truth only under the protection of the Muslim rulers. Our sources tell us that the two masters of Averroes were highly educated men with a strong bent for philosophy, as the life and work of Ibn Tufail and Averroes clearly show. But the rulers had to reckon with the opposition of the 'ulanm and fuqahd, who wielded absolute authority over the masses. Especially the mutakallimiun viewedfalsafa and the faldsifa with hostile suspicion. (It is possible that Averroes' temporary disgrace in 1195 on the eve of the caliph's departure for a jihdd against the Christians was an expedient to appease these groups and the masses under their influence.) In such an atmosphere philosophy could not- flourish except for a few elect, fearless personalities. It is mainly for this reason that Averroes stands out as the last thinker of note in the Muslim West, with whose passing religious philosophy 252</page><page sequence="8">THE PLACE OF POLITICS IN THE PHILOSOPHY OF IBN RUSHD declined. Another contributory reason was naturally the Christian advance leading in the end to the reconquest of the whole of Spain. In order to understand Averroes' opposition to kaldm and its adherents, the mutakallimtn, one must recognize that both faldsifa and mutakallimin claimed the right and the duty of rational explanation of the beliefs and con- victions of the Muslim jamd'a which lived under the absolute authority of the religious law-the Shari'a. It was Averroes' aim-once he had convinced himself of the inadequacy of kaldm authoritatively to interpret the religious beliefs and convictions of Islam, and of the danger to what he understood to be their purity, for the maintenance of orthodoxy and a united jamd'a-to establish the superiority of falsafa as the exclusive custodian of the Shari'a and its sole legitimate and authoritative interpreter. He achieved this by applying the Aristotelian distinction between dialectical and demonstrative arguments to Islam. It is for this reason that he wrote his three complementary treatises, Fasl with DamTma and Mandhij, in defence of the superiority of the Shari'a; and he deduced from the identity of aim between Shari'a and falsafa the warrant of the latter for the interpretation of the former with the help of demonstration. It is precisely in this context that we must understand his insistence, in his Commentary on the Republic, on demonstrative arguments and his attack upon the mutakallimun when he stresses-as Alfarabi did before him in his K. tahs7l al-sa'dda (ed. Hyderabad, 45, 5 ff. and, before, already 43, 18 ff.)-that the philosopher must have the right religious beliefs and convictions. The Platonic demand that right beliefs and convictions are absolutely essential in the philosopher-statesman is simply brought into line with the overruling authority of the divinely revealed prophetic law, the SharV'a. It is, therefore, necessary to deal with Averroes' insistence on demonstrative argument in the wider context of the relation between SharT'a and falsafa. II. RELIGIOUS LAW AND RELIGIOUS PHILOSOPHY 1. In discussing the various ideas about the Highest Good Averroes states (II. vi, 4) : 'But as for that which the religious laws in our own time think of this matter it is what God wills. But the only way to know what this matter is that God wills ... is [through] prophecy. This knowledge is, if you investigate the laws, divided into abstract knowledge alone-such as our religious law commands regarding the perception of God-and into practice-such as the ethical virtues it enjoins. Its intention with this purpose is in essence the intention of philosophy. ..' He expresses the same idea in the Fasl thus al-hikma hiya sahibat al-shari'ati wa-l-ukht al-radV'a (ed. Gauthier, 32) and in another passage he uses almost identical terms: (22) maqs?fd al-shar' innamd huwa ta'lim al-'ilmi-l-haqqi wa-l-'amal al-haqq wa-l-'ilm al-haqq huwa ma'rifat- Allah ta'dla wasd'iri-l-maujaddt 'ald md hiya 'alayhi ... It is the merit of the distinguished interpreter of Muslim philosophy, Leon Gauthier, to have recognized and convincingly demonstrated the signal importance of the Fasl 253</page><page sequence="9">E. I. J. ROSENTHAL- al-maqtl as the decisive treatise of Averroes' philosophy, and I am in substantial agreement with his analysis. Yet I am, to my regret, unable to agree with a number of his conclusions, and a few observations are necessary here. The title of Gauthier's profound and important book: La theorie d'lbn Rochd sur les rapports de la religion et de la philosophie already indicates a misunderstanding of the fundamental character of the correlation between SharV'a and falsafa, religious law and religious philosophy. This has arisen from the translation 'religion' for shar' or sharV'a instead of 'la loi religieuse '. Averroes is very concise and careful in his terminology and uses dTn or milla if he wants to express religion meaning faith. We shall never understand Islam, Judaism, and their religious philosophers unless we recognize that an all-embracing, compre- hensive, perfect' law' is the core and pivot of both religious ways of life, binding upon elect and masses alike, in its preceptive parts of moral and ceremonial laws no less than in its theoretical part : its teaching about God, the Universe, man's place in it and his relation to God, in other words right beliefs and convictions. But there is this important difference between the elect philosophers and the masses of varying degrees of intellectual receptiveness-a distinction made by all faldsifa and their Jewish followers: the philosophers must attempt a rational interpretation of these beliefs and convictions-apart from those inaccessible to human reason-and their results will of necessity agree with the findings of pure reason. The masses, on the other hand, must accept these beliefs and convictions in their external sense. There can thus be no question of Faith versus Reason, but it is rather a contrast between intelligent and naive, unquestioning faith. Gauthier's distinction between religion-which is ' d'ordre pragmatique '-and philosophy-which is 'de l'ordre de la verite pure' misses this vital point. In fact, he himself raises objections to his formulation that ' la doctrine philosophique qui s'en [in the Fasl] degage est un rationalisme sans reserve ' and admits that-according to the Fasl-there are texts in the religious law of Islam which nobody has a right to interpret-their external sense must be accepted by all men (109)-or that philosophical interpretation must not go so far as to deny what is stated in the text of the Qur'an or Hadcth. His answers that the understanding of those texts is accessible to all three kinds of arguments (persuasive, dialectical, and demonstrative), and that revelation cannot teach anything which reason cannot apprehend do in no way, to my mind, invalidate his objections. Like several other scholars, he attributes to Averroes a rationalism quite alien to the Middle Ages and akin to the rationalism of 18th-century Aufklaerung. This is clear from his statement (108): 'Peut-etre vaudrait-il mieux dire que le symbole revele, la religion indispensable a la masse, est utile, mais que la philosophie seule est pleinement vraie.' Or (120) : ' L'enseignement dogmatique donne par les religions n'a point pour fin, comme celui de la philosophie, la verite speculative, mais seulement l'utlite morale de tous pour la vie future.' It is well to remember that the medieval philosopher is a unitary personality and not split into traditionalist in so-called religion and sovereign intellect in philosophy; the more so since in the Middle Ages there did not exist 254</page><page sequence="10">THE PLACE OF POLITICS IN THE PHILOSOPHY OF IBN RUSHD a speculative philosophy in abstract purity and sovereign independence, but only a religious philosophy which was conditioned by a revealed law that taught truth to perfection; and, we may add, there was only one truth which both ' religion' and philosophy sought after, albeit by a different method. The real problem is how to harmonize the findings of human reason with the help of the demonstrative arguments of the speculative philosopher, with the teachings of a law divinely revealed through prophecy and embodied in the SharV'a. To this problem Muslims and Jews devoted their minds trained in the traditional science offiqh (halakhah among the Jews). They fully and unreservedly acknow- ledged the authority of their prophetic law. Consequently they met the challenge of Greek and Hellenistic philosophy as religious minds. This challenge was in the name of sovereign human reason. The answer Muslim and Jewish medieval religious philosophy gave represents its signal, original contribution to the culture of the West. Gauthier has shown convincingly that the charge of irreligion levelled against Ibn Rushd is completely unfounded and utterly false. It is the more surprising that he should have come to such a conclusion (41): ' pour les philosophes, rationalisme esoterique, absolu, pour le vulgaire, fideisme exoterique absolu : pour les theologiens qui forment une classe hybride, semi- rationalisme et semi-fideisme, c'est-a-dire license de s'adonner entre eux au petit jeu des interpretations dialectiques, inconsistantes et variees, mais a la condition expresse de ne s'y livrer qu'en secret, avec defense d'en rien communiquer au vulgaire, sous peine des plus severes chatiments.' Nor is his categorical assertion, I regret to say, tenable (111): 'En resume, le Fagl el maqal d'Ibn Rochd est le plus profond commentaire qu'on ait jamais donne de cette formule celebre: I1 faut une religion pour le peuple ... Loin de subor- donner en quoi que ce soit la philosophie a la religion, ce traite, en somme, subordonne categoriquement la religion a la philosophie.' But he is right in stressing the essential unity of the 'dogmatic' treatises (Fasl and Mandhij) and the Tahhfut al-tahfiut. He sees the key to this unity in 'la theorie philosophique commune a tous les falacifa, de l'intuition mystique dont l'inspiration prophetique n'est qu'un cas particulier '. I think we can agree with this if we substitute intuitive reason in the Aristotelean meaning of the term for Gauthier's intuition mystique which may be correct for Ibn Bajja and Ibn Tufail, but certainly not for Averroes. The writings of Alfarabi and Avicenna and particularly Averroes' Com- mentaries on Plato's Republic and on Aristotle's Nicomachean Ethics show, indeed, the connexion between SharV'a and falsafa, but also equally clearly the vital link of both with Politics, which Gauthier does not seem to have noticed, but L. Strauss has. This will be elaborated later on, in connexion with Averroes' spirited defence of the Shart'a. For the moment the place Averroes assigns to demonstrative argument in philosophy and theology must be more fully illustrated. 2. Demonstrative Arguments.-In the Commentary on the Republic Ibn Rushd distinguishes two main groups of arguments-borrowed from Aristotle-and 255</page><page sequence="11">E. I. J. ROSENTHAL- assigns their use to two corresponding groups of men : demonstrative arguments are used by and for the elect few-the metaphysicists-and dialectical, rhetorical, and poetical arguments are used in teaching the masses. The second group includes the mutakallimun, who use jadal, dialectical argument, and are unable to rise to burhdn, demonstrative proof. It is characteristic for Averroes the religious philosopher to attack the dialectic theologians. The reason is that falsafa and SharV'a both teach true knowledge, that is knowledge of God and Existing Things. It can be gained only by means of aqdwil burhdn7ya, demon- strative arguments. Averroes aims to establish-in the Fasl-a claim for the falasifa alone to possess a legitimate title to the interpretation of the parts of the Shari'a which require interpretation by means of burhdn. The masses must be satisfied with the plain, external meaning, and the philosophers must not divulge the results of their rational inquiry to them since it would lead to con- fusion and error, even schism. For the masses are incapable by natural disposi- tion of rising to an understanding of the hidden, inner meaning of revealed truth. But the philosopher must bring about unity between the infallible truth of the SharT'a and the truth of the philosopher arrived at by demonstrative argument. From the point of view of the SharV'a a third group had to be included by dividing the second group of arguments into dialectical on the one hand, and rhetorical and poetical on the other. Averroes is not opposed to the interpreters of tradition as long as they restrict themselves to fiqh and its interpretation. But he resents their intrusion into the realm of doctrine. For dialectical arguments are insufficient for the rational interpretation of beliefs and convictions. This is, in his opinion, the preserve of the philosophers. But as a devout Muslim he is not only conscious of the intellectual inferiority of the mutakallimi,n, but apprehensive lest heresy and schism be the result of the divisions in their interpretation which they divulge to the masses. This criticism is directed in the first place against the Ash'arites. The SharV'a contains all three classes of arguments and thus appeals to all three classes of Muslims. Consequently, it teaches each class in a manner appropriate to it, truth which cannot contradict that arrived at by demonstration (Fasl, 7). Gauthier makes out a good case for the Fasl agreeing with Almohad doctrine as modified by the successors of the Mahdi Ibn Tumart. That Averroes was in full agreement with the religious policy of the two caliphs whom he served, is evident from the concluding sentences of the Fasl and does not contradict his criticism of the political and economic organization of their State with which I have dealt before. He has learnt from Plato as well as from Muslim history to distinguish between the ideal Republic and the imperfect States which represent its perversion. The object of the Almohad revolt was to replace Almoravid misrule by pure orthodoxy and to reform Muslim Spain. He says (Fasl 33): 'Allah has removed many of these evils [hatred and enmity through sects, e.g.], follies and erroneous ways through this ruling power and has made a path for many good things, and in particular for those who follow the way of speculation and are eager for a knowledge of the truth ... He has called the masses-in 256</page><page sequence="12">THE PLACE OF POLITICS IN THE PHILOSOPHY OF IBN RUSHD respect of the knowledge of God-to a middle way which is far above the low level of the muqallidtn [who relied in their interpretation offiqh on the authority of an independent interpreter, mujtahid] but below the disputatiousness of the mutakallimin. He has awakened the elect to the need for complete theoretical inquiry into the root-principle of the Shar;'a.' This may mean that the Almohads have caused the masses of the people-kept ignorant under the Almoravids-to be instructed in the plain, external meaning of the Shari'a and have encouraged thefaldsifa to apply demonstrative arguments to the interpreta- tion of the inner meaning of it. A brief description of their religious policy is therefore necessary, in accordance with I. Goldziher's authoritative exposition. The most important feature of Ibn Tumart's revolutionary doctrine seems to me to be his insistence on knowledge of the Shar;'a in addition to the observance of its regulations. Faith must be supplemented by knowledge of God. It does seem to me that Averroes takes his cue from here for his justifica- tion from Scripture of rational endeavour to acquire a knowledge of God as revealed in the SharT'a-which is based on Qur'an, Sunna, Had7th, and ijmd'. Averroes must also be in agreement with Ibn Tumart in his exclusion of zann and ra'y from interpretation as subjective. But he would presumably not agree to the exclusion of qiyds 'aqlU from the usUl al-fiqh. (Ibn Tumart allowed only the use of qiyds shar'i in legal deduction.) Nor would he follow Ibn Tumart in matters of theology, bearing in mind his opposition to Ash'arism. We know that he wrote a large commentary (sharh) on Ibn Tfmart's 'aqTda, which is unfor- tunately lost. The gradual estrangement of the second and especially the third Almohad caliphs from Ibn Tumart's theology, combined with their almost exclusive concern with fiqh helped Ibn Rushd to persist in his anti-Ash'arism without incurring the disfavour of his masters. This applies in particular to his strong opposition to the use of ta'wTl, allegorical interpretation, of which Ibn Tumart had approved. Abu Yusuf Ya'qub declared himself against taql;d and furiu' and, according to al-Marrakushi (134) ordered the burning of Malikite fiqh books. On the other hand, Ibn Tamart's branding of the Almoravid adherence to tajsim, anthropomorphism, as kufr-thus raising his opposition to a religious revolution and his war against them to a jihjd-was upheld. Though the matter requires further careful study it seems to me at the moment that Averroes tended more to the views of Ibn Hazm, especially where he differed from Ibn Tumart. Points of contact between Averroes and Ibn Hazm following Goldziher's monograph Die Zahiriten-are briefly these, which are of immediate relevance to my interpretation of Averroes' thought. Ibn Hazm seems to go further than Ibn Tumart would, in allowing a departure from zdhir, clear, external meaning, when sense-perception and experience necessitate a different interpretation. Averroes also adopted Ibn Hazm's stand on the inter- pretation of words in legal texts in accordance with their grammatical meaning (Fasl, 9), but he does not admit of Ibn Hazm's distinction haml al-lafza 'ald-l- haqTqat al-shar'Tya muqaddam 'ala hamlihi 'ald-l-.haqiqat al-lurawTya. But this is of lesser import than the conclusion Averroes draws from the 'arabTya: if this 257</page><page sequence="13">E. I. J. ROSENTHAL- is the practice of the faqih how much more is the failasuf, who possesses knowledge by proof, entitled to interpret in conformity with Arabic usage. For the faqih works only with qiyds zann7, whereas the 'drif works with qiyds yaqTni (Fasl, 9, 5-7). This juxtaposition of syllogism based on (subjective) opinion, and syllogism of certainty, i.e. demonstrative proof, sums up tersely the difference between the failasuf, who as 'arif has certain knowledge, and the mutakallim, who lacks certainty. Averroes has support for his unconditional rejection of ta'wll and of dogmatic speculation as practised by the Ash'arites in Ibn Hazm who likewise only recognizedfiqh and rejected kaldm. Averroes, as we know from lists of his works, participated actively in 'ilm al-fiqh. As a philosopher, following in the tradition of Plato and Aristotle, he attached great importance to jurisprudence whilst criticizing its practitioners for their worldly interests (Fasl, 7, 10 ff.). His principal opposition is, however, directed against the dialectic theologians, and this for two main reasons, as stated before: the inadequacy of their method and the consequent absence of certainty and unanimity as well as their divulging of false notions to the masses ignorant of the proper method of study and therefore without discernment. Both combined result-to repeat-in confusion, heresy, and schism. In this sense he identifies them with the Sophists (Mandhij, 76). He does not hesitate to appeal to the imam, the Almohad caliph, to suppress this grave danger to the purity of Islam and the security of the State. For notwithstanding his deep interest in philosophical speculation-of which more will be said when his attitude to Plato and Aristotle is being examined- he was principally concerned with the inner meaning of the Shart'a, in particular its teaching of God and Existing Things. This will be clear from our next point. 3. The Supremacy of the Sharn'a and the Place of Prophecy in the Philosophy of Averroes.-The identity of purpose between philosophy and Shari'a has already been discussed. The superiority of the latter over even the general law without which no nation can live or formulate particular laws suited to its society, consists in that it is the expression of the will of God. It is for this reason that the Highest Good of man, his end as a rational being, is therein contained. It is superior to what man can devise. The philosopher aims at knowledge identical with that which God demands in the SharV'a. To know God's will is possible only through prophecy, as we learnt earlier on from Averroes' own words. Prophecy is the source of the Shart'a; it consists-to anticipate a fuller examination presently-of the revelation which legitimizes the prophet: the Qur'an. If we want to understand Averroes' view that it is only possible for the religious philosopher to gain that knowledge we must remember that for him as an orthodox Muslim Muhammad was the seal of the prophets. Therefore prophecy is extinct and-with striking similarity to the Jewish idea that the wise, i.e. wise in the Torah, are the heirs and successors of the prophets-the philosopher in Islam is heir to the prophet in knowledge of God. It is significant that Averroes stresses this point at great length in the Fasl, expounding the nature of the three classes of men corresponding to the 258</page><page sequence="14">THE PLACE OF POLITICS IN THE PHILOSOPHY OF IBN RUSHD three kinds of arguments, and polemizing against the mutakallimin and in particular against al-Ghazali. He even invokes the highest Muslim authority, the imam, to guard and protect the faldsifa and their writings-in which they interpret with their superior method of demonstration what requires interpreta- tion in the Shari'a, namely, abstract knowledge-and, moreover, to see that these writings do not fall into the hands of the two other classes. If we are justified in reading this statement in conjunction with Averroes' characterization of the founders of the Almoravid and Almohad dynasties, particularly the latter, who were animated by the desire to restore the rule of the Shari'a, it follows that the Ideal State is that built upon the Shari'a and the Ideal Ruler is the imdm who, as amir al-mu'min7n, is charged with implementing the Shari'a and guaranteeing its strict observance by the ideal society, the Muslim jamd'a. That this concept was not confined to the realm of the ideal is evident from two facts reported in our sources of this period. Ibn Tumart wrote a treatise on the Imamate--fT imdma-which Averroes may have known, and Abu Ya'quib Yiusuf ordered his 'ulamd to collect all traditions concerning jihad and combined them into a K. al-jihdd for practical guidance in his wars against the Christians and the Almoravid resisters. The SharV'a as divine law has much in common with the general law which is man-made. This will engage our attention in the final section. The ' political' character of law needs no stressing. The Shara'a is the law of the Muslim State and aims at the happiness of all its citizens, the elect philosophers as well as the masses. Its perfection and superiority over man-made laws consist in its divine character. Divine means revealed by Allah through Muhammad, his messenger. This is unequivocally Averroes' view notwithstanding his doubt whether the Ideal Ruler-who combines in his person the qualities and functions of philosopher-king-lawgiver and imim in one-should also be a prophet. In this doubt he may have been influenced by the laws of the SharT'a about the khildfa, and he may have left the question an open one for the reason that prophecy was certainly not one of the requirements in the khalifa, the vice-gerent of the prophet Muhammad. On the other hand, the faldsifa had no difficulty in harmonizing accomplishment in the theoretical sciences, demanded of the philosopher-king, with the 'ilm required of the caliph. This 'ilm meant ability to make independent decisions (of fiqh) and pass judgments on points of law (ijtihdd). For the SharV'a teaches true beliefs and convictions and-as we have seen from Averroes' claim for the philosopher to be the only qualified and authorized interpreter of the Shari'a-'ilm certainly covers knowledge of God, the angels and all Existing Things. In other words it is identical with the knowledge that the metaphysicist strives to attain. The Ideal Muslim State is founded on the Shari'a, i.e. prophetically revealed law. It is of crucial importance to realize that Averroes is interested in prophecy exclusively under the aspect of the Shari'a and, consequently, offers an explana- tion of prophecy which hardly, if at all, differs from the traditional orthodox definition. For him, the prophet is the Lawgiver, sent by Allah. He is at pains VOL. XV. PART 2. 21 259</page><page sequence="15">E. I. J. ROSENTHAL- in his Manahij to show that the working of miracles is no proof of prophetic status by itself, but only an additional and-for him-unimportant con- firmation. He says that miracles cannot be proved bi-l-shar', through the religious law, nor bi-l-'aql, by reason (93, in Mueller's edition). This view is directed against the mutakallimin who maintain that a prophet can be recognized by the miracles he performs. Averroes' intention is to free prophecy from miracles. But, he says, one must believe that he who performs them is virtuous and does not lie-as Plato's philosopher-rulers do ! As a Muslim Averroes cannot deny that Muhammad performed miracles, and it is for this reason that he admits them as a secondary confirmation of prophecy, valid only in conjunction with and in addition to the sole relevant criterion: the Qur'an, al-kitdb al-'aziz, by which Muhammad called upon the people to obey the will of Allah. This alone is the true legitimation of prophecy. The Qur'an is the miracle that confirms the nubuwwa, the prophetic character, of Muhammad. It is through the Qur'an that we know prophets exist. These prophets lay down laws (shard'i')-not nawdmis like Plato's votLo0eTrS--by dint of a revelation (wahy) from God for man to whom they announce knowledge ('ilm) and good actions (al-af'al al-jdmila). These laws enable man to reach perfect happiness and forbid him vicious religious con- victions (i'tiqdddt fdsida) and bad actions. This is the act of prophets (Mandhij, 98). Averroes is most insistent on the legislative function of the prophet by means of divine revelation. Not the dividing of the sea during the Exodus from Egypt but the giving of the Law from Sinai made Moses a prophet (99). The political character of prophecy is inherent in Islam, but brought into relief through the Greek concept of vod/os. Apart from the Qur'an in the case of Muhammad and the Torah in that of Moses it is the authentic witness of successive, uninterrupted tradition (naql tawdtur) which proves the existence of prophets; just as naql attests to the existence of philosophy and the philosophers (100). (We note that in the latter case it is naql without tawdtur which seems to be reserved for Islam.) Averroes further insists that the Shari'a contains both theoretical and practical laws-as has been stated before. Only he has the necessary knowledge to lay down these laws to whom was vouchsafed through revelation knowledge of God, happiness, and the good deeds that lead to it. He alone knows the obstacles that prevent man from attaining happiness. Averroes, the disciple of Plato and Aristotle, knows that many things contained in the Shari'a are also to be found in human laws. But, he avers (101), it is revelation which enables us to understand them, or at least most of them. Yet, there seems to be a certain weakening of his rigidly orthodox position expressed in his qualifying statement that their understanding is best obtained through revelation. One might be of the opinion that in dealing with Islamic doctrine Averroes could not very well be anything but traditional. The more significant is there- 260</page><page sequence="16">THE PLACE OF POLITICS IN THE PHILOSOPHY OF IBN RUSHD fore the fact that Averroes should give the same definition of prophecy and prophets and make the same assertion about the SharV'a in an admittedly philosophical treatise, written in defence of the faldsifa against al-Ghazali's attack upon them. For we find in the Tahdfut al-tahdfut that the prophet lays down 'religious laws which conform to the truth and impart a knowledge of those actions by which the happiness of the whole of creation is guaranteed ' (ed. Bouyges, p. 516). The SharV'a, he says towards the end of this treatise, leads to the happiness appropriate to each individual. It is necessary for the ethical virtues, the speculative virtues, and the practical arts. For without the last-named man cannot live in this world, nor can he live in this world and the world-to-come without the speculative virtues. But it is the ethical virtues without which he cannot attain the two others to perfection. It is relevant to interpose here that the aim of the SharT'a is identical with that of Political Science as defined by Aristotle in the Nicomachean Ethics and repeated by Alfarabi in his K. tahs7l al-sa'dda and by Averroes in his Com- mentary on Plato's Republic. Exactly as in the Manthij Averroes makes the ethical virtues in man depen- dent on previous knowledge of God and how to honour Him-which only the Shari'a teaches. Averroes asks there the question how the prophetic lawgiver can know to what extent the individual is capable of reaching happiness and by which method he procures it. In his answer he makes an important distinction- which is fundamental for his outlook as a religious philosopher-between the knowledge of the prophetic lawgiver and that of the speculative philosopher. The former possesses knowledge which is absolutely certain through devotion to the theoretical sciences, i.e. yaqTn as the result of demonstrative proof and in particular, through laying down religious laws and establishing regulations and making pronouncements about the circumstances of the Hereafter (Mandhij, 101). The latter has only the knowledge he gained from a study of the speculative sciences to guide him and consequently lacks the knowledge of wad' al-shara'i' on the basis of the Qur'an and, through that, the means to make the masses happy. In other words, the prophetic lawgiver must be a philosopher. Yet he not only states in the Tahdfut al-tahdfut that whilst the prophet is also a philosopher not every philosopher is a prophet-a stock-in- trade of the faldsifa and their opponents-but proceeds to clarify the difference between philosophy and SharT'a-notwithstanding the identity of their aim- thus : philosophy explains the happiness of some (elect) intellects and the study of philosophy marks man out as a human being. The religious laws, however, aim at instructing the masses (al-jumhtr '&amp;mtmatan) and leading them to happiness (582). A little later on he exhorts the philosophers to choose the best religion, which is naturally Islam, just as in his view it was Judaism in the time of Israel, and Christianity in the time of Rome. For him it is Muhammad who, with the Qur'an, has brought the final revelation to mankind. That Averroes should have defined prophecy and proclaimed the superiority of the Shar-'a in the Fasl al-maqdl and the Mandhij in the same way as in the Tahdfut al-tahdfut 261</page><page sequence="17">E. I. J. ROSENTHAL- and-at least as far as the Shar-'a is concerned-in the Commentary on the Republic proves beyond doubt, to my mind, that he was a sincere, orthodox Muslim. In any case, it is very strange that-as far as I am aware-Averroes nowhere expounds the theory of prophecy current among the faldsifa. Al-Ghazali attacks this theory in his Tahdfut al-faldsifa, but Averroes counters the charge merely by stating the orthodox Muslim conception, buttressed by arguments taken from political philosophy. His brilliant vindication of the SharV'a puts him in a class apart among the faldsifa. It is true that they have all recognized its excellence and paid tribute to its divine character. Averroes alone among them has endeavoured not only to defend it and establish its authority unchallenged and unchallengeable, but also to stress its political necessity as the only Law guaranteeing the happiness of all who acknowledge its authority and live by its regulations. In this he resembles Maimonides among the Jews. Both have the same attitude to the prophetic law. But Maimonides is a strong exponent of the psychological explanation of prophecy as first expounded by Alfarabi. This theory is, as is well known, inextricably bound up with the neo-platonic theory of emanation. It is interesting to observe that Gauthier bases his exemplary analysis of this psychological theory of prophecy on Maimonides' account in his Guide to the Perplexed. That Averroes should not even mention it is strange and I know of no other explanation than that he rejected it in favour of the orthodox one which he so forcefully expounded. This matter requires investigation. Gauthier is convinced that Averroes shared the view of thefaldsifa, especially in the formulation of Avicenna, by implication (130 if., 138, and especially 143 if.). He adduces Averroes' treatment of the prophetic intellect in the Tahdfut al-tahdfut (532 if.) as evidence for his view. But I cannot find any reference to the emanation of the Active Intellect in the way propounded by Alfarabi and after him by Avicenna and Maimonides; and I am convinced that Averroes rejected it. He did so not only because for him revelation (wahy) took the form of the kitdb al-'aziz and was supplemented by certain knowledge as a result of it, but perhaps also because of his deeper and purer understanding of Aristotle's Theory of Knowledge. For I am not aware of a treatment of the intellect other than that in his Commentaries on De Anima and Metaphysica. This exposition is, if I am right, entirely free from collusion with the Theory of Emanation. Moreover, in the passage of the Tahdfut al-tahMfut Averroes refutes a charge brought by al-Ghazali against the faldsifa, with Avicenna's argument, since it was Avicenna in the first place who was attacked. That does not necessarily mean that Averroes made Avicenna's view his own. His further statement (516) that the Active Intellect of the faldsifa is identical with the malak (Angel) of the Shari'a has, to my mind, no connexion with the Theory of Emanation. But I repeat: this problem needs further serious consideration. If it is as I believe it to be we would have in Averroes' rejection of the Theory of Emanation by ignoring it the clearest indication of the orthodoxy of his position in respect of Prophecy and its most important result: the Shari'a as the Ideal Constitution 262</page><page sequence="18">THE PLACE OF POLITICS IN THE PHILOSOPHY OF IBN RUSHD of the Ideal State. But the problem is as complex as the human mind itself. Revelation occupies the first and dominant place. Yet this does not mean that Averroes assigns to the intellect an inferior position. For he demands of the prophetic lawgiver knowledge of all Existing Things, without which perfect knowledge of God is not possible. If there is here a contradiction it is-at least for Averroes-more apparent than real. For him the Qur'an, that miracle of Revelation, does not only prove the nubuwwa of the lawgiver, it also demands speculation about God, the angels and all Existing Things by means of demonstrative proof. Whilst Averroes-to my mind-differs from Alfarabi and Avicenna in his concept of prophecy, he shares Avicenna's view that prophecy and Sharz'a are necessary for the survival of mankind. But how can we explain Averroes' doubt as to whether the philosopher-king-lawgiver-imam should also be a prophet ? ' As for the stipulation that he be a prophet there is room for thorough investigation. We will inquire into it in the first part of this science, in sha'a-llah. But perhaps if this were so it would be [stipulated] on grounds of perfection [or: of the highest good] and not out of necessity.' (II. i, 7.) One possible explanation might be that he envisaged a secular State, i.e. a State based on a law which was not the result of prophetic revelation. But why then should he insist on the qualification of imam ? Therefore, it seems to me more likely to look for the reason for his hesitancy in Averroes' orthodoxy. The SharV'a, the direct result of Muhammad's prophetic mission, was already in existence. Therefore no new prophet was possible nor necessary. But, we notice at once, no new lawgiver would be required either. If he simply followed Alfarabi in this whole chapter why did he take exception to the prophetic qualification only ? Was it because he did not agree with the current theory of prophecy ? Or had he simply not yet come to a definite conclusion at the time of the composition of the Commentary ? This would perhaps also explain why Averroes did not redeem his promise in his Commentary on the Nicomachean Ethics, if we are justified in placing its date very near that of the Commentary on the Republic. May not the answer be found in the two treatises in which the SharV'a as the prophetic law is so vigorously championed, in the Fasl and the Manthij ? It could possibly be assumed that the Fasl al-maqal and the Mandhij are of the realm of' Political Science, Part I: Theory ', since they are concerned with the SharV'a and its object of leading man to perfect happiness. Now this is exactly the objective of Plato's Royal Art, Aristotle's Master Art, the science of Politics which is concerned with the Highest Good and to it the Nicomachean Ethics is devoted on which Averroes wrote a Commentary as well, referred to frequently in the Commentary on the Republic. Just as this Commentary is Averroes' own contribution to 'Political Science, Part II: Practice ', so is his treatment of the prophetic lawgiver and the Shari'a-in addition to the justification of falsafa by this Shari'a-the Islamic counterpart to his Commentary on the Nicomachean Ethics. This is only a suggestion and further research is necessary, hampered unfortunately by the absence of the Arabic originals of both his 263</page><page sequence="19">E. I. J. ROSENTHAL- Commentaries on the Republic and on the Nicomachean Ethics, of some of his religious-philosophical treatises, and of his legal writings in particular if we bear in mind that Jurisprudence is part of Political Science. III. POLITICAL REALISM Although Averroes considered the Islamic State based on the SharV'a the most excellent State imaginable he was equally emphatic that of the States not based on revealed prophetic law Plato's Ideal Republic was the best and its coming into being as Plato described it. This is clear from his own words: 'It is right that you should know that the manner which Plato described is the best of its coming into being. But it is also possible for it to come into being in a different manner, yet after a long time. This is when there will over a long time be a succession of excellent kings over these states and they will not cease to influence these states gradually until in the end of time matters will come to the best government. Their influence will work in two ways at once, i.e. by their activities and works and by their convictions. This will be easy or not easy according to the laws in existence at a given time, and to their being near to this state or far [from it]. In general, their influence towards excellent deeds is more likely than towards good convictions in this time.' (II. xvii, 3.) This is obviously the description of a secular State and may perhaps be connected with the hesitancy about the prophetic qualification, notwithstanding the possible objections I have raised myself earlier on. Prophecy in a secular State is not necessary, but would make for perfection. If Averroes posed this question merely as a Muslim, he could certainly not admit that prophets would appear after Muhammad had been the last and most perfect of all prophets. But as a realist investigating the question of the origin and nature of the State, he recognized the existence of the secular State. The study of Plato's Republic and no less of contemporary States though theoretically under the Shari'a, taught him this. As a Muslim, and no less as a disciple of Plato, he insisted on a State-law which, however, varies with the kings who rule the State. To recognize the mutual influence between rulers and laws is in itself a sign of political realism. It has already been remarked that he also recognized the close affinity between the divinely revealed law of Islam and the general law promulgated by the lawgiver of the secular State. All stages from complete identity to contrast are noted in various passages of the Commentary; e.g. when speaking of corrective punishment in the Ideal as well as the imperfect States he says: 'The same is the case with laws which follow [the pattern of] the human laws in this our divine law, for the ways which lead in it to God are two : the one of them by persuasion and the other by war.' (I. vii, 11.) Or when dealing with the objection that the coming into being of the Platonic State was impossible because nobody would be in possession of all the qualities required of the ruler he says : ' The answer is that it is possible for men to grow up with these natural qualities . . .and to develop together with this by choosing the general law, the adoption of which none of the nations can escape. In addition, 264</page><page sequence="20">THE PLACE OF POLITICS IN THE PHILOSOPHY OF IBN RUSHD their own particular (religious) law should not be far from the human laws. Philosophy should already be perfected in their time. This is like the situation that prevails in this our time and in our religious law. If it so happens that such like men are rulers ... then it is possible that this state exists.' (II. iii, 1-2.) Without the Arabic original it is impossible to ascertain the exact meaning of the terms nTmius and torah here. Normally nTmus renders ndmus and torah renders shar' or sharV'a. But it is strange to find the combination torot anushiy6t, unless' human' here means truly human because divinely revealed. The distinc- tion between general and particular laws is derived from Aristotle, who in his discussion of Justice distinguishes between natural, legal and conventional law (Nic. E. V, 7, 1134b). Finally, in I. xxix, 3, Averroes discusses the rules of war and says: 'But what Plato thinks is at variance with what many lawgivers think.' He uses the term torot, religious laws, which corresponds to shard'i'. In all such passages a definitive interpretation is very difficult owing to the uncertainty of Averroes' terminology. But two observations are beyond doubt. In the first place, we note the close connexion between SharT'a and voY'os--their precise relationship will be the subject of the final section-and philosophy and secondly, the resulting connexion between law and politics, as understood by Plato and Aristotle. Averroes' political awareness and realistic approach have already been noticed in previous sections and it remains now to assess their significance in the context of Political Thought in Islam in general. There can be no doubt that his study of Plato's Republic and of Aristotle's Nicomachean Ethics has sharpened his own political sense, trained through experience as judge and citizen. To hold office was, moreover, a family tradition with the Banu Rushd. If we are justified in seeing in the passage about the origin of the State a recognition of the secular State in conjunction with his positive attitude to Plato's Ideal State and its deviations, which he took so seriously that he applied their characteristics to the contemporary scene, we will have to look upon Averroes as a forerunner of Ibn Khaldun. His attitude to law, just touched upon, is another pointer in this direction. And yet, he has not advanced on the road to the Power-State, described with so much insight by Ibn Khaldun, as far as Ibn al-Tiqtaqa. His preoccupation with law and justice-without over- looking the speculative element of intellectual perfection-goes hand in hand with a strong historical-political sense. This is brought into play in his defence of Plato against Galen's strictures, when Averroes draws a line between the city- state of Plato and the oIKove?'vr] of Galen; or when he recognizes the laws regulating prayer and sacrifices and enjoining humility as integral parts of the general law of the State, though they vary with every nation, religion, time, and place, just as other laws and injunctions vary. But before all his statement- in connexion with regulations governing prayer and other religious observances and, in particular, the teaching about God, the angels, and the prophets-that 'al-shard'i' hTya al-sand'i' al-daruirya al-madanTya ' (Tahdfut al-tahdfut, 581) shows great political insight and reminds one forcibly of Ibn Khaldun's attitude 265</page><page sequence="21">E. I. J. ROSENTHAL- to religion, as I have shown elsewhere. To refer to religious laws as 'necessary political institutions ' is of course quite compatible with the Muslim position and the all-embracing character of the Shari'a, but it seems to me that the use of the term madanzya points to the recognition of the political sphere as on a par with other spheres of the life of the State which are all held together by the Shar7'a, but have a significance of their own. His views on the place of women in the State-discussed before-fall in this category, and his resulting awareness of the political importance of Economics have their origin in the Republic, it is true. But by applying them to his own environment and by enlarging on them Averroes has developed them further and clearly foreshadows Ibn Khaldun. His keen interest in education and his realization of its political importance are further proof of this realism. His condemnation of Arab poetry springs as much from his recognition of its political harmfulness as from his orthodoxy. His insistence on the philosopher's fulfilment of the civic duties is another case in point. Tentatively I would add a further indication of a significant development of a Platonic idea in the direction of Ibn Khaldun's concept of the 'asabTya. Averroes uses the term, rendered into Hebrew by qibbus (association, community) often in the meaning of Plato's crvvra6vs (r'ov apXovTro). In these passages (e.g. I. xxvii, 2; III. iv, 7, etc.) it seems to emphasize the corporate life of the State, almost a social-political force: the group; especially when it is used in union with shittif, Plato's Kowwv'a, a community organized on the principle of fellowship. If this interpretation is correct, we have in this term-specific to Averroes-a clear indication of his political interest and of his advance towards Ibn Khaldun with his concept of the State as an independent entity with laws and tendencies of its own, and of the group as a political factor. Whether Ibn Khaldun was influenced by Averroes is a matter for investigation. He certainly polemizes against the political views of thefaldsifa. But this is not the place for such an inquiry and I must reserve it for another occasion. At any rate, Averroes started from Plato (Rep. 462d), and we now examine in summary fashion his attitude to his source and to Aristotle. IV. AVERROES, PLATO, AND ARISTOTLE Far from looking upon Plato's Republic merely as a substitute for Aristotle's Politics, which was inaccessible to him, Averroes used the Republic as a guide to the understanding of the State as such and, in particular, of contemporary Muslim States. To comment on it-as I tried to show in the first section of this article-was a necessary, self-imposed task of the philosopher who could not live in the Ideal State, but had at least to offer a considered judgment on his own State. By so doing he may have hoped to influence affairs by contrasting the existing, imperfect, with the Ideal State. His method of commenting upon what was most likely Galen's Summary of the Republic in Hunain b. Ishaq's translation is dealt with in the Introduction to the edition and translation of the Hebrew version. Suffice it to stress that Averroes comments only on Plato's 266</page><page sequence="22">THE PLACE OF POLITICS IN THE PHILOSOPHY OF IBN RUSHD theoretical statements. This follows from his insistence on the use of demonstra- tive arguments only in philosophy. He therefore leaves out of account Books I and X, notably the myth of Er, but offers a very substantial commentary on Books II-IX, often preceded by or interspersed with theoretical digressions. Throughout his Commentary he illustrates the Muslim's genius for absorbing, adapting, and entirely transforming ideas and institutions from another culture or civilization. Although Averroes was the Commentator par excellence and felt inclined to assume the role of political critic, there must be a deeper, more compelling reason still for the way in which he commented on the Republic which differs so greatly from some of his other Commentaries and shows-in parts-such striking resemblance to his 'dogmatic' polemical writings. This reason is to be found in what I have called elsewhere the 'common ground' between Plato and Aristotle on the one hand and the faldsifa, especially Alfarabi, Avicenna, and Averroes, on the other. It is the dual aspect of the central problem of Islamic philosophy: the political character of prophecy and the affinity between Shari'a and vor'os which manifests itself in the concept of the prophetic lawgiver. This affinity will be discussed in the final summing up, but it is to be borne in mind in the present context and in the next section-Averroes' relationship to Alfarabi. Averroes treated the Republic very seriously and attached great importance to its leading ideas no less than to Plato's practical advice in matters of the education of philosophers and guardians, of the participation of women on an equal basis in all offices of state and civic duties generally, and of the principle of one occupation for one person. He entirely agrees with Plato's definition of the four cardinal virtues-supplemented by Aristotle's discussion in the Nicomachean Ethics-and the method of developing and perfecting them. In all this he shows a keen analytical mind by testing Plato's ideas on the political reality, not to speak of his conscious application to his own times, as we have seen before. But he applies another test as well, namely the opinion of Aristotle to which he accords greater authority if Aristotle differs from Plato. Yet he sides with Plato against Galen, an example of which has been given before. This submis- sion of Plato's thought to the judgment of Aristotle finds its explanation, in the first place, in Averroes' own systematic mind, trained in the method of Aristotle's logical writings and attaching-as repeatedly mentioned-the greatest impor- tance to theoretical statements. It must be emphasized, however, that substantial agreement exists between Aristotle and Plato on moral and political questions. Aristotle is adduced as corroborating evidence as a rule, very rarely as overriding authority, and couched in such phraseology as: 'If this is not the opinion of Plato, it is, however, the opinion of Aristotle, and is undoubtedly the truth'. (I. xxii, 3 end.) Another instance is his criticism of Plato's opinion of the order of transformation of States from one to another in his comment on Nic. E. VIII, 10, 1160b, which-it is interesting to note-is not made in the 267</page><page sequence="23">E. I. J. ROSENTHAL- Commentary on the Republic, and I quote it in the Latin translation : ' Et istud est, quod narravit Arist. et est diversum viae vel semitae Platonis, qui videt quod principatus regni primo permutatur ad principatum honoris, et principatus honoris ad principatum divitiarum et principatus divitiarum ad principatum congregationum et principatus congregationis ad principatum tyrannidis. Et verisimile est quoniam quando perscrutatio exquaesita fit de hoc, patet quod res est, quae currit cursu naturae in compermutatione istorum principatuum est, ut dixit Arist. non ut dicit Plato.' (Ed. Venice, 1550,f. 59b. r.) Aristotle holds that monarchy is perverted to tyranny and timocracy to democracy. Aristotle's systematic treatment of the theoretical sciences, together with his logical categories, lifted many a Platonic argument out of the realm of persuasion or dialectic on to the plane of demonstrative proof. The Analytica Posteriora and Physica are largely responsible for that. As a result, Averroes often presents Plato's ideas in the modification. Aristotle gave them. This has naturally an important bearing on the correct understanding of Averroes' text. Ibn Rushd is fully aware of the limitations which the mental climate of his time imposed on Plato, as can be seen from his recognition that the education of the philosophers could not have begun with logic in Plato's time (since it only became a philo- sophical discipline with Aristotle's o?pyavov). Similarly, Plato's cosmology and psychology are understood by Averroes in the systematic modification of the Physica and the De Anima, just as Plato's Ideas are understood in the modified form of Aristotle's treatment in his Metaphysica. In this context Ibn Bajja has served as an important link, for he treated of Spiritual Forms at great length-thanks to his study and understanding of Aristotle, which has greatly influenced Averroes. It would fall outside my province to examine whether or not Averroes' reference to Plato's view on Universalia and Intelligibilia represents Plato's original idea or rather Aristotle's modification of it. What strikes the reader of this Commentary is the effortless, natural com- bination of Aristotle's theoretical philosophy with Plato's political thought and ideal. But though Averroes be prepared to bow to Aristotle's superior judgment, he does so critically, as he says in the Fasl that it is our duty to examine carefully what our predecessors have written on a subject of theoretical philosophy, according to the requirements of demonstration and then concludes : famr kdna minha muwdfiqan lilhaqq qabalndhu minhum wasararnd bihi washakarnahum 'alayhi wamd kdna minhd ghayr muwdfiqin lilhaqq nabahna 'alayhi wahadirnd minhu wa'adarnMhum. (6.) Since the Nicomachean Ethics is for Averroes the theoretical basis for Plato's practical treatise it is not surprising to find Aristotle's fuller and more explicit distinction between leading and subordinate arts, though this distinction is already made by Plato, just as is the definition of Politics. That he adduces the Nicomachean Ethics in explanation of Plato's statements is a matter of course. It is particularly noticeable in economic affairs and in the realm of Law and 268</page><page sequence="24">THE PLACE OF POLITICS IN THE PHILOSOPHY OF IBN RUSHD Justice, though Averroes has also drawn on the Laws. Thus, Averroes adopts Aristotle's differentiation of Justice and Equity and the identity between political and legal equity, the distinction between natural and human law and also-as already mentioned-between a general, universal law and particular laws, suited to specific nations and varying with time and place. This blending of Platonic and Aristotelian thought and argument is a charac- teristic feature of the Commentary and thus of Averroes' political philosophy. It is no less interesting than his adaptation of typically Greek concepts to Islam and Muslim notions. It can be expected that much of this adaptation goes back to Averroes' Arabic source, though exactly how much cannot be ascertained since Hunain's translation of Galen's Summary must be presumed lost. Thus, HIunain may have changed Plato's 'gods' into 'angels' or 'demons' and made 'houses of prayer' out of 'temples'. But it is doubtful who replaced the Delphian Apollo by ' what the Most High commanded through prophecy ', Hunain, or perhaps rather Ibn Rushd. The latter is probably responsible for substituting Arab for Greek poetry, and Plato's 'lands' are certainly replaced by' trees ' (I. xxix) with reference to jihad by Averroes himself. But these and many more similar instances throughout the Commentary are of minor importance than 'the weightier matters of the Law '. It does not matter so greatly whether a Platonic idea was accepted in its Platonic form and connotation or in its Aristotelian modification and develop- ment, except under the strictly historical aspect. But it is important to state once more that Averroes' exposition of the Republic cannot be appreciated in many passages without our realizing that he studied and often understood Plato in the light of Aristotle's systematic philosophy. This is apparent in his comments on the Republic and, particularly, in his summaries of Plato's argument in the form of introductions of varying length. It is in these introduc- tions as well as in the digressions of a theoretical nature-notably the long excursus II. vii-xiii, intended as a theoretical basis for the discussion of the education of philosophers-that Averroes' skilful blending of the Republic with the Nicomachean Ethics with the help of De Anima, Physica and Metaphysica as well as of the Analytica Posteriora, brings out the essential unity of the two parts of Political Science. It is on that unity that Averroes' own political thought is based. A striking example is the beginning of the Commentary, especially from I. ii, 2 to the end of viii. Averroes summarizes here the detailed comment of Books II, 376-IV (end) in the form of an extended paraphrase of Platonic passages, which are explained with the help of Aristotle's definitions-e.g. Courage-and blended with Alfarabi. The latter is, however, not quoted but simply incorporated without acknowledgment, the usual procedure. Averroes adds his own observations and welds the various strands into a concise, clear, coherent whole. Almost without exception he follows Plato where practical politics is concerned. This can best be seen in his unreserved acceptance of the idea of law as the basis of the State. He did so as a traditionalist, Almohad Muslim, 269</page><page sequence="25">E. I. J. ROSENTHAL- who saw in the Shari'a the equivalent of Plato's Constitution of his Ideal Republic. The community of the faithful with the amir al-mu'minTn at the head is the Ideal Polity. But it is the study of Plato which has heightened the under- standing of thefaldsifa, chief among them Averroes, for the political significance of the divinely revealed, prophetic law. That Averroes, echoing Aristotle, criticized the Republic as incomplete-in the Epilogue of his Commentary on the Nicomachean Ethics-because Plato had dealt with two only of the three classes of the State, the guardians and the philosophers, does not, to my mind, invalidate the assertion that in his interpretation of the Shari'a of Islam he was a disciple of Plato, whose philosopher-king was the ideal imam of the Muslim State. This imdm was the khalifa of the prophet-lawgiver. Hence the equation-since Alfarabi-of philosopher-king with imdm and lawgiver-prophet, though, as we have seen, Averroes thought that the prophetic qualification was perhaps not necessary. V. AVERROES AND ALFiRABI It is in his capacity as qdli and faqih no less than as philosopher that Averroes studied and commented upon the Republic. Parallels adduced from the Laws make it almost certain that he knew this treatise as well. One passage in particular about first, second, and third laws (III. iv, 4) suggests autopsy, though it is naturally possible that he owed his knowledge of the Laws to Alfarabi's Summary (which I have so far been unable to consult in F. Gabrieli's edition as Plato Arabus III). He refers in our Commentary (I. i, 1) to other political writings of Plato. Again from parallels it appears that this included a knowledge of the Politikos. How much of these other treatises he knew direct or through Alfarabi must still be investigated. We know from Hunain b. Ishaq that Galen's Summaries of Plato's treatises included the Politikos (Bergstraesser, 50) and Ibn Abi 'Usaibi'a mentions it twice, first under Afldtun and then under .Hunain. Alfarabi gives a short description of the Politikos, without mentioning the title in his De Platonis Philosophia (ed. R. Walzer/Fr. Rosenthal as Plato Arabus II) V, 13. I am almost certain that Averroes used the Summaries of the Laws and Politikos that existed in Arabic. But I am not sure about the Philebos, though a number of passages in the Commentary would suggest that he knew it, or at least of it. It may, however, be due to his source of the Republic. The fact is that Alfarabi's writings exerted considerable influence upon Averroes, in ideas no less than in literary dependence. The explanatory notes on the text provide clear evidence of it in abundance, and I must content myself here with some general remarks, illustrated by a few examples. But an important reservation must be made first. With the possible exception of Al-Kindi, Abu Nasr Alfarabi seems to be the first Muslim philosopher to have introduced and adapted the philosophy of Plato and Aristotle. Most of the political part of his independent treatises is taken from Plato, chiefly from the Republic and the Laws and the Timaios. Many an idea and many a formulation 270</page><page sequence="26">THE PLACE OF POLITICS IN THE PHILOSOPHY OF IBN RUSHD to be met with in these treatises-Al-madina al-f.dila, K. al-siyasdt al-madaniya and K. tahsll al-sa'dda, to name only the three more important ones which are accessible, though not in satisfactory critical editions-is derived from Aristotle. We will do well, therefore, to pause before we credit Alfarabi with the transmission of what Averroes might very well have taken over direct. Yet there is unmistakable literary borrowing on a large scale, as I hope to have established in my notes. Besides, there can be no doubt that Alfarabi determined the thought of all subsequent faldsifa-and their Jewish followers-by his decisive combination of the neo-platonic theory of emanation with the phenomenon of prophecy in the Islamic sense-though not in the case of Averroes, as I have tried to show-and, as a result thereof-by his equation of prophet and philosopher, of philosopher and lawgiver and of lawgiver and imam. Plato's Laws and Aristotle's Nicomachean Ethics-both of which he commented on-with their stress on law led him to a consideration of the SharV'a in relation to the vO4tLOS and to a recognition of the essential similarity of outlook between the two. The superiority of revealed prophetic law was clear to him just as much as to his successors. But in contrast to Averroes, e.g. he concentrated on the qualifications necessary in the prophet-philosopher- lawgiver-king-imam, his intellectual perfection and happiness and on the theoretical part of Political Science. The practical implications for the State, its government, and the ordinary citizen which arise from the correspondence between Shari'a and votos hardly interested him. He was a metaphysicist in matters political and not a statesman. Whereas Averroes often follows Alfarabi word for word his interest is at least equally divided between the individual perfection and happiness of the rulers and the citizens, especially the former, and the actual political reality. The result is that he incorporates Alfarabi's treatment of the speculative sciences, of the arts, even of the various constitutions of Plato's Republic, in his own Commentary. His systematic mind and great practical experience combined made him summarize and compress a lengthy, often vague statement of Alfarabi's whose terminology he uses at the same time. (I am naturally not referring to Platonic terms which, in both authors, go back to the Arabic Summary of the Republic.) But he differentiates more and consequently his vocabulary is not only more concise, but also more varied and richer. In metaphysical and political questions-though not in matters logical- he has accepted much without criticism, giving it simply in his own name. Apart from a significant and unusually worded reference to Alfarabi's K. al-siydsat--'... and it will be transferred here from there' (I. x, 6)-and another reference, presumably to Alfarabi's Commentary on the Nicomachean Ethics, Averroes never quotes his great precursor. In an earlier study I have already stressed the great dependence of Averroes on Alfarabi. The same applies to Ibn Bajja and to Avicenna in respect of Alfarabi. Needless to add that Averroes was far from being a mere copyist. In using earlier faldsifa he trans- formed his source-material, imprinting upon it the clarity of his own mind and 271</page><page sequence="27">E. I. J. ROSENTHAL- the conciseness of his diction. Moreover, his superior knowledge and under- standing of Aristotle and his Commentators served as a check and made him use his predecessor's writings critically and judiciously. All the same, the eminence of Alfarabi stands out clearly and Averroes' own exposition constitutes a skilful and impressive blend of his Platonic original with Alfarabi's digest and Aristotle's modification of it, seen against the dominating position of the Shari'a. To this he added his own observations and comments based upon theoretical knowledge and practical political experience. In two respects Averroes differs from Alfarabi and both are typical of the man and of the commentator of a work forming part of Practical Philosophy. The one feature has been fully discussed earlier on: the application of Plato's analysis to the contemporary scene which is entirely absent from Alfarabi's treatises. It is this which lends Averroes' treatise colour and distinction. The man of affairs was able to infuse a topical interest into an otherwise purely academic discourse with the result that the Commentary-though deprived of the personal element of the Platonic Dialogue-is much more realistic. The performance of his public duties enabled him-to repeat-to gain valuable insight into the workings of government, administration and, not least, into the minds of those engaged in these duties. The philosopher's world is one of speculation and of action combined: Averroes practised this pronouncement of Aristotle's all his life, except for the short spell of enforced exile. The second element is no less interesting: it concerns Averroes' political terminology. There can be no doubt that thefaldsifa as a group adapted Greek ideas-or what they understood to be such-to Islamic concepts and conditions. In this, Alfarabi led the way and coined the terms, except those which go back to the translators from the Greek either direct or through the medium of Syriac. If I am right in my interpretation, Alfarabi uses two sets of political terms. The one set is Platonic and presumably goes back to Hunain's text. The other is Islamic, in fact Quranic. (This is fully discussed in my notes to II. xvii, 6; III. iii, 1; x, 2, and particularly xviii, 8, and cannot be reproduced here.) On the whole Averroes keeps to the Platonic terms since he comments on Plato's text, except in the case of madina jahilTya and madina imdmiya. The latter term is borrowed from Ibn Bajja, as I have shown elsewhere. The ' State of error ', madina dalla, is in a category apart, since the word stands in Plato not as a technical term for a constitution, but rather as a characterization of the four other-imperfect-States. Thus it is used by Averroes. Yet, in Alfarabi it has the theological connotation it has in the Qur'an. Another term used by Averroes in connexion with Plato's four or five imperfect States is basita, 'simple', which is used by Ibn Bajja from whom Averroes, no doubt, borrowed it. It is another instance of the importance of Ibn Bajja for Averroes' political thought as a link between him and Alfarabi. In spite of his considerable literary dependence upon Alfarabi Averroes stands out clearly by contrast. For if we compare the two outstanding intellects we find that Averroes is preoccupied with the SharT'a in its theoretical 272</page><page sequence="28">THE PLACE OF POLITICS IN THE PHILOSOPHY OF IBN RUSHD and practical parts; for it teaches-as he says-abstract knowledge and moral actions alike. This-in any case in this form-is wholly absent from Alfarabi. The explanation may be found in what I called before the exclusively theoretical interest of the philosopher Alfarabi as against the eminently practical concern of the philosopher-judge-political scientist-critic Averroes. It is, however, possible that we have to modify our view on Alfarabi once we know his Summary of the Laws. Nor do we know how he commented on the Nicomachean Ethics. The place where we would expect to find a clear reference to the Shar;'a is where Alfarabi contrasts the true philosopher with the masses, and where he speaks of their knowledge and education (in the K. tahs4l al-sa'dda). He does so in a way clearly foreshadowing Averroes, as I state in my notes to the text. But it is curious that he should not mention the Shari'a in connexion with the Lawgiver-who is not called wddi'u-l-shara'i' as always in Averroes' Fasl and Mandhij, but wddi'u-l-nawdmis, corresponding to Plato's philosopher- lawgiver, vooo0Er'rs. This is the more striking since the equation of the philosopher-lawgiver with the king (or first ruler) and imam, as well as that of philosopher and prophet, is Alfarabi's combination of neo-platonic and Islamic concepts. No doubt the problem of SharT'a versus falsafa was not as acute in Alfarabi's day as in Averroes' Spain or even in Avicenna's East, which might have something to do with this strange omission. VI. SHARI'A AND NoLos This completes our survey of the various elements which together make up Averroes' political thought. His work constitutes the consummation of Muslim philosophy. It contains elements of Alfarabi, Avicenna, and Ibn Bajja, but is much more than a restatement of their ideas, with corrections as the result of a deeper understanding of Aristotle. Lucidity, penetrating analysis, concise diction characterize the Commentator with a master's grasp of the essentials of any problem in any branch of philosophy dominated by Aristotle. The analysis of his political thought has shown that Averroes was possessed of qualities which distinguish him from his predecessors in this branch of philosophy as well. He surpasses Alfarabi, to whom he owes more than to any other of the faldsifa. He was anticipated by Ibn Bajja in introducing references to contemporary history in his tadbTr al-mutawahhid (40, 3 ff., 'this time ', 'this land ', 'in the way of life of the muluk al-tawd'if '), but only as illustrations. His critique is to be understood as an original contribution to Political Science and foreshadows the independent attitude of an Ibn Khaldun. He goes far beyond the other faldsifa in his awareness of the political character of the Shari'a, especially in seeing ordinances regulating religious observances as political institutions. But though he has considerably widened the realm of politics in agreement with his Greek models, it is still encompassed by the all-embracing religious law and not yet an independent realm subject to a law of its own as we find it with Ibn Khaldun. The beginnings are there, and they are important, as we have seen in the matter of the origin of the State not bound by an overriding religious 273</page><page sequence="29">E. I. J. ROSENTHAL- law. On balance, it seems that the Law of God and not the ' Reason of State' is the guiding principle of his political philosophy. Since it is this which singles him out among the faldsifa whose work he has not only epitomized but also completed and perfected, it is necessary to state once more in what the principal contribution consists which Muslim (and Jewish) philosophy has made to medieval thought and left as its permanent legacy to the West. Islam met Christianity in the Maghreb, whence its influence spread over the Mediterranean lands and its adjacent territories. This contribu- tion consists, according to Gauthier, of 'the agreement between philosophy and religion ', as evolved in Averroes' Fasl al-maqal. If we-in the light of my remarks earlier on-substitute for Gauthier's wording Averroes' own statement on the identity of aim and purpose between Shari'a and falsafa, we are in a position to understand Muslim philosophy correctly and at the same time to comprehend that it was from the beginning, and remained throughout its development from Al-Kindi to Averroes, religious philosophy. We can also understand why and how a philosopher who applies the canons of Aristotelian logic and adheres to Aristotle's metaphysics can at the same time be-and actually is-an 'orthodox' Muslim. For Muslim philosophy did not become what it is through the sudden onrush of alien ideas which were embedded in Greek and Hellenistic philosophy, once this had found a refuge in the East and was made available to Muslim theologians in Arabic translations. We usually think only of the challenge this philosophy threw out to established orthodoxy. In reality heterodox and heretical minds fastened on philosophical concepts to use them in their attack on orthodoxy (and, no doubt, discredited philosophy in that process). This challenge could have been met by refutation and need not have led to a basically Muslim type of 'philosophy'. That hikma, in the sense of falsafa, could arise and fully develop, producing a succession offaldsifa is, to my mind, due to the ' common ground' supplied by the central position of Law in both Islam and Plato-Aristotle. Law in Islam means divinely revealed, prophetic law. Though Law is for Plato not divine in this sense, it has also a connexion with the god from whom it ultimately originates, though not by means of a direct revelation. It aims at educating the citizens towards highest perfection- a following of the god. Since the ruler must obey and implement this law which the philosophers have established, his office is likened by Plato to a ministry of the gods. There is thus a definite religious element in Plato's concept of the Law. But the difference in religious thought between a Muslim and a Greek is the difference between Revelation and Myth. We should therefore not over-rate the influence which this religious element may have had on the faldsifa, for they were fully aware of the difference between nawdmns-man- made laws-and shar' or shar;'a-prophetic, divinely revealed law. Even if Averroes is doubtful whether the philosopher-king-]awgiver-imnm must also be a prophet, he is emphatic that the Ideal Law of the Ideal State can be no other than the Shar;'a of Allah through his prophet Muhammad. 274</page><page sequence="30">THE PLACE OF POLITICS IN THE PHILOSOPHY OF IBN RUSHD But where Muslim and Greek political thinkers agree is in this: there can be no State or responsible rule without Law. Law, in the view of Plato and Aristotle, is not only necessary to guarantee the necessities of life-and, indeed, life itself; its real-higher-purpose is to bind ruler and ruled alike, to enable man to reach his destiny as a rational human being. Towards the end of his Commentary (III. xxi, 4) Averroes once more remarks adversely on Plato's tales and makes the significant comment that many men who are guided by their religious laws attain the virtues demanded of man without these tales. If we recall his discussion of the SharV'a in the Fasl, we are at once reminded of his statement that there are texts which must be accepted in their external meaning by all three classes of men. One of these classes is constituted by the masses (jumhur or 'awdmm), who are only capable of under- standing persuasive (i.e. rhetorical and poetical) arguments. We must therefore ask what difference there is between Plato's persuasive arguments used for teaching the masses and Averroes' corresponding arguments. The answer is instructive in that it reveals the fundamental difference between SharV'a and voJ.os. In the first place, only the truth of revealed law is accessible to all three classes equally. Therefore these statements-about the existence of God, of the angels, about happiness in this world and the next, about reward and punish- ment in the next world, etc.-are not only true but also clear in themselves. In other words, they require no interpretation and they lead all believers to happiness and perfection. The masses of Plato's Ideal State, which is guided by philosophers who obey the law which they themselves have first to lay down-even be it with the help of God-cannot see the truth with the naked eye, as the Allegory of the Cave tells us. Divine revelation is replaced by a tale or fable. Fiction approximating to truth occupies in the vo'jos the place which the reality of wahy, revelation in the shape of the kitdb al-'azxz, occupies in the Shari'a. Plato allows his rulers to use lies, ruse, and subterfuge-a fact which cannot be explained away by the expedient that it is for the good of the masses and of the State. No such provision is made in the SharV'a since it would be incom- patible with its ethics, quite apart from the fact that it would be unworthy and unthinkable of Allah. We have seen Averroes' aversion against miracles as proof for prophecy which, significantly, stems from his apprehension that what is unprovable may be untrue. The analogy between the elect few and the masses in the Shari'a and in Plato's Republic is no mere accident. In both education plays a vital part. In Islam it serves the purpose of maintaining the SharT'a and guaranteeing its observance, thus leading the Muslim to Allah. In the Republic education is necessary to create and maintain the Ideal State in justice and to guarantee that philosophers and guardians will be born and properly brought up. In both States a departure from the Law leads to deviation. Under the SharV'a deviation leads to error, heresy, and schism. Under the vo'os deviation leads to a transformation of the Ideal Republic of philosopher-kings, through VOL. XV. PART 2. 22 275</page><page sequence="31">E. I. J. ROSENTHAL- a process of progressive deterioration, until right beliefs and convictions have been perverted into their direct opposite. Both agree that right beliefs and convictions alone promote justice and happiness, for the sake of which the State exists. If we allow for different, even opposite, views about what constitutes right beliefs and convictions-as different as prophetic revelation is from myth on the one hand and from sovereign human reason on the other-there still remains an essential similarity in conception and aim between the two. This, I submit, is the reason why the faldsifa, chief among them Averroes-exactly like Maimonides among the Jews-were attracted to Plato's (and Aristotle's) ideas about law and justice. Yet they were fully conscious of the fact which only Averroes has so clearly formulated-that the SharV'a alone guarantees the whole of mankind happiness-provided they are all Muslims-whereas the vo'tos of the philosopher makes provision for happiness based upon theoretical knowledge for the elect few only. The Shari'a is all-comprehensive in another way as well. It draws what we call 'Politics' into its orbit and treats political rights and duties, especially the latter, as religious duties, like prayer, fasting, and charity. For it does not recognize that there is a sphere divorced from religion, a secular realm from which God and His perfect Law are excluded. This political nature of Islam facilitated the reception of Platonic notions. In principle, Plato makes the same comprehensive claim for his law devised by philosophers. Yet striking as the similarities are, they must not blind us to the contrast between Shari'a and vo'pJos. For the Shari'a as the declared will of God is not only starting point and centre for the faldsifa; it postulates certain beliefs and convictions which determine their speculation, circumscribe it, and exclude from rational inter- pretation some of its fundamental pronouncements. It provides-and this is important-in these doctrines a bond that unites the elect few and the masses as muslimiun, as believers in Allah, to Whose Will-announced through Muhammad-they willingly submit. On the other hand, we have the vodcos, the imposing creation of the sovereign reason of free but fallible men, whose errors are excused by Averroes because they are striving to know the truth. The vo4/os recognizes the gulf that separates the elect from the masses as final: it can offer neither Faith nor Hope nor Charity to bridge it. SELECT BIBLIOGRAPHY A. SOURCES Hunain b.

POSTSCRIPT After the MS. had been accepted for publication in this Bulletin, Gabrieli's edition of Alfarabi's Compendium Legum Platonis, referred to above, p. 270, was published. I have since compared this text with the passages in Averroes' Commentary which, to my mind, betray an acquaintance with Plato's Laws. Although Averroes may have known Alfarabi's Paraphrase the absence from it of 697, on which I assume Averroes' threefold division of the laws in III. iv, 4 is based, and of 903c and, in particular of 961e, 962a, makes it practically a certainty that he knew the Laws in a much fuller version. Moreover, Alfarabi stops in Book IX. As I have shown in an Addendum to the introduction to my edition of Averroes' Commentary on Plato's Republic, there are other passages- apart from those just mentioned-which may have served as background to Averroes' comment, but are not contained in Alfarabi's Summary. On the other hand, passages which are found in Alfarabi as well-though only in part-may suggest a link with Plato. Yet, it is much more likely that both authors knew and used Galen's Summary of the Laws, each for his particular purpose. For Alfarabi see Gabrieli's Praefatio, Xf. and especially XIV with n. 19. Averroes' purpose has been stated in this article, and may be summed up as a critical interpretation of Plato whose views he applied to his own times and circumstances as a representative of practical philosophy. How much of this different attitude, approach, and purpose is due to Averroes' fuller under- standing of Aristotle and his commentators can as yet not be determined. A first examination of Alfarabi's Summary has so far not led to any modification of my views such as I envisaged on p. 273 above.</page></plain_text>
