<plain_text><page sequence="1">WITCH BOTTLES AND MAGICAL JUGS BY RALPH MERRIFIELD A COMMON counter-measure against witchcraft, which has survived as a rustic superstition until recent times, is the preparation by the supposed victim of a " witch-bottle ". The usual contents are a sample of the victim's urine, together with a few nails, pins, or thorns. Sometimes other ingredients, also intimately connected with the person of the victim, may be included-such as clippings of his hair or finger-nails. The bottle is securely corked or stoppered, and is then either concealed and left, or else heated until it explodes-with dire results to the witch who has cast the spell. In the former case, it is believed that the witch will suffer from a strangury, and will be doomed to a slow and painful death, unless the bottle is uncorked. In the latter more drastic method, the death of the witch and the subsequent relief of her victim are believed to take immediate effect, provided that the bottle actually bursts. If the cork merely flies out, the witch will escape. The urine, hair-clippings, etc., of bewitched cattle or horses, likewise may be enclosed in a bottle as a counter-measure against the witch responsible for their sufferings. According to one local legend, " Cunning " Murrell, the famous witch- finder of Hadleigh in Essex, met his death in this way as recently as 1860, through the agency of a witch-bottle containing the hair of a donkey which he had bewitched, in an unfortunate lapse from the " white " magic which he normally professed to practise.' An even more recent example of this belief may be quoted from an adjoining county. It is reported in a newspaper of 1903 that the customer of a barber's shop in Bishops Stortford asked that a clipping of hair from the nape of his neck should be saved, as he wanted to put it in a bottle with nail-parings, water, and other ingredients. He intended to put the bottle on his fire at night, so that it would burst as near midnight as possible, in order to bring sickness to an enemy who had injured him-no doubt by witch- craft, although this is not explicitly stated.2 The difficulty, not unaccompanied by danger, of bursting a bottle by heat, made the slower but less alarming method of using the witch-bottle considerably more popular, and from time to time, in many different 1 Harold Adshead, " Canewdon and its Witches ", in The Essex Countryside, vol. 2, No. 6, pp. 46-7. 2 Quoted from the " East London Advertiser " of August, 1903, in A.

Sometimes they still contain liquid-almost certainly urine-but usually this has evaporated. Bottles which ori- ginally contained urine alone are of course less easily recognized as witch charms, and must often have escaped notice.3 Finds of witch-bottles have been recorded from churchyards in Devon- shire4; from the grave of an animal (no doubt believed to be the victim of witchcraft) and from house foundations in Lincolnshire5 ; and beneath the floor of an old farm-house in northern Staffordshire.6 I will content myself with a more detailed description of two fairly typical finds of this kind, which have not, I believe, yet been published. A bottle of nineteenth century date, which apparently formerly contained a tooth-ache specific, was found in 1895 in St. Baruch's Well, Barry Island, Glamorganshire, and is now in the Welsh Folk Museum. It was corked, and contained three black enamel pins, all bent. The other is a late nineteenth century codliver oil bottle, still with its original label. It was found, about twenty years ago, in the kitchen chimney of an old house in Padstow, Cornwall, while repairs were being carried out. It is more than half filled with a dark liquid, and has a number of rusty pins actually stuck into the top of the cork, outside the bottle-a variant of the usual custom, which may be the result of the introduction of the witch-bottle tradition into an area already familiar with the common West Country practice of hanging in the chimney the heart of a bewitched animal, stuck full of pins, as a counter-measure against witchcraft. The liquid has been analysed, and found to be urine in a state of decomposition. At this point I must mention two witch-bottles of a much more unusual character. One of these was found near Padstow, during repairs to another old cottage. Several layers of old wall-paper were stripped revealing a small cupboard in a recess under the stairs. This contained nothing but a nineteenth century wine-bottle, corked and sealed, filled with liquid, and containing a mounted group of carefully carved wooden " Instruments of the Passion " in miniature, comprising a cross, two 3 That urine alone was sometimes used is suggested by the Cornish anecdote in Robert Hunt, Popular Romances of the West of England, London, 1923, p. 319. There is also little doubt that James Fowler is correct in identifying bottles found at South Kilworth and Lutterworth as eighteenth century witch-bottles contain- ing urine alone.

It seems likely that it was the work of a pious sailor, who was perhaps weary of making the usual " ship in a bottle ". It may therefore have been made simply as an ornament, or as a display of skill, but it certainly seems to have been used as a charm. Unfortunately, the nature of the liquid is unknown, but local people, evidently still familiar with the witch-bottle tradition, have told the present owner that it is likely to be urine. If so, this would appear to be an interesting late development of the charm, perhaps resulting from a mistaken interpretation of the traditional nails and thorns as symbols of the Passion of Christ. The other witch-bottle follows quite a different tradition. In this case a stoneware bottle was found just over twenty years ago beneath the feeding trough in a cow-house, on a farm at Sarn, Montgomeryshire. It contained merely a written charm, the general purport of which is clear, although I have not yet succeeded in deciphering the whole of the document. It is intended to give protection against witchcraft to the farmer, and to his " cows, calves, milk, butter, cattle of all ages, mares, suckers (foals), horses of all ages, sheep, ewes, lambs, sheep of all ages, pigs, sows", etc. It is written on an ordinary piece of note-paper, of a kind which was made in the latter part of the nineteenth and early twentieth century. An interesting feature is the survival for magical purposes in Nonconformist Wales of the formulae " Pater Noster " and " Ave Maria ", which occur towards the end of the charm. It is perhaps doubtful whether this example should be included in the present paper, as the bottle was simply the container of a much older type of written charm, and has little in common with the ordinary " witch-bottle ". The distribution of the custom in the nineteenth century was wide- spread, ranging from Cornwall to Essex, and from Sussex to the north of Lincolnshire. It quite certainly also extended much further north, for there is a record of the discovery of witch-bottles in the north of Scotland, but unfortunately the exact locality is not given.' This wide distribution in recent times might appear to suggest that the custom is of some antiquity, but in actual fact there is no evidence that it is more than about three hundred years old. There are a number of references to the practice in the latter part of the seventeenth century. John Aubrey, for example, in his Miscellanies, published in 1696, has the following account : " Mr. Sp. told me that his horse which was bewitched, would break 7 The discovery of witch-bottles in the north of Scotland is mentioned by E. D. Longman and S. Lock, Pins and Pincushions, 1911, pp. 37-8.</page><page sequence="4">198 Witch Bottles and Magical 9ugs bridles and strong halters, like a Sampson. They filled a bottle of the horses urine, stopped it with a cork, and bound it fast in, and then buried it under ground : and the party suspected to be the witch fell ill, that he could not make water, of which he died. When they took up the bottle, the urine was almost gone; so that they did believe that if the fellow could have lived a little longer, he had recovered."8 The practice of " putting Urin into a Bottle " to free people from witchcraft was denounced, together with other practices of " white " magic, as unlawful, by Increase Mather in 1684.9 The earliest published reference to the bottling of nails with urine seems to be that made by Joseph Blagrave of Reading, in his Astrological Practice of Physick, published in 1671, where it is described as one of a number of " experimental Rules, whereby to afflict the Witch, causing the evil to return back upon them ". An account of the preparation of a witch-bottle is given as follows : " Another way is to stop the urine of the Patient, close up in a bottle, and put into it three nails, pins, or needles, with a little white Salt, keeping the urine always warm : if you let it remain long in the bottle it will endanger the witches life: for I have found by experience that they will be grievously tormented making their water with great diffi- culty, if any at all, and the more if the Moon be in Scorpio in Square or Opposition to his Significator when its done." He goes on to explain why the witch can be tormented through the medium of the victim's urine. " The reason . . . is because there is part of the vital spirit of the Witch in it, for such is the subtlety of the Devil, that he will not suffer the Witch to infuse any poysonous matter into the body of man or beast, without some of the Witches blood mingled with it ..."10 In other words, the witch can best be attacked by means of the magical link of sympathy which she has established between herself and her victim. The earliest recorded instance of the use of a witch-bottle, however, seems to be an account given by William Brearley, once a Fellow of Christ's College, Cambridge, who died in 1667. It is quoted by Joseph Glanvill in his Sadducismus Triumphatus.ll Brearley was told the story by his landlord, while he was lodging in Suffolk, probably during the period after his ordination in 1635, and before his appointment as Rector 8 John Aubrey, Miscellanies, 4th edition (1857), p. 140o. 9 Increase Mather, An Essay for the Recording of Illustrious Providences, 1684, 269. 10 Joseph Blagrave, Astrological Practice of Physick, London, 1671, pp. 154-5. x1 Joseph Glanvill, Sadducismus Triumphatus, London, 1681, pp. 205-8.</page><page sequence="5">Witch Bottles and Magical fugs 199 of Clipstone in Northants in 1644. The events described had evidently happened a few years earlier, and may be tentatively attributed to the period 1620-40. The story concerns the curing of Brearley's landlady, who had been afflicted by witchcraft, and is worth quoting in full, as it is related in Sadducismus Triumphatus. " For an old Man that travelled up and down the Country, and had some acquaintance at that house, calling in and asking the Man of the house how he did and his Wife; He told him that himself was well, but his Wife had been a long time in a languishing condition, and that she was haunted with a thing in the shape of a Bird that would flurr near to her face, and that she could not enjoy her natural rest well. The old Man bid him and his Wife be of good courage. It was but a dead Spright, he said, and he would put him in a course to rid his Wife of this languishment and trouble. He therefore advised him to take a Bottle, and put his Wife's Urine into it, together with Pins and Needles and Nails, and Cork them up, and set the Bottle to the Fire, but be sure the Cork be fast in it, that it fly not out. The Man followed the Prescription and set the Bottle to the fire well corkt, which, when it had felt a while the heat of the Fire, began to move and joggle a little, but he for sureness took the Fire shovel and held it hard upon the Cork. And as he thought, he felt something one while on this side, another while on that, shove the Fire shovel off, which he quickly put on again, but at last at one shoving the Cork bounced out, and the Urine, Pins, Nails and Needles all flew up, and gave a report like a Pistol, and his Wife continued in the same trouble and languishment still. " Not long after, the Old Man came to the house again, and inquired of the Man of the house how his Wife did. Who answered, as ill as ever, if not worse. He asked him if he had followed his direction. Yes, says he, and told him the event as is abovesaid. Ha, quoth he, it seems it was too nimble for you. But now I will put you in a way that will make the business sure. Take your Wife's Urine as before, and cork it in a Bottle with Nails, Pins and Needles, and bury it in the Earth; and that will do the feat. The Man did accordingly. And his Wife began to mend sensibly, and in a competent time was finely well recovered. But there came a Woman from a town some miles off to their house, with a lamentable outcry, that they had killed her Husband.... But at last they understood by her that Husband was a Wizard and had bewitched this Man's Wife, and that this counter- practice prescribed by the Old Man, which saved the Man's Wife from languishment, was the death of that Wizard that had bewitched her. This story did Mr. Brearley hear from the Man and Woman's own mouth who were concerned, and at whose House he for a time Boarded, nor is there any doubt thereof." There seems to be the implication here that the woman was afflicted</page><page sequence="6">200 Witch Bottles and Magical 7ugs by means of an evil spirit sent by the wizard, and that this was somehow trapped in the bottle. The writer himself expresses some doubt as to whether the effectiveness of the witch-bottle is due entirely to sympath- etic magic, and is inclined to think that the problem is complicated by the witches' use of familiar spirits. Now there are several points of interest in Brearley's story, not the least of these being its location in Suffolk at a relatively early date. Moreover, it is clear that the people concerned knew nothing of the practice until they learned it from the old man who was travelling about in that part of the country. It was not one of their traditional folk- customs, but apparently something quite new to them. This story does in fact seem to be an actual record of the introduction of the custom into a Suffolk village in the second quarter of the seventeenth century, or a little earlier, and there is some reason to suppose that this event is not far removed in space or time from the invention of the witch-bottle, or at any rate its first appearance in the form which was to become familiar throughout the country. This idea is supported by the archaeological evidence. It has been possible to find fifteen records of witch-bottles that are definitely of seventeenth century date, and have a known provenance.'2 Six of these were found in London, and nine in various parts of the eastern counties, ranging from Essex in the south to Lincolnshire in the north, as is shown by the distribution map. All are stoneware vessels with bearded human masks, of the type usually known as " greybeards " or " bellarmines ". These jugs or bottles were imported in great quantities from the Lower Rhineland in the latter part of the sixteenth century and throughout the seventeenth, and fortunately can be approximately dated within this period by their shape and by the type of mask they bear. I have been able to trace five of the London examples, and five from East Anglia, and all of these are of late date, and were probably made in the second half of the seventeenth century. The earliest, a bellarmine found in an inverted position beneath the hearthstone of a cottage in Stradbroke, Suffolk, cannot be much earlier than the middle of the century, and some s12 A detailed account of ten of these is given in the writer's article " The Use of Bellarmines as Witch-Bottles ", published by the Library Committee of the Corporation of London in The Guildhall Miscellany, No. 3, PP. 3-14. To these must be added a bellarmine found recently in Pennington Street, Stepney: another found beneath the threshold of a house in Saffron Waldon, Essex (A. Clifton Kelway, Memorials of Old Essex, 19o8, p. 252) : another found under a hearth in Wennington, Hunts (Transactions of Cambs and Hunts Archaeological Society, vol. IV, pt, IV, p. 125) : two found together beneath a floor in Church Farm, Great Dunham, Norfolk: and another, containing pins and nails, buried under the threshold of a cottage at Litcham, near Dereham, Norfolk.</page><page sequence="7">l-;liii':'iiiiiiiiii liiiiiiii: iiiiiii .--i:ili;i liiiii~iiii :::i~iiii~! .....i--:-ii-:ii~c~i-:c~ iii -iii; ii:::iiiiii-iiii l-: iiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiill I ': :::::::::::?:-??:iii?-'z- li iiii~iiiii:,l:_ -il- '?i ftiiiiiiiiii~i~iiiii ii:i~ii i -iiiii~i~i~i~ i -i-i : i::i?i:iii~::: ::::::::::::::: : i~'~.~ 3iiiiiiiiiiii-iiii _,::::::: ;ii::iiiiiiiiiiiiii:-:::;:_ P~-:--:-i-i j'''.-~-'''''''idi S.iiiii iiiii .iiiiiiiiiini-iiiiiiii :''iZ8-iii .........~~i-i~ ............................ . iiil :sii:i,,ii::i:-iii ~ ii~iliiriiiiiil ......................... ::;::-:'i~ -~i -::: :-:::::::: :: -ii:::: :: :: - iii iicii ii~ iiiiiiiiiiiiisiii :ii-iiiiiiiiiii-~~ii i-- 4iiiiiiiiiiiiijriiii: -ii:i-:i::-::li i::i:::: ::::::-::.:::I-( ~liiiiii : ii~i-::, :-r:::: :i-ii~i~i?iiiii iiiili iiiiiiiiii i iii-iiiii -i~i -ii-i~ii~~iiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii-i~i-i:~ i :i iii~~~.i'~~~~.~ ~ ~ ~ . . ..-~ ?-:` iiiiiiiiiiiii-aiiii iiii ii~iiiiiiiiiiii~i,,,,, .................. iili !i?iiiiiiii!iiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii :ii:i::ii-i: ii:,: iiiiiiiiiiii iii !i i ;i-iiiiiiii-iiiiii? ;-iiaie-i ;;iiiiiii;.iii iiil ii~iiiiiZ" ?-::iiii:-iiiiiii--ii: ............- iiiiii~ l~Bi~ll~iii~ ~ iii: ii iiiiiisiiiiiiiiiiiii: i- i-iii:iiiiiii?iiii'iiii~i-i i-ii :iiiiiiiiii!:::: zt zt En -z z 0 - f'-4 z 0-4 HO X z C</page><page sequence="8">Witch Bottles and Magical 7ugs 201 of the others could probably be attributed fairly safely to its last quarter. It seems reasonable to suppose that the idea of putting nails and pins into these jugs for the purpose of counter-witchcraft, was partly inspired by their human masks. The magical significance of such a charm, by no means obvious in the case of a nineteenth century medicine or wine bottle, becomes much more evident when we see the original witch- bottles of the seventeenth century, with their malevolent bearded faces. These surely became magical symbols of the witch, and underlying the learned theories of such men as Blagrave, we may detect the re-emergence of the primitive idea of image magic. It is perhaps significant that in addition to such ingredients as nails or human hair, commonly found in later witch-bottles, at least two of the London bellarmines contained a recognizable representation of a human heart, carefully cut from a piece of cloth or felt, and pierced with bent pins. In the case of a bellarmine found beneath the threshold of the old " Plough Inn ", in King Street, King's Lynn, the only contents were a cloth " heart " stuck with pins. It seems likely that similar " hearts " were originally included in other examples which appeared to contain only rusty nails and a few pins, for in the state of extreme corrosion that is often found, the presence of decayed cloth cannot easily be detected. In the case of the latest witch- bellarmine that has been found-an interesting example excavated a few months ago in Pennington Street, Stepney-the contents were examined with great care by Mr. F. J. Collins of the Architect's Department of the L.C.C. Here he found all the contents which have been recognized and preserved in other bellarmines. None of the other examples now contains all these ingredients, but one wonders how often this incompleteness is due to the fact that the missing materials were unnoticed, and therefore were not preserved. The Stepney bellarmine contained nearly a score of rusty iron nails, some human hair, human nail-parings, some pieces of wire, and some pins, several of which were still stuck into a very much decayed piece of cloth, no longer recognizable as a heart, as almost certainly it had been originally. No obvious trace of urine survives in this or in any other seventeenth century witch-bottle. It is difficult to avoid the conclusion that these anthropomorphic jugs, with their human " hearts " stuck with pins, and containing other " Nails and Pins, and such instruments as carry a shew of Torture with them ", as a late seventeenth century writer describes the ingredients of a witch-bottle,'3 are in fact the prototype of our familiar charms of later 13 Cotton Mather, Late Memorable Providences, London, 1691, quoted by G. L. Kittredge, Witchcraft in Old and New England, Cambridge (Mass.), 1928, p. 102.</page><page sequence="9">202 Witch Bottles and Magical fugs times. I know of only two more recent instances retaining the heart- symbol, which probably lost its obvious significance when the bellar- mines passed out of use. One of these is of uncertain date-a record of a bottle found about a hundred years ago beneath a foundation of an old house in northern Lincolnshire, and containing the heart of a small animal, perhaps a hare, pierced with pins.14 It is unlikely that this charm was deposited later than the eighteenth century, and it is possible that it was of even earlier date. The other is a nineteenth century recipe against witchcraft from Devonshire, which directs that the liver of a frog stuck full of pins, and the heart of a toad stuck full of thorns, shall be placed in a bottle and buried in a churchyard path.'5 This, of course, may be an innovation rather than a survival-the result of the introduc- tion of the witch-bottle into a region where the heart pierced with pins was already familiar as a separate charm. On the other hand, it is perhaps significant that a small-necked stone jar is recommended. Is this a memory of the bellarmine tradition? In both of these examples, however, the heart of an actual animal is used, and the imitation cloth heart has as yet been found only in the seventeenth century bellarmines. If the " grey-beard " inspired the witch-bottle superstition, as we now know it, however, there is at present no evidence that it did so until it had been a familiar domestic vessel in eastern England for more than fifty years. The present indications are that the practice appeared quite suddenly somewhere in East Anglia, not long before the middle of the seventeenth century, and then spread rapidly through the country, helped considerably, not doubt, by the publication of such books as Blagrave's Astrological Practice of Physick in 1671, and Glanvill's Sadducismus Triumphatus in 1681. The evidence of the distribution map, indicating the eastern counties as the primary centre of origin of the witch-bottle, may be questioned on the grounds that all these vessels are bellarmines, and that these imported jugs are much more common in London and East Anglia than elsewhere in England. In other words, it may be suggested that the map indicates the distribution of bellarmines, rather than of seventeenth century witch- bottles. The answer to this is that at present I know of no other witch-bottles of any kind that are as early as these greybeard jugs, and can definitely be attributed to the seventeenth century. I have, how- ever, plotted on the map another small group of probable witch-bottles that are the next earliest known to me. These are small steeple-shaped 14 Notes and Queries, 2nd series, I (1856), p. 415. 16 S.

Two of these steeple phials, containing only a liquid, were found buried upside down in the rubble foundations of the church walls at Kilworth and Lutterworth in Leicestershire'l; and a third, now in the Cambridge 16 Proceedings of the Society of Antiquaries, 2nd series, vol.

I, pp. 133-4 and footnote.</page><page sequence="11">204 Witch Bottles and Magical fugs Folk Museum, was found in the church wall at Swaffham Bulbeck, in Cambridgeshire. An example from Whitstable is more doubtful, owing to the lack of definite information, but as it is said to have been found, like the others, containing liquid, and buried beneath an old wall, it seems likely that this is another example of the same variant of the witch-bottle custom.18s Four specimens do not of course make a dis- tribution pattern, but taken in conjunction with the bellarmines, which are probably of slightly earlier date, they give some confirmation to the idea that the superstition spread over the country from the eastern counties. The sudden appearance of the practice, just before the middle of the seventeenth century, in a region in close contact with the Continent, suggested the possibility of foreign influence, and accordingly enquiries were made among archaeologists, museum curators, and folklorists in the Netherlands and Western Germany. The " witch-bottle " of urine, nails, etc., seemed however to be completely unknown there. Neverthe- less, an old superstitious practice, found both in Holland and Germany, was brought to my attention, and it seems likely that this con- tributed something towards the development of our English witch-bottle tradition. The seventeenth century witch-bellarmines of East Anglia have mostly been found buried beneath the threshold or the hearth-stone of old buildings. The example from King's Lynn was found under a threshold, and an account of another, found at Saffron Waldon, implies that it also was buried under the entrance door of an old house. The bellarmines from Stradbroke, in Suffolk, and from Crowland, Lincolnshire, were both buried beneath the hearthstone. One of the two examples from Norwich was found beneath the partition wall of two late seventeenth century properties, and this again might well have been buried beneath a fire-place. The contemporary witch-bellarmines of London, on the other hand, seem to have been, for the most part, either thrown into water, or buried in open ground on the outskirts of the town. One example, containing nails and a felt heart pierced with pins, was found in the mud of the Thames at low water, near the steps at Paul's Pier Wharf ; and another, still with its original cork, and containing a cloth heart with pins, human hair and nail-parings, was found in the course of an old mill-stream, under the corner of Tufton Street and Great College Street, Westminster. 18 W. A. Thorpe, English Glass, 1949, p. 85, where these bottles are incorrectly attributed to the fifteenth century.</page><page sequence="12">Witch Bottles and Magical rugs 205 Another, containing pins and nails, was found in Rathbone Place, where it was probably either buried in open ground, or thrown into a ditch, for a seventeenth century field boundary ran along the line of the modern street. The recently discovered example from Stepney may either have been buried in a garden or orchard, or beneath one of the first cottages built in Pennington Street at the end of the seventeenth century.19 Now in the Low Countries and Germany, pots of various kinds are not infrequently found buried beneath the threshold or hearth of old houses, where they have obviously been deliberately buried in accordance with some superstitious practice. These are mostly simple jugs of Siegburg stoneware or of earthenware, but sometimes cooking-pots or other vessels have been found. At Culemborg, near Utrecht, they were buried under the new houses which were built after a great fire in 1422, perhaps as a safeguard against a similar disaster.20 Usually they appear to be empty, but sometimes they contain peat-ash, bones, or egg-shells. At Waalwijk, many years ago, a jug filled with oats was found beneath a threshold,21 and at Deventer, an earthenware tripod-pitcher containing egg-shells was found beneath a house of fifteenth or sixteenth century date.20 At M6ttlingen, in Germany, a pot was found buried with other charms behind the oven. It contained powder, coins, earth, and the bones of birds.22 Sometimes, like our English witch-bottles, these vessels were buried upside down. That the custom continued as recently as the seventeenth century in the Netherlands, is shown by two recent finds at Baardwijk23 and at Loon op Zand, where jugs of a kind represented in seventeenth century paintings were found buried near the threshold of old houses. The latter example is said to resemble closely a vessel shown in Vermeer's picture, "' The Milkmaid ". Generally no signs of a cover have been detected, but the jug from Loon op Zand had a small leather thong around its neck, and this had evidently been used to tie on a cover, probably of cloth, no traces of which remained.24 The problem of this custom was discussed many years ago by Ludwig 10 For a detailed account of the circumstances in which these bellarmines were deposited, see " The Use of Bellarmines as Witch-Bottles ", in The Guildhall Miscellany, No. 3, PP. 3-14. 20 Information given by J.

He quoted as a parallel the fourth canto of Ariosto's " Orlando Furioso ", in which a magic castle is destroyed when the pots buried beneath the door-step are broken. A somewhat different idea was suggested by A. G. de Bruyn, in discussing the discovery of a fifteenth or early sixteenth century Siegburg jug beneath the threshold of a house in Oldenzaal.26 He believed that the buried pots were intended to trap evil spirits, and that the traces of food which have sometimes been found were the remains of the bait used to lure them into the pots, rather than any kind of offering. In support of this idea, he quoted a tradition still surviving in Oldenzaal, that an evil spirit can be conjured into a box, which is then thrown into water, where the contents burn. Bronze tripod-pitchers have been found in the marshes of Drente, in northern Holland, and there is a legend that the exorcist used to banish the evil spirits of a bewitched house into a jug, and bring this with horse and cart to the marsh to sink it there.27 These two theories are not incompatible, for the transition could easily be made from the idea of a vessel containing the beneficent genius of the house, whose release by the breaking of the pot would bring disaster, to the idea that it was the prison into which an evil spirit had been banished and rendered harmless. It can also be appreciated how readily the use of similar methods, based on the latter belief, might be adopted as a counter-measure against witchcraft, especially as it was believed that the witches acted through the agency of familiar spirits. It seems very probable that there is in fact a close relationship between our English witch-bottles and these magical jugs of the Continent. It can hardly be a coincidence that our seventeenth century ancestors disposed of their witch-bottles in exactly the same way-by burying them beneath the threshold or the hearth, or by throwing them away into water. Nevertheless, the contents of the English witch-bottle are quite different, and the composition of the charm can probably be attributed to the fusion of two distinct practices. A closely related counter-measure against witchcraft is the custom of boiling the urine of the victim with 25 Ludwig HAnselmann, " Die vergrabenen und eingemauerten Thongeschirre des Mittelalters ", in Westermanns Jahrbuch der Illustrierten Deutschen Monat- shefte, vol. 41 (1876-7), pp. 393-405. 26 A.

By this means it is believed that the witch can be detected, either by her sudden appearance while the liquid is boiling, or by the scratches which appear on her face a few days later. This practice seems to be older than the use of the witch-bottle, for a reference is made to it by George Gifford in A Dialogue concerning Witches and Witchcraft, published in 1593, a date considerably older than any witch-bottle yet known.28 The introduction of the charm of the magical jug, imperfectly understood, into a region where this practice was already familiar, might well have led to the development of the typical witch-bottle. A further factor, already discussed, was the common use in the eastern counties of the bellarmine jug with its human face. This probably suggested the idea of " image magic ", so that the charm came to be regarded as a magical symbol of the witch or wizard, rather than a trap for an evil spirit. An attempt has been made in this paper to trace the history of the witch-bottle back to its origins, both by documentary and archaeological evidence, and the trail leads quite clearly back as far as the witch- bellarmines of the eastern counties. From that point, however, fixed chronologically just before the middle of the seventeenth century, it is lost in obscurity. On the Continent, however, we find at this period another custom, somewhat similar in its methods, and believed to have much the same purpose-viz. the trapping of evil in a vessel of some kind. This can be traced back to the later Middle Ages, and seems to be the final degenerate phase of the ancient custom of the foundation sacri- fice. If we can link these two lines of development, therefore, we can give the witch-bottle a very lengthy pedigree indeed. The evidence at present is still inconclusive. Dutch influence was strong in East Anglia in the first half of the seventeenth century, and the introduction of a foreign custom about this time is by no means unlikely. On the other hand it is possible that an analogous custom was already in existence in England before this date. Further finds may yet throw some light on this problem, and attention is drawn to the importance of recording, not only obvious " witch-bottles ", but any discovery of pottery vessels that appear to have been buried beneath old houses, or are found in other circumstances which suggest that they were deliberately deposited, rather than merely lost or thrown away. In conclusion, I must express my indebtedness to the numerous folk- lorists, museum curators, archaeologists, and others, both in this country, and in the Netherlands and Germany, who have contributed valuable information during the preparation of this paper. 28 George Gifford, A Dialogue concerning Witches and Witchcraft, 1593, sig.
