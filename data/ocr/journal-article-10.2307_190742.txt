<plain_text><page sequence="1">A SYMPOSIUM ON MICHAEL OAKESHOTT 1. INDIVIDUALITY, CIVILITY, AND THEORY The Philosophical Imagination of Michael Oakeshott JOSIAH LEE AUSP(TZ Somnerville, Massachusetts 1 5 VEN BEFORE THE PUBLICATION last year of his extra- ordinary new book' there was sufficient evidence to argue that Michael Oakeshott was the most genuinely philosophical mind writing on political themes and one of the few living masters of the learned English essay. His work had already evinced the harmony of theme, style, method, allusion, and guiding passion that distinguishes the best theorizing on politics. Yet so little has his name been known among otherwise well-read Americans that those honoring his accomplishment have found themselves more often regarded as recherche right-wingers than as simple admirers of excellence in thought and letters. The neglect of Oakeshott in this country might be thought to stem from his nonchalance: his indifference to recruiting "disciples," his modest list of full-length books, his instinct for avoiding combat, his nondoctri- naire brand of "conservatism," his insistence that there are no practical "messages" or "lessons" to be extracted from his philosophy, or indeed from any philosophy worthy of the name. But even were he to have been endowed with the magnetism, zeal, and flamboyance of a Harold Laski, or with the faith in Royal Commission Reports of a Graham Wallas (Oakeshott's two predecessors in the University Professorship of Political Science at the London School of Economics) the circle of his admirers could not have been much wider. The problem has been the radicalism of POLITICAL THEORY, Vol. 4 No. 3, August 1976 (C 1976 Josiah Lee Auspitz [2611</page><page sequence="2">[262] POLITICAL THEORY / AUGUST 1976 his thought itself, and the difficulty which most readers might reasonably be expected to have with the idiom in which it is presented. His essays, being essays, are ambulatory and suggestive. And the position which they elegantly evoke could not be properly understood without a grasp of Experience and Its Modes (1933),2 until now his sole systematic work. Yet to appreciate this treatise and to sketch the lines that connect it with his occasional pieces has hitherto required a kind of philosophical imagination that has been driven underground in the English-speaking world and has, for reasons unrelated to intellectual merit, even lacked a constituency in the eclectic and expansionary postwar American university. For Oakeshott admitted in his first treatise to an admiration for Plato, Hegel, and Bradley. He thus stood a self-confessed "idealist" at a time when the label itself, along with that of "meta- physics," was taken as sufficient reason among up-and-coming English- speaking academics to dismiss an author out of hand. The intellectual fashion may again be changing. A renewed concern for wholeness in experience and for a philosophical examination of religion, politics, morals, law, art, and history (as well as of the foundations of science and mathematics) has led to renewed interest not only in "idealism" (always something of a misnomer) but in ambitious and systematic work in other traditions. In an altered climate, Oakeshott's single-minded devotion to good philosophy, regardless of its school ties, may perhaps gain for him in the coming decade the careful attention he has long deserved. And his exceptionally chaste statement of the nature of the philosopher's commitment may provide an accessible introduction to a kind of critical thinking that has been in eclipse for more than a generation. L Experience and Its Modes distinguished three worlds of ideas: science, history, and practice. (A later essay added poetry to the list.) These are not the only coherent realms of human activity, and indeed, even to call them "realms" suggests a misleading analogy. They are not subdivisions or provinces of experience, nor are they mutually exclusive of each other. They are "modes," that is, modifications of the whole of experience. In each mode we select an aspect of experience and organize it in a coherent way. Each mode is thus a window to the world. There is nothing in experience that cannot simultaneously be treated as a problem for all three modes.</page><page sequence="3">Auspitz / INDIVIDUALITY, CIVILITY, THEORY [2631 Take human action, for example. The scientist sees it as "behavior," regular processes susceptible to mathematical modeling; the historian sees it under the category of the passage of time, as events contingently related to each other in a web of intelligible conduct. The man of "practice," which is to say all of us when we make prudential and moral judgments, looks at action in terms of the changes which can be wrought by human agency; he judges it under such categories as "fact" and "value," "right" and "wrong," "is" and "ought," and relates it to some concept of the "self." History, science, and practice, then, are all organized by distinctive categories. Each has its own varieties of truth and meaning. Each has room within it for different moods and voices. But the philosopher, as a philosopher, must remain dissatisfied with all of them. Precisely because they are modes, history, science, and practice cannot adequately represent the totality of experience. Nor are they capable of knowing their own limits; on the contrary, each is inherently imperialistic. The demand for coherence within each mode will lead it to assimilate all experience on its own terms. It will abstract only that which will fit homogeneously within its categorial framework. The scientist, qua scientist, will always try to cast experience into quantitative notation: present him with democracy and he will give you a regression analysis of voting behavior, with an economy and he will correlate statistical indices of its prosperity. The historian likewise turns all experience into grist for his mill: he will look at exact science itself in terms of its development, seeing it as a succession of contingently related paradigms for inquiry. The scientific view of a nature independent of the percipient subject, the historian will see not as the quintessence of "realism" but as an interpretive construct internal to the enterprise of science at a certain stage. As for the man of practice, need we be told how he views the other modes? He is forever asking how science and history will make the world-his world-better, how they will impinge on his religion, improve his morals, direct his politics, and enhance his way of life. He can accept science only as technology and history only as myth, inspiration and example. It might be supposed that the philosopher has a useful role as the umpire of boundary disputes between the various modes. But again, the analogy of a territory divided into realms (or a university faculty into departments) has no place in Oakeshott's thought. Philosophy may, indeed, cut each genre of discourse down to size, but this is an effect incidental to its main calling, which is to embrace the totality of</page><page sequence="4">[264] POLITICAL THEORY / AUGUST 1976 experience. The impulsion of philosophy is to see experience without "reservation or arrest, without presupposition or postulates, without limit or category."3 Western philosophy, in Oakeshott's view, is critical philosophy. It asserts the totality of experience by exposing the partiality and abstract- ness of the several modes of experience. In much the same way as each mode assimilates all of experience to its point of view, the philosopher assimilates each mode to a larger point of view faithful to the totality of experience. Instead of treating experience under the category of quantity (as in science), of volition (as in practice), or of the past (as in history), the philosopher deals with it under the ultimate category-a world of ideas. He unmasks every mode by exposing the i4eas that limit it. Or, to put the matter more positively, he gives a reasoned account of the several categorial frameworks he finds in experience. These frameworks he understands in terms of their postulates or absolute presuppositions. Each framework is inconceivable without certain organizing categories that appear recursively throughout it, are intrinsic to it, and are irrefutable within it. To elucidate them is to understand a mode of experience in terms that differentiate it from other modes. But more importantly for philosophy, it is to see that each mode is merely a mode, that each genre of experience falls short of wholeness. For if we provide a map of experience, we show by indirection that the choice of any given position on the map is arbitrary (though not capricious) and that the only logical point of view that can claim completeness is the philosopher's critical standpoint. In demonstrating this, the philosopher may perform a service useful within each genre of activity. He may remind the protagonists within each mode of their postulates and limitations. He may provide a positive statement of each mode that clarifies its basic purposes and presupposi- tions. And this may help to rectify confused discourse. But to provide a doctrine, gospel, or ideology for laborers in the vineyards of history, science, and practice is foreign to the philosopher's calling. His aim is only to be true to the totality of experience, and this means that he is always subversive of the absolute claims common within any mode. To the historian, scientist, or man of affairs, singly and in combination, the philosopher can give no advice. For them he has only one message: Your worlds may seem adequate to you, but they offer something less than full concreteness. The reader may object that the role Oakeshott proposes for philosophy is so empty, formal, negative, and ambitious as to be lacking in the familiar</page><page sequence="5">Auspitz / INDIVIDUALITY, CIVILITY, THEORY [265] consolations of professional life. To which he replies that professional satisfaction is not the philosopher's concern. Nor, indeed, is any worldly satisfaction. Philosophy is an escape from the active life, including the life of active research and scholarship. It requires a cultivated disdain for life, a surrendering of the green for the grey, a profoundly skeptical and indifferent mood which if held to constantly would be at once "febrile and insipid," but a mood to which the philosopher will return despite himself. To be a philosopher full-time Oakeshott writes, is to be something "more or less human," and philosophy "stands more to lose by professionalism and its impedimenta than any other study." Yet we can all engage in philosophy intermittently "without putting ourselves in compe- tition."4 The philosopher, then, does not pursue a metier, he falls victim to a mood. He enters into it not to excel, to earn a livelihood, to make converts, or even (as Nietzsche charged) to claim final victory over the world, but because he cannot help himself. "Philosophy is a born outcast, useless to men of business and troublesome to men of pleasure.... To turn philosophy into a way of life is at once to have abandoned life and philosophy. Philosophy is not the enhancement of life, it is the denial of life."5 Only religion, he added, can provide full coherence to the practical life, yet by virtue of providing absolute truth within practice it falls short of providing an adequate criterion for science, history, or philosophy. With such views stated boldly and even ardently (Oakeshott was only 31 when he wrote the book), it is understandable that the author should lack a following in graduate schools of philosophy and theology alike. That he has also lacked an audience among a less professional reading public is, however, attributable to another feature of the treatise that pervades his later essays. For Experience and Its Modes is structured to convey a suppressed polemic against some of the most powerful dogmas of modern intellectual life, dogmas which Oakeshott later grouped under the head of Rationalism. Rationalism is his term for a confusion of genres, the misapplication of the findings of rational inquiry to human conduct. It covers both what others have called "scientism," the attempt to guide life by science, and "historicism," the attempt to extract unambiguous principles from history. For it follows from Oakeshott's argument that science and history, as modes, are unassimilable to practice on their own terms. To the extent that they are required to seek practical "relevance" they corrupt themselves. It follows also that each of the several forms of practical activity has its own integrity: religion cannot be refuted by science or</page><page sequence="6">[266] POLITICAL THEORY / AUGUST 1976 history, politics cannot be guided by them. morals cannot be directed by them, and prudence would do well to remain unawed by their latest findings. Oakeshott drew out these implications in two of the best-known of his essays, "Rationalism in Politics" and "Rational Conduct." Experience and Its Modes thus sets up the problem of theory and practice in a way that runs exactly counter to the gnostic tendencies of modern thought. It can be seen as presenting a kind of impossibility theorem: scientific and historical inquiry cannot guide practice; con- versely, practice cannot inform scientific and historical theory. And philosophy has nothing to say to any of them save that they are all incomplete and that a life devoted to any one of them is an abridgement of experience. Now this radical way of posing the problem achieves Oakeshott's main purpose: it provides an uncompromising statement of the nature of philosophy, and it shows the futility of "Rationalism" in a way that makes the two later essays supererogatory. On its own terms, however, it falls short of a philosophically adequate treatment of theory and practice. History and science are primarily ways of knowing. Practice is primarily a matter of doing. But from the philosopher's point of view, knowing and doing, like so many conventional antinomies, are interpenetrating con- cepts. So the reader of Oakeshott's treatise can hardly fail to ask what kind of doing is present in science and history: what do we mean when we speak of the "practice of science" or, to take the title of one of Oakeshott's later essays, "the activity of being an historian." Conversely, what kind of knowing is entailed in practice? What is practical knowledge, practical understanding, or that exercise of judgment which Aristotle called phronesis? Further, if we are to argue that historical and scientific judgment are irrelevant to politics, education, morals, and religion, what affirmative account can we give of the kind of judgment that is relevant? And finally, what are we to make of the "practice of philosophy" itself? Is philosophy the passive contemplation of the totality of experience, or is it an active engagement in public theorizing comparable to science and history? I. All these questions arise from the over-economy of concepts in Oakeshott's first philosophy. His later writings pursue resolutions of them. The first ambiguity to be cleared up is the role of philosophy itself.</page><page sequence="7">Auspitz / INDIVIDUALITY, CIVILITY, THEORY [267] Oakeshott's initial treatise, after all, can be taken to suggest that philosophy reaches perfection in a purely contemplative mood, as in Eastern meditation on the Oneness of the All; that it has a uniquely negative mission, as in Bradley's searing criticism of conventional disjunctions between body and soul, space and time, quality and relation, analytic and synthetic judgments, the self and that extemal to it; or that it presents an unmediated, esoteric knowledge fundamentally different from that contained in science and history. In "The Concept of a Philosophical Jurisprudence" (1938)6 Oakeshott rules out all of these readings. The Westem philosophical tradition, as he sees it, is not merely critical, but also discursive and affirmative. Only by affirming what something is can one state definitively what it is not. Philosophical method, moreover, does not differ in kind from theorizing in science and history; it simply takes the purely reflective aspect of these disciplines to the most radical lengths. Its authority comes not from esoteric knowledge but from an ability to relate all other points of view to a larger context faithful to the unity of experience, of knowledge and of theorizing. The philosopher does not contemplate this unity or meditate upon it. He postulates it as a criterion. He necessarily refers to but does not gaze directly upon a vision of what Plato likened to the sun. In an exquisite essay written ten years later (The Voice of Poetry in the Conversations of Mankind, published in 1959)7 Oakeshott takes further distance from a neo-Platonic ideal. "I do not myself know where to place an experience released altogether from modality," he writes.8 All that can be rescued from an ideal of pure contemplation, he says, properly belongs to artistic experience. The artist and poet delight in finished, stable worlds that convey a sense of unity and self-completeness. These are worlds of enduring images, never outdated by new research or altered by logical argument. The philosopher, with his continual questionings and revisings, cannot long tarry here. He is forever en voyage, seeking logical rather than metaphorical form for the self-understandings of civilization. It is as markers in a journey, then, that Oakeshott's occasional essays and reviews can be most profitably read. At their best, they are beautiful and sublime. They evoke a sense of the fullness and subtlety of human experience. But they contain too much of the green of life to meet the standard which Oakeshott has set for philosophy. Their elegance is more often literary than philosophical. They present their insights figuratively, with the use of metaphor, analogy, and description, rather than with the straightforward assertion of organizing categories. They more often characterize than theorize. They are not, in sum, sufficiently grey. Yet</page><page sequence="8">[268] POLITICAL THEORY / AUGUST 1976 they do introduce a more nuanced view of experience that contains the raw material for the resolution of the difficulties in Oakeshott's first philosophy. Experience, we learn in these essays, can be viewed as a "conversation," in which the several modes are "voices," "idioms," or "languages." Oakeshott uses the image of a conversation to demystify so-called dialectical relations by returning the word dialectic to its root meaning. From this image there flows, almost effortlessly, an emphasis on cultivated individuality. Each "voice" in a conversation has its own character which reflects a tradition of thought and activity. Each changes only when it recognizes its own deficiencies or assimilates new material on its own terms. The voices of politics, religion, history, science, art, and philosophy do not compete on the same ground and are not bound to reach a consensus. The relations among them in civilized discourse are those "not of assertion and denial but ... of acknowledgement and accommoda- tion."9 The conversational relation is replicated within each mode. There is no single right way to speak the language of history or science, art or politics, dance, sport, or philosophy. In these activities, one is always, in effect, following intimations from a tradition and in so doing disclosing and forming one's own character. That is why "every significant act or utterance has a style of its own, a personal idiom, an individual manner of thinking of which it is a reflection." 1 0 Here, then, is the moral force of Oakeshott's rendition of the dialectical image: a conversation is a pageant of individuality. By viewing human experience as a conversation between modes and by viewing each mode as itself an activity, a tradition, and a language, Oakeshott draws a picture of the world as bristling with intelligence. Every development within a tradition is the result of choices by thinking human beings. There is no such thing as an historical trend, a social class, an infrastructure, institution, or culture that does not derive from intelligible human relationships. And these relationships, because they are not mechanical, fixed, or inert, can never be adequately captured in rules. To mistake the grammar for the language, the legal code for the law as "a living method of social integration,"1"I the techniques of experimentation and quantifica- tion for the shared traditions of the scientific community-these are gross errors. They lead to a moral obtuseness, to an inability to "detect an individual intelligence which is at work in every utterance, even those which convey impersonal information." 1 2</page><page sequence="9">Auspitz / INDIVIDUALITY, CIVILITY, THEORY [269] So intent is Oakeshott on making a place for human individuality that he revises in these essays his earlier use of the term practice. Science and history, even philosophy itself, now become "practices," settled activities with their own traditions. As such they are, as Oakeshott acknowledged in a review of Michael Polanyi's work, arenas for personal knowledge and individual style. An emphasis on the same theme is evident in four essays on Thomas Hobbes, whom he does not let go until he has wrung from him a vindication of the "morality of individuality."' 3 Individuality in the sense Oakeshott uses it is not, of course, to be mistaken for "individualism" or "egoism." It refers to a humane ideal, not to an economic appetite. Its roots are in the middle ages, and are given philosophical form in scholastic nominalism; it emerges in full regalia in Italy, which, at the end of the thirteenth century-and here Oakeshott uses Burkhardt's words-"began to swarm with individuality; the ban laid upon human personality was dissolved; a thousand figures meet us, each in his own special shape and dress."'"' Each individual is a self-cultivated person, shaped by the way in which he choses to enter into the conversation of mankind. His education is a matter of learning the several languages of civilized, discourse, of making part of himself the heritage that his time and place present to him. By education he reclaims his cultural birthright, he learns to understand and respond to the manifold voices around him and to develop, at length, his own distinctive manner of speaking. The emergence of individuality Oakeshott sees as "the preeminent event in modern European history."' 5 It carries with it an emphasis on freedom, privacy, plurality, and self-determination. It brings in its train an appreciation and harnessing of the positive benefits of self-interest, self-respect, self-knowledge, and self-love. Individuality requires a civil order that guarantees the liberties of speech, religion, voluntary associa- tion, and the free disposition of one's property and labor. It can flourish only where laws are promulgated by a unitaiy sovereign and apply, equally to all, for equality before the law breaks the chains of ascribed status and privilege and permits the fullest scope to free agency. In the regime that values individuality, the conscious relationships of "association" replace the unthinking solidarity of "community"; the rule of law replaces the hegemony of duty, station, virtue, or corporate purpose. For Oakeshott, individuality has its complement in civility, the view of government as the umpire of disputes and the guarantor of civil peace: Governing is a specific and limited activity, namely the provision and custody of general rules of conduct, which are understood not as plans for imposing</page><page sequence="10">1270] POLITICAL THEORY /AUGUST 1976 substantive activities, but as instruments enabling people to pursue the activities of their own choice with the minimum frustration.... 1 6 All this is felicitously put, but not yet philosophically satisfying. There is a great difference between characterizing an "ideal" and defining it. Oakeshott's essays thus leave him not merely with a terminological deviation from his earlier use of the word "practice" but with a much deeper philosophical problem. He has grasped figuratively the texture and nuance of human activity; he has seen that one cannot separate the dancer from the dance, the action from the activity that gives it meaning; he has recognized that human beings are continually reworking their traditions and languages to adjust to each other's expressed needs; and he has perceived this to be an intelligent and intelligible procedure, which, though he calls it conversational, is not limited to words and argumentation. But since it is in words and argumentation that philosophy must deal, the task remains to put these insights into discursive form, so that they need not always be sneaked in through the back door as aesthetic sensibilities. And there is the further complication, raised by Oakeshott's views on government and politics, of proposing a unified set of categories that will also make possible a view of the civil order as a sphere of rule-making. To assert categorically, in the same philosophical breath, that all human conduct evinces an individuality that cannot be captured in rules and that setting rules of conduct is the essence of government is not easy. It requires a single set of concepts adequate to both historical explanation and legal judgment. III. In the opening pages of On Human Conduct we learn that Michael Oakeshott has abandoned none of the fine discriminations his previous work imposes upon him. He distinguishes firmly between identifying an entity in terms of its characteristics and dealing with it in tenns of its postulates or conditions: the philosopher, he again asserts, strives to understand in terms of its organizing categories what he already understands in more mundane terms. He makes clear also that notwith- standing his work on Hobbes he separates "theory" as an academic speciality from "theorizing" as an intellectual engagement: to hold sway over the great texts of the past is not to be, in the full sense, a theorist. And finally, he distinguishes the theorist from the "theoretician" who tries</page><page sequence="11">Auspitz / INDIVIDUALITY, CIVILITY, THEORY [2711 to "apply" the results of theorizing to the giving of advice: the attempt to make theorizing directly relevant to life, Oakeshott still maintains, is always fraudulent. He then lays out the fruits of his reflection on two large topics-human conduct in general and civil association as a form of human conduct. To each of these topics he devotes an exceptionally concentrated essay. Together the two essays run fewer than two hundred pages, and by the end of the second it is clear not only that he has found a vocabulary to resolve the anomalies in his earlier work, but also that he has made an original statement on some perennial issues in the philosophy of politics. Each essay rests on fewer than a dozen carefully chosen concepts, far too many to explore here. Yet one central concept-that of "practice"- suffices to draw into coherent relation three main themes we have noted in his earlier work. First, by distinguishing a "practice" from a "process" Oakeshott is able to make a concise statement on the nature of theory; second, by showing the relation between a "performance" and a "practice" he elucidates the ideal character of individuality; third, by showing that association in terms of a "practice" differs radically from association with a "purpose" he is able to define the nature of civility. Technically, this usage is remarkable for its elegance; philosophically, for its profundity. Oakeshott now defines "practice" to denote not the performance of an act but the ordered context from which the performance draws its meaning. He thus makes precise the usage of his essays, in which a practice came to mean the "language," activity or tradition in which action is meaningful. In this view, science is a practice, since it provides settled conditions to which the community of scientists subscribe. History, philosophy, and anthropology are practices in this same sense, and so, too, are morality, language, parliamentary politics, carpentry, the manufacture of widgets, and the celebration of Thanksgiving. Some practices are so inclusive as to be ways of life, as in religious or ethical practice; others achieve sufficient conceptual integrity that we can call them "modes"; others carry with them an ordering of regulations and offices so that we can speak of them as institutional; others still are customs, rituals, maxims, arts, skills, or simply considerations to be taken into account. Practice is thus the generic term which Oakeshott uses for all human relationships which achieve a settled condition. The only acts one can call "impractical" are either solecisms, which meet inadequately the conditions of a practice, or solipsisms, which ignore them in the futile attempt to be free of all traditions.</page><page sequence="12">[272] POLITICAL THEORY / AUGUST 1976 This is not a novel philosophical usage (Oakeshott himself interprets Hegel's use of sittlich as akin to his notion of the practical). But in Oakeshott's hands it shifts attention from the distinction between theory and practice (theoretical engagements now being seen as practices of a peculiar kind) to the distinction between a "practice" and a "process." A practice is formed by the accumulation of conscious human relationships and can therefore be altered by the workings of reflective consciousness. A process, by contrast, is a linkage of events which does not depend on reflective agency. The natural scientist necessarily treats phenomena as processes, and the behavioral scientist extends this approach into the sphere of human action. Oakeshott has nothing to say in criticism, of such treatment, which has its own integrity aiVd order of inquiry. But he makes clear at every stage in his exposition that to view human action as a process is not to see it as meaningful conduct. In a process human beings are bundles of functionally related components; in a practice they are intelligent agents. In a process they can be manipulated to respond in a certain way; in a practice they need to be persuaded. In a process they mechanically optimize measurable outputs; in a practice they deliberate over courses of action. Students of processes have an eye for unvarying laws and theorems of behavior; students of practices, for individual choices. Students of processes cannot accept qualitative judgments until they are cast into quantitative notation; those of practices cannot accept quantitative correlations except as indices of qualitative variation. Seen as backdrops to a process, institutions are inert fixtures; seen as elements in a practice they are living and changing relationships. The process-analyst is interested in probabilities; the theorist of practices in contingencies. In the concluding pages of his first essay Oakeshott makes clear where this distinction leads: to a forceful and sophisticated argument about the nature of historical explanation. History is the understanding of events as contingently related, and Oakeshott sketches the outlines of a case, to be elaborated elsewhere, for the irreducibility of contingent relations to the causal or probabilistic relations which are paradigmatic in the natural sciences. He makes clear also that his full exposition will contain at least one decided improvement over the approach of R. G. Collingwood. And he answers one of the central questions posed by his earlier work: history is the appropriate mode for coming to a theoretical understanding of performances within practices, including the contingent aspects of the practice of philosophy itself. An historical understanding of philosophy, politics, or anything else is not, of course, to be confused with the</page><page sequence="13">Auspitz / INDIVIDUALITY, CIVILITY, THEORY [273] knowledge which practitioners have of how to conduct themselves. The "moral and prudential lore" useful within an activity is different from the history of it, the mutual understandings of bargainers is not what is represented in the historian's understanding of their situation, and those rough "theorems" which may encapsulate the principles and propositions of practical lore should not be confused with a theoretical understanding of conduct. In all, Oakeshott's distinction between a practice and a process-and the parallel distinctions that can be added to it between conduct and behavior, contingency and causality, persuasion and manipulation, deliberation and optimization-restates the integrity of what Dilthey and other German writers have called the "human sciences" (Geisteswissenschaften). IV. A second striking effect of Oakeshott's reworking of "practice" is to make the ideal of praxis possible for all men. The Greek term conjures up a classical ideal: the free and purposeful expression of individuality in an ordered context. This ideal, now called humanistic, was aristocratic in its origins. It exalted heroic action that was unconstrained by considerations of material well-being, irreducible to mere technique, and unfettered by the need to produce a product or perform a skill. Such action could not exist between a man and his tools, his thoughts, his household necessaries, or his physical environment. It could be realized only by free citizens at those moments when they revealed their character in full public view through their words and deeds. The idealization of praxis had certain social prerequisites. It required the existence of slaves to perform tasks essential to the subsistence of the community. It required a class of craftsmen, artists, and traders to perform skilled activities. Only then could there remain a realm of pure conduct that was not bleared with toil, that could not be replicated, routinized, calculated, or predicted. This was the moral and political activity reserved to the citizen. In the political life of the polis such conduct occurred not only in voting but in long deliberations, exhausting consultations, many speeches, much intrigue, and some grand deeds. It involved a striving for excellence and recognition in full public view. Even the laws of the community were seen merely as a backdrop to make possible praxis in this noble sense.</page><page sequence="14">[274] POLITICAL THEORY / AUGUST 1976 The ideal permeated not only the politics of the polis, but also its ritual use of drama and sport. What were the dramatic festivals and the Olympic games if not arenas for revelation of the character and prowess of free men before an audience of their peers? The very theology of the polis ratified the ideal. What, indeed, are the elaborate intrigues of the Greek gods if not the apotheosis of praxis? The gods, the games, the dramatic festivals, the political deliberations-these not entirely harmonious elements of Greek culture have seemed in the retrospective view of philosophy to be all of a piece. They all present the spectacle of "individualities forming them- selves." They all constitute, to borrow another phrase from Hegel, "the Kingdom of the Beautiful Freedom." Visions of that "Kingdom" continue to inspire modern thought: every philosopher who uses the term praxis or some vernacular equivalent signals an aspiration to make place for an ideal which combines freedom, excellence, virtue, and self-revelatory striving. It is this aspiration, reborn in the Renaissance, deepened with reflective consciousness, and dispersed like sparks of holiness through a far more complex division of labor than the Greeks could imagine, that Oakeshott evokes when he speaks in his essays of "individuality." And it is the philosophical attempt to define the ideal character of praxis that is evident in the very title of On Human Conduct. Conduct, practice, action, acting, doing, performing-all these are possible English equivalents for praxis. It is indicative of the suppleness of Oakeshott's view that he uses all of these terms, not interchangeably but with specified import to capture the full range of meanings that have accrued to the Greek term since Socrates denied and Aristotle reasserted its conceptual integrity. "Conduct inter homines," or simply "human conduct," is Oakeshott's general term for the concept of meaningful action. Its "postulates," the categories that must be accepted to discuss it, include "persuasion," "deliberation," and that kind of "explanation" in which we give reasons for acting. More profoundly, they include "agency," "choice," and a relation between a "practice" and a "performance." Whether or not persuasion, deliberation, and explanation are consciously articulated, conduct exists wherever we can discern a tension between the ordered context of an activity (the "practical" element) and the personal style, situation, and freely chosen purposes of the agent (the "performa- tive" element). Which is to say that conduct-and with it individuality- can be observed everywhere, in all those "encounters of recipr.-city in which agents converse with one another." 1 7</page><page sequence="15">Auspitz / INDIVIDUALITY, CIVILITY, THEORY [275] If practices were processes, this could not be the case. But since they are themselves shaped by the collected relationships of previous practi- tioners, they are rule-like without being fully articulable in a code of rules. They provide general considerations about how to act but no explicit directives about what to do or say in particular circumstances. In some small way every performance shapes the future of the practice, just as our usage of the English language alters it even while subscribing to its grammatical and syntactical conditions. And just as our use of language discloses who we are, so every practice is itself a "language of self-disclosure," in which the practitioner reveals his own character as he shapes the practice to his needs. Moral practice provides the most inclusive illustration, for morality is coextensive with all other practices. This is why every practice is sittlich: in addition to its distinctive substance and techniques it involves a shaping of general mores, as well as an inner morality of its own. Moral practice is thus much more than a code of commandments imposed exogenously upon compartmentalized activities. It is "a continuously improvised dance whose participants are alive to one another's movements and the ground on which they tread.'" 8 In making moral choices the agent discloses what kind of person he is. But what is also at issue in moral judgment is the kind of person one would like to become: it is not merely the revelation (and entrenchment) of existing character that is at stake but the formation of future character. This self-formative aspect of moral practice is what Oakeshott refers to when he calls morality a "language of self-enactment" as well as one of self-disclosure. In all this, it should be repeated, the individuality of the agent is evident in the tension between a "practice" and a "performance." Just as Oakeshott's distinction of a practice from a process has far-reaching consequences for the nature of theory, the distinction between a practice and a performance has deep implications for the nature of individuality. It shows the classical ideal to have organizing categories which are not limited to noble, aristocratic, or political activities but which may be observed in all intelligent goings-on. Oakeshott thus transforms praxis from an ideal to be celebrated in high politics to an ideal character to be elucidated philosophically and illustrated in countless situations. As a philosopher, he can do little else. His dedication to the totality of experience does not permit him to accept the classical ideal as sufficient, to use it didactically (after the manner of Hannah Arendt) as a touchstone for contemporary politics, or to invoke it (after followers of the early Marx, the late Nietzsche, or the latest Sartre) in the cause of political</page><page sequence="16">[276] POLITICAL THEORY / AUGUST 1976 activism. He can serve the ideal only by deflating and demystifying it, that is, by integrating it into a broader world of ideas that will at once assure its place in our view of experience and expose its limitations. This more oblique aim is in any case preferable, for the Greek ideal is not, sad to say, a self-sufficient or fully mature one. Pursued directly, it beckons us toward a regime that has no staying power. Hegel was not wrong in identifying the Kingdom of the Beautiful Freedom with the naive and exuberant childhood of mankind. Its child-like insouciance will lead, uncorrected, to its own destruction. There can be no other outcome, because the classical ideal, for reasons contingent in the Greek social order, leaves out the preconditions to its own survival. It ignores the repetitive operations that enable us to maintain lasting institutions. It soars so high above the workday concerns of subsistence, production, and technique as to view them as beneath judgments of good and evil: the lower orders, occupied with routine, are merely banal. Its blithe superiority to legal craftsmanship seals its evanescence. For if interpretation of law is seen as a lowly technique rather than an all-important calling, what will sustain the community between its bursts of beautiful freedom? What will assure the regularity of its customs and the adaptation of its traditions if all its best efforts are put into sport, drama, political speechifying, and battlefield heroics? Surely not the will of the gods, themselves no paragons of constancy. Nor even the sobering counsels of reason, for as Thucydides unflinchingly illustrates, reason put at the service of glory merely makes the life of praxis more methodically self-destructive. V. Reconciling praxis with law, justice, and order is, of course, one of the central problems in the use of the Greek categories. Here Nietzsche's dictum applies: the Greeks, as charioteers, hold the reins to our own and every other modern culture. We are tempted either to deny individuality for the sake of stability and blind obedience or to embrace a fleeting, expressive ideal of politics. To cope with this problem institutionally we cling to notions of balance and moderation and enact them in elaborate legal procedures and safeguards. But to deal with it philosophically requires that we break the traces of Helias and give conceptual form to the unarticulated presuppositions of what is best in modern political practice. Oakeshott does so with characteristic economy and dispatch. He gives</page><page sequence="17">Auspitz / INDIVIDUALITY, CIVILITY, THEORY [277] individuality the maximal play in experience, while confining it to the minimal role in politics. He introduces no new conceptual apparatus but simply turns to the light a third facet of his concept of practice: the distinction between association in terms of a common "practice" and association in terms of a common "purpose." Those, for example, who speak the French language are most appropriately viewed as associated in a practice, not in a common purpose or enterprise. But one can also (as many Frenchmen have) view all French-speakers as associated in an enterprise of rational clarity or in a civilizing mission, in which case one judges them not as formal equals, French-speakers, but by their contribution to the collective project. Similarly, even those who have a knowledge of an instrumental practice like medicine need not share any given purpose. Physicians, in fact, take a separate oath pledging themselves to employ their know-how for specified purposes only. Lest this seem too nice a distinction, let it be noted that its significance for a philosophy of politics is enormous. It suggests that one can view government under two separate modes: either as association in an undertaking with a recognized purpose ("enterprise association") or in terms Qf common recognition of the conditions of civil practice ("civil association"). If governing is seen as an enterprise, designed to promote an identifiable set of objectives (prosperity, productivity, cultural unity) then a good citizen is a good Stakhanovite, one who makes the greatest contribution to whatever it is that the enterprise is producing. According to Oakeshott, there can be no formal equality in such a system, because common enterprisers must be judged on the scale of their contribution to corporate goals. The rights of individuals within the enterprise are logically subordinate to the project of the corporate personality. Law in such a regime will always be "administrative," instrumental to the accomplish- ment of social ends, and the emphasis within law will be on "regulation," legislating as means of issuing managerial directives. Justice in such a system will be "distributive," that is, it will concem parceling out shares in the fruits of production, and it will commonly try to balance criteria of efficiency (defined in terms of maximizing the output of the enterprise) and equity (defined as fair shares). If, on the other hand, governing is viewed as a practice, citizens share no goals. They are associated only by virtue of a common recognition of the conditions of governance, and with respect to these conditions they have formal equality. They may, by th-e aggregate of their voluntary efforts, achieve a measure of prosperity, productivity, cultural unity, or</page><page sequence="18">[278] POLITICAL THEORY / AUGUST 1976 whatever, but it is not the business of government to promote any such aims directly. Under such a regime justice will be a matter not of distributing rewards but of abiding by rules and rule-like conditions; equity will consist in assuring that the procedural conditions do not become unwieldy and oppressive; and the laws will be perceived as moral obligations, rather than as managerial directives from central headquarters. Oakeshott devotes the central, the shortest, and the most concentrated essay in On Human Conduct to expounding the full ramifications of viewing governing as a practice rather than as an enterprise. His exposition is made unnecessarily difficult by his occasional failure to provide terms which distinguish logical from pragmatic entailment, by his neglecting to make explicit some connections between his essay "On the Civil Condition" and the one which precedes it, "On the Theoretical Under- standing of Human Conduct," and by some unusually dense writing. And the uninitiated reader may find problematic the very idea of a philo- sophical definition of civil practice. Nevertheless, I cannot think of 75 more important or rewarding pages that have been published in our language in this century for anyone seriously interested in a theoretical understanding of the relations between politics, legislation, adjudication, obligation, authority, civil justice, and the rule of law. These topics, as well as the informal virtues of fairness and humanity that may accrue to them, Oakeshott collects in the term "civility." He uses the term in its oldest sense to denote not the virtues of civilization and culture but those of citizenship and civil order. And yet he also makes clear in his third and final essay, "On the Character of a Modern European State," that he views the emergence of the idea of civility as a great achievement of Western civilization, the indispensible complement to individuality. As Oakeshott defines it, civility is what we commonly identify with the rule of law. It is a peculiar kind of moral practice: one might almost call it the limiting case of morality. It is a "watery fidelity" which can unite lovers and enemies alike: "being independent of both rivalry and tender concern, it may subsist where the one is present or where the other is absent." Since it is mode of association, "there is no situation . . . to which it cannot relate."' 9 Like all morality it is noninstrumental: one follows its strictures for their own sake out of a sense of obligation. like all morality it contains a tension between general conditions and individual perform- ances. But here the shared character ends. For whereas the heart of morality is a living tradition, a way of life, an only partially verbal</page><page sequence="19">Auspitz / INDIVIDUALITY, CIVILITY, THEORY [279] language on which a code can at best be superimposed, civility, at its core, is a code. At its heart are not rule-like conditions but actual rules. And these rules are not implicit; they are not regularities of behavior; they are articulated laws. And further, the laws are not ancillary to the activity, in the way the by-laws of the Red Cross are ancillary to its main calling: in civil association the rules constitute the activity. It is only by recognition of the authority of the rules, not by any shared purpose, that members of a civil association are related. Moreover, the rules of civil association define their own world. They are not a loose set of regulations, like the rules of a game that one may voluntarily choose not to enter. They are a self-completing and self- authenticating system of laws. They are public and compulsory. They define their own subjects. They specify their own jurisdiction and their own interrelations. They do not try to persuade, and they neither curry nor require approval. Instead, they straightforwardly and authoritatively assert conditions for conduct, and they do so in the expectation not of blind obedience but of an intelligent and freely given sense of obligation. If one has mastered the practice of civility, one's obligation to the law will not stem from a fear of punishment, a hope of achieving a personal or common good, a consent to the desirability of the laws, a submission to a stronger will, to a higher law, or to a faith in any intention, expertise, or charisma of the sovereign. It will be a "free" choice in the sense of being an intelligent recognition of the practical conditions of civil association. Legal obligation is based on acknowledging, not approving, civil authority. Approval is relevant only where there are purposes to be approved, and since civil association is not enterprise association it entails an entirely different view of free choice: Its theological analogue is the freedom enjoyed when God is understood to be a "law-giver" and the believer is not only necessarily left to subscribe to his obligations as best he may but can do so only in self-chosen actions, in contrast to a divine Will to which he must submit himself and his conduct or join the party of the devil, or to a divine Purpose to which his conduct willy-nilly contributes.20 A civil rule, then, is an authoritative assertion, which is neither argumentative nor an invitation to argumentation. "It calls only for assent in any performance to which it may relate." It does not attempt to issue managerial directives to its subjects, since there is no enterprise for it to manage. It lays down "standing orders" with respect to which citizens are formal equals. The system of the standing rules for conduct and the</page><page sequence="20">[280] POLITICAL THEORY / AUGUST 1976 further rules defining the conditions under which they apply and are related provide the core of civil practice. This system is not, of course, to be confused with everything that is called law in modern government, and to avoid confusion Oakeshott calls it lex. Lex is, in the sense Hegel used the term, "abstract" and therefore not self-sufficient. If the obligations and authorizations of abstract law are to be observed in conduct, lex needs a living embodiment. It needs to be supplemented by additional conditions that will be meaningful to real people who require that conduct be explained, that it be made persuasive, and that it be susceptible to deliberation. Persuasion, deliberation, and practical explanation are, indeed, conditions of all human conduct. They can be ignored, as we have seen earlier, qnly by viewing human action as a process. In civil association the postulates of persuasion, deliberation, and explanation take the form of politics, legislation, and adjudication. To complete his definition of the civil condition, therefore, Oakeshott must also draw politics, legislation, and adjudication into a coherent relation with lex. The totality of this relation is the civil condition. VI. In Oakeshott's view, politics and legislation concern themselves with the desirability and authority of lex, adjudication with its meaning. In adjudication, abstract law is illustrated in specific cases. The weight of previous cases forms a body of precedent to guide new judicial decisions. Adjudication thus provides an accumulating interpretation of what the law is in contingent situations and an explanation of how it is enforced. It is an authoritative procedure which does not question the desirability of the laws and does not, as in arbitration, attempt to persuade the parties or to win their favor. In politics and legislation, by contrast, one is always deliberating over the desirability of the laws, the conditions for sustaining their authority, and for persuading citizens to accept a given outcome. Here approval and disapproval of specific measures is directly relevant. Whereas adjudication is based on the assumption of continuing acqui- escence to the laws, politics assumes continuing criticism of them. Whereas adjudication limits itself to practical explanation, in politics we have deliberation and persuasion. Hence Oakeshott's dictum that in the regime of civility the conduct of politics requires "a disciplined imagination": citizens attempt to change the law while submitting to it; they question its desirability while accepting the irrelevance of such questioning to</page><page sequence="21">Auspitz / INDIVIDUALITY, CIVILITY, THEORY [281] currently adjudicated disputes. And if they use their allegiance to the law as a bargaining counter in changing it, as in civil disobedience, they risk the breakdown of the civil condition itself. Politics is disciplined in another sense: it is always tied to legislation. Though political agitation may begin in moral outrage, in a desire for material benefits, or in a vision of truth, it can end only in a change in lex. The newly politicized may be led on with promises of a better world, but in the end all they can get is a better law. And even here there are limits to what the law can achieve. Civil law is not a dependable means of conferring material benefits, for it cannot specify persons as beneficiaries; being noninstrumental it cannot attain the specific objects of a directive in an enterprise association. Nor can it fix specific values: one cannot legislate truth, morality, or productivity in civil association. Recognizing these limits, political deliberation, once it becomes germane, will always be restrained. It will invoke no general principles, for these can never settle a specific political question. Even if all citizens could agree on a common purpose, a higher law, an organic need of society, a social ideal, or a categorical imperative, they would not have therein adequate criteria for the drafting of any given piece of legislation. One cannot even derive civil law from the so-called basic law of the realm; one can only add laws which follow the equivocal intimations of the totality of the existing legal system. Legislation is not, then, a deductive enterprise. The knowledge which guides it comes not from technical expertise but from a shifting accumulation of practical lore: from general legal concepts about what constitutes a legal person, a tort, a liability, a trespass, a right, and the like, and from an "inner morality" of the legal system about what constitutes a fair rule, a humane practice, a reasonable judgment, a law-abiding action. The only "principles" which Oakeshott can find are three rules of thumb: that the laws passed should be capable of enforcement, that they should be capable of integration into the existing legal system, and that they should not enjoin citizens from actions which are purely self-regarding. In Oakeshott's civil association, then, politics is a continuing engage- ment in reworking the content of lex to accord with what the citizens consider desirable. It is an activity unique to civil association. It is not analogous to "factory politics," "faculty politics," or "sexual politics." The genuine politics of civil association is, if anything, less "political" in the pejorative, colloquial sense than the struggle for power and precedence in other activities. Civil politics is limited to seeking authoritative changes in the rules. It is a publicly negotiated bargain between those who lack</page><page sequence="22">[282] POLITICAL THEORY /AUGUST 1976 legislative authority and those who have it. Unlike a change in the by-laws of an enterprise association, a change in civil rules is never merely tactical: it is a change in the core of the practice itself. To change the rules is to have authoritatively altered the very practice of civility. It follows that the only managerial activity appropriate to civil association is, in the literal sense of the word, "ruling." Ruling is not a patina of legitimacy superadded to a preexisting police power: it is nothing more or less than the enforcement of the authority of lex. It will avail itself only of the minimal governing apparatus that is pragmatically required to uphold the law. Police power and bureaucratic agencies have no independent standing in civil association. They are used only in support of judicial judgment or in the apprehension and (more gingerly) in the prevention of crime. Oakeshott explicitly denies that civility depends on a monopoly of all force by a unified governing apparatus. Except in wartime, when the regime of civility is at least partially suspended, ruling entails no need for active policy of any kind. It is the unmistakeable thrust of Oakeshott's exposition that main- taining civil association is preeminently a problem not in managerial thinking, in military or strategic planning, in arbitration among interest groups, or in moral uplift: it is a problem in juridical thinking. It is an engagement sine ira et studio. As such "it is certainly less exciting than ... deliberating the policy and conducting the affairs of an enterprise association." Yet, he concludes, "it calls for so exact a focus of attention and so uncommon a self-restraint that one is not astonished to find this mode of human relationship to be as rare as it is excellent."2 1 VII. The reader may object that civil association in Oakeshott's sense is not simply rare but nonexistent; that it is a creation of the philosopher's imagination, for which one can find no empirical examples: neither politicians imbued with its style of politics, nor judges adhering to its view of adjudication, nor rulers possessed of its austere conception of rule. And there may be further objections on doctrinal and quodlibetal grounds: that Oakeshott's definition of civil association ignores the entrenchment of material interests established in the law itself, that it is inhospitable to a view of politics as the acting out of the finest human aspirations, that it is overly impartial between such constitutional forms as absolute monarchy and representative democracy, that it makes too rigid a disjunction</page><page sequence="23">Auspitz / INDIVIDUALITY, CIVILITY, THEORY [283] between civil justice and the moral passion for justice, that it ratifies legalism as the appropriate idiom of political thinking, that it passes over the standard topics of academic disputation, that it is insufficiently sociological, psychological, historical, or inspiring, that it gives no quarter to charisma, leadership, personal discretion, progress, higher law, or God-that it is, in sum, too pure, formal, sterile, and negative to be morally satisfying or empirically workable. Besides, there is the universalistic criticism that the idea of civil association is itself an historical development, limited to modern Western civilization. Oakeshott himself finds the idea of civility adumbrated in Hebraic notions of a divine law-giver, developed crudely in the work of Aristotle, but not given anything approaching systematic form until the work of Hobbes and of Hegel, who relieved it of dependence on natural law. In his essay "On tlhe Character of a Modern European State" he concedes an even greater particularity: civil association is the ideal character glimpsed in attempts by many writers during the past seven centuries to apply to the emerging states of modern Europe the concept of societas, which in Roman law denoted an association of formal equals united by common condition rather than by a common purpose. Societas is distinguished from the divergent legal concept of universitas, a purposive corporation, which (as Maitland records) was recognized as a legal person by Pope Innocent IV in the thirteenth century. Oakeshott's view of civil association would appear, on his own description, to be a systematization of an aspect of European reflection on the nature of the emerging state. Many would take this particularity as disqualifying any theoretical claims to universality. Such criticisms are not so much inapplicable as unphilosophical. In a philosophy of law or of the state, as in a philosophy of science, it is enough to find universality in particularity. That is, it is enough to take the ideas given by one's time and place and by an act of philosophical imagination strip away both what is merely contingent and what is so unarguably universal as not to be a differentiating category. A philo- sophical definition neither describes everything that goes on nor proposes slogans for action: it elucidates organizing categories. On these terms Oakeshott's definition of the civil condition must be counted successful. He has provided the categories that must be added to those of conduct in general if we are to speak the language of civil politics: legislation, adjudication, authority, obligation, citizenship, public and private concerns, and so on. He thus enables us to come to a theoretical understanding of what we have known all along: that there is a very great</page><page sequence="24">[284] POLITICAL THEORY / AUGUST 1976 difference between, say, waiving the rules of tenure or promotion in a university or business to accommodate men of talent and waiving the rules of civil procedure in a state. For in a corporation the rules are instrumental to the main purpose of the association, whereas in a civil order they are the very basis of the association: they mark the difference between "ruling" and "dominating," between obedience based on "(obligation" and that based on vassalage, fear, or transitory mass enthusiasm. In elucidating this, Oakeshott has given philosophical form to what is more loosely called the rule of law. He has captured the purely procedural sensibility that is the distinguishing mark of political experience. This dedication to procedure for its own sake has no exact parallel elsewhere. The only two analogies that, taken together, approximate civility are to be found in our experience with morality and language. Hence Oakeshott's view that civility is at once a "moral" condition and a "language." Yet even here, he might well have called it a limiting case of both that has features present in neither. Civility shares with all morality a dedication to noninstrumental rules for their own sake, out of an inner sense of obligation. It shares with all language the intelligent recognition of rule-like conditions of social intercourse for which moral approval is irrelevant. It differs from both morality and language in being at its core not merely rule-like conditions but actual rules with a designated locus of authority and publicly recognized procedures by which this authority can change the rules. Thus, though one cannot by concerted action authori- tatively change the Ten Commandments or the sentence structure of English, one can through politics change the basis of civil association, even while acknowledging a moral obligation to follow currently existing civil rules. A simple idea but, because of the lack of common sense analogies, a difficult one to keep in mind. Small wonder that one is habitually led to render it anthropomorphically by seeing the idea of civility as necessarily embodied in a sovereign, who is an identifiable person at the head of an independent executive apparatus. This habit tempts one to criticize Oakeshott for having underdefined the nature of civil association: by annexing all executive power to adjudication he has seemingly ignored the hard empirical fact that no modern state exists without a head of state and an executive establishment to monopolize certain administrative and policing functions. To which Oakeshott's response is that no modern state is purely a civil association. To be so would, as he earlier said of the pure calling of the philosopher, be "something more or less than human." Yet some states</page><page sequence="25">Auspitz / INDIVIDUALITY, CIVILITY, THEORY [285] have more of a genuinely civil character than others. The Soviet Union, Oakeshott says, is run by "private enterprise usurpers,"22 who view the entire government as a gigantic capitalist corporation. In other modem states, which have "free enterprise," law is regularly used as an instrument to punish or discomfit opponents of the regime which happens to be in power. Still other states, most of them liberal democracies, partake, in their several ways, more of the forms of genuine civility. Certainly, Oakeshott is correct that except for the threat of war a state would not in principle need an independent executive apparatus to maintain the rule of (noninstrumental) law. A sufficient policing establishment could be annexed to the judicial function, and it need not itself maintain a monopoly or even a preponderance of force, but only that standing force which is pragmatically required. Insofar as there is a doctrinal thrust to Oakeshott's definition, it is the belief in the examined life inherent in all philosophy. Oakeshott creates a presumption on philosophical grounds against any unexamined accretion of executive power for reasons short of the survival of civil order. The manifold welfare, managerial, regulatory, and productive functions that have accrued to the modern state may be defended on many prudential grounds (and one might even argue, on Oakeshott's own terms, that the "inner morality" of the law requires certain levels of education and security to give citizens the effective ability to exercise their formal civil equality). But to see these arguments as logically indispensable to the idea of free government and the rule of law is, Oakeshott shows, a superstition. A converse conclusion follows: it is an equal superstition to insist on allowing proceduralism to dominate the ethos of an enterprise. The sine qua non of business corporations, universities, or clubs is not their rules but their substantive purposes. To justify proceduralism, one may cite prudential reasons, the "inner morality" of the enterprise, or the need to protect the civil rights of citizens against corporate encroachment. But to allow considerations of procedure to preempt those purposes that are the agreed basis of enterprise association is not a sign of superior fairness but of the lack of courage to make substantive judgments. Finally, it is important to remember that the idea of civil association does not require a sense of community or social solidarity. The only shared value necessary to a rudimentary civility is an inner sense of obligation to the law. No other shared experiences are needed, not a common tongue, religion, mores, customs, national purpose, or character. (Hence Mark Twain's apt remark that he could discern no shared national characteristic of Americans, save perhaps a fondness for ice water with</page><page sequence="26">[286] POLITICAL THEORY /AUGUST 1976 dinner.) Again, one could amplify Oakeshott's view by suggesting that the "inner morality" of civility may be extended to include a civic culture and some reverence for its tangible symbols: the flag, the ballot box, the judge's black robes. But his starkly stated point remains defensible. The minimal shared allegiance necessary to civil association is the allegiance to the law, and the only civic culture it requires is an understanding of civil law as different from an executive order, a punitive device, a threat, or an unalterable commandment. Since judicial proceedings require binding oaths, one could add that civic culture presupposes moral habits of telling the truth and keeping promises, though Oakeshott remains correct in assuming that the necessary civil beliefs need not all come from the same moral or religious source and hence need not be based on any extraneous sense of community. That Oakeshott entertains some animosity to the idea of community is evident in his magisterial concluding essay. Here he holds that any view of the state as the vehicle for the recovery of a lost and presumably medieval sense of communal solidarity is a "relic of servility of which it is proper for European peoples to be profoundly ashamed."23 Disdaining to elevate the notion of communitas to political standing, he discusses the antinomies of European political thought only in terms of the two juridical analogies of societas and universitas. His approach recalls Maitland's concluding words in his examination of two coextensive concepts in Township and Borough (1898): "to unravel those strands of corporateness and commonness which are twined in the medieval communitas." Yet without Maitland's tertium quid, Oakeshott's brilliantly written enlargement upon this theme slights the genuinely sociological insights in several of the thinkers he discusses and leads to some strained readings, particularly in French thought and at greatest length in the case of Montesquieu, whom he holds to have portrayed the ancient republic in the image of a universitas, in contrast to the image of societas, which Oakeshott persuasively interprets as underlying Montesquieu's view of monarchy. Montesquieu's view of the Roman republic might instead be taken to suggest that small size, religious unanimity, and reverence for the law combined to give republics a principle of "vertu" that embodied the sense of legal obligation of societas without a diminution of the tribal vigor of communitas or the corporate military purpose of a universitas. As the Roman republic became imperial it "declined," that is, this fortuitous combination was attenuated. Montesquieu's ancient republic might, then, be viewed as an intertwining of the three elements, as a less differentiated form than European monarchy rather than as a parallel mode of association alternative to it.</page><page sequence="27">Auspitz / INDIVIDUALITY, CIVILITY, THEORY [287] Any reservations about Oakeshott's readings of other writers do not, of course, tell us much about his own philosophical achievement. Negatively, its importance may be assessed by some of the consequences of his work for contemporary political thought: his reworking of the classical notion of praxis supersedes the central concept in the political philosophy of Hannah Arendt; his distinction between a practice and a process, his belief in plural, nonfalsifiable modes, and his reading of the political import of Hegel are thoroughly subversive of the work of Karl Popper; his view of justice as civility presents a rigorous alternative to John Rawls' theory of "justice as fairness," in terms that require a reformulation of Rawl's own position; his elucidation of the rule of law as an ideal character, independent of the conditions that gave rise to its emergence, undermines a variety of enterprises in sociological jurisprudence and legal realism; his distinction between purposive and procedural modes is destructive of much (but by no means all) socialist thought; his view of different concepts of freedom appropriate to civil and enterprise association provides a supple alternative to the crude bifurcation of liberty into "positive" and "negative" varieties; his interpretation of the growth of individuality and civility in the past seven centuries of European thought challenges those who portray these ideals as uniquely associated with bourgeois liberalism; his critique of Rationalism, as it appeared in its strongest form in Experience and Its Modes, remains a powerful rebuke to those social scientists, mathematical economists, decision theorists, and optimists who acquiesce in the popular superstition that there is practical advice to be deduced from their theories; his philosophical definitions of history, science, politics, and poetry stand as a humanist's rebuttal to those who would pursue civilized achievements not for their intrinsic worth but for their presumed "relevance" to something else; and to cut short what might be a much longer list, his definition of civility contains a truth of overriding importance to advocates of intemational law: namely, that the rule of law does not require a preponderance of police power, a large bureaucracy or an extraneous sense of solidarity-a circumstance which suggests the ironic possibility that Oakeshott may turn out to be the most incisive "theoretician" of such forms of transnational adjudication as may gain legitimacy. Yet a work of philosophy is not to be judged merely by the wreckage it leaves in its wake, but by its positive contribution. Though it is premature to assess Oakeshott's achievement until we have his historiographical essays in hand, it now takes less philosophical imagination than was previously required to see the main lines of his thought, to discern the passionate thread in his work, and to understand both the virtues of his</page><page sequence="28">[288] POLITICAL THEORY / AUGUST 1976 work and the grounds on which one may question it. Let me recapitulate and conclude with a brief statement of what, on the basis of the work now at hand, I take Oakeshott's achievement to be. VIII. Hobbes wrote that without a guiding passion the mind wanders and is lost. To which Oakeshott has added that without a guiding tradition or practice it will suffer the same fate. His own work joins the mastery of a difficult practice with trust in a noble passion. The practice is that of philosophy, which is the engagement of theorizing taken to its most radically skeptical lengths. The passion is a love of cultivated individuality, which carries with it an appreciation of civility and a devotion to history, the muse which makes individuality accessible to the theoretical under- standing. Philosophy and individuality may seem a mismatched pair. Philosophy is grey; life is green. Philosophy deals in generality; individuality is always evinced in particularity. To embrace critical philosophy is to reject life as incomplete; to love individuality is to accept what we are and may become. Yet Oakeshott has found within the tradition of philosophy a way to join these opposites, and he has reworked it with economy, elegance, and restraint. He has engaged in a project of negation through affirmation. By telling us what a mode of experience is, he reminds us of what it is not. In so doing he is able to be at once critical and constructive, to leave in ruins much conteinporary thought without having to be contentious. He sees that if he sets his terms with sufficient care there will be no experience whose uniqueness must in principle elude him: he will be able to preserve the intrinsic character of what he surveys in a way faithful to the philosopher's vision of wholeness in experience. He began his project early and with exceptionally bold strokes. Experience and Its Modes reads as if William of Occam had undertaken to redo Hegel. Oakeshott applied his razor so mercilessly that he found himself struggling with the anomalies that come from having insufficiently multiplied essences. He reached for a figurative statement, yet the beauty of his imagery was also a sign of the insufficiency of his discursive categories. At length he unpacked the notion of practice with which be began and qualified his earlier Platonism with a }1i measured and Aristotelian notion of graded levels of theoretical inquiry suitable to different subjects. With these improvements he has found the means to accomplish a large part of his philosophical project or, as he might put it, to extend his philosophical travels into new territory.</page><page sequence="29">Auspitz / INDIVIDUALITY, CIVILITY, THEORY [289] He still cannot be charged with having written too much, and since he is his own best abridgement. one can have little confidence in any attempt to make him more accessible than he makes himself. Yet it may be apparent even from the introductory account presented here that his work is of interest outside the long dwindling and beleaguered camp of the British Idealists, and that his triumph is more than a merely personal one. He has given us terms of discussion which, if we follow them, will not permit us to miss the inescapable individuality in human conduct. And he has used these same terms to provide, as he projected nearly 40 years ago, a '"philosophical jurisprudence" and a coherent statement on the nature of civility (the rule of noninstrumental law). Individuality and civility are both cultivated achievements that have been developed at great pain in the past seven centuries of Westem history. There is no guarantee that because they have come about they will be preserved. Certainly, it is wrong to think, as some crude readings of Hegel would have it, that the accomplishments of one age or civilization are automatically synthesized into another. Nothing in history is automatic. Civility, in particular, is a practice with no common-sense analog. It can be lost merely by not being kept in mind, by confusing legal reasoning either with sociological theorizing or with managerial calculation. By showing the civil condition to have a coherent ideal character Oakeshott has done as much as can be done to preserve it. His accomplishment reminds us that the absence of civility is not the sign of a superior "communitarianism" or virility but of an incapacity for a difficult mode of governance-an incapacity which may be explained in terms of conditions of human misery and deep-seated habits of lordship, vassalage, and king and ancestor worship, but not on that account to be admired or deferred to as the wave of the future. He has told us something also about the complementary relation of civility and individuality. Whereas his discussion of human conduct revolves around a Greek ideal, his discussion of politics employs the term lex as well as other resuscitated latinisms (cives, civitas, respublica). With these usages he seems to be reminding us that politics is the very opposite of an arena for the Homeric display of greatness and individuality; that it requires instead the kind of self-effacement thet Virgil saw as the great virtue of the founder of Rome. Only if the civil order puts formality ahead of individuality can individuals have equality before the law to pursue their own purposes without governmental interference or feudal restric- tion. If we wish to strive for a Greek ideal of excellence in our private practices, he seems to be saying, we had best cultivate in our public life an austere devotion to the rule of law.</page><page sequence="30">[2901 POLITICAL THEORY / AUGUST 1976 This is, at its heart, an imperial view, in which law is able to serve as a minimal formal language to unite diverse peoples and interests in a "watery fidelity" that assures civil peace and individual rights. Yet it is also a view that bears a striking family resemblance to Oakeshott's nonutilitarian conception of the calling of the philosopher. Oakeshott's work as a whole thus derives a certain aesthetic integrity from the kinship between the ruler and the philosopher. The ruler and the philosopher are both master-practitioners, the one within a system of laws, the other within a world of ideas. Yet their mastery does not permit domination. They are both victims rather than creators of their imperium. For both, the condition of the exercise of authoritative power is an extinction of personal preference. To hold sway absolutely and concretely, as they both feel driven to do, they must reconcile themselves to the irrelevance of their power to the commonly felt needs and aspirations of life. They must deal in pure form. They are thus blood brothers in the pursuit of activities which take no satisfaction in substantive outcomes. In much the same way that Oakeshott sets up the philosophical criterion as a denial of life, he constitutes the civil condition as a sphere which excludes dedication to any fixed policy or objective. Hence, though anthropomorphic language may facilitate understanding, there is no such thing as a human being who is a civil ruler or a critical philosopher full-time. There is only ruling and theorizing which one enters into as a practice. If there is any direct form of personal satisfaction which these two activities can provide it is a partial escape from the corrupting nature of human conduct itself. All conduct, Oakeshott tells us, involves delibera- tion and persuasion, and these are never the same. The deliberative considerations which induce us to adopt a course of action can never be identical with those by which we persuade others-and the more miscellaneous the audience the more compromising the persuasive art. Theorizing can escape from this corruption by being demonstrative-by carrying with it its own evidence of truth. A definitive philosophy goes further still, by asserting postulates which are so obvious as to require no demonstration to the reflective intelligence. The ruler enjoys a similar satisfaction when he is able to assert conditions which, because of the existence of legal obligation, carry with them the basis of their own authority. Yet whether in law or philosophy, the unchallenged character of the assertion is known in advance to be fleeting. A law once promulgated</page><page sequence="31">Auspitz / INDIVIDUALITY, CIVILITY, THEORY [291] becomes a target for political amendment and a basis for judicial interpretation. A philosophical condition, once stated, invites us to examine its own conditionality. Oakeshott's own discussion is, he recognizes, an "invitation to further interrogation." And perhaps the only compliment one can pay him is to acknowledge that to criticize him one will have to do so profoundly, not merely by differing with his sympathies but by questioning the notions of language, theorizing, modality, and intrinsic, ideal character on which his entire work rests. Oakeshott himself identifies two considerations thay may prompt one to depart from him on these grounds. Since his very first published writing (a 1927 pamphlet on Religion and the Moral Life)25 he has recognized religion as an almost poetic body of imagery, dramatic participation in which enables the believer to rise above the dissonances of conduct and the hollowness of the human condition. Politics has always seemed to him to offer an unsatisfactory substitute for such salvation. He reiterates this view in On Human Conduct, and he also accepts for the first time a truncated kind of theorizing (one might call it praxiological) that attempts to put the "moral and prudential lore" of practical activity in systematic form useful to the practitioner. Such theorem-making is not so misguided as to be called "Rationalist," but since it focuses only on serviceable truths, neither is it ultimately satisfactory as theorizing. Oakeshott's discussions of religion and practical theorem-making are brief, but they raise disquieting questions. To give a philosophical account of religious experience (an undertaking different from theology) would, on Oakeshott's own terms, seem to require some category for the unmediated, direct, mystical, loving, or revealed experience which permits the believer, whether or not he has personally experienced it, to assert his participation in an ordained universe. Yet Oakeshott has apparently ruled out such a category. He has, as we have seen, attributed to poetry whatever may be salvaged from the neo-Platonic ideal of comtemplative participation in a divine order. What is it, then, that differentiates the imagery of religion from that of poetry? And how do the differentia of religion jibe with Oakeshott's prosaic postulates of conduct (deliberation, persuasion, and the like)? A philosophical account of practical reflection (an undertaking different from praxiology) would, by contrast, seem more easily -accom- modated in Oakeshott's category of deliberation. But even here one would need to elaborate the distinction between a practice and a process to show how, for example, process-reasoning may be appropriate within a practice</page><page sequence="32">[292] POLITICAL THEORY / AUGUST 1976 like medicine. Further, much deliberation consists in conjecturing the extent to which contingent relations may be treated probabilistically; this suggests that the watertight disjunction between a practice and a process that Oakeshott takes as a postulate of conduct may lose its force in infonning deliberation within conduct. Are the postulates of religion and informed deliberation incompatible with those of conduct itself? If so, does this point to paradoxes inherent in the human predicament or to a flaw in Oakeshott's categories? How well, in sum, does Oakeshott accommodate those modes of thought that enable us to endure experience and to learn from it? To dwell on such questions is not my task here. Instead, there has fallen to me the happy duty of paying tribute to On Human Conduct as part of a remarkably careful, compelling, and coherent body of work, ranging from a treatise in first philosophy to discussions, some inchoate, some well developed, of poetry, jurisprudence, politics, education, science, history, religion, morality, and the calling of philosophy itself. When one comes upon an accomplishment of this kind, unusual in our century and in our language, one's first and best instinct is to be grateful for it, then to learn from it, and only afterwards to deal with its limitations. Oakeshott has in any case developed his own points with sufficient precision that one would want to take account of them in any view which claimed to supersede what he calls his "small composition of related ideas." He has, indeed, provided a compact philosophical account of a culture which, however we may label it, is inescapably our own. Were he less the philosopher, he might be characterized as the great apologist for the genius of British politics in the period of Britain's decline. Yet by tracing this genius not to contingent notions of racial instinct, organic growth, utilitarian calculation, or imperial success, but to a coherent ideal character, he has raised the practice of civility beyond any putative association with Anglo-Saxon institutions or with the "English-speaking peoples." Oakeshott has shown civility to be a language in its own right, an urbane practice which can be imparted and learned and which, moreover, is inextricably related to the grand traditions of Western humanism. In the philosophy of politics, his technical achievement is to have drawn upon the categories of German Idealism to elucidate and vindicate the minimal postulates of British Liberalism. His contribution to our self-understanding is not less striking: he has developed a philosophical definition of culture itself as the unfolding of human self-determination through the medium of "languages"-each language a differentiated practice with an integrity, tradition, and inner morality of its own; each sharing with all the others a</page><page sequence="33">Auspitz / INDIVIDUALITY, CIVILITY, THEORY [293] recognition of general moral conditions, of meaningful choice, and of the critical and unifying role of human intelligence. If, then, we wish to preserve what is best in our civilization, we shall not lightly depart from Oakeshott's categories. For an impulse at once conservative and liberating is satisfied in them. Both theorizing and ruling, as he portrays them, enable us to hold on to what we have, to see clearly the individuality that is our birthright and to cultivate it in civil peace. In this way we can enjoy a disposition to be self-employed, in which a man recognizes himself and all others in terms of self-determination; that is, in terms of . .. adventures rather than uncertain outcomes. This is a disposition to prefer the road to the inn, ambulatory conversation to deliberation about means for achieving ends, the rules of the road to directions about how to reach a destination, and to recognize that The road runs always to the Sea 'Twixt duty and delight. And since men are apt to make gods whose characters reflect what they believe to be their own, the deity corresponding to this self-understanding is an Aygustinian god of majestic imagination, who when he might have devised an untroublesome universe, had the nerve to create one composed of self-employed adventurers of unpredictable fancy and thus to acquire convives capable of "answering back" in civil tones with whom to pass an eternity in conversation. 26 NOTES 1.
