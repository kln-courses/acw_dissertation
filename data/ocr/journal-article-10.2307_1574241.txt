<plain_text><page sequence="1">World'. 'Fourth World is the collective name for all aboriginal or native peoples whose lands fall within the national boundaries and technobureaucratic administrations of the countries of the First, Second, and Third Worlds.' 'Fourth World' problems are presented statistically and systematically. Simultaneously, the general reader is offered much information in a lucid, jargon-less style. The book covers North American (Eskimo Art, Haida argillite carvings, Southwest Indian arts, Pueblo and Navajo weaving traditions, Laguna ceramics and acculturation); Mexico and Central America (Seri ironwood carving, Teotihuacan Valley ceramics, Xalitla amate bark-paper paintings); South America (clothing arts of the Cuna of San Blas (Panama); gourd decoration in highland Peru; Shipibo tourist art); Asia (contemporary Ainu wood and stone carving; paintings from Nathdwara, Rajasthan, India); Oceania (style change in an Upper Sepik contact situation; Australian aboriginal art at Yirrkala; native art and craft objects in contemporary New Zealand); Africa (changing African art; ebony carving in Benin; decline of Lega sculptural art; functional and tourist art along the Okavango River). There are no references to 'Fourth World' arts of Japan, China and the Middle East. The articles in the book are mainly by specialists who have carried out field studies. Overall, a picture emerges of changes in the 'Fourth World' in the direction of the extinction of the traditional arts. The book offers not only descriptions of the folk arts in different parts of the world, but also a rather fascinating attempt to delineate the ethno-aesthetic context involved in the process. Thus, it is of interest not only to artists, art historians and critics but also to anthropologists. Incidentally, each section has an Introduction, and each chapter ends with conclusions and/or a summary. Geographical, historical and ethnographic backgrounds are provided. The editor is fully conversant with this subject, which is amply demonstrated by the content of his Introductions. At the end of the book, there is a bibliography and an index. Nine maps are provided and there are 114 illustrations in black and white and eight in colour. Far from being a mere 'coffee-table' book, as so many of this genre are, it is not only informative but, I found, thought provoking. Russian Modernism: Culture and the Avant-Garde, 1900-1930. George Gibian and H. W. Tjalsma, eds. Cornell Univ. Press, Ithaca, New York and London, 1976. 239 pp. ?10.05. Reviewed by Alan C. Birnholz* The nine essays in this book originated from a conference on Russian 'modernism' held at Cornell University in 1971. Again and again, the contributors and editors point out that to understand Russian 'modernism' requires going beyond in- dividual means of artistic expression and concentrating on how much there was in common among writers, poets, painters and architects. Yet, typical of the unevenness of this book, most of the articles only pay lip service to this requirement. The contributors deal with rather narrow subjects (mostly literature) and treat them largely within the confines of 'modernist' poetry, 'modernist' architecture, and so on. It is the reader who must build on the fine Introduction by Gibian and Tjalsma to discern some of the threads holding the Russian 'modernist' movement together. What do these essays tell us? Patricia Carden emphasizes that 'modernism tended to draw the arts closer together in their development. Nowhere was this truer than in Russia, where artists and poets not only were allied in the same groups but were often even the very same people' (p. 59). Wladimir Weidle, Ren6 Wellek and S. Frederick Starr devote much of their essays to proving that Russian 'modernism' was hardly a monolithic movement. These essays discuss, as any study of Russian art must, the connection between Russian art and political life. One other important point, often ignored because of non-Russian preconceptions about the objectivity and 'modernity' of these *Dept. of Art History, State University of New York, Buffalo, NY 14261, U.S.A. artists, is the strong link between them and the tradition of mysticism in Russia. This link is examined insightfully by George Ivask in Russian Modernist Poets and the Mystic Sectarians. Ivask connects, for example, their interest in zaum (transrational or metalogical language) and the mystics' own tradition of glossolalia or speaking in tongues. As one would expect in any collection of essays, the quality of remarks is far from uniform. Of particular value to readers of Leonardo is John Bowlt's thorough study of the Union of Youth Group and Starr's equally competent discussion of OSA (Union of Contemporary Architects) and the artistic-political situation during the 1920s. Less impressive is Patricia Carden's Ornamentalism and Modernism. This essay is marred by the author's tendency to make the kind of observations that sound right during a lecture but look suspect on the printed page. For example, her statement that 'ornamentalism is the expression of modernism in Russian literature' (p. 52) strikes me as too black- and-white. Carden sees the demise of the 'modernist' movement in Russian literature in similarly stark terms. 'The disappearance of ornamentalism from Russian prose was the sign that mediocrity had triumphed' (p. 64). The proclamation of Socialist Realism 'led to the suppression of all the important fruits of the modern movement in the arts' (p. 64). I agree that after the downfall of Russian 'modernism' there was much mediocrity and much suppression, but I am skeptical about Carden's assertion that the triumph of mediocrity was complete and that 'all' of the fruits of 'modernism' were suppressed. There are two other problems with this book. Despite Bowlt's and Starr's attention to painting and sculpture, there are no illustrations of the works they discuss. Despite the five-year gap between the time of the conference and the date of publication there are few indications that these essays were up-dated to keep abreast of the latest research on Russian contemporary art. The result is an uneven book, one that increases my enthusiasm for a truly all-encompassing study of the 'modernist' movement in Russia. Russian and Soviet Painting. Dmitrii Vladimirovich Sarabianov. Trans. by John E. Bowlt. Rizzoli, New York, 1977. 165 pp., illus. $25.00. Reviewed by S. Frederick Starr** The exhibition of Russian and Soviet painting at the New York Metropolitan Museum of Art has come and gone. Thanks to the inclusion in it of such trivial items as Y. A. Pokhadaev's 'First Rendezvous, "Soyuz" and "Apollo"', the disappointing selec- tion of works in it of early 20th-century innovators, its whitewash of the impact of Stalinism on art and its neglect of contemporary innovators, the exhibition was roundly criticized. At a time when further evidence was scarcely needed, it provided new proof that the evils arising from the treatment of art as a political commodity are no less pernicious than those arising from its treatment as an economic commodity. Now that the shortcomings of the exhibition have often been pointed out, it may be well to take note of some of its strengths, for they were not lacking. Fortunately, they are amply recorded in this book, which was prepared and sold as a catalogue. First, the several splendid works by the 18th-century portraitists F. S. Rokotov, D. G. Levitsky and A. P. Antropov speak eloquently to the rapid mastery by Russians of the most advanced techniques of that era. The same case might have been made in landscape painting, had Shchedrin been represented in the selection. The speed and thoroughness of this transformation of Russia's visual heritage two centuries ago must give pause to anyone who thinks that breakthroughs might not occur today. Second, and more important, the consultants elected to give rather strong emphasis to the neglected figurative art that coexisted with the nonfigurative art of the 1920s. Deineka or Pimenov may not be the equal of the Central European expressionists from whom they took their cues, but they are important painters nonetheless. The selections from their works are excellent, as is the discussion of the OST group in the **Kennan Institute for Advanced Russian Studies, The Wilson Center, Smithsonian Institution Bldg., Washington, DC 20560, U.S.A. 254 Books</page><page sequence="2">typography he also used. He was particularly attracted by photographs as reproduced in newspapers and magazines, wherein the medium of ink on paper had transformed them not only visually but also in terms of their socio-historical function; they served as convenient references to the realities that the artist ridiculed, satirized and, ultimately, tried to transform. Each photographic reproduction that Hausmann incorporated into a dadaist photomontage supplied a whole set of references to the print and communication media as well. Much more than mere historical or cultural artifacts, such images were further modified in their meanings by new arrangements, new juxtaposi- tions and contexts. With reproductions of photographs, the dadaists also were able to question traditional academic views of visual art through this machine imagery (camera images altered by the printing press). For anyone who has studied the Dada movement, of course, this is more or less familiar ground. While this book includes illustrations of Hausmann's famous dadaist photomontages, more importantly it offers examples of the artist's own photographs. He was careful to call his photographs 'research' rather than finished art, but un- questionably many of these pictures are remarkable, self- sufficient works of art. The 'straight' photographs of found objects are perhaps the least inspired, but there are also handsome motion studies, explorations of the play of light and shadow, visual effects, photomontages made with his own photographs, cameraless 'photograms' and various other examples of delightful but disciplined uses of photographic techniques and materials. The work is generally reminiscent of Laszlo Moholy-Nagy's photographs during the same period, the 1930s and 1940s, but it stands on its own. This work should force a re-evaluation of the major influences in photographic 'experimentation' during this fertile period. The book is divided into three sections: Festival Dada (1918-1923); Transformations photographiques (1924-1939) and Matiere-Collage (1940-1971), each section being equipped with a separate chronology and with statements and articles by Hausmann. Most of the second section deals with 'straight' or unmanipulated photographs, such as a fine study of the play of light on beer suds in a glass in Hausmann's own self-portrait, but several photomontages of the 1930s are included. At points, his later work, seen in the third section, is introspective and retrospective, as in a 1957 photograph involving super- impositions of his own well-known sculptural assemblage of 1919, the 'T&amp;e mecanique'. The book is a well-organized, definitive and useful sourcebook on Hausmann's use of and attitudes toward photography. It clearly indicates that his later and lesser-known work deserves critical attention, not only by historians of photography, but by historians of 20th-century visual art in general. Vadim Sidur. Karl Eimermacher. (In German) Universitatsverlag, Constance, Ger. Fed. Rep. 1978. 168 pp., illus. DM 39.80. Reviewed by John E. Bowlt This is the second monograph on the Soviet artist Vadimir Sidur (b. 1924), one of the more interesting sculptors and book illustrators working in Moscow today. The first monograph (S. Grishin, Vadim Sidur, Adelaide, 1972) introduced the artist's work to Western readers; but this new book examines the sculpture and graphics in more detail, provides a comprehensive bibliography, a biographical scheme and a list of illustrated books. Eimermacher presents a serious appraisal of Sidur's artistic career from the early works of the 1950s to the provocative 'found art' of the 1970s. The author places Sidur within the general context of Soviet culture, arguing, convinc- ingly, that Sidur represents a new Realism in Soviet sculpture after the outmoded canon of Socialist Realism. Eimermacher is careful, however, not to classify Sidur either as 'dissident' or as sympathizer of the 'establishment', and implies that such categories have little to do with the real meaning and worth of Sidur's art. Sidur's latest endeavors, i.e. the specimens of 'found art', take introductory essays by J. E. Bowit and by D. V. Sarabianov. Had it been possible to include a few major works of Socialist Realists of the early and mid-1930s, the significance of the two post- revolutionary decades might have been even more apparent. Even without this, the exhibition succeeds in making a very important point: until the dominant current of representational art in Russia from 1700 to the 1950s is fully analyzed and understood, it will be quite impossible to appreciate correctly the place of rival tendencies in the overall development. Brancusi/The Kiss. Sidney Geist. Harper &amp; Row, New York. 1978. 111 pp., illus. Paper ?3.95. Reviewed by Eugen Ciuca* In the first chapter of this book, entitled Theme, the author analyzes in much detail Brancusi's first version of 'The Kiss' (1907), as regards both the sculpture's artistic qualities and its method of execution. He says: 'for, surely, one of the revelations of "The Kiss" was the necessity of direct carving as a way both of working and thinking' (p. 9). His short discussion of direct carving is, perhaps, useful for students, but they should be warned that he is wrong when he calls it 'primitivistic carving' on the basis of the sculptures made by painters such as Gauguin and Derain. Brancusi's direct carving is not similar to that of these painters. He recognizes Brancusi's artistic talent, when he says: "'The Kiss"... is a work of sheer art' (p. 12). But he concludes his first chapter with doubts about Brancusi's originality by using terms such as 'very like' (p. 16), 'surprisingly similar' (p. 18), 'influenced by' (p. 19) and 'directly indebted' (p. 37)'. On page 40 he says: 'The factors that seem most directly to have contributed to the creation of Brancusi's "The Kiss" are three: Derain's exhibition; Matisse's paintings; and the meetings with Morice.' From this I would be led to conclude that Brancusi was not very talented as a sculptor of originality. The second chapter, entitled Variations, is devoted to a didactic analysis of the visual characteristics of the variations of 'The Kiss' that Brancusi made between 1908 and 1945, the last entitled 'Boundary Marker'. Geist makes assertions about these works that I find highly tendentious. For example, he writes: 'Brancusi's invention is only a slight variation of a type of pilaster or decorative panel which exists since the Renaissance' (p. 57). 'Essentially, Brancusi has altered the Renaissance design by introducing the deep vertical channel' (p. 58). But Geist does not understand that Brancusi was interested in figurative fine art, not in decorative art. The third chapter, entitled In Time, consists of a general commentary and of conclusions drawn by Geist from the analyses presented in the first two chapters. It left me, as a sculptor, convinced that he understood very little about Brancusi's variations of 'The Kiss'. Raoul Hausmann: Je ne suis pas un photographe. (In French) Michel Giroud, ed. Editions du Chene, Paris, 1975. 160 pp., illus. Reviewed by David Haberstich** This book, a tribute to Raoul Hausmann, unequestionably one of the pre-eminent Dada luminaries, is also a provocative document about the role of photographic imagery in visual art. The paradoxical sub-title is explained early in the Avertissement; as if one had not already guessed, the reason Hausmann did not consider himself a photographer was that he never sought to reproduce that which he saw but preferred to 'enlarge and transform vision' through photographic techniques. One might have quibbled with him (and doubtlessly certain photographer/ artists did) that it is, indeed, within the purview of any sensitive photographer to 'enlarge and transform vision', not simply to record or to duplicate reality. Initially, to be sure, he in his Dada 'salad' days was not a photographer at all, because he employed the photographs of others in his photomontages. Photographs and photographic reproductions were raw material, like the *21 Shore Lane, Bay Shore, NY 11706, U.S.A. **Div. of Photographic History, National Museum of History and Technology, Smithsonian Institution, Washington, DC 20560, U.S.A. various anthropomorphic forms in conglomerations of ma- tDept of Slavic Languages, University of Texas, Box 7217, Austin, TX 78712, U.S.A.
