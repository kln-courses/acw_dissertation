<plain_text> <page sequence="1"> ———————— Imperial and Colonial Sublime: The Aesthetics of Infrastructures ———————— II: Imperial and Colonial Sublime: The Aesthetics of  Infrastructures   For travelers like Chavchavadze in the 1860s, still indebted to Romantic  aesthetics of his interlocutors, the political antinomies of the geopoet- ics of the Dariel crossing through the Caucasus are figured primarily by  natural features of the sublime landscape, Mount Kazbek and the Terek  River (a Romantic discourse which I have called an “Aesopian discourse  of nature”). By contrast, staunchly “realist” writers and ethnographers  about the same region in the 1880s would have no patience for the  hybrid, personified allegorical natural landscape of Romanticism; for  these writers, the reality of the Russian state is always figured first and  foremost by a cultural feature of the landscape, the Georgian military  road, the single connection between the Russian Empire and Georgia  through these mountains.1 The aesthetic generational sea change from  Romanticism to realism in this period can be summarized by the way  natural features of the landscape (Mount Kazbek, the Terek River) cede  their pride of place to cultural features of the landscape (the Russian  road) in Georgian writings about the Dariel crossing. At the same time,  we move from a veiled Aesopian critique of politics through the aes- thetics of nature to a much more direct, unveiled critique of Russian  imperial politics through the aesthetics of its hitherto invisible taken- for-granted infrastructure. Because of the Russian road passing through it, the region of Xevi  differs from other mountain regions in that it is not isolated either from  the Russian state or the eyes of passing members of Georgian reading  society. Being the only major passage between Russia and Georgia, it  can be assumed that most members of the Georgian public will have  encountered it at least once.2 The paradox of Xevi is that it is the moun- tainous region that members of educated society will have the greatest  firsthand familiarity with, and yet the greatest factual ignorance of, as  Moxevian writer Aleksandre Qazbegi points out at the beginning of his  ethnography of the region: — 59 — </page> <page sequence="2"> ——————————————————— CHAPTER TWO ——————————————————— From every district of our country voices come and are  printed in newspapers; every district is involved in our  common life and is keeping us informed of its happiness  and distress. Only one small part of our country, called  ‘Xevi’, is missing from the harmony of this common life.  It is indeed true, that from every corner comes correspon- dence after correspondence, article after article is printed,  but about ‘Xevi’ you might see somewhere two lines or so  written, because who cares about Xevi? Who knows about  them, or to whom are they interesting, that they bother  themselves for their sake? We are so unaware of the peo- ple who live in Xevi and their situation, that the greater  part of reading society thinks that Xevi is part of Ossetia  and its inhabitants are Ossetians. Such ignorance is very  surprising about our Moxevians, who are pure Georgians  and know no other language than Georgian, even though  they are surrounded by people of other tribes.  This circumstance is all the more surprising, because  Xevi is located by virtue of its own situation in such a  place, where a great military road, which unites our land  to the whole of Russia, goes straight through the middle  of villages and therefore there hardly remains such a  man who knows how to read and write, who, at least  once, would not have passed through these places. . . .  They have gone through, come back through yet again,  Moxevians have many times taken different travelers  back and forth in the mountains in the harsh winter, but  these [travelers] quickly forgot the service and the help  received from those in the mountains.3 Unlike more distant Georgian mountain regions like Svaneti and  Xevsureti, the hand of the Russian state is omnipresent in Xevi. The his- torical experience, therefore, of the state is quite different viewed from  Xevi than it is from elsewhere in the Georgian Caucasus. So far from  being the sublime wilderness so oft-described by Romantic travelers,  the landscape of the crossing is a “second nature,” a nature completely  transformed at the hands of the Russian state:  — 60 — </page> <page sequence="3"> ———————— Imperial and Colonial Sublime: The Aesthetics of Infrastructures ———————— Whoever has gone or come through Xevi has without a  doubt noticed these barren, skin and bone mountains,  which tower in their immensity and are almost lost in  the spaces of the sky. The greater part of these places  once were covered with beautiful trees, giving Mox- evians sufficient resources in life; but, ravaged by the  boundless logging by the people and cut down for stra- tegic reasons, they are now completely destroyed and  instead of beautiful dense forests there remains only  naked mountains.4 In Xevi, therefore, we find a privileged place to engage with the Rus- sian state, both in terms of the cultural order of infrastructure, but also  the way this order has transformed the indigenous cultural and natural  order to become part of this infrastructure. On the Road, Again: The Critical Aesthetics of Infrastructure Romantic descriptions of the Dariel pass present an image of sublime  nature, dominated by the Terek River, which serves as a natural figure for  indigenous resistance. Against such a worthy sublime natural adversary,  the victory of the cultural order of the Russian imperial mission can be  figured as being equally sublime. By contrast, in “realist” period descrip- tions the cultural order, specifically the Russian military highway, is the  dominant figure; the natural landscape is a “second nature” produced  by strategic deforestation, in essence an extension of the infrastructure  of the road itself. As the natural landscape has been transformed, so is  the social landscape; while other Georgian mountaineer groups like the  nearby Xevsurs tolerate occasional incursions of armed officials of the  Russian state, the Moxevian social order has long since been completely  transformed by Russian colonialism. Like most mountaineers, lacking  any native aristocracy to speak of, Moxevians are alone of Georgian  groups of their area in having a local lineage of Russian-appointed ser- vice nobles, the Qazbegi family, Aleksandre Qazbegi’s own family (Le  Galcher Baron 1993), and the (Ossetian and Georgian) peasants who  live along the road have been drafted into innumerable forms of corvee  labor associated with it, including serving as yamshchiks carrying post  and travelers for hire along the road. — 61 — </page> <page sequence="4"> ——————————————————— CHAPTER TWO ——————————————————— In Romantic descriptions, including to some extent that of Chavcha- vadze, the road is an often invisible infrastructural position from which  the sublime natural landscape can be surveyed, but for the Moxevians  and for the aesthetics of realist authors, the material reality of the  Russian state and their own predicament is always figured first and  foremost by the road itself. The Georgian military road, the construc- tion of which was begun by General Ermolov at the behest of the tsar  in the wake of their Russian annexation of Georgia in 1801, was only  nominally finished in 1817. However, work continued on the road until  1863, at which point the bill stood at a staggering sum of four million  pounds (in that period), the resulting road (at a period when such roads  were otherwise nonexistent elsewhere in Russia and the Transcaucasus  alike) was compared to the Simplon road in the Alps. The construction  and maintenance of the strategically vital post road and attendant com- munications presented unique problems to the Russian imperial postal  network (Bazilevich 1999[1927], 84–6), since it required not merely the  building of infrastructure of the road and bridges and numerous postal  stations, but also the pacification of the countryside (including stra- tegic deforestation) and military garrisons. Travel over this road took  days with military escort (including cannons) in the period of Pushkin  (1829). Travelers in this period often made use of the “opportunity”  afforded by the military escort provided to the mail and joined their  carriages to the mail convoy (Bazilevich 1999[1927], 86). By the time  of Lermontov, however, the passage was (1840) already becoming a  trivial affair, the technological improvements in the road and the mili- tary pacification of the countryside turning the passage through Dariel  from a sublime crossing into an utterly prosaic one. As if to illustrate the  aesthetic changes in the natural landscape wrought by infrastructural  improvement, in the first paragraph of the first chapter of A Hero of Our  Time (1840), Lermontov has his narrator lose his travel notes about the  crossing (Lermontov 1983 [1840], 5). This fortunate misfortune allows  him to dispense with “descriptions of mountains, meaningless excla- mations of rapture, depictions of scenery which convey nothing, and  statistics which no one would ever read,” noting merely that he “lunched  at Kazbek, had tea at Lars, and was in Vladikavkaz in time for dinner.” British Georgianist Oliver Wardrop, in his account of the road in  1888, notes both the role of natural actors (the rivers which carved  the passage the road would follow through the mountains) and state  — 62 — </page> <page sequence="5"> ———————— Imperial and Colonial Sublime: The Aesthetics of Infrastructures ———————— actors in producing the Georgian military road (Wardrop 1888, 34–6).  Indeed Wardrop goes so far as to suggest that if Lermontov could dis- pense with a lengthy description of the Dariel passage, this was not  merely a sign that the passage had become an utterly hackneyed liter- ary trope, but that the passage itself had, by his time, become entirely  unremarkable: The part which rivers have played in the history of  civilization is well illustrated by this road. The Aragva,  flowing southward from Grudaur [sic, Gudauri], and  the Terek, running northward from it, have formed the  highway along which countless crowds of Asiatics have  penetrated into Europe. Between the two streams, there  is a distance of some ten miles, forming a huge but not  insurmountable barrier, the virtual removal of which  did not take place until our own times. It was General  Yermolov who, in 1824, succeeded in making the road  practicable for troops of all kinds; but from the poet  Puskhin’s “Journey to Erzerum” (1829), we learn that  there was still room for improvement. The traveler had  to go with a convoy of 500 soldiers and a cannon, he dare  not lag behind for fear of the mountaineers, provisions  and lodgings were scarce and bad, the roads were impass- able for carriages, the rate of speed was sometimes only  ten miles a day. When we read Pushkin’s account, and  the one given by Lermontov, in “A Hero of Our Times,”  we can only ask ourselves, “What was the road like be- fore Yermolov?”  During the wars with Kasi-mullah and Shamil, it be- came indispensable to effect great improvements, and, at  length, about five-and-twenty years ago, under the gov- ernorship of Prince Bariatinskii, the road was finished,  and is now one of the finest in the world, besides being  one of the highest—the Simplon is only 6147 feet above  sea-level, while the Dariel road is nearly 2000 feet higher.  The total distance from Tiflis to Vladikavkaz is 126 miles,  and the distance can be done comfortably in less than  twenty hours. During the summer 1150 horses are kept  — 63 — </page> <page sequence="6"> ——————————————————— CHAPTER TWO ——————————————————— in readiness at the stations, in the winter the number  is reduced by about 300. Two stage coaches start from  each end every day, but as they run during the night also,  much of the beauty of the scenery is lost by those who  avail themselves of this mode of conveyance; besides, it  is difficult to get an outside seat unless you book it a long  time in advance. It is far better to travel by troika, as you  are then free to stop when you like and as long as you  like, and you get an uninterrupted view of the country  through which you pass. (Wardrop 1888, 34–6)  By the time of Lermontov (1840) and certainly by the time of  Chavchavadze, the road and attendant infrastructure (such as post sta- tions) has become almost invisible (on the invisibility of infrastructure,  see Star 1999, Robbins 2007, Larkin 2008, 245). The Russian road longer  battles with the Terek River as it did in the Romantic days of Griboye- dov and Pushkin.5 After the pacification of the mountaineers, too, this  military road is presented as being part of an essentially economic sphere  of circulation. Chavchavadze’s travel letters made some references to  the economic predicaments of the Moxevian, and here the road is intro- duced as a possible solution to the economic hardship of the Moxevians  (and the Armenian shopkeeper the source of impoverishment, illustrat- ing once again Chavchavadze’s noted Armenophobia). Ghunia explains  to Chavchavadze the predicament represented by the road:  ‘This big road will give you help.’ ‘What difference does a road make! It’s only of use  to him who has things bought or made himself to carry  and sell.’ ‘Then you do not hire yourself out?’ ‘Why would we not? Of course we do.’ ‘Then you get money from hire.’ ‘We get it. It doesn’t stay in the pocket, though; a  Moxevian mountaineer is the prey of the Armenian.  There’s no food and drink in the house; what we earn  goes to the dukan. (VI) But Chavchavadze’s brief account of the economic role of the road  — 64 — </page> <page sequence="7"> ———————— Imperial and Colonial Sublime: The Aesthetics of Infrastructures ———————— in the impoverishment of those who dwelt by it was itself subject to  revision in the realist writings of the 1880s. In a striking reprise of  Chavchavadze’s journey through Xevi in his Letters of a Traveler, Alek- sandre Qazbegi (1880) invites us to follow a Moxevian peasant like Lelt  Ghunia, who works by hire on the road, on a peasant’s eye view of the  same journey found in Chavchavadze’s Letters of a Traveler. Like the road  itself, the region of Xevi and the Moxevians themselves represent so  much taken-for-granted, seen-but-unnoticed aspects of the landscape  of the crossing that they have been, in a sense, like the road itself, rel- egated to the presupposed and invisible category of infrastructure (Star  1999). An important difference between the accounts is that Qazbegi  shows us that economic poverty occurs at the hands of state agents, and  not economic agents like the Armenians. Whoever looks at these places instantly notices, that  there the land must not be rich with various plants and  the inhabitants cannot only survive with only ploughing  and sowing: therefore they must find some other means  to keep themselves. Among other things, one of the  means is to go between Vladikavkaz and Tbilisi for hire.  Of course, this work, as a means for life, is a great  mercy of god for Moxevians; but if you knew how many  disasters accompany this labor you would be amazed, as  to how in the world Moxevians go on hire and having  lost energy they don’t give up everything and banish  themselves somewhere?!!6 The problems faced by the Moxevian according to Qazbegi begin  before any money is actually made by hire, whereas for Chavchavadze’s  Lelt Ghunia, the problem is what happens to the money after it is made.  Seemingly a trivial point, but leading to very different objects of critique.  Whereas Chavchavadze turns on his favorite enemies, the Armenians,  Qazbegi covers the journey of the Moxevian to Tbilisi in some detail  (just as he would do later in his recollections of life as a shepherd, Qaz- begi was perhaps the only true Georgian narodnik, forsaking his family’s  tradition of service, he instead spent ten years of his life as a shepherd  [Le Galcher Baron 1993]), finding corrupt and coercive agents of the  Russian state, arbitrary imposts, fines and theft, in his way every step  — 65 — </page> <page sequence="8"> ——————————————————— CHAPTER TWO ——————————————————— along the way. The result is that not only do cart drivers not make any  money from the road in the first place, but they often even end up in  debt! This is a very different image from that depicted by Chavchavadze:  here the road enriches agents of the Russian state, not Armenian shop- keepers. And certainly, it follows that since the state is omnipresent in the  life of Xevi as well, an ethnographic picture of Xevi is impossible with- out the state, and indeed, an ethnography of Xevi is to a greater extent  than anywhere else in the same breath an ethnography of the state. The  intensity of contact between the Moxevians and the Russian state is  guaranteed by their strategic location along the Georgian military road,  not merely corruption of local Georgian go-betweens but also endless  requirements of corvee labor, requisitions, bribes, and billeting of sol- diers in the region, something not experienced, for example, in more  out-of-the-way regions. It stands to reason, therefore, that Qazbegi’s  ethnography of the Moxevians (1880) should dwell for seven chapters  on relations between the Moxevian peasant and the state, before he  turns in a few final chapters to matters of “everyday life” that might be  considered a few years later to be the province of “ethnography” proper.  A comparison with the nearly contemporary ethnographic writings  of mountain ethnographer Urbneli (a pseudonym of N. Xizanashvili  [1940]) writing about the neighboring Xevsurs is instructive: Urbneli  can concern himself almost exclusively with the indigenous forms of  polity and everyday life of the Xevsurs, because the Russian state is still  not the ubiquitous presence in everyday life there that it is in Xevi. Part of the reason for this was that the Georgian military road  infrastructure was a vital link in the Russian imperial postal network,  a system which not only carried the post, but provided essentially all  transportation and communication services (including passenger ser- vices and for most of the period, the telegraph as well) (Bazilevich 1999  [1927], Prigara 1981 [1941]). The corvee labor for Moxevian and Os- setian inhabitants of the Dariel region, for example, includes both road  maintenance, billeting of soldiers, but also postal-carrying duties along  this vital link in the Russian imperial postal network, explaining, per- haps, why as far south as Ardahan “Ossetian” is synonymous with “post  rider” (yamshchik, postal carriers usually working as part of obligated  service who could also carry passengers for a fee, as with Chavchavadze  above). Because their homes are along this vital road, the Ossetians  — 66 — </page> <page sequence="9"> ———————— Imperial and Colonial Sublime: The Aesthetics of Infrastructures ———————— (and the Moxevians) become subsumed as human parts of the Caucasus  postal infrastructure (for a discussion of the role of yamshchik in the  Russian imperial post and the forms of exploitation they were subjected  to, see Bazilevich 1999 [1927], 35–38; for the role of yamshchiki in pro- viding transport for passengers via the postal network, see Bazilevich  1999 [1927], 45–61).  “Life” and the Road: From Anthropomorphic Nature to  Anthropomophizing the State How very different does the journey from Vladikavkaz to Tbilisi look  when viewed not from the perspective of Chavchavadze but from the  perspective of someone like Lelt Ghunia. This “deromanticization”  and de-aestheticization of the journey, turning our attention from the  sublime landscape (which itself turns out to be a second nature created  through deforestation in tandem with the road) to the abject life of the  inhabitants, typifies Qazbegi’s writings, both his early ethnographies  and the later short stories and novels for which he is most famous, but  the critique of the colonial aesthetics of Dariel can be taken further. The  typical traveler in Xevi, from Griboyedov to Chavchavadze, treats the  landscape of Xevi as an aestheticized natural landscape, viewed from  the neutral, almost invisible position of the road. But what if we were  to turn this formulation on its head; what does the road look like when  viewed from the landscape? The mountain ethnographer Urbneli (N. Xizanashvili), known pri- marily for his ethnographic writings beginning in the 1880s about the  neighboring Pshavs and Xevsurs (collected in Xizanashvili 1940), him- self reprises the same literary aesthetic oppositions between Romanti- cism and realism in explicit form in a feuilleton of 1883 entitled “Notes  of a Traveler.” The aestheticized description of nature in Dariel, Urbneli  supposes, will be familiar to all readers, and he argues that this aestheti- cized view created by Romanticized “descriptions of nature” prevent  understanding the realities of “life”: Everywhere and always there is the description of the  beauty of nature. Our homeland attracts travelers more  for the loveliness and beauty of its nature. . . . Take, for  example, Russia’s poets, Lermontov, Pushkin . . . it’s all  — 67 — </page> <page sequence="10"> ——————————————————— CHAPTER TWO ——————————————————— the description of the beauty of nature and its inhabit- ants, it’s all ‘pure art’ and rarely the truth and reality of  life. . . . This is why Europe looks at Georgia primarily  from an aesthetic perspective, and this is also why the  contents of our life remains uninvestigated, unknown to  others.7 The blame is laid on all, even Georgian poets “from the great to the  ‘microscopic’,” have participated in the aesthetic alignment of Georgia  with “beauty” at the expense of understanding “life.” But the “nature”  which is the object of Romanticism is not true nature; the Romanticized  appropriation of nature in the gorge is in itself a “second nature,” iden- tified with human artifice or “art” (xelovneba) and genres of “poetry”  (poezia), distinct from and inferior to the true “nature” that is the object  of realism, a positivist de-aestheticized nature which is identified with  descriptions of “life” (see below, chapter 7).  Thus far, Urbneli has somewhat predictably chosen the most aes- theticized stretch of landscape in Georgia as a point of departure to  champion a realist aesthetics of utility and “life” against a Romantic  reduction of Georgia to (natural) “beauty” (a shorthand for all aesthetic  categories typical of Romanticism, including the sublime). He will not  be satisfied with a hybrid Aesopianism used by Chavchavadze to mo- bilize Romantic aestheticized nature as a way of talking about society  and politics. Rather, he wants to draw attention away from the nonhu- man world of nature (Romantic “beauty”) as a veiled representation of  the human order and gaze directly on the human world with a realistic  aesthetics privileging human “life.”  Having debunked the aesthetics of beauty which takes the traveler’s  imagination away from social life to the natural landscape, his gaze is  free to return to the “life” of Xevi. He briefly entertains, and then dis- misses, the idea that a traveler could find out about the “life” of Xevi  simply by learning the ethnographic lifeways of the local inhabitants:  “The identity of the inhabitants, their circumstances and fate we cannot  easily learn about. This would require a different kind of research and,  well, where would a traveler have time for that?” No, Urbneli’s account  requires a double inversion of perspective, not merely moving from Ro- mantic descriptions of nature to a realist description of “life,” but also,  instead of looking at the landscape and locals from the perspective of  — 68 — </page> <page sequence="11"> ———————— Imperial and Colonial Sublime: The Aesthetics of Infrastructures ———————— the travelers on the road, to look at the travelers on the road from the  perspective of the locals. What does the road look like, and the beautiful  carriages of the travelers on it, for example, from the perspective of a  Moxevian peasant standing at the side of the road or working on it? The  resulting aesthetic vision is one of jarring material contradiction: ‘Do they give you money, boy?’ I asked one Moxevian.  ‘Yes, but . . .’ He fell silent, broke off his answer. And re- ally—all this immense expense, all these beautiful build- ings for travelers, elegant hotels and at the same time  this shocking poverty of those dwelling by the Aragvi  River and the Moxevians, of the inhabitants of this  beautiful region, doesn’t all this destroy the harmony of  the soul and heart, doesn’t it upset you? . . . Comedy and  tragedy—with these two words is expressed the life of  our mountain-dwellers.8 And what if we take our eyes off the sublime beauty of the landscape,  and even take our eyes off the tragic and abject circumstances of the  locals and consider the travelers themselves, what do we see?  The road [itself] is different, roads are the veins and ar- teries of the state, as one old economist said. This, from  one perspective, is correct. Yes, this Georgian military  road too—is an artery of the Russian Empire and if you  want to sense the strength and might of this empire,  keep an eye on the travelers [along it]. Here military per- sonnel are constantly moving, various chinovniks [bu- reaucrats]; rarely do we encounter an ordinary person,  a merchant, a tradesman. Why? Because, in my opinion,  that the whole life of Russia for the most part is based on  military force and on bureaucracy.9 If the nature of the “life” of the local inhabitants is not visible to  travelers from the road, then the nature of the “life” of the Russian  Empire is certainly visible by considering the travelers on the road  themselves. The circulation of the Russian road is not the civilizing  circulation of le doux commerce, but the circulation of empire. Having  — 69 — </page> <page sequence="12"> ——————————————————— CHAPTER TWO ——————————————————— banished anthropomorphic metaphors from the aesthetics of nature,  Urbneli reintroduces them in the aesthetics of empire, using the mixed  metaphor of circulation which conflates physiology with infrastructure  (Schivelbusch 1977, 194–5). The Russian road is now an organic exten- sion (veins and arteries) of an anthropomorphized empire; to sense the  “life” and strength of this empire, one can test the pulse of its exposed  artery in Dariel. Urbneli finishes his letter on the antitheses, aesthetic,  economic, and political that present themselves in concentrated visible  form in this narrow artery of empire, with a conversation with a fellow  traveler on the road. ‘Our entire life represents [a series of] antitheses,’ I told  one of my traveling companions—a doctor. ‘You are a  doctor and you try to save people from untimely death.  So many officers, however, are born precisely [sc. to bring  untimely death] to others. How much money goes on  both state doctors and armies. The doctor has one task,  the army has another. But they try to convince us that  “they have one general task”. What do you say to that?’ ‘You are still young. Then what power will subdue  these savage people, if not the army?’ The doctor an- swered me wrathfully. ‘If not bureaucrats, then who will  protect the law?’ he added. I fell silent.10 As Urbneli points out, one of the key antitheses of Xevi is that while  the ethnographic study of the “life” of the inhabitants along this road  is difficult, the military road is probably the best place in the empire  to apprehend the “life” of the Russian state. Though he does not call it  that, since as a realist he is interested in a complete de-aestheticization  of the heavily Romanticized landscape, we nevertheless see in Urbneli’s  account a version of the sublime transferred from the natural order to  the human order, what could be called with some justice a rhetoric of the  “imperial sublime.”11 But this is a sublime where the lyric subject does  not seek identification with the imperial conqueror but with the terrified  or prostrated imperial subject, and one where the objective locus of the  sublime is not the greatness of sublime nature, but the sublime of the  Russian state represented by the circulation on the Russian road itself. — 70 — </page> <page sequence="13"> ———————— Imperial and Colonial Sublime: The Aesthetics of Infrastructures ———————— Imperial and Colonial Sublime  In earlier Romantic articulations of the imperial sublime, the enrap- tured poet appropriates the sublime aesthetics of nature to frame,  among many other possible things, a sublime reading of the empire,  in part “as an attempt on the part of the Russian writer as lyric subject  to establish a relationship (sometimes celebratory, sometimes mut- edly critical) with the state” (Harsha Ram, personal communication).  For Ram and Shatirishvili (2004, 13, see Ram 1998, 2003, Manning  2008 for other readings), “The Russian imperial sublime . . . involved  two axes, a vertical axis provided in the “romantic period by the alpine  landscape, and a horizontal axis created by the panoramic stretch of  conquered territory that was viewed from a height by the enraptured  lyric subject.” Here, the imperial sublime projects the vastness of em- pire onto vertical and horizontal axes. The enraptured lyric subject of  the imperial sublime often seeks identification with a greater power,  imperial power embodied in the monarch, set in opposition to a largely  dehumanized sublime nature, so that the rhetoric of the imperial sub- lime is one in which the empire attracts the sublime properties of the  sublime nature it conquers.  The sublime nature of the Caucasus, embodied in different ways  Mount Kazbek or the rushing, roaring Terek, represent for Russian trav- elers on the road the beauty and savagery of the Caucasus, and in the  same breath, the “imperial sublime” of the vast and powerful Russian  Empire that has conquered it. By contrast, for Urbneli, it is the Russian  road itself, and specifically the nature of the traffic (state agents) on  the road, that represents the “imperial sublime” of the Russian Empire,  one viewed, however, not from the perspective of the conqueror but the  conquered.  In this sense, Urbneli’s confrontation with the Russian road bears  a certain resemblance to what Larkin (2008) has termed “the colonial  sublime,” in which the colonizing power shows “the terrifying ability to  remake landscapes and to force the natural world to conform to these  technological projects by leveling mountains, flooding villages, and re- making cities; these were the ways in which the sublime was produced  as a necessary spectacle of colonial rule” (Larkin 2008, 36). The colonial  sublime is first of all a version of the technological sublime (Marx 1964,  Nye 1996) which moves the prototypical object of the sublime from  — 71 — </page> <page sequence="14"> ——————————————————— CHAPTER TWO ——————————————————— the sphere of nature to the sphere of culture and technology. Second,  this is a sublime which, unlike the imperial sublime, does not so much  emphasize the greatness of the sublime object as the abjection of the  lyric subjects feel in the presence of such an object: “Here the sublime  is experienced not so much through a sense of absolute greatness but  through the overwhelming physical powerlessness individuals feel in  the face of something overpowering and terrible” (Larkin 2008, 36).  Unlike the imperial sublime, where the lyric subject seeks identification  with the monarch surveying his vast dominion from a dizzying height,  the colonial sublime interpellates the colonized subject, using technol- ogy both to incite awe and perhaps terror, but also to “proffer technol- ogy as a mode of development” so that the sublime aspect of technology  will become domesticated and ultimately be taken for granted as part of  colonial modernity (Larkin 2008, 36–7).  For Urbneli and Qazbegi, however, as critical realists, the “colonial  sublime” of the Russian road contains only the first moment, the ability  to incite awe and terror in the face of the power of the Russian state.  The road lacks the second moment as a mode of civilizational or eco- nomic development for those living alongside it. Going far further than  Chavchavadze in their critiques of Russian road, and by extension, the  Russian Empire as an agent of civilizational progress for the colonized,  particularly the mountain tribes of the Caucasus, they instead point up  the ways in which the road remains almost exclusively an instrument of  empire (see Jersild [1999, 510–11] for similar intelligentsia critiques of  Russian technological projects elsewhere in the Caucasus).  The Russian road as an instantiation of the colonial sublime contains  other semiotic vulnerabilities to intelligentsia critique as well, namely  that, like all forms of the technological sublime, as Larkin points out,  it quickly loses its sheen and becomes a taken-for-granted invisible in- frastructural aspect of the landscape, or worse, it comes to be received  in terms of the aesthetic category of the picturesque as being ruined,  dilapidated, backward, and so on: “steamships render sailing ships slow,  airplanes destroy steamboats’ apparent speed, and jets make propeller  planes anachronistic, nostalgic emblems of a previous era. . . . When  [the] idea of the sublime is tied to the representation of colonial power  it builds in a fragility that forever haunts its efforts” (Larkin 2008,  248).

As Har- sha Ram (personal communication) notes, the difference between the  imperial sublime, “which exists chiefly for the rulers and the ruling elite”  and the colonial sublime is fundamentally temporal; “while the imperial  sublime is related to the increasingly anachronistic ancient regime, the  ‘colonial sublime,’ in using technology, is future-oriented. Ironically, it  also becomes anachronistic, but through the inevitable obsolescence of  technology.”  The British colonial sublime discussed by Larkin takes advantage  of a binary geopoetics so that the technological sublime can represent  European civilization to the benighted colonies. However, in a ternary  system in which Russian state both represents the colonized with re- spect to Europe and the colonizer with respect to the colonized people,  the colonial sublime becomes even more unstable.12 The voice of the  local intelligentsia steps in here as elsewhere as a mediating figure:  on the one hand, the intelligentsia is already familiar with these new  European technologies and can readily compare the Russian version to  its European or North American models that they have read about and  find them wanting; on the other hand, the intelligentsia can stand with  the state in contemplating the unenlightened “Oriental” peasantry’s ir- rational animistic response to the technological sublime. Thus, even at  the moment the railroad from Poti to Tbilisi is sparkling new (1872),  an intelligentsia commentator finds that it is already slow, calculating  its average speed as twenty to twenty-five versts an hour (about 21–26  km an hour, about the speed of a galloping horse). It is slow, then, not  compared to anything else available in the Caucasus except perhaps the  fabulous speed of a boat ride down the Choroxi River (on which below).  It is slow compared to things one can read about in newspapers, for ex- ample, the “wondrous speed” of American and English railways, and “in  Russia too, you can’t find one railroad which still on average doesn’t ex- ceed 35–45 versts in an hour.”13 Having thus geopoetically divided this  technological object into truly sublime Euro-American, not-so-sublime  Russian, and not-at-all sublime Caucasus versions, the commentator is  — 73 — </page> <page sequence="16"> ——————————————————— CHAPTER TWO ——————————————————— content to continue this strategy of damning with faint praise by noting  that the local versions excel over the Russian versions in comfortable  appointments of the interior, that a second-class cabin in the Caucasus  is almost better than a first-class cabin in Russia. The intelligentsia as mediating figure between colonizer and colo- nized, state and people, can simultaneously inhabit both sides of the  colonial sublime, like the Georgian Romantics in their appropriation of  the natural sublime (Ram and Shatirishvili 2004, Manning 2008). The  Georgian intelligentsia, contemplating a new Russian railroad, can not  only prove their coevality with European civilization by knowing what is,  and what is not, a good candidate for awe, but also by adopting the stance  of the colonial civilizers themselves in bemused contemplation of the  imagined stupefaction and superstition of "our simple people" at these  animated iron monsters (compare Bektas [2001], Larkin [2008, 40–43],  on similar narratives imputing animism and credulity to Oriental or Afri- can audiences when faced with Western technological “wonders”): When the people do not understand the real explanation  of a phenomenon or an object, then they try to explain it  in their own peculiar way. Who knows what our simple  people are saying about this railroad. Some say, ‘some  sort of evil spirit sits in this mashina [machine, the  author is voicing the peasant’s words] and it makes the  wheels roll with its hands’; some say ‘the anglichans [sc.  the English] have captured a dragon and imprisoned it  in the front room and it propels the train, and when it  encounters difficulties, its shrieks and screams become  more frequent.’ And who knows what others say, how  they explain the movement of the railroad!14 The mediating intelligentsia position is also a critical position. Tak- ing advantage of the semiotic vulnerability of the colonial sublime,  which when working properly can at best aspire to becoming an invis- ible order of infrastructure, travelers like Chavchavadze, especially his  imagined French fellow traveler, would seek to minimize or defang this  “technological sublime” by focusing on more typically picturesque ele- ments: stereotypically picturesque figures like antiquated post carts and  draw attention away from the technological sublime to what one could  — 74 — </page> <page sequence="17"> ———————— Imperial and Colonial Sublime: The Aesthetics of Infrastructures ———————— call the dilapidated, backward, ruinous “technological picturesque.”15  By realigning the technological order of the Russian Empire with the  technological picturesque as opposed to the technological sublime,  such critiques could make powerful charges of Russian backwardness  and consequent inability to embody civilization, which is then located  elsewhere, in France or Britain.  And indeed, the infrastructure Russian postal system in the Dariel  pass, upon which all travelers depend for transport, there as elsewhere  provides a set of picturesque images of technological backwardness in  the form of yamshchiki and Russian postal carts. On the technological  level, since the yam or relay system upon which it was based always  used local populations, local domesticated animals (horses, reindeers  dogs, camels, etc.), and indigenous technological affordances (a pictur- esque assortment of carts, boats, sleds, and so forth) adapted to local  conditions, the varied climates, landscapes, and conditions of the vast  empire, it could not help but present itself as a picturesque assemblage  of varied transport methods and technologies (Bazilevich 1999 [1927],  14, 67–88, 173). The passage through the Caucasus was certainly an  exemplary picturesque spot within a network characterized by its tech- nologically picturesque qualities (Bazilevich 1999 [1927], 84–88). Only  in those portions of the network where steamship or train could be used  could the system aspire to “technological sublime,” and these links could  always be found wanting by comparison with their American or Euro- pean models and in any case could not displace the more “picturesque”  local technologies of the relay system everywhere, particularly not in  the Dariel passing (Bazilevich 1999 [1927], 172–189). For example, Chavchavadze’s Letters of a Traveler dwells on the Rus- sian postal cart and yamshchik, primarily to allow him to critique Rus- sia’s pretensions to representing a civilizing colonial power (he brings in  a Frenchman only to make fun of Russia’s post carts!):  When I had packed, that is, when I had put my little  leather knapsack in the cart, I turned to bid farewell to  my newly made French acquaintance. ‘Who invented this vehicle?’ He asked, pointing to  the postcart on which the sleepy ‘yamshchik’ was stu- pidly dozing. ‘The Russians’, I answered.  — 75 — </page> <page sequence="18"> ——————————————————— CHAPTER TWO ——————————————————— ‘I imagine nobody is likely to dispute the honor with  them. I pity you to be forced to addle your brain and  shake up your stomach on a thing like that.’ ‘No harm done. If the whole of Russia travels like  this, why should I complain?’  ‘They all travel like that? That’s why they have gone  so far! God give you a safe journey. As for me, I tell you  frankly I would not risk my life by getting into it. Good  bye! If we meet again some day I beg you to remember  me.’ With these words he gave me his hand to bid farewell  and grasped it firmly as only a European can. I entered the postcart. (I) Similarly, the Russian officer’s delusional imagining of a Russian  technological sublime in which flies become the engines of progress re- placing the expensive machines of the French is introduced to underline  the same opposition between the European technological sublime and  the laughable Russian technological picturesque or even grotesque. The French invent devilish sorts of things like that, but  to buy their machines is dear, while my invention doesn’t  cost a farthing. What expense is there in catching two  flies and putting them in a box? It is nothing. But now,  see what will be the result of my invention: when it  spreads perhaps there will be a trade in flies. There will  thus be a new form of commerce in the land; some fine  day you will go into your town and you will find a fly  shop. That’s not bad. How many hungry mouths may be  filled by the help of flies! What are flies at present? Noth- ing. Of what use are they? None at all. Now you see of  what great significance the labor and work of a learned  and wise man is to the land. (III) For critical writers about the Caucasus of the 1880s, like Qazbegi  and Urbneli, the imperial sublime, as viewed from the perspective of the  conquered, was one terrifying in its aspect and consequences and could  not be so simply defanged by one laughing Frenchman or one laughable  — 76 — </page> <page sequence="19"> ———————— Imperial and Colonial Sublime: The Aesthetics of Infrastructures ———————— Russian scientific officer. These “mountain writers” then, are somewhat  exceptional compared to the rest of the Georgian intelligentsia in the  fierceness of their critiques of the Russian civilizing mission, emphasizing  the terrifying forceful aspect of the imperial sublime over the progressive  potentialities of the colonial sublime in their assessment of the Russian  road as a proxy for more general critiques of the savagery of the Russian  military conquest of the “savage tribes” of the Caucasus (on which, see  Layton 1994, 1997; Jersild 2002, Manning 2009). They thus emphasize  one aspect of the more general ambivalent reception of the narrative of  Russian colonial rule that characterized “native” intelligentsia elsewhere  in the Caucasus, in which the savagery of Russian conquest of the Cauca- sus was complemented by its civilizing mission elsewhere (Khalid 1997,  1998; but see Jersild 1999 for native intelligentsia ambivalence about  this aspect of the Russian civilizing mission as well). Many non-Russians in the Russian Empire were active  members of imperial educated society (obshchestvo),  and they often conceived of the colonial advance of  Russia as part of the march of the progressive West and  “civilization” itself into the backward lands of the East.  Reformist empire builders who criticized the brutal wars  and population transfers that marked the conquest of  the southern border lands also emphasized the civilizing  mission of the empire on its eastern frontier. (Jersild  1999, 503) Conclusion: The Antinomies of Intelligentsia Discourse  “Our entire life represents antitheses,” Urbneli tells his traveling com- panion. The antitheses that become visible in miniature form over this  short stretch of land, in Dariel, are the same antitheses that haunt not  only the Russian Empire, but the subaltern culture of circulation being  created by the Georgian intelligentsia culture of circulation through  this period.16 Into each antithesis, Europe and Asia, civilization and  savagery, the Russian Road and the Terek River, the state and the  people, the intelligentsia inserts itself as a mediating voice. Beginning  with Chavchavadze, the Georgian intelligentsia in the Dariel finds the  — 77 — </page> <page sequence="20"> ——————————————————— CHAPTER TWO ——————————————————— geographic object, Georgia, as a thing already spoken about, and so the  Dariel pass becomes a privileged place as well as topos to engage all that  was said before about Georgia as a whole. By the 1880s, this marginal  area of Georgia in the Caucasus becomes the privileged place both to  critique Russian imperial rule as well as to imagine a sublime ethno- graphic vision of Georgianness, the Georgians of the mountains, once  considered savages, now imagined as surrogate selves whose freedoms  make their communities an imagined “elsewhere” which Georgians can  enjoy vicariously (again, following earlier Russian narratives of escape  and vicarious identification with the mountaineer freedom of the Cau- casus (Layton 1994, Ram 1999, Grant 2009, Manning 2009). By the  1890s, a reviewer of the works of Aleksandre Qazbegi could look back  on his work as a new direction within Georgian realism characteristic of  the 1880s, one which involved applying the principles of realism both  to the ethnographic study of the life of Georgian mountain peoples  (the topic with which Qazbegi began) and the simultaneous elabora- tion of the ethnographic life of these people in literary treatments  (which Qazbegi turned his hands to after he finished his Mokhevian  ethnographies).17 This new direction is the study of our mountain people,  their customs, adats, beliefs, ideals, poetry. This direc- tion also has another side, that is, our poets and belle- trists have turned the life of these people into themes  for the practice of their own talents.18  To understand this “turn to the mountains” of the 1880s, we need  to understand what happened in the decade between the publication  of Chavchavadze’s letters (1861–1871) and Aleksandre Qazbegi’s first  writings about the Moxevians (1880). The intervening period is the mo- ment of the development and consolidation of a specifically Georgian  print culture in 1860s–1870s in the newspaper Droeba. In this period,  the mountains play a minor role; it is West Georgia and especially the  newly conquered regions of Ottoman Georgia in the late 1870s that  forms the critical borderlands in which the mediating voice of the in- telligentsia forms itself. This period is defined by two main events: the  emancipation of the serfs (announced for the empire in 1861, beginning  in East Georgia in 1864, and continuing from 1865 to 1871 in West  — 78 — </page> <page sequence="21"> ———————— Imperial and Colonial Sublime: The Aesthetics of Infrastructures ———————— Georgia) and the conquest of Ottoman Georgia (1878–9). Especially in  the latter case, it might be argued that a radical disconfirmation of the  happy fairytale reunification of the Georgian people, the disappoint- ment of intelligentsia projects to mediate this divide between “Ottoman  Georgia” and “European Georgia,” evidenced first and foremost by the  massive flight of Ottoman people from Russian rule (and their Georgian  intelligentsia mediators), was what caused the subsequent immense  boom of interest in the mountains of Georgia in the 1880s. The cen- tral intelligentsia project of the period to mediate between the lettered  public of the intelligentsia and the unlettered voice of the people, that  forms the core of Chavchavadze’s text, encountered in the borderlands  of Ottoman and European Georgia a transcribable, but unassimilable  people and landscape. In Ottoman Georgia, Georgian intelligentsia  moved from being “Orientals” in relation to Russia (as they are in Letters  of a Traveler) to being “Europeans” in relation to the recently conquered  population of “Ottoman Georgia.” The recalcitrant realities of Ottoman  Georgia which exploded the myths the intelligentsia had written for it  made it a place unfit for the free play of the imagination, which then  shifted into the mountains of Georgia, a place that Russian Romantics  had already made into a fitting home for the imagination. The story of an imagined Georgia which begins with Chavchavadze  at the northern boundaries of Georgia in the Dariel pass ends at the  southern boundaries not a decade later in the empty Ottoman town  of Ardanuji with a correspondent writing under the pseudonym of S.  Bavreli. After that, the Georgian imagination in the 1880s turns away  from the southern borders back to the Caucasus. In between, the an- tinomies of this central text are reconstituted in the unfamiliar land- scape of Ottoman Georgia. The next chapters tell that story, unfolding  the categories of Georgian print culture as they emerge in this period  in the context of this fateful encounter of European Georgia with its  Oriental other. — 79 — </page> <page sequence="22"> ——————————————————— CHAPTER TWO ——————————————————— Figure 4: Picturesque Technology and Sublime Nature on the Dariel Pass.  — 80 — </page> </plain_text>
