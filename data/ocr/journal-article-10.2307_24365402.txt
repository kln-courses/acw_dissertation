One paints; the other makes almost everything but paintings. Both are visionary artists. ART-STANLEY WHITNEY 38 by David Reed Stanley Whitney came to NYC in the '70s. Whitney's answer to painting's "hard times," as David Reed calls those years, was composing with color as a jazz musi cian plays with themes and variations. THEATER-FEDERICO LEÖN 48 by Richard Maxwell Federico Leon's recent Las multitudes was staged last year in Argentina. For Richard Maxwell, the playwright-director's production is a "brokenhearted humanity tale." A heroic one, at that, with 120 actors. ARCHITECTURE - STAN ALLEN 56 by Nader Tehrani Stan Allen's seminal essay "Field Conditions," written almost 15 years ago, still resonates among architects. He confers with Nadar Tehrani on landscape urbanism as well as building and teaching "from a position of uncertainty." LITERATURE - ENRIQUE VILA-MATAS 72 by Lina Meruane translated by Valerie Miles Enrique Vila-Matas's characters include James Joyce, F. Scott Fitzgerald, Ernest Hemingway, Paul Auster, and even Enrique Vila-Matas. The Catalan author talks with Meruane about his distinct method of interlacing reading, writing, fact, and fiction.</page><page sequence="6">SETON SMITH 68 EVA HEISLER 80 CARMEN BOULLOSA 82 DIANA HAMILTON 88 T COOPER 91 ELENA ALEXANDER 99 CLARICE LISPECTOR 102 TOM HEALY 110 LITERATURE-RACHEL KUSHNER 104 FIRST PROOF by Hari Kunzru BOMB'S LITERARY SUPPLEMENT Rachel Kushner's latest novel.

But we weren't quite sure what to call it. Being a newspaperman, I favored Brooklyn Eagle Beer, after the famed newspaper that once was edited by Walt Whitman. I interviewed more than 25 design firms before finally landing a meeting with Milton Glaser, creator of the "I LOVE NY" logo, co-founder of New York Magazine and the man behind countless iconic designs. Milton listened patiently to my idea and then said simply: "Look, you got Brooklyn here. Who needs a bird in the name? And isn't there another brewery with an eagle in its logo? Let's claim Brooklyn." He was right. The simple, brilliant logo he crafted has become a fitting symbol of the brawny borough of Brooklyn. And Milton remains a partner in the brewery, the director of all our artwork and a great advisor and friend. —Steve Hindy, co-founder and president © Brooklyn Brewery 79 N lllh St, Brooklyn NY 11249 BrooklynBrewery.com QFacebook.com/TheBrooklynBrewery Q ©BrooklynBrewery BrooklynBloggery.com</page><page sequence="25">The MIT Press AD The Case for Improvisation Charles Jencks and Nathan Silver VARIOUS SMALL BOOKS ADHOCISM VARIOUS SMALL BOOKS The Case for Improvisation Referencing Various Small Books Updated and expanded edition by Ed Ruscha Charles Jencks and Nathan Silver edited and compiled by Jeff Brouws, "Adhocism is not only an informative Wend^ Burton'iJnd Herma™ Zschie9ner and witty book, but an ultimately BhilTay|or and an essay ' ' r\\/ AA-srlx Ui\*/ incAn by Mark Rawlinson Riffs, revisions, knockoffs, and hom ages: artists pay tribute to Ed Ruscha's famous photo-conceptual small books. 288 pp., 298 color illus., 55 b&amp;w illus., $39.95 cloth c The Global Contemporary Art vvcjids humane one." — John Hollander, poet 288 pp., 244 illus., $24.95 paper LIGHT SHOW edited by Cliff Lauson foreword by Ralph Rugoff essays by Cliff Lauson, Philip Ball, and Anne Wagner An investigation of art that explores edited by Bobbye Tigerman the experiential and sculptural nature of light, showcasing a range of art works from the 1960s to the present.
