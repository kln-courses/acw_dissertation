<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE TECHNIQUE OF INVOCATION IN 'KING LEAR' King Lear is a Christian play about a pagan world. The first part of this assertion has often been denied, but seems to me certainly true.1 The second part has always been obvious. What I have never seen worked out in detail is the effect that Shake- speare has achieved by this duality, and could have achieved in no other way. Bradley remarked that 'references to religious or irreligious beliefs are more frequent than is usual in Shakespeare's tragedies',2 and later critics have made comments on their distribution: that, for instance, the gods are invoked only by the good charac- ters.3 By casting the net a little more widely and considering the place of invoca- tions4 of all sorts in the play, it is possible to see a particular pattern emerging. But first some general considerations. The fact that Shakespeare can assume in his audience a different religious stand- point from that of any of his characters gives him a peculiar freedom,5 and makes possible an unusual complexity and richness. He need not take the opportunity. In the Greek and Roman plays (except Antony and Cleopatra, where the duality is of a different kind from that in Lear), he does not want to. But in Lear it is of the essence of the play. In a play set in a Christian world the characters can only be represented either as Christians, living in varying degrees in accordance with their faith, or as indifferents, or as rebels. Thus when Lady Macbeth invokes evil forces they are in the full sense the Powers of Hell.6 But the world of Lear is one in which there is no strict religious orthodoxy. Each character creates-or, if that is too strong a word, attaches himself to-a religion which reflects his nature. The characters in Lear are never so completely and revealingly themselves as when they are in- voking a something not themselves that make for-whatever it makes for. This constitutes the core of truth in Wilson Knight's exaggerated statement that the religion in Lear is naturalistic.7 It is not true at all of the religion of the play, and not all the religion in the play is naturalistic in the usual sense,8 but it is natural religion-religion that arises out of the characters' reflexion on the nature of things in the degree in which their natures allow them to see it. In saying this, I do not mean to deny that the order of grace directs the action and colours the characters' speeches. But it does not enter prominently into the passages in which the characters think of themselves as generalizing about the universe. 'Thy life's a miracle', says Edgar to Gloucester (Iv. vi. 56). and France talks of 'a faith that reason without 1 The easiest way to verify this is with the help 4 I use this as an inclusive term to cover of the entry, 'Christian Elements', in the Index appeals, prayers, curses, and oaths in the name to R.

MAXWELL 143 miracle / Could never plant in me' (I. i. 225-6), but such passages are not systematic: they represent Shakespeare's indifference to anachronism, and his own attitude towards his story, but are incidental compared with the invocatory passages, which it is the main purpose of this paper to discuss. One set of invocations, to which the first that occur in the play belong, are those in which the tone of classical paganism prevails. I use this phrase rather than a more precise one because I am not confining my attention to invocations of strictly anthropomorphic deities. Indeed, Lear's first invocation is in Wilson Knight's sense more 'naturalistic': For by the sacred radiance of the sun, The mysteries of Hecate and the night, By all the operations of the orbs From whom we do exist and cease to be. (I. i. 111-4) In a general way the appeal is to 'the ordered universe',1 but the tone is that of one who feels himself firmly set in a state-order which reflects the macrocosm. The rhythms are stately and measured.2 The natural objects 'sun' and 'night' fit in, do not clash, with the anthropomorphized 'Hecate', and we are prepared for the more conventional anthropomorphism of 'by Apollo' (1. 161) and 'by Jupiter'(1.181). The earlier of these has close links with its immediate context. Kent's echoing of 'Apollo' brings out the ambivalent role of that deity-the god who both sends disease and cures it; and this vague suggestion is translated almost at once into the direct' Kill thy physician and the fee bestow Upon the foul disease. (11. 166-7) The striking thing about the development of the play is the way in which this self- confident paganism fades out as Lear's mind changes. It comes in next when he finds Kent in the stocks. He answers Kent's statement that Regan and Cornwall have put him there with 'by Jupiter, I swear, no' (ii. iv. 21), to which Kent retorts, 'by Juno, I swear, ay'. This is a brilliant touch. We are reminded of Lear's 'by Jupiter' in the earlier scene, but the new passage points out how much less final that was than it was meant to sound. Nothing is commoner than for Juno and Jupiter to be at loggerheads. We are witnessing the break-up of a religious outlook that based itself naively on the pagan pantheon. Official paganism is a broken reed, and Lear explicitly gives up reliance on it at the end of this scene: I do not bid the thunder-bearer shoot, Nor tell tales of thee to high-judging Jove. Mend when thou canst; be better at thy leisure: I can be patient. (11. 230-3) This does not exactly amount to a renunciation of pagan belief, but it is a rejection of the accepted pagan practices in favour of what is (though Lear cannot know it) the specifically Christian virtue of patience. At any rate, we hear nothing hereafter of classical paganism. It is too exclusively a civil cult to satisfy Lear now, or to stand up against the tumult of the storm. But already before this final abandonment we have had from Lear a very different type of invocation, that to Nature in I. ix. 299ff. (itself a pendant to Edmund's in 1 Ibid. p. 266. Shakespeare, 1st ser. (London, 1927), p. 158. 2 'This is the language of such an authority as Cf. p. 164 on the 'Olympian' element in Lear. Lear discards': H. Granville-Barker, Prefaces to</page><page sequence="3">The Technique of Invocation in 'King Lear' I. ii, which must be discussed later). Lear's 'Nature', and in particular its contrast with Edmund's, has been well described by Heilman.1 I want to stress how Shakespeare presents the precise degree of anthropomorphism that suits Lear's state of mind. He needs to appeal to something both more ultimate and more intimate than the deities he has invoked so far-Nature is 'dear goddess' as they have not been. She is a being, too, with specific, and alterable, purposes ('if thou didst intend'). We are meant to see a strong streak of superstition and also of arrogance in Lear here. It is not enough for him to curse-he must prescribe ways and means to Nature;2 and, though ultimately the sharp antithesis between Lear's 'Nature' and Edmund's becomes quite clear, yet since Edmund has got his say in first, we are slightly prepossessed against any appeal to Nature as a goddess. Yet at the same time the curse has the accent of one that is destined to be fulfilled, though we cannot but shudder at it. The natural reaction is to shrink back from full realization into the language of a conventionally vague piety, with Albany: 'Now, gods that we adore, whereof comes this?' (1. 314). Lear's outburst is repeated in II. iv. 164ff., with a vaguer reference to 'heaven' followed by a direct appeal to the specific individual forces of Nature, and again the response (this time a hypo- critical one from Regan) is '0 the blest Gods' (1. 171). This persisting rancour makes all the more impressive the sudden reversion to a direct appeal to moral and sympathetic 'heavens' in 11. 192ff. It is not the first time that this note has been heard. In I. v. 49, '0, let me not be mad, not mad, sweet heavens!', Lear 'for the first time humbly asks aid',3 and the word 'sweet' links the two passages. But there is a real advance in II. iv: 'if yourselves are old'. Lear is coming to think of the heavens in terms of what they are, not merely of what they can do for him, though it is still in relation to a characteristic that links him with them. After both Goneril and Regan have revealed themselves fully, this note recurs, though in a manner which reflects a setback in Lear's state. He appeals again to the 'heavens', the 'gods', and appeals to them for what they really have to give, patience;4 but he is so unclear about the implications of his prayer as to add: 'fool me not so much / To bear it tamely' (11. 278-9), and falls into threats of revenge on the Senecan pattern.5 Cornwall, with more insight than he himself fully realizes, sums up Lear's state: "Tis best to give him way; he leads himself' (1. 301). A more specific 'naturalism' recurs in the invocation to the detailed forces of Nature in III. ii. Lear's insight has fallen off still further from his fleeting vision of the 'heavens' who themselves 'are old', and can only see that in Nature which reflects his daughters' unkindness and acts as their 'servile ministers'. Yet he can vaguely think of some power not wholly immanent in the turmoil: 'the great gods/ That keep this dreadful pudder o'er our heads' (11. 49-50). One has the sense of a blind alley, from which the escape through madness is the only one possible for Lear. But it is in the lull before the final onset of this madness that we get for the first time a purely religious attitude of prayer (III. iv. 27ff.). The striking thing about this prayer, however, and one which illustrates the flexibility of Shakespeare's 1 Op. cit. ch. 4; also J. F.

MAXWELL 145 technique in King Lear, is that it is not really a 'prayer' at all. We are so used to the passage that we hardly realize its audacity. We have heard Lear appeal to the Olympians, the 'heavens', the 'gods' for sympathy and vengeance. What can be left for him to say?-'Poor naked wretches': a direct address to his fellow-sufferers. The speech has a force immeasurably greater than could any mere statement of Lear's realization that he has 'ta'en too little care of this'. The heavens are too high for him, and the foretaste of his humility-only to be fully achieved through mad- ness-is conveyed by his not being able even to speak to them any longer. The most he can do is to turn from the victims in order to adjure 'pomp' to 'show the heavens more just'. This is a curiously elusive phrase, which is possible only in the religiously undefined world of the characters of this play. A paraphrase would presumably be 'make the heavens appear more just than they do in the light of your present behaviour'.1 That is to say, there is not a clear statement of an objective justice in the heavens which man is to imitate; nor is there a clear statement of disbelief in such objective justice.2 For the moment, at least, Lear is not prepared to say anything about what the heavens actually are like. But the impact of experience has brought home to him what kind of world man ought to behave as if he existed in. He is not satisfied with mere moral recommendation, independent of a suggested quality of the world order, but he stops short at suggestion. In this respect, the passage contrasts with the speech of Gloucester (iv. i. 67-72) which Johnson com- pared to it: 'Heavens, deal so still.' There the supremacy of a heavenly order which is asked to impose its justice is unequivocally stated. Gloucester by that time knows where he is; Lear, at this stage, not yet. Lear himself is not shown to us again invoking any external powers, yet at the same time his 'theology', as Wilson Knight himself admits, becomes 'less naturalistic',3 and it is in this part of the play that we have the sole reference to a single 'God', though significantly it is in a context of gently humorous self- criticism: 'take upon's the mystery of things, / As if we were God's spies' (v. iii. 16-17). Lear's spiritual health is shown by his ability to smile at the thought of doing what he had striven to do in deadly earnest-and had gone mad in the process. But in this later part of the play the pattern of invocation, on the Lear side of the action, is taken up by Cordelia. Her first speech of this kind places her beautifully: it is non-dogmatic, 'naturalistic' if you like, but we see at once the difference between her 'Nature' and Lear's (let alone Edmund's): All bless'd secrets, All you unpublished virtues of the earth, Spring with my tears! be aidant and remediate In the good man's distress! (iv. iv. 15-18) It comes with all the more force because it recalls the curses in which Lear had invoked the destructive powers of Nature against Goneril.4 An attitude of humility 1 A more direct implication of heavenly justice 261-2 in Parrott's edition): 'Last yet, life, / And could be extracted from the line if one took just bring the gods off fairer.' as an adverb: 'reveal more exactly the nature of 2 As suggested by Bradley: 'Those habitual the heavens', and I am not convinced that miseries of the poor... seem to him to accuse the Shakespeare has not chosen an expression that is gods of injustice' (op. cit. p. 272). capable of suggesting this idea. But I do not 3 Op cit. p. 208. think this sense is prominent enough to create 4 There are some good remarks on 'the con- an artistically effective ambiguity.

XLV 10</page><page sequence="5">The Technique of Invocation in 'King Lear' (in the full etymological sense) is conveyed in the appeal specifically to the 'virtues of the earth': there is no need to invoke the heavens; and when Cordelia's language becomes more explicitly religious she appeals to the 'kind gods' (iv. vii. 14) who are clearly transcendent beings. Lear, in his broken state, needs a mediator,1 and it is appropriate that at the end of the play his attitude should be one of childlike dependence rather than one of active religious aspiration. I have followed through the play the pattern of the invocations uttered by Lear and by the characters most closely associated with him. The others can be dealt with more briefly. Kent is appropriately given only brief and conventional appeals. Albany is similarly treated, though his growth in stature as the play proceeds comes out in the fact that he is given the impressive comment, 'this shows you are above' (iv. iii. 18). Gloucester, in view of the parallel between the development of his fortunes and those of Lear, is a more interesting figure to follow. It is symptomatic of the credulous and superstitious attitude attributed to him at the beginning of the play that he talked more about the ordering of the universe than the others-Edmund realizes that he can win his father's confidence by claiming to have assailed Edgar with commonplaces about the 'revenging Gods' (i. i. 47)- but there is no sign in the earlier scenes of a genuinely religious attitude on his part. As Heilman says, 'it takes all Gloucester's suffering to awaken his sense of deity', and a further point made by the same critic is a good illustration of the importance of the different varieties of invocations in the play: 'he soon moves from oath and prophecy to prayers'.2 The first 'grand manner' invocation, as we may call, it is that already mentioned as recalling Lear's of III. iv. 27ff.: Heavens, deal so still! Let the superfluous and lust-dieted man, That slaves your ordinance, that will not see Because he doth not feel, feel your power quickly: So distribution should undo excess, And each man have enough. (iv. i. 67-72) His speech before his attempted suicide shows how valuable Shakespeare's pagan framework is. Gloucester's religious feeling here is both genuine and profound, yet he is contemplating an act that is by Christian standards a mortal sin. In the appeal to the 'mighty gods' and their 'great opposeless wills' we see a mind that has gone as far as anyone in Gloucester's situation, and living in his world, can go, and even after his miraculous escape, Shakespeare is careful to avoid putting any words that suggest Christianity into his mouth. But there is an infinitely subtle approach to a deeper insight in the change to 'you ever-gentle gods' (1. 221), and Edgar is allowed later to speak more precisely of having saved his father 'from despair' (v. ii. 193). The logical transition is, then, to Edgar, who 'interprets everything religiously'.3 With him we are perhaps a little surprised to find a complete absence of invocation.4 But it is in keeping. His mood for dealing with the divine is the indicative. He is given one of the generalizations that are direct and valid comments on the moral 1 The'Christ-like'elements in the presentation on Gloucester even more unmercifully than the of Cordelia have been noted by Bethell, op. cit. rest of his book. pp. 59-60. 3 Bradley, op. cit. p. 306. 2 Op. cit. p. 261.

MAXWELL 147 significance of the action: 'the gods are just', etc. (v. iii. 172ff.),' in marked anti- thesis to his father's false 'as flies to wanton boys' (iv. i. 36). His very epithet for the gods, 'clearest',2 is less conventional, perhaps more numinous, than those applied elsewhere in the play. Edgar seems to know what he is talking about as no one else does. The quiet confidence of Edgar's affirmation of the divine ordering of the universe helps to place (in retrospect, for it is Edmund who makes the first impact) the obtrusive doctrinaire naturalism of his brother. Nature may be his goddess (i. ii. 1 ff.), but far from walking humbly with her, he harangues her. For the rest of the play, apart from his half-repentance at the close, which does not seem to be based on anything approaching a conversion, he is as 'instrumentalist'3 in his thinking as the other evil characters, who are openly indifferent to religion. This study has in no sense been presented as a reinterpretation of the play. It has merely attempted to isolate certain motifs a little more clearly than has been done before. Bradley talks of 'that feeling which haunts us in King Lear, as though we were witnessing something universal',4 and there has always been a sense that Shakespeare is 'raising problems' in Lear more than anywhere else.5 Bradley himself, in remarking that 'as we contemplate this world, the question presses on us, What can be the ultimate power that moves it?' adds that 'in King Lear this question is not left to us to ask, it is raised by the characters themselves'.6 The tendency of my analysis has been to show that it is on this asking that Shake- speare's main interest is concentrated, on the way in which its variety, especially in the particular field of direct invocation, reflects the natures of the characters. This makes the play both less and more religious than has been thought. On the one hand, the multiplicity of conflicting religious attitudes, and above all the pagan setting, do not make the play one in which the main purpose is to pit these attitudes against each other, in the way in which Zeus and Prometheus are opposed by Aeschylus. On the other hand, there is no need to minimize the importance of the many unobtrusive phrases which suggest that, as we might expect in a play pre- sented before an English audience in the early seventeenth century, a Christian outlook is both presupposed and expressed.
