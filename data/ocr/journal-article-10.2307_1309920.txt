<plain_text><page sequence="1">Letters ANIMAL EXPERIMENTS Judging by their letters concerning experi- mental animals (March 1985 BioScience 35: 138), Paul Harwood, James Hickman, and Judith Weis seem to be confused as to the meaning and moral implications of the articles (November 1984 BioScience 34) to which they refer. These articles are a discussion of ethical problems of animal experimentation. Paul Harwood's letter has to do with funda- mentalism and antiscience, not with the prob- lem of the ethics of animal experimentation. James Hickman apparently does not under- stand that there is a problem. He says: "To me the moral stance is that of respect and compassion for all life forms that shuns all wantonness and ill use. Eating a cow is no better or worse than eating wheat." The sec- ond sentence is a startling non sequitor, in- deed, a flat contradiction of tfie first. From an ecological and societal standpoint, the state- ment is questionable. From a humane stand- point, it is shocking. Although Hickman is a botanist, it is hard to believe that he does not know that cows, unlike wheat, have a nervous system closely similar to our own, and can suffer pain and fear. From his viewpoint, aside from the questions of legality and flavor, he might just as well substitute the word "human" for '"cow." Judith Weis asks a valid question from the viewpoint of regulating animal experimenta- tion, but she does not seem to understand that the problem is not simply a taxonomic one. She says that in the debate over laboratory animals, the definition of "animal" was not addressed, and that while biologists know what an animal is, different animal rights and humane groups are concerned with protection of different phyla and classes of animals. It seems evident to me, that once we accept that life is a continuum, we must also accept that it is difficult to draw sharp dividing lines. When, for practical purposes, such a line must arbi- trarily be drawn, the decision on where to draw it must be relevant to the purpose for which it is drawn. If the purpose is to avoid suffering of experimental animals, it is clear that the position of the line must be related to the ability of the animals to feel pain, and to suffer. It is also clear that there may be degrees of ability to feel pain and to suffer. There is thus a valid problem as to where we wish to specify protection-not because we are willing to have some animals suffer and not others, but because the taxonomic line where pain and suffering begin is not a sharp one. Where there is a question, the animal should be given the benefit of the doubt. Where we know the animal can suffer, the problem becomes one of justifying the use of such an animal in experiments for human benefit. If we decide it is justified, then it is a moral responsibility to reduce pain, fear, and suffering to the minimum possible. Where the experiment is inherently objectionable be- cause of the degree of suffering involved, it should not be done, regardless of scientific or direct practical value. Judith Weis remarks that the veterinarian must "sign off" each time she experiments on fish, that she is treating them properly, and that the veterinarian says he really knows nothing about fish, "which is to be expect- ed." Part of the veterinarian's responsibility is to see to the welfare of the experimental animal. If fish are the experimental subjects, he should make it his business to know some- thing about them. The failure of many scien- tists to recognize their responsibility to the experimental animal is part of the problem. MARJORIE ANCHEL Scientists Group for Reform of Animal Experimentation 147-01 Third Avenue Whitestone, NY 11357 FAN MAIL This is just to say that I was very pleased with the February 1985 issue of BioScience, so much so that I have enclosed a check for AIBS membership in order to get personal copies of future editions! In my work over the past three years on the staff of the Office of International Affairs of the National Research Council, I have found BioScience to be one of the most useful journals I receive. I am a "generalist" in science for development with a Ph.D. in chemistry, but I often work on agricultural, health, and environmental topics. Fortunate- ly, my training in bioorganic reaction mecha- nisms provides the broad base needed for understanding technical detail at the level of articles in your journal. While I profit from reading your technical articles, I also appreci- ate the quality of the space you devote to policy issues such as the piece, "Research Malpractice," by Daryl Chubin. Thanks again for enlightening me and oth- ers who have left the laboratory for the policy world but need to understand what the bench scientists are doing to begin to think about the global implications of today's science. DAVID M. MOG Professional Associate National Research Council Office of International Affairs 2101 Constitution Avenue Washington, DC 20418 THE SAME LANGUAGE The scientists who realize they are people like the rest of mankind doing the same things the rest of mankind is doing but in a more careful, precise, and systematic way also real- ize they use the same language the rest of mankind uses, but one differing in some re- spects. They do not speak or write a different language but have more careful, precise, and systematic meanings for the words they use. If their concepts differ sufficiently from those of ordinary language, they must have different words for those concepts. When it became obvious that the older English words kind and sort were too broad and imprecise, the words species, genus, and the whole range of words for nomenclatural categories were brought in, usually borrowed from Latin or Greek be- cause such words did not interfere with the meanings of words already in the English (or other) languages. When Kramer (July/August 1984 BioSci- ence 34: 405) speaks of anthropomorphic and teleological implications in the word strategy, I know precisely what he means, but when ecologists use strategy for "long-term proc- ess" (January 1985 BioScience 35: 66), they are not being more careful, precise, or sys- tematic but rather introducing into the con- cept represented by that word an unwarranted foreign concept-that of planning, a thought- out means to an end. Thus they are also introducing a sharp distinction, both in kind and in time, into a continuous process that differs as it proceeds only in amount and variety of effects on the organisms affected and their reactions to them. Was the extinc- BioScience Vol. 35 No. 5 266</page><page sequence="2">tion of the dinosaurs the result of a strategy, and if it was, by whom, and is it for science to say? We are not a special kind of people working in our ivory towers and speaking our own esoteric language. This is becoming truer year by year as science affects mankind more and more. Let us aid rather than hinder. More than a century ago Charles Lutwidge Dodgson (who said his name was Lewis Car- roll) had Humpty Dumpty in Through the Looking-Glass say "in rather a scornful tone," "When I use a word it means just what I choose it to mean-neither more nor less." Alice answered, "The question is whether you can make words mean so many different things." GEORGE C. STEYSKAL Systematic Entomology Laboratory USDA (retired) 5622 Southwick Street Bethesda, MD 20817 THANK-YOU NOTES Thank you for quoting me correctly. Be- lieve me, it doesn't happen often. Laura Tangley's article, "Taking Stock of White Cedar Wetlands," (January 1985 Bio- Science 34: 682-684) was certainly enjoyable and should do much to alert the biological community to the potential demise of this wetland type. To be honest, I never realized how seriously Atlantic white cedar had declined. JANET C. O'NEILL Biologist Regulatory Branch Operations Division Army Corps of Engineers 424 Trapelo Road Waltham, MA 02254 One of the pleasures of stewarding a three- decade research program is to observe its progressive unfolding. A related joy is to observe the increased understanding and, on the whole, increased accuracy in textbooks and science reporting from one triennium to the next. By far the most fluent, accurate, and up-to- date treatment we have seen of our work is that by Ivars Peterson in the February BioSci- ence. Even though Mr. Peterson visited our labs many months ago, he lined up experi- ments, concepts, and overviews with unusual skill and accuracy in one brief article. SIDNEY W. FOX Director Research Professor Institute for Molecular and Cellular Evolution Coral Gables, FL 33134 TAXONOMY IN DEUTERONOMY by David Fraser When God declared to Moses that the pig was out of season, It was not for trichinosis or some philanthropic reason. He'd simply had a second look at some of His creations, And found among them several taxonomic aberrations. An ungulate must have a cloven hoof, the Lord pronounced, And chew its dinner twice before the next meal is announced, But should it have a simple hoof, or fail to chew its cud, It falls outside the narrow lines of ungulatic blood. In likewise manner, said the Lord, the creatures of the air Should look on insects, fruit and seeds as their appointed fare, But those that feed on fish or flesh, they fall outside the system: All falcons, ospreys, crows and owls (and He went on to list them). The creatures of the sea, He said, and neighbours thereabout Should all be clad in scales and fins to keep the dampness out, But crab and lobster, squid and snails, though they may look delicious, And others without fins and scales-are foul, and not fishes. Now, Cain and Abel founded phenotypic variation, And Noah showed the wisdom of genetic preservation, But it was God himself who taught that taxonomic purity Depends on arbitrary groups and pentateuchal surety. David Fraser is an ethologist in Agriculture Canada's Animal Research Centre, Ottawa Cover Photographs The editors of BioScience are seeking photographs for consideration as jour- nal covers. All submissions should be addressed to Managing Editor, BioSci- ence, 1401 Wilson Blvd., Arlington, VA 22209. Photographs accepted for Bio- Science covers may be used in other institute publications. Technical requirements. Photo- graphs must be color transparencies of biological subjects. Although there are no restrictions on biological sub- ject matter, special consideration is given to unusual subjects (including photomicrographs and nonorganis- mic pictures) or unusual photograph- ic treatment of common subjects. Submissions must be of sufficiently high quality to be enlarged to accom- modate an 81/2 x 11" format. Vertical rather than horizontal mounts are bet- ter suited for covers. If available, it is requested that the following informa- tion accompany each photograph: camera used, focal plane of lens, f/stop, shutter speed, and film type; also, magnification and type of instru- ment, if appropriate. If an artificial light source was used, please specify. Caption. A brief caption must ac- company each photograph giving the following information: Genus and species of subject, description of sub- ject, where and/or how photograph was taken, natural habitat of subject (if different from where photograph was taken), and actual dimensions of subject (estimated if not known) or magnification. Policy. There are no restrictions as to the number of submissions accepted from one photographer nor the num- ber of covers selected from one pho- tographer. However, special effort is made to select as wide a variety of covers as possible within the con- straints of technical feasibility. Since the vast majority of submissions are from amateurs, BioScience does not provide remuneration for covers se- lected. K May 1985 - J 267</page></plain_text>
