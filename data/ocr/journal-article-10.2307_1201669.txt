<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Post-Modern Temper of Recent Literature: Nathan Scott on Art and Sacrament* Paul Schlueter / University of Evansville If any one person in the country can justly be credited with establishing the burgeoning interest in religion and literature, it is surely Nathan A. Scott, Jr., professor of theology and literature in the University of Chicago's Divinity School. For over twenty years he has steadily and regularly pro- duced essays, monographs, and books, and has in addition edited a number of volumes of essays by other scholars in the field. Altogether, his productivity has totaled some twenty or so volumes. But such a prolific output does not imply, as is so often the case with critics noted more for verbosity and volubility than with incisiveness and economy of expression, any super- ficiality or compromising of scholarly standards. Indeed, his amazing output is noted as much for profundity of thought, closely reasoned philosophical forays, and highly informed synthesizing of disparate sources as it is for sheer quantity. Hence the appearance of any new Scott volume, particularly the beautifully designed recent ones from Yale University Press, is an event to note with enthusiasm. True, most of the essays in these two volumes under review have appeared piecemeal in various journals over the last decade or two, but such original publication should not take away from the coherence their publication in book form allows us to note. For Scott's euvre is a remarkably consistent one, from Rehearsals of Discomposure, his first book (1952), to the present volumes, and as such, establishes a sustained critical theory and outlook that is already discovered to be a sufficiently rich field for young scholars to write their doctoral dissertations on. In a word, Scott has "arrived" in a way rarely possible for a scholar as young as he (he is now only in his late forties), and those of us who have followed his career expect that even more careful attention will be given to analysis of both his work in general and such individual volumes of his essays as Negative Capability and The Wild Prayer of Longing. Taking his cue from Keats's famous dictum, Scott in Negative Capability explores the gulf between what is usually called "modern" literature (the giants such as Eliot, Joyce, Kafka, Faulkner, Lawrence, Brecht, Yeats, Rilke, and so on) and its contemporary successor, manifested as it is in motion pictures, the "antinovel" found in contemporary France and others. That is, Scott maintains that the "modern" writers were imbued less by Keats's negative capability-" when a man is capable of being in uncer- * Nathan A.

For these more recent figures, according to Scott, "represent, generally, a firm disinclination to transfigure or to try to subdue or resolve what is recalcitrantly indeterminate and ambiguous in the human scene of our time" (p. xiv). The spiritual atmosphere is thus different from that of the previous generation of writers and their world, and Scott's observations in this volume range from a detailed consideration of such films as Resnais's, L'anne'e derniere a marienoad and such theoretical literary treatises as Robbe-Grillet's Pour un nouveau Roman to illustrate the difference. Indeed, the works of alitterature identified with Robbe-Grillet and his compatriots, although varying widely in purpose and intention, do manifest a particular thesis, that is, that traditional narrative literature "must be purged of the old 'stories,' the old structures of plot and character, the old eloquence" (p. io). Hence the order traditional verisimilitude imposes on human behavior falsifies the existential truth of contemporary life. Regardless of the art form under consideration, music, architecture, painting, or literature, I'actuelle, the "nowness" of the creative act today, emphasizes the work itself and in its own terms, not the alleged "meaning" or extrinsic dimension beyond itself; it simply is. Scott is surely right in this distinction (made in different ways by other critics as well), and in his citing as evidence contemporary film makers' efforts-the work of Antonioni, Godard, Fellini, Resnais-he merely corroborates what is gradually being felt on a popular level by the average moviegoer. That is, the alleged "meaninglessness" or incoherence of some of today's most significant films further supports Scott's contention about the distinction between the contrived "reality" of creative works from earlier in this century and the "primary reality" of the work qua work today. Scott illustrates this idea by a detailed examination of the Resnais film mentioned above (and with screenplay by Robbe-Grillet, a point which should not prove surprising in light of the foregoing remarks). But the traditionalist reaction to this unique brand of modernity, unable to accept the "deliberate depthlessness of a cultural style whose intent is to do nothing more than describe the appearances of the life-world" (p. 19), is irrascible and frustrated indeed. But there is a style and intent to such seemingly absurd works (again including both cinematic and literary efforts per se), even though, admittedly, many such works are creative cul-de-sacs, without any likely successors continuing where such works leave off. Scott says that inanity and innocuousness must both be avoided, and that those artists today most radically committed to l'actuelle are indeed aware of the intellectual content of what they produce, of the underlying idea enabling cinematic or literary coherence to be achieved. All this is not to say, as might be deduced from the foregoing, that the 10o5</page><page sequence="3">The Journal of Religion "modern" figures mentioned (Eliot et al.) were deficient in an open and honest confrontation with the pressures and beliefs of their day. Indeed, "knowing themselves to be disinherited of an effective metaphysical machin- ery for the ordering of experience, they proceeded to improvise into existence new systems of meaning and faith" (p. 30). Hence it is no surprise, Scott astutely observes, that the writings of such artists were uniquely appealing to theological interpreters of human creativity. One still feels, when one turns to the works of such writers, that they suggest essentially "some vast metaphor or parable about Time and Destiny, about History and the Human Prospect" (p. 31). Still, it is in the works of the "postmodern" writers in which Scott finds the greatest refusal to construct or impose a concretized order on the human reality, particularly in the dramatists and novelists but also in such other genres as poetry. In "The 'Conscience' of the New Literature," the second essay in this collection, Scott probes into the possi- bilities of his thesis by again citing in detail Robbe-Grillet's dictum in Pour un nouveau Roman which rejects the easy anthropomorphism of the earlier tradition. Since so much of this essay parallels and complements the points made in the previous one on l'actuelle, perhaps combining the two would have been more effective. But Scott goes beyond his French exemplars of this approach to offer some incisive comments about contemporary American novels, those by such writers as Barth, Pyncheon, Heller, Friedman, even Bellow. Noted especially is the utter breakdown of such traditionalist categories as the tragic and comic (where could one draw the line between these in The Adventures of Augie March or Catch-22 or V or The Floating Opera?). This "antiteleological art" (Scott uses Leonard Meyer's phrase) assumes a lack of meaning or goal in life, and therefore emphasizes improvisation, random patterns, and, in a word, the spontaneous incoherence of real life. Hence the theological critic, Scott suggests, must not fall easy prey to the temptation to reject such works as essentially sterile from a theological perspective; indeed, such critics should have learned from the lessons of Kafka in particular, whose sense of spiritual ambivalence and duality is especially relevant to Scott's discussion, namely, that the cultivation of a profound, unique kind of patience needs to be achieved. This patience-not surprisingly, similar to Keats's "negative capability"-is illustrated especi- ally well in Eliot's Four Quartets, which Scott considers in some detail. He concludes his discussion of the "conscience" of the New Literature by suggesting again that the dual imaginations of theology and literature are uniquely capable of appreciating and analyzing, simply because "both bear the marks of a post-modern temper" (p. 57), and "both seem to be guided by a conscience that tells the theologian and the artist that the burdened and perplexed people of our age are best served by being invited to be patient and to wait" for the unfolding of the Mystery of Being (pp. 57-58). io6</page><page sequence="4">Nathan Scott on Art and Sacrament Now, Scott acknowledges that today's creative artists admit to only one axiomatic principle, and that is that there are "no paradigms spacious enough to comprehend the human scene of our time, and that the work of art can therefore be little more than an illustration of the world's opaque mysteriousness and contingency" (p. 60). The literature seemingly most "contemporary" today is that which simultaneously rejects both Reality and Myth, terms Scott finds especially pregnant with meaning in considering the unique contribution of Martin Heidegger's thought. In a lengthy, closely reasoned exposition of Heidegger's concepts of " world " and meaning, Scott departs somewhat from literary models and examples. But his piercing analysis bears directly upon a more belletristic concern. For example, the artificial environment so pervasive today precludes the possibility that any " profound renewal of the human spirit will require that it unlearn its habit of approaching the world as something to be 'attacked,' in the manner of a scientific experiment or technological project" (pp. 67-68). Poetic art, because it enables man to become alert to the "concrete realities" of our world, confronts us with Being itself, not with supernatural gods, but with this godlessness not equivalent to Nietzsche's similarly worded premise. Scott admits that Heidegger's philosophic orientation does not bear directly on the contemporary writing he deals with elsewhere in Negative Capability. But such writers' ways of handling "human reality" avoid the kind of positive solutions found in traditional modernism. The works of Beckett, Burroughs, Robbe-Grillet, et al., "belong to a new tradition deeply informed by a sense of the world as so radically contingent and indeterminate as to prevent the artist's doing anything other than simply offering an illustration of the chaos" (p. 85). Hence waiting without hope (Scott cites Eliot's "East Coker" for the phrase) is all there can be. While this essay-entitled "The Literary Imagination in a Time of Dearth"--really concerns literature per se only obliquely, the philosophic grounding the essay provides is clearly requisite for any dialogue between theology and literature. "Poetry and Prayer," fourth of the six pieces in this book, derives its title from a work by the Abbe Henri Bremond; by "poetry" Scott means "simply all the high forms of literature that make fictions in such a way as to invite the mind to gaze, with radical amazement, into the depth of the human mystery" (p. 94). Hence poetic experience is "suffused, in its intensest modes, with an awareness of the world, in its concrete pheno- menality, as a sacrament of the divine immanence" (p. 103). Indeed, the word "salvation" comes to mind, Scott asserts, because this uniquely post- modern literature emphasized in the book has as its purpose the unsettling of those values we were taught and the probing into the innermost secrecy of our being. Scott dismisses Ortega's claim (in The Dehumanization of Art) that modern literature was "progressively moving away from the human"; indeed, Scott says, if anything is the case it is that no other period of writing 107</page><page sequence="5">The Journal of Religion has been so insistent and clear about its concern with the human dilemma. And one of the manifestations of this concern has been a willingness to depart from the established traditions of Christianity. Mircea Eliade's term "desa- cralization" is appropriately cited as especially applicable to modern man's spiritual plight. And the literature of our day necessarily posits a world with God absent. Scott says he hopes for a radically secular writing, since drastic departure from orthodox belief awakens sensitivities of other sorts, and may indeed bring us into radical contact with the very deity we thought had absented himself. In a word, Scott says, "poetic experience in our time may become a preparatio for prayer" (p. I i). The consistency of Scott's argument for "poetry and prayer" can easily be seen in "'Criticism and Theology-the Terms of the Engagement," originally included in his now out-of-print 1958 volume, Modern Literature and the Religious Frontier, and reprinted elsewhere as well as in this volume. Refuting Eliot's contention that the writer is not a thinker, Scott suggests that the writer's "beliefs" are not propositional arguments in a rational sense so much as "an imagination of what is radically significant" (p. I29; Scott's italics). A work of literature is not a polemic for any particular orthodoxy, religious or otherwise; hence in using such terms as "vision" and "belief," Scott means to suggest the religious dimension of such writing, something "intrinsic to and constitutive of the nature of literature as such" (p. 132). Tillich in particular supports this contention, and Scott, in quoting Tillich at some length, is careful not to suggest that the late theologian equated religion and culture. For the fact of the matter, again, is that the epochal writing of our century has invariably emerged outside the confines of the church. Indeed, if the church is to relate itself positively to the modern artist, it will have to do something other than declare its uniqueness and arbitrary regulations. Again citing Tillich, Scott says in concluding this essay that a " theogony," a "reunion of art and religion, if it is to occur at all," will necessarily have to spring from a willingness on the part of the church to recognize that the distinction between sacred and secular ceases to be a meaningful one. The final essay in Negative Capability, " On the Place of Litterae Humaniores in the Curriculum of Theological Studies," appeared originally in the University of Chicago Press volume edited by Scott, Adversity and Grace: Studies in Recent American Literature (1968), one of a series of eight volumes issued under the general title Essays in Divinity. Now, revised slightly, the essay seems even more relevant than in its earlier printed form simply because of its coherence, in its logical place as the culmination of a series of related essays exploring recent writing and the role of theological criticism, particularly as this criticism is systematized in the curricula of theological seminaries such as the University of Chicago's Divinity School. In a sense this essay is a rationale for Chicago's institution of this interdisciplinary io8</page><page sequence="6">Nathan Scott on Art and Sacrament study back in the early I950s. Indeed, it was felt then-prophetically, as it turned out, although now it is a common conception-that the great writings of our century hold unique importance both as literature and as a valid field for theological probings inasmuch as this literature is concerned essentially with "the soul's journey in search of God" (p. 161). Hence Chicago in pioneering the first concentrated work in theology and literature (leading to the M.A. and Ph.D degrees), moved out into new territory, although such courses are now common at many schools of theology, of whatever tradition they might be. The danger in such studies, Scott con- cludes, is that "formal theology will become something merely formal, and thus humanly superficial and irrelevant" (p. 167). Only literature, Scott maintains, can provide the "sharp awareness of its own variousness and breadth of possibility" needed by theology if it is to avoid an arid kind of pedantry. Hence the six essays in this book do constitute a consistent and generally coherent framework for Scott's probing into areas of mutual meaningfulness. Occasionally, however, the topicality and separate original history of the essays shows through, as when he takes pains more than once to explain Eliot's essay on Shakespeare and Seneca in which the claim that such writers do not think was first made; or in citing anew Robbe-Grillet's Pour un nouveau Roman in more than one place; some further revision might have avoided this redundancy of citation. And occasionally one longs for Scott's own well-turned phrases instead of too-frequent citations from others; as a remarkably well-read synthesist, however, he can range freely over a wealth of primary and secondary sources, appropriating what is needed here or there, and then proceed to tie such random quotations together with his own incisive, piercing analyses. This is not to say, however, that his approach is akin to "proof-texting" or clumsy efforts to make round literary works fit into square theological niches; rather, it is that Scott can see significant artistic achievements of our day from the dispassionate perspective of a systematic thinker keenly aware of theological currents and ideas applying to those literary works. What this provides is less a repository for sermonic illustrations (as theological criticism at its worst can become) than a careful, frequently brilliant philosophic perspective on belletristic achievements. For Scott is surely right, especially in a day such as ours in which the arti- ficiality and aesthetic distance so fondly maintained by littirateurs of a previous era is dismissed in favor of a sharp, sensitive awareness of the human condition and its vagaries. By contrast, to some extent, to the foregoing remarks is The Wild Prayer of Longing, an even more recent work by Scott. By contrast, that is, not in that the foregoing remarks about his clarity and acuteness of insight is less present, but rather in that the three long essays comprising this work (itself subtitled "Poetry and the Sacred ") are an integrally related series of lectures, Iog</page><page sequence="7">The Journal of Religion originally given at different times in different seminaries and universities and in obviously somewhat different form, but all nonetheless a coherent single essay. The distinction, I believe, is an important one: Most of Scott's books have been comprised of individual portions delivered or published piecemeal and then later brought together as one continuous work, whereas this one, representing as it does a sustained exploration of a single dominant idea, is so carefully reasoned that in some very significant ways it is Scott's most important work thus far. In citing the efforts by earlier literary critics, notably the German Roman- tics, to declare poetic art the "dictionary of a people's soul," Scott introduces the notion of the similar development of theological and literary art in more recent decades; that is, literature and theology today occupy a symbiotic relationship in which each illumines the other. But a change nonetheless has occurred in their interaction, a development Scott calls the "Decline of Figuralism." Now figura, Scott notes, implied model or copy or image in Latin writing, and in more recent epochs frequently implied an exegetical purpose in biblical or literary scholarship. And despite its datedness, Scott (citing Erich Auerbach) says the concept offigura "presents us with one of the most crucial keys for unlocking the whole sense of reality which prevailed throughout the Western community almost until.. . the Enlightenment'" (p. 4). And not only were literary works explained through such figuralist means, but biblical events too were seen as parts of a story concluding with the Last Judgment and other apocalyptic events. This implies a kind of immediacy and historicity not present, say, in epic heroes of the Greek tradition, who seem relatively unconcrete compared with Abraham, Moses, and others of the Judaic tradition. Auerbach argues, Scott says, for a dual- istic way of thinking in the Greek scheme of things, a distinction between levels of style determined by the human levels from which the artist chooses his subjects. Hence the basic sensibility of the Greek mind allows for a broader scope of human endeavor and reality than the single-minded Hebrew concept of every man's capability of contacting the infinite. And the coherence and singleness of vision shared by the Hebrew writers was relatively in- separable from man's everyday life, with the sublime and mundane equated. If anything, this monolithic sense of vision was perpetuated during the Christian era, with an even greater use of biblical myths to serve asfigura of a deeper significance. Scott cites Dante's use of the historical Virgil as figural because of his moral qualities which fit him for purposes of leadership and guidance (though surely it is also true that Virgil is cited, as John Ciardi and others have suggested, because of his curiously prophetic picture in his Fourth Eclogue of a god-man not unlike Jesus). But not only is it true, Scott says, that figuralism's premises imply "the possibility of one worldly event being interpreted through another; it also implies that historical existence itself is a figura" (p. 9). The continuum of IIO</page><page sequence="8">Nathan Scott on Art and Sacrament history posits a unity of outlook, a tentativeness "consequent upon their being related to something that is dark and concealed, to something which has been promised but which is not yet present" (p. 9). Now, although these terms are Auerbach's, Scott takes them somewhat further than Auerbach in suggesting that figuralism intrinsically contained its own means of dis- solution, and indeed one of the consequences of Renaissance thought in such writers as Rabelais was a multiplicity of existence wholly outside medieval figuralism. And Enlightenment writers even further halted vestigial fig- uralism; although usually moralistic in outlook, the gradual "expulsion of the Transcendent" continued in their works. Scott's consideration of the nineteenth century further suggests the diminishing of the figural awareness; Nietzsche's awareness of the nihilistic thrust of some of the major continental novels of the century clearly shows that the "elemental human condition is not one of man's being in dialogue with the world, but is rather a situation in which man confronts a universe which is alien, in the sense of its being a system of objective facts or forces essentially unrelated to the human presence itself" (p. 15)- Now, the modern consciousness, according to Scott, depends even further on a sense of man's "standing over against the world as that which is 'out there,' from which he is separated, between which and himself there is an ineluctable distance" (p. 16; Scott's italics). Man is thus detached from the world, outside the "objective" universe, and so no dialogue between the artist and the reality of the world can occur unless the artist impersonally suspends judgment, even removes himself from his artistic accomplishment. Hence the Realistic Irony: "the fact-world proves to be ultimately uncon- tainable within the framing structure of art" (p. 18), and the artist therefore emphasizes the world within, the subconscious. Poetry thus becomes "the necessary angel," the only way man can confront the alien world around him. Now, either of two principles, Scott declares, guides modern literature: the Realistic Fallacy (Erich Heller's term) or the Angelic Fallacy (Allen Tate's adaptation of Jacques Maritain's term). Under the influence of the former, the world is "out there," factual, but in no way a figura of any importance. Under the influence of the latter term, however, we see a deep disenchantment about the possiblity of "ever realizing what Realism seeks in its effort at mastery of the fact-world" (p. 20). Under either "fallacy," however, a literature lacks a "sacramental vision of existence, for the decisive development to which it bears witness is the death of the figural imagination" (p. 21). Both presuppose man's facing a "self-enclosed and unresponsive world" so that our encounter with it is an encounter with death. Such a lengthy synopsis of Scott's essay to this point is necessary, I believe, because of the closely reasoned synthesis of history and myth comprising the first twenty or so pages of this essay. It means for one thing that man faces III</page><page sequence="9">The Journal of Religion the world alone, he alone is responsible for his world, the gods have been dethroned, the world is "defiguralized." Hence the basic religious question of our day, the dilemma so perplexing to modern man, is the blankness of the external world leading inexorably and solely into an inward selfhood wholly divorced from any awareness of intimacy with the transcendent world. A "faceless mechanism," however, is intolerable; thus man attempts to rehumanize his environment, hoping for a reciprocity in which man both gives and takes and in which he is more than mere spectator. Citing the anthropologist Claude L6vi-Strauss, Scott suggests that man of whatever state, primitive or sophisticated alike, needs a "cognitive grasp of reality which is won by practical grapplings with the world" (p. 27). Indeed, the rebirth of interest in a "savage" world in the arts today is a search for "ways of reconceiving the human universe as a world which offers the promise and possibility of life under the law of participation" (P.3'). Today, for example, the "Happenings" sometimes held imply an innovative, spontaneous acceptance of experience in which traditional genres are combined. A Happening by definition demands involvement, not mere voyeuristic spectating. Indeed, the antecedents of Happenings include the theater of the absurd in which the audience is drawn into an experience in which what is "here" and what is "out there" are practically eliminated. Scott suggests that an "imagistic rendering of experience" (he does not mean the poetic school of H. D. Aldington et al.) is especially prominent in much of this century's literature in which "reality" (not the same as "realism") is sought. But this implies even further the loss of the figural imagination; is it possible, Scott asks in concluding this essay, that there exists a world that can be experienced as "indwelt by holiness" and therefore susceptible to "sacra- mental appropriation " (p. 41) ? Man cries out for more than dead mechanism; he yearns for the sacramental pattern embodying a unified relationship between ourselves and the world, a relationship Scott calls the "sacramental vision." Now, mankind today is admittedly an urban animal, and the frequent cry of depersonalization implicit in an urban-jungle environment necessarily defines the ways in which the human endeavor is experienced. True, the traditional distrust of the religious world toward the urban culture is mani- fested on the most superficial level by the lemming-like race to the suburbs by many of today's cosmopolitan churches. But the metropolis, Scott says, is our "historical fate" (p. 45), and nostalgic yearnings for an allegedly simpler past cannot suffice as an alternative to urban adaptation. In literary expressions of the relationship of man to the city, however, "the literary imagination finds most expensive" the "city's enclosure of man in a world of artifacts, a world of his own creation in which, wherever he turns, he beholds nothing other than extensions of his own image" (p. 47). Thus the city becomes a symbol of unreality and illusion, with men experiencing II2</page><page sequence="10">Nathan Scott on Art and Sacrament their own humanity "as simply the product of the great machine of the social collectivity, and life everywhere seems to have the aspect of something gratuitous and arbitrary, for it seems universally to be a consequence of human artifice" (p. 47). Scott suggests that an "ennui of the human" (p. 48) afflicts urban man, and thus it is all the more necessary for man to be able to conceive experience sacramentally. The slipperiness of the term "sacrament" is acknowledged by Scott, and does not mean merely what its traditional ecclesiastical sense implies. His definition-" that certain objects or actions or words or places belonging to the ordinary spheres of life may convey to us a unique illumination of the whole mystery of our existence, because in these actions and realities... something 'numinous' is resident, something holy and gracious" (p. 49)-is a workable and accurate one. The sacramental principle has the power to break down the distinctions between the sacred and the commonplace, with the sacramental elements (e.g., as in the eucharist) themselves symbolic of this unity. The work of art, furthermore, is itself a sacramental entity in that it derives from its Divine Maker; it is the machina ex deo. But the very con- cept of God is so elusive to those whose education has been primarily technical and mechanical that, Scott says (but not wholly convincingly), atheism today seems anachronous indeed. Those philosophical and theological traditions that have resisted the anthropomorphic fallacy reaffirm the encompassing reality of the universe, the "shook foil" Hopkins spoke of. If diversity and variation are implicit in the "unity of the Divine," then pantheism is futile, contrasted with the sense of "multiplicity of finite existence and the unity of the Divine are not ultimately discontinuous" (p. 58). This multiplicity and unity, called by Scott "panentheism," is not a unitary philosophic tradition, but it has been a persistent vision and one especially notable today. Scott illustrates this premise by a lengthy exposition of Heidegger best read in conjunction with the similar treatment in Negative Capability. Heidegger, Scott says, pursued the "last objective" of the philosophic imagination, Being itself, the "voice" of which is heard only when man approaches the world in the spirit of surrender, abandonment, acquiescence (p. 67), a way of "receiving" the world, based on a different idea of rationality than usually prevails in our culture. The purpose of Being in Heidegger, Scott continues, is to "establish the possibility of presence for all particular beings" (p. 7o; Scott's italics); but Being is ultimately indefinable, inseparable from quantitative inquiries about realities such as the "whatness" of an object. Heidegger does not equate Being with the "God of classical theism, nor is it to assert the existence of a 'God' behind or beyond the phenomenal world" (p. 72). So, Scott concludes, "in a technological culture such as our own, where the world is so constantly approached with an intention to manipulate and convert to use, the great besetting affliction, as Heidegger says, is 'forgetfulness' of Being" (p. 74). Hence the world's II3</page><page sequence="11">The Journal of Religion sacramentality is freshly suggested by the culture of our day, and among many other artists also suggestive of "sacramentation," Scott finds the work of the poet Theodore Roethke especially fruitful to examine. Now, Roethke's tormented life is well enough known so that only the briefest acknowledgemnt of the chaos he sensed in existence need be noted here. The sheer primal vitality and energy he reflected both in his life and, more importantly, in his writing can be seen in most considerations of his poetic genius. His search for coherence and meaning in a fragmented universe did not, as one might have expected, result in an intellectualization of life so much as a seeking after a spontaneous acceptance of the myriad varieties of possibility the chaos presented him. As Denis Donoghue once observed of Roethke's late verse, " The only knowledge is reason in madness." Hence Scott in citing Roethke as of paramount importance, not merely to support his thesis about art as sacrament but even more as a poetic guide to our own spirit and imagination in an increasingly inchoate world, makes a most judicious choice: more than with most poets of our day, Roethke had a sacramental vision of the world. Citing the late Philip Wheelwright's four ways of considering the imagination, Scott notes that the confrontative and archetypal best warrants the label "sacramental," even though this mode has been relatively ignored in our day. And Roethke, for Scott, offers the one "crucial instance of a sacramental vision of our human inheritance" (p. 8o). Roethke's praise of the world and the life contained therein was an intuitive sense of awesome vitality (not to be confused with mere animalism) in which the world "sings." And this intuitional sense rested upon the awareness that "both the human and the nonhuman modes of existence are animated and empowered by some primal reality, which may be denom- inated simply as Being itself" (p. 85). In thus invoking Heidegger's term, Scott does not merely force Roethke into a theological mode he uncomfortably is made to occupy, but rather catches hold of the quality so often reflected in Roethke's verse, a vision of the world in which all " earthly reality is invested with a power and presence and is touched with a kind of glory that makes it man's principal obligation to offer, in turn, a humble pietas" in response (p. 87). In citing Roethke's lines, Though dancing needs a master, I had none To teach my toes to listen to my tongue, Scott does not merely suggest an echoing of Yeats, but, even more so, the way in which Roethke's "unaided imagination" helped him to grapple with life and all its wonders. Through a judicious citation of relevant lines from Roethke's verse, and an even more judicious linking and comparing lines from various periods of Roethke's artistic life, Scott is able to suggest that the earth for Roethke is an orderly awareness of the reciprocal communication shared by the human II4</page><page sequence="12">Nathan Scott on Art and Sacrament spirit and the creatures of that world. Hence sanctity for Roethke is "plotting for more than oneself, for the care of the good earth, in order that things might simply be what their entelechies intend that they shall be" (p. 94). Roethke necessarily drew from the world of his childhood, in which, as a youngster in Michigan, he early learned from the greenhouse world of his father that human beings achieve their "identity of selfhood" in an evolu- tionary manner. Roethke himself suggested that the poet should speak in a "psychic shorthand" and work intuitively in the creative process, and Scott suggests that this "shorthand" comprised a Jungian journey from "the night of unconsciousness into the day of awareness and comprehension" (p. 99). Roethke said that "everything that lives is holy," and had as his poetic intention an invoking of these " holy forms of life." Thus, in his own verse, by drawing upon mundane natural creatures, he felt he was calling on God. Not that there is any necessary identity between the form of nature and the Deity; Roethke's concept was not a shallow pantheism, for his "minute particulars," Scott says, are "never swallowed up in some vast encircling unity in which all diversity and distinction are ultimately annulled" (p. o103). For Roethke responds to the world in a "reverential astonishment and wonder-at the marvelous fecundity and amplitude wherewith the things of earth are steadied and exalted, and by which they manage to last" (pp. o104-5). True, Roethke's universe is somewhat constricted, with large topics and human concerns wholly absent; his sacramental principle is not carried to the limit one would wish it were. But his love poems in particular are sensitive celebrations of vitality and unsullied desire. And even love must give way to the final victor, death, as was also reflected in his poetry. Scott analyzes brilliantly both themes as they are reflected in the verse, and suggests further that man experiences reality by not insisting upon too much reality (p. 115). Hence Roethke was "happy" in the sense in which his conviction about life and Being and thanks was eloquently expressed in numerous poems. And while Roethke's sacramentation may not, as Scott concludes, have gone far enough (since it was more at ease with the nonhuman than the human modes of reality), he did have a keen sense of the basic premise of sacramentation, that is, that "nothing may be a sacrament unless every- thing is, at bottom, sacramental, and that ours may be considered to be a sacramental universe because, in its every aspect and dimension, it is instinct with that which appears to be for man rather than against him-which is none other than Being itself" (pp.I17-I8; Scott's italics). Now, this lengthy a summary and commentary on Scott's approach in these two books is necessary to suggest the careful reading he demands of the reader. Admittedly, much of these two books is philosophically dense and closely reasoned. But such philosophic excursions I will have to leave to the philosophers; suffice it for now to say that Scott is at his literary best when, as in his lengthy examination of Theodore Roethke's poetry, he II5</page><page sequence="13">The Journal of Religion reads closely and deeply into the ultimate meaning of a writer's expression. The essay on Roethke, in a word, is a brilliant examination of Roethke's poetry, one of the finest I know of and well worth considering solely by itself. But Scott's exegesis is not wholly a New Critical consideration of the text qua text; he orients the reader into profundities of thought in which literary exemplars and theological speculations are brought coherently together, and consequently illumines both spheres of insight. The Wild Prayer of Longing, as I observed earlier, may well be Scott's most significant book yet; surely it is his most sustained single consideration of a single dominant concern, poetry and the sacred, and as such provides one of the best examples of theological-literary criticism ever written. This is not to diminish Negative Capability so much as to suggest that the more recent book systematically follows one relevant issue from its philosophic underpinnings through to an excellent creative illustration of the points raised, while in Negative Capa- bility, Scott brings together disparate essays with a common foundation and ties them together, generally but not wholly coherently, into a single treatise. Hence whatever future course theology-and-literature may take as a common concern with the issues of faith and art in a "world gone awry," to use an earlier term of Scott's, it is absolutely essential that Scott, as the foremost philosophical mind at work today in theology and literature, be given a very careful reading. And no better way of doing this can be found, I believe, than in these two most recent works of his. Both are excellent, and The Wild Prayer of Longing is especially seminal and far reaching in its implications for future study of both religion and art. 116</page></plain_text>
