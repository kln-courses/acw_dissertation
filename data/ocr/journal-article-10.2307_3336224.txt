<plain_text><page sequence="1">research notes A LIFE-SIZED ANTHROPOMORPHIC FIGURE FROM NORTHERN NIGERIA I am submitting this photograph of a slightly less than life-sized shrine figure that I saw in an Afo village of Nasarawa division, Plateau State, in the hope that another reader may be able to furnish comparative data from elsewhere on the north bank of the Benue or the surrounding region. (To clear up a confu- sion regarding nomenclature, only one Afo village nowadays retains the ethnic label "Eloyi." The village and district of the figure described here are omitted to reduce the pos- sibility of theft.) So far I have been unable to uncover contemporary evidence of similarly large-scale figure sculpture among either the Afo or their neighbors. While monumental mud figures of lions and bush-cows are very common in the area, they appear to share little with this Egba shrine figure except the scale and the incorporation of horns. The most important difference is that this figure is carved. Despite its being fully clothed, this is evident from the exposed hands and feet. (It would also be virtually im- possible to clothe a mud figure in a tight knit- ted suit, or to maintain such a posture without supports.) According to the shrine priest, it is completely carved, including scarification patterns, but I was unable to verify this as it is never seen unclothed except by him. (It may also be that the figure is made of more than one material, but it was not possible to exam- ine it closely.) Its masquerade costume, which strongly resembles the Inaloko masquerade owned by the same village quarter, is belted and sashed, with a clasp of ayigbe (Abrus precatorius) seeds and cowries. A red dcloth forms the base for a pair of antelope horns, which are an impor- tant emblem of power in all Afo sculpture. Animal skins drape the legs of the seated figure. Used in annual fertility ceremonies during the dry season, the Egba figure imper- sonates the original founder of the cult and is said to have been carved by Ewa Oshugu in the last century The costume itself (with the exception of the clasp) is a recent replacement. Colonial sources on the Afo are very in- adequate, but the following extract from an Assessment Report on Loko District, written in 1918, suggests that a large-scale figure tradi- tion did exist: "The Afo make mud models, sometimes of nearly life-size, of male figures in sitting posture. . . hands are uplifted with open palms, the fingers turned back toward the shoulders in the classical attitude of sup- plication" (W. Morgan, ADO, Keffi. Agency mark K3232, National Archives, Kaduna). The interesting question is then whether the present figure was a one-of-a-kind depar- ture from that prototype, or whether there existed a parallel tradition of monumental sculpture in wood.
