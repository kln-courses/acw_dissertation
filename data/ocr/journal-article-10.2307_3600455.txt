In 1985 Radical Philosophy published a reader drawn from material which had appeared in the journal since its inception in the early 1970s.1 Stretching to over four hundred pages, its contents were divided into five categories: 'Philosophers', 'Marxism and Social Science', 'Morality and Politics', 'Philosophy and Gender', and a final section called 'Confrontations', which looked at various manifestations of conservativism in contemporary politics and philosophy. Not one of the essays addressed questions of culture or art or could be described as a contribution to philosophical aesthetics; moreover, in their introduction, the editors Roy Edgely and Richard Osborne did not even think it worthwhile to note why such matters were missing from the collection. How things have changed. Open the pages of Radical Philosophy today and one would be surprised not to find an article on some aspect of the debate on philosophy and culture and the political contribution of philosophical aesthetics to con- temporary philosophy. This is a seismic shift, and is the result of a number of political and institutional factors that are now more or less familiar in the transformation of the intellectual culture of the left and philosophy in the late 1980s and 1990s: the political demise of an 'objectivist' Marxism as the primary terrain on which philosophy's pursuit of truth and value is contested;2 the global reception of post-Structuralism as the would-be political denaturalisation of this objectivism; the rise (and rise) of post-Frankfurt School critical theory as a critique of the academic restriction of philosophy to forms of logical and methodological self-scrutiny; and finally the general enculturalisation of philosophy and political theory in the West under the cross-disciplinary impact of cultural studies and the growing post-philosophical critique of academic philosophy itself. Indeed, once you also factor in the widespread diffusion of philosophical aesthetics and post- Structuralist theory through the international artworld in the 1990s, contemporary philosophy has seen an extraordin- ary increase in professional philosophers shifting their specific concern with 'ethics', 'politics', or 'language' into the sphere of aesthetic enquiry. In short, the cultural function of twentieth-century continental philosophy has 174 OXFORD ART JOURNAL 26.1 2003</page><page sequence="2">Reviews spread its influence well beyond its own specialist and institutional domain, particularly in the English-speaking world. As one of the editors of the Radical Philosophy editorial collective since the mid nineteen-eighties, Peter Osborne has been a key participant in and commentator on these changes in Britain. Indeed, his own trajectory as a philosopher has followed a familiar intellectual pattern in the 1980s and 1990s: an early concern with political philosophy and socialist theory, but more recently an engagement with post-Kantian philosophy as a reflection on, and intervention into, theories of cultural form and artistic practice. Yet, if Osborne has dropped the political philosophy, he is no political conservative or invoker of a weak, post-rational philosophising. Osborne's turn to cultural theory and the legacy of philosophical aesthetics remains, crucially, a political and metaphysical project and can be seen therefore as an attempt to re-engage philosophy's universal claims on truth, value, and meaning in relation to contemporary cultural problems and questions. This, effectively, places his work in opposition to two convergent-and currently dominant-intellectual tenden- cies. On the one hand, the post-philosophical move within philosophy after deconstructionism into cultural studies, and, on the other, the critical ecumenicalism or opportunism of Cultural Studies-As-Theory-the melangist approach to theoretical production, or what one critical sociologist has called 'attitude pluralism'.3 His work, then, is indebted to sustaining a particular philosophical tradition of systematic engagement (or rather in Osborne's case systematic 'post-systematic' engage- ment) with cultural form and artistic practice against the anti- metaphysical relativism of both post-philosophising philo- sophy and cultural studies. In this respect, as a polemicist for a philosophically engaged theory of cultural form and artistic practice, he is not just defending the legacy of philosophy as cultural theory in continental philosophy (Husserl, Heidegger, Benjamin, Adorno, Gadamer) where the philosophy of modern culture has its origins. Osborne may owe a major intellectual debt to Benjamin, and a lesser one to Adorno, but not to the idea of critical theory as a morally superior competitor to cultural studies. Unlike a number of his peers, Osborne has not taken up the Heideggerian or Weberian route via critical theory into philosophical aesthetics. Rather, what Osborne seeks to recover, in the name of a philosophised cultural theory, is a critical engagement with the problems and contingencies of contemporary art and visual culture as the means by which a defence of modernism, in the wider sense, is to be sustained-a position, of course, defended by Benjamin and Adorno. Contra Heidegger and Weber, the aporiai of the cultural present is always in potentia a moment of openness to other rationalities, meanings, ways of being. In this way Osborne is not only very conscious of the dephilosophised and reified terrain of mainstream cultural studies, but also how embedded Benjamin and Adorno have themselves become today in a ossified notion of critical theory as critique, or in the case of Benjamin, in some 'depoliticised' and classicising history of the modern. Hence, at some deeper level his project marks a return to the examination of the conditions for the possibility of rational enquiry and historical knowledge, in particular Marx's introduction to the Grundrisse: knowledge is not the unmediated largesse of tradition, but the result of an experimental interdiscipinarity within systems of open enquiry, and therefore at some important level the work of critical translation and conver- gence. This speculative metaphysical interdisciplinarity is the subject and outcome of one recently authored book and two edited books by Osborne: Philosophy in Culture Theory (2000), Conceptual Art (2002), and From an Aesthetic Point of View (2000). Philosophy in Culture Theory consists of essays on philosophy and cultural theory, theories of sign and image, the temporal dynamics of modernism, the textual form of the Communist Manifesto, temporality and the artwork, conceptual art, and Jean Laplanche's psycho- analysis. Conceptual Art consists of a short genealogy of conceptual art, paying particular attention to the limits of conceptual art's critique of the category 'aesthetics'; and From an Aesthetic Point of View is a short collection of essays on aesthetics and form drawn from a conference at Middlesex University in 1998 entitled 'Where Theory Ends, There Art Begins'. This has an introduction from Osborne and essays from Sylviane Aganinski, David Batchelor, Jay Bernstein, Howard Caygill, Alexander Garcia DOttman, Christoph Menke, Mandy Merck, Jacques Ranciere, and Jonathan R6e, and largely covers the same theme as Conceptual Art: the idea that the aesthetic is a constitutive experience of art, that is, something that the judgement of art is always called back to take account of. For Osborne, art (quite rightly) is not the same thing as aesthetics, but neither does this mean that the aesthetic is that which deproblematises or desensitises the socio-economic recep- tion of art. Art transcends the claims of the aesthetic in the realm of meaning, but aesthetics detemporalises the facticity of meaning by placing it in the sphere of judgement. This does not mean, thereby, that matters of judgement are spontaneous, but, on the contrary, that judgement is always already cognitively tied to the conceptual and historical, opening up the theorisation of value to those knowledges from which the work derives its social formation and identity. Interdisciplinarity, then, so to speak, is at the centre of the interpretative claims on aesthetic value and as such the force of art's cultural reception. The judgement of art, the category of aesthetics, and the cognitive claims of art's cultural reception flow into each other. The theoretical defence of these claims for a speculative interdisciplinarity is confined, however, primarily to Philo- sophy in Culture Theory, the most ambitious of the three books; elsewhere it is left at the level of suggestiveness and inference. On the basis of this, therefore, I want to look principally at Osborne's philosophical model of cultural theory in Philosophy in Culture Theory, because it is here we can get a clearer sense of what is stake in the post-Kantian OXFORD ART JOURNAL 26.1 2003 175</page><page sequence="3">Reviews philosophical critique of cultural studies and the relationship between the histories of art (that Osborne has least familiarity with) and cultural studies themselves. Cultural Studies and Pragmatism Contemporary cultural studies is notoriously indifferent to questions of ontology and epistemology, trading invariably on a non-doctrinal methodological pluralism in which the creativity of different research programmes is valued more than any claims to unified theory or metaphysical system. In this respect, its understanding of value and truth is embedded within a post-epistemological theory of know- ledge: what is good is what fits, what fits is what is good for me. Yet this anti-foundationalist pluralism is rarely acknow- ledged and defended as a philosophical system: on the contrary, cultural studies treats the issue of metatheoretical justification as a distraction from the business of building theories, and, as such, something which stops interpretative creativity in its tracks. Thus, in one of the most ambitious recent defences of cultural studies, Tony Bennett's Culture: A Reformer's Science (1998), questions of value and critique are roundly dumped in favour of the translation of cultural practice into a set of social administrative and managerial strategies. What is important, Bennett argues, are the 'kinds of practical effects cultural studies might intelligibly aspire to'4 and not its 'resistive credentials'.5 Nowhere does Bennett expose this commitment to cultural studies as a theory of the practically demonstrable to any kind of philosophical scrutiny. Osborne does not mention Bennett by name, but it is this kind of thinking which he sees as endemic to contemporary cultural studies: the unwillingness to ground the theorisation of culture in anything more than a pluralist accommodation to the immediate vagaries of use. The salient point for Osborne, however, is not that the metaphysical ambitions of post-Kantian philosophy have no use for the category of the practical, but that the notion of the practical here is tied to a vast and undisclosed philosophical system which makes of 'use' a merely conjunctural and contingent commitment: the philosophy of pragmatism. And it is precisely pragmatism, the big baggy monster of non-systematic philosophy, that Osborne sees as the hidden mover of contemporary cultural studies. As he says: 'Pragmatism is the philosophical unconscious of post- Marxist cultural studies'. Pumped up with an insistence on the immediate and practically demonstrable, truth gets reduced to what is good by way of belief, leading to a philosophical debouchment of value and history. 'Politics becomes the enactment of a semiotic version of a Nietzschian voluntarism';6 'the concrete is reduced to the conjunctural; the conjunctural is reduced to the contingent';7 and art is dissolved into a form of post-avant-garde social democratic conviviality. Hence, by intervening in cultural studies against its undisclosed philosophical grounds Philosophy in Cultural Theory sets cultural theory a primary task: to dislodge the theorisation of the contemporary from its over reliance on 'presentism' and historicism. But if pragmatism is criticised by Osborne as the anti- philosophical virus at the heart of cultural theory, the concept itself, strangely, is not treated as the ideological enemy. Indeed, despite denouncing pragmatism for the sins of 'presentism', 'conjuncturalism', 'voluntarism', 'histori- cism', and worse, Osborne sets out thereafter to recover its good name. This makes Philosophy in Cultural Theory an intriguing, if not perplexing, intervention. Because, although the debate is set up in such a way as to recover a rationalist, systematic, and metaphysical presence for philosophy in cultural theory, Osborne does not take the expected or usual route: some version of Hegelian Marxism or critical realism. The outcome is a translation of a number of the thematics of Marxism and critical realism as systemic philosophies into an anti-systemic setting, without quite addressing the question of realism as such. In fact, if pragmatism is the unconscious of cultural studies, the fortunes of critical realism are the unconscious of Philosophy in Cultural Theory. I will come to this discussion of realism in a moment. For now, it is important to clarify what Osborne actually means by pragmatism and the complex history of the term, because so much of what Osborne claims for a speculative metaphysical interdisciplinarity rests on this concept. In attacking the post-philosophical theorising of cultural studies, Osborne takes his distance from the William James- John Dewey-Richard Rorty line of pragmatism. For James- the originator of the notion of truth as that which is good by way of belief-theories become instruments of practical application and not 'answers to enigmas'8: 'The new idea is truest which performs most felicitously'.9 In Dewey this is given an activist bias. It is better for philosophy to make mistakes in 'living struggles'10 than to sustain any formal and logical self-sufficiency. Thus, if in James the idea of the true is that which makes itself true by the way it works, in Dewey the idea of the true is the contingent outcome of happenstance. Since the 1980s, these 'genial' strategies (James)" have been transformed and codified by Rorty into a replete and assertive post-philosophical pragmatism. Indeed, Rorty's gung-ho pragmatism, sharpened as it is by thirty formative years of Cartesian-Lockean-Kantian defence of philosophy, has today become the most likely candidate for the (unconscious) role of philosophical labourer for the new post-Marxist cultural studies. Truth is not the purpose of philosophical inquiry: 'The purpose of inquiry is to achieve agreement among human beings about what to do, to bring about consensus on the ends to be achieved.'12 This means that claims to objectivity are simply another way of saying you have reached an acceptable level of intersubjective agreement. As such, following Dewey, Rorty asserts that rather than asking whether ideas represent reality, we should ask whether they promote good habits for ameliora- tive social action. Rorty is frank about the social democratic content of this model, and as such makes no bones about its complete indifference to veridical definitions of truth. Osborne's distaste for this latter-day post-metaphysics is palpable and correct. This tradition of pragmatism is politically indeterminate, anthropomorphic, anti-totalising, 176 OXFORD ART JOURNAL 26.1 2003</page><page sequence="4">Reviews and therefore scientifically derationalising. As Osborne says, 'pragmatism abdicates from the vocation of modern philo- sophy as critique'.13 This leaves a theory of knowledge without the constraints of rational belief evidence and justification, and as such creates a politics and cultural politics without diremption and disagreement. Given these fundamental weaknesses, then, it is surprising that Osborne wants to recover another pragmatism, indeed, one that he feels has been misrepresented within the pragmatist tradition itself: C. S. Peirce's rationalist pragmatism. Peirce, the actual coiner of the term pragmatism-or what he called, awkwardly, pragmaticism-is judged by Osborne to resist these omissions. For Peirce it is the constraints of reality which ultimately ground intersubjective agreement, and therefore the character of the practical orientation of our ideas to the world. And this is where the confusion has arisen over Peirce's would-be 'post-rational' status within the pragmatist tradition.14 Peirce acknowledges that mean- ing is distinct from reference (is infinite), but he also recognises that meaning's relation to the practical orienta- tion of our ideas is nevertheless causally tied to the exigencies of reference, its capacity to capture 'what is true to a given state of affairs'. Peirce's model, therefore, is sensitive to the demands of reference on meaning. It is the epistemological implications of this that the James-Dewey- Rorty pragmatism disregards: the fact that one vocabulary or theory might actually be a better way of improving our understanding of the transfactual structures of nature and the social. Hence what draws Osborne to Peirce is the notion that the practical orientation of our ideas to the world are experimental and fallible, and that our claims to truth are tested in practice as the basis for our representation of reality. Neither of these realist propositions could be said to be unfamiliar territory on the left. As Roy Bhaskar has argued in his critique of Rorty: 'Why cannot knowledge be both a device for representing reality and a reality in which we live and move? Why cannot knowledge have vertical and horizontal components, reveal depth and change?'15 So, why does Osborne need Peirce and pragmatism to mediate these issues rather than, say, critical realism or a dialectical-Hegelian version of Marxism, where debates on the experimental status of science and theories of reference are far more politically efficacious than they are in Peirce? Indeed Peirce seems to function in the text as metonymic stand-in for critical realism and Marx, a kind of new-born cipher for the anti-positivistic horizons of experimental theorisation for our would-be post-Marxist times. Yet Peirce, for all his strengths, is no Marx, nor a Roy Bhaskar for that matter. So why Peirce for cultural theory? Well, firstly, Osborne wants an argument with the dominant (anti-realist) semiological code-model of cultural studies, and not with the methodological implications of realism for cultural studies, and clearly Peirce is an ideal candidate for this. Because Peirce's pragmatist notion of infinite semiosis functions as a background resource for new practical relations to be tested in the world, the relationship between language and epistemology is not used to fend off the metaphysical truth-claims of statements. The production of meaning, therefore, is at all times an 'existential' act, that is, a wager on reference and truth. This is why Peirce for Osborne has important implications for cultural analysis and critique. Interpretation is not just a form of textual decoding, but a process grounded in the production of subjectivity, of meaning-generating selves. Interpretation is 'also about the formation of subjects as practical, embodied, technologi- cally organized structures of experience'.16 And this is exactly what Osborne prizes in Benjamin's Marxist criticism: the critique of the Kantian separation between 'pure reason' and 'practical reason'; although importantly, of course, in Benjamin the production of knowledge is never identical to the concept of truth, that is, knowledge and truth are never exactly coeval given the openness of history and therefore the historical relativity of knowledge. The commitment to truth always involves a claim on an emancipated future and as such the claims to knowledge are always regulated against the ontological standpoint of history as an unfulfilled whole. This is why, for Benjamin, the emancipatory content of historical materialism's interpretative field is not bound simply to the fashioning of images of progress, but to the negation of the present as the memory of this unfulfilled whole, placing the weight of interpretation on practices of historical redemption and reinscription which shatter the stabilising and amnesiac ideologies of the present. Thus for Osborne, Peirce's attractiveness lies in the fact that his theory of semiosis is able to operate as a philosophical mentor for Benjamin's metaphysics. Peirce's philosophy is also able to underwrite a theory of praxis in cultural theory that does not reduce meaning in use to 'presentism': meaning can be put to work non-positivistically and futurally. As Osborne says, Peirce's theory of 'rational meaning belongs to the domain of virtuality, imaginative possibility, not mere actuality'.17 These points all represent some commitment to critical realist themes on Osborne's part; representation must be about something other than itself; reference is not presupposed by the positive presence of things, such as cats, computers, and tables, it can also allude to 'non-existent' things such as powers, tendencies, relations, totalities; negative critique is a condition for positive being-there can be no universal conditions of emancipation without the absenting of an unwarranted absence; and knowledge is experimentally grounded and historically relative.18 Yet because these themes are put to a defence of pragmatism, the critical cast of Osborne's writing becomes strained, given that, first, Peirce cannot do the kind of political work on behalf these points in cultural theory, that critical realism and post-Benjaminian Marxism can; and second, if pragmatism is so mired its own contradictions, why bother to dust it down and refurbish it? The answer to this lies in the confusion in play here around the very notion of the term, which reflects the different political and philosophical traditions that have entered the space of pragmatism. Osborne's work appears to owe more to the specific tradition of pragmatics in linguistics and the philosophy of language (which has a OXFORD ART JOURNAL 26.1 2003 177</page><page sequence="5">Reviews stronger link to traditions of the left) than it does to pragmatism as a post-philosophy, yet this distinction is not drawn out. This is particularly evident in the essay on Peirce called 'Sign and Image', which deals with the post- Sausserian debates on representation (Eco, Barthes) with- out discussing the broader political context of contemporary pragmatics and where pragmatics and pragmatism actually diverge. Rather than giving an exegesis of Osborne's reading of Eco and Barthes, I want to look at the general pragmatic context in which Osborne's use of Peirce is embedded. Pragmatics has its origins in C. W. Morris's (1930s) and H. P. Grice's (1950s) work on natural language in which the study of signs is defined in terms of their users and interpreters. Latterly this has been developed in Dan Sperber's and Deidre Wilson's work on reference in speech and their critique of the semiotic model in linguistics, and in Jean-Jacques Lecercle's post-Althusserian Marxist literary theory (in particular Interpretation as Pragmatics).19 What Sperber and Wilson argue is that communication is more generally an inferential process of exchange between addressor and addressee than a process of decoding on the part of participants.20 Meaning is achieved by producing and interpreting evidence in context. But unlike Grice, who bases this on a strong co-operative principle between speaker and hearer, they assert that communication is not based just on shared knowledge-the Gricean principle that language use creates expectations that are met by speaker and hearer-but on a self-qualifying process of inferential interpretation. Furthermore, they argue that the development of these inferential abilities may in fact be close to the development of linguistic abilities them- selves. Lecercle develops this inferential model from within a post-Althusserian model of textual interpretation. Partici- pants enter into communication through sharing a stock of common knowledge. For communication to take place, participants must not only master this knowledge, but they must also be aware of the other participants' mastery of it. In this way communication is not an unmediated exchange between self-sufficient subjects, but between interpellated actants within a representational structure. The speaker does not address the hearer directly, but mediates her speech and understanding both via the representation she has of the other person, and through the representation she assumes the other person has of herself. Lecercle also applies this to textual interpretation. 'The text is never transparent [rather, a system of actantial places] ... it must be interpreted, and [therefore] . . . interpretation involves decision and risk-taking'.21 In this respect what gives Lecercle's model its own self-professed character as pragmatics is its notion of the interlocutor/interpreter as an interventionist for meaning. This is because, if the intentions of speakers/authors are always representations, then the recovery of first-order intentional meaning from texts is untenable. Meaning is not the result of a 'dialogic exchange', of the disclosure of prior intentions, but a process of question-and-answer between text and reader. The reader does not interpret an already constituted text; she constitutes it as a text in the process of producing the interpretation. Nevertheless, this lack of fit between interpretation and prior intention is not for Lecercle another version of post-Structuralist pragmatism or reader-response theory. On the contrary, the claims of interpretation, and thus the internal coherence of the interpretation, must be based on the internal coherence of the text. The risk of interpretation is not an excuse for randomness; truth claims must be linked 'economically' to the intentional modalities of the text. In this regard, Lecercle sees interpretation as a necessary imposture. And, therefore, the interpretation does not lead to the 'distortion' or a pale copy of the text's 'hidden truths', but to new forms of knowledge. This is the very function of interpretative work: in the pursuit coherence and plausibility the interpretation provides an increase in meaning. On this score, there is a strong affinity between Lecercle's version of pragmatics and Benjamin's model of translation, and by extension Osborne's Peircian/Benjami- nian version of pragmatism: interpretation is form of practice in which the infinitude of semiosis is brought to a point of productive 'interruption' through the risk of judgement. As such the idea of protecting the object in its 'authenticity' from theory and critique actually diminishes the encounter with the object. An 'apriori limit to the possibility of [cultural]translation'22 is enforced, as Osborne puts it. Thus, against conservative versions of pragmatism, this model of interpretation as intervention has been very attractive recently to those engaged, like Osborne and Lecercle, in a critique of code-based semiotics, and in particular the deconstructionist post-Sausserean misread- ing of semiosis as (truth-aversion) free-play. By emphasising the truth-giving powers of the agent as interpretant, the prospect of infinite semiosis moves from the post-Sausser- ian realm of multiple meaning to that of the realm of justification, of justice. In this respect this model of interpretative pragmatics intersects with, perhaps, a more familiar version of post-Benjaminian critical theory: late-or 'Marxian'-Paul de Man. Indeed de Man's own commitment to the realist moment in interpretation seems to haunt many of the moves of Osborne's Peircian debate on the sign and his reading of aesthetics, even if de Man's general distaste for any systematic cultural politics has little or no bearing on Osborne's project. What is central to de Man is that interpretation is an epistemological event prior to being a debate about aesthetic value; or rather, epistemology and aesthetic value are fatefully entwined. As Osborne declares in a similar vein, while an aesthetic judgement is not the same as a judgement of meaning, aesthetic judgements require 'an interpretative process of meaning-seeking as their experiential ground'.23 In this way interpretation is a category which is neither purely 'semiological' nor purely aesthetic in the conventional Kantian sense. Rather, interpretation is an argument, a partisan act of interruption and reinscription. However, as de Man insists, this does 'not mean that there can be a true reading [of a text, a work] but that no reading is conceivable in which the question of its 178 OXFORD ART JOURNAL 26.1 2003</page><page sequence="6">Reviews truth or falsehood is not primarily involved'.24 Existing in the strong realm of judgement, then, Osborne's metaphysical interdisciplinarity takes criticism, like de Man, to be an argument with cultural form as a form of knowledge. By accepting that fictive cultural forms gives us access to 'adequate ideas' and are therefore not exempt from rational sense-making standards, interpretation is inescapably bound to matters of truth and falsehood.25 There is, therefore, also an important post-Althusserian pay-off here in relation to ideology and interpretation. The interpretant is neither the passive dupe of the author's intentions, nor, indeed, of the interpellating structure as such. And this, crucially, is what unites this loose school of pragmatics I have sketched out, and what draws Osborne to the interventionism of its cultural politics. What obviously dismays Osborne about contemporary cultural studies is its binary ideological model of the interpellated and counter- interpellated subject: on the one hand the subject supine in front of the spectacularised forms and reified structures of mass culture and the 'popular', and on the other as the would-be creative misreader or glosser of its alienated forms. The idea of the subject as interrogator of meaning and truth, as the producer of counter-interpellations, is levelled out or masked. In this regard, this pragmatic tradition of interpretation- as-risk and intervention actually draws on an earlier ethical dialogue within Western Marxism: Lukacs' theory of Augenblick-the refusal to reduce the political act to a predetermined set of objective possibilities.26 If this has had little influence in mainstream cultural studies, with its insistence on glossolalia rather than the partisanship of judgement, it now seems to be a force within a post 'post- Althusserian' anti-pragmatist philosophy and cultural theory (Alain Badiou, Jacques Ranci6re). In rejecting the Althusser- ian notion that subjectivity is identical with ideological misrecognition, these writers defend the disarticulatory and emancipatory power of the subjective act. But if Osborne's risk theory of pragmatics is operative within this space-what philosophy can bring to cultural studies is a theory of cultural subjectivity as praxis-he does not buy into the neo-Kantian political tendencies of this tradition: on the one side a positivity of power and on the other the liberatory gesture. Indeed, one of the philosophers he has least time for in Philosophy in Culture Theory is Deleuze, the doyen of this gestural anti-positivity. For Osborne, rather, the production of utopian content is the result of a sustained process of counter-interpellation, and not on Rorty-type acts of poetic redescription on the part of interpretants. In this way the utopian or futural content of counter-interpellation is determined by the redemptive and contestory force of localised acts of judgement and not on the force of the aestheticised radical gesture. In this distinction lie two very different models of philosophy in cultural theory: one committed to anti-representational or post-representational kinds of insurgency and form-making; and another com- mitted to the history, memory, and the politics of representa- tion. I see Osborne's pragmatism as an attempt to continue the metaphysical possibilities of the latter, in conditions where the 'politics of representation' have become academicised and utterly bereft of any public content. On this basis, one of the virtues of pragmatics in this form is that it provides a sharp break from contemporary cultural studies' degenerated love of the popular, philosophical aesthetics' degenerated fetishisation of art's bereavement, and 'post-philosophy philosophy's' degenerated love of 'democracy'; whilst at the same time recovering a lost sense of Gramsci's conjunction of philosophy and cultural struggle. (Gramsci, incidentally, thought pragmatism had created politically nothing more than the Rotary Club movement, yet was also keen to develop an analysis of the links between Marxism and the activist base of pragmatism's post-Kantianism in his philosophy of praxis.27) But what pragmatics is less capable of providing is a wider sense of the divisions of contemporary culture, that is the position of countervailing forces at the collective level within a structural view of the institutions of dominant culture and the fortunes of its counter-institutions. Prag- matics emphasises the productivity of the individual encounter with the object. Thus, although it is evident from Osborne's writing what poor and enfeebled shape con- temporary cultural studies and cultural philosophy are in, we are never clear artistically, culturally what the stakes of the struggle and negation are, who the actual agents of that struggle are, what exemplary forms might it take, and what forces are arraigned politically against this struggle. Admittedly the job of Philosophy in Cultural Theory is not to provide a guide to praxis, or a history of individual works of art, but nevertheless there is an absence of cultural specificity that countermands the contestory framework of the writing. This gives the metatheoretical tenor of the book a kind of technical character, in which approved or privileged places, texts, objects, and strategies of a new cultural theory are never allowed to find a substantive voice, a result, which seems to me, in keeping with the general sublimation of the realist debate as a whole (or rather its subsumption under pragmatics). Philosophical realism on its way into cultural theory encounters a rich tradition of exemplary works and strategies, pragmatics does not. In this respect I want to conclude by analysing the wider context in which Osborne's arguments on philosophy and culture can be situated. Cultural Restoration What has marked the rise of cultural studies of the last twenty years is its increasing identification of the meanings of culture with what the capitalist culture-industry produces. In defending and articulating the pleasures of the popular, it has designed its theories of desire and subjectivity to fit the images and forms of the moment. In this regard the history of contemporary culture studies-after its earlier Marxian moment of resistance in Britain-has been a history of the discipline's increasing assimilation of the cultural 'restora- tion' of capitalism since the late 1970s. From an earlier OXFORD ART JOURNAL 26.1 2003 179</page><page sequence="7">Reviews position in which notions of the popular and counter-popular are produced in alliance with politics 'from below', the production of the popular became subsumed in the 1990s under a general theory of the 'creative consumer'. This has led to the general realignment of the two primary and related strategies of cultural studies-the redemption of popular experience and forms and the affirmation of the subaltern- with a social democratic model of cultural difference. In other words, in basing its object of study on a positivised return to the study of 'lived experience' and the 'everyday', largely through the interpretation of popular commercial films and photographic representations, cultural studies has become primarily a theory of the popular text and the popular reader rather than a theory of cultural division and cultural production. As such cultural studies has seen its assertion of the unofficial histories of subaltern cultures and experience become the official social history of capitalist cultural democracy. An important question arises then: how do you do cultural theory, and with what resources, when the production, articulation, and symbolisation of cultural difference has now become the driving force of the new forms of subjectivity of capitalism?28 Is a critical cultural theory worth defending at all? A number of writers on the left identified previously with cultural theory have said 'not much'. Indeed, the alignment of cultural studies with the dominant ideological forms of social democracy has prompted a major reversal of interest in the political category of the cultural, as in Terry Eagleton's The Idea of Culture (2000)29 and Russell Jacoby's The End of Utopia: Culture and Politics in an Age of Apathy (1999), revealing a wider malaise on the left about the value of a politics of cultural intervention.30 What unites their writing is the idea that cultural studies 'has gone too far' in its enculturalisation of politics and defence of cultural difference. In expanding the meanings of politics it has allowed politics to be subsumed under cultural theory, weakening its efficacy and critical range. In short, cultural studies has become culturalist. The answer is to disband the notion of cultural politics and return to 'real politics', or at least to get intellectuals to put cultural studies back in its 'proper' place and to stop worrying the meanings of culture to death. Osborne has some sympathy with this position. "'Culture" is in danger of taking the political out of politics, in the very act of becoming its privileged mode'.31 But what distinguishes Osborne's intervention from the likes of Eagleton and Jacoby is that the problems of cultural studies are held to lie not with cultural studies as a model of social understanding as such, but with its present content and theoretical resources. Cultural theory has not become fatally compromised; on the contrary, it has lost connection with the forces of disruption and negation that have shaped the theorisation of the modern culture and politics. The weakness of contemporary cultural studies, then, is its chronic failure to temporalise the conditions of 'culture' beyond the horizon of the 'present' and the popular. Osborne's defence of the category of the cultural for the left is, essentially, a defence of the political tasks of mediation, in conditions where such tasks are considered to be of limited or questionable value. For what connects Eagleton's and Jacoby's quasi-positivist attacks on cultural studies and the neo-Kantian tendencies of post post- Althusserian cultural theory, is their general abdication from, or indifference to, the cultural production of subject- ivity: the fact that the task of producing other or counter- hegemonic subjectivities is left to chance or simply to the vagaries of an 'aesthetic education'. Indeed, the return to aesthetics as the bearer of 'otherly' cultured modes of understanding and the guarantor of subjectivity, has captured those sections of the left that are not still enamoured by the 'democracy' of the popular text. Osborne's metaphysical interdisciplinarity, then, defends another, more difficult, and more exacting route for cultural theory: a practice of critical rehistoricisation and retempor- alisation. The urgent task of philosophy in cultural studies, he argues, is to produce an 'oppositional, re-historicizing, refiguring of temporal forms'.32 This is difficult and exacting because under current circumstances the political effects of this work remain largely virtual and textual-hence Osbor- ne's singular defence of the metaphysical content of his model of cultural studies. In this wayl am struck by the similarities between Osborne's model and the language and concepts of another recent 'virtual' philosophical interven- tion into cultural studies, Tom Cohen's Ideology and Inscription (1998).33 Like Osborne, Cohen uses Benjamin's understanding of the task of interpretation as the production of an emancipatory moment of interruption to condemn the loss of cultural studies 'transformative promise'.34 Failing to open up the capitalist 'sensorium' to its own contingent conditions of production and reproduction, contemporary cultural studies' dephilosophised archive of the present reinforces mass culture's dehistorisation of meaning. In response, Cohen calls for a 'third model' of cultural studies, a materialist historiography in which 'alternate models of reference, causality, the historical and the 'event' become possible'.35 In this way the counter-interpellative content of cultural studies is opened up to various strategies of negation, producing a series of '(a)rhythmic break[s]'36 in the machinery of historicism. The task of cultural studies is to re-seed the referential matrices of the dominant culture in order to challenge the archival base by which historical 'experience' is produced and reproduced. There is little here that is not familiar from other Benjaminian interventions into cultural theory over the last twenty-five years. But what marks out Osborne's (and Cohen's) project is the partisanship of epistemologically inflected language of the 'break', 'interruption', and 'reinscription' in a climate on the left dominated either by the jaundiced Eagleton-Jacoby line on cultural studies as inherently culturalist and depoliticising, or an aestheticist distaste for cultural politics as such. This makes Osborne's intervention timely, given the absence of such language from most cultural debate these days. But it also makes it a profoundly conflicted one: on the one hand, Osborne may advocate a cultural politics which enters and contests the 180 OXFORD ART JOURNAL 26.1 2003</page><page sequence="8">Reviews spaces of capitalism's homogenisation of meaning (in the spirit of Hardt and Negri), yet on the other, the virtuality of these strategies is the result of the separation of these processes of meaning from the practice of actual alternative institutions. The cultural studies he imagines being reborn from a metaphysical interdisciplinarity is also stalled at the level of methodological reflection. Early cultural studies was the outcome of a transformation in the space of cultural production and reproduction from below. Those energies have now long dissipated or disappeared. The improved presence of philosophy in cultural theory, for all its '(a)rhythmic' breaks in the 'sensorium', will not itself generate those forces. Notes 1.

For instance, in Of Grammatology, trans. G. Spivak (John Hopkins University Press: Baltimore, 1976), Derrida misreads Peirce's theory of the sign in order to corroborate a misreading of Saussure. According to Derrida, for Peirce the 'represented is always a representamen . . .' and therefore there is no point of stabilisation between sign and referent (p. 49); this is then held to be coextensive, or at least familial, with a Saussurean differential model of the sign. Contra Derrida, however, Saussure's argument was about the essential arbitrariness of the. relationship between signifier and signified and not between the signified and the referent of a sign. For a discussion of the misuse of Peirce and Saussure, see Raymond Tallis, Not Saussure: A Critique of Post-Saussurean Literary Theory (Rout- ledge: London, 1988). What Tallis makes clear is how powerful the Derridean- Peirce interface has been in establishing Peirce's modern pragmatist credentials. Interestingly, though, Christopher Norris, one of Derrida's best Anglophone interlocutors, has been a determined defender of Derrida's rationalism and critic of pragmatism. This conflict reflects the complex way in which pragmatism shifts its critical ground across disciplines. 15.
