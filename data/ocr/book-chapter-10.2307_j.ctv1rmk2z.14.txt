<plain_text> <page sequence="1"> 9 Genealogies Genealogy as an anthropological tool At the heart of every good native title claim lies a robust genealogy.  I  iterate this truism because it is not always evident. Genealogies tend  to get left behind in the research process – being regarded as a task that  does not merit immediate attention and that might well be left to some  more junior person to complete. This is a grievous error and one that will  compound difficulties not only during the native title claim itself but,  upon its resolution, thereafter as those charged with administering the  native title rights recognised by the court seek answers to questions about  membership and rights that are likely to lie, in part at least, within the  genealogical account. Long after the legal disputes about extinguishment  and continuity of laws and customs have been forgotten, the genealogy  will remain an important point of reference. As such, it is our duty to make  sure that we provide genealogical data that are the best possible given the  circumstances, our resources and the problems we will encounter when  dealing with genealogical knowledge. Genealogies, whether in analogue  or digital form, become ‘things’ in the sense that they exist in the context  of their own creation divorced from the diverse research environment  wherein their component parts were created. It is essential, then, that  their integrity is able to withstand a lack of attendant exegesis, explanation  or excuse. We cannot now ask Tindale what he meant by writing on  a genealogy that a person was ‘of ’ such and such a place, which would  be handy given such annotations are commonly referred to in native title  207 </page> <page sequence="2"> AusTRAlIAN NATIvE TITlE ANThRopoloGy inquiries. The deficiency now limits the usefulness of the original text  and, had Tindale paid greater attention to his meaning, our research task  would be all the easier today. The idea of a genealogy or family tree has a long history dating back well  beyond the development of anthropology as a discipline. They feature in  the Old Testament and are found in many non-literate societies as formal  recitations of lineal descendants passed on from generation to generation  as oral tradition. Commentators on the history of genealogical recording  have noted that ‘genealogical reckoning came to serve as a model of  distinction in early European society’, and that ‘aspects of its visual  representation appear in fascinating diffraction in many places’ (Bamford  and Leach 2009, 4). These authors provide an illustration of a family  tree hung in the Royal Palace of Jogjakarta in Central Java (ibid., 5, 20).  They continue: By the end of the twelfth century, genealogy had become the surest means  of preserving the memory of one’s ancestors and of enhancing the prestige  of an elite family. Demonstrated birth and membership in an aristocratic  family became the legitimizing criteria for anyone who wanted to take  advantage of the automatic inheritance system for fiefs. By 1500, a ‘well  born’ man thought of his ancestors and descendants as a group of people  through whose veins flowed the same noble blood. (ibid., 4) Barnes (1967, 101) suggests that family membership and family position  (presumably meaning social status) are used ‘as criteria for membership  and position in larger social units’. He shows how genealogical accounts  have been a part of many cultures for many centuries in both Europe and  elsewhere (ibid., 102–103). Barnes’s epigraphic citation to Oswald Barron,  contributor to the 1911 Encyclopaedia Britannica, confirms the antiquity  of genealogical study, but raises an associated difficulty of veracity: The medieval baron, knight or squire, although proud of the nobility of his  race, was content to let it rest upon legend handed down the generations.  The exact line of his descent was sought only when it was demanded  for a plea in the king’s courts to support his title to his lands. From the  first the work of the genealogist in England had that taint of inaccuracy  tempered with forgery from which it has not yet been cleansed. (Barron  1911, 575–576) 208 </page> <page sequence="3"> 9 . GENEAloGIEs Genealogies prepared in relation to claims of right or title are not neutral  documents existing in some space separate from bias or even, in extreme  cases, fabrication. While genealogies purport to set out either as text  or as a diagram the lineage of a person, they must also be understood  potentially as social constructs.  Barnes distinguished ‘pedigrees’ from ‘genealogies’ while accepting that the  two terms were often used interchangeably (Barnes 1967, 102–103). The  former is a charter of lineal descent that serves to support an asserted social  position or status. The latter is a statement ‘made by an ethnographer as  part of his field record or analysis’ (ibid., 103). For the most part in native  title research we are likely to be collecting ‘pedigrees’ (as Daisy Bates also  called them). However, the term ‘pedigree’ has connotations that relate to  the animal kingdom and is probably best avoided as this may give offence. In Australia, Sir George Grey was perhaps the first European observer to  make use of genealogies with respect to social inquiry – proving a list ‘to  show the manner in which a native family becomes divided’ (Grey 1841, II,  Appendix A, 391–394).1 He collected these names and relationships from  the Perth area, Western Australia,2 being interested in how obligations  developed from family relationships, and used his genealogical data to  provide an indication of age (Grey 1841, II, 231, 247). W.H.R. Rivers  is generally credited with introducing what he called the ‘genealogical  method’ into anthropological practice (Rivers 1900; Barnes 1967, 104).  Rivers had visited the Torres Strait as a part of the Haddon expedition in  1898. Wishing better to understand the relationship between those upon  whom he and his expedition colleagues were conducting psychological  tests, he commenced collecting genealogies. He found, ‘the knowledge  possessed by the natives of their families was so extensive, and apparently  so accurate’ that it spurred him to collect genealogies from a substantial  majority of those resident on both Murray and Mabuig islands (ibid., 74).  Rivers defined his own fieldwork methodology (ibid., 75–76), noting that  issues of confidentiality were a concern on Murray Island and claimed the  ‘essential accuracy’ of his data (ibid., 76). He also raised two additional  points to which I return later in this chapter. One related to the difficulty  he encountered when trying to ascertain what he termed the ‘real’ father  in a system that classified a number of individuals (typically ego’s father’s  1  Available from gutenberg.net.au/ebooks/e00055.html 2  Grey 1841, II, 324. 209 </page> <page sequence="4"> AusTRAlIAN NATIvE TITlE ANThRopoloGy brother) as a ‘father’ (ibid., 75, 77). The other related to the issues of  adoption, common in Torres Strait societies (ibid., 76–77) and a frequent  feature of native title genealogical accounts.  Rivers saw genealogies as a means to study kinship (ibid., 77–78),  marriage choices and customs (ibid., 78–80), totemism, fertility and  history (ibid.,  81–82). Rivers recognised the potential for genealogical  information to provide the means for the analysis of abstract concepts  through the provision of ‘concrete facts’ by those he interviewed – the  provision of which he regarded as the product of their ‘extraordinary  memory for detail’ (ibid., 82). Interestingly, Rivers notes that two  lawsuits had been tried before the court on Murray Island, both dealing  with disputes over title to land that ‘turned on the question of adoption  and on the real parentage of two men’ (ibid., 77). Rivers tells us that his  genealogies matched the accounts provided in the trial but he did not  appreciate at that time what a seminal role genealogies would later play in  native title and intra-Indigenous disputes over land (ibid.).  Pioneering Australian anthropologists including Radcliffe-Brown, Elkin,  Kaberry and others (including Daisy Bates) all collected genealogies  as a means to better understand the social relationships of those with  whom they worked, how different family members were named, their  rules for marriage, the descent of totemic affiliation and, at least to some  extent, their rights to country through patrifiliation. For good reason the  genealogical method became a stock-in-trade for anthropological inquiry  and a frequently encountered component of a good ethnography. Genealogies and native title The collection of genealogical data and the construction of genealogical  charts commonly feature in native title research in two forms.  The researcher can use genealogical data to explore with claimants kinship  terminology, marriage preferences, totemic affiliations and relatedness  and this should provide a basis upon which at least some aspects of the  laws and customs and associated normative referents are defined for the  community of native title holders. This provides a valuable insight into  the likely continuity (or otherwise) of these rules and ways of behaving  since the date of effective sovereignty. Such information does not have to  be elicited through genealogical research, but this is a task that will most  likely have to be undertaken in any event, unless of course it has already  210 </page> <page sequence="5"> 9 . GENEAloGIEs been done by a reliable and accurate researcher previously. The second form  of genealogical research is the account of descent from an apical ancestor,  and this research activity tends, in my experience, rather to overshadow  the first-mentioned activity to the former’s ultimate detriment. Native title claims are typically made by those who are described in the  application as being the descendants of one or more of those listed as  ancestors of the claimants. These forebears are known commonly as ‘apical  ancestors’, which simply means they are at the apex of the genealogical  account. It is sometimes the case that research undertaken in relation to  the early texts (including the genealogies of pioneering anthropologists)  will reveal additional names beyond those listed as apical ancestors on  the Form 1 application.3 Locating the names and country identities of  individuals even one generation above the apical listed on the Form 1  extends the compass of knowledge about the descent of rights and is  likely to be helpful to the application. Claimants are unlikely to know the  names of those more than two or, in some cases, three generations above  ego, so it may be useful in any discussion to employ the name of a person  who is remembered by the older claimants as a point of reference with the  lineal relationship included. Thus, in a fictitious example, apical ancestor  John Brown whose father’s father is discoverable from an early genealogy  as Jinggandari is rendered as ‘Jinggandari, FF of John Brown’. The wording on the Form 1 will vary on a case-by-case basis and it is not  unusual for those adopted, perhaps ‘according to the laws and customs  of the claimants’, to be included. In addition the requirement that there  be ‘community recognition’ of claim group membership may also find  a place in the Form 1 wording. As I have discussed in the previous chapter,  these are important legal qualifications that may require consideration by  the anthropologist. Native title genealogical essentials In terms of the anthropological inquiry the genealogical account of  descent from a named ancestor is, in its essentials, straightforward.  Assuming that the system under review is one based on a descent of rights  through filiation (that is, through a perceived relationship between ego  3  The ‘Native Title (Federal Court) Regulations 1998’ require that the ‘Form 1’ be used for an  application mentioned in s. 61(1) of the Native Title Act 1993 by a claimant for a determination  of native title in relation to an area for which there is no approved determination of native title.  See www.fedcourt.gov.au/forms-and-fees/forms/native-title-regulations, accessed 6 November 2017. 211 </page> <page sequence="6"> AusTRAlIAN NATIvE TITlE ANThRopoloGy and a forebear), what is required is an account of the genealogy, showing  descent through agnatic or cognatic links (as the case may be) with lineal  antecedents stretching back to the apical ancestor. Ultimately, what is  required is evidence that the ancestor was in command of the claimed  land (or a portion of it) at the time of effective sovereignty or before. Data  brought to bear on this issue derive either from the claimants themselves  as part of their oral account of their ancestral connection or from the early  literature and in some cases from more recent prior native title research.  While the essentials are disarmingly simple, the reality is indeed much  more complex. W.H.R. Rivers, and the early Australian anthropologists who followed,  collected their genealogical data from those with whom they worked. It was,  then, strictly an oral account, although Rivers noted that the ‘chief ’ on  Mabuiag had himself drawn up genealogies of residents of the island that  River found agreed, for the most part, with his own data and augmented  them (1900, 76). Anthropologists working in Aboriginal Australia on  native title claims are unlikely to have such a clear run. Genealogical  accounts collected by previous researchers may serve to confirm, correct  or contradict the oral account. This can lead to disputes between groups  and a variance of opinion between the claimants and the anthropologist  should the genealogical record not accord with that now espoused by the  claimants. In my experience claimants sometimes turn up to native title  meetings with their own independently researched genealogies, which  they may or may not wish to hand over to the anthropologist who is  researching the claim. The provision of a number of genealogical sources  seldom results in unambiguous concurrence, or the material available may  be uncertain, unclear or incomplete. All the difficulties I have already  discussed in preceding chapters relating to the use of early texts apply.  The potential for disagreement and conflict is, then, high, particularly as  claimants usually see the genealogical materials as the pass to claim group  membership, which indeed in part at least, it may be. Given that this is an important and often contested field, it is important  that  genealogical research be undertaken with due respect for method,  the time required and resources needed. It is a task that requires careful,  methodical and professional application. In what follows I set out just some  of the guiding principles that may assist, noting that others have written  at length on the genealogical method, including Barnes (1967) and, with  respect to native title, Sutton (see, in particular, 2003, 179–205).  212 </page> <page sequence="7"> 9 . GENEAloGIEs Some methodological and procedural issues Despite the shallowness of the genealogical record (Barnes 1967, 119;  Sansom 2006), the claimants’ own knowledge of their family and  antecedents remains an important basis for preparing the research  documentation required for a native title claim. The court generally  regards genealogical accounts provided by claimants as ‘evidence’ but  of course has to allocate them weight according to the credibility of the  witness, consistency and other factors including whether it is likely that  the data have been derived from books, papers or lawyers during the native  title process. For the anthropologists, in terms of field research, collecting  genealogical data means sitting down with senior claimants to gather  genealogical information. A necessary precursor to this process (as with  all field research) will be an explanation of the process to be followed  and the reason why genealogical data are so important, what will happen  to the data once collected and the uses to which they will be put. For  each individual, names should be recorded, place and date of birth noted  and country affiliation and language group identity sought. Other data  that might be helpful include section or subsection terms and totemic  affiliation, but the data to be collected will depend on both availability  and relevance to the native title arguments. Each item of information  should be explored as thoroughly as possible. A person may have several  names and multiple language identities. If the knowledge is absent, make  a note that this is the case. Different cultural conventions govern the use  of names, particularly of the deceased, so it is probably best to discuss this  first before attempting to collect a genealogy as it is next to impossible to  do so accurately without using the names of deceased ancestors. As with  all field data, the resulting chart and accompanying notes should be dated  and the persons from whom the information was gathered set down.  Genealogies should be checked with the claimants that supplied them as  well as with members of other branches of the family that share the same  ancestors. Generally, however, I have found it a sound rule not to discuss  genealogical details belonging to one family with another as this is usually  seen as a betrayal of confidential information and should be avoided. The systematic methods required to collect these genealogical data in the  field have been set out elsewhere (Barnes 1967, 105–112). The researcher  should decide on the symbols to be used in the charts, typically  for  a woman and r for a man and perhaps a £ or  ̄ if the sex is not known.  A deceased person can be marked by a solid infill of the symbol or a /  through it. The person from whom the genealogy is collected should  213 </page> <page sequence="8"> AusTRAlIAN NATIvE TITlE ANThRopoloGy be identified as ‘ego’ and his or her ascending generations are shown by  vertical lines, collaterals by horizontal lines. Marriage is shown by the use  of =; alternatively and sometimes more convenient if there are multiple  wives, by a horizontal line with short terminal vertical lines above linking  marriage partners. Names should be included where they are known.  There is some preference for distinguishing males from females by the use  of capitals for the former and lowercase for the latter, particularly if the  symbols noted above are not used (Rivers 1900, 74). Some researchers  have reversed this arrangement including Daisy Bates who often has her  women in capitals and her men in lower case, as did Norman Tindale.  Whatever convention is adopted, it should be explained in the text or  along with the genealogical charts so the reader can be clear as to the data  the genealogical chart presents. The date, place of collection and identity  of  the ego of the chart should be noted on the chart or genealogical  account. Discussion of relationships is best done by reference to conventional  abbreviations. Thus F = father, MF = mother’s father, mm = mother’s  mother, z = sister, S = son and so on. Males are distinguished from females  by the use of the upper case for the former and the lower case for the  latter. A fuller account of these conventions is provided by Sutton (2003,  181–182), which date back to Murdock’s writing on genealogical method  in 1947 (cited in Barnes 1967, 122–123).  Genealogical accounts required for a native title claim, which provide  explanatory text as to how claimants are descended from a named  ancestor, are necessarily complex and sometimes tortured affairs. They  should be kept as simple as possible while ensuring that there is no  ambiguity resulting from the loose use of pronouns. Thus statements  like ‘Molly had a daughter Jessie and her mother’s sister was called Jane’  leave the reader uncertain as to whether Jane is Jessie’s mz (aunt) or  Jessie’s mmz (great  aunt). It is better to repeat a name than risk such  misunderstandings. Thus, ‘Molly had a daughter Jessie. Molly’s sister was  called Jane’. Or, ‘Molly had a daughter Jessie. Molly’s mother [name] had  a sister who was called Jane’. Genealogical accounts as text should be properly referenced to the  source in the researcher’s field notes. In this way material collected from  the claimants about their knowledge of an ancestor can be sourced to  a particular claimant and consequently the bases for any resultant expert  view is evident to the reader or those who seek to adjudicate the matter. 214 </page> <page sequence="9"> 9 . GENEAloGIEs Reliance will also have to be placed on archival and earlier anthropological  work, particularly genealogies collected in the past. The limitations of  these data, if apparent, should be considered, and such deficiencies as are  considered to qualify opinions made clear. Conclusions must be founded  on these data as a whole and, in the event that there is insufficient materials  available from all sources, the anthropologist should simply state that  there is insufficient data available to form a concluded view. A critical task is to provide an opinion on whether each apical ancestor  was in command of portions of the application area at or before the date  of effective sovereignty. This requires the provision of a likely birth  date for the ancestor in order to show whether the individual was born  prior to the date of effective sovereignty. If these data are not a part of  the archival record (which in the majority of cases it is not), then the  researcher has to provide reasonable grounds for estimating one. When  seeking to posit dates of birth of those in the higher generations beyond  oral recall it is my practice to work backwards from the oldest person  whose birth date is known with some certainty – perhaps from a Tindale  reference, a birth, death or marriage certificate or other document.  This may not take us back very far but from then on the application of  calculated birth dates is one way to proceed, provided the method and  its assumptions are clearly set down for the reader and the limitations of  the system accepted. In computing possible birth dates, where these are  not known from the archival or other records, I allow 20 years between  generations for a woman and 25 years for a man. This is a rough estimate  given that women may be younger and men often older than this when  their first child is born and other researchers have adopted different inter- generational time periods (e.g. Sutton 2003, 162, 168). However, what  I suggest provides a helpful guide as to possible birth dates of ancestors  when no other information is available in this regard while the bases for  ensuing conclusions in this regard are set out for the reader to evaluate. The identity of the ancestor’s country is also seldom readily available from  the evidence so, again, the researcher must provide reasonable grounds  for the provision of an opinion with respect to this and some reliance will  have to be placed in this regard on the archival record, if such is available.  215 </page> <page sequence="10"> AusTRAlIAN NATIvE TITlE ANThRopoloGy Tindale’s genealogies Tindale collected many hundreds of genealogies from all round Aboriginal  Australia. As I discussed in Chapter 7, parcels of Tindale’s gargantuan  corpus frequently figure in native title claims and his genealogies are no  exception. Consequently, given the widespread use of Tindale’s genealogical  data in native title claims, these materials merit commentary here. While  other early researchers have also collected genealogical accounts, including  charts which are used in native title claims, an evaluation of the use of  Tindale’s genealogical materials also provides lessons applicable to the  materials collected by others.  Understanding Tindale’s genealogies is first about developing an  appreciation of their original purpose. Keen, in an article he titled ‘Norman  Tindale and me’ (1999), pointed out that the genealogies prepared by  Tindale now provide a ‘wonderful resource for many Aboriginal people  ... in the preparation of native title claims’. However, they were also  the work of a man who was ‘a strong advocate of assimilation and the  dispersal of Aboriginal communities in the southeast, at the time of the  White Australia policy’ (ibid., 99). Tindale was of the view that mixed  race Aboriginal people should be absorbed as rapidly as possible into  the mainstream population (white, Anglo-European). He was interested  to discover which of the many racially mixed groups would best adapt to  assimilation (ibid., 102; Tindale 1941, 68). He identified mixed race  individuals in his genealogies by the use of the annotations F1 (typically  a European father and Aboriginal mother) and F2 (the child of two F1  individuals). He also used the then popular terms like ‘quadroon’ and  ‘octroon’ or by the fraction value of the ‘mixed blood’ he calculated from the  genealogical information available to him (Keen 1999, 100). This ‘racial  reductionism’ as Keen called it (ibid., 103) is both striking and disturbing  to a modern reader but it explains Tindale’s apparent preoccupation with  collecting genealogies, which he often coupled with his anthropomorphic  measurements, mental ability tests and photographs, undertaken at times  with his long-term colleague Joseph Birdsell (Tindale 1940b).  A good example of Tindale’s research interests in this regard is found  in a page of his journal, written in 1939 while visiting the Aboriginal  settlement of Koonibba on the west coast of South Australia (1938–1939,  216 </page> <page sequence="11"> 9 . GENEAloGIEs 10204). Tindale made a copy of a ‘Work Classification’ evidently drawn up  by Pastor Traeger who became the superintendent of Koonibba Mission  in 1936. Traeger’s list was, in turn, based on a ‘similar list used by Pastor  Mueller’ (ibid.), the previous superintendent of the mission. Tindale’s  entry takes the form of a table and comprises a list of men employed at the  mission and a ranking of their ability to undertake employment. The table  has four columns with the headings, ‘Men able to undertake contract  work successfully’, ‘Men reliable when left to work alone’, ‘Men who give  best results if white man works with them’ and ‘Unreliable’. Against each  name is a measure of the individual’s ‘blood’ – that is, F1, F2, 3⁄4 and so  on with a cross reference to the genealogical chart he had drawn up as part  of his research program. All the names in column 1 are classified as F1;  of the nine names in column 4, six are classified as ‘fb’, two as 3⁄4 and one  as F1. Elsewhere Tindale reported that F1 individuals showed ‘apparently  greater adjustment to white life’ than did F2 individuals, but he was  unable to explain why this was so (1940b, 282). Tindale commented in  his journal, ‘when fully analysed this list should be very instructive as an  independent assessment of the high place taken by F1s as compared with  F2s and others’ (1938–1939, 1021). The quality and legibility of Tindale’s genealogies vary enormously.  Some are quite sparse in terms of their details, while others appear to  have been the product of a number of sessions, with copious information  squeezed in to a corner, with lines showing family connections that could  not otherwise be accommodated in the space available. Tindale generally  wrote the European names of the people he recorded, using upper case for  women and lower case for men. Tindale also annotated some of the names  he recorded, but there is no consistency in this regard. He sometimes wrote  ‘tribal’ names alongside the name of individuals where these were known  or collected as well as a geographic location. The significance of these  locations is unclear. Tindale sometimes wrote that a person was ‘of ’ such  and such a place, or ‘at’, the implication being that the former preposition  indicated that the place was their traditional country, the latter that they  were living at the place mentioned. However, this apparent differentiation  is not explained by Tindale and can only be drawn by inference. It is  important to remember that Tindale did not generally record details  of the country wherein a person held customary rights but rather used  4  The copy of the journal I have accessed has two sets of page numbers. The one cited here appears  to have been Tindale’s original. A portion of the original journal has been renumbered, commencing  as page 2 for the 24 March 1939 entry. 217 </page> <page sequence="12"> AusTRAlIAN NATIvE TITlE ANThRopoloGy a ‘tribal’ identity to situate them within a social setting. Tindale also  sometimes gave approximate ages and other comments or annotations  that can sometimes yield helpful ethnographic information he obviously  collected at the time he took the genealogy. Tindale did not identify his ‘ego’ (that is, the person from whom he  collected the genealogy) although this, too, may sometimes be inferred by  his cross reference to a record card (e.g. ‘R726’). These cards were prepared  by Tindale or by his co-researchers and contain additional data collected  on such things as social history, ‘tribal affiliation’ or anthropometric  data, depending on the expedition and his style of research at the time.  The cards sometimes provide additional data and are worth consulting,  if they are available. Tindale also took portrait photographs of his subjects  Figure 9.1: Tindale sheet 89 collected from Point Pearce, SA, in 1939 source: Genealogy reproduced by kind permission of the board for Anthropological  Research Collection, south Australian museum.

GENEAloGIEs I have provided a copy of one of Tindale’s 1939 genealogies as Figure 9.1.  Tindale collected this genealogy from Point Pearce on 6 March in that  year. He generally wrote the place of collection at the head of the chart,  along with the date, while the numbering of the genealogies makes  referencing unambiguous.  Genealogies such as the one shown above provide useful information in  native title research, provided of course that they can be directly linked to  the claimants. Difficulties arise when names are uncertain or when names  very common at the time they were collected by Tindale may result in  misidentification. So, for example, if a family know they had a forebear  whose name was Daisy it is possible to erroneously assume that a woman  in a Tindale genealogy with this name was that woman. Consequently, it is  important to cross-check other details like date of birth, place of residence  or ‘caste’ (which Tindale often included in his annotations) to provide  greater certainty as to the applicability of the genealogy. Tindale sometimes  collected the name of the same person on more than one genealogy and  appears to have been quite thorough in providing cross-references to these  names. It is important, then, to check these cross-referenced sheets to see  what other information might be available there relating to the family.  Tindale’s annotations are sometimes hard to read and copies provided  through Native Title Representative Bodies are always photocopies of the  originals (which are held at the South Australian Museum in Adelaide),  while some are clearly copies of copies with resultant deterioration. I have  even come across copies that have been amended by an unknown hand,  and in one case some names were actually crossed out and rendered  illegible – presumably because someone disagreed with Tindale’s record of  the family. Perhaps the greatest and most frequent point of dispute relates  to the ‘tribal’ identity, which may be the subject of subsequent debate  particularly in areas where group names were variable or inconsistently  applied.   Working with Tindale’s genealogies requires practice and patience,  extensive cross-checking where this is possible and sound contemporary  fieldwork to ensure that the genealogy considered is indeed relevant to the  family being researched. At their best Tindale’s genealogies may provide  evidence of an ancestor’s links to the application area. By calculating birth  dates backwards from those Tindale supplies, individuals represented in  Tindale’s oldest generation level may be shown to have been in possession  of the claim area at the time of effective sovereignty. At their worst,  Tindale’s genealogies provide data that is inconsistent with other materials  219 </page> <page sequence="14"> AusTRAlIAN NATIvE TITlE ANThRopoloGy and contrary to the evidence of the claimants. In any event, if there is  a Tindale genealogy relevant to a forebear of a claimant, it must be properly  and comprehensively assessed, taking into account the circumstances of  its collection, Tindale’s purpose in making it and any other data that may  be relevant to the conclusions and opinions that may be drawn from it.  Genealogies and adoption Adoptive relationships are common in native title genealogical accounts.  Some are asserted to be of some antiquity (that is, said to have occurred  three or more ascending generations above ego) but others may be  comparatively recent. The former may be subject to some differences of  opinion amongst claimants when relied upon to assert membership of the  claimant group. Since both the adoptee and adopting parent or parents  are now long dead, it is not possible to gain first-hand field data about  the adoptive relationship, its qualities and characteristics. Consequently,  forming a view about the nature of the adoptive relationship must rely  on the memory of the claimants or, most likely, on an oral tradition of  unknown pedigree. The reliability of such conclusions is readily open  to negative scrutiny.  At the heart of the difficulty is the concept of filiation. Anthropologists  distinguish between descent and filiation (Sutton 2003, 188–191; Meyer  Fortes 1959, 203). Filiation can be understood as the relationship between  a child and his or her parents and grandparents, as recognised by peers and  relations. Filiation in this context is the social, emotional and practical  aspects of a family relationship between parent and child.5 The substance  of these relationships is the flux that quickens the descent of rights through  genealogical connection. ‘One-step filiation’, ‘two-step filiation’ and ‘serial  filiation’ are terms used to accommodate relationships between ego and  their parent, grandparent and through successive ascending generations,  respectively (Sutton 2003, 188). Descent is somewhat different and has  been defined as ‘a genealogical connexion recognised between a person  and  any of his ancestors or ancestresses. It is established by tracing  a pedigree’ (Meyer Fortes 1959, 206). 5  Oxford English Dictionary, filiation: ‘the fact of being the child of a specified parent.

GENEAloGIEs It is commonly the case in native title claims that claimants cite serial  filiative links with known forebears as the basis for their claims to  country. Sutton observes, ‘members of a descent group share a common,  identifiable individual ancestor, or sometimes a set of ancestors such  as two or three siblings, or a married couple, from whom they reckon  their group membership’ (2003, 189). Consequently, the normative  system that is relied upon to determine rights to country is one based on  descent from a named ancestor and the filiative links to ego’s parents and  grandparents. These filiative links generally rely on consanguineal ties. But  in some cases they must rely on other forms of filiation, such as adoption.  Transforming adoption into descent with recognition of filiation requires  the transformation of a baby (or child) into a son or daughter. That such  a transformation has taken place requires community acceptance in order  to have validity within the country group membership. Social recognition  and non-recognition are creatures of social relationships, local politics,  personal preferences, antagonisms and even grudges. The question that  generally excites debate is whether an adopted child, who is not a member  of a country group lineage by birth, can acquire filiation through adoption.  It is the anthropologist’s job to show that the recognition of descent  within an adoptive relationship is neither arbitrary nor contingent but  rather based upon a system of customary principles.  A useful first step is to determine whether the idea of adoption is  recognised in the Indigenous language of the claimants and is the subject  of laws and customs. In some areas where I have worked, I have been  able to collect a term from the claimants’ language that translates as  ‘adopted’. In some cases the term is glossed as ‘growing up’ which may  be understood to carry the meaning that the child is ‘just like’ a natural  child in terms of gaining rights to country. However, the ethnography  is the determining factor when deciding how to represent an adopted  child on a genealogical chart and how they should be described in the  explanatory text. Generally, in my experience, it is often accepted that if  a man or woman ‘grew up’ a baby, then it would be accepted as his or her  natural child. By amalgamating field data in relation to such principles  that can be understood to endorse the view that an adoptive relationship  has become equal to and indistinguishable from a relationship based on  descent, implied filiation can be understood to provide a relationship that  bears graphic representation as a child on a native title genealogy. 221 </page> <page sequence="16"> AusTRAlIAN NATIvE TITlE ANThRopoloGy The difficulties that develop from complete reliance on an oral tradition  with respect to adoptive relationships that are asserted to have occurred  in times prior to the claimants’ recollection finds no simple resolution.  Sometimes it is possible to locate independent archival references that  support the fact of an asserted adoption. For example, I once found  a reference in a Native Welfare File that a man had paid all the education  expenses of a child who was not his natural daughter, which lent weight  to the assertion that he was the child’s adopted father. In other cases I have  canvassed a range of views from numerous claimants and found a clear  consensus that an adoptive relationship was ‘the same as’ one based on  biological descent. However, I have also come across many cases where an  asserted adoption was subject to dispute amongst claimants. In these cases  the best that can be done is to provide an account of the competing views  and any relevant laws and customs and set out such independent archival  accounts as might be available. In this way an expert view can be provided  if there is sufficient data available – otherwise, the anthropologist must  simply state that there is insufficient data available to form a concluded  view as the claimant testimony is contested. In such cases it may be  a matter to be determined by the court.  Genealogical truth W.H.R. Rivers was sanguine about the accuracy of the genealogies he  collected on Murray and Mabuiag islands. He described his ‘extensive  genealogies’ as possessing ‘a high degree of accuracy’ (Rivers 1900, 76).  On  Murray he obtained genealogies ‘from two or more independent  sources, with the result that different accounts corroborated one another  to  an extent which forms the best guarantee of the truthfulness and  accuracy of memory of the natives’ (ibid., 76). On Mabuiag Island, Rivers: often compiled [his] genealogies sitting in the huts, or on the sand, with a  crowd of women and children sitting round listening to the information  which the men were giving me. In some cases, even the women were  consulted. Often I was able to get several of the older men together, who  consulted about points of detail, and it was obvious that some were looked  up to by the rest as authorities on the subject. (ibid., 76) Cross-checking and collaboration were the tools Rivers used to bring  some certainty to the oral genealogical account. I stated above in the  section ‘Methodological and procedural issues’ that, in the contested field  222 </page> <page sequence="17"> 9 . GENEAloGIEs of native title genealogical research, discussing family history with anyone  other than the members of the family in question can be controversial.  However, checking genealogical details before a jural public can provide  confirmation of a general acceptance of the account as rendered – or,  alternatively, alert the researcher to potential disputed ground. The  availability of genealogies collected by earlier researchers, particularly  those produced in the pre–native title area, provides a useful corrective  to and confirmation of the contemporary account, although there is no  certainty that genealogies collected by Elkin, Kaberry, Radcliffe-Brown or  Tindale (and others) were without error. Rivers sought to establish that  his data ‘possessed a high degree of accuracy’ (ibid., 77). In native title  inquiries the anthropologist can strive for the best genealogical account  available. However, there should be a clear qualification to any genealogical  account that it is founded on data that reflect a social construction of the  past. Orally transmitted genealogies are best understood as one account  of family relationships and a representation of the way people understand  themselves to be related to others, both living and dead. This means that  oral genealogical accounts derived from different claimants may exhibit  differences in detail or even in how relationships are calculated. In an  oral genealogical tradition, the nature of relationships in the third and  higher ascending generation level is sometimes assumed, imprecise or not  remembered. Additionally, some relationships in lower generation levels  may not be accurately recalled, particularly in the case of an extended  family with numerous affinal relationships and many children. The larger  the genealogy, the greater is the likelihood of errors or variations  being identified. Genealogies will need to be subject to correction and  emendation as new information comes to light. It is best to set out these  qualifications as to the accuracy of the oral account at the beginning  of any discussion of the genealogical data.  In some cases the oral account can be corroborated by historical or other  documentary sources, as I have discussed above. The accuracy of archival  records should not be taken for granted. Government officials were  susceptible to error and prone to misunderstandings, particularly in cross- cultural encounters. The use of historical sources provides an adjunct to  an oral account, enabling the construction of genealogies, in some cases,  beyond that which relies on the comparatively shallow oral account.  223 </page> <page sequence="18"> AusTRAlIAN NATIvE TITlE ANThRopoloGy Managing genealogical data Anyone who has attempted to assemble genealogical accounts will know  all too well that data are multitudinous and their representation poses  some formidable challenges. In times past it was usual for anthropologists  to draw up their genealogies by hand on long sheets of paper, glued end  on end such that the total length of the genealogy was measured in many  yards. There was, I recall, a certain pride that characterised some PhD  research, occasioned by citing the length of the accompanying genealogy.  These mute memorials to the genealogical method were inaccessible,  impractical and had little to recommend them. Fortunately, the digital  age has rendered them redundant and provided a range of alternatives that  are now important tools for native title research. Genealogical programs are widely available on the internet for download  or obtainable in some stores. Prices are generally well below $100 and  most provide updates, web support and tutorials. The principal problem  with this software is its evident ephemeral nature, its sustainability over  different operating platforms over time and the compatibility of different  programs. At the time of writing (early 2018), two formerly popular  programs (Family Tree Maker and The Master Genealogist) used by many  Land Councils and Native Title Representative Bodies were no longer  available as stand-alone programs, although many of us continued to use  our existing software successfully. Despite the apparent demise of these  programs, a search on the internet revealed 10 other programs that were  readily available for purchase that appeared to perform in a very similar  manner to those with which I am familiar. The choice of the software  program is a matter for the commissioning organisation, which needs to  consider suitability, cost, reliability and ease of use as well as security.  Consultants undertaking genealogical research should be asked to use  the same software or ensure that they can readily generate the common  genealogical transfer data file (known as a GEDCOM file).6 Organisations  6  ‘GEDCOM (an acronym standing for Genealogical Data Communication) is an open de facto  specification for exchanging genealogical data between different genealogy software. GEDCOM was  developed by The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) as an aid to genealogical  research. A GEDCOM file is plain text (usually either ANSEL or ASCII) containing genealogical  information about individuals, and meta data linking these records together. Most genealogy software  supports importing from and exporting to GEDCOM format. However, some genealogy software  programs incorporate the use of proprietary extensions to the format, which are not always recognized  by other genealogy programs, such as the GEDCOM 5.5 EL (Extended Locations) specification.  While GEDCOM X and several other files have been suggested as replacements, the current 1996  version remains the industry standard 20 years on.’ www.en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GEDCOM accessed  28 November 2016. 224 </page> <page sequence="19"> 9 . GENEAloGIEs will need to ensure that they maintain and update their genealogical  files on a regular basis and that this is undertaken by a person who has  had proper training and is equipped to manage the system and generate  the data required. Genealogical databases are vulnerable to mis-entries,  duplication and even erasure, so they need to be managed according to  the same standards that apply to accounting software and digital archives.  This is no simple or cheap task. However, genealogical databases will  be required in the post-determination administration and will be of  fundamental importance to the management of any benefits that develop  from the recognition of native title. It is, then, essential to get this aspect  of data management right from the outset. Genealogical databases have significant advantages over hand-drawn  charts. First, they can be easily updated should new or corrective material  come to light. Second, they are easily accessible. Any named individual in  the database can be readily found and details of his or her relationships,  children, partners and personal particulars recovered. Third, they are  easily used by the researcher in the field (on laptop or tablet), obviating  the necessity to do battle with yards (metres) of paper. Fourth, they allow  easy input of additional data including all important authorities for  information, scanned copies of archival materials including genealogies,  certificates and photographs. A single entry is, then, a gateway to a whole  volume of supportive data, readily available to the researcher. Finally, they  are easily transmissible in toto and relatively flexible and adaptive to other  formats.  Some of these evident advantages also bring with them incipient dangers.  Genealogical databases are vulnerable and like any digital content can be  easily erased or corrupted. The research, then, needs to ensure that the  database is properly managed and that it is subject to regular backups.  The generation of digital charts (most programs have a choice of several  different ones) is no substitute for publishing paper charts for safekeeping.  Generally the charts produced by genealogical software do not provide  for the symbols common to anthropological genealogical charts (as noted  above) but rather produce names in boxes, with males distinguished from  female by the nature of the box border – choice being afforded to the user  in this regard. In some cases a hand drawn chart may be a better option  for a native title report if some details or particulars are required to be  shown. However, in terms of time and resources the production of digital  charts by a genealogical program (whether printed out or not) is a far  better option than attempting to draw extensive genealogies by hand –  as was the case in times past. 225 </page> <page sequence="20"> AusTRAlIAN NATIvE TITlE ANThRopoloGy The wealth of data that can be included in a genealogical database has  significant implications for security and the protection of personal  information. This is a matter that the researcher will need to discuss with  the commissioning organisation, prior to the development of the database.  Organisations holding genealogical databases will also need to consider  the security of their genealogical materials in the same way as they seek  to protect legal, accounting or written documents that are confidential to  their organisation. A genealogical database, like any digital compilation, is only as good as  the data entered into it. I have inherited numerous genealogical databases,  initiated by unknown researchers in times past with varying degrees of  skill and accuracy. Sometimes it has taken me many hours to correct errors  in the database, eliminate duplicate names and fix up wrong relationships.  Genealogical databases are an essential tool of native title research.  Like other aspects of this very practical enterprise, their use, maintenance  and data input needs to be undertaken by those properly qualified  and equipped for the complex task at hand. Genealogical research should  never be seen as a secondary and lesser research task. It requires careful  thought, adequate resources and experienced and trained researchers. 226 </page> </plain_text>
