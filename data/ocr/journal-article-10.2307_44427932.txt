<plain_text><page sequence="1">Shin Takamatsu in conversation with Thomas Danieli Shin Takamatsu, House with a Cross, 1985</page><page sequence="2">Like many others , I succumbed very early to the true believer's fanatical search for that noble realm once proudly referred to as the 'autonomy of architecture'. I dreamed of a world where an exquisite architectural lexicon reigned, a language so pure and lofty that it could be described only with ringing phrases like 'architecture for architecture and by architecture '. Hardly pausing to wonder whether I was qualified for the role, I imagined myself a kind of wizard presiding over afastidiously sterilised laboratory equipped with clever contrivances, in which my introspections on the modern in architecture and the brutal rationalism of modernity would surely foster an architectural language whose validity would allow it to transcend all historical contexts. Shin Takamatsu, 'The Kyoto Origins of Non-Conceptual Fornť, 1988 Shin Takamatsu rose to fame during Japan's economic bubble, the brief, lunatic period from the mid-1980s to the early 1990s when it seemed as if the more outlandish the designer, the easier it was to receive commissions. Preco- ciously talented, Takamatsu had begun to build while still in his late 20s, and quickly accumu- lated a portfolio of tiny but significant projects - a kimono manufacturer, a geisha house, a Buddhist temple - that simultaneously respected cultural traditions and overturned architectural conventions. The designs attracted so much attention he soon found himself being invited to produce flagship buildings for prestigious private corporations and major public institutions. Takamatsu 's early success was in large part due to his drawing skills, compellingly demon- strated in the large chiaroscuro depictions of plans, sections and elevations he created for all his projects. The dedication these entailed was barely credible - it could take a month to complete a single drawing, a display of preternatural creativity and obsession that attracted cultishly devoted staff members willing to work through TD We are here at y our office in Kyoto, the city in which you live and work, and with which your architecture and y our personal image is inseparably linked. But in fact you were not born here. Could y ou describe where you grew up? st It was a tiny place nobody has ever heard of - a coastal town called Nima, in Shimane prefec- ture, north of Hiroshima. I was born there in 1948 and stayed until I was about 18. Back then, only about a quarter of the children there went to secondary school. Most of us were destined to become fishermen or plaster- ers. For some reason my town produced many artisan plasterers. They would do their appren- ticeships in Nima and then move to Osaka, where there was plenty of work. If they became successful, they would then summon their sons to join them. That was the system. Even though I was among the minority who went to school, I never really studied because I thought that I too would eventually become a fisherman or a construction worker. These seemed to be the only options available to me. Naturally, at that time I had absolutely no knowledge of the existence of architecture. I basically had no idea what I wanted to become. As a child, I was also not especially healthy, physically, so my mother often forced me to stay home from school. While I was resting I just drew pictures. Back then, newspaper advertisements were loose the night, every night, and international admirers that included former aa chairman Alvin Boyarsky, who produced a lavish folio edition of Takamatsu's work. The architecture he was rendering in graphite took its imagery almost entirely from machines - menacing chrome-and-steel elements reminiscent of medieval armour and weaponry, locomotive engines, anthropomorphic robots, circuit- boards, and so on. Simultaneously futuristic and archaic, this proto-steampunk vision not only became his personal architectural ¡signature, but was plagiarised in Hollywood set designs, most obviously the noir backdrop of Gotham City in Tim Burton's 1989 Batman , for which designer Anton Fürst hoped to create 'the ugliest and bleakest metropolis imaginable'. Takamatsu has long chosen to base himself in the ancient capital Kyoto, about as far from ugly, bleak and metropolitan as one could imagine. Serene and sophisticated, the city has inserts printed on only one side of the paper. And so I would save the advertisements and spend all my time drawing on the back of them. I really loved drawing. TD Didyou always draw in pencil? st In pencil, in crayon, in anything I could find. I also loved using my hands to make things. I couldn't afford plastic or other modelling materials, so I mostly had to use leftover bits of wood and bamboo and scrap pieces of metal. Even so, I made some outra- geous things. My most ambitious project was a submarine big enough to carry three passen- gers. Because I was living in a fishing port, I was surrounded by workshops where the boats would be repaired. Even primary school children knew how to weld. So when there were no adults around I used one of the workshops to construct my submarine. I even added ballast been the incubator for almost everything usually thought to exemplify traditional Japanese culture. In such a setting Takamatsu's buildings may appear incongruous, but their intricately ornamented facades and crepuscular spaces are arguably as much in keeping with Kyoto's heritage as the contrived wabisabi minimalism of its Zen Buddhist temples and gardens. I spoke with Takamatsu on a Sunday afternoon in early 2017 at his office, a concrete fortress of his own design located in the southern part of the city. Every document I had mentioned in our pre-interview communication was neatly arrayed on the table top. An alert factotum was on hand to fetch anything that might be missing, as well as replenish the green tea, take notes and refer to a Japanese-English dictionary for those moments when communi- cation stumbled. Takamatsu's own recording equipment was running in parallel with mine. With everything in place and under control, Takamatsu was happy to speak freely, chuckling with mischievous humour, his speech patterns and anecdotes just as polished, inventive and idiosyncratic as his architecture. - Thomas Danieli tanks and attached a small motor. On the maiden voyage everything worked smoothly enough to begin with, but as soon as I opened the tanks and dropped below the water surface the pressure pulled my welds apart and the whole thing disintegrated. I barely escaped. Still, it was an amazing thing, considering it was the work of a child. I also once made a rifle that could fire one shot at a time. As soon as people heard about it the town policeman was called. He was absolutely furious. I didn't make it alone - there were three of us - but I was the ringleader. All our parents were summoned. I can't remember our punishment but we were in serious trouble. Still, it didn't deter me. I think the next thing I made was a hovercraft. I got an engine from a motorbike shop owned by the father of a classmate, and patched some rubber together for the inflating cushion. It worked too, floating above the ground, for a few seconds at least... ah, the things I got up to as a child. TD So you have always been interested in designing and drawing machines? st Well, when I made those machines I drew what you might call construction drawings. But because I didn't really know how to do such drawings, I just did sketches of how I thought the machines should be made. Then I cut, bent, welded and bolted the steel plates together. aa files 75 99</page><page sequence="3">TD Did you do all this together with your siblings? st I have no siblings. I had an older brother, but he died from an illness when I was very young. I don't even remember his face. But there were other children nearby, all connected to my family. My grandfather also lived in Nima, where he ran a hotel. He was quite a character. He had many what you might call 'concubines', with whom he fathered lots of children. The women lived around and about, but I would often visit them with my grandfather, so there were lots of children for me to play with. My grandfather took good care of all of them and encouraged me to call them my brothers and sisters. TD How old were you whenyou decided to study architecture? st Architecture only came later. In those early years I just knew that I wanted a career that involved making things. One of my grandfather's concubines lived close to Izumo Taisha (Izumo Grand Shrine), one of the most important sites in the Japanese Shinto religion. So while I was at primary school I would often go to visit her with my grandfather, playing with the local children in the grounds of the shrine. I remember one evening I was left there by myself, after all the other kids had been called home by their parents. I was completely alone. The sun was setting. And I suddenly became aware of the powerful impression made by the main hall of Izumo Taisha. Right at that moment I thought, 'I want to make things like this.' But that thought was totally unrelated to the word 'architecture'. TD Kiy onori Kikutake, oneofthemetabolist architects , designed the nearby Izumo Grand Shrine Administration Building ; which was completed in 1963, whenyou would have been 15. Do you remember seeing it? And did it, too, have an impact? st Yes, I liked it, though my favourite work of his is Toku'un-ji Temple Ossuary, which he built a couple of years later. But I didn't know who Kikutake was until much later. My parents told me that the people who made things like Izumo Taisha were kenchikuka (architects), members of the building profession. To my childish understanding this seemed to suggest that they were carpenters, but I thought that surely a carpenter could never make something like that. Around the time I was also struck by photographs of two, quite distinct pieces of architecture printed in the newspaper. One was Hans Hollein's Retti Candle Shop in Vienna (1965). The image was really grainy, and so I had no idea how tiny it was in reality - 1 was surprised when I first visited the building - but there was something very compelling about it. The second was a photograph of the Yoyogi National Gymnasium for the 1964 Tokyo Olympics. The caption said it was the work of an architect called Kenzo Tange. I thought, 'Aha, this is it!' So by the time I entered secondary school I knew I wanted to be an architect, or more specifically I wanted to become Kenzo Tange. TD Tange was also teaching at the University of Tokyo. Why, then, did you choose togo to Kyoto University? st I actually did want to go to the University of Tokyo, precisely because of Tange, but when it came time to apply my mother was unwell and so I chose Kyoto University so as not to be too far away from her. The other problem was that the secondary school I attended was basically just a vocational school, but I knew that to become an architect I had to go to university. So I had to enrol in a special class for students intending to sit the university entrance exams. I did very little work for the first two years, but in my third year I got serious about my studies, and passed the exam for Kyoto University. TD Who did y ou study under there? st When I arrived, the professor I knew most about was Uzo Nishiyama. Everyone used to say that architectural education in the east of Japan was centred around Kenzo Tange, whereas in the west it was Uzo Nishiyama. But when I looked at some essays and books by Nishiyama I soon realised that he was not a designer but a planner, and I had my heart set on studying design. At the same time, I became aware of Tomoya Masuda, the other main design professor there. I looked closely at his works, but even to my untrained eye they seemed like little more than copies of Le Corbusier, which left me unsure as to exactly who I should study under. TD I think Tomoya Masuda 's writings have been more influential than his buildings. He introduced a very intellectual, philosophical approach to architectural education at Kyoto University, a kind of humanities-based education, which was controversial considering the architec- ture department was part of the faculty of engineer- ing. I know he was particularly interested in the writings of thirteenth-century Buddhist monk Dõgen, fourteenth-century Noh actor Zeami and twentieth-century philosopher Martin Heidegger. I guess they were linked by a kind ofphenomeno- logicalway of thinking, but more importantly, they were each very interested in language. Dõgen was a poet as well as the author of the first Zen monastic code written in Japanese, but he reputedly wrote in a very lyrical and allusive style, full of neologisms and wordplay. Zeami wrote Fūshikaden, a seminal treatise on Noh theatre and Japanese aesthetics, the source of many aphorisms and images in Japanese popular culture. Heidegger, of course, spent a lot of time on etymological analysis, inventing neologisms, and using conventional words in unconventional ways. Masuda drew on all this to write his theoretical texts on architectural space in very complex prose, using obscure Chinese terms. Your own essays are also very difficult to understand or translate. You may not have been influenced by Masuda's architecture, but perhaps you were influenced by his writing? st Well, the earliest influence on my writing was my grandfather - he especially loved classical Chinese literature and poetry, which I was forced to read as a child. So in a sense, it was quite easy for me to understand Masuda's writings. They seem very logical, but if you look closely they are quite intuitive and emotional. I was strongly attracted by that. His discussions of Dõgen were really interesting. I actually had a good relationship with him. He liked going bar-hopping at night, and I would sometimes tag along. I remember one particular night he called me, saying that he was out with a maiko (trainee geisha), which was slightly unusual. I immediately went to join them. We were drinking beside the Takase River, in the middle of Kyoto. At some point, we were arguing and I pushed him into the water. He ended up soaking wet, but laughing. That somehow cemented our friendship. He enjoyed things like that. I liked his style. When Masuda drank, he was really amusing. Of course, he talked only about architecture. Or about women. One or the other. Anyway, while I was still trying to decide on a design professor, the student protests began, and the engineering faculty was badly affected. There were no classes at all, and so there was no architectural design teaching either. TD Kyoto University has always been a famously left-wing institution, particularly in the engineeringfaculty. The rivalry at the time was apparently between the left and the extreme left - the planning department under Uzo Nishiyama was considered leftist, even Stalinist, while the design department under Tomoya Masuda was considered ultra-leftist, Trotskyite. Naturally, the structural engineers were centrists. Whose side were you on? st Well, as a student I joined Zenkyõtõ (All-Campus Joint Struggle Committee) at Kyoto University. Basically, street demonstrations and sit-ins were our main activity. We were the reason no classes could be held at the engineer- ing faculty, or anywhere else in the university. Professors couldn't even enter their classrooms, but they sometimes posted assignments on the walls outside, for the design studios, as well as classes in history, disaster prevention, structures and so on. Even while protesting I did all the set assignments, so I could pass enough classes to graduate. But I would take the assignments simply as starting points, from which I'd search for unconventional solutions. As well as submitting the results to the professor who set each assignment, I would always show them all to Kiyoshi Kawasaki, one of the few professors there I admired. He was an assistant professor in Matsuda's lab, and a great designer - 1 think his Tochigi Prefectural Museum of Fine Arts (1972) is a masterpiece. After I met him I realised that 100 aa files 75</page><page sequence="4">Clockwise from top left: as a child; playing American football for Kyoto University; on-site; on his motorcycle; in front of Pharaoh; waving from a school bus; in his office, early 1980s</page><page sequence="5">Medical City, section and model, Kyoto University thesis project, 1971</page><page sequence="6">he'd also designed a building near where I was born - the Hikawa Agricultural Cooperative Hall (1965) - that I'd always found interesting. Anyway, in that first year in Kyoto I did about ten assignments, and even though Kawasaki had set only one or two of them, I showed him my responses to all ten - I'd always be waiting for him in front of his office with my work, regard- less of whether he had set it. When he arrived he'd sigh, 'Oh, notTakamatsu again.' Neverthe- less, he would always give me very precise critiques. So my education at Kyoto University was basically a lot of self-directed study, with intermittent advice from Kawasaki. TD In the late 1960s, I guess just before the protests began, several of the architecture professors at Kyoto University - Uzo Nishiyama, Atsushi Ueda as well as Kiyoshi Kawasaki - were involved with the masterplanningofExpo 70 in Osaka. Did you participate in any way? st No. My priority was earning a living - and not just for me. I'd married right after entering university. My wife was from the same secondary school in Nima, and she soon joined me in Kyoto. She also enrolled at the university, but then temporarily dropped out to help support us while I studied. We had our first child soon after that. Of course, children cost money, and an ordinary part-time job could never provide enough. But the economy at the time was good, and there was lots of construc- tion work available, mainly because of the expo. I'd heard there was a particular shortage of bulldozer drivers, and so I quickly got a licence and took on part-time work at the expo site. It paid very well. TD Was it easy to get a licence? st It was then. All you had to do was take a couple of bottles of whisky to the licensing office and they'd give you one! TD Were you working every day? st Not every day. I did it in parallel with my 'self-study' at the university. I also played American football for Kyoto University. I didn't want to quit - we were second place in the league - so during the day I did my coursework and played football, and several nights a week - in the middle of the night, because the expo site was open 24 hours a day - 1 drove a bulldozer. I was busy. The only time I could catch a little sleep was in the mornings. One night I was so tired that I fell asleep behind the wheel of the bulldozer and knocked over a telephone pole. All the phone lines in the neighbourhood were cut off! TD What did you think of the expo itself? st I didn't go after it opened because I'd already seen almost everything while I was working on site. I thought a lot of it was utterly worthless. But I did like the Big Roof by Tange. That was great. I watched its entire construction process. TD Did you meet Tange or Arata Isozaki at the time? st No. I only really experienced the expo from my bulldozer. I would sometimes see Tange in the distance, a small man walking around with a self-important air. I thought, 'Ah, that's how an architect behaves!' TD Afier the expo opened in 1970 the student demonstrations stopped and university classes started again, which meant you could graduate. What was your thesis project? st It was for a 'medical city'. That was the moment that my wife had resumed her studies to be a doctor. Our first child was a little older, so we thought we could manage. Her training made me think about healthcare and aging, which became the theme of my thesis project. I knew it would be an outrageously ambitious proposal and so I actually started work the moment I entered my final year. Every day counted, especially because we then had a second baby, so I was the one looking after the children at home. This also meant I knew I would have no money to go on to graduate school, but at least I could concentrate on the design project without also having to worry about studying for the postgraduate entrance exams. My plan was to go and work for a famous architect immediately after graduation. The model I made for my medical city was huge. It took up one whole room of our two-room apartment, meaning the four of us had to conduct our daily lives in the other room. The drawings were all done with Rotring pens ... remember them? They were expensive, but I ruined plenty of nibs producing those drawings. TD Was your thesis advisor Kiyoshi Kawasaki? st No, I didn't receive any direct supervi- sion for any of my university work, including the thesis project. Other students were super- vised by various professors, but I didn't trust any of them. TD The design is for a city on water, like a metabolist project. Was there a real site? st Yes, Lake Biwa in Shiga Prefecture. I admit there are certain similarities to Kiyonori Kikutake's Marine City (1958), but I wasn't especially influenced by metabolism. At that time I was more interested in people like Louis Kahn, James Stirling and Paul Rudolph. Antonio Sant'Elia was also an influence, certainly on the way I sketched. I learned about most of these architects through Kawasaki's recommendations. TD I know you spent several years working for Kawasaki after you graduated. Did y ou ever work for anyone else? st While I was still a student I told Kawasaki some of the architects I was interested in working for, such as Kiyonori Kikutake, Fumihiko Maki and Masato Ohtaka. He kindly wrote a reference letter to Ohtaka. I was invited to an interview with Ohtaka and accepted right away, so as soon as I graduated I went to work at his office in Tokyo. My family stayed in Kyoto. On the first day I looked around the studio while everybody was working. It all looked so utterly boring. They seemed to be designing nothing but public housing. Still, I thought it had to be in some way worthwhile, so I told myself to be patient and give it a try. I lasted a week before I went and knocked on Ohtaka's door and asked permission to quit. He knew that I was married and had a young family back in Kyoto, and so he probably thought that was the reason. Much later, after I had started my own practice, whenever I met Ohtaka he would invariably say, 'You were my shortest-lived employee ever!' TD Whose office did you join after your return? st There were no positions available in Kyoto, so I decided to go back to university and do a master's degree. I visited Kawasaki to talk about it. He had just moved to Osaka University, and at the same time had established an office of his own in Kyoto. He said, 'Takamatsu,you can come and work for me.' I told him I wanted to get a master's degree instead, but he replied 'That's fine. Work at my place anyway, and I'll give you the time off to go to school.' So I decided I would go back to university for two years while earning a salary from Kawasaki. TD Didyou again do your design projects without supervision from the professors? st I didn't want to study design. I was more interested in learning the history of Japanese architecture. In particular, I wanted to better understand Izumo Taisha and Shinto architec- ture, which had made such an impression on me as a child. So I went to talk with the history professor, Mitsugu Kawakami, but he tried to talk me out of it: 'Why on earth would someone like you want to study history?' Undeterred, I applied to Kawakami 's lab, and he accepted me. But I never attended a single class. I just went to work at Kawasaki's office every day. TD What projects were you in charge of there? st Well, first I had to learn how to do proper technical drawings. But I was soon assigned various projects. The first was for a small public hall in Hikasa. Kawasaki completely entrusted it to me. He just said, 'You do it.' The approach was exactly the same as when I was a student: I design it, he criticises it, I adjust it. I learned a lot that way. Then I did the Fuj ino Kindergarten, for which he also let me do as I pleased. Even now, he is generous enough never to claim that either of those buildings are his works. In fact, his only contribution to the kindergarten was its orientation. A railway line ran alongside the site and Kawasaki looked at my plan and said, 'Rotate it 90 degrees, so the children can watch the trains from the classroom windows.' That was his only design input. TD There 's a rumour that y ou also designed Kawasaki's own house. st That's true. I did. It was a bit later, and I still don't quite know why he entrusted it to me. aa files 75 103</page><page sequence="7">I also worked on a number of competitions, including a masterplan for Nishi-Umeda High Town, for which we came second. TD Did you also complete your master's degree , despite never having gone to class? st Yes. The theme of my dissertation was decoration. That is to say, icons and symbolism, not merely ornamentation. Historically, decoration has always been understood as something added, a question of essential rationality versus auxiliary beauty. I was interested in the realm in between, and so I made a study of decoration that cannot be detached from architectural space. TD Did Kawakami have much impact on your research? st None. I had no supervision. I did my own reading and wrote the text by myself, by hand. It was tremendously long - still today, I think it's the longest thesis ever submitted to the Kyoto University architecture department. Then I enrolled in the PhD programme, but in the disaster prevention lab, not history - Mitsugu Kawakami said, 'You don't need a doctorate! I can't supervise you!' - but I never completed it anyway. I decided to leave Kawa- saki's office and set up on my own. But even while I was still working for him, in the evenings I was doing my own competition entries and small commissions, including a house for my wife's older brother. TD What kind of relationships did you have with other architects in the 1970s? st The architect I knew best was Monta Mozuna. He had an office near Kobe University, and I'd been hanging out there during my postgraduate studies. I liked his style. Toyokazu Watanabe was also very close to Mozuna, and he would often visit the office too. They'd always be engaging each other in debate. I was heavily influenced by both of them. They were also both doing amazing work, utterly incomprehensible architecture, but I was more interested in its sculptural power than its spatial qualities. TD Mozuna was part of a small group of radical ', unruly architects that called themelves Basara f which Watanabe was also close to. st ^ut not when I was hanging out there. Basara was founded later by Osamu Ishiyama and a few others, after I'd started to produce my first works. I began to spend time with Ishiyama and Toyo Ito, who assumed that I was part of their generation, but actually I'm a bit younger. Perhaps because of this they were especially influential. But the other thing that really affected me at the time was the magazine Toshi Jütaku (Urban House), which featured very small, often quite idiosyncratic houses, and had sensationally good editing. Basara and other architects of that generation all made their debuts on the pages of Toshi Jütaku. Its editor, Makoto Uyeda, really ignited the fire of that movement. Without him, all those designers of small houses might never have become fully fledged architects. TD Something that has always surprised me about Toshi Jūtaku is thatKazuo Shinohara , arguably the era's most influential designer and theorist of small houses, never once appeared in the magazine. The relationship seems to have been difficult. Were you connected with Shinohara in any way? st I only met him once, much later, in Paris, after my own practice had become well estab- lished. But I agree with your assessment of Shinohara's importance. I rate him higher than anyone else from that period. His work repre- sents a Japanese Neue Sachlichkeit , that directly conveys the power of architecture. I was amazed by his Tanikawa House (1974). It's like a pigsty on a slope. When I first saw it I couldn't believe that such a house was possible. I feel the same about House Under High-Voltage Lines (1981). Those two buildings convert their contextual conditions directly into architecture. They had a tremendous impact. Nobody has yet surpassed them. As you know, a school of followers formed around Shinohara, which included younger architects like Ito, Itsuko Hasegawa and Kazunari Sakamoto. I think Sakamoto was perhaps the closest to Shinohara in his style and way of thinking. TD In the late 1970s Hiroshi Hara seemed to want to create a similar school of his own, by assembling a group of young architects for a special issue o/Kenchiku Bunka magazine published in 1979. It included you, Osamu Ishiyama, Tadao Ando, Riken Yamamoto, Monta Mozuna... st Hara sent an open letter to about ten young architects, then selected a smaller group to meet in person. And yes, I was one of them. We were invited to spend three days at a villa he'd designed in Izu. We had to debate architec- ture the whole time, from morning till night. TD It must have been fascinating. st It was the worst, most tedious experience imaginable. Hara led the discussions, and his mandate was actually very clear and lucid - he wanted us to find new words to express space - but the only way to do this, apparently, was to sit around leafing through a dictionary, page by page. I don't think we came up with a single useful word or concept. It was utterly dreadful. I never want to do anything like that again. TD Did it nonetheless lead to the formation of a new group, as Hara hoped, or at least some good friendships? st Well, I had known all of them from before, anyway, partly because of Toshi Jütaku and another great monthly magazine, Japan Interior Design, which alongside interiors also published the most aggressive, radical architec- ture. The photography, especially, was amazing and the editor, Jukan (Masaru) Kawadoko, remains a close friend. Back then, his editorial office was our Tokyo base. It became like a salon where we could have debates and exchange information. I was based in Kyoto, but Ito would always ask when I was next coming to Tokyo, and then we would get together when I visited. TD The meeting at Hara 's villa was before you began your own office, in 1980 ... st Well, that was the year it was officially registered, but as I mentioned, I had been working on my own projects for a number of years before that. TD . . . but it wasn't long before you gained a huge amount of attention for the design of a kimono showroom in Kyoto, which y ou titled Origin (1981). st I designed Origin for Akihiko Izukura, who was the head of a company that had been making obi (kimono sashes) for more than 200 years. We met at the wedding of a friend from university, who was then working at a textile factory, which is how he knew Izukura. At a Japanese wedding reception everybody writes their names in a register before taking their seats. I wrote 'Takamatsu Shin' in traditional calligraphy and while I was doing so Izukura was standing behind me. When I sat down he happened to be seated next to me. We got talking about what we did for a living. 'I'm an architect', I said, 'though I only make doghouses and things like that'. We continued chatting during the meal and then he suddenly said, 'I want to build a head office for my company. Could you design it?' I was taken aback. 'Why me?' He simply said, 'Because I like your calligraphy.' I didn't take this too seriously, but a short time later we ran into each other again and he said, 'How's progress on my building?' I just replied, 'Huh? But I don't even know what you need.' He said, 'Just make whatever you want. You worry about the design. I'll worry about how to use it.' Well, when a client says you can do whatever you like you really shouldn't pass up the opportunity. But I hadn't been trained to work like that. I was used to working with specific constraints - site conditions, budget and planning restrictions - and so I found it hard to make any kind of progress at all. Then I suddenly remembered Izumo Taisha. A Shinto shrine is not something that really caters to human beings, because in a sense it has no function. It just is. It was my encounter with Izumo Taisha that first inspired me to become an architect. I then realised that it didn't really matter how or why or even if a client used my building, and that I should simply try and create what I believed to be the essence of architecture. The first sketches of Origin then began to emerge. TD There seem to be influences other than Izumo Taisha -I see echoes of Hans Hollein's Retti candle shop in the facade, while the dimly lit interior, lined with opulent materials and polished surfaces, is reminiscent of the idiosyncratic Kyoto architect Sei'ichi Shirai. But back then Shirai was practically unknown outside Japan and almost forgotten at home, I think. 104 aa files 75</page><page sequence="8">Origin i, Kyoto, 1981</page><page sequence="9">Yoshida House, Kyoto, 1982</page><page sequence="10">Ark, Kyoto, 1983</page><page sequence="11">Pharaoh, Kyoto, 1984</page><page sequence="12">Origin iii, Kyoto, 1986</page><page sequence="13">Kirin Plaza, Osaka, 1987</page><page sequence="14">Imanishi building, Tokyo, 1991</page><page sequence="15">st Origin was very strongly influenced by Shirai, but I wasn't conscious of the connection and homage until after I completed the design. I love all of Shirai's architecture, but for me the unbuilt Temple of Atomic Catastrophe (1954) is his masterpiece - it's a design that seems to have emerged from within him instantaneously, fully formed. I also wanted to make architecture with such a presence. Indeed, I am indelibly stained with Shirai's influence. The influence of Hollein is not the facade design, but the lack of visual clues as to the scale of the building. And the influence of Shirai is not in the interior spaces, but the symmetry of the composition. TD Symmetry is something that is assiduously avoided in traditional Japanese aesthetics. st And in contemporary Japanese aesthet- ics. But Shirai studied in Germany when he was young, and that clearly liberated him. TD Origin also comprises elements that recall the Viennese Secession architects - the large bolts that hold the stone panels in place, for example , are like something Otto Wagner might have done. Had you been to Vienna by that time and seen those buildings? st Yes. I had been a part-time design tutor at Osaka University of Arts, so I'd often led students on trips to Europe - to Austria, Germany and the United Kingdom, where I had my first real encounters with so-called modern architecture. Wagner, especially, had a lot to offer, but Stirling's buildings were also impres- sive. There was so much to see at that time. TD The client for Origin was clearly happy with this putatively function-less building, as he commissioned two extensions, Origin 11 (1982) and iii (1986). But in the meantime, you did two extraordinary machine-like buildings for dentists, Ark (1983) and Pharaoh (1984). It seems that dentists in Japan are patrons of the avant-garde, for some reason. Did you have some kind of connection with the dental profession? st No, it was merely happenstance. Dentists are wealthy, and I think they also like to show off. Ark arose via an introduction from a salesman I knew. The sales staff of Japanese department stores are always visiting wealthy clients, and on one particular visit this dentist had mentioned in passing that he was looking for an architect capable of producing 'the coolest possible building for my clinic'. The salesman recommended me. He was a great client, but it took many proposals to reach the final form. He rejected the first ten. I took him proposal after proposal, and he would say, 'This is not what I asked for ... do something more amazing.' Then I took him the eleventh sketch and told him that I could go no further. TD Why didyou shift to the imagery of machines? st As I mentioned earlier, when I was a child I liked to build machines, and as I grew in confidence as an architect I rediscovered this impulse to make mechanical objects. The machine was especially appealing because it was simultaneously a sign - that is, a visual message - and a metaphor, expressing func- tional efficiency and the invisible, dynamic forces at work within it. My ambition, then, was to make machines that provoke and transform their context. TD Le Corbusier was very clear about the types of machines that inspired his own architectural forms - automobiles from the 1920s, as well as ocean liners and assorted airplanes. Your machinie imagery, in contrast, seems to echo an earlier era - Victorian locomotives andfactories. Ark even looks like a steam engine, an allusion that is strengthened by its location next to a local train station. st The influence is more from the environ- ment in which I grew up. Near my home, in addition to all the boat repair places, there was a maintenance workshop for the Japanese National Railways. That is where I learned to handle all the welding, lathing and milling machines. There were also blacksmiths nearby, producing farming and fishing implements by hand - horseshoes, harpoons, anchors, and so on. They even made swords! TD In addition to the more brutal, industrial machine imagery, you use polished stone and chrome in ways that have a strong affinity with the work of Hans Hollein. st Soon after completing Ark I made a second trip to Vienna, partly to meet Hollein himself. We spent several hours in his office, speaking through an interpreter. Neither of us had much facility with English, and the interpreter was not a specialist in architecture, so our thoughts were not well conveyed. We communicated more easily through the many sketches we made during our meeting - dozens and dozens of sketches. At the end, we gave them to each other. I have since given most of them away, and now have only two or three left. TD Around this time, y ou founded an architectural theory journal called Kyoku (Pole) in which you discussed some of y our aesthetic theories. To me at least, it also seems Basara- related, both in tone and because of some of the people who were involved. st I cofounded Kyoku with Toyokazu Watanabe and Akiyoshi Hirayama. It wasn't directly related to Basara, but somehow inspired by them. Basara were then quite active in Tokyo, so I felt that the Kansai region needed its own platform and its own voice. We had many editorial meetings, but in the end we only produced four issues. TD What was the goal? st To promote the avant-garde. But also to publish powerful writing. It's hard to find architects capable of that. Architects barely write at all these days, and if they do it's only project descriptions. At that time I felt that the power of words was even more important than that of architecture. Architects, I thought, had to be able to debate each other and convince their audiences through their texts. Even though it only lasted a few issues, most of the architects who made a name for themselves at that time wrote for Kyoku. TD I notice that in addition to the Japanese writers, such as Hiroyuki Suzuki, Makoto Uyeda and Kiyoshi Sey Takeyama, Kyoku included the British critic Chris Fawcett, an important English-language writer on Japanese architecture in the 1970s. st Ah, Chris Fawcett. He died so young, from chorea - a nasty neurological disease which first shows itself through involuntary body movements. It's congenital, so Fawcett knew he would probably get it, because his father had it. I liked his writing and was keen for him to appear in the magazine. My fellow editor Akiyoshi Hirayama did all of the translation himself. TD That's a tough job. I can barely understand Fawcett in English. But I think Hirayama also translated your essays into English, which would have been equally tough. He must be good. I see you also wrote critical essays in Kyoku about various other architects, including Rem Koolhaas, Daniel Libeskind . . . st ... and Kazuo Shinohara - mainly about the House under High-Voltage Lines, which I mentioned earlier. TD What about the other great architect from the Kansai region, TadaoAndo - like you, a master of light and shadow with a palette of concrete, glass and steel, though in many ways stylistically your opposite. Didyou consider Ando a rival oran ally? st To be honest, I hardly know him. I first encountered him in a discussion about architec- tural education organised by the Architectural Institute of Japan, which also included Osamu Ishiyama and Kijo Rokkaku. That was the first time we ever spoke. Of course, we sometimes encounter each other at symposiums and exhibitions, but we just greet each other in passing: 'Hey there, making a living?' I do like his architecture. There are some works that I dislike, but generally I respect him as an architect. TD Through your drawings, writing and, of course, your buildings, by the mid-1980s you had become very well known, both inside and outside Japan. In 1984 you received the jia Newcomer Architecture Prize, and then in 1985 the grand prize at the Venice Architecture Biennale. But your widespread fame was, I think, above all due to your drawings - those huge graphite renderings saturated with precise shades and textures. Architects in Europe were stunned by the time and effort and obsessiveness they clearly entailed. When did you start doing this particular style of drawing? st It began with Origin. At that time my graphite drawings weren't so large, just sketches as part of the design process. But as I gradually refined my approach the drawings got bigger 112 aa files 75</page><page sequence="16">House with a Cross, 1985</page><page sequence="17">House with a Cross, 1985</page><page sequence="18">and bigger, because this allowed me to more accurately address the smaller details. Back then one large drawing took about three weeks to complete, working every day. I did all of those first drawings myself, but as the workload increased I taught my staff the techniques so that they could assist me. TD For almost all your projects in the 1980s you made large graphite drawings of the plans, sections and elevations, but obviously they weren't construction drawings. What were they for? Client presentations or publications? st Neither. I just kept them for myself. They were simply developed as a way for me to check every part of the architectural composi- tion. With a single pencil you can express every material. TD You say a single pencil but you use various grades for shading, no? st The pencils ranged from 6h to 2B. td Why are the drawings so shadowy, even gloomy? st I still don't quite understand that myself. Perhaps it was because I thought that architec- ture, before it is experienced and understood, must instantly convey its physical presence and power. So I added shadows throughout the floor plans and sections to intensify this presence. td There 's a famous essay by the novelist Junichiro Tanizaki, Tn Praise of Shadows', in which he asserts that dimly lit spaces are central to Japanese aesthetics. st I like Tanizaki. My father introduced me to his work. Our house was full of books, and from a relatively early age I was reading not only Tanizaki but writers like Osamu Dazai, Yukio Mishima, Toson Shimazaki and Ogai Mori. I read many novels from the dark times of mid-twentieth-century Japan, and I was greatly influenced by that style of writing. td The presence and power of your architec- ture was recognised in 1988 when the Architectural Association reproduced a limited-edition folio of your drawings. This was titled The Killing Moon and Other Projects, and was based around a ceremonial sword you'd created called the Killing Moon. Is this name an allusion to Filippo Marinetti's ' Manifesto of Futurism', in which he writes about wanting to ' murder the moonlight'? st There's no connection. I borrowed the title from a pop song by the English band Echo and the Bunnymen. The folio was commis- sioned by Alvin Boyarsky, who came to see my work in Japan. He liked it very much and invited me to give a lecture in London. I spoke in Japanese and a translator then communicated my words in English to the audience. I remem- ber Zaha Hadid, Peter Cook, Peter Wilson and other eminent people sitting in the front row. The folio itself was published to coincide with an exhibition of my drawings at the aa. td Was the sword designed for that exhibition? st No, Killing Moon was an earlier commis- sion from a Japanese magazine called Brutus. The editors had the idea to gather some leading contemporary artists and hold an exhibition. The contributors included a sculptor, a painter and a graphic designer. I was the architect. We were each invited to design whatever we wanted. I'd wanted to make a sword ever since I was a child and so that's what I proposed to do. I drew sketches which were scanned into a computer, and then I refined the shape using computer software, which was more or less unheard of at the time. td But even if it was designed digitally, was it forged using traditional techniques, by a Japanese swordsmith? st No. It was manufactured by a company that made precision instruments for the assembly of automobile bodies. I just handed them the drawings and said, 'make this'. It's a combination of aluminium and brass. td As your drawings and buildings became better known in Europe there was increasing interest in the ideas behind them. The French philosopher Félix Guattari, for example, has written extensively about you. How did y ou first meet? st Guattari came to Japan, and said he wanted to meet me. We had a long conversation, then he went home to France and wrote about it. The interpreter was excellent, so it went well. I think we understood each other. But I didn't really understand his original texts. td The international interest in your work, and that of many other avant-garde architects in Japan, was partly due to the economic bubble in the latter half of the 1980s, which allowed you to indulge in some extremely ornate and spectacular designs, such as Kirin Plaza Osaka (1987). st Kirin Plaza Osaka was commissioned slightly before the bubble, but yes, there was a lot of work. By that time I had a staff of more than 50 people. td By the time the bubble burst, and Japan entered the so-called ' lost decade' of the 1990s recession, your work was getting much bigger, but also undergoing some major stylistic changes - there was a gradual shift from darkness to light, from enclosure to openness. st I was always aware that the bubble would not last forever. During the boom years I was working almost exclusively for private compa- nies and individuals, but I knew that this would not be viable in the long term. So when the economy looked like it was on the verge of collapse I became more involved with public architecture. I began a series of projects in Shimane prefecture, the first of which was the Nima Sand Museum (1990), in my hometown. In total I produced 11 public buildings, all in quick succession - after the Sand Museum there was Kunibiki Messe (1993), then Sakaiminato Symphony Garden (1994), then Shoji Ueda Museum (1995), the most challenging of them all. It's located within sight of a very beautiful mountain called Daisen, with absolutely no other contemporary architecture nearby, so I had to make an art museum that confronted the mountain. The contextual conditions for each of these buildings were always completely different, but I usually had to find a way to build contemporary architecture in an empty place. Nothing but mountains, nothing but rice fields, nothing but greenery, nothing but sea. In contrast, earlier projects such as Origin, Ark and Pharaoh were confronting the city with expressions of power. But repeating such an overtly confrontational model in those natural settings would have been pointless. And so instead I became interested in blurring the division between a building and its surround- ings. For public buildings, especially, I felt I had to examine their contextual relationship very carefully. Of course, you have to deal with the facade, the structure, the space, but you also have to approach the transition between exterior and interior in new ways. So my new theme was to build architecture in a relationship or conversation with the environment and scenery. But rather than my work gradually shifting as you suggested, I think it was an abrupt change. td The early buildings were also densely composed, formally complete monuments, whereas the new work was far more transparent and brightly lit, more episodic and asymmetrical. st Symmetry became unhelpful, because for these large buildings in natural settings you never saw the architecture all at once but always in parts, together with its surroundings. The early buildings were also very small, and so their design could be appreciated instantly. I wanted people to feel their power at first glance. But when I started working at a much larger scale I had to allow for the time it takes to experience the forms and spaces, to experiment with what might be achieved during the process of perceiving them. It also has to do with the programmes. Most of the early buildings were tenant buildings, which simply require neutral, open spaces and an impressive exterior form. There is a huge difference in the design process for public buildings, because the programmes are so much more complex and diverse. While designing Kunibiki Messe, for example, I was focusing on this very intensely. The building required a precise hierarchical system. One way to design is to make a diagram showing the different programmatic elements connected by line segments, and then to translate this into an arrangement of spaces. I struggled for a long time with this approach, but didn't like the results, so I shifted my attention from the programmatic elements to the line segments. These tend to be all but ignored, resolved into corridors and hallways with no architectural power. But I wanted to create a new type of line between elements, a new method of division AA FILES 75 115</page><page sequence="19">Tianjin Museum, 2004 All images courtesy Shin Takamatsu</page><page sequence="20">and connection that would produce a building in flux, in a fluid equilibrium. So rather than connecting the elements with lines, I allowed the elements to be swallowed up by the lines. As a result, in Kunibiki Messe there is a gom-long processional space at ground level, and a 24m-high glazed section containing a number of floating volumes, each with a different function - 1 called this the Garden of Abstract Forms. From the original planning diagram, one-dimen- sional line segments became those enormous spaces. The volumes themselves are held in a delicate balance. If you imagine a bowl of water with several apples floating in it, over time the apples will find a stable equilibrium in relation to each other. Or if you look at Japanese calligraphy, the location of each stroke is not fixed in advance, but placed so as to create an equilib- rium with the preceding strokes. Japanese space is always balanced on the edge of change. For example, in the famous Zen garden of Ryõan-ji temple, if just one stone were to be moved or added, the space would be significantly altered. A composition may be flexible, but it can be radically altered by changing a single element. TD Could it be said that during the 1990s you were trying to give your architecture a resonance with Japanese tradition? st It was more that I was trying to set architecture free. Architecture is constrained by so many things: function, budget, building codes, social conventions, common sense. But above all, it's constrained by gravity. To actually free architecture from gravity itself is, of course, totally impossible, so I try to achieve this freedom metaphorically by playing with gravity. My architecture expresses the hope of one day escaping from gravity. TD This is clear even in your earliest designs , where you would use recessed podiums and top-heavy compositions to make those concrete masses seem to levitate slightly above the ground. To me it also seems clear that you have always been striving to create an inimitable, personal language of architecture. All your exuberant elaboration of form and detail may or may not relate to traditional Japanese architecture, but I think it can be interpreted as a response to the visual language of technological innovation and production - automobiles, home electronics, robots, and so on - that has become emblematic of postwar Japan. But it does seem as if the machine metaphor started to recede in the larger projects. st I thought that I could partially retain the metaphorical image of a machine, but in my architecture from the 1990s onward, particularly the public buildings, my basic theme was a 'farewell to the machine', so to speak. TD Your drawings also began to change. I think colour and transparency first appear in a series of abstract drawings you did under the title 'House with a Cross' (1985). What was the purpose of those drawings? st They're experiments in the ways that form and space might interact. Perhaps I could dare to call it the 'paradox of the icon'. I started developing that series only because Toshi Jütaku asked me to provide some drawings for the cover of the magazine. They're all watercolours. TD But when and why did you shift to coloured pencil drawings? Is this directly connected to the shift to public buildings? st Yes, I began using coloured pencils when I started dealing with public buildings, particularly the public buildings concentrated around my hometown. My previous architecture had been conceived in black graphite and based on themes of 'disjunction', 'assemblage, 'metaphor', and so on. When I moved into a completely unfamiliar situation - that is, working on public architecture based on themes of 'environment', 'scenery', 'coexistence' - I became strongly aware that black graphite had limitations as a tool to break new ground, so I quite naturally shifted to using coloured pencilsē In particular, I think a purple coloured pencil is the tool best equipped to touch the 'cosmos'. TD Your purple pencil is increasingly in evidence since the turn of the millennium in y our large projects in Russia and China, notably the Tianjin Museum (2004). You also have a very active branch office in Taiwan. What do you want to do next? st First, I want to finish up all the work at hand. Frankly speaking, I think that I have not yet surpassed my debut work, Origin. Without trying to use the same method, I want to make architecture that surpasses that. I've never admitted that to anyone before. TD When you say surpass, do you mean in scale? st Not scale. It could even be smaller than Origin. I want to make architecture that affects people more directly. TD Do you also want to surpass your peers, or are they no longer relevant to you? I mean, do you retain any sense of rivalry or affinity with other architects? st Toyo Ito is probably the architect I am closest to. We still meet and socialise. TD But the two of you seem totally different: you are heavy, he is light. Perhaps that's why you're close personally, because there is no professional rivalry? st Maybe. I always say to him that I could never make his kind of architecture, and he says the same thing to me. TD But ironically as your work has become lighter, his has become heavier. st You're right, but I think that's not so good. I feel that Ito hasn't done any strong projects recently. I was really disappointed by his Taichung Metropolitan Opera House (2016). Translated from the Japanese by Thomas Danieli I've seen all of his recent buildings in Taiwan, including the opera house, and I think none of them are any good. His early works are by far the best. TD The lightness I see in your recent work is partly related to your increasing interest in wooden structures, which began with the Seirei Worship Hall (1998). It appears to be a return to Japanese tradition, at least in terms of material and structure. st It isn't. Japanese traditional wooden techniques are astonishing, and I could never create wooden architecture that surpasses that - 1 may have aspired to do so when I was younger, but I soon realised this was impossi- ble. But I still think you could make amazing modern architecture using those techniques. These days I am constantly thinking about wooden architecture. I want to try building in wood, but not to invent a completely new type of wooden architecture. I want to make new architecture that uses the traditional techniques of Japan. The origins of wooden architecture are in China, but the Japanese took it to another level. It is a source of pride for us. Twelve or so years ago I opened a branch office in Taiwan. There are very few Japanese architects who have done that, as far as I know. Not even Ito has a Taiwan office. Around three years ago I was able to register the office there, which I guess means that the Taiwanese now trust me. At first I was just doing apartment buildings, but I have since begun to receive commissions with interesting architectural themes, so in a sense, producing architecture in Taiwan is my aim and my field for the future. If I ever manage to create a work that surpasses Origin, as I said before, it probably won't be in Japan. TD Something we haven't discussed is your influence as a teacher. From 1997 until 2013 you were a professor at Kyoto University. Had you always wanted to return to your alma mater? st Well, the design chair became vacant. First Kawasaki retired, then Shozo Uchii taught there for two or three years, then when he retired I received a formal letter from the university that told me in no uncertain terms, 'Takamatsu must return home and do his duty.' TD Did y ou find that y our students, orany of y our office staff for that matter, have inherited your style? st I think that's probably impossible. I taught for 16 years, so my earliest graduates are now in their 40s and a couple of them, for example Tomohiro Hata, seem likely to become interesting architects. Something like 700 people have passed through my office over the nearly four decades I have been in practice. Many are now running their own offices, but very few are playing an active role in the architecture world. Katsu Umebayashi, perhaps. Rather than continuing my style, I think the challenge for them is to escape it and reveal their own identity. aa files 75 117</page></plain_text>
