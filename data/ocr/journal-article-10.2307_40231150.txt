Pp. xvi and 369. This book fills a long-standing need. Marxism as a political "ideology" (in the loose sense of that word) has become a political for- ce world-wide; thousands of cadres are initiated daily into what purport to be its central doctrines. And yet one of the most central, the thesis of historical materialism, remains unclear. It is difficult to know exactly what one is meant to be asserting in affirming it. It is too much to expect that one might find out by attending a Party school. But it is not unreasonable to ask philosophers to clarify the doctrine. And yet remarkably little has been done in this direction. This is not to say that various attempts have not been made. Lukacs offered one such. Althusser offered another; just to name two examples. But these attempts were very unsatisfactory, especially to philosophers in the Anglo-American cultural orbit. For they either took for granted some of the conceptual apparatus which was seen as most problematic (Lukacs' adoption of Hegelian categories, for instance); or they frankly fudged all the interesting issues (Althusser), or they bore no convincing relation to Marx (Althusser again). What the author of this work has done is to offer an interpretation of historical materialism, that is, Marx's doctrine, in terms which are com- prehensible within contemporary Anglo-American philosophy. In doing this he has rendered a great service, not only to readers whose 327</page><page sequence="2">Charles Taylor philosophical culture is Anglo-American, but also to Marxism. For this clarification should enable us to lay to rest some of the grosser con- fusions that have been current among Marxists and their opponents, as well as to pose more clearly the basic questions and challenges that Marxism must meet. Party schools from Habana to Mukden will no doubt run on unaffected, but a blow is nevertheless struck for civilization if somewhere in the universe an issue can be got clear. I can't hope to summarize this very rich book. But it has a clearly cir- cumscribed aim. Cohen sets himself the task of clarifying Marx's doc- trine. The book opens with the quotation in extenso of the famous statement from the Preface of 1859: "In the social production of their life, men enter into definite reelations that are indispensable and in- dependent of their will ". An interpretation of historical materialism ought to be able to make sense of this passage - and, of course, more as well; but this passage can be considered a kind of paradigm statement. At the heart of Cohen's interpretation lies his identification of two connected doctrines of primacy, and his interpretation of these in terms of the notion of functional explanation. The primacy theses are, respec- tively, that of the forces of production over the relations of production; and that of the relations of production (or "base"), over the legal and political systems (or "superstructure"). The claim made in the first thesis is that the relations of production will tend to assume the form which will favour the maximum development of the forces of production. That made by the second is that political and legal structures will tend to arise which entrench those relations of production which the first thesis shows to be favoured. In other terms, we could say that at any moment in history the level of technology and skill, the availability of resources, the nature of the climate, and so on, permit a certain development of human productive powers. But in order to realize this potential to the maximum, men have to be organized in certain relations of production. If the technology and resources of a given age will permit maximum productivity only if men concentrate together in large-scale factory production, then the first primacy thesis predicts that society will tend to develop relations of production which allow for factories. These relations will then become what we could call the favoured relations of production. But they will require certain legal and political forms underpinning them, if they are to develop and maintain them- selves. For instance, if the only relations of production permitting large- scale manufacture in a given society are capitalist ones, where the fac- tories are owned by individuals or corporations who hire labour on a free market, then there will have to be a legal system allowing for private property, for free contract, and so on; and a political system 328</page><page sequence="3">Critical Notice of Cohen Karl Marx's Theory of History: A Defense which is dedicated to the defense of property, of free movement of money and personnel, and so on. The second primacy thesis asserts that these complementary political and legal structures will tend to develop. Now Cohen asserts that these theses are to be understood as claims that a functional mode of explanation applies here. A functional ex- planation in Cohen's usage, is one in which the condition for the ex- planandum event's occurring is that it would tend to produce some result, e.g., promote some goal, or maximize some feature. Such ex- planations resemble ordinary nonfunctional ones in that explanans and explanandum can be understood as antecedent and consequent in an explanatory relation which may even assume the form of a law, but in any case ought to licence counter-factuals and subjunctive conditionals. But what is peculiar to functional explanations is the nature of the an- tecedent, which is purely dispositional. A functional explanation has the form: B came about, because B was such that it tended to lead to G (capitalist relations came about, because they made possible factory production; the legal regime of private ownership came about, because it entrenched capitalist relations). Now the antecedent (B was such that it tended to produce G) can be called 'dispositional', because its characterization contains an uncomplemen- ted hypothetical. What we are saying in effect is that a situation, such that 'if B, then G' was true of it, was sufficient to produce B. It was not necessary that either 'B' or 'G' have held of it as categorical descriptions for it to produce the explanandum. If we call a hypothetical invoked in explanation, unaccompanied by either of its component propositions asserted categorically, an uncomplemented hypothetical, then this is the crucial feature of the antecedent in functional explanations. Now understanding the Marxist primacy theses as claims about fun- ctional explanation clears up a great many puzzles. In particular, it allows us to give a clear meaning to the notion of primacy itself. If we want to stick with a conception which allows only non-functional ex- planation - and there is a strong temptation to do so for metaphysical reasons, to which Marxists have been far from immune - then we run into great difficulty. What does it mean to assert that the "base" deter- mines the "superstructure". If it just means that we can explain certain features of the political and legal systems by the relations of production, this is hardly going to be satisfactory, because plainly the reverse is also true: the political and legal systems also influence the relations. Indeed, it is part of the insight on which the theory is based that they must do so. We think of capitalist legal forms as arising because they entrench capitalist relations of production. If we think just in terms of ordinary causal explanation, then we seem forced to admit a reciprocal influence of base and superstructure, as Engels did in his famous letter to Bloch. The primacy thesis then 329</page><page sequence="4">Charles Taylor becomes something extremely vague and cloudy, that economic struc- tures are "in the last instance" decisive, to use Engels' much-quoted phrase. But this is surely more a place-holder for an eventual account than any kind of clarification. A decade and more of writing by Althusser and his disciples has served only to show how much obscurity and confusion this short formula covers. But if we allow for functional explanation, the point of the primacy thesis stands out clearly. Of course, superstructure affects base. Its effec- ts can be given a ordinary causal explanation. But the determination of superstructure by base is of another kind; it is to be explained functionally. These two directions of influence are so far from being rivals that they are actually complementary. The fun- ctional explanation requires that the secondary factor tend to have a causal effect on the primary, for this dispositional fact is the key feature of the explanation. It is because the regime of private property tends to entrench capitalist relations that it develops and flourishes. The primacy of base over superstructure consists in the fact that ex- planation in the two directions is not symmetrical. In one direction it is functional, and this defines the primacy of the factor in terms of which functionality is defined. To put it simply, we could say that legal and political systems develop in order to foster the favoured relations of production. The solution is so simple, that one feels like asking why there has been such relactance among Marxists to adopt it. The reason is to be found in the general reluctance in the scientific culture of the West to accept functional or teleological explanations. There is felt to be something mysterious about them, something anthropomorphic and pre-modern. One of the central claims of Marxism was to stand four- square in this scientfic tradition, indeed, to represent an extension of it to human society and history. The oft-quoted declamation by Engels comparing Marx to Darwin reflects this aspiration. It has seemed to many Marxists that the theory's claim to be a materialism would be somehow in jeopardy if one gave it a functional interpretation. Ordinary causal explanation somehow seemed "har- der" and more "scientific". But the results for the coherence of the theory were disastrous. The "humanist" tradition of Marxism, which has been focussed on the early as well as the late Marx, and which has been less impressed by Victorian scientism, is greatly strengthened by Cohen's interpretation. Not that he can show finally on which side Marx himself "really" stood - it seems most plausible to conclude that Marx somehow tried to straddle the gap between what are now seen as rival interpretations, humanist and scientistic. But his way of making sense of historical materialism shows that the only direction in which it can be coherently 330</page><page sequence="5">Critical Notice of Cohen Karl Marx's Theory of History: A Defense developed lies much closer to the country of the humanists than to the gloomy realm of their scientistic rivals. But many questions still remain. One reproach, frequently made by hardline Marxists, is that a functional interpretation of this kind seems to take all the conflict out of history. What becomes of the class struggle, if political systems tend to take the form required by the favoured relations of production? The answer is that the functional interpretation says nothing by itself about the smoothness or the conflict-ridden nature of history. It is per- fectly compatible with the class theory of society which Marx in fact espoused, to the effect that relations of production (prior to communist society) are relations of subordination, and hence involve the develop- ment in each case of a dominant class. These classes acquire a vested in- terest in the relations which make them dominant, and will fight to maintain them, even when they no longer conduce to the maximum development of the productive forces. History thus moves forward by a series of bitter clashes, and not in a smooth curve. All the functional thesis maintains is that it does tend to move forward. Other things being equal, retrograde classes, holding on to relations, of production which have become fetters on the forces, become less and less capable of resisting. Outside of special circumstances, they are doomed to be swept aside. It is hard not to concur that this was Marx's view. Another criticism, which has been made from outside Marxism, calls into question the primacy thesis on logical grounds. Can one properly separate relations of production from, say, legal forms? If relations of production are relations of domination, whereby some command others in the productive process, then how can these be properly distinguished from legally-defined relations? What makes the capitalist dominant over the workers is surely just that he owns the factory, and they can only use his capital as his employees. But ownership is a legal status, and the relationships based on them are legal relationships. Cohen argues that such relations of identity, between say, the relation of domination between A and B (capitalist and worker) and the legal relation between A and B, is no bar to our discovering functional relations between them. In making base primary over superstructure, we are saying that what mattered, what defined the crucial function here, was that A be able to command B's labour and extract surplus value. It was this aspect of the relation which had to be entrenched, and which would have been entrenched in other ways, had those legal for- ms for some reason not been available. (As indeed, some Marxists claim is the case in some peripheral societies in the capitalist world.) But what about the charge that functional explanation is somehow unscientific, now not directed by one school of Marxists at another, but coming from outside as a challenge to Marxism itself? Cohen's answer to 331</page><page sequence="6">Charles Taylor this charge is that it is unreasonable. There is no reason why the world might not be so made that certain ranges of phenomena are amenable to functional explanation. That is, it may be that laws of functional kind enable us to account for phenomena, to generate valid subjective con- ditionals, and so on. Indeed, Cohen claims to see in Darwinian theory - that paradigm of hard science (not least for Engels) - such a fun- ctional account. On one level, Darwinian theory predicts that those features will be entrenched in an organism which tend to contribute to its survival. Why does the giraffe have a long neck? Because (in the layman's example) it is what he needs to feed in an environment of tall trees. But citing Darwin just displaces the issue of functional explanation. The hard-nosed anti-functionalist will agree that Darwin is acceptable only because he knows that there is a more complete explanation, filling in the steps which the functional account merely summarizes. What brings about the "functional" result is random variation and natural selection. On this level of explanation there are no functional laws, that is no laws which involve antecedents with uncomplemented hypotheticals. The giraffe gets the long neck as a result of antecedent conditions which are all now described in categorical terms: there was random variation which produced inter alia specimens with longer necks. These could feed better than the others, and so they survived in greater numbers. Thus the Darwinian example is still hospitable to those who would want to claim that wherever there is a valid functional account, there is a more complete explanation which is not functional. Cohen himself seems to share this view (which is where we part company). But whether one does or not, the question arises of what sort of completion, or filling in of steps, the functional explanations of historical materialism admit of. This is not an easy question to answer. There may seem an obvious candidate in the case of any functional explanation involving human beings. If human behaviour seems to fit a functional law, can we not ex- plain this in terms of the conscious purposes of the agents? B happens when B conduces to G, because human agents are aware of B's con- sequences and desire them. But unfortunately, this can't suffice in the case of historical materialism, because many human agents have clearly been quite unaware, in fighting for one or other political or legal system, of the alleged determining importance of its functionality for certain favoured relations of production. Indeed, this is so obtrusively the case, that Marxism is well-known for offering explanations which go beyond what the agents could ever have avowed to themselves. A crucial role is played in all Marxist explanatory schemes by the notion of false or 332</page><page sequence="7">Critical Notice of Cohen Karl Marx's Theory of History: A Defense ideological consciousness. Something plays a role in Marx's theory of history analogous to the "cunning of reason" in Hegel's. So the problem of finding some back-up explanation for the fun- ctional account of historical development remains. Perhaps there is some account structurally analogous to the Darwinian one which can be offered, though this seems to me very unlikely. It would seem rather, that some very knotty and fundamental issues about the nature of human agency, and about human social action, will have to be an- swered in order to make progress in this area. But since this is a complex of issues which is of the highest importance for any social theory, it is hardly a reproach to Marxism that it leads us right into it. More unsettling perhaps is this: a functional interpretation of historical materialism shows it to be making an implicit claim about the direction of history. To say, for instance, that the relations of production will take the form required to favour the maximum development of the productive forces, is to identify this latter as (partly) defining a direction to history. And if our more complete explanation of the functional ac- count refers to some basic motivational facts about human beings, their goals and aspirations, then we shall be making claims about these as well. History will be seen as having a direction, and possibly one which consists in the realization of certain basic human aspirations, even though these will be mis- or wrongly identified in its earlier stages. Now Marxists have usually fought shy of making claims about human nature, or the direction of human development. Indeed, it is of- ten fashionable to say that Marxism shows the whole notion of a trans- historical human nature to be a chimera, that men change with history, and so on. But it may easily turn out that this is another confusion, com- parable to the exclusive recognition of ordinary causal explanation, in which they are led by metaphysical prejudice to adopt a stance incom- patible with the main thrust of their own theory. In fact, it is difficult to resist the impression that Marxists are speaking out of both sides of their mouth, when they vigorously deny that they are committed to any theory of human nature, while at the same time affirming far-reaching claims about the basic causal factors of history and its direction. How can a thesis like that of historical materialism avoid having implications for our conception of man and human motivation? All these issues are brought to the fore by Cohen's interpretation; as are the further and more important issues about the definition of the direction of history: can it be defined simply in terms of the increase in productive forces, measured quantitatively? Or must it be defined in terms of the realization of certain potentials, for freedom, e.g., or creativity? 333</page><page sequence="8">Charles Taylor It is not clear how, or even whether, all these questions can be an- swered. But it is no criticism of an interpretation of Marx to have brought us to face them. On the contrary, Cohen has opened the road to a potentially very fruitful debate in this clear and penetrating account of Karl Marx's theory of history, which is rich in interesting detail which I have not been able to begin to do justice to in this short review.
