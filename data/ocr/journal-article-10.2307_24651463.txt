<plain_text><page sequence="1">SAMDHYÄ: MYTH AND RITUAL1 by DORIS SRINIVASAN Columbia University, N.Y. I. Introduction At present, among the Hindu orthodoxy, there is one ceremony which is to be performed each day twice, if not thrice. This is the Samdhyä ceremony which takes its name from an essential feature of the rite, namely the time of day it is to be performed. Samdhyä (lit. 'juncture') is observed at the juncture of the three divisions of the day : morning, noon, and evening. The twice-born who today dedicates the time at dawn and dusk to Samdhyä worship, is doing much the same as his ancestors have done for approximately two and a half millennia.2 For the current Samdhyä ceremony affords a strong link with the most ancient strata of Indian religious traditions. These traditions are found in the literature associated with the different Vedic schools, the compilation of which occurred during the first millenium B.C. and in isolated instances extended into the first few centuries of the Christian era. Herein are found the earliest descriptions of Samdhyä. Samdhyä precedes all other ceremonies of the day, be they regular or special.3 Thus, Samdhyä serves, in the following manner, as an important 1 Research for this paper was supported by the American Institute of Indian Studies and the Columbia University Council for Research in the Humanities. The paper is complemented by an educational documentary film on Sarpdhyà. Whereas the paper is concerned with origins and the early extent of Sarpdhyà, the film is a commentary on the way modern Saipdhyä is performed. I wish to thank Professor Daniel H. Smith, Syracuse University, for his constant interest and valuable suggestions on the produc tion of the film. 2 Nowadays it is said mostly in the morning. Mention of the morning and evening Saipdhyä dates from the initial descriptions of the ceremony ($açlv.Br. 4.5; TA. 2.2; the Grhya Sutras, see Section III). References to the noon-time Sarpdhyà are later (e.g. A VPari. 41.1.5; VaikhG. 1.3). s Cf. T.

Äcamana1 (sipping of water for internal ablution) and pränäyäma (breath-control) begin the ceremony. These actions are con sidered to cleanse the body and promote mental stability, bestowing thereby an appropriate ritual attitude and condition upon the worshipper. With the sarftkalpa (declaration of purpose) the worshipper embarks upon the characteristic portions of Samdhyä. These are:6 märjana, twice (sprinkling water over oneself while reciting mantras), manträcamana (sippings accompanied by repetition of mantras), aghamar§ana (RV. 10.190 recited in a sin-effacing act), arghya (offering water in the direction of the sun. The water, held in joined cupped hands, is thrown upwards three times. Each water-offering is accompanied by recitation of om, the Mahävyährtis, the Gäyatri mantra [i? V. 3.62.10] and the Gâyatrî siras), japa of Gâyatrî mantra (repeated ten, twenty-eight, one hundred eight, or more, times) and upasthâna (standing to worship the sun with special hymns of prayer appropriate for the three Samdhyäs). All but the sarfikalpa and the aghamarçana6 were in practice before c. the 4th C. A.D.7 Later additions, often from the purânas and tantras, combined with these components to result in the ritual complexity of modern-day Samdhyä.8 Today it is believed that performance of Samdhyä influences spiritual advancement and promotes well-being.9 In part no doubt because of the 4 Äcamana" ... is to wipe out all traces of preceding acts, so that the worshipper is, 'as a new man', able to pass on to another stage of his (ritual) performances" (J. Gonda, Visnuism and Sivaism [London, 1970], p. 70). 6 Descriptions of the ceremony are found in P. V. Kane, History of Dharmafästra 11, Pt. 1 (Poona, 1941), pp. 312-21; M. Monier-Williams, "The Place Which the Rig veda Occupies in the Sandhyä, and Other Daily Religious Services of the Hindus", Verhandlungen des fünften Internationalen Orientalisten-Congresses (1882), 157-88; S.

In the modern period, its usual position is before the arghya. 7 I.e. prior to the Vaikhänasasmärtasutra; see W. Caland, Vaikhänasasmärtasütram in Bibliotheca Indica 251 (Calcutta, 1929), xv-xvi.

This paper attempts to determine why and how Samdhyä was celebrated in ancient days. Such inquiry has not been previously made even though the availability of adequate textual material makes it feasible. The information comes from Vedic texts and epic, puränic and smrti literature. The study is based on passages in 27 texts.12 Over half of these are memory, märjana bestows purity, aghamarfana wards off sins, diseases, pain and malignant planetary influences, arghya the worship of God incarnate confers boons, japa leads to union with God, süryopasthäna protects the body and grants victory, pranäma purifies the heart and wins for one the affection of others by an humble dedication to God of all his sacred actions and gäyatrl upäsanä secures for him respect and honor from all people" (Rajvaidya Jivaram Kalidas Shastri, Sandhya, Vaishvadeva [Religious Routine of the Aryans] [Gondal, 1946], p. 15). 10 For a discussion of this important Hindu mantra, especially as "object of esoterical speculation and 'mystic' explanation" see J. Gonda, "The Indian Mantra", Oriens XVI (1963), 284-94. 11 J. Goyandka, "Value of the Practices of Sandhyâ and Gäyatrl", Kalyana-Kalpataru VIII: 6 (June, 1941), 499. The same article cites texts declaring the harm befalling someone who neglects Saipdhyä. Loss of status, caste and rebirth as an animal could result (p. 494). Warnings of this sort appear in AVPari. 41.3.4; MDh. 2.103; BDh. 2.4.7.15; LHDh., p. 184, line 3. Specific rules for atonement for temporary neglect begin with the Sütras and continue in the Sästras (e.g. JG. 1.13; MDh. 2.220; BDh. 2.4.7.16). The most serious neglect is failing to perform the ritual at the proper time. 12 Abbreviations: A VPari. Atharva Veda Pariiistas BrahP. Brahmända Puräna JG. Jaiminiya Grhya Sütra KausG.

Other texts such as the Taittiriya Ärariyaka, §advirtisa Brähmana, Rämäyana, the Vâyu and Viçnu Puränas and several later smrtis relate a myth bearing upon the nature of Samdhyä and why it ought to be performed. The considerable amount of Vedic and post-Vedic documentation on Samdhyä falls essentially into two categories : those passages which delineate the extent of the rite and those which explain its intent. To inquire, then, as to the initial intent of the Samdhyä is certainly not a mute question, nor an original one. "The expounders of the Veda say, why does a Brahman worship Samdhyä, in the evening sitting, and in the morning standing? What is Samdhyä? What is the time of Samdhyä? What is the essence of Samdhyä?"13 Thus asks the author of the Sadvirfisa Brähmana. The answer, mythic in nature, is set forth here to gain a deeper understanding of the underlying religious tradition of a current Hindu ritual. Also it is to demonstrate the symbiotic relationship between myth and ritual which fostered the Samdhyä ceremony. For, the ancient Samdhyä ritual appears to have been an enactment of an episode described in a solar myth. This myth is so well defined that it may be designated as the Samdhyä myth. The Samdhyä myth prescribes that ritual acts must be performed to effect the defeat of the sun's enemies; only then can the sun rise and stay on course. II. Procedure In order to see whether the Samdhyä ritual, as described in the Sütras and Sästras, correlates with the Samdhyä myth, it is necessary to determine whether the characteristic features of both support each other. The characteristic ritual components are discussed in Section III, below. This section outlines the extent of the morning and evening Samdhyäs in the Sütras and Säst ras. Appropriate passages are found under samdhyâ in Vishva Bandhu, A Vedic Word-Concordance, Sect. IV, Pt. IV (Hoshia pur, 1961), 2528 ff. References are also found in P. V.

Those features appear ing with the greatest frequency are considered as the distinctive ritual components of the Vedic Samdhyä. Section IV analyzes the material pertaining to the Samdhyä myth and discusses the interlocking features of myth and ritual.14 Further, it is found that the Samdhyä myth shares certain assumptions regarding the cyclic movement of light with a myth in the Rig Veda. A comparison between these assumptions in both myths is made in the concluding part of Section IV. III. Ritual components of Vedic Sarfidhyä The majority of texts limit Samdhyä to a small set of conditions: The worshipper, belonging to one of the three Aryan classes (see AG. 3.7.3 ; MG. 1.2.3; BDh. 2.4.7.3; MDh. 2.78-80), who has purified himself (JG. 1.13), selects a spot North (MG. 1.2.2) or East (MG. 1.2.2; VäG. 5.30) outside of the village (ApDh. 1.11.30.8; GDh. 2.10; MDh. 2.79), by a river's edge (JG. 1.13) or in a forest15 (SG. 2.9.1 ; KausG. 2.6.3). Upon the appropriate spot, covered with darbha grass (JG. 1.13; BDh. 2.4.7.5), the worshipper stands facing East for the morning service and sits facing West (or North-West) at dusk (ÉG. 2.9.1 ; 2.9.3; AG. 3.7.4; 3.7.6; Kaus.G. 2.6.3-4; VäG. 5.30; MG. 1.2.5; KG. 1.26-27; VaikhG. 1.3; JG. 1.13; VâDh. 7.16; BDh. 2.4.7.5,10; Yäj. 1.24-25). To be ritually valid, these preparatory actions must take place at a specific time of day. Morning Samdhyä ought to start very early and continue until the sun has appeared (§G. 2.9.3; AG. 3.7.6; Kaus.G. 2.6.4; BDh. 2.4.7.12; MDh. 2.101; Yäj. 1.25). That is, the emphasis is on spanning the period between the sun's absence and presence with Samdhyä. Gautama Dharmasästra (2.11) says it well: "Silent he shall stand during the former [i.e. morning Samdhyä], and sit during the latter [i.e. evening Samdhyä], from (the time when one) light (is still visible) until (the other) light appears".16 In the evening the duration would be from the time before sunset until the stars appear; in the morning, it is from starlight until sunlight appears. In ancient days, the ceremony was far less complex than it is today. 14 Additional references are found under Mandehas in V. R. Ramachandra Dikshitar, The Purana Index II (Madras, 1952), p. 632. 16 Aranye 'in a lonely spot', Kane, H. of Dh. II, Pt. 1, p. 313. " G.

Stenzler, The Institutes of Gautama (London, 1876).</page><page sequence="6">166 DORIS SRINIVASAN Prior to c. 300 A.D., the ceremony attained no more than five com ponents, and when it did it was the exception rather than the rule.17 Subsequently, the Vaikhânasa Grhya Sütra (1.3) describes at least ten different actions that the worshipper must perform.18 But, in over half of the texts reviewed, Samdhyä consists of one to three components (e.g., AG. 2.7.4; §G. 2.9.2; Kaus.G. 2.6.3; KG. 1.28; VäG. 5.30; MDh. 2.78; 2.101 ; 2.222; MG. 1.2.2-4; Yäj. 1.24-25). In these descriptions, the arghya and the japa are two distinctive components. This information must be deduced since the texts prefer to describe, rather than label these two components. By analyzing the descriptions, the component can usually be identified. In the case of the japa and arghya, both include recitation of the Gâyatri;19 injunction to recite Gâyatrî is the most frequent direction given in these descriptions. To determine to which of these two com ponents such an injunction applies, depends mainly on two criteria: the Sanskrit terminology and the ritual specifications associated with the injunction.20 For example, in texts belonging to the Rig Veda Satphitä (AG. 3.7.4; $G. 2.9.2; Kau?.G. 2.6.3) Samdhyä worship is congruent with performance of Gâyatrî japa. Use of the verb y/jap and absence of the arghya type of terminology (see fn. 20) warrants this conclusion.21 The Jaiminïya Grhya Sütra (1.13), belonging to the Säma Veda Samhitâ, also mentions the GâyatrI japa. No mention is made of the arghya,22 Samdhyä in the Yäjnavalkyasmrti (1.24) of the White Yajur Veda in cludes pränäyäma, märjana and the japa. " Such extended descriptions occur in the JG. 1.13 and BDh. 2.4.7 which assign the following components to the rite: âcamana, prânâyâma, màrjana, Gâyatrî japa, upasthäna. For an attempt at dating these texts see Ram Gopal, India of the Vedic Kalpasütras (Delhi, 1959), p. 84. Cf. Kane, H. of Dh. I (rev. ed., 1968), 12fF. 18 Âcamana, prânâyâma, mârjana, manträcamana, arghya, Gâyatrî japa, upasthäna, praise of morning and evening Sarpdhyâ, disâ-namaskâra, adoration of the Fathers, Brahman, Näräyapa. 19 Gâyatrî is also recited in the präriäyäma (JG. 1.13; BDh. 2.4.7.8; VäDh. 26.2; VaikhG. 1.3; VaikhDh. 2.10; Yaj. 1.24). Identifying prânâyâma is no problem since it is referred to by name. *° The following type of descriptive terminology identifies the arghya. MG. 1.2.4.... vimucyodakâHjalim utsrjati; VaikhG. 1.3 ... gâyatryâpo 'bhimantryâdityâbhimukham vikfipya ...; VaikhDh. 2.10 ... pratyarkam apo visrjya .... The japa may usually be identified by use of a verb form or nominal derivative of y/jap. Specification of the number of times Gâyatrî must be repeated also differentiates the japa from arghya. With regard to the japa, the greater the number of repetitions, the greater the benefits accrued. Thus in BDh. (2.4.7.5) 1,000 repetitions are sanctioned; the minimum number seems to hover between 10 and 8 (e.g. JG. 1.13; MG. 1.2.3). In the arghya, recitation of Gâyatrî is usually limited to three times. I have used this prevailing pattern in making attributions. 11 So also Kane, H. of Dh. II, Pt. 1, p. 314. " Sävitriip sahasrakftva âvartayec chatakftvo vä dasävaram at ha.</page><page sequence="7">SAMDHYÀ : MYTH AND RITUAL 167 Texts belonging to the Black Yajur Veda know both the japa and the arghya. The japa alone is specified in Mänava Dharma Sästra 2.101 and 2.22223 and Baudhäyana Dharma Sästra 2.4.7.5-7.24 In both the Käfhaka Grhya Sütra (1.28)25 and the Väräha Grhya Sütra (5.30)28 it is likely that the injunction to recite Gâyatrî pertains to arghya since both texts show a desire for three repetitions. Mänava Grhya Sütra mentions both the arghya and the japa',27 MG. 1.2.3 (... orfi bhür bhuvah svas tat savitur ityasfau krtvah prayunkte ...) probably refers to the japa,28 while MG. 1.2.4 describes the ritual action appropriate for the arghya (see fn. 20). The domestic rules of the Vaikhänasa school also mention both of these components. VaikhG. 1.3 (... asfivararyi sâvitrim ...) refers to the japa; the arghya description has been noted in fn. 20. In Vaikhänasa Dharma Sütra 2.10.5 satatp. dasätfau vä sävitrityi japtvä... refers to the japa ; for the arghya see fn. 20. From this evidence, it may be observed that the Vedic school determines the principal emphasis of the Samdhyä. The major emphasis is on the japa in all but the Black Yajur Veda, which demonstrates three alternatives. A definition of Samdhyä is further advanced by taking brief notice of the negative evidence. Samdhyä worship does not center about a fire altar into which offerings are proffered.29 However, it precedes such a srauta sacrifice, the Agnihotra.30 After completion of Samdhyä, the householder begins his performance of the Agnihotra,31 though, according to some opinions the homa in the grhya fire precedes the Agnihotra in the Vedic fire.32 The Agnihotra has a few details in common with Samdhyä. It too is to be performed daily at the time of dawn and dusk; contrary to 33 2.101: japarjis tiçthet savitrim ... (cf. 2.102); 2.222: ... japah japyam .... 24 ... sâvitriw sahasrakrtva ävartayet. " W. Caland (The Käthakagrhyasütra [Utrecht, 1925], p. 9) notes that the Bombay ms. of Brähmanabala and the ms. of Devapäla T read 'sävitrirfi trir anväha' for 'sävitrim anväha'. 28 ... sävitrirn trir adhitya. »7 So also Kane, H. of Dh. II Pt. 1, p. 315. 38 Note that MG. 1.2.3 specifies a different Savitf verse for each varna; only Brahmans may recite RV. 3.62.10. The räjanya recites RV. 7.45.1 which is in trif(ubh meter; the vaisya recites RV. 5.81.1, in jagati meter. " Although, there is some evidence for the presence of fire (see VaikhDh. 2.10) and the worship of fire (see JG. 1.13) within the Saipdhyâ. Cf. Goudriaan, "Vaikhänasa", 168; he notes the worship of fire before performance of Saipdhyä in Bhrgu's Khilädhi kâra and Käsyapa's Jnänakänifa. 80 For descriptions of the Agnihotra see P. V.

Yâj. 1.25.</page><page sequence="8">168 DORIS SRINIVASAN Samdhyä, the ancient tradition shows some ambivalence with regard to the timing of the Agnihotra.33 Though differences predominate,34 there seems to be an important affinity between the two rituals allowing for the Hinduist Samdhyä to replace the Vedic Agnihotra;35 one strong connec tion is that they are both Vedic solar charms.36 In defining Samdhyä in the Grhya Sütras, Dharma Sutras and Dharma éâstras, it has been found that the ceremony consisted of a core of actions around which accretions adhered. This core prescribed that a dvija should recite Gâyatrï during the morning and evening junctures of light. Recitation could occur in one of three ways : japa, arghya, or both. The discussion below considers whether this ritual situation finds its justifica tion in the Samdhyä myth. IV. The Sarfidhyâ Myth Passages from the Sadvirpsa Brähmana, Taittirïya Aranyaka, Atharva Veda Parisiftas, Rämäyaria, the Vâyu, Vifrtu and Brahmända Purâtias, Laghuhâ ritasmrti, Vfddhagautamasartihitä, Yoga- Yäjnavalkya as quoted by Smfti candrikä and Vfhatparâsarasaifihità testify to the existence of a well for mulated myth purporting to explain why and how the Samdhyä ritual ought to be performed each day. This is the explanation : As soon as the sun sets, demons are there to attack it. They try to devour the sun to keep it from rising. In order for sunlight to reappear, the struggle must be resolved. Alone the sun is not strong enough to defeat its enemies. A spell is divinely revealed to effectuate the desired outcome. The spell, when uttered in a ritual context taps the power of brahman. The worshipper must perform certain ritual actions precisely during the transition from night to day and from day to night. He must stand, facing East during the former time span; during the latter he must 33 Ibid. ; 999-1000. 84 These differences, pertaining to mantras, oblations, ritual components and appara tus (Vedic implements, altars etc.), and extent of priestly involvement preclude identi fying Sarpdhyä with the following passages (ÉG. 1.3.14; PG. 1.9.3; HG. 1.7.23.9; ÄpG. 3.7.21; KauL 73.2; and the descriptions in paragraph 46 in A.

Rather these passages indicate a separate grhya homa ritual having similarities with the Srauta Agnihotra. 36 L. Renou and J. Filliozat, L'Inde Classique (Paris, 1947), par. 1200; J. Gonda, Vifnuism and Éivaism, p. 74. 33 Dumont {VAgnihotra, viii-ix) states that the Agnihotra helps the sun to rise and aids it, night and day, on its daily course. See also A. B.

Doing so, and throwing up water consecrated by the spell conquers the enemies of the sun. The drops of water become thunder bolts (vajräf7 and these strike down the demons. To assist the sun, the twice-born throw up abundant water in the Samdhyä. Thereby, they stave off, for that day, the sun's foes and foster sunrise. A curse placed on these demons prevents them from ever dying. Thus the same battle is waged each night (from the setting until the dawning of light). This necessitates that Samdhyä must never be neglected. He who fails to do this duty is a killer of the sun; he who observes this duty promotes the uninterrupted succession of days and nights.88 In this manner, the sun maintains its course. This story emerges from both the Vedic and post-Vedic sources. The fundamentals of the myth are already clearly stated in the Sadvimsa Brähmaria (4.5) and the Taittiriya Äranyaka (2.2). These passages com plement each other well, as the translations and exegesis given below attempt to show. Sadv.Br. 4.5.2-4. 2.39 The Gods and the Asuras contended. The Asuras attacked the sun. The sun was afraid; his heart remained like a tortoise.. 3.40 He went to Prajäpati for help.

That he performs Samdhyä evening and morning, by doing this he gains a place among heroes and uninterrupted, continuous [succession of days and nights],45 he who knows this. TA. 2.246 Verily, the demons [mentioned] in the previous section,47 employed a powerful heat. Prajäpati coaxed them in the manner of a suitor. He granted them a boon. "The sun is our fighter". Prajäpati told them, "be engaged in war". Therefore these demons are indeed engaged in war with the rising sun as soon as it has set. Indeed these very demons are subdued by water consecrated with the Gâyatrî. Surely for that reason, these exponents of the sacred texts, facing eastward in Samdhyä, throw up waters consecrated by the Gâyatrî. These very waters having become thunderbolts hurl these demons to the island Mandeha Aruna (?). When they [i.e. the exponents of sacred texts] walk around from left to right, they dispel evil by [doing] this. The learned Brahman, the worshipper, contemplating the rising and setting sun, gains complete happiness. For indeed the sun is Brahma.

These actions, according to the myth, are effective in subduing demons who themselves possess an unusual and potent power, namely 'heat' (tapas). Tapas can have the sense of "magic power"48 belonging to benevolent as well as malevolent creatures. Already the Rig Veda testifies that tapas may be created by enemies of the Vedic ritual against those who support it.49 In the Samdhyä myth, the magic heat of the demons seems to be pitted against the physical heat of the sun, and, the latter is found wanting. The imbalance is overcome when those versed in the Vedas (brahmavädin) recite certain words. Sadv.Br. 4.5.3 specifies these as being rtatp. ca satyam ca, Om and the Gäyatri verse. TA. 2.2 mentions only Gäyatri in connection with the ritual act of throwing up water. Both texts agree that as this act is performed the waters become vajras;50 these, in turn, strike down the enemy of the life-giving sun.51 The water dispersion described in the myth agrees with the arghya portion of the Samdhyä ritual.52 Sadv.Br. 4.5.3 indicates that the Gäyatri formula, used in the ritual, is, in the myth, considered as part of a spell (bhesaja)53 which can activate the supranormal power brahman to work effectively for the benefit of the sun. In analyzing the bheçaja, much depends on the value assigned to ca. As 49 Chauncey J. Blair, "Heat in the Rig Veda and Atharva Veda", AOS 45 (1961), 5; J. Gonda's review of Blair's book in Indo-Iranian Journal VIII (1964), 66ff. See also H. Oldenberg, Die Religion des Veda (Stuttgart and Berlin, 1923), 401 ff. *• Blair, "Heat in the Rig Veda", 91. 50 Perhaps the water is already of a vo/ra-nature ; in SB. 7.5.2.41 water and vajra are equated because both can destroy evil. Association between vajra and water goes back to the Rig Veda, specifically to the Indra-Vrtra myth. In that context, the vajra hurled by Indra causes the destruction of Vrtra. Out of the belly of the defeated Vjtra flow the Cosmic Waters which are found to be pregnant with the sun. (See W. Norman Brown, "Creation") Cf. RV. 1.51.4. In this myth, as in the Saipdhyä myth, vajra is associated with two life-sustaining properties: water and light. 51 The use of vajra in this situation perfectly suits the way the term was understood in the Brähmanas. .. various objects or entities which exert a favourable influence upon vegetation or which are instrumental in producing what is good and useful for man in a more general sense, or also objects and phenomena which are regarded as active for the sake of the annihilation of evil, are, throughout the brähmaijas, called vajras. As a rule such vajras serve as a means of repelling evil spirits, destroying demons, driving away all sorts of evil and misfortune, but they are also instrumental in gaining what is good and desirable ..." (Gonda, Early Vifnuism, p. 41). AVPari 41.4.3 in describing the Saipdhyä myth, also mentions the drops of water becoming vajras and descending to the Asuras. " Cf. Stevenson, Rites, p. 222 for reference to mythic beliefs associated with the performance of arghya. " Lit. 'remedy'; see Mayrhofer, Skt.

In all languages concerned, *k"e consistently served to connect words, word groups etc. which are put on a par, especially... synonymous and opposite concepts.. ,".54 This finding, true for Skt. ca,55 is demonstrated in Sadv.Br. 4.5.3. In this passage the polysyndeton connects three groups of words. Each group is a segment of the spell. As such, they form together a com plementary set; the use of the repeated ca emphasizes their complementary nature. The three groups are: rtaiji ca sat y am ca; brahma comkärarp ca; tripadäm ca gäyatrim. Of these, the third group presents the least problem. Tripadâm describes the internal structure of the gâyatrï verse. From the foregoing sütra and sâstra literature, plus later mythic accounts, the identity of this verse can only be the specific mantra RV. 3.62.10.56 Scope for the interpretation of the second group, on the basis of the preceding, becomes restricted. Adhering to the value of the polysyndeton, it should likewise refer to a mantra. Therefore, the second set is understood as 'the sacred utterance Omkära'. The first set, most problematic, is con sidered herein also as a mantra, that is, as the pratika of RV. 10.190.1a.57 Thus, the bhesaja consists of three mantras which, we find, do actually appear in the Samdhyä ritual. Om and the Gâyatrï have been discussed in the preceding section in connection with the japa and the arghya. RV. 10.190 is the aghamar$at}a sükta. The hymn takes as its theme the creation of the universe, and therefore, does not seem to be thematically at odds with a myth concentrating on the daily re-creation of sunlight. What is problematic is its absence in other references to the Samdhyä myth and its belated appearance in the ritual.68 However, rtam ca satyaip ca ought to refer to a mantra since it is part of a complementary set consisting of other mantras and, since the conclusion of Sadv.Br. 4.5.3 (brahmano 54 J.

Bollée, trans. §adviw$a-Brâhmarw (Utrecht, 1956), p. 100, who understands this phrase as a general reference to a gäyatri verse. However, the ritual exigencies require a Savitf verse in the appropriate meter (cf. fn. 28). So also Eelsingh, 1908: 218 (though misprinted 3.62.50) (cf. fn. 13). " Rtam casatyam ca is a well-known combination (TS. 3.2.7.1 ; A$. 5.2.14; ÉG. 1.4.2; BDh. 4.4.2; Mahäbh. 12.152.30). On the complementary nature of rta and satya see Gonda's review of Lüders, Varuria in Oriens 13-14 (1961), 400ff. 55 The hymn is recognized early as a purificatory text (cf. TA 10.1.13) and as such it first appears in connection with Saipdhyä. In BDh. 2.5.8.11; 3.4.5 and VaikhG. 1.3 recitation of the hymn is part of the preliminary purificatory actions undertaken prior to the rite. Thus, by c. the 4th cent. A.D., the hymn had not found its standard position in Samdhyä.</page><page sequence="13">SAMDHYÄ : MYTH AND RITUAL 173 mukham apasyat) alludes to the brdhman power immanent in mantras, making them behave under ritualistic conditions as spells.59 Another ritual feature, in addition to the arghya,japa and timing, may be correlated to the mythic events. This is the worshipper's postures. For, when in the morning the worshipper stands facing East, and, when in the evening he sits facing West, does he not become the anthropomorphic expression of the movement of the sun? These postures are reminiscent of the overall aim of the myth, namely the orderly sequence of days and nights.60 The post-Vedic sources reiterate and elaborate upon the myth as outlined above. New information is attained on the nature and realm of the demons. A summary based on the later sources follows. Samdhyä exists because the sun is held in the enclosing Lokäloka mountains ( VäyuP. 50.161).61 The time of Samdhyä is the interval between Usas and Vyuçti, Usas is Night and Vyusti is Day (see VäyuP. 50.161 ; VisnuP. 2.8.49). At this time, Raksasas try to devour the sun (see VisnuP. 2.8.50; cf. VäyuP. 50.162); forcibly they wish to consume the light when it rises (see VrhPDh. p. 64, line 19). They consume by their power of heat (see VäyuP. 50.163).62 These Raksasas are known as Mandehas63 and they resemble mountains ; these fearful ones, of manifold forms, hang down from mountain peaks (Rämä. 4.40.41). Forming a huge multitude,64 they are condemned to incite and daily lose the battle.65 For Prajäpati (according to the ViçryuP. 2.8.51 it is Brahma) has put a curse on them that assures, forever, their inability to perish (see VäyuP. 50.162; VisyuP. 2.8.51). As a result, the dreadful fight between the sun and the demons is waged eternally (cf. VäyuP. 50.164; VisnuP. 2.8.52). Therefore, Brahma, the gods, Brahmans and those most in accordance with the ordered *• Cf. Gonda, "Mantra", 244 ff. for the mantra as power module in Vedic and post Vedic sources. 80 Cf. M. Eliade, Patterns in Comparative Religion (Cleveland and New York, 1963), 455-56 on man as a symbol fulfilling a myth, enacting a ritual. " "Beyond the sea of fresh water is a circle called 'the land of gold', and beyond this the circle of Lokäloka mountains, which form the limit of the sun's light, all the region on the one side being illuminated, and all on the other side of them being in utter darkness" (M. Monier-Williams, Indian Wisdom [London, 1876], p. 419, fn. 1). " Täpayant; cf. TA. 2.2.

By this water having become vajras, when it is consecrated by the Gâyatrî together with the sacred utterance Omkâra, the demons67 are burned68 {VâyuP. 50.165; VisnuP. 2.8.53; Yoga-Yaj.;89 VrhPDh., p. 65, line 9).70 Protected thus by Brahmans and the Välakhilyas, the blessed Lord (bhagavat, i.e., the sun) advances, rising to maintain life ( VisnuP. 2.8.59; cf. LHDh., p. 183, last line; p. 184, line 1). Therefore, performance of the Samdhyä ceremony must never be neglected; he who does not worship Samdhyä kills the sun (VisriuP. 2.8.58). The basic conflict described in the above summary closely parallels the Vedic accounts and incorporates those components (timing, mantras, arghya) which connect the myth to the ritual. Further, the demons' capacity to consume by tapas, and, the curse placed upon them, may both be anticipated from the Vedic sources. Curiously, the material which does appear to be new: the sun withheld at night in a rocky enclosure by a demonic extension of the enclosure might well have been part of the Vedic accounts too. For, the sun's nocturnal captivity in a nether region was already mentioned in the hymns of the Rig Veda. Therein, the power of the Vedic chants also causes the sun to rise at dawn. In the Rig Veda, these ideas are contained in the myth of the Panis, concerned with the continuous functioning of the Cosmic Law (rta) through the performance of the Vedic sacrifice.71 This myth tells the story of a group of anti-sacerdotal demons called Panis; they withhold a treasure mainly from mythical priests. The Panis withhold these riches outside the confines of the Vedic organized world (sat).72 Their domain is on the other side of the mythic River Rasâ, probably in the western sector of a region below the Vedic world. There, they have kept the treasure in a rock.73 It is the nature of the wealth and its significance to the priesthood which ignites a conflict. The withheld items are so essential to " sattama; (VrhPDh., p. 65, 1.6; Yoga-Yäj.) include sarve rçayaéca tapodhanäs as worshipping Sarpdhyä. " Daitya in all the above texts except ViçnuP. *8 VGDh. (p. 561, 1.14) only states that the casting up of waters destroys the demons of Mandehas. ViçnuP. 2.8.57 and Rämä. 4.40.41 indicate that the sunlight, as it rises and shines forth, burns the Mandehas. •• According to this text, the water is consecreated with Gâyatrï together with the sacred utterance called Vyâhftis. 70 In BrahP. 2.21 arghyadäna occurs in this context. " See D. Srinivasan, "The Myth of the Paijis in the Rig Veda", J AOS 93:1 (1973). '* See W. Norman Brown, "The Rigvedic Equivalent for Hell", J AO S 61 (1941), 79. " Lit. vald, meaning 'enclosure'.</page><page sequence="15">SAMDHYÀ: MYTH AND RITUAL 175 the performance of a Vedic sacrifice that without them the rites could not take place. The sun figures among these items. To release conditions necessary for the sacrifice and subdue the Panis, an unusual force is needed. Though nearly indomitable due to the nature of the treasure they withhold, the Panis sustain one vulnerability: their words lack magic power. By contrast, the chantings of the priests activate brahman. Thus the Panis are defeated by hymns, the brahman, and, on rare occasion, the vajra,74 With their defeat the treasure streams forth; light is set free to re-emerge along with other requisites for the sacrifice. The myth of the Panis (P myth) and the Samdhyä myth (S myth) illustrate some similar assumptions regarding the cosmological frame work in which the movement of light operates. Both myths imply that sunlight, once risen into the organized word, is safe. The danger exists during the sun's nightly sojourn beneath the Sat.75 This region is inhabited by demons who threaten to prevent the reappearance of light. The P myth and the Râmâyana and Visnu Puräna, dealing with the S myth, consider the sun to be trapped in a rocky confinement (Lokäloka - S myth; Vala - P myth) by demons standing in close relation to that enclosure (the Mandehas - S myth; the Panis, with whom Vala is allied [cf. RV. 10.67.6] - P myth). In both myths, the protagonists against the sun's enemy are the group having access to Vedic chants. These chants, being magic spells, are the effective weaponry. While the appropriate spell is specified in the S myth, the P myth does not isolate particular verses. Using terms which signify 'holy utterance'76 the P myth recognizes these as the direct weapon of victory. To get the sun in position to rise at dawn, the P myth makes the tacit assumption that the sun journeys from West to East in a rocky enclosure underneath the organized world; possibly this enclosure is considered to be an extensive range stretching between the two cardinal points in the nether world. The same supposition is observed when the evidence from the Rämäyaria and the Visnu Puräna is added unto the general scheme of the S myth. Do these several common assumptions indicate a direct relationship between the two myths? The evidence presented here, spanning wide chronological and religious progressions, could not support such a view. Moreover, other important details differ. The mythic situations are divergent enough to preclude one being a variant or development of the 74 RV. 1.33.10; in this instance, Indra, unaided by the priestly chantings, fights the Paijis alone. ™ For details in the P myth, see Srinivasan, "Paijis", pp. 56-57.

Nor are there philological connections between names and places of one myth to the other. Different too is the type of ritual associated with each myth. The S myth relates to a ritual devoid of fire and fire oblations; the P myth relates to a ritual, though hard to identify, which centers around the Vedic fire altar.77 It therefore seems that similar ideas regarding the nightly perilous movement of sunlight is not so much due to an interrelationship between the two myths, as to their both relating to the cosmological views ex pressed by another, perhaps earlier source. It might be a worthwhile investigation to see whether such concepts are contained in an Indo Iranian stratum.78 APPENDIX Sequence of components and verses currently recited in the morning Samdhyä by Smärta Maharashtrian Brahmans who follow the Säkala school of the Rig Veda.19 1.
