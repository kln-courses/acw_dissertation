Reviewed by WESTON LA BARRE Duke University Ever since Sanskrit was discovered by Eu- ropeans in the eighteenth century, an appar- ently insoluble riddle has lain at the heart of Vedic studies-the identity of the mysteri- ous, sacred psychotropic plant called soma. The problem is not a minor or incidental one. The eminent French Vedist, the late Louis Renou, thought the whole of the im- mense Rig Veda is present in nuce in the Vedic hymns to soma. W. D. O'Flaherty states categorically that the Soma sacrifice was the focal point of the Vedic religion. Indeed, if one accepts the point of view that the whole of Indic mystic practice from the Upanisads through the more mechanical methods of yoga is merely an attempt to replace the vision granted by the Soma plant, then the nature of that vision -and of that plant-underlies the whole of Indian religion, and everything of a mystical nature within that religion is pertinent to the identity of the plant. The careful scholarship of the dedicated am- ateur mycophile R. Gordon Wasson reads like an exciting scientific detective story. Moreover, his willingness to pursue the quest through the wide range of linguistics, archeology, folklore, philology, ethnobotany, plant ecology, human physiology, and pre- history constitutes an object lesson to all holistic professional students of man. First of all, use of the soma plant must date at least back to the time of a common Indo-Iranian stock, since the Avesta refers to the cognate haoma. However, the plant that some students identify with haoma can- not be the same as soma because their haoma is apparently an herbaceous plant, a haoma substitute that completely misfits the voluminous Vedic descriptions of soma. This, of course, does not militate against the possibility, indeed the probability, that the original haoma plant was the same as that here identified as soma. In any case, the Vedic evidence is considerably fuller and better than the Avestan. The earliest Vedic hymns date in their oral form from the period of about 1800 B.C., SO that the protohistoric horizon for soma use is probably also Indoeuropean. In the Rig Veda, only priests drank soma, and it conferred divinity on the Brahmanic "liv- ing gods." In the European tradition, the gods themselves obtained immortality through the eating of ambrosia (the curious and delicate odor of which is constantly re- ferred to) and the drinking of nectar (proba- bly mead, the cognate terms for which are pan-Indoeuropean). Thus, in Europe, the old weather mages, Othinn and Zeus, with their many shamanistic animal metamor- phoses, developed into anthropomorphic na- ture gods, whereas in India the old Indoeu- ropean shaman bards remained human and became a priestly caste. The soma-haoma term, however, is Indo-Iranian only; ambro- sia is cognate with the Indic amrita, indicat- ing that a divine substance was imbibed, but under different names. If the soma-ambrosia complex is thus early Indoeuropean, a northern Eurasiatic pro- venience is suggested. Here some striking philological facts emerge. Because of regular Grimm's Law-like sound shifts in Uralic lan- guages, we can demonstrate that there was an ancient Uralic word for fly-agaric or fun- gus, and moreover this word was held in common with ancient Indoeuropean. Since the cognate Indoeuropean words undergo regular Grimm's Law sound changes, we can confirm the antiquity of the term but not, perhaps, the direction of the borrowing. For example, the Ugric por3 is the Ostyak [tul]-paijx ("fool's punk," with which com- pare Magyar "fool's mushroom," whence 368</page><page sequence="2">Book Reviews 369 German "mad-mushroom") and also the Ob-Ugric pojx (compare Chukchi pog); the starred form *pajx was proto-Uralic, which ceased to be spoken ca. 6000 B.c. But por is also cognate with Greek sph6ngos, sp6ngi and the Latin fungus; Roman Jakob- son accepts this (Holger Pedersen's) etymol- ogy for fungal words in Indoeuropean. If sponge-fungus-punk are loan words in Indo- european from the common Uralic (or vice versa), then fly-agaric *parjx was being in- voked as a divine inebriant in northern Eurasia long before the Aryans left their ancestral home. With the antiquity of a hallucinogenic mushroom thus established, the whole complex of ecstatic shamanism in this same northern region now appears in a new light. A related fact is the use of dried fungus as punk tinder since at least Mesolithic times, for in the Maglemosian finds at Star Carr were discovered quantities of the punk-fungus Fomes fomentarius. Interest- ingly also, in many European languages toxic mushrooms are known as "toadstools" (an association possibly because toad skins contain the powerful hallucinogen bufote- nin); and in China the fly-agaric is actually called the "toad-mushroom"! Wasson thinks that "toadstool," unspecific for toxic and other mushrooms in English, was an origi- nally Celtic concept (crapaudin, from cra- paud "toad," is the modern French name) for the fly-agaric in its shamanistic role, as- sociated with great fear and awe and held under a powerful and lasting taboo. (Com- pare the Vogul belief that if laymen ate agaric it would kill them; and Donner says that among the Ket and Selkup only sha- mans and aspiring shamans could use agaric, for others would die from eating it.) St. Augustine still bitterly censured the here- tic Manicheans of the Old Religion for their fungus-eating. The Chinese also refer, in a twelfth-century text, to Manicheans who eat red mushrooms, a telling point, as we shall see (cf. the mysterious Taoist ling-chih, "mushroom of immortality," which even the great emperor Shih-huang searched for in vain). Another interesting folk complex associ- ates the "fire" of lightning with the flint "thunderstone" and with the fire latent in both flint and fungus punk-tinder. In the very old temple of Zeus Feretrius at Rome, the cult object was a flint (silex), while in European folklore Paleolithic hand axes were long and widely considered to be literal "thunderbolts" from the sky. Thus the "Funke" or residual spark struck from a flint in fire making is identical with the fire in the lightning that produced the "thunder- stone." Flint thunderstones are thus latent with the fire of Zeus for human Prome- theuses to steal. The fact that lightning some- times vitrifies silicon dioxide, far the com- monest mineral on the crust of the earth and chemically identical with flint, would encourage this uranic theory, though flint is in fact geologically neptunian in origin. Again, "toadstools" also are believed in folklore to be produced by thunder. Thus the Funke latent in the punk-fungus or touchwood-tinder is of the same skyey ori- gin. In this connection, it is interesting that the Vedic fly-agaric is repeatedly called "red" and is specifically associated with Surya the Sun, with the sky god Indra who brings rain, and with the trickster-god Agni (Latin ignis, "fire"); both toads and toad- stools often appear mysteriously after rain. Punk-fungus, like flint, holds hidden fire. "Spunk" is also the essential male soul-stuff or spark of life in semen, the divine Fire or logos of Heraclitus from whom Plato took his doctrine of the formative Idea. (Inciden- tally, Marco Polo says the Mongolian Uighur tribe's Khan was born directly of punk-much as Athene sprang directly from her sire's muellos, the brain-marrow thought by ancients to be the source, via the spine, of animal seed.) The Manicheans who ate mushrooms for immortality also used urine for ritual water. This practice recalls that of agaric-using Pa- leosiberian tribes who still in the last century drank the urine of the original partaker of fly-agaric in order to extend its pharmaco- logical action--a curious behavior but one confirmed by all our best ethnographic sources on several Siberian tribes. The mys- terious "Second Form" of the drink soma, then, as the urine of users, is the obvious in- terpretation of one puzzling Vedic verse. And, as opposed to the woolen "second filter" used to strain the mashed-up soma to obtain the juice, another filter is the god Indra, the first eater of soma, thence his urine as a magic drink. In brief, implicated with a rich and cornm-</page><page sequence="3">370 American Anthropologist [72, 1970] plex symbolism, the use of the agaric mush- room was known to early Uralic and In- doeuropean peoples, under a name common to both, and eastward through various Pa- leosiberians to China. Widespread also is the connection with a sky god, an origin of mushrooms (and thunderstones) in thunder, and fire (in flint and punk) from lightning. Far-flung as are the ethnographic evidences, their antiquity, nevertheless, suggests au- thentic common culture-historical origins. On the other hand, the easy suggestion that soma was an alcoholic liquor-for soma was a plant juice of some kind that was drunk as a liquid-is quite improbable. There are many arguments against this in- terpretation. Soma juice was drunk immedi- ately after ritual preparation, and there is no mention anywhere of a period of fermenta- tion, which, if present, the ritual litigiousness of the Vedic formulae would surely have taken into account. Furthermore, a beer (starch-fermented) or wine (sugar) could be made from many substances other than one sacred plant lost after the Indoeuro- peans had left their northern homeland; and it is repeatedly indicated in Vedantic texts that in India, after Aryans had left the Hi- malayas, the specific soma plant was no lon- ger available. Nor is there a shred of evi- dence in the Vedantic Hindu tradition of the ritual use of alcohol. Quite the contrary! A distilled drink strong enough to induce the attested-to psychedelic effect is unlikely also, for distillation of alcohol seems to be first known in late medieval Italy, probably in Salerno about A.D. 1100. Furthermore, if soma-ambrosia were a mere beer or wine, why drink mead-nectar also? Many plant sources have been suggested for soma. The leafless Sarcostemma is a fa- vorite candidate, also bhang or Cannabis in- dica (philologically an Indoeuropean enough plant, since "hemp" and "cannabis" by Grimm's Law are cognate), Ephedra, rhu- barb, etc. None of these halfhearted sugges- tions has carried any conviction, and all are implausible philologically, botanically, and pharmacodynamically. It is no wonder that most ranking twentieth-century scholars had come to regard the problem of soma as in- soluble. The difficulty has been partly one of meth- od. The compendious commentaries on the Vedas, the priestly Brahmanas, written from about 800 B.C. onward, are much preoccu- pied with the question of substitutes for soma. But the substitutes used later were al- ways known to be such. Hence it is a mis- take to suppose that the original soma was entirely similar to these Brahmanas substi- tutes or was even one of them, for all that they imitated, doubtlessly for magic reasons, one trait (such as the redness, etc.) of the original soma. It is on Rig Veda evidence alone that soma may be identified botani- cally as the ancient Aryan psychotropic plant. Another difficulty is that the abundant references to soma in the Rig Veda have been too easily dismissed as mere poetic met- aphor, and they do seem at first blush to be inconsistent with one another. Wasson's methodological astuteness has been to use Rig Veda evidence alone, eschewing the tempting but wholly irrelevant prolixity of the Brahmanas. When taken all together and respected literally for what they say, the Vedic apostrophes to soma turn out to be quite exact and mutually consistent botani- cal descriptions of the mushroom Amanita muscaria (Fr. ex L.) Quel., the fly-agaric. The fly-agaric first comes out from its un- derground mycelium looking like a little cot- tonwool ball. But as it expands, the envelop- ing white veil splits and breaks up into var- ious patches adhering to the bright red skin underneath. Sometimes, as with rain, the patches of veil are washed off entirely to re- veal a brilliant, shining red mushroom. After gathering, or when old, it loses luster and one phase is a dull tawny chestnut color. This is "the first time that a mush- room has been proposed in the Soma quest," but the evidence is overwhelming. To match each Vedic description, Wasson produces a color photograph of the mushroom in one or another of its phases-"he makes of milk his vesture-of-grand-occasion" (the early stage of milky white flocculence); "he sloughs off the asurian color that is his, he abandons his envelope" (the red pileus has split the enveloping veil in such fashion that only fragments of it remain); the vesture of hari, the vault of heaven clothed in storm clouds (the fiery canopy flecked with bits of the integument); Agni (fiery red, with flecks of white smoke); "the hide of bull, the dress of sheep" (the envelope in fragments adhering to the red skin); "by day the color of fire, by night silvery white" (Wasson</page><page sequence="4">Book Reviews 371 shows two color photographs, by day and by night, of the recognizably same group of three plants-to which one might add re- marks on the physiology of color vision with respect to seeing red at night); "the single eye" (the veil-free red ball-shaped state); Surya the Sun (a larger shining fiery red sphere); the tawny yellow pdvamana (in its opened "parasol" mature golden form); "the mainstay of the sky" (a long stem support- ing a white-flecked canopy); "with his thou- sand knobs" (a neatly polka-dotted form with studs like the cudgel of Indra); "tongue of the Way" (a long-stemmed, glans-headed specimen); and so on. Since the envelope-denuded agaric is a flaming scarlet mushroom, by ancient criteria the Brahmanas substitutes sought were reddish, small, leafless, and fleshy-stalked plants. But it is astonishing how exactly the Rig Veda has described the plant soma, when viewed as the fly-agaric. The scholarly triumph of Wasson's identification has been so decisive that the Botanical Museum of Harvard Uni- versity, in May of 1969, gave a dinner at the Harvard Faculty Club, attended by dis- tinguished botanists, Sanskritists, historians of science, and others, to celebrate the pub- lication of this book. But the evidence is not solely botanical. The common Uralic term for the fly-agaric is associated with its historic ethnographic use among the Ugric Ostyak and Vogul, the Uralic Samoyed, as well as the Paleosiberian Ket, Chukchi, Kamchadal, and Koryak-a use once also of Yukagir and Inari Lapp, with further evidence that the Finno-Ugric Hungarians and some Indoeuropeans had it too. The linguistic evidence points to a northern Eurasiatic region where Indo-Ira- nian peoples could find the agaric growing and borrow its use (or the reverse) from proto-Finno-Ugric or proto-Uralic peoples -and a region likewise where Indoeuro- peans could get their loan word sp6ngos- fungus-punk from a proto-Uralic word that spread even to linguistically unrelated Pa- cific Siberians like the Chukchi. The philo- logical evidence of the Rig Veda-Brahmanas is that in sub-Himalayan India, Brahmans could no longer find this plant of the north- ern homeland of the Aryans; and for all its being so highly prized, soma never lent itself to cultivation but was always found mysteri- ously god-engendered. The ecological evidence is even more stunningly apposite, for it joins solidly to- gether the mycology of both soma-agaric and punk-tinder. That is, the tribes that his- torically, and by inference prehistorically (Indo-Aryans), used agaric all lived in the region of birch (Betula) species: Amanita muscaria, fly-agaric-soma, is a toadstool of northern birch forests; and Fomes fomentar- ius, the ancient punk-tinder of flint-using times, is the bracket fungus commonly found growing on birch trees. (One might add that, archeologically, the palynological evidence from the Maglemosian Star Carr site places it in a birch forest climatic phase, indeed some specimens at Star Carr were still attached to birch wood.) The closure of linguistic, botanical, ethnographic, and eco- logical evidence is exhilarating. The identifi- cation of soma with Amanita muscaria is definitive, and the Sanskritic puzzle of two millennia from the Brahmanas to this day can now be regarded as finally solved. The evidence is perhaps wider than Was- son would venture. On excellent grounds he thinks that teonanacatl and agaric are thou- sands of years old in use, and yet he regards them each as "autonomous" in origin. But it is interesting that of the two color phases of Amanita muscaria, the flaming red variety, standard in Eurasia, grows in Washington, Oregon, and British Columbia as well (and also commonly in the Sierra Madre of Mex- ico), while the yellow variety prevails in birch forests of the rest of its range. It is true that within the Basidiomycetes, Ama- nita and the narcotic Psilocybe, Panaeolus, Stropharia spp. (the latter known to be in native use in Mexico, which Amanita is not) are quite different in appearance. And yet Mesolithic horizons are securely reached in some Paleosiberian and Amerindian similari- ties in culture-for example, the conical wig- wam-tipi spreads almost continuously from the Eastern Woodlands westward to Swedish Lapland, circumboreal "bear ceremonialism" (which now appears also to be late paleolithic in the eastern Alps), common myth motifs (e.g., the "magic flight" and Orpheus leg- ends), the similarity of proto-Sinitic and proto-Athapaskan (and of the Eskimo and Altaic languages?), the trickster Raven in eastern Siberia and the Northwest Coast, the evident Late Stone Age time depth of the bow and arrow in the Old and New World, etc. In</page><page sequence="5">372 American Anthropologist [72, 1970] this context, the possibility of cultural mem- ory or now lost legends about, or substitute stimulus-diffusion of, Siberian and American narcotic mushrooms is not wholly fantastic (n.b., the many so-called "mushroom stones" in Guatemalan archeology, which may be just that)--especially in view of fundamental similarities in shamanism and vision quest, and the fact of aboriginal use of some three dozen meridional American plant hallucinogens. Wasson is properly conservative on other matters. Narcotic mushrooms were not part of the witchcraft epidemics of late medieval and Renaissance Europe. Mushrooms, for all that the "toadstool" complex seems to be of Celtic origin, were not implicated with the Druidic mysteries, not at least on the basis of scanty evidence now available: the Golden Bough of the sky god's oak tree was evidently mistletoe. Mushrooms were not in- volved with the wild Viking "berserker" state (though Odman, a Swede, first pro- posed the idea in 1784 on the basis of his reading of Georgi and Steller, perhaps also of von Strahlenberg and Krasheninnikoff, all of whom, however, took their data from tribes in the extreme northeast of Siberia, not Scandinavia). The berserker "rage" seems rather to be related to shamanistic an- imal metamorphosis into the bear; besides, agaric is tranquilizing, not "berserker" in ef- fect. And, finally, the fly-agaric mushroom is not implicated with the Pilzbaum or Roman- esque "mushroom tree" or Garden of Eden scenes (e.g., the Plaincourault fresco). In addition to the many hand-tipped color plates of Amanita, distribution maps, etc., the lavishness of this book permits an un- precedented and in many ways ideal boon to scholarship: at the end of the book, all the classic ethnographic sources are quoted at length in full contextual detail. The conve- nient availability for re-scrutiny of all this familiar ethnographic evidence only con- firms the argument of the book: that the shamanistic use of the narcotic mushroom Amanita is of immense antiquity in northern Eurasia and elsewhere, and that the use of mushroom punk for flint-tinder is as old as the European Mesolithic. Small technicali- ties perhaps? But these small technicalities, soundly demonstrated, open whole new vis- tas into prehistory for further exploration. The cautious scholarship and careful method of Mr. Wasson-a retired banker, formerly a partner in J. P. Morgan &amp; Co.- may cause us to forget that as an ethnomy- cologist he is also an autodidact. This leads us to an interesting professional question. For aside from a brief lapse into mildly unprofessional and forgivable personalism involving his late wife, Mr. Wasson is fully professional in scholarly behavior, and moreover in several diverse fields. An ama- teur affection for data, pursued with such zeal and acumen, achieves here results really as good as the best professional work. But there are evidently autodidacts and autodidacts. One at least, L. M. Klauber (professionally an engineer), in his mag- nificent two-volume monograph Rattle- snakes, became manifestly the world author- ity on his subject; Klauber, indeed, is no less than masterly in his handling of the volumi- nous folkloristic and complex ethnographic data on snakes. Others, like Robert Ardrey (a dramatist and freelance journalist), cut no such professional swathe on the nature of man. Professionals are quite unimpressed with the democratic vote of laymen as a cri- terion of "success." But professionals consti- tute no impenetrable Establishment. They merely respond with approval (or dismay) to the relative mastery of information and to astuteness in assessing evidence. On this score experts may even disdain professionals like Thor Heyerdahl, Desmond Morris, and J. B. Rhine. There is also the matter of didactic prepa- ration, autodidactic or not, for the intellec- tual tasks one sets himself. Benjamin Whorf, for example, was an insurance man, but he studied with the world's peer linguist, Ed- ward Sapir, in earning his laurels as a lin- guist. Gordon Wasson, who later in life learned from such distinguished teachers as the mycologist Heim, the linguist Jakobson, and from Harvard's Schultes, the world's ranking authority on the ethnobotany of psychotropic plants, evidently belongs in the high company of the Klaubers and the Whorfs as a distinguished scholar in his own right. Wasson's research on soma is a thor- oughly remarkable scholarly achievement, judged even by the most stringent profes- sional standards. This book is on all counts a magnificent</page><page sequence="6">Book Reviews 373 one. The volume is in blue half-leather stamped in gold, and slip-covered in fine blue linen cloth. It is designed by Giovanni Mardersteig and printed in Dante type by the Stamperia Valdonega in Verona, on paper handmade by the Fratelli Magnani, with numerous color plates tipped in by hand, in an edition of 670 copies, of which 250 are available for sale in this country.
