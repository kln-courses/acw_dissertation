<plain_text><page sequence="1">© Journal of Islamic Studies 1 (1990) pp. 120-149 THE IMPACT OF IBN TAIMIYYA ON SOUTH ASIA Khaliq Ahmad Nizami Formerly Professor of History, Altgarh Muslim university Ibn Taimiyya (661—728/1263—1327) is one of the most dynamic and seminal personalities in the history of Islam. Born in an age which, to use Toynbee's words, was characterized by 'schism of the soul' and 'schism of the body politic', he struggled hard to revive Muslim society through inward animation and re-interpretation of its values in the light of a new spirit of ijtihad (interpretation of law) based on direct recourse to the Qur'an and the Sunnah of the Prophet. He therefore reacted most forcefully to the political decadence and social chaos which followed the irruption of the Mongols. He was born five years after Hulagu's sack of Baghdad and was in his teens when the Mongol storm inundated the eastern world of Islam. He struggled hard to turn the tide. When he breathed his last in 1327, Muslim and Mongol principalities existed side by side in Central Asia, the Ilkhans had stabilized their position in Persia and the Mongol tribes were converting to Islam. Much of this had been due to the efforts of Ibn Taimiyya. He came to be hailed as the mujaddid1 of his age.2 His thought influenced not only his contemporaries in the Muslim heartlands but reached far beyond: Muhammad bin Tughluq (1325-1351) the Sultan of Delhi, for example, became an ardent advocate of his ideology and sought to restructure political institutions in its light; many Muslim reform movements in the 18th and 19th centuries drew some degree of inspiration from him; in recent history his thought supplied elan to the movements for political liberation in South Asia. Surprisingly, no attempt has so far been made to assess the impact of his ideology on South Asia. 1 The word mujaddid means 'reformer' or 'regenerator'. A tradition of the Prophet cited by Abu Dawud says: 'God will, on the eve of every century, raise a person in this ummat who would renew Islam.' See also Shah Wall Allah, Izalat al-Khafa an Kbilafat al\x=req-\ Khulafa, (Bareilly, ah 1286), 271, for a discussion about mujaddids of different periods. 1 Siddiq Hasan Khan, Hajjaj al-Karama ft Athar al-Qayyama (n.d.), 136-7; Maqalat-i Shiblt (Azamgarh, 1955), V, 62.</page><page sequence="2">THE IMPACT OF IBN TAIMIYYA ON SOUTH ASIA I2.I LIFE OF IBN TAIMIYYA Ibn Taimiyya3 was born at Harran (near Damascus) on 22 January 1263, in a family known for academic attainment. The nature and reach of his reformist activity—both at the political and ideological level—can only be appreciated in the context of the Mongol invasions which had brought down the medieval Muslim state-system and torn up the fabric of Muslim civilization. Against that background of Mongol threat Ibn Taimiyya's father decided, sometime in 1268, to leave Harran and settle in Damascus. A decade earlier Baghdad had been sacked by Hulagu and Muslim political prestige touched its nadir. A few small states clung to a melancholy existence but with destruction imminent. The sheer number of Ibn Taimiyya's teachers (some 200) reflects the unstable conditions in which he had to complete his education. Significantly, one of those teachers was a learned lady called Zainab.4 At the age of seventeen he started instructing students, giving legal verdicts (fatawa) and writing books. He remained a celibate throughout his life. In 1282, on the death of his father, he was appointed professor in Hanbali law. His soul was stirred to its depths at the spectacle of the loss of Muslim political power,5 and he took it upon himself to mobilize Muslims for jihad against the Mongols.6 He found the Muslim society of his day demoralised, superstitious, and indolent, and commended the strictest measures to revitalise it. Some of his views brought him into conflict with the culama' and the mystics of his day. He went to Cairo to muster support for his anti-Mongol movement. He was imprisoned several times—in Damascus, Cairo, Alexandria and other places—for his views, but nothing could dampen his spirit. He criticised vehemently the un-Islamic accretions and attitudes of sects as well as individuals. He returned to Damascus after some eight years in Cairo, some of which were spent in an underground prison cell. A letter written to his mother from Cairo shows the depth of his commitment to his cause.7 A prolific writer, he 3 For his life see: DhahabT, Tadhkirat al-Huffa$ (Hyderabad, ah 1334), IV, 288; Ibn Shakir al-Kutubl, Fawat al-Wafayat (Bulaq, ah 1299); al-Subkl, Tabaqat al-Shaf'iyya (Cairo, AH 1324), V, 81-212; Ibn al-WarsdT, Tarikh (Cairo, AH 1285, II, 254 f; Ibn Hajar al\x=req-\ Haytaml, al-Fatawa al-Haditbiya (Cairo, ah 1307, 86 f; al-Suyufi, Tabaqat al-Huffdz (n.d.).

In utter desperation his opponents had him deprived of pen and ink. Disarmed and dismayed, he tried to write something in coal.8 However, he was unable to long survive the cruel order which denied to his revolutionary zeal the outlet it needed in writing. Within twenty days, he breathed his last in the prison on 20 Dhu 1-Qa'da 728/1327. His funeral prayer was read several times in Damascus and in absentia at a number of places in different parts of the Muslim world, even China. Ibn Taimiyya's movement did not die with him. It became a force thereafter and was carried to different regions by his admirers and followers. It provided a prop to political systems, sustained freedom movements and activized the spirit of fresh interpretation of religious law. jihad at the political and ijtihad at the intellectual level became the inspiring motives of his movement for the regeneration of Muslim society. IBN TAIMIYYA'S THOUGHT It is not necessary to discuss here all aspects of Ibn Taimiyya's thought, but reference may be made to some of his ideological positions in order to follow their impact in South Asia: (a) Ibn Taimiyya believed in ijtihad9 (fresh interpretation of religious law) and considered himself mujtahid ft al-madhab.10 His Majmulat al\x=req-\ Rasa'il al-Kubra reflects his views on ijma1 (consensus of Muslim learned opinion), qiyas (analogical inference) etc. (b) He interpreted Qur'anic verses with an anthropomorphic reference literally.11 (c) He opposed innovations in religious matters (bid1 at).11 This brought him into conflict with a number of sects, like Ash'arls, 5 Two of his letters written with coal have been reproduced by Ibn al-Hadl in al-'Uqud al-Durriya (Cairo, 1938), 365-7. ' For Ibn Taimiyya's views on the subject, see Fatawa-i Ibn Taimiyya, (Egypt, ah 1329), ii, 376-8, 404-5. Ibn Qayyim has explained those views at length in his book A'lam al\x=req-\ Muwaqa'in (Munirya, Cairo, ah 1325), iv. 10 See Mar'i b. Yusuf al-Karrai, al-Kawakib al-Durriya ft Manaqib Ibn Taimiyya (Cairo, ah 1329), 184 f, where the author refers to certain matters in which Ibn Taimiyya refused taqlid (adherence to established position) and concurrence with ijma' (consensus of Muslim learned opinion). 11 See Majmu'at al-Rasa'il al-Kubra (Sharfiya Press, Egypt, ah 1323), i, 387 f.

(e) He criticized Shaikh Muhl al-DTn Ibn al-'Arabl for his doctrine of wahdat al-wujud (unity of the noumenal and the phenomenal). (f) He considered illegal all journeys undertaken to visit shrines. (g) He considered admissible the levy of taxes by the state over and above those laid down by God. However, he exempted those who paid such taxes from payment of zakat. (h) He believed that it was imperative to have an imam to regulate and direct the life of the community and give it cohesion, unity and discipline, even when political power was in non-Muslim hands. (i) He believed in unified and integrated community life without any separation between religion and politics. Whether in prison or in madrasah, Ibn Taimiyya's sole concern was to awaken Muslim masses from their stupor, to remove their confusion of mind, inspire them with the spirit of ijtihad to meet the challenge of the time, and to take them to the Qur'an and the Sunnah as the safest guides in moments of trial and turmoil. A reformer determined to rejuvenate a whole society could not but come into conflict with a number of elements that obstructed his progress. Ibn Taimiyya refused to accept the Sufis' stance to the effect that, as state and religion had different paths, they could have nothing to do with politics. Such an approach would render his whole mission fruitless. He had to mobilize all the talents of all the community in order to deal with its social, ideological and political problems. Anxious to strengthen mosques as the lynch-pin of Muslim community-life, he criticized the construction of khanqahs, zawiyabs and jam'at khanahs as innovations. EARLY SIGNS OF IMPACT ON SOUTH ASIA Circumstantial evidence shows that even during the early phase of Ibn Taimiyya's career, India did not remain ignorant of the religious trends initiated by him, though their actual application was varied and sporadic. During the time of Ibn Taimiyya's struggle against the Mongols, Bal\x=req-\ ban (1266-1287), 'Ala' al-DTn Khaljl (1296-1316) and Muhammad 13 See Mar'i, al-Kawakib, 165; Abu Zahra, Shaikh al-lslam lbn Taimiyya, 170 f.

There is direct evidence of Muhammad bin Tughluq's admiration for Ibn Taimiyya's ideas; and indirect, circumstantial evidence of the impact of those ideas on others. Given the nature of political and intellectual contacts between South Asia and (as it is now called) the Middle East, it is improbable that these Sultans did not know of the defence strategies evolved in other Muslim lands which had suffered from the Mongols. Balban gave shelter to many scholars who had been hunted out of their homelands by the Mongols.14 He named fifteen quarters in the capital after these refugees.15 Among his favourite 'ulama' were pupils of Imam Fakhr al-Dln RazT,16 Maulana Burhan al-Dln MarghinanI17 (author of Hidaya), and Maulana RazT al-Dln Hasan SaghanT (author of Mashariq al-Anwar)}% In such circumstances Delhi could hardly have remained ignorant of attempts being made in the contemporary Muslim world to meet the Mongol threat. During the reign of 'Ala' al-Dln KhaljT, South Asia could boast of having sheltered many eminent scholars of Central Asia and Persia. Referring to the intellectual achievements of the age of 'Ala' al-Dln KhaljT, BaranT says that books written outside India were accepted as authoritative only when the scholars of Delhi approved them.19 The Sultan had diplomatic relations with the Ilkhans and had welcomed Rashld al-Dln Fadl Allah20, the famous historian and scholar of the age. Despite all his shortcomings, 'Ala' al-Dln had established an efficient administration of the Muslim institution of bisba21 (control of public standards of morality, law and order). According to BaranT, the Emperor would say: 'If I punish a thief or an adulterer or a drunkard, it is not because he has done any wrong to me, but because I follow the path of the Prophets.'22 He dealt with the IbahatTs (who had legalized certain immoral practices) in the same religious spirit.23 During his reign Maulana Shams al-DTn Turk came to Multan from Egypt and brought with him four hundred books on ahadith eager to establish the science of their study in South Asia.24 Some writers think that he was no other 14 See K.

Some identical trends in religious thought in South Asia and the Middle East illustrate the extent of that contact. While discussing the legality of music in a mahzar meeting convened by Sultan Ghiyath al-Dln Tughluq (1320—1325), the well-known ChishtT saint Shaikh Nizam al-Dln Auliya quoted a hadith of the Prophet, but the culama' of Delhi refused to listen to him and said: 'We want the verdict of Imam Abu Hanlfa, not a tradition of the Prophet'. The Shaikh, distressed, remarked that a city in which the 'ulama' refuse to listen to the traditions of the Prophet, is doomed.26 Shaikh Nizam al-Dln Auliya may have arrived at his belief in ijtihad entirely independently, but it is interesting that he should have come to a line of religious thinking so similar to the one that had inspired Ibn Taimiyya. This led Nawab Siddlq Hasan Khan, the most ardent South Asian advocate of Ibn Taimiyya's views in recent years, to suggest that there was an identity of approach between Shaikh Nizam al-Dln Auliya and Ibn Taimiyya. He writes: 'In this matter Shaikh al-Islam Ibn Taimiyya agrees with Nizam[al-Dln] Auliya.'27 One of the scholars who supported Shaikh Nizam al-Dln Auliya at the mahzar meeting was Maulana 'Alam al-Dln, a grandson of Shaikh Baha al-Dln Zakariyya of Multan, who was known for his extensive travels in Muslim lands.28 Some later writers consider him an advocate of Ibn Taimiyya's ideology,29 but contemporary records contain nothing on this point. Influence on Muhammad bin Tughluq With the accession to power of Sultan Muhammad bin Tughluq (1325-1351) positive historical evidence does become available about the influence of Ibn Taimiyya in South Asia. 'Abd al-'AzIz ArdbailT, a pupil of the Shaikh al-Islam, visited the court of the Sultan. According to Ibn 15 Abu Zahra, Hayat-i Shaikh al-lslam lbn Taimiyya (Lahore, 1971), Urdu translator's preface, 4. " Mir Khurd, Siyar al-Auliya (Delhi, AH 1302), 531.

Of all the Sultans of Delhi, Muhammad bin Tughluq had the most intimate knowledge of the political and ideological developments in the Islamic world beyond Indian frontiers. His responses to these developments were quite in accord with the views of Ibn Taimiyya—the following actions, in particular, bear the unmistakable stamp of Ibn Taimiyya's thought: (1) The Sultan's declaration—'State and Religion are twins',31 clearly echoes Ibn Taimiyya's ideas. The Sultan firmly rejected any separation between state and religion, as advocated by the mystics. This is exemplified in the correspondence he had with foreign powers: for example, Sultan Abu Sa'ld to Sultan Muhammad bin Tughluq, obviously wanting to demonstrate his commitment to the same ideology, writes: According to [the maxim] 'Religion and State are twins', [I] have always considered state essential for religion, and religion the cause of the permanence of the state.32 The ChishtT saints had given wide berth to the government of the day and warned their senior disciples against consorting with kings, accepting their endowments or indulging in shugbl (government service).33 They believed that after the Khilafat-i Rashida the paths of religion and state had separated, and serving the state was no longer identical with serving the religion. Muhammad bin Tughluq opposed this ideological stance of the mystics and forced them to make their services available to the state. He extricated many younger saints of distinguished mystic families from the khanqahs and obliged them to serve the state. Shaikh Mui'zz al-DTn and Shaikh 'Alam al-Dln who belonged to the renowned mystic house of Ajodhan, were entrusted with administrative responsibilities. Shaikh Mui'zz al-Dln was sent to Gujarat but failed to control the situation 30 Ibn Battuta, Rehla (Cairo, 1928), ii, 44. 31 Mir Khurd, Siyar al-Aultya, 196. 32 Bayaz-i Taj al-DJn Ahmad Wazir, ed.

A. Nizami's article 'Early Indo-Muslim mystics and their attitude towards the State', Islamic Culture xxii-xxiv (Oct. 1948, Jan. 1950).</page><page sequence="8">THE IMPACT OF IBN TAIMIYYA ON SOUTH ASIA 12.7 there and was killed by the rebels.34 Shaikh 'Alam al-Dln was appointed Shaikh al-Islam3i with the responsibility of looking after the religious classes. While the Chishtis joined government service under duress, the mystics of the Suhrawardl order did so of their free will.36 To break the isolationist attitude of the Chishti mystics the Sultan married his daughter into a well-known Sufi family of Nagaur.37 Inspired by the ideas of Ibn Taimiyya, he was anxious to return to an integrated approach to religion and state as had developed under the Pious Caliphs. His views were, however, distorted by others and his motivations became subject to doubt and distrust. The following two instances illustrate the nature of the misrepresentation: (a) Ibn Battuta writes:38 When Sultan Muhammad became the ruler, he adopted the practice of assigning khidmat to jurists, saints and pious people, and in support of this practice cited the rulers of the first century [khulafa-i Rashidin] who never assigned any work to one who was not a scholar or a wise man. The significance of the word khidmat was missed by later writers who twisted it to mean that the Sultan expected 'personal' services, like those of attendants, keepers of royal wardrobes, etc.3' However, reference to 'the rulers of the first century' makes it clear that the service meant was to the state not to an individual, and that the Sultan regarded this as a return to the practice that prevailed during the time of the khulafa-i Rashidin. (b)The Jawami' al-KalTm informs us that the Sultan would say: 'What have Abu Bakr, 'Umar, 'Uthman and 'Ali done which we cannot do?'40 This was not vain bluster, rather assertion of an ideological aspiration. 34 Mir Khurd, Siyar al-Auliya, 196. 35 ibid., 196-7. lr it be accepted, though no contemporary evidence on this point is available, that Shaikh 'Alam al-DTn, grandson of Shaikh Baha al-DTn Zakariyya of Multan, had come under the influence of the teachings of Ibn Taimiyya, the relations of the Suhrawardi saints with Sultan Muhammad bin Tughluq can be very neatly explained. Shaikh Rukn al-DTn Multani's support to the Sultan in his various measures, his acceptance of the title of Shaikh al-Islam etc, indicate his close association with the Sultan in the implementation of his policies.

Their ideals should be followed as active principles of life. No claim of equality was implied in the Sultan's assertion, rather a desire to emulate them as models of conduct. When the Sultan put forward these views, he was grossly misunderstood and fiercely maligned. The contemporary historian BaranI charged him with tabakkumat-i mujaddiyya*1 (innovatory injunctions) and said that 'he wanted to combine kingship with prophethood'.42 Nothing could be further from the truth. What the Sultan had aimed at was bridging the gulf between religion and politics as advised by Ibn Taimiyya. (2) Ibn Taimiyya had mobilized opinion against the Mongols and preached jihad against them. From Damascus to Alexandria he had created a powerful resistance movement against the Mongol occupation of Muslim lands. Muhammad bin Tughluq implemented that policy in South Asia. He called himself Abu. al-Mujahid,*3 and exhorted people for jihad against the Mongols. Mir Khurd informs us: In those days he [Sultan Muhammad bin Tughluq] wanted to control the lands of Turkistan and Khurasan and overthrow the descendants of Chengiz Khan. All the elite and elders of Delhi44 and those living in adjoining areas were asked to be present. A huge tent was put up and under it a pulpit was placed. He sat on this pulpit and persuaded people to prepare for jihad ... and said: I want to overthrow the descendants of Chengiz Khan. You should cooperate with me in this struggle.45 The correspondence between Sultan Abu Sa'Id and Sultan Muhammad bin Tuqhluq, as available in Bayaz-i Taj al-Dtn WazTr,46 shows that both were anxious to evolve a common strategy for meeting the Mongol menace. (3) The Sultan strictly enforced the ihtisab regulations as enjoined by the Shart'a law and as insisted upon by Ibn Taimiyya. Himself punctilious in the performance of obligatory prayers and in observing fast,47 he 41 Baranl,Tartkh-i Firuz Sbahi, 457. *2 ibid., 459. K. A.

People were asked to be regular in the performance of their obligatory prayers. Those found loitering in the bazar after the call for prayers (adhan), were punished. Ibn Battuta informs us: The Sultan's order was that everybody should learn namaz and essentials of faith. So people were found committing to memory namaz in the bazars and getting these written on papers.4' When the Sultan entered the women's quarters, all women with whom Shari'a law prescribes seclusion, were removed from his sight.50 (4) Muhammad bin Tughluq's concept of kbilafa was also deeply influenced by the views of Ibn Taimiyya. He considered recognition of authority by the khalifa an essential and indispensable legal requirement. Those who failed to obtain this recognition were 'usurpers' in his opinion.51 So, pending caliphal recognition of his authority, he stopped Friday and 'Td prayers in his realms.52 Not realizing the significance of this order people considered it an interference in religion.53 In the same spirit, the Sultan stopped inscribing his own name on the coins and inscribed on them only the name of the khalifa.54 When the farmati was received from the Caliph in Cairo,55 the Sultan took bay't (oath of fealty) from people with the Qur'an and the Mashariq al-Anwar placed before him.56 (5) Many of Muhammad bin Tughluq's actions, like those of Ibn . Taimiyya, reflected an anxiety to revive the traditions of the Prophet in every walk of life. He was quite aware of this role: his coins pronounced him as Muhi-i-Sunan-i-Kkatim al-Nabiyyin57 (reviver of the traditions and practices of the last of the Prophets).

In his early years Muhammad bin Tughluq had shown great respect to contemporary saints, but under the influence of Ibn Taimiyya his attitude changed. At his request Shaikh Sharaf al-DTn Yahya of Maner wrote two volumes elucidating the principles and practices of mysticism but the Sultan remained unconvinced. He asked for more elucidation but the Shaikh declined, commenting: 'he who is deprived of the real mystical norm will never known anything.'18 Significantly enough this letter opens with the Qur'anic verse: It may happen that ye hate a thing which is good for you and it may happen that ye love a thing which is bad for you. Allah knoweth, ye know not. [2: 216] The Sultan clashed with the Sufis on the following issues: (a) their concept of walaya (b) their disassociation from government service, (c) their dress and demeanour, and (d) their khanqah life. The concept of walaya rendered it obligatory on mystics to remain rooted to the place assigned to them by their spiritual mentors/' Muhammad bin Tughluq asked them to move to different parts of the country according to his directions.60 He sent the Sufis resident in Delhi to the distant Deccan,61 brought the Muslim elite in from adjoining areas to Delhi and settled them there." He asked Maulana Shams al-Dln Yahya to move to Kashmir." Two eminent mystic houses of the time, Ajodhan and Nagaur, also felt the impact of the Sultan's policy. Only Shaikh NasTr al-Dln Chiragh, successor of Shaikh Nizam al-DTn Auliya, refused to move out of Delhi and bore all the hardships and punishments inflicted on him by the Sultan.64 The mystics' principle of abjuring government service was also assailed by Muhammad bin Tughluq and Sufis were made to accept 58 Maktubat-i Sharaf al-Dtn Ahmad Maneri, MS in Khuda Bakhsh Library Patna, letter No. 207, 216-7, as translated by A.

The kbanqah life in South Asia suffered a set-back as a result of this policy. BaranI informs us that when Muhammad bin Tughluq died and Firuz Shah succeeded him: The khanqahs of the city and its environs, and of towns within four or five karohs of the city, and, in fact the whole empire, had been lying in ruins for years, no bird flew there and no thirsty man got any water there. Owing to Firuz Shah's royal favours, the keepers of khanqahs, the sufis, the devotees, the qalandars, the Haideris, the travellers and the indigent became prosperous and satisfied." According to Mir Khurd, the Sultan was opposed to mystic dress and forced the sufis to give it up. If anybody showed respect to his spiritual mentor the Sultan angrily admonished him: 'Give up these beliefs involving heresy.'66 (7) Ibn Taimiyya believed in just and generous treatment of all non\x=req-\ Muslims (dhimmis) living in a Muslim state. In a letter to the Christian ruler of Cyprus he wrote: We people seek the welfare of all. We wish that God may bless you with the good of this and the next world, because it is the duty of one who has faith in God to wish well of His creation. The Christians will themselves bear witness to what I am saying. When I approached the Tartars for the release of the prisoners of war, their ruler Ghazan released only the Muslims and told me that they had Christians also as prisoners whom they had brought from there. 'These [Christians] will not be set free' [he said]. I told him: 'No. Besides Muslims, you should set free the Jews and the Christians also as they are our dhimmis. We cannot tolerate their remaining in prison, neither in the hands of Muslims, nor non-Muslims.' So we got the Christians also liberated.67 Muhammad bin Tughluq's extraordinarily good treatment of the non\x=req-\ Muslims clearly recalls Ibn Taimiyya's line. The Sultan gave full religious freedom to the Hindus and treated them generously. Ibn Battuta informs us that once a Hindu noble lodged a complaint with the qadT against the Sultan that he had killed his [the plaintiff's] brother without reason. The Sultan was summoned by the qadT, and appeared in the court without arms and, accepting the verdict of the qadT, conciliated with the Hindu noble.68 This was an unprecedented event in the history of India at this time.

One of Ibn Taimiyya's three essential conditions for legitimate exercise of political authority was that a ruler should be lmam-i 'Adil,70 and Muhammad bin Tughluq was anxious to fulfil this condition. (9) Ibn Taimiyya's interest in jurisprudence and emphasis on ijtihad inspired the same in Muhammad bin Tughluq. He knew the Qur'an by heart and for all practical purposes the Hidayah was on the tip of his tongue.71 He believed in fresh interpretation according to the exigencies of the situation and had a group of 'ulama' always around him. With them he discussed and debated every matter; he never issued orders for the execution of anybody unless these 'ulama' concurred with his judgment.72 If he failed to convince them he would immediately set free the person held in custody. He told the jurists that if anybody was unjustly executed, they would be responsible for shedding innocent blood.73 Never before in the history of the Delhi Sultanate were intended executions thus discussed with the 'ulama' in the light of the Shari'a. (10) A deep religious conviction seems to have motivated many of the Sultan's actions. He called Deogir, the second administrative city of the Empire, Qubba-i Din-i Islam74 ('vault of the Islamic religion'). This was not without significance. He asked Maulana Fakhr al-DTn Zarradl to go to Kashmir in order to 'sit in the idol houses and preach Islam there'.75 His claim to be the 'reviver of the traditions of the last of the Prophets', read alongside these remarks, provides an insight into the working of his mind. (11) Ibn Taimiyya considered rebellion against established Muslim authority injurious to public well-being. When Muhammad bin Tugh\x=req-\ luq's various projects provoked strong reaction and the religious classes justified rebellion against him,76 Muhammad bin Tughluq must have derived moral support from the ideology of Ibn Taimiyya. For the first time in Indian history, coins were used to advocate loyalty to the Sultan. The inscriptions on Muhammad bin Tughluq's coins referred to the " Badaoni, Muntakhab al-Tawarikh (Biblioteca Indica, Calcutta, 1864), i., 225. His coins and buildings also pronounce him as such, see Lane-Poole, The Coins of the Sultans of Delhi in the British Museum (London, 1884), Nos. 280-282. His fortress in Delhi was called 'Adilabad. 70 Minhaj al-Sunnah, ii, 85. 71 Shihab al-Dln al-'Umarl, Masalik al-Absar, 37; Ibn Hajar Asqalant, al-Durrar al\x=req-\ Kaminah (Hyderabad, ah 1348), iii, 460. 72 Yahya SirhindT, Tarikh-i Mubarak Shahi (Calcutta, 1931), 115-6. 73 ibid.; Badaoni, Muntakab al-Tawarikh, 239. 7* E.

That low born people—e.g. vinters, gardeners, weavers, etc.78—could rise to eminence in the state was a positive contribution of the Sultan to Indian polity of this period. Historians have attributed the germination of this approach to the influence of philosophy on the Sultan. Considered in its proper context it had its roots in the Islamic principles of equal treatment for all, as propounded by Ibn Taimiyya. (13) Though practically all Arab writers of the period, the authors of al-Durrar al-Kaminah, Subh al-A'sha, al-Acyan al-'Asr etc., have paid eloquent tribute to Muhammad bin Tughluq's erudition and generosity, the account of the Sultan in Masalik al-Absar has a special significance. Its author Shihab al-Dln al-'Umarl, a resident of Damascus, was a follower of Ibn Taimiyya. His appreciation of the Sultan's religious attitude and behaviour is, in fact, an appraisal of him in the light of Ibn Taimiyya's ideology. He expressly observes of the Sultan: 'He is one who does not permit the prohibited actions, nor lets anyone [have] of forbidden things and none dare commit openly in the country unlawful acts and most sternly he forbids the use of wine.'79 Discussing the Sultan's various measures he says: 'the beacon of SbarT'a is shining on account of him'.80 He praises his dispensation of justice most eloquently: 'Everyone who wants to approach him can reach him. Neither the greatness of the chamberlains nor their curtains can keep him back.' Summing up, Shihab al-Dln writes: 'he fears God in secret and in public, [and] does not commit a prohibited thing and does not yield to it.'81 Zia al-Dln BaranT, who seems to have been ignorant of the intellectual scene in the Islamic world at that time and known nothing about the ideology of Ibn Taimiyya, attributed Muhammad bin Tughluq's religious attitudes and policies to the local influence of contemporary Indian philosophers, like Sa'd MantaqT, 'Ubaid, Najm Intashar and 'Alim al-Dln.82 Under Muhammad bin Tughluq, the state espoused the ideology of Ibn Taimiyya. Firuz Shah Tughluq, his successor, though deeply interested in 77 H. N. Wright, Coinage and Metrology, 143; E.

The state never again came under the influence of Ibn Taimiyya's ideology whose impact turned slowly and gradually into purely religious channels. EARLY RESPONSE TO IBN TAIMIYYA'S IDEAS Perhaps the most outstanding religious figure of the period who responded, reacted or modified mystic attitudes in the light of the situation created by the dissemination of Ibn Taimiyya's ideas, was Shaikh NasTr al-Dln Chiragh of Delhi (d. 1356). He resolutely affirmed: The ways of a spiritual mentor cannot be cited as justification for any action. One can justify his action only on the basis of the Qur'an and the Sunnah of the Prophet.83 and rescued the mystic movement from criticism. He stopped the practice of prostration before a spiritual master84 and forbade reverence at graves.85. Certain Qur'anic verses with anthropomorphic references were the subject of bitter controversy in those days. Ibn Taimiyya who had expressed his views on this subject in his Tafstr-i Siirah-i lkhlas86 was criticised on that count. A visitor once tried to draw Shaikh NasTr al-Dln Chiragh into that controversy but the Shaikh confined himself to a very brief reply and changed the subject.87 Shaikh Naslr al-DTn's views about the vision of God are clearly stated in the Khair al-Majalis.*% The Shaikh believed that the vision of God is possible in this world. 'Had it not been so, Moses would not have prayed to God for it,'89 argues the Shaikh. Ibn Taimiyya had criticised all those who believed in such a possibility.90 The fact that Shaikh NasTr al-Dln was known as Abu Hanifa Thani can either be interpreted to mean that he adhered strictly to the HanafT school of law or that he used the same intelligence in dealing with religious issues as was characteristic of Imam Abu Han'fa- The latter 83 Shaikh 'Abd al-Haqq Muhaddith Dehlawl, Akhbar al-Akhyar, 81. 84 Hamid Qalandar, Khair al-Majalis, ed. by K.

SafJ al-Din al-Hindi's debates in Damascus Safl al-Dln al-Hindl (1246—1315), born and brought up in Delhi, settled in Damascus. He was looked upon as the leader of the Shafl'ite and Ash'arite scholars of his day.91 Hafiz Ibn Qayyim, a distinguished follower of Ibn Taimiyya, was his pupil and had lived with him till his death. Safl al-Dln challenged Ibn Taimiyya's views on anthropomorphism and had public debates with him in Damascus. Some of these debates were arranged by the government of Syria, and had official support. Notwithstanding SafT al-DTn's eminence as a scholar and jurist, he could not stop the impact of forces which Ibn Taimiyya had released. How Safl al-Dln al-Hindi's views were received in India is not known. After Muhammad bin Tugbluq Though Ibn Taimiyya is not explicitly mentioned in the religious literature of early medieval India, his impact is discernible in some of the trends of the period. Shaikh Ahmad Sirhindl (1564-1624), popularly known as Mujaddid-i Alf Than!, makes no reference to Ibn Taimiyya in his writings but his criticism of Ibn al-'Arabl's wahdat al-wujud (unity of the noumenal and the phenomenal) established his intellectual identity with Ibn Taimiyya. Perhaps confronted by similar situations, Ibn Taimiyya and Shaikh Ahmad Sirhindl regarded wahdat al-wujiid, as a source of confusion in religious thought. Of course, Shaikh Ahmad's faith in mysticism as a means to invigorate spiritual life remained strong. Nevertheless, he made the SharVa the main prop of his spiritual discipline and openly criticised Sufis who strayed from it. This adaptation, conscious or unconscious, of Ibn Taimiyya's ideology to the South Asian situation, had far-reaching effects on subsequent religious developments in the region. Ibn al-'Arabl's thought was rejected, mystic discipline strengthened, and the erratic behaviour of the pseudo-mystics condemned. " He was born in Delhi in 1246 and educated there. He left India at the age of 23 and after visiting several Muslim countries settled in Damascus. His Indian accent in pronunciation continued till the last.

Shah Wall Allah's stay in Hijaz afforded him thorough insight into the thought of Ibn Taimiyya of which his teacher, Shaikh Abu Tahir Kurd! of Madina, was an ardent advocate. But the latter was an admirer of Ibn al-Arabl as well as Ibn Taimiyya. Shah Wall Allah imbibed this approach of evaluating conflicting ideological positions in an objective and dispassionate manner. Ibn Taimiyya's impact on Shah Wall Allah's thought is clearly discernible in some of his writings. His discussion of kbilafa and khilafa al-Rashida in Izalat al-Khifa and Qurrat al-'Aynayn echo the ideas propounded in Ibn Taimiyya's Minhaj al-Sunnah\ while some of his discussions in Hujjat Allah al-Baligha seem inspired by Ibn Taimiyya's Fatawa.'2 Similarly, Shah Wall Allah's campaign against bid'at, emphasis on ijtihad and involvement in the political struggles of the time93 are not unrelated to Ibn Taimiyya's teaching on these questions. Makhdum Muhammad Mu'Tn Sindhl, author of Darasat al-Labib, wrote to Shah Wall Allah, seeking his opinion about some of the views of Ibn Taimiyya. Shah Wall Allah wrote in reply: My approach about all Muslim religious thinkers is that they are 'udul, that is, they possess correct faith and proper conduct. This is as the Prophet has said: 'In every age people with piety and faith will represent [interpret] the religion.' They may believe in certain things on which there may not be unanimity, but if such matters of their belief are not against the clear Qur'anic injunctions, the sunnah of the Prophet and the consensus of the community (ijma'), [criticism of them is not justified]. Our assessment of Ibn Taimiyya after full investigation is that he was a scholar of the 'Book of God' and had full command over its etymological and juristic implications. He remembered by heart the traditions of the Prophet and accounts of elders (salaf) and understood well their etymological and juristic purpose and meaning. He was a recognized scholar of syntax (nahw) and semantics (lughat). He was an authority on the Hanbalite jurisprudence and its principles and branches. He excelled in intelligence and brilliance. He argued in defence of ahl al-Sunnah with great eloquence and force. No innovation or irreligious act is reported about him. Only certain matters on which he was harassed by his contemporaries have been reported to us. But there is not a single matter on which he is without his defence based on the Qur'an and the Sunnah. So it is difficult to find a man in the whole world who possesses the qualities of Ibn Taimiyya. No one can come anywhere near him in 52 Compare, for instance: Minbaj al-Sunnah, (134-40) and Qurrat al-'Aynayn, (236-46). " See Shah Wall Allah kay Siyasi Maktubat, ed. K. A. Nizami, (Delhi, 1969).</page><page sequence="18">THE IMPACT OF 1BN TAIMIYYA ON SOUTH ASIA 137 the force of his speech and writing. People who harassed him [and got him thrown in prison] did not possess even one-tenth of his scholarly excellence ... In this matter the differences of the lulama' resemble the differences of the Companions of the Prophet and it is necessary to abstain from making any comments on such matters.'4 Shah Wall Allah then referred item by item to objections against Ibn Taimiyya—his anthropomorphic ideas, his views about visiting the tomb of the Prophet, his position vis-a-vis Qutb, Ghawth, Khizr, etc, and his assessment of the Caliph 'All—and showed that, though one might disagree, Ibn Taimiyya could not be charged with blasphemy or heresy on that account. He concluded: 'I exhort Muslims in the name of God, against maligning him as 'alim and mujtahid on such matters of difference of opinion.' This defence of Ibn Taimiyya's ideological position had an impact on contemporary religious thought in South Asia. As his seminary, Madrasab-i-RahTmya, was the hub of intellectual life in the country, ideas adumbrated there quickly flowed to wider academic circles. Shah Wall Allah's son, Shah cAbd al-'AzTz, seems to have been impressed by Ibn Taimiyya's commentary on Surat al-Niir in his Bustan al\x=req-\ Muhadditbin, but in Fatawa-i cAzTzT, he appears critical of some of his views. IMPACT OF IBN TAIMIYYA'S IDEAS ON CERTAIN REFORMIST MOVEMENTS The Fara'izT and the Mujahidln movements which arose in India during the 18th—19th centuries held certain positions inspired by the teachings of Ibn Taimiyya. Local conditions and individual preferences accentuated one or the other aspect of his thought, but in their emphasis on the doctrine of tawhtd and the spirit of jihad, these movements95 stood on the same ground as, and drew inspiration from, Ibn Taimiyya. The Fara'izT movement, whatever its genesis, came under the influence of Wahhabl ideology when its leaders went to the Hijaz and came into '* Maktubat-i Shah Walt Allah (Ahmadi Press, Delhi), 26-9. 95 During the British period—particularly soon after 1857—the word Wahhabt came to be regarded as synonymous with 'rebel' and 'mutineer'. (See W. W. Hunter, The Indian Musalmans (London, 1872). Sir Syed Ahmad Khan had to use much ingenuity to save the Wahhabl movement in India from British fury. He divested it of its political trappings and emphasized its religious objectives and ideals, particularly the spirit of ijtihad. The literature produced in South Asia during the nineteenth century on the subject of jihad provides an interesting insight into the currents and cross-currents of ideological conflict.</page><page sequence="19">i38 KHALIQ AHMAD NIZAMI contact with eminent religious figures of Arabia. Haji Shari'at Allah stayed in Arabia for 20 years (1799—1818) and received his education there. He could not but be influenced by WahhabT ideas about adherence to the montheistic ideal of Islam and stern rejection of bid'at. But the Fara'izTs professed strict adherence to the Hanafl school of law, and did not reject mysticism as a source of spiritual enlightenment.96 The views of Sayyid Ahmad Shahld (1786-1831) leader of the Mujahidln movement, are carefully collected in Sirat-i Mustaqim, compiled by Shah Muhammad Isma'Tl and Maulana 'Abd al-Hayy. It contains a powerful denunciation of bid'at, and criticises many Sufi practices. An effort to recover the true spirit of ahsan is made by laying down the basic principles of the Tartqa-i Muhammadiya, shaking off the unauthorized accretions in mystic life, and adhering to spiritual disciplines closer to the spirit of the Sunnah. Among the followers of Sayyid Ahmad Shahld were men who had received their education in the Hijaz under WahhabT scholars. Maulvi Walayat1 Ali 'Azlmabadi had learnt Hadlth with Qadi Shaukani, a well\x=req-\ known WahhabT scholar. Unlike the Fara'izTs who were deeply attached to the Hanafl school, the MujahidTn renounced taqlld. In sum, while all these reformist movements were influenced one way or another by the ideas of Ibn Taimiyya, none adopted Ibn Taimiyya's approach towards mysticism. Rather, in securing their position all adopted mystic practices of initiation (bay't), kbilafa and spiritual training. Sir Syed and rejection of taqlld Sir Syed Ahmad Khan (1817-1898) founder of the 'Muhammadan Anglo-Oriental College', 'the first modernist organization in Islam',97 later to develop into the Aligarh Muslim University, imbibed many traits of Ibn Taimiyya's thought. His Rah-i Sunnat wa Radd-i Bid'at gives an idea of his religious approach from the very beginning. He rejected taqlid9* in favour of ijtibad according to the needs of the time. He even spoke of the need for a new cilm al-kalam to meet the exigencies of the situation. He called himself an 'inveterate Wahhabi.'99 He rejected all concepts of turk-i duniya (renunciation of the world), emphasized the need of a mujtahid in every age,100 and declared fictitious and fabricated all ahadlth about the Mahdi.101 One cannot fail to discern the influence of " Al-Wasllah (Urdu trans.), 41.

Nawab Muhammad Siddtq Hasan Khan After Shah Wall Allah, the most powerful advocate of Ibn Taimiyya's ideology was Nawab Sayyid Muhammad Siddlq Hasan Khan (1832—1890),104 a veteran scholar and prolific writer from Bhopal. His teacher, Shaikh 'Abd al-Haqq Muhaddith of Benares, was a pupil of QadT ShaukanT. He strove hard to propagate Ibn Taimiyya's ideas and, moreover, to remove misunderstandings by presenting them in their proper historical perspective. His Itahaf al-Nubala,1"5 Abjad al\x=req-\ 'Ulum,106, Taqsar,107 and al-Taj al-Mukallal10S contain eloquent tributes to Ibn Taimiyya's contribution to Islamic thought. He considered him and his pupil Hafiz Ibn QayyTm as the mujaddids of the seventh century ah: The mujaddids for the seventh century are Shaikh al-Islam Ibn Taimiyya and Hafiz Ibn Qayyim. The efforts of these two elders towards reform and resurrection have no equal among the preceding or the following generations. A vast number of Islamic literary works, particularly historical and biographical, are full of references to him [Ibn Taimiyya].109 Nawab Siddlq Hasan Khan had Nu'man Alusi's Jala' al-'Aynayn published in Cairo. He strengthened the ideological prominence of Ibn Taimiyya by undertaking the publication of a number of works which either elucidated his thought or provided ideological arguments for defending his religious views. But the circumstances of Siddlq Hasan Khan's life did not admit of any application of Ibn Taimiyya's ideas in the political sphere; he concentrated his attention on rejection of taqltd, return to the Qur'an and Hadlth as sources of law, and rejection of bid'at.

Amritsar: A centre for the study of Ibn Taimiyya Almost at the same time when SiddTq Hasan Khan was busy popularizing Ibn Taimiyya's works in Bhopal, Amritsar came into prominence as another centre of studies pertaining to Ibn Taimiyya. It attracted the attention of scholars like Maulana Muhammad, Maulana 'Abd al-Jabbar, Maulana 'Abd al-Rahim, and Maulana 'Abd al-Wahid. All of them belonged to what is known as the Ghaznawi school. They established contact with the 'ulama' of Najd through some Bombay merchants and kept themselves informed of the works of the Shaikh al-Islam. They had some of them published, began to give instruction in them and generally applied themselves to the zealous propagation of Ibn Taimiyya's ideology. They evaded the element of jihad in Ibn Taimiyya's thought but stressed the importance of Hadlth in articulating the spirit of ijtihad. Maulana Nadhlr Husain Muhaddith Maulana Nadhlr Husain (d. 1902) who taught in Delhi for more than half a century, was a pupil of Shah Muhammad Ishaq, grandson of Shah 'Abd al-'AzTz, and was considered leader of the Ahl al-Hadtth in India.110 Influenced by WahhabT ideology, he nevertheless, in his attitude towards Ibn al-'Arabl, followed the tradition of Shah Wall Allah. It is difficult to say if the Ambala sedition case against him (1864—5) was based on mere suspicion as he had contact with the 'ulama' of Sadiqpur or if he had actually been involved in jihad. However, in his later years—after the Ambala case—he was mainly concerned with rejection of taqlid and recourse to Qur'an and Hadlth as primary sources of Muslim law. Significantly, all admirers of Ibn Taimiyya in India during the post\x=req-\ 1857 period presented his views purely in terms of ijtihad and said nothing about his ideas regarding jihad. Shibli on Ibn Taimiyya In 1908 Maulana Shibli (d. 1914) wrote an article in al-Nadwa under the caption: 'Allama Ibn Taimiyya HarranT as a mujaddid of his century'. He indicated three essential qualifications for a mujaddid: "° For his role in Ahl al-Hadith movement, see Muhammad Ibrahim Mir Siyalkoti, Tartkh-i Abl-i Hadlth, (Lahore, 1953), 425-35.</page><page sequence="22">THE IMPACT OF IBN TAIMIYYA ON SOUTH ASIA 141 1. He should bring about a purposeful revolution in religion, or in learning or in politics. 2. His reformist ideas should be the outcome of ijtihad, not taqlTd. 3. He should have endured physical suffering in the pursuit of his ideal. Shibli found all these qualities in Ibn Taimiyya and considered him superior to many outstanding figures in the history of Islam.111 ShiblT was the first to study Ibn Taimiyya's political role. This was a departure from the trend represented by Sir Syed, Nawab Siddlq Hasan, and Maulana Nadhlr Husain who had presented Ibn Taimiyya primarily as a religious reformer. Shibli wished to include Ibn Tai\x=req-\ miyya in his Heroes of Islam Series but was unable to undertake further work on him. Influence on Maulana Azad Emphasis on Hadlth studies and rejection of taqltd continued to be considered the only aims of Ibn Taimiyya's movement until Maulana Abul Kalam Azad (1888—1958) appeared on the Indian intellectual scene and looked to Ibn Taimiyya for inspiration to restore to the Muslims in India the mettle necessary for a struggle against foreign domination. Perhaps no Indian scholar understood the role of Ibn Taimiyya in the history of Islam with such clarity and conviction as did Maulana Azad. In his struggle against British rule, he drew inspiration from Ibn Taimiyya who had guided the Muslims of his day when political power had passed out of their hands. Apart from his own independent study of Ibn Taimiyya's works, Maulana Azad's contact with the AlusT family of Baghdad, whose advocacy of Ibn Taimiyya's ideology was of long standing, confirmed him in his views. Nu'man al-Alus! (d. 1899) had written, Jala' al-'Aynayn111 which defends Ibn Taimiyya against charges of unorthodoxy.113 Besides, Shaikh Shihab al-Dln Mahmud AlusT's tafsir, Riih al-Ma'am, bore the unmistakable imprint of Ibn Taimiyya's views. Maulana Azad's father, Maulana Khair al-Dln had criticised Shaikh AlusT for his views and written a critique of his commentary. He particularly criticised AlusT's denial (following Ibn Taimiyya) of the existence of the Prophet Khizr. Maulana Azad abandoned his father's 111 Maqalat-i Sbibh, v, 62-76. 112 Cairo, 1298/1880-81. 113 Albert Hourani considers it 'a sign of the influence which such ideas were now beginning to exercise over educated Muslims of different traditions.'

This surprised even the Alusis,114 and established Maulana Azad as an independent thinker unfettered by family traditions. Ibn Taimiyya's influence on Maulana Azad was not confined to explicitly religious matters. Azad considered Ibn Taimiyya's diagnosis of the social and political ills of Muslim society very relevant to the situation prevailing in his day. Anxious to organize the Muslims, he cited Ibn Taimiyya as his ideal and urged the need for an imam to organize the community. His life during internment at Ranchi resembled, as Maulana Sayyid Sulaiman NadwT remarked, that of Ibn Taimiyya and Ibn Qayylm.115 Addressing a meeting of the culama\ Azad said that what Ibn Taimiyya had done when the Muslim society was faced with the problem of resurrecting the structure of Islamic institu\x=req-\ tions—political, religious and cultural—provided a model for modern times. He remarked: The first thing that the 'ulama' of those times did was to appoint Muslim deputies over the territories which the Mongols had occupied, with the purpose of organizing the community and establishing the Sbart'a law ... Shaikh-al\x=req-\ Islam Ibn Taimiyya gave a fatwa about the areas under Mongol control that the Muslims of those lands should not accept that change and should not for a moment live without an imamS16 Maulana Azad strove for some years to popularise the idea of an imam as the centre of community life. He established Dar al-lrshad as a nursery for training people in those ideals. He founded an organization known as Hizb Allah, based on this concept of imamate. In Tadhkirah, published in 1919, he drew a lively, vibrant picture of Ibn Taimiyya, focused on the man's sincerity and determination to revive Muslim society regardless of the opposition and hardship that he had to face117 Maulana Azad's bold acceptance of Ibn Taimiyya's ideological position dispelled many misunderstandings about Ibn Taimiyya and a new phase began in the intellectual history of Muslim India characterized by close study and numerous translations of his works in Urdu. Azad himself translated al-Wasiyat al-Kubra into Urdu,118 and, under his influence, Ghulam Rasul Mehr, 'Abd al-Majld Salik and 'Abd al-Razzaq MallhabadT became ardent admirers of Ibn Taimiyya and propagated his views through their journals, magazines and newspapers. 114 Abul Kalam Azad, Karawatt-i Khayal (Bijnor, 1946), 77. 113 Ma'arif, March 1919. 116 Presidential Address, Jamiat al-'Ulama', Lahore Session, (1921). 117 Tadhkirab (Lahore, 1919), 158. 118 Lahore, 1947.</page><page sequence="24">THE IMPACT OF IBN TAIMIYYA ON SOUTH ASIA 143 Iqbal's assessment of Ibn Taimiyya's legal and philosophic concepts If Azad looked to Ibn Taimiyya for the revitalization of Muslim community and its political prestige, Iqbal (d. 1938) looked to him for a reconstruction of Muslim religious thought inspired by a revived spirit of ijtihad. He assessed Ibn Taimiyya's role from different angles, philosophic, legal, and reformist. Systematic refutation of Greek logic, Iqbal argued, was really undertaken by IshraqI and Ibn Taimiyya, and he drew attention to the latter's Refutation of Logic, in which induction is described as 'the only form of reliable argument'.119 Referring to the destruction of Baghdad, the centre of Muslim intellectual life in the middle of the thirteenth century, and the tendency for false reverence for past history, Iqbal said: The tendency of over-organization by a false reverence of the past as manifested in the legists of Islam in the thirteenth century and later, was contrary to the inner impulse of Islam and consequently invoked the powerful reaction of Ibn-i Taimiyya, one of the most indefatigable writers and preachers of Islam ...12° Iqbal referred approvingly to Ibn Taimiyya's revolt against the finality of the schools of law and supported his attempt to go back to first principles in order to make a fresh start. Ibn Taimiyya rejected, writes Iqbal, the Hanafl principle of reasoning by analogy and ijma1 (consensus) as understood by the older legists, for 'he thought agreement was the basis of all superstition.'121 Iqbal came to the conclusion that 'considering the moral and intellectual decrepitude of his times, he was right in doing so.' Iqbal saw the Wahhabl movement in the context of the impact of Ibn Taimiyya's ideas. He wrote: ... the spirit of Ibn-i Taimiyya's teaching found a fuller expession in a movement of immense potentialities which arose in the eighteenth century, from the sand of Nejd, described by MacDonald as the 'cleanest spot in the decadent world of Islam'. It is really the first throb of life in modern Islam. In Islam and Ahmadism Iqbal refers to Ibn Taimiyya as a critic of 'mullah rigidity.'122 He looked upon 'mullah-ism', which would not allow any freedom of ijtihad, as the real cause of Muslim stagnation and remarked: The Wahhabl movement which was a source of inspiration to the 19th century Muslim reformers was really a revolt against the rigidity of the 'ulama'.113 Reconstruction of Religious Thought in Islam (Lahore, 1944), 129. 120 ibid., 151-2. 121 ibid. 122 'Islam and Ahmadism', Islam (Lahore, 22 January, 1936) vol.

The two approaches, though not divergent or conflicting, were never combined in the larger framework of any movement for the regeneration of Muslim society. Maulana Azad gave up his efforts to establish the authority of an imam-, Iqbal's ideas about ijtibad, though understood by few, were acted upon by none. Impact on scholars of Nadwa From the early twentieth century, as we have noted, a number of'ulama' became interested in the works of Ibn Taimiyya and Ibn QayyTm. Nawab Siddiq Hasan Khan, Maulana Shibll, and Maulana Abul Kalam Azad were largely responsible for creating this interest. Maulana Sayyid Sulaiman NadwT recalled that when he got hold of the works of Ibn Taimiyya and Ibn QayyTm, 'every other impression disappeared from his heart' and 'every other colour completely faded away'.124 As Director of the Shibll Academy, he was able to enthuse his pupils with admiration for the works of Ibn Taimiyya. Maulana Sayyid 'Abd al-'All, Nazim of Nadwat al-'Ulama', zealous for the works of Ibn Taimiya and Ibn QayyTm, repeatedly urged his younger brother, Maulana Abul Hasan AlT, to study them closely.125 Another teacher at Nadwa, Maulana Shah HalTm cAta, appreciated especially the clear, cogent and powerful exposition of Islamic monotheism in the writings of Ibn Taimiyya and Ibn QayyTm. He particularly admired Ibn Taimiyya's Madarij al-Saliktn, al-Jawab al-Kafi, Zad al\x=req-\ Ma'ad, and 'Ida al-Sabirin. Excepting Ibn Taimiyya's views about Ahl al-Bait, as expressed in Minhaj al-Sunnab,126 he upheld the Imam's arguments in almost every other respect. He would advise his students that if anybody had not the time to read all the works of Ibn Taimiyya, he should at least study his Fatawa and Majmu'at al-Kasa'il which contain the essence of his thought.127 Maulana Abul Hasan 'AlT NadwT regards Ibn Taimiyya's Tafsir Surat al-Nur and Ibn Qayyim's Jawab al-Kafi as the best guides for young minds.128 In 1957 he wrote a comprehensive account of Ibn Taimiyya in his Tankb-i Da^wat wacA^Jmat,119 stressing his efforts to revive the religious zeal of the community. He propagated Ibn Taimiyya's 124 Mashahir Ahl-i 'llm ki Mohsin Kitabain, ed.

Deoband and Ibn Taimiyya The early scholars of Deoband—Maulana Muhammad Qasim Nanau\x=req-\ tawT (d. 1880) and others—did not envince any interest in Ibn Taimiyya's teachings. Interest in them began only with Maulana Anwar Shah Kashmiri (d. 1933),130 who studied very carefully the works of Ibn Taimiyya and Ibn QayyTm. Assisted by a prodigious memory, he would cite passage after passage while discoursing on the works of Ibn Taimiyya. He passed on to his pupils131 his own enthusiasm for and commitment to Ibn Taimiyya. This is evident in the works for example, of Maulana Muhammad Manzoor Nu'manI (editor al-Furqan), Maula\x=req-\ na Sa'id Ahmad Akbarabadl (editor Burban) and others. Anwar Shah quoted in his writings from Ibn Taimiyya's al-Jawab al-SahJh and SarJm al-Maslul'ala Shatim al-Rasiil and paid tribute to him as a mountain of knowledge (jabal al-'iltn). He was, however, critical of some of the views of Ibn Taimiyya. Among others, Maulana Khalll Ahmad of Saharanpur and Maulana Shabblr Ahmad UthmanT, while not hesitating to refer to Ibn Taimiyya and Ibn Qayylm, did not commit themselves to their ideology. Maulana Ashraf All Thanwl expressed his disagreement with Ibn Taimiyya in moderate, polite language, refraining from entering into open rebuttal of his views. Maulana Husain Ahmad MadanI made no secret of his disagreement with the views of Ibn Taimiyya. Maulana Manazir Ahsan GilanI, an alumnus of Deoband, who later chaired the Department of Theology at the Osmania University of Hyderabad, was also sceptical of Ibn Taimiyya's views. His article, Ibn Taimiyya ka Nazariya-i Makbdumi\x=req-\ yat132 is a critique of Ibn Taimiyya's al-Nabuwwat.133 LITERATURE IN URDU A number of Ibn Taimiyya's books and brochures were translated into Urdu and published from Lahore, Calcutta, Lyalpur and other places by 130 For his life, see: Muhammad Rizwan Allah, Maulana Anwar Shah Kashmiri (Aligarh, 1974); Muhammad Azhar Shah, Hayat-i Anwar (Delhi, 1955); 'Abd al-Rahman Kondo, Al-Nur (Delhi, 1979). 131 e.g. Maulana Sa'Td Ahmad Akbarabadl.

Similarly, some of the works of Ibn Qayyim, who was regarded as an exponent of Ibn Taimiyya's thought, were also translated into Urdu. His Shifa' al-'Altl was translated into Urdu and published by Maulwi Karim Bakhsh of Lahore under the title Kitab al-Taqdtr (no date). A well-known Urdu scholar who popularized Ibn Taimiyya's views and highlighted his role in the history of Islam was Maulana Akbar Shah Khan Najlbabadl.134 The first comprehensive biography of Ibn Taimiyya in Urdu, published by Afzal al-'Ulama'Muhammad Yusuf Kokan 'Umari from Madras in 1959, has helped to make possible a clearer appraisal of Ibn Taimiyya's role in Islamic history. Maulana Abu al-'Ala' al-Mawdudl, who wrote prolifically in Urdu on different aspects of religion and polity, was influenced by Ibn Taimiyya's approach in his interpretation of Islamic history, rejection of taqlid, bridging the gulf between religion and politics and in his criticism of the Sufi ways of life. However, he did not, in general, explicitly indicate the sources of his inspiration. Certain sections of culamay and mashaikh were bitterly critical of Ibn 134 e.g. see his A'ina-i Haqiqat Numa (Hamdard Press, Delhi, n.d.), ii.</page><page sequence="28">THE IMPACT OF IBN TAIMIYYA ON SOUTH ASIA 147 Taimiyya's views about mysticism and taqlid,lis but their polemical writings have had only limited influence. THE NATURE OF IBN TAIMIYYA'S IMPACT IN SOUTH ASIA In South Asia Ibn Taimiyya's influence can be distinguished in six distinct spheres: (a) as a model for the resurrection of Muslim society (ihya-i millat); (b) as an organizer of jihad movement against the Mongols; (c) as an advocate of ijtihad, (fresh interpretation of Islamic law); (d) as a critic of bid'at (innovations in different spheres of Muslim life); (e) as a critic of the Sufis in general, and (f) as a critic of Ibn al-'ArabT. South Asia accepted Ibn Taimiyya's role as a reformer, as an advocate of ijtihad, as an uncompromising monotheist, as a critic of bid'at and as an inspiration in the struggle against foreign political domination. However, his views were diversely adopted and emphasized according to the needs of the period. Excepting the rule of Muhammad bin Tughluq, it did not prove possible to apply the whole of Ibn Taimiyya's thought at any other period. It was as a reformer and critic of bid'at that Ibn Taimiyya's impact was most deeply felt in South Asia. Hardly any Muslim reform movement arose in India that did not owe some inspiration to him in its struggle against unauthorized accretions in Muslim society. Ibn Taimiyya's ideas played an important role in the political sphere during the 14th, 19th, and the early 20th centuries. Muhammad bin Tughluq adopted his views as his political ideology; the Fara'izT, the Wahhabl and the Mujahidln movements imbibed the spirit of jihad from him, directly or indirectly. Maulana Azad was inspired by him in his struggle for independence from British rule. He sought to revitalise Muslim society by creating an effective organisational structure under an imam, as advocated by Ibn Taimiyya. Ibn Taimiyya's criticism of Ibn Al-'Arabl's wahdat al-wujud, was echoed in Shaikh Ahmad SirhindT's approach towards pantheistic tendencies.136 Shah Wall Allah of Delhi, who always strongly defended Ibn Taimiyya against all types of criticism, was, however, conciliatory in 133 e.g. see Shams al-DTn Afghani's al-Jawahir al-Bahhiya, a commentary on Shark 'Aqaid al-Nasaft. 13' See Burhan Ahmad Faruql, The Mujaddid's Conception ofTawhid (Lahore, 1940).</page><page sequence="29">148 KHAL1Q AHMAD NIZAMI this matter. His Risala ft Tahqiq Wahdat al-Wujud (also known as al\x=req-\ Maktub al-Madani) gave a new orientation to mystical thought in South Asia. Following the guidance of his teacher, Shaikh Abu Tahir Kurdi of Madina, Shah Wall Allah made the reformist programme of Ibn Taimiyya co-exist with Ibn al-'Arabl's ideology. As a result even those who subscribed to Ibn Taimiyya's thought in other spheres, accepted Ibn al-'Arabl's lead in spiritual matters. Ibn Taimiyya had written about innumerable problems pertaining to the religious, social, and political life of the contemporary Muslims. A reformer working in such a vast orbit could not help touching many sensitive areas and provoking many controversies. Obviously some of the controversies were of a temporary nature and of lesser significance, but the opposition they aroused clouded clear appreciation of his reformist role in the broader framework of Islamic history and the dynamic elements in his thought were not understood. The ideology of Ibn Taimiyya vis-a-vis mysticism was restated in South Asia. However, none of its supporters—Shaikh Ahmad SirhindT Mujaddid Alf-i ThanT, Shah Wall Allah, the Fara'izTs, the Mujahidln, Nawab SiddTq Hasan Khan, the schools of Nadwa and Deoband—were able to dispense with mystic thought or institutions. In fact, they saw in the revitalization of mystic life the seeds of regeneration for the millat. Nevertheless, some significant steps were taken to meet the objections of Ibn Taimiyya. (1) Sufis who did not conform to the SharT'a were severely condemned by Shaikh Ahmad SirhindT137 and Shah Wall Allah.138 (2) The mystic movement was presented as an elaboration of the spirit of ahsan as explained by the Prophet. (3) Ibn Taimiyya had categorised Sufis as Auliya Allah (Helpers of God) or Auliya Shaitan (Helpers of the Devil). Careful scrutiny of the attitudes and behaviour of the eminent auliya in South Asia of various affiliations reveals that Ibn Taimiyya's criticism was not applicable to them. They adhered to SharT'a norms, discouraged ruhbaniyat (asceticism), did not publicly discuss wahdat al~ wujud, and upheld the sunnah of the Prophet. The delinquent Sufis, who had provoked Ibn Taimiyya's criticism were never taken seriously by the Muslim people—as is evident from the fate of Ahmad Bihari, Mas'ud Bak, Sarmad, and others. (4) A readjustment and distinction of this type had taken place earlier in Muslim lands during the time of Ibn Taimiyya himself. Malik AsTr Qaladun, an admirer of Ibn Taimiyya, did not abjure contact with the mystics139 but continued his affiliation with the mystic 137 Maktubat-i Imam-i Kabbani (Nawal Kishore, 1877). He writes in his Wasiyat Nama, (Masihi Press of Masih al-Zaman, Kanpur, n.d.), p. 3: 'Don't give your hand in the hand of the mystics of this age as they are involved in variety of bid'at.' 13' See Maqrizi, al-Khaltat wa 'l-Athar (Beirut, n.d.), ii, 422.</page><page sequence="30">THE IMPACT OF IBN TAIMIYYA ON SOUTH ASIA 149 order. (5) Perhaps the most significant development in this connection was the line adopted by Nawab SiddTq Hasan Khan who took bold and sincere initiatives to propagate Ibn Taimiyya's thought in South Asia. He invested Ibn Taimiyya with mystic attributes,140 suggested that there was some identity of view between Ibn Taimiyya and Shaikh Nizam al-Dln Auliya141 and quoted a verse about the need of practicing ijtihad that Shaikh Nizam al-Dln Auliya used to recite before his audience, whose meaning in English may be rendered as: 'Though God alone provides religious guidance, yet one should also exercise ijtihad.'1*1 With these adjustments to the different circumstances and religious sensibilities of the Muslims in India borne in mind, we may say that Ibn Taimiyya's ideas have made a deep and far-reaching impression on religious and political developments in South Asia. 140 Taqsar Juyud al-Ahrar mitt Tadhkar-i ]anud al-Abrar, (Bhopal, ah 1298), wherein he observes about Ibn Taimiyya: 'His rank in spiritual discipline was very high. Stories about his miracles and traditions relating to his spiritual blessing are without limit.' 141 ibid., 136. 142 ibid., 67.</page></plain_text>
