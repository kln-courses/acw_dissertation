<plain_text><page sequence="1">Gentile Organization of the Apaches of Arizona. I I NOTES UPON THE GENTILE ORGANIZATION OF THE APACHES OF ARIZONA. THE identity of the Apache and Navajo languages is a fact too well known to need more than mention: the two tribes, although at the present time under perfectly independent governments, are still to some extent intermarried, and there exists occasionally a brisk trade in the blankets and other textile work of the Navajos. For at least a decade after the annexation of New Mexico to the United States the Navajos were classed as the "Apache-Navajo," but of late years the segregation has become more and more complete. The first question which presents itself after hearing read the list of the gentes of the one tribe is, how many of the names given can be detected in the other. The following, obtained with great care from prominent and reliable Apache medicine-men and others, and checked and corrected at every possible opportunity, is believed to be as accurate as such a list can be made. Different authorities were asked at various times and in various places to supply all they knew upon the subject, and after the lists thus obtained had been harmonized, members of the tribe were always required to give the name of the particular gens to which they belonged. The first list of the Apache gentes was derived from "Dick," "Tanoli," Eskiminzin, "Eskinospus," and others, at San Carlos Agency and Fort Apache, Arizona, in October, I88I, and October, 1882. i. Satchin, Red Rock,1 2. Destchin, Red Clay or Red Paint. 3. Tzeskadin, The Fallen Cottonwood. 4. Tuakay, Salt, or Salt Springs. 5. Tzolgan, White Mountain. 6. Klokadakaydn, Carrizo, or Arrow Reed. 7. Tzintzilchutzikadn, Acorn. 8. Tzlanapah, Big Band. Also translated Plenty of Water. 9. Tudisishn, Black Water. 10. I-ya-aye, Sun Flower (see 24). ii. Indelchidnti. Pine. 12. Ki-ya-jani, Alkali. I3. Akonye, People of the Caflon. 14. Kaynaguntl, People at Mouth of Cafion. 1 The orthography employed when notes were first taken among the Apaches in I869 and succeeding years was that which gave to each letter the phonetic values of the elements of the Spanish language; it has never been changed. The interpreters who have aided me during the past twenty-one years are, " Con- cepcion," " Severiano," " Josd Maria," "Antonio Besias," " Montoya," Al.

A very considerable body of the Apache-Navajo tribe, called the Tontos (Fools), said by tradition to have been the first to force a way down below the Little Colorado, and to have considerably inter- married with the people of Pueblo characteristics whom they found in the newly conquered region, used to possess the country from the San Francisco Mountain to the Gila River, but since their complete subjection by General Crook, in 1873, have been peaceably farming at the San Carlos. Patchin, one of their principal chiefs, dictated the following list of gentes:- 1. Destchetinaye, 2. Chisnedinadinaye, 3. Yagoyecayn, 4. Klugaducayn, 5. Tit-sessinaye, 6. Tutzose, 7. Tutsoshin, 8.

II2</page><page sequence="3">Gentile Organization of the Apaches of Arizona. 113 The spelling varies from that of the Apache dialect proper, be- cause the Tontos pronounced differently. The renewal of a more intimate association with the other divisions of the Apache family at San Carlos is, however, rapidly assimilating the several dialects into a homogeneous tongue. The Tontos are now careful to speak the Apache language correctly, but numbers of them still possess a fluent knowledge of the Mojave, as, for example, Patchin himself, who had the second name, this time in the Mojave tongue, of " Pula- sava-trapa," or "White-spotted Forehead." Chimahuevi-Sal, an Indian of the Chimahuevi tribe, who had risen to the chief position among the Apache-Yumas, another of the bands, massed on the San Carlos, was very reluctant to speak about their gentes, although he at last admitted that there were four (4), each getting its designation from the locality in which it had once sided. These are : i. Cuatha-towaya, Yellow-faced Mountain. 2. Huatafeva, (Not translated.) 3. Yocaloca, Crooked Willow. 4. Harcuva, Last Water. Lest the names, Apache-Yumas and Apache-Mojaves, may prove misleading, I will here say that I was assured on the present and on many other occasions that they were in no way different from the Yumas and Mojaves respectively, except in living the life of nomads in the mountains instead of cultivating the soil in the Colorado valley. They speak a language entirely different from that of the Apaches, but having essentially the same manners and customs, and being in- spired with an equally fierce hostility towards the whites, were gen- erally classed in military reports among the Apaches. My informants from this tribe were "Mirija" (Thin), "Macua" (Quail), "Pit" (Round), "Piquedokesilt " (Turk's-head Cactus), " Chiquito-je" (Little Hairy Man), " Huanatzeco" (some kind of a plant), "Jime-hual-paimi " (No Calves to his Legs), and "Pay-kule" (The Tall Man), all chiefs of respectability, and very reliable per- sons. Their clans, they said, were:-- I. Tutaclacua, Walnut. 2. Ha-caruya, Warm Springs. 3. Itashacovat6, Cottonwood. 4, Pial-nucho-pa, Mescal. 5. I-aji-sush-chulva, Stick in Water. 6. Aja-cuhuifa-huifia, Willow Thicket. 7. Aja-kay-kiopa, Aspen. 8. Cuadracamd, White grass Plain. Introducing a comparison first between the Apaches and Tontos,</page><page sequence="4">yournal of American Folk-Lore. and then between the Apaches and Navajos, because all these are of one blood and language, and excluding the Yumas and Mojaves for the reason that they pertain to a different stock, we see that the Apache gentes numbered respectively 6, 19, 25, 26, 28, and 30 agree with those of the Tontos marked respectively 4, 12, II, I, and 5 (these two Tonto gentes seem to be fragments of the one gens), 8 and 2. An examination of the list submitted by Surgeon Matthews, allow- ing for difference in orthography, will show that Navajo No. 3 is the Apache 25; Navajo 6 seems to be Apache 27; Navajo 15 is Apache 19 and Tonto 12; Navajo 17 is Apache i and 2; Navajo Io is Apache 25 and Tonto II; Navajo II may be Apache 27; Navajo 32 the Apache 12; Navajo 26 seems to be Apache 4; Navajo 32 is apparently Apache 22; Navajo 50 suggests Apache 27 ; Na- vajo 39 is Apache 29 and Tonto 6; Navajo 23 is beyond question Apache 9; Navajo 31 may be Apache 13 ; Navajo 28 is undoubtedly Apache 3. The Apaches have also among them Tze-kinne, or Stone-house People, descendants of the Cliff-dwelling S6baypuris, whom they drove out of Aravypa Cafion and forced to flee to the Pimas for refuge about a century ago; and also Nakaydi, or descendants of Mexican captives. This word Nakaydi contains the radicle " kay," white; but the meaning has no reference to color at all, but, as I was assured, refers to the Mexican mode of walking with the toes turned out. This is certainly a most encouraging parallelism, when it is known that these two great arms of a bellicose family have been conquer- ing and absorbing in two different directions, -the Navajos among the Zufiis, Rio Grande Pueblos, and Jemez People to the east; and the Apaches among Pimas, Mojaves, and tribes closely affiliated to the Mexicans, to the south. This matter of absorption is well understood among the Indians themselves. I have had, from the Pueblos of San Juan, San Ildefonso, Santa Clara, Santana, Zia, Jemez, and San Felipe, narrations of events, in their struggle to escape the Spanish yoke in I680, that were almost historically accurate. I have had from Pedro Pino, and other head men of the Zufis, statements showing that they well knew that whole villages had thrown themselves into the arms of the fierce and cruel Apache-Navajo to escape the arms of the fiercer and more cruel Caucasian. In my journal of November 24, I88I, I find this statement: "The Zufis know that the Navajos have among them clans known as the Jemez People, Pueblos, and Zufii People, and in speaking of the last say that they once formed the bulk of the Maiz or Corn gens of their own tribe. Some little communi- cation is still kept up with them, and many of these Navajos still II4</page><page sequence="5">Gentile Organization of the Afpaches of Arizona. I 15 retain the language of the mother tribe. They are counted among the best blanket-makers and artisans of the Navajos." Almost the same story was told me by the people of the Laguna Pueblo in October, I881. I also recall that during my visits to Zuni, whenever any great religious festival was to be celebrated, parties of Navajos, but not of other tribes, were sure to be on hand and to be treated with every consideration. Mr. Frank Cushing should be able to impart much information on this point. CHIRICAHUA APACHES. The Chiricahuas have for so long a time been separated from the rest of the Apaches that I did not expect much success from my in- vestigations upon the subject of their gentile divisions; for twenty- five years they had been blood-thirsty outlaws, plundering and defy- ing two nations, and apparently indifferent to all obligations of law and order. Yet when General Crook led his bold expedition into the heart of the Sierra Madre, Mexico, in 1883, and surprised the stronghold of " Chato " and "Geronimo," I was fortunate enough to be able to impress upon the prisoners, especially the women and children, that it was necessary to know what clan they belonged to, in order the more readily to distribute rations each day. The result was, I soon ascertained that there were four principal clans and one very small one. At the first examination, made before a great num- ber had surrendered, sixty-four (64) gave in their names as Chokonni, or Juniper. (2.) Three (3) as Iya-aye. (3.) Four (4) as Chi-6, or Red Paint People. (4.) Eleven (Ii) as Tidendaye, or Nindahe. (5.) And eight (8) as Nadohotzosn. In the same manner I learned from later arrivals that the great majority of the Chiricahuas were almost evenly divided between Chokonni and Chi-e, the remarkable thing being the youngest chil- dren seemed to be able to tell their lineage, although this is a topic that the adult Indian is generally disinclined to explain or discuss. Gens No. I of the Chiricahuas is the same as No. 31 of the Apaches proper, although a material divergence in the pronunciation is observable. No. 2 is the Apache No. 10. No. 3 is the Apache No. 2 (Dest-chi = Red Clay). No. 4 is a word meaning " Strangers," - the descendants of Mex- icans and of Indians, most probably Opatas, with whom at intervals in the past the Chiricahuas lived on terms of peace at Basaraca, Ba- vispe, and Janos. It is essentially the same clan as the Nakaydi of Apaches and Navajos.</page><page sequence="6">Ii6 7ournal of American Folk-Lore. No. 5 seems to be the Apache No. 28. Before going farther, let me write down the list of the gentes of the tribes living near the Apaches. Those of the Moquis, as ob- tained by myself, are :-- I. Parrot. 9. Badger. 17. Tobacco. 2. Cottonwood. IO. Butterfly. I8. Cotton Tail Rabbit. 3. Macaw. II. Coyote. 19. Blue Seed Grass (Gra- 4. Corn. 12. Skeleton. ma). 5. Frog. 13. Bear. 20. Bunch Grass. 6. Turkey. I4. Hemlock. 21. Deer. 7.

The other pueblos of New Mexico and one in Texas, which were all visited by me in I88I and 1882, furnished lists of gentes closely similar to those of the Moquis and Zunis, which approach those of the Plains tribes in the frequency of the occurrence of Animal Titles.2 Thus in the Moqui list, out of a total of twenty-three gentes, we have fourteen Animal, eight Plant, and one Natural Element (Fire) 1 See Snake Dance of the Moquis, p. 336, London and New York, I884. 2 The gentile organization of the various Pueblos in the valleys of the Rio Grande, the Puerco, and the Jemez rivers is arranged on one and the same prin- ciple. A few examples may prove instructive. PUEBLO OF SAN FELIPE. This pueblo had at one time, so my Indian guides Laguna and Acoma. I. Eagle. 7. Turkey. 2. Sun (almost extinct). 8. Coyote. 3. Water. 9.

The Zufis, out of a total of fourteen, give eight Animal, four Plant, and two Natural Element (Fire and Water) Titles. On the other hand, in the total of more than fifty gentes of the Navajos collected and analyzed by Surgeon Matthews,- a list which, although larger, agrees very closely with one obtained by my- self at Fort Defiance, Arizona, in May, I881, and may be accepted as perfectly accurate, - there is not a single animal title. We must understand that the Deer Spring People are not the Deer People, and we can hardly consider in this connection the clan known as the "Many Goats," since these domestic animals, together with sheep, cows, horses, and donkeys, the peach, apricot, and cherry, the wheeled wagon and the crude plow, were first introduced to the Indians of New Mexico by the Franciscan missionaries (A.

There were found representatives of two distinct Coyote gentes; a husband, who called himself a Coyote del Sol, and his wife, who was a Coyote del Chamisa (Sage Brush), the Coyote Clan of the ruined pueblo of Cicuye, or Pecos, amalga- mated with Jemez, and so called for distinction. For the frequent if not invariable use of Animal Titles for the Gentes of our Plains Indians, Australians, etc., see Frazer's Totemism, Morgan's Ancient Society, Andrew Lang's Myth and Ritual, and the works of Herbert Spencer, W. Robert- son Smith, and others. 1 Informant could not give the Spanish names.</page><page sequence="8">journal of American Folk-Lore. 1650). Of all the gentes obtained from Apaches, Apache-Yumas, Apache-Mojaves, Tontos, and Chiricahuas, let it be observed that only one - the "Tush-tun," or Dragon Fly - can be, in any sense, considered an Animal Title. Of the Plant Titles, which upon super ficial view are plenty enough, few, I am prepared to assert, would stand the test of a severe philological examination. Take, for ex. ample, numbers 7 and 17, translated briefly as Acorn and Mescal respectively, but which should be translated " The place of Acorns " and "The place of Mescal." Again, number I9, Kay-jatin, or Willow, should be translated, "The pass or trail through the Willows." In one word, the entire nomenclature of the Apache and Navajo Gentile System is locative or topographical. These people were no- mads of nomads, and as such more likely to designate the subdivi- sions of the tribe by peculiarities of the habitat of each.' The Apaches never emblazoned totems upon their shields, but the Zufiis were careful to do so.2 At first my mind was oppressed with doubt as to whether or not I had discovered a list of Apache gentes or a list of Apache bands; these chilling doubts disappeared under the bright light of increasing knowledge. The Apache of the Dest-chin, or any other clan, cannot marry in his own clan: he must marry a Ki-ya-hanni girl, or some one not related to him. His children will belong to the clan of the mother, which really has more power over them than he has himself. He will, however, always remain, as he was before his marriage, a Dest- chin, and when he dies the members of that clan will bury him. Polygamy is the nuptial law, but it is not without certain restric- tions. A man will marry his wife's younger sisters as fast as they grow to maturity, or, if his first wife have no sisters, then he will try to marry in the same clan, because, as my informants assured me, there will be less danger of the women fighting. A man marries his brother's widow (he must exercise this right within a year, or the woman is free to marry whom and when she pleases). If the widow be not married, as she has had a right to ex- pect, then she is at liberty to look around for a mate, and the general 1 "The great Chippewyan family in the North, we are well assured, have them (totems) not." Tanner's Narrative, New York, 1830, p. I3. 2 Frazer shows that " while totemism as a religion tends to pass into the wor- ship first of animal gods, and next of anthropomorphic gods with animal attributes, totem clans tend, under the same social conditions, to pass into local clans. Amongst the Kurnai, shut in between the mountains and the sea, phratries and clans have been replaced by exogamous local groups, which generally take their name from the districts. . . . The Coast Murring tribe in New South Wales has also substituted exogamous local groups for kinship divisions." Totemism, J. G. Frazer, M. A., Edinburgh, I887, p. 90. II8</page><page sequence="9">Gentile Organization of the Apaches of Arizona. II 9 practice is for her to intimate her affection in the following manner: she studies the patterns in which the adored one is wont to paint his face, and imitates them closely, changing as he changes, etc. Should a stranger step in and marry the widow before the expiration of the allotted time, the aggrieved party has a right to demand an indem- nity to the value of the goods which his brother gave for the woman; but no such claim can be set up where the offender belongs to the same clan, because all members of the same clan are brothers. When on the war-path, the clans camp together, and go into an engagement together. I had especially good opportunities for learn- ing this on General Crook's expedition to the Sierra Madre, where a larger number of Apache warriors were combined than ever before or since.1 There is blood composition for murder; the relatives, the clansmen of the murdered party, must be satisfied. In addition to this system of clans, the Apaches have bands, well defined and easily recognized, - the Gilenos, Pinals, Sierra Blancas, and so on. Whenever an Apache prisoner was asked to name his people, he invariably gave one of the names on this list; indeed, when one Apache meets another, his first question is not "What is your name ?" but " What is your people ? " 2 When a Navajo comes over to the Apache country to sell blankets, people of his own clan, if any there be, take care of him; to this rule we must expect many exceptions, the Apaches resembling ourselves in sometimes having friends who are more congenial than relations. When Pa-na-o-tishn (" The Coyote saw him ") escaped from the Chiricahuas (in March, 1883) he told our Apache scouts that he was 1 Mixtecs " Sacaban para la Guerra la gente por barrios i la guiaban los Capi- tanes." Herrera, Dec. III. Lib. iii. p. Ioo. (The people went forth to war by wards (clans), commanded by their captains.) 2 According to Kingsborough, the Aztecs were very proud of their lineage, and when meeting each other were in the habit of saying, "I am of such and such a lineage " (see AIexican Antiquities, vol. vi. p. 173). If a stranger enter an Indian village, "when his lineage is known to the people (by a stated custom they are slow in greeting one another), his relation - if he has any, these greet him in a familiar way- invites him home, and treats him as his kinsman." Adair, Hist. Am. Inds., p. I8. " Dizen los indios son los de un nombre deudos y tratan por tales y por esso quando viene alguno en parte no conocido y necesitado, luego acude el nombre y si ay quien luego con todo claridad se reciben y tratan y assi ninguna mujer e hombre se casava con otro del mesmo nombre, porque era i ellos gran infamia." Landa, Cosas de Yucatan, Brasseur de Bourbourg, Paris, 1864, p. 136. Morgan says that the Mohawk of the Wolf tribe recognized the Seneca of the Wolf tribe as his brother, and they were bound to each other by the ties of consanguinity. In like manner, the Oneida of the Turtle or other tribe received the Cayuga or Onondaga of the same tribe as a brother, and with a fraternal welcome." Morgan's League of the Iroquois, New York, 185I, p. 51.</page><page sequence="10">7ournal of American Folk-Lore. a Dest-chin, -Alchise and others of the Satchin who were present took him in charge, because they said that they and the Dest-chin were almost the one people, - in other words, that they formed a phratry. The investigation into phratric affinities, however, was not prosecuted, on account of the scattered manner of living of this people. Surgeon Matthews's opinion that the gentes were until quite re- cently "local exogamous groups" is entitled to respectful consider- ation. The earlier rule would seem to have been that each chief governed a gens which kept together in its hunting, farming, raiding, amusements, and medicine dances. Later on, for various reasons, outsiders were allowed to attach themselves to the gens and become quasi-adopted, to the extent, at least, that they married outside, and they married exogamously, for the very good reason that, women being the beasts of burden, exogamy provided additional beasts of burden, -as well as interpreters to carry on conferences with bands whose dialects might be drifting into new languages,- and spies familiar with sections of country into which it might become a mili- tary necessity to send raiding parties. From being strictly topographical, these designations could, in the course of a comparatively brief period, undergo a peculiar modifica- tion. For example, The People who lived near the Pass through the Willows, would become the Willow Pass People, and the Willow People. In the same manner, the Band who lived near the Bear Dens, the Wolf Pass, or the Deer Spring, would insensibly find themselves alluded to as the Bear, the Wolf, or the Deer Gens, and with the savage's love of the marvelous would glory in the distinction which enabled them to derive their paternity from some of the animals held sacred by them. It is hardly necessary for us to run a race with the savage in this line of thought, and ascribe to him what we call an eponymous ancestry. Primitive man bothered himself very little about his ancestry. He gathered into little bands, and formed little communities for the great purpose of protection against human and animal enemies. There is another possible origin of the Gentile organization, as we find it among American savages: certain of the medicine-men claiming power over the Deer, Eagle, Elk, Bear, Snake, Rain, or Water, might gather about them bands of Deer, Eagle, Elk, Bear, Rain, and Snake priests, from whose descendants sacred orders or gentes would be formed. The Apaches denied that their medicine-men came from particular clans. 120</page><page sequence="11">Gentile Organization of the Apaches of Arizona. 121 Matthews speaks of the 0ini ?igini, the "Holy or Sacred people or gentes" mentioned in the Navajo myths. Parkman shows that among the Miamis was "a family or clan whose hereditary duty and privilege it was to devour the bodies of the prisoners burned to death. The act had somewhat of a religious character, was attended with ceremonial observances, and was re- stricted to the family in question." "Jesuits in North America," Introduction, p. xl. Gatchett, in his "Migration Legend of the Creek Indians," pp. 145 and 153, says that among the Creeks certain gentes had a certain preeminence; thus, the Mikos or Mikolgi had to be appointed from certain clans; again, "some public officers could be selected only from certain gentes." No such social or sacerdotal preeminence attaches to any Apache gens.1 Neither did the Apaches have different modes of cutting the hair for different gentes; such a rule obtains among various tribes, but it is not to be noticed in the Southwest, where, however, each tribe is careful to observe its own tribal method. Speaking of the Peruvians, Herrera says, " En las ligaduras de las Cabezas se conocian los Linages," Dec. v. lib. I, p. 3 (the various lineages were known by the manner in which the hair was bound). Let it not be forgotten, however, that the Navajo myth, in its allu- sion to the pet animals taken along by the first of the Navajo race in their wanderings, cannot be explained satisfactorily in any manner at present known, excepting that which teaches us to regard them as gods or totems. Whether clan names.were originally topographical, as I have here suggested, or derived from a more religious train of reasoning, does not militate against the idea that to the mind of the American savage the animals have always been gods, and in some vague and uncertain way connected with the mystery of human creation. " A belief prevails, vague but perfectly apparent, that men them- selves owe their first parentage to beasts, birds, or reptiles, as bears, wolves, tortoises, or cranes, and the names of the totemic clans, borrowed in nearly every case from animals, are the reflection of this idea." Parkman, "Jesuits in North America," Introduction, p. lxviii. Among the Peruvians there were topographical clans, although there were animal titles also. Thus, Garcilasso de la Vega says that, at the Feast of Corpus Christi, in the sacred city of Cuzco, "unos venian como pintan ai Hercules, vestidos con la piel del leon y sus cabezas encabaxados en 1 Brinton asserts that among the Algonkins and Cherokees the medicine-men were confined to one gens.

Otros traian las alas de un ave muy grande, que llaman Cuntur (Condor) puestas a las espaldas, como las que pintau a los angeles, porque se precian descender de aquella ave. "Asi venian otros con otras divisas pintadas, como fuentes, rios, lagos, sierras, monte, cuevas, porque decian que sus primeros padres salieron de aquellas cosas."

No effort has yet been made, to my knowledge, to work out the Gentile organization of the Tinneh tribes in the circumpolar regions of British North America. All the data obtainable are fragmentary, yet of sufficient consequence to excite suspicion that much remains to be developed. The Loucheux of the North are represented as having three clans, - the " Chitsah," who were fish; the " Tain-gres-sah-tsah," who were birds; and the " Nat-singh," who were animals. George Gibbs, in Smithsonian Report of i866 (based upon Hardesty). Dog Rib Tinneh claim to be descended from a dog (see Richard- son's "Account of Franklin's Journey to the Polar Sea," London, 1822, p. I6I). The Kenaiyer (Atnah) had a tradition that the Raven made two women, one of whom is the mother of six races and the other of five. It was the custom that the men of one stock should choose their wives from another, and the offspring belonged to the race of the mother. These stocks were called, I, Ravens; 2, Weavers of Grass Mats; 3, Corner in the Back Part of the Hut; 4 was named from a color; 5, Descendant from Heaven; 6, Fishermen. The second race, i, Bathers in Cold Water; 2, Lovers of Glass Beads; 3, De- ceivers like the Raven, who is the primary instructor of man ; 4 and 5, named from a certain mountain. See Richardson, "Arctic Search- ing Expedition," London, 1851, p. 406. It is not certain that the Atnah are Tinneh. 1 " Some came, as Hercules is painted, dressed in the skin of a lion, with the animal's head worn as a mask, because they prided themselves upon being de- scended from a lion. Others wore the wings of a very big bird, which they call cuntur, fixed to the shoulders, after the manner of angels, because they took pride in being descended from that bird. Others were painted with other devices, such as fountains, rivers, lakes, sierras, woods, and caves, because they say that their ancestors came from those things." Speaking of the Peruvians, Maltebrun says: " The mountains were adored, as the sources of streams; the rivers and fountains, for having watered and fertilized the land; the tree, that furnished them withfire-wood; and the animals that had been slaughtered to satisfy their hunger."

Bancroft, " Nat. Races Pac. Slope," vol. i. p. I32. In a foot- note he quotes Kirby, Smithsonian Report, 1864, who looks upon these three clans " as faintly representing the aristocracy, the middle class, and the poorer orders of civilized nations." The Tutchone Kutchin mentioned by Bancroft, "Nat. Races Pac. Slope," vol. i. p. 115, suggests the Tutsone or Tutsose of the Apaches and Navajos, while the Nuclukayettes recalls the Klu- kaydnni, the White Grass or Reed People. Other instances might be adduced, but only one more will be given, which may have referred to bands of the Tinneh stock. Hearne, speaking of names, says that those of the girls were gen- erally taken from some part or property of the Martin, as the White Martin, Black Martin, Summer Martin, etc. In a foot-note he says that the chief Matonnabbee had eight wives, and they were all called Martin (see Hearne's "Journey," London, 1797, pp. 93, 94), that is, they all belonged to the Martin clan. Hearne evidently lived with the Martin clan; but I cannot say whether he was then with people of Ojibway or Tinneh stock. In the report made by Dr. Franz Boas upon the Indians of British Columbia,' the result of careful, although somewhat brief, investigation is given on "the Tlingit, Haida, Tshimshian, and Kootanie" tribes; but nothing seems to have been done with re- spect to the Tinneh, in which family our Apaches and Navajos must be included. My own suspicion is that the Kootanie (whose name would mean "Fire People" in Apache) belong to that stock also, but I have not the memoranda at hand to verify or rebut my conjecture. Dr. Boas says: "The Tlingit, Haida, Tshimshian, and Heiltsuk have animal totems " (page 23), but "among the Kootenay and Salish of the interior I did not find the slightest trace of the existence of totems" (idem, this is, as has been shown, the fact among the Apaches and Navajos). On the same page, this learned authority says: "The natives (i. e., of the tribes he investigated) do not con- sider themselves descendants of the totem." And he also asserts that they hunt and kill the totem (see page 23). A thought suggested in this connection is that ethnologists may 1 Incorporated in the " Report of the Committee appointed for the Purpose of Investigating and Publishing Reports on the Physical Characters, Languages, etc., of the Northwestern Tribes of the Dominion of Canada," submitted to the British Association for the Advancement of Science, Newcastle-upon-Tyne meeting, I889.

The Apaches have a repugnance to tasting fish, fish-eating birds, porcu- pine at times, peccary at times, and the domestic hog, although within the past twenty years they have learned to eat bacon. But they have no gentes named for fish birds, porcupine, or peccary.2 On the other hand, there is no interference with the free consump- tion of acorns, sunflower seeds, pine nuts, mescal, willow buds, walnuts, juniper berries, and mesquite beans, notwithstanding that all these articles of food occur in the names of clans of that tribe (Apaches). There is reason to believe that observers have not always been accurate or discriminating; that they have confounded ceremonial fasts-fasts of women during periods of seclusion, or just after child- birth, of young men going out on their first hunt, or first warlike expedition, or returning from the funerals of kinsmen-with prohibi- tions of a more general type. The Dest-chin clan is a paint clan. J. Owen Dorsey mentions one among the Omahas; Mooney, if I remember correctly, speaks of a Red or Yellow Paint People among the Cherokees; and there was a Red Paint gens among the Cheyennes, as well as a Chalchi- huitl among the Pueblos. The God of Fire of the Aztecs was called Yellow Face, also the Burnt One, and Red Face. The bodies of slaves sacrificed in his honor were stained yellow. Torquemada, "Monarchia Indiana," Lib. 10, cap. 22. Strange to say, in all the generations and centuries of Mexican contact with the Apache-Navajo tribe, no knowledge seems to have been gained of the Gentile system. From the first conquest of Mexico, all the wandering bands to the north were included under the sweeping designation of "Chiche- mecas," -a word variously interpreted, but best defined by Gustav Bruhl, who derives it from the Aztec roots "chichic" (bitter) and 1 " Families and tribes of Indians have also their guardian fetich in the shape of some animal, as a bear, a buffalo, a hawk, an otter, etc., and the Algonkins called this fetich the totem. The whole species represented in the totem was exempt from pursuit." Schultze, Fetichism, New York, 1885, p. 39. Consult, also, Totem- ism, J. G. Frazer, M. A., Edinburgh, 1887, page 56 and elsewhere. 2 The Choctaws, Chickasaws, and Cherokees never ate hog; so, at least, Adair says.

Consequently 1 this word would seem to mean The People who Dwell in the Country of the Bitter Maguey, or who Eat the Bitter Maguey; just what is meant by the word "Mescalero," the name of one of the big bands of the Apaches. See Gustav Briihl, "On the Etymology of the Word 'Chichimec,'" in "American Anti- quarian," vol. ii. No. I, p. 52. Escudero gives the following as the " Parcialidades" of the Apaches:- i. Vinietinnenne = Tontos. 2. Sagetaen-ne = Chiricahuas. 3. Tjuscen-jenn6 = Gilenos. 4. Yecujen-ne = Mimbrefios. 5. Intu-jenne = Faraones. 6. Sejenne = Mescaleros. 7. Cuelca-jenne = Llaneros. 8. Lipun-jenne = Lipuns. 9. lyutu-jenne = Navajos. See Escudero, "Noticias Estadisticas del Estado de Chihuahua," Mexico, 1834, p. 212. Here " Parcialidades " seems to be used in its proper sense, and is not confounded, as it generally was, with "Barrio" (Ward or Gens, or " Linage ").2 Some of the words in the list from Escudero are translatable. No. I, for example, is the name yet given to the Tontos (the fools). In No. 3 the radicle Tu occurs, meaning water, - probably from their habitat along the Gila River. No. 5 seems to mean "The People who live Here " (intu). No. 8, Lipun-jenne, The Buckskin People, the name given to the Lipans because they made greater use of that material in their gar- ments than the other bands did. No. 9, The People Beyond, or on the other side (of the mountains), the name still given to the Navajos by the Apaches. A very interesting question arises as to who the Intujenne or Faraon Apaches were. The name "Faraon" is not an Apache word. Orozco y Berra, "Geog. de las Lenguas de Mejico," Mexico, I884 says of the Faraon tribe, " Habita las sierras que intermedian del Rio Grande del Norte al de Pecos," p. 381 (the country roamed over by the Mescalero Apaches). 1 Gomara says of the marriages of the Chichimecas: "Casaban con una sola mujer, y aquella no pariente en grado ninguno." Historia de la Conquista de Mejico, p. 431. (They married only one woman, and that one not a relation in any degree.) 2 Diego Duran speaks of the seven " Parcialidades," or great divisions of the Aztecs, each with its own god. See Historia Antigua de la Nueva Esbafia, vol. i. p. 23i, MSS. in Congressional Library.</page><page sequence="16">yournal of American Folk-Lore. Maltebrun gives the Faraon as one of the Apache bands, but as he gives the Ute and Oraiva as dialects of the language, and the Yavipai as another, no dependence need be placed on him; he evi- dently derives from Father Garcia (I776). See "Tableau G6ogra- phique de la distribution Ethnographique des nations et des langues au Mexique," Nancy, 1878, p. 28. Torquemada, who includes the Apaches under the widely applied term "Chichimecas," says that Fray Francisco Lopez, one of the earliest of the Spanish missionaries who entered New Mexico in I58I, in company with Fray Agostin Rodriquez, was hospitably received at one of the pueblos, but his presence gave offense to the Chichimecs of the neighborhood, who came and killed him. Torque. mada styles them " Los barbaros que no conocian a Dios, ni respeta- ban a Dios, como otro Faraon." "Monarchia Indiana," Lib. 21, cap. 14, p. 627 (the barbarians who neither knew nor respected God, like another Pharaoh). This reference, printed in 1609, is the first mention of the word I have been able to find. Torquemada distinctly states that the Apaches were Chichimecs. "Monarchia Indiana," Madrid, I609, Lib. 5, cap. 40. He calls the Spanish and Tlascalan settlers of New Mexico the children of Israel, who were entering the Promised Land, and the Indians thereof were the Canaanites who made war upon them. "Monarchia Indiana," Madrid, I609, Lib. v. cap. 40. Finally, it was while hunting up the names of Apache gentes that I stumbled upon the meaning of the word we employ upon our maps as the designation for the country of the Moquis. The Apaches have a clan, "Sla-na-pa," or "Tu-sla-na-pa," Plenty of Water, and it was found that the pronounciation of this, as of numerous other words, varied in the most arbitrary manner. It was called "Tu-sla," "Tu-slango," "Tu-sahn," and "Tusayan;" and there- fore the word Tusayan, which is not a Moqui word, and was evidently given to Coronado's people (in 1540-I54I) by Apache-Navajo guides, means the land with a great deal of water, or the land through which the Colorado flows, the greatest river in the whole Southwestern region for thousands of miles in any direction. yohn G.
