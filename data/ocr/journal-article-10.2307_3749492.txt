<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE ETHOLOGICAL FALLACY: A NOTE IN REPLY TO MR. MEYNELL R. K. JONES MR. MEYNELL ("Ethology and Ethics", Philosophy, Vol. XLV, No. 174, pp. 290-306) wishes to suggest "that ethology sheds a great deal of light on the question of what kind of behaviour in what circumstances con- tributes to human happiness and fulfilment." Meynell concentrates on Lorenz's On Aggression, and he argues from the nine theses to which he reduces this work that if these were true what particular relevance they would have for ethics. I want to maintain that the issue is a larger one than that contained in the gist of Lorenz's book. It is whether the possibility exists of making analogies between animal and human life. Analogy, when it is made, falls into three categories: analogy of the cultural; analogy of the physical; analogy of the ethical. Now, it seems to me to be far too simplistic an operation to take an aspect of animal behaviour and draw analogies from that aspect to human behaviour. We know, for example, that the former is complex, but in comparison with the latter I think that all the most devoted goose or jackdaw lover would grant that human behaviour exhibited not only greater complexity in degree but also a difference in kind. The greater complexity in degree manifests itself in human behaviour and more specifically in the social structure and social institutions which constitute human society and in which human behaviour takes place. The difference in kind lies in the sophisticated language structure which to some extent limits and structures our perception of the external world;' the difference in kind also lies in culture, a term used extensively in sociology and anthropology to denote the whole accumulation of both human action and the artifacts of human action which are socially rather than genetically transmitted. Man's propensity for learning has diminished the instinctual aspect of his behaviour. "Instinct and learning represent alternative ways to the same end (but) they are by no means exclusive. Rather is it a case of instinctive responses becoming increasingly modifiable by learning the higher we ascend the phylogenetic scale."2 That is, man has not only a cultural sophistication but also an infinite repertoire of learning experience which structures his perception of the external world and makes unique his institutions and social performance. Those who make such frequent parallels between animal and human behaviour seem unaware of the difficulty which already exists in the social sciences in the field of cross-cultural studies. It is by no means certain that Malinowski's study of the Trobrianders, Evans-Pritchard's study of the Nuer, or Mead's work on the Samoans, can be applied to, say, Western industrial society. Studies which have suggested the analogy between the physical effects of, for example, placing nicotine extract under the skins of rats, pigs, or monkeys, and the suggested effect of tumour producing cancer growths in humans, are assuming not only a similarity in the genetic, biological systems of the two but are also excluding the unique cultural or environ- mental characteristics in the human condition. Surely Mr. Meynell would not exclude environmental factors entirely from the realm of disease or social deviances such as homosexuality, alcoholism and suicide? Any scientific research of this kind, I am sure, would preface its findings with the reservation that the analogy might not be as complete as Mr. 71</page><page sequence="2">PHILOSOPHY Meynell assumes. The analogy of the cultural in animals to that in humans is to be equally tempered. If the Harlow monkeys3 show particular side effects to maternal deprivation how justified are we in assuming that this can be translated into a theory of human deprivation? The Harlows themselves point out that human mothers display an infinitely more complex pattern of behaviour than monkey mothers. The display patterns of courting pidgeons do not resemble, except superficially, the courting behaviour of Trobriand Islanders; the former is innate or instinctual while the latter is culturally learned. Any ethical analogy, one would think, might be forced to take into consideration the essential differentiation between behaviour which takes place within a specifically human context, for example culture, and social interaction in a milieu of accumulated learning, and that which is a response to innate mechanisms. Mr. Meynell credits both Marxists and Western democrats with a rather naive belief in a tabula rasa; but this is the height of absurdity of the nurture in the so-called nature/nurture controversy. I do not think that many people nowadays, with the exception of perhaps Ardrey and Jensen4, would really waste all that much time in debating which of these influences exert the greater force. And neither Marxists nor Western democrats would ever to my knowledge maintain that there is no limit to environmental influences on behaviour. These are only a few of the points that I think Mr. Meynell has rather strangely overlooked. My real argument, however, is not with the author of the article but with the alleged tenability of applying to human behaviour and experience knowledge gleaned from either experimental studies of animals or of observations of animals in their natural state. The problems associated with such generalizations have been aptly stated by Dimond, but it will do no harm to reiterate them here.5 No social scientist is opposed to analogies of ethology with human behaviour; all that is asked is that these analogies are treated with the greatest caution and that we become aware of the many difficult problems asso- ciated with them. 1. We must, because of the nature of error in observation, check the accuracy of the information. General observations of animals are often "fitted" into the personal experiences of the human observer. Animal behaviour models may appear to have logical similarities with human social behaviour models, that is, more than the actual behaviour warrants. This is because models are in essence simpler interpretive systems. 2. Whether or not a model is a good fit depends on which part of human behaviour to choose to relate to it. "If there is no logical equiv- alence between the behaviour of animals from which the model was originally derived and the human behaviour on which the model is finally tested, then the idea that there is some inherent logic in this approach cannot be sustained."6 3. ". . . If as it seems it is not possible on the basis of input/output data, so beloved of the system-theory builders, to predict what the nature of the intervening arrangement is likely to be, then this introduces a principle of indeterminancy which is again the very thing that the model builders are seeking to avoid." 4. Generally speaking, statements made by ethologists as to the nature of human behaviour are done without careful reference to human behaviour itself, and certainly they are not done with carefully controlled empirical data of either type of study. 72</page><page sequence="3">THE ETHOLOGICAL FALLACY: A NOTE IN REPLY TO MR. MEYNELL 5. Part of the reason for certain ethologists making categorical statements about human behaviour arises "because of a failure fully to recognize the nature of species differences." Not only do humans and human societies differ enormously (hence the difficulty with cross-cultural studies), but animals themselves differ enormously. Certain similarities, therefore, are artificial in the sense that "behaviour patterns are used for very different purposes, and similar patterns may stem from very different origins." (my italics) Historically, the analogy between animal and human bevaviour has been couched in mentalistic and anthropomorphic terms. McDougall's theory of instincts and Trotter's herd instinct thesis have been largely discredited, but in a sense these early theories have been supplanted by Skinner's operant conditioning and the wider application of ethological theory. It may be, of course, that too much time is being wasted comparing directly the larger behaviour patterns of animal and man, and we ought now to look at the general principles and theories of animal function.8 Even there, however, a static one-one comparison seems already a little old-fashioned and should be looked at in terms of the more dynamic symbolic interactionist theory. To paraphrase Mr. Meynell, his evidence and arguments would suggest that there is a little more to what at first might appear to be a straightforward analogy than the average theologian and philosopher would perhaps care to admit.

Ardrey seems to be suggesting a sort of unifying evolutionary or biological connectedness which brings together all animal and human societies Eysenck, as a behavioural scientist, believes that general laws can usefully be applied to individuals. Observation of animal behaviour and laboratory experimentation on non-huminoids yields data which can be claimed to be analagous to human behaviour. Yet in the process of carrying over, from one area to another, broad generalizations, extreme caution needs to be, and usually is, exercised. See Eysenck, H.
