For several years now, since the publication of Orly Goldwasser's Prophets, Lovers and Giraffes,1 there has been a concerted effort, emanating mostly from those working under the auspices of Goldwasser in Jerusalem and Frank Kammerzell in Gôttingen/Berlin, to convince the Egyptological community that determinatives should be called 'classifiers'. Lincke's book—the sixth volume of the Classification and Categorization in Ancient Egypt series—continues this tradition and strongly implies that those of us who continue to stick to our traditional (+ bad bird determinative?) nomenclature are somewhat behind the linguistic times (p. u). Objections (now made several times, for example by Antonio Loprieno2 and myself3) to the use of the term 'classifier' remain completely unacknowledged. Here, I retain the term 'determinative' and avoid the loaded term 'classifier'.4 Rather than re-iterate my arguments against applying this term to Egyptian determinatives at length,5 I offer the observations I make in this review as further corroboration of my position. Lincke's book is a revised and updated version of her Master's thesis, which was presented in 2007 at Humboldt University in Berlin. In essence, although the author follows Goldwasser's lead in analysing determinatives as classifiers, she distances herself from the latter's focus on seeing categories of thought mirrored in the determinative system. Lincke's focus is instead on the semantic mechanisms underlying the assignment of determinatives, particularly as this pertains to verbs, explored here primarily through the corpus of the Pyramid Texts. The introduction (pp. 1-13) discusses the various functions of signs in Egyptian and introduces the theory of linguistic categorisation. Since the author's analysis is based on the Pyramid Texts, the latter is presented in the historical context of its study over the years, as a corpus with many idiosyncrasies, 1 O.

Kammerzell, 'Egyptian Classifiers at the Interface of Lexical Semantics and Pragmatics', in E. Grossman, S. Polis and J. Winand (eds), Lexical Semantics in Ancient Egyptian (LingAeg SM 9; Berlin, 2012), 55-112. The authors refer to some of the objections raised by Loprieno and myself. 5 One of the most critical objections is equating determinatives—a phenomenon of the written script— with classifiers, which are a feature of spoken language. Determinatives are like classifiers; comparison may be fruitful, but equation is counter-productive and misleading. How can we equate the Jakaltek classifier xi (a repetition of the noun it classifies, xi) with an unvocalised and therefore unbound visual representation like the G39 determinative of ipd, a graphic entity which has a semantic—not a phonetic—value. Information conveyed graphically cannot 'repeat' what is conveyed phonetically (contra p. 27). Unlike all other classifiers, Egyptian determinatives were never vocalised in the way that characterises classifiers without exception (I include here classifiers attested in non-spoken languages like American or British Sign Language which are expressed as overtly as phonetic/ideographic signs).</page><page sequence="2">2014 REVIEWS 515 not the least of which is the mutilation of certain signs, in which Lincke expresses a particular interest. Included in the discussion is some background on linguistic exploration of Egyptian, and determinatives (= classifiers) in particular (pp. 9-11). The first of the three main chapters is rather technical and deals with the orthographic challenges inherent in the Pyramid Texts, from the first hand-copies to modern-day electronic encoding. The author earlier (p. 2) suggests this chapter might be skipped by disinterested readers, but it is rather important for understanding the issues and idiosyncrasies one encounters when trying accurately to render signs attested in Pyramid Texts spells (esp. pp. 17-19), and for understanding the numbering that the list of mutilated signs receives in Appendix 1 (see pp. 22—4). A commendable attempt has been made to encode signs (using a variety of hieroglyphic editors to compensate for their respective deficiencies) as accurately as possible, although Lincke suggests that certain features she considers 'non-meaning-differentiating' can be omitted (p. 22). Chapter 2 deals with determinatives in nominal contexts ('nominal classifiers') and the relations that exist between determinatives and the nominal entities they determine. The latter consist of taxonomic relations of various sorts (pp. 25-36) and meronymic relations (pp. 37-43). Much of this discussion repeats at length Goldwasser's theories,6 which Lincke critiques, preferring instead to follow Kammerzell in using frame semantics to better specify determinatives' relations with their words, especially verbs. Kammerzell's inventory of eight semantic roles is introduced with examples from the Pyramid Texts (pp. 45—6; the source discussion is presented in Appendix 2) before being (very slightly!) modified by the author (pp. 47—52). It is proposed that all relations between verbs and their determinatives termed meronymic (or metaphoric) by Goldwasser can be assigned one or more of these eight roles: - agent who carries out an action - experiencer of a state/action - undergoer of a state/action - instrument through which an action is carried out - location of an action/situation - source of an action/situation - goal towards which an action is aimed - zero, which Lincke suggests should replace Kammerzell's causee of an action; the term zero is defined in linguistics as 'an entity that merely occurs in some location or exhibits a certain property' (P- 49) The boundaries between many of these terms are fluid to the point that one wonders about the usefulness of distinguishing between them.7 There follows a brief but interesting discussion (pp. 59—62) of the implications of the iconicity of anthropomorphic hieroglyphs: i.e., since dynamic events and actions can only be represented statically, signs representing such events and actions actually only represent a characteristic part of them. Furthermore, in the Pyramid Texts, human signs are mostly curtailed, leading to a focus on, for example, one body part demonstrating an action (like walking legs shown on their side instead of a full-body falling). The following section explores how frame semantics may explain the relations between some determinatives and their words; e.g. a sun-disk sign determining something that implies the lack of sun: snk, 'dark' (pp. 62-9). Finally, the chapter concludes with case studies of named categories: [WITH THE MOUTH: j|], [MOVEMENT:^], [CONTROL / FORCE: ^ ] , Most prominently from her 2002 publication cited above, but also some ideas expressed for the first time in O. Goldwasser, From Icon to Metaphor: Studies in the Semiotics of Hieroglyphs (OBO 142, Fribourg, 1995). 7 For example, two throne variants are cited in fig. 8 (p. 52) as determinatives for the verb hms 'to sit', one is designated 'location', the other 'goal'. In a third citation of hms, this time with a truncated (sitting, we assume) person as its determinative—appearing here in the table to demonstrate the 'agent' role (it could equally be cited as 'experiencer' or 'undergoer'). The more general description 'meronymic' suits all. For my objections to the naming of categories in Egyptian, see A. McDonald, Review of Goldwasser 2002, LingAeg 12 (2004), 239. Lincke (p. 71) mentions that the diversity within the group of terms determined by [ ^1] exemplifies the difficulties involved in naming categories, but nevertheless names hers.

Each is presented in a slightly different way, and there is a disturbing lack of raw data to let readers judge the conclusions offered for themselves. Indeed, the next chapter proposes that many word-determinative relations can be explored without reference to context (pp. 93ff); this is discussed further below. The third and final main chapter focuses on determinative use and context. This is a crucial issue and so I deal with it in some detail. Lincke first discusses whether determinatives of Egyptian verbs should be equated with 'verb classifiers' (which are independent of the nominal argument of verbs) or 'verbal classifiers' (which conversely tend to echo the verb's subject/object) in linguistics (pp. 83—90). Lincke suggests in the majority of cases, Egyptian determinatives of verbs fall into the former category; she seeks to prove her point by examining verbs that a) are attested with different determinatives, b) occur as often as possible in the corpus, c) are not connected to a pre-existing nominal entity that is bound up with the verbal action, and d) occur in several different contexts. Only a few verbs fit these criteria: e.g. wnm, 'to eat'. In all but one case, it has a doubled bread determinative (X7: ); the author states that in nearly all cases, the thing that is being eaten is not actually bread, so the doubled determinative seems to be independent of the verb's nominal argument (= what is being eaten). Similarly, we are told that the verb wsb,'to feed on', occurs fifteen times; frustratingly, only two of those instances are listed. But is context irrelevant to our understanding of the bread determinatives? Given the high proportion of offering rituals directly involving bread in the Pyramid Texts, the bread determinatives of both wnm and wsb may very much be motivated by context—just in a wider sense. In PT 553 (§i357a-b), for example, bread is not the direct object of wsb, but there is mention of it in the next line.9 Egyptian iconic representation aimed to manipulate reality in its favour. Using the same food determinatives for wsb and wnm in this spell, in close proximity to one another, and in close proximity to a mention of bread as an archetypal food, seems very deliberate and suited to context; thus extracting these words from their context hampers comprehension. In seeking general rules, we should not overlook heightened saliency of what might seem to be conventionalised determinatives when taken out of context (in all its senses). Indeed, rather than devising a list of the best types of verb to explore the issue of context sensitivity, can we not simply look at a whole spell and consider whether context is having any effect on determinative choice? Take, for example, PT 413 (§734a-36c): Is -tw 3h pn Ppn hms wsb=k ( i aJ i *=* ) hms kl=k wnm=f t hnkt ( + j 3 5 ) hnr=k, 'Raise yourself, this akh of this Pepi so that you may eat; may your ka sit so that it may consume bread and beer with you...' the author states that in nearly all t ioubled [] determinative seems to b ng eaten).

This repetition seems to have a reinforcing effect which is not confined to just determinatives: compare the repeated mi-sign in the following phrase. There is no good reason to restrict ourselves to wondering if a determinative reflects the direct argument of the verb; the idea of context-sensitivity need not be defined so narrowly. In a spell, crafted to maximise the agency of its component words, context means considering the whole spell as an environment, and in the most thorough consideration, the corpus of the entire pyramid. The fine line between determinative and ideogram (or classifier and logogram to use Lincke's terminology) is alluded to but left aside (p. 4). But looking at this spell, that would seem to be a mistake. Signs echo and reinforce signs, regardless of the terminology we apply. If we restrict our notice to signs in artificial categories of our own making, we will inevitably miss textual effects communicated not solely through signs and words, but through texts as whole entities. After acknowledging that context may affect some, if not all, determinatives (pp. 93—110), the author attempts to account for the various relations that connect determinatives to the words with which they are used. A crucial differentiation is introduced between those determinatives, on the one hand, that relate to words in their non-context-dependent, more abstract sense (e.g. ^ determining any verb involving force—it does not represent the specific action that the context may be describing) and those on the other hand that are context-sensitive and reflective of the referent specified in that context (e.g. a Nubian captive described by a generic word for 'enemy' having a specifically Nubian captive determinative); several of these exceptions to the general rule are offered for discussion (pp. 94-107). The issue of context-dependency is presented alongside the idea of determinatives operating on two levels: level one determinatives are independent of context and travel with roots through various derivations; level two determinatives are secondary rather than primary, and they might refer instead to the gender, type, status or class of objects to which a word belongs (examples are presented in fig. 15, pp. 100-1).10 The final pages of the third chapter consider to what extent determinatives are used to differentiate between words stemming from homographic roots (pp. 111-13), as a means of differentiating between the various possible meanings of a common root. Lincke notes a few examples from the Pyramid Texts where different determinatives are used with the same word without an effect on the meaning of the word: one example she discusses is hhi, 'to search', which may be determined with a curtailed man-and-stick sign (p. m) or with y\ . The broad meaning of the word perhaps does not change with the determinative, but we should not discount that the differing determinatives may highlight distinct nuances. Regrettably, there is no concluding chapter to take the discussion forward, just a summary of what has been discussed. There are two appendices: the first is comprised of a brief discussion of sign mutilation in the Pyramid Texts, its development over time and the aforementioned list of mutilated human signs (this last is interesting, but of dubious usefulness without information about context). The second appendix is an excerpt from an as-yet unpublished report by Frank Kammerzell on the results of the collaborative project from which this book springs. It explains in greater detail the assignment of semantic roles that Lincke makes use of in her third chapter. Lincke's book advocates several new approaches to those of us interested in determinatives. The first suggests some distancing from the approach advocated by Goldwasser, moving away from considering just taxonomic and metonymic connections between determinatives and their words, and moving instead towards a supposedly more specific mode of analysis based on frame semantics. The second, following this line of thought, suggests that determinatives may be assigned several specific roles and can be seen as operating on two distinct levels, as outlined above. The array of terms with which we may further describe determinatives may seem impressive: the determinative of sit, 'to libate' (a combination of elements: a truncated person watching water cascade from a vessel on its side onto the ground, upon which the figure's hands are resting), can be described 10 I wonder about the usefulness of attempting to differentiate these two levels: does one level have a greater saliency than the other? In the examples listed in fig. 15, it seems as if the 'secondary' determinatives' contribution is more pertinent to understanding words/phrases (in mht-wrt, the 'secondary' cow determinative indicates the deity's bovine nature).

But what do we gain through the use of such terminology? At times, its application seems rather like an intellectual sorting exercise, carried out without the possibility of verifying our assumptions with native speakers (as would be done when establishing facts about classifier usage in modern languages). More dangerously, it may distract the attention away from important and pertinent contextual information in favour of creating neat tables and classifications. Lincke (following Kammerzell) congratulates the ancient Egyptian determinative system for obeying orderly rules, some of which this book enumerates. Certainly rules existed - no writing system could communicate effectively and comprehensibly if it was completely anarchic in the way it composed and used words. But my feeling, from my own observations of determinatives in context, is that the script (after all, the product of an elite and restricted club) was never constrained to obey these. The Egyptian script offered those scribes who were interested in playing with the rules the opportunity to create webs of meaning, spanning whole texts, sometimes (from our perspective) whole corpora. This means that baboons replace Seth animals in Seti I's inscriptions at Abydos.11 Appreciation for this piece of politeness for Abydos' patron deity is lost if we take examples of [nsn + ] out of their (in this case, cultic) context in order to list them alongside other uses of the baboon determinative or other writings of nsn. Similarly, the scribe who composed the Semna Stela for Senwosret III was able to manipulate the assignment of human and divine signs when referring to the person of the king (hm), his illustrious forebears (itw, it), and his despicable enemies (hrwy, nhsy), creating what could be interpreted as an increasingly forceful presentation of Senwosret's divine will. Counting instances of the use of to determine words relating to Senwosret results in a number.12 Looking at the distribution in context of that writing and the way it clusters towards the end of the text, when the king is making sure his successors will follow in his footsteps or suffer the consequences, might offer a more meaningful analysis of the impact of determinative assignment. Determinative semantics in complex written compositions like the Abydos texts or the Semna Stela should not be straightforwardly compared to generalised instances of classifier use in modern spoken languages. The Egyptian (hieroglyphic and hieratic) script's high level of iconicity was one of its defining characteristics and the effects of this iconicity on Egyptian signs are numerous - from a heightening of their agency to a broadening of their expressiveness both within solely textual environments and when texts are part of larger compositions like tableaux on walls or in papyri. A second defining characteristic is the fluidity of component signs' uses. It is not acceptable to segregate determinatives off for study alone. One must also consider usages of logograms, and even occasionally phonetic signs imbued with determinative-like functions.'3 There is much food for thought in Lincke's third chapter, and there could have been a greater concentration on verbs: was it necessary in chapter 2 to re-cover such well-trodden ground? Those of us who are interested in determinatives—whatever we call them—need no more recaps of Rosch and Lakoff. Given the author's statement that she had a well-studied textual corpus at her disposal (p. 14), there was a missed opportunity to present more fully the evidence behind some of her theories. The tables of statistics and figures in this book look impressive, but they bypass important information that only contextual study can highlight. Exploring the web of relations binding determinatives 11 A. McDonald, Animal Metaphor in the Ancient Egyptian Determinative System: Three Case Studies (PhD thesis, Oxford University; Oxford, 2002), 163—6. 12 Compare Kammerzell's table on pp. 156-7, which counts signs out of context; or Lincke's fig. 13 (p. 88), which lists numbers of times certain determinatives appear in the various pyramids in writings of hms, 'to sit'. Might there be contextual reasons for choosing a person-variant rather than a throne-variant? 13 Examples abound in PT spell 227, some elements of which are cited out of context by Lincke (e.g. in her fig. 7, p. 46). The unique writings of hsk (in the phrase: , 'severed is the head...') and the epithet hsr-ntr ( Q&gt;f\J ) defy easy classification. In one, the primarily phonetic owl-sign is used to represent the concept of mutilation, perhaps because it often suffers this. This could be a scribe's joke, but it is pertinent to the processes of sign mutilation about which Lincke states (p. 131) that the Egyptians left us no clues. In the other, the H/r-ideogram is reversed to face the arm-and-club sign threatening it, making the drama between them central to understanding the meaning of the epithet they write. The scorpion determinative is also difficult to interpret, since the spell directs itself first against a snake (and seems to address itself to only one hostile entity, reflected in the use of the singular dependent pronoun — tw). Surely we are missing the point by trying to slot these complex semantic entities into tables, as Kammerzell does (p. 155; Lincke duplicates this example, p. 46), although she misrepresents the hieroglyphic components of the word, omitting the arm with club sign)? : baboons replace Seth animals in Seti Γ s inscriptions at Abydos.1 liteness for Abydos' patron deity is lost if we take examples of [nsn ultic) context in order to list them alongside other uses of the baboo )f nsn. iposed the Semna Stela for Senwosret III was able to manipulate th e signs when referring to the person of the king (hm), his illustriov :able enemies (hrwy, nhsy), creating what could be interpreted as a η of Senwosret's divine will.
