ADHEMAR GELB. Z. f. Psych., LVIII, I U. 2, pp. 1-58. Very diverse opinions are at present held in regard to Gestaltqualititen, or form qualities. Genetic analyses have brought widely differing results. The purpose of this paper is to make clear the different views on the subject, to discover their points of agreement and difference, and to see if any of these views can be accepted. Often facts have been introduced that had no real bearing on the subject; in other cases the real explanatory factors have been omitted. Ehrenfels claims that certain complexes appear as unities, as things absolutely closed within themselves. A melody, for example, he maintains, is more than the sum of its individual members and this surplus is form qual- ity. His reasons for thinking so are, firstly, the fact that a melody may be recognized though played in different keys; and, secondly, the fact that a different arrangement of the same tones gives a different melody. Form quality is therefore defined as a positive ideational content which is bound up with the occurrence of mental complexes, themselves containing independent mental processes. Ehrenfels seems to imply that a melody is not the sum of its individual tones but the sum of their mutual relations. In criticism of this view it is urged that the additional something which exists in a mental complex is not an additional quality but a complex which must itself be composed of various contents; moreover, if the recognition of a melody depends on the equality of relations, then a melody is recognized because of the presence of the same relations and in spite of the change in key; thirdly, this assumption of relations is in contradiction with Ehrenfels' view that form quality is a given and not a produced content. In discussing the relation between form qualities and relations, a question which Ehrenfels has not considered, Meinong main- tains that these experiences of relation must be either parts of the original constituents of the complex or parts of the funded content. Under either 675</page><page sequence="2">676 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW. [VOL. XX. assumption the nature of the funded content becomes questionable. One of Meinong's difficulties is that in the course of his reasoning logical and mathematical considerations creep into psychological description A more difficult problem lies in the question whether or not sensations from different sense departments may be considered as parts of a complex. The idea of a temporal continuum composed of a succession of discrete momentary impres- sions which are held together by a form quality is accepted by Meinong and Witasek. This conclusion, however, is not based on careful psychological observation and is not tenable. Indeed there is little possibility of any satisfactory explanation at the present time. According to Meinong, re- lations such as similarity and difference are not perceived but experienced through ideational production (Vorstellungsproduktion). For this there is, however, no introspective warrant. Lipps's contribution is the contention that the experiences of relation are the result of apperception or of the direction of attention on a certain mental content or object. After discussing the theories of Husserl, Kriebig, Cornelius, Marty, and Stumpf the conclusion is reached that relations are peculiar individual mental processes. They are not a class of sensory contents but are bound up with the concurrence of at least two mental processes. These experiences of relation are parts of the whole as surely as are the sensory constitutents inasmuch as they lead to reactions as inevitably as do the sensations. A mental complex is fully char- acterized by its constituents and the experiences of relation that exist between them. No other mental processes, such as unity or coherence, need to be postulated. A. S. EDWARDS. Pragmatic Elements in Modernism. ERRETT GATES. Am. J. Ph., XV, I, PP. 43-56. In his philosophy, the Modernist is an eclectic. He takes his metaphysics from absolute realism, his epistemology from Kantian empiricism, and his logic from pragmatism. French Modernists have identified themselves with a school of philosophy called the Philosophy of Action, but in this respect they stand alone. Modernists are not interested in philosophy for its own sake. They are attempting, within the Roman Catholic Church, to synthesize modern science and democracy with Catholic dogma and institutions. For this purpose, they have had recourse to pragmatic principles, though they have not adopted the system as such. The two principles generally accepted are that experience is the source of all knowledge and the test of all validity, and that usefulness, or practical consequences, is the criterion of truth. Religion has never established itself firmly by any other means than these. Since the scholastic proofs for the existence of God have lost value, the modernists have recourse to actual experience of the divine, and affirm the sovereignity of conscience as an organ of religious knowledge. Such an experience, however, is not purely individualistic, but is also the experience of a divine impulse which reaches all men as members of a social organism. Christianity is a living and developing experience; dogma and institutions are simply the body</page><page sequence="3">No. 6.] SUMMARIES OF ARTICLES. 677 wherein it preserves its life. They have grown up in the past only as they have answered a human need and they must perform a like service in the present. Following the pragmatic distinction between fact-judgments and value- judgments, Modernists distinguish between truths of fact and truths of faith. Though they accept the results of scientific and historical investi- gations, these have no effect upon their faith, for this is a function of the spir- itual life. Dogma and institutions are but symbols whose values depend upon the spiritual preparation and insight of the worshiper. One can accept that which has value for him and, without in any way compromising himself, leave the rest. CORRINNE STEPHENSON. Idealism and the Conception of Forgiveness. J. W. SCOTT. Int. J. E., XXI, 2, pp. i89-i98. Modern idealists can no longer believe in forgiveness as traditionally con- ceived. For forgiveness cannot be the recognition of the atonement for past evil by present good, if, as they hold, an act can never be abstracted from the agent, the context, and the consequences. Neither do they believe that the acts to be forgiven are those which the self cannot help, which are the un- mediated expression of peronality. On the contrary idealists think that the one act not to be forgiven is that which issues directly from the true self. But the only act with this origin is the act of moral synthesis and that is always good. All other acts can be forgiven for an act itself is altered as its setting, which is the life of the agent, enlarges and improves. KATHERINE EVERETT. On the Association Functions of the Cerebrum. SHEPHERD IVORY FRANZ. J. of Ph., Psy., and Sci. Meth., VII, 25, pp. 673-683. The motor cortical mechanisms of the cerebrum and those for hearing, touch, and vision are understood and localized. But there is a vagueness in regard to the functions of the association areas. These few facts are known: in the frontal association area are located centers for speech and writing; in the posterior association area are centers for the understanding of auditory and visual speech; the frontal regions are clearly associated with the production of movements, especially those of a complex character; in the posterior associ- ation area is an area for the understanding, through the medium of the skin and motor sensations, of the character of objects; the results of work on monkeys and cats indicate that both the frontal and the posterior areas are concerned in the formation of simple sensorimotor habits. In the formation of an as- sociation many, perhaps thousands, of cells in different areas of the cortex are active. In a visuo-motor association, for example, these cortical areas act successively: visuo-sensory, visuo-psychic, posterior association, anterior association, intermediate precentral, precentral. From the first two we get perceptions, from the last two, reactions, and the second two are links between the sensory and motor ends, and between the two cerebral hemispheres. The phenomena of aphasia and apraxia show that both areas so called are associ-</page><page sequence="4">678 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW. [VOL. XX. ation areas. The frontal areas have a more direct connection with the motor areas than the posterior have. Studies in apraxia show this. In dementia the frontal region degenerates more than the other regions, and in imbecility it is undeveloped. The posterior areas are more closely allied with the sensory spheres. These are large in intellectual men, and clinicians locate sensory aphasias there. The sixfold association process above indicated appears com- plex, but it is simpler than the actual physiological process. From the point of view of this article we can understand the conflicting views of aphasia, the localization of the attention and inhibition centers in the frontal lobes, and we may see why intellectual centers may be located in the frontal and posterior association areas. It is premature to speculate regarding all the distinct anatomical areas, but we have evidence sufficient to warrant our conclusions regarding distinct functions for the hitherto little understood association areas. J. REESE LIN. Zur Psychologie der Systeme. HERMANN GRAF KEYSERLING. Logos, I, 3, PP. 405-415. Profound thought may be defined as thought which has made sure of the truth of its assumptions by a thorough criticism. Thinkers go astray in their reflections for three reasons. First, because the ideas serving as the material of thought must be manipulated according to the laws of the mind's working, these laws or symbols are hypostasized and mistaken for objective reality. The ratio cognoscendi is made a ratio essendi. Second, philosophers confuse the products of their own imaginations with their true constructive descrip- tions of reality. Psychologically the two are the same. The third hindrance to our knowledge of reality is the conviction that all reality must be compre- hensible, and that it can be known by the concepts already in use. But truly original insights cannot fall into the old schemes. It is recognized that many useful principles of mathematics and physics are not conceptually explainable. The third fallacy has led to the discounting of many genuine experiences of reality. It must be remembered that the old philosophical systems meant much more than could be expressed in the conventional formulations of the time. KATHERINE EVERETT. Die Erkenntnis der Dinge an sich. HANS CORNELIUS. Logos, I, 3, PP. 361- 37'. An analysis of the apparently simple distinction between an ordinary object or thing and the appearance of the thing, gives rise to numerous prob- lems. In the first place, we cannot be sure of the correspondence of the ap- pearance with the thing itself, because we cannot know what may happen during the transformation of nerve stimulation into conscious perception. Second, the object as it appears is conditioned partly by the percipient, and to know the thing itself we must eliminate this foreign factor, which is im- possible. Such reflections as these led to dogmatic idealism which denied the</page><page sequence="5">No. 6.] SUMMARIES OF ARTICLES. 679 existence of things in themselves. Such a view as this is rid of the problem of how brain stimulations are projected into an external space, for all objects are our own perceptions of them. Moreover, it is an advance in thought because it asks, and does not beg, the question of our perception of things. But dogmatic idealism explains objects only while perceived, not the persisting object. A better idealism explains the thing in itself as that coherent and permanent body of laws which governs our perception of an object, and the appearance as the momentary impression of the object during our actual perception. KATHERINE EVERETT. The Psychological Explanation of the Development of the Perception of External Objects (III). (Reply to Prof. Stout.) H. W. B. JOSEPH. Mind, N. S., XX, 78, pp. i6i-i8i. Professor Stout's reply in the January issue of Mind, calls for two specific rejoinders. First, what he means by an extensive character belonging to presentations as such is not clear. Why is the whole of parts, which is appre- hended, a presentation rather than the external world itself? What relation- ship does he assert to hold between the presentation and the external world? Second, although Professor Stout's previous article appeared to be an account of the transition from the sense-experience conditioning the awareness of an external object to that awareness itself, he now disclaims belief in any such transition. What relation does he then assume between these two? But the chief defect in Professor Stout's article is the unintelligibility of his theory of presentations. At times, they seem to be identical with sensations. They then form a series of self-subsistent entities, like Hume's impressions, and are opposed to a parallel series of material objects. The connection between the two series is not adequately explained. At times, a presentation is a mere condition or prius of the awareness of external objects. But sometimes a presentation is identified with matter as it is in itself, or with a partial aspect of matter. At other times, a presentation is described as meaning for me, an external object, but for another, a state of my brain. But Professor Stout's article suggests beyond his own statement, certain weaknesses in psychological procedure in general. Psychology aims to analyze the mind just as any mechanical science analyzes a physical material. But a scientific account of the soul can deal only with fragmentary exhibitions of its behavior. The soul as a whole cannot be comprehended by a science proceeding in this manner. Moreover, the nature of rational thinking is not exactly or ade- quately expressed in terms of cause and effect. Such a phenomenon as the so-called "association of ideas" is typical of a legitimate psychological subject- matter. Properly speaking, psychology is not a science, but a collection of detached inquiries. KATHERINE EVERETT.</page><page sequence="6">68o THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW. [VOL. XX. Fur und wider den Monismus. PAUL SCHWARTZKOPFF. Ar. f. sys. Ph., XVII, I, pp. 44-99. From theological and Kantian dualisms rose attempts to unify the world by means of one immanent world-principle. An idealistic pantheism or a ma- terialism resulted, and the effort to unite these two disciplines has yielded the modern systems of monism, which differ according to their different conceptions of this world principle; their different interpretations of the identity of God and the world and of God's consciousness and personality. The majority of the monists hold to a practical identity, God and the world being but different aspects of the same thing. The world ground is an immanent world cause, and God an active God, dwelling in the world. From this point of view results an immanent, causal monism with which Lotze, Eucken and the writer mainly agree. Should God withdraw from the world, the laws of nature would become the true God. In opposition to deism real monism demands the immediacy of the activity of God in the world. Among other types of monism, the functional and developmental are worthy of consideration, especially the latter, because of its teleological explanation of the world organism. The criticism of monism in general will concern itself with the fundamental principle of the all-one as the immanent world-unity. Now, though the supporters of monism reject any world-cause, even as immanent, lest it be dangerous to monism, they put in place of it the all-substance, which, in the concrete, is only a veiled cause. Any form of transcendence, they reject necessarily, since it does not attach an equal value to both cause and effect. Every cause and effect in the phenomenal world points to some immanent cause, something inherent in the nature of the phenomena. Their reciprocal action may represent a secondary causality, but it goes back to an immanent, primary one. The world cannot be made up of a mere sum of separate objects, it must be an organic whole, it must have some inner prin- ciple of unity. This is the world-cause, which is immanent in all the separate things and their actions. If this inner substantiality of each individual is destroyed, the whole world-system breaks down. Some monists would change the individual into a bare function of the all-one, but rather is it to be con- ceived as possessing a certain independence on its own account. It performs its own particular work while at the same time it participates in the common work of the whole. The causal working of things requires the support both of the universal substance and of the individual. If, as in the case of Kant, a substantial world ground is discarded as an appearance, a mere form of thought, the all-one cannot be considered as the support of the world of phenomena and of activity, and these have no support as such. It does not suffice, in answering the question of the relation of the all-one to the indi- vidual, to say that the latter is only an appearance, nor to hold to a settled relation between an inactive substance and active modes. There must be real life in the substance, or the cause of the activity of the individuals would be something external to and greater than the substance itself. The final unity of substance and individuals lies in their activity. The individuals have a recip-</page><page sequence="7">No. 6.] SUMMARIES OF ARTICLES. 68i rocal action among themselves, but the world principle is active in these reciprocal activities also. Much of the confusion of monism on this point is due to the antithesis of two other fundamental principles, mind and matter. This antithesis corresponds to the inner-outer dualism. What we experience directly is inner activity. The outer material can be experienced only indi- rectly. This externality of what is mediately experienced naturally assumes a spatial, visible, tangible form, becomes "matter" for the directly experienced "mind." The essentially distinct character of these two forms of experience finds expression in the tendency on the part of some monists to speak of an attributive, essential dualism-in-monism. The problem of the outer and inner leads to the consideration of the consciousness and the personal character of the universal cause. Some monists regard God as over-personal, over-con- scious. Must over-personality, however, somehow embrace personality, if it is to pass beyond it? It is here that the ethico-religious aspect of monism comes into consideration. The non-existence of a personal God seems to be an essential principle of a truly monistic position. The consciousness of the universal must be a sort of completed purposiveness, lacking the limitations of personality in the usual sense. CORRINNE STEPHENSON. Zur Methode der Philosophiegeschichte. NIcOLAI HARTMANN. Kant-Studien, XV, 4, PP. 459-485. The history of philosophy is conditioned in so many ways by other fields of tho ught and investigation that it appears, at first, to be the most dependent and limited of studies. Yet it presents an especial sort of sequence, that of the continuity of thought or the history of problems. In the problem we find a unity which bridges over the temporal gaps between systems and relates the points of view of different philosophers. Since the continuity which the problem affords is of a vital, methodical character, the history of philosophy may be, on the basis of this conception, the most independent branch of his- torical investigation. A problem-history does not necessitate the ignoring of all the individual peculiarities of philosophers, for manyof these particulars have systematic significance, yet we should begin with attaining a comprehension of fundamental systematic problems and only work toward personal details as border-problems. Individual philosophers do not create these systematic- philosophical problems. They arise from the objective content of the sciences and from the nature of reason itself. Hegel, while right in maintaining that on the whole there is a systematic continuity in the temporal sequence of stages in the problem, was wrong in supposing the development to be antithetical in character, undeviating, and uniformly progressive. Historical stages need not coincide with stages in the development of the concept. We need only affirm that on the whole every historical stage contains within itself a systematic step. The problem is a systematic element or factor which is the presupposition at once of historical continuity and of systematic unity. Only by reasoning on the basis of the necessary development of philosophical problems is it possible</page><page sequence="8">682 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW. [VOL. XX. to bridge over the serious lacuna which we find in the history of philosophy. The method which is required by a problem-history is qualitative rather than quantitative, since such a history is concerned, not with the chronological arrangement of facts, but with the interconnection of problems. In connection with this method, problems may be considered as transcendental conditions of the possibility of the history of philosophy, points of view for the sifting and sorting of historical material. These problems point in all directions, to the future as well as to the past. Opposed points of view which appear perennially in the history of philosophy are systematic rather than historical. Onesided- ness results from the necessary limitation of the activity of an individual philosopher, but it tends to be counterbalanced by opposite onesidedness. These oppositions may be ideally transcended in the light of the conception of the unity of historical continuity or the eternal self-unification of history, though this is a limiting conception and does not signify the demand for an absolute history. This method of focusing upon historical-philosophical problems was foreshadowed in ancient times by Aristotle and revived in more developed form by Hegel, while the work of many contemporary writers indicates its vitality and promise. J. R. TUTTLE. The Evolution of Religion. SHAILER MATHEWS. Am. J. The., XV, i, pp. 57-82. In applying the term evolution to religion, it is necessary to consider the na- ture of religion, its development into species as it has been conditioned by its en- vironment, the traces of the lower in the more highly developed religious forms, and the survival of the socially fittest. The more complex systems of religion may indicate the trend which the evolution of religion has taken, but to find the original "cell," one must go back to man's first conscious attempt to place himself in a beneficial relationship with the superhuman forces of his world. Religion may not imply a belief in a supreme person but it does imply a concep- tion of the environment as somehow personified. Primitive religions deal with environment directly but as the tribal organization develops, religion enters into a naive, anthropomorphic stage. Instead of external forces being treated like persons, they are treated as persons and later as leaders of the tribe who were to be placated by sacrifice and thanked by gifts. As one tribe subjugated others, the tribal god was considered as monarch over the gods of the con- quered peoples, and his relations became less those of a father and more those of a lawgiver. In some cases the superhuman monarch of the nation came to be regarded both as the superhuman monarch of the world and as the moral ideal. Only a few religions have advanced beyond the monarchial conception. Brahmanism has become an impersonal cosmic philosophy; Judaism and Christianity have gone into a quasi-transcendental sphere. Christianity has also tried to add rationalizing formulas in which to correlate itself with a developing world view. At present it is plainly in a process of evolution. Scientific thought has shown the inadequacy of the monarchical or paternal conception without showing the next stage of those conceptions by which</page><page sequence="9">No. 6.1 SUMMARIES OF ARTICLES. 683 the significance of the religious life is to be intelligible. In a sense we are back with the primitive man,-face to face with nature as a whole. Religion is either to be replaced by natural science or to start on a new cycle of develop- ment. Probably the latter, for, though we cannot think of the whole in terms of monarchy, we can think of it through the discovery, within it, of the presence of personality. As human personalities, we are as truly the expression of forces resident in the whole as are the laws of physics. Man must recognize in his environment the extra-human elements, which have been termed per- sonal, and which can condition situations in which they and he mutually react. In so far as he does this he is religious. Religion, being involved in evolution, bears traces of past stages. The monarchical characteristics are the most tenacious, but they too are shaping themselves in accordance with modern ideals. Religion, without institutions, is of small significance, but these insti- tutions must be adapted to changing, social requirements. The modern world must be reconvinced that religion is more than a survival and that the appeal to the universe in terms of personalism is j ustifiable, after concepts inherited from less complex social experience have been abandoned. In the struggle for survival, the religion best fitted to sociological conditions is the one that will survive. The future will show, not an annihilation of one religion by another, but a union of their elements grouped about some nucleat- ing conception and forming an organic whole. Christianity, in its vitally ethical and theological sense, is just such a conception. In this universal Christianity, the truths of the other religions will be embodied but there will be within them that unifying, rational exposition of a personal reconcilia- tion with a cosmic God of love, which is Christianity's essential contribution to religious evolution. CORRINE STEPHENSON. L'evolution morphologique du langage selon Wilhelm Wundt. A. HUMBERT. Rev. de Ph., XI, 2, pp. II3-I40. The empirical tendencies of modern philosophy have served to re-establish the connection between the particular sciences and philosophy. Wundt, for instance, in his Voelkerpsychologie has treated philosophically the formation and evolution of linguistic material. The original value of gestures and words, he holds, was subjective and individual,-they expressed feelings and did not designate objects. From the point of view of meaning each word indicates an object, a quality, or a state, and is a noun, adjective, or verb. Other parts of speech are of recent origin. The distinctions of gender primarily had no reference to sex, but indicated the dignity of the object named. Living beings were opposed to inanimate beings. The Hamitic and the Semitic languages continue this distinction of words as of only two genders. In other languages names of adult men were of one gender, those of women and children of another, and names of things without life of a third. Hence the three genders of the Indo-European languages. For number some Australian languages have no distinction, and the Mexican used the plural only to signify superior beings. Sometimes the demonstrative pronoun indicated plurality.</page><page sequence="10">684 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW. [VOL. XX. This also was indicated by collective, indefinite names, and sometimes by onomatopoeia. Eventually this was done by abstract prefixes or suffixes. Three steps in the development of declension are known. In the first there are no distinctive forms for the cases, in the second an excessive number of casual forms express relations between ideas, and in the third the number of cases is limited to those of essential relations. Where case was externally determined the development followed the order of perception, the subject, the object, and the determination of the object being shown respectively by the nominative, the accusative, and the dative and genetive cases. The emotional elements are the points of departure in internal determination of cases. The subject or the object was indicated by accent or syntactical position. Wundt considers emotional emphasis the source of the distinction of cases. All cases internally determined are dependent on psychological associations, except that of the subject. Originally the verb had no temporally distinct character, since consciousness presents objects and their qualities on the same temporal plane with states of consciousness. Thought later eliminated the time index from all but the states of consciousness. Finally a verb came to be the expression of the thought or will of the subject. A per- ception of action in objective form probably originated in an emotional state. The third person which denotes objects of thought is, like metaphysical "substance," a projection into the world of objects of an invariable substratum of the changing states of consciousness. In this sense things are the "third persons," since they express the durable element of our objective representa- tions. Voice, mode, and tense evolved in the order given. Tense is a late development. Primitive man related events as present. Then, as now, each spoke what might be called his own dialect, having expressions peculiar to himself. For that reason the psychology of language is a chapter of social psychology. Its materials are furnished by common elements, through values of words accepted in accordance with social agreement. J. REESE LIN. Philosophical Significance of Mathematical Logic. B. RUSSELL. Rev. de Met., XIX, 3, pp. 281-291. From a philosophical point of view the most brilliant results of mathematical logic are the exact theories of infinity and continuity. In infinite collections, for example, the assemblage of finite integers, we can establish a one-to-one correspondence between the entire class and a proper part. Thus, the cardinal number of an infinite class is the same as the cardinal number of a certain part of the class. The traditional contradiction in the concept of infinity resulted from the assumption that all members obey complete induction. Closely allied to the problems about infinity are those concerning continuity, and their solution is obtained by the same method. The paradoxes of Zeno and the difficulties encountered in the analysis of space, time and motion are completely removed by the modern theory of continuity. According to this the continuum consists of an infinite number of distinct elements. It is true that these elements cannot be obtained by continual division but it does not</page><page sequence="11">No. 6.] SUMMARIES OF ARTICLES. 685 therefore follow that they do not exist. The mathematical theory of motion employs the notions of function and variable. The effect is conceived as a function of the cause and, instead of finding a single cause for a given effect, a functional formula is determined which is made to comprehend an infinite number of causes and effects. The notion of function is bound up with mathematical deduction. In most cases of deduction the subject of the proposition is of least importance. The validity of the deduction depends uniquely on its form. Pure mathematics is not arbitrary in this assertion, for it is necessary that the hypothesis should truly imply the thesis. If we make the hypothesis that the hypothesis implies the thesis we can deduce nothing from this unless the new hypothesis truly implies the new thesis. We therefore need true propositions for the subject of implication. If we take as premises propositions which are not true the consequences would not be truly implied by the premises. This necessity for true premises involves the important distinction between a hypothesis and a premise. Rules of deduction have a double purpose, at first as premises and then as methods for deriving conclu- sions from hypotheses. Now if the rules of deduction were not true the con- clusions derived by their means would not truly be conclusions so that we cannot derive true conclusions from false premises. The consequences of the analysis of mathematical knowledge have an important bearing upon the theory of knowledge. Mathematics requires propositions not based on sense experience. If it is argued that mathematical truths are derived by induction, it must be remembered that sense experience can never demonstrate the principle of induction. But sense experience con- cerns the particular and is meaningless aside from the principle of induction. Traditional empiricism is thus refuted, but it does not therefore follow that idealism is true. Idealism-at least every theory derived from Kant-assumes that a priori truths derive their universality from the fact that they express properties of the mind. But general and a priori knowledge must possess the same objectivity that is enjoyed by the particular facts of the physical world. Logic and mathematics force us to admit a certain scholastic realism, the existence of a world of universals, which has subsistence though it does not exist in the same sense as particular objects. We have immediate knowl- edge of a number of propositions about universals: this is an ultimate fact. Pure mathematics, logic, is the resume of all that can be known, directly or by demonstration, about certain universals. J. GREENBERG. NEW YORK CITY. The Influence of the Darwinian Theory on Ethics. RAMSDEN BALMFORTH. Int. J. E., XXI, 4, PP- 448-465. The present generation has come to realize that the theory of evolution does not supplant, but rather deepens, the spiritual and idealistic view of life, that we need the developed for the comprehension of the undeveloped, and that intelligence and ethical purpose are only partially explained by reference to simpler phenomena. Not only have we changed our conceptions of the</page><page sequence="12">686 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW. [VOL. XX. general significance of evolution, but also of the processes involved. Fitness for the struggle for existence no longer means the possession of mere strength or cunning, but just as truly, such qualities as prudence, temperance, fidelity, sympathy, self-sacrifice. Natural selection means, in the case of human beings, the selection of the fittest and best in an environment which shall conduce to the development of more nearly perfect types of life. Since we are not merely products of, but factors in, evolution, it should be the aim of our education and legislation to produce such an environment. If natural selection is to have fair play, all unearned increment should be turned over to the State for such purposes as education. The resulting superior environ- ment would foster a less individualistic and more truly social type of character. Moreover, until we go much further in providing a healthy moral, mental, and physical environment, we should be cautious about replacing natural selection by the rigorous artificial selection advocated by eugenists. Lastly, we must recognize that the survival of the best types is not furthered, but hindered, by international war. J. R. TUTTLE. Schopenhauer as an Evolutionist. ARTHUR 0. LovEJoY. Monist, XXI, 2, PP. I95-222. The various meanings with which Schopenhauer endows the Will fall into two classes. On the negative side, the Will is allied to the thing-in-itself or the Vedantic Absolute, and, like Spencer's Unknowable, forms the dark background of experience, inaccessible to the understanding. On the positive side, it is a power manifested in phenomena, an impetus toward the multiplica- tion and individuation of entities and toward a struggle for survival among the modes of existence. It is with the Will in this second, concrete, and objectified sense that Schopenhauer is more characteristically concerned. The conception of the Will as an eternal striving or becoming might well have lent itself to an evolutionary development, but in his earlier period, we find that Schopenhauer, following his theory of the archetypal essences of phe- nomena, holds to the essential invariability of species. In Der Wille in der Natur, however, while criticizing certain theories of Lamarck, he affirms a belief in the origin of species from one another through descent, on the ground that the homologies manifested by the skeletal structure of various species demand such an hypothesis. In the treatise, Zur Philosophie und Wissenschaft der Natur, i850, Schopenhauer develops a thorough-going evolutionism, the astronomical, geological, and biological features of which may be mainly traced to Laplace, Cuvier and Robert Chambers. A belief is here affirmed in the spontaneous generation of the lower species, in saltatory mutations among the higher, and in the simian descent of man. Certain comparisons may be made between the systems of Schopenhauer and Spencer. In the case of each, an essentially mystical and negative metaphysics forms the background for an evolutionary philosophy of nature. At the same time, Spencer's aim is to represent the whole evolutionary process in terms of the redistribution of matter and change in the direction of motion, while Schopen-</page><page sequence="13">No. 6.] SUMMARIES OF ARTICLES. 687 hauer's evolutionism is characterized by the production of absolute novelties, the attempt being, not to do away with teleology, but to dissociate teleology from anthropomorphism by means of the concept of a blind purposiveness in the Will. J. R. TUTTLE. Reality as a System of Functions. GERALD CATOR. Mind, N. S., XX, 79, pp. 342-357. A function is defined in terms of its independence of its other. All real things are functions, and are real in proportion as they are functionised. All things are also systems of functions, demanding analysis, and elements of functions, demanding synthesis. Functionalism may be proved by showing the relativity and hypothetical character of anything you please, for example, of the given object, or of the ego of the present instant. Even "nothing" is defined by asbtraction from the universe. Functionalism surpasses ordinary Idealism in that it is as clear in its statement and conception of the functional character of the subject as of the object Any possible objection to this view develops into a confirmation of it, for such a doubt is one of the infinite number of partial truths demanding as supplementation for themselves the systematic whole. God is this functional system as a self-conscious Absolute. But his absoluteness embraces our relative views of the world. The plane of the individual mind depends on the comprehensiveness of its syntheses, that is, its proximity to the absolute point of view. Temporal succession is our limited interpretation of God's eternal order. KATHERINE EVERETT. On Some Aspects of Truth. F. H. BRADLEY. Mind, N. S., XX, 79, pp. 305- 342 The charge that such an Idealism as Mr. Bradley's starts from axiomsis due to a misapprehension of its method. Assuming only that we must think, that is, that we must satisfy the mind's theoretical need, it proceeds by means of experiments on reality. For example, that rea ity is a many in one, and that relations are internal and not external, are the results of experiments. The fundamental conclusions thus obtained are that reality is, in general, a me- diated intelligible whole, and is, specifically, experience. This criterion of intellectual satisfaction is more intelligible and successful than the criteria of Darwinism and of Pragmatism. How does this Idealism deal with certain important logical problems? The problem of truth's reference to an object beyond itself is solved by abandoning the abstract separation of the knowing subject and its object. The two are aspects of one reality. The subjective element in any particular judgment is the irrelevant, for a judgment is always an abstraction for a particular purpose. In one sense no judgment transcends itself, for every judgment contains implicitly the whole of reality; yet every judgment does transcend itself in that it reaches toward a reality which it can not explicitly express. The problem whether I may think a truth which has never been thought before is solved by a distinction. As a particular judg-</page><page sequence="14">688 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW. [VOL. XX. ment with its unique context, my truth is new, but as an element in an eternal reality, it was waiting for my discovery. To say that we "make truth" is not only a violation of good usage, but a one-sided emphasis on the aspect of the finite expression of truth. The relation of truth to reality is that of ideal aspect to absolute whole. Truth must always fall short of that perfect grasp of reality which it intends. In no intelligible sense can truth be said to copy reality. Rather it abstracts from reality. Any truth is good in the degree to which it has attained reality. Nothing is good in se but the absolute. This view of truth is subjectivism or relativism only in the sense that there is no truth outside of and beyond finite minds. But there is a real distinction between subjective and objective in terms of this theory. KATHERINE EVERETT. Kausalitdt und Existenz bei Kant. KRISTIAN B. R. AARS. Ar. f. sys. Ph., XVII, 2, pp. I7I-I92. Kant nowhere defines object or external existence. Conceived causally, the latter is to be inferred from its effects through a sort of logical deduction, or it is to be regarded as a purely regulative concept having no reality whatever corresponding to it. Notwithstanding some inconsistencies in his usage, Kant, doubtless, held that the causal category applies to the thing in itself, or objec- tive reality. Of course we should have to ask how that which is timeless can, at the same time, be existent, and effect results in a time order. This question is met by a strange displacement: eternity is substituted for temporal change, but duration still remains. The application of the causal category to phe- nomena is quite as obscure as its application to noumena. Kant gives no definition of the causal concept but takes refuge behind the vague expression of a rule. Existence, in both noumenal and phenomenal forms, is supposed by Kant to be quite independent of causality. This means that causality is an hypothesis furnished by the understanding, and by no means on a par with existence. But, as the abiding elements in phenomena-atoms, material stuff, etc., are really noumenal, how can we predicate causes of our transient experiences? The answer is, only in a pragmatic way. Transitory experiences really have their causes in the things in themselves conceived through hy- potheses in the legitimacy of which we believe. They are the real, unknowable truth, whereas the phenomena are the unreal, but pragmatic form of truth. Kant may, therefore, be called a pragmatist. There is a strong empirical element also to be found in him. Over against the latter, however, stands the a priori element in which is included the old concept of an innate property of the soul. This has its roots in the notion of soul faculties, the existence of which can be known only by their effects, i. e., through the application of the category of Causality. Otherwise a dualism results, in which an earth-spirit is placed over against the highest God. Objective reality or noumenon would be identical with the latter, and the world of experience would be an appear- ance in the consciousness of the earth-spirit. Objective reality, according to Kant, cannot be spacially extended, because everywhere and always we</page><page sequence="15">No. 6.] SUMMARIES OF ARTICLES. 689 come upon the spacially extended, and all our expectations are formed to that end. But this is no reason at all. If one should suddenly be translated into a spaceless world, he could only say that his a priori certainty of space intuition had deceived him. MARK E.
