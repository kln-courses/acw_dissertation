<plain_text><page sequence="1">Of "Barren Islands" and "Cursed Gold": Worth, Value, and Womanhood in The Sea Voyage GITANJALI SHAHANI ABSTRACT 7his essay takes up the two original plot lines of The Sea Voyage: one involves a group of pseudo Amazons, formerly Portuguese women, now gone native on an abandoned island; the other con cerns a pile of gold, also abandoned on the island. Both, it would seem, have little use value, re moved as they are from the circuits of exchange and intercourse that govern the civilized world. Thus both are at the center of a larger crisis of meaning that forms the subject of the play—a crisis that can be resolved only through the timely intervention of male venturers. In its dramatization of this crisis, John Fletcher and Philip Massinger's island romance appears to emerge from and engage with a very particular set of economic debates from the 1620s concerning English overseas trade and its renegotiation of the terms of worth, valuation, and exchange in the domestic realm. Us island logic, borne out by the crises of its people and materials, derives from questions about metal—its intrinsic value and its exchange value—which had become especially fraught during the 1620s in the wake of the developing East India trade. Since it was first performed at the Globe Theater in 1622, The Sea Voyage has been repeatedly and unfavorably compared with its more well-known source, The Tempest.' Samuel Pepys was among the first to make these dispar aging comparisons, noting in his diary that he went to see a "so-so" play called The Storme (a Restoration title for The Sea Voyage), but "without much plea sure, it being but a mean play compared with Doe Tempest" (qtd. in Bentley 413). It is John Dryden's verdict, however, that echoes the most frequent grouse against John Fletcher and Philip Massinger's island romance: that it could not THE JOURNAL FOR EARLY MODERN CULTURAL STUDIES VOL. 12, NO. 3 (SUMMER 2012) © 2012</page><page sequence="2">6 The Journal for Early Modern Cultural Studies ♦ 12:3 replicate the magic of Shakespeare's play, nor could it match the magic in Shakespeare's play: The Storm which vanish'd on the Neighb'ring shore, Was taught by Shakespear's Tempest first to roar. That innocence and beauty which did smile In Fletcher, grew on this Enchanted Isle. But Shakespear's Magick could not copy'd be. (qtd. in Bentley 414) From its opening scene depicting a storm at sea, to its island setting, to its in clusion of a Miranda-like virgin who has never looked upon a man, the play wrights' debt to Shakespeare is apparent. But The Sea Voyage has neither Pros pero nor his "rough magic" to control the island's natural elements; there is neither an obliging Ariel nor a defiant Caliban to do the castaways' bidding. As Zachary Lesser sums it up: "no colonial fantasy of magically enforced work disturbs this island's barrenness" (895). In fact, contrary to early assertions, the "island logic" (to borrow Roland Greene's phrase) in each of these plays is radi cally different, with the magus allowing for the illusion of control and habit ability in one play, and his absence in the other play calling attention to the hardships of the liminal space that is the island. "Islands make possible the observation of their own constructedness," Greene argues, "because they enforce a certain clarity: they have definable borders, they are conceptually autonomous from the world at large, and they encourage attention to the conditions of indigeneity and importation." Situ ated as such, island plays afford a vantage point from which to view the machi nations of capital: "Suddenly, in the light of island logic, the exertions with which capital fashions a world according to its own unquestioned values come to look like exertions; we are encouraged to notice the trail of investment that furnishes the island with people and materials ..." (Greene 140). The crisis of The Sea Voyage, I argue here, is precisely the stasis of its people and materials, specifically in this case of the Amazons and the gold. It is through these enti ties that we are invited to speculate on what Greene calls "the conditions of indigeneity and importation." The omission of magic, which might harness them into a productive relation, is by all counts essential to the dramatization of this crisis. In fact, its conspicuous absence makes possible the play's two original plot lines, which form the focus of my argument: one involves a group of pseudo-Amazons, formerly Portuguese women, now gone native on an</page><page sequence="3">Shahani ♦ Of "Barren Islands" and "Cursed Gold" abandoned island; the other concerns a pile of gold, also abandoned on the is land. Both, it would seem, have little use value, removed as they are from the circuits of exchange and intercourse that govern the civilized world. Thus both are at the center of a larger crisis of meaning that forms the subject of the play—a crisis that can be resolved only through the timely intervention of male venturers rather than magicians. In its dramatization of this crisis, The Sea Voyage appears to emerge from and engage with a very particular set of economic debates in the 1620s concern ing English overseas trade and its renegotiation of the terms of worth, valua tion, and exchange in the domestic realm. Fletcher and Massinger's play sheds the fascination with possible Utopias in "brave new worlds" in order to take up a more abstract vision of a colonial economy, grounded in an idea of global trade and circulation rather than the conquest of lands. If the occasional court ier dreams of "new lands and lordships in new countries" (1.1.117), his fantasy is quickly rendered redundant by the barren island's peoples and materials that necessitate a different model of mercantile intervention. In this sense the geo graphical and geopolitical terrains that The Sea Voyage charts are quite unlike the ones in The Tempest. While critics such as Gordon McMullan have tended to map these terrains in the New World and consequently read the play's crisis in relation to debates surrounding the Virginia Company, it is worth noting, as Michael Neill does, that "Fletcher takes almost as much care as Shakespeare to divorce his 'desart [sic] Islands' from any identifiable New World setting" (102). My own argu ment rests not so much on identifying the precise coordinates of the island nor on refuting its New World setting; rather, I follow Jean Feerick's suggestion that "the obfuscation of geography" (29) is essential to the play's central prob lematic—its starving islanders, its pile of gold, and the unviable nature of con sumption and regeneration in this space. However, in articulating this prob lematic, I diverge from McMulIan's emphasis on the politics of the Virginia Company, turning instead to England's East India trade and the ensuing con troversies about its export of precious metals in order to analyze the play's original plot and its unique preoccupation with the dormant pile of gold. This is not to suggest that the play's nameless island is located in the East Indies or in one of the Spice Islands that Fletcher had chosen as a setting for The Island Princess, published in 1621. Its island logic, borne out by the crises of its people and materials, simply derives from questions about metal—its intrinsic value and its exchange value—which had become especially fraught during the 1620s in the wake of the developing East India trade.</page><page sequence="4">8 The Journal for Early Modern Cultural Studies ♦ 12:3 In particular, the East India Company's steady exportation of bullion (for which the Company had obtained an exception to the law prohibiting the same) and its importation of foreign commodities had sparked a series of heated debates about the implications of long-distance trade for England's na tional wealth. The Company's adoption of what K. N. Chaudhury has called a "triangular trade" (8) meant that it exported bullion in order to import pepper, spices, calico, and indigos from the East Indies, all of which were sold in Euro pean countries and the Middle East in exchange for more bullion, which in turn formed the basis for further investment in Asian enterprises. The fact that there was no vent for English commodities in Asian markets, the simulta neous consumption of East Indian wares in England, and the belief that such a trade had drained the economy of its reserves resulted in a vehement attack on the Company, most frequently voiced in the pamphleteering wars of the 1620s and most frequently countered in the writings of Company officials like Thomas Mun. The "clamorous complaints" (3) against this trade, as Mun had put it, all dwelt on the apparent loss of precious metals: "The gold, silver, and Coyne of Christendome, and particularly of this Kingdome, is exhausted, to buy unnecessary wares" (5). What was achieved through the export of bullion and the import of foreign wares? How could this trade bring about gain if it meant that England's precious metal was sent out of England? How could loss possibly be profitable? As Valerie Forman explains, "While 'investment seems an entirely natural concept today in our stock-owning culture, it was a concept that needed to be theorized and debated in the early modern period" (4). This process of debate and theorization in the 1620s constitutes one of the earliest discussions of England's economic and foreign policies, and it is likely to have been current when Fletcher and Massinger conceived the colonial set ting for their island romance.2 The economic abstractions at the center of early-seventeenth-century debates are rendered actual in the dilemmas posed by locating the gold and the women on their unnamed island: the precious metal on the island has no more use value if it lies in heaps on the land than do the women on the neighboring island, who lie in desperate need of intercourse; both, it would seem, must circulate within a larger economy of exchange. Al though it would be erroneous to think of The Sea Voyage as a simplistic piece of propaganda for Company apologists like Mun, the seemingly abstract and unfathomable aspects of global intercourse, balance of trade, exchange value, and use value that emerged in the context of the East India trade are tested through the crises surrounding the peoples and materials of Fletcher and Massinger's island romance.</page><page sequence="5">Shahani ♦ Of "Barren Islands" and "Cursed Gold" First printed in the 1647 Folio of Beaumont and Fletcher's works, it was not until the 1679 Folio that The Sea Voyage received a title page of its own, on which it was listed as "A Comedy." Subsequent discussions of the play accu rately refer to it as an island romance, both in relation to its Shakespearean source as well as in relation to Fletcher's earlier play, The Island Princess. Yet, as the title of Lesser's essay on the play appositely suggests, its generic categoriza tion is a complex matter, with its plot simultaneously "Tragical-Comical-Pas toral-Colonial." Largely pastoral in its origins, Lesser notes that it is in the 1620s that tragicomedy shifts away from the homely and familiar environs of the English countryside to the more exotic sites of England's new trading out posts and colonies in the Levant, the East Indies, and the New World. For Lesser, as for Forman, such a shift is indicative of the inevitable trajectory of the tragicomic plot that moves both thematically and structurally from loss to resolution and redemption: unlike comedy, "the story told, then is not just all's well that ends well,' but all becomes better than it was before" (Forman 6). Such logic accounts both for the European presence in these trading outposts and islands as well as the desired outcome of investments therein—to make all "better than it was before." No doubt, the wretched gallants of The Sea Voyage are at first unlikely candidates for creating such an outcome, their initial plight recalling a more tragic aspect of earlier settlement. Yet the plot is able to effect such a transformation and redemption, turning gallants into venturers and the island's dormant materials into a kind of circulating currency. Thus the is land's crisis is averted and "all becomes better than it was before." "The Centric Part" Before elaborating on the crisis in the play's schema, I wish to briefly turn to a larger economic problem that plagued a number of Fletcher and Massinger's predecessors and contemporaries—one concerning the worth and value of gold and the relationship between its actual and symbolic value. In particular, the slippage between its intrinsic value as metal and its nominal value as coinage simultaneously confounded and fascinated several early modern writers. Recall in The Merchant of Venice, for instance, Shakespeare's portrayal of the Prince of Morocco, who in many ways provides us more insight into the errors of The Sea Voyage's gallants than the gallants of The Tempest do. Portia's hapless suitor is by no means central to my argument. But his error is. In choosing the gold casket, the misguided prince conflates its external form with its intrinsic value,</page><page sequence="6">io The Journal for Early Modern Cultural Studies ♦ 12:3 which in turn he construes as a sign of Portia's inherent worth. Throughout he is deluded by the notion that the symbolic meaning of each casket is manifest in its materiality. The prince begins by contemplating the lead container but quickly dismisses it as mere "dross" (2.6.20).' After all, "dull lead" (2.7.8) cannot be a signifier of real worth, he insists. He then lingers over the other two caskets, enamored by the precious metals in which they are wrought. In articulating his final choice, he resorts to a numismatic metaphor: They have in England A coin that bears the figure of an angel Stamped in gold, but that's insculped upon; But here an angel in a golden bed Lies all within. Deliver me the key. Here I do choose, and thrive I as I may. (2.7.55-60) The prince's comparison, as Mark Netzloff argues, would seem to be an appro priate one since "the angel was one of the few coins whose rate of valuation re mained stable, and even increased slightly during the Tudor period" (163). But Morocco's choice, as we know, will not be validated by the play. The gold casket leaves him with no more than a written scroll with the oft-quoted maxim— "All that glisters is not gold" (2.7.65)—and an everlasting injunction against venturing after any female prize. In essence, Morocco is punished for his er roneous reading of signs. He equates external markers with intrinsic meaning, and for this misreading he is eliminated from the transnational gathering of suitors in Belmont, who hazard all they have to win Portia and her treasure. But Morocco's dilemma is not a unique one. The problem, as Foucault has shown, was one that had to do with the organization of signs and monetary discourse in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. For early Renaissance economists (as for Morocco), "fine metal was, of itself, a mark of wealth; its buried brightness was sufficient indication that it was at the same time a hid den presence and a visible signature of all the wealth of the world" (Foucault 174). Gold, in particular, was a sign of wealth insofar as it was wealth. "It pos sessed the power to signify because it was itself a real mark" (169), Foucault argues. Fixing its value as money (marking it and stamping it as such) was thus predicated upon on an absolute correspondence between the quantity of pre cious metal and its nominal value, which in turn was defined in terms of a fur ther correlation: between coinage and the commodities for which it could be</page><page sequence="7">Shahani ♦ Of "Barren Islands" and "Cursed Gold" exchanged.4 In this respect, gold belonged to a larger system of signification in which meanings were constituted through resemblances. To recognize gold as a monetary sign was to know its value as metal corresponded to a determinate quantity of a commodity, whose value would be determined in relation to some other commodity. This endless similitude structured modes of understanding in the Renais sance, so that the knowledge of nature and the knowledge of monetary prac tices were configured by one and the same episteme during this period. Thus, for instance, the sixteenth-century thinker Bernardo Davanzati conceived of a perfect congruence between all things that man desired and the sum total of gold that was buried in the bowels of the earth. For Davanzati, this absolute correspondence was part of a divinely ordained design. In his Discourse Upon Coins (1588), he made the following declaration: Nature made all terrestrial things good; the sum of these, by virtue of the agreement concluded by men, is worth all the gold that is worked; all men therefore desire everything in order to acquire all things ... In order to ascertain each day the rule and mathematical proportions that exist be tween things and between them and gold, we should have to be able to contemplate, from the height of heaven or some very tall observatory, all the things that exist or are done on earth, or rather their images repro duced and reflected in the sky as in a faithful mirror. We would then aban don our calculations and we would say: there is upon earth so much gold, so many things, so many men, so many needs; and to the degree that each thing satisfies needs its value shall be so many things, or so much gold, (qtd. in Foucault 172) This "celestial and exhaustive calculation" (173), to use Foucault's phrase, is fundamental to Renaissance economic thought. The value of gold is deter mined through a natural scale; its "price," its exchangeability, and its role as a standard of measure are in accordance with all terrestrial things that exist to satisfy human wants and needs. The microcosm and the macrocosm are envi sioned as existing together in a cosmically orchestrated harmony. But this configuration of meaning would change during the course of the seventeenth century, particularly as a result of new modes of signification that took shape in the writings of so-called "mercantilists" like Thomas Mun and Edward Misselden. Neither would identify themselves as belonging to a</page><page sequence="8">Thejournal for Early Modern Cultural Studies • 12:3 mercantilist school of thought. In fact, as Jonathan Gil Harris has shown, the term "mercantilism" is highly problematic, even anachronistic, when used with regard to the "four Ms"—Mun, Misselden, Gerard Malynes, and Thomas Milles—all of whom were seminal economic thinkers in the seventeenth century, but never wrote as part of a systematic collective or doctrine.5 Harris locates in their work the emergence of a recognizably modern conception of the nation and its economy, but insists it was not until the nineteenth century that they were variously classified as mercantilists, proto-capitalists, and early proponents of free trade.6 Their writings are not so much a manifesto for an emerging mercantile system as they are a series of debates about England's foreign trade and its implications for England's national treasure. Mun, arguably the most influential among the four, penned his treatise as part of an elaborate defense of the East India Company (EIC), after it was repeatedly accused of draining the body politic of its gold and silver reserves. Entitled A Discourse of Trade from England unto the East-Indies (1621), Mun's treatise sought to debunk the idea that metal was in and of itself precious to a nation; rather, it was through its exchange function that it acquired meaning and value. Gold was precious because it was money and because it could buy things, not the converse. Thus "the relation so strictly laid down in the sixteenth century is forthwith reversed: money (and even the metal of which it is made) receives its value from its pure function as sign" (Foucault 176). It is not without significance that this reversal of meaning came about as a result of the commercial practices associated with the EIC, which had been founded by a royal charter in 1600. As historians like Chaudhuri have argued, the EIC was unlike any trading company that preceded it, insofar as it func tioned not by finding a vent for English commodities in foreign markets but by making profits of its imports. It developed a complex multilateral trading sys tem, buying spices and other commodities from the Indian subcontinent in exchange for bullion; these commodities were then sent back to England and sold there or re-exported to Europe and the Levant to acquire the necessary bullion with which the cycle would begin again. In this unique form of trade, money was transformed into wares, which were then transformed into profits. But Mun and other EIC officials repeatedly found themselves fending off accusations that this trade was unprofitable to the kingdom of England as a whole, even though it filled the coffers of those involved in the Company, pri marily because this kind of foreign commerce depleted the sum total of bul lion in the body politic. In response, Mun argued that as long as there was a</page><page sequence="9">Shahani ♦ Of "Barren Islands" and "Cursed Gold" 13 favorable balance of trade—i.e., as long as English imports did not exceed English exports—there could not be a net loss of coin. Interestingly, while putting forth this argument, Mun attributes the same power to wares that he does to bullion. Both are vested with purchasing power, so that the acquisition of one does not imply the loss or depletion of the other: [T]here is the same power in these Indian wares, to procure other sommes of ready moneyes, to be brought into this kingdome: For let no man doubt, but that money doth attend Merchandize, for money is the price of wares, and wares are the proper use of money; so that their Coherence is unseparable. (26) Mun proposes a circular model in which money buys Indian wares, which in turn procure more money. Coin and commodity fuse together in an "unsepa rable" coherence. The commodity comes to be imbued with the same value as coin and therefore has the power to obtain more commodities, a power that was hitherto seen as vested only in coin. For Foucault, this "mercantilist" model has important consequence vis-a-vis the meaning of things: for now "the value of things will no longer proceed from the metal itself; it establishes itself by it self, without reference to the coinage, according to the criteria of utility, plea sure, or rarity" (176). What we have in Mun's theory, then, is an interesting precursor to Marx's notion of the commodity fetish. Forman astutely notes this connection, point ing out that Mun's "anthropomorphic and idolatrous language seems strik ingly similar to Marx's," or in more historically accurate terms, "Marx's lan guage recalls Mun's" ("Transformations of Value" 616). But whereas Marx's "prosopopoeial animation of commodities" (616) is figurative, even ironic, Mun's attribution of power to commodities and the accumulation of capital through them is configured in more literal terms. "They that want wares can not want mony" (41), Mun pithily declares in his treatise England's Treasure by Foreign Trade (1664). One is forever transformable into the other: For it is in the stock of the Kingdom as in the estate of private men, who having store of wares, doe not say that they will not venture out or trade with their mony... but do also turn that into wares, whereby they multiply their Mony, and so by a continual and orderly change of one into the other grow rich, and when they please turn all their estates into Treasure. (41)</page><page sequence="10">14 The Journal for Early Modern Cultural Studies ♦ 12:3 While for Marx, "transformation is a means of representing the 'mystified' way that exchange elides how capital (i.e. unpaid labor as surplus value) is actually produced" (Forman 167), Mun, Forman writes, offers the transformative power of wares as an "explanation of how expenditures do not produce losses but instead allow for accumulation" (167). For the latter, the commodity is itself a form of capital. In grappling with these new forms of valuation, a number of seventeenth century writers turned to a gendered system of signification in which gold and women, their exchange value and their use value, were computed in like terms. In their works, the emergent notion of the commodity fetish is calibrated through a kind of sexual fetish—specifically through the fetishization of the female anatomy. Of course, the conflation of the erotic and economic is by no means unique to this moment. In The Merchant of Venice, for instance, Portia clinches her exchange with Bassanio by handing over her ring to the victorious suitor. In a gesture that has long been read as a symbolic offering of her vagina to Bassanio, Portia grants him sole possession of her most valuable commodity.7 The ring's constant circulation, while providing much comic relief in the play's final act, also suggests the multiple ways in which Portia is configured as a highly fetishized commodity in its economies of exchange. Until the final scene, she is represented as a much sought-after commodity, drawing venturers from "every coast" of "the wide world" (1.2.167-68). Anticipating Mun's "Treasure" even before Mun actually wrote his treatise, Portia is rendered valuable through a cross-cultural circuit of exchange. But why does capital accrue, as it were, through the circulation of the female body? Why does the vagina or "the centric part," to use Donne's term for it, become a key site for the articulation of emerging notions of value?8 The most interesting answer is perhaps to be found in Donne's "Elegy 18: Love's Progress," which goes a step further than The Merchant of Venice in its emphasis on use value: just as money in the new mercantilist schema derives worth from its circulation and exchange, the female body (metonymically invoked through the female genitalia) has value insofar as it is available for intercourse. The gendered troping that is only implicit in Shakespeare's dramatization of exchange becomes much more overt as we progress further into the seventeenth century. "Prefer one woman first, and then one thing in her," the poet persona of Donne's elegy instructs his reader, using gold as an analogy for the weighing and measuring of her worth:</page><page sequence="11">Shahani « Of "Barren Islands" and "Cursed Gold" 15 I, when I value gold, may think upon The ductileness, the application, The wholesomeness, the ingenuity But if I love it, 'tis because 'tis made By our new nature, use, the soul of trade. All these in women we might think upon (If women had them) and yet love but one. (10-18) Donne thus starts out by invoking older modes of valuation. We might prize gold for its external qualities—its ductility, its wholesomeness, or its purity— but to do so would be like loving a woman simply for her beauty, her wealth, or her virtue (if indeed she has any). Such a love is meaningless, even passionless, in the poet's view: "May barren angels love so" (23), he declares dismissively. A woman's worth and value are not to be found in these superfluous qualities. "He that strays thus / From her to hers, is more adulterous / Than if he took her maid" (26-27), the poet insists. The distinction between "her" and "hers" is a crucial one, of course, and to mistake one for the other is tantamount to be trayal. Her attributes are merely external; they are simply "hers," but they do not constitute "her." Finding "her" is a more complex endeavor and involves searching the "pits and holes" (32) of her being. In essence, she is her vagina. Her desirability is predicated upon the availability and the usability of this "centric part." What we have here is the ultimate literalization of the mercantilist argu ment. Donne has alerted us to its principal tenets from the very outset of the poem. "[OJur new nature"—evidently an allusion to contemporary controver sies about commodity and coinage—has rendered older modes of signification redundant. For now, it is "use" that constitutes meaning. Indeed, "use" is the very "soul of trade," the poet affirms, recalling Mun's prioritization of exchange value over intrinsic value. Donne thus playfully takes the mercantilist perspec tive to its logical extreme, suggesting that womanhood (like everything else in the economies of exchange during that period) must be defined entirely in terms of exchange value and use value, rather than external markers or physical form. This recurrence of pecuniary tropes and mercantile imagery in Donne's verse has drawn attention from several critics. Coburn Freer argues that Donne was "one of the first English poets to sense the vast economic changes coming</page><page sequence="12">16 The Journal for Early Modern Cultural Studies ♦ 12:3 over Europe in general and England in particular, and the first to work them into the understanding of intellectual experience" (5). According to Freer, Donne seemed to have sensed most acutely that "within his lifetime, money it self had become a commodity" (25). Particularly significant from my point of view is the fact that this understanding of gold as money, money as commodity, and commodity as fetishized object, has a fourth vector in "Love's Progress": the fetishized object (invoked through "the centric part") is configured as dis tinctly Indian. For as the poem progresses, we are given a cartographic layout of the woman's body—a virtual map for "sailing towards her India" (65). The most useful, the most valuable, and the most "centric part" thus takes on a distinctly geographical character that results from Donne's articulation of pecuniary tropes in relation to the East India trade. Although at times ironic in its tone, the poem nevertheless revels in the new modes of signification resulting from England's commercial expansion and its transition to a colonial economy. On Fletcher and Massinger's "Wretched" Island While Donne's citations of Mun and the East India trade are much more ex plicit than those we find in The Sea Voyage, Fletcher and Massinger's island play consistently engages with the mercantilist position and is as concerned with articulating this position through a preoccupation with woman's "centric part." The play's celebration of global commerce, however, is much more muted than Donne's. In fact, Anthony Parr, the play's most recent editor, has argued that Fletcher and Massinger betray a distinct "antipathy to the entire [colonial] enterprise—a feeling that was, incidentally, widespread in London's mercantile community when he wrote the play" (24). Likewise, McMullan has read the play as a stringent critique of venturing, a dystopian vision of New World conquest gone horribly wrong.J At first glance, this would certainly seem to be the case. The play begins with a group of displaced European gal lants, stranded on a "barren" and "wretched" island.10 They long for the famil iar markers of the civilized world—"our blessed homes," "our kindreds," "our families" (1.3.34-35)—but the island offers none. While abundant in gold, it has neither food nor water, and the shipwrecked voyagers are driven to starva tion and near cannibalism. They become, as it were, the natives of an island that is visibly lacking any original inhabitants of its own. Their hardships ob viously recall those of English planters in Virginia, who similarly struggled with starvation and acculturation in seemingly hostile climes. Yet, as I will</page><page sequence="13">Shahani ♦ Of "Barren Islands" and "Cursed Gold" 17 show, the play is decidedly not a critique of early modern colonial ventures. Rather, it endorses a mercantile model of colonial intervention that was mark edly absent in early discourses of New World conquest, but one that would be central to English contact with the East. Such contact, while grounded in economic interests, does not preclude co lonial interests that were vested not so much in the conquest of lands, but of markets and goods. As Ania Loomba has noted, trade and colonialism in the period were "not entirely discrete practices" and while "sixteenth-century Eu ropean advocates of overseas trade invoked it, as indeed such advocates do now in our era of rampant globalization, as a relation of perfect reciprocity, neither in the sixteenth century, nor today, has global trade been established through simple mutuality" (42). The disavowal of territorial conquest and settlement in favor of a mercantile model in The Sea Voyage need not inevitably lead us to conclude that the play puts forth an implicit critique of the colonial project. Nor should a reading of the play in the context of the EIC rather than the Vir ginia Company necessarily mark a shift in focus from the colonial to the purely mercantile. Of course, the former was not yet a colonial force and its presence on the Indian subcontinent in the seventeenth century does not suggest an in evitable and seamless trajectory to the British Raj in the nineteenth century. But historians like Sudipta Sen have emphasized the need to "treat the period of Company rule as the initial and perhaps crucial phase of colonial expansion" (4), rather than studying colonial rule in India solely from the perspective of the Raj. To return our focus to The Sea Voyage, though, we might ground the play more specifically in the debates of the 1620s if we attempt to grasp the shift in the early modern understanding of the colonial imperative as mercantile im perative—rather than eschewing it altogether. For the play's mercantile vision upholds a new merchant adventurer as the model for the furthering of another kind of global exchange that Fletcher and Massinger saw as fundamental to the colonial enterprise. Not surprisingly, it is the gold on the barren island that becomes the locus of this mercantilist discourse. When they first come upon this treasure, the shipwrecked crew members are jubilant. Their enthusiasm is reminiscent of a naive Columbus-like determination to discover gold in the "uninhabited" is lands of the New World. "His very prayer had become: 'Our Lord in his good ness guide me that I may find this gold " (8), Tzvetan Todorov remarks of the Spanish explorer's obsession. Nearly every entry in Columbus's journal and letters returned to the chimerical treasure. "I was attentive and worked hard to</page><page sequence="14">18 The Journal for Early Modern Cultural Studies ♦ 12:3 know if there was any gold," he notes on October 13,1492, the very day follow ing his discovery. Two days later he is impatient again: "I do not wish to delay but to discover and to go to many islands to find gold." His very route is deter mined by it—"I decided to go to the southwest to search for gold and precious stones" (qtd. in Todorov 8)—and he wanders from island to island in his quest for it. Such is the folly of European gallants in The Sea Voyage as well. Sebastian, an older Portuguese venturer stranded on the island, warns them of its dangers. "This gold was the overthrow of my happiness" (1.3.175), he tells Albert, the captain commanding the French fleet. For if the island is plen tiful in "this damned enticing" substance (1.3.221), it is spare in every other re spect, providing little sustenance to its inhabitants. When Albert inquires after meat, Sebastian offers an elaborate, if somewhat verbose, expatiation on the nature of hunger and lack on an island that appears to have been aban doned by nature itself: Nor meat nor quiet; No summer here to promise anything, Nor autumn to make full the reaper's hands. The earth, obdurate to the tears of heaven, Lets nothing shoot but poisoned weeds. No rivers, nor no pleasant groves; no beasts. All that were made for man's use fly this desert; No airy fowl dares make his flight over it. It is so ominous. Sometimes we find a fulsome sea-root And that's a delicate! A rat sometimes, And that we hunt like princes in their pleasure. And when we take a toad, we make a banquet. (1.3.134-47) But where even the rat or the toad can provide fleshy sustenance, the "goodly quarries" of gold are too "hard to gnaw" (3.1.16-18). Yet, with the notable excep tion of Albert and Tibalt, all the French gallants are gulled by its brilliance. As they fall to fighting over it, Sebastian and his companion escape with the French vessel, leaving the entire crew without any means for fleeing the island. In what follows, we witness a series of bizarre episodes in which the intrinsic worthlessness of the glittering metal is cruelly brought home to the gallants.</page><page sequence="15">Shahani ♦ Of "Barren Islands" and "Cursed Gold" 19 Significantly, it is not so much the traditional moral injunctions against lucre that propel the plot forward. Instead, it is the simple lack of use value associ ated with the hard, inedible substance that haunts the castaways on the barren island. Thus it is that the gallants are reduced to consuming spoonfuls of mud and rotten trunks of trees. They long for the surgeon's "old suppository" (3.1.38) and "cooling glister" (3.1.43) left behind on the vessel, for even those would make more "dainty dishes" (3.1.39) than the adamantine metal. In essence, it is consumption—or more importantly, the lack thereof— that appears to be the source of the island's biggest crisis. In detailing this cri sis, Fletcher and Massinger allude to a crisis closer home, one that Mun had outlined in his treatise only a year before the play was performed. An excess of bullion chasing far too few goods would only spell doom for the English isle. Privateering by itself, for the sake of gold and glory, would achieve little. Rather, the begetting of goods by way of gold was the only means of enhancing the na tion's treasure. As Mun had put it, "Money is the price of wares, and wares the proper use of money" (25). In turn, wares were procured through trade, not through the idle accumulation of gold and coin. Thus it is that Tibalt mocks his countrymen's fetishization of coin over commodity, of substance over sustenance. As Franville, the play's vainglorious gallant, complains about being "hungry," "hurt," and "weary" (1.3.239), Tibalt taunts him with the gold: Here's a pestle of a portigue, sir; Tis excellent meat with sour sauce. And here's two chains—suppose em sausages. Then there wants mustard; but the fearful surgeon Will supply ye presently. (1.3.237-41) The "portigue," as Parr's gloss to this speech suggests, was a Portuguese coin, worth around three to five sovereigns. But, as Parr's note for line 237 of this passage states, the "pestle of portigue" in Tibalt's speech simultaneously al ludes to a "hunk of gold" and "a pestle of pork" or a "gammon" (155). Through this merciless play on words, Tibalt drives home an important point about the absolute meaninglessness of gold and coin when they cannot be converted into food and commodity. His scatalogical suggestion that the surgeon's bowel movements, active as a result of fear, will supply a fitting substitute for mustard</page><page sequence="16">20 The Journal for Early Modern Cultural Studies ♦ 12:3 only serves to underscore the degenerate plight of a people, driven to starvation through their flawed understanding of value and consumption. But the ultimate degeneration of the gallants is to be seen in their act of near cannibalism. No longer able to contain their appetites, they close in on Aminta, the noble French virgin, who was both abducted and rescued by Albert in the play's prehistory and thus remains stranded on the island with the French crew. As Albert goes in search of food, they seize the opportunity to feed on her flesh, citing the authority of travelogues for their "barbarous" act (3.1.136): MORI LLAT. I have read stories— LAMURE. Of such restoring meats: we have examples. Thousand examples and allowed for excellent. Women that have eat their children, men their slaves; Nay, their brothers. But these are nothing: Husbands devoured their wives (they are their chattels), And of a schoolmaster that in a time of famine Powdered up all his scholars ... SURGEON. But to suck out the humourous parts, by all means Let's kill her in a chase, she'll eat the sweeter. LAMURE. Let's kill her any way, and kill her quickly That we might be at our meat. (3.93-108) In a strange reworking of the threats that typically attach themselves to an unaccompanied virgin, we find the gallants literally lusting after her flesh. They appear to be well acquainted with English myths describing the behavior of men in the Jamestown colony, who allegedly ate their women for want of food, and are ready to follow this example." If Aminta is saved from this group of European cannibals, it is only because Tibalt is able to convince them that she has a different kind of use value. "Spare the woman to beget more food on" (3-I55)/ Tibalt suggests, albeit mockingly. It is thus her generative power that will save them from further degeneration. Indeed the dual themes of generation and degeneration, as Feerick has co gently argued, inform The Sea Voyage as a whole. As the play progresses, we are taken to a neighboring island, where it is a group of Amazonian women who gradually degenerate, not because they lack food, but because they lack the means to generate. Crocale, easily the lustiest of them all, explains their plight: "[we] have among ourselves a commonwealth / Which in ourselves begun, with</page><page sequence="17">Shahani ♦ Of "Barren Islands" and "Cursed Gold" us must end" (2.2.17-18). It is a different kind of starvation that they endure, and they often speak of feeding their appetites with the help of their imagina tion. In doing so, they mark themselves as distinctly "pagan": HIPPOLITA. For my part, I confess it. I was not made For this single life, nor do I love hunting so But that I had rather be the chase myself! CROCALE I am of that mind too, wench. And though I have ta'en an oath, not alone To detest but never to think of man, Every hour something tells me I am forsworn. For I confess, imagination helps me sometimes, And that's all is left for us to feed on; We might starve else! For if I have any pleasure In this life but when I sleep, I am a pagan. Then, from the courtier to the country clown, I have strange visions. (2.2.33-46) Left on the island without men, the Portuguese women have taken on the rites and customs of the island's original Amazons who are now dead, the play sug gests, through the natural destiny awaiting an all-female society. While there is only an implicit allusion to their homoerotic practices (Roselia, the Amazon queen compels them to find happiness in the "cold chaste / Embraces of each other" [3.21-22]), it is their autoerotic practices that the play dwells upon ex tensively. Feeding off themselves—for their own imagination is all that's "left for us to feed on"—they are, in a manner of speaking, as cannibalistic as the men on the neighboring island. Their pressing need to be "entranced" is voiced by Crocale, who conjures up an image of herself as lying awake at nights, awaiting intercourse: CROCALE. The last night.... As I lay in my cabin, betwixt sleeping and waking— HIPPOLITA. Upon your back? CROCALE. How should a young maid lie, fool, When she would be entranced? HIPPOLITA. We are instructed. Forward, I prithee. (2.2.49-53)</page><page sequence="18">Thejournal for Early Modern Cultural Studies ♦ 12:3 Crocale goes on to narrate yet another nocturnal fantasy, "a pretty dream," in which she can feel the touch of a youth, who with "trembling hands" (3.2.63) disrobes her. Like the unruly gallants on the barren island, the women on the fertile island are also defined by their appetites. In crucial ways, their island is as barren as the neighboring one. Both are endowed with "treasures" that lie dormant and unused, driving those who possess them to desperate and uncivi lized measures. The resolution, no doubt, is close at hand. Trade between the islands is likely to solve both sets of problems and sate the all-consuming desires of both parties. The gallants, now realizing that the gold is valuable only insofar as it has purchasing power, gladly tender it as currency in exchange for food and possibly sex from the Amazons. In turn, the Amazon queen, who has thus far curbed the other women from sharing their wares with men, informs the men that their "wants shall be supplied" (3.1.258). Both gold and woman are just about to be put to their appropriate use, when the contingencies of the plot momentarily intervene, delaying the pleasures of consumption. The nature of the tragicomic romance demands that this bargain be couched in the structures of marriage. Thus it is that the scene of copulation is averted. But only until the gender im balances that have resulted from island life are inverted and restored. For if barrenness has emboldened the women, starvation has enfeebled the men in the play. Tibalt informs the Amazons, "We are unprofitable, and our ploughs are broken. / There is no hope of harvest this year, ladies" (4.3.36-37), obviously alluding to his own and his compatriots' impotent state. Elsewhere, Morrillat speaks of how their debilitation has rendered him feminine. "My belly's / Grown together like an empty satchel" (3.13—14), he complains in a mo ment of irrepressible hunger, configuring his stomach as a kind of vacant womb. In Albert, the signs of womanhood are more explicitly spelled out. As Aminta tends to his open, gaping wounds, he worries about their reversal of roles: ALBERT. Do not add To my afflictions by your tender pities. Sure we have changed sexes: you bear calamity With a fortitude would become a man; I like a weak girl suffer. (2.1.5-8) Aminta, while continuing to nurse him, does little to allay these anxieties, al most reinforcing them in a speech that constructs Albert as ridden with ori fices—orifices that only she can fill with the liquids of her body:</page><page sequence="19">Shahani ♦ Of "Barren Islands" and "Cursed Gold" 23 AMINTA. O, but your wounds How fearfully they gape! And every one To me is a sepulchre. If I loved truly— Wise men affirm that true love can do wonders— This bated in my warm tears would soon be cured And leave no orifice behind. Pray give me leave To play the surgeon and bind em up ... (2.1.9-15) She then binds his wounds with her hair, and while Albert is glad to be tied by these "fetters" (2.1.20), we sense an inversion of the penetrative logic that ought to govern their intercourse. Only a few scenes later, this gesture will be repli cated by the Amazons, who will tie the French gallants in their own fetters and "bind 'em fast" (2.1.20) in their own "bonds" (3.1.398). Breaking out of these fet ters entails the taming of Amazons and the reassertion of masculine authority. In turn, the regaining of masculine authority entails a transformation from feckless gallant to shrewd merchant adventurer. Thus when Albert speaks of discovering continents and conquering them for his virgin queen, it is with apparent nostalgia and the knowledge that this would be feasible only in a delirious dream induced by Aminta's hunger: And when that sleep Deceives your hunger with imagined food, Think you have sent me for discovery Of some most fortunate continent, yet unknown, Which you are to be queen of. (2.1.89-93) For now, it is food rather than land that Albert must discover. In doing so, he must abandon the guise of conquistador, negotiate with the pseudo-Amazons (here standing in for the island's natives), and shrewdly proffer the sexual ser vices of his men in exchange for their food. The process leaves us with a tragicomic hero who appears less and less like the ideal of temperance and husbandry that an earlier generation of writers like Spenser envisioned as central to England's colonial presence abroad. What we have instead is a pirate turned pragmatic negotiator, in love with the abducted Aminta but not unaware of the advantages of a sexual union with the Amazonian Clarinda, expediently wary of the gold on the island but ready to tender it as a currency to the Amazons. In situating him as such, I slightly</page><page sequence="20">24 Thejournal for Early Modern Cultural Studies ♦ 12:3 diverge from Feerick who argues that Albert's "temperance marks him as a man worthy of his plantation, worthy, that is, of the plantation that the play's end celebrates as '[home]"' (46). Albert is not intemperate like Franville or Lamure, both of whom are governed entirely by the excesses of their appetite, but the barren island resists plantation logic, requiring neither husbandry nor temperance of him. The problems of the island arise from the absence of inter course, and it is the generative powers of the island's men and women that will be called upon rather than their temperate natures. That Albert and Tibalt are among the few who can "'rise' to this challenge" (47), to use Feerick's phrase, makes them more likely heroes than the other debilitated men on the island; more so than the fact of their temperance. Indeed, much of the humor in the scene of almost-copulation derives from the fact that most of the gallants lack the sexual prowess needed for the occa sion and long for the "abilities of [their] pothecaries" (3.1.214), who would fur nish them with "eringoes" (3.1.212), "potatoes" (3.1.213), and "cantharides" (3.1.213)—presumably the necessary aphrodisiacs to ease this peculiar case of performance anxiety. Tibalt is unusual in this regard, requiring neither "ju leps, / Nor gujacum, prunellos, camphire pills, / Nor gourd water" (3.1.323-25). The least likely to be associated with generative powers—"For though I like the sport, I do not love / To father children" (3.305—06)—Tibalt is nevertheless up for the task of intercourse, like Donne's lover, recognizing the pure use value associated with woman's "centric part." While older than the other gallants, he appears to rectify the errors of others in his generation and the next, guiding Albert in his conduct on the island. Together, they herald a new kind of mas culinity and a new kind of merchant adventurer, transformed through their encounter with the gold and women on the barren isle. Thus as the play draws to a close, virtually all the key actors are compelled to reckon with the redundancy of an older model of venturing, exemplified by their absent fathers, who first set out in search of gold riches and unknown territories, thereby ending up on the island. In a sense, these absent fathers recall figures such as Columbus and Ralegh, whose quest for gold and unin habited islands is rendered outmoded in the new economies of exchange. Such forms of voyaging, Fletcher and Massinger seem to suggest, only leave the body politic weak, spent, and depleted. Thus it is that their ghosts are laid to rest, and the play can finally move toward its celebration of intercourse. Al though Sebastian has the last word, signaling the end of the sea voyage and the process of returning to "our several homes" (5.4.112), it is Tibalt's words, a few</page><page sequence="21">Shahani ♦ Of "Barren Islands" and "Cursed Gold" 25 lines above, that seem to hold the most potent meaning. Paired with Crocale in the denouement, the outspoken wit sings the praises of her "mettle" (5.4.106). Indeed, it is hard as metal (almost like "steel"), he informs us, strong enough to cut his "leaden dagger, if not used with discretion" (5.4.106). While his punning on her mettle (her essence, her spirit, her vagina) as a metal—as well as his penetrative logic (symbolized by his flourishing dagger) —is by now familiar to us, it is the conspicuous absence of gold in this system of signi fication that strikes one as important. For a play that has been preoccupied with heaps of gold, the shift to images of steel and lead is fraught with symbolism. As such, Tibalt robs gold even of its representative powers. Other metal, it would seem, can just as easily represent mettle, so long as it facilitates intercourse. If, as Fredric Jameson has argued, "romance is that form in which the world-ness of world reveals itself" (142), then it is fitting that Tibalt's words bring Fletcher and Massinger's island romance to its conclusion. For in them we see the emergence of new understandings of new worlds in which value would be redefined by new economies of exchange. NOTES 1.

The very term "free trade" is incongruous when used in the context of the figures like Mun. Like many EIC officials, he was invested in the continuation of its monopolistic practices. But he nevertheless insisted that the minimal royal interference in trade would benefit the kingdom as a whole. Mun argued that any strictures "we shall impose upon strangers here, will presently be made a Law for us in their Countreys" (England's Treasures 85). The merchant is a kind of diplomat in his treatise, and the laws of commerce are deter mined through an international agreement among nations: "For as the use offorraign trade is alike unto all Nations, so may we easily perceive what will be done therein by strangers, when we do but observe our own proceedings in this waighty business" (83). It is perhaps this latter argument that has led to the mercantilist perspective being seen as an argument for free trade. 7. See Dreher's analysis of the play, particularly 135.
