Introduction The sea Isn't a place But a fact, and A mystery (The Waves, Mary Oliver)1 Human uses of the sea in the past can be reflected by sites on the land. In the west Pilbara in the colonial period the sea was used for nearly all transit, and hosted critical industries like whaling and pearling. The Indian Ocean linked the Pilbara to distant places through the movement of goods, people, wealth and practices. Like elsewhere in Australia, colonial industries were made possible and profitable through access to cheap Aboriginal labour and inevitable processes of dispossession. Archaeological sites, including depictive traditions such as rock art, 30</page><page sequence="2">The Great Circle The Sea, Inland Vol. 34, No. 2, reflect activities that occurred on the sea. While boats were depicted in historical rock art at several sites; the largest collection of ship images at any West Australian site is at the pastoral station of Inthanoona, the focus of this paper. The western Pilbara of Western Australia has long been characterized by the sea, a social and historical fact today partially lost in an era of air and road travel. In this paper we consider the ways that activities on the sea were reflected through the events of cross-cultural processes in the colonial period between Aboriginal people of the west Pilbara and colonial outsiders/settlers. The difficulty posed by the sea and its use by humans is the often intangible nature of its material record. Passages from land across seas rarely leave physical records. As argued by John Mack, to study the sea is to be 'concerned with a sensory world for it is fundamentally about the experience of the seas and the oceans' and one cannot separate sea and land: 'what happens on the sea is strongly coloured by what happens on the land'.2 For coastal Aboriginal people of the Pilbara their essential relationship with water encompassed different forms of environment: from inland waters (ephemeral, seasonal and permanent), the tidal zones characterized by low-laying inundated environs like mangroves, and permanent intervisible islands. The evidence for the significant use of these islands and waterways is testified by rich archaeological records of regular and repeated human use.3 Islands of the Dampier Archipelago, for example, host middens of coastal shells and turtle bone, burials, marine themed rock art and stone arrangements that functioned ceremonially to increase targeted marine species. Islands were imbedded in cosmologies that tied coastal places into the societies of the interior of the Pilbara and further east into the Western Desert.4 The engraved rock art at these locations is understood to have been created by ancestral beings, and to provide to contemporary Aboriginal people variously strength, security, and knowledge relevant to traditional belief.5 Travel in the coastal Pilbara (Figure 1) required movement through and across salt and fresh waters. Various watercraft were used around Australia—in this part of the continent at the time of contact logs were used as rafts. Daniel Davidson in his 1935 national review of Australian watercraft described how: 'on these crude devices the 31</page><page sequence="3">The Great Circle Alistair Paterson and Wendy Van Duivenvoorde Vol. 34, No. 2, natives intentionally allow themselves to be carried for many miles to sea to visit the islands which are numerous along the stretch of coast near Roebourne'.6 These craft could have tools attached, and sometimes employed a small railing as a foot rest.7 The use of floating craft on the coastal tides in the Dampier Archipelago (Murujuga), Nickol Bay and Depuch Island was observed by Lieutenant Philip Parker King in 1818.8 TIMOR SEA Kimberley / J * :, Guff of INDIAN \ PACIHC OCEAN . / !

In the 1870s Durclacher, a European who spent some time in the region among Aboriginal people, observed people using nets in inland waterways by walking across the river bed underwater to entrap fish. People were strong swimmers. In an event in the 1870s an Aboriginal man and his two wives swam two miles across open sea from the Burrup Peninsula to a sheep station on West Lewis Island to avoid retribution for wrong 32</page><page sequence="4">The Great Circle The Sea, Inland Vol. 34, No. 2, marriage.9 These skills in water were valuable for European pearlers, as they provided the means for Aboriginal divers to collect pearlshell from boat platforms. Pearlers described how Aboriginal people brought to the coast from the desert by illicit 'blackbirders' were quickly capable in the water as pearl divers.10 Outsiders largely came to the Pilbara from the sea. For European explorers the sea was the primary means of discovery, encounter, and perception. William Dampier in 1699 arrived at the archipelago that now carries his name, observing the fires of camps.11 While in the northwest he described pearlshell, as did later visitors such as John Lort Stokes, George Grey and Frank T. Gregory. The sea was rich in resources, such as whale hunted off the West Australian coast throughout the 1800s, clearly predating formal colonization (1860s). The passage of the nineteenth century increasingly saw visitors arrive in boats to the coast. Gregory's 1861 visit was a critical turning point, as he returned with encouraging information of the Pilbara for pastoralists who would soon follow. While waiting for Gregory to return to Nickol Bay, the crew of Dolphin collected a large quantity of shell, a product whose value was already being realized by pearlers then active further south in Shark Bay. Colonisation by Europeans was serviced by the sea, with Cossack on the mouth of the Harding River as the home of the pearling fleet. Along the coast were useful points such as riverways and islands to land vessels to careen, or load/unload shell, wool, and people. The use of these places is not well understood, as few events are described in historical sources for the region, especially outside administrative centres such as Cossack. While many key historical places are largely forgotten, others are recognised for their historical role, including town sites like Roebourne (established 1866) and Cossack—essentially functioning as one town separated by a few miles of difficult coastal country—pastoral stations and, after the 1870s, mining sites, significant buildings and infrastructure like wells, ports, and landings. We often describe places such as this as being linked to other more distant locations. For example, in such an analysis, the port of Cossack then is linked to Fremantle (Perth), and more locally to pearl shell locations along the coast. In the late 1800s and early 1900s Cossack provided the most northern banking services 33</page><page sequence="5">The Great Circle Alistair Paterson and Wendy Van Duivenvoorde Vol. 34, No. 2, in the state, and pearlers from as far north as Roebuck Bay would think little of voyaging there. Cossack was linked to the colony in the south, although the hazards of sea travel were well known—as tragically demonstrated with the sinking of Emma in 1867 with 41 of the residents of the small colonial population of the Northwest. Another way of thinking of these places is not as just being linked, but as being created by external and distant processes. Tracey Banivanua Mar, in her recent paper 'Ocean, motion, emotion: Mobilities and mobilizations in History' argues some 'historical pasts are trans-local: they are defined not as places connected, but as connections and links that generated places'1.12 This process-focused rather than event-focused thinking is well suited to the world of the coastal Pilbara, populated by highly mobile subjects such as explorers, pearlers, migrants, drovers, and opportunity seekers. Workers circulated from across Western Australia, Asia, and the wider world. Cossack had the pearling fleet, divers from across Asia, entrepreneurs from Europe, Perth, China and Japan.13 The town was populated by the greatest diversity of Aboriginal people from across the colony that had ever been seen—many through trafficking in Aboriginal people as mobile fungible labour. These colonial places rose up from economic prospects, and were subsequently sculpted both by physical and social forces. This historical maritime world is well known in its broad terms : whaling, pearling, overseas transit, importation and export of commodities, the shift from sail to steam.14 What is less known are the ways the sea was understood and perceived at the time, particularly by Aboriginal people in a rapidly changing colonial world. One way to access this is to consider Aboriginal sites reflecting historical perceptions of the sea. The archaeology of boats and maritime activities The western Pilbara is renowned for its rock art, executed over millennia and resulting in distinctive rock art provinces such as the Dampier Archipelago (Murujuga).15 In this region there are several sites with rock art created in the historical period following contact with various non-Aboriginal outsiders, dominated by images (petroglyphs) produced after British colonisation in the 1860s.16 Many of these historical images are easily defined as postdating the arrival of Europeans through their depiction of introduced subject matter: guns, horses, clothing, shooting, 34</page><page sequence="6">The Great Circle The Sea, Inland Vol. 34, No. 2, houses, clay pipes, and boats. Other rock engravings produced in this period remain largely indistinguishable from the great corpus of rock art in the Pilbara, unless detectable through the use of new engraving equipment such as metal blades, through being on an historical structure such as a building or stone wall, or being remembered locally though Indigenous memories. These historical sites remain very rare, with only a handful being described.17 It has recently been proposed by Jo McDonald and Peter Veth that 'the production of engravings (petroglyphs) may have ceased in [the Western Desert and the Pilbara] during the last 500 years', positing its replacement by other landscape marking behaviour such as stone arrangements, although this requires testing.18 In their analysis they find that the stylistic heterogeneity of rock art provinces in the Pilbara does not match exactly with language boundaries at contact, suggesting style deriving from older periods prior to the formation of historical language groupings. They argue that the contact rock art recorded at Inthanoona and other (mainly pastoral) settings can be attributed to the fact that 'the social context for this production changed—and that this art is likely to have been produced significantly after 'first contact' in this region'.19 This proposal raises some interesting questions, however they remain the same as the overarching question for studies of contact rock art— what is (contact) art for? What are the implications for its production at these sites? Their hypothesis predicts that contact art occurs at contact locations such as pastoral stations—this needs to be tested. These are larger problems than the intention of this paper, which will consider the maritime-themed contact art and marking behaviour in its cultural and historical context. However, we do propose that the art is being produced in early phases of culture contact, contra McDonald and Veth. The implications of this are explored in the discussion. There are numerous possible pathways of investigation for contact archaeology, and contact image making.20 The humble purpose of this paper is to consider the images deemed to be of boats in their archaeological, historical, and social contexts. We aim to describe these vessels, and also to consider the possible significance of maritime vessels being depicted in terrestrial settings. The sites discussed here are located on land, on rock surfaces well above the water line. In fact, the majority of images described here are located at sites many 35</page><page sequence="7">The Great Circle Alistair Paterson and Wendy Van Duivenvoorde Vol. 34, No. 2, kilometres inland from the coast. While there are images of vessels at coastal and island settings on the Burrup Peninsula and Dolphin Island, most appear, on a technical basis, to be made by non-Aboriginal artists in 20th century contexts and are not considered in this paper. Aboriginal art production has employed marine themes for millennia, presumably dating locally to the period following current sea stands. These include images of marine species such as turtles, fish, stingray and others. It appears that much art is concentrated near or in sight of the coast, or within easy access to it.21 Once we move away from the coast the use of marine motifs is largely absent however. There is no reason to expect this to be the case, especially given people's mobility in historical contact settings—for example, Hawaiians who moved in the late 19th century to Utah created engravings of Pacific marine species from the home islands, including a whale, fish and turtles.22 For the Pilbara, the absence of marine-themed depictions inland may suggest something of the function of the art, or social rules around its use. Equally, marine themes may be present in rock art but we may not recognise them as such, as stated by McNiven and Brady in 'Rock art and seascapes':23 'Coastal rock art associated with many maritime peoples comprises non-figurative motifs for which the symbolic association are unknown.' Links to the coast are clearly reflected elsewhere in the archaeological and ethnographic record, such as through the extensive trade of pearl and other shell from northwestern Australia into inland Australia.24 There are many instances in the world of where marine themes in the form of ship depictions are found in the broader material record, forms of what we may call 'the sea on the land'.25 In rock art, boats were widely depicted from prehistoric Scandinavia to Southeast Asia. These practices appear to reflect on the land social organisation and activities that occurred at sea. In a similar sense then, the images of boats in Pilbara rock art reflect maritime events that occurred along the coastal Pilbara. This is a critical concept as the activities of the maritime setting (especially pearling) were linked to people. Background to the pearling industry by pastoral stations The northwest of Australia in the 1800s is largely remembered for the attempts at colonisation backed by pastoralists. Lockier Clere Burges, a key colonist in the earliest years of settlement, recalled: 'In the year 36</page><page sequence="8">The Great Circle The Sea, Inland Vol. 34, No. 2, 1864 the whole colony from north to south was in a pulsative state with regard to exploration and the expansion of sheep farming'.26 Two large companies backed by eastern colonies attempted settlement in that year: the Camden Harbour and the Denison Plains Company—these ventures saw stock landed in the permanent European colonisation of the northwest. The settlement at Camden Harbour failed, however other pastoralists were successful in the following decades. The early settlers had their eyes turned to the sea and its resources, particularly pearl shell. The 1861 explorations led by Gregory had collected pearl shell in Nickol Bay. Its accessibility was clearly demonstrated in the ornaments worn by Aboriginal people who used pearl shell (Pinctada maxima) amongst other shells such as Baler.27 Shell from the northwest was highly valued as a traded good in Aboriginal societies, both in the recent past and in antiquity.28 Shell was a valuable product in colonial Australia, being used in clothing and furniture, and other important objects—and could fetch a sizable return on the investment. Burges recalls how the early pastoralists initiated the pearling industry—he went into a partnership with a Mr Tayes, loaning him 'everything, horses, carts, natives, rations etc., whilst we were to share the proceeds equally'.29 Tayes and Aboriginal companions had two tonnes from the shore through 'beachcombing' within the first week. By the second week they had located 'a bank or reef with live shell on, and asked me to get him a boat, no matter what the cost was...I was able to purchase a boat from a whaler, to which I was supplying beef...in less than three months [Tayes] had collected over nine tons of shells.' It is interesting in this account to note the sale of beef to visiting whale crews, something little reported in this era. Along the coast from the 1860s settlers became pearlers. By the 1870s there was a pearl shell 'rush' with Cossack as the primary port.30 The rush continued for several decades into the twentieth century as Broome rose as the home of the industry. Before Broome, however, there was the Pilbara—the focus of this paper. The labour for the pearling industry was provided variously by Aboriginal and Asian divers, as detailed elsewhere.31 The work changed over time as the industry responded to changes in availability. The initial few years saw the collection of shell from shallow waters. Once collected, this could be hidden in large piles along the coast to 37</page><page sequence="9">The Great Circle Alistair Pater son and Wendy Van Duivenvoorde Vol. 34, No. 2, be collected subsequently by small coastal vessels. The need for divers increased as deeper waters were accessed, and boats for the pearling fleet became vital. In the 1860s, 1870s and 1880s it appears Aboriginal workers were very significant; matched by increasing numbers of Asian divers after the 1870s. The pearling fleet involved disparate Aboriginal peoples from across the Pilbara, and from further regions such as the Kimberley and Ashburton. Many Aboriginal people became essentially tied to pastoralists (some also pearlers) through the Master and Servant Act, which provided cheap indentured labour to the colonists.32 This legislation was designed to ensure that pastoralists who signed up Aboriginal people were able to guarantee their labour. Many Aboriginal people were clearly unaware of what they were signing, and suffered arrest if they happened to leave the station to which they were bound. In many stations the law allowed for pastoralists to expect Aboriginal people to return to stations after the off-season. Pastoralists who were also pearlers seemingly mobilised their station labour for pearling work. Donald McRae, from Inthanoona's neighbouring station (Old) Woodbrook, wrote in the late 1870s that 'I was very busy getting my darkies together for pearling. I have got a very good crowd this season, nearly forty and would have done good things if it had not been for these new regulations which will throw us back a bit'.33 Description of boat images The main known rock art depictions of watercraft from the western Pilabara are from the inland site of Inthanoona (Figure 2). There are also two other known depictions from the Dampier Archipelago, briefly described here. Together these are the 9 known depictions of historical watercraft from the western Pilbara. The site of Inthanoona is the key site in this discussion, as the largest single concentration of images of watercraft in Northwest Australia. As the site and its contact art have been described previously, only a brief overview is provided here.34 Inthanoona is located on Warambie Station, on the Jones River. It was established as a sheep station after 1864 and probably ran until the 1890s. The owners were involved in the pearling industry, including building a vessel for pearling, named Amateur. Battye described this much later, in 1905, that: '... in conjunction with 38</page><page sequence="10">The Great Circle The Sea, Inland Vol. 34, No. 2, medmm .av» É&amp;d.^&amp;í'j.'ViíSí Figure 2. Aerial image of Inthanoona site complex, with rock art located on main central stone outcrop, to the immediate left of the stone yards.(photograph courtesy of Warren Richards). Mr Harper ... [Mr Viveash] built a boat and engaged in the pearling industry for three seasons, this firm being the first in the north-west to employ Aboriginal divers for obtaining the pearl shell. The vessel was called the Amateur ... The seventeen natives employed in the summer on the pearling-fields were, in the winter, equally invaluable on the station shearing-shed and in handling the sheep, which were rapidly increasing in numbers.'35 The main archaeological recording at the pastoral head station included more than 250 rock engravings of which 20% are identifiable contact period motifs. These include images of clothed men and women, guns, horses, sheep, wheeled vehicles, houses and ships. They provide direct evidence of Aboriginal participation in, and perceptions of, the pastoral and (possibly, as argued here) pearl shell industries of the Pilbara. The seven boat motifs recorded and analyzed from the Inthanoona site include: 1. two-masted steam-driven ships depicted without sails—most likely fore-and-aft schooners (Ship motifs 1 and 4); 39</page><page sequence="11">The Great Circle Alistair Paterson and Wendy Van Duivenvoorde Vol. 34, No. 2, 2. two-masted fore-and-aft schooner-rigged sailing or steam ship with sails (Ship motif 5); 3. two- or three-masted luggers, brigs, or topsail schooners, with at least two yards on one or more masts (Ship motifs 2, 3 and 6); and 4. A stylized fore-and-aft rigged schooner, possibly 3-4 masted with gaff topsails, or a square-rigged vessel (Ship motif 7). The vessels were tentatively identified using basic information about ship construction, outfitting, and rigging.36 All ships are typical European-style vessels involved in trading and colonial industries from the mid-19th century onwards.37 These ships are consistent with those that operated along the Western Australian coastline and rivers. The vessels are described in detail below for the historical record before considering their significance.

Motif 7 Interpretation of the ship images Ship motifs 1 and 4 are clearly steam-propelled schooners, i.e., they have funnels, plumes of smoke, and rudder frames. The tethers hanging off their sides indicate that they were possibly involved in pearling activities.38 They are the only two motifs that depict Europeans wearing hats—in Ship motif 1, an individual stands with his hands on his hips. The latter motif is the only one that depicts possible cargo, i.e., a sheep or other animal hoisted into the ship with a mast derrick.39 Trading vessels from this period carried cargoes of sheep, and were generally involved in pearling and other colonial industries as well.40 A similar motif recorded at Inthanoona and identified as a sheep seems to support this interpretation. 47</page><page sequence="19">The Great Circle Alistair Paterson and Wendy Van Duivenvoorde Vol. 34, No. 2, Some may refer to these vessels, seen in Ship motifs 1 and 4, as ketches, but they generally differ from schooners in that the mainmast stands foremost and is larger than the mizzenmast.41 Schooners are two-masted vessels, generally, with tall lower masts fitted with short topmasts. They carry booms on their foremast and mainmast and have gaff topsails.42 The rigging of Ship motifs 1 and 4, however, especially the distinct main topmast stay, forestay, fore topmast stay, jib stay, and additional steam power suggest the vessels were in fact two-masted schooners.43 Ship motif 5 also depicts two masts, but it is the only vessel carrying sail. It is uncertain whether it has steam power, because the funnel and plume of smoke, as seen in Ship motifs 1 and 4, are absent. Ship motif 1, 4, and 5 are similar to the two two-masted schooners or ketches depicted at the Malarrak rock-shelter in the Wellington Range of northwestern Arnhem Land and a two-masted schooner, lugger, or ketch from the Dampier Archipelago.44 Ship motifs 2, 3, and 6 may be stylised versions of Ship motifs 1, 4, and 5, or they may represent three-masted vessels rigged with square sails or a combination of fore-and-aft and square sails.45 It is difficult to discern whether they have funnels with plumes of smoke or whether they have, instead, third mast with yards. No people, no cargo, no anchors or tethers are depicted in these motifs. They could represent, therefore, two-masted luggers, schooners, topsail schooners, brigantines and brigs or three-masted ships. If two-masted steamships, they could be similar to Rob Roy that appeared variously as a schooner, brig and brigantine in the second half of the 19th century.46 Ship motif 7 stands out and is more stylised than the other watercraft representations at Inthanoona. The depiction comprises a fore-and-aft rigged schooner, possibly 3-4 masted with gaff topsails, or a square rigged vessel. Apart from the ship's hull, masts and sails, this motif depicts no rigging elements, parts of the ship's equipment, no people, no cargo, no anchor, and no tether for divers. For the record, only two other images are known from the region. These may have been done by non-Aboriginal artists, given the technical departures from rock art of the region. One panel shows a two masted sailing vessel, possibly a ketch, with a second motif located to the left of a two masted, three-rigged vessel (Figure 10). The second is 48</page><page sequence="20">The Great Circle The Sea, Inland Vol. 34, No. 2, ' s#* m. Figure 10.

Figure 11. Motif 2, Dampier Archipelago 49</page><page sequence="21">The Great Circle Alistair Paterson and Wendy Van Duivenvoorde Vol. 34, No. 2, Discussion and Conclusions We consider the Inthanoona sites as a distinct record of early colonial maritime activities and vessels. Some are possibly the same vessel, namely ship motifs 1, 4, and 5; ship motifs 2, 3, and 6; while ship 7 is very different. Equally they may depict similar vessels with common motif elements. They appear to have been differently executed in terms of perspective and quality of detailed execution, which suggests different artists. As such, different artists depicting the same motif highlights the possible importance of themes. Sailing ships in this era were versatile freighters, adaptable to carry cargo or passengers. This was a critical limit of the young colony, as the Northwest colonists became established vessels were required. Key boats like Dolphin (used by Gregory in 1861) and Tien Tsin were chartered from outside Western Australia, and later vessels were imported like Searipple, Bridgetown, and Forget-Me-Not to meet the demands of the pearling industry vessels in Fremantle.47 At Inthanoona the local small boat Amateur is not depicted, as no single masted vessel is shown. One possible explanation is that the images were made prior to the construction of the Amateur, or that larger ocean going vessels were preferred for depiction. Given the role of Aboriginal people at Inthanoona in pearling, are these images of pearling? One image has an anthropomorph beneath it, suggesting a diver. The vessels, being a combination of sailing and steam vessels, are similar to the larger vessels that serviced the fleet, from which smaller vessels such as the Amateur operated. The sheer number of vessels increasing from the 1860s onwards dominated the waters of the western Pilbara coast, and as such it was likely that these vessels fit into the period between 1864 (when Inthanoona station was established) and the end of the 19th century (by when Aboriginal involvement in pearling had shifted to Roebuck Bay). At this place, rock art is used in a period of upheaval when long held land tenure was dismantled, the reign of traditional law was shattered, and a radically new movement of people from distant places through the hands of pastoralists, pearlers, and police occurred. During this changing time, the boat images suggest the importance of maritime labour as a cultural narrative. The images depict the latest technology, of 50</page><page sequence="22">The Great Circle The Sea, Inland Vol. 34, No. 2, all that is new, including new relationships with maritime transport and the voluntary and involuntary work these boats represented. In terms of work, many local pearlers argued that children as young as 10 could be divers; eventually the law in the 1880s would state 14 years minimum age. So, this maritime world was for men, women and children, although unlike other images of boats from elsewhere in Australia, fewer people are depicted as active on board the vessels. Given that there are no twentieth century motifs and that the station was abandoned in the late 1800s, then we assume that the art was made contemporary to and in reaction to the activities of the pastoralists/ pearlers at the sheep station. Inthanoona was not to last out the century, being one of several northwest smaller sheep stations subsumed into larger holdings. If the art is contemporary with the station, then it appears to have been created in the first generation of contact, suggesting an important role for art in local communication strategies. The images of boats appear to relate to the era of European colonisation and the first phase of the pearling industry when it was dominated by Aboriginal divers. This is a departure from pre-contact art, which appears to carry no recognisable images of rafts. Additionally, in terms of purpose, the fact that the historical images are located close to the head station suggests to us that the art was intended to be viewed by Europeans, and is thus an open form of cross-cultural communication of these maritime events and processes. 51</page><page sequence="23">The Great Circle Alistair Paterson and Wendy Van Duivenvoorde Vol. 34, No. 2, ENDNOTES 1 Cited in J.
