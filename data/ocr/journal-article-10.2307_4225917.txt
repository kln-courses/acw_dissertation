He wishes also to express his appreciation for permission to reprint parts of his book Against Mechanization in this article. The precise nature of the relationship between the disciplines of eco- nomics and philosophy has yet to be explicated in detail. Certain family resemblances can be readily verified, and traced to a common lineage. Many of the precursors of Western economic theory, such as John Locke and Adam Smith, were self-identified moral philosophers; many other inhabitants of the pantheon of economic theory, such as Karl Marx and John Maynard Keynes, are recognized as having made sub- stantial contributions to philosophy. Nevertheless, in the modem era, ontogeny does not recapitulate phylogeny; and the average economist in the late twentieth century would deny any necessary or close links between the two fields. In economics, the facade of the repudiation of philosophical precon- ceptions is propped up by the widespread conviction that modem eco- nomics has successfully adopted the character and attributes of a science. This invocation of science is intended to settle all arguments once and for all and to expiate all sins. Of course, this has been a vain hope. Disputes over method, epistemology, and ontology have not been banished because an invocation of science merely impounds con- troversy under the rubric of "the philosophy of science," without really 1001</page><page sequence="2">1002 Philip Mirowski answering any of the hard questions. Once we can get beyond the lab coats and the particle accelerators and the rest of the clanking machin- ery, it is not at all clear that "science" is inextricably committed to any particular program or method or ontological construction. Indeed, once we get beyond the homiletic nostrums of Physics I, some exposure to the history of science demonstrates that there is no such thing as single "scientific method." Science may at various junctures be realist or it may be idealist; it may be rationalist or it may be empiricist; it may be monistic or it may be dualistic; it may be naturalist or oper- ationalist or it may be instrumentalist; or, most bluntly, it may be true or it may be false. Nothing is substantially illuminated by the mere in- vocation of science by economists, although it has in the past proved useful in cowing certain critics. A survey of the philosophical presuppositions of modem economics is made doubly difficult by the necessity of confronting the role of "sci- ence" in both revealing and obscuring the main points of contention. Thorstein Veblen, himself first trained as a philosopher, once began one of his articles with the deadpan sentence: "A discussion of the scientific point of view which avowedly proceeds from this point of view itself has necessarily the appearance of an argument in a circle; and such in great part is the character of what here follows" [Veblen 1969, p. 32]. Veblen's predicament is particularly poignant for the issues at hand be- cause he was philosophically literate, he was the acknowledged progeni- tor of the institutionalist school of economics, and he chose to raise the issue of the philosophical preconceptions of the economics of his day by attacking its credentials as a science. Ever since that time, the institu- tionalist school has been distinguished from the general run of ortho- doxy by a concern with the philosophical aspects of economic issues, especially in its role of a critic of neoclassical economics. Nevertheless, things get stickier when one tries to briefly characterize the philosophical bases of institutionalist economics, either as it is pres- ently practiced, or else as an ideal projection. (For some recent at- tempts, see Alan Dyer [1986]; Yngve Ramstad [1986]; and C. Wilbur and R. Harrison [1978].) In this article, the reader should be prepared for one very individual and idiosyncratic reading of the philosophical underpinnings of institutionalist theory: namely, that it has not yet found a way to break out of Veblen's ironic circle. The problem, as we shall argue in this chapter, is a failure of comprehension of the fact that institutionalist economics was the offspring of an entirely distinct phil- osophical tradition from that which gave rise to neoclassical econom- ics. These two traditions have a profound conflict over their respective</page><page sequence="3">The Philosophical Bases of Institutionalist Economics 1003 images of a "science," and therefore profoundly incompatible images of "economic man" and "rationality." The Durkheim/Mauss/Douglas Thesis The first urgent issue in the philosophy of economics is the question of the intelligibility of a separate discipline devoted exclusively to the explication of an abstract concept called "the economy," separate from other categories of social phenomena, and separate from the relation- ships we attribute to the physical or non-human world. These are the fundamental issues that any coherent discipline of economic theory must address: it must carve up reality, and have some claim to have carved artfully "at the joints"; it must have some resources to adju- dicate boundary disputes with other disciplines, which requires a clear conception of its own theoretical object; it must nurture some episte- mological conception of the economic actor and the economist and pre- sumably reconcile them one with the other; and it must build bridges to the conceptions of power and efficacy within the context of the cul- ture in which it is to subsist. Although it is not inevitable, in the past these requirements have been satisfied to a greater or lesser degree by positing a curious symmetry between the portrait of the economic sci- entist and the theoretical portrait of "rational economic man" in the particular school of economic thought. This symmetry exists on many levels, both formal and informal. It is the thesis of this chapter that once the pattern of this symmetry is understood, then the philosophical distinctions that divide and demarcate institutionalist economic theory from neoclassical economic theory become transparent; and further, one can go quite a distance in explaining the evolution of institution- alist thought in the twentieth century. In order to organize the various themes in the philosophy of econom- ics, and to explain our symmetry thesis, we shall have recourse to a very important generalization about human behavior that was gener- ated not in economics, but in anthropology. In 1903, the anthropolo- gists Emile Durkheim and Marcel Mauss proposed a hypothesis that has become one of the core tenets of research programs in the sociology of knowledge. They asserted that, in all primitive cultures, the classifi- cation of things reproduces the classifications of human beings [Durk- heim and Mauss 1963]. Although the Durkheim/Mauss thesis was only intended to apply to primitive societies, and the original empirical eth- nographic evidence they offered in its support was widely challenged and criticized, the thesis has been taken up and revised by the Edin-</page><page sequence="4">1004 Philip Mirowski burgh school of the sociology of science and applied to the history of Western science [Bloor 1982; Barnes and Shapin, 1979]. Recently the anthropologist Mary Douglas has further elaborated the hypothesis by asserting its antithesis: the social classification of human beings is often a mirror image of a culture's classifications of the natural world. For purposes of brevity, we can summarize the complete Durkheim/ Mauss/Douglas (DMD) thesis in the format of the "vortex model of the sociology of science" [Mirowski, forthcoming]. Societies differ tre- mendously in the sources of inspiration and validation for their social and natural concepts, but they resemble one another quite dramatically in the way in which social and natural concepts are interlinked and in the manner in which belief in one set of concepts reinforces belief in the other. Theories of the physical world are shaped by the social rela- tions within the culture that generates them, and these are used in turn to express in reified form the essence of that culture's ideal of order. This ideal of order consequently molds the expression of social con- cepts and classifications, eventually transforming the original notions of mastery and control in the social sphere. The circuit or vortex is completed by the persistent projection of anthropomorphic concepts onto "Nature," and the intended demonstration of the efficacy and le- gitimacy of structures in the social sphere through its purported success in the mastery of personified nature. While this "vortex model" is a cornucopia of suggestions for the anal- ysis of social life, for the history of science, and for various controver- sies in epistemology, it has its effectiveness in helping to understand the preconceptions of institutional economics that concern us here. Di- vergent assumptions about the relationship of social concepts to nat- ural concepts, and the relationship of the possibility of mastery and control to the reified concept of order are the fundamental distin- guishing marks of institutional and neoclassical economic theory. The discipline of economics in the Western world has always been caught in the thrall of the contemporaneous Western understanding of the physical world, particularly with respect to the concept of value.' It has been an even more recent phenomenon (say, since the early nine- teenth century) that the idealized image of the method of natural sci- ence has played the predominant role in shaping the image of the economic actor in economic theory. However, at this juncture the cul- tural diversity of various Western societies has come into play: because there have been multiple variations on the theme of the correct scien- tific method, there have been equally numerous corresponding images of the "economy" and of the economic actor. Economic praxeology</page><page sequence="5">The Philosophical Bases of Institutionalist Economics 1005 may recapitulate epistemology, but it can only do so within a specific cultural setting. Schools of economic thought may subsquently inter- penetrate and cross-fertilize, but their initial integrity and specificity are because of their origins in a particular construct of our knowledge of the "external" world and hence of ourselves and other actors. Rather than discuss the interplay suggested by the DMD thesis of the reigning scientific epistemology and the ontology of the economic actor at an extremely rarified level, it will be more efficient to demonstrate the thesis through the display of two relevant examples: that of Carte- sian analytic philosophy and neoclassical economic theory; and the American variant of the Continental hermeneutic tradition in philos- ophy and institutional economics. The Cartesian Tradition and Neoclassical Economic Theory The Cartesian tradition in philosophy has made its appearance in the British and American contexts with the tendency toward "analytical philosophy," especially in the twentieth century. Although many of the modern tenets are not intended to be faithful representations of Des- cartes's original concerns, the "Cartesian tradition" does serve as a shorthand for a certain sequence of canonical texts and attitudes [Rorty, Schneewind and Skinner 1984]. We shall characterize this tradi- tion by the following seven tenets [Cf. Tiles 1984; Bernstein 1983]: (a) Analytical Cartesian philosophy is not overly concerned with the thought processes of the individual scientist, nor indeed, of any group of scientists. Above all, it demands that science is mechanical and im- personal, and quarantines the context of discovery from the context of justification. (b) The process of inquiry is divided into "deduction" and "induction." Philosophy analyzes the former as a discrete set of logical statements, with concepts investigated only through their functions in isolated abstract statements. Philosophy is relatively helpless in ana- lyzing induction because there is no guaranteed logic of induction. (c) "Logic" is interpreted to mean mathematical axiomatization. (d) There is an unbridgeable gulf between the philosophy of science and the his- tory of science. The best one can do is to construct a post hoc "rational reconstruction" of what is, at best, a mess. Science perennially recon- stitutes itself and therefore has no real need of history. (e) The role of philosophy is to prescribe and defend the right rules of scientific method. The summum bonum would be an automaton to which all dis- putes would be submitted and that would hence guarantee the validity of scientific work. (f) The separation of mind and body dictates that we</page><page sequence="6">1006 Philip Mirowski know our own thought better than we can know the world. Hence all verification is the assuagement of personal doubt. This comes about by means of repeated personal contact with a stable external world, depen- dent of any mediation by others as well as independent of the signs used to express such knowledge. (g) Knowledge, once attained, is passed along intact to other researchers. Knowledge is fully cumulative, the accretion of past individual researches [Cf. Tiles 1984; Bernstein 1983]. One important corollary of the DMD thesis is that the social theories that were prevalent in the culture dominated by the portrait of science made up of the seven points outlined above would project that image onto their understanding of their own social relations. If we cast our gaze upon the orthodox economics of Britain and America in the twen- tieth century, we indeed discover that the neoclassical portrait of the "rational economic man" conforms to the outline, very nearly point- by-point: (a) Neoclassical economics is not concerned with the actual thought processes of the individual economic actors. The actors are subject to an ideal of rationality that is mechanical and impersonal in the dual senses that constrained optimization imitates the "behavior" of the inert mechanical world in physical theory, and that interpersonal influences and processes of interpretation are ruled out by assumption [Mirowski 1984a; 1986a; forthcoming]. One must separate the context of socialization from the context of choice. (b) Rational choice is di- vided up into rational choice rules and independently given endow- ments. Neoclassical economics takes as its primary subject the logic of the former and is relatively silent about the latter because there is no logic of endowments that claims the allegiance of neoclassicals in general. (c) "Logic" is interpreted to mean mathematical axiomatiza- tion. (d) There is an unbridgeable gulf between neoclassical economics and the history of any particular economy. The market is always pre- sumed efficient and therefore exhibits no hysteresis [Mirowski 1987b]. (e) Neoclassical economics prescribes and defends the right rules of market organization. The summum bonum is an automatic mechanism that coordinates the economy and guarantees its legitimacy. (f) The mind/body separation dictates that we know our own thought better than we know the world. Hence economic theory must be cast in the format of self-sufficient individual mental valuations brought in con- tact with a stable external world of commodities independent of any mediation or dependence upon signs. (g) Capital accumulation is treated as analogous to knowledge accumulation: an incremental aggre- gation of discrete units. Indeed, the former should be reduced to the latter in the guise of an inexplicable "technological change."</page><page sequence="7">The Philosophical Bases of Institutionalist Economics 1007 Our purpose here is not to put the DMD thesis through all its paces; nor is it our intention to discuss neoclassical theory in the detail war- ranted to seriously illustrate the above parallels.2 All we wish to suggest for present purposes is that there exists a close correlation between the Cartesian epistemology and the structure of neoclassical economic the- ory: a familial resemblance that serves to fuse the natural world and the social world into a single coherent entity for the analytic Anglo- American mind. The social order of the economic world is reflected in the scientific order of the natural world; it hence comes as no surprise that Karl Popper has admitted that certain inspirations for his philos- ophy of science came from his particularly Western understanding of economics [Hands 1985]. If we accept this thesis as a provisional working hypothesis, the ques- tion of interest then becomes: how to account for the existence of het- erodox schools of economic theory? Most germane to our present task, how can we understand the existence of the only school of economic thought indigenous to the United States, which is in many respects in- commensurable with neoclassical economic theory-that is, institu- tionalist economics? Pragmatism and Peirce Prompted by the DMD thesis, our answer is to search for its philo- sophical foundations elsewhere than in the Cartesian analytic tradition. The origins of this phenomenon must be traced back a century to the situation extant in philosophy and science in the America of the Gilded Age. In the late nineteenth century United States, the predominant un- derstanding of science was not that of the Cartesian tradition; indeed, as Bruce Kuklick put it, "In the late nineteenth century American phi- losophical circles there were more Hegelians of various sorts than you could shake a stick at" [Rorty, Schneewind and Skinner 1984, p. 132]. The main influences upon the idea of science in the Gilded Age came not from Britain or France, but rather from the Germany of the research universities. There the philosophy of science had not grown as separate and detached from social theory as it had elsewhere, and this was manifest in the three great movements in German philosophy: the dialectical idealism of Georg Friedrich Hegel, the historicist her- meneutics of Wilhem Dilthey, and a revival of neo-Kantianism. These traditions took root in the United States, and, by a very convoluted route, sprouted an indigenous school of philosophy in the United States called "Pragmatism." It is our thesis that this Pragmatic conception of</page><page sequence="8">1008 Philip Mirowski scientific endeavor and epistemology, which later induced a novel re- interpretation of the economy and the economic actor, was consoli- dated into an institutionalist school of economic theory in the first three decades of the twentieth century. Richard Bernstein has written, "It is still a popular myth, even among philosophers, that positivism was a tough-minded variety of the more tender-minded and fuzzy pragmatism" [Bernstein 1966, p. 168]. Judging by the Dictionary of the History of Science, the myth is still popular, since that source defines "pragmatism" as "A variant of em- piricism ... foreshadowing both operationalism and the verifiability principle of logical positivism." These impressions are unfortunate be- cause they obscure the fact that it was the project of the pragmatists to provide a systematic alternative to the Cartesian analytical tradition, as well as to the naturalist doctrines characteristic of positivism. (We shall see that this confusion has subsequently spilled over into eco- nomic controversies to the extent that, in some quarters, institutional- ist economics is misperceived as a sort of naive empiricism.) The situation is further muddied by the fact that the founder of pragmatism, Charles Sanders Peirce, left no synoptic account of his philosophical system. In this respect (as in some others as well: see H.S. Thayer [1981 p. 79]), he resembles that other towering figure of twentieth century phi- losophy, Ludwig Wittgenstein, in that he only bequeathed to us a disor- ganized sheaf of disconnected, epigrammatic and oracular accounts of his mature philosophy, which had to await publication until after his death. Reading Peirce is no fun; and therefore, most who have a passing acquaintance with pragmatism base their knowledge on the more acces- sible but less reliable versions to be found in John Dewey or William James, or worse, simply upon their own understandings of the collo- quial connotations of "pragmatism." It is frankly impossible to do jus- tice to Peirce's writings in the space allotted in this essay; there is no reasonable substitute for reading his Collected Papers and the best of the commentaries upon them such as that of Karl Apel [1981]. Both because Peirce was the only pragmatist philosopher trained in math- ematics and the physical sciences, and because it is our intention to connect Peirce (through the DMD thesis) to the institutionalist concep- tion of the economic actor, this discussion shall focus predominantly on Peirce's philosophy of science.3 Because the Peircian corpus is so fragmented, it has been argued that certain of his texts, especially those concerned with induction, might be read as anticipatory of later neopositivist writings and of some as-</page><page sequence="9">The Philosophical Bases of Institutionalist Economics 1009 pects of Karl Popper [Rescher 1978, p. 52; Radnitzsky 1973, pp. xxv- xxvii]. Contrary to these suggestions, a survey of his entire work reveals that he was openly hostile to the Cartesian analytical tradition, and may be better understood as a sophisticated advocate of a hermeneutics of science and a semiotics of scientific practice. In highlighting Peirce's concern with the social aspects of science, we follow the lead of numer- ous modern commentators (John R. Commons, Alan Dyer, Apel, Bern- stein, and R. Rorty) who have seen in Peirce a third alternative to the conventional rationalist/empiricist dichotomies [Commons 1934, p. 102; Dyer 1986; Apel 1981; Bernstein 1983; Rorty 1979]. The mainstream tradition of the philosophy of science in the twenti- eth century has found itself driven from pillar to post searching for the appropriate entity in which to ground the certainty of scientific knowl- edge. Early analytic philosophy began by touting the single linguistic term as the primary epistemic unit, but was fairly rapidly forced to retreat to the entire sentence or proposition as the lowest common denominator of scientific intelligibility. Complaints about the incoher- ence of an independent object language and the indeterminate conse- quences of scientific tests forced a further retreat to an entire conceptual scheme as the appropriate epistemological unit, but careful historical critiques, combined with skepticism about the notion of a self- contained theory, have prompted some philosophers to insist that only a research tradition in all its complex historical development can do justice to the various forms of knowledge claims of a working scientist. One amazing aspect of this progressive erosion of logical atomism in the philosophy of science is that Peirce essentially anticipated its form and consequences a century ago. His definition of "science" seems par- ticularly relevant after the breakdown of logical atomism: What is Science? We cannot define the word with the precision and con- cision with which we define Circle, or Equation, any more than we can so define Money, Government, Stone, Life. The idea, like these, and more than some of them, is too vastly complex and diversified. It embodies the epitome of man's intellectual development ... a particular branch of sci- ence, such as Physical Chemistry or Mediterranean Archeology, is no mere word, manufactured by the arbitrary definition of some academic pedant, but a real object, being the very concrete life of a social group constituted by real facts of inter-relation (Peirce 1958, pp. 37-39). Peirce's insistence that "the very origin of the conception of reality shows that this conception essentially involves the notion of a commu- nity" could be read as being founded on the thesis that scientific research is irreducibly hermeneutic, and therefore recourse to an inde-</page><page sequence="10">1010 Philip Mirowski pendent law-abiding world or to some innate preconception of truth is impotent to account for the process of scientific inquiry [Peirce 1934, p. 186]. Because the word "hermeneutics" is bandied about in a careless manner these days by literary critics, it might be prudent to provide a brief working definition for the present audience. Hermeneutics is the theory of the process of interpretation, be it of a text, a doctrine, or a phenomenon, by a self-identified community of inquiry. Indeed, all coherent philosophies must possess some such the- ory of interpretation, be it explicit or implicit; however, this theory con- centrates explicitly upon the role of shared tradition as the locus of continuity and quality control in the interpretative process; it therefore follows that the discipline of history is an indispensable accessory of hermeneutics. Hermeneutics is a response to the gridlock of communication that often results when strongly disparate perspectives confront one an- other. The doctrine of hermeneutics arose from the experience of trying to "get into the other person's head," leading to a realization that com- prehending an alien perspective often meant trying to grasp the whole of the other's experience. As Bernstein puts it, this "Hermeneutical cir- cle" allows us to steer a course between objectivism and relativism [Bernstein 1983]. "Put negatively this principle means that there are no absolute starting points, no self-evident, self-contained certainties on which we can build, because we always find ourselves in the middle of complex situations which we try to disentangle by making, then revis- ing, provisional assumptions. This circularity-or perhaps one might call it a spiral approximation towards greater accuracy and knowledge -pervades our whole intellectual life" [Rickman 1976, p. 11]. Hermeneutical philosophies freely admit that rival interpretative communities may harbor incommensurable readings of some text or phenomenon, but also recognize that there will be pressure to attempt comparisons as long as the communities are rivals, and that posterity may decide that traditions were eventually rendered commensurable. Hermeneutics reinstates the importance of diversity in the process of understanding to the extent of advocating the examination of alien or pariah traditions in the course of interpretation. Hermeneutics is also concerned with acknowledging the anthropomorphic element in hu- man knowledge, viewing it as a fruitful and necessary aspect rather than an embarrassing and regrettable anachronism [Peirce 1934, p. 35n]. Fi- nally, hermeneutics is generally hostile to the Cartesian tradition of analytic philosophy, especially the presumption of the mind/body di- chotomy and the program of mechanical reduction [Peirce 1935, pp.</page><page sequence="11">The Philosophical Bases of Institutionalist Economics 1011 15-16]. Peirce was himself particularly scathing about the plausibility of the Cartesian program of radical self-doubt, which he termed a sham, merely formal, and incapable of altering any seriously held belief [Scheffiler 1974, p. 20; Apel 1981, pp. 62-63]. It is important to understand that what one might call Peirce's brand of hermeneutics underwent revision and transformation over the course of his life, in part as a reaction to versions promulgated by Wil- liam James and John Dewey. His disaffection with their readings and embellishments provoked him in 1905 to insist that he was not at all one of these "Pragmatists," but rather a "Pragmaticist," a label so con- trivedly ugly that no one would be tempted to "kidnap" it [Apel 1981, p. 82]. Some of the fault for such a repudiation can be laid at Peirce's own door, if only because his early statements, and in particular his "pragmatic maxim," were phrased in such a way as to foster the impres- sion of a transparent and banal common-sense philosophy of science. The pragmatic maxim of 1878 was stated as follows: "Consider what effects, that might conceivably have practical bearings, we conceive the object of our conception to have. Then, our conception of these effects is the whole of our conception of the object" [Peirce 1934, p. 1]. William James read the pragmatic maxim as equating those "practi- cal implications" with the psychological responses of the user of the concept, and therefore misrepresented pragmatism as a species of in- dividual psychological behavioralism, thus entirely neutralizing the hermeneutic aspects of the community of inquiry. John Dewey read the maxim as dictating that there was no such thing as a final end or goal of inquiry, a position that Peirce explicitly repudiated [Apel 1981, p. 88]. Others, less sophisticated, read the maxim as a celebration of a particularly American stereotype of a hard-nosed no-nonsense man of action, heedless of hesitation or tergiversation over fine points of rea- soning. It must be admitted that some of Peirce's early writings seemed to encourage a crude know-nothingism: "pragmatism is generally prac- ticed by successful men" or "Each of us is an insurance company" [Peirce 1934, pp. 21, 220]. However, in the face of attempts to portray pragmatism as a kind of crypto-capitalism in the sphere of science, Peirce went out of his way to insist that "the meaning of [pragmatism] does not lie in individual reactions at all." Peirce divided the process of scientific inquiry into three categories: deduction, induction, and what he termed "abduction." He had very little of substance to say about deduction, although he did point out that no actual novelty, and therefore no progress, could be attained by deduction mutatis mutandis (Peirce 1958a, p. 47). Induction plays a</page><page sequence="12">1012 Philip Mirowski much more substantial role in his system, and here Peirce brought his extensive experience as an experimentalist and his interest in probabil- ity theory into play in his discussions of empirical research. One impor- tant stabilizing influence on Peirce's community of inquiry was his postulate that quantitative induction was automatically self-correcting, albeit in the longest of long runs (Peirce 1935, p. 80; Rescher, 1978].4 However, nothing in these writings gave any aid or comfort to naive empiricism. At one point he commented upon the limited role that ex- periment occupied in the rise of modem mechanics [Peirce 1935, p. 13]. He also observed that an hypothesis should not be abandoned im- mediately when contravened by empirical results, and that all good the- ories are always surrounded by a field of contradictory facts [Peirce 1958a, pp. 54, 60]. In these respects he appears to share contemporary concerns with the problem of the underdetermination of theory accep- tance by the "facts," and with the Duhem/Quine thesis, which states that no hypothesis is definitively falsified because it can always be im- munized to adverse tests by some adjustment in the ever-present auxil- iary hypotheses that accompany it [Harding 1976]. Most significantly, Peirce stated that induction and deduction, either jointly or severally, could not account for the progress of scientific inquiry. That proficiency was reserved for the third mode, abduction. "Abduction is the process of forming an explanatory hypothesis. It is the only logical operation which introduces any new idea; for induc- tion does nothing but determine a value, and deduction merely evolves the necessary consequences of a pure hypothesis" [Peirce 1934, p. 106]. Of the three modalities of method, it is abduction that explicitly as- sumes a hermeneutic demeanor because it is the method responsible for creativity, interpretation, and innovation, which are historical pro- cesses made manifest in language and social behavior, subject to the self-discipline of a normative logic. This is why "the question of prag- matism ... is nothing less than the question of the logic of abduction" [Peirce 1934, p. 121]. In order to discuss abduction, Peirce often employed the language of "instincts" or evolutionary talents, and these metaphors were often car- ried over into the works of Dewey, Veblen, and others influenced by pragmatism. Peirce's equation of abduction with instinct and meaning with habit probably strikes the modem reader as odd; but Peirce's un- relenting hostility to mechanical reductionism should signal that these passages are not to be read as anticipations of sociobiology [Apel 1981, p. 71]. Instead, they seem to posit the existence of a naive common- sense metaphysics that provided physics with its early fundamental hy-</page><page sequence="13">The Philosophical Bases of Institutionalist Economics 1013 potheses about natural law. Given Peirce's further thesis that natural laws themselves evolve, it follows that he would likewise expect the sources of inspiration for scientific hypotheses to evolve [Peirce 1935, p. 84]. Peirce expressly asserted that physical laws evolve over time be- cause laws of homogeneity could only be discerned against the back- drop of stochastic phenomena, from which they would be emergent. One can only marvel at his prescience in this respect, since it was only well after his lines were written did physicists begin to plumb the sig- nificance of stochastic phenomena in quantum mechanics, cosmology, and elsewhere.5 No summary of Peirce's philosophy could be complete without some acknowledgement of his role as the founder of semiotics, the theory of the interpretations of signs and their interrelations. Peirce saw the sign relation as fundamentally triadic, as a relation between the denotation of a word, the designated object, and the interpreter. The importance of this triad for Peirce lay in his conviction that previous philosophers had attempted to understand language by concentrating attention on only one or two aspects in isolation, a practice he claimed served to quarantine the hermeneutic aspects of human inquiry. An important corollary of the triad was that it is impossible to discern the rules of sign-mediated behavior by simple external observation; in other words, there is no such thing as the passive observation of rule structures [Mi- rowski 1986a]. Not only did this anticipate the mature Ludwig Witt- genstein's critique of rules and language games, but it also has profound relevance for the positivist attempt to explain rule structures by mech- anistic models. Finally, in a philosopher so concerned with exploring the links be- tween social processes and scientific inquiry, it should come as no sur- prise to discover that he also had a reasonable familiarity with the so- cial theories of his day. It has not often been noted, however, that Peirce was hostile to orthodox economic doctrines, and downright livid when it came to hedonism and utilitarian doctrines [Peirce p. 43; pp. 59-60]. He wrote: [Jeremy] Bentham may be a shallow logician; but such truths as he saw, he saw most nobly. As for the vulgar utilitarian, his fault does not lie in pressing too much the question of what should be the good of this or that. On the contrary, his fault is that he never presses the question half far enough, or rather he never really raises the question at all. He simply rests in his present desires as if desire were beyond all dialectic [Peirce 1934, p. 98]. This single passage captures much of the gist of Dewey's subsequent</page><page sequence="14">1014 Philip Mirowski and much more verbose and pedantic disquisition upon the role of val- ues in the process of inquiry. In a few essays, Peirce trained his sights on American political econ- omy, accusing it of "an exaggeration of the beneficial effects of greed," and complaining of a tendency to want their "mammon flavored with a soupcon of god" [Peirce 1935, pp. 193, 194]. The presuppositions of utilitarianism offended his hermeneutic view of science in a number of ways: they denied the role of tradition in human understanding; they blithely ignored the incommensurability of valuations; they gave short shrift to the dependence of behavior on community interaction and se- mantic processes; they were incompatible with the idea of evolutionary change and with abduction; and they smacked of Cartesian mechanical reduction. Although Peirce was not concerned with sketching out an alternative political economy, in restrospect it would seem obvious that anyone deeply influenced by his thought would certainly be skep- tical of the encroaching tradition of neoclassical economics. The modernity of Peirce's package of concerns, or as he put it, his "architectonic," is striking. With some generosity of exegesis, one could credit him with the anticipation of the DMD thesis in certain respects because he saw that one of the most fruitful sources of abduction in science was the transfer of metaphor from one sphere of inquiry to an- other.6 Nevertheless, Peirce was definitely out of synchronicity with the ragtime era of American culture. It is tragic that the theorist of the infinite community of science was himself expelled from that commu- nity in 1884, never to hold another academic position. He repaired to Milford, Pennsylvania in 1887, to reside in almost total isolation, scrib- bling away at manuscripts that remained unread and unpublished dur- ing his lifetime. In part because of this exile, it generally was either through William James or John Dewey that many learned about Prag- matism. John Dewey Dewey was the conduit through which many of the precepts of prag- matism migrated over to American social theory in the early twentieth century. From a certain point of view this was unfortunate because the quality of his thought was not often up to the standard of Peirce; never- theless, he managed to achieve much greater influence and renown than Peirce. Peirce himself once rebuked Dewey for a lack of logical subtlety, despite the fact that Dewey (along with Veblen) was one of the few illus- trious students during Peirce's stint at Johns Hopkins [Apel 1981, p.</page><page sequence="15">The Philosophical Bases of Institutionalist Economics 1015 5]. Even an enthusiastic supporter like Richard Bernstein was forced to admit: "imagination and insight must be explicated and modified in detailed analyses, and this is what Dewey failed to do for us. Insofar as philosophy requires the funding of fertile imagination with systematic elaboration, his philosophy fails" [Bernstein 1966, pp. 171-72]. Dewey insisted that, for philosophy, "the central problem is the rela- tion that exists between the beliefs about the nature of things due to natural science to beliefs about values-using that word to designate whatever is taken to have rightful authority in the direction of conduct" [Thayer 1981, p. 166]. One can observe a familial resemblance to the concerns of Peirce here, but already, in contrast to Peirce's wide- ranging attempt to synthesize specific aspects of scientific practice with the social nature of inquiry, we discover exceptionally vague references to a monolithic "science" and a premature reduction of the social sphere to an ill-defined phenomenon of "values." For Dewey, as for Peirce, inquiry is pre-eminently a process whereby doubtful or unset- tled situations become settled. Yet Dewey's definition of inquiry is sur- prisingly impersonal and very pedantic in the Germanic style: it is defined as "the controlled or directed transformation of an indetermi- nate situation into one that is so determinate in its constituent distinc- tions and relations as to convert the elements of the original situation into a unified whole" [Dewey 1938, pp. 104-5]. In this marriage of He- gel and Peirce, Thought comes perilously close to Thinking Itself, but is wrenched back from the Idealist precipice with the help of Peirce's pragmatic maxim of 1878. Dewey called this interpretation of reason- ing "Instrumentalism," and defined it as follows: Instrumentalism is an attempt to constitute a precise logical theory of concepts, ofjudgements and inferences in their various forms, by consid- ering primarily how thought functions in the experimental determinations of future consequences ... it attempts to establish universally recognized distinctions and rules of logic by deriving them from the reconstructive or meditative function ascribed to reason [Thayer 1981, p. 169]. Unfortunately, Dewey spent much more time talking about this at- tempt to establish universally recognized et cetera, et cetera than ac- tually suggesting a few concrete rules and exposing them to criticism. In effect, Dewey extended some of the hermeneutic themes found in Peirce to explicit application in social theory, especially generalizing the concept of habit into the broader concept of social custom. Many have observed that Dewey equated pragmatism with social psychology; and indeed, he seemed to approach philosophy as if it were a branch</page><page sequence="16">1016 Philip Mirowski of a more encompassing instrumentalist social science [Apel 1981, p. 87; Thayer 1981, pp. 183-90]. Perhaps he felt that "valuations" were discrete empirical entities, the description of which could be left to the social scientist. He often wrote as if that were the case: "Valuations are empirically observable patterns of behavior and may be studied as such. The propositions that result are about valuations but are not themselves value-propositions in any sense marking them off from other matter-of-fact propositions" [Dewey 1939b, p. 51]. In retrospect, Dewey's numerous appeals to the scientific method ap- pear awkward, strained, and pedantic. This reification of an abstract "Sciences' would have serious consequences for the later evolution of pragmatism. In place of actual training in any specific science or in the history of one of the sciences, Dewey's favored sources of inspiration were Hegel and Greek philosophy. The path of his intellectual evolu- tion can be traced from the psychologistic idealism of his early career to a vague and politicized pragmatism towards the end of his life. Dewey's crusade was to argue against the idea of truth as accuracy of representation, which took the form in his later life of an insistence that reality could not exist prior to and independent of the process of inquiry [Dewey 1939a, p. 308]. The idea of "warranted assertability" was as close as he ever got to Peirce's richer notion of the complex inter- action of the interpretative community and the object of inquiry; in Dewey, this assumed the rather more prosaic cast of a comparison of scientific inquiry with a jury trial [Dewey 1939a, pp. 898-900]. Dewey followed Peirce in his skepticism concerning the Cartesian analytic tra- dition, but as was his inclination, he tended to reinterpret philosophical problems as amenable to translation into problems in psychology: "the older dualism of body and soul finds a distinct echo in the current du- alism of stimulus and response" [Dewey, 1931, p. 233]. Dewey also imi- tated Peirce in viewing human inquiry as an evolutionary process, but diluted this legacy by transmuting the sweeping portrayal of the evolu- tion of natural law itself into the diminished banality that "tool and material are adapted to each other in the process of reaching a valid conclusion" [Dewey, 1939a, p. 929]. Whatever one's opinion about Dewey's conception of science, it is demonstrably true that his work in social theory found a sympathetic audience in a United States that had previously associated evolutionary theory with either atheism or social Darwinism. Although it had re- mained a familiar idea in the Contirnental tradition of philosophy, it was a novelty to find an American arguing that, "History is the record of the development of freedom through the development of institu-</page><page sequence="17">The Philosophical Bases of Institutionalist Economics 1017 tions.... Here we have instead an anticipatory criticism and challenge of the classical liberal notion of freedom, a deliberate, reflective and reactionary one. Freedom is a growth, an attainment, not an original possession, and it is attained by the idealization of institutions and law" [Dewey 1931, p. 285]. Dewey also maintained Peirce's hostility to utilitarianism, although his objections appeared to spring primarily from an aversion to the idea of given and immutable tastes: Not even the most devoted adherents of the notion that enjoyment and value are equivalent facts would venture to assent that because we once liked a thing we should go on liking it.... Desire and purpose, and hence action, are left without guidance, although the question of the regulation of their formation is the supreme problem of practical life. Values (to sum up) may be connected inherently with liking, and not yet with every liking but only with those that judgment has approved" [Dewey 1939a, p. 786]. As a champion of the importance of the process of change over static notions of optimality, Dewey became associated with groups opposed to economic laissez-faire notions; he was a vocal advocate of the posi- tion that classical liberalism had avoided all the hard questions of co- ordination and the definition of order by surreptitiously postulating that each citizen came naturally equipped with an innate complement of rights, desires, and powers that were sufficient to do the job (Dewey 1931, p. 281). It is relevant to later developments in economics that he saw this flawed predisposition as part and parcel of the larger Western predisposition to yearn for natural laws, which qualifies as a limited appreciation of the DMD thesis [Dewey 1939a, p. 745]. As he put it, "the existing limitations of 'social science' are due mainly to unreason- ing devotion to the physical sciences as a model, and to a misconcep- tion of physical science at that" [Dewey 1939a, p. 949]. Unfortunately, here Dewey became tangled in his own dependence upon science, for not only was he incapable of describing the actual historical instances of practices within the physical sciences, but he was also bereft of any coherent description of the processes of promulgation of social order. This led him in later life to compound these weaknesses by proposing the non sequitur that the natural sciences would themselves provide the progressive ideals of social order [Dewey, 1 939a, p. 791]. We might sug- gest that Dewey's appreciation of the DMD thesis must have been lim- ited, because this latter prescription clashes with his earlier warnings about the "unreasoning devotion to the physical sciences as a model." Democracy was said to be a pronounced improvement over previous</page><page sequence="18">1018 Philip Mirowski modes of political organization because it deployed the same tech- niques as science to mediate freedom and authority [Dewey 1939a, pp. 358-60]. All social problems would be thus purportedly solved (or dis- solved?) by the scientific method, because democracy was the analog of the scientific method in the political arena. Dewey may simply have meant that "democracy" was another name for the trial-and-error pro- cess that he thought characterized all inquiry, but, if so, it would por- tend a rather sloppy use of political terminology, and, moreover, it was only an innocuous step to equate instrumentalism with social engineer- ing. The Pragmatic Tradition and Institutionalist Economic Theory We now return to the DMD thesis in order to ask whether the alter- native philosophical program of pragmatism did provide an alternative template for rational economic man. In what follows, the essence of Peirce will rather dominate the musk of Dewey, for reasons already broached above: it is specifically philosophies of science that set the tone for the ensuing portraits of man. As we did for the Cartesian tradi- tion, we can generate a brief bill of particulars that characterize the Pragmatic philosophy of science: (a) Science is primarily a process of inquiry by a self-identified community, and not a mechanical legitima- tion procedure of some pre-existent goal or end-state. Science has con- formed to no set of ahistorical decision rules, and for this reason history and science are inseparable. Most of this would come under the rubric of Dewey's "instrumentalism." (b) Possible methods of inquiry consist of deduction, induction and abduction. No one method is self-sufficient without the other two as complements. Abduction is the explicit source of novelty, whereas induction and deduction provide the checks and balances. (c) There is no single logic, but rather a logic of abduction, a logic of deduction, and a logic of induction. (d) Because there are no foolproof impersonal rules of scientific method, decisions concerning the validity of scientific statements reside within the community of in- quiry. The community of inquiry is the basic epistemological unit. (e) Without a strict mind/body duality, science has an irreducible anthro- pomorphic character. This is not inherently a dangerous phenomenon. Natural laws themselves evolve, as do the members of the community of inquiry. Social and natural concepts interpenetrate; therefore herme- neutic techniques are a necessary component of scientific inquiry, on the same epistemic level as mathematical techniques. (f) The study of semiotics and the interrelation of signs constitutes an integral part of</page><page sequence="19">The Philosophical Bases of Institutionalist Economics 1019 the philosophy of science. (g) Because pragmatism must ultimately de- pend upon the community of inquiry, the Scylla and Charybdis be- tween which it most frequently must negotiate are a defense of the status quo and an advocacy of a technocratic utopia. Just as with our previous experience with the connection between the Cartesian tradition and neoclassical economic theory, here too the conception of the rational economic actor in institutionalist economics can be read off the pragmatic program. This reading is not nearly as easy as in the neoclassical case, however. This is because the neoclas- sicals have by and large practiced what they preached: their research praxis depends upon a close imitation of their colleagues, the natural scientists, many of whom hew to the Cartesian ideal as self-evident. The institutionalist school, on the other hand, has confronted the quandry that "pragmatism" has not generally been a popular episte- mology among the physicists, and therefore they possess no obvious role models. In practice, the research praxis of institutional economics in the twentieth century displays little of the homogeneity and internal coherence across researchers of neoclassical economics, and therefore most of our characterization of institutionalism will be drawn from programmatic statements. In our drawing of parallels, we shall concen- trate upon the first generation of institutionalist economists, roughly from Thorstein Veblen to John R. Commons. Proceeding point-by- point: (a) The economy is primarily a process of learning, negotiation, and coordination, and not a ratification of some pre-existent goals or end-state. Economic rationality is socially and culturally determined, and therefore history, anthropology, and economics are different per- spectives upon the same inquiry. The economy itself may be concep- tualized as the prosecution of inquiry by material means, with the community both constructing and discovering its values. (b) Economic actors are defined by their habits, customs, and "instincts," the physical or material relations that impinge upon them, and the ex- pedients developed in order to adapt one to the other [Veblen 1934, p. 189]. This portrayal seeks to find a middle way between "nature" and "nurture." "Instinct," being not a neurological or physiological concept, is not statable in neurological or physiological terms. The instinct of workmanship, no more than any other instinctive proclivity, is an iso- lable, discrete neural function" [Veblen 1914, p. 28fn]. (c) There is no unique logic of choice. "Passion and enjoyment of goods passes insen- sibly and inevitably into appraisal.... Enjoyment ceases to be a datum and becomes a problem. As a problem, it implies intelligent inquiry into the conditions and consequences of the value-object; that is, criti-</page><page sequence="20">1020 Philip Mirowski cism" [Dewey 1939a, pp. 260-61]. (d) Because there exist no innate rules of rational economic behavior, the only gauge of the validity of such behavior resides in the particular economic community. Laws are made by people, not nature. The appropriate epistemological unit is the institution. Institutions are transpersonal rules that endow individ- ual economic actors with the ability to cope with interpretations of ac- tion and with change, or as Commons put it, "collective action controlling, liberating and expanding individual action" [Commons 1934, p. 70]. (e) Acceptance of the thesis that science embodies anthro- pomorphic concepts prompts the social theorist to incorporate herme- neutics or a sociology-of-knowledge approach when comparing certain incommensurable interpretations of the behavior of economic actors. Diversity of interpretations are as important for the viability of social structures as simpler economic indicies, such as profit or growth. (f) Because rule structures cannot be comprehended by external detached observation, economists must self-consciously engage in participant observation. Economics is based upon a theory of the semiotics of trade, production, and consumption, which serves to explain how ac- tors interpret the significance of transactions. (Examples are Veblen's "conspicuous consumption" and Commons's typology of transactions.) (g) Institutional economics has displayed a periodic tergiversation be- tween a defense of the status quo and an advocacy of a technocratic regime that reifies science as a unique principle of rationality. These seven points do not capture the whole of institutionalist the- ory, but they do give some indication of the divergence of the concep- tion of economic rationality from that characteristic of neoclassical theory. As previously noted, the first generation of institutionalists gen- erally derived their pragmatism from James, Dewey and other sources more accessible than Peirce. This path of influence made a mark on their writings; among other more subtle effects, it induced an image of science that was excessively vague. This weakness, especially in Veblen and Ayres, resulted in a vulnerability to neoclassical complaints that their appeals to "science" were less legitimate than those of the neo- classicals, the difficulty being that both sides' conceptions of "science" were rarely made explicit. Somewhat later Commons made more ex- plicit reference to Peirce's philosophy of science, and consequently built upon a more robust philosophical foundation. Nevertheless, Commons's book Institutional Economics signals the end of the first phase of the development of institutionalist economic theory. This wa- tershed was not so much because of the merits or demerits of Com- mons's work as it was to the rapid decline of what remained of the</page><page sequence="21">The Philosophical Bases of Institutionalist Economics 1021 pragmatist philosophy of science in the United States-it never really could have been described as enjoying a period of dominance-and its supercession by a Cartesian logical positivism.7 We now turn to summarize the interactions of pragmatism and the conceptions of science in the key institutionalist economists, Veblen and Commons. Thorstein Veblen It has been observed that Veblen owed a number of debts to the prag- matist tradition [Dyer 1986]. What has not been noticed is that Veb- len's conception of science and economic rationality owes more to Dewey and James than to Peirce, and that many of his initial ideas grew out of a struggle with Kantian antinomies. In his famous essay "The Place of Science in Modern Civilization," Veblen wrote: Modem science is becoming substantially a theory of the process of cu- mulative change, which is taken as a sequence of cumulative change, re- alized to be self-continuing or self-propagating and to have no final term. ... Modem science is ceasing to occupy itself with natural laws-the cod- ified rules of the game of causation-and is concerning itself wholly with what has taken place and what is taking place.... A scientific point of view is a consensus of habits of thought current in the community [Veblen 1969, pp. 37-38]. The influence of Dewey and Darwin here is fairly self-evident, but the key to understanding Veblen's use of the term "natural law" derives from his first paper on Kant's Critique of Judgement [Veblen 1934, pp. 175-93]. Veblen was absorbed by Kant's problem of the conflict of free- dom and determinism and thought he had struck upon a new solution to the problem, making use of the notions of "adaptation" and evolu- tion. He wrote, "The principle of adaptation, in its logical use, is ac- cordingly the principle of inductive reasoning." Peirce's "abduction" would have been the more appropriate term, curiously enough for a student of Peirce [Veblen 1934, p. 191]. As Veblen became acquainted with economic theory, it dawned on him that neoclassical theory was beset with the very same Kantian co- nundrum; namely, it purported to be a mechanistically deterministic theory predicated upon teleological principles. In his famous article on the "Limitations of Marginal Utility," he declared, [Neoclassical] theory is confined to the ground of sufficient reason instead of proceeding on the ground of efficient cause. The contrary is true of mod-</page><page sequence="22">1022 Philip Mirowski em science, generally (except mathematics).... The two methods of in- ference-from sufficient reason and from efficient cause-are out of touch with one another and there is no transition from one to the other.... The relation of sufficient reason runs only from the (apprehended) future into the present, and it is solely of an intellectual, subjective, personal, teleo- logical character and force; while the relation of cause and effect runs only in the contrary direction, and it is solely of an objective, impersonal, ma- terialistic character and force. The modem scheme of knowledge, on the whole, rests, for its definitive ground, on the relation of cause and effect; the relation of sufficient reason being admitted only provisionally [Veblen 1969, pp. 237-38]. One might have expected a student of Peirce to see a third, transcen- dant, option: sufficient reason and efficient cause could have been united by recourse to an evolutionary epistemology and ontology, where both laws and our understanding of them jointly were altered by the activity of inquiry. In the sphere of the economy, institutions, de- fined as habits of thought and action, could serve as the connecting link between efficient cause and sufficient reason [McFarland 1986, p. 621]. Yet this was not the road taken by Veblen's subsequent intellectual ca- reer. Instead, he tended toward an increasingly pessimistic Manich- aeism with sufficient reason as the darkness and efficient cause, now conflated with Peirce's pragmatic maxim, as the light. Since there was no necessary connection between the pragmatic maxim and "objective, impersonal, materialistic" law, he was increasingly driven to a very id- iosyncratic version of a theory of "instincts," especially "the instinct of workmanship," a non-physiological entity whose "functional content is servicability for the ends of life, whatever these ends may be" [Veblen 1914, p. 31]. The pragmatic maxim, which started out as a solution to a difficult problem in metaphysics, ended up as a reified "instinctive" entity. Early in his career, Veblen's antinomies resonated with the pragma- tist philosophy and produced some of his most profound work. For in- stance, The Theory of the Leisure Class may be read as a skillful example of the pragmatic maxim, showing that the consequences of an action are an important part of its interpretation, and wryly pointing out that "serviceability" might actually be consistent with waste. "The Economic Theory of Women's Dress" is a tour deforce of Peircian sem- iotics. By The Theory of Business Enterprise another antimony was pos- ited, pitting "the machine process" against pecuniary enterprise. This antimony also resulted in fruitful economic theory, but the tendency to conflate "science," efficient causal reasoning, and the working or en- gineering class made its first appearance [Mirowski 1985]. Progres-</page><page sequence="23">The Philosophical Bases of Institutionalist Economics 1023 sively, Veblen came to see the conflicts of science versus religion, efficiency versus waste, capitalist versus worker, and knowledge versus ignorance as all prototypes of one large dichotomy [Veblen 1914]. Ev- erything seemed to conspire to drag down the march of scientific prog- ress as Veblen got older, and this Manichaeism blunted his earlier sensitivity to the subtle interplay of science and culture -what we have dubbed Peircian hermeneutics-so that by the time he reached Absen- tee Ownership, he could write: The technology of physics and chemistry is not derived from established law and custom, and it goes on its way with as nearly a complete disregard of the spiritual truths of law and custom as the circumstances will permit. The reality with which technicians are occupied are of another order of actuality, lying altogether within the three dimensions of the material uni- verse, and running altogether on the logic of material fact (Veblen 1923, p. 263). Perhaps Veblen believed he could break out of the "logical circle" cited above by resorting to this lofty and other-worldly conception of science, and then using it to claim he himself was merely applying the "matter-of-fact" attitudes to the economic sphere. Instead of Peirce's community of inquirers, scientists became for Veblen almost automa- tons, closer to Dewey's Thought Thinking Itself. In a striking similarity to Marx, Veblen also wished to argue that there was a certain inevi- tability to the whole process: the matter-of-fact efficiency characteristic of the technician would necessarily clash with the anachronistic appeal to inefficiency propped up by the legitimation of natural law by the "Captains of Industry"; and Veblen intimated the technicians would defeat the business interests in the long haul [Layton 1962]. Although Veblen's writings are a fertile source of insights into eco- nomic theory, the Achilles heel of his later system was his naive con- ception of science and the exaulted place of the engineer. This epistemological weakness led to two further flaws: the first, that Veblen misunderstood that the neoclassical theory he so adamantly opposed had a more powerful claim to his brand of scientific legitimacy than he realized, because it later turned out that those self-same engineers would be attracted to the neoclassical brand of social physics; and sec- ond, that certain particular evolutionary or Peircian aspects of Veblen's thought stood in direct conflict with his later image of science. The first flaw can go quite some distance in explaining the neglect of Veblen's profound critiques of neoclassical theory, particularly the the- ory of capital and the theory of production. Veblen clearly believed that</page><page sequence="24">1024 Philip Mirowski natural law explanations were on the wane in physics, and that eco- nomics would eventually follow suit. Obviously, things haven't turned out as anticipated. Veblen's neglect of the hermeneutical aspects of sci- ence prevented him from understanding how deeply rooted natural law explanations are in the Western cultural matrix, and how significant they were in the nineteenth-century science he admired: in mechanics, in chemistry, and in energetics. In other words, Veblen had an inad- equate comprehension of the DMD thesis.8 Because of this, he could not comprehend the primal attraction of neoclassical theory, or the ex- tent to which it was a model appropriated lock, stock, and barrel from nineteenth-century physics [Mirowski 1984a; forthcoming]. Veblen's assertions that he was a partisan of modern scientific methods appeared weak and unavailing compared to the shiny surfaces of neoclassical economic theory. The engineers, with whom Veblen was so ena- moured, flooded into economics after his death and opted to work for the theoretical tradition that they recognized as closest to their previous training: that is, neoclassicism. The second flaw in Veblen's epistemology was that he did not realize that some of the more intriguing aspects of his economic theory were in open conflict with his conception of science. In his early essay on Kant, he claimed that "the play of the faculties of the intellect is free, or but little hampered by the empirical elements in its knowledge," but did not maintain this insight on his later work using anthropological sources [Veblen 1934, p. 181]. He was also very scathing when it came to others' adherence to a naive sense-data empiricism, as in his critique of the German historical school, but oblivious to instances of it in some of his descriptions of science [Veblen 1969, p. 58]. In his profound se- ries of essays on the preconceptions of economic science, he observed: Since a strict uniformity is nowhere to be observed in the phenomena with which the investigator is occupied, it has to be found by a laborious interpretation of the phenomena and a diligent abstraction and allowance for disturbing circumstances, whatever may be the meaning of a disturb- ing circumstance where causal continuity is denied. In this work of inter- pretation and expurgation the investigator proceeds on a conviction of the orderliness of natural sequence.... The endeavor to avoid all metaphys- ical premises fails here as elsewhere [Veblen 1969, p. 162]. This heightened awareness of the presumption of natural sequence was put to good use in Veblen's critique of the "obvious" neoclassical prop- osition that the value of outputs must necessarily be equal to the value of inputs, for example.</page><page sequence="25">The Philosophical Bases of Institutionalist Economics 1025 There are other Peircian themes in Veblen that languish in an under- developed state because of his epistemological position on science. His earliest work on the theory of the leisure class could be read as a pro- legomenon to asemiotics of economic transactions. The phenomenon of conspicuous consumption indicates that desires and wants cannot simply be read off of economic behavior (as has often been claimed under the rubric of "revealed preference"), but that the interpretative and intentional problems of the actors must also enter into the picture, undermining any unique reference for the concept of self-interest. In essays such as "The Economics of Women's Dress," he shows the her- meneutic practice of approaching familiar behavior as if we were pro- ducing an ethnographical report of the behavior of an alien tribe [Veblen 1934]. His conception of capital as an evolving linchpin of our economic system has interesting parallels with Peirce's idea that nat- ural laws themselves evolve, and thus our interpretations are forced to evolve as well. These possibilities did not receive the attention they may have de- served; instead, Veblen became associated in the public mind with the politics of the technocratic movement and a "soviet of engineers," as the extrapolation of his faith in a self-assured materialist science [Lay- ton 1962]. John R. Commons The Peircian legacy in the work of Commons was more self- conscious and more direct [Ramstad 1986]. In his magnum opus Insti- tutional Economics he surveyed the philosophical traditions he saw as nurturing the primary schools of economic thought and argued it was time for recent advances in philosophy to prompt a new economic the- ory: In the stage of Pragmatism, a return is made to the world of uncertain change, without fore-ordination or metaphysics, whether benevolent or non-benevolent, where we ourselves and the world around us are contin- ually in a changing conflict of interests.... Not till we reach John Dewey do we find Peirce expanded to ethics, and not until we reach institution- alist economics do we find it expanded to transactions, going concerns, and Reasonable Value [Commons 1934, pp. 107, 155]. Commons followed Peirce in many respects. He, too, was hostile to the Cartesian duality of mind and body and suspected that doctrine had served to obscure the problem of conflicts of interest in earlier eco-</page><page sequence="26">1026 Philip Mirowski nomic thought [Commons 1934, pp. 16, 105]. For Commons, both truth and value were defined as the consensus of the relevant investiga- tive community. Mind was not assumed to be a passive receptacle of sense impressions, contrary to neoclassical biases, but rather as an ac- tive inventor of meanings that displayed "an inseparable aspect of val- uing, choosing and acting" [Commons 1934, p. 18]. Commons brought these philosophical convictions to bear in his economics, by isolating value as the central epistemological term in economics and by postulat- ing that the definition of value is tentative and evolutionary, con- structed by courts in the course of their adjudication of conflicts of interest. Commons perceptively grasped the importance of the dichotomy be- tween sufficient reason and efficient cause in Veblen's research pro- gram, and yet he rejected Veblen's reification of the dichotomy as an unbridgeable gap. Veblen's concept of a science was the traditional concept of the physical sciences which rejected all purpose in the investigation of the facts. The court's concept of a science was an institutional concept wherein the inves- tigation must start with a public purpose as a primary principle of the sci- ence itself. Veblen's elimination of purpose from the scope of science was based on his interpretation of Pragmatism as set forth by James and Dewey. He does not seem to have known the Pragmatism of Peirce, which dealt only with the physical sciences, nor the Pragmatism of the courts, which more nearly followed Dewey [Commons 1934, p. 654]. This hermeneutical character of science is an important presupposi- tion of Commons's economics. He insisted that "false analogies have arisen in the history of economic thought by transferring to economics the meanings derived from the physical sciences" [Commons 1934, p. 96]. If economists had not been so spellbound with the slavish imita- tion of the outward trappings of physics, they might have admitted that the structures and meanings they had constructed frequently conflicted with the interpretations of the actors so described, and that there had to be some rational means for reconciliation of such divergent con- structions. All economic life is interpretative, and there is no more cer- tain recourse than the interpretative practices of the community. This explains why Commons dubbed his theory "Institutional Economics": "we may define an institution as Collective Action in Control of Indi- vidual Action" [Commons 1934, p. 69]. Commons's theory of transactions follows directly from his embrace of what we have called Peircian hermeneutics, as it attempts to supply</page><page sequence="27">The Philosophical Bases of Institutionalist Economics 1027 a theory of semiotics to explain the actors' interpretations of the mean- ings of legitimate transactions [Ramstad 1986, pp. 1083-86]. To por- tray a transaction as simple physical transport between two spheres of relative need assumes away all problems of rational cognition [Mirow- ski, forthcoming]. "It is significant that the formula of a transaction may be stated in terms of psychology.... All that is needed to shift it to institutional economics is to introduce rights of property; legal units of measurement; the creation-, negotiability and release of debt; the en- forcement of the two duties of delivery and payment by the collective action of the state" [Commons 1934, pp. 438-39]. In effect, Commons was invoking Peirce's dictum that every semiotic act must be analyzed according to the sign itself, the signifier, and the interpreter. In his tax- onomy of transactions, the signifiers were the actual traders, the inter- preters were to be the virtual buyers and sellers and the state apparatus, and the signs were to be the contracts, the debt instruments, and all the rest. Once one sees the transaction for the complex social phenomena it is, it should become apparent that conflicts of interest and interpreta- tion would be endemic. Hence, problems of coordination within a mar- ket system will be rife, and there will be an imperative for some notion of "Reasonable Value" to be negotiated. This concept of value can only be historical and contingent upon the evolution of the interpretative community. Commons's legacy as an economist was consonant with his stated philosophical premises. As is well known, both he and his students were very active in legal and governmental circles, attempting to get courts and legislatures to recognize their role as experimenters as well as mediators. Commons openly advocated the gradual improvement of capitalism through governmental intervention. Many of the economic functions of the U.S. government that we take for granted today were the handiwork of Commons and his students in the first half of the twentieth century. However, his greatest triumphs in the arena of practice were viewed in the next generation as liabilities in the arena of economic theory. His refrain that there were no "natural" grounds for economic institutions was read as implying that he left no systematic economic theory. The conjuncture of the decline of pragmatism in the United States in the 1930s and the rise of a particularly narrow form of positivism sealed the fate of the Commons wing of the pragmatist institutionalist pro- gram.</page><page sequence="28">1028 Philip Mirowski Post-1930s Institutionalism The pragmatist view of science had fewer and fewer partisans in the United States from the 1920s to the 1960s. The causes of this decline are too complex to discuss here, but it is obvious that a Cartesian-style positivism rose to predominance and became the premier cultural im- age of natural knowledge.9 The institutionalist school of economics found itself vulnerable in this harsh new climate. The rival tradition of neoclassical economics was patently more attuned to the trends in phi- losophy and science, and even went on the offensive, branding its rivals as "unscientific." In reaction to this threat, the "second generation" of institutionalists tended to distance themselves from their mixed heri- tage of Peircian pragmatism and Deweyan evolutionary social theory. Two prominent representatives of this reaction were Wesley Clair Mitchell and Clarence Ayres. Mitchell was a student of Veblen, and received from him an extreme skepticism about the analytic claims of neoclassicism, a skepticism he maintained throughout his career. His early work on monetary history and business cycles were extrapolations of some major Veblenian themes, such as the divergence of financial from material expansion as a cause of macroeconomic instability. However, as Mitchell rose in professional standing, he became the advocate of a very unsophisti- cated notion of scientific endeavor, in the sense that Mitchell became an advocate of the economic scientist as a neutral and impartial gath- erer of facts. One of his crowning achievements was becoming the prime mover behind the founding of the National Bureau of Economic Research, an organization originally dedicated to the nonpartisan sup- port of the collection and analysis of quantitative economic data, such as the fledgling national income accounts.'0 From some of his comments such as those in The Backward Art of Spending Money, it seems he thought that statistical analyses were somehow separate from and immune to the mechanical analogies im- ported by neoclassical theory [Mitchell 1937, p. 35]. Nonetheless, it is also clear that his formidable success in capturing funding and support for his bureau hinged crucially upon his willingness to make use of the appearance of scientific rigor. Largely because of Mitchell, by mid- century the institutionalist school was perceived as promoting a species of naive empiricism without any theory. Protests to the contrary were met with the challenge: where is your scientific theory?-which really meant, why are you not using the conventional techniques of physics (such as constrained maximization) as we do? Mitchell and his school,</page><page sequence="29">The Philosophical Bases of Institutionalist Economics 1029 for the most part, had no coherent response, since he had already ac- quiesced to so much of the positivist program. (See, however, Rutledge Vining [1949] and Morris Copeland [1951]). Clarence Ayres was another well-known institutionalist who stressed the later, more Manichean side of Veblen's legacy. Ayres explicitly traced his influence from Dewey: "It was from John Dewey that I first learned what that way of knowing is. It is what Dewey called the 'in- strumental' process. This, as Dewey realized, is identical with what Veblen was calling the 'technological' process" [Ayres 1961, p. 29]. (See also McFarland [1986], p. 622). The reification of technology as the sole category of legitimate knowledge, begun by Veblen, was carried to its extreme conclusions by Ayres. In the process, the Peircian pragmatic maxim was stripped of everything but a crude instrumentalism that sought "to identify the intellectual procedures of science with the use of instruments and at the same time to identify the instruments of sci- entists with the tools which are still in wider use by artisans and crafts- men" (Ayres 1961, p. 277). While Dewey could hardly be accused of possessing an architectonic, this was certainly a misrepresentation of his position [Rutherford 1981]. Where Dewey wanted to portray scien- tific inquiry as a continuous questioning procedure, Ayres tried to por- tray it as the accumulation of certain and final knowledge by means of the accumulation of tools and artifacts. While this position had little to do with pragmatism, it did resonate with certain doctrines in the philosophy of science in the 1930s through the 1960s, such as Percy Bridgeman's "operationalism" and various attempts to define a neutral object language, and, therefore, it did attract adherents. The central theme in Ayres's work is the tension and dichotomy be- tween "ceremonial" and "technological" or "instrumental" processes [Waller 1982; Bush, 1983]. The distinction seems to reduce to an ex- haustive partition of all social life into nonscientific and scientific en- deavor, for Ayres insists that, "tribal beliefs, and the institutional and ceremonial practices in which they are objectified, are simulcra of sci- entific knowledge and technical skills" [Ayres 1961, p. 30-31]. Tech- nology is by far the larger category, since it is defined, "in the broadest possible sense to refer to that whole aspect of human experience and activity which some logicians call operational, and the entire comple- ment of artifacts with which mankind operates. So defined, technology includes mathematical journals and symphonic scores" [Ayres 1961, p. 278]. This work was more reminiscent of Auguste Comte's division of all human knowledge into three stages-the Theological or fictitious, the Metaphysical or abstract, and the Scientific or positive-than it was</page><page sequence="30">1030 Philip Mirowski of any of the writings of Peirce or Dewey. Somewhat incongruously for an institutionalist, "ceremonial" practices and habits are equated with institutions, which are then invidiously contrasted with science. Reli- gion, myth, folkways, and the status quo are at various times tarred with the brush of"ceremonial" status; but the most concise definition of the concept is provided by Anne Mayhew: "Ceremonialism is a fail- ure to evaluate by testing consequences" [Mayhew 1981, pp. 515-16]. At the end of this road, the pale shadow of pragmatism has become- irony of ironies-a Popperian version of science. Hence the subtle hermeneutics of Peirce, by way of Dewey, was re- duced in Ayres's hands and those of his followers to a very prosaic ma- terialism. "The 'we' who know are not the entire community, or even a majority of all the people ... such knowledge exists, is a community possession, so to speak accessible to anyone who seeks access to it" [Ayres 1961, p. 34]. Knowledge was effectively a stock, and the role of community was diminished to the vanishing point. Science was treated as if it were the embodiment of a single method true for all time, al- though he was negligent when it came to describing precisely what the method consisted of [Ayres 1961, p. 51]. Ayres was prone to such obiter dicta as "nothing but science is true or meaningful," or "Any propo- sition which is incapable of statement in scientific terms, any phenom- enon which is incapable of investigation by scientific methods, is meaningless and worthless as meaning and value are conceived in that universe of discourse" [Lepley 1949, p. 59]. Ayres did temper the harshness of this pronouncement by his reference to the relevant uni- verse of discourse, but he had obviously come a long distance from Peirce's hermeneutics. This increasing stridency in the evocation of sci- ence became painfully incongruous to a positivist audience, and pushed institutional economics further and further out on a limb: how could they praise scientific discourse as the only relevant truth criteria and simultaneously eschew scientific practice as it was understood in the mid-twentieth century United States? Where was the mathematical for- malism and axiomatization, the systematic hypothesis testing accord- ing to the canons of classical statistical inference, the mathematical models, and the style of studied anonymity of the physics report? Revolutions in Science and Philosophy A funny thing happened on the way to the Temple of Science. Just as neoclassicism and institutionalism were vying to be the sole legiti- mate claimant of the mantle of science, science itself changed dramati-</page><page sequence="31">The Philosophical Bases of Institutionalist Economics 1031 cally. First in the theory of relativity, and then more dramatically in quantum mechanics and cosmology, physics was severely warping the complacent vision of natural law. The particularly Laplacean notion of rigid determinism came unstuck, and the prosaic conception of pre- cepts or sense-data got lost in a whole sequence of counter-intuitive and perverse accounts of space, time, discontinuity, and the interaction of the observer with the natural phenomenon. Eternal verities, such as the conservation of energy and the supra-historical character of physical law were progressively undermined [Mirowski, forthcoming]. Things got so bad that physicists started going around telling people that there could be such a thing as a free lunch." l The amazing thing is that much of this drift had been anticipated by Peirce as part of his hypothesis that natural law was itself the product of an evolutionary process. Philosophers of science felt the tremors under their feet in the 1960s. Analytical philosophy of science had not only been subject to devastat- ing internal criticism, but historians of science such as Thomas Kuhn, Paul Forman, Richard Westfall and others were demonstrating that re- spected scientists of the past did not conform to the strict positivist code of correct scientific behavior. Perhaps because they were histo- rians, they grew more curious about the hermeneutic aspects of scien- tific behavior. As Thomas Kuhn, wrote about scientists: "When reading the works of an important thinker, look first for the apparent absurdi- ties in the text and ask yourself how a sensible person could have writ- ten them. When you find an answer, I continue, when those passages make sense, then you may find that more central passages, ones you previously thought you understood, have changed their meaning" [Kuhn 1977, p. xii]. Now, if we have difficulties in understanding the paradigm scientists sanctioned by our culture, it is but a short step to assert that the contemporaries of pivotal scientists also had problems of interpretation and understanding their peers. Explicit rules of deduc- tion and induction could not be expected to resolve this problem in all situations, and as a result the entire Cartesian portrayal of science came unravelled for philosophers [Suppe 1977; Laudan 1984; Rorty 1979, 1986]. By the 1980s, it was common to find historians, philosophers, and sociologists of science employing hermeneutic techniques [Latour and Woolgar 1979; Knorr-Cetina and Mulkay 1983; Radnitzky 1973; Ack- erman 1985]. This development in turn encouraged philosophers to re- discover Peirce and to resuscitate the pragmatist tradition in the United States. Writers such as Richard Rorty, Richard Bernstein and Karl Apel have put pragmatism back on the philosophical map, proposing to re-</page><page sequence="32">1032 Philip Mirowski unite a theory of language and social interaction with a theory of sci- entific inquiry. As Rorty has written of the new pragmatism: [It] is the same as the method of utopian politics or revolutionary science (as opposed to parliamentary politics or normal science). The method is to redescribe lots and lots of things in new ways, until you have created a pattern of linguistic behavior which will tempt the rising genera- tion to adopt it, thereby causing them to look for appropriate new forms of non-linguistic behavior-e.g., the adoption of new scientific equipment or new social institutions. Philosophy, on this model, does not work piece by piece, analyzing concept after concept, or testing thesis after thesis. Rather, it works holistically and pragmatically.... It does not pretend to have a better candidate for doing the same old things which we did when we spoke the old way. Rather, it suggests that we might want to stop doing those things and do something else [Rorty 1986, p. 4]. The irony of this revival was that the legitimate heirs of the tradition of Peirce in economics were basically unaware of it, remaining wedded in many instances to the Cartesian conception of science, which bar- tered away their legitimacy to neoclassical economics. Although many institutionalist economists maintained a lively interest in philosophical issues, they tended to get sidetracked into such controversies as the meaning of Milton Friedman's essay on the "methodology of positive economics" (an article so incoherent that it could support any reading), or else into behavioralism of a mechanistic cast, which neutralized all hermeneutic problems of interpretation. Worst of all, the lavish praise of science that had been a hallmark of institutionalism from the 1930s to the 1960s grew more and more an embarrassment, both because of the overt scientism of neoclassical the- ory, and because of the increasing skepticism about the competence and benevolence of the technocrat in a society where the very institu- tion of science seemed an instrument of subjugation and a juggernaut careening out of control. The tragedy was that institutionalism had lost sight of its bearings, making the mistake of pretending to be a better candidate for doing the same old things that were done when speaking the same old language. In consequence, the research agenda had been set by the neoclassical economists. It was a no-win situation. The Modern Revival of a Pragmatist Institutionalist Economics There is one more nod to be made in the direction of the DMD the- sis, and that is to discuss certain nascent hopeful trends in institutional</page><page sequence="33">The Philosophical Bases of Institutionalist Economics 1033 economics. As the vortex model suggests, one might expect that pro- found transmutations of our "natural" concepts would be felt (perhaps with a lag) in the construction of social theory. I would like to argue that this is indeed the case in some recent institutionalist economic re- search, and that one might extrapolate from present trends to anticipate a full-scale repudiation of Cartesian philosophy of science and an in- creased reliance on hermeneutic conceptions of the economic actor as well as the role of the economic researcher. Twentieth-century innovations in physical science have come quite a distance in denying a mechanically determinate world, reinterpreting our ideas of limitation and scarcity, and filling us with disquiet at the boundlessness of chance, chaos, and emergent novelty. Science is mak- ing us rudely aware of our role in constructing the world, or as Rorty puts it, "making truth." If the DMD thesis is any guide, then we should expect that this progressive awakening should eventually show up in economics. Because neoclassical economics is irreparably committed to the imitation of nineteenth-century physics, the DMD thesis predicts that it will find itself progressively isolated from cultural conceptions, defending an increasingly reactionary conception of Natural Order as mechanically deterministic and static. Institutional economics, on the other hand, with its Peircian pedigree, should be well-positioned to par- ticipate in the reconstruction of economic theory from a hermeneutic perspective. This reconstruction is not merely wishful thinking; there are signs that it is already well under way. Notes 1. Evidence for this assertion is presented in detail in [Mirowski, forthcom- ing, chaps. 4-6]. 2. See, however, Mirowski [1987a; 1988] and Piero Mini [1974]. 3. I must stress that what follows is specifically my own reading of Peirce, although it shares many points with Karl Apel [1981]. We shall ignore in this essay questions of the wellsprings of Peirce's influences, or the tangled question of his metaphysics. We should caution, however, that some au- thors in the institutionalist literature, such as H. Liebhafsky, have tried to absolve Peirce of any Hegelian or Continental influence, a thesis I obvi- ously find unpersuasive [Liebhafsky 1986, p. 13]. On this issue, see C.S. Peirce 1958b, p. 283; H.S. Thayer [1981] and Apel [1981, p. 2OIfn]. 4. '[his assertion ot the selt-correcting nature ot specitically quantitative in- duction is perhaps one of the weakest parts of the Peircian corpus, because it provides no cogent reason for the privileged character of quantitative evidence. On this issue, see Thomas Kuhn [1977]. Further, it is easy to</page><page sequence="34">1034 Philip Mirowski devise numerous situations where repeated measurement does not con- verge upon any particular value. This would be true especially of non- ergodic situations, such as those envisioned in Peirce's own "evolutionary" laws. 5. Peirce made a number of observations on the role of conservation princi- ples in the construction of the static mechanical world picture [Peirce 1935, pp. 15, 20, 1 00]. It is interesting to compare these statements with the defi- nition given below of an institution as a socially constructed invariant. See also Mirowski [1984b]. The role of stochastic phenomena is discussed in my unpublished manuscript, "Uncertain Wavering," discussion paper, Tufts University. 6. Said Peirce: But the higher places in science in the coming years are for those who succeed in adapting the methods of one science to the investigation of another. That is where the greatest progress of the passing genera- tion has consisted in. Darwin adapted biology to the methods of Mal- thus and the economists. [James] Maxwell adapted to the theory of gasses the methods of the doctrine of chances, and to electricity the methods of thermodynamics.... [Antoine-Augustin] Cournot adapted to policital economy the calculus of variations [Peirce 1958a, p. 46]. On this issue, see also Mirowski [1986b]. 7. The reasons for the decline of pragmatism in the 1 940s is beyond our man- date in this article, but see Thayer's Meaning and Action, where it is sug- gested that pragmatism's alliance with liberal social engineering, its misconstrual as a methodological semantic principle, and Dewey's alliance with the logical positivists, particularly in his Theory of Valuation, all served to cripple the program [Thayer 1981, pp. 560-63; Dewey 1939b]. 8. "Addiction to magical superstition or religious conceptions will necessarily have its effect on the conceptions and logic employed in technological the- ory and practice, and will impair its efficiency by that much" [Veblen 1914, p. 41]. Here Veblen clearly understands that science may be influenced by culture as well as vice versa, but notice the derogatory language in reference to non-science, as well as the unfounded assertion that cultural or teleolog- ical influences impair the efficiency of scientific logic. Where the DMD the- sis posits a vortex, Veblen has two poles of a dichotomy, where one can only pollute the other. 9. See footnote 7 above. 10. Conventional histories of economic thought have not given sufficient at- tention to the importance of the institutionalist school for the rise of twentieth-century macroeconomics. Here, see Mirowski [1985]. The posi- tion of the National Bureau of Economic Research as a non-partisan pur- veyor of data and research ended in the 1 970s when Martin Feldstein was installed as director and institutionalist themes disappeared from its agenda. 11. "I have heard it said that there is no such thing as a free lunch. It now appears possible that the universe is a free lunch."
