<plain_text><page sequence="1">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 2001-2002 INTRODUCTION This year my report deals mainly with the work of the years 1996, covered in the latest Deltion Chronika (Vol. 51), and 1999-2001, based on AEMTH volumes 13-14 and reports which have been sent to me, mainly on 2001. The publication 'The work of the Ministry of Culture in the sphere of Cultural Heritage' (Epyov YInnO) has not appeared since vol. 3 for 1999. This is a pity since it provided valuable (if telegraphic) information on recent discoveries of the Archaeological Service. Unfortunately a necessarily earlier deadline for this issue of 'A in G', coupled with a slightly later date than usual for the annual report of the Secretary General of the Archaeological Society of Athens, has made it impossible to take account of the Society's Ergon for 2001 in this issue of 'A in G'; it will of course be covered next year. I should add that the Society's magazine Mentor is also a very good read. For the Deltion Chronika, references to the current volume are given by page number if possible, and without the volume number; references to earlier volumes include the volume number. My work on these sources has been greatly facilitated by the contributions of a number of Members and Students of the School resident in Greece: Eleni Hatzaki (Crete), Iphigenia Tournavitou (prehistoric to Roman central and southern Greece), David Turner (Byzantine Greece, except Crete), Katerina Panagopoulou, Anthi Dipla and Despina Christo- doulou (northern Greece), Rosie Roumelioti (Cyclades and northeast Aegean). Alexandra Villing and Anne Blackman helped with translations and Helen Fields with essential support in editing and sequencing the text, Koula Asiatides, Elina Stamatatou and Vicki Tzavara with typing. Penny Wilson Zarganis drafted the section 'New Publications' and Sandra Pepelasis helped with allocation of material. I am most grateful to all of them, and also to the Editor, Dr Lyn Rodley, for her patience and understanding. I continue to receive favourable comments about the increased number of illustrations, and much appreciate the con- tinued generous support of the Hellenic Society towards the cost of publication; we do however realize the costs involved, and again this year the number of illustrations is somewhat reduced. For an explanation of the types of field work carried out in Greece and their forms of publication, and the other sources of information on which the compiler of 'A in G' can and must draw, I continue to refer the reader to the masterly introduction by Hector Catling to his last contribution (AR 1988-89, 3-8). His contributions have served as my model in the last six years. The economic and touristic development of the country does and will continue to provide a threat to the cultural and natural heritage of Greece; the Archaeological Service makes heroic efforts to limit the damage. Currently a crash construction pro- gramme is under way to prepare for the Athens Olympics in 2004. The cause c6elbre last year was the proposal to hold the rowing events at Marathon, with the construction of a basin in the marsh at Schoinias. Despite determined opposition, partic- ularly by the Archaeological Society, this project has gone ahead. On the other hand, the upgrading of the Phaleron shore- line will be applauded by all. A new draft Archaeological Law was finally presented in parliament at the end of May 2002; as I write the archaeologists of the Archaeological Service are holding protest strikes over its contents. The Parthenon Marbles have remained in the headlines, with a new proposal for the Museum of the Acropolis and debate about the archaeological finds made on the proposed site in Makrygianni. The unification of archaeological sites in Athens continues to make progress, with the closure of Odos Apostolou Pavlou, the northwestward continuation of Odos Dionysiou Areopagitou down towards the Theseion. The outstanding archaeological find of the year was undoubtedly the kouros found in the Kerameikos in early April 2002 (see below). Minoan scholars will be delighted by the reappearance after 73 years of the 'Ring of Minos' (see below and cover illustration). Theft of antiquities remains a problem in Greece, as else- where. We all rejoiced in the recovery in January 2001 of the objects stolen from Corinth Museum in April 1990; a special exhibition was inaugurated in the Museum on 1 December. Again many exhibitions have been held this last year. My personal selection is: 'Byzantium: an Oecumenical Empire' (Athens); 'Byzantine Hours: Works and Days in Byzantium' (also Mystras and Thessaloniki); 'Fragile Luxury: Glass Vessels in the National Archaeological Museum' (Athens); 'Glass of the Sultans'(Athens); and the exhibition in Corinth mentioned above. Museum openings have included the Byzantine Museum at Veroia and the site museum at the temple of Demeter at Gyroula, Sangri (Naxos). Sadly, temporary closures at the National Museum, Olympia Museum and parts of Delphi Museum have been announced for 2002/3. Conferences have covered a wide variety of subjects, such as: 'The Macedonians in Athens, 323-229 BC'; 'Ancient Arcadia'; the 9th Cretological Congress; '15 years of restoration work in the Mediaeval City of Rhodes'; 'Ancient Greece at the turn of the Millennium: Recent Work and Future Perspectives' (to cele- brate the Canadian Institute's 25th anniversary); and 'Inscriptions and the History of Chios'. We applaud the commencement of Phase II of the extension of the Gennadeion Library, inaugurated by the President of the Republic in February 2002; also the news that the trireme Olympias is to undergo a refit. There have been no 'changes at the top' in the Ministry of Culture and Archaeological Service: Mr Evangelos Venizelos remains Minister of Culture, Mr Lazaros Kolonas Director General of Antiquities, Mrs Nicoletta Valakou-Divari Director of Prehistoric and Classical Antiquities and Mr Isidoros Kakouris Director of Byzantine and Mediaeval Antiquities; Mrs Eleni Korka has become Head of the Department of Foreign Schools. We wish them all well, and I should like to thank them for the support which they give to the work of the Foreign Schools in Greece. We report with sadness the deaths of notable figures in Greek archaeology: Angelos Choremis, William Coulson, Jos De Waele, Jale Inan, Gregorios Konstantinopoulos, Nikos Papadakis and Jeanne Robert. I close the introduction to my last 'A in G' with a mixture of nostalgia and relief: I have tried to make 'A in G' a useful prac- tical tool; I hope the increased amount of illustration has helped; and I feel it could be better if one had more research support. Not for the first time, I view the French model with admiration and a certain envy. One of the fascinations of compiling 'A in G' is to lear so much about what is being achieved by col- leagues; the principal frustration is that one is left with no time to visit them. This I hope to put right in the future! I wish my successor, James Whitley, good luck as he takes over as 21st Director of the British School on October 1st, 2002. It is an exciting, challenging and rewarding post, in one of the liveliest centres of modem European culture.</page><page sequence="2">2 DAVID BLACKMAN NEW PUBLICATIONS 2001-2002 Where a Greek publication is available in translation, this is indicated in square brackets, e.g [Eng]; a bilingual text in a sin- gle volume is shown thus: [Gr/Eng] Archaeological Service (all published Athens 2001): in the series A rto(teiSgo?aTa Tzo ApXatoXoytKoU Ac?Tio)D: 75.

Athens, agora: material re-used in Byzantine wall ATHENS Agora. John McK.

NW area: In section BZ the excavations continued to expose the MByz settlement of the 11 th Ct. For the most part we exca- vated through and under the lowest floor levels, digging into fill representing the abandonment of the area in the 7th to 9th Cts AD and exposing the upper parts of the LR walls beneath. The Byz house walls, built of irregular stones set in clay with a fair admixture of reused material (Figs 1 and 2), were exposed to their full depth. A tile- and stone-lined well was partially exca- vated; the lining had collapsed where it passes through DA lev- els and final excavation will have to wait for next season. A fair</page><page sequence="5">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 2001-2002 5 3. &amp; 4. Athens, agora: herm fragments amount of glazed and sgraffito pottery from the lining suggests either that the well is one of the later features to survive on the site, dating to the 12th or 13th Cts AD or, more probably, that a late attempt was made to reline the upper part of the well. A sec- ond feature uncovered this year was a stone-lined cess-pit, placed in the road just outside the house. It was well preserved, with a cover slab in place, along with a drain leading into it from the adjacent house. It is the first such installation for household waste to have been uncovered or recognized in this neighborhood. In the S area a large plaster-lined pit-perhaps the lower part of a cistern-produced pottery of the 12th and 13th Cts along with large chunks of roof tiles. At the extreme N end of section BZ a serious and successful attempt to clear up the area of a modem basement was carried out. The churned-up fill included fragments of terracotta wheels and figurines of the sort found in large quantities in a shallow pit just a few meters to the E-evidence of coroplasts at work here in the R period (J 1: 1-Hesperia 65 [1996] 239-241, and pl. 69). Section BZ continued to produce assorted fragments of herms (Figs 3 and 4), adding to the corpus of such monuments recovered from the NW comer of the agora, which was known in antiquity as 'the Herms' because of the large number dedi- cated there. Herms were used to mark the entrances of houses and shrines all over Athens and they are concentrated in our area because we are excavating the principal entrance to the agora, along the Panathenaic Way, and therefore a suitable loca- tion for the erection of public herms. To date, parts of 17 have been found in the area N of Hadrian Street. Also somewhere in this vicinity stood the Stoa of the Herms, referred to in ancient sources from the 5th to the 2nd Ct BC; thus far it is either unex- cavated or unrecognized. In Section BE we continued work in the C shop building. In the southernmost room excavations beneath the floor produced yet another HL pyre deposit (J 3: 7, Fig. 5). These shallow pits, full of small-scale vases, traces of burning and a few bones, rep- resent a ritual not attested in the literature. They are found in houses and shops, almost never in public buildings or sanctuar- ies, so they seem to be an expression of private cult activity. The vases indicate that dining and drinking were part of the cere- mony, while the invariable presence of a lamp perhaps suggests that the rite was nocturnal. The BE shop building has a higher concentration of these little deposits (seven) than anywhere else in the excavations. Deposit J 3: 7 contained about 20 pots and a lamp dating to ca 350-275 BC. Further work was done in both of the Myc chamber tombs, partially excavated in previous seasons and dated to the 14th Ct BC. In the southernmost grave, enthusiastic pumping by the Metro company had lowered the water table sufficiently to allow us to clear the last of the bones scattered on the floor. The large number of additional bones may require a reassessment of the full complement of individuals buried in the tomb, present- ly estimated at two adult males, an adult female, and a child. In the northern tomb we removed the end of R wall C and finally exposed the entranceway or dromos into the tomb. The door- way, partially cut by the 5th-Ct well excavated during the past two seasons, was blocked with stones. The dromos itself approaches the tomb from the W, entering at the N end of the W side of the chamber. Set near the center of the dromos, some 2.50m from the blocked door, was the lower part of a large grey-ware Lesbian amphora, dating to the 1st half of the 5th Ct BC. The top had been shaved off in antiquity, at the same level as the preserved top of the dromos. Within the amphora was some charcoal and ash, together with a single large iron nail. The NE comer of a third Myc chamber tomb was uncov- ered this season, just S of the dromos described above. It seems from its alignment to be somewhat earlier, perhaps of the 15th Ct BC. The cutting was full of large stones, several 5. Athens, agora: Hellenistic pyre deposit</page><page sequence="6">6 DAVID BLACKMAN 8. Athens, acropolis slopes: horse skull vases (Figs 6 and 7), and a pile of bones. Much more work will have to be done on this tomb; like the others it is largely obscured by later walls and installations. Acropolis slopes. In section EA we continued to dig in the area just S of and uphill from the Eleusinion, along the E face of the LR fortification wall. A handful of LR sherds found in the f1ll presumably reflects its construction in the years around AD 280. For the most part we encountered a thick layer filled with fragmentary pottery mostly of the late 3rd and early 2nd Cts BC; included were numerous bg kantharoi, mould-made bowls, bee- hives, and examples of West Slope ware. Also recovered were numerous fragments of worked bone, several dozen loomweights, many stamped amphora handles (most from the island of Rhodes and others from Knidos), the partial remains of two or three horses: skulls (Fig. 8), vertebrae and leg bones, par- tially articulated, and fragments of terracotta figurines (Fig. 9). There is no obvious historical or archaeological event to account for this deposit, nor any certainty that it is in primary deposition here. Somewhat puzzling is the fact that this materi- al lies directly over bedrock, leaving no sign of earlier activity in the area. In the final hours we uncovered the shaft of an unlined well cut through bedrock; the upper fill was HL. A few irregularly placed post-holes were encountered in the bedrock; when excavated lower down the hill they have usually been interpreted as sockets for anchoring wooden bleachers (ikria), set up for spectators watching parades or chariot races along the Panathenaic Way (Athenaios 4. 167f).' Athens city: the Metro. For a helpful plan see ADelt vol 1 Fig.A (end of volume); see also synopsis in AR 1999-2000, 10-12. Syntagma Station. In the W part of the square was revealed part of the so-called 'Pisistratean' aqueduct, which provided Athens with water from the Ilissos springs on Mt Hymettus. The drain was placed in a long rock-cut trench, investigated for a length of 42.82m, which was 53-94cm wide and ca 2m deep, with a S-N direction and slope (Fig. 10). The 73 different pipes recorded (I. 57-60cm, di. 23cm), which were decorated with black bands, not only fitted into each other, but the resulting joints were sealed with lead. On the upper sides they bore semi- circular cleaning holes, sealed with clay lids and schist slabs. The excavated section, a later westward extension or branch of the original 6th-Ct BC aqueduct discovered in Leoforos Amalias (AR 1999-2000, 7), can be dated in the 1St half of the 5th Ct BC. Also discovered in the same general area were 15 cuttings, some rectangular, the remnants of destroyed tombs of the ceme- tery lining the road towards the Mesogeia demes, and some cir- cular, which were associated with the bronze-working work- shops on Leoforos Amalias (ADelt 49, 28-29), with air-shafts, remains of bronze-slag, and fragments of moulds.

Athens, acropolis slopes: terracotta figurine fragments In the SW part of the square, excavations unearthed six tombs (one ash-urn, and f1ve rock cuttings), part of the ceme- tery lining the road towards the Mesogeia region, which date from LC to R times (ADelt 42-3). In the N part of the Agnostos Stratiotes square, were recorded a ll-shaped drain, running E-W, sections of two walls, a destroyed shaft-grave, and five workshop-type cuttings containing bronze-slag and LC sherds, which were probably part of the continuation of the Leoforos Amalias workshop installations. On Leoforos Amalias were excavated part of a Il-shaped drain, running N-S, the corner of an ossuary, containing 16 skulls and a few bronze offerings, and 13 successive road surfaces, running E-W, the latter probably associated with a gate to the S of the Leochares gate. In one of the tunnels for the new Metro, in front of the W entrance into the National Gardens, was discovered an under- ground drain, with an apsidal roof, running S-N (I. 11.35m, w. 40cm, h. lm), while 16 ancient wells were recorded in other tunnels in the area. (ADelt 43-44) In the excavations of Odos Amerikes were discovered 209 graves, part of the extensive E cemetery of the city of Athens, originally identified in Odos Karageorges Servias, in many parts of Odos Stadiou and along Odos Panepistemiou and Amerikes, with Odos Gregoriou V as its W limit. The tombs included 63 pit-graves, 42 child larnakes, 32 tile-roofed graves, 27 pot-buri- als, 24 cremations, 10 simple burials, two poros sarcophagi, two hut-shaped tombs, and an adult larnax burial. The majority of the tombs (148) which were those of adults (146), contained funer- al offerings, and can be dated to the C period (5th_4th Ct BC). There were also 10 graves of the R period, and a few belonging to the transition from the A to the C period. Deserving special mention are a wg lekythos (ca 420 BC), decorated with a 'visit to the tomb' scene, and a 400 BC rf pyxis, with blue and white colours and details in relief. In the NW section of the area was recorded a retaining wall, running E-W, associated with a stream (the Eridanos), and traces of a workshop area, an usual phenomenon in the vicinity of cemeteries. (ADelt 44) In the process of tunnelling through the National Gardens, a rock-cut tunnel was discovered, possibly part of an anc. aque- duct, running NE-SW, which communicated with an anc. well. In the W part of the area was recorded part of the Valerian cir- cuit, running NW-SE, and parallel to it a drain with an apsidal roof. The wall, 3m wide, was preserved to a height of five courses, with two stone faces and a rubble interior. To its W was also reported part of a semi-circular construction, possibly a cis- tern, built with baked bricks, and coated with plaster on the inte- rior. Both the cistern and a part of the Valerian wall collapsed as a result of underground tremors caused by the metro tunnelling. (ADelt 44-6) 10. Athens, Syntagma station: drain pipe</page><page sequence="8">8 DAVID BLACKMAN 11. Athens, Odos Rigilles: gymnasium of the Lykeion Odos Rigilles. Archaeological investigations in the S half of the plot revealed the foundations of the palaistra of the gymna- sium of the Lykeion (N, E, W sides), which continued to the S, towards the Odeion of Athens and the old bed of the Ilissos river. The building has been greatly damaged, from the 19th Ct to the 1960s, especially by the installations of a military camp. Most of the surviving walls lie on the local bedrock, and follow its sloping course. (Fig. 11; see also AR 1996-97, 8-10) The building consisted of a central rectangular court, 23m wide, running N-S, and surrounded by stoas on all three sides. To the E, W and N extend symmetrically-placed rectangular rooms, while in the centre of the N side a single rectangular room stands out on account of its size; this was probably the ephebeion, with other symmetrical rooms aligned on either side (probably the elaiothesion:oiling room, the koniste- rion, and the korykeion). The width of the N stoa is 4m, while that of the E and W stoas is 3.50m. To the same complex belong two hypocausts, part of the bathing installations, one on the NE, the other on the NW side, with their respective furnace chambers and tanks, while in the centre of the N side of the court was recorded a tank for cold baths, with semi- circular ends, and plastered walls; to the S, the tank is connected to a well and to a built drain, which ran l down to the Ilissos river (it sloped towards the S). E of the tank lay a well, lined with clay rings. All the floors of the building were of trodden earth. The palaistra was apparently constructed in the last quarter of the 4th Ct BC, while LA pottery sug- gests an earlier use of the area. Towards the start of the 1st Ct AD, clearly after the Sullan destruction, the superstructure of the building was reconstructed, and the two hypocausts were added. The tank next to the 4th-Ct BC well was also built after the 1st Ct AD. After the Herulian destruction (AD 267), destruction deposits were piled up over the old floors, and the palaistra was repaired and re-used. The final destruction occurred towards the end of the 4th Ct AD, after which the site was abandoned. The identification of the building with the gymnasium of the Lykeion is corroborated by a number of factors, including its dimensions, the long duration of its use, which suggests that it was an important public building, always repaired on the same general plan after successive destructions, and finally the descriptions in the written sources (Strabo, Pausanias, Plutarch), especially as regards its location. (ADelt 46-8) In Odos Daidalou were reported LR remains and a re-used column drum, bearing inscribed masonry signs, probably from the Ares temple, which in the R period had been moved to the anc. agora. (ADelt 48-9)</page><page sequence="9">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 2001-2002 9 The various remains of mostly C and R date recorded along Odos Phalerou included two drains, a child burial, part of a cis- tern, and sections of walls, parts of two retaining walls belong- ing to C roads, one with 11 road surfaces preserved, part of another anc. road, used from C to R times and leading towards the Allade gates and Phaleron, part of a 3rd-Ct AD semicircular workshop installation, and sections of two buildings, one of which is dated in the 5th Ct BC (ADelt 49-50). Fragmentary architectural elements, including an inscribed funerary column of the 1st Ct BC/1st Ct AD, were recorded in Odos Erechtheiou and Odos Demophontos, while in Odos Dryopon, in an area with C pottery workshops a C apothetes was discovered, dated to 460-350 BC (ADelt 50-1). Fragmentary foundations and drains of various periods were unearthed in Odos Krieze, an area which was apparently densely occupied in antiquity (ADelt 51-2). In Odos Armodiou part of a LHL building was discov- ered, including an atrium laid with a simple pebble mosaic, under which was found a C well; it was associated with sections of walls to the S, as well as an apsidal structure of LR date to the SE. (ADelt 52) Excavations in Odos Platonos, Vasilikon and Kratylou have revealed sections of two anc. roads, the first an A road (four road surfaces) 4m wide, running SW-NE, used at least until ER times and possibly connecting the Academy with the area of Hippios Kolonos. The other, running SE-NW along Odos Platonos, was part of the funeral road (five road surfaces), connecting the Dipylon gate with the Academy, and used from C to R times. To the NW of the junction of the two roads was located the entrance to the Academy. In LR times at least the SW part of the funeral road was used as a cemetery, while in the 5th-6th Cts AD, when this cemetery was no longer in use, a building of probably public character was erected along the SW side of the road; its NE side was covered by stone paving. (ADelt 53-6) Hadrian's Library. The excavations to the SW of the facade of the building (Fig. 12) revealed the N face of a section of the LR wall, located on the line of the S wing of the library (present 1. 17.80m, h. 3m), with a white marble toichobate, and orthostats of re-used, grey Hymettos marble, material probably removed from the R agora. A section of this wall preserves an irregular style of masonry above the toichobate, which suggests that this was the position of a gate, opened at a later date (ca 14th Ct AD), to provide access to a road passing in front of the R agora and Hadrian's Library in a N-S direction. This road, as well as the 'wide road' connecting the anc. and R agoras, was covered with deposits postdating the 8th Ct AD, at which time the N-S road was moved to the E, closer to the facade of the R agora; this neces- sitated the opening of another gate in the fortifica- tions to the E of Odos Areos. At a much later date, - possibly in the 18th Ct AD when the Voevodaliki of Hadji Ali Haseki was built over the WSW part of the library, the gate was probably blocked haphazardly. Byz remains were reported in two areas of the excavation: ca 14m W of the facade of the library, a section of fallen wall was probably part of a destroyed building of the 2nd half of the 7th Ct AD, while ca 22m W of the same facade were discovered the remains of two narrow drains and of a well, dated in the 12th--13th Cts AD. Along the LR wall was also uncovered the con- tinuation of the R court, which originally extended below Odos Areos. The substructure of the court consisted of reddish kourasani, with traces of slabs, including a section of marble flooring; the central 13. Athen slabs in this section were made of grey marble, with traces of an incised zodiac circle. It was observed that the slabs were not all of Pentelic marble, nor were they all rectangular, nor do they run N-S, as do the slabs along the facade of the building. These slabs were placed along the line of the LR wall in an E-W direction, and have been disturbed twice: one disturbance included architectural members of the Middle Stoa of the anc. agora, placed below the substructure of the court (six parts of columns). Many of the fragments in the vicinity of the columns were of Phrygian marble, which suggests that they belong to the interior peristyle of Hadrian's Library. This and pottery dating from the late 3rd/early 4th Ct AD indicate that the flooring of the court, at least in this section, was not contemporary with the library itself, but was constructed after the destruction of the interior peristyle of the monument, and the building of the LR wall (after the 4th Ct AD). It is possible that this flooring of the court was executed by Herculius, the Illyrian governor, who repaired the library, as well as other monuments. A statue of Herculius was set up in gratitude in the propylon of the build- ing by the sophist Plutarch (IG II2, 4224). Investigation of the N oikos has revealed that the founda- tions of the stylobate of the building consisted of poured con- crete (opus incertum), with stone courses (euthynteria) above, while the foundation of its N wall-peribolos included seven poros blocks of uneven height. In the fill were discovered fres- co fragments imitating marble, terracotta roof-tiles, fragments of mud-brick, coins and pottery, mostly dating from the 1St Ct BC-lst/2nd Ct AD, which suggests that the area was used for domestic occupation from the HL to the ER period, when the library was finally erected. (ADelt 25-32) Recent clearance and investigations in the area have result- ed in an informed overview of the extant remains (Fig. 13). The N oikos was revealed in its entire height (eight courses of poros blocks and a string-course) as was a large section of the N peri- bolos and the peristyle to the W of the Oikos. The latter formed the continuation of the N peribolos and is characterized by the same structural principles (isodomic masonry). The length of the peribolos between the Oikos and the exedrae is 28.05m, while the interior of the Oikos itself is 10.20m x 5.80m. The thinness of the walls suggests that both the Oikos and the exe- drae were provided with a wooden roof, while the walls were veneered with marble.

Athens, Keramelkos: sphlnx of an Ionic column; the forepart of the lion; the sphinx frag- ment; the kouros; the capital of a Doric column and a recumbent lion. Except for the Doric capital, which is of poros, all the sculptures are of marble. They were carefully buried, as is shown by the poros blocks buried between them, mostly by the head. A wheel rut running across them and beyond indicates that they were laid here to consolidate the road at a point where apparently it was continually flooded and covered with mud. The sphinx (Fig. 17) dates to ca 560 BC and is in the reverse position to its sister, which had been found in 1906 immediate- ly S of the Sacred Gate and is now in the National Museum in Athens. Both the lions are also to be dated to the 2nd quarter of the 6th Ct.

(ADelt 32) National Museum. In addition to routine restoration work, the recording of antiquities in the various departments and a num- ber of scheduled architectural repairs, which were conducted during 1996, the museum organized the exhibition: 'The Aedonia Treasure. Seals and jewellery of the Late Bronze Age, in the Aegean' (June-August 1996, December 1996-September 1997), hosted an exhibition organized by the French School at Athens ('Greek space. 150 years of excavations of the French Archaeological School at Athens') and contributed to the trav- elling exhibition of the Museum of Cycladic Art: 'Neolithic Civilisation'. The results of analysis of the EMyc amber from the muse- um, in the Berlin Museum of Prehistory and Proto-history, sug- gest that all the amber originated from the Baltic, while the chemical analysis of the bronze statue of Zeus/Poseidon, dated ca 460-450 BC, revealed that it was made of unleaded bronze, a common alloy for statues in the A and C periods. Among acquisitions of the museum are a funerary lekythos with a dexiosis scene in relief, dated to the late 5th/early 4th Ct BC, and a funerary stele from N Greece, with three female fig- ures (pudicitia-type), of R date. (ADelt 1-10) A dramatic rediscovery was reported to the press in early April 2002. Dr Lena Papazoglou, Curator of the Prehistoric Collection, explains: 'The gold signet ring known as the 'ring of Minos' has been surrounded by legend since the time of its first, accidental, dis- covery near the 'Temple Tomb' at Knossos in 1928. It had cap- tured the imagination of Sir Arthur Evans, who gave it its name, and became a subject of controversy between Sp. Marinatos and N. Platon, then Ephor and Curator respectively at the Herakleion Museum, with Platon arguing for the authenticity of the ring. Considered lost since 1930, photographs and the cast of the ring made at that time, as well as a replica made by Gilli6ron for Arthur Evans (now in the Ashmolean Museum) provided mate- rial for meticulous studies over the years on the iconography of the ring that took into account new excavation finds. It was thus with great astonishment that I realized that I was looking at the 'ring of Minos', first on the photographs given to the Greek Ministry of Culture by its present owner and then at the ring itself (cover illustration). The signet ring, together with p!| |3 another gold ring of LHL/ER g8 11ulb * date, was handed over to the !I General Director of Antiquities 1 ,1 Dr Lazaros Kolonas in May 2001 and since then it has been ! kept in the Prehistoric l A9 _ Collection of the National Archaeological Museum. ;,~. , r 'The 'ring of Minos' was thor- Jf~i a iu oughly studied in the Chemical 71-I ^ , l - Lab of the National Museum (Dr E.

Athens, National Museum: Boeotian figurine of its manufacture were all taken into consideration to answer the puzzling question of the authenticity of the ring. The Ashmolean Museum, at our request, has provided information and photographs of the two replicas of the ring that are kept in Oxford. The Scientific Committee, appointed by the Ministry of Culture in February 2002, has finally confirmed the authentici- ty of the ring which, after seventy years, will eventually find its way back to Herakleion Museum.' This took place on 23 July 2002. I also illustrate the female figurine that inspired the Olympic Games' mascot (Fig. 21). This figurine and some other relevant objects are now presented in room 34 (room of the altar) in the Museum. The catalogue reads as follows: '5635. Boeotian female bell-shaped figurine with movable legs. Hand-made. Bell-shaped body with modelled breasts and high neck ending in a bird-like face. Earrings were probably fitted on the large pierced ears. The arms, in the gesture of epiphany or adoration, are rendered as two flat projections with seven fin- gers. The large legs end in five and six toes respectively. On the top of the head a suspension hole. Red paint has been used for the decoration of the dress and shoes. From Thebes. Beginning of 7th Ct B.C.' This figurine has been the source of inspiration for the 2004 Olympic Games' mascot, Phoibos and Athena. ATTIKA Eleusis. Five rescue excavations were reported from the mod. town of Eleusis, including sections of roads, domestic build- ings, and tombs. In Odos Perikleous, were discovered the remains of a R drain, channelling rain water from the sanctuary to the sea; the drain was located over a LC-EHL road, connect- ing both the sanctuary and the city with the anc. port (width: 7m). (ADelt 56-7) At the junction of Odos Demetros with the national road from Athens to Corinth, LR remains were recorded, located over an earlier cemetery of LC-HL date, as well as part of the Sacred Way, S of which lay the LR remains. (ADelt 57-8) Part of a R farmhouse of the 2nd half of the 6th Ct AD was excavated in Odos Rega Pheraiou, ca 800m N/NE of the acropolis hill of the anc. city, including an olive-press installa- tion in the W part of the building. The area of the olive-press was partly underground, and consisted of a stone press with a spout on a built base; before the spout lay a stone receptacle for the oil, in which were found a jug and a clay funnel. Also dis- covered in the same plot were a marble mortarium for olive- grinding and the E retaining wall of a LC road, leading from Eleusis to Mt Pames. (ADelt 58) Finally, remains of two pot-burials of the 5th Ct BC were recorded in Odos Ploutonos, and a row of five tombs of C date were excavated in Odos Ioannou Agathou. (ADelt 57) Laureotike. A MH settlement has been located on the peninsu- la of Ag. Nikolaos Anavyssou, including two pithos burials by the coast, remains of buildings along the SW, W and N sides, part of a room on the S side, with a yellow trodden earth floor, and small pithoid vases, set in small hollows in the floor, as well as remains of a hearth. The finds include matt-painted and grey Minyan pottery, as well as stone tools. (ADelt 65-6) At the site of Bertseko, after a geophysical sdrvey of the area, the remains of a spiral and a flat washing installation were investigated. The former, which had been completely destroyed,</page><page sequence="13">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 2001-2002 13 preserved a diameter of ca 6m per spiral. The flat washing installation, ca 1.50m to the NE, was provided with square set- tling basins, and had a single room to its W; the large circular water cistern of the complex lay to its N. The extant pottery sug- gests that the complex was used in the late 4th/early 3rd Ct BC, as well as during the R period. (ADelt 66) A looted funeral peribolos, with the remains of two tombs of late 5th and 4th Ct BC date, was discovered in the area Demoliaki-Barbaliaki, while to the NW of the peribolos were recorded the remains of a farm, those of another building to the SE, and parts of a rectangular and a circular funeral peribolos, in the same area. The presence of funeral buildings and peri- boloi along the mod. road NATO-Santerina, suggests that the same road was used in antiquity, to connect the mines and the deme of Sounion with the demes of Vesa and Amphitrope and the Mesogeia region. (ADelt 65) Thorikos. On the old dirt road from the Kavodokano area an anc. metal-working workshop was investigated: a large com- plex, surrounded by a strong wall of large stones, well-pre- served only on the E side, where the entrance was also located (marble threshold with pivot holes, for a double door). The same entrance was also used by carts for the transport of metal- lurgical products (wheelmarks). Within the peribolos were pre- served two flat installations for the washing of the metal ores, olive-presses, storage areas, and a well. To the W of the work- shop lay the remains of a large building, probably used as quar- ters for the workers or for the owner. The rooms were built in an L-shaped arrangement. For the foundation of the walls, the bedrock was extensively cut back on the W, while the vertical face of the rock was used as the W limit of the building. The bedrock, on which the E wall of the workshop was founded, bore the inscription: OPO[Z] cIAOK[PATOY?], with possibly the word for workshop (ergasterion) in between. The pottery belonged to the 4th and the 1st half of the 3rd Ct BC. (ADelt 65) Markopoulo. During preparatory work for the construction of the Olympic Games' equestrian facilities, the discovery of a shrine of Aphrodite is reported (Greek press, March 2002). Megara. Of the 14 rescue excavations carried out in 1996 in the mod. town, the vast majority involved funerary remains, as well as a number of private houses and a section of the anc. fortifi- cations. The latter, excavated in Odos P. Georgake, is pre- served to a thickness of 3.50m and constructed of large rectan- gular poros blocks, with a statue/inscription base before its S face. (ADelt 63-4) In Odos I. Metaxa the S part (three rooms) of a HL build- ing were investigated, as well as 4th-Ct BC remains, the S part of a very disturbed area, with sections of a laid floor and a trape- zoidal basin cut in the bedrock (ADelt 62-3). The E part of another HL building was recorded in Parodos Korae, outside the city walls (ADelt 64), while the remains of a LR/ECh house were excavated in Odos Mykenon (ADelt 62). Finally, four areas of a LR house were investigated in Odos Theseos, pre- serving a small section of a stone slab floor, plastered walls, and a cistern to the W. (ADelt 61) Funerary remains: in Odos Eukleidou, 600m to the NW of the mod. city, were excavated six tombs (stone sarcophagi), part of the large cemetery located in the area, and dating from the 5th- st Cts BC (ADelt 58-60). In Odos Ag. Varvaras, in the NE section of the plot, were discovered three tombs, a cist-tomb and two sarcophagi, in addition to the 13 graves discovered in the same area in the past, dated to the 5th Ct BC and the MHL peri- od (ADelt 60-1). Three tombs, part of an extensive cemetery of the 4th Ct BC and the EHL period, were located by the road to Chani, 350m from the church ofAg. Ioannes (ADelt 62). 22. Palaios Oropos: prehistoric house Three sarcophagi of the 6th Ct BC were reported in Odos Siphnidon (ADelt 62), two other graves (one cist and one sar- cophagus) were excavated in Odos I. Metaxa, and in Odos P. Georgake were discovered three tombs of the end of the 6th Ct BC, predating the section of C fortification walls in the same plot (ADelt 63-4). One of the tombs contained a disintegrated skeleton, with two broken eggs between its legs, and a small bronze pierced object on its chest. Finally two LA sarcophagi were recorded 350m W of the Exo Vryse bridge and in Odos Thevon, respectively (ADelt 61). Palaios Oropos. In Odos Dexamenes, ca 4km to the NW of Skala Oropou, at the foot of Mt Maurovouno, were located PR remains, dating from the end of the MH/transition to LH I peri- od, including a large part of a house, the exterior wall of a sec- ond house and a road between them (Fig. 22). Within the first house were found three cist tombs, a pithoid stamnos and other matt-painted pottery, as well as an apothetes with Myc pottery. (ADelt 66-7) Two EHL tombs (one cist, one hut-shaped) were recorded at the junction of Odos 25 Martiou and Kyprou, in the mod. town of Chalkoutsi Oropou. (ADelt 67-9) Pallini. A large N settlement was discovered during construc- tion of the Attiki Odos. Piraeus. Zea Harbour. Bjoer Loven (Danish Institute) sur- veyed the E part of the anc. Zea harbour with a permit from the EEA. He reports: 'The focus of the 2001 survey was the area in front of the ship-sheds excavated by Dragatzes and D6rpfeld. The only struc- tures exposed in the 1885 excavation which are still accessible are the upper parts of two ship-sheds and parts of a third pre- served in the basement of the comer building Odos Serangeiou 1; two columns are preserved in the pavement outside the building. The modem building and the ship-shed remains inside were sur- veyed electronically to create a frame of reference for the archi- tectural remains preserved in the harbour basin. In the harbour basin we found substantial remains of the slipways and other structures that will add significantly to the understanding of the architecture and function of the ship-sheds</page><page sequence="14">14 DAVID BLACKMAN 23. Salamis, Kanakia site and the topography of the anc. Zea harbour. The total length of the slipways was established, and Zea is the only ship-shed where the total length of the buildings has been determined. The most important discovery of the survey is that so much of the anc. Zea harbour is preserved in the sea. In addition, the survey of the ship-sheds in front of Odos Serangeiou 1 will be of great significance for understanding the overall dimensions of the trireme and other types of ancient warships, and of course the architecture and function of these important buildings. The electronic survey was carried out with the help of Mr Richard Anderson.' Salamis. Kanakia. Prof. Yannos G. Lolos (University of Ioannina) reports on his 2001 discoveries concerning Myc Salamis: 'Systematic excavation conducted by a team from the University of Ioannina at Kanakia in September-October 2001 brought to light two large adjacent buildings, situated at the higher levels of the acropolis, and containing ceramic evidence of destruction or abandonment in the LH IIIC:early phase. They apparently belong to an extensive building complex, perhaps the most important one at the site, with well-organized central functions. Access to it was possible through an impressive entrance functioning as a check-point (Fig. 23: site plan). Industrial unit IA, measuring 11.5 x 18 m, is a large 'corri- dor-type' building, with architectural parallels at Mycenae, Tiryns, Menelaion and Iolkos. It comprises workshops and rooms for storage (basements), arranged at two successive lev- els (Fig. 24 ). Among the contents of the workshops in the upper 24.

Salamis, Kanakia: building IB IIIC:early date, a small 'compressed' vessel of lead and a pierced pyramidal object of stone (weight). Incorporated in the architectural plan of partly excavated building IB (Fig. 25), in use in LH IIIB-IIIC:early times, are a massive tower-like structure (1) and a strong composite entrance of unusual type, flanked on the one side by a guard- room or porter's lodge (5-7). It is a twin triangular gate that has no LMyc parallels on the Greek Mainland or Cyprus. The presence of archers and slingers among the guard of the gate can be surmised by the discovery, in the destruction layer, of a stone 'arrowshaft straightener' and a sling-stone (Fig. 26), near the large threshold of the gate, in addition to a complete bronze knife from the uppermost fill of a nearby room or passage cer- tainly destroyed by fire (room 3). The involvement of archers and slingers in warfare is documented from passages in the Iliad. In pictorial art they are depicted, in common defensive array, on the famous 'Silver Siege Rhyton' of the 16th Ct BC, from shaft grave IV in royal Grave Circle A at Mycenae. Evidence for the external relations and trade contacts of this major Salaminian settlement is already provided by a number of finds including pieces of grey andesite stone and clay tripod cooking-pots very probably from Aigina; a painted jug with side strainer-spout from a room adjacent to building IA (Fig. 27), a ceramic type with a notable diffusion in the Aegean and very much in evidence on Rhodes and in the Dodecanese in the LH IIIC period; and also a large fragment of a copper oxhide ingot of certain Cypriot provenance (see AR 2000-01, 15, Fig. 30; also Y.G. Lolos, in Enalia, vol. VI, in press), of a type that is well known from the cargo of the Cape Gelidonya wreck, of ca 1200 BC, and from Mycenae. On all the evidence, the Myc polis at Kanakia, placed among the states of Athens and the Argolid, is 'Old Salamis', 'desert- ed' in Strabo's time (IX.1.9). Its total desolation after ca 1150 BC, now inviting various interpretations, is vividly reflected in the archaeological record.' Voula. Parts of two one-room buildings, separated by a narrow corridor/road, and dated in the 2nd quarter of the 5th Ct BC, were investigated in Odos Achilleos, while a section of a retaining wall belonging to an anc. road, running parallel to Odos Eleutherias, was recorded in Odos Varnale.

Debris from the modem farmstead was removed, including the standing ruins of the stables, as were the excavation dumps from the investigations of Sam Wide and Lennart Kjellberg in 1894. All worked stones were collected inside the fence of the sanctuary, while soils (approximately 210m3) were transported away and dumped. Besides a couple of fragments of architectural terracottas, the old excavation dumps contained only fragments of very worn tiles.

A fragment of a marble relief (right leg of a male figure wearing an himation) of the 4th-3rd Ct BC, re-used as building material, as well as a marble anthemion (ca 500 BC), were col- lected from private houses. Fragments of marble architectural members of LR and ECh date were recorded at the site Diaselli tou Otzia, on the N coast of Kea, possibly the site of an ECh basilica. (ADelt 37-8) Kythera The Kythera Island Project undertook its fourth field season in the summer of 2001, deploying the largest team to date (40-50 people) to complete the intensive survey on schedule, and mak- ing good progress with the study of material, the geoarchaeo- logical fieldwork and other inter-disciplinary research. Dr Cyprian Broodbank (BSA) writes: 'The season opened with the analysis of pottery from 21 sites plus a sample of the tract material by Broodbank (UCL), Johnston (UCL), Kiriatzi (Fitch Laboratory, BSA) and Vroom (Leiden), the major new challenges being characterization of the EBA pottery, the creation of a typology for the post-R mate- rial, and the investigation of off-site finds from tract-walking. In tandem, a third geoarchaeological season by Frederick and Krachtopoulou (Sheffield) with Kousoulakou (Fitch Laboratory, BSA) completed the mapping of soils, geomor- phology, land-use and the consequent visibility or survival of archaeological sites in the heavily alluviated and terraced coastal region ofPalaiopolis, complementing similar work done around Mitata in 2000, as well as generating detailed geoar- no. of sites , \C ,, E, C I Late Neolithic Early Bronze Age First Palace Second Palace Third Palace Early Iron Age X "u Geometric cr _ &lt; Archaic Classical o Classical 0.

Research by Rackham (Cambridge) and Moody (Baylor) on Kytheran vegetation continued, analysis of the island's settlement over the past 500 years through archival sources was initiated by Bennet (Oxford) and Davies (Cincinnati), and Vardaki undertook a pilot study of the anthro- pology of island identities. In addition, GIS analysis of the pro- ject's data is being undertaken year-round by Bevan (UCL), as is ongoing petrological analysis of fabrics and clays by Kiriatzi. In the intensive field survey, tract-walking concentrated in the SW sector, centred on the inland basin of Livadi, with minor infilling elsewhere, but a distinctive feature of the 2001 season was the priority given, in terms of person-hours, to a major pro- gramme of gridded collection of a sample of material from most of the sites found by the survey. Highlights in 2001 included a big LN lithic site near Kastri, several EM III-MM IA coastal sites around the bay, the only G sherds from the survey (found near the polis), and more abundant Byz to early Venetian mate- rial than encountered hitherto, mostly in the vicinity of Livadi. Preston (Cambridge) documented known tombs within the sur- vey area. By the end of the season, the overall 1998-2001 total stood at ca 8700 tracts, covering 43 km2 in a combination of N-S transects and expanded coverage of areas of special inter- est (Fig. 28). In all, 185 concentrations have been allocated site status (a figure liable to rise slightly as a result of ongoing study), of which 120 were gridded, and most of the remainder</page><page sequence="17">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 2001-2002 17 covered by less intensive controlled collection. Overall, the temporal 'spikes' in the rural landscape remain EBA, Second Palace (a minimum of 88 sites contain a component of this date), C, LR and Late Venetian to Recent (Fig. 29: provisional data only). Geophysical prospection of six EBA and Second Palace sites within the survey area was undertaken early in 2002 by a team led by Boyd (BSA); the results are currently under- going analysis. In addition, the pottery excavated in 2000 as a synergasia between the 2nd EPCA and Kythera Island Project, coming from damaged rock-cuttings at Tholos (an inland extension of Kastri), was studied in April 2001 by Kiriatzi and Knappett (Cambridge), assisted by Kappa, whilst Bevan completed analysis of the excavation records. The in situ pottery (a mini- mum of 259 vessels) is now firmly dated to LM IA and LM IB. The bulk of the evidence strongly argues that the contexts were funerary, thereby advancing knowledge of the distribution of Second Palace tombs around the Kastri settlement. The final publication of this excavation and its material is in press with the Annual of the British School at Athens (vol. 97).' Paliochora. Stavros A. Paspalas (Australian Institute) and Timothy Gregory (Ohio State University) report: 'A short field season of four weeks duration was undertaken in 2001 by the Australian Paliochora Kythera Archaeological Survey, a project conducted under the auspices of the Australian Institute. This was the third season in the series. With the view of fulfilling the primary aim of the project, the analysis of the settlement history of N Kythera in all periods, the team mem- bers conducted a number of surface investigations in areas within the wider region of the Med settlement of Agios Demetrios/Paliochora. A major part of the fieldwork carried out in 2001 was focused on collecting material that pertained to the individual history of a number of churches, and the evidence of settlement and/or building in their immediate surroundings, which mark a range of hillocks (Agia Marina, Agios Ioannes, Prophetes Elias, Agios Onouphrios and Agios Menas) in the wider vicinity of Paliochora. Most of the material noted in the areas surveyed is Med and later, though ancient ceramics were documented at Agios Ioannis, and R pottery was located at Prophetes Elias and Agios Stephanos. The area around the church known as Agios Georgios Kolokythias, N of Agia Pelagia, preserves the remains of buildings which testify to a complex -". different in nature from those located at the other areas examined in the 2001 season. It is marked by + its still standing church (which was clearly larger in an earlier phase[s]), the remains of at least one other _ church, a double cistern, further buildings (domes- tic/administrative?), and a fortification enceinte. It should be noted that the site overlooks the sea pas- sage between N Kythera and the Peloponnese, and a small bay at its foot may have been used as a har- N bour. The earliest pottery noted here dates to the LR period. Finally, the area known as 'Trochiles', which is characterized by the fertile nature of its surroundings, was also surveyed. The inherent advantages of this L productive area were highlighted by the fact that the surface pottery clearly indicates occupation during many periods, including MM, C, HL and R periods. In co-operation with the local representative of n the 1st EBA, Marina Papademetriou, members of the s+ APKAS team documented a number of graves, and cleared the exposed bones, by the church of Agios + Athanasios, N of the village of Kastrisianika, which had been disturbed by bulldozing.

The 1996 season (ADelt 96-97) was covered in AR 1996-97, 17-18. Guy Sanders reports on the ASCS excavations at Anc. Corinth in 2001: 'Excavations in the Panayia Field, SE of the Forum at Corinth, since 1995 have uncovered the 4th-Ct remains of a R town house with mosaics, wall painting and small-scale sculp- ture (Fig. 30), LR buildings including a small bath structure (Fig. 31), fragmentary remains of Byz occupation and several early to mid-19th century houses (Fig. 32 ). In the summer of 2001 the area excavated was extended to the N and W in an attempt to define the limits of the MR house. More of the road on the E side of the house was exposed and within the house several of the earth floors were removed to reveal earlier phas- es of the site. Finally, part of what was thought to be part of the early modern Panayia cemetery but which proved to be 17th-Ct was excavated (Figs. 33-34). Removal of the floors of the MR house in rooms 11, 13, 14 and 16 revealed earlier structures (Fig. 35). When the MR house was constructed the entire area was terraced and levelled, destroying all but the foundations of walls and pockets of mate- rial in the W and trimming down deposits to above the floors in the E. On the W side were illegible scraps of walling loosely associated with a LA to EC secondary deposit which contained miniature vessels and small figurines. The top of what appears to be an ER basement with plastered walls was uncovered.

Corinth, Panayia Field: Byzantine and later structures covering a cavity that may well prove to be a grave. Three substantially complete MG oenochoai found in adjacent LR disturbances in the immediate area suggest the presence of G graves of which this may be one. To the E the lower reaches of a small built cistern, faced with plaster, were found to contain a deposit of late 4th to very early 3rd-Ct pottery. Farther still to the E, running into the baulk under the road, are the floors and foundations of a small structure probably built in the 2nd half of the 1St Ct BC which went out of use in the mid-1st Ct AD. Under the floor of this structure the complete skele- ton of a tortoise was found with a lamp dating to the reign of Augustus and a coin of ca 44-40 BC. Over the structure were parts of a water tank abutting the road wall filled with pottery of the 2nd Ct AD and an adjacent well filled more or less at the same time. The overlying strata indicate that the MR house did not extend all the way up to the road and that this space was essentially abandoned in the 4th Ct until the walls were robbed out and the area became a dumping ground for material excavated during the construction of the 6th-Ct long building. The MR house has now been exposed over an extent in excess of 1,000m2. The majority of the walls were robbed out when new construction cov- ered the area in the 5th and 6th Cts, but the floors are generally well preserved. Excavations on the E side have revealed a further 1 Om of the road frontage but the extension of a probe on the W side of the field failed to locate the western limits of the building. On the N side a very large E-W tank, lined with water- proof cement on the interior and with interior dimensions of 16.2 x 2.1m, was found to the N of room 11. The pool, with the Euripus in room 10, the octagonal fountain in room 8 and the square fountain pool in room 2, is the feature which gives a sense of E-W and N-S axiality to the house. A deep probe immediately to the N of the pool revealed that there were no significant walls or floors, suggesting that the area beyond the pool was laid out as a garden. A lead pipe, partially robbed out in the 6th Ct, was found under the floor of room 11. This line originat- ed S of the peristyle (room 10), curving to a point on the S side of room 11 before dividing to serve the octagonal fountain in room 8 to the S and continu- ing towards the SW comer of the large rectangular pool where presumably it fed some kind of fountain head. The packing of the pipe line contained coins dating to the last years of the 2nd Ct. These coins and the fill of two wells which went out of use before the construction of the house indicate that the house was built at least some, and perhaps many, decades after the beginning of the 3rd Ct. Coins in the destruction horizon date the end of the building's use to after ca 360. To the N of the exposed portion of the MR house and the 6th-Ct bath, work on an area of about 550m2 continued with the eventual intention of defining and exposing contemporary and earlier structures. Further exposure of this area required the removal of graves which were thought to be part of the Panayia Cemetery used into the early 20th Ct and known to exist immediately to the NW. Special per- mission was sought from the Deme of Corinth to excavate these graves and re-inter the post-Greek</page><page sequence="19">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 2001-2002 19 War of Independence remains in one of the current facilities. Study of the contexts and their contents showed that if the graves do belong to the Panayia Cemetery they were part of an early phase. Some were cut by early l9th-Ct house walls, presumably when the graves were long forgotten, and after cleaning the few coins found were dated to the 17th Ct. A reasonable chronological span for the inter- ments is the end of the first Ottomanokrateia, ca 1600 to ca 1670. A total of 59 graves with remains representing 89 individuals were excavated. The majority were Christian burials, generally oriented N of E, with hands placed on the abdomen; many had stones propping up their heads and some had stones covering the face. A small minority on the S edges belonged to Moslems. These were oriented NE with head facing right towards the SE and with hands placed by the side of the torso. If it is under- stood that many of the shallow graves of infants and children are likely to have been destroyed by early mod. and mod. ploughing, then the 25% of the graves of this age group appears to be normal (one may expect a figure of about 40% in less disturbed circumstances). The preponderance of males over females in a ratio of about 2.5: 1, however, is unusu- al and remains to be explained. One very disturbed grave contained the remains of a male who died in his early 20s buried face down. A large iron hook found curving under the left clavicle was partially responsible for death. It appears that the individual was spiked and suspended until dead, then buried in a position which denied his witnessing the second coming. Removal of the last early mod. walls in this N part of the site in the area of the cemetery was com- pleted. A large garbage pit partially excavated in 2000 was found to have been cut by one of the field walls and to have cut some of the graves. The wall in question appears on a plan of the village made soon after the accession of King Otto, thus provid- ing a terminus ante quem for its contents of ca 1828. Coins within the pit, the latest two of which date to 1786, the 13th regnal year of Sultan Abdul Hameid, give a terminus post quem of 1796 +/- 10. The deposit adds to the range of previously undated material from the Panayia site; this also includes contexts dating soon after the Greek War of Independence (ca 1830) and deposits which imme- diately predate the earthquake of 1858. Continuing the work of 2000, a short period was spent in remote sensing survey of the area S and W of the Asklepieion (Fig. 36). This confirmed the poor quality of the data obtainable here. Interpretation of the new material and further inter- pretation of the 2000 data showed that the initial identification of faint anomalies as the seating and sphendone of a circus were illusory and hasty. In fact there is nothing in the results to either support or deny the identification of a feature found in the University of Texas Excavations near the Gymnasium (Hesperia 38 [1969] 64-106) as a meta of the spina of a Circus. The LR city wall thought to transect the area cannot be identified among the 33. &amp; 34. Corinth, Panayia Field: 17th/18th Ct cemetery 35.

Corinth: survey of Asklepieion area anomalies (Hesperia 48 [1979] 264-280). To the W of the amphitheatre results were much more positive. Prospection work began to the W of the last visible surface traces of the wall and continued northwards. A large structure identified close to the edge of the mod. road along the edge of the terrace appears to be the end of the wall where it traverses the plateau in a NW direction (contra Hesperia 48 [1979]). In the prospected area were traces of many linear features, probably houses, and a large anomaly, represented by very high readings, probably rep- resents part of a LR bath. The clearest patterns, however, were of a massive circular or octagonal building, 12m in diameter, immediately adjacent to a square building measuring 20 x 20m. This seems to be a structure identified by D. I. Pallas from the few standing remains as a basilica (Reallexicon zur Byzantinischen Kunst 4, s.v. Korinth [1990]), but the patterns presented by our data are more suggestive of a martyrium. The return of the artefacts stolen from Corinth Museum in April 1990 and other pressing conservation projects did not per- mit the completion of cleaning and stabilizing the North Market mosaics by the end of August 2001. Less than 5% of the work remains and it is hoped to finish the work by the Spring of 2002.' Eastern Korinthia Archaeological Survey. Timothy E. Gregory and Daniel J. Pullen (ASCS) report on the third season of survey and study in 2001: 'The project carried out one week of archaeological survey, in July 2001. Before that, it carried out environmental study and the organization and examination of material from the two pre- vious seasons. Our 2001 permit restricted research to two small areas: SW of Isthmia (0.5km2) and the vicinity of Agia Paraskeve, between Xylokeriza and Kenchries (0.04km2). We were easily able to cover these areas in the week we had at our disposal, and we were also able to fill in some of the area between Rachi Boska and Kromna in the central part of the sur- vey region. In all we covered 0.816 km2 in 357 survey units. SW of Isthmia we found a significant site of Myc, a thick spread of C and R artifacts, a large World-War II military installation, and the all-but-certain course of the anc. road between Isthmia and Kenchreai. At Agia Paraskeve we found evidence of continuous habitation, from at least the C period until the last century.' Isthmia. Prof. Elizabeth R. Gebhard (ASCS) reports on the University of Chicago Excavations' 2001 season of study and conservation: 'Site conservation: cleaning and conservation was carried out in the following areas: Northeast Cave. \ To prevent rainwater from entering through the ceil- i ing, the exterior surface of the bedrock over the cave was covered with clay and then with a thin layer of / l cement. At the edge of the rock retaining walls were positioned to divert run-off from the courtyard and entrances to the cave below. Further study of the problems surrounding conservation of the cave will be carried out next year. East Temenos. Additional soil was added to the fill already in place in order to level the terrace N of the 'Roman altar'. Great Circular Pit. A mortared retaining wall to prevent - erosion was built at the W and NW sides of the area - around the pit, where the adjacent schoolyard lies at a higher level. SW Temenos. Existing retaining walls were repaired along the sides of the school- yard. The West Waterworks, which had been cov- ered with sand in 2000, were outlined on the surface to show visitors the shape and location of the mon- ument. In the Isthmia Museum the area outside the W wall of the apotheke was cleared and a drainage pipe was laid to pre- vent collection of water and leakage into the interior. Leaks in the apotheke windows were repaired, and the window frames were cleaned and repaired. Palaimonion. Fritz Hemans designed a roof that will cover each end of the tunnel leading into the base of the temple in order to prevent further damage to the clay sides and the roof of the passage. Studies for publications in the Isthmia series: Arms and armour (Alastar Jackson): study continued on the body armor and weapons. It was noted that, while dedications of armour began in the late 8th Ct, they reached their apex in the 6th Ct, exhibiting a sharp rise in the 2nd half of that century. Archaic temple of Poseidon (Fritz Hemans): new observa- tions on the roof tiles suggest the use of a template in their man- ufacture (following C. LeRoy in Fouilles de Delphes). It was observed that marks on the tiles seem to be associated with a process of fitting that could only have been done in situ and before the tiles were fired. The tiles appear to have been designed according to a foot of 0.326 m. At the level of the eaves, four tiles occupied each intercolumniation and were carefully aligned with the columns below. LA and EC pottery (Martha Risser): inventoried and context pottery (including stamped amphora handles) was brought up to date, and 516 items were prepared for the catalogue. A prelimi- nary survey of the ceramics in the database showed that during the 6th Ct BC the number of kotylai increased, and in the 2nd half of the century there was a shift from aryballoi to lekythoi, a shape that Corinth adopted from Athens. Miniature vessels very likely made for dedication became more common during the same century, and their popularity markedly rose during the second half. These trends could be, but need not certainly be, associated with the period when the Isthmian Games acquired panhellenic status (cf the arms and armor). HL and R pottery(John Hayes): checking and additional drawings were done in the museum. Several sections of the vol- ume were submitted to the editor in draft form. Coins (Liane Houghtalin): the entire collection of coins was checked for completeness of inventory and condition of preser- vation. Recent cleaning made it possible to improve some iden- tifications and descriptions, especially in the case of Frankish examples that bear secret mintmarks, and others that were revealed to be counterfeits of their day.

GPS reading on the Archaic temple (Erin Nell): for a com- parative study of Greek and Egyptian temples in regard to their cardinal, stellar and solar orientation, readings with a Global Positioning Survey unit were taken in twelve areas of the tem- ple on two successive days.' Prof. Timothy E. Gregory (ASCS) reports on the Ohio State University Excavations' 2001 season: 'A program of study and conservation was carried out, with a primary focus on the R bath, but with significant concerns elsewhere in the site. Joseph Rife (Corell University) complet- ed gathering materials for publication of his book-length study of the LR and Byz human burials at Isthmia. Jane Reinhard (Carthage College) completed her study of the interior decora- tion of the R bath, while Julie Apley (Ohio State University) fin- ished her computerized 3-dimensional reconstruction of the R bath. Fikret Yegiil (University of California at Santa Barbara) and Timothy E. Gregory (Ohio State University) continued their study and writing toward the full publication of this important monument. Other work in the R bath consisted of conservation, most importantly the resumption of conservation on the great monochrome mosaic in room VI.' The 1996 season (ADelt 97-98) was covered in AR 1996-97, 21-2. Loutraki. At the site of Katounistra, the remains were located of a large building, probably a bath-house, including a room with apsidal niches in the comers, clay drains, and part of a bath with a hypocaust, all dating from the LR period. (ADelt 94-5) Nemea. The 1996 season (ADelt 96) was covered in AR 1996-97, 22. Stephen G. Miller (ASCS) reports on the 2001 excavations and other work: 'Excavations. A small probe carried out in the crypt of the 4th-Ct temple of Zeus showed conclusively that a wall, long vis- ible at the bottom of the crypt, is not from the east temple, but is a part of the 4th-Ct building. W of the temple of Zeus the banks of the Byz phase of the Nemea River were dug out and more than a dozen pieces of the temple were recovered. The elongated artificial tumulus/ridge of the infant hero Opheltes was pursued for more than 100m to the N without finding a definite end; a total length of about 130m can be esti- mated. The 6th-Ct mound once again revealed clear indications of ritual drinking with whole vessels and even sets of vessels carefully interred. In the trench at the N end of the mound (as far as we uncov- ered it) was revealed a N-S curbing wall which seems to be the limit between the mound on the W and the early stadium track on the E. This is welcome confirmation for our theoretical location of that early track, which was subsequently so damaged and destroyed by the later river cutting through it. Several trenches were excavated along the W side of the mound in an attempt to locate the hippodrome, that most fugi- tive of all Nemean features. We found clear traces of chariot tracks in several locations and at several different levels. Thus, chariots and horses were certainly known in this area. Unfortunately, we also discovered that the whole area W of the mound was a flood plain with dozens of layers of sand and light gravel accumulating over the centuries, so no continuous flat layer survived that might have preserved wheel ruts over an 37. Nemea: track for athletes extensive horizontal surface. It may also be noted that the long, relatively narrow mound of Opheltes served as a kind of levee to keep the flood waters away from the temple. The situation was complicated by the unexpected discovery of yet another starting line with grooves, like that of the EHL stadium, for human toes (Fig. 37). Although the line is only two blocks long with space for only two runners, it is clear that no other starting blocks adjoined these. It seems that we have a practice track for athletes preparing for the games in the 4thCt. Further to the W the reservoir discovered last year was com- pletely excavated. The discoveries in the three chambers includ- ed drinking vessels, jugs, and amphoras, which appear to have been accidentally dropped into the reservoir by thirsty ancients. Two discoveries are of particular importance. One of these is a bronze Macedonian helmet, which is now in the conservation department of the National Museum in Athens. The second is a lovely bronze ladle with its curved handle ending in a duck's head (Fig. 38). This piece is paralleled by one discovered in Macedonia several years ago (See Themelis and Touratsoglou, Ot Tc(pot tou Aeppevio)u, B26). The two ladles are so similar in design, workmanship, and size that they appear to have been made in the same workshop, perhaps by the same artisan. The completion of the excavation of the reservoir showed three compartments of almost identical size: 2.20 x 2.80m and nearly 8m deep (Fig. 39). The total capacity was over 140m3 although it is doubtful that they were ever completely full. Indeed, the carefully worked and set blocks of the walls show no traces of plaster lining. Our experience shows that the reservoir can work as a well, tapping the water table when it is suf- ficiently high. On the other hand, the channel that brought water to the reser- voir from the bath shows that it must have been necessary to augment the water supply during times of drought when the water table was low. The purpose for which the reservoir was intended is unknown. Obviously a large and reliable supply of water was wanted, but for what? Given the other indications in this part of the site, one's thoughts turn to horses and the desire I to assure the owners of these expen- I sive animals that their participation in the Nemean Games would not involve a lack of water for them.

Nemea: reservoir vessels of an appropriate size to water horses, but no horse trap- pings were found. It appears that, at least for the moment, the purpose of the reservoir for supplying the horses competing in the games must remain an attractive but unproven theory. Temple reconstruction: another major part of the Nemea proj- ect has become the reconstruction of the temple of Zeus. One and one-half columns have been re-erected so far. The process includes carving new stone to match the broken surface of miss- ing stone, and then carving the surface of that new stone to match the flutes of the extant ancient stone. Perhaps the greatest satisfaction has come with the training by Mr Ioannis Arbilias of six local men who are showing themselves to be able and, as their experience grows, among the best in Greece at such work. By the end of 2001 we hope to see these two columns finished and the architrave tying them together at the top. River Embankment: the removal of the blocks of the temple of Zeus from the embankments of the river (above) necessitat- ed the construction of two massive walls to keep the river out of the site, and to reinforce the bridge W of the temple. Bath exhibition: the process of converting the ancient bath to a fully-fledged exhibition area went forward with the finishing touches on rain gutters around the edge of the roof, construction of two retaining walls, back-filling to the ancient floor level, and painting. This is fast becoming a favorite attraction at Nemea and next year will see the addition of park benches and two remaining explanatory plaques.' Stymphalos. Hector Williams (Canadian Institute) reports on the 2001 season: 'Excavations and study at anc. Stymphalos continued in June-July 2001. Work continued in a number of areas previ- ously excavated as well as in several new ones (Fig. 40). Our major area of investigation was the SE area of the site where we have been digging since 1994. Here we focused in particular on the early 1St-Ct AD house that had been inserted in the aban- doned remains of a LC/HL house. Of particular significance was the discovery of large quantities of well-preserved painted plaster moulded into ashlar blocks in two rooms; it had fallen in large sheets from walls in an earthquake around AD 40 (evi- dence from pottery and especially coins of Gaius). We also uncovered the remains of a large wooden door with 26 bronze bosses of four different types that decorated it. Best parallels for both plaster and bosses seem to be mid-2nd Ct BC in date. We also carried out limited sondages into earlier levels of previous- ly excavated rooms; especially interesting was a large oval stone-lined pit that contained considerable quantities of animal bones, especially heads. We began to excavate the intersection of a N-S street W of the 'plaster room' with an E-W avenue, but problems with irrigation channels delayed completion. Similar problems with water levels only allowed us to dig about a metre and a half into a well in the courtyard of the R house. About 100m S of the above area and near the S city wall we opened up a 10x5m trench to investigate unusual parch marks. The site, at the end of a city block, proved to have a semicircu- lar trough lined with tiles about half a metre wide and deep that seems to run the entire 30m width of the block with a drain at its W end into the street. No immediate purpose could be deter- mined, but it may have provided a source of washing water for a gymnasium. Our second major area lay about 100m to the W, where last year we had found the stage building of the theatre area; this year we uncovered more of the facade of the proskenion (Figs. 41-42) with blocks inscribed with letters, and tried to investigate the lowest levels of seats, but there were none surviving in an area across the front of the orchestra, where there was a thick, appar- ently LR-EByz wall of unknown purpose running E-W; the wall included re-used C and HL architectural material such as part of a large Doric capital. We also excavated more of the poorly preserved HL structure on the flat terrace just behind the top of the rock-cut seats of the theatre and uncovered two puppy burials under the floor; we found no evidence of the building's purpose, however. Of particular interest was a small quantity of LMyc pottery scattered through later fills. The site was used for burials in the early ECh period, one of the several ECh small cemeteries we have found around the site. Just W of the late wall at the base of the theatre area we uncovered a large exedral area with what seem to be remains of several courses of curving seating, suggesting a structure like a small bouleuterion in the area (about 10m across).</page><page sequence="23">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 2001-2002 23 About 100m further W we excavated much of a room that backed up on the vertical scarp of bedrock left in the area; built of large regular blocks as well as smaller ones, it contained a large anepigraphic stele with bulbous base that had broken in antiquity and been mended with iron clamps set in lead. The room faced onto a major E-W road leading to the theatre and may have been part of a series of shops. A further 100m or so W we carried out extensive cleaning in an area originally cleared, although never published, 70 years ago by Anastasios Orlandos. The structures examined included a tholos-like building that may have been an hero6n, a LC spring house that we hoped to begin to restore, the propylon to what Orlandos suggested might have been a palaestra, and the 'Pheneos gate' of the city (Pheneos is the next city to the W). The structure was of particular interest as we were able to relo- cate and plan the actual entrance with its twin benches and colonnade, unique among Gr gates known to the team; it seems to have been carefully taken apart and reburied after Orlando's excavations, possibly during WWII. Deep cleaning in the tho- los uncovered no material earlier than mid-4th Ct BC; several terracotta votive figurines suggest a religious purpose. We also found traces of white plaster, inside and out, as well as two small fragments of an inscription of unknown purpose but LHL or ER to judge from letter styles. Up on the acropolis we opened a new area on a terrace more or less in its center and on the N side. Although there were extensive shallow traces of walls on the surface, most of which seem to have been HL, there were also ECh graves (poorly pre- served) and even some MByz pottery. Perhaps the most signif- icant find was a 'celt', a lithic utensil identical in material and form to EH II examples in Corinth. Work also continued in the large artillery towers on the highest point of the acropolis and in the middle of the W city wall, to finish excavating several ECh graves exposed last year. Our human remains team also cleaned and studied the material from earlier seasons that we had not finished last year. In conjunction with the new demos of Stymphalia we organ- ized a trail around the site to make the anc. city more visitable by the interested tourist. Numbered points of importance are keyed to a guide available to visitors in the village. We decided not to put up information plaques because of the vandalism done to several erected last winter by the Forestry Service.' [We apologize for the omission of the report of the 2000 season in AR 2000/1] ARGOLIS Argos. There were three rescue excavations reported in 1996 from the mod. city of Argos, two of which involved sites used over long periods of time, both for burials and for domestic activities. In Odos Perrouka, to the NE of the mod. market square of Argos, and in the S part of the A. Manou plot, part of a HL road, running E-W, was located and investigated for a length of 12.50m (w. 4m), with a stone retaining wall on the N. In the NE section of the plot was recorded a stone well of the A period, and three LHL/ER tombs, tile-roofed ellipsoidal or rectangular graves, containing single extended burials in which, judging by the number of iron nails deposited, the corpses had been origi- nally placed in wooden coffins. The same area was apparently also used as a cemetery during the PG and G periods, judging by the discovery of seven graves, of various types (4 cists, 2 pithos burials, 1 pot-burial), the orientation of which suggests that they were originally lying to the N of a road, later covered by the HL road. (ADelt 87-8) 41. &amp; 42. Stymphalos, theatre: stage building In Odos Erakleous a section of a HL road was recorded, running NW-SE along the E side of the plot, and lined with stone retaining walls; to the W of the road were found six buri- als, mostly cists, of the G and the HL periods. (ADelt 88-90) Finally, in Odos Ag. Konstantinou, were discovered the remains of LR/EByz houses and of a tile-roofed tomb. (ADelt 90) In the area between Argos and Mycenae cleaning operations were conducted in two monuments: the so called 'pyramid' of Ellenikon, 2km SW of Kephalari Argous, with sloping exterior walls, which comprised the ground floor of a probably three-floor tower, of the end of the 4th Ct BC, with a mud-brick superstruc- ture; and the 'pyramid' E of Argos, at the site of Dalamanara, mentioned by Pausanias, and decorated with shields in relief. The tower of Lemikon, at Phychtia, is square, probably had many floors, with a mud-brick superstructure, and is dated to the end of the 4th Ct BC. (ADelt 95) MH settlement on the Aspis. A. Philippa-Touchais and G. Touchais (French School) report on activities in 2001: 'Pottery study. The cataloguing of the matt-painted pottery from the SE sector of the excavation was completed (over 1500 sherds and 15 vases have a complete profile). The completion of this study broadens our knowledge of the whole of the paint- ed pottery of the settlement, since, in comparison with the N sector, the SE sector, which was intensely occupied until the MH IIIB-LH IA period, offers richer ceramic material, with a fuller and clearer stratigraphic sequence.

Dekavallas (University of Paris I) completed the first phase of the new pro- gramme for study of the MH pottery, having done a chromato- graphic analysis to ascertain the contents and therefore also the use of the pottery.

Argos, Middle Helladic settlement: walls On completion of the chemical analyses at the NCSR 'Democritus' (see report for 2000, BCH 125 [2001], forthcoming), the selected sherds went to the Fitch Laboratory of the BSA, for petrographic analyses under the direction of Evangelia Kyriatzi. Some preliminary observations, particularly in regard to the lustrous decorated pottery, have already been reported to the 9th Cretological Congress (October 2001). According to these observations, apparently confirmed by the chemical analyses, this pottery constitutes a single group with the same fabric, characterized by the addition of sand (mudstone and quartz) to the clay, and executed in the M tradition (characteristic of the EM and MM periods). This does not necessarily mean that the vases came from Crete, since this fabric is quite widespread in Kythera, as well as at other sites in the SE Peloponnese where the Cretan influence was especially strong. Moreover, given that fabrics 'travel' and that mudstone and quartz rocks are not rare, and so not typical of one particular region, it is quite pos- sible that these vases were produced even in the Argolid. Study ?r the human bone material. Osteoarchaeologist S. Triantafillou conducted the study of the bone material: a total of 12 skeletons from an equal number of tombs located within the settlement. These skeletons belong not only to infants and chil- dren but also to adults, men and mainly women. The prelimi- nary report on the study will be included in the report for 2002. Excavation. In the SE excavation sector cleaning and main- tenance work was carried out as well as the excavation of a baulk (3 x lm) which had partially collapsed in 1999, directly N of the apsidal house (squares BE-BF/39-40, Fig. 43). During the limited excavation which was conducted by A. Philippa-Touchais, the continuation of two walls, 568 (NW-SE) and 447 (NE-SW), was uncovered. These two walls meet perpendicularly (Fig. 44, from the W) without being phys- ically connected, as they do not belong to the same chronolog- ical level. Wall 568 is quite solid and is preserved to a height of three courses (0.55m). It appears to have been used in two phas- es, the f1rst contemporary with the apsidal house (MH IIIA), whereas the second phase is contemporary with the orthogonal complex (MH IIIB-LH IA). Its W end is lost beneath the unex- cavated section of the hill, whilst its E end is interrupted by a deep pit of the HL period, with the result that we do not know if it continued farther E as far as wall 449, with which it is con- temporary and runs in the same direction. If this wall did con- tinue, then it would have passed under wall 419 of the rectan- gular complex, which has also been destroyed at this point by the HL intrusion. If wall 568 was indeed that long, and given that no other wall parallel to it has been found further NE delin- eating a particular area, then we may advance the hypothesis that it was a peribolos wall, the purpose of which was to protect the apsidal house. The small wall 447 was built during the phase of the rectan- gular complex and can be distinguished by its rough construc- tion. Its SW end rests upon the apse of the apsidal house, which was obviously no longer in use, whilst its NE end lies adjacent to wall 568. It is clear that wall 568 was still visible since not only was it re-used from quite a low level, near its base, but it was repaired in quite a rough way. On their W side, these two walls, along with the E wall (481) of the house which lies to the W, form a small rectangular area (Fig. 45), which was probably open to the S. The finds from here do not help in determining the use of this area, which must have been an auxiliary area. At least three graves had previously been excavat-ed at this point (see BCH 112 [1978] 801), belonging to an adult and a small child beneath the fragments of the same pithos, and an infant.

Argos, apsidal house Beneath wall 568, on the N side where its foundations were not built upon the rock, the earlier occupation level of the hill (MH I-II), known almost exclusively from pottery fragments, was identified (Fig. 46). The composition of this level (red clayey earth with numerous small stones and many sherds, pre- dominantly M, with grooves on the shoulder and Lustrous Decorated) indicates that this is a fill made in order to flatten the area in preparation for the construction of wall 568.' 47. Asine, Kastraki: fortifications Asine. Kastraki. Investigations along the N side of the anc. for- tifications of Asine, especially after the collapse of a 20th-Ct AD section of walling, revealed that the N exterior face of the anc. wall was preserved to a height of 12 courses (h. 4.20m, th. 3m; Fig. 47), while the undisturbed deposits on the inside included pottery from the MH to the A periods. Judging by the pottery, it seems that the poros wall, which formed here a rectangular tower, was constructed during the C era (end of 5th Ct BC-1st half of the 4th Ct BC), and not during the R period, as was main- tained by the Swedish Mission. The fortification circuit was completely rebuilt in grey limestone during the HL period, clearly incorporating the older walls, except for the N poros section of the wall investigated this year. The W section of the circuit has been eroded by the sea, and is in need of protection. Along the N side of the excavated anc. site were unearthed parts of foundations of houses, in close proximity, dating from the MH and the Myc periods, during which Asine seems to have been densely populated. Parts of eight different buildings were recorded, including a section of an ochre-yellow beaten earth (plesia) floor, and a Myc child's pot-burial connected with a particular building. Around the household pots were found remains of a funeral meal (animal bones, sea shells). Along the W side of the fortifications, close to the sea, was located the lower semi-circular E part of a lime-kiln, with traces of another one to its NW. (ADelt 90-2) Halieis.

Banks' work on the Lera IV text continues, and in the past year she coordinated the lithics entries in the text with the revised study on the Lerna BA lithics by B. Hartenberger and C. Runnels (see below). Corrections on the plans were made in anticipation of a working session in Athens with Roxana Docsan, which resulted in a digitized version of the individual and phase plans and sections. Present work is on summary statements and conclusions with a target date for a reasonably complete text by the end of 2001. Curtis Runnels' article 'The Bronze Age Flaked Stone Industries from Lera written together with Britt Hartenberger, is scheduled to appear in Hesperia this year. In July 2001, K.D. Vitelli completed the text of the volume on the Neolithic pottery from Lera I and II. After review she aims to submit the entire manuscript before the end of the cal- endar year 2001. Carol Zerer has continued to edit the text of Lera V. She has completed the account of the stratigraphy and the pottery catalogue of area D, the best preserved sequence of the MH period. The finalization of the system of classification of all the MH pottery from the site has been advanced by the work she has been doing on the article on the ceramics of Lera V in col- laboration with R. Jones and I. Whitbread. The results of their chemical and petrographic analyses are to be included, together with the typology of the many wares. We have frequent requests from scholars to examine Lerna material in Argos. Michael Lindblom's excellent study Marks and Makers (Jonsered 2001) on the Aeginetan potters' marks, makes much use of Lera material.

Midea, acropolis This fall, Jeff Kramer (University of Cincinnati) is working on shaft grave material, for his investigation into the 'dramatic decline in the fine wares of the Middle Helladic tradition' and the rapid increase in Myc decorated pottery. Dr Robert Arott and Dr John Prag (University of Birmingham and University of Manchester), with Lisa Little (ASCSA and Indiana University) and Terry and Keri Brown (University of Manchester) are to examine teeth of the MH population, partly in order to re-exam- ine Angel's clan theories, and also in support of their wider study in epigenetic variation and ancient DNA, for which they have examined skeletal material from Grave Circle A at Mycenae.' Leukakia. To the W of the Ypapante church, part of an anc. retaining wall was identified, designed to create a platform for the erection of a large LA temple, the foundations of which lie to the E. The temple should be probably identified with that of Pythios Apollon of anc. Asine, as testified by Pausanias, which has until now been wrongly identified with the remains on the top of the Barbouna hill. (ADelt 92) Midea. The Greek-Swedish excavations on the Myc Acropolis of Midea continued in 2001 under the direction of Dr Katie Demakopoulou with the collaboration of Dr Ann-Louise Schallin (representative of the Swedish Institute) and Nicoletta Divari-Valakou. Dr Demakopoulou reports: 'The excavations were conducted in three sectors: in the W gate area and on the SW slope (Greek sector) and in the E part of the acropolis (Swedish sector). Investigation continued in the N wing of the building com- plex, which has been brought to light by the W gate. Room XI, excavated last year, was completely uncovered; part of a new room was found to the N. Fragments of frescoes recovered from the rooms indicate that the walls were originally covered with painted plaster. The fragmentary pottery found is dated to LH IIIB2. Other finds include terracotta roof-tiles, stone and bone tools and spindle-whorls of steatite. A new trench situated on a lower terrace 15m W of the build- ing complex was excavated. Pure Myc deposits with piles of stones and blocks fallen from destroyed buildings and from the fortification wall were removed. Parts of walls were uncovered under the fallen stones in the NE part of the trench. Abundant pottery of LH IIIB2 was found, including many typical shapes of this phase, such as deep bowls, kraters, mugs, jugs and stir- rup jars. Fragments of storage and cooking vessels were also recovered. Among noteworthy finds are a crushed lead vessel, terracotta roof-tiles, fragments of plaster, human and animal clay figurines, stone tools, pinkish ochre, pieces of mother-of- pearl and remains of foodstuff. The excavation continued on an extensive plateau on the SW slope, 43m N of the W gate, where some ruined walls had been uncovered (AR 2000-01, 29). The structural remains found this year consist of three rooms (Fig. 48) and a long retaining wall, badly preserved. Part of the road uncovered in 2000 was also found. The rooms and the road were afflicted by widespread fire destruction, caused by the earthquake that struck Midea around the end of the 13th Ct BC resulting in the collapse of many buildings and parts of the fortification wall. The pottery dates the destruction to the final phase of LH IIIB2. A large number of fragmentary vases and sherds, typical of this phase, were found, such as deep bowls of group A and B, stemmed bowls (Fig. 49), rosette bowls, kraters, stirrup jars, jugs, miniature handmade vases, plain kylikes and angular bowls, as well as storage and cooking coarse-ware vessels, including a large frag- ment of a spit-holder. Other finds include clay human and ani- mal figurines, seal-stones, steatite spindle-whorls, glass beads, unworked pieces of semi-precious stones, such as agate, cor- nelian, rock crystal and fluorite, arrowheads of bronze, obsidi- an and flint, millstones and stone tools, fragments of plaster, pieces of mother-of-pearl and yellow ochre; remains of food- stuff were also found. The most remarkable find of the 2001 season is a clay pris- matic nodule (Fig. 50) from the area of the retaining wall SE of the rooms. It is very well preserved with a vertical perforation, a seal impression of a bull in flying gallop with an attacking ani- mal above its back, and a Linear B inscription of three words, recording a commodity or an artifact given to the Megaron by a person called Aisonios. This nodule with its significant inscrip- tion confirms the position of Midea as a palatial centre in the Argolid.' 50. Midea, acropolis: clay nodule with Linear B inscription _ w x _ p,</page><page sequence="27">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 2001-2002 27 Dr Schallin reports on work in the Swedish sector in 2001: 'The Swedish team continued field activities on the E side of Midea. Excavations were carried out in trench 1 on one of the middle terraces, inside and outside the E gate (trenches 4 and 5), and in trench 3, situated on a higher level E of the E gate. The excavation in trench 1 revealed a stratum which contin- ued all the way down to the bedrock. It is a layer with a com- pact, clay soil mixed with a tumble of large stones. The nature of the tumble and the mixed sherds of various dates found with- in it may suggest that the bedrock depression was filled in and leveled in one action, perhaps for agricultural purposes. Judging from the latest dates of the sherds, this must have occurred dur- ing post-R or post-Byz times. The E gate has been the focus for investigations previously but due to the complexity of the construction there are still many unanswered questions. A ramp or a similar construction must have existed once outside the entrance, but all traces of it have eroded away, perhaps with the exception of two worn stones under the threshold (in situ) and a cut block (not in situ) found in the center of the trench. In the section of the gate pass- ing through the citadel wall itself, the Myc floor level was encountered; the floor was very hard and compact. Work was also done E of the E gate, at a level where previous excavations revealed a series of rooms along the interior face of the fortification wall. Further evidence of such rooms was found, as well as an earlier construction, the date of which still needs clarification (Fig. 51, showing two Myc construction phases).' Nauplion. During excavations in the Parko Staikopoulou, on the inner, W side of the Venetian fortifications, pavements were recorded with a pebble surface, probably belonging to the last period of use of the road and the Land Gate in the 19th Ct AD, while 15m to the W lay the W apsidal fagade of the gate; imme- diately to the S was found a stone paved floor, the lowest part of a built fountain, and two aqueducts providing the fountain with fresh water. To the S of the Land gate was uncovered part of the old gate of the Venetian walls, depicted in the unique etching of Karl von Heideck. It seems that the S internal apsi- dal entrance of the old gate communicated with the gate itself through a small postern, and not directly. In the same area was also located the older phase of a LByz road, which pre-dated the Venetian walls. At the junction of Odos 25 Martiou and Odos Polyzoidou was discovered a built apsidal underground defensive construc- tion, probably a secret passage running N-S, part of the Venetian fortifications in the second Venetian occupation, locat- ed outside the actual walls and along the E sea moat. A similar passage has been located on the S side of the same moat, N of the Grimane tower. To the W was recorded the line of the inner, parallel wall of the Venetian fortifications, with a face on the W. (ADelt 92-4) ARKADIA Asea. Dr Jeannette Fors6n (Swedish Institute) reports on the 2001 season: 'In 2001 fieldwork at Asea Paleokastro was limited to one week with the purpose of tracing the course of the wall encir- cling the lower city. The parts of this wall that are closest to the Paleokastro are visible above ground and had already been cleaned of vegetation and studied in 2000 (a final report is in press in Opuscula Atheniensia). In 2001, with the help of geo- physical methods, our purpose was to trace the course of those parts of the wall that are covered by a 1-2m thick layer of mod- ern alluvium, brought to the site by the Alpheios. 51. Midea: area E of east gate The geophysical survey was conducted in collaboration with Prof. Papamarinopoulos of the University of Patras, using the resistivity method. Thirteen tomographical profiles, or pseudo- sections, were made and in all of them the wall could be seen. Thus, we have a rough idea of how the lower city wall runs, and it seems as if the NE edge of the wall is confined by the Panaitsa ravine. However, a picture of the exact line of the lower city wall can be obtained only by applying georadar to the site.' Lousoi. Fieldwork in 2001 was directed byf Veronika Mitsopoulos-Leon for the Austrian Institute. She reports: 'In the Stadio plot, excavations took place in the area of the hall, clearing work was conducted around a peripteral temple, and documentation and measuring work was carried out. In the Phournoi sector, conservation work was carried out on the excavated houses. The whole settlement area was subject to a geological survey. Several trenches in the area of the hall, which had been uncovered through clearing the previous year, provided crucial information about the ground plan and the stratigraphy of the building and its previous uses. In these trenches, the founda- tions of the rectangular stoa (65.20 x 12.05m) as well as its euthynteria (Fig. 52) and, in places, orthostats, were observed. In the interior a central row of supports divided the building into two naves; of this, three stone slabs on top of layers of lime- stone rubble were uncovered at an interaxial distance of 4.50m. In addition, foundations of an E-W transverse wall became vis- ible in the N; foundations of a wall running lengthways in the S were also visible. Thus the stoa's wings probably contained two closed groups of rooms of about 12m length. On its E side, the stoa gave onto the slope through a colonnade, framed by return- ing walls; the latter might correspond in their extent to the closed interior rooms at the ends of the hall.</page><page sequence="28">28 DAVID BLACKMAN The geological evaluation of the settlement area of Lousoi, finally, attests a high degree of safety and land stability for this area in particular, in contrast to the areas of the Artemis sanctu- ary and settlement area in the Phoumoi sector, which are vul- nerable to landslides. In the peristyle house of the Phournoi excavation, a stretch of a N-S wall W of the oikos or bath-building was conserved, since components of the dry stone wall had begun to slide off through weather-related erosion. The stones were removed, cleaned and placed back, bound with sieved earth; those stones that had already fallen off the uppermost layer were replaced. The plots of land in the Stadio area that had been bought the previous year were fenced off around the stoa and around the temple. The information boards that had been erected in the Phouroi sector and in the Artemis sanctuary were replaced with weather-resistant vinyl boards.' 52. Lousoi: stoa foundations In the S, the hall's foundations were sunk into a packing comprised of relocated workshop debris (the interior lining of a kiln destined for the processing of clay or metals) as well as fur- ther material datable to the 6th to 4th Ct. Remarkable in this con- text is the find of a clay antefix fragment (Tka 1/01), which on stylistic grounds is to be dated to the 2nd half of the 6th or early 5th Ct. To the E of the stoa, a workshop of yet undetermined function, its floor reinforced with tile debris, points to a previ- ous use, probably connected with the construction of the stoa. The stoa can be dated to the 3rd or 2nd Ct on the basis of com- parisons with similar ground plans. What remains remarkable, however, is the existence of LA artifacts in the area. Clearing work on a terrace above and SE of the stoa led to the discovery of a previously unknown temple. An L-shaped two-faced limestone wall (w. 0.9m) is accompanied, at right angles, by a broken line of foundations in the form of large limestone slabs (max. 1.80m2) above layers of limestone rub- ble. These building remains allow the reconstruction of an E- facing peripteral temple with a central cella (clear w. 7.90m) and with a peristasis of six by at least 12 columns (15.70 x 33.40m) at an axial distance of ca 2.93m. The still uncertain length of the peripteros and its unusual stylobate, which takes the shape of a broken line of foundations, make a secure dating impossible, although a connection with the LA antefix cannot be excluded. The stoa, the peripteral temple and the area of extended flat terracing suggest that this area was a public centre of Lousoi, complementing the extra-urban sanctuary of Artemis ca 1.lkm NE of the city. ? ^^'^-^'^~,., / 1/ // // IX - f. / / / f // J - -1; // , _ / _1fI/ I' , % . 2 g ( 4 ' \ \ . - ,-: ~ - ~ . . -'~, \' .vi V-^^ ** ^~~~~" Io' o; "? 1 ? -l 53. Megalopolis: theatre Megalopolis. During restoration work at the anc. theatre, a number of archaeological investigations were conducted for the final clarification of certain architectural details, and especially the form of the two retaining walls of the koilon, preserved to a considerable height (E: 7.25-8.70m, W: 6.65-9.50m). It seems that the E retaining wall, with a total length of 65m, was built in the rectangular isodomic masonry system, which added to the stability of the wall. This system first appeared in Greece in defensive works of the 2nd quarter of the 4th Ct BC, and was ini- tiated by the Theban general Epa-meinondas. Short spur walls were anchored to this wall as buttresses, at regular intervals of 3.20m, while from a certain point westwards, where the retain- ing wall receives the greatest pressure from the hill behind, a second wall, 12.40m in length, ran parallel to the main wall, doubling its thickness to 4m (Fig. 53). The two walls were joined by short cross walls, creating compartments which were filled with earth. A similar device was used in the Messene for- tification walls, and especially in the section dated in the late 4th-early 3rd Ct BC. To the N of the E retaining wall were also discovered the remains of a rectangular underground tower, a sort of underground support for the main wall, similar to those recorded at the Dodona theatre (297-272 BC). The tower post- dated the construction of the retaining wall, and may possibly be associated with the stay in the city of Pyrrhos, king of Epiros, during 273 BC. The W retaining wall was also provided with a second wall, running along its inner face. The skenotheke build- ing was apparently lacking foundations, and the walls were coated with lime plaster; its W wall is preserved to a height of 3.90m, and its N wall to a height of 3.48m. In the area of the E parodos was discovered for the first time part of a clay rectangular water channel, probably chan- nelling water from the E to the main orchestra drain; it is preserved for a length of 13m. It has been estab- lished that the Megalopolis theatre was one of the "\\ Gfirst public monuments to be erected immediately \ after the foundation of the city, at the beginning of x \\\ the 370s, and one of the first theatres in Greece to \ use a circular plan for the koilon and the orchestra. \\ The construction of the retaining walls belongs to \\ \ the 2nd half of the 4th Ct BC.

In the 'Troupitses' cave at the site of Potami, a N deposit was identified covering the floor of one of the cham- bers, with pottery and fragments of bone and stone tools of the same period. In the surrounding area sherds and obsidian frag- ments were collected on the surface. (ADelt 150) LAKONIA Alepochori. Kouveleike cave 1. E. Stravopodi (EPS) reports on the fifth and sixth seasons of work (1995-1996). In the outer chamber of the cave, excavation of trenches A5, B2, F2, and A2 was completed, and study of the stratigraphy was undertaken. Trench AS: two layers were excavated, a brown-yellowish brown and an ashy layer, encountered also in previous seasons. Pottery was found in quantity, while lithics and organic materi- al were very sparse. At a depth of 0.45m the deposit was a mix- ture of brown-red sediment overlying a layer of pure ash rich in fine pottery. A pit found in the NE part of the trench contained stones, animal bones, and abundant ceramic finds. Trench F2: the deposits here followed the sequence estab- lished in trench A5. Its W section was characterized by a pletho- ra of anthropological remains contained in earliest cultural horizon lying on the cave floor. Whether the deposit was in situ or secondary was not yet clear. Trench A2 exhibited the same succession of deposits as F2, and the basal reddish material had apparently been redeposited. 54. &amp; 55. Palaiochori Kynourias: o l, Mycenaean tombs Finds were heavily eroded and bones had become petrified. In trench B2 the brownish grey layer contained plenty of pot- tery, obsidian artefacts and a concentration of shells. Stratigraphic sections of B2-B3, A5, A4- A5, B2- A2, F2- F3, and A3-A4 were studied and drawn. C14 samples from the ashy layers were submitted to 'Demokritos' for dating. Previous C14 samples for the 0.5m depth had provided LN and FN dates. (ADelt 710-11) Kouveleike cave 2. Excavation continued in the 1995-1996 seasons in six trenches (Chr. Kontaxi, EPS). The aims were to investigate the area near the cave entrance where undisturbed N levels had previously been located; to continue excavation of the section (4,30) where a human skeleton had been partly unearthed; and to carry out a study of vertical stratigraphy in the excavated trenches. In trench 5,30 a brown layer represented the main occupa- tion horizon of the cave. It was rich in pottery, mainly coarse- ware, with impressed and plastic decorative motifs. Among the stone tools recovered were hand-axes, grinders and pounders, whereas the assemblage of knapped tools comprised almost exclusively obsidian artefacts (flakes, side-retouched blades, projectile points, etc.) and only two flint specimens. Faunal remains included bones of domestic animals and horns; a frag- ment of a human skull and a jaw with teeth still in place were collected. The natural cave floor was reached at 1.87m to 2.1 Om in trenches 5,40 and 4,30. In the west part of trench 3,30 a loose reddish deposit was found confined within a circular arrangement of stones contain- ing a fragmentary pithoid vessel. As the familiar brown deposit was dug out, a complete contracted skeleton was exposed lying in a shallow pit dug into the bedrock. The stone feature was apparently associated with the burial, as the head of the dead was placed right beneath it. Archaeological evidence to date reflects domestic and eco- nomic activities on a seasonal base in the cave during the FN, as was confirmed by radiocarbon dates (4231 -3799 BC). Parallel to the excavation are ongoing sedimentological studies, analyses of skeletal material and palaeodiet, chemical analyses of pottery, and sourcing of raw materials. (ADelt 711-12) Areopolis.

Geraki: Hellenistic building Excavation in 1996 was carried out in two levels formed by erosion of the original surface of the cave deposits. In the upper level excavation reached a depth of 2.05m below level 0 (grid level). Two occupation surfaces, poor in artefacts, were identi- fied, apparently representing two short-lived occupation events. At the W edge of the trench a circular stone structure was exposed (di. 0.40-0.50m). In the lower level excavation reached -3.45m. A number of successive ash layers were removed from the location right under the arch of the cave roof, where Pal cave-dwellers would choose to install their fires. Of the recovered archaeological remains, the majority of animal bones-mostly fragmented and burnt-belong to herbi- vore species; the predominance of Dama Dama and Capra Ibex reflects the practice of selective hunting. Sieving yielded bones of small vertebrates (birds, rodents, snakes, etc.) which are not related to human activity but provide information about the cli- mate and environment at that time. High quality Mousterian tools made from flint, quartz and andesite were found along with poorer quality tools made from the local limestone. In addition to the excavation, T. Chatzitheodorou undertook detailed plotting of the seabed of the Oitylon Bay in order to reconstruct the physical setting of the cave in the last Ice Age. Kalamakia would have overlooked a wide coastal plain that is today the bay at a considerably higher elevation above sea level. Archaeologist-diver C. Agouridis directed an underwater inves- tigation of the slopes of the bay. The aim was to locate sub- merged caves in the vicinity. Two small caves were found which, however, do not preserve early deposits. (ADelt 721-2) A conference was held at Areopolis in August 2001 on Kalamakia and other caves in Mani. Amyklai. A row of 12 tombs of PG date was investigated in the area of Sklavochori, including two pithos burials, one pot-bur- ial, four cist tombs and five simple pit-graves. In the same gen- eral area was discovered a hut-shaped grave, without funeral offerings. (ADelt 129-31) Geraki (anc. Geronthrai).

(For prelimi- nary reports see Pharos, 1995-2000). The 2001 season was dedicated to systematic excavations in field 17 on the NW part of the summit. New trenches were opened in area I, in the W part of this field and in area II, on the E side. Both areas have been under investigation since 1997 and have yielded evidence for human activities dating from the FN, the EH II, ",,,2 : MH and PG to the HL/ER periods (1st Ct BC). Extensive, well-preserved architectural remains 9?O0 belong to the EH II period, when most of the forti- fled summit of the acropolis seems to have been "-a ~ . ' &gt;inhabited, and to the latest, HL/ER phase of habita- tion. The HL building in area I can now be seen to have 10 or more rooms and to cover an area of at least 27 x 12m (Fig. 56). To the E the continuation of its S facade was traced (wall 1), which here bor- ders an open area or (unpaved) court associated with the building. The room W of the court was provided with an entrance from the street. Although we opened up a relatively large area, the W and E perimeter of the HL building have yet to be defined. An interesting result of this year's excavation in area I is the new evidence for the chronology and function of several of the HL rooms and the discovery of a pre-HL building phase below the court area. From the NW room evidence for at least two destructions was obtained. An earlier destruction, which could only be partially explored, seems to have been accompanied by fire. The last destruction was probably of a gradual nature and presented itself in the form of a thick layer of fallen roof-tiles. Several of these were impressed with a stamp showing the so-called dokana, symbol of the Dioskouroi. Judging by the fact that the upper, earthen floor had almost entirely eroded away, the building was abandoned some time before the collapse of the roof. Indications for the final use of this room and the date of its abandonment are provided by the scattered remains of a drinking set, which had been left behind in a cupboard or on a shelf. This set consisted of a krater (a pos- sible 'Plakettenvase') and a series of locally made drinking cups. In the room immediately to the E, half of which had already been excavated in 2000, more evidence for metalwork- ing was found, including what may be the foundations of a fur- nace or kiln. In the area of the courtyard, the upper layers of which had been severely affected by erosion, evidence came to light of ear- lier, pre-HL construction. Two neatly built walls, 10 and 12, were found at a lower level and have a slightly different align- ment from the walls of the HL building. An associated destruc- tion layer contained some fallen tiles, unburned mud-bricks, a finely carved bone or ivory head of a duck (Fig. 57), probably an inlay of a wooden object. The pottery suggests a late A or early C date. This building had been founded on the levelled remains of a much earlier structure, whose existence is indicated by wall 26 (w. im). Associated with the latter was a layer with burnt mud- 57. Geraki: bone or ivory duck-head</page><page sequence="31">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 2001-2002 31 brick. Because of the levelling operations preceding the con- struction of walls 10 and 12, not much of this burned destruction deposit was left intact, but it contained enough pottery to assign it a date in the late EH II period (contemporary with Lerna IIIC). It is possible that wall 26 belonged to the same complex as the storeroom with large pithos, burned sealings and seeds that were discovered in a test trench in 1997 ca 13m to the W. Of no less interest was the discovery of an E-W wall ca 1.20m N of wall 26.This is a double wall, at least im wide, with an inner core of rubble, and may have served as a fortification wall. Since the wall was found on the last day of the excavation, its construction date could not be firmly established. It seems, however, to have been in use (or reuse) in the late A/early C period. In area II, attention was focused on the EH II complex, parts of which had been uncovered in 1999 and 2000 (see AR 2000-01, 33 fig. 61). This consists of a megalithic, double wall, with a thick intermediate fill of rubble and at least one case- mate-like room, and a N-S cross wall which is 0.80m wide. This year the W continuation of the megalithic fortification wall was found and also the W part of the casemate. The latter yield- ed the lower half of a large pithos and more burned sealings. Last year, parts of two to three pithoi, burned sealings and seeds had been found here. Excavation in area II also produced important new evidence for occupation in the MH period. From the amount of erosion it still seems that the summit of the acropolis remained abandoned for some time after fire destruction of the late EH II period, but there is now evidence for the (partial) rebuilding of the fortifi- cation wall in MH. Whether this MH wall, which is much less massive than its precursor, also served defensive purposes or functioned primarily as a retaining or terrace wall, is as yet unclear. A second phase of rebuilding of the acropolis wall, on a line N of the EH II/MH construction but S of the HL wall, may be assigned to the A or EC period on the evidence of the associated pottery.' Gounare Lakedaimonos. Sections of four walls belonging to two architectural phases were excavated ca 4km S of mod. Sparta. (ADelt 129) Gytheion. At the junction of Odos Mikras Asias and Poly- deukous were excavated parts of a LR house, including two rooms and an atrium with floor mosaics, as well as a row of ECh built cist-tombs (Fig. 58). The floor mosaics, dating from the late 3rd-early 4th Ct AD, preserved only geometric designs, while the one in the atrium was apparently associated with a built cistern (impluvium), and a system of two drains; with this open air space was also related a built structure, possibly a drain, in the N sector of the plot. The 14 ECh cist tombs were located in the W part of the plot. (ADelt 133-5) A. Papathanassiou (EPS) reports on the preliminary study of the skeletal material recovered from the 14 ECh built cist- graves found in the P. Tsirivakos plot at the junction of M. Asias and Polydeukous. The study was aimed at determining the min- imum number of individuals in the sample; their age, sex, and height; and any pathological alterations of the bones. However, the overall poor preservation of the material, the frag- mented state of long bones and lack of complete skulls, maxil- lae and other diagnostic bones, as well as the scarcity of teeth in the assemblage, inhibited the precise determination of the above parameters. Out of a total of 35, gender determination was pos- sible for 17 individuals, 10 male and 7 female; 30 adults over the age of 18 and 5 individuals under the age of 10 are repre- sented in the sample; height was estimated, at 1.60m, for only one individual, probably female.

Tooth decay, indicating diet rich in vegetable carbohydrates, was quite common, as was dental attrition. Metacranial bones bore little evidence of patho- logical conditions; several cases of minor arthritis and tendon ossification identified in patellae and phalanges were attributed to increased physical activity of the individuals. An evaluation of the analysed data may be summarized as ollows: only part of the population is represented in the sam-on ple, specifically adults of possibly at o pslhigh social status, judging fromlin the carefullyassae constructed graves, the absence of children, and the generally good state of health suggested in the sample. The absence of skulls and the multiple burials can be explained in th e context of buria cus ndtoms. (AD elt 719-21) r Kouphovouno. W.G. Cavanagh, C.B. Mee (BSA) and J.

Kouphovouno: Middle Helladic spearhead logical range and stratigraphical sequence covering the MN-EBA periods; to investigate the architectural features and refine our excavation strategy and methodology; to set up and test in the field sampling procedures and sampling strategies; to explore the site in advance of the purchase of land for the full excavation seasons. To these ends four 5 x 5m areas were explored. Area C: immediately below the plough zone a number of dis- tinct contexts were revealed, ranging in date from MN to MH. In the NW and SE sectors were areas of burnt mud-brick/pise, 60. Kouphovouno, area B: crouched burial whilst a large mass of cobbles and stones extended over much of the W and S. A grave on the SE side lay entirely within the top 20 cm. This skeleton was accompanied by a MH shoe-sock- eted spearhead (Fig. 59) and a MH cup. A second burial, accompanied by a spindle whorl and a MH jug, was uncovered in the NE sector. The earliest remains were first revealed in the NW sector, and then found to extend over the whole W side and into a good part of the centre. Here we seem to have the remains of a MN building destroyed by fire. In addition to the burnt mud-brick/pis6, a burnt clay floor was uncovered. The 1999 core 1 indicated a depth of archaeological sediment here reach- ing 2.65m. This considerable depth of MN stratigraphy holds out great promise for future excavation. Area B: below the disturbed plough zone were revealed sev- eral of the 'stone platforms' or cobbled features which are so characteristic of the site. Two burials were the latest features of archaeological interest: to the N was the remains of a pit grave cut partly into one of the 'stone platforms': the inhumation was in a crouched posture and a clay spindle-whorl was found pressed into the jaw; at the S end of area B a second crouched burial lay in a cist grave, probably of MH date (Fig. 60). The stone cobble feature in the NW sector of the trench was sec- tioned: it measured just under 2 m SW-NE and at least 3.3 SE-NW. The pottery included both FN and EH II. A trial in the SW sector of area B revealed two smaller, more discrete, stone piles, roughly circular in form, measuring 0.7 m across and up to 0.35 m high (stone supports for wooden flooring?). Area A: immediately below the plough soil appeared a 'stone-platform' feature extending roughly 3.4 m N-S and 3.6 m E-W. This was set in a much cleaner, yellow clay matrix con- taining just a few stones, evidently decayed mud-brick. Near the E edge, a skeleton was discovered, lying in a grave bound- ed to the E by a line of stones. A pair of copper alloy tweezers, of a type common throughout the BA, accompanied the burial. It was decided to excavate this 'stone platform' in quadrants, allowing E-W and N-S sections to be reconstructed. The stone fill was of very loose rubble, consisting of cobbles, earth and a large number of sherds (as well as animal bones, stone tools and other finds); this had been dumped into a pit cut into the earlier levels. The fill (and the pit into which it had been deposited) was much deeper than the features excavated in area B, and excavation suggested that originally at least 7m3 of material were dumped here. The pottery was predominantly EH II with some EH I and Neolithic. The feature may have served as a quarry for building materials (e.g. clay), and have been filled to level the site. Thus the 'stone platforms' can vary considerably from one example to another. Area D: this area proved one of the more difficult to exca- vate. Below topsoil two major stone features were distinguished: a 'stone platform' made up of smaller cobbles to the S, similar to the 'stone platforms' in area B, and a zone of what looked like stone tumble, made up of rather larger stones, in the NW sector. Eventually an infant inhumation was found near the NW comer, nestling among the stones, and then, a little further S, the top of a human skull indicated another burial. It is possible that this is a funerary complex, part of a cairn or tumulus, but further exca- vation is required to clarify this puzzling feature. Preliminary analysis of the finds: the pottery (CBM, I. Whitbread, N. Brodie) includes MN patterned and monochrome Urfiris, scribble-burnished, LN and FN coarse wares, black- burished and grey wares, (probably) EH I red-slipped, impor- tant deposits of EH II (sauceboats, Urfirnis, etc.). MH pottery (but no distinctively EH III) has also been identified. Samples have been selected for residue analysis (A. Roumpou). Flint and obsidian tools (A.

On the national road from Sparta to Tripolis were discovered architectural remains, including the destruction deposit of a building, which, judging by the pottery finds, date from the LA to LC period.

Excavations were carried out by the 5th EBA in 1996 at the important LByz church of Agios Georgios, mentioned in a chrysobull of Andronikos II (d. 1328). The foundations indicate that this was a regular structure with tripartite sanc- tuary, but with a large apses on N and S sides of the nave-a Post-Byz feature (Fig. 61). There are traces of four piers that would have supported the roof; a small narthex is also evident. Part of the foundations of the altar table were also found. The church's opus sectile floors in the nave and narthex are particular- ly impressive, with the traditional 'five loaves' motif of interlocking circles (11th-12th Ct ). These indicate a high level of patronage, and can be compared with some of the best extant work of the MByz period. Marble relief sculptures were also found on the site. 61. Lyko Wall-painting fragments are dated to the 13th Ct AD. One coin was found, of Manuel I (d. 1180). (ADelt 175-80) Byz churches identified include: the church of the Analepsis at Longkanikos, a single-aisle structure with rough masonry, except for cloisonn6 work on the apse (ADelt 159). At Neos Mystras, the church of Agios Ioannis o Theologos at the Boubali site has been declared an ancient monument, including a crypt well incorporating part of a R carved sarcophagus. (ADelt 159) Magoula Spartes. In the general area of Magoula a number of architectural features were excavated, including part of a large built drain (w. 15.50m), running NE-SW and probably associ- ated with the Arapissa baths, remains of which lie very close to the NW; part of a rectangular cistern; sections of a HL/LHL wall, serving as the limit of an open area; part of an EByz wall at the site of Aeras; and finally, sections of walls and a sloping floor, covered with waterproof plaster, possibly a wine-press or a water reservoir, at the site of Kokkineika.

Remains of a LR farm were unearthed in the area, includ- ing the destruction deposit of the building, fragments of storage pithoi and other pottery (pottery with 'square rouletting [cog- ging]' type decoration, plates of African red slip ware, with grille patterns, etc.), dating from the 4th-6th Cts AD. Earlier HL pottery recorded in the area is not directly related to the actual building. (ADelt 131-2) vounos: church of Agios Georgios Sparta. In 1996, 23 rescue excavations were conducted in the mod. town, the majority involving architectural material of var- ious phases, ranging from the HL to the R period. Remains of two architectural phases, the earlier one HL, were discovered in Odos Archidamou, in the NW part of the plot. To this phase belonged the destruction deposit of a build- ing, including part of a stone paved floor, with a storage pithos set in it, fragments of mould-made figurines and moulds, part of a small plastered cistern nearby, and finally, a clay larax-like vessel, in situ to its E. The finds suggest workshop activity in the area, probably a potter's workshop. (ADelt 103-5) In Odos Triakosion were investigated the remains of a LR bathhouse, of the 3rd-4th Cts AD, including the praefurnium of a hypocaust, sections of plastered floors, coated with water- proof plaster, a built drain and a well. (ADelt 121-3) In Odos Staufert, antiquities were discovered in three sepa- rate plots. Successive architectural phases, mostly sections of walls, ranging from the A to the R period, included an open air space and a well of HL-R date, in the NW part of the first plot. (ADelt 101-3) In the second plot were investigated part of a trodden earth floor, with a storage pithos set in it, as well as the remains of a structure of an earlier phase, in the SW part of the area. In the SE sector was discovered part of a destroyed road surface of trodden earth and gravel, running SE-NW, lined by a clay drain; the associated pottery was of R date. (ADelt 105) Finally, in the third plot, a number of features were record- ed, including an apothetes containing 800 clay figurines, of var- ious types, and an inscribed Laconian relief, sections of walls of two phases, dating from the C to the HL periods, and a G bur- ial, below the apothetes, discovered under a stone pile and a stone slab of trapezoidal shape.

Sparta, Odos Thermopylon: Roman villa Architectural remains of various phases were recorded in a number of plots of the mod. city. In Odos Gitiada they includ- ed part of a roofed space, in the N part of the plot, with three circular structures, probably serving as bases for pillars or wooden posts; the pottery ranged from the A to the R periods. (ADelt 105-6) In Odos Leonidou the excavated remains included a built drain of ER date, judging by the base of a W sigillata pot sealed with planta pedis, an apothetes of A date, and fragmentary architectural elements dating from the LHL/ER period, which have apparently destroyed most traces of the earlier phases, especially the A, and which confirm the evidence for an exten- sive re-organization of the city during the 1st Ct BC. The pottery collected includes a large quantity of material of the ER period in the upper levels, while the lower levels include pottery as early as the LG period. (ADelt 107-8) In Odos Triakosion 80, architectural remains of at least three different construction phases, ranging from the HL to the MByz period, also confirm the dense occupation of the area around the anc. acropolis in all periods until the establishment of Mystras as the administrative centre of Lacedaimon. The upper levels included MByz architectural remains, mainly lying over earlier buildings of LR date. To the second phase belong remains testifying to successive repairs and modifications throughout the R and possibly LR period, while to the third phase can be assigned only fragmentary walls of the HL period. The wealth of the portable finds and other factors, such as an Antonine inscription incorporated in one of the walls, suggests that these were probably important buildings of C and R Sparta, almost completely destroyed in MByz times. (ADelt 109-11) More architectural remains of the ER and LR periods were investigated at the junction of Odos Klearchou and Triakosion, including an enclosed rectangular space, part of a larger building complex of the LR period, extending to the NNW (coins), and a LHL apothetes. Remains of an earlier building phase were also located, mostly walls, part of a clay- slab floor, and pottery generally of R date, possibly ER. To judge by fragmentary architectural members discovered in the area (Doric capital, fragments of marble wall veneer, etc.) the building involved was probably monumental in character. (ADelt 114-16) Finally, in Odos Thermopylon were excavated four rooms, part of a R villa, with interesting floor mosaics of EByz date (Fig. 62). Three of the rooms (A, F, A) preserved sections of mosaics with geometric motifs, while the fourth, room B, pre- served part of a composition involving a fish, a female figure reclining on a couch eating grapes, and a Cupid standing on a dolphin and fishing, in addition to floral motifs and the usual geometric decorations; the central scene is not preserved. All the mosaics were of good quality, with rich colours, including black, white, red, blue, green and yellow, and can be dated to the 2nd half of the 3rd Ct AD. (ADelt 116-18) Very fragmentary sections of walls and drains or wells of HL/R date were also recorded at the junction of Odos Mykenon and Gitiada, in Terma odou Dioskouron (three LR rooms, the base of a perirrhanterion, and a relief with a repre- sentation of Herakles), in Odos Palaiologou, in Odos Menelaou, in Odos Orthias Artemidos, and in Odos Leonidou. (ADelt 111-12, 118-20, 120, 123). In Odos Letous remains of walls of the Byz era were investigated. Funerary remains were excavated in a relatively small num- ber of plots. Part of an extensive R cemetery was investigated in two plots in Odos Byzantiou, to the W of the mod. town, including 25 new tombs (2 hut-shaped, 5 tile-roofed, 2 pits, 15 built cist tombs, with or without plastered interior, 1 pot burial), 13 of which were arranged in three rows of four, five and four tombs respectively. (ADelt 113-14, 120-1) Architectural remains and five tile-roofed, hut-shaped tombs, without funeral offerings (and hence probably of Ch date), were recorded in Odos Gortsologou. (ADelt 112-13) Sparta Basilica Project. Rebecca Sweetman (BSA) reports: 'Work continued in June 2001 with the second season of the Sparta Basilica Project directed by Ms E.

During the first'season clean- ing work had concentrated on the basilica proper and the pri- mary architectural work had focused on the execution of an \ \</page><page sequence="35">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 2001-2002 35 accurate ground plan and drawing the stone by stone elevations of the main monument. During the second season, the cleaning work was concentrated on the W building complex and the architectural focus was on the creation of sections through the entire basilica complex and the formation of possible recon- structions. Cleaning was begun in the western area of the W complex in order to define the location of its walls. Once it was exposed our suspicions were confirmed that there were further connected buildings to the W. The exact nature of the relationship of these rooms to the W building is, however, as yet unclear. Previously unrecorded walls and doorways were also exposed and were added to the 2000 plan of the basilica complex. Some further cleaning work was undertaken in the nave and the apse in order to define the area of the potential ambo and plan the floor contexts at a scale of 1:20. Although poorly pre- served, it seems likely, on the basis of its position in the centre of the nave and its shape (round with straight edges on the E and W), that we have evidence for a walk-up, walk-down ambo (Fig. 63) which has a number of parallels in Greece. Plans, ele- vations and photographs were prepared in the newly cleaned areas and a spatial analysis of the building in terms of the room function and status was begun. The focus of the survey and architectural work in the second season was on completing the plan of the W building, as many of its walls had been newly exposed. Consequently we have completed the plan of the entire basilica and W building com- plex. Additionally, around 20 architectural sections were taken through the basilica and W complex in order to provide as many topographical views of the entire complex as possible while providing an active tool for creating possible reconstructions of the basilica. To this end a more detailed study of the doorways, load-bearing walls and fallen masonry was undertaken to ascer- tain how the basilica may have been roofed. Several models are feasible and the architect, Nigel McGuirk, is currently produc- ing these images. We were also able to make some refinements to architectural phasing, initially suggested after the first sea- son, which have now been incorporated into the state plan of the entire complex. A new program of geophysical survey was undertaken by Michael Boyd in order to help place the basilica within the con- text of other architectural remains on the acropolis. Among other features the plan of a large building of Byz date has been revealed to the NE of the basilica. As a result of our study of the architecture and its phases we are fairly convinced that the basilica should be dated to the EByz period, probably the late 6th Ct. However, there are some architectural anomalies for a building of this period. Our pre- liminary studies and reconstructions show that there is likely to have been a dome over the bema area and the chunks of mason- ry indicate that there may have been half-domes over the pro- truding apses of the E wing. The use of domes at this early peri- od is unusual where pitched roofs are far more common; how- ever, there is a close parallel for the design in the basilica of Ayia Sofia in Korone. Given the innovative designs of the acropolis basilica at such an early point in the development of Byz church architecture in Greece, perhaps we could go as far as to say that its construction marks a turning point in Byz church architecture.' Stoa. In 2001 a detailed examination of pottery excavated by Professors Waywell and Wilkes from the R stoa in Sparta between 1988 and 1991 was undertaken by Clare Pickersgill and Paul Roberts. Pickersgill reports: ' On advice from the excavators the remaining contexts, not previously examined by Bailey (BSA 1993), were analysed in the light of new evidence obtained last year from the local 63. Sparta basilica: site of ambo coarse pottery excavated from the Roman Theatre in 1997 and 1998. The coarse wares confirm Bailey's suggested construc- tion date for the stoa of early-mid 2nd Ct AD. The material also reveals the later history of this part of the stoa. The stoa in the LR period shows a similar usage to the theatre in the same peri- od, namely the dumping of material or as an area of habitation. This suggests that this part of the stoa was re-used from the late 4th or early 5th Ct, and indicates that the building probably had no further public role. Some pottery from excavations under- taken by the Ephorate was looked at for the essential compara- nda. The following is a summary of the pottery results of this year's work and how it has expanded our knowledge of the pot- tery of Sparta. Imports: the latest piece of African red slip ware (ARS) found so far was recorded, Hayes form 99, postdating AD 470. More Phocaean red slip ware (PRS) forms were also recorded, which is significant given the importance of PRS only after the major interruption of ARS imports in most of the Mediterranean in about AD 430. These imports, therefore, postdate Alaric's invasion of Sparta in AD 396, showing continuity in trade and market systems although possibly on a reduced level. Locally produced pottery: the form series of the previously unidentified LR gouged ware, produced in Sparta and not found in Corinth or Athens, was expanded and the first example of an open form was recorded. This was a bowl, which was a copy of Hayes form 53A, dating to the early 5th Ct. There was also a complete example of a gouged ware flagon, the shape and dec- oration of which would date it to the late 6th Ct, and so later than most gouged ware examined so far. More forms of wares with cogged and rouletted decoration were also recorded including some narrow-necked vessels and small lids which accompany them. There were more examples of local imitations of ARS including some stamped pieces. New forms of red painted ware were recognized including a near complete local two-handled LR amphora. It is now clear that the red painted ware is com- mon in Sparta in the LR period but is not found in any quantity in Corinth or Athens. It is in fact similar to pottery found in S and Adriatic Italy at the same period. Finally, many late lamps were recorded of which most appear to be local with one possi- ble Athenian lamp. This fits with Bailey's identification of Athenian lamps from the stoa. Local and imported coarse ware: the form series of coarse wares was expanded considerably and the chronology was sharpened especially with regard to flagons, bowls, and cooking pots. More examples of imported cooking pots from the Aegean were found, which again expanded the form series, and strengthened still further the apparent links with trade routes between Adriatic Italy and the East.</page><page sequence="36">36 DAVID BLACKMAN AICEIRI lagCplan des sildichen Sladtbericchc Stand 2001 gcz.: ;. l lstater Nov. 2XI1) / "....... .. .--- -- ' . - '" .

Aigeira: site Amphoras: once again few imports were noted with the majority dating to the early Imperial period. This is in contrast with coastal sites such as Athens and Corinth which have a much greater quantity of amphora finds. Fabrics: this year the fabric series was expanded, and an examination was made of all samples by eye. This includes the colour of break and surface, hardness and a description of inclu- sions. At least one clay source seems to have been common to all periods and it is hoped that further analysis may reveal how pro- portions of inclusions within the same fabric may vary in differ- ent periods and could therefore be a possible indication of date. Next year it is planned that samples will be taken from Greece so that chemical/petrological analysis can be carried out.' ACHAIA Aigeira. Archaeological investigations in 2001, directed by Georg Ladstatter for the Austrian Institute, included the exca- vation of the LC 'banqueting house' on the Solon plot, a re- excavation on the acropolis, and a measured survey of architec- tural remains of the city walls in connection with a geological evaluation of the terrain (Fig. 64).

Each bath tub, measuring 1.20 x 0.70m, was built of broken tile, its bottom and stepped seat were made from pebbles mixed with mortar, and a scooping basin of solid limestone was set into the bot- tom. Even if the building displays strong affinities to houses in planned 4th-Ct cities in the NW Gr area, it is remarkable that the defin- ing oikos is missing. Instead, the bathing room with four tubs and the /&gt;~. ~ andron with a maximum of 11 klinai zL\ 'suggests a public, official function, ;- such as a hostel or a club house. The erection of this 'banqueting i, . o . " house' continues to be dated to the mid-4th Ct on the basis of the stylis- tic assessment of the andron's peb- ble mosaic, the remains of which were cleaned and consolidated in 2001 by conservators of the Patras Ephorate. Among the 2nd-Ct modifications and repairs that can be observed is a still unexplained pool structure that was installed in the S part of the bathing room. Following the recording of remains of a fortification wall SW of the acropolis in 2000, further parts of the walls were observed and examined on the E and N in 2001, so that it can be assumed that a circuit wall once enclosed the enlarged acrop- olis area. This is a double-faced construction with massive fill- ing; its outer face is characterized by conglomerate blocks with a pseudo-polygonal cut. Even though large parts of the wall have fallen prey to natural erosion or deliberate stone-robbing, its entire course can be traced on the basis of existing contours of the land. The geological evaluation confirms that the wall consistently follows the consolidated natural conglomerate zones above the instable marl. It remains to be concluded that an extended acropolis area of ca 3.5ha was enclosed by a 900m long circuit wall. The techni- cal differences from the HL wall with its isodomic blocks sug- gests that we have here an older fortification. From this it can probably be inferred that a smaller A-C southern town formed part of the development of the city of Aigeira.</page><page sequence="37">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 2001-2002 37 65. Aigeira: bathing room In the framework of the re-examination of Alzinger's exca- vation on the acropolis, the W foundations of 'building B' were cleared and uncovered in order to study their structural forma- tion. The foundation consists of three layers of conglomerate blocks, mostly with smoothed horizontal resting surfaces. Its good state of preservation contradicts W. Alzinger's assumption of seismic disturbances which would-among other things-have been responsible for a supposed E foundation to have shifted out of axis. The careful construction of this foundation allows the recon- struction of a monumental elevation. On the basis of its meas- urements, it is possible to attribute to this foundation a series of footing blocks now built into the later acropolis wall. It thus seems plausible to interpret the foundation, not as belonging to a 7th-Ct elongated temple, but rather as the substructure of a sacred building in the shape of a temple in antis that cannot have been built before the 6th Ct. The find of a sandstone capital in the vicinity of the acropo- lis, whose echinus curve still points to a 6th-Ct date, together with the earlier and formally different capital found the year before, attest the existence of two different Doric orders in the Archaic period. One of these capitals probably belonged to the temple in antis.' Aigion. At the junction of Odos Eisodion and K. Palaiologou, within the limits of the Myc acropolis, were unearthed architec- tural remains covering a long chronological period. The earliest remains belong to the MH period and include the foundations of a large building running NE-SW, inside which, and below the level of its walls, were excavated two tombs. The floor of the building consisted of small pebbles and trodden earth, better preserved in the SE comer. The building was destroyed by a fire, which resulted in a thick destruction layer of carbonized wood, ashes and burnt earth, on which the Myc walls were built. The latter form at least two separate areas in the SW part of the plot, and include part of a small stone floor. After the end of the Myc period, the area was abandoned until the C and HL era, when it was again occupied for habitation (small 4th-Ct BC cistern). The R period is represented by two clay drains, the remains of a cistern, and a pebble floor, while two circular apo- thetai were opened here during Byz times. (ADelt 239) At the junction of Odos K. Palaiologou and Navarinou were found two burial pithoi, looted in antiquity, while a small R cistern was identified in Odos Andronopoulou. (ADelt 239) A marble headless female statue of the type of 'small Herakleiotissa', a R copy of a 4th-Ct BC original, as well as the head of the statue, were presented to the museum of Aigion. Ano Mazaraki (Rakita). During the eighth season of work at the G temple of Artemis, it was finally established that there was no altar construction set up to the N/NW, on the main axis of the building; if nevertheless the altar was located off-centre towards the E, it has been probably destroyed in the course of roadworks for the mod. road from Rakita to Aigion, in 1972. The presence of an altar is virtually certain, judging by the burnt bones found in large quantities in the apothetes. The comer of another building was identified to the NW of the temple, a sec- ondary building or a second temple, which replaced the original apsidal construction after the destruction of the latter in the 1st half of the 4th Ct BC. The finds include a considerable number of figurines of Artemis and many coins. The most important find of the season was a small bronze mirror of the first quarter of the 5th Ct BC, in a destruction layer, with the inscription: MEFAZ ANEOEKE / FAONTIAI APTAMIAI which confirms the 17-year old suspicions, that the sanctuary was indeed dedi- cated to Artemis. (ADelt 237-8) Exo Agyia. A R wine production installation, part of which was investigated in 1995, was unearthed at the junction of Odos Lambrou Porphyra and Melinas Merkoure (Fig. 66). Four rooms were excavated, including two rectangular cisterns in room 2, the largest of which preserved a clay slab floor and a clay vessel set in the floor. The smaller cistern had a thick plas- ter floor, and was also provided with a similar clay vessel. Traces of two more cisterns were discovered to the N of room 2. Architectural remains of a farm-house were recorded at the junction of Odos Kazantzake and Tellou Agra. (ADelt 232) 66.

A tile-roofed tomb and part of a LC funeral peri- bolos were discovered at the site of Limna. (ADelt 239) Gregores. At the site of Pyrgos, at the top of a conical hill, the remains of a circular building, possibly a tower, were identified. (ADelt 252) Helike. The 1996 season (ADelt 254-6) was covered in AR 1996-97, 42. D. Katsonopoulou reports on the 2001 campaign: 'Helike, the principal anc. city on the SW shore of the Gulf of Corinth, was founded in the BA and destroyed and sub- merged by an earthquake in 373 BC. The Helike project began to search for the city in 1988, with a systematic sonar survey of the seafloor SE of Aigion. The survey determined that the site is not underwater. Since 1991 we have carried out campaigns on the adjacent coastal plain using surface surveys, geophysical exploration, extensive bore hole drilling, and trial trenches. We determined that an area of some 2km2, between the Selinous and Kerynites rivers (Fig. 67), contains anc. occupation hori- zons. In 1993 the Helike Project discovered the site of a large Myc cemetery on the foothill of Kallithea above the plain (Fig. 67), the first evidence of PR habitation in this area. In 1995, the Project excavated a large R building at the Klonis site (K, Fig. 67). This excavation also yielded pottery from the C, PG and LMyc periods. The older pottery was the first indication of PR occupation in the plain. During 2000 we found important indications of Helike's location in the plain, when our test trenches brought to light EBA, C and R habitation horizons. The trench Saitis 1 (H7) in Rizomylos (Fig. 67) yielded evidence of ruined walls, with associated pottery later found to be of the BA. The trench Balalas 1 (H 10, Fig. 67) revealed lagoonal deposits, including a thick layer of black clay (Fig. 68). This is significant because, according to Strabo (8.7.5), Erastothenes visited the area about 150 years after the disappearance of Helike, and mentioned that a poros (probably a lagoon) covered the remains of the city. During the summer of 2001, the Helike Project carried out its eleventh and most successful field campaign. This work pro- duced unambiguous evidence for the location of the lost C city and its PR predecessor. The oldest excavated horizon belongs to the EH IIIa period, judging from ceramic evidence. Equally sig- nificant was the excavation, during the same season, of the prin- cipal R road through the region, directed SE-NW and connect- ing Helike with the neighbouring cities of Aigialeia. Both the architectural and ceramic finds of the 2001 campaign are extraordinary, enriching our knowledge of anc. Helike and adding a new dimension to the earlier history of the region. The principal discoveries of this year are the following: Classical: trenches in the mid-plain of the Eliki-Rizomylos area brought to light significant architectural remains at 3m depth. In the Balalas 3 trench (H19, Fig. 67), we uncovered the lower courses of walls meeting at a right angle, buried under thick lagoonal deposits. The walls were constructed of cobble- stones and semi-worked stones of gray limestone and sandstone of various colors, and bound with mud. An extensive destruc- tion layer of fallen wall stones and large roof-tiles showed that the building was destroyed by an earthquake.</page><page sequence="39">ARCHAEOLOGY SN GREECE 2001-2002 39 ,5 g = s.4 g .''.'.''.'''&gt;''2 bowls (kraters), pedestal-footed cups tankards and cooking g i ii;_1^11 i_ | 0 X ts.

This evidence suggests that the EH settlement may have been destroyed and submerged by an earthquake, as happened to its C successor some two thousand years later. The discovery of a well-preserved and extensive coastal EH settlement in the N Peloponnese, the first ever found in Achaea, adds new and valuable evidence to the existing pattern of 3rd millennium communities spread across the Aegean. Roman: the 2001 campaign also discovered a R road of aver- age width 5-6m, running NW-SE across the Helike plain. We encountered the straight road in six trenches, extending over a distance of 800m in the area between Eliki and Rizomylos (Fig. 67). It is evidently the main coastal road, perhaps built when Achaea became important under the rule of Augustus in the 1St Ct AD. It is almost certainly the road (leoforos) which Pausanias used in the 2nd Ct AD, when he visited 'a chorion on the sea called Helike' (7.24.5), and reported that one could still see the submerged walls of the C city (7.24.13).' Kallithea. Last year we confused two sites in our entry AR 2000-01, 39. The first paragraph describes the Myc cemetery at Kallithea Nikoleikon (Aigialeia), not Kallithea Patron.

Patras: Hellenistic to Roman building complex Mitopole. Excavations in the Myc cemetery, on the lower slopes of Mt Kombovouni, resulted in the investigation of seven chamber tombs, as well as an ECh cist-tomb. The tombs had rectangular, horseshoe-shaped, or circular chambers, only two of which (tombs 3 and 7) preserved an intact tholos roof. Tombl preserved the remains of six primary burials, while another one was discovered in a long pit, covered with slabs; two small irregular pits on either side of the entrance contained the remains of six earlier burials. The tomb was used during LH IIIA2, early LH IIIC and mid LH IIIC. Tomb 2, which contained the remains of one primary burial, can be dated to the late LH IIIB2/early LH IIIC period, while its first use can be placed in the LH IIIA-B period. The small horseshoe-shaped tomb 3, which contained two primary burials, was first used in the early LH IIIA1 period. Tomb 4 to the SW, containing two primary burials, can be dated to early and mid LH IIIC. In tomb 5 were located two burial deposits; the upper one included two primary burials, while the lower one included the remains of earlier clearing operations; the tomb was used during the LH IIIA1, IIIA2, and IIIB1 periods. Tomb 6, the southernmost tomb, was provided with a dromos, running E-W, contained only one pri- mary burial, and can be dated to the LH IIIA period. Finally, tomb 7, E of tomb 3, dates from the LH IIIA1 and the early LH IIIC periods. (ADelt 235-7) Nikoleika. Excavations at the Myc cemetery, which has been associated with the town of Myc Elike, yielded three more tombs, the dromoi and roofs of which have been destroyed. (ADelt 240) Patras. In 1996, 84 rescue excavations were conducted in the mod. city of Patras, the vast majority of which involved domes- tic and funerary remains of the R/LR periods. The most com- mon type of site preserved was sections of R roads, provided with drains, and lined with a number of buildings, of domestic or industrial character. In Plateia Omonoias was located a central grav- el road, running N-S, which was investigated for a length of 22m (w. 4.30-4.50m). The road, which had been used from the HL to the R period (five suc- cessive road surfaces, only one belonging to the R period), was provided with central, built drain (w. 1.15m, h. 95cm), into which led smaller drains from the various buildings on either side of the road. On the surface of the road were found fragments of pipes carrying water (one of lead, the others of clay). The most interesting feature of this road is the way it was adapted to the steeply sloping natural ground surface, typical of the S section of the anc. city. On the W side of the road was excavated a build- ing with three rooms, and part of a cistern associat- ed with an atrium. On the E side, the extant building remains belonged to the HL period, and were appar- ently re-used in R times. The resulting complex was large, consisting of many rectangular rooms, which, judging by the three extant kilns, were used for workshop activities (Fig. 70). The kilns, two of which were provided with an ellipsoidal chamber, the third with a circular one, were all used until the LR period. In the latest phase, another building was constructed over this complex, and contained traces of mosaic floors. (ADelt 199-202) Part of another R, stone-paved road, running E- W, with sections of buildings on either side, was dis- covered at the junction of Odos Kanakare and FL-,i - .FT W.,- S ,60!-efr^o^ '-^ ^w- @ r*</page><page sequence="41">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 2001-2002 41 Philopoimenos. The road was laid with rectangular limestone slabs from Astakos, of various sizes, as was the pavement along its S side (w. 1.30m, h. 17cm). To the N of the road were excavated remains of three architectural phases, from the end of the 1St Ct AD to the 4th Ct AD, with wide doorways open- ing on to it. On the S side was found a large stone threshold in situ, along the entire length of which was discovered a channel for sliding wooden door panels, typical of taberae, i.e. shops or workshops facing the road, which confirms the commercial character of this part of the anc. city. (ADelt 217-8) In Odos Lontou was investigated part of a grav- : el road, running N-S, with R/LR building remains on either side, preceded on the E side of the road by traces of earlier occupation, dating from C and HI times. The road, which was traced for a length of 8m, was provided with a built, central drain. On the W side of the road were excavated two rooms laid with mosaic floors, decorated in the geometric manner. One of the mosaics had a central circular scene decorated with marine motifs (fish, sea birds), as well as a central basket full of fish, the whole enclosed within a rectangular frame. Four vases were depicted in the four comers, with vine sprouts and grapes emerging out of one, and two birds approaching another (Fig. 71). The remains cover a long period of time, while the latest elements of the composition date from the 6th Ct AD. In anoth- er plot on the same road, in the general area of the R agora, was investigated part of another gravel road, running E-W. On the N side of the plot were discovered the remains of a Byz build- ing, with a staircase preserving three steps, part of a floor to the W and sections of a drain. The area was apparently still used in the Byz period. (ADelt 207-8) Remains of two rectangular rooms, parts of two R buildings 3.10m apart, were identified in Odos Papadiamantopoulou. Between the buildings was found a built drain, running N-S, possibly implying the presence of a road. (ADelt 228) Part of a gravel road, running N-S, and small parts of two R buildings on either side, were excavated in Plateia Ypsilon Alonion; a central drain ran along the road, while the general area is associated with luxury housing. (ADelt 228-9) Part of another, LR road, running N-S, with sections of a clay drain carrying drinking water, was recorded in Odos Erenstrole. At least three buildings (four excavated rooms), were discovered on either side of the road; in one of the rooms were found traces of a mosaic floor with geometric decoration. (ADelt 220-1) In Odos Messolongiou, E of a small section of a gravel road running N-S, was discovered an important building complex of R date, including two rectangular rooms; S of this complex, an opening led to a chamber with two niches and a slab floor, pos- sibly a bath-house. To its E was found part of a HL cistern. (ADelt 213-14) A small part of another gravel road, running N-S, with R buildings on its S side, was recorded in Odos Gounare. The building remains include part of an atrium with mosaic decora- tion and a large cistern (impluvium) in the centre; a kiln was built over the atrium in later times. E of the atrium was located another room with mosaic floor decoration (geometric motifs). (ADelt 206-7) Part of a stone pavement, possibly a road, running E-W, was discovered in Odos Pantokratoros, while the area was also used in Byz times (two apothetai). (ADelt 209) Remains of isolated R buildings were excavated in a num- ber of plots in the mod. city. In Odos Lontou was discovered part of a LR building, including one whole room and parts of 71. &amp; 72. Patras, Odos Lontou: mosaic floors 1S/y/J/// I '/,///.' r i',;, '' .'/..

One of the smaller rooms was also decorat- ed with a floor mosaic. (ADelt 219) In the same general area was discovered part of another R building, associated with an atrium. N of its exterior wall was found a built drain, suggesting the existence of a road, running E-W; in the W part of the plot was uncovered a rectangular room paved with white and blue marble slabs. (ADelt 208-9) Part of an R building, used in ER and LR times, was record- ed in Odos Charalambe. Three of its walls preserve wall paint- ings bearing geometric designs. In the NE part of the plot was discovered part of a rectangular, shallow cistern, bearing a floor mosaic with geometric decoration (Fig. 73), probably part of an important private building. (ADelt 218) Part of another important R building was located in Odos Tsamadou. The preserved floor was laid partly with rectangu- lar stone slabs and partly with square bricks; on a section of this floor were preserved three small stone piers in situ, probably the supports of wooden posts, related to roofing arrangements. The remains seem to have belonged to a public building, situated near the port, in a commercial area of the anc. city. (ADelt 214-15) Similar, but more fragmentary remains of R buildings were discovered in Odos A.

At the junction of Odos Leukosias and Parodos Leukosias was investigated a partly destroyed pottery kiln. The centre of the firing chamber was occupied by four cylindrical supports of compressed clay, widening upwards, and forming a tholoid roof. The tholos roof of the chamber supported the pierced floor of the upper level of the kiln. The stoking channels were both on the S side, ca 50cm apart. On the floor of the kiln was found a 12cm thick layer consisting of tiles from the collapsed walls, which suggests that the kiln was not provided with a permanent built chamber. The kiln, which was still used in Byz times, was located away from the urban centre of the city, according to the laws prohibiting the establishment of pottery kilns in urban areas, and was also located close to the road to Aigion, which would have facilitated transport of the goods. E of the kiln was found a well. (ADelt 216-7) Remains of a R workshop installation were located in Odos Vlachou. They included part of a floor, laid with rectan- gular clay slabs, part of a drain and a basin-like construction with raised walls; its floor and walls were lined with clay slabs. Two large rectangular areas, the southernmost including part of a large pottery kiln, were discovered near the mod. pavement. (ADelt 206) At the junction of Odos Korinthou and Plateia Georgiou A' the largest part of the plot was occupied by a building com- plex of long use, spanning the 2nd and 3rd Cts AD, including three architectural phases. In the area were discovered traces of a mosaic floor, with a geometric design (Fig. 74), and in the third architectural phase, a small circular construction with built walls and a clay slab floor, possibly a kiln. (ADelt 202-4) Finally, in Odos V. Rouphou, the continuation was uncov- ered of a large bath complex, including part of a chamber with a stone slab floor and of a hypocaust. (ADelt 232) Fragmentary sections of isolated R walls and drains were unearthed in numerous parts of the mod. city, including Odos Eynardou (ADelt 219-220), Odos Marathonos, in Odos Syntagmatarchou Zese, in Odos 120u Syntagmatos, in Odos Kanakare, in Odos Votsare (ADelt 220), in Odos Korinthou (ADelt 220), in Odos A.

Sections of the HL N cemetery of the anc. city were unearthed in a number of plots. In Odos Norman, the remains included part of the known gravel funeral road, running N-S, which was uncov- ered for a total length of 47m, and to its W, part of a funeral chamber, with a cist tomb. (ADelt 231) Part of the same funeral road, running N-S, was revealed in Odos Ag. Sophias, as well as a HL tomb to its E. (ADelt 230) Parts of four rectangular funeral periboloi and scat- tered remains of disturbed tile-roofed and cist tombs were recorded in Odos Satovriandou. (ADelt 222) In Odos Poukevil were located a fragmentary wall, possibly associated with an earlier peribolos, the plot being in the core of the HL cemetery, as well as the cor- ner of a cistern of later date. In the SE part of the plot was exca- vated the passage of a pottery kiln. In Odos Karolou were uncovered two cist-tombs and a marble sarcophagus. Among the finds in one of the cist-tombs were nine triple gold leaves and one pointed leaf, bearing incisions, possibly an inscription, a gold ring with a red stone, two gold ear-rings, and a gold necklace with pearls and one green stone. (ADelt 230) Finally, eight tile-roofed tombs and two cist tombs, all part of the same N cemetery, were recorded in Odos Konstantin- oupoleos. (ADelt 230) Sections of the S cemetery were apparently uncovered in three plots. In Odos S. Vasileiadou a solid retaining wall of R date was used either as a side-wall of a funeral chamber or as a peribolos wall; to the S, other walls were part of funeral cham- bers, with two cist tombs by the southernmost of these walls.

Patras, Odos Korinthou: mosaic floor</page><page sequence="43">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 2001-2002 43 In the same general area a total of 25 tombs was excavated (21 tile-roofed, 4 cist-tombs, 1 ash-ur), the finds including over 50 coloured glass vases. (ADelt 223-4) Finally in Odos Themistokleous were excavated three tile- roofed tombs. (ADelt 230) Sections of the SE cemetery were excavated in two main plots. In Odos Kalavryton was uncovered an important part of the cemetery, used until the Ch era. Sector A of the excavation formed the E limit of the cemetery. In the area in front of Ag. Athanassios church, the latter was apparently built on the remains of a R funeral chamber, containing built cist-tombs; tile-roofed tombs, a peribolos and Ch tombs were also investi- gated in the area. The area in front of the mod. school was apparently organized in rectangular periboloi, oriented N-S, while their interior was divided into smaller areas. The north- ernmost peribolos, which was better preserved, measured ca 10.50 x 8m. Tombs were also found outside the periboloi, iso- lated, or in rows. This year a total of 26 tombs was investigated in this area, including 16 built cists and 10 tile-roofed tombs. This section of the cemetery seems to have been used for work- shop activities in Ch times, judging by three lamp moulds, a mass of clay and a small construction with a floor formed out of a large square slab. In the last area excavated during 1996, part of a large rectangular peribolos was uncovered on a N-S axis, divided internally into four different areas. In this section a total of 17 tombs was excavated, including 6 built cists and 11 tile- roofed tombs. The peribolos was oriented N-S, parallel to Odos Kalavryton, which suggests that the funeral road was probably located under the mod. road. A small pottery kiln was investigated on the SE edge, part of extensive workshop instal- lations in the area. (ADelt 225-7) Another section of the SE cemetery of the anc. city was dis- covered at the junction of Plateia Giannia and Odos Tritou Oreivatikou. The remains included parts of funeral chambers of R date, one of which belonged to a small square funeral building. To its W was investigated one more important funeral building, on a stepped platform (three steps). To the W was probably located the funeral road running parallel to Odos Kalavryton (ADelt 231-2). Finally, isolated tombs of R date were discovered in Odos Niketa (ADelt 220), at the junction of Odos 1201 Syntagmatos and Georgiou iereos (funeral peribolos) (ADelt 221), and at the junction of Odos Korinthou and Plateia Georgiou A' / (ADelt 202-3), the latter including a R funeral building of the 1st Ct AD, with a facade on the W, as well as a group of five tile-roofed tombs and two cists of LR date. Platani. The remains of a tile-roofed tomb were located in an area of great archaeological interest, at the site of Plai, or Remou. (ADelt 234) | Starochori. A tile-roofed tomb without funeral offerings was excavated at the site of Platanos. (ADelt 238) Sychaina. In Odos Meilichou were excavated the remains of a HL and R agricultural installation, including walls and a pottery kiln of the two-storey, circular type, ca 30m S of the mod. bed of the river Meilichos (Fig. 75). Mod. brick workshops still function in the area. The excavated areas included destruction layers and parts of a HL pebble floor, while of the kiln itself is preserved the underground circular firing chamber, coated with clay plaster on the interior. The chamber was provided with two 75. Sycha stoking channels, for the introduction of the fuel, located ca m below its floor surface. The kiln was used for the production of roof-tiles and bricks. In the NW section of the plot was record- ed EH and MH pottery, as well as a PR wall, confirming the occupation of the area during these periods. (ADelt 234-5) Trapeza. The continuation of the surface survey at the archae- ological site of Trapeza, outside the fortified area of the anc. town, revealed the remains of buildings attesting the existence of a lower town. At the site of Gouves, on a natural terrace, a complex of five buildings was identified, three of which were investigated in more detail. The portable finds date the build- ings to the 4th Ct BC. The second site to be located was the site of Ortharia at the E foot of Trapeza. One of the walls located belonged to a 5th-Ct stoa-type building, while the find of a large number of HL figurines suggests that it belonged to a shrine of the lower town. A small pottery kiln of the EByz period indi- cates the change of use of the area. (ADelt 240-1) Tsoukala. The existence of a new archaeological site was estab- lished on the low hills E of the mod. settlements of Tsoukaleika and Vrachneika. Tsoukaleika. On the Achlada hill were identified the remains, mainly pottery and roof-tiles, of the 4th-Ct BC city of anc. Olenos. (ADelt 238) AITOLIA-AKARNANIA Chalkis (Kato Vasiliki). The second season of the systematic excavation in the area of anc. Chalkis, in co-operation with the Danish Institute at Athens (see AR 1996-97, 43), was concen- trated at the site of Pangale on the E slopes of Varasova and on the hill of Ag. Triada, E of the mod. village. At the site of Pangale the continuing surface survey around the site of the N settlement, revealed only the remains of a hearth, a large quan- tity of pottery and many stone and bone tools, dating from the FN period (mid 4th mill. BC). On the Ag.Triada hill, excava- tions unearthed part of the C-HL peribolos, on which the Byz Lina: Hellenistic-Roman site with kiln</page><page sequence="44">44 DAVID BLACKMAN fortifications were founded. The pottery dates from I i the MH period to the Byz era. To the S of the area, within the fortifications, were discovered remains of HL occupation, with pottery from the PR to the HL and ECh periods. (ADelt 242) The 6th EPCA and the Danish Institute conduct- ed the seventh and last excavation campaign in 2001 on the hill of Agia Triada near the village of Kato Vasiliki and the presumed site of Aetolian Chalkis mentioned by Homer and Thucydides. Michalis Petropoulos and Soren Dietz report: 'The site is on the coast with a small alluvial, very fertile valley separating it from the characteris- tic mountain profile of the Trikorfo, and the Arakynthos montains on the far horizon, where the valley borders the Evinos river. The research project at Chalkis aimed at an understanding of the monuments and the function of the small coastal settlement, situated inside and out- side the impressive Byz fortifications, which consti- tute the eye-catching remains of a later period. Several long trenches have documented the exis- tence of systems of concentric terrace walls, and surface cleaning has revealed a longer trajectory of 76. Kaly{ the C wall, probably built as a fortification wall and situated outside the more substantial and much better preserved Byz enceinte. Parts of the older wall were exposed for study in the trenches on the NE side of the hill. The broad terrace below the walls of the C period turned out to be densely occupied. Most impressive were the remains of a HL strip-building sys- tem, of which a large part was excavated, and an A habitation quarter, unfortunately only partly uncovered. The campaign of 2001 concentrated exclusively on the sec- tor to the W of the hill on the alluvial plain, near the shoreline of the ancient bay. Excavations in this sector began in 1997, and slightly more than 100m2 were excavated to bedrock. A sub- stantial wall originally established in the 7th Ct, running in an almost exactly N-S direction, divided the area into two sec- tions. To the W were found three architectural levels of A build- ings covering the time span from the 7th to the end of the 6th Ct. In a lower level the foundations for a huge Myc building-prob- ably LH IIIC in date-were found and, finally, a considerable layer of remains dating to the transitional phase from MH to LH was found immediately on top of the bedrock. Two HL cist tombs were excavated to the E of the A wall in 2000. Publication of the Chalkis project is ongoing. Sanne Houby- Nielsen, Jonas Eiring and Ioannis Moschos have finished the third preliminary report to be published in the forthcoming vol- ume of the Proceedings of the Danish Institute at Athens, and Eiring has finished his manuscript dealing with the large HL tomb: this, the first volume of the final publications, will appear within the next year.' Drymonas Archontochoriou. In the course of excavations at the sanctuary of Artemis Epikrateia, the destruction deposit was removed inside the small temple, while work was then concen- trated in the area of the apothetes, situated at a lower level than the temple. The finds included fragments of clay figurines, small stone statuettes, stone bases of figurines, roof-tiles, many inscribed, and a large quantity of pottery, dating from the 4th Ct BC to the 2nd Ct AD. (ADelt 241) Gavalou. An important find, three pieces of a Doric column shaft of poros, probably part of a public building (temple), were discovered in the vicinity of Trichonion, the most important town of central Aitolia. (ADelt 244) don, Artemis Lauria hill site Kalydon. In 2001 the first campaign on the anc. site of Kalydon was conducted, a joint research project between the Archaeological Society and the Danish Institute with Dr Lazaros Kolonas and Dr Soren Dietz as responsible project leaders. They report: 'The research programme includes surveys and excavations in order to describe and study the urban character of the city of Kalydon and especially the early development of the city struc- tures. Today the city lies ca 5 to 6 km inland from the sea, very close to the river Evinos, on the foothills of the S spurs of the Arakyntos Mountain massif. A geological survey is planned to determine the position of the ancient shore line and hopefully the certain position of Kalydon's harbour(s?). The extraurban sanctuary of Artemis Lauria was excavated in the 1920s and 1930s by a Greek/Danish team with Konstantinos Rhomaios, Frederik Poulsen and Ejnar Dyggve as participants. Work conducted in the city of Kalydon in 2001 included measuring the city wall itself and a part of the visible architec- tural remains inside the wall in combination with traditional surveys and a geomagnetic prospection. In addition, architec- tural remains excavated by previous excavators were cleaned and the conditions of preservation were checked. On the N acropolis the city wall is relatively well preserved. The upper acropolis was cleaned on the surface and architec- tural remains exposed. Excavations are planned for the coming year. The slope below the N acropolis seemed to have been densely inhabited. The geomagnetic survey and traces on the surface indicated the presence of domestic architecture on the S acropolis. In the area inside the W gate of the town-the gate leading to the extraurban sanctuary-an unusual concentration of sherds and tiles was registered. The geomagnetic survey indicated that a narrow road ran along the inside of the wall in antiquity join- ing a system of roads between rather substantial buildings. Finds on the surface indicated that iron and pottery was worked in the area inside the W gate. Between the W wall and the Hero6n of Leonteion, the existence of two large kilns (di. ca 5m) was indicated. Further documentation is needed in this area. The Hero6n itself was cleaned and it was confirmed that this important monument proved to be in almost the same state of</page><page sequence="45">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 2001-2002 45 preservation as found by the previous excavators. On the Sanctuary of Artemis Lauria-which has been covered with scrub and earth since the 1930s-a cautious cleaning was initiated. In connection with the construction of the new National Road in the 1960s a substantial monument, situated on the SE slope of the Artemis Lauria hill, was uncovered. Smaller parts of the monument were excavated by Mr Mastrokostas who con- sidered it to be a bouleuterion. During the Greek/Danish cam- paign in 2001 a more general excavation and careful studies of the construction were initiated (Fig. 76, from the W). The mon- ument consists of square blocks of sandstone creating rows of seats joining in the middle at right angles. The seats are placed in a natural cleft in the soft sandstone rock. Further up, the seats create a rounded curve and the uppermost seats join at obtuse angles. A narrow trench was placed along the lowest rows. About 16m to the E a new row of stones came up at a right angle, indicating that a square area was situated as a termination of the monument. No dating evidence was found during the excavations in 2001. Tiles were not found and the monument was thus hardly covered by a roof. The position outside the city wall furthermore makes it very unlikely that we are dealing with a bouleuterion. Further work is planned for the coming season.' Pappadates. On a steep conical hill, to the SE of the mod. set- tlement, were identified the remains of one of the HL towns of central Aitolia. The acropolis lies on the top of the hill, with vis- ible sections of fortification walls, while the town extended partly onto the N slope of the hill and mainly onto the E side. The cemetery lay to the NE, on flat ground. Part of the fortifi- cations and remains of a building complex of HL date, ran N-S. The stones of the former display vertical grooves on the outer surface, typical of defensive works in central Greece, and pop- ular throughout the 4th-3rd Cts BC. The building complex included a rectangular space, and a stone paved floor to its N, possibly part of an open air area. (ADelt 242-4) Spathare Lepenous. Excavations to the W and the S of the foundations of the A temple yielded a multitude of fragments from the terracotta superstructure of the building. The most important discovery, though, was the identification of one more building, 20m to the SW of the A temple: an apsidal building, with a NE-SW orientation, on the interior of which, and along the walls and the apse, were preserved at least seven bases of columns, possibly wooden. It probably pre-dated the A temple. (ADelt 241-2) Stratos. The systematic excavations of anc. Stratos included the continued investigation of the agora, and especially the area in front of the W stoa, towards its N end, where the foundations of the building were exposed, as well as part of the road lead- ing to the N, outside the agora. In the area in front of the two stoas were discovered the stone bases of many statues in situ. The SE comer of the E stoa was also exposed, as well as part of the stylobate of the building, with the positions of the columns marked, and evidence for the existence of an interior colonnade. In the theatre, the investigation was completed of the W side of the skene building, with the bases of the pillars belonging to the second phase (end of the 3rd Ct BC), as well as the back wall of the building. The excavation of the dromos of the partly destroyed and looted 'Macedonian' tomb, outside the S gate of the fortifications, yielded a multitude of offerings of HL and R date. (ADelt 241) Dr Jari Pakkanen (Finnish Institute) reports on fieldwork in the temple of Zeus: 'The Finnish research group directed by Dr Jari Pakkanen has carried out the second and final season of fieldwork in the sanc- tuary of Zeus in June 2001. The most important aim of the research is to clarify the problems related to the reconstruction of the temple of Zeus by means of building measurements at the site and to make a comparative study of the building more feasible. The research group mapped and measured 120 cella wall and anta blocks. Preliminary statistical analysis gives a reasonably accurate estimate for the building height: after the initial field- work the range of column height could only be given with an error margin of +/- 25cm, but now the range has been reduced to 10% of the initial margin. The peristyle column height can now be restored as 7.88-7.93m. Preparation for the publication of results is continuing; for example, a computer model of the building incorporating the results of the new research is cur- rently being made.' KEPHALLENIA Fiskardo. Part of a R rock-cut workshop installation was iden- tified in a plot by the mod. harbour. The central H-shaped area, which incorporated in its NW corer a circular pit with a rec- tangular depression at its bottom, towards which the floor sloped gently, was possibly related to some kind of press. To the W and S of the H-shaped area were located four channels, lead- ing to it, but not connected to each other. The R settlement lay in the area of Tegania, at the site of the mod. settlement. S of the Platytera monastery the cemetery of the anc. town is being excavated, apparently restricted to the upper classes (monu- mental type of tombs). Along the coast of Ag. Andreas lie the remains of a complex with strong walls, dated to the LR period. (ADelt 248-9) Kontogenada. At the site of Oikopeda, architectural remains of the LH period were unearthed, including parts of circular and elliptical walls, and part of a pebble floor, while the whole area was covered by a thick layer of broken animal and human bones. Of special interest is the find of a stele/sema, similar to one found in the past, as well as a single burial without funeral offerings. (ADelt 249-250) Mazarakata. The excavations of the HL cemetery yielded a total of seven rock-cut pit graves, of impressive architectural form. The tombs were arranged in rows of three, while the first and the last grave of each row were provided with entrances connected with each other, through a rock-cut passage. On either side of the passage were opened small shallow pits, pos- sibly for offerings. (ADelt 249) Pale. At the site of Karavostasi were located the remains of a G settlement, including fragments of pottery and especially those of a large krater, of the last quarter of the 8th Ct BC, an extremely rare occurrence on the island. (ADelt 249) In the context of a surface survey in the W part of the island, in the area of anc. Pale, conducted in co-operation with the Italian School of Archaeology, pottery remains of HL date were located on the hill to the N of the anc. acropolis (Kechrionas site), as well as traces of occupation and burials of various peri- ods, in the vicinity. (ADelt 251) Poros. Drakaina cave. In 1996 the EPS continued excavation of the historical period levels of the sanctuary of the Nymphs; the site was extended with three new squares (A4, E4, F6). Squares A4/E4: a rock, lying on the sterile red scree deposit that sealed the prehistoric levels, occupied a large area within the squares. The deposits surrounding it were examined before the rock was removed.</page><page sequence="46">46 DAVID BLACKMAN To the east of the rock (A4) four stratigraphic units were identified: unit 1 was composed of light brown, fine-grained material with common scree composition, devoid of archaeo- logical remains; the underlying greyish-brown unit 2 was a mixture of transported natural and anthropogenic material, stones, ashes, charcoal, animal bones, and worn sherds from all the periods of use of the sanctuary (6th -3rd Cts BC); unit 3 pre- served the remains of two 6th-Ct pyres with ashes and charcoal, roughly delineated by stones. Fine pottery of Attic, Corinthian, Eleian and possibly other workshops was found in quantity. Drinking vessels-kantharoi, kylikes, skyphoi-and miniature votive skyphoi dominated the assemblage over other shapes. The base of the sequence, unit 4, was the sterile red scree deposit. To the west of the rock (E4) the stratigraphic sequence was similar to that in square A4, with the exception of unit 2, the continuation of the fill which comprised a shallow pit examined in the 1993-1994 seasons. The grey layer was rich in ashes, charcoal, animal bones, and a small quantity of late 4th- early 3rd-Ct pottery, fragmented and worn. Square F6: excavation confirmed the stratigraphic sequence of B6, excavated in 1995. The fine-grained deposit (level 6), referred to as 'working horizon' in the 1995 report, contained quite a few sherds of 6th- early 5th-Ct pottery. In the SW quar- ter of the square, part of a flimsy wall structure with an E-W orientation was exposed. (ADelt 714-15 &amp; fig. 4) Same. At the site of Loutro, in the vicinity of the remains of the C town, four habitation phases were identified, assigned to the R, HL and G-A periods, as well as to the BA. The area was occupied for a long time during the R era; worth mentioning are two circular constructions, probably indicating some kind of workshop activity in this part of the site. In many sectors the R walls were built on their HL counterparts, in the orthogonal pseudo-isodomic system. Associated with the HL levels were remnants of workshop activities, connected with the construc- tion of mosaic floors. The recorded pottery included material from the G (1st half of the 8th Ct BC) and the A periods, as well as from the PR era. (ADelt 244-7) Building remains and extensive destruction layers, dating from the LA to C periods, were uncovered in Odos Dichalion. The area was reoccupied in the R era. (ADelt 247) In the same general area, close to the R harbour of Same, were recorded architectural remains of the R period, possibly port facilities, as well as a stone block decorated with wall paintings (linear, floral motifs).

At the site of Paleochori were found the remains of a R bath-house, including the apsidal wall of a large building, coated with waterproof plaster. (ADelt 185) Kalyvia. Ten built cist-tombs were discovered in the area of the mod. settlement, dating from the LR period. In the same gener- al area were excavated the remains of two walls, one with a stone paved area to its W, the other with three destroyed tombs and funeral pyres to its S, parts of the R cemeteries of Elis. (ADelt 187-8) Kato Samiko. At the site of Drivala were located remains of walls, constructed of medium-sized stones, with a mud-brick superstructure, dating to the MH period, as well as two parts of an inscribed funerary stele. In the same general area were excavated four cist-tombs, on the top of a small hill with a view to the PR and C acropolis of Samikon. Along the country road leading to the hill were locat- ed a number of tile-roofed tombs, and N of them, part of a wall. (ADelt 184-5) Linaria. Remains of a large R clay conduit, part of the Herodes Atticus central aqueduct (AD 160) which brought water to Olympia from the heights of Linaria, were excavated in the area. The aqueduct, which was revealed for a length of 13m, was coated on the inside with waterproof plaster. (ADelt 189) Morea Project. The 1996 season (ADelt 182) was covered in AR 1996-97, 45. Olympia. Research continued in 2001 under the overall direc- tion of H. Kyrieleis (DAI). Excavation was carried out by J. Schilbach and K. Herrmann, who reports: 'Excavations were carried out at two points: at the treasury of Gela a section was dug on the axis of this LA building, from the interior of the earlier main structure through the added entrance hall out to the entrance to the stadium (Fig. 77, showing in the foreground the pebble foundation of the entrance hall). No stratigraphic evidence was found which could have helped to date the parts of the building, since the upper levels had been disturbed by earlier excavations. Under the foundations was found a fill of the 2nd half of the 7th Ct BC, which must be relat- ed to the earliest installations of the stadium, since at this period there were not yet any buildings on the E end of the terrace. At a still greater depth were found loamy levels representing wash from the slope of Kronos Hill and containing remains of Myc vessels, and finally a dark layer with scattered PR sherds. The constructional arrangement of the foun- dation of the entrance hall was surprising, and not previously observed in this form at Olympia. Normally deep foundations consist of massive con-</page><page sequence="47">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 2001-2002 47 tinuous levels of large rubble, but here several layers of medium sized stones alternated with layers of sand ca 10cm thick. This seems to be a specific feature of the builders who worked here. The 4th-Ct Echo colonnade is partly built into the W embankment of the EC stadium III; this %$ embankment in its turn partly covers the track of the \' LA stadium II. A 8 x 5m area was excavated within \ 1 the colonnade (Fig. 78: plan) in order to check whether some holes observed in earlier excavations (1941/42, 1952 and 1975) could be connected with -; the starting- or finishing-line of the earlier stadium. Nearly im under the present surface the level of track II was clearly visible, as was the robbed trench of the finishing-line. In front of this was a row of post-holes, generally ca 20cm in diameter, and sunk ti 30-40cm into the virtually sterile sand. About half TII the width of the track was investigated and 20 such - post-holes were located, lying almost 2m in front of ? the finishing line; they are not precisely in line and the distance between them also varies. Larger irreg- 78. Olym ular depressions, containing two or three post-holes, indicate that the pegs were renewed several times. We are prob- ably dealing with the traces of turning-marks, known from HL installations, or the remains of a starting-device. In front of the back wall of the Echo colonnade, whose foun- dations in places reach down to the stadium track, a 2.50m long wall of rubble and roof-tiles was discovered; it belongs to an already known system of walls, which evidently served to con- solidate the fill of the W embankment of stadium III (see Olympiabericht V, P1. 1). In the earth of the embankment were found several corroded pieces of bronze sheeting, including a greave and a bowl, but only very little pottery of the first 3rd of the 5th Ct. The most important find was the much broken rear part of a terracotta sphinx. Restoration work continued on column N12 of the temple of Zeus, and consolidation of the stylobate. At the Philippeion preparation for a partial reconstruction continued; the search for fits between column drum fragments led to the identification of the parts of three shafts with a h. of 5.60,7m, quite different from the old reconstruction of H. Schleif (h. 6.40,8m). The DAI has made suggestions to the Olympia Ephorate concerning the line of tourist paths around the site, as part of its contribution to a new visitor-friendly layout of the site. The project 'Olympia in the Roman Imperial Period and Late Antiquity' directed by V. Sinn had a study season, prepar- ing the final publications.' Phigaleia. At the site of Trane Petra a HL funeral monument was located in the vicinity of four other tombs, excavated in 1995. Behind the monumental facade of the tomb was identified a sort of chamber, below which were discovered burials in spe- cially formed cists, covered by monolithic slabs and dating from the mid to late 3rd Ct BC, while individual vases date from the 2nd Ct BC. In the open-air ante-chamber before the tomb, where the superstructure of the temple-like facade had col- lapsed, were found a number of architectural members of the tomb. (ADelt 185-6) Pournari. At the site of Rache an early 2nd-Ct AD tile-roofed tomb was discovered, in the general confines of a R cemetery. (ADelt 186) Prasidaki.

Extension of the trenches produced much wooden planking of different species of wood, cannon balls and a wooden pulley- block. (ADelt 725) MESSENIA Ano Englianos. A large number of MH and Myc sherds as well as sections of walls of Myc and R date were discovered at var- ious points along the mod. road between Chora and the Palace of Nestor. (ADelt 189-190) Aristomenes. At Trane Sykia, the remains were excavated of a damaged Myc chamber tomb, aligned N-S, with a sharply inclined dromos and a circular chamber, the entrance blocked by a dry stone wall. On the W side of the chamber was a shal- low pit used as an ossuary, while on the E side of the dromos was found a niche, blocked by a dry stone wall. (ADelt 190) Chalkias. Excavations in the area included work in tholos tomb 1, and especially in the short dromos, which was lined by a retaining wall, as well as in tholos tomb 3, located last year. The latter belongs to the same class of small tholos tombs (di. 4m), and lies N-S; it was apparently looted and disturbed. The entrance was lined with stones, and was blocked by a dry stone wall. The walls of the chamber were preserved to a height of 1.70m, while in the centre of the floor was discovered a deer horn (1. 60cm) and two more horns of goats. There is evidence for more tholos tombs in the general area. (ADelt 191-2) Ellenika Antheias. Ca 400m to the NW of the Myc chamber tomb cemetery was located one more tomb, looted in antiquity, and aligned E-W, with a circular chamber, very disturbed. In the same area were located the remains of a LR cistern. (ADelt 190-1)</page><page sequence="48">48 DAVID BLACKMAN 79. Peristeria: bath complex Oinoe.

The complex extend- ed over three different levels, the lowest of which was excavat- ed this year, including four working areas. The best-preserved building, probably a frigidarium, is rectangular, with a niche on three of its sides. On the interior the walls were lined with grey- green and reddish marble, while the floor was laid with large square clay slabs. In the SE comer was found part of a clay pipe for evacuating the water. This building communicated with another rectangular space, with a tile floor, which was later floored with marble slabs, while its walls were lined with mar- ble. The third room, S of the first two, preserved the entrance to the baths. E of these buildings lay the caldarium, of which only the subterranean heated floor was preserved. It was divided into three smaller rooms, and the floor was constructed of large clay slabs, on which were placed small clay piers in rows; on the lat- ter lay large rectangular bricks, forming the floor of the rooms above. Outside the first building were identified two semicircu- lar bathtubs, with waterproof plaster on the interior. (ADelt 191) Pylos. Work continued in 1996 on the restoration of the Neokastro fortress, especially the NE Bastion. (ADelt 737) Pylos Regional Archaeological Project. The 1996 season (ADelt 195-6) was covered in AR 1996-97, 51. Prof. Jack L. Davis (ASCS) reports on the 11th season of 2001: 'Reorganization of the Blegen finds is now almost complete. Sharon Stocker and Jack Davis examined ceramics from deposits excavated by Blegen, from which the bones currently being examined by Paul Halstead and Valasia Isaakidou were retained. Their aim was to clarify the dates and contextual asso- ciations of each of these, in preparation for a full publication of the faunal remains from the Palace of Nestor. Six groups of burnt bone analyses displayed greater or lesser heterogeneity in the colour and texture of bone, suggesting exposure to a range of temperatures (as perhaps between the core and periphery of an open fire). Many of the bones bear clear traces of knife marks consistent with either dismembering or filleting, suggesting that some of the material, at least, had been stripped of meat before burning. In most cases, traces of earth matrix plainly adhered directly to the external bone surface and close examination found no intervening charred organic matter (except in a few cases where two or more bones had fused during burning). It is inferred, therefore, that most, and probably all, of the bones had been stripped of meat before burning. The burnt bone is (almost) exclusively of cattle and high- ly selective in terms of anatomical composition: humerus, femur and mandible (with rare fragments). The deliberate burning of defleshed bones, followed by apparently careful redeposition elsewhere, sug- gests important ritual acts and interpretation in terms of burnt animal sacrifice would be tempting even without the later Homeric accounts of burnt offer- ings to the gods of thigh bones wrapped in fat. Analysis of the human skeletal material from the Palace of Nestor and associated chamber and tholos tombs by Lynne Schepartz continues. The analysis of Tsakalis tomb E-6 is fin- ished. Results differ considerably from those reported in the primary publication of the tomb. The tomb appears to have con- tained a minimum of 5 children, 6 adult females, 6 adult males and two other adults, with the oldest individuals probably dying before age 40. Most of the individuals were healthy. There was no evidence for osteoarthritis or other age-related changes. Two or three of the adult cranial vaults had expansion of the diploe that may be associated with anemia (although other bone changes characteristic of anemias such as vault porosity and criba orbitalia were not present), while other individuals have thickened compact bone in some areas of the vault. Many indi- viduals have numerous caries and premortem loss of molars from these infections. Dental hypoplasia, a sign of childhood disease or dietary stress, is commonly seen on both males and females. Substantial progress was made by Hariclia Brekoulaki and her team in reorganizing the storage of fresco fragments, prior to a full examination and study of the technological aspects of Mycenaean painting at the Palace of Nestor. Finally, a considerable number of samples of wood from the Palace of Nestor were transferred to Athens from Hora. They will be transported from there to the United States for 14-C dat- ing in a program of analysis coordinated with Peter Kuniholm at Corell University.' Pyrgos Triphylias. A R cist-tomb and scattered architectural remains of buildings, probably of R date, were located in the area. At the site of Tsouka was found an intact MH Minyan kantharos, near a large destroyed tumulus of the same date. (ADelt 189) Byz churches identified include: Agios Nikolaos at Bournazi, a small cruciform church, much changed over time, but with remnants of original sculptured and painted decoration (14th Ct AD). At Pedema, the church of Agia Kyriake (late 13th-early 14th Ct AD) has remains of contemporary wall-paintings. The church is of Orlandos Al category, with transverse pitched roof instead of a dome. LByz wall-paintings are reported in the church of Agios Theodoros at Sterna. At Strephi, the church of the Panagia on the Chrysophoras plot is identified as being MByz with l9th-Ct AD additions. A LByz two-storey tower is men- tioned at Diodia, on the Palaiopyrgos site. (ADelt 163)</page><page sequence="49">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 2001-2002 49 KERKYRA AND THESPROTIA Kerkyra Garitsa. In Odos Alkinoou architectural remains were located, probably associated with harbour installations. In the SW part of the plot a rectangu- lar structure was identified, while in the S sector were found the bases of four limestone piers, possi- bly supporting wooden shafts, probably for the roof- ing of shipsheds for small boats. More pier bases and part of a stone drain were discovered in Odos Theodorou Desylla, while the pottery collected dates from the last quarter of the 5th to the start of the 3rd Ct BC. (ADelt 412-13) , ' Kanoni. Various architectural remains were excavated in the Argyrou plot, including sections of two walls, part of two drains and a well, while the pottery recorded testifies to the use of the area from the LA to the HL period. (ADelt 407-9) In the Mazarake plot were located sections of two buildings, used from the LA to the HL period (Fig. 80). During the latter the A buildings were 80. Kerk: destroyed, and the building material was re-used in later construction phases. The building constructed over build- ing A was typical of the HL period, with a court, floored with crushed and trodden roof-tiles, and a well in the middle. Five rooms were identified to the N and S of the court. Building B was also re-used, after considerable modifications, and consist- ed of three roofed areas. The stratigraphical evidence suggests the existence of three phases in the area: an A/LA phase associ- ated with one wall and a stone pavement; a LC/EHL phase, dur- ing which was constructed a house with a peristyle paved court; and a M-LHL phase, during which the peristyle court was destroyed, while its paved floor was covered with a pebble sur- face, and the house was extended to the NE. The well was opened during the A period, and was used throughout. Among the finds were 146 coins, mostly Corcyrean but also Sicilian and Apulian, dating from 300-229 BC and 229-48 BC, as well as A, C and HL figurines. The two HL buildings lay on the isodomic-style krepis of an A building of public character and retained the public character (roof-tile inscribed: A (AAMO- XIOE)); they were part of the urban grid of the anc. city, and were provided with a drain. The house with the peristyle court and the one to its S, were probably the residence and the office of a public official, involved with commercial transactions (Agoranomos?). (ADelt 409-12) Kerkyra town. Palaiopole. The systematic excavation of the Kasphike and Kateche plots, which had been taking place in collaboration with Prof. T. Hackens from the University of Louvain la Neuve, and Prof. R. Winkens from Brown University, continued for an eighth year in 1996. In the W and NW part of the Kasphike plot, the area outside the baths was investigated, especially to the W of room 10, and to the NW of room 8, where were located fragments from the vertical heating system of the walls, and a number of walls. To the NW of drain 1 outside room 8, the finds were mostly R in date (2nd-3rd Ct AD). In the area surrounding the baths were recorded a HL wall and marble architectural members, as well as bronze coins of the 4th-7th Cts AD. Finally, in the NE comer inside room 4, pot- tery of HL and R date was found immediately below the floor; in deeper levels were recorded finds of A date. (ADelt 404-6). In the NNE part of the Kateche plot part of the stone slab pavement of the anc. agora was uncovered, including two mosaic floors. The semi-circular mosaic floor was decorated with two peacocks facing each other across a large amphora, as yra, Kanoni: Mazarake plot site well as smaller birds and anthemia, in white, black, blue and red colours. The second mosaic, of rectangular shape, had stylized animals, fish, birds and plants. Many more sections of mosaic floors were discovered, often face down, in various areas and depths of the plot. In the central sector part of a small pottery kiln was recorded, as well as various pottery finds, including African style bowls dating from the 2nd-6th Cts AD. In the NW part of the plot was unearthed a section of a stoa, running SW-NE (preserved 1. 21m, w. 7m). The stylobate of the facade supported an Ionic colonnade, of which only one column was preserved; the columns rested on almost square stone bases, four of which were found. The column bases were con- nected with each other by a wall faced on both sides. In the NW part of the facade was preserved a semi-circular base, while to the SE of the stoa lay part of a semi-circular R building, with a monument to its SE. 1m E of the latter, was found a poros metope carved with a 16-leafed rosette in relief. The pottery dated from the R and the LR period. (ADelt 406-7) Thesprotia Work carried out in the course of the construction of Egnatia Odos in 1996 brought to light a variety of archaeological fea- tures in various locations. In the area of Vasiliko was excavat- ed part of a pottery kiln, used for the production of roof tiles. At the site of Stenes were recorded the remains of five walls, of HL-R date, while scattered in the area were discovered flakes and manufacturing debris of tool types of the EBA period. In the same area were located flakes of the EBA as well as two scrapers on a long blade, one side scraper on a flake, two chis- els, one worn, and flakes of the MPal period. In the vicinity were also recorded part of another pottery kiln (pear-shaped, two-storey), used during the HL and R periods, as well as four burials of HL date (one cist-tomb, two pot-burials, one pit- grave). Gitane. The stoa on the N side of the anc. agora was preserved for a length of 76m and a width of 11.20m (Fig. 81). It was con- structed of local stone, in the polygonal masonry style. It con- sisted of an interior colonnade of 14 Ionic columns, with their bases, and an exterior colonnade of 26 Doric columns, of which only six were preserved. The interior wall of the stoa and the columns of both colonnades were coated with white plaster. The stylobate consisted of slabs placed over a substructure of large ?_ ?~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</page><page sequence="50">50 DAVID BLACKMAN 81. Gitane, N side of agora: stoa blocks. In front of the facade were identified a semi-circular base for an exedra or thronos, two square, three rectangular and six cylindrical bases, supporting votives. Along the toichobate of the stoa and the two side walls was located a solid bench of local limestone. Among the finds were 250 coins of the Epirote League (234/3-168/7 BC), dating the destruction of the build- ing to the years after the end of the Third Macedonian War, as well as bronze and iron tools of the late 3rd-early 2nd Ct BC, jewellery with parallels in the Balkans and W Greece, and the head of a clay statue. Typologically the stoa, with side walls continuing for a short distance along the facade, belongs to the type current in NW Greece during the HL period. (ADelt 414-16) Outside the walls of the anc. city were investigated four tombs, two cists, one pithos burial and one pot burial, dated to the 3rd Ct BC. (ADelt 416-17) Ladochori. In the area of the mod. village were excavated fragmentary architectural remains of three building phases, including a stone-paved floor and two rooms in the earliest phase (2nd-4th Ct AD), the addition of two more rooms and a wall in the second phase (mid 3rd-5th Ct AD), while to the lat- est phase (6th Ct AD) belonged a road and a stone-paved area in the NE comer of the plot. (ADelt 417-19) BOIOTIA Akraiphnion. The rescue excavations in part of the cemetery, to the SW of anc. Akraiphnia on either side of the national road from Athens to Lamia, were continued in 1996. One row of tombs on the N side of the national road consisted of 62 inhu- mations and 6 cremations in situ; 14 of those were child-buri- als. The majority of the tombs were deep stepped pit-graves (Fig. 82), covered by stone slabs, followed by simple pit- graves, pot burials, tile-roofed tombs and a few cists. The tombs, which were not arranged in any order, occupied every available space in the cemetery. Common features of the A pit- graves for adults included the deep shaft, usually filled with yel- low sandy soil, the main burial place at the bottom of the shaft, and the four to eight cover slabs, at a level below the mouth of the tomb. Among the finds was an amphoriskos by the Polos painter. The (mostly HL) simple pit-graves usually contained few vases, while the cists and the tile-roofed tombs dated most- ly from the 4th Ct BC and the HL period. Child-burials were much rarer in the A row of tombs than in the rows of C date. Finally, one category of funeral structures resembling stone- piles, constructed of successive irregular rows of stones, dated from the G period. Amongst the graves were found shallow cir- cular wells, probably associated with the drainage of the rain water. The second row of tombs consisted of 15 inhumations, 10 of which belonged to children, and 13 cremations. It dates mostly from the period between the 5th and the 3rd Cts BC. The major- ity consisted of tile-roofed child-burials, followed by simple pits and cists. The cremations were typical of the usual local version, i.e. a rectangular pit provided with steps and with a long channel down its middle, functioning as an air-shaft. The remains of iron nails suggest the existence of some kind of funeral bier, placed on the top of the wooden frame. Carbonized remains of figs and almonds on the surface of the pyres proba- bly represent offerings made during the funeral rites, especially just before the pyre was covered with earth. The third row of tombs consisted of 16 inhumations and three primary cremations; only two were child-burials. The types included A deep pit-graves, simple pits, a few tile-roofed tombs and cist graves, mostly of HL date. Among the finds was a rf crater of the Athens painter (mid-4th Ct BC). Finally, by the 82. Akraiphnion, cemetery: stepped pit graves</page><page sequence="51">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 2001-2002 51 building were excavated three multiple burials in tile-roofed tombs, of LR-ECh date. (ADelt 272-5) On the S side of the national road, a considerable number of burials was excavated, among which were three adult pot- burials in a stepped shaft, an unused pit-grave, two stone piles containing burials which dated from the LG period, a child cist- grave, a pot-burial of A date, a late 4th-Ct BC stone pile with burials, a pit-grave (child burial) with a long and narrow chan- nel to its SE, filled with yellow soil, containing animal bones and sherds, possibly an offering ditch, a phenomenon common from the LG to the A periods, as well as an A apothetes and a well, later used as a rubbish pit. In the S part of the exit of the Akraiphnion junction, at the junction with the road to Aliartos, building remains were recorded of the G period, mostly walls. (ADelt 275-8) Chaironeia. Architectural remains of the R period were uncov- ered in the mod. town. (ADelt 278-9) Dauleia. In the course of an extensive surface survey in the area E and SE of the acropolis of the anc. Phocian city of Daulis, the sites were re-identified of anc. Phokikon, of the koinon of the Phocians, and of the shrine of the hero archegetes, as well as scattered tombs at the site of Kephalovryso, dating from late antiquity. (ADelt 284-5) Daulose-Medeon. Investigations in the looted Myc chamber tomb cemetery at the foot of Sphingeion yielded the remains of a strong retaining wall, facing the stream and possibly connect- ed with the PR works in the gulf of Daulose. Excavations on the pre-Myc acropolis of Megalo Kastraki hill yielded an empty cist tomb and part of a MH peribolos, surrounding the settle- ment. In the same general area were also discovered three archaeological levels, including two child burials (cists), part of the foundations of a large MH building, and a steatite cylinder- seal with incised linear motifs in columns, similar to analogous EM or MM examples. To the N was discovered a stone pile with two ellipsoidal disturbances. (ADelt 270-2) Delesi. Part of a large rectangular R kiln (firing chamber and eschara) was excavated in Odos Odysseos. The chamber was oriented E-W, while the bricks of the interior walls had under- gone colour and shape alterations, due to the high temperatures reached. The floor, which lay 60cm below ground level, was made of clay and bore intense traces of burning. Judging by the mode of construction, it seems that the kiln also possessed a permanent second floor. The kiln was probably part of an important brick-making workshop, with an intensive produc- tion geared to cover the needs not only of Delion, but of other areas also. Its location, in the vicinity of a harbour, suggests that the trade was also conducted by sea. R walls and part of a tile floor were recorded just before the junction of Odos Odysseos and Odos Priamou. In front of the OTE plot, where a R work- shop complex with shops had been excavated in the past, 22 sections of walls were now exposed, running N-S. (ADelt 279-82) In the square of the mod. town were unearthed six marble larakes/baths and a circular construction of poros, which sug- gest the existence of a public bath-house in the area, while var- ious other rooms to its N, E and S, were probably part of the same complex. (ADelt 282-4) An anc. breakwater is threatened by illegal mod. harbour construction. The EMA planned the submerged E part of a HL stoa, the W part of which had been investigated in 1982-3 in a rescue excavation of the 8th EPCA. (ADelt 735) Kopais. Cave churches are reported in the Kopais region. These include the churches of Agios Vlasios or Zoodochos Pege, Agios Nikolaos and Agia Trite, all of which have layers of painted decoration, the uppermost dating to the 17th Ct AD, with dated inscriptions from earlier periods (1333), and a layer dated to the 13th Ct AD. (ADelt 73-4) Neochoraki. Two tombs, a pot-burial of A date and a C crema- tion were located ca 2km W of the mod. village. Between the two were identified sporadic offerings of pots and figurines. (ADelt 284) Orchomenos. 28 marble members, some from the original tem- plon screen of the Skripou church, were identified and cleaned in the walls of vaulted cells of the monastery of the same name. (ADelt 74) Plataiai. A. Konecny (Austrian Institute) reports on the 2001 campaign: 'For several reasons the campaign of 2001 was dedicated to the processing of material retrieved during previous excava- tions at Plataiai. This led to a better understanding of the strati- graphic sequence excavated until now and of the site's settle- ment sequence than hitherto achieved. The ceramic sequence starts as early as the LN or FN. EH, especially EH II, is abundant, whereas EH III could not yet be identified. MH occurs in good quality, as well as LH. Pottery from the Greek DA, i.e. PG, G and SG, confirms a continuation of settlement activities during the EIA. There seem even to be some SMyc sherds present. Several consecutive floors have yielded stratified A material which included a range of whole shapes. These vessels were of local, Cor, and probably also Attic origin. Later strata have fallen victim to terracing activi- ties during the middle ages. HL, R and Byz pottery was never- theless present in considerable quantities. The accumulated data provide the final proof of a settlement continuity spanning approximately five millennia. The material from the W gate contained, as anticipated, pre- dominantly miniature vessels, which were most probably of local origin. They date from the first decades of the 4th Ct BC. A few, but significant, pieces can however be assigned to the decades around 330 BC. They came from the fill which consti- tuted the first floor of the courtyard inside the gate. This evi- dence firmly dates the construction of the gate to the era of Philip II and/or Alexander the Great and confirms the historical testimony of Arrian, Plutarch and Pausanias. During the forthcoming campaign priority will be given to extending the trial trenches on the acropolis with the aim of sub- stantiating the data concerning the long settlement history of Plataiai.' Sarakino cave. A. Sampson reports on the 1996 excavation season by the EPS. In trench A, LN I levels were reached. A sequence was established of superimposed layers of occupation and hearths across the trench. Finds were rich in decorated pot- tery of LN I and LN II. Trench A yielded a number of clay and marble figurines, bone tools, and pendants. Large quantities of carbonized seeds were recovered by flotation, while samples for charcoal and pollen analyses were collected. (ADelt 714) Tanagra. J. Bintliff (Netherlands Institute) reports on the 2001 season: 'A team from Leiden University under the direction of Prof. John Bintliff, together with Greek colleagues (K. Sbonias, K. Sarri) and a small team from the University of Ljubljana under the direction of Prof. B. Slapsak, undertook a second season of</page><page sequence="52">52 DAVID BLACKMAN surface survey in the city of Tanagra and in its immediate rural surroundings. The first season at Tanagra, in summer 2000, has seen a detailed preliminary report published in Pharos 8 (2000) 93-127. It is intended that each season will produce a similar report for Pharos. In the 2001 season, within the city walls, around one third of the surface was systematically planned topographically using a total station (directed by L. Sigalos and E. Farinetti), with care- ful note being taken of the location of all wall lines and archi- tectural fragments. In conjunction with the results of geo- prospection, carried out by Ljubljana specialists led by B. Music, the plan of the city blocks and roads is gradually being elucidated, to compare with the differential spreads of ceramic surface finds of various occupation phases of the town. These different kinds of spatial information are being linked together by E. Farinetti using a GIS. So far in two seasons two-thirds of the city surface have been analysed, with the overall impression being that PR activ- ity is widespread from N times to the Myc period (study by K. Sarri). However, the virtual absence of LH III finds from the town makes it very unlikely that Tanagra was a major Myc set- tlement, thus ruling out the equation made by some of its site with Homeric Graia. Likewise very weakly represented in the urban surface finds are DA and EA sherds (study by V. Stissi), suggesting a late foundation of the town, at least in its current location. C and LR finds are abundant from all areas so far stud- ied, but there are some indications of a reduction in activity dur- ing LHL and ER times-not predicted from the anc. sources but compatible with previous research at other Boeotian urban sites such as Thespiae and Hyettos. Med activity is extremely rare and no evidence yet has been found to suggest occupation in the urban area in Byz times. But a major discovery of 2001 was a group of four linked longhouses on the acropolis hill, of tradi- tional Boeotian domestic type, associated with ceramics of the MOtt period-a small hamlet, perhaps a ciftlik, lay at the heart of the anc. city in the 16th-18th Cts (preliminary dating by J. Vroom). In the survey of the adjacent countryside, numerous small cemetery scatters of C date could be added to those discovered in 2000, and these are both as expected immediately outside the city walls and along likely anc. roads out from the city to neigh- bouring towns, but also widely scattered across the entire coun- tryside; most seem family cemeteries. C rural settlement, how- ever, only appears at some distance from the city-with two farms being observed at an identical distance of 1700m out from the town walls in a W and N direction. This signifies that the closer parts of the ancient chora were farmed directly by urban residents, who were also then responsible for the extraor- dinary density of 'offsite' pottery-a continuous carpet of worn potsherds primarily of C date extending from the edge of the city up to the point where the first farms appear (average densi- ty being 12000 sherds per hectare or more than 1 sherd per metre square). The 'offsite' carpet is due to urban manuring using city rubbish, in order to improve crop fertility in the inten- sively cultivated inner chora. Closer to the city we found as in 2000 more evidence for R rural settlement. The large villa discovered in summer 2000, almost lkm from the town to the W, was gridded and found to be over 2.5 ha in size, but also in the N field transect two further R villas were found at a similar distance, close to each other, and 0.75 and 1.5 ha in size. The W villa had fine carved stone pillars in stone piles within its area, which were matched by equally impressive signs of wealth at the new N villas of 2001-between them providing surface finds such as mosaic tesserae, wall- painting fragments and much recycled C grave architecture. The change of land-ownership in country residents from small family farms in C times to wealthier villa landlords in R times seems clearly marked in these sites. Immediately around the edge of the city walls for several hundred metres, the density of surface finds is especially high, almost at urban levels. Some small areas with high quality C pottery were identified within this zone and raised the question of sanctuary or cemetery origin. V. Stissi provisionally suggests that the types present are more plausibly seen as burial assem- blages rather than those from shrines. This has a wider signifi- cance, because the high level of surface pottery in the immedi- ate extramural zone could also have been suggesting domestic suburbs outside the defence walls. Since we now seem to have graves on most sides of the walls, then this has to be rejected, with the conclusion being that domestic occupation was con- fined within the 4th-Ct BC surviving enceinte. We interpret the dense extramural ring of pottery as indicating a number of dis- crete burial zones, and more diffuse areas of industrial and craft activity and especially market gardens. Only in the E rural tran- sect of 2000 are there still possible signs of extramural domes- tic buildings near the walls, some distance from the nearest cemeteries. The important Med settlement discovered in 2000 around the MByz church of Agios Thomas some 1 km E of the city was gridded and analysed, proving to be a village site of some size of the ltl13th Cts AD. The Ephor of Byz Antiquities, Mrs Chilakou, provided us with the vital information that the church of Agios Thomas had been converted into a Frankish feudal tower with chapel in the 13th Ct, giving us another Boeotian example of a Byz village taken into close control by the incom- ing Frankish minor lords at this time (for a similar situation in the Valley of the Muses and the village of Askra see BSA 93, 1998).' Thebes. In 1996, eight rescue excavations were conducted in the mod. town, mostly of PR interest. Investigations in the plot of the archaeological museum resulted in a number of inter- esting observations: the thick layer of mud-bricks in the N sec- tor rested mostly on a stone base, which has been attested throughout the plot. The recorded dimensions of the mud-bricks varied (40 x 20cm, 44 x 24cm, 52 x 26cm, 50 x 19cm). This mud-brick terrace, if indeed artificial and not the result of a col- lapse of buildings, was built from the N, and was disturbed by the insertion of MH burials and tombs of the early LH period (three child burials, two pit-graves, some pithos burials, three built mud-brick tombs, and some rock-cut tombs); it also cov- ered EH domestic remains and sections of fortifications. In the same area were also located scanty remains of the Myc fortifi- cations of Kadmeia, built in the typical Myc style towards the end of LH IIIA2/beginning of LH IIIB 1, and destroyed towards the end of LH IIIB2 (end of the 13th Ct BC). (ADelt 259-61) Sieving operations in a collapsed part of the Kadmeion, the 'treasury', apart from the usual finds of burnt mud-brick and fragments of carbonized wood, yielded four clay sealings, three of which bore Linear B inscriptions, and a glass-paste seal, in the same area where the 1963-4 excavations had resulted in the discovery of Linear B texts, oriental cylinder seals, much gold and stone jewellery, as well as large quantities of lapis lazuli, all of which contradict the theory of an oriental origin of the first settlers of the Kadmeia. The first of the inscribed sealings bore the impression of an almond-shaped seal, depicting a bull- leaper as he jumps over the animal, and bearing an inscription which included the word o-pa and the ideogram for leather, pos- sibly an administrative act related to the transport of leather goods, at a specific stage of manufacture. Similar were the con- tents of sealing No 3, with the ideogram of the goat incised on the representation of a bull and a lion. The inscription on seal-</page><page sequence="53">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 2001-2002 53 ing No 2 extended over the whole sealed surface, the design on which is not clear. The inscribed word e-pi-*19-ta, is not com- mon and occurs only on the Pylian text Vnl0,2 &amp; 5, recording materials and parts for the making of chariots. On sealing No 4 was represented a male figure between two agrimia (potnios theron?). Finally, the only seal found in the excavation depicted a goat or some other big animal walking towards the left. Near the end of the season, in a trench opened to the W of the 'treas- ury', was discovered almost half of a page-shaped Linear B tablet, in the Myc destruction layer, near the floor. The text refers to a number of otherwise unattested names, receiving small quantities of an unknown product. (ADelt 262-4) Fragmentary architectural remains of the Byz, Myc (LH IIIB2), MH and EH periods, were identified in Odos Pelopidou. The EH level, thick and mostly undisturbed, yielded a multitude of small finds, as well as architectural remains belonging to at least two construction phases. Of the most recent phase were located three successive rectangular rooms, with a mud-brick superstructure. The earlier phase consisted of remains of build- ings or isolated walls, and small bothroi. (ADelt 264-5) Pottery and architectural remains of the Myc period were uncovered at the junction of Odos Ag. Apostolon and Kadmou, mostly sections of walls extending N, under the mod. houses. Of the portable finds, the most important was part of a leaf-shaped Linear B tablet (Fig. 83), with a single word (me- to-re-ja-de). The discovery of this tablet confirms the wide dis- tribution of the Theban archives over the extensive acropolis; this represents the northernmost findspot, in a general area probably allocated to workshop activities, perhaps pottery workshops, and overlooked by the palace. Other finds include pottery, lead sheets, obsidian fragments and fresco fragments. (ADelt 266-7) At the junction of the country road connecting Thebes and Mouriki, and the railway line, at the site of Kokkala, were recorded six ECh tile-roofed tombs, the foundation of a HL funeral peribolos, part of a LR stone-paved road running N-S, and finally two intact and parts of 11 fragmentary funerary ste- lae of the C and HL periods (5th-2nd Cts BC). (ADelt 267-9) At the junction of Odos Amphionos and Oidipodos, on the SE side of the Kadmeia hill, were unearthed fragmentary archi- tectural remains of the R, LR and ECh periods, including sec- tions of walls, and part of a clay R water-pipe, running N-S for a length of 12.50m; part of a LR wall was recorded in Odos Antigones. (ADelt 269-70) Excavation work by the 1st EBA continued within the town. (ADelt 76-86) Investigations in 12 Odos Teiresiou and Odos G. Diamanti provided more evidence for continuous habitation from the 9th to 13th Cts AD. Coin finds here include copper folleis and tetartera dating from Basil I (d. 886) to Isaac II Angelos (ca 1190). (ADelt 85) Pottery included a frying-pan-shaped vessel made of hard red clay, belonging to the 9th-10th Ct AD phase. Other frag- ments of pottery (including a fine inscribed askodabla, end llth/early 12th Ct AD) were found along with bone pins and fibulae, bone and stone buttons, drills for stone-working, clay loom weights, an iron key, inscribed and embossed bone handle with traces of painting. The stone cooking vessels proved the most interesting, however, in the variety of type and size and in the stone used, a greenish pietra ollare which originates in the valleys of the Alpine range. Similar vessels have been found in N. Italy (Brescia) in early Med contexts. On Odos Vamali and Odos Ekaste. (Nea Theba, E of the Kadmeia), a vaulted tomb was found partly built into the bedrock (3 x 1.53 x 1.83m). Two steps of the descending stair- way were uncovered. Eleven burials were identified, including two almost complete and undisturbed skeletons. These were 83. Thebes: Linear B tablet accompanied by coins of 1070-5, and later tetartera of Manuel I (d. 1180). Evidence of a water supply system was found else- where on the plot, including a well (coins of 1050-60) and two reservoirs. Part of a much earlier (C?) water system was also uncovered. Other coins dated to 1050-60 and to the Komnenoi, up to 1143, were found on the site. (ADelt 85-6) Pottery included cooking ware and water vessels, but also table ware, including a fine monochrome stamnion with paint- ed and inscribed decoration (11th to 13th Cts AD). Especially interesting was a lead seal of the bishop of Athens, Michael Choniates (before 1204), with a bust of the Virgin and Child, and inscription (ADelt 86). Work in an around the church of Agios Gregorios Theologos continued in the area W of the narthex, and the burials found S of the nave and narthex. The narthex, once interpreted as being contemporary with the church and designated for funerary pur- pose, is now shown to be a later construction. Coins and pottery of the mid- lth to 13th Cts AD were found. Also, in a pit were found one anc. and two 13t-14th Ct AD Frankish coins in poor condition, and iron knives, pottery and glass fragments, animal and fish bones, and another fine askodabla with inscribed and embossed decoration, and glazed cups, mostly monochrome. Burials to the S, including a large marble sarcophagus and cist graves, had been briefly examined by Soteriou (AE 1924), and are now being re-investigated. Part of an ECh mosaic floor was uncovered on Odos Pindarou and Odos Antigones (border of double, interlinking, tendril motif). Unfortunately, the mosaic was damaged when disturbed by unauthorized persons, but visual records and pho- tographs were made. Rescue excavationsduring municipal sewer construction works uncovered walls and architectural fragments of the 10th-11th Ct AD, including possible fragments from a church (ambo, impost capital, octagonal colonnette). An inscription of uncertain date was found on one plaque (reproduced in ADelt 84). EUBOEA Agiokambos. Remains of EH occupation were located on Vigla hill, 2km W of the village on the shore.

Sections of isolated walls were recorded in Odos Naupliou and at the junction of Odos Agapes and Styron. Finally, a marble statuette of a naked boy bearing an animal on his shoulders, as well as a mar- ble base of the Ionic order, were discovered in Odos Mones Erion. Two HL tile-roofed tombs and a monolithic stone sarcophagus were recorded in the area of Chalkis-N. Artake-Psachna. (ADelt 287-8) Eretria. Part of the W sector of the LHL fortifica- tions lying directly on the bedrock, and preserved for a length of 12.70m (w. 2.70m, h.50-70cm), was excavated at the junction of the road to Toumba and the Z. Malakonda settlement. The masonry was of inferior quality, while E of the wall was discovered part of a rectangular well built construction of the 4th Ct BC. (ADelt 300-1) At the site of Ambeliones was uncovered part of an extensive 4th-Ct BC cemetery, including 36 buri- als, mostly disturbed. The tombs were either clay cists, tile-roofed graves, or pits/pyres. In the Voure plot, part of an anc. road was discovered and a 4th- Ct BC building. (ADelt 301) A number of tile-roofed tombs were excavated at the foot of hills located to the N of the mod. road \(row of seven tombs, close to each other, without funeral offerings). Near the mod. cemetery of the Plaka settlement another group of tombs was dis- covered, while part of a mosaic floor was unearthed at the junction of Odos Sokratous Agathonos, and Apollonos Daphnephorou. A row of four tile- roofed tombs was recorded on the W slope of the ,' ?~ , acropolis hill. (ADelt 301-3) Sections of HL walls and part of a 4th-Ct BC building were excavated in Odos Amarysias Artemidos, probably related to the anc. harbour. To the N of this building was found an apsidal structure of G date. (ADelt 3034) Remains of HL houses and part of an anc. road were recorded in a plot behind the anc. tholos, while in the area between the anc. gymnasium and the theatre, sections of 12 walls and various portable finds were excavated. (ADelt 304) The 1996 season of the Swiss School in Eretria (ADelt 309-10) was covered in AR 1996-97, 53-6. Stephan Schmid reports on the activities of the School in 2001: 'The Swiss School carried out its fourth consecutive excava- tion season in the area of the temple of Apollo Daphnephoros under the direction of S. Verdan (Univ. of Lausanne). Several trenches were opened to the S and W of the temple, mainly in order to complete the picture of the area's occupation during the LG period (8th Ct BC). Further, some small soundings inside the LA temple will hopefully allow us to draw a more concise pic- ture about the chronology of the different building phases. The four seasons of excavation contributed considerably towards a better understanding of the spatial organisation of the G settlement. One distinctive feature is a series of long walls, such as M3 and M2 (Figs. 84-85), apparently separating differ- ent zones from each other. Most probably their function was a double one. On the one hand, they were used in order to define properties, as is the case in a similar settlement of the G period in Oropos, on the opposite Boeotian coast. On the other hand, these walls apparently were built to protect the built up zones from regular inundations. This is attested by the fact that 'out- side' the walls clearly alluvial layers alternate with thin layers containing few and small sherds, most probably the result of seasonal dry periods (Fig. 85). This hypothesis was also sup- ported by the results from sounding 18 to the S of the temple</page><page sequence="55">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 2001-2002 55 (cf. Fig. 84). As wall M3 rather abruptly turns in a right angle towards the apsidal building excavated in previous years, one could expect other built structures further S. However, in sounding 18 absolutely no built structures were found but exclusively the same sequence of alluvia as between walls M2 and M3 further N. It seems, therefore, that Eretria faced con- siderable problems with regular inundations, probably related to spring floods during the rainy season, i.e. in winter. A similar arrangement was found in trench 20 near the NW comer of the A temple (cf. Fig. 84). While the trench was initially dug in order to catch the supposed junction between walls 8 and M3, it revealed already the beginning of the next built complex, as is attested by the angle of its compound's walls (M14 and M15). In the same trench a considerable amount of iron slag and frag- ments of melted bronze were found, attesting metal-working in this area and confirming, therefore, similar finds made some years ago in and around building 17. Some of the new results are directly or indirectly related to building 1, the so-called Daphnephoreion (cf. Fig. 84). Very precise trenches dug beneath the round features on the inner and outer sides of the building's apsidal wall revealed that the round features are not-as was believed earlier-bases for wooden columns, but foundation trenches for much smaller posts, as is confirmed by the post-holes continuing beneath them (Fig. 86). Although this may have no major effect on the overall recon- struction of building 9 as proposed some 30 years ago, it will surely affect its relation to the nearby long apsidal building, the so-called hecatompedos (building 2 on fig. 84). Immediately W of apsidal building 1 a round pit was exca- vated (Fo 69 on Fig. 84), containing large amounts of rather fine pottery of the 8th Ct BC as well as organic remains such as olive and grape pips and remains of wooden tools. The contents of this pit are surely related to the functioning of building 1 and, therefore, the detailed analysis will contribute to a better under- standing of the so-called Daphnephoreion, especially regarding the question whether it had a cult function or not. Surprisingly, after the cleaning of the pit (Fo 69) and contin- uation of excavation, a new stone-built structure was found, already at considerable depth and therefore in the ground-water (Fig. 87). The structure itself has been excavated over too small an area to interpret it; however, the pottery related to it indicates a date in the late 3rd or early 2nd mill. BC. The structure is cov- ered by about 1.5m of consecutive layers of alluvia, not con- taining any archaeological remains. Above these lie the G lay- ers. Finds of a similar date have previously been recorded at various spots in Eretria, including the area of the temple of Apollo. It would seem, then, that the bay of Eretria was quite densely occupied in the BA, before the rising water level put an end to these settlement activities. Although yet of a rather pre- liminary nature, these results should also lead to a reconsidera- tion of Eretria's relationship with Lefkandi. For the third consecutive year a field survey led by P. Simon (Univ. of Lausanne) focused on the wider area around the anc. city of Eretria. Following the results of previous campaigns, specific attention was paid to defensive installations and forti- fied places on the hills of Eretria's hinterland. So far 12 such installations have been reported. Their function seems rather clear due to the mostly massive walls; more difficult is their dat- ing, as no specific surface pottery was found. Still, it will be interesting to see whether not only the city of Eretria proper, but also the territory of the city was subject to defensive measures. Another category of monuments that was recorded with spe- cial attention are a considerable number of mounds belonging to the EH and H periods according to surface pottery. Although their precise function can not be determined without excava- tion, some of them seem to be funerary tumuli.' 86. Eretria, building 1: post-hole 87. Eretria, pit Fo 69 Gavalas.

A section of a LR bath-house was excavated in the vicinity of the hotel 'Thermai Sylla', including a complex of two cisterns coated with water-proof plaster, a built drain, a circular brick construction and a pillar. (ADelt 307) Manika. The 48 rock-cut tombs excavated this year can be dated to the period between early EH II (Keros-Syros phase) and the start of EH III (Troy IV, Kastri phase), a little before the Lefkandi I period. They were all cut in the bedrock, and were provided with a dromos, a chamber, which was on many occa- sions laid with pebbles, and a doorway blocked with stones or a slab (Fig. 88). The chambers were mostly trapezoidal, or square, while fewer examples were horse-shoe-shaped or circu- lar. In this part of the cemetery was found an abundance of 'fry- ing pans' (Fig. 89), along with marble Cyc vases or bone paint- boxes. The 'frying pans', which were discovered either in a hor- izontal position, associated with bones or obsidian, or in an upright position against the wall, possibly an act of ritual impor- tance, bore incised or impressed decoration. Among the other finds worth noting are one bronze and two gold rings, similar to types of the EH II period on Lemnos. The wealth of the funeral offerings is indicative of the prosperity of their owners, who were probably mariners or merchants. Only three tombs were cenotaphs. The animal remains confirm the practice of funeral meals on or outside the graves, while the bone paint-boxes sug- gest that the corpses were painted before burial. One of the tombs was used during Myc times (kylikes). (ADelt 289-300) Neos Pyrgos. A horseshoe-shaped stone-built structure and part of another building, associated with pottery dating from the LG period to the start of the 6th Ct BC, was excavated in the vicin- ity of the A sculpture (found in 1992) depicting the fight of Herakles with a lion. (ADelt 308) Oreoi. Architectural remains of the 4th-3rd Ct BC were exca- vated in the area of Kato Oreoi, including a storage area with a row of large amphoras, a section of a 3rd-Ct BC pebble floor, depicting a triton in the central medallion, surrounded by two zones with dolphins and ivy respectively (Fig. 90). In another plot was unearthed part of a substantial building with a destruc- tion level, dated to the start of the 3rd Ct BC. (ADelt 306-7) Phylla.

In the course of investigations on the hill of Viglatouri, where G remains had been located in the past, including an oval building which yielded pottery of the MG period (750 BC), thus confirming the Euboian origin of the Kyme colonists, the remains were discovered of an extensive G settlement around this building, as well as earlier phases of occupation (Myc, MH, EH, LN) (Fig. 91).

In the course of rescue excavations in the mod. town remnants of the anc. fortifications were discovered in three dif- ferent plots. In the area of the playground, near Odos Kordone, were investigated the foundations of two rectangular buildings of the 4th Ct BC, probably part of the defensive system. Part of a R wall, also probably related to the fortifications, was record- ed at the junction of Odos Gatou and Papachrestou. Finally, along Odos Markidou was located part of the exterior face of the fortification wall of the anc. town, preserved for a length of 11.30m. At its E end it formed a comer, probably part of a tower, built in the trapezoidal isodomic system. The foundations of a rectangular building with a destruction deposit, dating from the HL to the LR period, were excavated in Odos Diovouniote, while in Odos Tzamala was discovered an anc. tomb. (ADelt 328-9) Kirra. In the N part of the PR magoula of Kirra, six successive occupation phases were investigated, including architectural remains, tombs and portable finds. To the earliest phase belonged the stone foundations of two megaron-shaped houses, preserved for a length of 8m, with a road between. In the same area were excavated three cist-tombs, two of which belonged to the same first phase of occupation, while the third is associated with the fourth phase. The decorated pottery can be dated to the LH IIIA1 and 2 period, although earlier MH pottery, both Minyan and matt-painted, seems to coexist with the typical Myc wares in the provincial areas, during the EMyc period. The stratigraphy suggests a continuous occupation in the area from the MH to the LH IIIA2 period. In the N part of the PR magoula, the remains were recorded of the N sector of the 4th- Ct BC fortification wall, at a distance of 15-20m from the N limit of the PR settlement. (ADelt 327-8) NORTHWEST GREECE Agios Menas. In 1996 the EPS carried out the fourth season of excavations in the Pal rock-shelter of Boila, located at the W mouth of the Voidomatis valley, at an elevation of ca 420m. Excavation of previous 0.50 x 0.50m grid units continued, and six new units were opened up. Sorting of wet-sieving residues was completed, as was the cleaning of all archaeological finds, and the recording of lithic artefacts progressed. In the inner (SE) part of the rock-shelter the stratigraphic sequence beneath the levels disturbed by the Med burial, con- firmed the lithostratigraphy observed in other areas across the site. Colluvial deposits, the scree deposit (horizon III) in partic- ular, were thicker in this location than in other areas. As the adjacent cave wall defines a tectonic fault, sediment was undoubtedly contributed to the stratigraphic sequence by this structural weakness in the limestone. These deposits were rich in organic material, such as concentrations and scatters of ash, suggesting repeated 'domestic' activities. At least two occupa- tion phases were traced, one in the scree deposit (horizon III), and one in the phase of continental sedimentation (horizon II). The latter, fine-grained deposit so far represents the earliest cul- tural level at Boila. In this section of the site cultural remains were found in rather low density, and were not associated with any evidence of hearths or burning, indicating variability in the spatial organisation of activities through the different occupa- tion phases. In this part of the rock-shelter also the colluvial deposits rested on the surface of the Aristi Unit alluvial terrace, known from previous geomorphological research in the Voidomatis river basin to have been formed during river incision phases fol- lowing the last glacial maximum. The Boila rock-shelter is, therefore, a relatively recent geomorphic feature, which was not available for use prior to the lowering of the river level. In the central section, excavation focused on defining the lat- eral extent of horizon II. A complex of in situ hearths was locat- ed, the find spot coinciding with the hearth remains within the overlying horizon III. This find possibly represents a short-lived settlement phase. The significance of locating a high-resolution settlement in the context of Pal caves and rock-shelters must be emphasized, as it is an exception to the general rule of the palimpsest character evidenced by Pal contexts in general, and more specifically in Epirus. Boila must have been a site of occasional use during the 14th mill. BP. The archaeological and stratigraphic records at Boila will decisively contribute to our understanding of the ecosystem management strategies and diversity of habitats available in NW Pindus in the last millen- nia of the Pleistocene. Excavation along the present dripline confirmed the litho- stratigraphic sequence noted in this section of the site during previous campaigns. Emphasis was placed on the study of the talus stratigraphy, in which a deposit, rich in calcitic ashes (horizon IV), had been identified in previous years. Excavation in 1996 was aimed at defining the lateral extent of the stratigraphic units. At the deep- est levels, the coarser components of the deposit, both natural and archaeological, exhibited an inclination, indicating that horizon IV was not an in situ deposit. Rather, the largely anthro- pogenic material, originally deposited to the SE of its present location beyond the reach of the natural overhang; must have been washed out of place onto an erosional surface which had previously been formed in the same unprotected open area. The cultural character of the horizon suggests that in the period of Pleistocene-Holocene transition hunter-gatherers continued to use the rock-shelter, and set hearths at a distance from its S wall. This structural difference in the spatial arrangement of activities</page><page sequence="58">58 DAVID BLACKMAN running NW-SE, with a stone-paved pavement (ADelt 391). In Odos Korydalleos, a section of another HL stone-paved road was excavated, with a destruction deposit and remnants of road- side buildings (ADelt 389). The remains of the two retaining walls of another HL road, as well as the N side of an avenue, running E-W, at right angles to this road, were investigated in Odos Porphyriou Metropolitou. Along the avenue was dis- covered a section of a stepped limestone pavement, leading to the fortif1cation walls (ADelt 391-2). HL walls and the sides of a drain, dating from the A to the LHL period, were excavated in Odos Maximou Graikou (ADelt 391). In Odos Perikleous a rectangular tower of the HL fortifica- tions was unearthed, built in the orthogonal isodomic style. In the vicinity of the tower were discovered other sections of the anc. walls, as well as a circular tower to the N. (ADelt 390) A section of the interior face of the HL fortif1cations was also located at the junction of Odos Arachthou and Katsantone. (ADelt 391) The only funerary remains were recorded in Odos Kommenou, in the area of the SW cemetery of the anc. town. Investigations involved the funeral periboloi to the E of the monumental avenue crossing the cemetery, and more specif1- cally the excavation of a total of 30 burials, including 10 cist tombs, 2 pit-graves, and 1 tile-roofed tomb. The use of the cemetery was attested as late as the 2nd Ct AD. (ADelt 387) Grammenitsa. At the site of Paleambela, 9km NE of Arta, has been located a basin, crossed by streams and characterized by the presence of abundant EPleistocene deposits. The area is known since 1981 as the f1nd-spot of MPal artifacts. Two trial trenches near the top of a small hill in the area yielded no strat- ified deposits, while more artifacts were discovered on the sur- face, at the sites of Gepedo and Aerodromio. The total number of artifacts collected amounts to 614, the majority of which (522 pieces-85%) were surface f1nds. The artifacts were made of brownish f1ne-grained flint, while the raw material consisted of slabs of small and medium size, probably of local prove- nance. The examples with a fully developed patina are very few, in contrast to the surface f1nds from other sites in Epirus, like Kokkinopelos. In many cases, such examples have been re- worked, which resulted in the production of a great number of shapeless cores and morphologically complex tool types. Blades, microblades and generally blade-like chips are rare. The cores have many striking platforms and were apparently used for the production of flakes. Rare are the microblade cores and tool types of the Upper Pal. The extant tool types include side scrapers, drills, toothed tools and notches, as well as a section 92. Arta, Odos Skoupha: Hellenistic road throughout the various phases of settlement at Boila calls for interpretative approaches alternative to functional necessity; socio-cultural dimensions in the organisation of settlement will be explored in an attempt to understand the identity and role of the rock-shelter in the context of Pal upland settlements in Epirus. (ADelt 706-10) Arta (anc. Ambracia). In 1996, 11 plots were investigated, which yielded mostly sections of anc. roads and buildings, as well as funerary remains and parts of the anc. fortification sys- tem. The majority of the architectural remains date to the HL period. Part of a road (w. 1 .05m), running NW-SE, with a pave- ment on its W side and the fragmentary remains of two roadside buildings, was unearthed in Odos Philellenon. The road was laid with gravel, pebbles and broken roof-tiles, while the pave- ment, 75-95cm wide, was paved with limestone slabs; over the road lay a destruction deposit. The road belonged to the urban grid of Ambracia, and was one of the numerous parallel roads running N-S through the city, at intervals of 30.50m, which were originally crossed by wider paved avenues, running E-W. The two surviving buildings, which were used from the 5th Ct BC to the LHL period, were separated by a slab-paved passage, running E-W, and leading to the road. (ADelt 385) Part of another, similar HL road, also running NW-SE, pre- served for a length of 16m (w. 4.20-4.70m) and paved with square and rectangular slabs, was excavated in Odos Skoupha (Fig. 92) (ADelt 385-7). A section of a third HL stone-paved road, running in the same direction, with remains of a stone- paved pavement on its E side, was discovered in Odos Arachthou (ADelt 387-9). In the same area were investigated fragmentary remains of houses, and the E limit of an anc. road, 93.

(ADelt 392-4 &amp; Fig. 7) Kastri. In a plot at the foot of the hill, on which have been iden- tified remains of a fortified settlement, part of the anc. fortifi- cation walls was uncovered, preserved for a length of 12m, and dated to the LC/EHL period. The wall was built in the polygo- nal style, while to a later phase of the wall can be assigned a 4th- Ct BC house, which was built partly over its interior face. (ADelt 398-9) Leukas. Karya. Remains of 10 tombs, 3 cists, 5 poros sar- cophagi, 1 clay sarcophagus and 1 tile-roofed tomb, as well as part of a funeral peribolos, running E-W, and belonging to the S cemetery of the anc. city, were discovered at the site of Spasmene Vryse. At the site of Parasporia, at the N foot of the Koulmos hill, were identified 2 cist tombs and 2 tile-roofed graves, as well as 6 funeral stelae, part of the same cemetery. Finally, at the site of Autantzes were unearthed 7 graves, 4 cists, 2 poros sarcophagi, and 1 tile-roofed tomb. (ADelt 400-1) Maratovouni. At the top of the hill, on the W side of the Arachthos river, were located remains of anc. fortifications. The walls, preserved at foundation level, can be dated in the HL period. Near the walls was discovered a layer containing hand- made PR pottery. (ADelt 394) Nikopolis. Small-scale excavations conducted in the area of the Augustus monument, apart from minor finds in its vicinity, resulted in the location of the continuation of the built drain, 6m NE of the podium of the monument, as well as the discovery of a great number of marble architectural members on either side. (ADelt 395-8) Riachovo. At Leuka were located two anc. graves, one tile- roofed, dating from the 2nd half of the 4th Ct BC. (ADelt 384) SOUTHERN THESSALY Achilleio. The application by a private company to open a quar- ry in the cave at the site of Krounia led to a joint trial excava- tion by the 13th EPCA and the EPS in 1996. Eight excavation sections were made within and around the cave, with dimen- sions of 4 x 4m. Anc. chisel marks were found in the rock on the facade of the cave (Fig. 93). There were also traces of archi- tectural members and a large niche with a table. To the NE of the cave were found three rectangular cisterns carved into the rock. Rain water from these cisterns was channelled into a fourth, perhaps the cistern located in front of the cave. Other finds included LC, HL and R pottery, animal bones, stone and bone tools, metal implements, fragments of glass vessels, loom- weights and lamps. Much damage had been done to the stratigraphy and the area outside the cave by antiquities pillaging. The cave appears to have had a religious function. (ADelt 345-7) Alonnisos The EPS carried out in 1996 the third season of the Palaeolithic Survey Programme in collaboration with the 13th EPCA. This consisted of: (a) systematic survey for the location of Pal remains and sourcing of raw materials. Three types of landforms were sur- veyed: valleys, where Pal sites may have been sealed within Pleistocene deposits; low relief coastal areas where low erosion rates are expected and therefore preservation of Pal material is likely and erosional surfaces that, once formed, remain stable, being subject to only local-scale natural and anthropogenic dis- turbance, thus preserving archaeological material in situ (in the broad sense). Fourteen sites were located along the mod. coastal zone at the mouths of coastal valleys, namely in Kokkinokastro, Glyfa, Gerakas, and Leptos Yalos, dating to the MPal and Mes periods, with sporadic remains of the final UPal; 6,000 flint artefacts were collected. (b) Study of tectonic, geomorphological and sedimentologi- cal parameters with a view to reconstruction of the palaeogeo- graphical evolution of the island, as well as the processes of for- mation and preservation of Pal sites. Tectonic and eustatic activ- ity triggered erosion mechanisms and are responsible for the depletion of considerable amounts of Pleistocene sediment. Therefore sites were, in fact, products of redeposition of palimpsest character, preserving remains of activity throughout the Upper Pleistocene and Early Holocene periods. (c) Technomorphological analysis and dating of lithic assemblages; depositional and post-depositional processes responsible for their formation. Narrow sea straits separated the Sporades during the last Ice Age, and Alonnisos was part of the continent only during the last glacial maximum (18,000 BP). Pal and Mes sites would have overlooked wider coastal plains, and controlled ecosystems which are today extinct. Coastal topography was similar in the MPal and Mes, but differed dra- matically at 18,000 BP. Eustatic activity accounts for the spatial coincidence of MPal and Mes sites, and potentially for the absence of substantial UPal remains. Landscapes are dynamic and ever-changing, so that the degree to which any given archaeological record reflects cul- tural history or geological preservation must be evaluated before interpretations are attempted. The survey confirmed and further documented human presence in the Aegean in the MPal and Mes periods. This evidence is, in fact, one of the few reli- able indications of occupation of the Mediterranean islands dur- ing the Upper Pleistocene and Early Holocene. (ADelt 715-19) Off Phangrou Islet. Near Kyra Panagia island the EMA car- ried out a second season of excavation on the late 5th-Ct wreck, the earliest C wreck to be found in Greek waters. In 1995 25 complete sharp-pointed amphoras had been raised, with bg pot- tery, a bronze ladle and the two parts of a C lead anchor stock (Figs. 94-97). In 1996 important finds continued, dating from 480-425, and included a portion of the ship's hull (0.70 x 0.17m); the prospects for further timber finds are good. The on- site direction was carried out in depths of 29-35m, by tDem. Chaniotis. (ADelt 724-5) Yioura Island, Cave of Cyclops. In 1996 A. Sampson (EPS) completed excavation in the cave, located on the S side of the island at an elevation of 150m. The first chamber close to the cave entrance was excavated, where a high density of occu- pation remains was noted. The inner part of the cave yielded only few remains dating to the C, HL and R periods. The 1St and 2nd Cts AD are well represented across the site, suggesting intensive use of the cave in that period with the possible estab- lishment of a sanctuary. Undisturbed EN, MN and LN levels (6500-4000 BC) were reached in trenches A, B and F. EN levels yielded decorated pot- tery, while the MN assemblage is of excellent quality with dis- tinctive decoration. These may have been products of a local workshop active in the Northern Sporades, and one of the main characteristics of the 'Yioura-Kyra Panagia culture'. Relations with Thessaly, Euboea and other islands in the Aegean, and also with Asia Minor and the Balkans had been established in that period.</page><page sequence="60">60 DAVID BLACKMAN .bft O 94-97. Phangrou islet: finds from a 5th Ct BC wreck The practice of farming is attested by the presence of flint blades used as sickles. The same type of implement has been found in N settlements in Thessaly, whereas the source of the raw material, honey-coloured flint, was traced to W Bulgaria. Great numbers of animal bones and arrowheads were yielded by 5th-mill. BC levels (LN I), pointing to intensive animal hus- bandry and hunting activities. However, most significant proved to be the Mes levels (9th -7th mill. BC) identified in trenches B and F. The latter dis- played a sequence of occupation floors with hearths and food remains-bones of animals, birds and fish. Among the numerous stone and bone tools are 45 fishing hooks made from animal bone, a unique find in the archaeological record of Greece. Another important find was a human skull dated to the 9th mill. BC, possibly belonging to a 65-70 year-old woman. The cave of Cyclops is to date the earliest island site in the Aegean, and it is hoped that a full picture of Mes and N occu- pation of the island will be gained on completion of the study of the environmental material from the site, combined with the studies of sea-level changes and palaeoclimate. (ADelt 712-14) Anc. Demetrias. Work began on a presentation project in the palace area. The excavation lasted for two months and took place in the S residential wing of the E palace complex. A cir- cular cistern was located in the centre of the SW tower (Fig. 98, d. 1.80m, int. di. 55m and ext. di. 4.05m). The SW tower is not preserved evenly throughout and none of the NW comer remains. The purpose of the excavation to the E of the SW tower was to remove the baulk from earlier exca- vations so as to unify the site and make it accessible for visitors. An antechamber was uncovered, the entrance to which was approximately in the middle of the length of the S stoa of the courtyard. Leading off from this antechamber were two halls to the W and two halls to the E. Only the hall next to and W of the antechamber had direct access to the S stoa. The floors of the halls were made of crushed red limestone, much of which was destroyed. Only in the hall at the E end of the wing was the floor preserved complete. The area of the S stoa and the S wing suffered from later interventions in R and ECh times, when it was used as a ceme- tery. Sections of the walls and wall paintings had been destroyed at many points. The burials were removed after exca- vation. The excavation also extended to the S section of the E wing. A white lime mortar floor was found in the SE comer of the S wing beneath the baulk. The remains of a four-sided later building were located NW of the SE tower, perhaps from a LR watchtower. The NE comer of the hall, which communicated with the rooms of the E wing, was located beneath this structure. (ADelt 333-5) Telecommunications (OTE) works at Pephkakia- Aivaliotika uncovered anc. walls, mosaic floors, roof-tiles and other anc. remains of the C and HL periods. The S section of a HL house was located on the Patsiaroucha- Apostou plot in Tyrous Street in the E part of the anc. city, i98. Dm-er . : circular cite 98.

Walls T1-T5 were built with unworked stone on the soft rock and fol- lowed the slope of the land. The strong wall T5 had a E-W orientation and 11.40m of its length were uncovered, to a height of 2.05m. Walls Ti, T3 and T4, which defined the rooms of the house, were uncovered perpendicular to T5. Fragmentary remains of other walls were found outside of the area of the house. The excavation revealed much HL pottery as well as bronze coins from Larisa (400-344 BC), Lysimachean coins from Thrace (297-281 BC), Paroreia (3rd Ct BC), Cassander, Antigonos Gonatas and the Thessalian League, several clay loom- weights, iron nails, fragments of clay figurines and clay lamps. (ADelt 336) Excavations continued for a second year and were completed in the N cemetery of anc. Demetrias at the Bourboulithra site (AR 2000-01, 72). Outside the N wall of the HL city, 919 anc. tombs which had been dug into the natural earth were uncovered on the slopes of 'Palatia' hill. Most - of the later burials covered the earlier ones either partially or wholly. All had an E-W or N-S or NE-SW orientation. v n M A The type of the burials varied: simple pit burials, .. ...... cist graves built using monolithic marble slabs, tile- m covered burials, built graves with unworked stone, .-.. enchytrismoi in various vessels, and a cist grave dug L into the rock. There were many grave finds of vari- ous materials: gilt wreaths; gold, silver, bronze and iron jew- ellery; silver and lead utensils and model furniture; bronze and 99. d silver coins; glass vessels; clay beads; bronze and iron tools; clay figurines. A large number of clay vessels accompanied the burials, such as askoi, lekythia, kylikes, handle-less skyphoi, pyxides, skyphoi with relief patterns, amphoras, lamps, etc. The excavation also brought a number of grave stelae to light, most of which had been reused to seal later burials. The burials date from the LC to the R period and the ceme- :', i tery was used throughout the existence of anc. Demetrias. (ADelt 337-8) l Work was also carried out in the area of the anc. theatre. The wooden seats which had been placed in the cavea in the 1980s, with the purpose of staging a limited number of theatri- cal productions, were removed. The cavea was then cleaned, during which process other stone architectural members came to light, mainly in the central section of the cavea. It appears that some of these members had been reused, such as the drum of an Ionic column upon which a little of the plaster coating sur- vives. The R aqueduct of Demetrias was already visible in a high- er part of the cavea. Its channel was cleaned as far as the bound- aries of the expropriated area of the theatre. A 91.50m length of the channel was revealed (Figs. 99-100), running in a general N-S direction. The channel was built with roughly cut lime- stone blocks bonded with mortar. Its greatest width is 0.22m and greatest preserved height is 0.35-0.40m. Layers of plaster at certain points of its bed show that it had been repaired on occasion. In the S part of the cavea, at the point where the channel makes an S-bend, are the remains of the beginning of a branch going SE, i.e. in the direction where the foundations of the bridge of the aqueduct that channelled water from the hill to the palace lie. (ADelt 338-340) Work on the N exterior side of the cavea revealed more of the buttress walls that had been uncovered in earlier excava- c 100. Demetrias: theatre, with Roman aqueduct</page><page sequence="62">62 DAVID BLACKMAN 101. Magoula Orgozinos: Late Neolithic settlement tions. A HL wall which supported the earth fill of the cavea on the N side of the theatre was also uncovered for 12.75m, with a width of 1.10-1.20m and a general E-W direction. The lower part of the wall formed a stone platform, whilst the upper part was built with mud-bricks, of which not a trace survives. The platform is preserved at a height of 0.35-1.15m and is built with medium-sized, roughly cut limestone blocks. The E end of a straight wall was found a little to the N of the excavated W end of the HL buttress wall, although at a higher level. This wall (wall 1) runs in a NW-SE direction for 16.80m. Only the lowest course of roughly cut medium-sized limestone masonry, on the N side, has survived. The W section of a NE-SW wall was discovered high up in the NW part of the theatre (wall 11: preserved 1. 12.30m, w. 0.65m). At a distance of 3.85m SW of the E surviving end of wall 11 a series of four buttresses was found against its NW side. The buttresses are square in shape (three 0.90 x 0.90m, the other 0.85 x 0.85m) and 1.35-1.55m apart. During the excava- tion of these buttresses three tile-covered graves were found, one of which contained a child burial. There were no grave finds and the burials are later than wall 11. (ADelt 340-1) Dimeni. Excavations that had begun in November 1995 contin- ued in 1996 in the former Katsaros field (see AR 2000-01, 72). The purpose of the excavation in 1996 was to investigate the stratigraphy of the LBA occupation of the site and a new sector was opened up to the S of the North house which had been excavated in 1985 and 1987. The ruins of 3 LBA houses and MBA earth fills were uncovered. Sections of a house named the South house, were uncovered. The South house is smaller than the North house and is aligned on the same axis. Four rooms from the final phase of occupa- tion were excavated. The entrance of the main room (room 1, 5.50m x 4m) is in the E. Three smaller rooms are aligned on the S side of and parallel with room 1. A lead ring, the only one to be found in Dimeni, was found in the South house. The East house was uncovered a little to the E of the South house and with the same orientation. Two rooms were located. These two houses demonstrate that the buildings from the set- tlement's last phase of occupation (LBA IIIB2-IIIC early) were built at a distance from each other. Sections of a MBA house were found in the area between the North and the South house, with two rooms aligned on the same axis; the first (4m x 4.35m) and sections of the second room were investigated. Only the stone foundations of the house remain. A thick layer of burnt clay and wood on the floor of the first room indicate that the house had been destroyed by fire. Excavation in room 1 reached as far as its earth floor. Traces of burning and ash were found next to the E wall over a thick and compact layer of clay, possibly a clay hearth. This destruction layer contained burnt bricks and vases. The earth fill contained exclusively pottery of the last phase of the MBA. (ADelt 330-1) Cleaning and other work was also carried out. The walls and foundations in the central courtyard of the N settlement were secured. An information kiosk was opened for visitors and a paved pathway was created to facilitate visitors' movement from the N to the Myc areas. The large Myc bath discovered in 1995 was restored. (ADelt 357) Kallithero. Small sections of walls built with ashlar blocks had previously been spotted on the surface S of the mod. village of Kallithero, on the peak of Agios Athanasios hill, near the acrop- olis of the HL settlement. These walls may have belonged to a castle and, with money from the Second Community Support Fund, work began in 1996 to create an open archaeological area on the site. The entire length of the S side of the castle was uncovered (66.70m). Access to the towers was through door openings on the inner side, which were not located in the cen- tre of the towers. There were only a few finds, including mill- stones which suggest an agricultural or possibly military use for the castle. (ADelt 348-9). Kierio. Excavations continued in 1996 in the cemetery of anc. Kierio at the site of Kotronolakkes, along the Neo Monasteri- Karditsa national highway. Work this year brought 47 more graves to light. A detailed description of each grave is given in ADelt 353-5. Magoula Orgozinos. Rescue excavations were carried out in 1996 on a section of an early LN settlement during work on the widening of the Neo Monasteri-Karditsa national highway. There was only one archaeological level, at a depth of 0.40m below the surface. There were many traces of fires, and frag- mentary domestic remains were located: amorphous clay lumps, hard floor surfaces with post-holes (Fig. 101). The houses of the settlement were pile dwellings with a framework of branches covered with layers of clay. It has not been possible to reconstruct the plan of a house. The finds included unpainted orange and grey Tsangli phase pottery, as well as sherds of Tsountas types B3d and B3e painted ware of the same phase. There were plenty of other small finds, and it appears that the Magoula Orgozinos settlement was a peripher- al agricultural unit (animal husbandry and arable farming) dependent upon a main settlement elsewhere. (ADelt 351) Metropolis. Excavations on the Koukouzeli plot were complet- ed in 1996. Excavation in the E sector reached a depth of 1.60m. Two rooms were located in the N, with walls of clay mixed with river pebbles and sandstone. There were two sur- viving building phases and the layout suggests the existence of a third room. Another room (ca 3 x 5.50m) was located to the SW, also with two building phases. A narrow passageway 1.50m wide separated the three rooms, which have openings onto it. There were two kilns: a small one (kiln B: Fig. 102) attached to a wall in the NE complex and a large one (kiln A). Excavation in the W sector reached a depth of 1.70m. A room was located to the NE (5 x 6m), with a pithos in situ. There were two building phases. A similar building technique and materials were used in the earlier phase as in the rooms of the E sector, whilst during the later phase the walls were con- structed in 'herring-bone' style. Another room to the S had two similar construction phases; it appears to have continued out- side the Koukouzeli plot. An open area between the two rooms appears to be the terminus for a water channel built of sand-</page><page sequence="63">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 2001-2002 63 stone. A second channel, belonging to the later phase, runs diag- onally across this open area. These two excavation sectors were located at a great dis- tance from each other and it is thus difficult to come to any con- clusions as to how they were related. There were many clay and metal finds, including male and female figurines, bronze coins, clay tiles, a clay mould in the form of a griffin, bronze and lead sheeting, loom-weights, much pottery and many small clay objects. It appears that the area was in continuous use from the 4th Ct BC to the 4th Ct AD. (ADelt 349-51 &amp; figs 15-16) Moschato. Lianokokkala site (temple of Apollo). Removal of the clay tile level that covered the E part of the cella of the tem- ple of Apollo, as well as the N and W wings and the W half of the S wing, continued in 1996. Almost all the tiles were of Cor manufacture and those used in later repairs are stamped with the names Philleos and Kleomachos. The thin layer of earth with burnt organic materials beneath the tiles in the nave, evidence of the great fire which destroyed the temple, was also removed. Conservation work is also being carried out on the sandstone architectural members of the temple. (ADelt 347-8) Mouzaki, anc. Gomphoi. Another eight graves were discov- ered in the bed of the Pamisos river in 1996: 2 graves lined with clay slabs, 3 clay lamakes and cist graves, the interior walls of which were lined with worked limestone slabs. The cover stones of all the graves were missing and all the burials had been destroyed by the force of the water. No traces of burial remains were found in graves 1-3 and 6, whilst graves 3 and 7 had been almost completely destroyed. The graves date to the LHL and ER periods, had been dug into red clayey earth and were covered with pebbles. (ADelt 356-357) Theotokos coast (SE comer of Magnesia peninsula). Traces of an early 5th-Ct Doric temple and EG graves had been located here in the early 20th Ct. The 13th EPCA conducted a trial exca- vation in autumn 1996. The site has been identified by many with anc. Sepias where the Persian fleet was wrecked. A room from the S side of an anc. building was uncovered. The pottery (monochrome fragments from vases of daily use, bg sherds) indicated that the building had been built in C times and remained in use until the R period. Buttresses of the anc. wall of the acropolis were located ca 15m to the S. The area E of the mod. church of the Theotokos was cleaned. Three limestone columns were found, and it is believed that they were moved here to protect the neighbouring ECh church from the sea. Work stopped at a depth of 2.40m. 102. Metropolis: kiln Fifteen graves along the road from the ECh church of the Theotokos to the mod. church were explored. These had become visible when work on the new road had begun and con- sisted of 3 cist graves, 6 tile-covered pit graves, 5 stone-built cist graves and 1 schist-covered pit grave. Only four contained grave goods (skyphoi, bolsal kylix, oil lamp and oinochoe) dated to the mid-4 Ct. (ADelt 331-3) 103. Velestino: marble figurine fragment . Velestino (anc. Pherai). The large-scale rescue excavation con- tinued in 1996 at three major points where antiquities had come to light during work on widening the national highway (see AR 2000-01, 78). The discovery of a LN settlement in the Chloe Velestinou area was significant. The settlement had suffered much damage during the construction of a PG-G tholos tomb on the same site, but mainly during construction of the Volos-Larisa railway line in the late 19th Ct and construction of the national highway in the 1960s. The archaeological conclu- sions that can be made so far are limited and based on material collected from a surface survey, as excavation was not possible (although the opportunity still holds for the future). The most important object collected was a marble anthropomorphic fig- urine (Fig. 103). A trapezoid-shaped cremation pit (1.90 x 1.20m, d. 1.25m, dug into the natural earth) was located and excavated at a short distance from the LN site; it had been partially destroyed by the construction work. The internal walls and bottom had been lined with clay and bore strong traces of burning. The pit contained the remains of burnt human bones and organic matter. Burnt wood was also found and was sent for scientific analysis to the NCSR 'Democritus.' Based on the results from this analysis, the cremations can be dated at some point between the 13th and 10th Cts BC. The pit is an extremely rare find for this area, and it was conserved and removed whole so as to be available for further study and possible future exhibition in a museum. Two tholos tombs had been excavated in the area of the PG-G cemetery in 1989-1992. The new excavations brought to light six more PG-G tholos tombs, five of which were pre- served in a very good condition. The tombs are circular in shape with a preserved h. of 1.50-1.80m. Entrance to the tombs was on their W or SW, with a small dromos formed by upright stone slabs and stone slab roofing. The tombs contained multiple internments, the skeletons of which in some cases were pre- served in situ in an outstretched position (Fig. 104). Otherwise, the bones had been scattered or gathered together, perhaps by water that had drained into the interior. There are also examples of the deliberate clearing of bones to make room for new buri- als. The burial goods were rich and varied: clay vases, iron weapons, gold and silver jewellery, beads. The five tholos tombs were conserved so as to be accessible in the future. In this area were also found five simple pit graves covered with stone slabs, obviously forming part of the PG-G cemetery. Each grave contained one burial in an outstretched position and with only a little bronze and iron jewellery. A HL building, probably a farmhouse, was excavated in the same vicinity. Only a few of the stone foundations remain, cov- ered by a destruction level. The coins, small objects and pottery found in the destruction level date the building to the late 4th to early 2nd Ct BC.</page><page sequence="64">64 DAVID BLACKMAN 104. Velestino: tholos tomb Near to the farmhouse and next to one of the tholos tombs was found a rectangular cist grave oriented NE-NW. It con- tained two burials in an outstretched position and laid out in opposite directions. The 11 clay vases used as grave offerings date the burial to the HL period, probably contemporary with the farmhouse. (ADelt 342-4) One of the most significant finds in the Agios Georgios Pheron district was an anc. road outside the city of Pherai, run- ning E-W. This road may have connected the city with its port of Pagasai and later with Demetrias. There were two construc- tion phases, in the 4th Ct BC and the LHL or R period. Traces of wheel marks from the 4th Ct gave a distance of 1.40m between the wheels of the cart. A low stone wall demarcated the S side of the road. The anc. city's NE cemetery had grown along the length of the Pherai-Pagasai road, part of which was exposed during the roadworks. 16 burials were uncovered, either in small groups or isolated, and dating from the LC to the HL and R periods. The burials were orthogonal cist graves as well as pit graves, some of which were lined with stone slabs and contained the intern- ments and very few grave goods. The most significant are 4 HL cist graves. The marble slabs were well-worked and decorated on the interior with ionic columns in relief, some of which bear traces of paint. Each grave included 2-3 main burials and some fine grave goods. A cylindrical marble ossuary with a lid was found in one, containing the ashes of the dead. Some marble grave stelae were also found, one of which was complete. A small building to the S of the anc. road was excavated (ca 14 x 14.5m), dated from the pottery and small finds to the 2nd-3rd Ct AD. It was probably an isolated farmhouse. The main entrance was on the S side, with a secondary entrance on the E. This building is a rare complete and well-preserved example of the architecture of the period. As such, it was declared protect- ed and it is intended that it will be opened to the public. (ADelt 344-5) Velestino area. M. Di Salvatore (Italian School) continued in 2001 his survey of the territory of anc. Pherai, in collaboration with the Volos EPCA. Two N habitats and a HL site were iden- tified, and a record was made of all inscriptions found in the area. PHTHIOTIS Achinos. A hut-shaped tomb, part of a 1st C BC cemetery, was investigated in Odos Ath. Diakou. (ADelt 315-16) Atalande. Architectural remains of a 4th-Ct BC building, with a destruction deposit, as well as rem- . nants of later occupation including a pebble floor and a drain, were recorded in Odos Androutsou, while a fragmentary wall was unearthed in the area of Bodovatsa. At the junction of Odos Ethnikes Antistaseos and Serapheim Kokkola, fragmentary architectural remains of two building phases were investigated, the earliest of which was of R date. The pottery collected dates from the Myc period to the 5th Ct BC. i The remains of one or more public buildings were uncovered in Odos Serapheim Kokkola. The earlier use of the area dated to the 5th Ct BC, while during the LHL period a monumental staircase was constructed, with seven stone steps preserved, lead- ing to the upper part of the C wall to the W; the staircase was lined on the N and S by parallel walls. A drain, passing partly over the staircase, can be dated to the R period (1st Ct AD). Remains of a floor and a destruction deposit of the 5th-6th Cts AD covered the earlier phases. (ADelt 318-321) At the site of Skamna, to the NW of the PR settlement of Ag. Vlases, two small cist tombs were excavated, looted in the past. (ADelt 319) Drymaia. To the SW of the anc. fortifications, two cist-tombs were excavated, dating from the 2nd half of the 4th Ct BC. (ADelt 323) Exarhos. At the site of Smixe four chamber tombs of the LMyc period were investigated, with ellipsoidal chambers and hemi- spherical roofs. In two of the tombs (V, VI), the doorways were blocked with a dry stone wall, while the dromoi were sloping, with converging walls. In one of the tombs (V) was found an ellipsoidal pit before the doorway, containing the bones of three skeletons, one of which was buried in a contracted position. Tomb VI, which was undisturbed, yielded 18 burials in four successive layers. (ADelt 316-17) Golemi. One more chamber tomb, with a large trapezoidal chamber and a short, sloping dromos, was investigated in the Myc cemetery. (ADelt 322-3) Halai. The 1996 season (ADelt 325-6) was covered in AR 1996-97, 62. John E. Coleman (ASCS) reports on the 2001 study season: 'Most of our attention concentrated on conservation at the site of the acropolis of Halai and in particular on study for two reports on future conservation of N remains in area F. Participants also worked with the records of the excavations and with other activities for which no permits are required, such as experiments with ceramic production.' Kalyvia Lamias. To the N of the old road from Lamia to Karpenesi, at the site of a PG cemetery, were excavated three ellipsoidal cuttings, covered by stones, which were associated with SubPG pottery. The cuttings were used as tombs, of a type similar to those discovered both in the same plot in the past and in Lefkandi. The skeletal remains were the remains of the orig- inal burial or of cremations, moved here from another area. The</page><page sequence="65">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 2001-2002 65 use of the cemetery extends from the LMyc to the SubPG peri- od. The neighbouring cemetery at Bikiorema yielded similar dates. (ADelt 314-15) Lamia. In 1996, eight rescue excavations were carried out in the mod. town, the overwhelming majority consisting of archi- tectural remains of private or public character. A section of the fortifications of the anc. town, dated to the 2nd half of the 4th Ct BC and built in the isodomic system, were excavated in Odos Palaiologou. Another section of the fortification wall or part of a gate of similar date was unearthed at the junction of Odos Karaiskake and Kazoule. It consisted of a square area found- ed on the bedrock and built in the orthogonal isodomic style. The interior face of the W side of the wall preserved the remains of another wall running along it, which was apparently used as a retaining wall for the fill covering the inside of the fortifica- tions. A section of a C/HL wall was recorded in Odos Makropoulou, while parts of other walls were found in Odos Karaiskake and Odos Solomou, the latter of the 4th Ct BC. Finally, part of a possible kiln and the remains of a destroyed tile-roofed tomb were recorded at the junction of Odos Amphiktyonon and Plataion. As regards funerary remains, four cist tombs of Sub PG date were discovered in Odos Tanagras, while in Odos Sophokleous were investigated two cists and one hut-shaped tomb. (ADelt 311-14) Makryrache Domokou. A cist tomb, of a type common in Phthiotis during the HL era, can be dated to the late 3rdearly 2nd Ct BC. (ADelt 321-2) Neo Monasteri. During excavations at the site of the shrine of Demeter Proeria, a great number of portable finds was record- ed, especially clay seated female figurines and 14 clay figurines of horses, one of which preserved the feet of a rider, all votive offerings to the goddess and dated from the 2nd half of the 5th to the first quarter of the 4th Ct BC. Among the finds were also four figurines of birds, fragments of female slab-like idols, a fragmentary tortoise, four fragmentary figurines representing boars, and seven clay female masks. (ADelt 321) Phrantzes. Architectural remains of a domestic nature, includ- ing the comer of a room with an oversized pithos, almost intact, were recorded to the W of the mod. settlement. (ADelt 323) Rodonia Ypates. Remains of walls, part of one or more build- ings, were investigated at the site of Paliambela. (ADelt 317-18) Stylida. Fragmentary architectural remains of a house (two rooms) of the middle of the 4th Ct BC, part of the urban network of the anc. town, built on the Hippodamian system, were dis- covered at the junction of Odos Papadiamante and Valaoritou.

Kyparissi-Apostolika (EPS) reports on the tenth season of excavation in 1996. The aims were to investigate further Mes levels, and continue excavation of MPal levels in order to reach those representing the earliest phases of use in the cave. Remains of the Mes period in Thessaly have only been identified in Theopetra. Near the cave entrance, the sandy texture of the deposits points to influx of humidity into the cave, contrary to the SW inner part of the cave where residues of burning in association with clay and greater numbers of flint tools suggest different uses of space contem- poraneously. Excavation of MPal levels in trenches H 10, 10, I 10 aimed to investigate the deep sediment lying immediately above the cave floor. Remains of intensive burning were located, but most impressive and extraordinary were the footprints of a five-year- old child across the floor area; C14 analysis of burnt material at 'Demokritos' dated the floor to 46,591 ? 1,655 BP. Other imprints, amongst which were those of wild boar according to the workmen, reflect a once lively working area, the earliest bearing traces of burning in the cave. The deepest sediment of trench Z8 was excavated to a depth of 5-5.60m in order to determine whether it was natural or anthropogenic, and reach the limestone cave floor beneath it. The deposit yielded a number of flint, quartz, and limestone tools bearing very early technological characteristics; as the sediment reflects an interval of wet climate in Pleistocene Thessaly (ca 45,000 BP), the earliest known Pal tools in Thessaly are represented in the assemblage. Underlying the deposit, at a depth of 5.60m, limestone stones possibly belong- ing to the natural cave floor were encountered. (ADelt 705-6) CENTRAL MACEDONIA Thessalonike Access to the new wing of the Archaeological Museum was rearranged as part of a general refurbishment, during which the exhibition of prehistoric antiquities was located in the new wing and a display area for books was created. The large travelling exhibition entitled 'Macedonians, the Greeks of the North' was shown in Rome, Buenos Aires and St Petersburg, Florida. In 1996 24 sites of the Thessalonike nome, 26 of the Kilkis nome, three of the Pieria nome, and three of the Chalkidike nome were declared archaeological sites. Protection zones were established around two sites of the Chalkidike nome (anc. Mekybema, anc. Akanthos). The 16th EPCA organized a per- manent educational programme, entitled 'Thessalonike, Queen of Philip'. E. Mertsou supervised the following archaeometric works in the museum laboratory: study of HL glass from Delos, EIA faience beads from Hagios Mamas in Chalkidike, metal analy- sis of gold objects from the cemetery at Pydna. The work is described in detail in ADelt 467-8. Agora. Excavation results at the anc. agora of Thessalonike were of limited scale, as priority was attached to the stabilising, conservation and restoration of the anc. buildings. In the SE section, beyond the limits of the agora of the mid- dle imperial period, excavation of rooms DN6 and DN7, S of the paved road, was completed, with study of the three pits which destroyed the floors of the two rooms. Excavation at the junction between Agnostou Stratiotou and Philippou roads revealed mud walls which define storage rooms, containing three pithoi found in situ; finds date this phase to the 2nd Ct BC. Work E of the HL buildings, at the comer of the archaeolog- ical site, brought to light the W half of a circular bath area with a very well-preserved white mosaic floor. A stone-built circu- lar construction came to light in the middle of the area, and 13 small-sized bathing tubs covered with mortar also were found around the mosaic floor (Fig. 105). The large wall crossing the area from E to W, which is presumably contemporary with the agora of the 2nd Ct AD, rests on the three northernmost baths.</page><page sequence="66">66 DAVID BLACKMAN by two built rectangular piers, by a column base, and traces of a second. (ADelt 423-4) Restoration work. The outer fence of the archaeological site was moved W in order to include the small public park in the archaeological site. The fence on the S was also moved outwards and the area gained was excavated. Thus the com- mercial road was revealed for all its length, and will serve as the visitors' route to the S section of the site, subsequent to its restoration. Restoration work in 1996 focused on the Odeion vh praefuru NOm are w trce I - and adjoining areas and on the Square. (ADelt 465-6) Dioiketerion Square. Two test trenches were dug, one at th- - i&lt;?4 circular room It ithe centre of the excavation area (ty) and one at its S side (cX/K) (Fig. 106). In the central test trench, the lst-Ct BC pottery revealed above 2nd and 3rd Ct BC pottery clearly indicates that there were two different construction periods. This is also prsmal surv; fshown by the fact that the superstructure of the R building clear- ly stands out from the clay-built foundation. An anonymous bronze coin of Thessalonike, dated to the early 2nd Ct BC, was the square was conafound at the end of the foundation of the earlier period. The Ii1 s *,( 5)ed fo dp' I+ masonry set in clay is dated to the LHL period. Beneath it remains of an earlier period were found, with pottery of the late 4th-early 3rd Ct BC. e a;-preseThe second test trench in the S of the site revealed the earli- in _ =oc cu p\| er foundation beneath the R level. This, along with the differ- entiation of the finds of the lower strata from those on the level of the floor (sherds, 2nd-3rd Ct BC amphora handles, a coin of Philip V), confirms the succession of levels also in this section. Evidence from both trenches attests the existence of an extensive LHL settlement, beneath the ER building or at least a 105. Thessalonike, agora: bath area large section of it. The height of the foundation indicates an To the N and S of this semi-circle two narrow corri- dors lead to other areas of the bath complex. The other half of this room lies beneath Agnostou ! - Stratiotou road. The praefurnium area was traced to the NW of the circular room. It is defined by a circular stone t wall set in mud, a small section of which runs 'I' ? - - , beneath Philippou road. A brick wall construction presumably survived from a later phase of the inneri I periphery of the furnace. To the E the praefurnium : l l l 4 area communicates with a piscina. With permission L c Ur from the Demos of Thessalonike to excavate beneath Agnostou Stratiotou Road, investigation of ' the square was conducted on the W and along the S crepis; 17 squares (5 x 5m) were dug, from a depth . of 16m down to the virgin soil. On the latter a frag- mentarily-preserved HL layer, showing an earlier 4 occupation of the square, presumably by work- t: -3 shops, can be dated to the late 3rd-early 2nd Ct BC. ' . - This layer was sealed with imported soil, and a new level occupied by workshops was created during the : s -X 1st Ct BC; this phase flourished at the time of Augustus. Only a few post-holes, presumably indi- cating temporary structures around an open agora, use were opened from this level, some of which were found sealed. }i- I. _= S wing, krypte stoa. A paved commercial road i X came to light as far as the ninth shop. S of this road, . from Odos Eidolon as far as the fourth shop, a wall defined the insula to the S.

Thessalonike, Dioiketerion Square: site _</page><page sequence="67">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 2001-2002 67 important settlement; pottery of high quality, of the late 3rd to 2nd Ct BC, points to its contact with various centres, including Macedonian ones. The earliest pottery finds are contemporary with or (possibly) earlier than the foundation of the polis. In the N of the site an underground drain of the R building was found resting on a stone-built wall with pseudo-isodomic masonry. Apparently the wall forms part of the superstructure of a late 4th-Ct BC building. The very limited investigation of its destruction level revealed, apart from pottery of the late 4th-early 3rd Ct BC, coins of Pyrrhos and Antigonos Gonatas and a Laconian tile stamped BAXIAIKOZ. This last phase, which can be clearly recognized and checked, was traced beneath the LR-ER public buildings. The fact that it is also revealed with the superstructure of a public building confirms that an area of the W sector of Thessalonike had an administra- tive use since its foundation. This raises the possibility that the location of the administrative centre of the city at the end of the 4th Ct BC formed part of a broader architectural programme. (ADelt 424-6) Arch of Galerius. Cleaning and restoration work continued in 1996. (ADelt 466-7) Palace of Galerius. Tests made along the W stoa for the construction of a mod. drainage pipe in the course of restoration works revealed an interesting stratigraphical pattern, similar to that of the N corridor and of the atrium: a destruction level with tiles 40cm beneath the Galerian mosaic-covered plastered floors. A central built water pipe 20 m long was revealed 50cm beneath the surface; it had been destroyed by the S perivolos and ran beneath the Octagon from N to S, with two side branch- es to the E for the provision of water to the LHL workshops. Two test trenches were cut beneath the S stoa, parallel to the S corridor, where part of a floor decorated with marble tesserae had been unearthed in 1994. HL pottery coming from the foun- dation trenches of the palace walls, was collected from surface levels. There followed a R destruction layer 1.25m deep, con- taining tiles and fallen wall-paintings lying on a mosaic floor. This destruction was caused by a fire and dates from the mid- 3rd Ct AD. Excavation was conducted also in area A, in front of the monumental staircase of the palace. Beyond the destroyed R phase, rubble masonry walls were unearthed, along with a num- ber of holes similar to those of the N corridor. Similar pottery finds (lamps, sherds of Megarian bowls, pyramidal-shaped loom-weights, figurines) demonstrate the expansion of the LHL workshop also into this area. A new test cut beneath the destroyed paved floor of the Octa- gon revealed a series of HL and R phases, earlier than the palace complex, and disproved the alleged prior existence of a rectan- gular room, contemporary with the complex. (ADelt 426-7) Restoration work on the central building complex and the stoas commenced in 1996. (ADelt 466) Macedonian Museum of Modern Art. M. Tsimbidou- Avloniti reports the recovery of ancient building remains, and a small section of the HL and R cemetery of Thessalonike, during work for the construction of the new wing of the Macedonian Museum of Modem Art. As most of the area had not remained intact in the mod. period, excavation by the Ephoreia brought to light only 8 tombs: 4 built R (i.e. 2nd-3rd CtAD) cist tombs, one hut tomb without burial goods and 3 HL pit tombs, without important finds. The most significant find was part of an anc. paved road, with a NW-SE orientation, 4.20 m wide, covered with carefully selected slabs and with a central gutter; the road extends beyond the W border of the excavated area. At the S comer of the site a second paved rectangular building of simi- lar construction was revealed. The road constitutes unique evi- dence of the anc. road network in the area. (ADelt 427) Late archaic temple. A. Tasia, Z. Lola and 0. Peltekis report on the peripteral in antis R temple, with Ionic architec- tural members and a SE-NW orientation, which was found dur- ing a rescue excavation in the W sector of the historic centre of the city; indicating that the late A temple must have been repaired during the Early Imperial period. Along the SW side of the temple, the five-stepped crepis, part of the A stylobate and a floor paved with marble slabs are preserved. A marble Ionic column base survives on the stylobate. Part of the SW side and the entire NW end of the temple are beneath Karaoli- Dimitriou and Antigonidon Square. Excavation of the SE end (the facade) and of the NE side was fragmentary; it was limited to sections of the stylobate and to parts of one step of the crepidoma. That there is no trace of the floor or of any marble architectural feature in the centre of the site and that more than 100 fragments from the temple's architectural decoration were built into the buttress walls in the basement of the later build- ing, now demolished, indicate the extent of the damage caused to the temple by later structures. The temple's bedrock founda- tions lay beneath the staircase, at a depth of 7m. The excava- tions yielded two statues: a larger than life-size, headless statue of Zeus Aigiochos, of Hadrianic date, and the marble 1 St-Ct AD torso of an emperor wearing a breastplate. Fragments from this LR temple were found in the 1930s in the immediate vicinity of the current excavation site and are on display at the entrance to the Sculpture Exhibition in the Thessalonike Archaeological Museum. The temple base and part of its stylobate were hasti- ly buried and their precise location is unknown. Locating this temple is of the utmost significance in determining the exact location of anc. Therme, which lay either in the wider Thessalonike area or beneath Thessalonike itself. The new dig was with certainty conducted at the original site of the temple, not least because an earlier poros building was found in a small test trench in the wing of the temple; and also because part of the superstructure of the entablature of a small A building was found built into the foundation of the wing. (AEMTH 14, 222-46) Byzantine Thessalonike. The 1995 excavations were contin- ued in 1996 on the acropolis (Heptapyrgion). The large funer- ary ECh basilica uncovered in the old prison vegetable gardens proves to be an important five-aisle structure. The E end of the apsidal structure was uncovered, and first indications suggest a number of building phases, but much of the masonry has been robbed, even during Byz times. The apse of the sanctuary pre- serves part of the synthronon steps for the seating of the clergy. Running behind the synthronon steps is a semi-circular corridor that appears to have served as a crypt. Two sets of steps led down to the crypt, from either side of the sanctuary. The crypt has its own small conch, and traces of three supports are pre- served on the floor. Burials ad sanctos found in the immediate vicinity suggest this may have been a martyrion or saint's shrine. Further investigation was made around the monument to determine the position of the atrium and existence of ancillary buildings. In the process, remains of an 'ancient' wall unrelated to the basilica were found at a depth of 4m, rising on its foun- dations to some height. These and related remains appear to have been disturbed and filled with the building of the acropo- lis walls, and therefore further excavation may shed light on the date of the walls' construction. (ADelt 481-3) LR-ECh building remains were found at 13 Stournara, with a second habitation phase dating to the Ott period. A female burial with two rings, and four more reburials were found in association with the earlier structures. (ADelt 483-5) Byz and LByz building phases were identified in remains of walls on Stournara and Serbion by the W walls. (ADelt 485)</page><page sequence="68">68 DAVID BLACKMAN Further investigation was made of the 58.50m of an anc. road uncovered on Plateia Kyprion Agoniston (Dioiketeriou). Running N-S, the road's width varied (4.80m at its widest), in association with LR and LByz structures on either side. Only a little evidence of paving was found to the N, along with part of the ECh drainage system. The earlier road was much changed by Byz interventions. No evidence was found for the LR water supply system, but Byz ceramic pipes were uncovered. The road appears to have been in use until mod. times. (ADelt 485-6) Possible remains of an ECh pottery workshop were found on Agiou Demetriou 50-2, at 4.50m. (ADelt 486) Other excavations for a natural gas line on the same street continued investigations of an ECh basilica (1st half of 5th Ct AD). The outline of the whole structure was established, and burials found from an earlier phase. At the Letaia gate, part of the anc. S section was found. Remains of square towers and tri- angular hollow ramps were also found, and are extensively reported. (ADelt 486-90) The same gas line excavations encountered vaulted tombs (3rd Ct AD) on Olympiados (ADelt 502). A R sarcophagus was also found on Olympiados and Eleni Zographou. It contained seven skulls, three copper coins and three pieces of woven material, one of which covered one of the skulls. Haematite beads and metal objects were also found. (ADelt 503) LR to Ott remains and moveable finds were uncovered at 3 Agapes. The LR remains are dated to after the 4th Ct AD. Impressive opus sectile and mosaic floors were found in the remains of a secular building. Pottery included coins and much pottery of the MByz period, including fine glazed ware from Constantinople. The area was used in LByz times as a cemetery, and the burials are summarized. (ADelt 490-3) At the junction of Dodekanesou and Demokratias square, continuous inhabitation was attested by moveable finds from the 4th to 20th Cts AD during a rescue excavation and investiga- tion of the site, although only ECh building remains of any sig- nificance were identified. An extensive deposit consisting exclusively of sherds of large amphoras was found, and these date to the 6th Ct AD (Cartagena type). The area must have been a market arcade, located as it is near to the harbour of Constantine. (ADelt 493-5) At the junction of D. Gounari and Bassou evidence was uncovered for inhabitation dating in three phases from the 4th to 16 Cts AD. A secular 4th-Ct AD building, parts of which had previously been uncovered (ADelt 29, 670), lies beneath a much disturbed Byz workshop with a pottery kiln, of which only the firing chamber is preserved. Evidence for ceramic production here from the 14th to 16th Cts also exists. (ADelt 495-6) On Agias Sophias 75 and Sophokleous, more evidence came to life of long habitation, from the HL to the early LByz period. The fourth phase (5th Ct AD) involved two large domi- ciles divided exactly in the middle of the anc. building block, which happens to be the same as the present one. The structures include an apsidal triclinium, the main oikos with a tribelum of Ionic columns, and three partly basement rooms. Swastikas and other geometric motifs decorate a mosaic floor in the oikos. The complex is extensively described, including the earliest HL and R phase, and a small workshop of the 3rd Ct AD. Much of the complex was inhabited until the 7th Ct AD, when it was dam- aged by earthquake. Habitation continued, however, on a im fill over the ruins. This MByz inhabitation is characterized by small-scale modifications and subdivisions of rooms. This situ- ation continues into LByz times, when the site appears to have been abandoned. The ECh well and cistern, however, remained in use in later phases. (ADelt 496-8) Evidence for the Hippodamian LR and ECh plan of the city, including a building on the Via Regia, was uncovered on 22 Patriarchou Ioakeim. Drainage channels of square section of the same period were found at 3 Parodos Esiodou. (ADelt 498-9) Habitation phases from LR to Ott were also encountered on 93 Agiou Demetriou and Pelopos. Wall remains of the 2nd-3rd Ct AD bore traces of painted (amorphic) decoration. This struc- ture was destroyed in ca 320 AD, on the basis of a coin found in the destruction layer, which included LHL pottery fragments, including terra sigillata of the 1st BC to 1St Ct AD. Also found here were two HL coins with inscriptions: AMIEOY, and OEEXAAONIKEQN. Traces of HL buildings, however, were not found. As other sites in the area appear to testify, HL remains were destroyed to their foundations prior to being rebuilt in R times. A second phase includes the remains of three rooms from the early 4th Ct AD. At the end of that century, a villa was erect- ed on the site, and remains of its triclinium were encountered. Byz phases were not found, and it seems that the complex was filled in by the 12th Ct AD, on the basis of glazed pottery and a coin found in the fill. Ott foundations for a fountain were found on top of this fill. (ADelt 500-2) Scanty remains of a possible R bath-house were encountered on 7 Ephaistionos. (ADelt 503) Paltry remains of two 15th-Ct AD kilns for the firing of clay structural features (tiles, bricks, etc.), were found on 91 Monasteriou (ADelt 504) A total of 24 burials of various types (cist, pit and free) of the 3rd_4th Cts AD were found on 6 Peleiadou. Three funerary ves- sels, glass fragments of phials of holy myrrh, one bronze coin and a bronze ring were amongst the finds. (ADelt 504) More burials (three cist and one tile-covered) were encoun- tered on Leophoros Stratou (in front of the 3rd Army Unit), part of the old cemetery of the city. Tomb 1 was completely lined with marble and contained two skeletons linked by a gold band. Tomb 5 also contained at least two burials, an oinochoe and a gold earring. The burials date to LR times. (ADelt 505) E. Marki reports on the finds from the 21 rescue excavations carried out by the Thessalonike EBA in 2000. These include: A hoard of 14 Byz gold coins in the mud fill of the Constantinian harbour, comprising 11 histamena of Basil II Bulgaroktonos and of his brother Constantine (976-1025), 2 histamena of Romanos III Argyros (1028-34) and I histamenon of Constantine Monomachos (1042-52). A cubical LByz water-tower, made of rubble masonry, with occasional bricks and lime mortar, which was excavated on a building plot at 8 Vlahava, in the Koule Kafe district. Finds along the N wall include a round clay conduit and a narrow lead connecting pipe. At the NE comer of the floor of the water- tower, a round opening (0.25m di. and of similar depth) was found; a piece of timber must have been embedded in this to indicate the level of the water. Part of the original structure of the Letaia gate (uncovered when the new pipeline carrying water from the Haliakmon was being laid at the start of Ag. Demetriou), consisting of part of the floor of the hexagonal courtyard of the Letaia gate and part of the wall of an earlier gate, which was uncovered 8m E of the floor of the gate and 1.20m beneath it. The excavator concludes that the Letaia gate was simple, located in line with, but high- er than, the corresponding R fortification gate; also that the so- called 'Vardar gate' was not the gate of that name in the Theodosian fortifications, but the gate in an earlier fortification or the triumphal arch-and-gateway built in AD 143 for Antoninus Pius' visit to Thessalonike.

It occupies half the width of the anc. insula, but its length has not</page><page sequence="69">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 2001-2002 69 yet been determined. The area investigated covers approxi- mately 450m2 (of a total of 750-1000m2) and was built on an embankment levelling the sloping ground. The house was planned around a central atrium with a peristyle, and surround- ing rooms were accessed through the peristyle stoas. The house had two reception rooms-the triclinium (mainly for banquets) and the (earlier, 4th-Ct) family chamber. A colourful mosaic floor, along with numerous coloured fragments of wall paint- ings with various decorative motifs (including human figures), form part of its opulent, elaborate decoration. Our picture of the house to the N is less clear. The existence of a central atrium in the S part cannot be confirmed, owing to the excessive damage inflicted by the later buildings. The main entrance of the house must have lain on the W side of Sophokleous, while the side entrance on the N side indicates the existence of a small decumanus. Lastly, the apsidal building to the W, presumably a refectory, and the subterranean barrel-vaulted cistern, may be interpreted as Byz monastery facilities established after the ECh earthquakes; they must have occupied the entire ancient insula. (AEMTH 14, 259-272) Toumba. Table. Rescue excavations were continued at the A and C settlement, whose stratigraphy also covers the EIA and the BA (AEMTH 10, 389-406). K. Soueref reports that EIA and A material had been randomly gathered at the W side of the plot at Odos Ibiskou 3. An attempt to extend the settlement west- wards during the 5th Ct BC is indicated by the pottery finds and by the architectural remains, as had been found earlier at the E side of the table, at Odos Kalabryton 20. Architectural finds reveal disturbed foundations and wall sections, presumably of a house. In addition to pottery, movable finds include clay lids of vessels for everyday use, loom-weights of various sizes, pierced disks made of clay, stone rubbers and millstones and LBA and EIA wishbone handles, along with A and C imported bg pottery, bases of pointed amphoras and a lamp sherd. This is the first time a section of the settlement has been unearthed on the bank of the stream. At the NE end of the table, the finds at the plot at Empedokleous 19 are closely related to those of the adjacent plot at Empedokleous 17 (ADelt 44, 321; AEMTH 3, 215-225; cf. AAA 23-28, 31-46). This is the E end of the rectangular reli- gious 5th-4th Ct BC building, with a loutron, a small well with a stone-built mouth, crossed by an artificial channel in its inte- rior (N-S). The 1996 finds include: remains of small stone agri- cultural HL and R constructions in the upper levels, which are not related with the organized phases of the A settlement; archi- tectural remains of stone foundations and superstructure which complete the building on the neighbouring plot; C sherds with an earthen floor, above the projecting stones which separate the foundation from the superstructure; two empty storage build- ings to the N, which functioned as storage pits or as small water cisterns. Similar buildings had been found in the W sector of the plot at Kalabryton 19 (ADelt 49, 440-4; AEMTH 8, 189-196, esp. 190-193). All buildings of the settlement are built in the red clayey earth of the table. This point marks the beginning of a different type of soft rock and the settlement did not develop beyond this point. Rubbish pits of various sizes, arranged in rows (2-5), were investigated at the plot at Protoleontos 19, beyond the N border of the Table. They contained broken, mostly Attic 5th-Ct BC vessels. A and C sherds were found during test trenching at Isidorou 31, 50 m NE of the ancient settlement. The systematic excavation that followed revealed two artificial water channels running E-NW and scattered sherds, but no building remains. G through to EHL finds were unearthed during rescue exca- vations at the Toumba cemetery, lying E, S, and SW of the anc. settlement. The tombs have been dug either in the natural clay or in the soft rock and many skeletons have been affected by the acid soil. At the school plot, between Papaeliaki and Kleanthous roads, SSE of the ancient settlement, lay five pit tombs covered with large schist slabs and with small stones between. Tomb 1 contained, exceptionally, a child cremation, with bronze wire elements and metal plates (some gilded), five small bronze buckles (along with a fragment of a sixth) and a small, gilded, clay bead. In the upper section of the tomb an amphora with a high neck and a small, handleless skyphos were found. On the floor, at the NW comer of the tomb, fragments of a Phoenician alabastron were found. Tomb 2, oriented NE-SW, contained fragmentary bones and, beneath the cover, a vessel of unbaked clay, presumably an ungentarium. Tomb 3, oriented E-W, contained few corroded bones. Finds include a kantharos, a handleless small skyphos and a C bronze coin. Tomb 4, oriented NW-SE, contained relics of a male burial. Finds on the floor included a large bf skyphos, a small clay gild- ed vessel-shaped bear, and an iron dagger. This tomb also held two rectangular cases along the shorter sides, beneath the floor, one containing a small, single-handled skyphos, the other sherds, bone fragments, an oyster and two bronze button- shaped objects with traces of wood. Tomb 5, oriented WNW-ESE, contained corroded (presumably female) bones, the skull facing W. Finds included a bronze 4th-Ct BC coin, a bronze ring and a bronze buckle. At the lot at Ag. Marinas 35, E of the ancient settlement of the Toumba, at the NE limit of the settlement, part of a destroyed A-C pit tomb with corroded bones was found, ori- ented N-S, without finds. Foundation remains of rubble masonry may have formed part of the cemetery, or perhaps remains of a previous settlement. Other BA and IA sherds were found scattered on the surface of the plot and presumably came from buildings ca 50m E of the borders of the main settlement. A monolithic sarcophagus with a covering poros slab, and E-W orientation, was traced at Hymettou 3, SW of the anc. settle- ment at Toumba. The skull was facing E, the bones were cor- roded naturally. The tomb contained gold plates, a mouthpiece, a gold ring, two iron knives and a ribbed bf kylix, dated to 520-510 BC. A monolithic poros sarcophagus, covered with poros slabs, with an E-W orientation, similar to that excavated at the Hymettou plot, was excavated near the PAOK football stadium; it contained a badly preserved skeleton, and a frag- ment of an undecorated vase. Five more pit tombs covered with slabs were traced nearby at Kleanthous road. The first one, oriented from N to S, was not opened, as its largest part lies beneath the road; the second (NW-SE) contained few plain sherds. Finds in the third tomb (NW-SE) include a hydria, a high two-handled small skyphos, terracotta figurines of a nursing-mother and a clay model of a small temple with an Eros relief in its interior, along with the corroded bones, and indicate a child burial. The fourth (NW-SE) had built rubble masonry walls and had been partly destroyed by earlier road works. Few corroded bones were found and the skull had been destroyed. A few pottery sherds, a shallow small skyphos without handles and a small bg kan- tharos, suggest a date in the late 4th-early 3rd Ct BC. Finally, tomb 5 (E-W) had been partly destroyed: the corroded skull was found at the E end of the tomb, the rest of the skeleton had been disturbed and a late 4th-early 3rd Ct BC lekanis constitut- ed the only find from this burial.

Arethousa: early Christian basilica junction of Sphaktirias, Avdiron and Lesvou Streets, directly E of the anc. settlement in Ano Toumba, where the pit-graves date to the 6th and 5th Ct BC. (c) Block 3 of the Municipality of Triandria (between Amorgou, Philikis Etaireias and Dagli Streets) yielded for the first time a section of the cemetery, W of the stream demarcating the anc. settlement at Toumba, with finds related to the tombs of the local aristocracy of the A period. (AEMTH 14, 215-225). Nome of Thessalonike Anchialos. The excavation conducted by M. Tiverios and by S. Gimatzidis on the double table at Anchialos focused on the upper table of the settlement and on the new trench A.0, which was opened next to trench A and reached LG layers; brick walls with stone foundations were traced at that level. Part of a wall with stone foundations survives from the phase dated to the 7th and early 6th Ct BC; the shallow fill indicates that the settlement presumably diminished in size during the above-mentioned period. The floor of a house violently destroyed was unearthed at the next level (2nd half of 6th Ct) along with household finds (e.g. a rectangular clay cooking basin and an oval clay tray). To the LA period date stone structures, which presumably belonged to a workshop, and a large refuse pit containing dis- carded building materials. The surface layer, containing 6th-4th Ct BC pottery, has been seriously disturbed. Movable finds include many bronze artefacts, a few stone tools, and large amounts of pottery. The amount and quality of the imported pottery found alongside the local wares offers sig- nificant clues to the dating of the G and A local pottery. (AEMTH 14, 193-203). M. Pappa, F. Adaktylou and Z. Billi report on the results of a rescue excavation that was carried out on an EBA mound at the 'Balkan Export' factory area, 1km from the Anchialos table. The excavation was confined to the settlement's two earliest construction phases and uncovered sections of rectangular houses identified through post-holes. The destruction level yielded many vessels and other finds, including many anchor- shaped objects, presumably loom-weights. The buildings form part of a wider urban fabric with a con- centrated population. Both construction phases should be dated around the middle of the EBA, i.e. mid-3rd millennium. (AEMTH 14, 137-144). Arethousa (10 km N of Rendina). On the 2000 season see now AEMTH 14, 117-24. The Finnish Institute at Athens continued the excavation of the ECh basilica at Arethousa in August 2001. The director of the project, Dr Arja Karivieri, reports: 'In 2001 excavation continued in the trench W of the narthex, which was expanded to the N, and new trenches were opened to the NE and E of the main aisle to reveal the N aisle and the outer walls of the church (Fig. 107). In 2000 (AEMTH 14, 117-124; AR 2000-01, 87-88), a thick layer of roof-tiles from the destruction layer of the church had been found in the trenches W of the basilica, and in 2001, when the trench W of the narthex was expanded, a hearth and two EByz amphoras were found in situ under the destruction layer of the church (Fig. 108). Both amphoras were quite well preserved, and they have been restored by the conservators of the 9th EBA. The same trench provided many LR and EByz coins, as well as ani- mal bones. The column base and the paving found in the S part of the trench in 2000 do not seem to continue northwards, out- side the entrance found in 1999. The hearth, the two amphoras, as well as the other finds from this trench seem to suggest the existence of economic facilities N of the church. There are two possible explanations for this: either the foundation of the colonnade was removed before the economic facilities came into use, or the presumed colonnade was restricted to the area SW of the square H 100 (Fig. 107). New trenches were opened in the whole N aisle, and we concentrated on revealing its outer walls and entrances. In the centre of the N aisle we found two parallel walls on a SW-NE alignment, which were covered with hydraulic plaster. This construction was probably the water reservoir of the church, but not necessarily during its first phase. A thick destruction layer was found in the N aisle, consisting of roof-tiles decorated with finger-grooves, as well as pieces of collapsed brick vaults. Some of the bricks were decorated with a star or a cross in relief, a definitive proof of the ecclesiastical function of the building. A separate entrance to the N aisle was found beside the apse, in the SE comer of the church. A marble basin was found near this entrance, inside the N aisle. The stratigraphy, wall analyses, the mosaics and opus sectile pavements, architectonic fragments, pottery, metal objects, lamps, glass items and coins that have been found between</page><page sequence="71">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 2001-2002 71 1999 and 2001 seem to point to a foundation date in the late 5th or early 6th Ct. It seems that the church was rebuilt at least once before it was abandoned in the late 6th or the 7th Ct. During the three field seasons, we have found altogether 122 coins, lots of pottery from different periods, pieces of metal objects, fragments of lamps and glass objects, a grave relief in marble, a marble basin, some architectonic fragments, such as an acanthus capital and two pieces of the choir screen, and lots of animal bones. Even though the destruction of the church can be dated to the late 6th or the 7th Ct, we even found evidence for a Byz settlement on the site: remains of walls and fragments of cooking ware and large pithoi. A continuation of the excavation in the N aisle is planned for the summer of 2002. Documentation and consolidation of the mosaics in the narthex and in the main aisle, as well as documentation of the wall paintings and plasters continued in 2001, before the pave- ments were again back-filled for the winter. The best-preserved part of a wall painting with vegetal motifs in the N comer of the narthex was removed for conservation by the 9th EBA. The con- servation of the mosaics is planned to continue in the summer of 2002, in co-operation with the 9thEBA.' Evangelismos Lagada. M. Pappa and F. Adaktylou report that a brief rescue excavation at a hitherto unknown settlement N of the village of Evangelismos near Lagadas yielded 15 pits with IA and MN finds; most pits had layers of rubble stones. (AEMTH 14, 187-192). Karabournaki. M. Tiverios, E. Manakidou and D. Tsiafaki report on the results from eight new squares and the continua- tion of five old squares in the anc. settlement. Modem con- structions, objects and horse burials had disturbed nearly all test trenches and damaged architectural remains of the settlement. Parts of the anc. settlement were revealed in most squares, including parts of pithos magazines and remarkably many stor- age rooms. At the SE comer of square 23-4Oa lay a large slab, along with bricks, baked and unbaked, and scattered rubble stones: the construction presumably served for baking or heat- ing food, i.e. it was a type of a hearth or oven. It was found with pottery of the LIA, transitional and middle Cor, and Ionian. Sherds from Chian, SOS and other pointed amphoras (probably E Greek) were also found. The S sector of the settlement is better preserved. Its archi- tectural remains comprised rooms, pithos magazines, and bee- hive-shaped, semi-subterranean constructions. The discovery of such structures already during the previous year confirms that they were characteristic of the settlement. (AR 2000-01, 89) Samples of earth were analysed by G. Valamoti, who con- cluded that the burnt seeds found in one of these constructions come from ancient bitter vetch, a kind of pulse used to feed ani- mals. This year's finds in square 27-893 included sherds and other objects, dating from the 7th to 5th Ct BC. The area has yielded a large number of both stone and clay objects, e.g. cover-tiles-mainly of Laconian type, loom-weights, lamps, sherds from various workshops. The sherds of pointed amphoras are linked to Athens, Corinth, E Greece (e.g. Chios, Lesbos, Samos, Ionian cities) and N Greece (e.g. Mende). Equally interesting is the imported Cor and Attic pottery, while two amphoriskoi for perfume, presumably from E Greek work- shops, have been found at this site. The construction of these buildings is dated to the A period (7th-6th Ct BC). The beehive-shaped structures were presum- ably working, storage and residential areas. The excavators favour the identification of these areas as 'argellae', well known in the Euxine. (AEMTH 14, 205-214) Kardia. Tombs were found 1500m NW of the anc. settlement table of Neon Rhysion, 0.30-0.90m beneath the surface level. No traces have been found of another nearer anc. settlement. The tombs include seven pit graves and a HL chamber tomb. Apparently this group of tombs belonged to a family; it may be dated, by its typology and chronology, from the mid-3rd to the mid-2nd Ct BC. (ADelt 445-6) Lete. Four 1 st-4th Ct AD farmhouses were unearthed in an area 2km from ancient Lete, during the construction work on the Egnatia Odos. The buildings, lying at a distance of 350m from each other, survive at foundation level and have been pillaged. The various rooms are laid around a rectangular courtyard. Farmhouse A, covering an area of ca 460m2 and dated to the mid-2nd Ct BC, is the best preserved. The entrance of the build- ing is on the E, and a courtyard lies at the centre, with the liv- ing and eating quarters along the N side; the rooms along the S side are related to agricultural activities. One may assume from a hoard of 12 bronze coins of Gordian III and of his wife Tarcyllina hidden in the building that the building was aban- doned temporarily; this may have happened during the mid-3rd Ct AD Gothic invasion. The building was finally abandoned at the end of the 4th Ct AD, after minor repairs and after the addi- tion of a triclinium to the E. Movable finds include terracotta lamps, terracotta and glass vessels, toilet articles, farm imple- ments, and a few fragments of clay figurines, representing the Mother of the Gods and confirming her cult in the area until the Late Imperial period (AEMTH 14, 153-168). Nea Eukarpia. Rescue excavations conducted by E. Lampro- thanassi revealed 95 pit graves, which are densely grouped and form part of an IA cemetery. Except for three uncovered tombs, most of the tombs excavated were pit graves, covered with schist slabs, with various orientations. Burials were often with- out grave goods, while most contained an undecorated, single- or two-handled, phiale-shaped vessel. The few female burials had some bronze jewellery (rings, bracelets, etc.). (ADelt 436) Nea Philadelpheia. Excavation continued of the foundations of rubble masonry IA buildings, whose upper parts were of unbaked brick. The two construction phases of two connected rooms that had been unearthed in the W section during the pre- vious year were explored; these form the earlier phase of a building which extends further W. Small constructions, hori- zontal platforms for grinding cereals, indicate that the E section of the building was partly open-air. The pithos storeroom that had been unearthed last year S of the buildings was fully exca- vated this year: 17 pithoi in total were revealed; they were pre- served in situ half-buried. An open area bordered on the S by a long supporting wall (15 x 0.60m), lies E of the buildings. To the N, temporary rubble masonry buildings of various shapes were presumably utilized for preparing food. Plain and painted local and G imported pottery has been unearthed. A Euboean skyphos with painted decoration of a lattice motif was found in a rubbish pit; it dates to the 2nd half of the 8th Ct BC. Nine scat- tered pits were found 65m E of the hill with the IA settlement, on the plain, which is 7m lower. Shallow trenches dug in the soil, of round or of ellipsoid shape (d. 0.28-0.82m, di. 1-2m), were found. LIA-EA hand-made and wheelmade pottery was scattered around; it comprised rg kylikes, grey jugs with angular handles, sherds of plain pithoi, amphoras and phialae and few sherds with G concentric circle decoration. Many oysters, ani- mal bones, a few iron small knives, loom-weights, etc. were also found. One may assume from these finds that the area may have been inhabited temporarily (cf. similar pits at Karabournaki Thessalonikes, AEMTH 9, 283-292).</page><page sequence="72">72 DAVID BLACKMAN At the R complex, which was excavated last year, supple- mentary excavations revealed in the SW section of the earliest building (A) a floor made of broken tiles bonded with lime mor- tar. The destruction level was removed from the later building (B). The absence of movable finds beneath the destruction level indicate that the building was abandoned before it col- lapsed. Inside the A and C cemetery, 100m E of the R buildings, a rectangular foundation (15.35 x 5.15m) was found; it was sep- arated into two rooms by a cross wall. A few sherds, along with the well-built rubble masonry, date this building to the R peri- od; remarkable is the absence of roof-tiles. A second, particu- larly long building (32.30 x 9.04m) was found 60m SW of the R complex. This has, at approximately equal spacing, six inte- rior buttresses projecting from the N and S long walls. The walls are of rubble masonry, ca 0,65m wide. Broken tiles, along with stones, have been utilized as construction material. No roof-tiles were found in this building either; the roof may have been made from branches or from other perishable mate- rial. Very little plain R pottery was found. This was a rural building related to the adjacent R complex. At the A and C cemetery lying S of the Table 21 more pit and cist tombs were excavated: 13 of them, all belonging to the 4th Ct BC, lie at the SW end of the cemetery, near and E of the R complex which was excavated last year; 3 more were found deeper down, beneath its foundations. Apparently the R com- plex was constructed at the S end of and partly over the earlier cemetery. The latter was abandoned already in the HL period. The earliest A tomb is dated by imported Cor pottery to 550-525 BC. Gold and silver jewellery (a gold mouthpiece, a gold bead, a pair of gold earrings, two pairs of silver pins) was found in a woman's grave along with a bg kylix of the 3rd quar- ter of the 5th Ct BC. Finally, 600-700 m W of the A and C Cemetery, a single pit grave was found, covered with a stone heap, without grave goods. (ADelt 442-4) Ossa. After an interruption of four years, A. Lioutas resumed excavation at the site of Kouri hill, in Ossa (province of Langada). This year's excavation at the N edge of the hill, con- tinuing the excavation of 1992, revealed the W wall of a room (int. 5.50 x 3.25m). The width and solidity of the walls of this room, and the next one to the N, indicate the existence of an upper floor. The wall had a central door opening, 1.25m wide, whose threshold shows the level of the ancient floor; this is also confirmed by the destruction level, including fallen wall stones and roof-tiles. There was no wall at the W side in the area S of the room. A rock-cut circular cistern was found and many sherds (from three or four amphoras) were collected. Four more storage pits for pithoi were found around the W and S walls of the room. Pottery comprises plain vessels for everyday use, Megarian bowls, bg kantharoi and 'West Slope' ware. More than 60 loom-weights confirm the existence of intense weaving activities. Coin, and pottery date to the 2nd Ct BC. The pottery collected from the deeper layers, W of the wall with the door opening, is similar to that of the upper layers-except for two fragments of N terracotta figurines, coming from a so far unknown PR settlement in the area. (ADelt 444-5) Pentalophos. At Sousamomylos NW of the archaeological site, 10 tombs were unearthed: 7 pit graves, 2 sarcophagi and a chamber tomb dating from the early 4th Ct BC through to the HL period. Finds included clay vessels (kantharoi, skyphoi- kylikes, jugs, a lamp, a skyphos, a small lekythos, a small phiale, jewellery, coins, etc. Cist tomb 3 was significant in terms of both size (3.26 x 1.50 x 1.60 m) and finds, which included three gold fibulae, a pair of gold earrings, and a silver tetradrachm of Archelaos. (ADelt 444) Polichne. A. Lioutas reports on a R stone-built channel used until mod. times. Rescue excavations at Nigritis 2 (Lebet Table) revealed another section of the anc. settlement, in addi- tion to that found in 1991-1992 at S. Venizelou 30. Two more lots were excavated on the slope and at the foot of the Table in 1993. The 20 tombs and eight room floors excavated in 1995-1996 were dated by pottery and fall into four phases between the mid- 9th and the mid-4th Ct BC. Rubble masonry was used in all foundations and footings of all construction phases, while the upper wall sections were constructed with unbaked brick traced in large areas of the E section of the excavation. The buildings were roofed with baked tiles, many of which have been found in an extensive destruction level at the N site of the excavation. Finds include loom-weights of various shapes, iron nails, smelt- ing residues, pottery sherds of various provenances, and an intact, empty, large pithos with a stone lid, which was found in situ. The total absence of coins leads the excavator to identify the inhabitants as farmers and stock-raisers; pottery imported from Ionia, Corinth and Athens dates from the mid-7th Ct BC onwards. Research so far reveals that the settlement occupied an area of ca 300 x 150m on the top and slopes of the Table and that it was inhabited from the 10th through to the mid-4th Ct BC, i.e. for approximately 650 years. (ADelt 434-6) Two watermills have been investigated on the Panormos stream, and on the stream cutting through Asbestochori and reaching the sea via Polichne. The ruins of watermill A include walls, the millstones and hand-held millstones, with the cistern showing two phases, the later enlarging the earlier. Remains of ancillary structures were also located. Watermill B, some 30m away, is of a similar type, but includes a tile cross in its mason- ry, surrounded by a brick arch. A third mill exists some 300m from the other two. The tower here is 4m high, to the level of the water spout, and its masonry is decorated with a tile cross and the inscription [D]X[D]In (i.e. 'light of Christ shine on all'), of which only two letters survive. Watermills A and B, on the basis of the few pottery and coin finds, may be dated to the 12th-13th Cts AD, and the other mill to a slightly earlier period. (ADelt 505-8) Sindos. The excavation of three building plots in the industri- al quarter of Sindos in 1999 and 2000 revealed 123 R graves oriented E-W (tile-, built- and pit-graves, jar burials); five large cist-graves were built with pebbles and lime mortar and utilized for multiple burials. Grave goods comprise terracotta and glass vessels, oil lamps, bronze and iron jewellery, bronze coins, all of the 4th Ct AD; they may be paralleled with finds from Thessalonike and from the wider area and with finds from other parts of the Balkan peninsula. This LR cemetery lies to the E of the A and C cemeteries of Sindos, in the space created when the bed of the Gallikos shifted eastward (AEMTH 14, 145-152). Souroti. K. Soueref and K. Havela report that of the 43 graves (pit, cist and tile) investigated at the 6th-Ct-HL cemetery at Souroti only five had no burial offerings and that a single bur- ial method, inhumation, was in use. To the SE of the cemetery, on a row of hills, lies the settlement to which this cemetery is related; it belongs to a group of PR and historical settlements N and S of the River Anthemous. The handmade pottery found in the exterior fill of the graves allows us to date the settlement from well before the 6th Ct BC through to the end of the 2nd Ct BC. (AEMTH 14, 169-178). Therme. Excavation of the anc. cemetery in the NE of the mod. settlement was continued in 1996. Rescue excavations at the junction between Hero6n Polytechneiou and Makedonias</page><page sequence="73">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 2001-2002 73 revealed another section (cf. AEMTH 10, 477-490, n. 1). Of the 160 burials, 79 were anc., 17 were post-Byz and 67 were mod. (early 20th Ct AD). The Ch, post-Byz and mod. burials, with a consistent E-W orientation, were pits scattered or in groups (particularly the mod. ones); they were distributed either on top of or among the anc. tombs, which they had often destroyed. The tombs were opened in a dense layer of small cobbles and pebbles, presumably flood deposits. Few cremations have been traced. There were a few IA tombs, often large and of an ellip- soid shape. The pits were often defined with small stones and their walls were covered with small cobblestones. They were occasionally also covered with schist slabs. Most finds were bronze ornaments of a common Macedonian type. Most of the tombs were A, with an E-W orientation. Apart from the pit graves, most of them were cist tombs, made of long schist or poros slabs and covered with similar slabs. In many cases a heap of cobblestones covered the whole (or part) of the tomb. In nine secondary burials the ashes of the dead were in cinerary vessels or pits of various sizes which indicates that cremation was also a common practice. There was also an inhumation in a pointed pithos. Most burials, particularly those in the cham- ber tombs, were pillaged already in antiquity, hence they were found disturbed. Many still contained imported pottery (Cor, Att), which in some cases was found with local pottery and locally produced ornaments similar to the IA ones. The few C graves (mid-5t-late 4th Ct BC) were pit tombs, which in many cases were demarcated with stones. They were normally not covered, but some were covered with schist slabs; finds included a few ornaments and pottery, mainly bg skyphoi. The post-Byz tombs (oriented E-W) were pits scattered or in clusters (as were those of the 20th Ct), arranged above or between the earlier tombs. Post-Byz tombs often contained more than 2-3 burials, including child burials, and they were often in secondary use. They contained glazed pottery, 15-16th Ct cups of various sizes; burials of the early 20th Ct contained porcelain cups or small glasses, while women were buried with their jewellery (rings, bracelets, crosses, necklaces of Turkish silver or bronze coins, etc.). At the junction of Hero6n Polytechneiou and Iasonidou 43 A burials (mostly LA) were found, 24 of them pit graves covered by schist or poros slabs. Finds included pottery (local, import- ed or imitations of imported vessels), terracotta figurines, bronze ornaments imitating those of the IA. Some tombs date to the 4th-early 3rd Ct BC and the commonest finds include small bg pottery and bronze coins of Philip II and Cassander; 14 of the remaining tombs were A cist graves. There was also a poros sar- cophagus, along with three burials in large pithoi (late 6th-early 5th Ct BC). Finally two EHL tile-covered tombs were found. A group of five tombs was excavated at the junction between Pontou and Makrygianni, at a depth of ca 2-3.50m; three tombs had been located there in 1995 (cf. ADelt 50, 464). As three out of the five new tombs were successive, each tomb had partly destroyed the earlier one; they were initially covered with schist slabs. The IA finds in the deepest tomb (T5) included two gold metal plates with relief and with incised decoration and a gold biconical necklace; tomb T7 had bronze LIA / EA jewellery along with female bones; tomb T4 also contained A ornaments. At the junction of Pontou and Mandelara, five presumably LIA tombs with various orientations were found. With the exception of one, built with baked bricks, these were pit graves. Except for one tomb containing a bronze spiralled IA necklace, the tombs contained no movable finds, and hence are hard to date. These tombs (with a N-S orientation) had been con- structed on top of or between two almost parallel trenches dug in the natural soil. These trenches may be related to the adja- cent table, but it is hard to determine whether they functioned as drainage trenches or whether they protected the anc. settle- ment on the table. No architectural remains were traced, and most of the 5th4th Ct BC pottery found comes from the table. Red glaze, Ionizing kylikes or phiale-shaped vessels with a spout, with a flat base and thin walls, are a type of 8th-6th Ct pottery common around the Thermaic gulf. To the same period dates the large number of locally made, Ionizing amphoras with painted banded decoration. EA Chian amphoras are also found. The lowest levels above the natural soil, along with the fill of the tombs, contained IA and A pottery. Local painted IA pottery was decorated with concentric circles or with other geometric motifs. There is also contemporary rough, wheelmade pottery. The trenches, which yielded LIA pottery, predate the tombs; the relationship between the trenches and the settlement of the table, and the earliest phases of the settlement require defini- tion, but the archaeological evidence available so far fails to answer these questions. (ADelt 436-41) Ancient settlement. Excavation at Chalkidikis at the SW fringe of the slope of Therme table revealed only remains of a wall built of rubble and clay; it was oriented NW-SE, 27m long and 0.80-0.90 m wide. The upper section of the wall had col- lapsed into a pile of stones extending along the SW side of the wall. A bronze coin (posthumous issue of Alexander) on the pile of stones dates the wall collapse before 325 BC, i.e. before the synoecism of Thessalonike. The wall is interpreted by E. Skarlatidou as a peribolos of an open area. A test next to the wall shows that the deposits here reached 4.20m below the sur- face level. The upper fill contained 4th and 5th Ct BC pottery. Beneath this level a heap of stones from a demolished wall con- taining 6th-Ct BC pottery was revealed. Just as in the case of the table deposits, the stratigraphy here resulted from the col- lapse of walls and buildings. The wall must belong to a 6th-Ct BC building; this leads to the assumption that at least at that period the SW part of the table was covered with buildings. (ADelt 441) A. Keramaris reports two pit graves found 2.50m beneath the surface and dated to the HL period. A rescue excavation 25m N of the Table of Thermi at a depth of 1.20m revealed two similarly built constructions, the former with irregular shape (2.10 x 2 x 1.20m), the latter with ellipsoid shape (3 x 1.75 x 1.40m). The subterranean section was dug in the natural soil and internal walls and the floor were covered with clay. The upper level, which is not preserved, was built of rubble and clay and it was presumably vaulted. Finds indicate a date in the late 8th-early 7th Ct BC. (ADelt 441-2) M. Pappa, S. Nanoglou and A. Nitsou report that the sys- tematic investigation which started in the E part of the flat Neolithic settlement at Thermi yielded clusters of pits of vari- ous sizes and with various contents, i.e. serving different pur- poses. The settlement may be dated through pottery to the early part of the LN period; work continues. (AEMTH 14, 179-186). Nome of Chalkidike Apollonia in Mygdonia. P. Adam-Veleni reports on the exca- vation of a cemetery dated to the 2nd half of the 4th Ct BC, com- prising 16 tile- and 2 pit-graves, 2 jar burials and 2 cremations; the cemetery was found through a chance find of a wreath of gold ivy leaves handed into the Archaeological Museum in Thessalonike and of a statue of Nike, found in Nea Apollonia. The excavation of two earlier kilns, which were found in the same area and which had been destroyed by tile-graves of 350-300 BC, indicates that the area had earlier had a different use. The area immediately outside the city was presumably occupied by workshops during the 5th and the 1st half of the 4th Ct BC; one large and one smaller kiln fell into disuse for some years: the firebars of the larger one had been destroyed and the</page><page sequence="74">74 DAVID BLACKMAN smaller one collapsed nearly completely. After they were destroyed and the workshops ceased to operate (they were prob- ably relocated outside the E city wall), the site was used for burials. Two tile-graves with burial offerings of 350-300 BC rest upon the kilns. A rather small, 2-chamber, barrel-vaulted Macedonian poros tomb (5.20m long) also lay in the wider area of the same S cemetery; this came into light when treasure-seekers attempted to enter the tomb by removing one of the stones from the bar- rel-vault. Only the entrance survives structured: it was sealed with five poros blocks. The burial chamber was separated from the antechamber through a recess in the barrel-vault: this is a unique feature only ever seen in this particular monument. Work started on uncovering the wall in an effort to locate the city boundary. A 230m stretch of the E wall, a 515m stretch of the N wall, ca 70m of the W wall and 30m of the S wall were found. A total length of 834m was uncovered (of an est. total of 3100m). The wall, 2.20m wide, is made of poros blocks built in the Egyptian style, i.e. with trapezoidal blocks alternating with smaller flat stones inserted between them. A total of 12 cist-graves (10 R, 2 ECh) was found along the N wall; eight graves were excavated. (AEMTH 14, 273-290). Gomati. E. Trakosopoulou-Salakidou reports on the rescue excavation conducted on the occasion of the construction of the provincial Gomati-Ierissos road at Kalogerika, ca 1200m NE of Gomati towards Ierissos. The excavation partly revealed a cemetery. Movable finds such as a burnt aryballoid lekythion date the initial use of the cemetery to the mid-4th Ct BC, while its use during the 1st half of the 2nd Ct BC is confirmed numis- matically. Numismatic evidence also confirms the continuing use of the site from the 1St half of the st Ct BC through to the mid-4th Ct AD. The section of the cemetery revealed is dense- ly arranged at a single level following the slope of the hill. Several, often adjacent, burial periboloi, mainly circular but some ellipsoid or orthogonal, contained one or more burials. In few cases, a single peribolos contained two tombs, and were presumably family burials. In fact, burial peribolos 1, though badly preserved, contained a group of four 1st-Ct AD tombs. The prevailing orientation is NW-SE and 42 tombs of various types (35 pit graves, 3 rectangular stone-built tombs, 3 tile-cov- ered graves and a pithos) have been unearthed. A preference for cremation is attested (29 certain cases as against 13 cases of inhumation). Tomb 8 has certainly been used more than once. The presence of iron nails in only five burials does not indicate the extensive use of wooden biers, which was the norm during this period. There are also few indications of the use of a head- rest (2 cases). The date and exact age of the dead remain uncer- tain; a baby burial and one of a child have been attested. With four exceptions, all burials have grave goods; those finds whose placement into cremation graves was contemporary with that of the dead have been affected by the fire, whereas those placed into the graves at a later stage are nearly intact. Grave goods reflect a community with a medium standard of living, com- prising few objects such as bronze buckles, iron shoe nails, clay and glass vases, etc.; 8 silver and 106 bronze coins in total have been found in approximately half of the burials. One of the earliest burials dates to the third quarter of the 1 St Ct BC, for it contains bronze issues of Thessalonike, represent- ing the issue dated after the victory of the triumvirate at Philippi (42 BC) and the first issue under Octavian (27 BC). The most characteristic of the 1 St-Ct AD finds are plain bell-shaped small skyphoi and glass vessels, clay lamps, etc. The group of burials closes with pit grave 3 containing a hoard of seven bronze coins of the Thessalonike mint, five of which at least have been issued at the time of Constans. Two pavements E of the cemetery area may have been used for the drainage of rainwater and they may have contributed to the stability of the road. (AEMTH 14, 359-66) Ierissos (anc. Akanthos). E. Trakosopoulou reports that the excavations of the Ephorate focus on rescue excavations on the seashore of mod. Ierissos in the anc. cemetery area, and on a section of the polis. Excavation at plot 180, though incomplete, covered a large part of the plot. It has so far yielded 183 C and HL tombs, including 10 animal burials (6 horses, 4 dogs). One burial (no. 9008) was of an Akanthian, whose feet were bound with iron fetters (cf. AEMTH 7 (1993) 414, with relevant bibli- ography). A section of a funerary peribolos or of a different building, found in the E sector of the plot, remains unexplored. At the E end of the necropolis, after research into a Med cemetery was completed by the 10th EBA, the 16th EPCA con- tinued excavating the C building remains. Excavations revealed a section of a HL workshop with two pear-shaped kilns, fragmentarily preserved, containing no finds. In the wider necropolis area a building was also found at the centre of lerissos town, at the junction of Stratou and Socratous roads. In a brief rescue excavation a section of a rectangular building was found; its sides were 11.70m, with a SE-NW orientation. The rest was covered by the adjacent plots and houses. What sur- vives are its foundations, made of well-dressed blocks of local granite, lying over A tombs. It may have been a funerary mon- ument, a hero6n, but it may also have been dedicated to a chthonic deity, such as Cybele. Movable finds, comprising fragments of marble objects, such as Ionic columns and a lion mane, along with the late 5th-Ct BC bronze coins of Akanthos and of Macedonian kings, fail to elucidate its function. Excavation of the probably C temple at Alonia on the high- er plateau was continued on a large scale. The foundation is not preserved at all in its interior, only the technical preparation and flattening of the natural limestone bedrock (sekos 12.30 x 6.50m, pronaos and the opisthodomos 6.50 x 3.25m, foundation walls 1.10-1.20m w.). Excavation of the three round pits with a conical bottom at the edge of the sekos, which presumably ante- date (or possibly postdate) the temple yielded only few sherds and roof-tile fragments. Excavation of the building at Ladiava, especially in room A, continued through the destruction level of the roof, to a depth of ca 3.75m. A rectangular room A2 includes in the continuation of the N side of A a small storage room (?), which might be related to later interventions in the building. Excavation ended at the compact destruction level of its roof. The adjoining room B was utilized during at least two successive periods: in its ear- lier construction phase it functioned as a pithos store, but it was transformed later. Pottery includes sherds of Megarian bowls, which are fewer in deeper levels, 4th and 3rd-Ct BC sherds, ter- racotta figurines, stamped handles of pointed amphoras, along with bronze coins coming primarily from room A; loom- weights; a few lamps. (ADelt 451-2) Kalamoto. K. Sismanides reports on the large, unusually shaped, built chamber tomb (interior dimensions 3.15 x 6.50m) found ca 500m S of Kalamotos, lkm from the site of anc. Kalindoia. The monument, which has presumably been broken into several times since antiquity, is horizontally roofed with a row of 11 well-dressed marble slabs; the roof formed a rudi- mentary pediment at the plain faqade. A stepped dromos led to the facade; the walls were irregularly built with small, mainly slab-shaped, stones and had a white plaster covering. Traces of red and blue colour also survive on the plaster. The entrance opening was as wide as the antechamber and had been blocked up with a strong wall, except for the upper part, where the wall</page><page sequence="75">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 2001-2002 75 had been demolished. The tomb consisted of an antechamber and two chambers, A above and B below (Fig. 109). A small, elaborate marble entrance was found between the antechamber and chamber A; it had a proper door of marble, which had been broken and lay on the ground. The relief decoration on the doors was identical to that on doors of Macedonian tombs. The entranceway (1.53 x 0.70m) was framed with marble and the lintel facing the antechamber had two mouldings. Upper cham- ber A is considerably wider than the antechamber and it had a floor of thick, well-jointed marble slabs. The floor slabs of chamber A form the ceiling of the secret chamber B below. Chamber B was slightly smaller than the first chamber; because it was secret, and because of its luxurious construction, it may be identified with the main burial chamber. The only non-mar- ble surface was the floor, which was paved with large grey- green slabs. Around the top of the marble facing runs a plastic cornice-like decoration. Grave goods included sherds of 8 small handleless skyphoi, 5 lamps, 4 plates, 9 fusiform unguen- taria, 2 pyxides, 3 bg kantharoi and fragments of gilded bronze wreaths (leaves, stems, fruit), spherical or tubular gilded neck- lace beads, iron nails and other rod-shaped pieces of metal. Finds, particularly pottery, and certain archaeological features show that the tomb was used over a very long period (early 3rd-mid-2nd Ct BC). (AEMTH 14, 125-135). Kriaritsi Sykias. Excavations in 1998-2000 on sites 1, 2, 3 and 5 revealed an EBA settlement and 4th- and 3rd-Ct BC farm buildings. Site 1 yielded architectural remains of three habita- tion phases, from EBA through to the historical period. The site is related to the burial mound on site 7, which was excavated 500 m to the SE. Site 2 revealed a single-cell square, probably agricultural building (6 x 6m). Excavation of the N sector of site 3 revealed a circular HL building (max. ext. di. 8m, max. int. di. ca 6m) almost half of which was destroyed when the road was built. The masonry of the exterior facade consists of well-dressed local granite blocks laid in opus isodomum; the less meticulous internal masonry consists of dressed and semi-dressed stones. To the immediate S of the circular building, a 2-level, 200m2 storage cellar was revealed, containing 22 regularly arranged pits. The circular building and the cellar were in simultaneous use, and the fortified site served agricultural and commercial purposes. Site 5 yielded remains of two buildings (A and B) and two circular structures, all for agricultural use. Building A was a courtyard with two rooms on the E side with workshop- like structures. Building B revealed three construction phases: circular R structures I and II; a 4thth-3rd Ct BC rectangular building with extension; and a 5th-4th Ct BC storage cellar. Finds confirm the use of this area for agricultural purposes and home handicrafts from the EBA through to the R period. (AEMTH 14, 331-46) Mavrolakkas near Olympias. K. Sismanidis reports on the archaeological investigations carried out in the area in 1999-2000. Surface investigations showed that the proposed site for the construction of mining installations by TVX Hellas Company was strewn with archaeological remains, mainly HL. Geophysical investigations located a number of antiquities, mainly N and NW of the area of specific interest to TVX Hellas. Systematic excavations conducted at sectors A, B, F yielded the following: surface investigations at sector A, to the E of the marsh lake, located a level elevation of the terrain for 11 m; the subsequent excavation confirmed that this was a stone-built structure 2.50m wide, resembling a fortification wall. The dat- ing and identification of the site remain open. A 50m stretch of a straight stone structure identical to that in sector A was :TOMH B- e KAAAM~TO E2EAAONIKH 2000 t~BA~I E O AAAMOTOS TAHOI Sh\i~~~~~~x\\t~ x, e 109. Kalamoto: chamber tomb unearthed in sector B, ca 500m S of sector A and with similar uncertainty over date and identification. Equally problematic in regard to dating is an almost rectangular paved structure (5 x 10m), which was explored directly to the E. This was presum- ably a place where large animals were slaughtered. Some 60m further W the comer of a stone structure was uncovered; at the N end of the same area, an important EHL building (probably a large house) has started to be excavated. Excavations focused on sector F, which is at the centre of the area of specific inter- est to TVX Hellas, and yielded the remains of some anc. build- ings, as well as of a rectangular Ott building. The stratigraphi- cal evidence relating to pottery, other movable finds, and 43 coins indicates that the buildings investigated here date to between the mid-4th and the 1St Ct BC; these represent three construction phases. Despite considerable damage in the past, a number of buildings are satisfactorily preserved. These are mainly workshops, storage and residential areas. Five pottery kilns, two large rectangular and three smaller piriform ones, have also been uncovered. These were used for firing mainly unpainted pointed amphoras, smaller vessels and large Laconian roof-tiles and they date to the end of the 4th Ct BC. The excavator proposes that Stageira was rebuilt by Philip II not on the highland site of the earlier city but in the lowland area of Mavrolakkas, where there was easy access to water, fields, min- erals and timber. This hypothesis is supported by the fact that all architectural and movable finds produced by the excavations date to after the time of Philip II. (AEMTH 14, 347-58) Nea Kallikrateia. The rescue excavation of parts of a previ- ously unreported LA-mid-4th Ct BC settlement, to the W of the PR mound, revealed part of the fortifications, public buildings, deposits and a cemetery dating from the IA to late antiquity (78 graves). The C graves apparently relate to the nearby anc. set- tlement. The lack of epigraphical data renders the settlement difficult to identify. (AEMTH 14, 299-310). L. Toska and G. Chatzakis report on the ECh antiquities of the 4th-6th Ct AD, which were revealed during the construction of drainage systems at villages of Chalkidike. The ECh tombs found at Nea Heracleia can be linked with the famous coffin of the Museum of Byz Culture. A late antique tomb at the settle- ment of Agios Pavlos provides us with the earliest information about an ECh settlement previously known only from the 13th Ct. An ECh settlement was also unearthed at Nea Kallikrateia in the SE part of the settlement. Some rubble and mortar walls were unearthed at foundation level, along with a floor made of bricks, a small cistern and a well. Coin finds and most sherds date to the 4th-6th Ct AD. At the SW end of Kallikrateia, on the hill, an area 14 x 7m was excavated and a 4th-6th Ct AD wine-press complex revealed. Further W and uphill, a section of the baths occupies 100m2. The tepidarium and the caldarium (with the praefurnium)</page><page sequence="76">76 DAVID BLACKMAN belong to its initial phase. At a second stage, the rectangular area behind the praefurnium was added. A third period brings a change of use of the bath. Two rubble masonry walls were added at the NW side of the building, access to the praefurium was closed and a child burial without grave goods was found in it. Constructional features, pottery and a 4th-Ct AD coin date this phase between the 4th and the 6th Ct AD. In the absence of later finds it is assumed that all three phases of the baths were constructed during this period The remains of a destroyed kiln were found at the W of the settlement, along with the remains of three plastered rubble masonry walls, which are preserved at a h. of 50-70cm. Fresco fragments were traced at the SE side of the test trench; a large number of excellently preserved glass tesserae, in various colours (blue, red, green, gold), were found at the centre of the building, which is dated through pottery finds to the 4th-6th Ct AD. An empty thesaurario with an incised inscription and an impressed depiction of Christ with two doves on a pseudo- arretine plate come from the 6th Ct AD, while a coin of Justin I and a coin of Theodosius I, found close to each other, confirm the building's date between the late 4th and late 6th Ct AD. (AEMTH 14,311-19) Nea Roda. E. Tsigarida reports on the A-HL sanctuary, which is connected with the two prominent cities of the area, Sane and Ouranoupolis. An A oikos and an EHL temple have been exca- vated; excavations at a group of buildings S of the HL temple were continued in 1996. A principal monumental construction was recognized; sections of only two walls, more than lm wide, have been revealed. An inscription fragment must have come to light during agricultural works, since it had been ripped vio- lently from a wall S of the HL temple. It is stoichedon, written in the Ionic alphabet and dated by the form of the letters to the 5th Ct BC, a time for which there were hitherto no archaeologi- cal data for the temple. The text is broken on the left side but 12 lines have been partly preserved; it is nearly impossible to reconstruct the text. A few words may be restored: e.g. [I]EPO; [M]EHON, [AH]MOHIHI. These few words, i?pov, LF?oov, 65rlooia etc., presumably indicate that this text was a horos of the temple. (ADelt 450-1) Olynthos. N hill. The houses of building block AIV were cleaned; houses A2, A3, A4 and A6 of the westernmost insula A were excavated and the ancient paving of road B, along the S side of blocks AVI, AV and AIV, was located. Research on the W side of houses A2, A3, A4 and A6 enabled the excavators to locate new rooms but their western end, which is identified with the outer wall of the houses and with the defensive wall of the city, was not revealed. The absence of destruction layers includ- ing roof-tiles from all the W rooms might indicate a flat roof, which was utilized by soldiers, since, according to D.M. Robinson and M. Andronikos, the city wall was connected with the W rooms of the houses of row A. The total destruction of the city wall in this area might be taken to indicate that the troops of Philip II invaded, occupied and destroyed the polis through this wall section in 348 BC. Road B was excavated for a length of 100m, along building block AVI, from the E outlet of the stenopos between AV and AIV. A destruction layer with roof-tiles covered the road. The very small, densely packed tile fragments must have constitut- ed the level of the road after the city's destruction, for as long as the Macedonian garrison remained in the area. Beneath this layer lay 7m of a central drain, at a depth of 1.30m and with a width of 0.65m. It was covered by large schist slabs, reinforced with rubble. Five bands of paving were preserved (1. 6m, w. 1.20m each) covering the central 4.20m of the road; the rock may have been dressed naturally to form a raised pavement on either side. The bands presumably protected the road and the houses from flooding after rain. The rest of the road was cov- ered with gravel, fragments of tiles and stones; the natural rock used where possible. Finds in the destruction level and on the surface of the road include many metal objects, particularly nails of various sizes (bronze, iron and lead), hinges and clasps, which are presumably derived from wooden constructions and portable benches along the road, where shops were located. (ADelt 446-9) At Olynthos, during German excavations of the PR toumba of Agios Mamas, evidence for a LByz (12th-14th Ct AD) grain storage depot and cemetery was uncovered. A single-aisle church was discovered with three building phases, which included use of anc. spolia. Tiny wall-painting fragments of uncertain date were encountered. Most of the pottery found on the site was not Byz, however, a situation explained by the incline on which the later settlement was built. The German excavators have already discovered Byz material at the foot of the tumulus, providing a date via pottery and coins of the 12th-13th Ct AD. The site may have been associated with a metochion of the Vatopedi monastery in the region. (ADelt 512) Potidaia. D. Kousoulakou reports on the building complex which was unearthed during the widening of the road Moudania-Kassandreia, SE of the modem settlement, with a view over the Gulf of Torone. The earlier construction of the local road E of the archaeological site had greatly damaged the site. Two main adjacent buildings, along with related construc- tions, were unearthed; at the SE end of the area a comer of a later structure of rough rubble masonry has been found. Of the earlier buildings building A is fragmentarily preserved: a comer of walls with a N-S (13m) and an E-W (8m) orientation, of large stone blocks. This building is made of architectural ele- ments in secondary use. Two blocks of grey stone, with curved exterior, might come from a round building (di. 9-1 lm), possi- bly a public building. After abandonment the area was covered with a layer of clay. The finds of this area include Cor, Att, Ionic and local pot- tery, lamps, clay loom-weights (plus a smaller one made of glass), various figurine fragments, a bronze horse-shaped neck- lace, bronze hooks, arrowheads, lead almond-shaped bullets; also coins of Alexander III, Cassander and Antigonos Gonatas. The N half of the excavation area was covered by a thin destruction layer with small tile sherds. Building B, which was found here, has walls with isodomic ashlar faces filled with smaller stones, and without material in secondary use. At least two rooms have been defined in building B, with an entrance in the E room. The walls are preserved at a high level (1.80m), but the continuation of the walls to the N is missing. The rec- tangular pier to the W may have been a column base, thus indi- cating the existence of a roofed courtyard. Further N, beneath a destruction layer of tiles, later walls than building B were revealed. At a lower level, a clay pipe is presumably connected with building B. Fills here have yield- ed 'W slope' and other pottery, many figurines, coins of the 1st half of the 4th Ct BC, as well as coins of Cassander and above all of Antigonos Gonatas. A peculiar structure between the two buildings confirms the idea of the sacred nature of the area. It is circular and made of sections of cover-tiles vertically fixed in the ground. Bf and rf Attic sherds were found, among which there was a fragment of a kylix-skyphos of the Haimon Painter workshop (480 BC) and a skyphos of the CHC group (500-490 BC); a Cor hydria and a kotyle, Cor kore figurines of the early 5th Ct BC, a bronze hook, a spearhead, a spoon and an almond- shaped lead bullet, carrying the legend MEP/NA.</page><page sequence="77">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 2001-2002 77 One might assume that the area was a covered room for storage of votive offerings and possibly for ritu- als. It is uncertain whether the round structure func- tioned as a funnel for liquid offerings (Metroon Verginas, Poseidi) or as an altar of some kind, as its interior has not yet been investigated. The date of the finds in this room indicate that it was in use throughout the 5th into the 4th Ct BC; it was pre- sumably abandoned on account of a natural phe- nomenon, such as a flood. Whether building B remained incomplete or not remains uncertain until L the excavation is complete. To the NW of the mod. settlement of Potidaia, on the Thermaic Gulf side, a second important building, presumably of religious function, was found. This is a rectangular, temple- like building, with a N-S orientation, whose E long side runs along the sandy shore, while its W side is covered by the sea; thus its foundation course has been disturbed, and the upper courses have been destroyed; 8m of the E wall of the building have been drawn and a further 8m can be made out, perhaps more. Architectural remains, of mixed material in secondary use, need to be studied further. D. Kousoulakou identifies the building as a R temple of Poseidon, on the basis of several lead weights from fishing nets, and the torso of a statue of the Antonine period. She is tempted to identify this building with that found on the W coast by S. Pelekides in 1928, but she recognizes the difficulties in relating this temple with that of Poseidon, outside the city walls, which is mentioned by Herodotus (VIII.29). (AEMTH 14, p. 321-329) Sane Kassandras. Remains handed in by a fisherman to the 10th EBA in 1995 indicated the existence of a Byz or post-Byz shipwreck at Stephani, the first to be found off Chalkidike. The EMA sent a diving teams in 1995 and 1996, when the wreck was found at a depth of 30.5m and 500m off shore, lying in mud which offered good prospects of hull preservation. The visible remains of the cargo were planned (Fig. 110), and glazed and unpainted pottery and plaques were raised (Fig. 111). The glazed ware seems similar to, but not identical with, Talbot-Rice's 'marbled ware', which he dated to the 15tL17th Cts. A 17th-Ct date for the wreck is cautiously proposed; the finds will add much to our knowledge of 15th-17th Ct pottery. (ADelt 733-5) Sarte. S. Asouchidou reports on the remains of three private buildings with two main phases uncovered during rescue exca- vations. The earlier remains (a row of stones, post-holes and pits containing large amounts of LR pottery, along with car- bonized viciafaba seeds) lie directly on the natural rock. The second, LR/ECh, construction phase comprises rubble masonry walls forming two rectangular rooms, fragmentarily preserved, presumably part of a private building complex. (ADelt 449-50) Stageira. Large sections were excavated in different areas of the anc. city, yielding the following results: EC fortification. Excavation of the S wall of Stageira (ca 350m) which protects the city from sea to sea was completed with the uncovering of the inner face of its S leg over a length of 80m W of the acropolis. The wall is preserved to h. 2.30m and it follows the 'Egyptianizing' construction style. Two more ascending staircases (I. 6.35 and 7.50m) and a rainwater collec- tion drain were also found. Finds include 19 lead almond- shaped sling bullets (many of which were inscribed), along with five bronze arrowheads. At the NW point of the N hill of the polis the outer face of the EC wall was revealed for 40m. The wall forms a curve along the cliff; it follows the polygonal con- struction style and it is preserved to h. 2m. 110. &amp; 111. Sane Kassandras, post-Byzantine shipwreck: cargo LC fortification. On the NW slopes of the same N Hill, con- tinuing excavation exposed a 30m long section of the LC forti- fication of the polis, 140m of which have now been revealed. The wall, going steeply uphill, is of irregular construction, except for some points, where an attempt at an isodomic ashlar construction may be traced. Walls are attached to it at right angles on the interior; these walls, combined with the levelling of the bedrock, create stepped terraces for habitation. At the highest section of the wall, attached to its inner side, many rec- tangular rooms were revealed, belonging to HL houses. Movable finds include an anc. lead tablet with a relief represen- tation of a griffin, a small terracotta house model with inscribed decoration, and fragments of two A vases, bearing inscriptions. A fortification. Locating the earliest fortification of the city was achieved in this year's excavation: the 2m wide A fortifica- tion served as the foundation of the Byz diateichisma on the N hill. This discovery reveals the size of the city for the period from its foundation through to the early 5th Ct BC, during which the population increase dictated its expansion to the adjacent S Hill and the construction of the EC fortification walls.</page><page sequence="78">78 - DAVID BLACKMAN ffi zP ,..w; : ............................... .-P. b. .. e , . - - ....... .; D!_ - - . i, wo,rot , f.i_. ,&gt; s , s4 - * 115. Stageira: Archaic temple 112. Stageira, fortifications: lintel careful observation and study of the movable finds convince the excavators that this building, even though it is built with good materials (coming from anc. public buildings), belongs to the EHL period. Its carefully constructed walls (w. 1.20 x h. 1 .80m) have been irregularly built with well-worked blocks of marble, limestone and poros. The function of the building remains problematic. A granite block in secondary use was found inside the building, with the A votive inscription: KAP[ANOL] I KAAOL I flY(30rEN[OYE] I ESOKE. Beneath it was inscribed a fishbone-shaped symbol (Fig. 113). A rectangular, now empty space (1.70 x 1.10m) lies at the centre of rectangular floor of marble tesserae. Its date is uncertain, yet, judging from mov- able finds and from the various walls around it, the excavators consider this floor to be one of the earliest elements of the area, presumably dating to the A period (Fig. 114). Movable f1nds include stamped tiles (some with the stamp BA = BOC61X1KO5), a bronze ring bearing a Nike and many bf, rf and bg sherds. The entire surface of the akropolis of Stageira, at the peak of the S hill, was revealed, including two more rectangular stone-built areas, probably sections of military installations; the most characteristic finds were the many (mostly inscribed) lead sling bullets and the 12 bronze or iron loom-weights. Excavations in two residential blocks on the flat E slope of the N Hill, on either side of a narrow anc. road, were continued. Two large, important sections of stone-built A and C houses, preserved up to ca 2.50m high, provide information about the town planning, domestic economy and society of Stageira. Finds include important samples of local, Cor and Attic pottery, fragments of terracotta figurines, stamped tiles and handles of plain amphoras and plain and bg lamps, loom-weights of all types, metal objects, a clay die, etc. Agora. A large section of a public building complex (30 x 1 Om) was unearthed in the area between the two city hills, N of and along a paved road found in the previous year. At the west- ernmost, highest level a three-room building with C shops, found in the previous year, was unearthed. The second largest, rectangular area of the complex lies at a much lower level. The large, oblong, deep constructions revealed in its W half pre- sumably belonged to a basement winepress. At a third, lower level lies a smaller, similar rectangular area; its rear wall, up to 2.50 high, is irregularly built with large stones. The wall of the facade is also relatively well preserved, and it was built with large squared blocks; it presumably functioned as a storage room, judging by the many pits, of various sizes, that were irregularly cut in the floor, as well as by the large number of pithoi and fragments of plain amphoras. This is presumed to be a public storage-area, in the basement of the building complex. On the peak of the N Hill, which is occupied by a fortified Byz castle, is a large (possibly hekatompedos) A temple, built 113. Stageira, apsidal building: inscription 1 14. Stageira: floor below apsidal building The A fortification was unearthed beneath the Byz fortifica- tion for a short section which revealed one of the main gates of A Stageira, with a marble lintel fallen in front. This lintel, h. 2.50m, I. 2.50m, bears a wild boar (left) confronting a lion (right) in high relief. This find is important not only because it depicts a boar, symbol of the polis of Stageira, but also because an A boustrophedon inscription is preserved. (Fig. 112) The following came to light in the same area: a large rec- tangular tower of the Byz walls. The tower has been built with well dressed stones of earlier buildings, combined with small stones and bonding mortar. A large public apsidal building (10 x 9m), surrounding the Byz tower, initially gives the impression of a tower-shaped construction of the A fortification.

Only one of its long walls has been unearthed (Fig. 115), for a length of over 30m and a height of ca 2,20m (6 courses). Many architectural elements of the temple have been recovered in fragmentary state. A section of the anc. cemetery was revealed in the area of the mod. harbour of Olympias, ca 300m i SW of the site. Seven inhumations in large plain amphoras, covered with slabs, but without grave goods, were unearthed. (ADelt 452-5) Nome of Pieria Dion. Sophia Kremmydi-Sisilianou presents her study of a pot hoard comprising 1,597 bronze R Imperial coins, which was found at the N side of the temple of Zeus, near the R theatre, in October 1999. The hoard was in one of the two rooms of a build- ing, where two smaller, contemporary hoards of bronze coins were found in the summer of 2000; apparently the three hoards should be treated as a 116. D single find. The mint of Dion produced 92% of the 1999 hoard; the large number of bronze coins of the time of Antoninus Pius (1,180 specimens) adds valuable information to our so far limited knowledge about the function of the mint dur- ing that period (34 coins known until 1999). The hoard also comprises 98 coins of a 'pseudoautonomous' issue of Dion, bearing a plough and the legend COL[ONIA] DIENSIS on the obverse and Artemis Baphyria on the reverse, with an accom- panying legend DIANA BAPHYRIA; 13 such coins are pre- sented in the author's monograph on the coinage of Dion. Only 4% of the total represents issues from beyond Dion. The hoard includes issues of other Macedonian cities: Amphipolis (Antoninus Pius), Edessa (Hadrian), Thessalonike (Vespasian to Antoninus Pius), Philippi, in smaller numbers; the Makedonian koinon is also represented by 39 coins; there are no issues of the adjacent Pella or of Kassandreia. 3% of the total comprises coins of the Thessalian Koinon (43 coins-Hadrian) and of Corinth (1-2 coins). The hoard also contains two bronze coins from Asia Minor mints: 1 of the Pamphylian Magydos, a small harbour near Attaleia, with a portrait of Antoninus Pius and with Athena Nikephoros; and 1 'pseudoautonomous' issue presumably either of Tralleis or of Caesarea, badly preserved, anepigraphic, bearing a Nike and an eagle. The mint of Rome is also represented by 15 specimens. The hoard is dated to ca 160 BC. (AEMTH 14, 367-376). D. Pandermalis reports on the grey marble slab (0.66 x 1.19m) found near the bronze hydraulis (water organ) of Dion; the slab had been initially used as a table, but it had been inscribed at a later stage. It carried an inscription referring to the construction and equipment of a 'praetorium cum tavemis duabus et apparatura', of which all the details are given. The author identifies the building mentioned in the inscription, i.e. the praetorium, with the so-called 'mansion of Dionysus', the most luxurious house excavated at Dion (Fig. 116). Excavation at the temple of Zeus, near the wall of the R the- atre, also yielded, among other finds, a pot hoard of bronze coins, predominantly of Dion, carrying the portrait of Antoninus Pius and a HL inscription with a catalogue of five female names, pre- dominantly Macedonian, under the title 'Xfipcat oX,ztm6;' (ICKiEXc x 'Etryovou, NuKapiGTrl 'AvAtucarpo), ZSax30rl Oe0ov- ou, MtIKucVX; dLo), Ei)(ppovi;). (AEMTH 14, 377-384) Kitros. Louloudia. Excavation at the new railway line focused on the section N of the ECh complex; EIA, A and C fills were traced, along with HL building remains. These were monu- mental constructions, the larger part of which continued into the ion: 'mansion of Dionysus' area of the ECh complex. It must have functioned as a public building, especially in the R period. (ADelt 455) Excavations continued in 1996 on the episcopal palace com- plex (see AR 2000-01, 93). Six building phases were encoun- tered W of the W enclosure: an early destruction phase charac- terized by the presence of Lakonian tiles; a second ECh phase (storage area and part of a street); a third phase, also ECh, char- acterized by repairs to subsidence damage; another ECh phase involving the walls parallel to the W wall of the enclosure; a modest and limited fifth phase of the 2nd half of the 6th Ct AD; and the final phase, with the area being converted into a ceme- tery (14 burials of most types). The SW comer of the site included a destruction level and R walls, and a lime pit. This appears to have been a workshop/commercial area. A glass fur- nace was encountered in the last phase associated with the palace. The NW sector included a linen factory of Justinianic date, underneath which large storage pithoi had been buried. Finally the NE tower of the E enclosure wall was investigated, together with an ECh cemetery with 16 cist tombs. (ADelt 508-10 &amp; Fig. 23) Korinos. G. Giannakis, P. Kalogeridis and M. Besios report on restoration and presentation work at the two burial mounds NW of Korinos on either side of the Athens-Thessalonike national highway. An attempt was made to protect and display the so- called Macedonian tomb of Pydna (A), which was excavated in 1861 and published by Heuzey in 1876. Concrete was used to construct and replace parts of the superstructure of the entrance. The ancient shelter was replaced by a similar metal structure, supported by five pairs of metal columns. Vertical metal Persian blinds, each slat Z-shaped in cross-section, served as lateral filling. Macedonian tomb B, which was found off-centre in relation to the top of the mound and excavated together with its dromos, had been plundered in antiquity. Some structural work helped restore the mound: one section (above ground) over the main chamber consists of transverse iron girders, which transfer the overlying load from the restored mound to a pair of tie-beams positioned in the appropriate place, at the right depth. An open- ing level with the facade of the tomb integrated in this under- ground structure helps to illuminate and ventilate the monu- ment. The section above ground consists of two parallel framed iron girders, almost hovering over the earthen sides of the dro- mos. The faces of this visible structure consist of light building</page><page sequence="80">80 DAVID BLACKMAN the earlier ditch are locally rich in ceramic and faunal debris, suggesting a midden. Inside the line of the wall, part of a pos- sible second enclosure wall has been exposed, while cobble spreads and larger rubble along the N edge of the trenches may have collapsed from domestic architecture just outside the exca- vated area. A Neolithic burial, comprising two contracted inhu- mations and a baby accompanied by beads, was also found inside the circuit wall although its stratigraphic relationship to these boundary features remains to be clarified. In the S of the mound, the MN circuit wall is less massive and less well pre- served than that in the SE. Inside this wall, and again of MN date, a smaller 'yard wall' (Fig. 118: S excavation area; view from NW of trenches 12 (left/foreground) and 4 (right/rear), showing collapsed MN house walls (left), the MN 'yard wall' running E-W (right) and behind this the clay revetment of the MN circuit wall) has been traced along only part of the length of the circuit wall and may have delimited a habitation area which has so far revealed remains of at least two buildings and associated facilities. A few metres to the west, the MN circuit wall is cut through, possibly by a stone-filled circuit ditch com- parable with that located in the SE of the site. While the lower parts at least of the Neolithic circuit walls consisted of a clay core faced with large stones, the lower cours- es of 'house' walls were made of large stones with a packing of small cobbles collected, presumably, from the streams running past the site. Burnt fragments of wall, storage bin and plastered surfaces, not in situ, reveal details of Neolithic architecture and indicate that the upper parts of domestic walls were of clay packed round a wooden frame, rather than of mud-brick. Spreads of cobbles, imported to the site by human agency, may represent both collapsed house walls and paved surfaces. These pose problems of both planning and interpretation, but planning has been eased by photogrammetry and interpretation aided by study of similar material in old houses in Kolindros. Cobbles from the streams were also experimentally heated and quenched to determine whether cracked cobbles in Neolithic levels might represent 'pot-boilers' from cooking (a possibility compatible with the extreme rarity of recognisable ceramic cooking vessels in MN levels). Paliambela continues rich in artefacts, this year including pots with human faces in relief (Fig. 119: 'face-pot' from trench 6) and a rare N gold 'ring idol'. A few vessels bear traces of repair or internal coating with a resinous substance, similar to that identified as birch tar at nearby Makrigialos. Engagement with the local community this year included experimental replication of ceramics, interviews with elderly residents concerning diet, land tenure and land use in the earli- er 20th Ct and a programme of educational visits by school par- ties of various ages.' Pydna. N Cemetery. During the third year of excavations in plot 480, the number of tombs excavated was raised to 1,118, dating between the LBA and 300-275 BC.

A second season of excavation, directed by Paul Halstead and Kostas Kotsakis, was undertaken by a team from the Universities of Sheffield, Thessalonike, Bradford, London, Valencia and Volos. They report: 'Principal goals were further investigation of features locat- ed in 2000: 'yard' deposits in the NW and architectural traces in the N of the mound; enclosure walls and ditches in the S and SE, originally detected by geophysical prospection. In the NW of the mound, excavation continued to explore early LN and MN deposits, although it is now clear that the stratigraphic sequence is complicated by some large pits of Neolithic date. In the trench to the N, more numerous and bet- ter preserved traces of 'domestic' architecture were exposed, of both LN and MN date and cut by recent pits which have pro- vided a valuable 'window' into the underlying deposits; several anthropomorphic figurines appear to have been incorporated within the Neolithic walls. In the SE, the circuit wall and intersecting ditch filled with stones, of late and early LN date respectively, have now been traced over ca 20m (Fig. 117: SE excavation area; view from N of trenches 9 (left), 8 and 5 (centre) and 7 (right), showing the late LN circuit wall (centre ground) and early LN stone-filled ditch (rear)).

EIA cist and pit tombs, and two chamber tombs, with a dromos leading to a round chamber, were dispersed in the area. Dense 5th-Ct BC burials were found in the E part of the plot, near the anc. coastal road, which led from Pydna to Methone. Tombs were mainly pit tombs with wooden sarcophagi, but a few cre- mations were found in shallow pits, along with child pot burials. Most tombs date to the 4th and early 3rd Cts BC, when the cemetery expanded to the W part of the plot towards the top of the hill, where a large burial tomb was found. Pit graves with a wooden cover predominate; tile-covered tombs, along with a few burials in shallow pits, have also been found. Finally, a cist tomb built of unbaked bricks with white plaster on the vertical sides of the chamber has yielded finds such as an iron sword, bronze and terracotta vases and a lead metal plate, found near the r. palm of the deceased. Two trenches traced this year were probably related to sieges of Pydna. (ADelt 455) M. Besios and S. Triantaphyllou publish the very important 4th-Ct BC mass grave, which was found in the N Cemetery of Pydna during rescue excavations. The stratigraphical evidence shows that the dead were buried in four different periods. The grave contained at least 120 burials, which had been carelessly thrown into a rectangular pit with a N-S orientation, without any mortuary rites. This disorderly manner of disposing the dead indicates that the burials were a hasty process. That all age groups and both sexes are represented here illustrates effective- ly a family-structured society. A notable case was an approxi- mately nine-month foetus, found in its mother's pelvis; so far, no traces of injuries have been noticed which could have been a cause of death. Apart from a small amount of pottery, the rela- tively few accompanying goods fall into two categories: objects related to the clothing of the dead and iron fetters of various types, which were worn by four people in total. Detailed study of the skeletal material is to take place. (AEMTH 14, 385 -94) Nome of Kilkis Europos. Excavation was continued at both the acropolis and the cemetery. A 24m-long wall traced during the previous year was investigated on the acropolis. Excavation was extended to the N; it may be assumed that this was an apsidal building; its W side was not traced. Of the three kilns found, one pear- shaped kiln (0.93 x 0.78m int. dimensions), containing two over-fired vases, was excavated. Apart from the kilns, a tile- covered tomb also indicates, by bronze coin finds and pottery, that this city quarter was destroyed and abandoned during the 6th Ct AD. Wall complexes were revealed in the remaining grid squares, containing storage pithoi and loom-weights. Five new tile-covered tombs were found in the cemetery excavation, along with remains of walls of a three-aisle basili- ca, almost next to the S section of the hero6n-martyrion, which had been excavated in 1991. Two chamber tombs with stairs were found W and E of the central nave respectively. The tombs were pillaged; both they and the basilica may be dated only through external morphological features. Similar monu- ments have been excavated around Diocletianoupolis (cf. ADelt 43, 195-206). Excavation work in the basilica will continue. Grave goods are similar to those of earlier excavation periods; most tombs contain no goods. (ADelt 457-9 and figs. 16-17) T. Savvopoulou, G. Giannakis and G. Niaouris report on the results of the project for the development of the cemetery of Europos, funded by the 2nd EU Support Framework and com- pleted in 2000. This is the only cemetery illustrating the social stratification and standard of living at a typical provincial town in the R period. The cemetery preserves above-ground struc- tures related to burial rites and practices. It comprised pit- graves, cist-graves and monumental barrel-vaulted tombs sur- rounded by stone walls. The project also involved the con- struction of walkways giving access to the monuments, protec- tive shelters and drainage shafts, and the planting of trees. (AEMTH 14,291-8) Palaio Gynaikokastro. Excavation was affected by bad weath- er and did not reach the natural soil. A pithos burial was found; the rest of the finds reproduce the cinerary vessel types and finds of earlier periods. (ADelt 459) Palatiano. Work continued in 1996 in the areas excavated since 1994 (houses III, IV, V and ancient road) to investigate the ear- lier phases of the site and was started in sectors VI and VII in order to link up the peribolos around the peak of the hill and the excavated sections of the polis on the E slope (Fig. 120). House III: excavation revealed more elements about the ear- liest occupation phases, about which there were clues from pre- vious seasons. The house lay S of the courtyard of hero6n I; it is separated from the latter by a corridor, 2.20m wide. It com- prises three rooms, two of which (A, F) lie along the E side of the house, whereas the third (B) occupies its W section. Only the E part of rooms A and F had been founded on earlier fills; their W part and room B had been founded upon rock. The walls of room A, along with the rest of the walls of the house, are of rubble masonry and clay mortar. At the SE comer of the room, an opening of 1.80m led to the road, whereas at the NE comer there was a shallow construction made of two small walls to surround an internal space 0.90 x 0.75m. In the W sec- tion of the room the rock was revealed, with two pits that had been dug into it. The E part of the room had construction phas- es dating between the 1st and the 3rd Cts AD. Pottery found in room F to the S is similar to that of room A. Some HL pottery was found, along with both hand-made and wheelmade IA pottery. Room B lies W of rooms A and F. A stone-paved area (3.50 x 3m) was presumably built on an earli- er stone pavement in the same area, which will be investigated during the next season. House IV has five rooms in a F formation. The foundations of the S section (rooms B, A, E) and of room r have been laid on the rock. At the E side of room B part of a hearth, surround- ed by vertical tiles, has been preserved (1 x 0.80m); it was made of clay slabs on a layer of small stones and tiles. A similar hearth (1.20 x 0.55m) was found at the NW corner of the adja- cent room A. Apparently room B was floored with stone slabs. HL (3rd-2nd Ct BC) and R (1st BC-3rd Ct AD) pottery were found in cleaning the room. Earlier phases of habitation of the area have been traced at three points of house IV: (a) at the SE corer of room E a wall also revealed in the SE section of the road belongs to an earlier phase in the area; (b) at the E section of room F a wall lying par- allel to the above-mentioned wall presumably belongs to the EHL period; (c) in the northernmost room of house IV, room A, the HL storage pits (and other finds) found indicate that room A was built on a HL pithos store. The road surrounds from S and E houses III, IV, hero6n I and peribolos II. Excavation started from the S section of the road (I. 12m, w. 1.60-3.40m) and was continued on its E section for 37m, as far as the corridor separating house III from the peribolos of hero6n I. The E section of the road is 1.75-3m wide; the width of its retaining wall ranges from 0.50 to 0.90m. Building remains of the earlier phases of habitation were revealed beneath the R level. The ground plan of the W section of house V was clarified during this year's excavation; the finds collected (pottery, small metal objects, several loom-weights and a few figurine frag- ments) date between the 1st Ct BC and the 3rd Ct AD. Three</page><page sequence="82">82 DAVID BLACKMAN 120. Palatiano: site main rooms lie along the W side of the house; they occupy 20 x 8.20m and they continue eastwards. The N section of the house surrounded an open area; access to house V from the N was achieved through an opening 1.50m wide. The E side had a pavement of clay slabs and with a built cistern (1.60 x 0.90, 3m deep) lined with waterproof mortar, and with a clay drainage pipe. Three stone bases were found on the W side of the pavement, presumably forming a narrow stoa. Four narrow niches, of uncertain function, were found along the W wall. Sectors VI and VII. Walls of buildings reveal the dense occupation of the area. N of peribolos II, a group of buildings was unearthed, of as yet uncertain function. Finds date to the 1st Ct BC-2nd Ct AD. Sector VII lay at the end of the test trench made by Ph. Petsas in 1966 (ADelt 22, 400-03), which revealed walls, along with R and HL finds. Petsas's test trench was broadened, revealing larger sections of the buildings. A building of five rooms and a N-S orientation was unearthed. The N room is 5.80 x 4.80m and its walls 0.50-0.60m wide; a cistern was found at its SW corer. S of this room a second large area (7.70 x 6.80m) is divided into four smaller rooms. A fragment of a clay basin was found in the SE room; the destruction level covering these areas has not been fully examined. Finds are dated to the 1st Ct BC-3rd Ct AD. A wall with a W-E orientation, 0.50-0.55m wide, belongs to the HL phase of occupation of the area. It crosses the two S rooms and continues to the W. Building walls from this period, with a NW-SE orientation, were traced to the N, S and E of the building; excavation will continue. (ADelt 459-65) Plagia. Partial pillaging and destruction of three chamber tombs was identified by the Kilkis-Plagia road, where sherds were scattered in situ. The tombs were built with schist slabs along the sides, had a paved floor and were also covered with schist slabs. Few bones and some grave goods in the tombs indicate a large IA-A cemetery. The cemetery presumably belongs to the settlement lying at Prophetes Elias, where LR rubble masonry walls have been traced. IA surface finds prove the existence of an earlier phase of the settlement. Finds have been transferred to the Kilkis Museum. (ADelt 456-7) WESTERN MACEDONIA A report by the 17th EPCA appeared in ADelt 513-49, but unfortunately our resum6 did not arrive by our deadline. EASTERN MACEDONIA Anc. Amphipolis. A rescue excavation was carried out during 1999-2000 in the E cemetery of anc. Amphipolis, before the widening of the Amphipolis-Mesolakkias road. An area of 170 x 80m was explored and around 660 graves were uncovered, bringing the total discovered in the C and HL cemetery to around 1400. Sector A contained 60 graves, mainly pit- and cist- graves from the HL and R periods. A section of a wall with an E-W orientation was found in the S, built with reused anc. building materials (poros stone, ashlar blocks, plinths, etc.). Clay pipes going in different directions and openings in the ground are associated with this wall, and it probably belonged to the Amphipolis aqueduct. A grave dating to the late 3rd -early 2nd Ct BC destroyed part of the clay pipes, indicating that the pipe predates the grave. Similar graves were found in sector G. In sectors B, D and E, the so-called C cemetery E of the existing road, most of the graves were pit graves covered with tiles. In all, 438 graves were found, randomly arranged and on many levels. A number of tomb stelae were also found, in secondary use. Horse burials were found in sector B, some of which were fully preserved. Around these burials were found pit and tile- covered graves, most of which were without any burial goods. Those with burial goods date to the later 4th -2nd Ct BC. The horse remains indicate that they were sacrificed in honour of the human dead. Another surprise was a Macedonian tomb with a dromos, antechamber and main chamber. It had been broken into and was partially destroyed. The fill in the dromos contained part of a tomb stele with the inscription API;TOKAHE AIFYITOZ. Many of the graves contained no burial offerings and many had been broken into. There were some burials, however, with 0 1 S"</page><page sequence="83">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 2001-2002 83 rich remains, particularly those of women and children. Many of the dead were found with a bronze or gold coin in their mouths. A large number of gold and silver rings with precious jewels and representations were also found, as well as other valuable jewellery, including gold wreaths. Among the most important, and earliest, finds were a group of late-5th -Ct white lekythoi with funerary representations. (AEMTH 14, 55-70) Rescue excavations were carried out at three sites near the village of Nea Kerdyllia, in anticipation of work on the Asprovalta-Strymon section of the Odos Egnatia. A HL ceme- tery was uncovered at Modi, 500m to the N of Nea Kerdyllia, spread out over a hill behind anc. Amphipolis. The excavation here lasted from October to December 2000, and in all 68 buri- als were uncovered. A layer containing only figurines, vases and six bronze coins was also found. In 1999 work on the road at the site of Kalamoude brought to light the remains of a cellar, and further investigations revealed the architectural remains of a building, most probably a farmhouse. Archaeological excavations in July-September 2000 uncovered the remains of four walls which defined one or perhaps two buildings. Fragments of pithoi were found in area A; 24 bronze coins, dating from the early 4th to the early 3rd Ct were also found. About 120m E of this area were found several large pithoi, some made of excellent-quality clay. It is thought that this area was used as a storage room for pithoi, whilst the building to the W indicates the multiple use of this complex, with the storage and trade of pithoi within a farming context. The destruction layer dates to the late 4th-early 3rd Ct BC. A R cemetery came to light at the site of Strobolos, on the S slopes of Mt Kerdyllios. In an area of 570m2, 55 graves were uncovered, the majority of which were shallow pit graves. There were very few burial goods, although a large number of bronze coins were found: 419 bronze coins and three silver coins came from 43 of the 55 graves. Only two complete vases were found, and two complete glass vessels, a bottle and a flask dating from the 3rd Ct AD. The cemetery appears to have been in use from the 1St to the 3rd Ct AD. (AEMTH 14, 71-85) Anc. Argilos. A discussion of recent work at this joint Greek- Canadian excavation can be found in AR 2000-01, 101. The 1996 campaign also further explored the sector of the port, near the Thessalonike-Kavala national highway. Only one sector, 4 x 4m, was opened, though it covered the whole of the archaeo- logical stratigraphy to a depth of 6.50m, im above sea level. In earlier seasons, sherds most probably dating to the late 7th Ct BC had been found. No architectural remains were located this season, as the time available was severely limited. The pottery found dates to the first years after the foundation of Argilos. Of especial interest was the local pottery, with relief decoration. (ADelt 567) Large-scale work was not carried out at the site during 1998 and 1999. Instead, the main focus of attention was to complete excavation of the three houses (A, B and E) partially uncovered in the N sector of the city and the further investigation of the port sector. House B was built at the E edge of sector B 1, which was fully uncovered, making dating possible. The first building phase dates to the late 6th -early 5th Ct BC, although not many finds dating to this period were made. A hearth/oven had been found during an earlier excavation season in sector B2, and this was now dated to the first building phase, remaining in use throughout the whole period of habitation. It was also ascer- tained that this hearth belonged to a complex of installations. A small, square basin (1 x lm) was found to the right of the hearth. A small buttress wall was located in front of the hearth and basin, supporting these two structures. A stone had been placed in front of the wall, functioning undoubtedly as a step. In the NW corer was a stone base upon which a pithos, fragments of which were found, once stood. The excavators believe that this complex did not serve just a domestic purpose, but provid- ed some service to the local community. A large three-part house (A) had been found opposite build- ing B early on in the excavations. A passageway remained to be explored, and this was completed in 1998. Excavation of the large building E, in the centre of the N sec- tor, continued. It appears that the last phase of use of this build- ing was in the 1st half of the 4th Ct. During this phase, only the E half of the building was inhabited. There were positive results from the port sector. A pebble floor with holes for wooden posts was found at a depth of 5m. Cycladic pottery from the 2nd half of the 7th Ct BC was found trodden into the floor. This level is clear evidence of the arrival of the Greeks in this area. (AEMTH 14, 109-115) Kalamitsa. (anc. Antisara). Rescue excavations were carried out on the Lagas plot adjacent to the wall of anc. Antisara, which was already partially visible. Four sections were exca- vated (I-IV), whilst the whole plot was mechanically excavat- ed and the section of the wall standing at the SE edge of the plot was cleaned. A section of what was most probably a buttress wall was located in section I, with a SE-NW orientation, built on the nat- ural rock. It was comprised of a row of five large stone blocks, the upper part of the three central blocks being visible from the surface. Pottery found around the wall gives it a C date. Section IV was directly adjacent to the anc. wall, and the width and height of the surviving section of the wall could be measured at this point (w. 2.10m, h. 1.85m). The wall was built with large and small cut blocks with an earth and rubble fill on natural rock, cut to take the wall. A section of another wall was found 3.30m from this outer wall. This wall was roughly con- structed, with a layer of earth between it and the natural rock. The pottery found in section IV dates these walls to the 5th Ct BC, although the outer wall is earlier. No architectural remains were found in sections II and III, although the pottery in these sectors dates also to the C period. (ADelt 550-551) Kokkinogeia. The apse of a Byz church was discovered in the region of the Maara cave. Tombs nearby, in association with surface pottery suggest a Byz settlement here, of unspecified date. (ADelt 582) Palaiochori-Branokastron. Excavations continued in the monastery complex of Agios Georgios, Branokastro (AR 2000-01, 103). The enclosure, refectory and other ancillary structures were investigated (Fig. 121). The enclosure walls lack towers, and the masonry is particularly poor, lessening the fortified aspect of the complex. The monastery gate complex stands out against the enclosure wall, and consists of two phas- es: a simple gate and, later on, a more complex structure built to include a diabatikon common in monastery gates of the later Byz period. A well was found that appears to have satisfied the monastery's needs, given that a cistern has not yet been located. The refectory has no openings for a door, and therefore it must have constituted the upper storey of a two-storey structure. The kitchen complex included a cook-house with a semi-circular oven, and a saucer-like structure for kneading bread. The monastery's arrangement is typical of a LByz monastic house, and the moveable finds suggest inhabitation from the 13th to 18th Cts AD. Most finds date from the later period. Pottery finds included ware with inscribed and painted decoration in brown-</page><page sequence="84">84 DAVID BLACKMAN 121. Branokastro: Agios Georgios monastery 123. Philippi, 'House of the Deer': room C3 green hues, identified with a Serres workshop. Pottery with green inscribed and painted decoration was also found, and is common in Samothrace, Thasos and Lemnos (15th Ct AD). Coin finds include Byz and Latin coins (13-14th Ct AD). The main phases of the monastery are identified as 11th Ct AD (founda- tion) up till the 14th, and the second from the 16th to the 17th. A hoard of 876 silver coins of Selim I (1512-20) was found. Initially an autonomous monastery, the institution became a metochion of the Eikosiphoinissa Pangaiou monastery, follow- ing financial difficulties faced during the 2nd half of the 14th Ct AD. (ADelt 583-5) Petropigi. The Norwegian Institute excavation of the Byz sta- tio/Ott caravansaray conducted its final study season at the Archaeological Museum of Kavala. The director, Prof. Siri Sande (University of Oslo) and two students catalogued, described, and photographed hitherto undocumented objects. Having studied the glazed fine wares (including 4th-3rd Ct BC drinking vessels) in 2001, efforts now turned to the coarse wares. A number of LC to EHL amphora types were identified, among them a handle with the stamped griffin ofAbdera. A base could be attributed to an amphora of a Mendian type.

Phillipi, 'House of the Deer': bath installation Thracian origin. Finds such as these may suggest that, in the 4th to 3rd Cts BC, Petropigi was a trading station, possibly with an anchorage. Further study of coarse ware handles and bases for the final publication may reveal a greater proportion of Gr material than previously thought. All human activity on the site ceases until LByz times (late 12th-13th Ct AD). Apart from pottery, these later finds are dom- inated by iron nails, uncovered in two concentrations, at the SE gateway and in the space between the two parts of the site. The nails are believed to be part of the woodwork of gates that grad- ually decayed upon abandonment. This would indicate that there existed an internal gate in addition to the external one on the SE. One horseshoe proved to be Med, the others of more recent date. The bronze Turkish coins proved too badly pre- served to provide indications of a date, but three silver coins suggest a date in the 15th and 16th Cts. Some lead, mainly raw material, and four pieces of bronze, one of which was identified as a chain link from a set of scales, complete the metal finds. An osteologist will study the bone material in 2002. Philippi. S. Provost and a team from the French School carried out an excavation in the 'House of the Deer', formerly called first the 'S bath' and then the 'building with bath', in order to clarify its identification. The building has a central peristyle court (B) and two wings (A and C). A row of rooms (D) to the S of the W wing is composed of bath ~'^ installations (Fig. 122). This season work concen- trated on the N and E sides of wing C. The walls of the E side of wing C are particularly well preserved (nearly 2m) and the stratigraphy is particularly sig- nificant as a result of the double slope affecting the site from N to S and from E to W. The E third of C3 and the lower part of the cis- tern to the W of it had not previously been excavat- ed. Here a door found in the NE comer (Fig. 123) confirmed the existence of a wall between this door and door C3-C4, thus confirming the existence of a room C10 to the N. Two floors of beaten earth were ,^^fe,, leme, found and one flagged floor. Floor 1, the latest, was .S^.J..Fey contemporary with the hydraulic reorganization (a conduit running from C4 towards the SE comer of .r...ta.^ ,r the cistern but not reaching it: Fig. 124: room C3 digas en"2001 from the N). Floor 2 was connected with a conduit : .."w... crossing the annexe of C3 and running towards the cistern where it must have divided. Subject to con- firmation from the numismatic material these two floors dated from the 4th and 5th Cts AD.</page><page sequence="85">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 2001-2002 85 124. Philippi, 'House of the Deer': bath structures Below floor 2 a levelling later covered a thick destruction level of the 4th Ct. Under this floor 3 was paved with terracotta tiles covered by pink mortar possibly supporting some structure linked to the C3-C 10 door. The floor corresponds to that of C6 and dates from the 3rd or 4th Ct AD. In the W two-thirds of C3 a floor of chalky slabs at a lower level than floor 3 was covered with ash dated to the 6th Ct AD. The E third, therefore, seems to have been ca 30cm higher than the W with a different paving, and a step at its SW edge. The floors of C5 and C6 were also raised, suggesting that the W side might have formed an uncovered 'atrium' while only the E side was roofed. This would explain the existence of a 6th-Ct house built using the cistern walls as a foundation. In C1 under a number of top layers of fill con- taining 4th to 6th-Ct material, a 4th-Ct floor was found at the level of door C -C3. A door was also found (not on the same alignment) in the N wall leading out onto a portico (?) B3 with a raised threshold. This may have been associated with the second occupation phase (4th-5th Ct) when the building may have been divided and separate access to wing C was required. S. Provost and M. Boyd carried out a further sea- son of geophysical prospection for the French School. After the particularly successful result achieved in 2000 in the area of the 'building with , bath' in the SW part of the city (AR 2000-01, 103-4), the aim in 2001 was to cover the rest of the urban area S of the Via Egnatia with resistivity sur- vey, and test magnetometer survey in certain small- er areas. Time did not permit complete achievement of this aim; nevertheless the surveyed area was extended from 5.5ha (2000) to 14.5ha, making this the largest geophysical survey so far carried out in Greece (Fig. 125). Detailed interpretation of the results is at an early stage, so the following conclusions are provisional. In the NW sector (zone 6) at least two cardines minores of the N grid have been identified and a large rectangular building with two apses on its SW side. The R grid is masked by overlying MByz and LByz structures. In zone 7, the long strip S of the Kavala-Drama road between the Krenides gate and the W end of the forum, the R street grid was found to be similar to that defined in 2000 at the gymnasi- oo um baths: three insulae visible near the Krenides gate correspond to the normal module. Further E a large 125. Phil rectangular building covering at least two insulae seems to be an ECh basilica. In the S part of the unit (zone 8), between the excavated areas and the rampart, the survey revealed the whole first row of insulae S of the Diagonal Road and the road course itself. The basic module remains ca 31 x 80m, but there are more vari- ations that expected: two insulae occupied a double area proba- bly corresponding to major public buildings. One such building was defined by the survey, where air photographs had already given an indication. The survey also defined a second main road parallel to the Diagonal Road, and a second row of insulae between it and the S rampart. The topographic plan of the city was supplemented, particu- larly by a detailed survey of a triangular fortification of MByz- LByz date within the earlier fortification walls (Fig. 126); the dating based on style was confirmed by the pottery. Work on the anc. theatre of Philippi, with the purpose of clarifying the various construction phases, took place between 1994-1999. The retaining walls, cavea and parodoi, and part of the retaining walls and ramp of the E parodos survive from the LC-HL periods. A large stage building was constructed in the 2nd Ct AD, and in the 3rd Ct AD the theatre was converted into an arena. Restoration work also continued on the theatre (see AR 2000-01, 104).

Investigation of phase I, which corre- sponds to phase III at Sitagroi, was completed in sectors I, IA and IB. The inability to locate a clear level of this phase in sec- tor I, where there was a large pile of stones with a W boundary marked by upright stones, was considered significant. This indi- cates that the settlement was possibly abandoned before the development of phase I, during which building remains from the earlier phase were modified and reused; hence the piles of stones that had been found during previous excavation seasons. An interesting feature of phase II was the floor of a house with a hearth that was located in sector I, with a clay structure that had either fallen or been moved and was found beneath the pile of stones. To this same phase belong sections of floors with broken vases in sectors IA and IB. The boundaries of the build- ings were determined by the excavators according to the layout of the hearths. The walls of the houses were built with clay and reeds, often reinforced at the base with large unworked stones. Only a few fragmentary walls survive. The exception was the wall of the pile dwelling in sector B that was located during an earlier excavation season. A total of five hearths/ovens had been found up until this date. The buildings with the subterranean areas belong to the ear- liest phase so far identified, phase III, and the relationship of the pile dwellings with the subterranean areas was not ascertained. It appeared that there was continuous habitation from phase II to phase III, which are contemporary with phase II at Sitagroi. (ADelt 563-5) A discussion of developments at this site during 1997-1998 can be found in AR 2000-01, 104. Work continued in 1999 at the foot of Mt Kerkine (Beles), with the aim of completing the investigation in grid squares B, I, IA, IB of the cen- tral excavation sector and in square IE in the S sec- tor of the E terrace. The earliest habitation layer of each section was excavated; they were crossed by shallow or deep trenches. The layout of the houses in this level (III) is known from the Bulgarian side of the excavation, and so work focused on the earth fills. The surface of the natural earth outside of the trenches was covered by a thin layer of hard clay and gravel. There followed relatively thin layers pro- duced by domestic activities, covered by a layer of ash, signifying the end of this occupation level. The natural earth within the trenches was also covered by a layer of hard clay and gravel, yet the thicker layers which followed signified a longer period of habita- tion. There are at least two large trenches in square IA, which were used as living and/or work areas. A section of a trench was uncovered in square I and the NW part of square IA, the shape of which is perhaps circular with sloping side walls. They were covered with a thin layer of green-yellow clay and gravel, followed by successive layers of yellowish clay and white ash. There then followed a sandy earth fill which lacked clear traces of habitation, and then a layer of waste material. Finds from this trench included much pottery of already-known types, small axes, bone tools, fragments of a marble phiale, iatln and clay female figurines, as well as the marble head of an figurine. (AEMTH 13, 1999, 111-16) 2001 Investigation of the circular subterranean struc- ture continued in 2000, and two new squares (IZT uebyzantine and IZ) were opened up to the W. Even so, it was found that these two new squares did not cover the whole of this large circular structure either, the diameter of which appears to be about 15m. Remains of buildings were found that had been built on top of the earth fill which covered the circular structure. IZ contained a hearth and successive habitation levels overlay a pile building in IET. (AEMTH 14, 87-98) Serres. Excavations on the Ath. Vlachatse site uncovered part of the Byz city walls, with a section of a LByz outer wall built to defend a ruined part of the earlier wall. (ADelt 583) Thasos. Limenas. Plans to prepare the site of the anc. sanctu- ary of Poseidon for public visits had to be modified when the remains of various buildings were found to the NW. A LR struc- ture, which underwent several renovations until ECh times, was explored. Sections of three rooms were uncovered, in the cen- tral one of which was preserved the base of a large clay pithos. A narrow road with repeated floors of sand, gravel and sherds and an E orientation appears, in the final phase at least, to have led to the sanctuary. Its walls were thick, with earth used as fill- ing material and often built reusing old marble architectural members. A typical piece was the broken marble relief of a woman, which has been identified as the upper part of the relief of a woman riding a dolphin already housed in the Thasos museum. (ADelt 551-2) Anc. cemetery. Excavation of a group of 54 graves in the plot of D. Soultos, begun in the 1970s, was completed. Seven simple cist-graves on the SE side, one cist-grave with built side walls on the S side, and one cremation in an orthogonal clay- lined pit were uncovered. A Thasian coin dating to the 4th Ct was found in grave LII. More burials belonging to the cemetery were found in the nearby plot of G. and M. Doubletis, includ- ing one cist-grave which contained two burials. (ADelt 552-3) &amp;0 a 0 0</page><page sequence="87">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 2001-2002 87 Molos. In 1996, architectural remains and a pot- tery dump were uncovered in the SW comer of the expropriated former Pavlides plot during work on the Limenas-Prinos road. The pottery workshop has been known since the inter-war period, although there was little secure information about it and it was wrongly given an HL date. A large proportion of the stamps now found date it to at least the 4th Ct 41.4 BC. Excavations in 1933 had identified two walls to the S of the then Limenas-Prinos road (which does 42 not follow the same path as today's road). The pot- tery workshop was located to the E of these walls. Work in 1996 was limited to a strip of terrace no wider than 4m. A stairway with five steps and an SONDAGE- E-W orientation was found in sector I, on the SW comer of the expropriated plot. Its most northerly point is in contact with the pottery dump. It was cleaned to a length of 3.20m (W-E), with a maxi- mum height of 1.50m and a width of 1.40m (N-S). The stairway was built of unworked stones bonded with clay directly onto the natural rock. The purpose of the stairway has not been identified. It terminates in a landing to the E, with a length of 3.15m and width not determinable. A wall with 5-6 courses and a W-E orientation was found 1.75m N of the landing. The pottery dump covers the whole of sector I, covering both the stairway and the wall. Its stratigraphy was investi- gated over a sector 2m (W-E) x 0.50m (N-S). Sector II (ca 10 x 2.50m) is to the E of sector I. Beneath the earth fill used for the construction of the road was found a dark grey layer with strong traces of charring. Immediately beneath was the brown-red pottery-dump level. At no point was the black earth that Haspels noted below the dump in 1933 to be o 5 found. (ADelt 553-5) THl,- EMI THASO- REMI Y. Grandjean and Fr. Salviat (French School) con- SodagsI,M tinued their study of the Thasos rampart, digging two test trenches where two large blocks of masonry jut out on the inner side of the city wall between the 127. Tha; theatre and Evraiocastro (Fig. 127: location of the trenches). The first, 20m long immediately S of the tower just below the theatre, proved to be the base of a curtain wall stair- way running up from the S, supported by an escarpment of gneiss now partly destroyed by the collapse of the rock. To the N of this, behind the tower, was an altar in antis constructed in the inner wall face and contemporary with it (Fig. 128). There are comparable altars in Thasos, particularly that in the passage of the Theoroi. The second block of masonry, about OOm N of the first and 13.65m long, also supported a stairway, running N-S, seven steps of which are still in place (Fig. 129). In view of the architectural and stratigraphic data all these features seem to date to the first phase of construction ca 500BC. Thasos island. A large (2.10m x 0.90m) family grave was uncovered at the coastal site of Koinyra, containing the skele- tal remains of a large number of people. Three of the adult buri- als were in their original positions, whilst the remainder had been moved around. The grave has a general W-E orientation, and the skulls are located in the W. The grave is stone-lined with thick plaster layers on all sides. It was covered with three large limestone slabs. There were no finds, and it has been dated on the basis of the plaster and the burial style to the LR-ECh peri- od. (ADelt 556) An anc. installation with an enclosure was found at the site known as Trapezia in the vicinity of Prinos, at a height of 800m sos: rampart 128. Thasos: altar on the SE side of Mt Toumbas. The enclosed area (di. ca 25m) is believed to have been used for animal husbandry. A grave was excavated in the NW of the installation (internal dimensions 1.90-2 x 0.55m). It was built of large unworked blocks, which only in the NW section were replaced by a single slab. The grave was found opened and with no grave goods. (ADelt 562)</page><page sequence="88">88 DAVID BLACKMAN 129. Thasos: stairway A rescue excavation on the M. Hadjiyiannis plot at Skala Sotiros, 3m from the sea, brought to light a rubble masonry wall. There was a small opening (h. 0.60m, w. 0.40m) with a large limestone slab used as a lintel, over which there must have been a second opening. The function of this wall was not clari- fied. From the pottery remains, the wall has been dated to the 2nd half of the 4th Ct BC. Many Laconian-style roof-tiles were found, as well as a clay slab (0.20 x 0.20 x th. 0.05m), probably from a pier supporting a hearth. (ADelt 563) Excavations continued at the PR settlement at Limenaria in 1995 and 1996 (see AR 2000-01, 106-7). Further details from the excavations on the P. Markoulis plot are to be found in ADelt 556-560 &amp; plates 161-2. Architectural remains belonging to a HL farm were uncov- ered on the Taschonidou plot, a little to the W of the junior high school of Limenaria. These included 5m of a wall with a W-E orientation and a semi-circular structure, with larger stones positioned upright around it. Smaller stones and pebbles consti- tuted the 'floor.' It is not known if this was part of a fully cir- cular structure, such as a threshing floor. (ADelt 560) Three LByz graves were uncovered between Limenaria and Kalybia during construction of a local road. They may have been part of the cemetery of the Byz settlement of the Maria valley, although this is somewhat distant. (ADelt 560-1) Work also continued at the MN settlement of Limenaria in 2000, with 150m2 being excavated. This provided the opportu- nity for investigation of the interior of the settlement and its lay- out. Sections of at least two successive pile-dwellings on the same spot were uncovered. There is a covered rectangular extension on the exterior of the E side of the earlier building, possibly divided into three sections. A narrow building, ca 15m long and with the same orientation, was later built on the same spot. Inside it was a clay orthogonal structure, most probably used for domestic or food preparation activities. To the W of this building, perhaps in front of its entrance, was a rectangular clay bench defined by a row of stones. After the destruction of this later building, the N section was taken over by two open-air structures: a hearth and a cylindrical pit, the bottom and sides of which bore traces of burning. An earlier occupation level was ascertained in the strata immediately above the natural earth, during which the whole of the excavated area was open-air, with storage pits, hearths and stone benches. The most interesting of this year's finds came from this zone: a well (di. 2.50m) hewn out of the bedrock with a circular parapet, today surviving to 30cm. Excavation of its interior has so far reached a depth of 5m. Such wells are very rare in Greece in the PR era. The density of structures in this earlier level suggest that this zone may have had a public use, connected with the well. Information about the EN layers of the settlement was also provided this year by the geoarchaeological study. This showed that the N community settled at the SW end of a Middle or Upper Pleistocene terrace, which was 2-3m lower than at pres- ent. The site was chosen because it bordered on to various types of terrain and its soil was easy to cultivate. (AEMTH 14, 25-32) THRACE In 1998 the Institute for Cultural and Educational Technology (ICET) was established in Xanthi with the support of the General Secretariat of Research and Technology of the Greek Ministry for Development. The Institute aims to reinforce research- and technology-related activities and to promote the use of new technologies in the humanities, in culture and in education. In 1999 the ICET established an Archaeometry lab- oratory, the second in Greece. The laboratory aims to function as a centre for the promotion of scientific research in Archaeometry, supplementing archaeological investigations and meeting both public and private enquiries, relying on its specialized equipment and trained personnel. The laboratory can also work closely with the Analytical Chemistry Laboratory of the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki (AUT) and the related laboratories of the Demokritos University of Thrace (DUT), thus extending its potential. Its equipment includes: a thermoluminescence labo- ratory (TL), an optically stimulated luminescence laboratory (OSL), a stereoscope with a system for studying and analysing surfaces, equipment for producing and preparing samples, with modem ovens, and microwave digestion appliances. These will soon be supplemented with an autonomous closed system of radiographic x-ray imaging and a portable x-ray fluorescence system (XRF). At this initial stage the Laboratory has focused on the study of ceramics and glass. Among the first activities of the Archaeometry Laboratory was its cooperation with the 19th EPCA and the Analytical Chemistry Laboratory of the AUT on investigations at Abdera. These started with clay analyses, to study the Abdera pottery from the 7th Ct BC to the HL and even R Imperial times. The aims are to investigate the provenance of, and identify the workshops manufacturing the imported vases of the 7th /early 6th Ct BC found in the cemeteries; to determine the provenance of a group of vases including banded drinking cups and oinochoai, of the 6th-3rd Cts BC; also of a great many bg vases of the 5th and 4th Cts which have apparently not been manufac- tured in Attic workshops; and to determine the provenance of other clay objects such as roof-tiles, loom-weights, cists, sar- cophagi, cooking pots and trade amphoras.

Exhibits span the period from the 7th Ct BC down to the 13th Ct AD, most finds coming from the cemeteries of the city. They have been arranged in three thematic groups: public life, private life and burial customs, avoiding traditional chronological clas- sification and aiming instead to show how the life of the Abderites changed in time, and to highlight the role played by the city not only in Thrace but also in the whole of the Greek world. Ladi, near Didymoteichon. In 1999 the excavation of a nearly levelled tumulus near Ladi, which had started in 1998, was completed. The tumulus (di. ca 50m, h. 1.75-2.00m) was raised over a Neolithic site, causing it to be extensively destroyed. In the NE part of the tumulus (tumulus A) scattered traces of pyre deposits were uncovered, containing pottery offerings dat- ing to the 1 st Ct AD. However, no cremation or other sort of bur- ial dating to this period could be traced. Some pit burials with- out any grave goods found in the E and S side of the tumulus were probably of Byz or later date. Of the N site only deposits and pits dug in the ground could be detected. These contained vases, animal bones, stone and bone tools, parts of clay walls and floors. At the end of the excavation period a magnetometer survey was carried out by the Institute of Mediterranean Studies of Crete. The survey aimed to detect the cremations, which had not been detected in the excavation, and to trace pits or other struc- tures associated with the N site. It produced very useful results for the excavation which recommenced and was completed in 2000. The magnetic anomalies made it possible to detect and investigate deposits, trenches and pits of the N period. No house plans, floors, post-holes, or structures were discovered. The pits (d. 0.30-1.43m, di. 0.80-1.50m) were dug directly into the ground and were meant for refuse, although some may have originally been used for storage. The total area of the site has been estimated at 2,500m2. The pottery of the N site mainly consists of monochrome vases, in reddish, brown or black colours, undecorated or with incised patterns. Some sherds belong to human-shaped vases. The N pottery of Ladi seems to be quite different from pottery known from other N settlements in Thrace, which belong to the so-called Paradimi culture. Other finds include stone or bone tools and fragments of figurines. The site is provisionally dated, on the evidence of the ceramic and other finds, to the LN peri- od (5,300-4,600 B.C.). Among the N pits and on the same level were discovered two pit burials of the R period. One belonged to a child, the other to a horse. The rock-cut shaft of the child burial (1. 1.60m, w. 0.59m, d. 0.25m) contained a skeleton 0.82 m long and the nails of its wooden coffin. It has been dated, on the basis of the grave goods, to the 1St Ct AD. The horse burial dates probably from the same period. The pit (I. 1.37m, w. 0.55m, d. 0.19-0.25m) was too small for the horse, which had to be con- tracted to fit. The iron reins, a bronze stirrup, nails and links from the bridle and various ornaments were also discovered. Most of the tumuli in the area have produced cremations or inhumations of adults. This is the first time that a tumulus cov- ered a sole child burial along with offering pyres. The child must have been the offspring of a well-off family, buried with his little horse. (AEMTH 14, 1-7) Messembria Zone. The EMA searched the seabed, where the only remains found were ashlar blocks fallen from the city walls, where the land site suffers severe erosion. (ADelt 735) Paliohora near Maroneia. A chapel built on the E end of the N aisle of an ECh basilica was investigated (see AR 2000-01, 110). Along with the chapel at Synaxis nearby, the masonry of the chapel constitutes one of the very few known instances of cloisonne masonry in Thrace. The chapel has a synthronon complete with bishop's throne and built benches surround the nave walls. An interesting piece of R spolia has an inscription by a freed slave honouring his dead master: AIAIOX EAIIIA- HOOPOY AHIEAEYOEPOX / TON KYPION AYTO KPATEPON KATEXKEY / [AXEN-----------------------]. Another curious LR funerary inscription was found reused in a 12th-Ct AD tomb: the deceased forbids his tomb to be used by any person outside his family, and sets monetary fines for such defilement. The site was used as a cemetery in later centuries; the final destruction layer (13th Ct) was uncovered undisturbed. Coin finds include: a trachy of Theodore Komnenodoukas (1224-30), five small Latin imitations of type A, a faithful Bulgarian imitation of type C, twofolleis of Constantine VII (d. 959), afollis of Nikephoros II Phokas (d. 969), a tetarteron ofAlexios I (d. 1118) and a tra- chy of John III Vatatzes (d. 1254). (ADelt 588-90) In 1999 excavation continued of the ECh basilica and of the MByz buildings that occupied the area after its destruction. Excavation was completed in the narthex and the W end of the aisles of the basilica and in the narthex of the MByz Church. The narthex was turned into a cemetery during the DA. In 1996 and 1999, 36 graves were excavated, built at various lev- els into the destruction deposit of the basilica and under the mosaic floor. The mosaic of the narthex was thus almost com- pletely ruined except for two small parts preserved in its NW comer. The wall dividing the narthex from the naos is also gone. The graves, many of children, were built with materials plun- dered from the basilica or other earlier buildings. Two MByz residential areas occupied the N and S parts of the narthex, while the middle part was not built over (leaving the better part of the graves from the DA cemetery preserved) because it func- tioned as an open space between the buildings or because the street of the settlement passed through it. The picture of the S and N aisles of the basilica was less bewildering, since here parts of the mosaic floors were pre- served. The mosaics, of high artistic quality and originality, are stylistically related to mosaics from N Africa and the E Mediterranean. In the central aisle four inscriptions, visible as one entered the naos from the narthex, commemorated the donors of the mosaics. In the N aisle all traces of the mosaic floor are gone, along with any evidence from the ECh basilica or the DA cemetery, since here a large and deep deposit was built up in the MByz period. Its excavation has not yet been completed but it has produced pottery covering all known MByz ceramic types. The narthex floor of the little MByz church was destroyed by numerous burials dating probably to the 12th Ct AD, and suc- ceeding those of the DA. Built into the walls of one of the small buildings S of the MByz church was found a small marble base with an inscription to Hadrian (AD 127). (AEMTH 13, 15-28) Pherres. Triphyllones site. The excavation of the LByz ceme- tery was completed in 1996; 75 cist graves and 20 pit graves were uncovered. Child burials were few (17), unusual for the period; there was also limited evidence for re-burial or double burials. Cooking vessels were found with some of the burials, as were fragments of 13th-Ct AD glazed cups. Metal and glass objects were also found, but in very small quantity. One inter- esting find consisted of a large iron spike (0.29m) in grave T.32, which was accompanied by many rusted small iron plaques scattered around the body and head of the deceased. Some local ritual must be reflected here. (ADelt 590-2)</page><page sequence="90">90 DAVID BLACKMAN Samothrace. Sanctuary of the Great Gods. The 1996 season (ADelt 578) was covered in AR 1996-97, 91.

Progress was made in transferring coins to the storage case provided by the Ephoreia. Pottery and glass on exhibition, which had been restored with obsolete techniques, was disassembled and restored according to present standards. Architectural restorations whose appear- ance had deteriorated were repainted. Metal objects in the museum and in storage were surveyed, those requiring treat- ment were treated, and all were protected.' NORTHEAST AEGEAN ISLANDS Chios Town. In odos Dionysiou during the cutting of trial trenches a rectangular built altar was uncovered (1.02 x 1.01 x 0.65m). The fill surrounding the altar consisted of burnt bones and ash. Continual building activity has apparently destroyed the poor- quality building remains likely to have existed on the site. The fill contained a figurine fragment, a lens-shaped loom-weight, lamp fragments and a krater sherd. (ADelt 593) In Livadia District, Odos Letsainas, in the course of trial trenching before the laying of foundations, a section of the HL and R necropolis was uncovered, as well as building remains of the 4th or 3rd Ct BC A total of 20 burials were investigated: 12 tile-roofed graves; 4 cist graves; 2 inhumations in stone urns, a simple grave and a grave containing cremated remains. The tile-roofed graves, which are in relatively good condition, are between 1.25m and 2.10m in length. The cist graves are built of local 'Thymiana' stone and are placed on ground level. The maximum dimen- sions are 2.07m x 0.70m and two have the cover slabs intact. In two tile-roofed graves the feet of the deceased were nailed to the poros stone with iron nails. Twelve nails were found in grave VIII and 31 in grave XIII. Cist grave III was founded on a stone with the inscription: OPOI / HPAK/AEQ / TOY. All graves contained offerings which included hydriskai, scent bottles, small cups, a kantharoid cup, a rg amphoriskos with pseudo-handles, bronze coins (placed in the mouths of the deceased) and a small oinochoe. A gold olive wreath with gild- ed clay olives was found in grave XX. In the E section of the plot two parallel N-S walls were uncovered, built of unworked and semi-worked stones, without binding material (max. 1: 12.40m and 8.40m; w. 0.63m). The pottery found in the fill is early 4th Ct BC. W of the walls and S of grave XX the foundation course of a monumental building was uncovered (2.34m x 0.70m). (ADelt 593-4) In Odos Skaramanga (P. Pangalou plot) during foundation work for house construction anc. building remains were record- ed. The rescue excavation which followed brought to light a stone-built drainage system. The drains measure 9.30 x 1.04m, 9.40 x 1.04m and 6 x 0.50m and are oriented E-W: the earliest and latest are dated to the A and R periods, respectively. In the S section of the site a wall oriented E-W was uncov- ered (max. l: 13.50m, max. w. 0.70m), which marks the bound- ary of a road, S of which are four rooms with traces of stone- paved floors. The largest room is 3.20 x 2m and the smallest 1.60 x 1.58m. The partition walls are of unworked stones; the earliest is dated to the A period (max. l: 1.30m, max. w. 0.50m). At the northern boundary of the plot a rectangular room (room B: 4.20m x 0.68m) with successive floors dated from the A to the LC periods was uncovered. W of room B an apothetes was found containing mostly domestic pottery. Noteworthy is the abundance and variety of the pottery found in the fill under- neath the floors. The continuous use of the space along with its frequent destructions are indicated by the stone piles covering the drains, the road paving, the walls, the successive floors and the occu- pation levels dated from the A to the LR periods. (ADelt 594) Emporio. Landscaping and cleaning work was carried out in 1996 on the sanctuary of Athena. Kato Phana. Mrs Aglaia Archontidou-Argyri (20th EPCA) and Dr Lesley Beaumont (BSA/University of Sydney) report on the 2001 fieldwork season at ancient Phanai: 'Excavation focused on the SW quadrant of the sanctuary of Apollo Phanaios, continuing work of 1999 and 2000. Trenches III and VI produced further sections of the monumental peribo- los wall systems of the sanctuary: an early A phase constructed from closely packed, medium-sized, semi-worked limestone blocks, and a late A phase erected from large limestone ashlars. Within the sacred space of the sanctuary itself excavation concentrated on trenches II, V and VII. In trench V, located S of the narthex of the ECh basilica, a complex of walls, partial- ly revealed in 2000 and now further excavated, proved to belong to a large LR/EByz structure, constructed of stone rub- ble bound together by mortar and incorporating spolia from the Apollo sanctuary. Walls of similar construction and alignment excavated in trench II to the SW, and possibly others now emerging in trench VII to the NE, may belong to the same struc- ture, though further work is needed to clarify this matter. The extremely close proximity of these remains to the basilica rais- es interesting questions concerning the identity and function of the building. Finds here included much clay tile, coarse- and fine-ware ceramics, many fragments of glass vessels, a silver pendant in the form of a cross, two bronze coins, a pierced clay weight, and lead and iron fragments. Lying directly below the R levels excavated in trench V, fur- ther A strata came to light. In the NE quadrant of the trench these included votive material of 6th- and 7th-Ct date lying above a stone scatter which has yet to be removed: finds here comprised coarse- and fine-ware ceramics, several bronze arrowheads, a fragmentary bronze belt buckle, a bronze fibula, a bronze ring, and animal bone burnt at very high temperatures, presumably in sacrificial ritual. Two unexpected LH IIIB-C ter- racotta animal figurines (bulls?) were also found here among the A material. In the SW quadrant of the trench an eight- stepped stone staircase came to light: measuring about lm wide, the stairs are fashioned out of rough but flat limestone slabs (Fig. 130: limestone staircase from W). Preliminary study of deposits found both behind and overlying the staircase suggest construction during the 7th Ct BC. Finds here comprised both coarse and fine ceramic wares; several bronze items: two fibu- lae, a decorated pin, two fragmentary plaques, two flat spirals, a coil, several arrowheads; an iron knife or dagger blade, and large quantities of burnt bone. Though the nature of the stair- case is as yet uncertain, it may perhaps have formed a part of an</page><page sequence="91">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 2001-2002 91 early entrance to the sanctuary, since walls apparently built in terrace fashion from irregular limestone blocks appear to extend from the staircase to the NW and SE. This may then represent a sanctuary construction phase pre-dating the monumental A peribolos wall systems uncovered in trenches III and VI, which were probably constructed to define a subsequently expanded sacred space. To the N of the staircase, in the NW quadrant of trench V, was excavated what appears to be an anc. sanctuary dump deposited during the A period, and consisting of field stones, burnt bone, decorated ceramics, three bronze arrowheads, a bronze fibula, worked bone, a fragmentary iron axe head, and a third LH IIIB bull figurine. In cleaning behind the very small section so far revealed of the wall extending on the NW side of the staircase, an LH II-III sword pommel in white marble was recovered, together with a few sherds of LH III decorated pot- tery. These imported Myc artefacts are of a character quite dis- tinct from the locally made BA ceramics found during our pre- vious field survey seasons lying atop a PR settlement site NE of the cult centre, and raise questions concerning the early use of the Apollo Phanaios sanctuary site and the survival of the Myc material and its treatment or use by worshippers of the A peri- od. (To these Myc finds from Kato Phana can be added a fur- ther krater rim and a second marble sword/dagger pommel from the earlier excavations at the site by K. Kourouniotis and W. Lamb: S. Hood, Prehistoric Emporio and Agio Gala I, BSA Supplementary Volume 15 [1981], 6.) Viki, church of Agioi Apostoloi. During the illegal cutting of a road leading to the church a large section of the foundations of a monumental building, earlier recorded as a temple by Hunt 130. Chios, Kato Phana: staircase (BSA 40-41, 29-52), was destroyed. The rescue excavation that followed brought to light the architectural remains of a large building which was founded on a levelled area on the peak of the Agioi Apostoloi hill. W of the site and 16.35m away from the NW comer of the church, wall 1 was uncovered, oriented NE-SW and built of large ashlar blocks. The two foundation courses are intact (max. 1: 10.04m, max. w. 0.90m). Wall 3 (max. 1. 9.80m and max. w. 1.40m) was found 9.30m from the NW comer of the church and survives in two courses, built in the emplekton technique. N of the wall a stone-built grave (4) was uncovered (1.90m x 0.45m) which uses wall 3 for its S side. Grave goods included two bronze earrings. In the course of cleaning work on the plateau (15.50m from the NW comer of the church) a section of wall 2 was uncovered, built of irregular blocks (NE-SW orientation, max. 1: 5.30m, max. w. 0.50m). The fill of the wall, which was disturbed by bulldozer, contained unpainted domestic pottery and a large number of bg HL vessels. On the W slope of the hill a group of four graves of different type was found: a sarcophagus; two stone-built cist graves; and a simple grave. (ADelt 594-5) Lemnos Hephaisteia, necropolis. The investigation which began in 1995 following illegal excavation at the isolated site of Bounda, was continued. A total of 28 graves which were exposed by heavy rainfall during the winter months, were investigated in the Ran District (8 looted LC graves); at the country chapel of Panaghia (6 looted HL graves) and on the dirt road between the archaeological site and the Christodoulou enclosure (15 unloot- ed HL-C graves). Almost all the graves were oriented E-W with a slight incli- nation towards the N. The graves are built cist graves of unworked stones. Other burials included monolithic sarcophagi and one tile-roofed grave. The unlooted graves contained a leaf-shaped iron spearhead, a bronze needle, a hemispherical bronze knob, an iron strigil, bronze links, mirrors, earrings, nails, bg and unpainted scent bottles, domestic pottery vessels, rg and bg cups, a pot with traces of burnt remains, a lamp, a bg askos, a gold danake, gilt clay and bronze button-shaped jewellery. (ADelt 603) Baths. In 1996 the conservation of the HL baths was carried out by G. Messineo (Italian School). The site had been excavat- ed in 1926 by Laurenzi and in 1995 when a second room was uncovered. Two shelters were built: one above the water cis- terns of these baths and the other above the 'tower' in the wall which was excavated by Adriani in 1930 and was uncovered in 1995. (ADelt 606) Work at Hephaisteia was restarted in 2001 by the Italian School under the direction of E. Greco, who reports: 'Work concentrated on areas excavated by the School in the past: in particular the HL baths (sector I: Fig. 131) excavated by Laurenzi in 1927 and G. Becatti in 1938, and conserved by G. Messineo in 1996. All structures were carefully cleaned. Clearing the fill of Becatti's deep trench in room E revealed the collapse of an EByz structure; it had been left in a baulk, which had since collapsed. In room A the bathtubs of the HL baths were carefully restored (Fig. 132). On the E side excavation of surface levels revealed the walls of a large EByz building with a broad open-air area in front (courtyard or garden) and facing on a street oriented NE-SW. Other old trenches were reopened revealing a poros altar and other structures already investigated; and SW of room E, beyond the wall of the HL baths, wall plans and stratigraphy were recovered.</page><page sequence="92">92 DAVID BLACKMAN 131. Lemnos, Hephaisteia: Hellenistic baths 132. Lemnos, Hephaisteia: restored bathtubs In sector II to the S, where Becatti had uncovered the 'house of the columns', the floors of the building were rediscovered, at a different level from sector I. Removal of the surface level between the two areas revealed the SE side of an insula of the EByz period, a road aligned NE/SW, and the SW side of the insula opposite. In the area of the A settlement, surface cleaning was carried out and the old plans checked. The visible antiquities were planned over the whole site, and in particular in the area around sectors I-II, where future excavation is planned.' Koukkonisi. In 1996 the collaborative excavation between the 20th EPCA and archaeologist-researcher H. Bouliotis con- tinued at the PR settlement at Koukkonisi. (AR 2000-01,113) The focal point of the investigation was the peak of the hill. The trenches which had been cut in 1995 revealed three archi- tectural phases: two were dated to the MBA and the third to the end of the EBA ( the Yellow Period of Poliochni). A deeper investigation of the trenches this year uncovered the building remains of an earlier phase. The pottery found here dates the phase to the Red Period of Poliochni. Noteworthy among the finds is the horseshoe-shaped hearth which was uncovered under the wall of an apsidal building. In addition three new trenches were cut parallel to the exist- ing ones which uncovered building remains belonging to the upper architectural phase of site: sections of at least four rec- tangular rooms dated to the late phases of the MBA. Excavation in depth was carried out in one of the rooms which has two entrances and three storage pithoi. The pithoi are situated on one side of the room, in the centre and the two comers. A fourth pithos was found fallen in situ on the floor of the room. The in- depth investigation revealed an earlier architectural phase which is dated to the early phase of the MBA and Troy V. This phase was sealed by a destruction layer which contained traces of burnt deposits and collapsed unworked stones. (ADelt 603-5) Myrina. The Bourdou plot is located in the district where an earlier excavation brought to light a HL and R necropolis as well as a HL pottery workshop (AR 1996-97, 92; 1997-98, 101f.; 1998-99, 100). During a trial investigation, the continu- ation of the workshop was found: six rectangular rooms with walls oriented N-S, built of irregular stones and earth. On the W boundary of the plot were found two pottery kilns (max. diam. 1.18m and 1.50m) which belong to an earlier architectur- al phase. When the workshop was no longer in use, the space was used for three built cist graves, a pithos burial and a rec- tangular sarcophagus. The fill contained abundant HL and A pottery, Megarian bowl moulds, figurines, coins, etc. Of the 12 burials which were investigated, 3 were built cist tombs, 2 tile-roofed tombs, 3 child pithos burials, 3 amphora burials and 1 small sarcophagus. Grave goods included scent bot- tles, a lamp, strigils, glass beads and a gold earring. (ADelt 602) During trial trenching in the Papamali plot, the continuation of a pottery workshop and a road (oriented E-W) were uncov- ered. The road in the N sector of the plot is lined by two walls oriented E-W (max. 1: 10m, max. w. 0.80m). S of the road the workshop building remains were uncov- ered: seven rooms oriented N-S and E-W, with walls of irreg- ular local stone and earth. Following the closure of the work- shop the area was occupied by a HL and R cemetery (as was the case on the Bourdou plot),. Forty graves were investigated: 8 graves built of unworked and semi-worked stones or of vertical slabs with cover slabs (max. 1: 2m, max. w. 0.80m); 15 small rectangular tile-roofed burials, varying in size from 0.65 x 0.35m to 0.90 x 0.57m; 17 amphora enchytrismoi (the amphoras sealed with a shallow disk). The rectangular graves are HL. The fill of the graves con- tained A and HL sherds as well as relief skyphos moulds. In many instances grave goods were placed outside the burials. The tile-roofed graves which were built on the rectangular stone-built grave, contained child burials and are dated to the R period. The grave goods included figurines, scent bottles, lamps, strigils, iron and bronze nails, pyxides, plates, beads, bronze links, a gold pin, bronze mirrors, glass scent bottles, gold wreath leaves, cups, a bronze ring and a small bronze bell. (ADelt 602 &amp; fig. 4) Palaeokastro (rural agricultural district ofAgios Dimitrios). The walls and foundations of anc. structures occupy a large area along the hill parallel to the road Myrina-Moudros. Surface sherds collected from the site are dated to the HL and (mainly) R periods. (ADelt 606) Lesbos Antissa (Agia Varvara District). During the sinking of a well at the site of the necropolis of Antissa, a clay sarcophagus of the Clazomenian type was destroyed. A rescue excavation around the well brought to light 20 burials: 4 sarcophagi, 1 built grave, 2 pithos enchytrismoi, 1 simple burial and 12 enchytrismoi in urns of grey clay of the well-known Lesbian A workshop. All the graves contained 6th-Ct BC A pottery from local and Attic workshops. Among the most significant finds were kylikes, loom-weights, bf lekythoi and amphoriskoi. The fill contained many bfAttic pottery sherds. (ADelt 602 and PI. 183) Eressos. Tsichlionda. Anc. remains were recorded at a shep- herd's enclosure. The foundations of a building are visible, material from which was used for the construction of the enclo- sure. Re-used material included two large stone phalloi, evi- dently votive offerings from a nearby sanctuary. (ADelt 605)</page><page sequence="93">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 2001-2002 93 Meso, the sanctuary. Cleaning work was started at the site: the dry walls which had been built by shepherds and farmers in the 19th-20th Cts were cleared from the N sector of the temple foundations, as was the dense vegetation surrounding the tem- ple. It was observed that the foundation of the N toichobate is 7.95m wider than previously recorded. In the N sector of the temple a field drainage system was uncovered, and in the W sector kilns where architectural members were burnt for lime. Both are dated to the Ott period. (ADelt, 601 &amp; P1. 182 oa-P) Methymna. Demotiko Scholeio. During a rescue excava- tion in the yard of the school, a group of graves was uncovered. The school is on the site which the town of Methymna occupied from the 8th to the 5th Ct BC (ADelt 42, 481) and was later used as a HL and R necropolis. Six cist graves were investigated. The graves were built of irregular dressed stones with the exception of grave II which was tile-roofed and tile-walled. All burials are oriented E-W except one (N-S) (max. dimensions 2 x 1.30m and 2.50 x Im). Grave goods included scent bottles. In the E part of the area a curvilinear wall was found (w. 0.70m, 1: 14m). The fill contained bg sherds and unpainted domestic pottery sherds. (ADelt 601) A trial excavation in Paraliaki Odos Poseidonos before con- struction of an OTE building uncovered a group of 28 graves belonging to the Turkish cemetery of the town. Walls of earlier architectural phases were used in the construction of some graves. Following the removal of the graves, semi-ruined LHL and R building remains were uncovered. Nine rooms are pre- served, defined by walls (max. w. 0.64m, max. I. 6m) built on the natural rock. A rock-carved drainage system which con- veyed rainwater to the neighbouring coast, was also found. On the N slope of the plot a well-preserved, high quality A analemma wall was uncovered, built in the Lesbian technique. The wall uses the rock in part, and survives to h. 2.14m and 1. 4.66m; in front of it a well with a rectangular cross-section was uncovered (w. 1.50m, I. 3.80m, d. 3.30m). Built in the Lesbian construction technique, the well was probably in use up to the Ott period, as indicated by the rubbish with which it was filled, along with bones, pottery and sherds. E of the analemma wall a smaller one built in the Lesbian technique was uncovered (/: 3.30m, h: 0.50m). The fill of the wall contained bg sherds, grey pottery sherds, a bg sherd with a relief animal representation, figurine fragments and terra sigillata sherds. (ADelt 601-2 &amp; fig. 3, P1. 182y) Mytilene. 8th Demotiko Scholeio. The rescue excavation which began in 1996, and continued with the financial support of the Municipality, brought to light a building complex belong- ing to the R period. The central courtyard of the most signifi- cant building on the site is rectangular (11 x 5m); its floor is paved with irregular stone slabs at the edges and clay slabs in the middle. On the S side is a small rectangular cistern (1.30 x 1.26m). The rooms of the house are situated around the court- yard, the most important on the W and the auxiliary rooms on the E and S. Two rooms on the W side were investigated, the N one a 'cubiculum' with a mosaic floor representing the four sea- sons within a rectangular panel and wall paintings with floral decorations and imitation marble designs. The passage leading from the courtyard to the W rooms is a narrow rectangular space with a mosaic floor with repeated daisy motifs. The floor of the S room is destroyed. The auxiliary rooms S of the courtyard are bounded to the S by wall 3, built with a pseudo-isodomic technique and covered with plaster and wall paintings which imitate marble tiles. S of wall 3, specially formed terraces were uncovered on which four rooms were built; 8m away from analemma wall 3, mosaic floor fragments with bird representations and geometric designs were uncovered. Apart from plaster remains, the fill contained rg and bg pot- tery sherds, figurine fragments, lamps, a relief glass vessel, bronze plaques, plaster and wall painting fragments, an intact pithos, bronze coins, bf pottery sherds and a grey-coloured pot- tery sherd bearing the name MINOKPITOY. (ADelt 595 &amp; fig. 1) In Odos Agias Sophias, prior to the construction of a nurs- ery centre, mod. architectural remains found in 1990 (ADelt 45, 395) were removed. Despite the danger of collapse of a neigh- bouring dwelling, the property was thoroughly investigated. Nothing but mud and water were found, however, which sup- ports the view that the site is located within the so-called 'Euripos' channel. (ADelt 595) At Agios loannis Kalivitis, Odos P. Maniati, during con- struction of foundations, four cist tombs dated to the HL period were uncovered and investigated. The tomb cover slabs were found in situ. All four graves were placed on the white poros limestone, oriented N-S, and measured max. 1: 1.95m and max. w. 0.65m. Grave goods included bg scent bottles, a lead pyxis with lid, a rg pyxis with brown decorative bands, a bg one-han- dled cup, a small bg kyathos, an iron strigil, a poorly-preserved oxidized dagger and a bone alabastron. (ADelt 597) Synoikismos District, Odos Charitos and Kratinou. Following the demolition of the early 20th-Ct building and dur- ing the laying of foundations, architectural remains of houses dating to the 3rd Ct AD and the 1st Ct BC-1st Ct AD were inves- tigated. The property is situated on the slopes of Aghia Kiriaki hill where terraces have been specially formed and are support- ed by analemma walls. Wall 8 extends through the whole prop- erty from N to S and constitutes the E boundary of the rooms. On the lower terrace, between walls 8 and 12, there existed a narrow rectangular courtyard (10m x 5.50m) which was investigated in at least two successive phases, and probably belongs to the final architectural phase of the house. Under the semi-ruined floors of the courtyard clay and stone-built water and drainage pipes were uncovered. On the S side of the prop- erty, where a road has been documented, a large drain was found covered with large dressed stone slabs. On the highest terrace, W of wall 8, four rooms belong to the richest apartments of the house. The N room (6.70 x 6.30m) has a well-preserved mosaic floor, wall paintings on its W and S walls and a niche with polychrome marble tiles on the W wall. The main scene of the mosaic, in a medallion, clearly depicts the arrival of Telephos on the Asia Minor coast opposite Lesbos. Arranged in semi-circles around the medallion are maritime subjects, such as Nereids, Tritons and fish. The central scenes are framed within a rectangular panel around which are ivy and vegetation sprouting from kraters, with birds. At the main entrance of the room two antithetical panthers guard the dwelling. The opening in the S wall of the room leads to a paved space with a mosaic floor decorated with polychrome geometric designs. The wall paintings imitate marble tiles and depict bees sucking the nectar from flowers. In the S section of the house two rooms with ruined floors were investigated. The abundance of plaster and mosaic fragments found in the fill indicates with certainty the presence of mosaic floors here as well. A sherds found around a rock-cut well indicate an earlier use of the area. The fill of the site contained finds which included: plaster, mainly cooking vessel fragments, open bg and rg pot- tery sherds, figurine fragments, lamps, an amphoriskos, 11 bronze coins, loom-weights and bone pins. (ADelt 597 &amp; fig. 2) Previously, in the same district were found the house of Menander, the Euripos mosaic (Odos Aginoros) (ADelt 46, 363; 49, 648), the building complex at the 8th Demotiko Scholeio (see above and ADelt 49, 643; 50, 688) and the mosaic floors at Odos Agrafiotou (ADelt 47, 529; 48, 413).</page><page sequence="94">94 DAVID BLACKMAN In Epano Skala during construction of the foundations of a house, architectural remains of two phases of the R period were investigated. These phases rest on HL remains, founded on an A fill whose removal revealed a wall ca. 1.25m long and 0.50m wide. A building belonging to the later R phase I had two rooms preserved at the N end of the property (max. dimensions: 3.30 x 1.34m and 4 x 1.54m). The floor of the S room is preserved, built of irregular rectangular stone slabs. The N room commu- nicates with another room to the E which is beneath the adjoin- ing building. The later building phase was probably destroyed by fire as indicated by the burnt remains found inside the rooms; the stone piles, roof-tiles and sherds dated to the 4th and 5th Cts AD. The most significant finds of this phase include a hoard of 48 bronze coins and figurine fragments. Beneath phase I, an earlier R phase II was uncovered of which there survives a room (3.30 x 3m) with an E and W entrance leading to rooms situated under the neighbouring buildings. The floor is constructed of stamped earth and stone slabs of which in many areas only the make-up is preserved. Traces of white plaster were found on the walls. The fill con- tained some cooking vessel fragments and terra sigillata sherds. The most significant finds included bronze coins, bone pins, a small open unpainted vessel and a large marble mortar which was found in situ. Beneath the foundations of this R phase II, a HL (phase III) building was uncovered, with two walls of a room with a yel- low clay floor (3 x 2.14m). Below the foundations of the HL building only one wall (phase IV) from the A building phase is preserved. It is oriented N-S (max. 1: 1.25m, max. w. 0.20m) and built of irregular stones. An inscription in honour of Trajan was found in the fill of the property. Among the other finds were rg sherds, many pithos fragments and loom-weights, 5 bronze coins, bronze pins and needles. In the fill above and beside the A wall (phase IV) ash- grey and dark Lesbian pottery was found. (ADelt 599) EIOM site. Before a permit was issued for the extension of the establishment and the cutting of a road, a trial and rescue excavation was carried out during which sections of two dam- aged clay sarcophagi were found. The tombs were looted but had belonged to children. An earlier excavation on the same site brought to light the 4th-Ct BC necropolis (ADelt 29, 507-509). Traces of a peribolos wall of unworked stones were also found. (ADelt 599) Sourada District, Odos El. Venizelou. During trial trench- ing on the G. Tsamoura property before the issue of a building permit, a stone-built cist tomb was uncovered (2.10 x lm); its grave goods included 17 unpainted and bg R scent bottles and sea shells. Apart from mainly coarseware R sherds, the fill con- tained a LR coin. During trial trenching on the I. Hatzaki prop- erty anc. remains were found only in the E sector near the sea. The presence of HL terrace walls indicates that the area was probably terraced. The fill contained LHL sherds and figurine fragments. A network of walls was found (w. 0.63m-0.85m, I. 3.65m) which dated to the EBA and corresponds to 'cities' II and III of Thermi. These walls define rooms with pebble and clay floors, and hearths. The fill contained grey pottery of the EBA I phase, and an accumulation of flint products such as flakes, cores and blades. (ADelt 599-600) Akrotiri (Tz. and Ath. Valakou property). During the laying foundations, a LR rectangular pottery kiln was uncovered (3.10 x 2.45m), built of unworked stones bonded with clay; the entrance on the NW is 1.17m wide and was blocked by the remains of the brick superstructure. Inside the kiln are pre- served six stone bases (three on each side). The fill of the kiln contained earth and LR pottery sherds (mainly amphora frag- ments) which were probably in the kiln when it was destroyed. The furnace grate was unfortunately destroyed by the collapse of the superstructure. A peribolos wall (h. 0.75m x w. 0.75m) was found 9.50m SW of the kiln, built of small and medium-sized unworked stones and clay; it was investigated only for a length of 12.45m. In stone piles within the fill of the property were found LR sherds which date the kiln and the wall to the same period. (ADelt 600) Perama. Chalatses District. The rescue excavation (AR 1999-2000, 114) was continued on the site and involved the clearing of stone piles. Following the removal of the first stones, a thick layer of burnt deposit was uncovered which con- tained an abundance of A and G pottery. (ADelt 600) Thermi. Loutropoli. Agios Konstantinos District. During trial trenching an ECh wall was uncovered for 2.20m, oriented SW-NE. The fill contained tiles and glazed ECh sherds with incised decoration.

Scattered in the vicinity of the church of Panaghia Eleousa, ca lkm N of Palaiopolis, are marble archi- tectural members and rock-cut graves. A rescue excavation (the first in the area) found architectur- al remains situated 0.30m-2.40m below ground level; in the W sector of the plot the graves were completely ruined by cultiva- tion work and no remains were found in the N sector. In the cen- tral sector, however, within a 100m2 area well-preserved graves were found, and a section of a cemetery was uncovered, defined on the E by a roughly-built peribolos wall in different phases. The peribolos, built to protect the cemetery from flooding by rainwater due to the sharp slope, does not continue northwards but appears to continue southwards into the unexcavated sector of the plot. The graves which are well preserved are: 1, 2, 6-8. Grave 1 is rock-cut and rectangular (2m x 0.70-0.80m), lined and covered with schist slabs; no grave goods or skeletal remains were found. Grave 2 the largest (3.15 x 2.20m), is a rectangular built grave with walls ca 0.65m thick; no cover slab was found. Slight traces of skeletal remains were found in a rich layer of earth and the finds, which are few in number, were damaged by humidity: a metal object (probably strigil), two pottery vessels and a bronze nail which perhaps belonged to a wooden box. Grave 6 is a small, rectangular rock-cut grave lined with schist slabs (max. w. 1.40m x 0.50m) with one of its narrow sides curved and covered by a row of stone slabs. Grave offer- ings included two Attic bg vessels of the last quarter of the 5th Ct BC, a lekythio and a footless kylix. Grave 7 (2m x 0.90m) is rock-cut with built inner walls lined with schist slabs; it was also covered with schist slabs. No skeletal remains were found. Grave goods included two Attic bg vessels and a girl's doll dated to the last quarter of the 5th Ct BC. Grave 8 is very poorly preserved, with its inner sides lined with schist slabs. No skeletal remains were found and of grave goods only pottery sherds were found. The excavation of the cemetery at Aghia Eleousa is signifi- cant for archaeological research in the wider area of Palaiopolis, where the ruins of the anc. town of Andros are located. The</page><page sequence="95">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 2001-2002 95 unsophisticated grave structures, as well as the scarcity of grave goods in each burial, are evidence of a poor cemetery in a small agricultural settlement situated not far from the town. Dated to the 5th Ct BC, the cemetery indicates the early settlement of the area parallel to the development of the town of Andros. Finally, these finds are the first C artifacts to be excavated on Andros (ADelt 607-8). Tourlos. The I. Komi farm lies in the area of the E cemetery, outside the walls of the anc. town. There is a small old farm building built almost entirely of anc. construction material (AR 2000-01, 116). The owner of the property dug a pit without permission SE of the construction, and antiquities were found. A small rescue excavation was carried out. S of the illegal excavation and immediately below ground surface a rectangular stone-built grave was found without a cover slab (2 x 0.80m). Though relatively small in size, the grave contained at least eight burials of different periods, as indicat- ed by the skeletal remains and in particular the skulls, which were piled together at the N narrow end of the grave. Among the interesting grave goods were a lamp, a bowl, a vessel with plastic bands, a pair of gold earrings, a gold disk with a relief repre- sentation of Dionysos (?) which was probably stitched onto the clothes of the deceased, bone pins and needles, a bronze bracelet, a bronze coin, a sil- ver-plated bronze coin, bronze disk-shaped danakia and numerous iron nails, obviously from the wood- en coffin. The pottery and coins found date the final u grave to the R period. The state of the grave indicates tl bers of the same family were buried there. Skeletal were piled at the side of the graves for the intermei newly deceased, while the skulls were carefully plac narrow end of the grave.

Fragments monuments were collected from the dry walls on the (ADelt 608 &amp; P1. 188). Delos In 2001 F. Muller (French School) continued to dran detailed plan of Sarapieion C and to make drawing blocks belonging to the Ionic portico of the N court. ' the N court were arranged to facilitate access to frag the architrave and frieze. In the process, two unrecorn ments of the architrave of the N portico were found. A restoration of this portico was outlined but much remaii tain. Similarly a restoration of the small tholos was computer, but unknown factors make the restoration ir no vestige of foundation has been found. It measures diameter and may have been the base of a statue. A pai sion of the catalogue of blocks from the sanctuary c with votive monuments (altar and statue bases) was carried out and work was done on the typology of thes ments. Blocks in the area of the House of the School X catalogued and subsequently taken to the museum. H. Siard and a team from the French School ope trenches in the S part of the site in the 'area of the dron first (Fig. 133: S1; Fig. 134), in one of a row of sh against the retaining wall of the W terrace of the s revealed that the construction of the shops was conte 133. &amp; 134. Delos, Sarapieion: west terrace with shops with that of the retaining wall because the party walls between the shops bonded with the retaining wall. Sherds found under the beaten earth floor of the shop, though not very significant, indicated a date later than 150 BC for the construction. In the upper layers of the fill were found granite blocks, col- umn drums and a Doric capital. The Doric capital, but not the column drums, came from a Doric portico of the sanctuary and therefore did not fall from the retaining wall but must have been thrown in deliberately. The fragments of pottery and glass found in the next layer indicate a glass workshop nearby, and a date of the late 2nd/early 1st Ct BC for the fill. The shops, there- fore, must have been abandoned soon after construction, if they were completed at all. It was concluded that the different layers of destruction indicated that the shops were the ground floor of a portico opening on to the terrace of the Sanctuary and not, as previously suggested by P. Roussel, filled in at one time to cre- ate a platform for a later portico. A second trench (Fig. 135: S2) was excavated in order to dis- cover the relationship between temple C and the E/W wall, clear in outline to the E but lost against the SE comer of the temple. The wall was found to be contemporary with the tem- ple because a stone projecting from the latter was incorporated in the wall, and it was concluded from the pottery fragments found in the thick layer around the foundations of both wall and temple, that both dated to a period after 150BC and not, as pre- viously suggested by many scholars, to the C period. Courses of the wall were not found behind the temple, but only survived in the W part of the trench. No explanation was found for the pur- pose of this wall or its partial demolition. A third trench (Fig. 135: S3) was excavated to discover the date and identification of the H-shaped building between the E terrace wall and temple C (Fig. 135 before, and Fig. 136 after excavation). A deep layer of ash found immediately beneath the topsoil contained charred and splintered bones (mostly birds and fish), sherds, coins and clay seal impressions. Under this on</page><page sequence="96">96 DAVID BLACKMAN 135. &amp; 136 Delos, Sarapieion: lI-shaped building 137. &amp; 138. Delos, Sarapieion: propylaea :::;..XMi.R-.X..e^ - oikos, this identification has become unlikely. Moreover, most of the ceramic material found in the hearth dates to the 2nd half of the 2nd Ct and fragments of relief bowls from the Dionysios workshop found in the deepest fill to the W of the trench dated to the end-2nd/beginning-1St Ct BC. The building could not, therefore, have been earlier than the rest of Sarapieion C. Among the 54 coins found was an Attic new style silver drachma issued under Themisto-Theopompos. Alternative dates for this are l49/8 (M. Thomson) and 117/6 (D.M. Lewis and Chr. Habicht). The latter date is now usually accepted. Because of the epigraphic evidence the theory of a connec- tion with the escharon and the archives of the Sarapieion seems attractive. The 38 clay seal impressions found include those with a motif connected with the goddess Isis. They could have been attached to archives or documents connected with the sanctuary, but they were found at all levels and in all parts of the ash deposit, so that it looked as though they were burnt deliber- ately and at different times. It was concluded that the monument was more likely to have been a cult altar to the Egyptian gods. A fourth trench was excavated at the NW end of the E terrace (Fig. 135: S4), in order to shed light on the complex walls of that area. It was found that the N-S wall parallel to the Heraion wall did not extend S into the area of the trench. Moreover, in earlier excavations a trench had been dug the length of the W wall of the terrace, preventing any elucidation of the N and W walls. The fill from these early excavations covered the entire terrace and the walls S and E of this were merely modern walls built on top of the modern Elll. A beaten earth floor was, however, found under this f1ll in the E part of the trench, extending N under the terrace wall and at the same level as the beaten earth floor under the N side was a compact layer of yellowish earth and granitic sand designed to level up the ground before construction. This same fill was found between the N/S wall of the structure and the E terrace wall. A further brown fill on top of this seemed to have been intended to support the terrace wall which was built on it. The E terrace wall, therefore, had been built after the n- shaped structure, but not long after, since the ceramic material in both fills dates from the same period. The Il-shaped struc- ture, sunk deep into the gently sloping ground, is tentatively identified as a sacrificial pit or altar of the Chthonian type. Vallois had suggested that these two buildings were part of an earlier phase of the sanctuary before the building of the Sarapieion C and had been destroyed when the latter was con- structed (R. Vallois, AHHD, 1, 89-92). With the discovery, however, that the building resembled an altar rather than an</page><page sequence="97">ARCHAEOLOGY SN GREECE 2001-2002 97 139. &amp; 140. Delos, Sarapieion: trench 1-2 the dromos. This floor contained pottery of the HL period mixed with some A sherds. So far none of the buildings investigated can be dated before the mid-2nd Ct BC. R. Etienne and M. Wurch-Kozelj for the French School car- ried out test trenching in the N part (S 1-2) and in the S part (S3) of the propylaea. All this area (Fig. 137: trenches l-3) except for lm along the W wall had been excavated previously. R Vallois and G. Gruben had concluded that there were two phas- es of the building before the 2nd-Ct propylaea of the Athenians (R. Vallois, L'architecture a Delos I [1944] 238-242; G. Gruben, 'Naxos und Delos', Jahrbuch 112 [1997] 350-372). As a result of the 2001 excavations along the narrow W strip these conclusions have been radically challenged. In particular, the internal face of the W wall (except possibly for three blocks of the first course) was entirely composed of re-used material. This re-used material came from an A building or buildings (but not necessarily A propylaea). In trench 3 (Fig. 138) three stratified levels were found. The top level consisted of a loose layer of stone chips in which the granite blocks along the W wall were set (therefore belonging to proylaea phase II: 2nd Ct BC). The second level consisted of a hard floor beneath which a thick layer of chips overlay a series of large granite blocks set in a layer of soft earth (level 3) full of carbonized wood and pottery of the 6th Ct BC, beneath which was bedrock. Trench 1-2 covered the area between the E-W partition wall and the N krepis (Figs. 139-40, from W and E). A re-used marble disk column base was found under a block with an egg and dart moulding, among re-used material in the W wall (Figs. 141-2). The E-W partition wall had gneiss foundations set in a cut in the bedrock. These foundations were 2.80m wide and very irregular in appearance. The first course of the wall is made of slabs arranged obliquely on the same orientation as the paving slabs between the oikos of the Naxians and the propylaea. 141. &amp; 142. Delos, Sarapieion: re-used column base</page><page sequence="98">98 DAVID BLACKMAN 143. Delos, Sarapieion: oikos of the Naxians, steps Thus, the E and W walls are not A in date but are composed of re-used material from the A period which might have been from previous propylaea; there must have been something between the oikos of the Naxians and the stoa of the Naxians. The only possible remains on the ground of the A propylaea would be the first course of the E-W partition wall. The first course of the E wall (inside face) which is roughly perpendicu- lar may date from what the excavators call the pre-A I period. The visible remains (phase I) are clearly of a hastily construct- ed building. Whether phase I of the building had columns on the N side is unclear. There is no trace of a stylobate before the 2nd Ct BC. This might have been re-used, but the phase I foundations are identical to the foundations of the krepis of phase II (visible in the SW comer). Moreover, the foundations of the N krepis stop against the steps of the oikos of the Naxians (Fig. 143), indi- cating that the steps were built against the internal face of the E wall of the propylaea and therefore predate it. With the steps of the oikos extending inside the building, it seems unlikely that it would have had columns in antis in phase I. It was not possible to draw conclusions from the data about the date of phase I. There is epigraphic evidence that the propy- laea were repaired extensively in 279 BC as a result of the col- lapse of a column. The rebuilt walls might date from this recon- struction. The French team also excavated a series of trenches in the NE of the sanctuary, in order to define the use of this part of the sanctuary and throw more light on two structures already excavated. It was found that the structures consisted of a few aligned stones on a hard yellow layer containing a few 6th-Ct sherds. There was no trace of the apse which had previously been recorded. It was impossible to discover anything further as the area had already been thoroughly excavated. Further research was done in the 'Water on Delos' pro- gramme led by M. Brunet (French School). Cl. Hasenohr looked at wells, cisterns, and shore lines, examined underwater remains and excavated a sondage beside the quay E of the Sacred Port. The excavation had to be halted because of high ground water level. A team led by B. Bourgeois and P. Jockey (French School) continued their study of polychrome paint on Delian Statues of the HL period. They used a video-microscope, ultraviolet fluo- rescence, photography and graphic restoration to study the ves- tiges of paint on some twenty statues. They demonstrated the wide range of colours achieved by mixing and superimposing colours, e.g. Egyptian blue on pink (probably madder) on a white ground to achieve the lilac blue border of the robe of a Tyche (A 4129). They recorded the subtle refinement of the painted decoration with its eye for detail e.g. the group of Artemis Huntress (A 449), and the play of light and shade with darker colouring to emphasise the fold of a garment e.g. the male draped statue (A 4136) and the draped Aphrodite (A 4200). Research will continue on the techne of the painter- sculptor. The results of previous research were the subject of a paper given at the Academie des Inscriptions et Belles Lettres in March 2001 which will be published in CRAI 2001. F. Alabe with N. Sigalas (French School) completed the colour restorations of the painted plaster ceilings of the two upper floor rooms in the House of the Seals, using gouache paints and comparing the restorations directly with the frag- ments in the Museum. F. Alabe completed her study of these ceilings with a view to writing an article on the ceilings of HL houses on Delos which is due to appear in BCH 125. They are the first examples of decorated ceilings recorded anywhere in the HL world. The ceiling in the larger room had symmetrical decoration of fifteen bands with geometric motifs framing an all-red panel. It seemed similar to the ceiling of a first floor room in the House of the Sword, to judge by fragments found in the destruction level of the latter. The ceiling of the smaller room in the SE cor- ner of the House of the Seals had a panel to be viewed from one direction with three concentric bands with geometric motifs round a quadrangular central field completed on one axis only by three and eight parallel bands all with geometric motifs except for one band depicting two swans facing each other on each side of a metallic amphora. The colour restorations have been fixed to panels for research and display purposes. Ios Recent excavations in the town of Ios, which is largely coex- tensive with the anc. town and its necropoleis, shed light upon the topography, planning and architectural form of the anc. town, as well as the course and date of its fortification wall (ADelt 37, 359; 43, 510-13). A significant number of architectural members, inscriptions, statue bases and sculptures were collected during the supervi- sion of repair and building work and from dry stone boundary walls. Photography and cleaning of the finds began in 1996 in preparation for the planned Archaeological Museum. The most significant find is the upper part of a LA tomb stele, placed face down and used as a step at the main entrance of the Evangelismos church. It was probably taken from the W necropolis of the anc. town, which was probably situated W of the town (Kastro Hill). The stele depicts the upper body of a warrior in profile, turned to the right and holding his helmet in his right hand, and in the other hand the sheath of his sword. Despite the damage, the quality of the work is impressive; so too is the subject, which is very rare and a first from the Cyclades. Part of another LA stele with a similar theme and treatment was found earlier on los (BCH 28, 310-11) showing the legs of a male figure turned to the left. The highly artistic tomb stelai are creations of a Cycladic workshop yet to be determined, but which indicate a rich sculp- tural tradition. Other sculptures found in the area of the anc. town were probably made on los from local marble: the grey marble of Plakoto and the white marble of Palaiokastro where a quarry was in operation from the 18th Ct until a few decades ago. Significant samples of the decorative stone sculptures of the 18th Ct derive from Ios. The quarrying of marble in Palaiokastro during the EBA (for the making of Cycladic fig- urines) and during historical times is possible.

(ADelt 723) Kythnos Loutra. The Maroula site was noted 20 years ago (AJA 79, 277) and dated to a pre-N phase. An urgent rescue excavation fol- lowed the discovery of human skull fragments close to the sea, unearthed by wind and marine erosion. A trench was cut (60m x 30m) and in various places five intact skeletons were uncovered, placed in the cut rock or pits lined with slabs or stones, and covered with large stone slabs. As was commonly practised at the time, the deceased were interred in a cross-legged position. Finds collected during the clearing of tomb 1 included small amorphous obsidian fragments, oyster and snail shells and a fishbone. During the removal of the skeleton the area around the burial was dug deeper and the remains of a child burial were uncovered to the W (grave 5). The remains included skull frag- ments and a few bones. Other burials apparently existed on the site but were eroded by the sea. Skull fragments found in the third grave (6) are preserved. At the E end of the site grave 2 was partly preserved, defined on the N and W by a series of vertical stone slabs, but with noth- ing surviving of the rest. Skeletal remains include bone frag- ments and a row of vertebrae. The position of the bones indi- cates that the deceased was placed in a contracted postion. An oval rock-cut burial (grave 3) was found at the S limit of the settlement (square A12). A stone slab covered the chest of the deceased but was found fragmented due to marine erosion. The tibia bones found indicate that the deceased was placed in a highly contracted position, while the head was turned side- ways facing the SE. Grave 4, which was found in a natural rock cavity, revealed part of a spinal column, vertebrae and a few long bones. From the same space were collected obsidian fragments, snails, limpets and fishbones. E of grave 4 was a rock-cut grave (7), whose state indicates the extent of the destruction suffered by the PR site which stretched over a large area to the E. Apart from the burials, built structures were also observed all over the site. In square B7 a partly-preserved circular struc- ture (2.50m x 2m). is built of numerous stone slabs with small- er stones inserted between them, clearly the paved floor of a hut or other makeshift building. The stones are bedded on orig- inal ground surface over the schist bedrock. In the same space some shells were found, mainly limpets and land molluscs. Another structure (K1) in square F5 is defined by a circle of large and small stone slabs. A human bone was found in the cen- tre of the structure together with an abundance of snails. In squares A9-B9 elliptically placed stone slabs formed structure K3. During the cleaning of the structure, obsidian and quartz stones were found, as well as land molluscs and sea shells. In square B8 large and small stone slabs form an elliptical structure (K4) the floor of which extends into square B7 and approaches structure 2 (K2). Scattered on and around the stones were snails and obsidian fragments. Two more elliptical to irregular asymmetrical structures (K5, K6) were uncovered in squares A10 and A 1. K6 was built on the schist bedrock. There was an abundance of Melian obsidian on the site, much of it heavily worn: fragments of cores, worked flakes, points and blades which had been pressured, not struck. Very few microlithic tools were found, but flint flakes were quite common. Although the stone technology exhibits pre-N fea- tures, no representative tools of the period have been found so far. This has also been observed on other Mes sites in Greece, namely at Yioura on Alonnisos and at Theopetra. Throughout the settlement there was an abundance of land molluscs (snails), and a smaller quantity of sea shells and fish- bones. The total absence of pottery, food remains and other objects indicates the early date of the site, which the C14 dating of a bone sample has placed in the 8th millennium BC. However, more samples have been taken for further dating pro- cedures and it is planned to continue the excavation. Current evidence dates the site to the LMes period which begins slight- ly before the mid-8th mill. BC. It is the first time since the excavation of Mes levels in the Cyclops Cave at Yioura on Alonnisos (see above, under Southern Thessaly), that the existence of a Mes site is recorded in the Aegean. Kythnos is 60 miles from Piraeus but much near- er to Sounion and is one of the Cycladic islands closest to main- land Greece. The nearest island is Kea which is closer to Attica. During the period when sea level had reached its lowest point (i.e. 120-140m lower than at present) 18,000-16,000 BP, a nar- row channel existed between Kythnos and Kea which (like the channel between Alonnisos and Kyra Panaghia) was not diffi- cult to sail through. During the UPal period most of the Cycladic islands (with the exception of Kythnos, Melos and a few others) formed a vast island covering an area equal to two-thirds that of Cyprus, with a rich flora and fauna for Pal hunters and foodgatherers. The distances from mainland Greece were short and relatively easy to traverse even with primitive sailing vessels. Already by the end of the UPal period, obsidian was present at Franchthi and it is most probable that it was transported to the Argolid not directly from Melos but from island to island and via Attica. Later, in the LMes period, there is an abundance of obsidian in Franchthi, the supply of which followed the same route. An equally long route was followed by the Melian obsidian trans- ported to the N Aegean from the 8th millennium BC. (ADelt 608-10) Melos Adamas harbour. Walls were found by the EMA running out from shore to a depth of 7m. The dimensions of rooms were defined, probably of monumental HL-R buildings; sherds and architectural members were scattered on the sea bed. (ADelt 723) Mykonos Phtelia. Excavation at the site continued in 1996 and the exist- ing trenches were deepened, reaching the natural poros bedrock. On the floor of a room in trench B4 obsidian cores, tools and flakes were found which indicates the presence of a working area. Well-preserved pithos-like vessels were also found in another room. Found within the structures were sherds and many intact vessels of various shapes and surface quality. Most of the finds consist of large domestic coarseware vessels. However, many have smoothed, highly polished surfaces, and many have red and white decoration painted on the black polished surface, added after the vessel was fired. This type of pottery is similar to the well-known 'crusted ware' of the Rachmani phase and is dated to the LN II period. Apart from the pottery, an impressive abundance of obsidian tools was found which included many excellent quality arrow- heads and spearheads, indicating specialized hunting skills. Similar arrowheads were found at Saliagos offAntiparos and at the site of Mavri Spilia which is not far from Phtelia. The large number of flakes and a smaller number of cores which were found on the ground surface as well as in the stratified levels of the excavation clearly indicate that the obsidian was processed upon arrival from Melos.</page><page sequence="100">100 DAVID BLACKMAN 144. Amorgos, Katapola: mosaic floor Numerous stone tools used for the processing of cereals (mortars and millstones) were also found. Of particular signifi- cance are the bronze filings and tool fragments found in differ- ent trenches, which indicate the very early appearance of bronze at the site (end of 5th-mid 4th mill. BC) as has been confirmed at other N sites in the Aegean. Impressive among the finds were two clay female figurines (found close to the surface). One is small and steatopygous in type, a characteristic feature of N figurines of Greece. The other, at least 0.30m high, is more unusual, having a long, cylin- drical neck with an oval head tilted backwards; the body is tri- angular, with two knob-shaped protuberances for breasts, a faint hollow at the navel and fat steatopygous thighs. Also found in the excavation were bones of goats, sheep, oxen and birds. The absence of fish bones was noteworthy, and odd, considering the proximity of the settlement to the sea. In addition, relatively few sea-shells were found. This suggests that the inhabitants were oriented towards land cultivation, ani- mal herding and hunting rather than fishing. The wider area of Phtelia has large deposits of water and even nowadays this area supplies the island with water. N remains were found on hills E of Phtelia and in other areas, which indicates a densely populated area from an early period. Following the excavation of the N settlement at Phtelia it is apparent that the so-called barren and infertile island of Mykonos had developed a remarkable culture ever since the N period. The tholos tomb recently found close to the town of Mykonos also indicates a floruit during the Myc period. The excavation is to continue.

(ADelt 699) Kalymnos In March 2001 local inhabitants handed in to the museum a large number of marble statues of very fine quality, mostly HL. Being informed of the find-spot, the 22nd EPCA carried out a limited excavation near the archaeological site of the ECh basil- ica of Christ of Jerusalem, built in the ruins of the temple of Apollo. In an anc. drainage well, as if in an apothetes, were found a large number of marble statues covering a large span of time from the HL to R period. Particularly impressive is a clothed LA kouros with a dedicatotry inscription to Apollo. (Greek press, March 2001) In Damos the rescue excavations of 1995 were continued and completed. Two buildings were defined with a narrow paved stepped street between. They had well-dressed outer walls of stone quarried on site. Building I (17 x 10.5m) to the SE of the street was entered from a court on its SE side; built in the late 3rd Ct, it had seven rooms, of which the core contained an altar in situ and had a tiled roof sloping SE (tiles of Cor type, all stamped ArHOAAQNIOY). In the next room pots found com- plete in the floor by the thresholds indicate foundation ritual. The next room, clearly an andron, was split into three store- rooms in the late st/2nd Ct AD. Building II, partly uncovered, opened onto the street from the NW, and had evidence of pot- tery and metal working activities. (ADelt 697-8) Karpathos Pegadia.

A solid wall 3.20m wide ran E/W for at least 32m and another for at least 18m; a level containing objects of dedicatory type, including iron swords and dag- _ gers, standing female figurines holding birds or seat- ed goddesses, aryballoi (Fig. 146), faience beads, etc. was defined; to the SW was a stepped wall and group of rooms where several building phases were distinguished, and to the SE, under a level with G pottery and figurines, were found remains of Myc buildings; BA remains were also found in test trenches in the N of the site. The plan of the site is not yet clear; it went out of use in the 5th Ct BC. (ADelt 689-90) Cemeteries. At Kretika-Platani, five HL and one R tomb, mainly cists, and a R funerary building were investigated. At the 3rd km of the rural road INiZ I ] from Kos, where groups of HL tombs and a Myc chamber tomb had been found in the past, six rec- 145. Kos: early Christian mosaic floor tangular cist tombs (4th-2nd Ct) and a sarcophagus were discovered; a HL cistern with a later R tile grave; and a Myc tholos tomb (Fig. 147) founded on bedrock, di. 4.14m, with entrance from N. The chamber is best preserved on the E (h. 2.10m). The dromos is 4.30m long, slopes N/S and widens S/N from 1.14 to 1.42m; the entrance jambs are pre- served and the entrance is blocked 1.5Gm to the N. Rich finds came from the lower part of the fill of the chamber and a shallow pit in its floor, including sherds from 39 pots of the LM IIIA2 and LH t IIIC:mid periods (Fig. 148), showing two main peri- ods of use.

(ADelt 685) West sector of city. On Herodotou (Kardoulia site) on the W side of the harbour baths archaeological site, building phases from the Tourkokratia to HL times were revealed. Ott structures had caused deep disturbance. On the E side was found the W part of a R building which is a continuation of the bath com- plex; also remains of stone-built drains and road surfaces against the R buildings. Overlying part of this area were frag- mentary LR walls and a well filled in with ECh material. In deeper levels, under the R buildings, a 2.55m stretch of the bot- tom course of an ashlar wall was found running N/S, and set in a level of sand; behind it was a stone fill. This probably is part of the N fortification wall of the anc. city, part of which was found earlier just SW on Herodotou. To the S on Verriopoulou remains of large buildings were found, surrounding on N, W and S a rectangular area at least 13 x 5.40m. The S and W buildings are HL and the wall on the N is a later addition. On Kleovoulou excavation continued of the house with mosaic floors, W of the anc. gymnasium. Two rooms were excavated with mosaic floors of the ECh period, the best preserved section depicting a kan- tharos, two vine branches and partridges (in blue and green glass tesserae) pecking the bunches of grapes (Fig. 145). These mosaics were lifted and test trenches confirmed their ECh date and revealed earlier, mainly HL, building phases. Well outside k _ the anc. city wall a HL building of uncertain use and a ER tile ' : 4 grave were found on Philinou, and on Ethnikis Antistaseos a tm well whose upper fill contained HL and R sherds.

Kos, Kretika-Platani: pottery from tholos tomb and the number of chamber tombs in the Aegean is very limit- ed (Tenos, Panaztepe, Kolophon). At the 4th km of the rural road a R cistern was found, with two phases of use and a R building connected with irrigation. (ADelt 690-2) At Lampe, north of Kos city, the EMA investigated an area 50-70m offshore in 5-8m depth, where a marble statue had been found; many stone architectural members were found part- ly buried in the sand, some datable to the 6th-7th Cts AD, possi- bly from a wreck of a ship bringing material for the construc- tion of the ECh basilica excavated in 1935 at Kumburu, N of Kos city at Point Skandario.

At 28 October and Phanouraki in the NW part of the anc. city an anc. insula was found, defined by street P2oa on the N, P38 on the E, P26 on the S and P28 on the W. The N/S length of the insula was 32m, more than the normal 26.10m. Remains of buildings of four phases were found from the 2nd half of the 4th Ct BC with a fine andron and court. The second phase is LHL, the third is 1st Ct BC/AD, and the fourth R. On Ammochostou and Phanouraki remains of LHL buildings were found at foundation level. (ADelt 672-5) In the old city excavation of part of a large anc. building on Ippodamou was started in 1994-5 by the 4th EBA, and contin- ued in 1996 by the 22nd EPCA. (ADelt 675) S sector. On Odos Venetokleion work continued in the area of the 'lower gymnasium' and revealed the levelling of the rock for its central court. (ADelt 675) W Cemetery. On Odos Kamirou 12 pit graves were found and two coffins; only one contained grave goods (late 4th Ct) but all must date from the same period since anc. quarrying removed all but the lowest part of the walls. One had traces of primary cremation. The clay surfaces were found which may be of a LHL cemetery road. On the extension of Peiraios excavation of the site was com- pleted with five more rock-cut pit graves and four coffins, cir- cular in section (EHL); one grave contained an unpainted hydria with a cremation burial. (ADelt 675-6) Central cemetery. On Athenon and Lardou three rock-cut pit graves were found disturbed and robbed, with a little 3rd-Ct pottery; also the remains of eight rectangular and seven circular coffins, mostly robbed. On Athenon (Tzoyia plot) 32 pit graves were found, 12 coffins and two burial pits cut in the bedrock containing cinerary urns. Few retained their cover slabs and most were robbed. The grave goods were the usual ones for the HL period (3rd Ct). On Papandreou and Volou 10 rectangular rock-cut pit graves were located, six with cover slabs but only three with grave goods relatively intact (1st half of 3rd Ct). On Embonas and Ap. Pavlou three long rock-cut burial pits were found, with traces of cremation. At Mytilenes seven rectangular built tombs contained 3rd-Ct material. On Konst. Ydreou one circular coffin and three rock-cut pit graves were found, badly robbed; probably 1st half of the 1st Ct BC. (ADelt 676-9) E cemetery. On Dendrinou near the HL fortifications a line of five built chamber tombs was found oriented E/W, some with plastered walls; all were robbed and cannot be certainly dated. On Philerimou (Hatzisavva plot) another part was found of the HL burial complex investigated in 1989 and 1991, with the same stepped formation from W to E and rock-cut or built tombs. Some funerary monuments (altars, stelae, large marble vessels) had fallen from a rock-cut platform into the area of the burials below.

Search for further tombs in the Myc cemetery at Aspropelia continued to the N and NE; NE of tomb 2 and 6m from the E side of its dromos the dromos of another tomb was found on the same N/S orientation, and serving two chambers, 5A and 5B. The main chamber 5B was badly damaged, but not robbed. Chamber 5A was rock-cut on the W side of the dromos; its door was still blocked but it was robbed through the roof in the late 1st/early 2nd Ct when a tile-covered burial was made on the N side of the chamber. The dromos is 10.80-90m long and 1.70m wide, narrowing to 1.55m at the tomb entrance; it slopes down from 0.40-0.60m to 2.20-2.50m below the road surface; the floor of tomb 5B was only 1.40m below and must have been approached up a ramp from the dromos. Many sherds of LH IIIA-C pottery were found in the dromos. Chamber 5A (2.50 x 2m) is earlier than 5B: the Myc sherds left against its S side are LH III2A-IIIB or LH IIIA2: late. Chamber 5B (2.60m x 2.20m) was badly preserved, but three LH IIIB pots were found intact on the floor in the E part, including a 'Zygouries' kylix (Fig. 149); 19 in the N and central part, from late LH IIIA2 (Fig. 150: small hydria) to early IIIC (Fig. 151: small 3-handled jug). Many bones from early burials were found heaped among the pottery. The latest burial lay undisturbed along the W side 152. amphoriskos with 3 pots ofLH IIIC: mid/late (Fig. 152: an amphoriskos) and a bronze knife. A further Myc chamber tomb (6) was found on the SW side of the hill, damaged and robbed in R times; the chamber measured 3.80 x 2.65m; two LH IIIA2 late pots were recovered. Tests on the NW and NE sides of the hill found no further tombs. The surviving tombs are in line from SW to NE and further tombs N and NE of tomb 5 must have been destroyed by agricultural terracing. (ADelt 684-5) Theologos. Excavation continued at the sanctuary of Apollo Erethimios. (AR 1998/99, 112) The apothetes of amphoras and overlying LHL everyday wares was defined and excavated. A new area was opened to the N and W revealing a building of stoa type, running E/W, with six rooms, two containing fallen roof-tiles and one a burnt wooden column; date: LHL/ER. A section cut between this building and the theatre revealed early 3rd-Ct building remains and a change of grid between stoa and theatre.

(ADelt, 635-8 and fig. 9: Fig. 156: plan of the M palace) G. Rethemiotakis reports on the 2001 excavation season: 'The area in front of the NW entrance of the palace was investigated, excavation of building 4 was completed and building 3 was dug including the space between buildings 2 and 3. Building 4 con- sists of two small rooms with entrances to the N fac- ing the area of the great court. They date to LM IIIA2-B according to the associated sparse pottery. A large pithos was found in room A, which has par- allels with the pithoi from the storage rooms in the W wing of the Knossos Palace. The enclosed yard was used for domestic outdoor activities around a central hearth. A chlorite sealstone depicting a female dancer was also found. NW court and streets: under the foundation of building 4 sections of the paved court and street leading to the NW wing of the palace were uncov- ered. A raised walkway (w. 1.20m) was traced for 10m. The same street turns at 90? along the N facade of building 3 leading towards the palace. The func- tion of a circular feature constructed out of pithos sherds located in the floor in front of the W facade of the N wing remains uncertain. L-. Building 3 is at least 230m2, but its NW part is not preserved higher than bedrock. The central sec- tion dates to MM IB (rooms 2, 3 and corridors 5, 6), but was re-used and expanded in MM IIIB and LM M.vd Al IB. The original MM IB walls are strongly built with , roughly faced blocks. The walls of room 2 were, " faced with small stones, possibly benches or bases - for objects. The partly preserved floor was covered - by two layers of plaster: the earlier orange coloured plaster with a bright red surface, whereas the later plaster floor was white. Immediately to the right of 156. Gals the entrance three small animal figurines were placed one on top of the other within a shallow depression. Along the E side of the room and on the floor MM IB 'red fabric' vessels of the Kastelli workshop were found and included carinated cups, a cylindrical cup and cups with a 'metallic' finish (walls thin in section). The nearby room 3 pre- served a section of its paved floor, which continued into corri- dor 5 underneath its blocked entrance. It was associated with MM IB pottery. A large built 'kasella' along the N side con- tained a few Neopalatial conical cups and a juglet. Corridor 5 was paved in the old palace period but had sub- sequently been cleaned and re-used during the Neopalatial peri- od. A large stone serpentine lamp with foot was found within the fill of the corridor. Corridor 6 dates to the Neopalatial period whereas in MM IB the area had a different appearance: across the centre of the room were two balustrades set very close to each other. The area was approached from the W exterior wall but only sections of this were found. The entrance was equipped with F-shaped limestone doorjambs; only the left one was found in situ. Opposite the entrance there was a niche with a raised paving, equipped with a bench. This feature can be interpreted as an old palace period version of the balustrade shrine. The absence of any finds is due to the re-use of the space within the Neopalatial period. During this later phase the narrow gap between the balustrades was eliminated and the space was used for storage. 22 e kvdxTOQO ralaid MmUlm - YMUA i'mu 17dm - vmii atas: Minoan palace Three pithoi, small vases, a fragmentary knife, two bronze tweezers, a lead disc-shaped weight and chlorite sealstone depicting a lion were found within a LM IB destruction deposit which contained carbonized organic matter and disintegrated mud-brick which formed the make-up of the roof. Apart from the partial re-use of this MM IB building new sections were added in MM IIIB along the N, E and W sides. The added walls are of different construction, thinner with ashlar blocks along their exterior face. Rooms 1 and 4 (a and b) formed a complex of rooms con- sisting of an anteroom and two interior rooms. The anteroom was the largest and was possibly equipped with a central sup- port for the ceiling founded on three slab-like stones positioned in the centre of the room. The wide exterior door, located along the W wall, was found blocked by a drystone wall, constructed in LM IB when the function of the complex changed. The destruction deposit, which was similar in nature to that of cor- ridor 6, was traced only in sections: amongst the pottery found was a large stirrup jar. The threshold leading to room 4b was found in situ and bore traces of the dowel holes for the doorway. The associated white plaster floor was only partially preserved and associated with a double doorway in MM IIIB. During LM IB this complex changed function, when the double doorway was eliminated</page><page sequence="106">106 DAVID BLACKMAN 157. Gortyn: stadium andthe unified room 4 became a storage room. The floor was slightly raised (and its fill contained exclusively MM IIIB pot- tery) and was equipped with a large stand. The destruction deposit of room 4 contained large quantities of high quality LM IB pottery, two pithoi, a large rectangular serpentine offering table, fragmentary stone vases, a potter's wheel and two thin sheets of gold. In conclusion, it seems that during LM IB the most impor- tant parts of the building were abolished (such as rooms 4a and 4b) and emphasis was given to storage of goods and vessels. A raised stand was possibly the base for an exterior staircase, located E of the old palace period facade, which led to the upper floor. There is a direct link between the palace and the extension of the pre-existing house during MM IIIB; the latter probably had an auxiliary function to the palace building if not as an annexe to its N wing. The paved court with the raised walkway described above is defined by the W exterior wall of building 3 N wing. To the west a room was added in MM IIIB. The fill contained large quantities of badly preserved MM III pottery and included large quantities of fragmentary conical cups, cups with a raised foot, tripod cooking pots, shallow dishes and many animal bones. The room seems to have been used for feasting ceremonies, whereas the raised stand could have been used by individuals or groups for display. The excavation record supports the argu- ment that the organisation of ritual feasting ceremonies was an important aspect of the palace and other large urban buildings 158. Gortyn: aerial view such as building 3. It has been observed that assemblages of cooking, eating and drinking vessels together with quantities of animal and fish bones are found near or within rooms of the palace or building 3. Such are the 'column hall', the 'pillar hall' in relation to the kitchen along the E wing of the palace and room 22 in the W wing of the palace and the Minoan Hall with its supporting rooms in the N wing. Area between buildings 2 and 3: a series of zig-zag walls were discovered, running under the LM IB building 2 and fol- lowing the W facade of building 3. The loose fill contained Neopalatial pottery. At a lower level building remains dating to MM IB were traced. EM I pottery including a sherd of the Agios Onouphrios style was found.

A. Di Vita (Italian School) reports on the 2001 season: 'Continuing from the 1999-2000 seasons, work in the stadi- um (Fig. 157). proceeded in the area just inside the N analem- ma wall, to define the stratigraphic sequence down to the levels of the first phase of the monument. The occupation levels of the first phase were defined, with the projection of the euthynteria course and the W comer of the door-chamber. The square of the altar: the area immediately W of the altar was investigated, between it and the adjoining open room S of the temple, which was excavated in 1999. Remains were found of a wall preserved only at its foundation course, parallel to and partly covered by the S wall of the room, and providing evi- dence of an earlier arrangement of the area than we had hither- to found. The complete demolition of earlier structures and lev- elling up of the area attest precisely the time of construction of the temple: passages were left at the side of the building and a broad square behind it where the altar of OEe6s 'YjWtrTc6 still functioned and where it was still possible to enter the stadium which was then still functioning. Investigation of the E road produced an impres- sive stratigraphy with at least 10 surfaces. A large number of blocks were recovered at the SW comer of the 'temple of the Augustan Gods', enabling a reconstruction of the architectural sequence. D. Manacorda and E. Zanini carried out a mag- netometer survey (FM36 fluxgate gradiometer) in the area between the temple of Apollo Pythios and the 'praetorium' complex (Fig. 158). Traces were found of the grid of a LR and Byz domestic and industrial quarter. The area chosen is crucial for the study of the settlement plan of the C city and its later transformation. F. Ghedini and J. Bonetto carried out a magne- tometer survey, with similar equipment, in the area of the 'little theatre' beside the temple of Apollo; anomalies were found the orientation of which sug- gests structures related to the theatre, its stage build- ing and a stoa connected with the theatre.'</page><page sequence="107">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 2001-2002 107 Gournes (Apodoulou). The joint excavation of L. Godart (University of Naples) and J. Tzedakis (Ministry of Culture) continued in 2001. On the W side of the hill four rooms of the early palace period were revealed, contemporary with structures excavated in previous years on the S side of the hill; early palace period pottery included 'barbotine' sherds. Above these levels were found structures of the late palace period (LM IA pottery), contemporary with those excavated by Sp. Marinatos in the 1930s. On the S side of the hill was revealed another storeroom for products brought in from the fields to the little palace. The new room is clearly dated to MM IIB like all the other storerooms on the S side of the hill. While the hypothesis of destruction by earthquake followed by fire is confirmed for the Early Palace Period, the destruction of the Later Palace Period was caused by fire, but for reasons not yet known.

Pottery from Phaistos dates to MM IIB (18th Ct BC). (ADelt 643-4) Kastelliana. S. Mandalaki reports on the discovery of a much- destroyed MM IIIB-LM IA building, possibly a farmstead, located at the top of a natural elevation in the landscape (Androulaki plot).

Rethemiotakis reports the hand- ing over of fragmentary animal and human figurines together with fragmentary MM IIIB-LM IA, SM, G and A pottery. One of the human figurines dates to LM IIIB, all others to SM and PG. This important assemblage, presumably deriving from some sanctuary, possibly came from illegal excavation at the nearby hotel site. (ADelt 644-5) Knossos, Venizelio Hospital. E. Grammatikaki reports on an extensive rescue excavation programme conducted in the immediate vicinity of the Venizelio Hospital, located in the out- skirts of the R town of Knossos in the area of the N cemetery. Finds include: a partly destroyed chamber tomb used during the HL period as a rubbish dump; two LM IIIC-SM chamber tombs; a monumental funerary building (mausoleum) of the 1st Ct BC-1st Ct AD; a R cistern; remains of a large R building; a complex of LR kilns; a 3.90m-wide paved road running SW-NE which was traced for 17m, and was probably the main approach to the cemetery; an LM II chamber tomb; HL and R house remains; two wells used as rubbish dumps containing G to R pottery; and a series of tombs of the 1st and 2nd Cts AD. (ADelt 624-30) Villa Dionysos. In 2000, Dr E. Hatzaki (BSA Knossos Curator) conducted a test at the Villa Dionysos Viridarium (AR 2000-01, 130). In 2001, Prof. N. Coldstream processed the pot- tery from the Gr and R levels; Mrs N. Coldsteam was draftsper- son. Dr E. Hatzaki has completed the section on stratigraphy of the M, Gr and R levels and is currently processing the M pot- tery (one massive LM I fill). Dr A. Sarpaki supervised the pro- cessing of the bio-archaeological samples collected during the 2000 excavation season. Mrs V. Isaakidou (UCL) is processing the faunal material and Mrs A. Livarda (Sheffield University) the seeds. Publication of the M, Gr and R levels is planned for the 2003 BSA Annual. Dr E. Hatzaki reports on the 2002 excavation season at the Little Palace north section: 'The research objective is to place the Little Palace and Unexplored Mansion sites within their urban contexts from the M to the R period by employing a detailed recording and recov- ery strategy. An area measuring 20m E/W x 3.5m N/S was exca- vated in three trenches with one metre wide baulks between them. The LP old metal fence formed the northern border of the excavated area. Special emphasis was placed on recovery pro- cedures, context recording, architectural and archaeological section drawing, and intensive bio- and geo-archaeological sampling. A complex architectural and stratigraphic sequence was revealed of particular importance for the LM III period. G occupation phases, although badly preserved due to subsequent activities, are significant in their rarity, whereas the succeeding R architectural remains and stratigraphic sequence will con- tribute to our understanding of the town's later history. All ancient remains are buried under thick layers of post-1900 soils deriving from the Evans Little Palace, German 1942, but also the Sackett and Popham Unexplored Mansion spoil heaps: M levels: a branch of the Little Palace drain was found run- ning NNW-SSE, also traces of paving associated with the main part of the drain. The paving had been cut in mature LM IA by the construction of an ashlar wall, founded on bedrock. The nature and purpose of this ashlar wall remain obscure as its con- struction seems to have been abandoned prior to its completion. The Little Palace drain seems to have been eliminated when an ashlar wall running N-S was constructed. This wall enclosed on the west a white plastered courtyard opening to the north of the Little Palace and dating to LM IIIA1/2. A succession of six open-air surfaces dating at least up to LM IIIA2:late were revealed, associated at a certain time with a drain outlet and subsequently with two terrace walls. Preliminary dating of the pottery confirms a ceramic sequence from LM II, LM IIIA1 to LM IIIA2, although further study is necessary in order to define whether the (elusive at Knossos) LM IIIB phase is present. Parts of a substantial late LM IIIB (or early LM IIIC) house were uncovered, partially built on top of the destroyed Little Palace. Its foundation must be contemporary with the establish- ment of the new houses at the Stratigraphical Museum exten- sion site. At some time, a LM IIIC destruction debris seems to have been re-deposited outside of the house. There are indica- tions that the house's walls were visible and possibly used well into the Iron Age.</page><page sequence="108">108 DAVID BLACKMAN G levels: as usual at Knossos G levels were severely dis- turbed by later building phases. Nevertheless some occupation surfaces have survived dating to the G period. Evidence for met- allurgical activity in the form of a small fire pit dates to the O period. Pits date to G, O and C periods. The upper fill in a well, partially excavated by Evans, revealed a 1st Ct BC L HL deposit, possibly related to a nearby contemporary paved surface. R levels: remains of a R house, with at least two major build- ing phases, were uncovered. The earliest phase is associated with a paved area (impluvium?) and drain, the latest phase asso- ciated with abandonment dating to 2nd Ct AD (roof tile collapse, followed by wall collapse). Subsequently the house was severe- ly robbed of its walls and other architectural fittings, sometimes even of its deep foundations; robbing pits date to 2nd/3rd Ct AD. Other contemporary pits probably reflect a variety of activities in the area since they contain substantial quantities of butchered bone, metal and glass slag. The continuation of a R road found during the 1967 Unexplored Mansion excavations was traced along the west edge of the excavated area. It predates the foun- dation of the R aqueduct still visible along the north edge of the Unexplored Mansion excavation'. Kommos. Joseph and Maria Shaw (ASCS) report on the 26th season (2001): 'We cleaned the site, also renewed its perimeter fence and supported a high scarp that threatened to collapse. Toward the end of the season, architect/archaeologist Clairy Palyvou began a study of conservation for the site (scarps, cement work, joints) that we plan to initiate next year (see below). Sifis Fasoulakis, foreman and guard, continued his year-around work of planting trees, bushes and vines near the perimeter fence and above modern supporting walls. This year we had our first success in rooting tamarisk trees NW of building T, thanks partly to water supplied by the Pitsidia community. If these trees flourish they will prevent sand from drifting onto the site as it has in the past. At the study center/storeroom in Pitsidia our chief aim has been to complete the fieldwork for vol. V on the monumental Minoan buildings (the 'civic center') that partly underlie the Greek sanctuary. By December we hope to have ready for our editor Cy Strom the relevant chapters on architecture (J. Shaw), pottery (A. Van de Moortel [ASCS] and J. Rutter [Dartmouth College]), plasters (M. Shaw), as well as the concluding chapter (J. Shaw and others). At the same time we are planning ahead () 159. Magarikari: Middle Minoan buildings for a monograph on LM House X, rich in architecture and small finds, that lies N of the civic center. Van de Moortel is also working on an article on an unusually definitive MM IIB pot- tery group. Deborah Ruscillo (University of Manitoba) has done the fieldwork for a study of murex and purple dye. Highlights in the past year have occurred in our on-going publication series. In November, after years of effort in a com- plex joint enterprise, volume IV, The Greek Sanctuary, emerged in two parts, text and illustrations. This interdisciplinary work encompasses the sanctuary's history from the time it was found- ed ca 1,020 BC above the Minoan Palatial remains, through its abandonment ca 170 AD, over a millennium of ritual activity. Separate chapters detail the architecture and stratigraphy (J. Shaw), graffiti and inscriptions (Csapo, Geagan, Johnston), the pottery (Callaghan, Johnston, Hayes, Bikai), sculpture (M. Shaw), miscellany (various), fauna (Reese, Rose) and flora (T. and J. Shay), with a final chapter of synthesis (J. Shaw). A second Kommos monograph, emerging as Hesperia Supplement 30 as this report is written, is the analysis of the LM IA Ceramic Kiln found in the S stoa of Palatial building T. The kiln is the first of its type found of which the contents and the rich ceramic dumps prove its function. Chapters on its form and function (J. Shaw), pottery (Van de Moortel) and ceramic analysis (Day, Kilikoglou) detail all aspects. Now the Gr Sanctuary and the M kiln have been published, and the way for the monumental M buildings and house X seems clear, more of our major effort can be devoted to the preparation of the site so that it can be opened to the public. This entails simple conservation (above) but also the building of an entranceway/guardhouse, sanitary and parking facilities, paths, bridges and platforms, as proposed by James Stratis in 1998. We ourselves will take care of the walls and scarps, while we are hoping that the Ephorate and the Archaeological Service, with the help of EC funds, can complete the remainder. If this cooperative effort is successful, the site will take its place along with Aghia Triada, Gortyn and Phaistos as a main archaeologi- cal attraction of Southern Crete.' Lendas. A. Vasilakis reports on rescue excavations conducted at the R settlement which included the following: at the Apostolakis plot cisterns and building remains were associated with domestic pottery, lamps, glass and iron fragments and bone pins. At the Kotsiphakis plot part of a large R building dating to the 2nd-3rd Ct AD was discovered. At the Papadakis plot, two monolithic columns were discovered asso- ciated with 2nd-3rd Ct AD pottery. At the Petrakis \^~sc plot and the Christophorakis plot building remains were uncovered, associated with domestic pottery. "0&gt;t&amp;?i At the Sphiridakis plot building remains associated with domestic pottery of the 3rd4th Ct AD were found. At the Tsapakis plot 5th-6th Ct AD domestic A O pottery was collected. Six monolithic columns of a grey-white marble were discovered fallen in an E-W direction at the Palieraki plot. Excavation will continue in the following year. (ADelt 642-3) Magarikari. E. Andonakaki reports the discovery of two MM buildings with apsidal room and ante-cham- ber (Fig. 159) at Kokkinichoma (Kougioumtsakis plot). Further excavation revealed that the use of these was not funerary as they contained large quan- tities of ash and very fragmentary and sparse MM IA to MM III pottery. The two buildings, judging from the mountainous location, were possibly associated with pastoral activities. (ADelt 641) A A CCLcJ? "L-</page><page sequence="109">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 2001-2002 109 Malia. A team from the French School led by A. Faroux and J. Driessen completed their study of the stratigraphy of area Nu concentrating on material from pit 1 excavated in 1965 by A. Dessenne, in 1977 by J.-C. Poursat and in the campaigns of 1988 and 1989. The pottery ranged from LM III A2-B1 with a few MM and LMI sherds. The LM III material (mostly eating and drinking vessels) was of exceptional quality and included: stirrup jars (large and small), cups (conical and otherwise), bowls (shallow and deep), kylikes, kalathoi, ladles, pyxides, kraters, tripods (and other ceramic vessel supports), and frag- ments of terracotta tiles. There were also the hieroglyphic tablets already published and fragments of bronze objects and pots imported from Chania. The number of pots from pit 1 was estimated at ca 530, far more than from pits 2 and 3 (ca 50 and 25 respectively). Few could be entirely restored, suggesting that they were broken before being thrown away. Some joins were found between sherds from pit 1 and sherds found beneath the last occupation level and it was concluded that pit 1 contained remains of a destruction level before the last occupation, possibly a ritual deposit (e.g. after a festival?); a large number of joins were made within the pit itself, indicating that it was the result, main- ly, of a single event. It was observed that digging pits round habitations seems to have been typical of Crete in LM III, but was not a Minoan custom. Different members of the team were involved in: the descriptions of pots; drawings; conservation work (50 complete pots restored); taking pottery samples for analysis in the Demokritos laboratory; completing the pottery catalogue (550 complete pots); checking descriptions and drawings; studying motifs, small finds, ceramic tiles and obsidian objects. The human remains were re-studied and a second victim (female) of the earthquake which destroyed the complex was found. These bones (unlike those of the 25-year-old man) were dispersed and had been previously recorded as animal bones. The architectural study was continued and comparisons made with other LM III sites. The description of individual rooms and objects from past excavations were integrated into the stratigraphical study. P. Darque, A. van de Moortel and a team from the French School continued their study of the area NE of the palace. All the Neopalatial pottery was examined and the working docu- ments on the main Neopalatial deposits were edited. The exca- vation day-books were entered on a Filemaker data base, mak- ing the 936 stratigraphic units of the excavation accessible to the whole team. Further study was carried out on the stone vases and on the architectural and stratigraphic records. 250 pots were drawn and of these nearly 100 have reached a final form with the help of the Adobe Illustrator programme. All the photographic records were digitized at the French School in preparation for the final publication. A paper entitled 'Late Minoan I architectural phases and ceramic chronology of Malia' was read by P. Darcque and A. van de Moortel at the Cretological Congress in October, com- paring the three Neopalatial architectural phases of the site with the four stages of ceramic development during LM I. Their con- clusions confirmed that the palace ceased to function at the end of LM IB. Meleses. G. Rethemiotakis reports the discovery of masonry, brought to light by deep ploughing, which is associated with HL pottery. Finds include a pithos and pottery dating to the 3rd Ct BC.

La Rosa (Italian School) reports on the 2001 season: 'Re-examination of the stratification of the Levi excavation continued with a test excavation in the area of the North Road. S of the 'House S of the Ramp' we investigated a limited area between the side of the 'G road' on the E and wall M/49 (already excavated by Levi) on the S. The considerable deposit (up to 4m) preserved a long sequence covering at least 4 mil- lennia, from the R imperial period to the Neolithic (Fig. 160). The most important find was probably the remains, with many gaps, of a monumental structure, with a long, slightly rhomboid plan, which can be dated to the Neopalatial period. Inside the building on the E side was a staircase leading to a paved area (also of LM IB); we have here probably a basement (ca 8 x 3.50m) approached by the staircase. This structure, lying fairly close to the W court and substantially contemporary with the reconstruction of the palace, is an unexpected element in the city grid of the Neopalatial period, but difficult to assess because we cannot define its function. For the first time at Phaistos we have a sequence of four rooms preserved (o/1, 2, 3, 4) from the N period to the end of the Prepalatial period, with different wall constructions but the same orientation as the great wall of the EM II house found last year. Of room -c/ the SW comer is preserved and a rich destruc- tion level dating to a transitional phase EM III/MM IA. Such a phase, completely distinguished only this year, is characterized by three ceramic shapes, related to sherds of the 'white style': bell-shaped small bowls (all polished, with or without spout), handle-less cups with low walls and strong finger-marks of the potter on the base, and small plates with discoid foot, also with clear finger-marks. Of room oa/2 we can only reconstruct the outer face of the W wall, below the E wall of the 'basement', with EM III sherds from the overlying level. Of room (/3 we have only the SW comer, dated to EM II and sealed under a layer of nodular concrete; this technique of back-filling and arranging earlier remains was identified by Levi in the quarter SW of the First Palace, and must be dated at least a millennium earlier.' Poros, Katsambas. E. Banou reports on the discovery of remains of a M building at the Liounis plot associated with LM IB and LM IIIA pottery. LM II and LM IIIB pottery was also found, but not necessarily associated with building remains. A thick destruction deposit contained LM IIIA1 pottery. A LM IB destruction deposit, rich in pottery, was found at a lower level. (ADelt 630-2) N.

A complete bronze ingot was found 20m to the S. (ADelt 632-3) N. Demopoulou also reports the discovery of M remains at Odos Nidas: a natural cavity in the bedrock was used as a rub- bish dump predominantly in the Neopalatial period and con- tained MM III/IIIB-LM IA pottery but also MM IB-II. The existence of a series of rubbish pits along the outskirts of the M settlement of Poros containing a variety of material from differ- ent contexts (workshops, houses) implies well organized clean- ing operations during the late Neopalatial or early Postpalatial period.

The building was much destroyed by illegal excava- tion. (ADelt 641) Smari. D. Hatzi-Vallianou (Archaeological Institute of Crete) reports on the continued excavations at the acropolis of Smari. In room El, on the S side of the acropolis, a M destruction deposit was found dating to MM IB-II. Excavation continued in the central room of megaron A. Along the W wall and below the level of the EG foundation the cranium of a bull was discovered placed on a stone construction, possibly a M wall. The cranium was associated with stone querns, carbonized seeds and conical cup sherds, bones and horns. In the opisthodomos of megaron A two architectural phases are represented by distinct architectur- al features, such as the two superimposed stone thresholds dat- ing to the LG-O and EG periods but also associated deposits. The opisthodomos of megaron B is associated with paving dated by the associated pottery to the LG-O period. Along the N side of the acropolis between megaron A and the N peribolos was found much disturbed G-O paving associated with pottery deriving from large vessels such as pithoi. Within the Athena sanctuary a small sounding was made down to M levels; outside of the N wall a complete female bust of Athena was found sim- ilar to those found in the interior of the sanctuary during the 1995 excavation season (cf. ADelt 50, 784-6 fig. 4). The area outside the W peribolos was also investigated; the M walls must have been visible during the G-O periods. Furthermore, no but- tresses were discovered.

Iliopoulos reports on the rescue exca- vation conducted at Gerontomouri Lasithiou: a large section of an MM IIIB-LM IA burial pithos was discovered, similar in type to those from the contemporary cemeteries of Pachia Ammos and Sphoungaras. This discovery indicates that the site of Pervoli might be the location of the cemetery for the nearby M settlement. (ADelt 654) Philip P. Betancourt (ASCS) and Costis Davaras (University of Athens) report on the 2001 study season: 'The Agios Charalambos Project worked in Crete in July-August, 2001. Sherds from the excavations of 1976-1983 were moved from the Agios Nikolaos Museum to the INSTAP Study Center where they were studied in detail. Plans were also made for the beginning of excavations in 2002. Sherds from excavations of 1976, 1982 and 1983 (cf. AR 1990-91, 70) had all been saved, so that good results were obtained from their detailed examination. The fragments were divided first by fabric, then by shape and date, and finally by the portion of the vessel preserved (rim sherds, body sherds, han- dles, spouts, etc.). All sherds were recorded on statistical tables that presented a detailed statistical division of the pottery. The total (over 18,000 sherds) was large enough for good statistics. Individual examples of each class were drawn, measured, and described individually. The results of the study provide sub- stantial amounts of new information about the pottery of the site of Agios Charalambos itself as well as the history of the Lasithi Plain in general. The pottery provides a good basis for the chronology of the burial cave. The earliest material, as noted by the excavator at the time of the excavation, consists of coarse, heavily bur- nished, handmade pottery from the FN period to EM IA period. Vessel shapes from this phase include open cups and bowls, flat-based bowls on high bases, and only a few closed vessels. Also present are sherds from EM and MM, including dis- tinctive pieces from EM I, EM IIA, EM IIB, and EM III, as well as from MM I and II. The cave must represent a community with a continuous habitation from FN to MM IIB. Sherds from later periods include pieces from LM III and R Imperial times, but they are too few to suggest anything other than a casual presence. The main period of the cave's use is EM III to MM II. In addition to the local production of ceramics, several class- es of imported pieces could be recognized. These imported sherds demonstrate that the Lasithi Plain was in close contact with other parts of Crete as early as EM I, and that a widespread trade in clay vessels was already in place at this early period.'

Didier Viviers (French School) reports on the 2001 sea- son: 'The EFA with the Institute of Mediterranean Studies (Rethymnon) and the 24th EPCA surveyed part of the territory of the ancient city, and finished the cartography and description of sites previously found. Some 30 extra areas of occupation were identified, bringing the number of documented sites to 120 in the immediate vicinity of the city centre. Each site has been mapped by the GPS and the numerisation of the 1:5000 geographical map of the Military Institute of Geography on an Auto CAD file has provided an efficient, adaptable cartographic tool. All points recorded by the GPS were transferred onto the digital map. Surface collection of sherds on known sites has provided a relatively precise chronology for most settlements. There were three major occupation phases: FN and EM settlements lay high up on rocky spurs without dense occupation and with associat- ed funerary monuments; Neopalatial (LM IA) settlements densely covered the whole area, especially the plains, with large ramshackle buildings every 300m or so, often surrounded by an enclosure wall; after a period of almost complete desertion the territory was resettled in the HL and R periods with buildings sometimes superimposed on M structures.

Geraldine C. Gesell (ASCS) reports on the 2001 study season: 'The emphasis was on coordination of the Vronda and Kastro teams in preparation for publication of both sites as well as the individual study of material. Work at Vronda concentrated on the final study of material from the LM IIIC settlement for publication. This included the inking and digitising of architectural and stratigraphic sections to accompany the previously completed plans of the site and individual buildings, as well as the completion of the catalogues of pottery and objects by deposit, room, and building for all the buildings on the site. Analysis of the animal bones (Lynn Snyder) continued for the whole settlement and by context. The discussion of the architecture, stratigraphy, and finds from indi- vidual buildings, along with a functional analysis of the rooms and buildings and a statistical analysis of the pottery, was com- pleted for buildings A/B, E, L/M, Q (Leslie Day), C (Nancy Klein) and J/K (Lee Ann Turner). The discussion of buildings D (Klein) and I-O-N (Kevin Glowacki) progressed. Of particular importance was the restudy of buildings J and K to re-evaluate the extent to which these had been disturbed by the later graves, which were particularly thick in the area. Specialist studies con- tinued off site; the analysis of the botanical remains (Kimberly, Flint-Hamilton) is nearly finished, and an appendix of the mag- netic studies of the kiln has been submitted by M.E. Evans. The radiocarbon dating of carbon samples has been completed. Once the individual units have been fully analysed, it will be possible for other specialists to complete their analyses of the stone tools (Heidi Dierckx), figurines (Geraldine Gesell), archi- tecture (Klein), and pottery (Day). A completed text on the LM IIIC Settlement is expected in 2002. The work on the material from the LM IIIC shrine at Vronda continued as well (Gesell). All the drawings of the cult materi- al (including the figurines from other buildings) have now been checked. Some corrections were made during the 2001 season and final inking and scanning will be completed during the win- ter. Fragments that could not be identified as going with the numbered goddesses and snake tubes were studied again last summer and final write-ups of these have been completed.

The presence of ample roof-tiles suggests that the dromos had a tiled roof supported by wooden beams. The bur- ial chamber bore badly-preserved traces of a red plaster surface. Three rock-cut cavities along the burial chamber's walls and a series of iron nails attached to the plastered wall and ceiling suggest religious activities. The small amounts of bg pottery date the tomb to the HL period. (ADelt 652-3) Dr James Whitley (BSA) reports on the sixth study season in 2001: 'Work concentrated on tracts surveyed in 1994 and 1998 around the ancient city itself. The reference collection of A to HL sherds established in the 1999 and 2000 study seasons was used to date the finds. The majority of the finds were of A to HL date, with an overlay of Venetian and Turkish pottery in the S tracts. Med settlement in this area seems to begin earlier than we had anticipated. The discovery of at least two 1 Ith-Ct sgraf- fito sherds pushes back the earliest confirmed date of the Med settlement of Praisos. Whether or not this occupation developed continuously from the R 'villa rustica' in this location (see below) cannot be confirmed, in view of our poor understanding of EByz and Arab pottery. The impression formed in the 1998 survey season, that the city did not extend very far down the E or N slopes of the first acropolis, was confirmed. Occupation seems to have been densest on the lower W slopes of the first and second acrop- oleis. Though relatively little material of IA date could be noted, relatively high levels of BA material appeared on the lower slopes. Rarely does this material resolve itself into concentra- tions we could call sites, and nowhere is it associated with any architecture. Much of this BA material appears to be substan- tially earlier than LM IIIC. More striking was the high number of R sherds from the same area as the later Venetian village. These consisted of R cooking wares, some terra sigillata and even some African red slipped. This is the only concentration of R finewares that has been encountered in the survey, and sug- gests that something like a 'villa rustica' was established on the S slopes of Praisos sometime in the 1st Ct AD. Whether or not this R occupation might merely have been the continuation of occupation from earlier times remains an 161. Vasilike Ierapetras, Kephala: building E open question. In the last report (AR 2000-01, 138-9) we noted that our survey had found nothing to contradict the traditional view that Praisos, which, as Strabo recounts, 'the Hierapytnians destroyed', ceased to be occupied after ca 140 BC. But the find of at least one flaring rim bowl, together with some other mate- rial of LHL date, may force us to revise this view.' Schisma Eloundas. V. Zographaki reports on the excavation of two robbed pit graves containing badly-preserved human bones and amphora fragments (Agapoulaki plot). Four robbed graves contained finds such as a fragmentary glass vessel, gold foil and bronze coin (Alykes, Petrakis plot). Th. Iliopoulos reports on the cleaning operation on the peak of a low hill at the Pirgos Pinon site, previously identified by Van Effenterre. A large (9.80 x 7.30m) building is dated by the associated pottery to the 3rd Ct BC. Several of the interior and exterior blocks of this building bore inscriptions dating also to the 3rd Ct BC. SW of this building, a horos was found carved on bedrock bearing the following inscription YTAAIA EK HOAIOS AAFIII; a graffito shows a female figure hunting with a bow an agrimi; above the woman's head is preserved:APTEMIA.

In 'sector B' a paved room, equipped with a stone bench and a small bothros was found associated with domestic pottery (loom-weights and many amphora fragments). Among the most interesting rooms in terms of finds was room B 13 which produced much domes- tic pottery including cooking pots, lekanai, oinochoai, a crater, pithoi, loomweights, bronze and iron nails. (ADelt 651-2) Vasilike Ierapetras. Th. Iliopoulos reports on continued exca- vation at the important LM IIIC settlement at Kephala (see AR 1999-2000, 146 with references). Excavation concentrated on building E, which contributes to our knowledge of LM IIIC-PG sanctuaries. The building consists of eight rooms (Fig. 161) divided into three wings. The main wing consists of rooms related to the organization of cult practices; room E6 had two column-bases posi- tioned on either side of a clay-plastered hearth; a cir- cular construction, possibly a bothros, was found in the NW comer of the room. E7 was a small room containing tripod cooking pots and small pithoi. The N wing was probably the area devoted to ritual: room E3 had a low bench surrounding its walls whereas a low altar resembles the LM IIIC 'altar' in the sanctuary at Kea. Statues of goddesses with raised hands, small vessels and a mass of pebbles were found in E4 (5x4m). (ADelt 653-4) Viglia Ierapetras. B.

Barbara Hayden (ASCS) reports on the 2001 Vrokastro Pottery Study: 'The purpose of this study was to reexamine pottery system- atically collected from sites of LM IIIC to 7th-Ct date in the N half of the Vrokastro survey area, now in storage at the INSTAP research facility in E Crete, in order to prepare a synopsis or description of pottery from these periods, which will be includ- ed in an article that is being written on the LM IIIC-LG settle- ment within the Vrokastro area. A catalogue of pottery shapes may not be included in the LM IIIC-EIA article, since a repre- sentative number of these shapes, especially from Vrokastro, will be included in volumes 1 and 2 of the Vrokastro reports. However, fabrics can be described, with other data concerning percentages of wares (coarse to fine) and shapes recovered. The Vrokastro pottery, which was collected along transects that extended from N to S over the peak, was strewn and exam- ined in September 2001. From this assemblage a study collec- tion of Vrokastro pottery was selected which was divided into coarse wares, that is, cooking and storage shapes; medium- coarse wares-this included cooking, storage, and a few other shapes, such as large bowls, lekanes, pitchers, and kalathoi; and fine wares, including cups, bowls, small jars, pitchers, kalathoi, stirrup jars, and kylikes. These basic ware groups were also subdivided by chronolo- gy, into LM IIIC, PR, and G subgroups. These in turn were sep- arated, where possible, by dominant inclusion into four basic groups: quartz/feldspar; limestone; phyllite; or granodiorite. This last subdivision, by dominant inclusion, was not always possible for the medium-coarse and fine-ware groups, since inclusions were often mixed or not visible. Sherds in the Vrokastro survey collection were described, measured, and Munselled, and some sherds were drawn. The Vrokastro group was then used for comparative purposes as pottery of LM IIIC-G date, collected from other sites in the region, was examined. This was just the second opportunity afforded since the survey pottery was collected to strew by chronological period (the first attempt to do this was with the FN-EM IIA material for the Hayden/Strasser article). The sample from Vrokastro, which consists of two boxes in the study collection, is 15-20% LM IIIC and approximately 15% PG. The PG period is recognizable primarily in small stemmed cups with everted rims and raised conical bases of larger vessels, and occasionally in a fine to medium-coarse jar body sherd with a PG motif. It is quite probable that more PG body sherds within the collection were not recognized. This sample collection taken from transects walked from N to S over the Vrokastro summit is evidence, therefore, of PG occupation on the summit and N slope of the mountain. The remaining per- centage, at least 60%, appears to date to the G period, and pri- marily late in that period. Within this last group, however, some few sherds could be as early as PGB. In terms of the LM III coarse wares, some of the cooking ware, with bright orange clay, no surface, not particularly hard- fired, and containing primarily large quartz/feldspar inclusions, is also found at Neopalatial sites within the survey area. This fabric may therefore continue from MM III to LM III. Primarily, however, LM III Vrokastro cooking fabrics consist of a red to red-brown clay with large white inclusions (quartz/feldspar), and where surface is preserved, it consists of a thick red slip. Tripod legs are round, sometimes deeply incised, with finger or thumb impressions at the base. Sometimes the core reveals that an extra layer of clay has been wrapped around the leg, perhaps during attachment. This clay wall forms the edge of the deep cleft, or incision, on the front of the leg. Cooking pot rims can be everted, or rounded above a convex, inturing wall; the latter continues a LM I-III local shape. The dominant inclusions in the local cooking fabrics are quartz/feldspar, limestone or calcareous, mica, granodiorite, with occasional chert. Some of the legless cooking pots are in a fabric that resembles the earlier Mirabello cooking fabric, but this later fabric is harder-fired, with a better-preserved surface. This is testament to how long this fabric tradition continues in the Vrokastro area. Indeed, the manufacture of granodiorite- tempered jars continues well into the Gr period within this area. In the coarse-ware group, about one third of the cooking wares are phyllite-tempered. This hard inclusion is not part of the local geology; thus some shapes must have been imported or brought to the site by families moving into the area. These shapes are probably imports from farther east, possibly from sites beyond the Isthmus of Hierapetra. Two thirds of the LM IIIC storage wares again contain quartz/feldspar, granodiorite, and plant temper; one third con- tains phyllite as the main temper, and rare fabrics contain some granodiorite and phyllite (these from the Gournia area?). Thick slip preserved on these granodiorite-tempered sherds is pink to tan, cream, or yellow colored and always impressed with bits of plant temper. This fabric type probably continues into PG, and a related, later fabric type can be seen in pithoi and jars of the Gr period from the Meseleroi (Oleros) area (these manufactured to the 5th Ct or later). There may be a tendency for this or a sim- ilar fabric to be harder-fired in periods after LM IIIC; this equates to a heavier, denser fabric with an orange to red core and less visible plant temper. The slipped surface, where pre- served, is identical to earlier examples. The LM IIIC medium-coarse jar wares consist of a white to yellow clay tempered primarily with quartz, and sometimes with granodiorite and mica. The LM IIIC fine ware can probably be dated early and late in this period, based on kylix shapes. Little change in these IIIC fine fabrics could be identified or described from sherds collected from the surface, but IIIC: late may be represented by coarser, harder-fired fabrics in this group. In the coarse-ware category, Vrokastro PG and G pithoid jars are more extensively tempered with quartz and limestone, and there appears to be a higher proportion of jars with phyllite or quartz/phyllite temper. Since it is difficult to distinguish undec- orated PG from G in jar body sherds, proportions of fabric types cannot be assessed without stratified material. One fabric is a hard-fired gritty orange with quartz, mica, limestone, and a few pieces of phyllite, and another pink to red/orange fabric is densely tempered with brown-red phyllite Phyllite tempers are also evident in the medium-coarse group, especially in the everted rims of fairly thin-walled cooking-ware jars that must belong to the PG or G periods. During these later periods, cook- ing wares in the study collection appear to be primarily tem- pered with phyllite and quartz, which again suggests an exter- nal origin. LM IIIC/PG jar or hydria sherds with motifs that establish their chronology are tempered with quartz, limestone, and occasionally with some gold mica and granodiorite. These frequently have buff to pink slipped surfaces and pink cores, in a high-quality local fabric. This fabric can also be seen in the larger open shapes, kraters and kalathoi. A finer version of this same fabric is evident in footed bowls, possible askoi, small kraters, and tiny cups of PG date. The paint is often brown to black, worn to washy. Phyllites continue to be seen in the fabrics of the hard-fired G jars of the coarse-ware category, but many very hard-fired jars and pitchers of G date in the medium-coarse division are very pure for their size, and the most visible inclusion is calcareous (limestone). These sherds often have a bright yellow deposit on a hard tan clay surface; this may be residue from soil or paint, and it is common on the LG medium-coarse body sherds.</page><page sequence="114">114 DAVID BLACKMAN The fine wares in this late group are coarser and heavier than in the preceding period. The dominant inclusion is calcareous. Skyphoi or bowls are dominant in the fine wares, along with cups and some of the smaller jars. One interesting facet of this study was the discovery of a few bits of FN -EM I pottery from Vrokastro, including two sherds of 'hearthware' (defined by J. Moody), which is a claystone/mudstone fabric in the phyllite range. This is one of the earliest fabrics from within the Vrokastro area. This fits with the discovery of a greenstone celt in the lower settlement area by Hall in 1912, and other early sites on the mid to upper range of Kopranes (KP6, KP10, etc.). This material (ca 10 sherds) comprises far less than 1% of total, but is still significant. Now that these periods can be recognized in the pottery record, it might be possible to return to the site and identify the area of earliest settlement or activity (this may be somewhere on the long N slope, where Hall found the celt, opposite Vouno or KP6, where another early site was identified). Other periods represented at the site include A, Gr, R, and Venetian-Ott. Shapes include jars or hydriae, and cups (R) and bg cups (C-EHL). The site of Vrokastro was therefore never truly abandoned, probably because it often functioned as a watch-station or citadel, in probable conjunction with other high sites along the Mirabello coast, from Vathi (Ioannimiti), on the W, to Phrouzi, near the Gouria plain. In terms of the other sites examined, results are as follows: Elias to Nisi (EN2), the fortified probable port of Vrokastro, produces pottery of LM I-IIIA/B date under the fortification wall, and sherds of EIA and later Gr date from within the set- tlement area above the cove of this promontory. Pottery from below the wall is well-preserved, with several shapes represent- ed. Sherds from the surface were identified primarily on fabrics, as few shapes survive. The pithos fragments belong to the LM IIIC-G periods, and have precise parallels in fabric and decora- tion to sherds from Vrokastro. Many are probably LM IIIC on fabric and firing. This very damaged site appears to continue from LM III to the Gr period. Farther W, the Xivouni site (KK2) on the summit of the highest hill in the S extent of the Istron or Kalo Chorio Valley is exclusively late LM IIIC, and may be a fairly good parallel for such sites as Khalasmenos and the recently excavated LM III settlement at Vasilike. The few sherds that were tentatively identified as G from this settlement on second examination appear by fabric to be IIIC; thus there is no evidence for later activity. A small bull figurine recovered in a LM IIIC fabric suggests the presence of a shrine. Phanourios 3: this has been described as the possible lower settlement of Vrokastro, on a long N-facing slope below the Vrokastro summit, directly E. The Chavga ravine separates the summit of Vrokastro from this area. Sherds appear to be over- whelmingly LM I-III, with some PG and G present. The A peri- od is also a major phase at this site, more important than the pre- ceding PG-G periods. Therefore nucleation at Vrokastro also affected this settle- ment, at least during PG-G. The lack ofLM IIIC (early-middle) tombs near Vrokastro may be due to the fact that the population continued to bury their dead, at least during this period, near this lower site in Phanourios and at VK5, a LM III settlement W of Vrokastro (see below). The Phanourios site also contains a large cyclopean E-W wall with other contiguous walls extending above and below it. Previous descriptions of the site included this structure as a pos- sible farmstead of Neopalatial date, with evidence for extensive reoccupation and later activity. This accords with other similar- ly constructed buildings in eastern Crete. Other massive walls on the same Phanourios slope function as terraces. Recent bull- dozing below one of these massive terraces has revealed a smaller wall of BA date. Thus it is conceivable that the large walls, terraces or structural, may actually belong to the impor- tant A phase of settlement here. DL1, or Duo Lagadia, south of the spring at Kavousanos, 1.5km S of the Vrokastro summit. The assemblage from this site parallels the main periods represented at Phanourios 3: LM I-IIIC, A. There may also be PG-G. Most of this is represented by cooking and storage fabrics; this is a small rural settlement. VK5 is in Mazikhortia, W of Vrokastro. It is on an exten- sion of the Karakovilia ridge that tops Kopranes, just E of the Pesa pass. This small bulldozed settlement on the strategic ridge top may actually extend to the S, beyond the ridge, and to the E, where MM III pottery was found (this at VK3). Pottery is pri- marily LM IIIA-C, with some LM I. The site does not contin- ue into PG. VK3 produces orange cooking ware with large quartz that is MM III/LM I; this site overlaps the eastern edge of nearby VK5. Other profiles, amphoriskoi, skyphoi, are PG-G. The large house here, with ground stone tools, is probably G. KM2: close to the eastern edge of the survey area, Kendromouri 2 is a ridge-top site flanking a feeder channel of the Xeropotamos River. This site contains many PR and histor- ical phases, with one round slashed tripod leg identified in a phyllite and quartz fabric that is LM IIIC-PG. There are two large sacks of coarse and medium-coarse body sherds that are early Gr, and fabrics indicate that some of these might be as early as LG. There is no evidence from identifiable shapes, however, that the settlement includes the G period. This site may have been abandoned in LM IIIC/EPG, and there are also no recognizable PG shapes with the exception of the tripod leg in a distinctive IIIC/PG fabric. Although the evidence is not altogether clear, it would appear possible that the Kendromouri area was abandoned after LM IIIC/EPG, and not reoccupied until the 7th or 6th Cts BC. Phyllite fabrics from this location look to the Isthmus and E Crete, and are outside the local gran- odiorite tradition, which extends locally from Phanourios to the Lato area. These descriptions of Vrokastro pottery, and pottery from contemporary sites, will be incorporated into an article con- cerning the settlement history of the Vrokastro area from LM IIIC-EIA. The time-frame for completion is within the next year. The article may be sent to Hesperia.' Minoan Roads Research Programme. S.
