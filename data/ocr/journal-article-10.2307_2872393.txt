<plain_text><page sequence="1">REVIEW ARTICLE MAGNIFYING WORDSWORTH * BY ROBERT LANGBAUM Matthew Arnold begins his essay on Wordsworth by telling his readers how low Wordsworth's reputation has fallen by 1879. He then goes on to rank Wordsworth after Shakespeare and Milton among English poets, and after Shakespeare, Moliere, Milton and Goethe among European poets of the last three cen- turies. As Arnold makes it, the claim seems extravagant just because he refuses to take seriously The Prelude or any of Words- worth's sustained efforts; he has reservations even about the "Immortality Ode." Arnold bases his high claim for Wordsworth upon a handful of scattered lyrics. Wordsworth's reputation was to fall still lower before it started upward again. But the revival of Wordsworth-which may be said to have started (this is one of literary history's few good jokes) with the discovery in 1921 that he had an illegitimate daughter-has been largely a process of substantiating Arnold's high claim. With Geoffrey Hartman's Wordsworth's Poetry 1787-1814, the process would seem to have been completed. For Mr. Hartman shows conclusively why Wordsworth-considered for so long to be, on the one hand, the rather simple-minded celebrator of simple country pleasures and, on the other, a stuffy moralizer-can be classed with the greatest poets. It is significant that Mr. Hartman's interest is mainly in The Prelude and in the long though not always successful poems that lead up to and away from The Prelude. The most memorable parts of the book are his' discussions of " Salisbury Plain," " The Ruined Cottage," a series of blank-verse fragments of the Alfoxden period first pub- lished in 1949, and such little esteemed later works as The Excur- sion and The Wfhite Doe of Rylstone. There emerges a pattern of development into which the lyrics are fitted (some of the most * Geoffrey H. Hartman, Wordsworth's Poetry 1787-1814, Yale University Press, 1964. Pp. xii + 418. Robert Langbaum 271</page><page sequence="2">famous are treated perfunctorily because, I suppose, they have already been 'done'). The result is a Wordsworth who is great, not merely because he hit it off to perfection in a dozen or so short poems and passages, but because of his powerfully con- sistent vision of life. It is too bad Mr. Hartman slights Arnold; for if we gather all Arnold has said on Wordsworth, we see that he has formulated the paradox central to Mr. Hartman's book. Arnold sees that Wordsworth, who is not learned like Milton nor an 'intellectual' like Goethe, nevertheless projects in his poetry a great power of intellect. That is what Arnold means when he says; in his essay that Wordsworth is superior to other poets, because " he deals with more of life than they do; he deals with life, as a whole, more powerfully." That is what he means when he goes on to dis- tinguish Wordsworth's moral vision from his philosophy: " His poetry is the reality, his philosophy . . . is illusion. Perhaps we shall one day learn to make this' proposition general, and to say: Poetry is the reality, philosophy the illusion." This statement has given rise to a modern line on Wordsworth-a line running from Leavis through Donald Davie to Herbert Lindenberger's recent book on The Prelude-which shows through an analysis of Wordsworth's language how he gives us poetry through a pre- text of giving us thought. It is a statement in which Arnold comes close to Blake in seeing that poetry is a mode of thought at once more precise and fundamental than that of discursive reason. Now Mr. Hartman's main achievement is that he expands enormously for us the dimensions of Wordsworth's imagination. He makes us realize that Wordsworth's vision of life. is on a scale with Milton's and would require, were. it to be projected like Milton's through a metaphor of spatial extension, a whole cosmos reaching from heaven to hell. He does for Wordsworth, in other words, what Arnold does; though he makes an advance on Arnold, especially since he emphasizes the " horrific " aspects of Words- worth's imagination, the hellish reaches. Arnold dwells on the genial or healing aspects, and Mr. Hartman slights him for that reason. But surely Arnold said the more obvious; things, the things that had to be said before, Mr. Hartman could get on to his point. Arnold, who in " Memorial Verses " sees Wordsworth as a distinctively modern poet, is mainly interested in Words- worth's use of imagination as an antidote to the modern habit 272 Magnifying Wordsworth</page><page sequence="3">of analysis: Wordsworth restores us through primitive modes of thought and feeling to a connection with nature. Mr. Haxtman, however, is interested in Wordsworth's conflict with imagination itself-in his; fear of imagination as an apocalyptic force that threatens to overwhelm the external world, to destroy it as a counterpart to imagination. Mr. Hartman sees Wordsworth's career as an attempt to domesticate imagination, to bring it into harmony first with nature and then with human nature. Apocalyptic, a crucial word in this book, brings up Blake. Blake's recent explosion into prominence has caused certain younger critics to try to assimilate the other romantic poets to Blake-to ask about them questions that rise out of Blake, to try to appreciate the others for the reasons we, appreciate Blake. This is Mr. Hartman's, method with Wordsworth. The method has its dangers, since it is always dangerous to try to turn one poet into another. But on the whole it has been beneficial, it has added rigor to our inquiries. For since Blake schematized the romantic view of the world he helps us understand the coherence of that view, the sense in which romantic poetry is intellectual and not merely ecstatic. According to the received idea, Wordsworth and Blake are antithetical in that Wordsworth thought imagination perceives what is really out there in nature, whereas Blake thought every- thing comes from imagination. Mr. Hartman's correction of the received idea is in effect a book-length commentary on the note Blake wrote in his copy of Wordsworth's Poems of 1815. "' Nat- ural Objects, always did &amp; and now do weaken, deaden &amp; obliterate Imagination in Me. Wordsworth must know that what he writes Valuable is Not to be found in Nature." In 1804, Mr. Hartman tells us, Wordsworth finally discovered "the autonomy of his imagination, its independence from present joy, from strong outward stimuli " (p. 41). He discovered it in the act of writing in Prelude, Book VI, about the time in 1790 when, in crossing the Alps at the Simplon Pass, he and a friend were beset by an unaccountable melancholy at the realization that their path no longer led upward. The various features of the ravine into which they descended took on an eschatological quality: like workings of one mind, the features Of the same face, blossoms upon one tree; Characters of the great Apocalypse, The types and symbols of Eternity. (11. 636-39) Robert Langbaum 273</page><page sequence="4">Wordsworth injects into the midst of the past episode his' present understanding of what happened-that imagination, like a vapor whose source is unknown, has assimilated the scene to its own patterns, and that revelations of greatness come in just such moments Of usurpation, when the light of sense Goes out, but with a flash that has revealed The invisible world. (11. 600-02) Both Wordsworth and Mr. Hartman beg the question as to whether the friend shares in this experience that comes, from Wordsworth's imagination. While Mr. Hartman makes much of this episode, he is not tell- ing us that Wordsworth is an apocalyptic poet. He goes on in several places to qualify. Nature " leads to a discovery of the Imagination as a power separate from Nature," but Wordsworth becomes aware at the same time of " nature's role in this process " of self-discovery; so " even though nature's hold on the senses weakens, he cannot but trust and continue to go out. In this way the soul maintains what Wordsworth later calls its 'excursive power,' and avoids a solipsism inherent in the discovery of its independence from nature " (p. 114). Readers may miss this qualification because the book's very richness' obscures the argument. The virtue of this: book is that it continually complicates our ideas, but it lacks the virtue the scientists call 'elegance '-the virtue of simplifying complexities. Although Mr. Hartman's writing is, lucid, often felicitous in ex- presision, and imbued with moral passion, he does not offer us the grand simplifications, that make for easy reading. Yet the style, just because we have to work at it, makes us' experience the spiritual importance of its subject; so that Wordsworth seems quite up to the frequent comparisons of his poetry to passages from the Bible. (I did, however, find far-fetched and distracting the introduction of the Hebrew term akedah, referring to the binding of Isaac, to denote the binding of imagination to nature; there must be a simpler way to say this, closer to Wordsworth's own tone.) Actually, Mr. Hartman is making the standard point about Wordsworth, that he had always to start from and come back to earth; but he reorganizes our understanding of the dialectics; in- volved in the process. Apocalypse, we are told, is the thing 274 Magnifying Wordsworth</page><page sequence="5">Wordsworth resisted. Whereas the received idea is that Words- worth feared the drying up of imagination, the thing he feared, we are told, is that nature would not be adequate to imagination, that he would not be able to find in nature his Idea of Nature. In the Mt. Snowdon episode in Prelude, Book XIV, " the poet comes face to face with his Imagination yet calls it Nature. It is the Prelude's supreme instance of the avoidance of apocalypse" (p. 226). I am not sure that is the way to put it. When Wordsworth says of the epiphany on Mt. Snowdon: " There I beheld the emblem of a mind/ That feeds upon infinity" (II. 70-71), he shows perfect awareness that at such moments the distinction between inner and outer is dissolved. Wordsworth does not avoid apocalypse; he achieves that " blending " of inner and outer which is, as Mr. Hartman tells us elsewhere, the glory of his' mature style. The answer to the question so labored throughout this book-the question whether Wordsworth's perceptions come from without or within-is, as Mr. Hartman knows, very simple. They come from both directions. Wordsworth answers thei question in the closing lines of Book XIII, where he speaks of maintaining A balance, an ennobling interchange Of action from without and from within; The excellence, pure function, and best power Both of the objects seen, and the eye that sees. (11. 375-78) But to settle the matter so simply at the outset would be to miss Wordsworth's awesome struggle to achieve such balance and therefore the awesomeness and range of an imaginative encounter with reality on a scale with Milton's. In the main point of his book, Mr. Hartman gives us back the Wordsworth we already know but magnified many times. He makes his novel contributions in certain secondary points. His main thesis requires a new understanding of Wordsworth's development as not a change of direction but the accomplishment of his original purpose-to bind imagination to earth by natu- ralizing and then humanizing it. "If nature is not enough to bind the soul, then reason and duty must be added, and if these are not enough, then the restraining bonds of religion are appealed to. . . . The question that remains is whether the humanized imagination is really still imagination " (p. 9288). The question that remains-it is a question Mr. Hartman does not try to Robert Langbaum 275</page><page sequence="6">answer-is whether Wordsworth was pleased with his accom- plishment, whether he realized he had sacrificed to it the power to write great poetry. Mr. Hartman's most original contribution-it is the best thing in the book-lies in his brillant analyses of Wordsworth's sense of place. Starting with a kind of poem that takes off from inscrip- tions and epitaphs-a poem like (the full title is significant) "Lines left upon a Seat in a Yew-tree, which stands near the Lake of Esthwaite, on a desolate Part of the Shore, commanding a beautiful Prospect" (1795) -he descries a pattern in which the Poet or Traveller halts at a commemorated spot and recalls a narrative of the past that returns us to the present spot explain- ing the commemoration. This is the pattern of " There Was a Boy " and the Lucy poems, where the dead boy and the dead girl are memorialized in the landscape. (Because I agree with Mr. Hartman that the Lucy poems are evocations of the spirit of English place, I disagree with his statement: "It is through Lucy's death that Wordsworth learns that nature does betray the heart which loves her" [p. 161]. Lucy's death is absorbed into the poet's love of the landscape into which she passes; Words- worth had not in 1799 reached the stage of " Elegiac Stanzas," 1805.) The pattern is to be found in the thorn and the' heap of stones with which " The Thorn " and " Michael " begin. It is to be found in " Tintern Abbey," where past and present, the move- ment of the poet's whole life, are collapsed, externalized and fixed in the landscape. When Mr. Hartman speaks of the " spot syndrome" in Words- worth, he means that Wordsworth perceives his thoughts through the imagery of localized place, that his imagination is manifested through the intensification of a spot rather than through the imagery of spatial magnitude that we find in Paradise Lost. He connects the syndrome (I wish he had not used a word denoting disease) with the omphalos feeling of archaic religions, their ap- prehension of deity as genii loci. He reminds us that God in the Old Testament manifests Himself through the sanctification of particular places. Wordsworth's phrase " spots of time" ' is shown to be nicely ambiguous, with spots meaning not only portions but places; so that one steps out of time just because time has been turned into place. The implications are wider even than Mr. Hartman sees. Yeats, in a little essay called " Holy Places " in Discoveries, speaks of 276 Magnifying Wordsworth</page><page sequence="7">the peasant of old Ireland or Greece who, working in a thoroughly mythologized landscape, felt " himself near sacred presences: when he turned his plough from the slope of Cruachmaa or of Olympus." If we recall Basil Willey's remark in The Seventeenth Century Background that Wordsworth found himself alone in a demytho- logized post-Lockean world, then we can see Wordsworth as start- ing over again from the beginning to repeat the history of civiliza- tion. Wordsworth builds his own soul in the' way primitives do, by recognizing it outside himself in nature; at the same time, through memorializing these recognitions in the landscape, he civilizes nature by creating in it spots or places-i. e., spatially projected fixations of psyche. Yet Wordsworth differs from Blake and Yeats in that he does not cut his perceptions off from the eyes that beheld them, he does not solidify them into) myths. As Mr. Hartman so finely shows, Wordsworth resists. excessive anthropomorphism, the limiting of spirit to any one image of it; and in this his imagination seems quintessentially Hebraic. After such implications, I was surprised by Mr. Hartman's conclusion in his last sentence that Wordsworth " is the most isolated figure [isolated from tradition] among the great English poets" (p. 838). I had been thinking the book was showing just the opposite-showing that Wordsworth was, in his connec- tion with archaic religion and the imagination of the Old Testa- ment in touch with a tradition so old that its; limits were hardly discernible. I had been thinking, as I read the brilliant compari- sons of The Prelude to Paradise Lost and The Excursion to Para- dise Regained, that if Milton had lived in the early nineteenth century he would have been Wordsworth. Mr. Hartman does not see all the implications of his own argument because he does not give sufficient emphasis to the distinctively modern element in Wordsworth. He speaks of Wordsworth's " failure" to write an epic in the manner of Spenser and Milton. I would call it his triumph, a sign that he was in his instincts at least so genuinely traditional as to understand that the nineteenth-century equiva- lent of Paradise Lost was precisely an autobiographical poem about psychological development. Keats saw all this when he said in his letter to Reynolds, May 3, 1818, that Milton " did not think into the human heart, as Wordsworth has done," and that he was therefore less complex than Wordsworth-not because Wordsworth had the better mind but because he had profited by the general " march of intellect." Robert Langbaum 277</page><page sequence="8">I raise such questions to show how far-ranging are the issues in this book, and the kind of speculation one is led to on encounter- ing a mind so deeply meditative as Mr. Hartman's. Space does not permit me to speak about the specific pages packed with stunning insights, or the illuminating incidental analyses of Milton, King Lear, Henry James. Mr. Hartman provides for each chapter a descriptive bibliography that is itself worth the price of admission. Wordsworth's Poetry is one of the major works of scholarly criticism of our time. It is a book we shall be rereading, citing and, yes, quarreling with a little, too, for many years to come. University of Virginia 278 Magnifying Wordsworth</page></plain_text>
