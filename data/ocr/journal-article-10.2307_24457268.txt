<plain_text><page sequence="1">WOLFHART PANNENBERG THE GOD OF HOPE I s theism dead? In reviewing the criticism of the traditional conception of God as summum ens and transcendent person, it is certainly time to take up the question about the scope of this criticism. Since Spinoza and Fichte, its jumping-off point has been the idea that the conception of a transcendent person necessarily includes the finiteness of human per sonality with the result that the thought of an infinite person becomes an absurdity. Since the word "God" implies individual personhood, con ceptions of God in general were shown by Fichte's criticism to be the product of misunderstanding. Fichte's later teaching about the Abso lute Ego could not repair this damage. His arguments in the dispute about atheism prepared the ground for Feuerbach's theory of projection. To be sure, Feuerbach elevated man—even as generic being—to endless ness so that all that was left over for God was the shell of the conception of person which had already been unmasked as anthropomorphic by Fichte. We do not need here to go into Feuerbach's explanation of the reasons for mankind's fixed idea of making one's own infinite being into an alien being and transferring it into an imaginary heaven. It is enough to recognize that—first—the finiteness and the anthropomorphic character of fundamental predicates of God and—second—their very derivation from man and nature became the levers which overturned the traditional picture of God in the public estimation. In our times, the consequences of this criticism have penetrated into Christian theology itself. Here, besides the conception of the personality of God, the concern is above all about the idea of a transcendent being at all: theism is said to have conceived of God as a being beside other being and thereby made God finite. This argument by Tillich also goes back to Fichte who rejected the conception of a special divine "substance" as being a reminiscence of the mode of being of finite things. The thought of a God "an sich" as a separate thing is considered taboo today for theological reasons as well because it degrades God to a finite, "available" object next to other objects. Every objectivation of God into a being (Seiendes) falls short of the biblical idea of an Almighty God as the reality which determines everything. As Bultmann says: No subject would be able to escape it by means of an objectivating dissociation (objektivierende Distanzierung). This article was first published in the Bloch Festschrift, in Ernst Bloch zu ehren (Frankfurt: Suhrkamp, 1965) pp. 209-225.</page><page sequence="2">In its conclusion, this theological argumentation oriented toward the inviolable sovereignty of God encounters the atheism of freedom which arises for the opposite reasons and which, following Nietzsche, is repre sented today by N. Hartmann, J. P. Sartre, and E. Bloch and which, for the sake of human freedom, excludes the existence of a being (Seiendes) endowed with omnipotence. The result in both instances is the con demnation of the adherence to God as the highest being. The only dif erence is that one group completely dismisses every statement about God while the other, the theologians, tries to find new possibilities for talking about God. First of all, it certainly hits the finite and anthropomorphic character of the conceptions of God. The traditional theological and philosophical doctrines about God have for the most part been completely aware of the inescapable inadequacy of every human assertion about God. There fore, by using the tools of the metaphysical doctrines about God, Tillich can turn against the theistic conception of God: God is not a being and, therefore, also not an isolated individual, not a person, but Being (Sein) itself, the source and power of all being (Seiendes) and individuality. To ask about God's existence means not to recognize that God is the union above the antithesis erf essence and existence. By such formulations, Til lich shows himself to be the advocate of the metaphysical tradition in that he is against the theism that hasi arisen out of it. It is a strange misunderstanding that the Anglican Bishop Robinson thought that pre cisely in the instance of Tillich he had found a radical break with the traditional understanding of God in general. But, if God is no longer to be thought of under any circumstances whatsoever as an independent being (Seiendes) it certainly becomes very dubious what there is that remains of this traditional understanding of God. Does the subject not fall together with the predicates, as Feuerbach observed? The allusions to the fundament of being (Sein), to the hidden depth and power that penetrates all finite reality or especially the realm of fellow humanity are, in the face of the aforementioned criticism, scarcely capable of justi fying by themselves (the continued use of the significant word "God". The Romantic philosophy of nature could readily attribute this depth and this breadth of the Infinite to nature itself; and the conversion of the infinite spirit into the infiniteness of nature probably belongs among the presuppositions of Fichte's criticism of religion. Indeed, it is not readily clear why this impersonal fiuidum of that depth must be ad dressed as God. To be sure, we can not longer transfigure finiteness it self—man's and the world's—through the aura of the infinite as casually as the Romantics and Feuerbach did. The experience of finiteness has since then become more radical. That is a disillusionment which quite probably cannot be brushed aside as a mere reflection of a condition of late bourgeois society. The depth of Being (Sein) is now more likely WOLFHART PANNENBIRG 285</page><page sequence="3">to appear as enigmatic and as absurd. It is no longer experienced as an enthusiastic expansion but as the painful limit of one's own existence (Dasein). But it is just as difficult to attach the word "God" to this dark abyss of an empty transcendence as to the power of life in the depth of reality. There ought to be reasons from another quarter to justify the reference of the sustaining depth and the absurd abyss of existence to God. Here it would be profitable to remember that the originally Greek philosophical elements of the traditional doctrine about God have often been of dubious value for the question of whether the ground of the world (Welt-Grund) has the individual being (Eigendasein) and the per sonal character of a God. In its conviction about the personal character of the ground of the world, the traditional doctrines about God prob ably have been influenced by the authority of the Bible to a greater ex tent than many of its fathers were aware. Can this doctrine resist even today the disintegration of the idea of God into the ether of a being (Sein) growing dim in the depth of being (in der Tiefe des Seienden)? Certainly not as the corpus of supranatural revealed truth into which the authority of the Bible has to a large extent solidified in Christian theology. It would depend on whether the Hebraic-protochristian under standing of God (to the extent that it, precisely in all of its modifications, proves to be a coherent totality with internal unity) has reference to the experience of reality Sn our times. It is meaningful to ask this question because a certain understanding of reality corresponds to the God of the Bible. By virtue of this understanding all Being (Seiendes) has been experienced as being dependent on the future, as being eschatological. As the God of promises and of historical guidance into a new future, as the God of the kingdom to come, he has molded the experiences of the world and of the condition of man. The futurizing of existential experience reached its highpoint with the appearance of Jesus. The con viction of the nearness of the Kingdom brought about such a concen tration upon the future of God that by comparison all things traditional and contemporary lost their individual significance while the future of God himself became the determining factor for the present. When it was rediscovered by Johannes Weiss and Albert Schweitzer, Jesus' eschato logical understanding of reality had such a shocking effect upon the feeling of satiety toward life in the early 20th century that people did not know how to deal with the impression made by the profound alien ness of this Jesus except by means of brash simplification and reinterpre tations. The reinterpretations have continued to date in the effort to rob the eschatology of Jesus of its sense of time and to transform his passion for the future of God into a present of eternity in the moment. Christian theology at some time will perhaps be indebted to Ernst Bloch's philosophy of hope if it again finds the courage to deal with its 286 CROSS CURRENTS: SUMMER 1968</page><page sequence="4">central category: the general concept of eschatology. Of crucial impor tance in this matter is the prospect toward a future which is to be under stood as temporal. Bloch has taught us to understand anew the over whelming significance of a future which is still open, and of the hope which anticipates this future, for the life and thought of mankind and moreover for the ontological peculiarity of all reality. He has regained the eschatological method of thinking of the biblical traditions as a theme for philosophical reflection and also for Christian theology. But what is the nature of the theological character of this eschatology? After Ernst Bloch, the "God-hypostasis" has become untenable. After having become progressively humanized on the messianic line of the history of religion it has been finally cancelled out in the homousia of Jesus Christ (PH 1493). "The glory of God became the apocalyptic glory of Christ and his congregation". (1500) The "religious heteronomy and its reified hypostasis disappear completely in the theology of the congre gation . . ." (1408) Accordingly, the atheistic criticism of religion by Feuerbach and his followers is supposed to have merely executed what was already foreseen in the appearance of Jesus and in the Christian gos pel in the form of human fulfilment and the nullification of the history of religion. One thing remains—a thing misunderstood by Feuerbach by virtue of his "plain" anthropology derived "from scarcely expanded hu man presence" (1412). But precisely this dispels the "fiction of God the Creator", for: "where the great Lord of the world is, there is no place for freedom, not even for the freedom—of the children of God, nor for the image of the kingdom, the image which existed in chiliastic hope as a mystical-democratic image." (1413) The "cavity left by the removal of the God-hypostasis" (1529), the "projection space" which has already been presupposed for the possi bility of making religious hypostases (1530), is, according to Bloch, not a "chimera", as were the figures of the gods with which the religious im agination peopled it. (1534) Without it, the kingdom as well would not be "intentionable" (1532), the Utopia of the kingdom is its true content (1530, cf. 1412f.). To this extent the hope for the kingdom transcends every particular but surpassable realization: the idea of the kingdom does not completely correspond to any kind of social Utopia (1410), and "even a society which has attained classlessness" would remain separated from the summum bonum of the religious Utopian kingdom through the leap which is posited by the intention to cause the leap from resur rection and transfiguration." (1411) But how is this hope for the king dom substantiated in its turn? Can it be sufficiently described on the basis of the present behavior of mankind which projects its wishes into the future? If this were done, wouldn't this be using the psychology of man as he already is as a criterion for the evaluation of the hope for the kingdom? It would probably be difficult to reconcile Bloch's appeal WOLFHART PANNENBERG 287</page><page sequence="5">to the potentialities and latencies of the process with his emphasis on the novum in the future. If the future were already latent in those po tentialities and latencies of the process—in our case, in the wishes and hopes of mankind—it would no longer descend upon everything that has been and that is present (Vorhandenes) with the suddenness and the incalculability of the new. But what if the hope for the kingdom were merely a symbolic expression of the spiritual aspirations of mankind to which one can point? Then the hope for the kingdom could apparently be done away with simply by satiating people and making them satisfied with themselves and the conditions of their present time. If the hope for the kingdom is substantiated only as an expression of human wishes, it could very easily lapse into the triviality of a self-satisfied present. The primacy of the future and of its novum is ensured only if the kingdom to come is founded ontologically in itself and only if it owes its futurum not merely to the presently existing wishes and aspirations of mankind. The ontological primacy of the future of the kingdom over all that is presently real and also all that is spiritually present is meant when the kingdom to come is described biblically as the kingdom of God. Biblical ly, the being (Sein) of God and the being of the kingdom are in fact identical, for the being of God is his reign. Only in the accomplishment of his reign is he God, and the accomplishment of his reign is defined as being future. To this extent the God of the hope for the kingdom is in a radical and exclusive sense characterized by "futurum as an ontological characteristic." (1458) We shall return to this later. It has been shown that the theme of the idea of God has by no means been conclusively and convincingly cleared up by Bloch inasmuch as, for his way of thinking, the question must be raised concerning how the ontological priority of the future kingdom over everything that is pres ent (Vorhandenes) at the present time is to be insured in face of present mankind and the hopes cherished by it. It appears that this unsolved problem in his Utopia of the kingdom has not gone unnoticed by Bloch. Thus, he is able to observe that the projection of the kingdom "used and uses even the sublimity of something external and supernal (eines Aussen und Ο ben)", and the reverence culminating in the humanum needs the "numinosum experienced through the magnitude of nature as a correc tive in order to preserve the religious substantiality of itself; that is, pre cisely, in order to think greatly and mysteriously enough about man." (1409) As far as the question of God is concerned, Bloch finds himself in a completely different situation from that of Feuerbach. The problem of the discrepancy between the wretchedness and the fragmentary nature of present human existence (Menschsein) and the magnificence of hu man destiny did not arise for Feuerbach because he was daring enough to endow the present human being itself (to be sure, not as an individual, but nonetheless as a species) with all of the predicates of the infinite. Of 288 CROSS CURRENTS: SUMMER 1988</page><page sequence="6">course, in the process he had to skip over the individual and his in sistent questions about the meaning of one's particular existence and fate. Feuerbach thereby lost sight of the real situation of each individual human present which is filled with the struggles and the often out rageous, continually endured destruction of individuals and which al lows no place for a human species which, untouched by the suffering of individuals, nonetheless is still supposed to be distinguished by every good quality imaginable. In contrast to Feuerbach, Bloch has gone through the experience of the finiteness of everything present (For handenes) and is not able to skip over the experience by means of a ficticious notion of species; instead, he is able to hope for fulfillment only from an unprecedented, overwhelming future. With this newly arisen distinction there also arises the question concerning the ontological pri macy of the future in relation to the present. Consequently, the theme arises anew of a divine Being (Sein) which is to be distinguished from present humanity and the world; "The problem of the significance of the legitimate mystery homo absconditus depends exclusively on refer ence to the Deus absconditus," (1406) The primacy of the future—and consequently the Deus absconditus which is the foundation of this pri macy—is necessary in order that the humanum remain protected from triviality and that it obey the summons of its future possibilities. To be sure, there now arises the question what the word "God" in this context still signifies. For there still remains the criticism of the traditional maimer of thinking of God as being (Seiendes) for itself be sides other being. A God thought of as a present ( Vorhanden) thing, as a personal thing, as a "reified hypostasis" is no longer credible. One may ask whether such a characterization does complete justice to the inten tion of the traditional philosophical-theological doctrines about God with their antipathetic movement which transcendentizes and reflects the inadequacy of its own statements. But, however this may be, an Ab solute thing in the mode of presentness is no longer thinkable. For, by definition, questions can be asked, and it is possible to proceed, beyond everything which is already existing or being. Thus, one must agree with Bloch for having temporalized the inquiry about the ens perfectissimum and for transforming this inquiry into the "supreme Utopian problem, the problem of the end." (1412) In this sense his atheism must be ac cepted. But in the inquiry about the end the question of God arises anew insofar as the end is supposed to be definitely thought of as a numinosum in itself. Of course, here it is now a question exclusively of the possibility of a God "with futurum as ontological characteristic", and to this extent the return to the God of theism is excluded as this stage. The future as a mode of being of God has still not been considered in theology, in spite of the close correlation of God and of the coming reign WOLFHART PANNENBERG 289</page><page sequence="7">of God in the eschatological message of Jesus. Is the future of the reign, of the kingdom of God, perhaps inessential to his divinity—a mere ac cidens? Isn't God God only in the accomplishment of the reign over the world? For this reason his divinity will not be revealed until the coming of the kingdom—only then will his glory be visible. But can the revela tion of his divinity and his divinity itself be detached from one another? The God of the Bible is God only when he reveals himself as God. He would not be the God of the world if he did not reveal himself as its master. But precisely this, according to the expectation of Israel and of the New Testament, is still a matter of the future. Doesn't this mean that God is not yet, but is yet to be? In any case, he is only in the man ner that the future has power over the present; the future decides what will become of that which is present at the present time. As the power of the future, God is not a thing, not a present (Vorhanden) object which man would be able to distance and beyond which he would be able to proceed. He appears neither as a Being (Seiendes) among other beings, nor as the motionless background of all being (ailes Seienden), as time less, subobjective Being (hintergegenstandlich.es Sein). Perhaps being (Sein) is in truth to be understood as the power of the future. As the power of the future, the God of the Bible has always been and is still beyond any statements made about him and he has already surpassed every conception of God. But above all, the power of the future does not rob man of his freedom to go beyond anything that is present. A being (Wesen) which is present (Vorhanden) and endowed with omnipotence would destroy such freedom by virtue of its excessive power. But the pe culiarity of the power of the future lies in its liberation of man from his connections with what is present for his future and for his freedom. The power of the future—and only it—can be an object of hope and trust; for the future has power over that which is temporally present and releases the forces which overcome it. Precisely for this reason it alone is capable of both saving and maintaining. Since the future has had power in the same way over the present (das Vorhandene) during every past time, everything which has come into being (das Gewordene) even of long past times has consequently come into being and has again been transformed anew by that same power of the future which decides about our present just as it is what has produced this present. The con sideration of the power of the future over the present leads consequently to a new idea of creation, an idea which is not oriented toward an event in the primordial past but is instead oriented toward the eschatological future. Ernst Bloch has thought it necessary to reject God the Creator in favor of the kingdom as the perfection which has not yet come into be ing (PH 1458, 1493, 1499f.), because he judged God the Creator to be an expression of an "opulent mythology of the past." (PH 1500) The strong influence of such prehistorical mythology on the manner of 290 CROSS CURRENTS: SUMMER 1968</page><page sequence="8">thought in the biblical creation texts is certainly not to be denied. But the God of the kingdom to come would have had to become the cause of an eschatological change in the idea of creation as soon as He—as happened in Jesus' message—had been recognized by virtue of the future of his reign—as the God having sole mastery over the temporally pres ent world and having the decision about the sense and essence (Wesen) of the world. In Jesus' message creation and eschatological future are extremely closely correlated. Before now, theology has of course not perceived the problem contained in the message because the theological doctrines about creation were caught in the spell of prehistorical think ing of mythical origin—in contrast to the eschatological character of the message and history of Jesus. The futurity of God does not exclude in every sense the idea of his eternity. For he is not only the future of today's present; he has also been the future of every past age as well—and, moreover, not in the inactive isolation of a remoteness retreating again and again in the face of historical process, but rather—in accordance with what has just been said—in such a way that he has imparted to every event and every age his direct historical future which, by virtue of its realization, ceased to be future. Thus, by virtue of the realization of the respective historical future, God has cast off this historical future from himself, who is the power of the ultimate future, and in this way has mediated himself into his own eschatological futurity. If God is to be thought of in this way as the future of even the most distant past, he, consequently, already was before our present and before every present, even though he will re veal his divinity conclusively only in the future of his own kingdom. He was as the future which has had power over every successive present. Thus, the futurity of God implies his eternity. However, there is a dif ference whether eternity is thought of as timelessness, or as the endless permanence of something existing since primordial time, or as the end less permanence resulting from the power of the future over every present. The most difficult question has remained untouched: to what extent did we have the right to call the power of the future, by virtue of which the kingdom to come has its ontological primacy over the wishes of mankind, "God"? Did this happen only in reminiscence of biblical us age, or can a justification for it be obtained out of the matter itself? As was emphasized before, the word "God" indeed includes inseparably in itself the thought of the personal. Is it more likely that the power of the future has a personal character than does the conception of a time less ground of being (Seinsgrund) in the depth of reality, in the sub stratum of being (Hinterground des Seienderi) ? And if this should be the case, can such a concept of divine person be defended against the charge made since Fichte that the concept of divine person represents an an WOLFHART PANNENBERG 291</page><page sequence="9">thropomorphic hypostasization? Both of these questions will determine whether we have been justified in our use of the word "God" up till now or whether we have used it surreptitiously. Both questions can be answered only if we succeed in obtaining a deeper insight into the pe culiarity of the personal. The decisive question is whether—as Fichte and Feuerbach presupposed—the idea of person is really derived from the human ego and is then transferred to the object of religious experi ence. Should this presupposition be sound, the criticism would remain unaffected and the idea of a personal God—and thus the idea of God altogether—would have to be abandoned on the grounds that it is a projection of an anthropomorphic hypostasis. But it is questionable whether that presupposition is correct. There is some evidence that the phenomenon of the personal was discovered not by reference to man at all, but that its origin lies in the religious experience, in the appear ance of the numen, and that from there it was transferred to man. This process would then already be the basis of its inversion, the anthropo morphic stylization of the gods. Besides evidence from the psychology of religion, the child's experience—which is of a primarily personal na ture—of his environment and the mysterious air which is not to be sep arated from the concept of human person indicate that this could be the case, i.e., that concept of person might not be a phenomenon of anthropomorphic origin. The concept of human person is even to this day closely connected with the complexus of religious themes and can be undervalued where this complexus disappears. The original phenom enon of the personal would perhaps then have to be sought in the im penetrability of the numinous power which does not remain at all vague, but which is encountered as a force having a concrete relationship to man. This phenomenon is connected with the holiness and the inviol ability of the numinous power. It emerges in the freedom of the power in relation to its phenomenal form. At the same time, the freedom of the power for this particular phenomenal form is therein implied. Thus, this is perhaps the circumstance which would permit man to be under stood personally during an age when the extent of the personal power of the other natural phenomena has diminished. If the concept of per son expresses itself in this manner in freedom, then freedom itself pre supposes openness toward the future. Man is free only because he has future and because he can go beyond what is present. In this way, free dom is actually the force which transforms the temporally present. But this means that futurity as a stipulation of freedom constitutes the core of the personal: it is futurity which "shines forth" through the tem porally present phenomenal form and which—as a threat or as entice ment—perplexes man. It is also futurity which gives importance to the temporally present phenomenal form as a pledge for the future. The power residing in mere latency is impersonal—but if so, it also loses its 292 CROSS CURRENTS: SUMMER 194·</page><page sequence="10">character of power and remains in any case the fundament of the world in the form of a powerless substratum phenomenon. For this reason, in contrast to the mere depth of reality in being (Sein), the power of the future has personal character, because it concerns every present in the possibilities of its change as its future. Having mastery over the pres ent, the future shines powerfully through the forms of the temporally present present. Thus, the future is also the power of being (Sein). Be ing itself (Sein) is to be thought of from the perspective of the future rather than as that which is abstractly most general in the substratum of being (Hintergrund des Seienden). In the history of religion, the power of the future has been repeatedly experienced as being dangerous (M. Eliade). This is understandable as long as the future is dark and uncertain and there is no cause to look forward with hope to the changes it will bring. In any case, the de votees of most religions have turned away from the future in order to find security in that which has supposedly existed since primordial times. For that reason, it was necessary to have a mediating history in order that the power of the future could be revealed as the God of hope and displace the idols and the prehistorical myths of the present. There was need of causes for hope, for definite hopes in the temporal present and in the historical inheritance of mankind. The biblical scriptures are documents of this path which led to the recognition of the God of Israel as the God of hope by means of the history of promises received by Israel. In these promises the future was proclaimed, at first still in the form of a near, historical goal—in the promises of a nation, a rich pos terity and the unshakeable permanence of the dynasty of David. But then the hope of the Israelites was redirected past the expectation of all these temporary blessings, beyond the fulfillment and loss of these bless ings, farther beyond to a final action of their God, an action which would bring all of history to fulfillment through justice, peace and eter nal life. This final hope for the kingdom, for the reign of God itself, arose out of the passing hopes, fulfillments and trials and out of the ex pectations which Israel had had on the path indicated by these hopes, fulfillments and trials. Without this mediation, the origin of the hope for the kingdom would have been unthinkable. In the hope for the kingdom, it was a question of the reign of the God whose will and pe culiarity Israel had experienced during its entire history. Only by vir tue of its origin from this history, does the hope for the kingdom to come have its definiteness as a hope for the reign of Jahweh. Nonethe less, the concentration of the hopes of Israel on that ultimate future was able in the message of Jesus to shift into a revision of the traditions of Israel itself in the light of the future of God and his reign. The trust in the coming of the reign of God is now sufficient to be bound up with salvation and it has no need of any further stipulations of traditional piety. The future of God—to be sure—the God of Israel—has thereby be WOLFHART FANNENBERG 293</page><page sequence="11">come the measure of all things, the standard also of the history of its own origin. In looking back, the proclamations of God in the Old Tes tament now show themselves to be mere advance indications and repre sentations of the future of God revealed and made accessible by the appearance of Jesus and the appearance of the eschatological glory in him by virtue of his reawakening from the dead. Correspondingly, upon the Israelite understanding of the form of existence of God a new light must also be cast, derived from the eschatological turn to the future of God which was accomplished in the appearance of Jesus. Israel's con ceptions of God, in spite of all their peculiarities, were still dominated by the ambient understanding of the mode of existence of divine be ings (Wesen) —as being primordial forces. The numinous manifestations about which the early Israelite traditions report, were not understood as being the appearance of the future, but, like a stone or tree, as ap pearances of otherwise hidden, but nonetheless temporally present real forces. Thus, there exists only an outward relationship even between the divine epiphany and the promise conveyed thereby. It appears that the promise was believed because of the author separate from it. But wasn't the promise (or threat) perhaps believed in reality because of the persuasive power of its content? Weren't the promises perhaps con tentually the advance appearance of the coming reign of God and con sequently themselves filled with the divine reality which was conceived and handed down as being something separate apart from the promises? In the final analysis, the author and the content of the promises are then the same thing and the future to which they point is a phenom enal form of the future of God itself, of the future of his reign—the power over that which was temporally present at the time was pro claimed in the promulgation of the promises. The unity of the promising God with his promise finds its comple tion in the fulfillment of the promise: for the fulfillment will bring the glorification of man and the world and consequently their participa tion in the glory of God. The salvation promised by God is himself. This is substantiated by Bloch's interpretation that the "messianic" line of the history of religion and of the history of Israel finds its goal in divine-human unity. Of course, this unity is "human entry into the re ligious mystery" only on the condition that the power of the future, the coming reign of God, has become effective in the temporal present and has taken hold of man. The man moved by the future of God certainly places himself, his trust and his hope in the future of God. In the proc ess, however, the ontological primacy of the future of God over every present form of the human realization of existence remains in force. Man partakes in the glory of God only to the extent that he continually goes beyond what he is and beyond the conditions he finds in the world: not by means of flight from the world, but by active transformation of 294 CROSS CURRENTS: SUMMER 1968</page><page sequence="12">the world; for this transformation is the expression of divine love and of the power of the future over the present by virtue of the transforma tion of the present directed toward the glory of God. However, neither in the homousia of Christ with the Father nor in the promised community of the faithful with God anticipated through the Spirit does the unity with God have the character of a tensionless uniformity. The Father is not displaced by the Son; for the homousia of Jesus with God is substantiated precisely by the fact that Jesus di rected mankind completely away from himself toward the coming reign of the Father. With precisely this message his own person became a decision for those people whom he encountered: a decision in respect to the reign of God itself. The unity of Jesus with God has been medi ated negatively; it was accomplished in the unconditionality of Jesus' self-devotion to the Father. Precisely in this he revealed himself as the Son of the Father. Thus, the difference of the temporally present pres ent (Vorhandenes) from the future of God and his reign appear in Jesus' own relationship to the father as well. Only by acknowledging this dif ference, only by completely serving the coming reign of God and not himself is he one with God. This is correspondingly the case of the Christians in whom the Spirit of Jesus Christ is active. By serving the future of God, his coming reign among men, they can already partici pate—in the present—in the filiation of Jesus: identity with him only by means of the transformation of their own existence on the basis of Jesus: community with the future of God only by means of going be yond their own presentness (Vorfindlichkeit) and beyond what is pres ent in the world to the transformation of the world through love. Thus, the Doctrine of the Trinity is the seal of the pure futurity of God which does not reside in impotent diastasis as a hereafter relative to the tem poral present of mankind, but which draws the temporal present into itself and reconciles it with itself through the pain of the negative.
