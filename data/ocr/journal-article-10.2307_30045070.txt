It is there with me when I dance before you on a stage. We all carry this history inside and it costs us. Bill T. Jones, Last Night on Earth, 1995 After I had made so many works with themes that arephilosophical and social and so on, I had to ask myselfifmyprimary commitment was still to movement. The answer was yes-so I've gone aboutfinding different ways of dancing. Bill T. Jones, Salon, March 28, 1997 A Seemingly Formal Turn For the past few years, critics, fans, and even Bill T. Jones himself have been talking about the artist's move from explicitly political, identity-based works to an investiga- tion of aesthetics and pure movement. They talk about the more conventional makeup of Jones's current ensemble-the fact that Lawrence Goldhuber and Alexandra Beller are no longer in the company, dancers described in the New York Times as "imperfect" because "chubbier than the norm" (Dunning 200oo2). They discuss the fact that Jones rarely uses text these days and is no longer confrontational. He dances to Beethoven and performs at Lincoln Center with the Chamber Music Society. In a 1997 interview with Richard Covington, Jones explains this shift in his work by stating, "It's not quite as sexy to talk about. What was being said in those earlier works was as important as how it was being danced. Here, I'm trying to think about how it's danced first, trusting that the political, social, all those things are in our bodies literally, and in the eyes of the beholder" (Covington 1997). Danielle Goldman received her bachelor's studies. In addition to teaching expository degree in philosophy from Stanford Univer- writing to freshmen at NYU's Tisch School sity and her master's degree from New York of the Arts, she dances for Troika Ranch, a University's Department of Performance company known for its innovative use of in- Studies, where she is currently working to- teractive digital media. wards her PhD with an emphasis in dance 68</page><page sequence="2">While crucial to understanding Jones's seemingly formal turn, his trust in what bodies house complicates any reading of Ghostcatching, a i999 installation that used motion-capture technology to present traces ofJones's dancing, extracted from the live, racially marked body that labors in its dancing. With Ghostcatching, the dance of Bill T. Jones became virtual, moving in a sense beyond the body. How then, if at all, does the work hold onto its politics? Does Ghostcatching represent Jones's most radical formalist turn? Can politics transpire in a virtual dance that allows neither sweat nor skin, pri- mary markers of labor and race, to appear on stage? Complicating current discussions of his renewed interest in the "how" of dance, I will place Ghostcatching within a history of imaging technologies and the working body, drawing a powerful historical line in which the dancing body intersects with race, labor, and technology. I will argue that Ghostcatching provides a new generation in a genealogy of automatons and mechanized figures, challenging previous modes of commodification and enjoyment of the racial- ized other. When Ghostcatching appears as part of The Breathing Show, an evening of live performance by Jones, black identity and politics emerge, even through a skinless medium that does not tolerate sweat. Before working with Jones on Ghostcatching, digital media artists Paul Kaiser and Shelley Eshkar worked with Merce Cunningham to produce Hand Drawn Spaces and Biped, motion-capture pieces that met with critical acclaim. With motion capture, reflective sensors are placed on a moving body. Cameras surrounding the dancer then record the movements of each sensor in time and space, feeding this data into a com- puter for animators, in this case Kaiser and Eshkar, to choreograph and design. Cun- ningham, long interested in the type of formalism that Jones challenged throughout his career, did not care if Kaiser and Eshkar's technology captured his dancers' "identities." For example, in Biped, Cunningham taught movement sequences to two dancers, one male and one female. Their motion was then captured and drawn without sexual mark- ings, enabling the combination of their phrases; the dancers were merged. But if Cun- ningham attracted Kaiser and Eshkar with his abstract, linear movement, his focus on form and his willingness to experiment with technology, most famously with Life- Forms software, Bill T. Jones attracted the digital artists for different reasons. Accord- ing to Kaiser, they were intrigued by Jones's movement style, which they believed to be more fluid and less angular than Cunningham's, and thus more challenging to capture with their new technology. The other reason, however, had to do with Jones as an out- spoken, politicized, gay, black choreographer. Kaiser explains, "We were also interested in working with Bill, not as a choreographer of a group, but as a choreographer of him- self: of his own body, of his own identity" (De Spain 20oob, 20). Together with his lover and dance partner, Arnie Zane, Jones began dancing in the late i960s/early 1970s with admiration for Yvonne Rainer's call for the elimination of virtuosity, spectacle, and style. By 1974, Jones believed in the utopian project of contact improvisation, claiming that it "encouraged an unselfconscious, direct physical inti- macy in which all differences-weight, size, psychological temperament, even gender and race-were negated in favor of cohesion-tissue to tissue, bone to bone, muscle to muscle" (Jones and Gillespie 1995, 158). However, as Jones and Zane continued making Dance Research Journal 35/2 and 36/1 (Winter 2003 and Summer 2004) 69</page><page sequence="3">work together, a productive tension arose between Zane's reluctance to include auto- biographical material in their works, and Jones's opposite tendency. Despite a great deal of criticism, Jones increasingly provided a place for the personal in his work. In retrospect, he explains that "We had to respond to the fact that I was a black man who used the word 'nigger' in the context of a work that had been a moment ago-we thought-purely about form, time, repetition, maybe the personalities of the dancers ." (Daly 1998, 119). Jones consistently applied pressure to notions of formal purity by exploring the politics of personal identity. Arnie Zane and Bill T. Jones officially formed their own company, the Bill T. Jones/Arnie Zane Dance Company, in 1982, a company immediately known for the diversity of its members. Together they produced a range of works that continually nudged and challenged the avant-garde. By 1990, two years after Zane died of AIDS, Jones had committed himself to mak- ing works that dealt explicitly with his identity. Regarding his seminal work, Last Sup- per at Uncle Tom's Cabin/The Promised Land, Jones states, "I reasoned that if my time was limited, that if I was to follow Arnie soon ... I would speak in a voice that was de- cidedly African-American ... " (Jones and Gillespie 1995, 197). Between Jones's overtly political Last Supper and the discussions about formal purity that encircle his current work, a notorious controversy erupted over his 1994 piece, Still/Here. For the piece, Jones journeyed around the country conducting movement workshops with volunteers who were terminally ill. According to Jones, "Still/Here I thought was going to be a work that nobody would find controversial-there was no controversy. It wasn't about my black rage. It was going to be unassailably about human experience, or so I thought" (ones 2002). The evening-length work that Jones choreographed for his professional dance company drew elements of its movement vocabulary from these workshops and incorporated sound and video of workshop participants. It was a poetic dance about survival, famously denounced by New Yorker critic Arlene Croce as "victim art." Refusing on principle to see Still/Here, Croce proclaimed the piece "undiscussable" for the critic. In a particularly brutal passage, voicing galling privilege and narrow vi- sion, Croce explains: I can't review someone I feel sorry for or hopeless about. As a dance critic, I've learned to avoid dancers with obvious problems-overweight dancers (not fat dancers; Jackie Gleason was fat and was a good dancer), old dancers, dancers with sickled feet, or dancers with physical deformities who appear nightly in roles re- quiring beauty of line. In quite another category of undiscussability are those dancers I'm forced to feel sorry for because of the way they present themselves: as dissed blacks, abused women, or disfranchised homosexuals-as performers, in short, who make out of victimhood victim art. (2000, 710) The New Yorker article incensed Jones back in the mid-I99os and continues to weigh heavily on the production and reception of his work. To this day, he solemnly refuses to mention Croce by name. But Croce was not a lone "guardian" during the culture wars and identity politics of the 1990s. Jones and his company frequently encountered protests and pickets in their tours around the country. After a while, Jones says, "I had 70o Dance Research Journal 35/2 and 36/1 (Winter 2003 and Summer 2004)</page><page sequence="4">sort of had it .... This is not what I want to do. And so I began to think about leaving art or going more deeply into what I loved to begin with, which was movement" (Jones 2002). One could argue that Jones's formal turn was overdetermined by a particular politi- cal moment that could subsequently disappear, if it has not already. But this line of ar- gument in no way loosens the bond between politics and form, shifting across cultures and historical periods but never falling away. Jones's renewed interest in the "how" of dancing differs from a naive retreat into a land of imagined formal purity. Jones ex- plains it quite clearly: "I think it's impossible to perform any ritualized activity in a pub- lic sphere that is politically neutral. I think it's impossible. All art forms, including Merce Cunningham, who is my favorite choreographer, Merce claims that it's po- litically neutral, it's not. Trisha [Brown], who is a great teacher to me, whom I love, thinks it's politically neutral, it's not" (Jones 2002). As a black man dancing in a time and place where whiteness is largely invisible and so-called formal purity looks suspi- ciously like traditionally white aesthetics, Jones understands the problematic naivet6, the exclusivity of imagining a formal realm free of politics. In a recent interview at New York University, Jones asks an auditorium full of stu- dents if we are past the point of racial looking: "Are we there yet?" Nudging the audito- rium full of mostly white students to realize the distance we have yet to travel in pursuit of such looking, Jones continues, "Why can't I be free?" Committed to blackness in all its variance and doubtful of our collective "there-ness" with respect to race-free looking, Jones nevertheless maintains his renewed interest in form. Pushing boundaries and ask- ing questions even when the answers are unclear, Jones urges the students, "Can you see with two sets of eyes? Can you see the identity, and also see the form? What is at stake on that stage?" Recognizing that Jones's talk about pure movement never strays from an awareness of the stakes involved, one gets the sense that he doesn't want to re- treat from the political, but just does not want to foreground it constantly, using the same vocabulary that he used in the 199os. Caught in this bind, Jones calls for a compli- cated doubling: "Can you see with two sets of eyes?" (Jones 2002). The most radical aspect of Jones's call, and perhaps the easiest to miss, is that he genuinely seeks a doubling, a vision whose sum is larger than its parts. He rejects an either/or situation, where the viewer alternates between two strands of vision, focusing on identity one moment and form the next. Either strand of his vision, no matter how celebratory the discourse, is problematic in isolation. Therefore, Jones seeks a "both/ and" type of vision. He asks, "When you look at my stage now, can you look with two sets of eyes? Do you see the sexual preference of the person, the race of the person, the gender of the person, and then, can you see what they're doing? And how the two come together to create a vision that is, that makes you want to look more carefully, want to dance, to want to touch one another?" (Jones 2002). In seeking an "ethics of transcul- tural performance," dance scholar Andre Lepecki configures a similar choreographic task for the viewing audience. Claiming "laziness in seeing" as dance viewers' primary pathology when faced with a body from another culture, Lepecki calls for a delicate partnering between audience and dancer. "How can my audience body become a part- Dance Research Journal 35/2 and 36/1 (Winter 2003 and Summer 2004) 71</page><page sequence="5">ner to those bodies dancing for me?" (Lepecki 2000, 13). Rather than brutally attempt- ing to wipe out difference with an imagined formal purity, or remain content in a dis- tanced relationship of "respect" while reducing the other to his or her most obvious markers of alterity, Jones urges audiences to view the other doubly, with two sets of eyes, and meet the performer as a partner. Ghostcatching's Cool Blue Lurchings Given Jones's choreographic call for double vision, his belief that the political and the social are held within the fleshy body, and his adamant stance that his formal turn does not sacrifice his politics, Ghostcatching presents a particular challenge. Does Ghostcatch- ing allow for the type of double looking that Jones desires, or does identity fall away completely in the virtual image? How might the audience view, or dance, with these digital traces? Faced with the opportunity to collaborate with accomplished digital media artists and motion-capture technology, Jones was eager to experiment, but not without reservations. Intrigued and impressed with Kaiser and Eshkar's previous work with Cunningham, but forthright in his concerns regarding the project, Jones clearly told his collaborators, "I do not want to be a disembodied, denatured, degendered se- ries of lines moving in a void" (Kaiser, www.kaiserworks.com). According to Kaiser, whereas Cunningham's Hand-drawn Spaces reveled in the supposed freedom of ab- stracted motion, Ghostcatching would question it. After Ghostcatching premiered at the Cooper Union in January 1999, Jones, Kaiser, and Eshkar returned to the motion-capture studio to rework parts of the piece. A video version then appeared within Jones's tour of The Breathing Show, an evening of live solo performance by Jones. I will discuss this version of Ghostcatching. Blue light appears onstage, projected onto a giant screen. A rectangular outline of a box ap- pears. It looks hand drawn, like blue sticks surrounded by black-a black screen and a dark auditorium (Fig. i). A sketch-like figure, the motion-captured Jones, then appears within the confines of this big blue box that resembles a mysterious cage. Straight blue lines suggest the figure's shape, much like the box surrounding him. The figure begins to move through a series of six positions, lettered A through F, while a voice, seemingly emerging from the blue figure, calls out the letter with each shift of position. The figure, clearly male, clearly Jones, sculpts himself into linear movements-sharp lines-much like profiled figures in an Egyptian frieze. The figure makes his way A through F and then begins again. Before long, a new figure, also Jones, emerges and moves through the boundaries of the box to dance briefly around its borders before disappearing. The figure on the inside continues all the while to move through and call out his sequence of lettered movements. Another figure appears and breaks free from the confines of the box. Seemingly without struggle, the figure (composed of curving lines as opposed to the other's sticklike outlines) moves through visible boundaries. It moves fluidly and speaks in a whisper. The two images dance while facing each other, speaking their letters as if in a taunting sequence of call and response. The outside figure then reenters the box and disappears. 72 Dance Research journal 35/2 and 36/1 (Winter 2003 and Summer 2004)</page><page sequence="6">Figure i: Still from Ghostcatching, 1999, by Bill T Jones, Paul Kaiser, and Shelley Eshkar. Image courtesy of Kaiser/Eshkar. Yet another figure of Jones-the most fully drawn, perhaps most clearly resembling a three-dimensional dancing body-leaps out of the box. He dances with fluidity and grace, tak- ing up expanses of space outside the box, leaving traces with his hands and feet. Much like the famous photographs of Picasso painting with light, here it seems as though lights attach to the figure's distal ends, enabling him to draw with his dancing, leaving traces all the while. A leg gracefully arcs into arabesque, leaving a semicircle trace of light in its wake. The figure falls into a squat with arms raising overhead, once again marking the pathways of his body. Another figure, seemingly more violent, with razorlike sounds accompanying the traces he makes through space, appears and they begin to dance a duet amid the traces they leave. The first figure then becomes suspended, as if caught. His traces remain and then gently begin to Dance Research journal 35/2 and 36/1 (Winter 2003 and Summer 2004) 73</page><page sequence="7">fade. We then hear Bill T. Jones humming a child's song that he sang earlier in the show: "Go tell Aunt Rhody, Go tell Aunt Rhody, Go tell Aunt Rhody the old gray goose is dead." Haunting, the materiality of Jones's voice, along with the memory of him dancing and singing the tune earlier in the evening's performance, imbricates the child's song of death (the old gray goose is dead) with rhythms of black vernacular dance, the weight of Jones's body, and his dexterous facial expressions. Meanwhile a new blue figure dances amid the traces, moving occasionally out of the boundaries of the screen. Jones continues to sing, only a new song now, more sinis- ter and otherworldly: "I'd fly away to the one I love..." Figures appear then get caught; traces remain. And all the while we hear Jones' voice, deep, low, and strange. As the piece moves toward its end, another figure crawls on the ground, scurrying, turning over, as if trying to escape. It is a doglike figure, and we hear Jones's voice once again, taunt- ing. We then view the original box from above. The original Jones-figure dances within its blue walls, turning and jumping. Now he too leaves traces, still within the confines of his box. Fi- nally, seven sticklike figures emerge, resembling the original caged image. They move as though bound within a blue web, roped with blue wire. They lunge out with weighted force but are caught, resembling a group of people moving in a chain gang. They cannot get very far. They are bound. At the end, confined, they remain blue and lurching. In The Breathing Show, the juxtaposition of live and digital bodies is immediately in- triguing. How do Ghostcatching's blue figures relate to the Jones who has a casual rela- tionship with the audience, taking time after his vigorously danced solos to wipe his brow with a towel, drink some water, and chat with the audience with all the confidence and style that people expect of him? Here, by contrasting the mediated figure in Ghost- catching and the live Jones, I do not mean to ignore the many ways that the live and the mediated overlap each other. Nor do I mean to embrace the modernist trap of suggest- ing that the sweating, chatting Jones is simplistically more "real" or "authentic" than the digital body. To be sure, even Jones's casual persona is a performed character, some- times enacted quite consciously. When discussing his early years dancing with Zane in Binghamton, Jones illustrates this type of performance: "We were showing a relatively small group of friends who we were, who we thought we were, and maybe what we wanted to be. But now Arnie and I were dancing before much larger groups of people, now we had public personas like suits of clothes that we put on, or were somehow put on for us" (Jones 2002). As much as any dancer in history, people expect things of Jones; among other things, viewers expect him to be dynamic, outspoken, and politicized. In re- lation to these expectations, either with or against, he performs. Granting the shifting and performative nature of the self Jones presents onstage, important distinctions nevertheless exist between his live and mediated forms as pre- sented in The Breathing Show. Particularly interesting, and politically important, is the virtual figure's inability to sweat or lose its breath like the live and fleshy Jones. This juxtaposition dances at the very foundation of the Ghostcatching collaboration. When Jones joined Kaiser and Eshkar in the motion-capture studio, he had twenty-four markers taped to his body as he danced in a studio full of lights, cameras, and screens (Fig. 2). Doubtful whether the new technology could actually capture the subtle nu- 74 Dance Research Journal 35/2 and 36/1 (Winter 2003 and Summer 2004)</page><page sequence="8">ances of his quivers and undulations, he nevertheless embarked on a series of improvisations in the studio. Ac- cording to Kaiser, "Six times he ran through the series, each improvisation freer and more fluid than the last. As his exuberance took over, the sweat poured out of him and some of the markers popped off of him" (De Spain 20ooa, I5). Discussing the early limita- tions and frustrations in the motion- capture studio, Jones describes the space as being a bit cold with a hard floor, less than ideal conditions for a dancer's body. More importantly, he echoes Kaiser in stating, "They hadn't really thought out the limitations of the sensors on my body.... Sure enough, once I began to sweat [the sensors] would pop off and then every- thing would stop.... And I said, 'I don't think your technology can ac- tually capture what I do"' (De Spain 2oooa, ii). Sweat and the new technol- ogy repelled each other from the be- ginning of the Gbostcatcbing project. The material outpouring of Jones's work-his sweat-actually stopped the motion of production. Jones was eventually impressed by the truth of the "dots swirling around on the computer screen," mesmerized by the fact that they presented his movement on a screen despite the ab- sence of his "body" (Fig.3). Neverth- Figure 2: Six steps are included in theprocess of trans- forming Bill TJonesfor Ghostcatching shown at less, there is very little trace, if any at http://www.kaiserworks.com/artworks/ghostcatchin all, of his labor, his improvisational ex- ghostprocess.htm.

Unlike the virtual image, unable to fatigue, the sweat of Jones's live dancing body creates exu- berance, providing material evidence of his recent labor and physical exertion. While admittedly not all labor is sweated and not all sweat is labor, here an undeniable gap emerges between the two figures, one digital and the other live. Making this gap visible Dance Research journal 35/2 and 36/1 (Winter 2003 and Summer 2004) 75</page><page sequence="9">has racialized, political ramifications seemingly of interest to Jones. Rather than bow graciously and then dis- appear behind the curtain, Jones talks with the audience, making audible his body's rapid pulse and need for breath. In No Respect: Intellectuals and Popular Culture, Andrew Ross discusses vari- ous images of work on the stage. In reference to jazz musicians specifically, he discusses the "spectacle of work," visibly signified by sweat on the brow, as carrying all sorts of meanings that make it less easy to romanticize than the spontaneous, virtuosic master of leisure onstage. "It is the sweat of the vestigial minstrel clown, but is also the reminder of the sweat of slave labor ... a comforting reminder to a white audience that labor exists, and is else- where, in a black body. But it is also a militant negation of the racist stereo- type of the 'lazy' i.e. underemployed black male" (Ross 1989, 85). By con- trast, Ross states that "in the 'cool' world of modern jazz ushered in by bebop, evidence of strenuous activity is Figure3: Step3: Markers optically recorded and converted to supposed to be interpreted as a sign of digital3D files. Remaining steps of the transformation process mental and not physical labor" (1989, can be see; at http://www.kaiserworks.com/artworks/ghost- 85). Here we see a shunning of the catching/g Image courtesy ofKaiser/Eshker. physical, a movement totally bound with a racial history. But Jones is a black male dancer, master of an art where beauty and virtuosity exist as necessarily bound with the physical. What, now, do we make of an unabashedly sweating Bill T. Jones, an iconic figure in the dance world known for his identity- centered work, placed up against his motion-captured image, dancing without sweat and skin, the most prominent visible signs of labor or of race? While the virtual motion- captured figure itself has no sweat or racial markings, its juxtaposition with the live dancing Jones invigorates their absence in a way that problematizes any simple cele- bration or comfort that the audience might take in the slick blue images appearing on the screen. Not only do we remember Jones when we see the virtual movement that clearly resembles his style, but we hear his voice at various points, making it impossible to shut out remembrances of the fleshy body, black and working. 76 Dance Research Journal 35/2 and 36/1 (Winter 2003 and Summer 2004)</page><page sequence="10">Automatons, Labor, and the Racialized Other The absence of sweat in a virtual image of a black dancing body recalls a long history of relationships between imaging technologies and the working body. Automatons that could work and perform expressive techniques without any signs of fatigue have fasci- nated people for centuries. Frequently, remarks Allen Feldman (2000), these automa- tons were aestheticized precisely via images of the colonial subject. Human automatons in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, as well as the later chronophotography of Etienne-Jules Marey, are some of the ghosts present in the Ghostcatching collaboration of Kaiser, Eshkar, and Jones. Francis Barker, a professor of literature at the University of Essex, has a dark view of human fascination with automatons, claiming that notions of artificial humans have haunted the individual throughout modernity. "It [the automaton] appears in our pe- ripheral vision; in our dreams and nightmares, in our psyches, in our films, and in our philosophy, and so on. And it appears not as the romantic 'other' of our normality, but as the question of the normative itself' (I995, viii). He argues that historically automa- tons have fundamentally challenged closely guarded notions of human authenticity. Considering Ghostcatching, dance scholar Kent De Spain voices similar anxiety by ask- ing, "If 'humanity' is important, how will we define what is human and what is not in an era of increasingly extensive and invasive biotechnology? Will what is imaginable on a computer become what is demanded on a stage, and will the dancers who try to fulfill that vision be forced to resort to more and more medical assistance to improve or repair their overtaxed bodies?" (2000a, 6). De Spain echoes Barker's claims regarding the anx- iety brought on by automatons throughout modernity: How do we maintain our sense of the human in the face of increasingly sophisticated technological mappings of and abstractions from the body? In addition, De Spain expresses the fear of failing, ex- hausted, "overtaxed" bodies, a condition common in both factory workers and dancers, albeit in different ways. In discussing the history of automatons, scholars frequently note the famous cre- ations of the sixteenth to eighteenth centuries: "The Musician" by Pierre Jaquet-Droz, which amazed audiences in 1773 with its mechanical woman who played a miniature clavichord by pressing her fingers upon the keys; or Jacques de Vaucanson's gilt-brass duck that not only quacked and waddled like a real duck, but more importantly also made visible its internal digestive processes. Feldman has recently added to this rich scholarship on reproductions of everyday life by conducting an insightful archaeology linking automatons, labor, and the senses. In his essay, "The Human Touch: Towards a Historical Anthropology and Dream Analysis of Self-Acting Instruments," dance and labor bear a relationship from the very first sentence describing Father Athanasius Kircher's seventeenth-century diagram of an automated water organ. On the right side of the organ, automatons made to look like blacksmiths are hard at work with their hands, while on the left side, grotesque figures dance a dance of death. Thus begins Feldman's claim that automated musical instruments have far-reaching implications for our understanding of bodies in motion and work (Feldman 2000, 224). Dance Research Journal 35/2 and 36/1 (Winter 2003 and Summer 2004) 77</page><page sequence="11">Seeking to explain the fascination that greeted the numerous automatons of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, Feldman conducts a brief history of clockwork instruments. To begin, he notes a gradual shift from explicit bodily recreations to an emphasis on human tasks, like playing music, without any necessary iconic resemblance to humans. While figures resembling humans initially thrilled people, mechanized figures realistically performing human tasks fascinated them even more. A model that could realistically play the piano or a miniature piano that could play a real piece of music without any figure whatsoever pleased and intrigued people, with a twinge of the anxiety noted by Barker. By the eighteenth century, which Feldman takes to be the classical age for automaton design, these mechanized figures became increasingly miniaturized, so that by the nineteenth century they made their way from the courts and exhibit halls of Europe to the domestic space of the bourgeois parlor. They became decorous household curios. Interestingly, Feldman argues that these automatons aes- theticized the body as well as contributed to its consumption and the perpetuation of normative ideals. In keeping with this claim, during the age of mechanical reproduc- tion in the nineteenth century, these automatons implied a great deal about the goals of human labor, a serious issue at the time. In short, Feldman argues that characteristics granted to the miniaturized mechanisms in bourgeois living rooms created metaphors for real workers in the factory. But if the automatons aestheticized the body and were part of a broader com- modification, the question remains: What exactly did people consume in the automa- tons? What did automatons offer? Why were they such a source of fascination, and for whom? According to Feldman, the advertisements for these mechanical creations sug- gest "that the moral career of the labouring body under industrial capitalism intersected the moral career of the musical automaton, as a mechanical worker and aesthetic expe- rience" (2000, 236). He maintains that automatons encompassed factory, worker, and product all in one-in short, the spectacle of mechanical labor complete except for the individual. Feldman suggests that by teaching its audience how to play with machines, the automaton relieved the pressure or burden of labor, making it an aesthetic product of consumption. In his section called "Exhausted Mechanisms," Feldman explains that during the nineteenth century, anxiety about fatigue and economic production arose. Of course, Karl Marx is the most famous chronicler and theorist of these nineteenth-century changes in economic production. In volume one of Capital (Das Kapital), first pub- lished in 1867, Marx discusses the many changes in labor brought about by the ma- chine. Most relevant to our discussion of automatons and exhaustion, Marx explains the irony in the fact that "the most powerful instrument for reducing labour-time suf- fers a dialectical inversion and becomes the most unfailing means of turning the whole lifetime of the worker and his family into labour-time at capital's disposal for its own valorization" (1976, 532). Machines had the capacity to increase a worker's productivity while also eliminating the backbreaking nature of manual labor. Marx cites the cotton gin (1793) as a clear example, enabling a worker to go from separating and cleaning one pound of cotton per day to one hundred pounds, presumably without the same strain. 78 Dance Research Journal 35/2 and 36/1 (Winter 2003 and Summer 2004)</page><page sequence="12">But, Marx argues, instead of relieving workers, these machines made it possible for anyone and everyone, including women and children, to join the work force and en- abled the workday to be stretched entirely beyond natural limits. This, he notes, is the gruesome paradox of capitalism in the age of machines: "It creates, on the one hand, new conditions which permit capital to give free rein to this tendency, and on the other hand, new incentives which whet its insatiable appetite for the labour of others" (1976, 526). And since the machine does not fatigue, it could seemingly go on producing forever were it not for the limits of its human operators, which became pushed to extremes. Of course, as noted by Marx, machines cannot literally produce indefinitely with the same degree of effectiveness. He explains that machines physically deteriorate in two different ways: "The one arises from use, as coins wear away by circulating, the other from lack of use, as a sword rusts when left in its scabbard" (1976, 528). In addi- tion, there is the "moral depreciation" that occurs in machinery, either when similar machines become available more cheaply or when more sophisticated machines arise. Despite these limitations-and the fact that he frequently animates machinery, dis- cussing, for example, its vitality or death-Marx clearly distinguishes between machine labor (fixed capital) and living labor, or labor-power, which exists as an aggregate of mental and physical capabilities of a human being. The working day for a living laborer has limits that vary from that of a machine. According to Marx: This maximum limit is conditioned by two things. First by the physical limits to labour-power. Within the 24 hours of the natural day a man can only expend a certain quantity of his vital force. ... During part of the day the vital force must rest, sleep; during another part the man has to satisfy other physical needs to feed, wash and clothe himself. Besides these purely physical limitations, the extension of the working day encounters moral obstacles. The worker needs time in which to satisfy his intellectual and social requirements. (1976, 341) In many ways, the struggle between worker and machine lies at the heart of the capital- ist mode of production-capital striving to reduce man's resistance to an ever-expand- ing workday, with the apparently undemanding, alienating nature of machine opera- tion making such resistance all the more difficult. Still trying to figure out why people in this age of industrial production derided by Marx were so fascinated by mechanical automatons that never grew tired, Feldman carefully notes that the utopian image of automatons appeared mainly in the privacy and security of the middle class, far from the concrete class tensions and the physical stress of the factory floor (2000, 248). Feldman paraphrases Anson Rabinach, who claims that, "the production ideologies of the nineteenth century understood the phys- ical limits of the labouring body, particularly the body under the stress and strain of industrial mass production, as a moral horizon that set the practical limits of civilisa- tional progress" (2000, 244). If capital was the way to progress, fatigue provided an ob- stacle to be overcome. This is precisely the problem noted by Marx. In addition, Feld- man argues that fatigue and exhaustion in the factory space were linked not only to Dance Research Journal 35/2 and 36/1 (Winter 2003 and Summer 2004) 79</page><page sequence="13">broad social breakdown, but also to "the uncontrollable and involuntary release of ir- rational behavior and sexual drives that were antithetical to the public morality of the work ethic and the private morality of bourgeois decorum" (2ooo, 246). The bour- geoisie feared the activities that the working class engaged in to let off steam, activities like sex and alcohol consumption that supposedly represented a fall into the realm of mere instinct. According to Feldman, the automatons offered a perfect view of labor that had no need for these "uncontrollable" behaviors. Feldman also proposes that au- tomatons in some instances were targeted to the working class as images of moral up- lift: figures that work unceasingly, without the need to rest or recuperate (2000, 246). Labor's necessary fatigue was entirely absent from the automatons and scripted as moral faltering. Furthermore, the technology of eighteenth- and nineteenth-century automatons was often aestheticized precisely by images of the colonial subject. According to Feldman: There were the Swiss automata that depicted anthropomorphic, ape-like, Ne- groid fiddlers, or the automated, moving, and musical elephant mounted by a brown skinned Hindu mahout. There was a whole series of Orientalist automata: soothsayers, magicians, and conjurers such as the Chinese magician sitting in a temple or a music box showing a magician in Persian dress flanked by two mon- key musicians in Asiatic costume playing cello and violin. There were the Arab tightrope dancer with black musicians playing drums; the Indian snake charmer who played clockwork music through a flute, the Negro dressed in slave garb; an- other Negroid narghile smoker, dressed in Egyptian costume, with exaggerated lips drinking a cup of coffee; an automaton of a westernized Negro being shaved; and that of a black crossbowman wearing nothing but a loin cloth made of palm leaves. (2000, 249) Interestingly, the Industrial Revolution did not put an end to fascination with au- tomatons, but rather new imaging technologies became available to aid in bodily repro- ductions and points of view. Graphic images and photographic recordings, for exam- ple, emerged to map the body in detail, with labor figuring into the equation ever more explicitly. Scientific photography in the late nineteenth century began to reveal a new, motorlike body. The body as a type of labor power, an image remarked upon and heav- ily theorized by Marx, resulted in new types of research that attempted to understand how to use this labor power most efficiently, with minimal fatigue. Etienne-Jules Marey, a nineteenth-century French scientist who devoted his life to the study of movement in a wide variety of forms, from internal organs, to athletes, to horses, to birds, contributed a great deal to this type of labor research. While the work of Marey is often talked about in the same breath as Taylorism and scientific manage- ment, Marey's work had a much broader scope. Possessing both an artistic and a sci- entific sensibility, Marey was fascinated and inspired by anything that moved. By 1867, the same year as the publication of volume one of Marx's Capital, Marey began to in- vestigate the external motion and movement of bodies. He used a graphing device with one end attached to a moving object and the other attached to a stylus that inscribed 80 Dance Research Journal 35/2 and 36/1 (Winter 2003 and Summer 2004)</page><page sequence="14">the moving object's fluctuations onto a carbon-blacked strip of paper (Mul- cahy). Since the object needed to be attached to the graphing tool, these graphing devices were limited in what they could record. Having seen Eadward Muybridge's photographs of galloping horses in an 1879 issue of the journal La Nature, Marey began corresponding with Muy- bridge and soon embarked on his own photographic studies. A professor of Natural History of Organized Bodies at the College de France, Marey sought new photographic methods to capture the principles underlying movement, as opposed to merely representing it. With these experiments in mind, Marey is of- ten cited as the earliest and most direct precursor to the motion-capture tech- nology used by Paul Kaiser and Shelley Eshkar in their collaboration with Bill T. Jones. While the recent digital work done in 1999 was clearly much more sophisticated and did many different things that Marey's work could not, they started from similar places and the visual images from both processes are strikingly similar. While Marey devel- oped a wide range of techniques in seeking movement's underlying princi- ples, the one most related to the re- cent work with motion capture was called chronophotography. Here, Marey cloth his subject entirely in black with the exception of thin white bands Figure 4: Marey's z9th-c. motion-capture suit. Imag with the permission ofDr. Russell Naughton, Ph.D or bright metal buttons strategically attached to the body (Fig 4). Marey would then photograph the moving figure against a black interior, thereby capturing only the movements of the strips, making visible what he considered to be the essential components of movement (Fig. 5). Marey went on to replace the strips and buttons with tiny lights to create photographic images with greater precision. Used to study the movements of soldiers and patients in Parisian hospitals, Marey's techniques captured Dance Research Journal 35/2 and 36/1 (Winter 2003 and Summer 2004) 81</page><page sequence="15">Figure 5: Exposure showing Mareys motion-capture suit markers. Image used with the permission of Dr. Russell Naughton, Ph.D. movement without the distractions provided by the exterior of a subject's body (Mulc- ahy). Marey aimed to reveal the invisible movement behind or beyond the visible mov- ing body, a desire that we hear echoed and complicated in Jones's recent return to form. The visual rhyming between Marey's motion-capture experiments and those of Kaiser/Eshkar with Jones are striking. And although a century stands between early ex- periments with chronophotography and recent work with motion capture, Paul Kaiser's aims resemble Marey's attempt to capture movement without the "distractions" of the subject's fleshy, or visible, body. When asked by Kent De Spain whether we were mov- ing into an era of posthuman dance, Kaiser responded by distancing his motion- capture works from dance, claiming that these works were more about drawing, unable to replace the "ecstasy and the immediacy of live dancers" (De Spain 2000b, 21). Kaiser goes on to say that with motion capture's ability to abstract dance from its physical ba- sis, "It's moving away [from the physical basis of the performer] ... and I think that might clean out our eyes in many ways. I think that in looking at performers on the 82 Dance Research Journal 35/2 and 36/1 (Winter 2003 and Summer 2004)</page><page sequence="16">stage we are seduced by the charisma of the body rather than by the beauty of the movement" (De Spain 2000b, 21). The beauty of human movement fascinated both Marey and Kaiser/Eshkar, espe- cially when abstracted from bodily "distractions." But what are these bodily distractions, for "charisma" is an interesting choice of words? As I have already stated, Jones's labor as well as his skin have been "ghosted," two things clearly bound together, but also bound with Jones's so-called "charisma." As part of Arlene Croce's ongoing feud with Jones, she accused him in 1995 of having let his "charisma" get the better of him, blinding him to the pitfalls of identity-centered work. Regarding what she calls the "permissiveness" of art in the I960s and the "invidious logic at work in the campaigns of the multiculturalists, the moral guardians, and the minority groups," Croce remarks that "Jones, caught up in his own charisma, didn't seem to hear the trap being sprung" (2000, 718). According to Marey, and Kaiser one hundred years later, race and labor had to be removed in order to "clean our eyes out" and get at the "beauty of pure movement." Tight Places and Images of Confinement Recall, however, that Jones did not want to be "a disembodied, denatured, degendered series of lines moving in a void" (Kaiser, www.kaiserworks.com). Jones wanted to chal- lenge the so-called freedom of abstracted movement, the imagined pure neutrality of form. By strategically revealing his sweat and skin throughout The Breathing Show, he uniquely challenges previous mechanized commodifications of the body. In addition, his pointed banter with the audience forces so-called abstraction into a consideration of race and politics. Early in The Breathing Show, having danced for several minutes to music by Schubert, Jones exclaims, "Anyway, this is where I'm supposed to swing into this thing about why I'm dancing to this dead European man's music." There is laugh- ter, and Jones, promising that it will not be "one of those evenings," discusses a painter friend who introduced Jones to Schubert's music. Having engaged with the music deeply for a choreographic project not long afterward, Jones claims to have realized that he was in fact a romantic. "I realized that I was a romantic-that was my problem." Laughter emerges from the audience. "When Arnie and I came to the scene in the late seventies, it was certainly not a romantic scene and I didn't know what to do .... But now I have come out as a romantic." Applause and laughter erupt, given the loaded phrase "come out" used triumphantly and with a twist. But really, this discussion is all about Jones's supposed, controversial turn to form. Most relevant to our discussion of race and labor during the nineteenth century, Jones then wonders aloud about the place of black Americans during Schubert's time. "Just to play with myself, I started to think: What would I have been like in 1830? What would I have been dancing like? I certainly wouldn't be here.... What would it have sounded like?" Upon reflection, one recog- nizes that Schubert (1797-I828) died thirty-five years before the emancipation procla- mation took effect. And with that, instead of the Schubert recordings blasting through the speakers, Jones sings "Go tell Aunt Rhody," the children's song he later sings in Ghostcatching-- Dance Research Journal 35/2 and 36/1 (Winter 2003 and Summer 2004) 83</page><page sequence="17">a sonic throughline of racism and slavery in America, linking the live Jones with his virtual image. Jones punctuates the verses with stomping, undulating, quite musical phrases of movement. Some of his steps are narrative, seeming to illustrate or interpret the lyrics, but in other cases they insert music into the breaks, alluding to vernacular styles. Meanwhile, the dancing affects the sound of the voice as we hear Jones's need for breath, and the stomps and leaps manifest in the juttings of his voice. He finishes the song not vocally, but with arms outstretched, head back, and mouth open. The final Schubert dance then begins, having been punctuated by a different sound, a live sound from the dancing Jones, danced and sung in resonance with a black radical tradi- tion emerging out of slavery. Equally important are Ghostcatching's images of confinement, evoking the historical criminalization of black mobility. In the interview with De Spain, Kaiser refers to the figures that emerge as "spawns," a term also used by Jones. These spawns break free only to get reabsorbed by the initial figure. According to Kaiser, "It's all about the no- tion of breaking free from your own representation, and being caught up in it again" (De Spain 2ooob, 20). The piece suggests the impossibility of breaking free-from one's own representation, but also from real confining spaces. How else to read the blue box and later the blue wires that frame and confine Jones's virtual "spawns"? The fact that the figure always gets "caught up in it again" troubles any simple celebration of freedom and mobility. As the piece progresses, the spawns that move with any sense of space and freedom end up frozen amid their blue traces. Perhaps the blue traces and boundaries surrounding Bill T. Jones and his virtual spawns can be better explained with a phrase developed and used throughout Houston Baker's recent book, Turning South Again. Baker develops the phrase "tight places" in order to discuss the historical criminalization of black mobility in relation to a desired black modernism of mobility and citizenship. Baker describes and defines tight places throughout the book, but he begins with Ralph Ellison's Jim Trueblood, who states in Invisible Man that he had to "move without moving," regarding the incestuous abuse of his daughter. Another dynamic, and less problematic, example is Booker T. Washing- ton, who was told that he had "got into a tight place" in being asked to speak in front of whites and blacks from the North and South, gathered together in 1895 (Baker 200oo, 14). According to Baker, "'Tight places' are constituted by the necessity to articulate from a position that combines specters of abjections (slavery), multiple subjects and signifiers (Trueblood's narrative is produced for a rich, northern, white philanthropist), representational obligations of race in America (to speak "Negro"), and patent sex and gender implications" (2001, 69). While Baker defines tight places variously throughout the book, ultimately they invoke the questions "Who moves? Who doesn't?" Historically, the black man has not been able to move (to say nothing of the black woman). As Baker notes, movement for African American men has been criminalized, most viciously under the Southern slave system, where white policing and surveillance prohibited black public or free mobility (2001, 42). Describing the black slaves' legal status in the American South, legal scholar and jurist Leon Higginbotham explains that blacks were forbidden to leave their owners' plantations without certification, 84 Dance Research Journal 35/2 and 36/1 (Winter 2003 and Summer 2004)</page><page sequence="18">thereby destroying their freedom of mobility. Beyond that, their ability to resist was di- minished, given that they could be severely punished (if not killed outright) for chal- lenging a Christian in any way, and of course they could not carry arms. Baker argues that while modernism was exemplified by Walter Benjamin's publicly mobile flaneur, a "mobile, observant, multiply personalitied city wanderer," this modernity was denied to the black masses. Baker goes on to argue, "The identity dilemma for the black majority is not captured by the declarative "one ever feels his two-ness," but rather by the inter- rogative "how do I break these all-too-real chains binding me?" (2ooI, 42). This genealogy of black immobilization shows that confinement plays a critical role in the auction block and black exploitation that haunts Jones. In Last Night on Earth, his 1995 autobiography, Jones laments, "I think that even those of us who have no no- tion of what the auction block was can still feel it, as if the memory of it is handed down to us through our mother's milk. ... It is there with me when I dance before you on a stage" (Jones and Gillespie 1995). When seen in the context of this history, Ghost- catching's blue images of confinement ring all the more forcefully. As for the absence of skin, in discussing the prohibition of mobility under slavery, Baker notes that "The body's natural 'color' was converted into a legalized marker of oppression. There was, in the total institution called slavery, an epidermalization of oppression. Skin color -in combination with facial features and hair texture-became southern grounds for maintenance of the ideological and economic project of White Supremacy" (2001, 43)- While one's various identity claims-racial, ethnic, class, religious, gender, sexuality, place, generation--by no means fit tidily along clear color lines, racism is nevertheless largely a visual pathology. Unlike Jones, perhaps Paul Gilroy would embrace Ghostcatching as further evidence that we have already moved to a point where vision-based race thinking is out of date. His controversial book, Against Race, published in 2000ooo, has infuriated many scholars with its call to eliminate liberal race-based thinking in the hope of a humanism that would somehow manage to move beyond the color line. Most relevant to our present discussion of race and visuality in relation to Ghostcatching is Gilroy's claim that new technologies, particularly in the medical field, have begun to transform what he calls "the old, modern representational economies that reproduced 'race' subdermally and epidermally" (2000, 43). He argues that advancements in molecular biology, which show that race is geneti- cally virtually insignificant, as well as the development of imaging technologies such as ultrasound and electromagnetic radiation have enabled new forms of scrutiny regard- ing the human body. Gilroy asks, "Have you, has your body, your child's body, ever been scanned? Do you recognize its changing optic density? If so, perhaps you could consider that development another compelling sign that we have begun to let the old visual signatures of'race' go" (200ooo, 43) A few pages later, engaging head-on with what Baker describes as the historical epidermalization of oppression whereby skin color became the grounds for white supremacy, Gilroy claims that "Today skin is no longer privileged as the threshold of either identity or particularity. There are good reasons to suppose that the line between inside and out now falls elsewhere. The boundaries of'race' have moved across the threshold of the skin. They are cellular and molecular, not dermal. If 'race' Dance Research Journal 35/2 and 36/1 (Winter 2003 and Summer 2004) 85</page><page sequence="19">is to endure, it will be in a new form, estranged from the scales respectively associated with political anatomy and epidermalization" (2000, 47). While motion capture is undoubtedly part of a range of new technologies that en- able new mappings and forms of scrutiny regarding the body, these advancements in technology have done little if anything to alter the general public's conception of the human body. We are a long way from realizing a utopian humanism in these increas- ingly fluid borders. One need only try to hail a cab or buy a car under certain circum- stances if one is not white, or take a look at the prison population, in order to see that the color of one's skin still has daily consequences for people of color in America. It is in this context that Bill T. Jones stood in front of students at NYU, asking, "But it is possible to be free of racial looking, right?" Following this teasing question Jones im- plored, "Why can't I be free?" (Jones 2oo2). At the same talk, Jones told the students that the first thing he did upon entering the packed auditorium, without even thinking, was to look around to count the number of black faces in the audience. Perhaps one could say that Jones was speaking from a 'tight place,' in Baker's sense of the phrase, especially regarding his supposed turn to form. He wants to foreground the how of dance, and yet he constantly reminds us of the stakes involved. He seems frustrated with the onus of always foregrounding the po- litical, and yet he is a black man dancing. At one moment, he professes an interest in turns and pointed feet, while a moment later he sings "We Shall Overcome." It is from this tight space that Jones calls for his doubling. "Can you see with two sets of eyes?" It is also out of this tight place that Jones, together with Kaiser and Eshkar, created Ghostcatching, which, especially when shown as part of The Breathing Show, challenges the "freedom" and beauty of motion abstracted from bodily "distractions." Ghostcatching within The Breathing Show ushers both a warning and a call to dance audiences, especially important as motion capture and other digital abstractions from the body become more prevalent in the dance world. It would be a great loss to reduce Bill T. Jones to a black choreographer, a gay choreographer, or whatever mark of dif- ference one chooses. Andre Lepecki refers to such reduction as a prison, built out of guilt and a lack of imagination (2000, I3). With movement that comes from many places-from laborers, Trisha, Arnie, his grandmother-Jones moves between con- structions of difference, neither stable nor essential. That being said, Jones makes clear the fact that we are not in a world beyond difference, outside of history. Back at the be- ginning of his career, he broke from the utopian claims of contact improvisation and other postmodern experiments invested in the notion that movement could be "pure" exercises with nothing at stake. He forced audiences to realize the limits and blind spots of such claims. Similarly today, even as he becomes increasingly interested in the how of dance, he points to the limits of motion-capture technology. Let us not em- brace its liberatory potential too quickly. Bill T. Jones tells us quite clearly that form is never neutral and removed from politics. He urges audiences to view dance doubly. And finally, however beautiful the resulting movement may be, he suggests that the act of "cleaning out one's eyes" by wiping away markers of difference could easily become a brutal hygiene. 86 Dance Research journal 35/2 and 36/1 (Winter 2003 and Summer 2004)</page><page sequence="20">Works Cited Baker, Houston. 2001.
