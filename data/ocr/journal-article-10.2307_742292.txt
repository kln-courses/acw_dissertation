<plain_text><page sequence="1">Music and Culture Dramatic Dialogue in Mozart's Viennese Piano Concertos: A Study of Competition and Cooperation in Three First Movements Simon P. Keefe How can we interpret the ways in which the soloist and the orchestra re- late to each other in a Mozart piano concerto? And to what extent can we assign dramatic properties to these relations? Such issues are awkward to address systematically, because dramatic frames of reference for inter- action between the piano and orchestral forces are difficult to establish. Many writers on Mozart's concertos have taken the easy way out, calling attention to striking, "dramatic" moments of piano-orchestra interaction without placing those moments in historical or structural contexts. To be sure, the analyst is faced with intrinsic limitations in assessing the process of behavioral change among "characters" over the course of a Mozart concerto. Not the least of these difficulties is the near impossibil- ity of distinguishing on musical and historical grounds between refined behavioral types, such as cooperation and collaboration, and competi- tion, confrontation, conflict, and struggle.' As we shall see, however, the systematic identification of alterations in general types of behavior is an important and a realistic goal. Comparing ideas introduced in late- eighteenth-century dramatic theory to ideas in music theory of the same period will help to clarify the nature of interaction between soloist and orchestra in Mozart's piano concertos. The confusing etymology of the word concerto has often encour- aged critics to identify cooperative and competitive behavior in these works. The term may have derived from any one of three sources: the Latin concertare (to compete, contend), the Italian concertare (to agree, act together), or the Latin conserere (to consort).2 Eighteenth-century writers on the concerto collectively reflect this etymological uncertainty, identifying a mixture of cooperative and competitive attitudes in the interaction between soloist(s) and orchestra. Mattheson and Walter, in 169</page><page sequence="2">170 The Musical Quarterly the first half of the eighteenth century, recognized the baroque con- certo's cooperative and competitive qualities.3 Heinrich Christoph Koch and A. E C. Kollmann, in the second half of the eighteenth century, emphasized one or the other motivation. Koch remarks that the orches- tra "signals him [the soloist] through short interspersed phrases some- times approval, sometimes acceptance of his expression, as it were. Now in the allegro it tries to stimulate his noble feelings still more; now it commiserates, now it comforts him in the adagio."4 In contrast, Koll- mann suggests that a concerto might "express a Conversation between a Melancholicus and Sanguineus," insinuating the kind of confrontation and argument worked into C. P. E. Bach's famous programmatic sonata, "A Conversation between a Cheerful Man and a Melancholy Man."5 References to cooperation and competition also surface in influen- tial nineteenth- and twentieth-century writings on Mozart's piano concertos, the two motivations often being combined within a single in- terpretation. Otto Jahn, for example, identifies in these works a "combi- nation of the orchestra and the solo instrument into a whole, by means of the cooperation of all their separate and independent elements."6 Co- operation, however, is not universal, for conflicts sometimes emerge. Mozart keeps the attention of the audience, for example, "by the compe- tition of the rival forces."'7 Cuthbert Girdlestone, while considering the "essence" of the concerto to be the "struggle" between the solo and the orchestra, nonetheless points out that "[the] struggle is broken by truces during which the orchestra and solo collaborate on friendly terms."8 And Charles Rosen, concerned above all with "contrast and struggle," offers analyses that stress the collaborative nature of Mozart's concertos.9 Not surprisingly, piano-orchestra competition-with its related no- tions of confrontation, conflict, and struggle-has often been recognized (particularly in the works of Mozart) as a central dramatic component of the late-eighteenth-century concerto. Donald Tovey, for example, de- scribes the classical concerto as "a highly dramatic and poetic art- form"'1 characterized by a "thrilling... antithesis of the individual and the crowd.""' Charles Rosen, clearly informed by Tovey, sees "the con- trast and struggle of one individual voice against many" as "the latent pathetic nature of the form."12 The classical concerto, he argues, was dramatized "in the most literally scenic way-the soloist was seen to be different."'3 Leonard G. Ratner also identifies a "dramatic confronta- tion" between the soloist and the orchestra.14 And most recently, Susan McClary interprets the late-eighteenth-century concerto as "a soloist and a large, communal group, the orchestra... [enacting] as a spectacle the dramatic tensions between individual and society.""15 There is, therefore, a long and venerable tradition both of drawing attention to cooperation and competition in Mozart's piano concertos</page><page sequence="3">Mozart's Viennese Piano Concertos 171 and of associating solo-orchestra competition with the dramatic nature of these works. As Janet Levy, among others, has perceptively observed, the preeminence of dramatic metaphors to describe solo-orchestra inter- action may be to some extent "rooted in primordial aspects of human experience," namely antithesis, opposition, and reconciliation.16 An- thropomorphic accounts of the dramatic nature of piano-orchestra inter- action have in fact yielded many intuitively satisfying interpretations of individual moments of interaction in Mozart's piano concertos. One such moment is the piano-orchestra conflict in the development section of the first movement of the Piano Concerto no. 24 in C Minor, K. 491 (mm. 325-45). Tovey writes of the orchestra's "majestic anger"; Girdle- stone describes it as a "duel" in which Mozart makes "an attempt to move us by the sheer force of the attack"; Arthur Hutchings identifies "daring clashes"; Eva Badura-Skoda calls it a "stormy outburst" (Sturm- ausbruch); and Joseph Kerman acclaims it as "a rare example in Mozart of a real struggle between solo and orchestra," with an "aggressive" or- chestra and a "horrified" solo.17 The question remains, however, of how we can best combine an established tradition of anthropomorphic de- scription-an attractive and effective means for conveying the dramatic intensity of relations between the two forces-with a more methodical examination of cooperation and competition. While we could undertake a rigorously theoretical approach, categorizing every type of interaction in Mozart's concertos and assigning motivations to specific instruments at specific moments on the basis of predetermined theoretical-analytical criteria, there would be innumerable practical difficulties in establishing such a comprehensive system. Instead, by situating interaction in Mo- zart's piano concertos within the historical context of dramatic dialogue, the most revered type of interaction in late-eighteenth-century dramatic theory, we can uncover the ways in which cooperation and competition manifest drama in these works. Section 1 compares late-eighteenth- century theoretical understandings of dramatic dialogue and dialogue in the concerto; section 2 analyzes dramatic dialogue and piano-orchestra relations in the first movements of three of Mozart's Viennese piano con- certos (K. 482, K. 450, and K. 449); finally, section 3 connects the tra- jectory of piano-orchestra relations in these movements to the trajectory of character relations in scenes from classical plays and concludes with a new dramatic perspective on how Mozart's concerto dialogue conveyed meaning to its contemporary listeners. 1 The writings of Koch and Kollmann mentioned above draw particular attention to dialogue as the principal type of solo-orchestra interaction in</page><page sequence="4">172 The Musical Quarterly the late-eighteenth-century concerto. Kollmann states that a "conversa- tion" is possible in the concerto, just as in C. P. E. Bach's famous trio sonata Sanguineus and Melancholicus;18 and Koch explains that the or- chestra's "approval" and "acceptance" of the soloist's expression is carried out in the course of "a passionate dialogue (leidenschaftliche Unterhaltung) between the concerto player and the accompanying orchestra."l9 But to what type of dialogue are Kollmann and Koch referring? Eighteenth- century writers differentiated between types of dialogue-for example, conversation and dramatic dialogue-depending upon the informal or formal nature of the context in which they occurred. In spite of func- tional specificity, however, terms such as "dialogue" and "conversation" were often used interchangably. In German dictionaries, the word con- versation was defined as Gesprdch (dialogue), Unterredung and Unterhal- tung,20 while Dialog was also defined as Gesprach and Unterredung.21 Gesprdch, in turn, was defined as freundschaftliche Unterhaltung (amicable conversation),22 and Unterhaltung (conversation in the communicative sense) as congenial exchange pleasantly passing the time.23 In English- language dictionaries, dialogue was usually characterized as a conversa- tion or a conference "between two or more,"24 and conversation was de- scribed as "familiar discourse."'25 Should Kollmann's "conversation" and Koch's "Unterhaltung," therefore, lead us to expect a musical version of informal conversation? Or are Koch and Kollmann invoking a more for- mal type of exchange? Koch, at least, states explicitly that the "leidenschaftliche Unter- haltung" between the concerto's soloist and orchestra takes place in a dramatic context. He remarks that "by a concerto, I imagine something similar to the tragedy of the ancients, where the actor [that is, the soloist] expressed his feelings not towards the pit, but to the chorus [the orchestra]."26 Koch also explains that the dramatic dialogue be- tween the soloist and the orchestra constitutes a specific type of immedi- ate exchange, which, projected across a concerto, conveys specific mean- ings. These "brief imitations" and the process whereby solo-orchestra relations develop-the orchestra "stimulat[ing] noble feelings," "com- miserating," "comforting," and so on27"-together constitute "passionate dialogue." Koch's invocation of dramatic dialogue, a notion of dialogue as a fo- cused exchange, suggests that the technique itself should be understood in a formal rather than a casual way. Antoine Reicha provides the classi- cal period's most comprehensive and systematic definition of formalized musical dialogue, at least at the level of immediate exchange. For him, dialogue comprises four musical procedures, of which the third is very similar to Koch's "brief imitations": "There are only the following four</page><page sequence="5">Mozart's Viennese Piano Concertos 173 ways of dialoguing a melody; first, by executing the full periods alter- nately [i.e., antecedent plus consequent]; second, by distributing the phrases (or constituent parts of the periods) among the different voices that are to execute the melody; third, by motives [dessins], that is to say, by little imitations; fourth, by starting a phrase with one voice and fin- ishing it with another."28 The components attributed to concerto dialogue by Koch-imme- diate exchange and extended process-are also broadly comparable to those assigned to dramatic dialogue by late-eighteenth-century drama- tists. Joseph von Sonnenfels comments that as a whole the dialogue of a Brandes play is good (that is, the division of the dialogue and the pro- gression of material therein), but at the "technical" level (immediate ex- change), the dialogue is deficient.29 Denis Diderot points out that the most effective dramatic dialogue in the form of immediate give-and-take will probe issues and ideas central to a play: "The reply [in dialogue] does not attach to the last words of the speaker; it relates to the content, the heart of the matter."30 And Jean Marmontel, like Diderot, explains that individual instances of dramatic dialogue must function in a wider con- text as well, contributing directly and effectively to the advancement of the plot. Thus, "each reply [in dialogue] would be to the scene what the scene is to the act"-in other words, functioning in a long-range context (advancing the plot) in addition to an immediate one.31 Since we have observed a general theoretical similarity between the components of dramatic dialogue and concerto dialogue we are justi- fied in looking for further clues to the interactive behavior between con- certo characters in dramatic theory. Late-eighteenth-century dramatists are explicit in their admiration for carefully executed confrontation, for example. While for Diderot the direct, outright opposition of characters can lead only to an unproductive "string of little ideas and antitheses" (un tissu de petites iddes, d'antithises),32 the ebb and flow of effective dia- logue relies on characters simultaneously confronting and holding off each other. Of Corneille's dramatic dialogue, Diderot writes: "This infi- nitely difficult art of dramatic dialogue has perhaps not been mastered by anyone to the same extent as by Corneille. His characters press one an- other without concessions; they strike blows and ward them off at the same time; it is a struggle."33 Joseph de Laporte strikes a very similar note in the Dictionnaire Dramatique of 1776 in his article on dramatic dia- logue: "It is not natural that, in the midst of violent conflicts of interest which arouse all the characters, they should give themselves, as it were, the luxury of haranguing one another. It should be a battle of feelings between them-feelings which clash, repel one another, or triumph over one another. It is above all in this game that Corneille is superior."34</page><page sequence="6">174 The Musical Quarterly Louis Sdbastien Mercier, in Du Thil.tre of 1773, also considers con- frontation essential to dramatic dialogue. The characters should be, he points out, "by turns conquering, by turns conquered . . . always in an eternal struggle."35 While critics such as Diderot, Laporte, and Mercier admired con- frontation, it is highly unlikely that they would have recommended sus- taining it through every moment of a play. (After all, dramatic dialogues in classical plays come in all varieties, ranging from the blatantly con- frontational to the completely amicable and collaborative.) Laporte's example of effective dramatic dialogue-one of Oedipus's pivotal en- counters with Jocasta in Voltaire's Oedipe-illustrates that dialogic con- frontation is especially suited to projecting moments of great relational intensity: Oedipus: I killed your husband Jocasta: But you are mine. Oedipus: I am yours by virtue of a crime Jocasta: It was involuntary. Oedipus: Nevertheless, it was committed. Jocasta: Oh, woe of woes! Oedipus: Oh, wedlock all too fatal! Oh love that once burned so fiercely! Jocasta: It is not extinguished; you are my husband. Oedipus: No, I am no longer your husband &amp;C.36 Laporte explains that these lines are especially effective because they are "like fencing thrusts, given and warded off at the same time."37 The dialogic technique used by Voltaire in Laporte's example is sti- chomythia, a confrontational style originating with the Greek tragedians. It has been defined in the Shorter Oxford Dictionary as "dialogue in alter- nate lines, employed in sharp disputation, and characterized by anti- thesis and rhetorical repetition or taking up of opponent's words."38 Goethe also used this dialogic technique at moments of great intensity in his early classical plays Iphigenie (1787) and Torquato Tasso (1790). In Tasso, for example, stichomythia appears immediately before Antonio's and Tasso's crucial altercation (the end of act 2, scene 3, lines 1393- 1406),39 and at the moment at which the Princess and Leonora disagree on whether Tasso should be sent away to Florence as a punishment for his violent behavior (act 3, scene 2, lines 1728-40); in Iphigenie, it sur- faces when Pylades and Iphigenie argue over their escape from Tauris (act 4, lines 1643-53). In every case, "disputation," "repetition," and the "taking up of opponent's words" is evident. Although interactive behavior between characters in musical dia- logue is explained by music theorists less clearly than interactive behav-</page><page sequence="7">Mozart's Viennese Piano Concertos 175 ior between characters in dramatic dialogue is explained by dramatists, musical dialogue is at least considered capable, like its dramatic counter- part, of embodying competitive as well as cooperative motivation. In ad- dition to Kollmann's insinuation that competition could be worked into dialogue in the concerto, J. J. de Momigny compares the fugue to "a very animated debate between two lawyers who, through their logic and elo- quence try to conquer each other, and who sometimes interrupt each other."40 Momigny's further comparison of fugal entries and "thrusts" (bottes) in fencing-the two participants "come close to each other, pur- sue each other and follow each other"41-as well as Reicha's explanation of confrontational dialogue in music-"the responding phrases are of an opposed character to that of their opening phrases: it is a continual con- trast"42-may be indebted to Diderot's, Mercier's, and Laporte's descrip- tions of confrontational dramatic dialogue; in any case, Momigny char- acterizes fugal entries in a manner identical to that in which Laporte characterizes Voltaire's dramatic dialogue (that is, as fencing "thrusts"). Also, likening the duet genre to a conversation, Momigny suggests that the "true" (vrai) duet can display either cooperation or competition: "the two parties are like two friends who are conversing or two adversaries who are fighting."43 Not all critics recognized confrontation in musical dialogue, how- ever, just as theoretical notions of confrontational dramatic dialogue did not always inform practice. The music dictionary writers S6bastien de Brossard, James Grassineau, Jean-Jacques Rousseau, J. J. O. de Meude- Monpas, and H. W. Pilkington, for example, give no indication that dia- logic "responses," "answers," and "alternations" are anything but cooper- ative;44 Nikolaus Forkel's account of a fugal dialogue in the Allgemeine Theorie involves voices "concording" with one another;45 Charles Avi- son, likening his own sonatas to "a Conversation among friends," states that the interlocutors "are of one Mind and Propose their mutual Senti- ments";46 and Koch's "passionate dialogue between the concerto player and the accompanying orchestra" incorporates only cooperative con- cepts such as "approval," "acceptance," "commiseration," and "comfort."47 A study of dialogic interaction in Mozart's concertos, there- fore, must account for both competitive and cooperative behavioral types. 2 The important analytical question that must now be addressed is whether in practice piano-orchestra dialogue in Mozart's concertos is attuned to the theoretical understandings of musical and dramatic</page><page sequence="8">176 The Musical Quarterly dialogue described above. As we established earlier, there is a long tradi- tion of considering piano-orchestra competition (with related notions of confrontation, conflict, and struggle) as a fundamentally dramatic characteristic of Mozart's concertos. But the dramatic credentials of Mozart's concertos can be strengthened and refined both by linking late-eighteenth-century theoretical discussions of dialogic interaction to examples of dialogue in Mozart's concertos and by connecting dialogic processes in Mozart's concertos to dialogic processes in contemporary spoken plays.4" Because of the large volume of dialogue in which members of the orchestra engage independently of the piano and in which the piano en- gages with separate instruments of the orchestra, we shall regard the strings and woodwinds in Mozart's concertos as separate interlocutors.49 It is important to note, however, that there are very few indications in Mozart's concertos that the strings and woodwinds partake in anything but completely cooperative exchange with each other. As we shall see, relational tensions, when they do arise, are a product of the piano's be- havior toward the entire accompanying orchestra (rather than simply iso- lated segments thereof). For the purposes of detecting cooperation and competition, therefore, we shall regard Mozart's piano and orchestra as separate, indivisible entities. Let us begin our analysis with one of the most succinct and power- ful piano-orchestra dialogues in all of Mozart's piano concertos: the dia- logue at the beginning of the development section from the first move- ment of no. 22 in E-flat Major, K. 482 (Ex. 1, mm. 214-22). The piano begins with "little imitations," the third of Reicha's four types of dia- logue quoted above, of the violin's closing gesture from mm. 214-15 (in mm. 216-18). The three-note stepwise ascent is then passed between the piano and the woodwinds and the piano and the full orchestra (mm. 218-22), each three-note segment cadencing in a new key (B-flat minor, D-flat major, F minor, A-flat major, and C minor, respectively). The full orchestra, with its emphatic final segment (marked forte), usurps the piano by putting an authoritative-and to all intents and purposes unanswerable-stamp on the dialogue. Measures 214-22 can be considered analogous to stichomythia, the confrontational style of dialogue outlined above. The piano initiates dia- logue by taking up the orchestra's "words" (mm. 214-17); the piano and the orchestra alternate a short segment; the two parties apparently dis- agree on where the dialogue should lead (each segment cadences in a different key); and the orchestra is openly confrontational in its decisive and imposing final contribution (the C-minor cadence in mm. 221-22). In addition to specific technical parallels with stichomythia, Mozart's piano-orchestra dialogue in mm. 214-22 of the first movement</page><page sequence="9">[ S Si t~ ._. - - -S1, - , F _ 4.-- -, ' LLW" 1 flL</page><page sequence="10">178 The Musical Quarterly of K. 482 functions in its wider context in a somewhat similar way to a stichomythia dialogue. Just as the dialogues in Voltaire's Oedipe and in Goethe's Iphigenie and Tasso, cited above, are pivotal in terms of plot development and relations between characters, so Mozart's dialogue in this movement marks a crucial and decisive moment in the interaction between the piano and the orchestra. The confrontational style of dialogue at the beginning of the devel- opment section of the first movement of K. 482 is in large part a product of the unsettled piano-orchestra relations in the solo exposition. The two parties in the solo exposition, it seems, are on different wavelengths. For example, the piano alone carries out the crucial, initial phase of the first modulation to the dominant (mm. 114-18), the return modulation to the dominant (mm. 149-51) following an interlude in B-flat minor, and also the presentation of all new thematic material; the orchestra in- volves itself neither in the modulatory processes nor in the exposition of significant material. In addition, the piano restates none of the orches- tra's themes from the orchestral exposition. Two specific moments, fur- thermore, seem to reveal competitive rather than cooperative inclina- tions on the part of the piano and the orchestra. First, the two parties are not synchronized at the piano's entry, the piano sacrificing precise align- ment with the orchestra for increased forward momentum. The E-flat4- D4 (I-V) motion of the piano's first phrase (mm. 77-80), for example, demands the resolution D4-E-flat4 (V-I). The D4, however, is prolonged through an interrupted cadence (V-vi, m. 84) and then resolved an oc- tave too low (V-I, m. 94). The E-flat4 is finally heard six measures later (min. 100). Above all, the D4-E-flat4 resolution does not coincide with the beginning of the tutti (m. 94); the goal lies beyond it. Second, in a pseudo-dialogue with the orchestra marked forte (mm. 128-29, Ex. 2), the piano blatantly contradicts the orchestra's two-measure affirmation of the dominant (mm. 126-27) by abruptly moving to the dominant minor. Just as the piano advocates forward momentum at the start of the solo exposition by delaying resolution in the correct register, it does the same in mm. 128-29 by abruptly shifting the mode. While the confrontational dialogue at the opening of the develop- ment-especially the orchestra's final emphatic remark-is a product of relational tension in the preceding solo exposition, the dialogue itself also begins the process of resolving relational tension. The piano, for ex- ample, reveals-merely by engaging in its first genuine dialogue with the orchestra in the movement-that it is no longer oblivious to material presented by the orchestra. In addition, the orchestra resolutely discards the passive role it had adopted in the orchestral exposition, taking part in the thematic and modulatory processes from which it was absent in</page><page sequence="11">Mozart's Viennese Piano Concertos 179 126 f Bn. -_,_.________- , f Pno. f Vn. I f I l p Example 2. Mozart, Piano concerto K. 482, 1st movement, mm. 126-29 the previous section. Following the dialogue of mm. 214-22, the orches- tra assumes an integrated thematic and tonal role in the development section: ascending and descending arpeggios are dialogued between the strings and the woodwinds (mm. 224-47), and the piano and the or- chestra prepare together for the A-flat tonality of the new theme in m. 248 by both presenting a half-step descending bass line (A-flat-E-flat, mm. 236-47). The remaining relational tensions from the solo exposition are re- solved over the course of the recapitulation. The piano, for example, no longer propels itself beyond the onset of the main theme at the begin- ning of the recapitulation by delaying the "correct" resolution to E-flat. The B-flat minor passage from the solo exposition (mm. 128-51) is also omitted: the piano no longer diverts the music into the minor without, as it were, the orchestra's consent. Correspondingly, the three-measure preparation for the secondary theme in the solo exposition (mm. 152ff.), one of the piano's assertions of modulatory superiority (B-flat minor- B-flat), is also omitted. Now, the piano and the orchestra together re- confirm E-flat (mm. 329-30) in preparation for the reappearance of the secondary theme (m. 330). Above all, the piano and the orchestra demonstrate mutual cooperation by finally engaging in three instances of</page><page sequence="12">180 The Musical Quarterly dialogue that avoid the competitive edge of the dialogue from the begin- ning of the development section. First, the piano and the woodwinds exchange the full theme from m. 13 (Reicha's first type of dialogue) in mm. 276-92; second, the piano imitates the orchestra's three-note clos- ing gesture from mm. 308-9 (mm. 309-10); third, the piano and the full orchestra alternately present the theme from m. 51 (mm. 314-30). The defining moment in the shift from competitive piano-orchestra relations in the solo exposition to cooperative relations in the recapitu- lation is the dialogue at the beginning of the development section. This dialogue must be considered dramatic not only by virtue of its analogies with stichomythia but also more generally because it injects dynamic re- lational change into the process of piano-orchestra interaction. At one and the same time, the succinct and potent dialogue embodies existing relational tensions and presents the beginnings of a resolution to these tensions. The dramatic significance of dialogue in the first movement of K. 482-comprising, above all, its crucial role in mm. 214-22 as a pivot be- tween competitive and cooperative relations-encourages us to investi- gate dialogue's dramatic function in other Mozart concertos. To be sure, decisive dialogue will not always invite specific parallels with dramatic devices such as stichomythia. As this movement demonstrates, however, dialogue emphasizes both crucial shifts in piano-orchestra relations and also carefully planned processes of exchange. The development section of the first movement of Mozart's Piano Concerto no. 15 in B-flat Major begins, like the corresponding section of the first movement of K. 482, with the first genuine piano-orchestra dialogue of the movement (see Ex. 3). While the dialogue, consisting of the piano's imitation (and elaboration) of a two-measure figure in the orchestra, does not feature an audibly authoritative gesture as in mm. 221-22 of K. 482, it does have a competitive edge. By situating this dia- logue in the context of piano-orchestra exchanges from the solo exposi- tion, we will see clearly why this is the case. The piano's entry at the beginning of the solo exposition of the first movement of K. 450 immediately suggests uneasy relations between the piano and the orchestra. After an initial rapid, scalar descent, the piano begins an eight-measure buildup to the return of the main theme in m. 71 (see Ex. 4). This buildup loses steam for three reasons. First and most important, the piano states predominantly tonic harmony in its eight- measure buildup (exclusively tonic in mm. 67-70). This not only lends a harmonically static quality to the music, uncharacteristic of the move- ment thus far, but also--by virtue of being exclusively tonic rather than, say, dominant-nullifies any sense of harmonic expectation (in the</page><page sequence="13">Mozart's Viennese Piano Concertos 181 150 ________ Ob. ~rf Vn.1 " 154.. Ob. '1 Pno. Example 3. Mozart, Piano concerto K. 450, 1st movement, mm. 150-56 buildup) or harmonic arrival (at the restatement of the main theme beginning in m. 71). Second, the piano gradually ascends, peaking in m. 68. As soon as the high point is reached, however, the piano has to recede (mm. 68-70) so as to accommodate the restatement of the main theme. The registral climax, then, leads to nothing. Third, the two pauses in the piano in m. 70 (brief cadenzas are often added by perform- ers here) establish once and for all that the return of the main theme will not be perceived as the focal point of the piano's virtuosic elabora- tions.50 In short, the piano's entry in the first movement of K. 450 disrupts a musical flow that had certainly not been endangered by the orchestra in the orchestral exposition. To be sure, the piano's tonic pedals and the gradual, stepwise ascents from the piano's entry are also evident in the orchestral exposition;51 in fact, the piano writing in mm. 63-68 might</page><page sequence="14">182 The Musical Quarterly 63 -r--: , b , 65 , ,l .. i C 67 " - A,, . _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ 7~ 69 )6I _ 1-5 , "" = .... ., {/ -.,. .ij E I P ...

But the piano far exceeds any- thing found in the orchestral exposition, standing aloof from the orches- tra both in the type of music it performs and in the harmonic stagnancy and absence of directional thrust that the writing brings with it. The lack of piano-orchestra dialogue-both in the eight-measure buildup and subsequently in the first period of the restatement of the main theme (mm. 71-78, exquisitely split between the woodwinds and strings in mm. 1-8 and an example of Reicha's second type of dialogue)-may not, in itself, be a sign that cooperation between the piano and the orchestra is missing. Nevertheless, the fact that the passages in question also expose strong dissimilarities in the piano and orchestral writing reinforces the impression that, at this juncture at least, the piano and the orchestra are not exactly seeing eye to eye.52 Following the piano's flamboyant entry and monopolization of the first eight measures of the main theme, the uneasy piano-orchestra rela- tions come to a head. Admittedly, the piano and woodwinds in mm. 78- 80 follow a pattern established by the strings and woodwinds in the or- chestral exposition (mm. 8-10) in subjecting an ascending half-step scale and descending sixteenth notes to a kind of split-theme dialogue. But the dialogue does not initiate cooperative exchange. Instead of ad- hering to the orchestra's cadential pattern from mm. 13-14 of the or- chestral exposition, the piano at the corresponding point in the solo exposition anchors itself on B-flat root-position harmony for two full measures (mm. 83-84, Ex. 5). Just as the piano's preparation for the re- turn of the main theme (mm. 63-70 in Ex. 4) gets stuck on B-flat and is accompanied by virtuosic flourishes and an indecisive registral ascent that have nowhere to go, so mm. 83-84 stagnate on B-flat and offer scalar flourishes (very similar to mm. 67-68) that reach a peak and then descend anticlimactically. The piano's reconfirmation of the tonic (mm. 85-86) is greeted with disdain by the strings, which directly confront the piano's behavior by effecting a loud and abrupt shift to G-minor harmony for the beginning of the transition. While the piano seems content, then, to dwell on B-flat harmony, the orchestra is evidently eager to move the harmony along. It is striking that, in addition to the moments of relational tension described above, none of the principal themes treated in dialogue be- tween the woodwinds and the strings in the orchestral exposition of K. 450 (Exx. 6, 7, and 8) return in dialogue between the piano and the or- chestra in the solo exposition."53 The shift in attitude toward dialogue between the orchestral and solo expositions is accentuated by the ex- quisite way in which the string and woodwind interlocutors are balanced</page><page sequence="16">184 The Musical Quarterly 83 .$ .

Appropriately, in the third dialogue (Ex. 8), which the woodwinds initiate, the strings and wood- winds "come together" (mm. 57-58) just as eighteenth-century diction- ary writers on musical dialogue such as Rousseau, Meude-Monpas, Grassineau, and Pilkington advocate.54 The piano-orchestra dialogue at the beginning of the development section of K. 450 (Ex. 3) therefore occurs in the context of uneasy ex- changes between the piano and the orchestra in the solo exposition, in which dialogue is conspicuous by its absence. That the piano is at last willing to engage in dialogue of any kind is a sign that relations with the orchestra are improving. In addition, a specific relational tension from the solo exposition is resolved.

While the initial exchange between the orchestra and the pi- ano at the end of the orchestral exposition going into the beginning of the solo exposition involves no dialogue and leads to an uncomfortable harmonic stasis, the corresponding dialogic exchange at the end of the solo exposition going into the development features the requisite tonal movement. In short, dialogue appears to have "corrected" an earlier "flaw" (the piano's harmonic stasis), one that had lent considerable ten- sion to piano-orchestra relations.</page><page sequence="18">186 The Musical Quarterly 53 Ob.

Mozart, Piano concerto K. 450, 1st movement, mm. 53-59 We must not overlook, however, a competitive edge to the dia- logue at the beginning of the development section. Reicha proposes sud- den changes in dialogue from a major to a parallel minor key as an effec- tive way of accentuating contrast between interlocutors;55 indeed, the piano's answer moves immediately from the orchestra's key of F major to F minor. In addition, the piano disguises the dialogued phrase to some extent through sixteenth-note elaboration and chromaticization. Thus, the piano's continuation of the kind of intricate, ornate, and individual- istic music that helps to create relational tension between the piano and the orchestra at the beginning of the solo exposition coexists with an ex- change that begins at least to resolve this tension. Just as at the opening of the development section in the first movement of K. 482, dialogue at the corresponding moment in the first movement of K. 450 demon- strates at one and the same time relational tension and partial resolution of that tension. If the opening of the development section initiates dialogue be- tween the piano and the orchestra and combines competition and coop- eration, the end of the development moving into the recapitulation (mm. 189-204, Ex. 9) continues the dialogue, but now with fully coop- erating parties.

Another source of relational tension from the solo exposition is also re- solved. The dialogue between the strings and the piano (mm. 190-96) before the onset of the recapitulation includes a six-measure pedal on F in the piano (mm. 189-94). In its earlier incarnation immediately before the return of the main theme in the solo exposition, a piano pedal had contributed to the unsettling harmonic stasis. Here, however, the pedal heightens the sense of harmonic anticipation (by virtue of its placement on F, in the context of an eight-measure dominant buildup). It conse- quently emphasizes, rather than detracts from, the return of the main theme (m. 197). Three-way dialogue resurfaces in the recapitulation at mm. 249-64 (Ex. 10), reinforcing the air of graceful cooperation established at the end of the development and the beginning of the recapitulation. Here we encounter the final strings-woodwinds theme from the orchestral ex- position yet to reappear in dialogue. Not only is the theme split between the strings and piano and then passed to the woodwinds, but the piano pedal, now fully assimilated as a cooperative element, also returns in its anticipatory role (mm. 250-52, predicting the piano's contribution to the dialogue).56 Piano-orchestra relations alter over the course of K. 450 and K. 482 in very similar fashions. (This is striking because the sources of piano- orchestra tension in the solo expositions of the two movements are very different: in K. 450, the piano advocates harmonic and tonal stagnancy and the orchestra, forward propulsion; in K. 482, the reverse is true.) Both movements follow a broad trajectory from competition in the solo exposition to full cooperation in the recapitulation; both combine coop- eration and competition in a dramatic dialogue at the beginning of the development; and both utilize this dialogue as a crucial pivot between competitive and cooperative motivations. Above all, dialogue between the piano and the orchestra underscores a carefully crafted process of re- lational change. As we have seen above, Koch and the late-eighteenth- century dramatic theorists readily recognized dialogue's ability to func- tion in both an immediate and a processive capacity. There can be no better practical illustrations of this than K. 450 and K. 482. Not all of Mozart's first movements, however, follow the competi- tion-to-cooperation trajectory exemplified by those of K. 482 and K. 450.57 Yet many others exhibit the kind of intense relation-defining dramatic dialogue characteristic of these two movements, and situate it, moreover, in the context of taut and coherent dialogic processes.

Mozart, Piano concerto K. 450, 1st movement, mm. 248-60</page><page sequence="22">190 The Musical Quarterly order to show how this is the case, let us consider the powerful dramatic dialogue in the first movement of K. 449, a movement that does not fol- low a competition-to-cooperation trajectory but nonetheless uses dia- logue to underscore dynamic relational change. The beginning of the recapitulation of the first movement of K. 449 (see Ex. 11), like the beginnings of the development sections of the first movements of K. 450 and K. 482, marks a decisive moment in the relationship between the piano and the orchestra. The dominant is es- tablished (m. 219) in adequate time for K. 449's recapitulation (m. 234) and is then colored by inflections to the minor (see the G-flats and D- flats in mm. 223-29). Drawing upon the modal ambiguity of the previ- ous measures, the piano ascends chromatically in all three lines (mm. 230-33), leading directly to the return of the main theme in the tonic (m. 234). This effect is jarring: the piano not only leaves the modal am- biguity of mm. 223-29 unresolved in mm. 230-33, but also, by virtue of its chromatic movement, embodies an indecisive harmonic progression (bVI-IV6-bVII-V6) that lends the music neither the clear dominant preparation nor the harmonic propulsion expected at this juncture of the movement.5" The arrival of the main theme is extremely abrupt, the orchestra asserting tonal stability in a manner that forcefully breaks the piano's chromatic ascent and suggests conflict with the soloist. The piano-orchestra conflict, however, is swiftly and succinctly re- solved by a remarkably ingenious dialogue. The half-step motion in the piano (mm. 230-33), forcefully interrupted by the full orchestra (m. 234), immediately reappears in the following measures (242-43). The piano, taking its cue directly from the final measure of its first half-step ascent (m. 233), starts half-step ascents in all three voices on B-flat, D, and F (mm. 242-43, beat 2). The piano's ascent in m. 242 through the second beat of m. 243 forms part of a split-theme dialogue with the strings (the first time in the movement that the main theme has been treated in this way). The formerly disruptive half-step ascent is, there- fore, instantly assimilated as a cooperative element. Collaboration be- tween the piano and the orchestra is reestablished in one brilliant and uncannily lucid moment of dialogue. Although the harmonic rupture at the moment of recapitulation in K. 449 is resolved in an extraordinary fashion a few measures later, the rupture radiates beyond its immediate confines. In mm. 319-20, shortly before the cadenza (see Ex. 12), there is a similarly abrasive harmonic confrontation between the orchestra and the piano: the orchestra vio- lently interrupts the piano's final cadential trill, thrusting the music into C minor. Here, the orchestra's intrusion is not only harmonically but also dynamically and thematically confrontational: its sudden, forceful</page><page sequence="23">Mozart's Viennese Piano Concertos 191 226 Pno.

Resolution of this conflict is swift and every bit as ingenious as the resolution of the earlier conflict at the beginning of the recapitulation. First, the orchestra, which was responsible for the harmonic disturbance, resolves the con- flict with an emphatic reconfirmation of the tonic, E-flat (IV-V6/V-I6 [mm. 324-28], Ex. 13), using a progression that incorporates an ostenta- tious half-step ascent in the cellos and basses, A-flat (mm. 324-25)- A-natural (mm. 326-27)-B-flat (m. 328). While this type of ascent is of course common immediately before a Mozart cadenza, it is imbued here with considerable significance: the half-step ascent, formerly a cata- lyst for piano-orchestra confrontation at an important structural junc- ture (the end of the development going into the recapitulation), now re- turns in a reconciliatory role at another pivotal structural moment (the preparation for the piano cadenza, Ex. 13).59 Second, the thematic con- flict brought about by mm. 319-20 is resolved by the dialoguing of the arpeggiated sixteenth-note figure between the first violin (mm. 320-26) and the piano (the very opening of the cadenza, Ex. 13).60 Just as at the beginning of the recapitulation, dialogue emphasizes in a concise and di- rect fashion that cooperation between the piano and the orchestra has been reestablished. Measures 319-20 are a moment of intense conflict, but this is not the first occasion in the movement that the material from mm. 16-17 has been at the center of relational tension. The beginning of the devel- opment section, for example, includes an uneasy piano-orchestra ex- change, featuring the rhythm from mm. 16-17 in its very earliest incar- nation (that is, in its m. 3 form). While subtle piano-orchestra dialogue is characteristic of the solo exposition (see, for example, mm. 95-104, 112-17, and 137-46), it disappears at the beginning of the development and is replaced by markedly contrasting material in the piano and the orchestra. The piano begins the section in straightforward dialogue with the orchestra (mm. 176-85),61 but the dialogue does not lead to further collaborative exchange. Initially (mm. 186-87) the piano states arpeg- giated sixteenth notes. In the next sixteen measures (188-204), it simply juxtaposes figuration deriving from the arpeggiations with the orchestra's abrasive, forte presentations of the figure from m. 3. No attempt is made by either party to reintroduce collaborative dialogue. The close coopera- tion of the solo exposition is no longer evident. Piano-orchestra dialogue in the first movement of K. 449-like dia- logue in the first movements of K. 450 and K. 482-is carefully designed to emphasize changes in the behavior of the two parties toward each</page><page sequence="26">194 The Musical Quarterly other over the course of the entire movement. There is a shift in K. 450 and K. 482 from competition in the solo exposition to cooperation in the recapitulation, pivoting around the crucial confrontations (in dra- matic dialogue) at the beginning of the development sections. The first movement of K. 449, on the other hand, moves from cooperation in the solo exposition to competition in the early part of the development sec- tion and back to cooperation, albeit punctuated by moments of competi- tion (resolved to cooperation through dialogue) in the recapitulation. While an individual dialogue such as the one in mm. 214-22 of K. 482 is dramatic by virtue of its similarity to a specific dramatic tech- nique (stichomythia), dialogue in all three works serves a dramatic func- tion as it constitutes an extended formal process stretching across an en- tire movement. As we have seen, each piano-orchestra dialogue is a product of earlier exchanges between the two parties and has a direct bearing on future exchanges. This kind of process is accentuated, more- over, by the extraordinary vitality that dialogues such as mm. 214-22 of K. 482 (Ex. 1), mm. 150ff. of K. 450 (Ex. 3), and mm. 234ff. of K. 449 (Ex. 11) lend to piano-orchestra relations. Mozart's K. 449, 450, and 482 thus offer powerful practical realiza- tions of the late-eighteenth-century theoretical positions outlined above. In accordance with Koch's account, distinct dialogic processes map out broad alterations in the interactive behavior of the piano and orchestra; as eighteenth-century writers on musical dialogue collectively imply, piano-orchestra dialogue is usually cooperative but from time to time competitive; and, as dramatic theorists make clear, confrontational dialogue underscores decisive alterations in relations between characters. It is not surprising, given the connections between theory and practice outlined above, that a further analogy can be drawn between the interaction of dramatic characters in classical plays and the interac- tion of the piano and the orchestra in Mozart's concertos. Diderot and Lessing protest repeatedly against straightforward character oppositions and unexpected and abrupt transformations in relations between charac- ters ("coups de th6stre," in Diderot's words). Both favor a more carefully crafted process whereby differences among characters are gradually re- vealed.62 Mozart, as we have seen, adopts a similar position. He is careful not to oppose directly the piano and the orchestra at the beginning of the solo expositions of the first movements of K. 450 and K. 482 through a "momentary effect" (to quote Diderot). Instead, he reveals only gradu- ally during the piano's initial entry that the piano is on a different wave- length from the orchestra. In addition, sudden and unsubtle changes in relations characteristic of "coups de thd6tre" are shunned in favor of sub- tly graded processes of change.</page><page sequence="27">Mozart's Viennese Piano Concertos 195 3 In light of the practical manifestations in Mozart's piano concertos of theoretical positions espoused by dramatists, we might also identify (albeit somewhat tentatively) parallels between dialogic processes in Mozart's piano concertos and those in late-eighteenth-century classical plays. Two of the most important and influential German classical plays, Goethe's Iphigenie auf Tauris (1787)63 and Lessing's Nathan der Weise (1779), are almost exactly contemporary with the main body of Mozart's Viennese piano concertos, including K. 449, K. 450, and K. 482 (1782- 85). Although neither Goethe's nor Lessing's play was staged in Vienna during Mozart's time--Iphigenie and Nathan received their Viennese pre- mieres in 1800 and 1819, respectively-they seem especially well suited to comparison with Mozart's concertos. Most important for the purposes of examining the dramatic significance of dialogue in Mozart concertos, both Iphigenie and Nathan privilege dialogue over action.64 We noticed in all three of Mozart's first movements discussed above that dialogue directly stimulates changes in relations between the piano and the orchestra. In a similar way, Goethe's Iphigenie offers a famous dramatic realization of dialogue that directly stimulates relational change. As Benjamin Bennett has recently explained, act 2, scene 1 of Iphigenie is dominated by Orestes's "obsessive hypochondriac despair" in which he is unable to communicate. He and Pylades continually talk at cross purposes. After falling into a trance "in which he perfects his withdrawal from reality," Orestes is "[pulled] back into the real world" by dialogue (albeit "totally illusory communication") between Iphigenie and Pylades (act 3, lines 1317-40). Bennett concludes, "[I]f we even imagine ourselves in contact with others, this is already a step toward openness; toward a social rather than an obstinately individual mode of perceiving and acting."65 The same point could be made for the opening of the development sections of the first movements of Mozart's K. 450 and K. 482. The simple act of engaging in dialogue begins the process of replacing the piano's and orchestra's self-absorption with a kind of openness; social exchange thus supersedes individualism. Structural rather than topical parallels can also be drawn between piano-orchestra dialogue in Mozart's three first movements and the two- person dialogues that dominate Lessing's Nathan. For example, differ- ences in the way in which interaction develops in Lessing's act 2, scene 5 (Nathan and the Templar) and act 3, scenes 5-7 (Nathan and the Sultan Saladin)66 are analogous to differences in the way in which inter- action develops in Mozart's K. 450, K. 482, and K. 449. Just as the first movements of K. 450 and K. 482 progress from uneasy competition to</page><page sequence="28">196 The Musical Quarterly full cooperation, so Nathan and the Templar in act 2, scene 5 move from distrust, cynicism, and a reluctance to engage in productive dialogue to solid agreement and very amicable mutual respect.67 In contrast, the dialogue between Nathan and Saladin, like that in the first movement of K. 449, does not contain a striking development in the relations be- tween the two characters; there is, for example, no obvious disagreement between the characters at the beginning. Just as the piano and the or- chestra in the solo exposition of the first movement of K. 449 assume a cooperative relationship but test this cooperation at the beginning and end of the recapitulation, so Saladin believes in Nathan's wisdom at the beginning of their exchange (act 3, scene 5) but subsequently asks him to prove his wisdom on the question of which of the three religions (Ju- daism, Christianity, and Islam) is "true." In the first movement of K. 449, the piano and orchestra meet the self-imposed challenge to their cooper- ation in an emphatic and convincing fashion, thereby strengthening their bond; similarly, in act 3, scene 7 of Lessing's play, Nathan famously recounts the fable of the rings (a metaphor for the absence of one single religious truth) in such a way as to reinforce Saladin's belief in his wis- dom. The parallels I have located between Mozart's concerto dialogue in K. 449, 450, and 482 and dramatic dialogue in Goethe's Iphigenie and Lessing's Nathan are by no means exhaustive; nor should these specific parallels suggest that equally convincing ones cannot be found in other contemporary plays. At the very least, however, correlations such as these provide practical evidence of the dramatic credentials of piano- orchestra interaction in Mozart's concertos. The connections between dialogue in Mozart's concerto movements, in theoretical discussions of dramatic dialogue, and in examples of dramatic dialogue from late-eighteenth-century plays suggest that Mozart's con- certos might have conveyed meaning to their audiences in a somewhat analogous way to contemporary dramatic works. In both theory and practice, Lessing emphasized that audiences must engage closely with the process of development in a play in order to grasp the full signifi- cance of the message (or messages) contained therein. In the Hamburg Dramaturgy, for example, he stresses that Euripides (in his view one of the greatest of all tragedians) "deliberately let his spectators know as much of the coming action as any god might know,... [promising] to awaken their emotions, not so much by that which should occur, as by the mode in which it should occur."68 And from Nathan we can certainly deduce, as many critics have, that the pursuit of truth is just as important as truth itself.69 Similarly, in Mozart's piano concertos it would not have been enough for audiences simply to observe that the piano and the or-</page><page sequence="29">Mozart's Viennese Piano Concertos 197 chestra cooperate or even that they move from competitive to coopera- tive relations over the course of a movement. It would have been essen- tial for them to grasp the full significance of how a state of cooperation is attained (K. 450 and 482) or reinforced (K. 449). They would have to understand, for example, the complex means by which dialogue func- tions as a pivot between competitive and cooperative relations. Only in this way would an audience have comprehended the full dramatic im- pact of movements such as the first movements of K. 449, 450, and 482. When we adopt a late-eighteenth-century dramatic perspective on competition and cooperation in Mozart's piano concertos, we realize that these works challenged their classical audiences far more stringently than has hitherto been acknowledged. Joseph Kerman and Susan McClary have recently proposed that piano-orchestra relations in Mo- zart's piano concertos represent, respectively, "a composite metaphor for Mozart and his audience and their relationship" and a "dramatization" of the tension between an individual and society.70 We can conclude from our investigation of dialogue, however, that works such as the first move- ments of K. 449, K. 450, and K. 482 carried intellectual as well as meta- phorical significance for their late-eighteenth-century listener. Following every stage in the process of relational change in each movement would have been a highly demanding exercise for a contemporary listener; Mozart's concertos would certainly have provided a prime example of the kind of instrumental music that, according to Adam Smith, can "oc- cupy, and as it were fill up completely the whole capacity of the mind, so as to leave no part of its attention vacant for thinking of anything else."71 By engaging his listener in a challenging intellectual pursuit, Mozart offered him or her an excellent vehicle for learning about coop- eration (or, more precisely, the quest for cooperation), a value deeply cherished in the Age of Enlightenment. Mozart's concertos thus fulfilled the single most important requirement for all late-eighteenth-century music and drama: the general instruction of the listener-spectator. In this respect, concertos such as K. 449, K. 450, and K. 482 provided their clas- sical audiences (and indeed continue to provide today's audiences) with a splendid complement to the very best that late-eighteenth-century spoken theater had to offer.

The same cannot be said, of course, for general and specific</page><page sequence="34">202 The Musical Quarterly analogies between Mozart's operas and his concertos. The literature on this subject is vast and focuses, above all, on formal, gestural, and stylistic analogies between the two genres. For the most recent identification of parallels between opera and concerto (or, in Webster's case, the lack thereof), see the essays by Wye Jamison Allanbrook, James Web- ster, Janet M. Levy, and Martha Feldman in Mozart's Piano Concertos, 75-187. Analogies between dialogue in the concerto and dialogue in opera have not yet been pursued. Needless to say, a comprehensive theory of dialogue in opera would need to be estab- lished before comparisons could be drawn between dialogue in the two genres. A theory of dialogue in opera, which lies beyond the scope of the present article, would have to as- similate a complex combination of dialogues: for example, literal dialogue between on- stage characters (in both recitatives and duets); metaphorical dialogue between on- and offstage characters (say, Figaro's "dialogue" with the Count in "Se vuol ballare"); and solo-orchestra dialogue. 49. For a discussion of the prominent role played by the woodwinds in Mozart's concer- tos after K. 450, see Irving R. Eisley, "Mozart's Concertato Orchestra," Mozart-Jahrbuch 1976/77 (Kassel: B~irenreiter, 1978), 9-20. 50. Ellwood Derr argues that "the scheme of making initial solo entries on foreign ma- terial [as in the first movement of K. 450] had apparently been transferred by Mozart into his piano concertos from a practice established for arias.. . namely a fermata for the soloist typically initiated after the completion of the opening ritornello cadence." See "Mozart's Transfer of the Vocal 'fermata sospesa' to His Piano Concerto First Move- ments," in Mozart-Jahrbuch 1991: Bericht viber den internationalen Mozart-Kongress 1991 (Kassel: Blirenreiter, 1992), 155. 51. See, for example, mm. 41-45, which combine an octave melodic ascent (first vio- lin) with a tonic pedal (cello). 52. Other critics have noticed uncertainty at the piano's entry in K. 450. Girdlestone, for example, observes that the "piano entry drives the orchestra into the background," and the orchestra becomes "neither collaborator nor adversary but just accompanist." See Mozart and His Piano Concertos, 199. Denis Forman also points out a kind of indeci- sion on the piano's part. While the "piano introduction [mm. 59-70]" constitutes "a ma- jestic assertion of the key of B flat and fit to stand at the head of the grandest symphonic First Concerto [that is, the solo exposition]," its return to the main theme (mm. 71ff.) is somewhat anticlimactic, marking a moment of "carefully contrived bathos." See Forman, Mozart's Concerto Form: The First Movements of the Piano Concertos (New York: Praeger, 1971), 177-78. 53. As we have seen, there is a brief dialogue in mm. 78-80, corresponding to mm. 8-10, although most of the main theme (mm. 1-8) is not dialogued on its reappearance in the solo exposition (mm. 71-78). 54. See Rousseau, Dictionnaire de Musique, 145; Meude-Monpas, Dictionnaire de Musique, 47; Grassineau, A Musical Dictionary, 55; and Pilkington, A Musical Dictionary, 23-24. 55. See Reicha, Traiti de milodie, 91. 56. We might also draw attention to the dialogue between the strings and woodwinds and the piano immediately before and at the beginning of the cadenza of the first move- ment of K. 450. As I explain in n. 60 below, such dialogue is rare in the cadenzas of the first movements of Mozart's piano concertos.</page><page sequence="35">Mozart's Viennese Piano Concertos 203 57. See Chaps. 3 and 4 of Simon P. Keefe, "Dialogue in the First Movements of Mozart's Viennese Piano Concertos" (Ph.D. diss., Columbia University, 1997), 114-269. 58. To be sure, the piano's chromatic writing in mm. 230-33 (C-flat, C, D-flat, D) could be interpreted simply as filling the gap between the dominant harmony (on B-flat) of m. 226 and the tonic harmony (on E-flat) of m. 234. But this explanation in itself would not do justice to the unusual and peculiar harmonic effect of the four measures immediately preceding the recapitulation. 59. We might also note parenthetically that the half-step ascent beginning on A-flat "rescues" the cellos and basses from completing their "lamento" descent, C-B-flat- A-flat[-G]. 60. It is difficult to generalize about the way in which Mozart begins his first-movement cadenzas, as no cadenzas survive for six of the Viennese concertos-K. 466, K. 467, K. 482, K. 491, K. 503, and K. 537. Of those first movements of Mozart's Viennese piano concertos with extant cadenzas (K. 413, K. 414, K. 449, K. 450, K. 451, K. 453, K. 456, K. 459, K. 488, and K. 595), only K. 449's and K. 450's cadenzas begin with the piano in- stantly dialoguing an immediately preceding orchestral figure. Both the K. 451 cadenza and one of the three surviving cadenzas for K. 456 begin with scalar flourishes and only then dialogue material from the orchestra's previous passage. For brief considerations of Mozart's extant cadenzas, see Christoph Wolff, "Cadenzas and Styles of Improvisation in Mozart's Piano Concertos," in Perspectives on Mozart Performance, ed. R. Larry Todd and Peter Williams (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1991), 228-38, and Frederick Neumann, Ornamentation and Improvisation in Mozart (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1986), chap. 17, "Instrumental Cadenzas." 61. The piano reverses the position of the orchestra's stepwise descent and trill figure, as do the strings in mm. 70-78 of the orchestral exposition. 62. See, for example, Diderot, "Podsie Dramatique," 166, and Gotthold Ephraim Less- ing, Hamburgische Dramaturgie (1769), ed. Otto Mann (Stuttgart: Alfred Krdner, 1958), trans. Helen Zimmern as Hamburg Dramaturgy (New York: Dover, 1962), 221. 63. Goethe wrote a prose version of Iphigenie during February and March of 1779, while living in Weimar. See Cyrus Hamlin and Frank Ryder, "Postscript: Iphigenia in Tauris," in Hamlin and Ryder, Goethe: Verse Plays and Epic, 309. 64. This somewhat obvious but very important point is made by Benjamin Bennett in Modern Drama and German Classicism: Renaissance from Lessing to Brecht (Ithaca: Cornell University Press, 1979), 97. 65.

At the beginning of the dialogue, Nathan remarks, "I am a wealthy Jew," to which the Templar replies nastily, "I never thought the richer Jew the better." Also, the Tem- plar interrupts Nathan forcefully when Nathan tries to explain his purpose: Nathan: My name is Nathan; I'm the maiden's father Whom your great heart delivered from the flames; I come...</page><page sequence="36">204 The Musical Quarterly Templar: Why, if to thank me:-stop! I have Endured already for this trifling thing Too many thanks (48-49). By the end of the dialogue, however, the Templar agrees enthusiastically with Nathan's belief in religious tolerance and exclaims, "Yes, Nathan, yes; we must, we must become good friends" (52). 68. Lessing, Hamburg Dramaturgy, 151. There are, Lessing points out, "hundreds of in- stances when we cannot do better than to tell [the spectator] straight out what is going to occur" (149). Also, in a letter to Nicolai, Lessing emphasizes the processive nature of evoking pity in a spectator, that is, through terror and admiration, lower "rungs" on the "ladder."
