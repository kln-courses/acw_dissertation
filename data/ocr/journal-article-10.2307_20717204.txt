<plain_text><page sequence="1">Mystic Transformation: Julian's Version of the Harrowing of Hell * While in western Europe the Harrowing of (or Descent into) Hell never attained the prominence it did in the East as an image of the redemption, it did foster vivid representations in the visual arts, poetry, and drama of the late Middle Ages. Its major themes-the defeat of Satan and the deliverance of the righteous souls held captive to him through the sin of Adam-are expressed iconographically in Christ's trampling on the devil lying bound at his feet and in his drawing Adam, who with the other righteous souls kneels in supplication, by the right hand out of hell-mouth. The aggressive and at times militaristic vigor of these images stems apparently from their source in coins of the late Roman Empire: there the Emperor is seen stepping on the backs of his defeated foes and raising those "liberated" by his conquest from their knees (Grabar 125-6). For later Christians, the violence of the Harrow ing symbolized the might of Christ's divine power, made all the more strik ing by being frequently juxtaposed with his passive human suffering during the Passion and Crucifixion. One consistently finds this element of violent, often military, conflict in the depictions of the Descent throughout the Mid dle Ages. In the Church liturgy, St. Gregory's Praefatio on Holy Saturday praises "Christ our Lord, who, destroying the confines of hell, took up the glorious cross-standard [vexilla] of victory and, having triumphed over the devil, arose from the dead a conqueror" (Liber iacramentorum 91; translation mine); later the Exsultet of the Easter Vigil states: "This is the night in which Christ broke the chains of death, and ascended conqueror from hell" (Roman Missal 404-5). Origen and Ireneus describe Christ as "wrestling with" death during the Descent (MacCulloch 103,227,230), whereas poets of later warrior cultures depict him in terms of their exemplars of military prowess. Hence the author of the Old English Harrowing of Hell in the Exe * An earlier version of this article was given as a paper entitled "Julian's Fourth Reve lation: The Transformation of the Harrowing of Hell," at the 18th Annual Confer ence of the Southeastern Medieval Association, held at the College of William and Mary, September 25-6, 1992. Mystics Quarterly, Vol. 20 #2, June 1994 60</page><page sequence="2">ter Book portrays Christ as an Anglo-Saxon warrior-king who actually rides into hell to be reunited with his loyal comitatus, the patriarchs and prophets. Later writers such as Langland, Malory, and even Spenser transform Christ into a knight errant who jousts with Satan (or the Seven Deadly Sins) for the soul of man. In the York and Towneley plays on the Descent, Satan arms himself and sets the watch on the ramparts of hell against Christ, even though their later encounter takes the form of a debate, not an armed con flict. In one sense, the Harrowing of Hell helped to literalize, especially for the unlearned, the idea that through his death and descent Christ saved humankind. Its masculine images of victory reassured audiences used to celebrating the power of the male hierarchy that they had been saved, that good ultimately does triumph over evil. In contrast to this more popular art, mystical writings rarely refer to the Descent, and the reasons for this are readily apparent. Some writers, like the author of The Cloud of Unknowing, reject any anthropomorphism in their quest to know God. For others, the violent conflict of the Harrowing, though culminating in Adam's reuniting with God, might seem inappropri ate as the subject of mystical contemplation. The hushed awe at Christ's sac rifice on the cross, albeit the result of violence, is more likely to direct one's thoughts towards union with the Lord. Then, too, in its themes of victory and liberation the Harrowing encompasses the vast scope of salvation his tory by including Adam and Eve as well as the patriarchs and prophets from the ancient and recent past and by making typological allusions to Dooms day. This wide focus is at odds with the intense, personal moment of union with Christ that is the essence of medieval mysticism. Mystical writers most often use events of great human emotion, either joy or suffering, like the Nativity and the Passion to trigger a moment of contemplation. It is surpris ing then that the Harrowing appears, at times prominently, in the fourth and fourteenth revelations of Julian of Norwich's Showings. Significantly, these references occur only in the long text. When examined, they shed much light on her vision of redemption that deepened during twenty intervening years of contemplation. In chapter eight of the short text, Julian graphically depicts Christ's blood streaming from his scourged body in such profusion that it rivals the bounti ful waters that God made for our use on earth, but his blood surpasses these in pleasing God, for it washes away our sins (Showings 227). This descrip tion is preserved in the fourth revelation of the long text, but adds the follow ing explanation of how Christ's blood accomplishes the redemption: Behold and see the virtue of this precious plenty of his dear worthy blood. It descended down into hell and broke her bonds, and delivered them all that 61</page><page sequence="3">were there which belong to the court of heaven. The precious plenty of his dear worthy blood overfloweth all earth, and is ready to wash all creatures of sin which be of good will, have been and shall be. The precious plenty of his dear worthy blood ascendeth up into heaven in the blessed body of our lord Jesu Crist, and there is in him, bleeding, praying for us to the father, and is and shall be as long as us needeth. And over more it floweth in all heaven, enjoying the salvation of all mankind that be there and shall be. (Showings 344-5)1 To be sure, the Harrowing of Hell is only a part of Julian's vision of salvation here, but it does present a paradigm of Christ's direct intervention to save humanity in both the past and the future. The passage provides an almost literalistic explanation-one not given in the short text-of how by Christ's blood "the fiend [is] overcome" (Showings346). Julian's use of the blood of Christ to accomplish the Harrowing is striking and perhaps unique. Through it, she avoids the Exsultefs anthropomorphic image of Christus victor who breaks the chains of hell. More tellingly, while other writers use images of divine might-such as the light dispelling the darkness in the Easter liturgy, the Gospel of Nicodemus, and the Corpus Christi drama-Julian selects one associated with the human physicality, the pain and suffering, of Christ's sacrifice. Edmund Colledge and James Walsh, the editors of Julian's Showings, see a possible source or at least an analogue for this passage in the Stimulus amoris, which describes how Christ's "wounds overcame the fiend's power, and burst the gates of hell" (Showings 344 n. 22). By stressing the blood of salvation rather than the wounds of Christ's suffering, Julian does not limit the associations of blood to the Passion and Crucifixion, but develops them in more untraditional ways throughout her Showings. As previously mentioned, she connects the bounty of Christ's blood with the abundant waters of Creation and reinforces the connection between the creation of mankind, Christ's Incarnation, and the Harrowing of Hell. In her extended fourteenth revelation about the lord and the servant, Julian relies on the traditional idea of Christ as the Second Adam, whose relation ship is ultimately fulfilled during the Descent: When Adam fell God's son fell; for the right onyng (union) which was made in heaven, God's son might not be separate from Adam, for by Adam I under stand all men. Adam fell from life to death, into the slade (vale) of this wretched world, and after that into hell. God's son fell with Adam into the slade of the maiden's womb, which was the fairest daughter of Adam, and that for to excuse Adam from blame in heaven and in earth; and mightily he fetched him out of hell. (Showings 533-4; see also 534 n. 224) 62</page><page sequence="4">This second reference to the Descent emphasizes that part of Christ's work of redemption lay in his taking on human substance, what St. Paul calls his partaking of flesh and blood to defeat the devil.2 Julian's linking of the Incar nation and the Harrowing is traditional and can be found in the Advent lyrics of the Exeter Book, which reveal that at both times Christ the Light comes to dispel the darkness for those sitting in the shadow of death (Burlin 70-7). Julian's unusual emphasis on the physicality of Jesus' birth reveals that it was both a humbling to come into "this wretched world" and a glorifi cation of the flesh: the Incarnation was a "falling" in that "the godhead started from the father into the maiden's womb, falling into the taking of our kind, and in this falling he took great sore. The sore that he took was our flesh, in which as soon he had feeling of deadly pains" (Showings540). On the other hand, by taking on human flesh, Christ incorporated our sensuality within himself, and through this union he perfected human nature and un did Adam's sin: "For in that same time that God knit him to our body in the maiden's womb, he took our sensual soul, in which taking, he us all having beclosed in him, he onyd (united) it to our substance. In which onyng he was perfect man, for Christ, having knit in him all man that shall be saved, is per fect man" (Showings 579-80; emphasis mine). Julian resolves the paradox of the Incarnation as both a diminution and a glorification in the concept of Christ as mother. Just as Christ perfected human nature within the womb of the Virgin, so too we are perfected by our union within Christ. But while Christ had to be born out of the Virgin to accomlish the redemption, our salvation can occur only by remaining within Christ. In this way Julian reverses the pejorative ideas of the flesh and the traditional denigration of women who are associated with the body and spe cifically with the production of flesh in birth. Both these reversals have important implications for Julian's treatment of the Descent. Critics have noted that she seems to associate the suffering on the cross with the pains of childbirth (Heimmel 56; Nuth 67), but Julian goes far beyond this: she transforms the traditional depiction of the Harrow ing as a liberation from prison to one as a birth from our old life of wretched ness into a new spiritual life. By the power of his sacrifice, Christ the mother reforms and restores all his obedient children: "and in our mother of mercy we have our reforming and our restoring, in whom our parts be onyd and all made perfect man .. . and in him and by him we be mightily taken out of hell and out of the wretchedness in earth, and worshipfully brought up into heaven, and blessedfully onyd to our substance" (Showings 587, 588; emphasis mine). As the Incarnation united Christ to our sensuality, so the Harrowing is a birth because by it we are joined in substance to Christ. In a paradox that would delight even a metaphysical poet, we find this new life not by being 63</page><page sequence="5">freed into some limitless universe but by being "confined" within the mysti cal body of Christ our mother (cf. Heimmel 55). Within this context, blood becomes more than an emblem of Christ's vio lent suffering and sacrificial death. It is one of life, the vehicle or substance by which life is given and sustained. Very often in fourteenth-century mysti cal writings, blood is associated with nurturing and specifically with nurs ing. This idea is hardly unique to Julian, but follows a tradition of mystical writers from St. John Chrysostom to St. Bonaventure and Lutgard of Aywieres, to Angela of Foligno and the Monk of Farne, the last a contempo rary of Julian (Heimmel 57f.; Bynum 146f.). In her discussion of Jesus as mother, Carolyn Walker Bynum notes, "In thirteenth- and fourteenth century [mystical] literature, nursing tends to become nursing with blood, not milk" (151). Her words make one recall the allegory of the pelican, which opens its breast and sprinkles blood on its young to revive them, just as Christ revives us spiritually with the blood of salvation (Physiologus 9-10). For Julian, "the flood of mercy" from the water and blood of Christ's wounds is both the medicine to cure us of Adam's sin and the nourishment to sustain us spiritually. Several times in her Showings, Julian counsels her readers not to be impa tient if she does not explain an idea immediately, for she may be reserving that explanation for a later time. Jennifer Heimmel notes how the reechoing of ideas forms a pattern in Julian's work (50). Thus, images like blood assume their full significance only by the end of her work. Seen retrospec tively, the blood of Christ that harrows hell suggests more than the power of mercy that emanates from the sacrifice on the cross. Rather than connoting overwhelming divine might, the blood suggests the nourishment that flows from a mother to the children she nurses and that strengthens them in their new lives. For the souls in hell, the blood of the Descent washes away their sins and, as the fourth revelation describes, raises them "into heaven in the blessed body of our lord Jesu Christ." What may have first been read in the traditional terms of the Descent must now be seen within Julian's context of birth within Jesus our mother. But if one can consider an image retrospectively, one can also see the fourth revelation's paradigm of salvation-that is, the Crucifixion, the Des cent into Hell, and the ascent into heaven-in some of Julian's subsequent discussions of Christ as mother. Besides those already noted, two others rely on this earlier paradigm and especially on the notion of the Harrowing as a birth, even, I would say, where there is no explicit mention of the Descent. Chapter sixty compares Christ's feeding us "with the blessed sacrament" (Showings 597) to a mother suckling her child on milk: "The mother may lay her child tenderly to her breast, but our tender mother Jhesu, he may 64</page><page sequence="6">homely lead us there in party of the godhead and the joys of heaven, with ghostly (spiritual) sureness of endless bliss" (Showings 598). This vision recapitulates the one in the fourth revelation, but whereas the earlier episode presents salvation in christological terms, this one uses the maternal, mysti cal images that Julian has developed in the intervening material. Here Christ our mother sheds his blood (which corresponds to the Crucifixion) to nour ish us so that we may enter into him and the joys of heaven (the Descent and the ascent after the Harrowing). Julian seems to confirm this interpretation almost immediately when she compares this glorification to birth itself: "For though it be that our bodily forthbringing (birth) be but little, low and sim ple in regard of our ghostly forthbringing, yet it is he that doth it in the crea tures by whom that it is done. The kind loving mother that woot (knows) and knoweth the need of her child, she keepeth it full tenderly, as the kind and condition of motherhood will" (Showings 599). What was previously described as a liberation through blood at the Descent here becomes a birth into new spiritual life. Julian is able to transform the traditional image of the Harrow ing in this way because, while she does maintain the hierarchy of spirit and body, she does not denigrate the latter. For her, the flesh does not have the pejorative connotations usual in medieval culture; instead it expresses the quality of the humility in Christ's Incarnation and of the mercy he brings to the human race. Although Julian concentrates her discussion of the motherhood of Christ in chapters fifty-seven through sixty-one of the long text, the ideas associated with it permeate her entire work. This point may seem obvious to scholars of the Showings; less obvious perhaps is how thoroughgoing are the transfor mations that result from the concept of Christ as mother. It is important to remember how traditional and resistant to change was the depiction of the Harrowing by the later Middle Ages. In the West, the iconography of the Descent shows little of the variety given the Anastasis in Byzantine art.3 Even written descriptions tend to follow two main sources, the Gospel of Nicodemus and the Golden Legend, which exerted an enormous influence in western Europe at this time. For Julian to have reshaped the Descent shows the comprehensiveness of her vision of salvation. Finally, Julian's transformation of this image is a radical one. Nowhere in her writing does one find the images of masculine power that normally char acterize the Descent: the breaking of the gates of hell and the aggressiveness of Christ against Satan are certainly at odds with Julian's view. Instead, she subtly feminizes the Harrowing through the figure of Christ as mother by emphasizing his taking on flesh through Mary in order to care for his chil dren. His blood shed in sacrifice then becomes an image not of conquest but of rebirth and nurture. 65</page><page sequence="7">While one can only speculate on Julian's reasons for this approach, they may have something to do with her aversion to the idea of God's wrath and the power of damnation that accompanies it. Significantly, it is in the long text where she skirts heresy by questioning the idea of God's anger: how can a Being who is all love be angry with and destroy what it has lovingly created (cf. Showings Chs. 45-6)? Nowhere does Julian portray God as the tradition ally judgmental patriarch, and she has difficulty in accepting even the Church's doctrine that there are souls condemned to hell (cf. Showings Chs. 32-3). Not surprisingly then, she diverges from other accounts of the Des cent such as Nicodemus's by not describing how Christ confirms the damna tion of the devils and unregenerate human souls-the Cains, Judases, Achi tophels, Dathans, and Abirons. Julian's images of masculine power such as the lord of chapter fifty-one are kindly and are finally subsumed by her vision of Christ as mother that dominates the end of the work. By not explic itly mentioning these figures, Julian may be implying that the Descent extended salvation not just to the righteous but to the human race as a whole past, present, and future. In this way, Julian proposes a vision of redemption that is ultimately more tolerant and universal. Karl Tamburr Sweet Briar College Notes 1. All translations are by the writer. 2. "Since, then, the children share flesh and blood, He Himself shared these things with them, so that by means of His death He might destroy the one who wields the power of death, namely the devil, and set free those who throughout life were held in slavery by the fear of death." Hebrews 2:14-15. 3. On the development of the Descent's iconography into a Byzantine feast image for Easter, see Anna D. Kartsonis, Anastasis: The Making of an Image. In the West, even the illustrations of a mystical text like The Rothschild Canticles -which was in fact addressed to a woman-do not depict the Descent itself. Nevertheless, Jeffrey F. Hamburger, in his book The Rothschild Canticles: Art and Mysticism in Flanders and the Rhineland circa 1300, notes that in one illustration (fig. 12) Christ draws one of the Wise Virgins toward heaven "just as he raises the dead in numerous representations of the Harrowing of HelP (48). For me, Christ's posture here suggests the Descent iconography, but differs from it in that he lifts this soul from behind and does not draw it to him by the right hand as he does Adam. 66</page><page sequence="8">Works Cited Burlin, Robert B.
