His greatest strength as a theorist- his development of concrete applications of experimental psychology to our actual experi- ence of images and visual structure-is ill repre- sented in Gombrich on Art and Psychology, a collection of mostly scholastic essays. When Klaug Lepsky asserts that for Nelson Goodman "there is no difference between the word 'tree' and the picture of a tree, because both denote the real tree in their own way" (p. 34), then even the most sympathetic reader probably will lose all interest in reading further. How can any account that is manifestly untrue be of value? The more accurate essays by Menahem Brinker, lan Gordon, David Topper, Edmond Wright, and B. R. Tilghman, treating Gombrich as if he were a philosopher producing a priori arguments, fail to do justice to Sir Ernst's real concern-experimen- tally verifiable quasi-scientific theorizing. When, by contrast, Goran Sbrbom discusses Greek sculpture as seen from below, Jan Baptist Bedaux deals with realism and idealism from a biological perspective, and Joaqufn Lorda writes on classi- cal architecture, their more valuable contribu- tions capture something of the flavor of Gombrich's own research. It was very instruc- tive, though a little cruel, for the editor of the book, Richard Woodfield, to present Jan Bakos's elaborate speculative discussion of Gombrich's relation to the Vienna School followed by Gom- brich's own brief pungent reply, which identifies basic omissions and errors in Bakos's discussion and proclaims his total lack of interest in "these obsolete intellectual fashions" (p. 260). A lot of effort was needed for Gombrich to extract him- self from such unpromising metaphysical theo- rizing, which was much discussed when he was a student; and so it is unsurprising that he has become highly unsympathetic to these ways of thinking, which he finds politically pernicious. One real heir to Gombrich's concern with visually oriented ways of thinking is James Elkins, whose The Object Stares Back presents a very rich array of examples displaying the complexity and richness of perception and explores their relationship to art historical concerns. Seeing, he notes at the beginning of this dazzling book, is thought to be simple: "We just point our eyes where we want them to go, and gather in what- ever there is to see" (p. 11). In fact it is very hard to understand: "seeing is irrational, inconsistent, and undependable" (p. 11). Looking is an active process; seeming to catch our eye, objects appear to be staring back at us. Standing in a museum, for example, you are aware of the depicted figures, guards, other people in the gallery, and even everyone who has seen the picture, for they all are in the background of your own visual experience. Of course this is an anthropomorphic way of thinking, but only such an account, Elkins implies, can do justice to our actual lived experience of perception. What of course is very much in the back- ground here is Jacques Lacan's speculative account in which vision is described as "a kind of cat's cradle of crossing lines of sight . . . the whole scene ... a kind of trap ... " (p. 70). How is it, Elkins then asks, that an object can seem to stare back? Again, a survey of examples is revealing: I can be seen by another person's eyes, by depicted eyes in a painting, by an ani- mal's eyes, but also by the false eyes on crea- tures like butterflies. "The world is full of eyes, and sight is everywhere" (p. 75). In other, more extreme cases, what we see is felt to be so alarming that this reciprocity breaks down: "three things . . . throw the eyes into so much confusion that they may not be able to see at all: the sun, genitals, and death" (p. 87). What hap- pens in those cases is hard to describe, and so some of Elkins's most ingenious analysis is devoted to pornography and images of execu- tion in which the actual moment of death never quite comes into focus. We organize much of our seeing around the seeing of bodies, he argues, and so "when we are confronted with an unfamiliar object ... we seek a body in it; we try to see something like ourselves . . " (p. 129). So what deserves con- sideration are those extreme experiences in which we view organisms with bodies very unlike ours, wildly distorted bodies shown by painters, and the body's inside as depicted by medical illustrators. "Bodies are woven so deeply and tightly into our thought that we have to work to see how little we would understand without them" (p. 159). We also look to the world for faces, and so it is instructive and useful to see how few facelike features are needed for something to appear to us as a face. Consider monkey faces, spider faces, and deformed chil- dren's faces: "There is a kind of blind despera- tion to our desire to see faces and to read them as expressive of mental states" (p. 192). Elkins concludes with an account of the most obviously frightful form of nonseeing, blindness-both lit- eral blindness and those partial blindnesses in which some things vanish from our visual world. In his happily brief presentation, Elkins covers an immense variety of material, much of it little known to most art historians. Sometimes his materials seem to be included just because they are fascinating for their own sake, whatever their relevance to visual art. His aim, I think, is less to achieve narrative closure than to provide examples that might suggestively be applied in art historical work. Somewhat like Ludwig Wittgenstein in his later philosophy, Elkins in effect leaves it to the reader to discern the "fam- ily resemblances" in his case studies, and to think how to apply them to visual art. This is a good procedure because it encourages active reading. When I used his book as a text, my undergradu- ate students, most of them without sophisticated visual arts training, very much enjoyed respond- ing in personal ways to this account. In the end, no single testable theory emerges; Elkins-in this respect, unlike Gombrich-is interested less in proposing a quasi-scientific account of pictures than in providing the basis for a phenomenology of perception. Erudite, aggressively cheerful (even when dealing with very grim examples), and boldly imaginative, his book is the most original novel approach to theory that has been my pleasure to encounter recently. Thomas Crow's Modern Art in the Com- mon Culture, collecting his essays on the theory and practice of art criticism, offers a frankly par- ART JOURNAL 93</page><page sequence="2">tisan perspective from the viewpoint of the left. Concerned with "the continuing involvement between modernist art and the materials of low or mass culture" (p. 3), Crow is interested in how the political concerns developed in Clement Greenberg's and Meyer Schapiro's early essays can be extended into the present when, he fears, we now have "passed through a period when commerce has displayed the superior intelligence and outrun the theoreticians . . . " (p. 93). Early modernists "repeatedly make unsettling equa- tions between high and low which dislocate the 94 apparently fixed terms of that hierarchy into new and persuasive configurations, thus calling it into question from within" (p. 33). What we can still find in present-day politically critical art-but not in most commercially successful work-is the possibility of continuing this activist role. More exactly, this division between politically critical and merely commercial art can be found even within the work of a single artist; "Warhol, though he grounded his art in the ubiquity of the packaged commodity, produced his most pow- erful work by dramatizing the breakdown of commodity exchange" (p. 51). Nothing is likely to be less productive than prolonged discussion by a reviewer who finds the assumptions of an author he admires absolutely implausible. Because I enjoy Crow's energy, origi- nality, and persistence, I can only report my absolute inability to explain or understand why he makes this obviously futile attempt to divide art- works, or art journals, into those that are good because they are politically critical, and those oth- ers that, lacking that political meaning, are not good. A hopelessly scholastic enterprise, this crude binary opposition seems to me a way of thinking entirely as a product of an old-fashioned Marxist tradition that, when now Marxism as a political system has (for worse or better) disappeared almost entirely from the real world, deserves to be abandoned completely by art critics. Even if it were possible to separate "good" from "not good" art in this way, both kinds of art are still treated in the same way by the market. Recognizing that much ought to be enough to make problematic Crow's basic equation of artistic goodness with the power of being politically critical. When Gombrich reject- ed Hegelian ways of thinking, he persuasively demonstrated-so I thought-that this kind of a priori intellectually unproductive theorizing was obsolete. Obviously I was wrong. How strange is Crow's argumentation! When Warhol depicted Marilyn Monroe, is it real- SUMMER 1997 ly plausible to see him as criticizing the concept of celebrityhood? "By 1965, of course, this episode in his work was largely over... " (p. 65). When later in his career, having become famous, Warhol mass produced portraits, making paintings of his society friends using the same sorts of techniques, is there any genuine reason to think that his goals had changed? Crow's visually sensitive, art historically ingenious essay on Ross Bleckner works hard to show how "advanced painting in the West has left behind a secret, disconnected shadow of a history, a recoverable account of outsiders' predicaments and feelings ... " (p. 127). No doubt there is such a tradition, but how odd that a critic as suspicious as is Crow of the commercial art world would praise Bleckner in these terms in an essay commis- sioned for a catalogue published by the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum. Crow wants "to under- stand how anti-commodity art helped entrench a commercial apparatus of distribution . . . " (p. 81). But is that process in which there is much concern with "insider status and recognition" (p. 81) really so different in kind from that found in Paris in the 18th century, when already in Diderot's Rameau's Nephew we find hustlers who would not be out of place in our art world? Crow's odd blind spot-the only reason- able way I can imagine explaining the obvious oddity, and counterintuitive aspects, of his analysis-is his fantasy that he and his allies are beleaguered critical outsiders. Why, it is natural to ask, would our present academic culture give power to such analysts if their claims were really provocative? Crow calls an early essay by Schapiro reprinted in 1977 in Schapiro's much- discussed book on modernism "little-known" (p. 12), and says that Jeff Wall, who already by 1989 was discussed twice in each of the three leading American journals Artforum, Art in America, and Arts, has "received strikingly little attention in English-language criticism" (p. 151). When Crow holds a chair at Yale University and writes for Artforum, and when the cover blurb for his book comes from Rosalind Krauss, who holds a chair at Columbia University, then the idea that they are outsiders to the culture which they then are in a position to criticize is as implausible as their belief that such famous artists as early Warhol, Bleckner, or Wall can be both commer- cially successful and politically critical. Crow fails, I think, to understand how successful critics like himself inevitably do attract imitators. "Much to the dismay of some estab- lished figures in academia," he says, "the gener- alizing abstraction of high theory was trans- formed into a kind of folk wisdom in the streets of lower Manhattan . . . " (p. 82). Good theoriz- ing attracts popularization, and so in turn inspires criticism; just as nowadays the early writ- ings of Schapiro and Greenberg are, deservedly, both much discussed and criticized; so, soon enough-who would doubt this?-Crow and the other famous critics of his generation will attract the same sort of response, which is only just because they have been highly influential. Just as nowadays John Ruskin's once-so-much- admired moralizing fascinates his biographers, who see in it his period style; similarly-I pre- dict-Crow's successful writing will be of great interest to future cultural historians. If Gombrich defines the standards of tra- ditional visual art, then the twenty-three essay- ists in Critical Terms for Art History, an anthology edited by Robert Nelson and Richard Shiff, describe what now appears to be the emerging methodology of the new art history. I wrote one of the twenty-two essays, so praising this book would seem but to be praising the edi- tors were it not for the fact that in context my account of "Art History" fits very naturally alongside the essays on "Simulacrum," "Narra- tive," and "Gaze." We all write in the accepted fashion of 1990s art history. There is in this book almost always a good balance between exposi- tion of theory and presentation of examples; forced to be relatively brief, the contributors are mostly highly engaging. In her essay "Avant- Garde," Ann Gibson discusses Faith Ringgold's Picasso's Studio (1991), which provides a very economical strategy for turning from an account of early modernism to a discussion of women of non-European descent, who traditionally were thought of as the subjects of art, not the makers. The quasi-official house style of this up- to-date art history theory is determinedly multi- cultural and of course sensitive, thank God, to issues of gender and race. Interested in colonial- ism and primitivism, fascinated by, but skeptical of museums, most of these writers, I suspect, find it very natural to believe that, as Stephen Bann says, "the search for meaning ... is a virtually limitless one, which can be terminated only by the atrophy of the individual subject's desire to know" (p. 87). Explaining in detail the ways in which these writ- ers both accept some of Gombrich's claims and take issue with the political implications of his account of the development of representation would be a most instructive task. If, as seems like-</page><page sequence="3">ly, the next generation of writers about art history is likely to rebel against this so-recent consensus, taking the same critical view of our generally shared point of view that we present-day scholars take of Gombrich, then perhaps a sensitive reader of this good-natured volume will even now be able to predict the future of our discipline. What Critical Terms for Art History pro- vides for graduate students (and advanced undergraduates), Laurie Schneider Adams's Methodologies of Art offers for introductory classes. Her book is a teacher's dream, a far-rang- ing, generously sympathetic, well-illustrated, and very clear survey of contemporary concerns with theory. Students, interested in the debates deal- ing with theory they read about in art journals, want to know about Roland Barthes, Jacques Derrida, and Michel Foucault, but because Amer- ican undergraduates mostly-in my experience- know little about the history of philosophy, they find, not unexpectedly, these authors very diffi- cult. I recall one intelligent student who, finding Foucault as he was presented in her cultural stud- ies class bewildering, understood him much bet- ter, she said, after reading a little Descartes for me. For such students, Adams's clear, accurate introduction will be a godsend. After brief accounts of traditional approaches (formalism and iconography), Adams presents concise discussions of Marxism, feminism, semiotics, and-the approach obvi- ously closest to her heart-psychoanalytic theo- rizing. Most present-day discussions of theory are obscure; many such accounts seem almost deliberately unvisual: what by contrast is most rewarding about Adams's discussion is her capacity to be clear and brief. Perhaps because she herself is a practicing psychoanalyst, she combines a no-nonsense approach toward what can easily seem like implausible ways of thinking with a great gift for providing concise statements about how to resolve seemingly large problems. Marxism, naturally associated, she points out, with Ruskin's moralizing about Turner, appears in many recent attempts to understand how an artist like Rembrandt, for example, "turned contemporary business practice to his own financial advantage" (p. 75). Feminism then is presented using both art depicting women and art by women-Sofonsba Anguisso- la, Judy Chicago, Artemisia Gentileschi, and Georgia O'Keeffe. That account leads naturally to discussion of "the biographical method," which "assumes a direct connection between artists and their art, and . . . takes seriously the notion of authorship" (p. 101). Her discussion of visual biography, in turn, leads to the chapter on challenges to that approach provided by struc- turalism and poststructuralism; here the paint- ings O'Keeffe and some of the other artists discussed earlier are given a revised, semiotic reading. Barthes's account of photography marked the transition point at which his struc- turalism "became a Post-Structuralism, to which some measure of humanism is restored, and of which he undeniably lives as the author" (pp. 159-60). Derrida, she notes in the next chapter, "had no Structuralist stage in the development of his thought" (p. 162). In presenting Derrida's much-discussed account of Schapiro's critique of Martin Heidegger's discussion of Vincent van Gogh's Shoes (1886), she suggests that psycho- analysis provides the best way to understand this debate. Heidegger, Schapiro, and Derrida are concerned with knowing whose shoes these are and whether they be a pair of shoes. "One of the many ironies of Derrida's deconstruction is the fact that both Heidegger and Schapiro cite [Knut] Hamsun . . " (p. 176)-and to under- stand Hamsun, it is very helpful to know that he was apprenticed to a shoemaker by his father, whose brother was also a shoemaker. In the three chapters on psychoanalysis, Adams presents Freud's classic concepts, discusses D. W. Winnicott and Lacan, and illustrates how psychoanalytic analysis may be used to criticize Roger Fry's formalism and Barthes's structuralism. "Fry's apparent attraction to disturbed women and his efforts to find refuge from emotional con- tent in the formal structure of painting" (p. 214), she argues, have their sources in his childhood anxieties. And Barthes's "philosophical death of the Author was . . . based in his early develop- ment" (p. 217). For some time many art historical theorists have tended to think traditional psycho- analytic interpretations old fashioned, rejecting them in favor of deconstructive or poststructuralist accounts. Adams's challenging conceptual move is to argue that psychoanalysis can effectively ques- tion this claim. Here, as elsewhere in her book, her robust commonsensical ways of thinking provide a welcome contrast to the tendency of too many theorists to make obviously implausible claims. Perhaps only someone who has tried to teach these tricky topics will fully appreciate Adams's effortlessly elegant narrative. Without oversimpli- fying in ways that will make philosophers uncom- fortable, Adams shows how these theories can be used. Like Elkins, she writes in a way that opens up space for student discussion. I am aware of no other book that provides as clear an introduction to these concerns with theorizing, which are at the center of so much debate right now. Theory Rules: Art as Theory/Theory and Art contains a number of good essays about feminism and multiculturalism, with particular reference to a Canadian context; and one brief, singularly brilliant contribution by Thierry de Duve, which provides the best account I have ever read about the situation of theorists in art schools. Providing a lucid account of how the theorizing of Gombrich and the other writers of his generation has been replaced now by con- cerns associated with "postmodernism," de Duve offers a cannily wary analysis. Some stu- dents are taught to feel "free to pick and choose from the past at random," others "to parody tra- dition"; "most postmodern artists of both kinds . . are perfect products of art teaching in uni- versities" (p. 47). Because students arrive at col- lege with their minds filled with recycled images, survey courses in art history, de Duve argues, should "with a zest of humour" be "deliberately advertised as package deals in cultural tourism" (p. 54). Anyone who has found how difficult it often can be for present-day students to under- stand Gombrich's ways of thinking will under- stand the wisdom of this suggestion. "Historical awareness is as essential to aesthetics," he writes, "as judgment is essential to art history" (p. 55). What good teaching requires, he then suggests, is sensitivity to these ways in which the entire culture has changed. A careful close reading of these six books provides a very good perspective on the chang- ing ways art historians have understood the roles of theory. At this moment when it is easy for aca- demics to feel pessimistic about the economics of education, the acknowledgment of the energy, originality, and sheer diversity of our intellectual world, as displayed by these authors, may be a source of real optimism. I find the capacity of art historians to innovate in the diverse radical ways presented in these books admirable. If the strength of a discipline is to be measured by its capacity to rethink fundamental issues, then art history is in very good shape indeed.
