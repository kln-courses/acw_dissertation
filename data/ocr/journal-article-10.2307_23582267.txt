<plain_text><page sequence="1">Gregorianum 89, 4 (2008) 868-881 Publish of Perish? Theological Reflections on Ecclesial Understanding Scientists and academics are expected to publish books and articles. That is an essential part of what it means to be an academic. This fact is expressed laconically in the disjunctive: Publish of perish. It also forms an essential part of being a professional theologian; academic promotions and one's own academic reputation are dependent on publications. Indeed, there exists a certain, ubiquitous, more or less explicit, pressure on theolo gians to publish; this becomes a measure of their being theologians. I wish to approach this problem by considering what it might mean to be a theologian. I take it for granted that to be a theologian means to have a certain understanding of the Word of God as communicated in the living Tradition of the church. The question is one of fundamental theology. Fundamental theology is today often approached from the point of view of anthropology, that is, by way of an analysis of the transcendental structures of the human subject: the starting-point for many theologies is the human being in his or her concrete possibilities for knowing and for lov ing. Some theologians locate the distant antecedente of this anthropologi cal turn in the thought of the medieval theologians, such as that of Duns Scotus.1 Whatever the case, it is common in contemporary theology to con sider the human spirit as the proper starting-point for a criticai and sys tematic reflection upon the Word of God. One can also speak today of a «hermeneutical turn». Inspired by philosophers such as Heidegger, Gadamer and Ricoeur, it claims that there is no direct approach to the human spirit and - indeed - no direct approach to God without the necessary mediation of language and of symbols. This point of view is not simply claiming a legitimate place for interpretative techniques as such - for example, in the field of exegesis - but rather mak 1 See W. Pannenberg, Wissenschaftstheorie und Theologie, Frankfurt am Main, 1973.</page><page sequence="2">PUBLISH OF PERISH? 869 ing an even stronger claim, namely that ali theology is of its nature inter pretative, hermeneutical.2 This proposai is quite plausible since, after ali, theology deals almost exclusively with texts. Texts require interpretation because of a certain epistemic distance which always exists between the cultural horizon of the text and that of its recipient. The different cultural and historical horizons must merge - there must be a Horizonten verschmelzung, to use Gadamer's phrase3 - in order that understanding come about. I wish to offer some observations concerning a small number of close ly related questions revolving around the issue of the principal subject of theological understanding. One might phrase the problem as follows: When theological understanding deepens in the Church, what is actually happen ing? The anthropological turn in theology is usually conceived as a «turn to the subject». But one must answer the question: «to which subject?» And - one might further ask - what is its possible relation to the hermeneutical consciousness of the theologian who is faced with the problem of under standing and interpreting the texts of Christian tradition? The Object and Subject ofFaith It is widely believed that in the Dogmatic Constitution on Revelation, Dei Verbum, the fathers gathered at the Second Vatican Council wanted to distance themselves from a propositional conception of faith which tended to reduce faith to a sort of intellectual assent, illumined by grace, to a set of propositions (doctrinal truths or dogmas) proposed by Scripture and Tradition, and proclaimed by the Church. What is it then that the Church transmits if not merely a set of propositions? The Council states that the content of Tradition is - amongst other realities - the Church herself. In Dei Verbum no.8, we read: «the Church, in her doctrine, life and worship, per petuates and transmits to every generation ali thatshe herself is, ali that she believes» [My emphasis]. What every generation of believers receives then is revelation, the Word of God. But this «Word of God» as we are empowered to believe it and hand it on from generation to generation 'is' the Church in its dynamic aspect.4 One can understand this statement of the Council to 2 Within Catholic theology see, for example, CI.

To the formulation of DV 8, Ratzinger comments:</page><page sequence="3">870 PAWEL KAPUSTA the effect that the Word of God in its very communication to mankind con stitutes the Church as the subject which receives and transmits the Word of God. It is in receiving and transmitting that Word, that the Church lives.5 Although we should reject any reduction of faith to intellectual assent to a set of propositions, it is nevertheless true that we can talk of an episte mologica! moment in the act of faith. Personal adherence to God through faith in Jesus Christ involves the whole human person and is not simply intellectual assent. But because it does embrace ali dimensions of human existence, it will necessarily include some sort of knowledge and under standing, for these are a constitutive part of what it means to be human, of what it means to be a potential recipient of revelation.6 From the point of view of theology it is legitimate therefore to speak of a certain 'objective' principle of the knowledge or understanding we have in and through faith, and of the 'subjective' principle of that knowledge. A few comments about the object of faith will not go amiss.7 Ultimately, this object is the Word of God. Inasmuch as it is 'word' it contains knowable content. Inasmuch as Word 'of God' its truth is guaranteed by the fact that it is God who 'speaks' it in and into human history. But, of course, this Word is Jesus Christ, who transcends any merely human word. This Word is evidently not an object as, for example, a table is an object of possible human knowl edge. Nevertheless, this Word is mediated necessarily in and through human words: Scripture, credal formulas, dogmatic pronouncements. Through these human words - which, as I have already mentioned, the theologian studies predominantly as text - we have access through faith to the Word of God. Besides this historical economy of mediation, there is also a sense in which the Word of God is object; ob-iectum, Gegen-stand. It is a reality which is com pletely independent of our own thinking and desiring. It resists our attempts at anthropomorphic reduction, it challenges and calls us.8 Now let us turn our attention to the 'subject' of faith.9 Henri De Lubac, «So wird von da aus schlieKlich als zusammenfassende Formel fur Tradition die Aussage for muliert, sie sei die 'Perpetuierung', die bestandige Fortsetzung und Gegenwartigung alles des sen, was die Kirche ist, alles dessen, was sie glaubt. Tradition wird mit dem Sein und mit dem Glauben der Kirche identifìziert und so definierl» [My emphasis]. 5 On the Church as «Living Tradition» see S. Pié-Ninot, Eclesiologia.

According to De Lubac this was one of the factors which may have contributed to the conception of faith as intellec tual assent to a set of articles. Whatever the case, the primordial Trinitarian structure of the Creed makes manifest the fact that the Church is not an object of faith in the same sense as the Holy Trinity is the object of faith. It is rather the space in which faith in the Trinitarian God is professed. Taking up De Lubac's analysis, we can say that it is the Church which is the primordial sub ject making the profession. We profess our faith - using a term taken front St. Thomas Aquinas - in persona ecclesiae, in the name of the Church, or within that space which constitutes Church as subject of faith.11 Joseph Ratzinger takes up this idea and draws the conclusion that if, indeed, knowledge is a type of conformation of subject to object, then just as the Trinity is communitarian, the subject of faith in the Triune God must also be conformed to a communi tarian ideal.12 This is the Church, «communion of Saints».

But then the question shifts towards the problem of the relation ship between individuai theological understanding and Ecclesial theologi cal understanding. The individuai believer, according to other reflections of Ratzinger, takes on a type of new subject during the event of conversion. This is, according to some exegetes,13 the basic meaning of St. Paul's words in Galatians 2:20: «It is no longer I who live but Christ who lives in me». But this new subject, this Christ who lives through faith in Paul and in everyone who believes is to be understood in the sense of Paul's theology of the Body of Christ or, to borrow a term from St. Augustine, it is the Totus Christus, Christ, Head and Members, who is the new agent, the new 'subject' within the believer.14 This is perhaps not best understood in spatial terms as a Subject-within-a-subject, but as a process by which two historical 'subjects' one individuai, the other collective, mutually enrich each other. The Church contributes towards, and draws strength from, the meritorious agency of the individuai believer. One can say that the Whole Christ grows together with the individuai believer towards eschatological fullness.15 How might this symbiotic relationship between individuai and Church work in the case of theological understanding? Understanding is something we usually attribute to individuals. What can we mean when we say that the 'Church' understands the Word of God? Are we talking about an intellectual act or habitus of some collective subject? Or are we talking about a type of moral summation of individuai Christian understandings during the histo ry of the Church? Then again, are we talking about the understanding pos sessed by the blessed in heaven? Or perhaps we can attribute understand ing only to the definitive magisterial pronouncements of the Church: with in and through these objective mediations the Church understands the Word of God? I suggest that here understanding can most cogently be understood as a type of practical understanding, as a know-'how', rather than as a know-'that', without wishing to exclude the latter. It is know-how which presents itself in the texts of Tradition; it is to that know-how that the 13 On this point, see the exegesis of the Letter to the Galatians offered by Heinrich Schlier, Der Briefan die Galater, Gottingen, 1962, 145-146, 172-174. Ratzinger to a large extent follows Schlier in his understanding of Gal 2:20. See the latter's Wesen und Auftrag der Theologie, Freiburg, 1993, particularly 43-47. 14 S. Pié-Ninot, Eclesiologia, 156. 15 Eph 4:11-13.</page><page sequence="6">PUBLISH OF PERISH? 873 individuai theologian has access. One must remember that living Tradition is one of reception and further transmission of the Gospel message. The texts of Tradition live in every generation of Christians, (and thus in every generation of theologians) who receive them, interpret them and pass them on. This living realises itself in a type of understanding, a know-how. If the theologian knows how to receive the message of the text and transmit it in an act of interpretation and communication, then that text has been under stood, for that is the text's ultimate sense, its essential way of being, its final - ity. That is what the text is 'for'. One should not separate reception too markedly from interpretation.16 A certain interpreting is going on even before there is assiduous, disciplined contact with the text. Receiving the text means being open to it as the Tradition, answering the cali of the text, moving towards it in the intellectu al, volitional and affective dimension which characterises faith. It means being situated within the text's range of action, within its Wirkungsgeschichte. This openness is always situated linguistically, historically and culturally as a set of pre-notions, as articulated anticipation of sense indeed, as an (ini tial and often merely impliciti interpretation often appearing in the form of a question.17 There is always an initial, inchoate pre-receptivity and pre transmissibility, that is, a pre-understanding which characterises the spe dire theological interest with which the text affeets the theologian. If to understand the text is to know how to be receptive to it and to know how to transmit it, pre-understanding occurs even before one has started reading: to pre-understand is to possess initial receptivity and initial capacity to transmit. But this is simply the articulated, linguistic nature of the initial interpretation or question. As implicit articulation, pre-notions and inter est, in their manifold conditioning, are modifiable by linguistic contact with text (which is itself linguistic) precisely inasmuch as they are themselves linguistic. This is what we mean by pre-receptivity. And precisely as linguis tic, they are also transmittable: this is pre-transmissibility.18 These are the conditions for the possibility of any interpretation and communication of textual message. This initial disclosure is modified in a way which is trans mittable in further interpretative contact with the text and leads to a new 16 One can compare here Heidegger's treatment of understanding and interpretation in Beingand Time, New York, 1962,188-195 in which the hermeneutical circle is discussed. In the present passage, I prefer to speak not only of reception (initial interpretation - Auslegungì but also of transmission as constitutive moments of understanding. I hope to make clear why I include transmission in the realisation of understanding in what follows below. 17 H.-G. Gadamer, Wahrheit und Methode, 284-290 (the concept of Wirkungsgeschichte), 351-360 (the concept of questioning). 18 Compare Gadamer's treatment of Sprachlichkeit, Ibid., 367-382.</page><page sequence="7">874 PAWEL KAPUSTA understanding. Every theological contact with the texts of tradition leads to a new know-how which affects how the same text (as well as others) are approached in the future. Church and Text as 'Body' The Church, we are told by Paul, is the Body of Christ. I suggest that 'body' is a centrai category which may help us to discover how the indi viduai theologian is embraced by a more global theological know-how. So far we have talked about the linguistic or verbal structure of text and of understanding. Text, inasmuch as it is part of Tradition, lives in reception and transmission. It is true that ali Christians are membered into the Body of Christ by the action of Christ's Spirit, through hearing the word and receiving baptism. It is not principally this constitutional membership which we are presently considering. The current focus is on the ministry of the theologian and on the way in which the theologian's word of under standing (interpretation and transmission of the Word) is membered into the body of Christian texts. The past is mediated to us principally through texts. In fact, we have a 'body' - a corpus - of text, within the Christian Church. I regard this body of texts as really 'bodily'. Let me attempi to explain why. Firstly, like ali bodies, this body has material dimension. This dimen sion is certainly finite. There is a canon of Scripture and a certain number of other written texts: those written by the Fathers of the Church, the great theologians and saints, liturgical texts, and so on. They are critically edited as inscribed text from various fragments or originals whose manuscripts physically exist. Although we cannot perhaps explicitly identify ali of the texts which participate within the transmission of the Word of God, we can say with confidence that the corpus is finite, because the member-texts were written by finite human beings within a finite human history. Secondly, text is articulated. That is, it is not an amorphous, homoge neous 'lump'. It has a structure which is linguistic. Inner distinctions: letters, words, conceptual unities, lines of thought, traditions within the Tradition.19 From this list of 'articulations' of text, it already follows that I understand the term 'text' as something more than the mere material inscription men "The importance of the idea of'articulation' was suggested to me by my study of this con cepì in St. Augustine. See my Articulating Creation, Articulating Kerygma. A Theological Interpretation of Evangelisation and Genesis Narrative in the Writings of Saint Augustine of Hippo, Frankfurt am Main, 2005, 21-126.</page><page sequence="8">PUBLISH OF PERISH? 875 tioned above, however essential that may be. Just as different limbs and organs articulate the human body and fulfìl different life functions, so this body of texts is interiorly differentiated in a way in which the different parts fulfìl different roles of differing importance for the way the body of text lives through history. The body of texts grows with history and - presumably - can also decline. Moreover, the body has its own consistency, its own com paction. There is not only distinction but continuity. This is, in fact, an essential feature of articulation. Whatever the distinctions introduced by different parts, there remains an essential continuity of sense, which is the sense of the whole body, its 'life'.20 This is why it is vital that a theologian attempt, as far as possible - and this is possible only in collaboration with others - to perceive the whole body of Christian texts, although they be of differing importance. This is the textual mediation of the so-called nexus mysteriorum, the way things fìt together, in the whole of Scripture and in the whole of Tradition, and in both considered together. I would like to suggest that it is through this textual body that the the ologian gains access to the global subject of theological understanding which is the Church, Body of Christ. Let us simply remind ourselves at this stage that receiving and transmitting the Word of God is the basic mode of life of the Church. We shall prescind from the Christological aspects of this Tradition and concentrate on the ecclesiological aspects. Whenever the individuai theologian carries on this activity authentically, there is partici pation in Church. The theologian is affected in a certain way. Contact with the horizon of Christian text - be it Scripture or the Church Fathers, for example - requires an openness to the text in faith, an existential involvement in a hermeneu tical process which may well bring about a fundamental change in the the ologian's pre-understanding which, in its most general terms, is life as lived in faith. The text - as the process of interpretation proceeds - can reveal a different form of life and a different way of thinking. But this life is theolog ical; it will always be one of receiving the Word in the attentive listening of faith, and of transmitting it in written form to others. The meeting of the two life-forms or two linguistically articulated systems leads to a merging of horizons. But this is not yet materially articulated, that is, it is not yet body, until written down. Once it is written down and made manifest, it is body. 20 The comparison between articulations of speech and the human body is presented by Augustine in De quantitate animae 31,62 - 32,68. In this comparison the lettere and syllables of a word correspond to members of a body; its significatici corresponds to the animating soul. See Kapusta, Articulating Creation, 38-39. Instead of'soul', I prefer to speak of'life' since it is not so much a substance I am interested in here as in a process.</page><page sequence="9">876 PAWEL KAPUSTA It is St. Augustine who has some very suggestive ideas in this regard. In his work De catechizandis rudibus, the theologian's kerygmatic proclama tion of the Gospel and its reception in those who listen to him, can make an essential contribution to the theologian's understanding of the essence of Scripture, which is charity, the love of God and of neighbour. Augustine is seeking to offer advice to those who experience a certain difficulty or gen eral lack of enthusiasm in the process of communicating the Gospel. The communication itself is to be understood as belonging to the essence of Scripture, to the self-giving of charity. Augustine writes: For even if the intellect fìnds delight in the purest recesses of the mind, it should also find delight in the understanding of how charity, the more dutiful ly it descends towards that which is lowly, ali the more firmly (robustius) returns inwards.21 A centrai idea of this passage is that selfless transmission of one's inter pretation of Scripture deepens future understanding (in Augstine's termi nology: «more firmly» turning inwards). This is in consonance with the idea we have already expressed, namely, that not only reception and interpreta tion of the Word, but also transmission modifies that know-how which is understanding. Augustine is talking of transmission of a certain kind; trans mission which shapes itself in accordance with the sense of Scripture, the sense of the canonical text. For him this sense is charity, the love of God and of neighbour.22 In a similar manner - but in modified terms -1 claim that in the case of the theologian, the sense of the texts of Tradition is realised in reception and transmission, which must ultimately be conceived as a min istry, a service of charity. If the theologian manages to do this, the text of Tradition actualises its finality which is living charity, living Church.23 Unlike Augustine, however, we are talking of written communication, for it is through text that incorporation into the Church's understanding is symbol ised and actualised. Once Tradition begins to live in the understanding of 21 Augustine, De catechizandis rudibus. 10,15: «sì enim intellectus delectat in penetralibus sincerissimis, hoc edam intelligere delectet, quomodo caritas, quanto officiosius descendit in infi ma, tanto robustius recurrit in intima». 22 This is essentially the res of the Bible. See Book I of Augustine's De doctrina Christiana and the analysis offered by H.J. Sieben, «Die 'res' der Bibel. Eine Analyse von Augustine De doc trina Christiana I-III» in Revue des Études Augustiniennes 21 (1975) 72-90. On p. 89, Sieben affirms in summary : «die eigentliche res, auf die die Auslegung abzielt, ist nicht 'Transzendenz', sondern die gemina caritas dei et proximi (Buch I, xxxvi, 40, 86) auf dem Fundament des Christus totus, caput et corpus». 23 Compare Augustine, De doctrina Christiana 36,40,86: «quisquis igitur scripturas divinas vel quamlibet earum partem intellexisse sibi videtur, ita ut eo intellectu non aedifìcet istam geminam caritatem dei et proximi, nondum intellexit».</page><page sequence="10">PUBLISH OF PERISH? 877 the theologian, the Church which is «living Tradition» of the Word of God is also received and transmitted. For the Word of God - as we have already mentioned - constitutes Church, elects its own people, the principle sub ject of its understanding. We can perhaps see now that every theologian, qua theologian, through contact with the texts of Tradition 'receives' gener ic reception/transmission of the Word of God itself and 'transmits' such generic reception/transmission to others. When this is realised in individ uai believers it is Church, conceived not so much as a collective subject or infra-individual substance, but as a process. This process is actualised and exists only in and through individuai believers, amongst whom we count theologians who in their own systematic and criticai contact with texts «believe with their hearts and profess with their lips» (Cf. Rom 10:9). Except that here we wish to expand the concept of profession beyond the spoken form to include theological writing. The Role ofTheological Writing Why is theological writing important in this context? It is because it ren dere more plausible the particular mode of membering into Church which occurs in the theological ministry. Of course, the theologian can communicate his/her discoveries and insights through spoken discourse and teaching, and I do not deny that this is important. But the concept of textual corpus which we discusseci briefly above, gives written communication a particular signifi cance for our question. For theological understanding to really occur, the the ologian must not only interpret, but also transmit. This means effectively com municate. The most general theological content of this communication is reception and transmission itself, reception and transmission of the Word of Life, which in its most basic essence is ecclesial charity building communion.24 The cruciai point is that, inasmuch as the theologian's text lives in the Church, that is, inspires readers (or hearers) to the giving and receiving involved in faith and love, it is membered into the body of text which is written by, and inspires, the community of believers. The body of Christian text thus grows and is fur ther articulated, and presente symbolically the growth of the Body of Christ. In short, the theological text which our author produces must make textual Tradition accessible and living to others; it must somehow imitate and be grafted into the texts of Tradition and into their finality. The theologian's text is a produci of his interpretation, of the new hori zon that has been synthesised through assiduous contact with text. But, 24 Cf. 1 John 1:1.</page><page sequence="11">878 PAWEL KAPUSTA ultimately, it is only the reception and transmission of the theologian's own text by others which 'bears witness' to his having understood theologically,25 to his having effectively been membered into the Church's understanding. It is only effective transmission (communication) to others of the generic reception/transmission of the Word of God which actualises Ecclesial know-how. If this is missing - if the theologian's text has no positive (that is, charitable) Wirkungsgeschichte of any sort - the theologian doesn't possess the know-how at ali; it is simply not theological or ecclesial understanding in the sense we are using the term. Such effective transmission will be wit nessed to by growth in generic reception/transmission of the Word of God in the recipients of the theologian's text. This means, however, that the the ologian may never know with absolute certainty that he/she has under stood anything of the texts studied, for human individuale cannot infallibly discern the effectiveness of their communication: whether there is real growth in faith and love in the recipients of the text (generic reception/transmission of the Word), or whether it is simply transient feel ing, intellectual fascination, or momentary adulation. It is only when interpretation yields a text, and when that text becomes accessible to, and gracefully (charitably) received by, the People of God that we can speak of real understanding on the part of the theologian qua the ologian. I do not claim that this is the only type of understanding through faith. I have been concerned here rather particularly with the relationship between the individuai understanding of the theologian and ecclesial understanding. But if someone really fulfils a theological ministry, then he or she must be involved in accessible writing. For it is only through the graceful reception of texts into the Body of Christian Tradition that the the ologian can be said to have Ecclesial understanding of the Word of God. What did theAuthor Want to Say? One must stress that the sense of a text is not to be identified with the intention of its author. The concrete modality in which a theologian's text affects its readers may be beyond the most audacious expectations of its author. The reader may, for example, offer an interpretation of the text which the author would find surprising and novel, but whose plausibility cannot be denied and which the reader fìnds particularly suggestive and 25 The emphasis here is to indicate that I am talking of theological, ecclesial understand ing in a strict sense only without wishing to pre-determine the question of other possible forms of understanding.</page><page sequence="12">PUBLISH OF PERISH? 879 fruitful in his or her life as a Christian. We may cali such a sense a sensus ple nior, a sense which may not have been intended but is nevertheless there. Such senses can emerge particularly when a given text is interpreted within the remainder of the textual Tradition; new possible senses emerge from the text and these senses may begin to have a «life of their own» independent of any historical, psychological intentions. But there is another sense which remains constanti the life of the text in the form of its own reception and transmission. This we have called the Ecclesial sense. If this is completely absent, the text is dead; it remains in some place in its mere materiality. But even if it is widely read, it is not conducive to the reception and transmis sion of the Word of Life which is charity. The Ecclesial sense (know-how) of a theological text is truly Catholic: it can make a claim on diverse recipiente in many different cultural contexts. It is not excessively bound to «what the author wanted to say» and «adapts» to the hermeneutical situation of its readers. It lives on because of its perennial fruitfulness. Ecclesial know-how is actualised in and through the text, as its fruits are diffused. This know how becomes manifest within the reception and transmission of a text whose author is an individuai theologian. But it is obviously distinct from the interpretative and communicative know-how (understanding) of the individuai author (or group of authors). The two understandings are dis proportionate in their effects. Ecclesial know-how is not attributable in any exclusive way to an individuai author. And yet the text remains this author's text; it has been marked with his or her understanding. And so it is through the written text that the understanding of the theologian is integrated into Ecclesial understanding. To a certain extent, the text must appeal to the whole Body of the Church if it is to fìnd its place within the corpus of Christian writing. This does not mean, however, that every Christian would have to read such a text and somehow be influenced by it. Being fruitful for the Church cannot sim ply be a quantitative phenomenon. Although this question would require a separate study, I believe the process of such incorporation into the body of Christian text should somehow involve the three instances mentioned in Dei Verbum 8: the study and critique of other theologians, the sensus fideli um of believers based in spiritual experience, and the approvai of those who hold the teaching office in the Church. One apparent peculiarity of this view is that the theologian does not attain understanding until his or her work is received by the people of God in a way which leads to increased immersion in the Word of Life. As I said, this is a difficult thing for anyone to judge, but after some time perhaps one can have a justified hope that our theologian has understood something of the Word of God and has written something of importance for God's People. Such a concepì of understanding is quite different from the common notion of understanding we have, which we generally regard as something</page><page sequence="13">880 PAWEL KAPUSTA which goes on within the individuai mind. In our case, it only begins with in an individuai mind, but perhaps even this is not accurate. It begins when an individuai mind comes into hermeneutical contact with the corpus of Scripture and Tradition and with its Ecclesial sense. If it is authentic, this understanding is never a merely private idea, never merely an individuai insight. Even once such insights or hypothetical understanding is textualised and made manifest to the Church, authentic understanding is confìrmed, and effectively granted, with the charitable reception of that theological text in the Church, a reception which may take years, decades or even centuries to become manifest. It is only with this positive reception that the text of the individuai theologian represents the understanding of the principle subject of theological faith, that is, of the church. Theological understanding of Divine Mystery is thus something collective and communitarian and cannot be reduced to an intellectual event in the individuai mind. Publish or Peristi? The view presented above is not without its problems, of course, but I would like, at the end, to suggest three of its consequences. The first, is that it takes seriously the obscurity of individuai under standing, even in the case of the theologian (sic!), who can never be sure that any understanding of the Divine Mysteries has been attained, but can only at best possess a type of certainty issuing from hope, supported - to a greater of lesser extent - by the charitable reception of his or her texts. The inter-subjective and community-building character of the ministry of the ology is stressed. A second consequence is, I believe, a certain distancing towards con temporary, academic theology as it is often carried out at university facul ties. As I have presented it, theology is a ministry - to be authentic, to be effectively theology - it is not enough for theologians to be intellectually brilliant, impressively erudite, to hold a chair at a university, and to have published hundreds of books and articles. Ali this might help but, on the other hand, may not be sufficient. AH Christians who, from the body of Christian texts, bear forth their own writings which lead to charitable recep tion and communication processes within the People of God are theolo gians. They are not necessarily professional theologians. But they can fulfìl a genuinely theological and ecclesial ministry. The third consequence of the view presented alludes to the title of this article: Publish or perish? It is true that the theologian has to produce acces sibile writings in order to access ecclesial understanding. In that sense the ologians have to publish. Given this obligation, however, one cannot direct - ly quantify this type ofwriting because the ecclesial reception of a text is not</page><page sequence="14">PUBLISH OF PERISH? 881 quantifiable. Theological writing has a certain quality, an Ecclesial quality which is known by its fruits. Conceivably, a single publication of an author can have this quality, or a hundred such publications. The know-how required by the theologian in ecclesial writing is a sapiential type of know how. I suspect that it therefore requires prayer, recollection and works of charity for its full development. Ali that, in turn, requires suffìcient time away from writing and its concerns. It is highly unlikely that the profession al theologian who merely studies and publishes will possess this know-how. Moreover, there is no theological sense multiplying articles and books if they do not have the charitable fìnality of the Christian corpus-, there exists the real possibility that many such texts will remain dead and lifeless, devoid of living Tradition. Faced with the alternative: Publish of Perish? one should certainly choose to publish. But one should also bear in mind that there exists a frenzied type of publishing which can lead to a different mode of perishing. Pontificia Università Gregoriana Pawel Kapusta, S.I. Piazza della Pilotta, 4 00187 Roma Italia SUMMARY Pawel Kapusta, S.I. The present article considers the relationship between the understanding of the Word of God on the part of the Church and on the part of the individuai theolo gian. The importance of written communication for this relationship is presented and analysed. The concepì of body (corpus) is applied analogically to the Church and to texts of the Tradition. The author suggests that fruitful incorporation of the ological texts into the corpus of the living texts of Christian faith actualizes and sym bolises the integration of individuai theological understanding with that of the Church. L'articolo considera la relazione della Chiesa da una parte e del teologo indivi duale da un'altra alla comprensione della Parola di Dio. Analizza l'importanza, per questo rapporto, della comunicazione scritta del lavoro teologico. Il concetto di corpo si applica analogicamente tanto alla Chiesa quanto ai testi scritti della Tradizione. L'incorporazione feconda del testo teologico nel corpus dei testi viventi della fede cristiana attualizza e simboleggia l'integrazione della comprensione del teologo individuale con quella della Chiesa.</page></plain_text>
