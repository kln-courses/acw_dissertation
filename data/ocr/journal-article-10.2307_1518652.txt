Brill, Leiden JEREMIAH'S BOOK OF CONSOLATION: A TEXTUAL COMPARISON NOTES ON THE MASORETIC TEXT AND THE OLD GREEK VERSION OF JEREMIAH XXX-XXXI1 by BOB BECKING Utrecht Introduction Many exegetical and interpretative publications on Jeremiah have the text of their first footnote in common. It says that, although the author is well aware of differences between the Old Greek and the Masoretic texts of the book of Jeremiah, an inter- pretation of the Masoretic version of the pericope in question is to be preferred. In many cases this embarrassing footnote implies the acceptance of the Hebrew text as superior in the Old Greek. A look at the scholarly discussion of textual problems in the book of Jeremiah shows that three are involved.2 (1) The text of the Old Greek version is about 14% shorter than the Masoretic text.3 (2) The order of the chapters is different. (3) After ch. xxix in the LXXJer. another translator seems to have worked on the text. There now follow some remarks on these three problems not aim- ing at a thorough discussion or even a new hypothesis. (1) The problem of the minuses or zero-variants in LXXJer. can be viewed from two angles. From the perspective of the Masoretic tradition, the Old Greek produces an abridged version in which, for example, double readings are avoided or translated away. From the point of view of the Old Greek version-now supported by the fragments of 4QJerb-the MT constitutes an expanded version in which many words and phrases have been added from parallel and 1 A paper read at the Joint Meeting of the Society for Old Testament Study and the Oud-Testamentische Werkgezelschap in Durham on 18 July 1991. 2 I leave aside the question of the reconstruction of the Urtext of LXXJer. 3 See the calculations of Y.-J.

In the scholarly debate, both positions are defended4 with a certain tendency towards the "expansion theory", according to which the shorter Vorlage of LXXJer. con- tains a text superior to the Masoretic tradition.5 This tendency not only thrusts into the background the "abbreviation theory",6 but also the so-called "editorial theory". According to A. van Selms, for instance, the differing versions derive from different copies pro- duced by Jeremiah and Baruch during the process of editing the final form of the book of Jeremiah.7 I will not review the pros and cons of this approach. However, it should be said that this editorial theory accounts for the second textual problem: the divergence in order in the composition in both the Old Greek and the Masoretic traditions. (2) The oracles against the foreign nations (MTJer. xlvi-li) are found in the Old Greek version after xxv 13. Moreover, at some points the sequence of the oracles against foreign nations in the LXX is different from the sequence in the MT.8 There is scholarly discord on the question which sequence is likely to be original.9 Since the adjudication of this issue lies far from the purpose of this article, it will not be discussed here.

It can be assumed that the Vorlage of the LXX already had an order different from the MT, which implies that in the post-exilic period, during the process of editing the Jeremianic traditions, two concepts were followed: a more "chronological" order in what later became the Proto-Masoretic tradition, now apparent in the MT, 2QJer and 4QJera.c.d.e., and a more "theological" order presented by the Hebrew text underlying the Old Greek version and by 4QJerb.l0 The phrase "a more theological order" expresses the view that in the sequence in the Old Greek version the relation between the prophecies of doom for the foreign nations and of salvation for Israel seems to be further elaborated or, as one might say, is more like the order known from the final redactions of the books of Isaiah and Ezekiel. (3) In 1902 H.StJ. Thackeray suggested that the Old Greek ver- sion of Jeremiah was the work of more than one translator. From LXXJer. xxix another hand seems to have worked on the transla- tion. Thackeray collected twenty-eight examples of constrasting translations between both sections, which he labelled Jer. a andJer. P3. The most striking is the rendering of koh 'dmar yhwh with a8&amp;E XyrIt KuptoS in Jer. a and with ouxtow E.T'9v KuptoS in Jer. P. Accord- ing to Thackeray the two parts once circulated independently.11 Fif- teen years ago E. Tov reconsidered this hypothesis. He agrees with Thackeray on the acceptance of two different hands in Jer. a and P and gives even more examples. Tov, however, wants to explain this divergent translation not by assuming two translators but by proposing a revision of the translation. Tov assumes that the whole of the Greek translation of Jeremiah underwent a revision. Because of a blending of manuscripts, this revision has been transmitted to us in Jer. P alone.12 A weak point in this hypothesis of Tov is the fact that, even in the Jeremianic fragments from Qumran, no manuscript evidence for a revision in Jer. a has been found. It is 10 On the fragments of Jeremiah from Qumran see now E. Tov, "The Jeremiah Scrolls from Qumran", RdQ 14 (1989), pp. 189-206 (2QJer and 4QJera.b.d.e), and "4QJerC(4Q72)", in G.J. Norton and S.

The character of the Greek translation in Jer. P underscores and consolidates the theological balance between the prophecies of doom for the foreign nations and of salvation for Israel. With this assumption in mind, a comparison of the two versions of the Book of Consolation, MTJer. xxx-xxxi and LXXJer. xxxvii-xxxviii, can now be undertaken. A Textual Comparison First, it should be noted that many lines and sentences of the Book of Consolation are rendered correctly in the Old Greek ver- sion, which implies that the majority of the verses are translated from a Hebrew Vorlage similar to the MT. However, this does not hold for the whole of the two chapters. So it is now necessary to review the different categories of variants between the two texts. 1. Zero variants The term "zero variant" expresses the fact that one version has a minus over against the other. In the Book of Consolation the text of the Old Greek version is shorter than the Masoretic. xxx 6 kayyoledd] &gt; kol-panm] kol] &gt; xxx 8 seba'ot] &gt; xxx 10-11 &gt; xxx 15 &gt; xxx 18 'ohole] &gt; xxx 19 wehikbadtlm welo yiscdru] &gt; xxx 22 &gt; xxxi 1 kol] &gt; xxxi 8 m'eres .sdpn] 'eres] &gt; xxxi 14 ne&amp;um-yhwh] &gt; xxxi 16 ne'um-yhwh] &gt; xxxi 17 neu2m-yhwh] &gt; xxxi 23 sebdast elohe yisrdel] &gt; xxxi 28 lints' welintOs welaharos uleha'abid] xa(OatpTtv 148</page><page sequence="5">JEREMIAH'S BOOK OF CONSOLATION xxxi 34 neumm-yhwh &gt; xxxl 35 huqqot] &gt; xxxi 37 koh 'dmaryhwh] &gt; Cal-kol- saer Cdsu] &gt; ne'mum-yhwh] &gt; xxxi 40 wekol-hdaemeq happegarim wehaddessen] &gt; There are some instances where the Old Greek has a longer text: xxxvii 6 xai rcpl po6pou ... aorrip(av]&gt; xxxviii 12 It yfi v (ixou] Cal-ddgdn xxxviii 37 cprlt x6ptoq]&gt; These zero variants suggest that the Hebrew Vorlage of the Old Greek version differed at some points from the Masoretic tradition. In a few instances the zero variants may have been generated by the translation technique. Both in xxx 18 and in xxxi 18 the minuses of 'ohole (viz. 'eres) produce a text which is specifically not different in meaning. Some of the other minuses are characteristic of the Hebrew text underlying the LXX: (a) the shorter form of the divine name in xxx 6 and xxxi 23;13 (b) the lack of an equivalent for the concluding prophetic for- mula neum-yhwh in xxxi 14, 16, 17, 34, 37,14 and (c) in some instances the absence of a translation for kol (xxx 6, xxxi 1) (see Janzen, Studies [n. 5], pp. 65-7). Interesting is the absence from the Old Greek version of xxx 10-11 and xxx 22. The words of MTJer. xxx 10-11 appear also in MTJer. xlvi 26-7, where they have a correct rendering in LXXJer. xxvi 26- 7. According to Janzen, MTJer. xlvi//LXXJer. xxvi should be regarded as a more adequate context for this oracle of salvation. Consequently, the zero variant in LXXJer. xxxvii 10-11 should not be interpreted as an abridged text-form. The Masoretic tradition, then, has an expanded version here.15 On the other hand, however, 13 See Janzen, Studies (n. 5); Soderlund (n. 4), pp. 213-14. 14 See D.

Within the context ofJer. xxx 4-11, the unit xxx 10-11 answers the question why the LORD is willing to act for his people.'6 This leads to the conviction that, although the Hebrew text underlying the Old Greek translation dif- fers from the Masoretic tradition, no opinion can be given on the question which textual tradition is superior to the other. A parallel view can be developed on the minus of the LXX in Jer. xxx 22. Here, the concluding words of the minor unit wihyitem 1i leCdm weecanokz 'lehyeh lakem leilohim have no parallel in the Old Greek version. According to Janzen this Bundesformel ought to be regarded as an expansion in the Masoretic tradition, the phrase having been composed on the basis of elements from parallel and related contexts (Jer. vii 23, xi 4, xiv 7, xxxi 33; cf. xxxi 1). He then refers to P. Volz who pointed out that the second-person pronouns (ldkem and wihyitem) in Jer. xxx 22 do not fit the context, since Israel is addressed by third-person singular forms in the foregoing unit ([n. 5], p. 49). This argument is not convincing. It is also possible to assume that either the Greek translator or the Hebrew transmit- ter of the Vorlage abridged the context here since a similar phrase is found in MTJer. xxxi 1. It is interesting to note that Janzen pays no attention to the zero variant in MTJer. xxxi 40.17 The Old Greek version has no parallel for wekol-hdiemeq happegdrim wehaddessen "and the whole valley, the corpses and the ashes". These words have no parallel within the book of Jeremiah. They cannot be considered, therefore, as an insertion from a related context. Since the Greek translator appears not to have understood the whole of Jer. xxxi 40 (see below), it can be assumed that he abridged his Vorlage because he found it unintelligible. The zero variant in LXXJer. xxxvii 6 is interesting. It seems that the Old Greek has transmitted a double reading of "Why do I see every hero with his hands on his loins?" The first reading is, most probably, the result of inner-Greek corruption, since it is impos- 16 See B. Becking, "'I will break his yoke from off your neck'.

The second reading-printed in brackets in Ziegler's edition-can be inter- preted as a later insertion of a revised translation of the MT (see Janzen, Studies [n. 5], p. 29). In LXXJer. xxxviii 28 the Old Greek has contracted the four verbs of the standard phrase of the final redactor of the book of Jeremiah "to uproot, to pull down, to overthrow, to destroy" into one verb: xaOatpeTv "to destroy". This contraction could have taken place during the transmission of the Hebrew Vorlage as well as during the process of translation.18 Finally, it should be noted that the plus in MTJer. xxxi 37 (kohadmaryhwh) is balanced by the minus of 97101 xupto;. 2. Linguistic Exegesis The Old Greek version of the Book of Consolation contains a few variants which, at first sight, seem to indicate a different Vorlage. A closer look at the texts in question reveals that the variants can be explained as a linguistic exegesis of a text similar to the Masoretic. In xxxi 619 the Old Greek version construed the imperfect cohor- tative following an imperative (qumu wena Caleh "Arise, let us go up ...") as an imperative ('Av&amp;TaxT71 xac &amp;vapYiTe; "Arise and go up In xxxi 7, the Greek translator reformulated the structure of the sentence in his Vorlage, interpreting "to Jacob" as an adverbial adjunct in the main clause and not as an element in direct speech. In fact, the Old Greek version can easily be understood by inver- ting the order of the words ronnu and leyaCaqob.20 In xxxi 20 the Greek translator construed the verb dabberz "I speak" as a noun vocalized debdray "my words" and rendered it with o{ X6yot ,uou, thus constructing a nominal clause (cf. Tov [n. 18 Janzen, Studies (n. 5), p. 35, and Lohfink (n. 5), p. 116, n. 17, consider the MT as a expanded version. See S. Bohmer, Heimkehr und neuer Bund. Studien zu Jeremia 30-31 (G6ttingen, 1976), pp. 38-43, S. Herrmann, Jeremia (Neukirchen, 1986), pp. 68-72, and the monograph of N. Kilpp, Niederreiflen und aufbauen (Neukirchen, 1990), esp. pp. 12-19, for an outline of the texts inJeremiah contain- ing this series of verbs and their redaction-historical relations. 19 The examples are numbered following the order in the MT. 20 See E. Tov, The Text-critical Use of the Septuagint in Biblical Research (erusalem, 1981), p. 87. 151</page><page sequence="8">BOB BECKING 20], p. 167). For the sake of comprehensibility he had to translate midde "For every time" with the conjunction v0o' cv "For". In xxxi 23, the jussive (yebarekeka; "May he bless you") was con- strkued as a passive participle (E6Xronrlevog; "Blessed be"). The omission on the 2nd m.s. suffix inyebdrekekd reverqes the direction of the wish. The Old Greek version is more theocentric than the Masoretic tradition. As a result of this interpretation of the jussive and the omission of the suffix the final words of the sentence are no longer looked upon as an apposition to -ka "you". An equivalent for "home" is lacking in the Old Greek version. By adding the preposition ixr, the Greek translator shows that he understood the final words of the sentence as an adverbial adjunct indicating the place where the LORD dwells. In xxxi 39 the Old Greek version either misconstrued the final -h of qewih21 hammidda. "the measuting line" as a he-mappiq indicating a 3rd f. suffix or made explicit what was already implicit in the Vorlage, while translating BLotFTptaL aOrr S "her measuring line". 3. An instance where the MT has a corruption xxx 6-7 leyieraqn h6y eS t'xEpov i^fTv10r into pallor. Woe they became pale The Old Greek version has preserved a better reading. In the Masoretic text h6y is incomprehensible. It cannot be considered as the introduction to a "woe-oracle" since the typical elements of that Gattung are absent from Jer. xxx 7. h6y is not followed by a descriptive nominal clause that would indicate the person who is accused. Furthermore, the accusation (Anklage) is missing. Merely the element of announcement (Ankiindigung) can be found in vs. 7,22 which suggests corruption within the Masoretic tradition. 4. Instances where the Old Greek did not understand its Vorlage It is apparent that the Old Greek translator did not understand the meaning of some Hebrew words which he simply transliterated. 21 Following the reading of the K'tib. 22 See my article on Jer. xxx 4-11 in New Avenues (n. 16), pp. 64, 67-8 (lit.), and Holladay (n. 9), p. 150. 152</page><page sequence="9">JEREMIAH'S BOOK OF CONSOLATION In xxxi 21 ijyuynlm "road-markers" is rendered with raovtl. Later Greek versions did understand the meaning, for instance Aquila: ax6rXaC.23 In the same verse tamrurim sign-posts" is rendered tRLlp- xopLiL. An additional remark is necessary. In Jer. xxxi 15 the homonym tamrurim "bitter (weeping)" is rendered correctly by 68upuoiu. In xxxi 21 the Old Greek version transcribed the noun with a vocalization differing from the MT.24 It can be assumed that the Hebrew text originally had another vocalization and that the Masoretes assimilated the reading of this incomprehensible hapax legomenon to the vocalization of tamrurim in xxxi 15. In xxxi 40 the Ketib hasiremrot "the fields" differs from the Qre hastdenmot "the ter- races". The Old Greek a,aprt o60 supports the reading of the Ketib (cf. Janzen, Studies [n. 5], p. 133). In this same verse, Cal-nahal qidron " &lt;over&gt;25 the brook Kidron" is rendered with [ox NaXaX KeBpcov "as far as the Nachal Kidron". The Old Greek version apparently interpreted the noun for "brook" as part of the name of the brook. 5. Secondary additions in the LXX In Jer. xxxi 22, a text which is difficult to understand,26 the Old Greek version has a free rendering: 23 The note in the apparatus criticus of BHS: B MSsLcov, supported by Rahlfs's edition of the LXX, should be regarded with some scepticism. The reading "Sion" occurs indeed, but only in manuscripts containing the text of the Hexaplaric recension. 24 Within the Greek tradition, another rendering is known: xtlpcowpav "help", which was considered more original by Rahlfs in his edition of the LXX. 25 With most of the commentaries the Hebrew word Cad should be corrected to Cal; Cad being a mistake influenced by the following "as far as". 26 See, among others, B.W.

The consequences on the level of meaning will be dis- cussed below. 6. Minor content variants There are a few instances in the Book of Consolation where the differences between the two texts can be explained easily by assum- ing an interchange or transposition of letters. These shifts lead to minor variants in the meaning of the texts. xxx 12 'anus' lesibrek your fracture is incurable 'Avioarca aUvspPtLpa I have brought destruction Apparently, the Old Greek has interpreted the noun a'nus' as a 1st- person singular imperfect Qal of the verb *nws. 27 In other instances too, the Old Greek did not understand the meaning of Cdnus; inJer. xvii 9, 16 'ns was read enolos "human being, man". In doing so, the LORD was presented as the one who brought to Israel the grief mentioned in Jer. xxx 12-17. xxx 17 kt nidddha qdrel' laik oin SroapiLiv7 ixXol-5' siyyon hi? 09ipsuwoa i,v atoV v, dores" 'en lah iL 7^Tcov oix F=tv actij 27 This verb does not occur in the Old Testament, but is known from an inter- pretation of Ps. lxix 21, see HALAT, p. 645. 154</page><page sequence="11">JEREMIAH'S BOOK OF CONSOLATION For they have called you an For you were called scattered outcast one, Zion, she is the one who is our prey, whom no one looks after. because no one looks after her. This is an interesting text. First, the Greek translator correctly renders qdre'u lak with ixX'f07r, interpreting the verb qr' constructed with le as an expression of a passive. The Old Greek version has rendered nidddha "outcast" with loapptdv'I "scattered one", which is characteristic for Jer. 3 (see Tov [n. 12], pp. 74-5). The most interesting difference, however, is the "misreading" of siyyon. The Old Greek version seems to have read sedeJnu "our prey". In all other texts in Jeremiah the name of the holy city Zion has been rendered correctly in the Old Greek (e.g. xxxi 12). Therefore, it can be assumed that either the Old Greek version reflects the original text28 or both versions contain a corrupt text. The reading of 4QJerc can also be mentioned here en passant. The Qumran fragment reads: ky ndht qr'w [... Unfortunately, the text is broken just before sywn hy . Consequently, 4QJerc sheds no light on the problem discussed in the preceding paragraph. But how should the reading ndht instead of ndhh be interpreted? According to Tov,29 there is only a small difference between 4QJerc and the Masoretic tradition here. ndht can be vocalized as a noun in the con- struct state (niddahat), as a feminine plural (nidddhot) or as a verb (niddahat). The first possibility gives no sense since the word is not followed by a noun in the absolute state. Interpreting ndht as a plural noun produces an interesting translation: "For the outcasts call you: 'She is Zion, the one whom no one looks after!'" The identification of the "outcasts", however, is problematical. There- fore, the interpretation as a verb should be preferred. The Niphcal 2nd f.s. perfect niddahat must be considered a descriptive qdtal form, consequently indicating a circumstantial clause. Thus, 4QJerc interpreted the sentence: "For, while you were cast away, they called you: 'She is Zion, the one whom no one looks after!' " 28 Thus Bohmer (n. 18), p. 63 + n. 321; G. Fohrer, "Israel-Prophet", p. 138; M. Gerlach, "Zur chronologischen Struktur von Jer 30,12-17.

The Hebrew text of Jer. xxiii 19 is similar to Jer. xxx 23 with the exception of mitgdrer. Jer. xxiii 19 construes mitholel as an accommodation to the Hebrew verb used in the closing line of the verse. LXXJer. xxiii 19 has a text deviating from both MTJer. xxiii 19 and LXXJer. xxxvii 23. This second deviation may have been the result of the revision by Jer.

But the text is even more complicated here, and thus it is almost impossible to explain the relation between both versions without accepting textual corruption on either side.30 Problematic are the shift "he found" (mddsa) to "I found" (eupov) and the change of verb in the subordinate clause: srd "to escape" is translated with a participle from ouXXurt "to destroy, ruin, wreck", which seems to be the opposite. The last shift, how- ever, is the root cause of the differences between the texts. The Greek form can be interpreted as a misreading of sride? on the basis of the well-known confusion between delet and res. The Old Greek version can be seen as a correct rendering of the Hebrew verb sdd "to destroy". xxxi 4 bimhol Jr&amp;sa vvaTfc'i in the dance with the community The Old Greek probably misread MT for biqhal.4QJerc supports the MT. The assumption that auvaTxyoT is a misreading can be related to the fact that the Old Greek consistently renders mhl with xxx 13 bemadhol ubahurim auvoTco'n v=voxWcov in the dance. Young men in the community of young men The Old Greek seems to have read bqhl bhrym interpreting the two words as in a construct chain. Consequently, they disturbed the grammatical order in the sentence. The Hebrew text should be translated: "Then, a virgin shall rejoice in the dance; young men and elders together". In taking bhrym as a part of the beginning of the sentence the final words of the line remain as a short nominal clause: "the elders together". To avoid this, the Old Greek repeated the verb "to rejoice" with the elders as its subject and changed the number of the first verb into the plural. In other words, there is a kind of a domino-effect in the translation. Each shift evokes another one. Perhaps it is superfluous to observe here that 4QJerc supports the Masoretic reading. 30 As has been proposed by Holladay (n. 9), pp. 180-1. 157</page><page sequence="14">BOB BECKING xxxi 13 mtgonam !lTaX,uvw after their sorrow I shall make them great The retroversion of IJTyaXuv&amp; is ribbiti which is a phonetic double reading of riwwitz the first verb of vs. 14.

(2) The Old Greek did not understood migondm and gave a free rendering. There are two arguments against the acceptance of a zero-variant in Jer. xxxi 13. First, the fact that the minus in the Old Greek is filled up with another verb, and second, the Masoretic tradition is supported by 4QJerc. xxx 21 subi 'el-adrayik elleh &amp;ro1tp&amp;rl7t Â¢elS ra&amp; ir6XetÂ¢ aou 7revOoiuaa Return to these, your cities Return to your cities of mourning Hebrew 'elleh is redundant, since the 2nd f. s. suffix already deter- mines the cities.

Therefore, both version can be explained either by assuming the falling out of the bet in the Masoretic tradition or by proposing a contextual translation of an incomprehensible Hebrew text, the theme of "mourning" being apparent in the textual unit on "Rachel weeping for her children". 4QJerc supports the MT. 7.

The Masoretic tradition has rendered this promise in words referring to the traditions of the occupation or conquest under Joshua. The Old Greek version moves one step further: after the second occupation the people will govern the land. This deepening of the meaning of the text can be explained linguistically by assuming that the Old Greek read a form of the verb rsh "to rule" rather than a form of the verb yrs.3 xxx 8 'esbor Cullod uvrptCco uybv me-cal sawwd'rekd &amp;iro TpaMX%l,ou 0Kaucov umdserotekad anatteq xao xO6; 8&amp;a4o6 ot &amp;Cvv BtappiSco I will break his yoke I will break a yoke from off your neck from off their neck and I will burst your bonds and I will burst their bonds In relation to the MT the Old Greek version seems to have changed some pronouns: "his" has disappeared, and "your" changed into "their". In doing so the Old Greek produced a comprehensible text. In it there is no longer a leap between the words translated here and the final line of xxx 8 in regard to the persons indicated by the pronouns. The last line reads: "they shall no longer serve strangers". In the Old Greek version the agent indicated by "they" in this line can easily be equated with those who are twice indicated by "their" in the earlier lines. In the MT this equation is problematical, since the "they"-group is addressed as "you" in vs. 8b and c. In accepting that the direct speech introduced by ne)um yhwh ends with the words translated above the shift in indicating persons in the MT can be explained.32 Consequently, the Old Greek version should be regarded as a later accommoda- tion to the understanding of the reader. 31 See R.

The Old Greek ver- sion seems to be a rendering of bsry()klw. The Old Greek not only misread basiebi for bsr with an interchange of res and bet, but also ylkw fory())klw with metathesis of kaph and lamed and the omission of the 'aleph. Which misreading was first is impossible to trace back. It is cear, however, that one deviation provoked the other. To quote Tov: "In the new context, the 'captivity' did not fit the 'eating', or alternatively the 'flesh' did not fit the 'going' and the second word was therefore adapted to suit the context" ([n. 20] p. 240). A few remarks should be added. First, it is not cear where the deviations took place. Or, phrased otherwise, is the Old Greek a deviation from the MT or vice versa?34 The first possibility seems to be the more plausible, since an omission of an 'aleph is easier to understand than an addition. The second remark is related to the fact that the twofold deviation in the Old Greek tradition generates an interesting text on the level of interpretation. The reading in the Old Greek relates both parts of the first line ofJer. xxx 16: "There- fore, all who have eaten you shall be eaten. And all your enemies shall eat their own flesh in its entirety". The second part of the line indicates the way the adjustment of the devouring will take place. Israel's enemies will not be devoured by others, but by themselves. They will fall by their own sword. The Old Greek version seems to refer to an oracle of salvation in Isa. xl 26: "I [ = the LORD] will make your oppressors eat their own flesh and they shall be drunk with their own blood as with wine".35 33 Contra M.J. Dahood, "The word-pair adkal//kildh in Jeremiah xxx 16", VT 27 (1977), p. 482. 34 According to Gerlach (n. 28), p. 41, the Hebrew text underlying the Old Greek version should be regarded as superior to the MT. 35 See M.

The retroversion of the Old Greek, however, seems to be bmwCd psh. In comparison with an unvocalized MT, there are only a few changes: the first two words are contracted; the positions of the wdw and the Cayin are interchanged and the res is read as a dilet. It is not clear, however, which reading should be regarded as more original or superior to the other. The phenomena discussed can be used as argument both for the view that the MT is superior and for the sur- mise that the Old Greek has a more original text. 4QJerc supports the reading of the Masoretic tradition: b[m] 'wr wpsh. Both readings fit their context. In the Masoretic tradition the words form a parallellismus membrorum with the following phrase "those who are pregnant and those who are giving birth together". In the Old Greek version the line is interpreted as an adverbial adjunct indicating the time at which the LORD will let his people return to their land: "on the feast of Pesach". Consequently, the Old Greek refers in one way or another to the traditions about the liberation from Egypt, thus deepening the meaning of the text (see also Tov [n. 20], p. 238). xxxi 12 werinnenul bimrom-siyyon xdal ecpavO^rovXaLr iv xr OSpEI they will sing on the height of they will rejoice on the Zion mountain of Zion The Old Greek version seemingly wants to avoid mentioning a height in Zion, since that would indicate that in the new situation there will be a place for such a heathen entity as a "height".

By this implicit reference, the Old Greek brings in the theological motif of creation thereby underscoring and extending the same theme already apparent in the preceding lines. Consequently, the return to Israel has been interpreted by the Old Greek translator as a renewal of creation. xxxi 19 kti a.hare subti nihamtti iL SO =pov aXlLXtoCaOL; ,ou for after my repentance, for after my captivity, I felt sorrow I felt sorrow The "repentance" of Ephraim is rendered as its "captivity".

The apparatus criticus of BHS suggests a retrover- sion of the Old Greek: adnaqti Cal-yeme boset, on the assumption that the Old Greek misread the verb spq for 'nq and the nounymy instead ofyrk. This linguistic explanation is not convincing in all its details. The proposed interchanges of Hebrew letters are not current and there is no resemblance of the proposed Vorlage to the MT on the level of phonetics. No other explanation, however, seems to be at hand. Perhaps, it might be assumed that the construction spq qlyrk was translated idiomatically with a form of the Greek verb =xev&amp;/co, and that botti was interpreted as an adverbial adjunct indicating the time which was bewailed by Ephraim. On the level of meaning, the Old Greek version makes a clear distinction in time between the "now" in which Ephraim bewails and the time about which it feels ashamed. In doing so a perfect parallel is construed with the words 6vet8Ltalo v ix ve6%r-t6Â¢ ,ou "the disgrace of my youth" in the closing line of the verse. 36 So, among others, Lohfink (n. 5), p. 118, n. 27. 162</page><page sequence="19">JEREMIAH'S BOOK OF CONSOLATION xxxi 20 Cal-kin hdmu meiay lo 8bt&amp; xzoUo 'c:euOa It' Oac6x therefore my entrails are therefore I exert myself for moved for him him The Old Greek version contains an accommodation. The anthropomorphic depiction of God in the MT-God actually has intestines-is translated away. The rendering of the verb hmh with aoueco is singular. In Jer. a hmh is translated with forms of Ico, xuLativco and paxcL&amp;aac)o. Jer. , translates it adequately with 3oLpb&amp;co in LXXJer. xxxvii 36 and xxxviii 36 (see Tov [n. 12], p. 103). For the choice of =CEu6co in LXXJer. xxxviii 20 a linguistic or phonetic explanation is not available. xxxi 22 For the text see pp. 153-4 above. Above, the view of Tov is mentioned that the differences between the two texts should be regarded as a result of secondary additions to the LXX. However, these secondary additions have generated a text in which the central ideas of the Book of Consolation are put into words. The Greek word acoxtrpCa interprets the return from the exile and the new covenant as God's salvation for his people. The verb xoarpcgeuco resembles the theme of the renewal of creation already expressed in MTJer. xxxi 12-13 and stressed b y LXXJer. xxxviii 12-13. xxxi 32 wecdnoki bdCaltz xoal IyT liXlaoc aau oCov and I was master over them and I abominated them It appears that the Old Greek read gdcalt instead of bdaalti. Presumably, the translator had the words of Jer. xiv 19 in mind: "Does your soul abhor the people of Zion?" Besides this inter- change of gimel and bit and the reference to a related context, other points need comment. The Old Greek interprets this sentence as the LORD's negative evaluation of the former behaviour of his people. In the MT the words have a totally different meaning: despite Israel's breaking of the covenant, the LORD is still their master. Finally the Vorlage of the Old Greek seems to have avoided an association of the LORD with the verb bdCal or the noun bacal. Since such an identification would be possible only in a Hebrew text, it must be assumed that the shift from bdCaltl to gdaalt took place already during the process of transmission of the Hebrew text underlying the Old Greek. 163</page><page sequence="20">BOB BECKING xxxi 33 natatti37 et-toradt beqirbdm At8ou; 86cac v6touc (OU etS AV 8L&amp;VOLcV c~xa)V I shall put my law within I shall certainly give my laws them in their mind The Old Greek version has a distorted translation of b'qirbdm "in their midst, within them". The MT can be interpreted in two ways. The phrase can be taken literally as "in their interior", meaning "in the heart of their city, among them" as in Jer. vi 1, where the Benjaminites are to flee from the "midst" of Jerusalem. The words, however, can also be considered as more figurative language referring to the interior intentions of the people.38 The Old Greek understood the words in this second meaning as a bodily metaphor for the mind of the people. In doing so the Old Greek version excluded another interpretation. 8. A rearranged unit Rounding off the textual comparison of both versions of the Book of Consolation, the unitJer. xxxi 35-7 will be discussed. The order of the verses is different in the Old Greek version. MT has 35-36- 37, while the Old Greek has vs. 37 at the head of the textual unit. Two kinds of problem need to be discussed: (1) the differing order, and (2) the textual differences. There are at least two ways to explain the difference in order. First, either the MT or the Old Greek version can be regarded as authentic, the other order involving an intentional or accidental moving of one verse.39 Second the difference in order can be explained in yet another way. It is possible to assume that two diverging collections of material related to the prophet Jeremiah once circulated independently. The question of the superiority of one text over the other, consequently, is of a literary-critical and redaction-critical nature.40 An answer to this question relates to 37 With a multitude of Hebrew manuscripts a reading wundtatti "and I shall put" is to be preferred; cf. BHS; Holladay (n. 9), p. 154. 38 See H. Weippert, "Das Wort vom neuen Bund inJeremia xxxi 31-34", VT 29 (1979), pp. 336-51; Holladay (n. 9), p. 198. 39 Tov (n. 5), p. 152, considers the order in the Old Greek as authentic. 40 Levin (n. 15), p. 200, seems to explain the different textual order in assuming a Fortschreibung in both versions on different locations. 164</page><page sequence="21">JEREMIAH'S BOOK OF CONSOLATION one's overall view regarding the genesis of the book of Jeremiah. The two versions of this smaller textual unit should be interpreted separately. At the form-critical level, the two versions have some elements in common and some which differ. In both versions the unit is built up in three textual elements, the construction, however, being dif- ferent. In the Old Greek version the unit is organized on the model of a concentric symmetry: A Oracle of salvation with a hypothetical subordinate clause B Hymnic depiction of the LORD A' Oracle of salvation with a hypothetical subordinate clause In this textual unit the hymnic depiction of the LORD as the guarantor of the regularity in the forces of nature functions as the central motivation for the oracle of salvation that the LORD is the guarantor of the endurance of the people of Israel. The Hebrew text of the Masoretic tradition has organized almost the same material using the stylistic figure of the climax.41 In this version the hymnic depiction of the LORD is the basis for two sentences, which are construed in a syntactically parallel way. Jer. xxxi 36 makes the negative statement that Israel will not cease to be the people of God. In the same way vs. 37 states that Israel will not be rejected by the LORD. I interpret "rejection" (m's) as a stronger and more theologically-laden expression of God's aban- donment of the covenant. Consequently, vs. 37 should be regarded as an extended parallel of vs. 36. Within the composition of the Book of Consolation both versions functions as motivation of the promise of the new covenant. In both versions the firmness of God's creation and the reliability of the laws of nature underscore the trustworthiness of the promises of the LORD. This motivation from creation, however, is arranged in different ways. Besides, there are some textual differences, which will now be discussed. xxxi 35 rogac hayydm wayyehemu xat xpau" ?iv Iv OaXd&amp;aQ, xax 4P6iraei ra x6 u(xaTa a6ot f5, 41 See. H.

In its mean- ing "statute; ordering; arrangement" it can indicate different kinds of orderings, i.e. of a cultic, of a cultural, or of a moral nature. In Jer. xxxi 36 the Old Greek correctly understood the word in its meaning "ordering of nature". The Greek noun v6ljos too has a broad spectrum of meanings.

It can be assumed that the Greek translator did not understand the exact meaning of the Hebrew verb.

The Greek 64wo90 suggests a form of the Hebrew verb rwm. Consequently, there must have been an interchange of daleth and res together with a metathesis of dalethlres and nmm: yrmw instead of ymdw.44 This change caused a reinterpretation of mlmclh. In the MT 42 Dr J.

The Old Greek translator regarded it, however, as a prepositional con- struction with the verb rwm. Thus "above" changed to "into above". In the Old Greek version the hypothetical subordinate clause contains a remark on the impossibility of the extension of the heavens. This interpretation caused the differences in the transla- tion of the following clause in the protasis: xxxi 37 weyehdqeru mosed-'eres x ali v TxWtilv)O7 t6 'oa Bco lemdattah 5q Trig x&amp;rco and the foundations of the and of the bottom of the earth below could be fathomed earth is lowered downward In the Old Greek version this clause is rendered as a parallel to the preceding one. A verbum movendi is chosen to render Hebrew hqr. No linguistic explanation of the differences between the two verses is possible. It should be remarked that in the Old Greek version this clause is a perfect counterpart of the preceding one. In the apodosis of the verse under consideration a form of linguistic exegesis can be indicated: xxxi 37 gam- anz 'em as Koal lyC oCx &amp;do8oxtl=8 bekol-zera yisrdael r6 yivog Iopa7lX then I shall reject the whole then I shall not reject of the offspring of Israel the offspring of Israel At first sight, the two utterances seem to be contradictory, the Hebrew version speaking about the rejection of, and the Old Greek about not rejecting, the people of Israel. This apparent contradic- tion overlooks the syntactical context in both versions. MTJer. xxxi 37 is written in the figure of an impossible condition, which implies the non-rejection of Israel in the apodosis. The Old Greek version has made this "not" visible on the surface-level of the text. The ultimate meaning of both clauses is the same. A few conclusions can be drawn about the textual history of the unit Jer. xxxi 35-7. (1) It is impossible to decide which of the dif- ferent orders is more authentic. (2) It can be assumed that the sentences in the Hebrew text underlying the Old Greek version did not differ greatly from the MT. This, however, is not an argument for the superiority of the order in the MT. (3) The rearrangement of the subject-matter in the textual unit together with some textual 167</page><page sequence="24">BOB BECKING differences does not lead to a text with a divergent meaning: the same motivation for the endurance of the new covenant is expressed in two differently modelled textual units. These tentative remarks on MTJer. xxxi 35-7 lead to the conclusions which are to be drawn as a result of the textual comparison. Conclusions Textual comparison has shown that most of the differences between the two versions of the Book of Consolation can be explained either as forms of linguistic exegesis or by assuming minor differences in content. Even in the explicit differences in con- tent no obvious interpretative or theological tendency can be detected. However, a few comments are needed. (1) The Old Greek version shows a stronger reference to elements from the "history of salvation": creation (xxxi 12,22) and exodus (xxxi 8). (2) The Old Greek version and the Hebrew tradition lying behind it seem to avoid blasphemous speech about God: in xxxi 20 God's "entrails" are translated away,45 in xxxi 32 a possible confu- sion between the LORD and Baal is removed. (3) The Old Greek version seems to opt for more internal coherence; see the remarks on xxxi 19. These shifts, however, leave unimpaired the theological tendency of the Book of Consolation. In the various textual units of Jer. xxx- xxxi a twofold transformation is indicated. First, the units refer to an event which has already taken place: the downfall of Jerusalem and the leading away of the people of Judah into the Babylonian captivity. This transformation is, for instance, Rachel's reason for weeping (Jer. xxxi 15-16). In the second place, a future transforma- tion is announced: The people will return to their own land, where the LORD will renew his covenant with them. This transformation was, in the time of the author of the Book of Consolation, still to come. This theological tenet is not changed or affected by the Old Greek translation. On the contrary, in two verses the second 45 Thus taking up the process of decrease of anthropomorphic depiction of the Divine, already at hand within the Old Testament traditions; see. M.C.A.

In LXXJer. xxxvii 3 it is promised that after the return from captivity Israel will rule over its country and not only inherit it as the MT states. In LXXJer. xxxvii 16 the prophecy of doom for Israel's oppressing enemies is phrased with the repulsive words "they shall eat their own flesh". All these remarks make less plausible an assumption mentioned in the introduction: the character of the Greek translation in Jer. P elaborates the theological balance occasioned by the rearrange- ment of the subject-matter in the Old Greek tradition, between doom for the foreign nations and salvation for Israel. An inten- tional sharpening of this balance is not demonstrable in LXXJer. xxxvii-xxxviii. This tentative conclusion implies that a new hypothesis on the nature and character of Jer. 3 cannot be for- mulated. The translator/revisor problem must be solved in some other way. At the same time, the comparison of the two texts of the Book of Consolation did not suggest any support for the hypothesis that the Old Greek version is a text which was intentionally abridged from its Vorlage or that the MT contains an expanded version of a superior text: the Hebrew text underlying the Old Greek. Over and above that in many instances in the Book of Consolation it is impos- sible to decide which text is a deviation from the other. That implies that this review actually gives unintended support to another hypothesis. No arguments were found against the "editorial theory". This is not a verification of the idea that the differing ver- sions derive from different copies produced by the collectors of the Jeremiah, Baruch, or, more probably, their pupils, but only an indication that the textual differences between the Old Greek and the Masoretic traditions could probably be solved by redaction- critical investigations in the book of Jeremiah, and that, conse- quently, redaction-critical proposals on the growth of the Jere- mianic tradition should, amongst other things, be able to give an explanation of the actual twofold textual tradition. 169</page></plain_text>
