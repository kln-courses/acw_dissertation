West does not print the paradosis κάθεμιστα,1 but follows Masson in preferring Matthiae's emendation και θεμιστα,2 which is metrically appropriate but effectively inverts the meaning of the clause. In a brief note, he remarks that Od. 17.487 confirms the emendation.3 There are two conceivable rationalizations: the fact that Archilochus employs the same verb (εφοράω) as Homer (albeit in tmesis) and in a similar context of justice and violence leads to the deduction that, by alluding to Homer, Archilochus therefore echoes the sentiment of his verse. Similarly, the fact that the fox subsequently attributes the contrasting traits of dike and hybris to animals implies that the actions of humanity ought, as well, to be potentially either positive or negative. Caught in the balance are the implications of the fox's prayer, and despite the considerable weight carried by West's verdict, the reasoning is suspect. The ' I am indebted to Benjamin Acosta-Hughes, Richard Janko, Tim Power, Jay Reed and Ruth Scodel for comments on earlier versions of this paper, as well as to C'Q's anonymous ref eree whose criticisms helped refine it. I am also grateful to the American Council of Learned Societies and The Andrew W. Mellon Foundation, whose New Faculty Fellows award supported the final stage of this research. Errors that remain are my own, as are the translations. 1 The fragment is preserved by the testimony of Stobaeus (1.3.34) and Clement of Alexandria (Stromata 5.14.127): in the former, one finds the readings καθέμιστας ol F; καθέμιτας oi P1; and κ αθέμιτα σοι Ρ2 (see C. Wachsmuth [éd.], Ioannis Stobaei Anthologii Libri Duo Priores [Berlin, 1884], ad loc.). F is the older and more reliable textual witness (even if it struggles with word division), while Ρ omits a sigma in both. Unlike West, F. Lasserre and A. Bonnard (edd.), Fragments. Archiloque (Paris, 1958), fr. 171, retain the paradosis. 2 Most (including West) attribute the conjecture to I. Liebel (Archilochi Iambographorum principis reliquiae quas accuratius collegit adnotationibus virorum doctorum suisque animadver sionibus illustravit et praemissa de vita et scriptis poetae commentatione [Vindobonae, 1818]); cf. F. Bossi, Studi su Archiloco (Bari, 1990), 205. 3 M.L. West, Studies in Greek Elegy and Iambus (Berlin and New York, 1974), 134: the Homeric verse reads ανθρώπων ϋβριν re και (ύνομίην έφορώντεs ('[the gods] observing the insolence and good order of mankind', Od. 17.487). So also D.L. Page, 'Archilochus and the oral tradition', in J. Pouilloux et al. (edd.), Archiloque: sept exposés et discussions (Vandœuvres Genève, 1963), 119-79, at 143, who cites Od. 13.213 in comparison as well.</page><page sequence="2">ARCHILOCHUS FR. 177 AND ANTHROPOMORPHIC FACADE 467 emendation is endorsed not with the support of philology, but on the basis of more subjective literary analyses. For their logic (as I reconstruct them, anyway) appears straightforwardly syllogistic: Homer says so, and if Archilochus alludes to Homer, therefore Archilochus says so as well. Similarly naive is the rationalization on the basis of the fox's description of animal behaviour: if animals are capable of dike and hybris, and if the animals in fable reflect human situations, then human beings are therefore capable of good and bad as well. Yet deductions of this sort are an insufficient basis for a textual adjustment; allusion, in particular, is a tricky thing, and instead of indicating a straightforward correspondence, Archilochus could just as easily be invoking Homer to mark the gulf separating their respective portray als and assumptions about mankind. In this light, the emendation unnecessarily simplifies the text and reduces it to a mere Homeric parallel.4 Similarly, is there any solid basis for assuming that just because a fox - who is at once an animal and a literary construct - attributes dike and hybris to animals, that she must therefore also attribute similarly contrasting qualities to the human race? Only a human audience would presume as much. In what follows, I will argue on philological grounds for the retention of the paradosis before offering a literary analysis of the peculiar sentiment it attributes to Archilochus' fox. The analysis will proceed through a comparison of the Works and Days' fable of the hawk and the nightingale and the Archilochean fable, drawing out how the fox's negative description of human deeds (and the concur rent claim that animals possess a capacity for both dikê and hybris) plays on the Hesiodic passage in which the possession of justice elevates human beings above other beasts. Both fables employ an anthropomorphic facade, but in both it is also undermined: the animals and their drama do not simply reflect a human situation, but illuminate it precisely because their situation or perspective is unique. As in Homeric simile, but less so than is the case in Aesop, the facade in these early fables and the analogy they suggest are complicated,5 and understanding them as such alleviates the literary impulse to emend the text of Archilochus: one need not expect a straightforward correspondence between animal and human in the fable. PHILOLOGY AND ARCHAIC USAGE Strictly speaking, the reading preserved by the most authoritative ductus litterarum is fully acceptable: καθέμιστα is the eras is of και and άθίμιστα,6 which produces 4 On the editorial practice of simplifying what one does not understand, see M.L. West, Textual Criticism and Editorial Technique (Stuttgart, 1973), 51. Preserving the text can also be justified on simplistic literary grounds: see O.S. Farnell, Greek Lyric Poetry (London, 1891), 301, who retains the reading for the reason that it 'is more suited to the context ... of sin and punishment'. s M.J. Mordine, 'Speaking to kings: Hesiod's ΑΙΝΟΣ and the rhetoric of allusion in the Works and Days', CQ 56 (2006), 363-73, at 365 classifies early fable as 'a kind of multivalent speech which is both authoritative and ambiguous'. B. Acosta-Hughes, Polyeideia. The Iambi of Callimachus and the Archaic Iambic Tradition (Berkeley, 2002), 172 similarly notes that the 'juxtaposition of human and animal figures maintains the demarcation [between them], although a certain permeability occurs with granting human institutions to the animals and the inclusion of human works in the fox's prayer'. See also, most recently, R. Gagné, Ά wolf at the table: sym potic perjury in Archilochus', TAPhA 139 (2009), 251-74, at 254, on aivos as a kind of αίνιγμα. 6 Cf. Bossi (η. 2), 205.</page><page sequence="3">468 C. MICHAEL SAMPSON the long alpha required by metre. Crasis involving και is attested elsewhere in Archilochus - even within the same epode7 - and if the original reading was και θέμιστα and an iota was indeed lost, it likely happened at a very early stage in transmission, as of the MSS only L preserves the unmetrical reading και â θέμις} The better attested sequence (καθεμι) is usually transcribed as such (καθέμι), but a variant in P2 is notable for the word division that preserves alpha privative (κ άθέμι). The issue with the reading which has prompted emendation seems simply to be its troubling connotations: given that the epic uses of the adjective άθέμιστος described figures such as the Homeric Cyclops and suitors,9 that the fox would use this label to typify human actions in her prayer is suspect.10 Because άθέμιστος is roughly synonymous with the adjective Aecοργά with which it is paired,11 and because of both the Homeric model which contrasts mankind's capacity for good and bad (υβριν re και ΐύνομίψ) and the fox's similar contrast in the case of animals, it seems appropriate, for the purpose of creating correspondence, to emend to και θέμιστα,12 But while the Homeric comparandum encourages emendation, an analysis of Archaic diction backs the transmitted text. Adjectival forms of the abstract noun θέμις, for example, are limited in Archaic Greek to the privative άθέμιστος or compounds such as θίμιστοπόλος." There is no positive adjectival form, for which reason epic employs the formulaic assertion fj θέμις έστίν in its absence. The closest Archaic parallel - Hera's complaint that Ares does not know any themis - is no parallel at all; θέμιστα is there (as usual) a feminine noun, not an adjective.14 If the formular diction of Archaic epic is as strong an influence on this epode as Denys Page has argued, then the reading κάθέμιστα is, by far, the preferable one.15 On purely philological grounds, emendation is unnecessary: the reading άθέμιστος is not only supported by the manuscript tradition, but its usage is also well attested in the Archaic period. It is rather the decision to emend, contrarily, that requires 7 See fr. 174.2 and its similar eras is with και (καίε τός): cf. fr. 24.16; fr. 25.7; and the Cologne epode (SLG 478a.39 = Ρ Colon. 7511 = Ρ Koln 58). So also in spurious fragments: fr. 119.1; ff. 212; fr. 324.3; ff. 327.8; ff. 328.8, which suggests that eras is of this sort was a recognized feature of Archilochean style. 8 See P. da Cunha Corrêa, Ά human fable and the justice of beasts', in P.J.

The adjective's etymology suggests a meaning closer to 'all-accom plishing', which, like its relative πανούργος, possesses negative connotations. 12 So also Corrêa (η. 8), 113: 'The construction is perfectly symmetrical, the ϋβρις and "όίκη (violence and justice) of beasts corresponding to human actions that are λεωργά and θεμιστα (wicked and lawful), but it operates on an inversion.' 13 For the former, e.g. Horn.

This remark, however, masks the underlying textual problem to the point of being misleading: the epic influence may well be strong, but that would argue against reading an otherwise unattested adjectival form of θέμις.</page><page sequence="4">ARCHILOCHUS FR. 177 AND ANTHROPOMORPHIC FACADE 469 justification - especially one that asserts an unparalleled adjectival use of θέμις}6 No matter how common the trope that mankind is capable of both good and bad,17 Archilochus' epode does not seem to provide a further witness to it. FABLE AND ANTHROPOMORPHISM Doing away with the philological basis for the emendation, however, is far from a panacea, for it also complicates the task of interpretation. Gone is the possibil ity that human behaviour in the fox's prayer is, like that of animals, potentially both good or bad, and gone as well, therefore, is an endorsement of the Homeric passage in which Zeus oversees both the good order and hybris of human beings. The result is somewhat unsettling, since in place of the anthropomorphic assump tions which a human audience would bring to the fable, the fox's prayer asserts something different - that it is animals who are capable of both dike and hybris and that mankind's actions are reckless (λΐωργά) and disorderly (κάθέμιστα). It is to those assumptions and how the fox otherwise disappoints them that I now turn. The idea that fable invites its narrative audience to employ an anthropomorphic interpretive framework derives from a reading of the Aesopic corpus: Aesop's fables typically reflect human situations and present paradigms for human behaviour via animals who 'possess speech and rationality, while retaining characteristics typi cal of their species'.18 Their rationality and capacity for speech are particularly important, as these are otherwise the chief distinctions between human beings and other beasts.19 Fable blurs this basic ontological distinction: human and animal come into direct contact,20 and not only do animals behave in a quasi-human manner, but their actions also hold up a mirror to human situations. In other words, the attribution of human traits to animals - the anthropomorphic facade of fable - is proper to the genre.21 In Aesop, the prevalence of promuthia and epimuthia prompt interpretation on such straightforward terms: so, for example, the epimuthion to 16 The first transparent use of θέμις as a positive adjective occurs in Aeschylus (Sept. 694), and even there, its force is negated: ώμοδακής σ άγαν "μΐρος έξοτρύν^ι πικρόκαρπον άνδροκτασίαν rtXeiv αίματος ού θαμιστοΰ ('a raw and gnawing craving urges you on to excess, to accomplish a most bitter harvest of manslaughter, from blood not themis for you to shed'). 17 See e.g. Op. 124, 254. I will shortly discuss the significance of the fox referring to human deeds as such. 18 B. Acosta-Hughes and R. Scodel, 'Aesop poeta. Aesop and the fable in Callimachus' Iambi', in M.A. Harder, R.F. Regtuit and G.C. Wakker (edd.), Callimachus II (Groningen, 2002), 1-22, at 2. 19 R. Renehan, 'The Greek anthropocentric view of man', HSPh 85 (1981), 239-59. 20 Animals can interact with human beings in Aesop (e.g. 16, 22, 35, 51 Perry). 21 In making this point about the genre of fable and the narrative audience's interpretive framework, I am invoking the distinction between 'narrative' and 'authorial' audiences put forth by P. Rabinowitz, Before Reading: Narrative Conventions and the Politics of Interpretation (Ithaca, 1987). Unlike the authorial audience, to which the text addresses itself, the narrative audience knows what the text takes for granted and treats it as true: one could say that the narrative audience of fable accepts (if not expects, as well) the anthropomorphization of animal behaviour.</page><page sequence="5">470 C. MICHAEL SAMPSON Aesop's version of the fable of the fox and the eagle predicts divine punishment for wrongdoers who appear to evade retribution.22 Archilochus' fable, in which the fox not only has the capacity for speech and prayer, but also employs them for the purpose of appealing to Zeus for justice, is at first glance consistent with an anthropomorphic reading.23 Thus, by interpreting the fox's quarrel with the eagle as analogous to Archilochus' quarrel with Lycambes, recent interpretations have produced numerous important insights into the poem's performative context. I do not dispute their findings nor the larger reality of the poem's performative context, but in light of how the fox describes human actions as reckless (Aeo&gt;ργά) and disorderly (κάθίμιστα), while attributing to animals a capacity for dike and hybris, the scholarly recourse to an analogous human context runs the risk of overlooking the prayer's inner logic. The fox is not immediately concerned with drawing an analogy between human beings and animals: from her perspective, the two are quite different, and thus arises the need to examine the anthropomorphic assumptions about the genre of fable and to determine to what extent they ought to be tempered. In turning to the Archilochean fox's prayer, one observes something quite differ ent from a straightforward anthropomorphism. On the one hand (as I freely admit), the fact that the fox claims that animals have a capacity for both justice (δίκη) and insolence (ΰβρις) is perfectly appropriate to an anthropomorphic interpretation, as are her capacity for speech and her prayer to Zeus as the god of justice. But her words also distance her situation from some analogous human one. For one thing, the attribution of justice to animals is startling: as Renehan notes, this 'is the only place in early Greek literature where δίκη is attributed to animals'.24 And it is not the case that the fox appeals to Zeus in his role 'as the ultimate sanction of justice among mankind'; in the prayer, Zeus is rather the god of justice among animals.25 Ontological distinctions, far from being undermined, are in fact reinforced by the prayer:26 22 ο λόγος δηλοΐ, οτι οι φιλίαν παρασπονδούντεζ, καν την των ηδικημενων εκφύγωσι κόλασιν, άλλ' οΰν γε την εκ θεού τιμωρίαν ου δίακρούσονται ('The meaning is clear, that those who violate oaths of friendship will not evade the punishment of god, even if they avoid the retribution of those who were wronged', 1.21-3 Hausrath-Hunger). 23 The tendency of scholars has been to relate Archilochus' fable to the Lycambes epode in which it appears: C. Carey, 'Archilochus and Lycambes', CQ 36 (1986), 60—7; B. Gentili, Poetry and its Public in Ancient Greece. From Homer to the Fifth Century (Baltimore, 1988), 187, 190-1; C.G. Brown, 'Iambos', in D. Gerber (éd.), A Companion to the Greek Lyric Poets (Leiden, 1997), 11-88, at 65-6; G.-J. van Dijk, ΑΙΝΟΙ, ΛΟΓΟΙ, ΜΥΘΟΙ. Fables in Archaic, Classical, and Hellenistic Greek Literature (Leiden, 1997), at 142 ff.; Acosta-Hughes (n. 5), 171; T. Hawkins, 'Out-foxing the wolf-walker: Lycambes as performative rival to Archilochus', ClAnt 27 (2008), 93-114; Gagné (η. 5). 24 Renehan (η. 19), 256. Renehan is not troubled by the passage, seeing it as a case of what I term fable's anthropomorphic facade. Others are more troubled by the idea: F. Lasserre, 'La fable en Grèce dans la poésie archaïque', in F.R. Adrados et al. (edd.), La Fable: huit exposés suivis des discussions (Genève, 1984), 61-104, at 93, makes dikê 'juste punition'; and Bossi (n. 2), 205 attributes to Slings (but provides no reference) the point that dike means 'non "giustizia", bensi "giudizio"' [sc. of Zeus]. Both unnecessarily distort the meaning of dike. 25 So also D. Steiner, 'Framing the fox: Callimachus' second Iamb and its predecessors', JUS 130 (2010), 97-107, at 99. Cf. Carey (n. 23), 65. 26 Aesop's first fable involves no prayer to Zeus or mention of mankind, yet as with most fables, the applicability of the situation to human affairs is stressed by the epimuthion begin ning ο λόγος δηλοΐ, οτι ...</page><page sequence="6">ARCHILOCHUS FR. 177 AND ANTHROPOMORPHIC FACADE 471 Ώ Ζεϋ, nàrep Ζΐΰ, σον μεν ουρανού κράτος, σύ δ εργ επ ανθρώπων οράς λεωργά κάθέμιστα, σοι δε θηρίων ύβρις τ€ και δίκη μελει (ff. 177 West) Ο Zeus, father Zeus: yours is the power of heaven; you observe the reckless and disorderly deeds of mankind; and the insolence and justice of beasts is your concern. The fox structures her prayer via the polyptoton of σον, σύ and σοι, each element of which concerns a different order of being.27 As opposed to a straightforward anthropomorphic facade, the prayer asserts an ontology of animate being that is tripartite and distinguishes the human from the animal that might resemble it. So too is the divine distinguished: as West notes, 'Zeus is not simply a third, stronger animal. He is invoked as the god of justice'.28 And justice, as we have seen, belongs (for the fox) uniquely to animals.29 Far from inviting a straightforwardly anthropomorphic interpretation, the structure of the prayer broadcasts instead an ontological hierarchy. And although a cursory glance at the order in which they are presented - god, human, animal - suggests a familiar anthropocentric ontology, their respective attributes tell a different story. As others have noted, the fox's prayer responds to the Works and Days' claim that Zeus has not provided animals with justice (276-80),30 which appears at the tail end of a sequence of passages thematizing dikê and hybris. Here, Hesiod provides the foundation for the Archilochean fox's prayer. As his narrator spells out the superiority of dike over hybris, he addresses Perses and makes an effort to distinguish human beings from other animals: τόνδε γαρ άνθρώποισι νόμον διάταξε Κρονίων, ίχθύσι μεν και θηρσί και οίωνοΐς πετεηνοΐς εσθειν αλλήλους, επει ού δίκη εστί μετ αύτοίς άνθρώποισι δ' εδωκε δίκην, η πολλον αρίστη γίνεται- (Ορ. 276—80) For Cronian Zeus has disposed this nomos for human beings. It is for fish and beasts and winged birds to eat one another, since there is no dike amongst them. But to mankind he has given dikê, which is far the best. The Hesiodic passage reveals much the same ontological distinction between the gods, human beings and beasts as was glimpsed in the fox's prayer.31 The two 27 D.E. Gerber (éd.), Euterpe: an Anthology of Early Greek Lyric, Elegiac, and Iambic Poetry (Amsterdam, 1970), 39 argues that the repeated vocatives and polyptoton indicate the fox's urgency, which is undoubtedly true but ignores the content of the polyptoton. 28 West's comment appears in the discussion to M. Nojgaard, 'La moralisation de la fable: d'Ésope à Romulus', in Adrados (n. 24), 225-51, at 244. Acosta-Hughes (n. 5), 171 comes close to my point when he argues (apropos fr. 174) that the fable demarcates 'the animal characters of the fable from the people who relate it, though the animals are anthropomorphized'. 29 Cf. Gagné (η. 5), 268. 301 am here following up on the brief comment of M. Gagarin, 'Dike in Archaic Greek thought', CPh 69 (1974), 186-97, at 190: '[Archilochus' fable] must be understood as an elabo rate reference to the Works and Days, where Zeus is said to oversee the hubris and dike of men, and yet has not given dike to the animals'. So also D.A. Campbell, Greek Lyric Poetry. A Selection (London, 19672), 160; cf. Van Dijk (n. 23), 140 n. 18. 31 For a thorough analysis of how Hesiod constructs the distinction, see Mordine (n. 5), 371-3.</page><page sequence="7">472 C. MICHAEL SAMPSON accounts also agree that dike is the specific concern of Zeus, that its possession distinguishes mankind and animals and that the capacity for dike is linked with a capacity for hybris. The major difference between the two accounts lies not so much in their attri butions of dike, but rather in their respective narrative contexts. In Hesiod's case, the narrator is a human being, and the assertion of a conventional ontological hierarchy - god, human, animal - is therefore in no way unusual. In Archilochus, by contrast, there is a gap between the fable's human narrator (not to mention the narrative audience) and the animal perspective articulated by the fox.32 The attribution of dikê and social institutions to animals is curious only from the kind of external, human perspective articulated by Hesiod;33 on the assumption that dikê is unique to humanity, the fox has overturned the conventional hierarchy. But the prayer is not delivered from a human perspective: Archilochus focalizes the claim through the fox who expresses it, and from her perspective, the 'adjusted' hierarchy is, in fact, reality. Thus, while the fable's human audience can sympathize with the fox because it recognizes itself in her - both in the social norms which have been violated by the eagle and in her recourse to Zeus - these anthropomorphic assumptions are not entirely borne out by the text. The fox's ontological hierarchy may list humanity between gods and animals, but its contents suggest, rather, that animals mediate between the divine and the human. The fable's internal logic, accordingly, stands out as unusual: the implication is that humanity represents the lowest order of animate being. The peculiarity of the fox's perspective is brought out by its contrast with Hesiod, whose Works and Days maintains a markedly human perspective over and against its fable. That fable, in which the hawk espouses the rule of the stronger,34 initially appears to be straightforwardly anthropomorphic: via an epi muthion of sorts, the narrator declares it a negative paradigm for human behaviour: Ώ Πέρση, συ δ' Άκουε 8ίκης μηδ' ΰβριν οφΐλλΐ ('Perses, listen to dikê and do not foster hybris', 213). The message is clear: Perses ought not to follow the hawk's example in preferring hybris to dikê.3&gt; Explicit in the epimuthion is the 32 The external, human perspective is made clear by another fragment, which introduces the fable: αΐνός τις ανθρώπων δδε, | ώς dp' άλώπηξ καίετος ξυνεοινίην \ έμειξαν ('There is a certain fable of people, how a fox and an eagle once joined in a partnership if. 174 West). The oddness of the genitive ανθρώπων helps to distinguish the external framework for the fable: as Acosta-Hughes (n. 5), 171 notes, it 'achieves an effect of distancing the fable's citation from its narrative surrounding'. See also Corrêa (η. 8), 103-4. 33 The society (ξυνεωνίη) described in ff. 174 entails, for Hesiod, the presence of justice: πάντα ιδών Διος οφθαλμός και πάντα νοήαας \ και νυ τάδ', ai κ' εθελησ, επιδερκεται, ουδέ ε λήθει | οΐψ δη και τήνδε δίκην πόλις εντός εεργει ('Seeing all things and noticing all things, the eye of Zeus observes the situation even now, if it so desires, nor does this type of dike that our polis contains escape his notice', 267-9). Cf. the famous words of Aristotle: &lt;5 δε μη δυνάμενος κοινωνείν η μηδέν δεόμενος δι' αντάρκειαν ούθεν μέρος πόλεως, ώστε η θηρίον η θεός. ('But he who is unable to live in a community or needs no part of the polis by reason of self-sufficiency, that one is either a beast or a god', Pol. 1253a27-9). 34 δεΐπνον δ , ai κ εθελω, ποιησομαι η ε μεθησω. \ άφρων δ\ ος κ' εθελη προς κρείσσονας άντιφερίζειν■ ('I'll make you my supper or I'll let you go - if 1 want. Foolish is he who wishes to set himself against stronger creatures', 209-10). As W.J. Verdenius, A Commentary on Hesiod Works and Days w. 1-382 (Leiden, 1985), ad 202-12 notes, this is an illustration 'of the basic principle underlying the characterization of the present age, viz. δίκη εν χερσί (192)'. 35 On the various interpretations of the fable, see T.K. Hubbard, 'Hesiod's fable of the hawk and the nightingale reconsidered', GRBS 36 (1995), 161-71, at 161-3, and the recent analysis by Mordine (n. 5), 367 ff. The chief problem is the fable's double perspective: although it is</page><page sequence="8">ARCHILOCHUS FR. 177 AND ANTHROPOMORPHIC FACADE 473 assumption that animal behaviour adequately reflects human behaviour. Even the sequence into which the fable falls suggests an anthropomorphic reading: the fable (202-12) intervenes between the myth of the ages of mankind (106-201) and a longer thematization of hybris and dike (213-85), the latter of which includes the aforementioned claim that animals lack dikê (276-80). The surrounding context is emphatically human, which is fitting for the poem's literary conceit: in the Works and Days, the Hesiodic narrator both urges the advantages of justice and hard work to a brother inclining instead toward laziness and litigation, and warns a judiciary against corruption.36 Hesiod's fable provides an early (and roughly contemporaneous) comparandum for Archilochus,37 but despite the contrastingly human analogy provided by its literary conceit, it is not simply a foil for the Parian. For, although the Hesiodic fable at first glance seems appropriate to the Works and Days' literary conceit, on closer examination its message adheres neither with what precedes nor what fol lows it in the sequence. The hawk's successful use of force is troubling (especially vis-à-vis the preceding myth of the ages38) and, more importantly, the subsequent discussion prompts a reconsideration of the fable's paradigmatic function.39 For, by distinguishing animal and human natures according to the criterion of dikê nearly one hundred lines after the fable's conclusion, it implicitly rejects the parallel ism of animal and human natures initially encouraged by the fable: the assertion that there is a different nomos for mankind and that only beasts eat one another (276-80) not only reinterprets the fable but effectively inverts its meaning. Instead of continuing to present the hawk as a negative exemplar of hybris for Perses, the claim that animals lack dikê instead excuses the bird's behaviour - snatching the nightingale for his meal - as thoroughly appropriate to its animal nature. Vis-à-vis the literary conceit and the dispute with Perses, Hesiod's human nar rative in the end modifies the fable's anthropomorphic trappings: the claim is not simply that Perses ought not to act as the hawk does but rather that, were he to do so, he would be lowering himself to the level of animalistic behaviour and degrad ing his humanity. As West notes, the adjustment is significant: 'This is to negate the parallelism of animal and man which is fundamental to the genus fable',40 as excusing the hawk's behaviour is incompatible with the narrative's larger goal of impugning Perses. Ontological distinctions, far from being undermined by anthro pomorphism, remain in effect. In interpreting the significance of this adjustment, however, one has a few options. The first, more common approach is to prioritize the human analogy. From this perspective, as Elizabeth Irwin notes, Archilochus goes beyond his model: initially addressed to the kings (βασι,λεΰσιν ... φρονέουσι καί αντοΐς, 203), it ends with the address to Perses (213), who is the focus of what follows. 36 So Verdenius (n. 34), ad 202-12. 37 Thus, the scholiast (Σ Τ ad 11. 19.407) groups these two fables over and against the later corpus of Aesopic fable. 38 See Verdenius (n. 34) ad 202-12; cf. also the absurdities he details which result from an attempt to explain the difference away (ibid. 117 n. 472). 39 Mordine (n. 5), 371 also notes the shift and explains well the manner in which the text frames it. My focus lies in a different area. 40 M.L. West, Hesiod: Works &amp; Days (Oxford, 1978), ad 202-12; so too U.

MICHAEL SAMPSON Archilochus' reformulation of Hesiod is pointed, almost polemical: the fox's prayer, in direct contrast to Hesiod, unquestionably implies that animals do have dikê, and that this is a concern to Zeus. The assertion of dikê in the animal world also has a function in Archilochus' story: such an assertion heaps abuse upon Lycambes who has no dikê and therefore is worse than an animal. This is considerably stronger than Hesiod's moral, whose message is that one ought not to behave like an animal.41 Irwin's findings make good sense. None the less, they leave one particular obstacle to interpretation intact: the fox's point is not that Lycambes lacks dikê, but that humanity as a whole lacks dikê. This assertion, combined with the polyptoton of her prayer, resists the anthropomorphic interpretation which simply identifies the fox with the poetic Ί' who narrates the fable.42 The fox's prayer draws attention rather to the collision of expectations: for the external, human audience to grant the anthropomorphic assumption that animals, like people, can possess dikê entails their endorsement of the fox's adjusted ontological hierarchy as well. Inasmuch as the fox is neither a human character nor elsewhere expresses human assumptions about the cosmos or its ontological hierarchy, the literary assumptions that prompt the emendation of the reading Aetοργά κάθεμιστα fall away. For non human literary characters to speak about generalized humanity in such disparaging terms is not really so odd; one need only consider Apollo's similar assertion in the Homeric Hymn to Apollo — ΰβρις θ', η θέμις εστί καταθνητών ανθρώπων ('and hybris, which is the norm for mortal mankind', Hymn. Horn. Ap. 541) - to see humanity's sanguine assumptions about itself disputed. In much the same way, there is no need for the fox to stress the positive qualities of human action in the prayer, particularly if, in her ontological hierarchy, humanity lacks dikê. It is left to the epode's human audience to recognize that the fable describes Archilochus' analogous dispute with Lycambes, and it is left to the human audience to appropri ate and refract the fable to fit into this larger framework. A final parallel helps bring the arguments for reading κάθεμιστα and for resisting the straightforwardly anthropomorphic interpretation of early fable to a conclusion. Xenophanes' later critique of Greek divinities as gods fashioned in mankind's image makes explicit two points which this paper has found implicit in Hesiod and Archilochus - that anthropomorphic readings proceed from a human perspective that is external to the fable and that this perspective distorts established ontological boundaries. For Xenophanes, poets characterize the gods' behaviour in startlingly familiar terms: ώς πλεΐστ εφθεγξαντο θεών άθεμίστια εργα, κλεπτειν μοιχεύειν τε και αλλήλους άπατεύειν (fr. 12 DK) So they sang of the disorderly actions of the gods - theft, adultery and deceiving one another. 41 Ε. Irwin, 'Biography, fiction, and the Archilochean ainos', JHS 118 (1998), 177-83, at 181-2. 42 Of course, questions surrounding Archilochus' poetic Τ and the identities of his bêtes noires complicate any straightforward evaluation: see R. Rosen 'Hipponax, Boupalos, and the conventions of the psogos', TAPhA 188 (1988), 29-41, at 29-31 nn.1-3, 5-8, who summarizes the questions and analyses; more recently, Hawkins (n. 23).</page><page sequence="10">ARCHILOCHUS FR. 177 AND ANTHROPOMORPHIC FACADE 475 Xenophanes' reference to the θΐών άθεμίσπa έργα alludes to the Archilochean fox's prayer and its έργα ... ανθρώπων ... καθίμιατα. For in criticizing humanity's anthropomorphic assumptions about the divine, which ascribe all manner of shame ful deeds to the gods,43 Xenophanes echoes the implications of the Archilochean fox's prayer, namely that it is human action which is fundamentally αθΐμίατια. His point is a familiar one: an anthropomorphic notion of divinity distorts,44 and is limited - even ridiculous - inasmuch as it ignores deeper ontological distinction. The same critique is implicit in the early fables of Archilochus and Hesiod, which invite interpretation on anthropomorphic terms even as they assume an ontological hierarchy. In addition to providing a further witness for a poetic anxiety about anthropo morphism, perhaps the most important element of the Xenophanes passage is the fact that it provides final corroboration for the textual point which prompted this paper as a whole: the reading θΐών άθΐμίστια ί'ργα supports the preservation of the transmitted text of Archilochus; the minor change in the adjective's form (άθίμιστα &gt; άθΐμίστια) is the result of a new metrical context. Emending the reading κάθέμιστα in Archilochus fr. 177 is not only philologically suspect, but also relies on assumptions about the genre of fable which are not wholly borne out by Archilochus or his Hesiodic model. Anthropomorphic interpretations of fable may be convenient, but the early fables themselves are more complicated in their juxtaposition of human and animal nature. As in Homeric similes, the analogy they draw is far from straightforward. Undue focus on the epimuthion or promuthion (in the case of Aesopic fable), or a naive confidence in either the anthropomorphic facade's security or the inviolability of an allusion minimize the complexity of fable. This is not to say that these fables have no relationship to the literary conceit of their respective poetic contexts but that, on their own terms, they resist being reduced to simple analogies of those larger contexts.
