<plain_text><page sequence="1">Philosophy and Humanism: Renaissance Essays in Honor of Paul Oskar Kristeller. Edited by Edward P. Mahoney. New York: Columbia University Press, 1976. Pp. xxvi+624. $45.00. The compilation of a festschrift is always an arduous task, and it is a particularly arduous one when the honored recipient happens to be a scholar of the prominence of Paul Oskar Kristeller. The editor of this festschrift, or rather the two successive editors and the many editorial collaborators mentioned in the preface, deserve considerable praise for having carried out this task with courage and determination. They have kept the number of contributions down to a manageable size by limiting participation to those admirers and disciples who have had some connection with Kristeller's own Columbia University--and they have done so rightly realizing that many of those here listed in the long tabula gratulatoria would be represented in the several other festschrifts being planned concurrently. They have also suc- ceeded in imposing upon the various authors a fairly uniform format. Except for one contribution that claims to describe "one of the fundamental bases of the modern intellectual world" (p. 69), and except for another that claims to have discovered the "watershed between the Medieval Aristotelian tradi- tion and Renaissance thought" (p. 70), most of the articles are strictly monographic in scope. Either they study a single, carefully circumscribed historical problem, or they offer personal reflections or philological explana- tions of a previously unpublished document, which often then appears in an appendix. Better yet, the editors have succeeded in eliciting a number of contribu- tions that are directly related to Kristeller's scholarly interests. Several of the appended documents are among those that were first identified in his famous Iter and several of those discovered independently by the authors themselves are presented according to philological standards that he could easily recognize as his own--for example, Eugene Rice on Lefevre d'Etaples's De Magia and Felix Gilbert on the testament of Gianpietro Stella. Some of the articles explore themes or theses that he previously proposed. For instance, Edward Mahoney and William Edwards provide further evidence for the impact of humanism upon philosophic and scientific thought, all the while maintaining Kristeller's distinction between Renais- sance philosophy and humanism. F. Edward Crantz assesses the lasting influence of Averroes upon sixteenth-century Aristotelianism. Joseph Soudek weighs the importance of one of Leonardo Bruni's Aristotle transla- tions on the basis of a score of library catalogues. George Parks and Morimichi Watanabe present still other cases of the transmission of Italian</page><page sequence="2">326 Book Reviews humanism to northern Europe. And two of the articles that regard topics foreign to Kristeller's interests-those of the late Raymond de Roover and of Julius Kirshner on the relation between economics and jurisprudence and moral theology-are written with a rigor of textual analysis and a felicity of style that are perfectly consonant with his own remarkable blend of schol- arship and elegance. Unfortunately, the editors have been somewhat less successful in eliminat- ing editorial and methodological contradictions among the texts they re- ceived. One author, apparently for rhetorical reasons, attempts to re(luce all the various positions in a sixteenth-century debate under such twentieth- century categones as .'orthodox" and "liberal" (or "liberal-socialist"). while another author (p. 449) specifically denounces such anachronisms as dangerously misleading. Several others use period concepts ("an extraordi- narily complex, truly Baroque structure" [p. 1751), metaphors ("theological guts" [p. 65]), and combinations of nouns ("predictable future significance," "collection of evidences" [pp. 91, 2581) that will be intelligible only to specialists. Some of the authors seem to assume that any document is worth editing simply because it has not previously appeared in print-or because of "a variety of smallish reasons" (p. 283) that are usually not given. Their documentary appendices accordingly consist merely of one of the sources used in their recent books or dissertations. Others remain faithful to a pre-Kristellerian notion of Ideengeschichte-one that sanctions paraphrases of a series of arbitrarily selected documents with no more attention given to the "milieu and circumstances" (p. 221) of their composition than what can be deduced from the text itself. Still others seek to explain the peculiarities they find in their subjects by reference to such metahistorical concepts as a "Counter Reformation''--concepts which in one case lead the author to affirm that everything written in the realm of political philosophy after the establishment of the Holy Office is utterly insincere (pp. 165 ff.). A few of the authors, moreover, seem to have forgotten Kristeller's axiom that historiography is a cumulative discipline. One qualifies a historical problem as "not yet illuminated" even today, notwithstanding a formidable body of recent scholarship, simply because some authoritative predecessor said it was in 1935 (p. 229). Another charges Lorenzo Valla with worshiping an ".anthropomorphic" deity (p. 227), notwithstanding the very different con- clusions reached in several recent monographs that are mentioned in the footnotes but nowhere discussed. Several others pack a hundred years of titles into an introductory footnote only to ignore them all completely in the body of the article. It may be that recent Ph.D.'s simply can no longer be dissuaded, in these days of academic recession, from trying to "break into print" prematurely-and thus from putting forth as an article what is really just an expanded footnote from a dissertation. It may be that established scholars can no longer be persuaded to bury their original contributions to schol- arship in a volume that bears, not their name, but the name of a colleague. Or, on the other hand, it may be that the festschrift, as a means either of communicating the results of scholarly research or of honoring an eminent scholar, actually belongs to a less costly, more leisurely age that has at last passed once and for all into the realm of history.
