"Methods in Drama Criticism." CompD , 14 (Fall 1980) , 230-239. A review essay of Richard Levin's New Readings vs . Old Plays : Recent Trends in the Reinterpretation of English Drama (Chicago: Univer- sity of Chicago Press, 1979). Battenhouse defends "thematic," "ironic," and "historical" critics against Levin's charge that the thematist replaces a literal subject with an ab- stract concept, that the ironist "assassinates" characters by suggesting that their significance is not necessarily to be taken at "face value," and that the historicists endanger plays by their "orthodox pieties." On the contrary, Batten- house says, "Thoughtful people have recognized in great art depths of import and resonance that await the receptivity of a well-tuned ear and understanding mind. ... If English studies were to accept the reductive impressionism here advocated, they could become dismal indeed." [rpd] 6379 Caspar, Ruth. '"All Shall Be Well': Prototypical Symbols of Hope." JHI , 42 (1981), 139-50. Studies pre-Christian hope as a part of Fortune in Tibullus's poetry, Suetonius' Lives, and the secular emblems of Alciati. Chris- tian hope in the Revelations of Julian of Norwich, as in Eliot's use of the latter in "Little Gidding," is eschato- logical in its assurance that God will bring good out of evil. [GW] 6380 Cherry, C. Conrad. Nature and Religious Imagination: From Edwards to Bushnell . Philadelphia: Fortress Press, 1980. 242 pp. $12.95. Cherry describes the appear- ance of a symbolic-imaginative response to nature in the work of Jonathan Edwards; its subsequent decline through a period of moralism, legalism, and rationalism; and its re- surgence in the religious romanticism of Horace Bushnell. 6381 Dawson, Jan C. "Puritanism in American Thought and Society: 1865-1910." NEQ, 53 (Dec. 1980), 508-26. Although not dealing with specific American authors, this essay, through an analysis of periodical articles and other public statements, traces the fate of Puritan values in postbellum America, as Puritanism came to represent modera- tion in an era of extravagances. [ERL] 6382 Dixon, John W. , Jr. Art and the Theological Imagina- tion. New York: Seabury, 1978. 165 pp. $12.95. Dixon explores the nature of theology and its relationship to narrative and art. 6383 Frye, Roland Mushat. "Metaphors, Equations, and the Faith." ThT, 37 (April 1980), 59-67. By observing the ways of seeing reality in art, science, history, and theology, Frye concludes that "Wherever we look, we en- counter a growing recognition of pervasive mystery, of the limits of our ability to define" and that this recognition "separates us from that isometric modern age which lies Bibliography /115</page><page sequence="4">behind us." With this recognition, metaphor becomes again "a respected tool of thought." [BB] 6384 Lojek, Helen Heusner. "Ministers and Their Sermons in American Literature." DAI , 38 (August 1977), 787A-88A. A study of how portrayals of ministers in American novels reflect historical trends observable in the American church. 6385 Maresca, Thomas E. Three English Epics : Studies of "Troilus and Criseyde , " "The Faerie Queene , " and "Paradise Lost." Lincoln: University of Nebraska Press, 1979. 222 pp. $15.95. Drawing from medieval commentaries on Virgil by Fulgentius and Bernardus Sylvestris and the Renaissance allegorical interpretation by Cristoforo Landino, Maresca takes the thematic motif of the descent to hell, emphasized strongly in those early interpretations, as the dominant influence on the idea of epic as understood by major English poets. In Spenser's The Faerie Queene, Milton's Para- dise Lost , and (surprisingly) Chaucer's Troilus and Criseyde , "hell" is not just the underworld, but any condition, in Neoplatonic terms, apart from God. Hell is active, fragmented, temporary life, as opposed to static, complete, eternal co- existence with God. 6386 Nelson, Bill. "Evil as Illusion in the Detective Story." Clues , 1 (Spring 1980) , 9-14. The nature of evil is examined in relation to Wilkie Collins' The Moonstone and Graham Greene's Brighton Rock. Evil can be seen as illusion and good as the absence of illusion. Collins finds illusions in religion, superstition, and the exclusively rational; Greene treats the illusions of humanism. [DEM] 6387 Patterson, W . Brown. "Protestant Poetics." SR, 88 (Fall 1980), 651-54. This is a review essay of F. L. Huntley's Bishop Joseph Hall, 1574-1656; B. K. Lewalski ' s Protestant Poetics and the Seventeenth-Century Religious Lyric ; I . Rivers ' s Classical and Christian Ideas in English Renaissance Poetry ; and A. D. Weiner' s Sir Philip Sidney and the Poetics of Protestantism. The reviewer holds that the books "demonstrate that there was an English Protestant ethos which helped to give shape to some of the finest literary performances of the Elizabethan and early Stuart periods. [MÉM] 6388 Ready, Karen, and Franz Rottensteiner. "Other Worlds, Otherworldliness : Science Fiction and Religion." ChCent , 90 (December 5, 1973) , 1192-95. Science fiction finds much of its fascination in its potential as a partner in the speculation about the future of religion. 6389 Routley, Erik. A Panorama of Christian Hymnody . Col- legeville, Minn.: The Liturgical Press, 1979. 259 pp. $29.50. A collection of hymns without music organized his- torically with commentary on the period, the writer, and the text. Bibliography / 116</page><page sequence="5">6390 Routley, Erik. An English-Speaking Hymnal Guide. Collegeville, Minn.: The Liturgical Press, 1979. 125 pp. $29.50. A reference companion volume to A Panorama of Christian Hymnody which gives background information on 888 hymns selected from 26 hymnals. The introduction pro- vides a bibliographic essay on major studies in hymnology. 6391 Schorsch, Anita and Martin Greif. The Morning Stars Sang: The Bible in Popular and Folk Art. New York: Universe Books, 1978. 128 pp. $12.95. The authors examine biblical themes in folk and popular art of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, most in New England. ANCIENT AND MEDIEVAL TO 1500 6392 Burnley, J.D. Chaucer ' s Language and the Philosopher ' s Tradition . Chaucer Studies, 2. Totowa, N.J.: Rowman and Littlefield, 1979. 196 pp. $30.00. Burnley's work is a study of words and ideas that Chaucer and other medieval writers associated with concepts of the tyrant, the philoso- pher, and the "gentil man." The first two concepts, as de- veloped in Roman antiquity, were enlarged by medieval authors to accommodate specifically Christian values. Burnley shows how the language describing these figures was transferred by Chaucer to nonpolitical fields, and he uses these two types to introduce a sense of how emotions both within and beyond the sanction of reason were defended in Christian moral psy- chology. The author's third focal concept is that of the "gentil man" - a figure who represents a Christian ethic turned secular. This figure becomes a symbol poised delicately be- tween the Roman ideas of tyrant and philosopher. 6393 Dales, Richard C. "The De-Animation of the Heavens in the Middle Ages." JHI, 41 (1980), 531-50. Traces the arguments for and against the idea of intelligent heavenly spheres through the Middle Ages from Aristotle's immediate influence, through the Church Fathers, to late medieval enunciations of the Church. Ancient thought attributed life and divinity to heavenly bodies; the medieval Church denied them, fearing idolatry. Nevertheless, although most exegetes denied the intelligence of the spheres, the idea remained popular through the seventeenth century. [GW] 6394 Forsyth, Neil Robert. "The Powers of Darkness Bound: The Rise to Power of Satan in Early Christian History and His Role in Paradise Lost." DAI , 38 (August 1977), 803A. This dissertation begins with a study of the process by which the early Church Fathers invented a coherent mythology that included Satan and Evil but disallowed the dualistic heresies of the time. It then shows how Milton's Satan is a legacy of the dualism found in the early age of the Church. 6395 Frantzen, Allen John. "The Keys of Heaven: Penance, Penitentials, and the Literature of Early Medieval Bibliography /117</page><page sequence="6">England." DAI , 37 (January 1977), 4343A. This study takes as its subject the literary history of penance in England from the founding of Lindisfarne to the eve of the Norman Conquest. 6396 Gardner, Tom Cole. "The Theater of Hell: A Critical Study of Some Twelfth-Century Latin Eschatological Visions." DAI , 38 (August 1977), 778A. A critical examina- tion of the literary purposes of vision writers and of how the grotesque style helps them achieve those purposes, with an emphasis on The Vision of Túndale and The Vision of Thür kill . 6397 Greetham, D.C. "The Concept of Nature in Bartholomaeus Anglicus (Fl. 1230)." JHI, 41 (1980), 663-77. A close look at the medieval encyclopedia De Proprietatibus Rerum of Bartholomaeus reveals a contrast in rhetorical presentation: on the one hand there is a sense of wonder with the plentitude and detail of God's creation; on the other hand aspects of nature least understood are invented and hyperbolized. Here, "'all nature is . . . a book of tropes cleverly arranged by the Creator to teach both logic and morality.'" First trans- lated into English in 1398, then revised in 1582, the ency- clopedia remained a source book through the English Renaissance. [GW] 6398 Hyers, Conrad. "Prometheus and the Problem of Progress." ThT , 37 (October 1980) , 323-34. Hyers examines the relationship of the stories of Adam and Prometheus to the idea of human progress. [bb] 6399 Meagher, John Henry, III. "The Castle and the Virgin in Medieval and Early Renaissance Drama." DAI , 37 (May 1977) , 7122A-23A. Examines architectural metaphor and set- ting in civic pageants, religious processions, and selected religious plays, and shows their symbolic links to the Virgin. 6400 Pasch, William Allen. "Trinitarian Symbolism and Med- ieval English Drama." DAI , 38 (October 1977), 2108A. A study of how the Christian doctrine of the Trinity as a God who is simultaneously three Persons in one Essence influenced Middle English drama. 6401 Peck, George Terhune. The Fool of God: Jacopone da Todi . University: University of Alabama Press, 1980. 246 pp. $22.50. After a depiction of the cultural and social milieu of Todi in the 13th century and an attempt to recon- struct Jacopone 's life from the few surviving facts, Peck launches into an extended presentation of the three stages in Jacopone 's life (after his conversion in 1268) and poetic production. In the first he is the remorseful penitent in- veighing against worldly pleasures and describing its contam- inated state; in the second, while deeply engaged in the internal turmoil of the Franciscan order and vehemently opposed to Pope Boniface VIII, he is imprisoned and there Bibliography / 118</page><page sequence="7">attains to a level of sanctity through divine illumination; and in the third he transcends the earthly, achieving mystical union with God through meditation and becoming thereby a "fool of God," filled with holy madness. 6402 Pollard, William Frank, Jr. "Franciscan Exemplarism in Gawain and the Green Knight." DAI, 37 (June 1977), 7766A. Franciscan Exemplarism provides a key for theological inquiry into a poem rich in Celtic myth, Arthurian romance, and Christian theology, giving a consistent reading of the poem as an ordered reflection of an ordered theological per- spective. 6403 Pritchard, Gretchen Wolff. "Law, Love, and Incarnation; An Interpretation of Piers Plowman." DAI, 38 (July 1977), 286A-87A. This dissertation examines Piers Plowman B to show the function of the dialectic of law and love and its rhetor- ical and structural projections. It concludes that the recur- ring thematic and stylistic sequence is an intimation of and preparation for the appearance of Christ and conversion of Piers in a manner analogous to the function of allegorical "figures" or types in Scripture. 6404 Reiss, Edmund. William Dunbar . TEAS 257. Boston: Twayne, 1979. 183 pp. $11.50. Reiss' s study points out medieval commonplaces, especially Christian dogma, in Dunbar's writings. Every poem attributed to Dunbar is dis- cussed in some way. 6405 Russell, Ray. "The 'Wicked Bibles.'" ThT, 37 (October 1980) , 360-63. Rpt. "The 'Wicked Bibles' or Let Him Who is Without Sin Among You Cast the First Line of Type." Verbatim ("The Language Quarterly"), 6 (Spring 1980), 1-2. A survey of the printer's errors responsible for some unique editions of the Bible. [BB] 6406 Sargent, Anne Marie. "The Penitent Prostitute; The Tradition and Evolution of the Life of St. Mary the Egyptian. " DAI, 38 (September 1977), 1375A-76A. A study tracing the evolution of the legend of St. Mary the Egyptian, showing how the three hagiographie traditions it combines - the ascetic tradition of the lives of the desert fathers, the penitential tradition of Mary Magdalene and the lives of con- verted prostitutes, and the Marian miracle tradition - were emphasized differently in different ages. 6407 Schmidt, A.V.C. "Langland 's Structural Imagery." EIC, 30 (October 1980) , 311-25. Langland saw the great problems of his day in essentially religious terms. Schmidt discusses the single strain of food and drink imagery in its religious context as a main thematic concern in Piers Plowman. Bibliography / 119</page><page sequence="8">6408 Schotter, Anne Howland. "The Sacramental and Satirical Use of Formulas of Luxury in Middle English Alliterative Poetry." DAI , 37 (January 1977), 4344A. A study of the de- tailed descriptions of feasts, clothing, and buildings which are so striking in alliterative poems. Each chapter traces the biblical models behind the contrasting attitudes of satirically and sacramentally using the formulas of luxury for their subjects - feasts, clothing, and buildings respec- tively . 6409 Solo, Harry Jay. "The Lesson of the Grave: The Old English Memento Mori and Its Early Medieval Background." DAI , 37 (February 1977), 5108A. This study develops a general description of the lesson of the tomb as it appears in the moral literature of the fourth through eleventh centuries and applies that description to the interpretation of the portrait of the grave in the Old English Soul ' s Address to Its Body . 6410 Spearing, A.C. "Purity and Danger." EIC, 30 (October 1980), 293-310. Social anthropologist Mary Douglas' book Purity and Danger offers valuable help in understanding the group of linked narratives which constitutes the Gawain Poet's "Purity." The biblical episodes of Abraham and Lot, Belshazzar, Noah's ark, and Jonah are discussed in celebration of Clannes as opposed to Fylthe . 6411 Tannenbaum, Maria Anita Gargotta. "Attitudes on Illicit Love in Literature from Pagan Latinity to the Christian Middle Ages." DAI , 37 (March 1977), 5806A-07A. A study of illicit love in literature from early Latin literature to writings of the Christian Middle Ages, with a section on the popular Provencal and French literature, examining the relation to moral, social, and religious standards. 6412 Williams, Peter Neville. "Satan and His Corpus : Cul- tural Symbolism in the English Mystery Plays." DAI , 37 (March 1977), 5813A. A study of the dramatic structure of the English Medieval Mystery Plays . The nature of the plays is determined from an examination of the moral, dramatic, and religious premises the dramatists worked under. The Satan myth, particularly the corpus diaboli , was used by the drama- tists to create effective contemporary symbols out of the Satanic biblical characters. SIXTEENTH CENTURY 6413 Guy, William Harvey. "Spenser's Use of the Bible in Books 1 and 2 of The Faerie Queene." DAI , 37 (May 1977), 7141A-42A. Determines how biblical material contributes to the meaning of Books One and Two by reconstructing a contem- porary exegetical tradition around each biblical reference. 6414 Hardison, O.B., Jr. "Logic Versus the Slovenly World in Shakespearean Comedy." S Q, 31 (Autumn 1980), 311-22. Shakespearean comedy emerged from a complex mixture of tradi- Bibliography /120</page><page sequence="9">tions which included plot borrowings from classical drama, but which was essentially based on the irrationality, exuber- ance, and joy of medieval religious drama. Consequently, English critics for two centuries found their hearts drawn to Shakespeare but their heads repelled by his neo-classical violations. [JWF] 6415 Hassel, R. Chris, Jr. "'All Hail, Macbeth!" LangQ, 12 (1974), 43. Hassel sees echoes, in the witches' greeting to Macbeth, of the words of Judas when he betrayed Christ, "Hail master." This allusion is strengthened by frequent (17) repetitions of "Hail" in Macbeth . 6416 Osmański, Edna Ann. "'Paradice 's Only Map'" Time and Eternity in the Pastoral Poetry of Edmund Spenser and Andrew Marvell." DAI, 37 (April 1977), 6507A. Central to this study of Spenserian and Marvellian pastoral is the assertion that Renaissance pastoral is concerned primarily with a juxtaposition of time and eternity, a conjunction subsuming the themes of otium, ideal or corrupt love, eccles- iastical satire, and the practice of poetry itself. As the basis of the pastoral contrast, time and eternity create a context for aesthetic, moral, and spiritual responses to the tension inherent in man's position as a creature of earth and heaven. 6417 Silva, John de Oliveira e. "The Arcadias of Sir Philip Sidney in the Context of the Dianas of Jorge de Monte- mayor and Gaspar Gil Polo: Religious Themes and the Language of Love." DAI, 38 (September 1977), 1418A Shows how Sidney affirmed the integrity of human intellect without denying the efficacy of providence, themes raised and disputed in the Dianas . 6418 Slights, Camille. "In Defense of Jessica: The Runaway Daughter in The Merchant of Venice . " SQ, 31 (Autumn 1980), 357-68. A careful examination of Shakespeare's play shows that Jessica is neither greedy nor frivolous and that her undeniable disloyalty must be weighed against her positive role as an exemplar of change and as a beneficiary of human generosity and kind fortune. She causes pain but also demon- strates personal growth and society's vitality. [JWF] 6419 Taylor, William Leigh, Jr. "Protestant Theology in George Herbert's The Temple . " DAI, 37 (March 1977), 5858A. This study of the pointedly Christocentric theology which underlies The Temple claims for Herbert a general Protestant and specifically Calvinist outlook which denies the fundamental claims of the medieval church, enunciating instead a theology of revelation and of the Cross . SEVENTEENTH CENTURY 6420 Bradshaw, Graham. "Three Poems Ben Jonson Did Not Write: A Note of Jonson 's Christian Humanism." ELH, 47 (Fall 1980), 484-99. Jonson 's religious concerns cannot be deduced Bibliography /121</page><page sequence="10">from three bad devotional poems negligently attributed to him. Rather, his values as expressed in "To Penshurst" and other poems in The Forest are those of classical Christian humanism. [RAC] 6421 Danielson, Dennis R. "Imago Dei, 'Filial Freedom,' and Miltonie Theodicy." ELH, 47 (Winter 1980), 670-81. Milton's presentation of the divine image of man, his deli- cate handling of full, incompatibilist freedom with respect to the Fall; his view of the essential goodness and hence necessary justice of God are all remarkable and each rein- forces the poetic theodicy of Paradise Lost . But it is not clear how Milton or any Christian theologian can consistently be granted all three. [RAC] 6422 Fresch, Cheryl Hope. "Milton's Eve and the Theological Tradition." DAI , 37 (March 1977), 5846A-47A. This dissertation studies Milton's characterization of Eve by relating the personality and actions of the woman in Paradise Lost to traditional theological concepts of Eve. Milton's Eve evidences the poet's familiarity with Catholic, Protestant, and Hebraic commentaries on Eve. 6423 Goodman, Ellen. "The Design of Milton's World: Nature and the Fall in Christian Genesis Commentary and Para- dise Lost. " DAI , 38 (July 1977), 278A-79A. An exploration into the relationship between Milton's portrayal of nature in Paradise Lost and the Fall. 6424 Greene, Edward Patrick. "The 'Benefit of Affliction' : Verbal Continuity and Doctrinal Themes in Herbert and Milton." DAI , 37 (February 1977), 5141A-42A. A study of the use of affliction (physical or mental suffering that entails a crisis of faith) in Milton's and Herbert's poetry. Includes central metaphors, history of the meaning for "affliction," and an examination of the use of biblical passages in the poetry. 6425 Heinemann, Margot. Puritanism and Theatre : Thomas Middleton and Opposition Drama under the Early Stuarts . Past and Present Publications. Cambridge: Cambridge Univer- sity Press, 1980. 300 pp. $27.50. The larger concerns of this book are in accord with Christopher Hill's outlook that the Puritans must be liberated from the charges of cultural deprivation. In their own way, the Puritans were as supportive of the arts as any other movement. Accordingly, Heinemann shows how Thomas Middleton, as a professional dramatist of the London scene, fostered the Nonconformist perspective. 6426 Miller, Joseph Robert. "The Counter Reformation and English Poetry of the Renaissance." DAI , 37 (February 1977) , 5145A-46A. This study is prepared in three parts: first, a look at the Counter Reformation in general and its literary influence; second, an examination of the character- Bibliography /122</page><page sequence="11">istic topics and attitudes of Counter-Re formation devotion, including consideration of devotional verse and prose; and third, an intensive study of one of the most complete and characteristic manifestations of Counter-Reformation spirituality, the devotional literature of tears. 6427 Muldrow, George M. "Satan's Last Words: 'Full Bliss.'" MiltonQ, 14 (October 1980), 98-100. Satan's promise of "full bliss" for his followers in Book X of PL derives from his elation in successfully tempting Adam and Eve. Yet the subsequent chorus of hisses in response to his plans underscores Satan's misguided attempt to provide what only the Son of God can at the Last Judgment. [JWF] 6428 Sabre, Susan Langworthy. "The Separation of the Divine from the Natural: A Perspective on the Thought of Francis Bacon, 1584-1609." DAI, 38 (August 1977), 812A. This study examines Bacon's early writings through 1609, inclusive of Des Sapientia Veterum, in order to demonstrate both Bacon's continuing concern with the separation of the world of the divine from the world of the natural and the essentially Puritan nature of this concern. 6429 Yaghjian, Lucretia Bailey. "The Poet and the Church: Visible Shapes and Invisible Images of Ecclesia in the Early Poetry and Prose of John Milton, 1634-1645." DAI , 37 (June 1977), 7770A-71A. John Milton's early poetry and prose - specifically Comus , Lycidas , and the Anti-Prelatical tracts - reveal the poet's indebtedness to the Reformation doctrine of the visible-invisible church and the polemicist's enunciation of a creative ecclesiology deserving considera- tion in its own right. 6430 Yearwood, Stephenie O'Brien. "Theology and Poetry: Donne and Herbert in the Christian Tradition." DAI , 37 (June 1977) , 7771A. On the nature and status of religious poetry in the Christian tradition, specifically examining its nature and status for Donne and Herbert. Includes an examin- ation of their poetry as it reflects both the traditional suspicion of language and the artistically liberating belief that human words can convey the divine word. EIGHTEENTH CENTURY 6431 Batschelet, Margaret Susan. "Jonathan Edwards' Use of Typology: A Historical and Theological Approach." DAI , 38 (December 1977) , 3493A-94A. This dissertation ex- amines the use of typology in Puritan thought with emphasis on Edwards' works. Two kinds of typology are suggested: the Old Testament type/New Testament antitype relationship and the typology that is an ongoing process, that may be fulfilled beyond the New Testament in the soul of the believer.

Shows the influence of classical and Christian literary traditions on the art of dying in some of the biographies of Johnson. Suggests that Boswell may have suppressed some of the facts in order to make John- son's death appear to fit the traditional pattern of the death of a good man. [HRD] 6433 Ehlers, Leigh A. "Mrs. Shandy's 'Lint and Basilicon' : The Importance of Women in Tristram Shandy . " SAB, 46 (January 1981) , 61-75. Women in the novel, despite the dominant male viewpoint, are invested with considerable, though untapped, restorative powers through their properly Christian roles in the male-female relationship. The novel envisions the unrealized possibility of a truly humanistic yet Christian household in which men and women coexist in harmony, love, and respect. [PSV] 6434 Rivers, Cheryl. "Cotton Mather's Biblia Americana Psalms and the Nature of Puritan Scholarship." DAI, 38 (July 1977), 267A-68A. An examination of Mather's scholar- ship as illustrated in his Biblia Americana , with the goal to better understand both Mather and his age. 6435 Talarico, Nicholas Anthony, Jr. "Christopher Smart's The Parables of Our Lord: The Architecture of an Enchiridion. " DAI , 38 (September 1977), 1419A. An examina- tion of Smart's important devotional work, including a study of the evolution of the definitions of allegory, fable, and parable and the rationale for joining Smart's book to the tradition of enchiridia, or "conduct book." 6436 Wolfe, George Hubert. "Lessons in Virtue: Fielding and the Ethical Imperative." DAI , 38 (August 1977), 814A. A study of Fielding's writings in the light of his purpose to show the consequences of evil and the benefits of right, Christian behavior. NINETEENTH CENTURY 6437 Auerbach, Nina. "The Rise of the Fallen Woman." NCF , 35 (June 1980), pp. 29-52. The "fallen woman," a per- vasive presence in Victorian literature, combines the sexual trespass of Milton's Eve with the doom of his Satan. [DWC] 6438 Bennett, Benjamin. "The Classical, The Romantic, and the Tragic in Part Two of Goethe's Faust. " SIR, 19, No. 4 (Winter 1980) , 529-50. Faust is meant to be a complete fusion of the Classical and Romantic artistic consciousnesses, and thus a paradigm for true modern tragedy. In effect, Faust enables the Romantic reader to re-experience the intimate connection between religion and poetry that had prevailed in ancient Greece.

Blakes ' s The Ghost of Abel (1822), a poetic reply to Byron's Cain (1821), contains the same psychic concerns as Byron's play; it treats the same issues raised with urgency and skill in Cain. Byron's play, in fact, constitutes a searching examination of the psychology of a state of "Generation," Lucifer playing a role like that of fallen Urizen. [PSV] 6440 Cox, James M. "Learning through Ignorance: The Educa- tion of Henry Adams . " SR, 88 (Spring 1980), 198-227. A portion of this essay concerns Adam's Mont-Saint -Michel and Chartres and its relation to The Education of Henry Adams . Mont-Saint-Michel and the years 1150-1250 represent a unity which is the point of reference for the multiplicity of the 20th century Education. The Virgin Mary who inspired the church at Chartres represents this emotional unity which is translated into logical terms by St. Thomas Aquinas. [MMM] 6441 Duban, James. "Melville and Christianity: His Mas- querade." DAI, 37 (March 1977), 5825A-26A. The discussion of Melville and Christianity utilizes historical, literary, and theological contextualism to clarify Melville's critique of American political millennialism in Redburn ; his use of Christian apologetics in Moby Dick; his satire of transcendentalism in Pierre; and his sceptical evaluation, in The Confidence-Man , of the way that New England Calvinism turned into Arminianism and Unitarianism in the 18th and early 19th centuries. 6442 Egan, Joseph J. "Lions Rampart: Agricola and Bras- Coupé as Antithetical Doubles in The Grandissimes. " SoQ, 18, No. 4 (Summer 1980) , 74-80. The Creole Agricole and the Black Bras-Coupé are paired. They "both espouse their own stylized 'religions,' although even in death neither has any use for the services of a representative of orthodoxy - a Roman Catholic priest." One is "'the aged high priest of a doomed civilization, '" the otherf "a voudou, who 'hears the voice of zombis . ' " "The spiritual and psychological ruin that antagonism brings to the life of man" is treated. [GWVD] 6443 Grant, Philip Bernard. "Blake's The Everlasting Gospel: An Edition and Study." DAI , 37 (January 1977), 4366A- 67A. This dissertation contains important background material on The Everlasting Gospel, a poem written late in Blake's career and left in manuscript. It attempts to create a con- text for explication by discussing Jesus' role in Jerusalem and three motifs central to the imagination's liberation for Blake. 6444 Jay, Elisabeth. The Religion of the Heart : Anglican Evangelicalism and the Nineteenth-Century Novel . New York: Oxford University Press, 1979. 297 pp. $36.50. The Bibliography /125</page><page sequence="14">first two-thirds of this book offers a detailed portrait of the beliefs, practices, and social impact of Anglican Evan- gelicalism. Jay's aim is to enable readers to recognize literary distortions of Evangelicalism when they encounter them (e.g., in Dickens) and also to appreciate what is at stake in fictional treatments of Evangelicalism by authors concerned with its intricacies. The final chapters on George Eliot, Thornycroft Hall ("an Evangelical answer to Jane Eyre"), and Samuel Butler demonstrate the value such thorough knowledge of Evangelicalism can have for readers today. 6445 Joyce, John J. "Transcendentalism, Song, and Cosmic Light in Browning's Men and Women [1863, 1868]." Cithara, 20, No. 1 (November 1980) , 16-25. Browning presents his version of transcendentalism by using an introductory poem and twelve monologues in which cosmic light imagery is used to symbolize the moral or religious insight (transcendentalism in Browning's terminology) inherent in each of the speakers. [HRD] 6446 Keller, Karl. The Only Kangaroo Among the Beauty: Emily Dickinson and America. Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press, 1979. 340 pp. $18.50. Like Anne Brad- street, Emily Dickinson found salvation in her woman's inward- ness and her poetic expression of selfhood. From Edward Taylor's Puritan spirit, not doctrine, she constructed her own myth of the Puritan. Liberated by art, and from Jonathan Edwards' tragic sense, she developed an American stoicism. For her and Hawthorne, reality was ambiguous and uncertain - too much so for Emily to accept Harriet Beecher Stowe's millenialism or to join the activist reform movements of her day. Emerson's influence is defined as a stimulus to self- confidence, to aphorism, to bold questioning and creating, but not to an Emersonian perspective. 6447 Kirchhoff, Frederick. "The Aesthetic Discipline of The Earthly Paradise." VP, 18 (Autumn 1980), 229-40. By revising his Prologue to The Earthly Paradise William Morris rejected his moral allegory, replacing a common-sense priv- ileging of reality over illusion with a deconstructive dia- lectic between imagination and realism. Morris suggests his new aesthetic by having the Wanderers first tell their own story and then other stories to give it a literary context. [ jwf] 6.448 Levine, George. "George Eliot's Hypothesis of Reality." NCF, 35 (June 1980), pp. 1-28. Eliot's "hypothesis of reality," a unified world, is derived from the Book of Daniel. Daniel Deronda is an attempt to reconcile this ideal with empirical truth. [DWC] 6449 Lojek, Helen. "The Southern Lady Gets a Divorce: 'Saner Feminism' in the Novels of Amélie Rives." SLJ, 12, No. 1 (Fall 1979), 47-69. Rives's article "Innocence Bibliography /126</page><page sequence="15">Versus Ignorance" (1892) favored "'moral education of young girls,'" including religious education. [OWO] 6450 Loomis, Jeffrey B. "Chatter with a Just Lord: Hopkins' Final Sonnets of Quiescent Terror." HQ, 7 (Summer 1980), pp. 47-64. An examination of Hopkins' "under thought" belies the apparent cynicism and despair of "Thou art indeed just, Lord" and "The shepherd's brow." [DWC] 6451 Long, Larry Ray. "Waiden and the Bible: A Study in Influence and Composition." DAI, 37 (May 1977), 7130A. Examines the use of the Bible in Waiden and its influence in the changing form of Waiden as it moved from the Journal to the finished text. Includes three appendices with source materials for further study. 6452 Seland, John Joseph. "Hopkins and the Eucharist." DAI, 37 (June 1977) , 7768A. An examination of the role of the Eucharist in Hopkins' personal life - the strength and comfort it offered and its part in his decision to convert to Catholicism - and in his writings. 6453 Sitterson, Joseph C., Jr. "'Unmeaning Miracles' in 'The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.'" SAB, 46 (January 1981) , 16-25. Coleridge's glosses to Parts Five and Six are fertile in unmeaning miracles which are deliberate and de- ceptive invitations to allegorical representations. Both Catholic and Neoplatonic elements, then, co-exist, so that, ultimately, the poem does not question the reality of sin and spiritual suffering, but it does question whether such mysteries are subject to systematic human understanding. [PSV] 6454 Stephens, Robert 0. "Cable's Madame Delphine and the Compromise of 1877." SLJ, 12, No. 1 (Fall 1979), 78-91. The priest Pere Jerome likens "Saint Paul ' s complicity in the death of Saint Stephen to the guilt of New Orleans in 1821 and by extension to the responsibility of the entire nation after 1877." [GWVD] 6455 Sykes, Brian John. "'Sin without God': The Self in Transition in Victorian Literature." DAI, 37 (April 1977) , 6457A. Study of the self in transition as reflected in selected works of Eliot, Arnold, Tennyson, and Browning, with some allusion, by contrast and comparison, to Camus and Beckett and the literature of the absurd. 6456 Tzougros, Penelope. "'The selfless self of self' in Hopkins' Two Beautiful Young People." HQ, 7 (Spring 1980) , pp. 5-8. Hopkins draws a distinction between "the bare self" and the individual in this poem. Only the virtuous are truly alive, and the center of virtue is Christ. [DWC] 6457 Updike, John. "On Hawthorne's Mind." NYRB, 28 (March 19, 1981), 41-42. Hawthorne's religious beliefs cannot Bibliography /127</page><page sequence="16">be articulated from an examination of his statements or practice, but his works reveal a dualism between matter and spirit which Hawthorne took from Christianity. Haunted by the ideas of Providence and guilt, Hawthorne transmuted them into non-orthodox forms, for the former "seems to be his sensation of inner delicacy projected outward upon the universe" and the latter appears "without any corroborating conviction of sin." Yet, "he believed, with his Puritan ancestors, that man's spirit matters; that the soul can be distorted, stained, and lost; that the impalpable exerts force against the material . " [ JQE] 6458 Wagner, F. J. J. H. Shorthouse . TEAS 275. Boston: Twayne, 1979. 190 pp. $12.95. Joseph Henry Short- house (1834-1903) was a Birmingham manufacturer who wrote fiction. In this work there is a chapter on the once-famous John Inglesant, called an "oblique record" of the author's conversion from the Quaker faith to a culturally richer Anglicanism. His hero, a Cavalier in the English Civil Wars, similarly finds peace in the Church of England. Shorthouse 's rejection of his childhood religion leads Wagner to compare him to George Gissing, Samuel Butler, Mrs. Humphry Ward, and William Hale White, but Wagner does not overlook the inade- quacies of style and thought that kept Shorthouse from attaining the stature of those writers . 6459 Young, Robert Stephen. "Tennyson and Swinburne and the Metaphor of Love: The Quest for Spiritual Values in Nineteenth-Century England." DAI, 38 (November 1977), 2820A. A study of how the Victorian Compromise affected Tennyson and Swinburne, dealing primarily with a comparison of the attempts in their Arthurian poetry to redefine humanistic values through the metaphor of love. 6460 Zanger, Jules. "'The Pit and the Pendulum' and American Revivalism." Rei in Life, 49 (Spring 1980), 96-105. The imagery of this story "in its situational clusters of judgment, punishment, and salvation . . ." may be traced to the Second Awakening through Poe ' s personal exposure in his youth to Awakening Revivalism. Also his critical theory and other fiction derives to some degree from "revivalist tech- niques, based on Jonathan Edwards' adaptation of Lockeian sensationalism to religious ends . " [WSM] TWENTIETH CENTURY 6461 Bartsch, Friedemann Karl. "The Redemptive Vision: Robert Penn Warren and Spiritual Autobiography . " DAI, 38 (October 1977), 2117A-18A. This study concerns itself with a close examination of guilt and innocence in the longer fiction of Warren, and more particularly with the religious archetypal pattern of man's fall and redemption as Warren reinterprets it to fit the secular world of his fiction.

Rilke's Das Studen-Buch "takes the form of a dialogue between a medieval monk and his God, . . . but the 'God' is less a separate entity than 'an esthetic idea, ' a symbol of human despair." In The Woman at the Washington Zoo, Jarrell' s translations of Rilke's poems cover a wide range of themes and subjects, including the preparation of Christ's body for burial. [GWVD] 6463 Bernstein, Mashey Maurice. "The Individual as a Work of Art: Jewish and Puritan Values in the Fiction of Norman Mailer and Edward Lewis Wallant." DAI , 38 (December 1977) , 3494A-95A. Shows how in the novels of Mailer and Wallant the Puritan tradition of relying on individual ex- perience and subjective perceptions for an understanding of truth is linked with the Jewish approach to existence - the belief that action is both holy and meaningful, that they are a key to self-destiny. Includes a similar application of Jewish and Puritan theology to selected works of James and Hawthorne . 6464 Bigger, Charles P. "Walker Percy and the Resonance of the Word." So Q, 18, No. 3 (Spring 1980), 43-54. Percy is treated as a Catholic Christian, a Greek thinker, and a writer "powerfully influenced by the work of Kierkegaard, Sartre, and Camus." [GWVD] 6465 Breganowski, Ronald. "Realms of the Spirit: An Inquiry into Robert Frost's Sense of Place." DAI, 38 (October 1977), 2119A-20A. A study of how Frost's poems reveal a religious consciousness as the poet tends to be dominated by spirit, as he cares more about his relationship to things than about the things themselves. 6466 Buffington, Robert. "Young Hawk Circling." SR, 87 (Fall 1979), 541-56. At the age of 31 Allen Tate wrote, "The rest of my life will be devoted to strengthening the conclusions I have already come to." In religion one conclusion was that, presuming a need for organized religion, Roman Catholicism was the most reasonable choice because it assimilated differing national attitudes and feelings. In his essay "The Fallacy of Humanism," however, he did not argue the claims of Catholicism. Rather he simply held that human- ists needed some form of religion to keep them from being like the naturalists whom they opposed, [mhm] 6467 Burch, Beth. "Shades of the Golden Fleece: Faulkner's Jason Once Again." NMW, 12 (Winter 1980), 55-62. "In The Sound and the Fury, as in many other works, Faulkner drew extensively upon the universality of myth. In the early novel he alludes to the Eden myth, the Christian myth, and various classical myths. ..." Throughout, Jason Compson is linked to the Greek Jason . [GWVD] Bibliography /129</page><page sequence="18">6468 Caldwell, Price. "'Sunday Morning1: Stevens' Makeshift Romantic Lyric." SoR, 15 (Autumn 1979), 933-52. Central to this essay on Wallace Stevens's "Sunday Morning" are Caldwell's views that the poem is not truly in the tra- dition of the Romantic lyric and that "the poem's essential structure is not expressed by the order of its parts." In his expansion of these views Caldwell points out several instances of Stevens's use of the "symbolic patterns [of Christian myth] as model for his own myth." [MHM] 6469 Chappie, Richard L. "The Bible and the Zoo in Andrey Sinyavsky's The Trial Begins." OL, 33 (1978), 349-58. Biblical imagery plays an integral stylistic and thematic role. Simplified Old and New Testament concepts are used as focal points of allegory to expose the theology of the Soviet system and the sanctified person of Stalin. To amplify his discussion of gods, victims, and sacrifices, Sinyavsky also utilizes animal imagery and focusses on the scapegoat and the prison-like aura of the zoo. The biblical conclusions indict the system from a New Testament perspective and expose the gospel, deities, and disciples as tragic imita- tions of ideal originals. 6470 Christensen, Jerome C. "Lancelot: Sign for the Times." SoQ, 18, No. 3 (Spring 1980), 107-20. Love, Christian love, is the answer in Walker Percy's "monologue - now obstreperous, now canny, now pathetic - of a madman, the tale of a brutal negative quest, brutally told." [GWVD] 6471 Coates, John. "The Restoration of the Past and the War of Values: The Image of Don Quixote in Chesterton's Work." CRev, 6 (Spring-Summer 1980), 280-34. The figure of the Knight of the Sad Countenance in Chesterton is represented not only in the novel The Return of Don Quixote , but also elsewhere, and each time he becomes both an image of life and an historical testimony to the Faith, as that faith ex- isted in the Middle Ages. [APLI 6472 Coles, Robert. Flannery O ' Connor ' s South . The Walter Lynwood Fleming Lectures in Southern History. Baton Rouge: Louisiana State University Press, 1980. 166 pp. $14.95.

Davie interweaves reflections on the critics Yvor Winters and F.R. Leavis with his own Christian background. He sees himself, Winters, and Leavis as "Puritans," although Winters and Leavis did not adhere to Christian beliefs. Still they are akin to Puritan zealots in their insistence that in the arts critics must divide the sheep from the goats, the genuine from the fake. [MÉM] 6475 Dean, Michael P. "Ellen Douglas's Small Towns: Fictional Anchors." So Q, 19, No. 1 (Fall 1980), 161-71. Church buildings play important roles in Douglas's writings. (167) 6476 Derrick, Christopher. "Chesterton and the Pursuit of Happiness." CRev, 6 (Spring-Summer 1980), 221-32. Considers the reasons for the current generation's neglect of Chesterton. Many wish to avoid a writer who, "while fully recognizing the evils of this world and the consequent need for protest and even (occasionally) for revolution, be- came that rare thing, a serious prophet and advocate of human happiness . . . , " a position which followed from his religious convictions. [APLI 6477 Donoghue, Dennis. "Listening To The Saddest Story." SR, 88, No. 4 (Fall 1980), 557-71. Ford Madox Ford's citation of the words "Beati Immaculati" (Psalm 119) as an epigraph on the title page of The Good Soldier provides a key to his characterization of the novel's narrator, John Dowell, and to the book's reliance upon elements appropriate to oral narrative. Ford's book mocks the "beati immaculati" - including Dowell himself - of this world who, themselves normal, virtuous, and slightly ridiculous, witness the neo- Darwinian suppression of less ordinary human organisms. [RCP] 6478 Drury, Roger. "Providence at Elrond's Council." Myth lore, 7 (Autumn 1980), 8-9. Gunnar Urang sees in The Lord of the Rings a pattern in history which Christianity traditionally attributes to the providence of God. Drury has found specific examples of this "providential design" in one chapter, "The Council of Elrond," of The Fellowship of the Ring. In it he finds examples of "the co-ordination of complex events, the balance of providential will and individual freedom of choice, and a continuing series of eucatastrophes [happy endings]." [MEM] 6479 Dyson, A. E. "The Poetry of R. S. Thomas." CritQ, 20 (Summer 1978) , 5-31. "Thomas is . . .a poet of the Cross; and the Cross without the exegesis or piety of the ages to help it - more than ever facing us with its own stark- ness, as God's side of the dialogue." 6480 Eubanks, Cecil L. "Walker Percy: Eschatology and the Politics of Grace." SoQ, 18, No. 3 (Spring 1980), 121-36. "... Walker Percy has given us a vivid and compelling image of exile in our modern era.

"Flannery O'Connor's Wise Blood : The Negative Way." SoQ, 17 (Winter 1979), 104-22. Wise Blood can be read as a Christian commedia , which begins as low comedy, "but becomes increasingly other- worldly," as the protagonist follows "the way of rejection" as an approach to God "by which the corrupt society may be redeemed . " 6482 Fickett, Harold. "A Conversation with Poet/Novelist Robert Siegel." ChT, 24 (November 21, 1980), 36-37 [1426-27]. The literary achievement of Robert Siegel thus far suggests the appearance of a new and distinctly gifted writer on the evangelical scene. His poetry transforms images from the worlds of nature and man into moving intim- ations of supernatural experience and truth. In Alpha Centauri he employs a pastoral landscape and its mythic in- habitants - the centaurs - to shadow forth the undeniable need for [Christian] man to present his 'whole body' as a living sacrifice to God. [HG] 6483 Frazier, Adrian. "The Ascendancy Poetry of W. B. Yeats." SR, 88 (Winter 1980), 67-85. Yeats' s advice about suitable subjects for Irish poetry given in his poem "Under Ben Bulben" has been taken by few if any Irish poets. The advice is from one who considered himself as an Ascend- ancy Protestant (Church of Ireland Protestants with large estates, titles of nobility, etc.). No Irish poet, either Catholic or Protestant, would want to continue this tradition. [MHM] 6484 Gandelman, Claude. "Finnegans Wake and the Anthropo- morphic Landscape." JML, 7 (February 1979), 39-50. The underlying structure of Finnegans Wake is constituted of two elements: "on the conscious level . . . the Roman Catholic myth received a new content by being fused with the Freudian kaleidoscopic view of Man, while on the other, the encounter with the Mannerist presentation of Man as an anthropomorphic landscape . . . provided Joyce with pictorial equivalents of his vision and technique for hiding sexual meanings behind topography. ..." 6485 Garnet, Thomas L. "Mysticism in The Ballad of the White Horse . " CRev, 6 (Spring-Summer 1980), 205-11. Because Chesterton had insights into the supernatural meaning of events, he fits the definition of a mystic. The Ballad also conforms to this classical pattern: "Chesterton was a seer as well as a poet, visionary as well as a maker. ..." [apl] 6486 Hall, Theodore Dana.

" ČAPL] 6490 McClure, J. Derrick. "Devil ' s Tor: A Rehabilitation of David Lindsay's 'Monster.'" Extrapolation, 21 (Winter 1980), 367-78. Devil's Tor has been a "difficult book both to read and to assess" since it was written in 1932. It needs to be judged by Lindsay's intention - to present a new religion or philosophy complete with a costly redemption "embracing and transcending all existing creeds, including Christianity." Elements reminiscent of Christianity include Ingrid as a Madonna figure and the idea of a chosen people . [MHM] 6491 Middleton, David. "'Men in Dark Times': Three New British Poets." SoR, 15 (Summer 1979), 585-604. In their poetry Clive Wilmer, Dick Davis, and Robert Wells address "the problem of religious experience with a serious but uncertain mind." Their poems reveal "the unmistakably modern sense of the forlorn and estrangement from God." How- ever, it is Davis in such poems as "The Virgin Mary" and "Jesus on the Water" who most explicitly states the religious quest in terms of Christianity. [MHM] 6492 Mihelich, Christine, I.H.M.

"Hymn to Priapus: Lawrence's Poetry of difference." Criticism, 22 (Summer 1980), pp. 214- 29. "Beginning with the basic rhetorical model of Swinburne's 'Hymn to Proserpine, ' which allows the poet to position him- self between half- tenable philosophies (the Christianity available is far less attractive than the Hellenism that is not), Lawrence emerges from the Victorian's situation of self-division with what he hopes will be a new poetics of living." [DWC] 6496 Neal, William Ray. "The Theology of Karl Barth as an Interpretative Key to the Fiction of John Updike." DAI, 38 (September 1977) , 1382A. This dissertation argues that, since Updike's novels lend themselves to interpretations according to Barthian theology and since the resulting in- terpretations agree with Updike's own statements about his works, critics who choose to comment on the thematic signif- icance of these works should keep their interpretations within the boundaries determined by Barth' s explication of the Christian message. 6497 Owen, Guy.

In A Clockwork Orange , the clash between the lawless hero and a society that hopes to control him "obscures another conflict which is nevertheless very important: the opposing views of libertarians and authoritarians on how best to provide social controls. The theme of libertarian-authoritarian opposition recurs throughout Burgess's novels, often as a conflict be- tween points of view Burgess has called Pelagian and Augus- tinián .

DAI , 37 (February 1977), 5147A-48A. This dissertation shows a deep and intimate kinship between D. H. Lawrence and Charles Williams in terms both of their re- spective doctrinal visions and their achievements in prose fiction. 6505 Schwartz, Marilyn Merritt. "From Beat to Beatific: Religious Ideas in the Writings of Kerouac, Ginsberg and Corso." DAI , 37 (March 1977), 5833A. A study of the development of these first beats - Kerouac, Ginsberg, and Corso - from a post-World War II anomie to a beatific con- sciousness essentially religious in character. Includes individual treatments of the writers' major works. 6506 Shelton, Frank W. "Harry Crews: Man's Search for Perfection." SLJ, 12, No. 2 (Spring 1980), 97-113. "His first novel, The Gospel Singer (1968), most explicitly deals with religion. ..." "Naked in the Garden Hills (1969), . . . treats religion in an almost allegorical way." "This Thing Don ' t Lead to Heaven (1970) effectively disposes of institutional religion as a subject for Crews." In other novels, "karate is an almost religious ritual" or God is found in cars. [GWVD] 6507 Stein, Paul S. "Ike McCaslin: Traumatized in a Haw- thornian Wilderness." SLJ, 12, No. 2 (Spring 1980), 65-82. In Faulkner's The Bear, "Ironic readings begin to see Ike as the source of his own failure: he has misinter- preted the singificance and meaning of his wilderness exper- ience, and is consequently rendered ineffectual by his mis- taken adherence to a vision of the wilderness as Garden of Eden, a sanctuary in which he can escape those guilts and moral responsibilities which await him in the tamed land." Ike's historiography "matches perfectly the Puritan view of history and the Puritan sense of identity." "Yet the snake serves ... as a reincarnation of Old Carothers ... by being addressed as Grandfather . . . but also by the Biblical tradition associating the snake in the garden with sexuality - as crime and with sexual shame. ..." especially "that of miscegenation and incest commited by his grandfather Carothers McCaslin." [GWVD] 6508 Telotte, J. P. "Charles Pierce to Walker Percy: From Semiotic to Narrative." SoQ, 18, No. 3 (1980), 65-79. "As a Catholic writer following in the tradition of Kierke- gaard and Gabriel Marcel, Percy believes that this alienation is partly the natural consequence of the primal Fall of Man, that universal estrangement from God and the meaning which He infused into the world." However, "a more recent phenomenon, a striking correlation between this gradual loss of meaning in our everyday communications and the increasingly alienated feeling of modern man" is also noted.

This dissertation examines Baldwin's fiction in light of his black Christian experience, which exemplifies and elucidates his rationale for moving towards a profound be- lief in a humanitarian agnosticism. His style, however, retains religious elements, and through these he argues for agnosticism as an intellectual counterpoise to the emotion- alism of the church. 6510 Towery, Allen Dan. "The Puritan Tradition in the Novels of Robert Herrick." DAI , 38 (September 1977), 1397A-98A. A study of how Herrick used Chicago as a symbol of urban America and then analyzed it in terms of his New England Puritan background. 6511 Wain, John. "C. S. Lewis." ASch, 50 (Winter 1980-81), 73-80. The author, once Lewis' student at Oxford, says Lewis was "all his life a dreamer." He opposed almost everything modern, was steeped in the classics, and inherited strongly forensic instincts from his lawyer father. He had "an overarching metaphysical religious belief." His teach- ing was "highly disputacious , " even Socratic. The article gives a vivid picture of his tutorial and lecturing style. [WSM] 6512 Walker, John. "The Aesthetic and Metaphysical Function of Liturgy in the Work of Eduardo Barrios." Mosaic, 12 (1979), 147-59. "For Barrios, the liturgy is a means of attempting to render artistically matters of the Heart (faith, sentiment, instinct) which are not only the stuff, but also the cause, of the metaphysical realities that beset his tor- mented characters in particular . . . and all men in general in their daily struggle with existence." 6513 Wood, Ralph C. "Walker Percy as Satirist: Christian and Humanist Still in Conflict." ChCent , 97 (November 19, 1980), 1122-1227. Percy's Christian humanism as expressed in his works reveals a conflict between a theology which begins with the human quest for the divine and "the exultant convic- tion that we long for the grace of God not because of our own capacity for it, but because we have already been found by it." Ethical humanism and scientific humanism are both sources of our spiritual malaise, the latter receiving the most pointed of Percy's satiric attacks in Love in the Ruins; this work is superior to Percy's last two books, Lancelot and The Second Coming , which, through an undeclared commitment to humanism, verge on the cynical and sentimental, respectively.

Defending religious fundamentalism, Ransom, in God Without Thunder: Unorthodox Defense of Orthodoxy (1930) , "argues for an inscrutable God, one that cannot be apprehended by the senses or comprehended by the reason."
