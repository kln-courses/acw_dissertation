<plain_text><page sequence="1">CHAUCER AND THE RHETORIC OF CONSOLATION I IN few an duties age such make as ours, us when feel more both ťgood inadequate taste* and than sincerity that of are offering undemonstrative, articulate few duties make us feel more inadequate than that of offering articulate consolation. On such occasions we may wish that we lived in a period when it was assumed that a man charged with such an office would repair to his library and select appropriate solada from the abundant literature concerned with the consolatio mortis , or choose suitable 'topics of consolation* from such a treatise as Seneca's De Remediis Fortuitorum or Petrarch's De Remediis Utriusque F ortunae } Yet, even in those more formal ages, the most sensitive authors of consolations were not unaware of the danger, inherent in the genre, of presumptuousness and officiousness. It may be for that reason that some of the most memorable essays in the genre are examples of self-consolation - or, at least, purport to be such. This is one of the strengths of The Consolation of Philosophy. One suspects that, if a professional counsellor had visited Boethius in internal exile at Pavia and administered to his misfortunes the arguments of the author's own Philosophia, the statesman and Christian within him would have listened respectfully, but the dialectician within him would have been tempted to yield to the propensity of the academic mind to 'switch into reverse', and would have promptly refuted these same arguments. Two centuries before Boethius was executed, Paulinus of Nola composed his Carmen xxxi, which has been described as 'the first Christian elegy'.2 In fact it offers consolation to the parents of the boy Celsus, who had died before his eighth birthday. The poem employs a number of the traditional solada to persuade the parents that their son's death was a positive advantage to him. What saves the consolation from officiousness is the fact that the poet is personally involved in the loss. For the death of this child reminds him of that of his own Celsus, who had lived for only eight days. The poem ends with a vision of the two boys joined in the procession of virgines who follow the Lamb. This poem has recently been compared to PearP which, as a self-consolation, also avoids presumptuousness and, though it employs several topics of the consolatio mortis genre, avoids becoming platitudinous - so imaginatively are the traditional solada integrated into the semi-dramatic context. In more recent times even writers of self-consolations have become suspicious of the traditional solada : One writes, that 'Other friends remain', That 'Loss is common to the race' - 38</page><page sequence="2">Consolation in Chaucer 39 And common is the commonplace, And vacant chaff well meant for grain. That loss is common would not make My own less bitter, rather more: Too common! Never morning wore To evening, but some heart did break.4 In rejecting the solarium that 4 Death is the common lot of Man' Tennyson may be thinking of the prince's reaction to his mother's glib use of it in Hamlet , I. ii. 72ff. It is not only here that Shakespeare's verse is able to capture and record even the merest overtones of insincerity. Consider, for example, Friar Lawrence's exhortation to the Capulets as they lament their daughter's death. This speech (Romeo and Juliet , IV. v. 65-83) employs several of the solada that were woven so subtly into the texture of Pearl. If we detect a note of special pleading in the argument (leading to the conclusion: 'Yet nature's tears are reason's merriment'), is it merely because we know that the speech is hypocritical - that, when the friar addresses these words to Juliet's parents, he knows that she is in fact alive? The element of special pleading becomes most patent when a condemned man is to be persuaded that his death is an advantage to him. Such is the speech of the Duke (disguised as a friar) to Claudio ( Measure for Measure , III. i. 5-41), an amalgam of commonplaces that even includes the emblem-book image of the ass bearing ingots (11. 25-8). The Duke, of course, has no intention of letting Claudio die. Chaucer anticipates Shakespeare in his sensitive awareness of the dangers and embarrassments inherent in proffered consolation. Since its purpose is to try to diminish another's grief, there is always a risk that it will merely belittle it. It may be for this reason that, with one exception, his most notable essays in the genre are indirect, oblique or ironical. The exception is the Tale of Melibee (which is largely a translation). I have elsewhere listed the solada employed in this tale, as well as those used in The Book of the Duchess and the Knight's Tale.5 Here I propose to venture beyond the mere listing of such 'topical' arguments in order to consider the variety of ways in which Chaucer exploits them and to show how an awareness of this can affect our interpretation of the works in which they occur. To the works already mentioned I shall add passages from Troilus and Criseyde , the Franklin's Tale and the Wife of Bath's Tale. II In spite of some local awkwardnesses and lapses of taste, The Book of the Duchess is a most sensitively and imaginatively conceived elegy. I have briefly argued elsewhere that its expression of sympathy for the bereaved John of Gaunt is enhanced precisely by its demonstration of the failure of attempted consolation.6 As this is not the usual view of the poem, I will develop it a little further here.</page><page sequence="3">40 Medium ¿Evum lii.i The very opening of the poem is disconsolate in its reference to the narrator's unspecified eight years' sorrow for which there is no possible remedy (35-40). 7 In order to beguile the sleeplessness induced by this grief, he one night reads the story (from Ovid's Metamorphoses) of 'Seys' and Alcyone. But Chaucer has ruthlessly excised the metamorphosis which, in the original, provides a whimsically consolatory conclusion, with the result that his ending is painfully abrupt. Seys's apparition informs his wife in a dream that he is dead, adding: 4 1 praye God youre sorwe lysse' (210). But - pace one distinguished critic8 - she is not consoled: With that hir eyen up she casteth And saw noght. "Alias!" quod she for sorwe, And deyede within the thridde mořwe. (212-14) It has often been observed that this story mirrors the situation later in the poem where, in a dream, the Black Knight tells of his lady's death. What has not been so often noticed is that the abrupt ending to the tale foreshadows, to some extent, the abrupt way in which the dream concludes without achieving consolation. The minds of several critics have been exercised by the problem of why the dreamer, throughout his dialogue with the bereaved knight, acts as if he were ignorant of the nature of the latter's loss, when he has in fact overheard the 'lay' (475-86) in which he explicitly laments his lady's death.9 The most probable immediate explanation is surely in terms of tact and honour. Since the knight has not voluntarily informed the dreamer of the facts, the latter considers it improper to presume upon what he has overheard - especially as the knight is his social superior. The dreamer's concern with the niceties of etiquette is evident from the account of his first exchange with the knight (514-38). His gentle catechism of the mourner is intended to encourage him to be explicit so that the would-be consoler may administer his principal remedy. But the bereaved husband is understandably evasive: when he speaks of his loss he veils it in an allegory about how Fortune has taken his 4 Fers' in a game of chess; when he mentions his lady explicitly and describes his wooing of her, he fails to declare what has become of her. The dreamer behaves like what Aristotle, referring to Socrates, called an eipcov - 'one who says less than he thinks'.10 He chooses to understand in a literal sense the knight's figurative utterances: 'ther is no man alyve her/ Wolde for a fers make this woo!' (740-1). No doubt Chaucer's inevitable ignorance is partly to blame for the fact that, when the dreamer cites the archetypal eipcov, he treats him merely as the auctour of a commonplace solarium: Remembre yow of Socrates, For he ne counted nat thre strees Of noght that Fortune koude doo! (717-19) Nevertheless, the comment (which makes Socrates sound like Górgias) is meant to be inept, coming as it does after the bereaved man has half-humorously answered his own complaint by admitting that he can hardly blame Fortune for the theft: had</page><page sequence="4">Consolation in Chaucer 41 he been in her place, he would have done the same (675ff.). He counters the dreamer's literal-mindedness with the words: 'Thou wost ful lytel what thou menest;/I have lost more than thow wenesť (743-4). The effect of the repetition of this couplet at 1137-8 and again at 1305-6 is similar to that of a refrain in a short poem. But it is also ironical. On the first two occasions the irony is at the knight's expense; for the dreamer in fact knows more than his interlocutor supposes. But, at its final occurrence, the irony is unexpectedly turned against the dreamer. The knight has been indulging in lengthy reminiscence of his former life with his lady. The dreamer evidently decides that now is the time to apply the ultimate consolation. But he must first compel his interlocutor to be explicit. So he asks, 'Where is she now?': "Now?" quod he, and stynte anoon. Therwith he wax as ded as stoon, And seyde, "Alias, that I was bore! That was the los that here-before I tolde the that I hadde lorn. Bethenke how I seyde here-beforn, 'Thow wost ful lytel what thow menest; I have lost more than thow wenesť - God wot, alias! ryght that was she!" "Alias, sir, how? what may that be?" "She ys ded!" "Nay!" "Yis, be my trouthe!" "Is that youre los? Be God, hyt ys routhe!" (1299-1310) When it comes to the point, the would-be consoler finds that all his comfortable words are spent; he can only stammer out his monosyllabic expression of pity. Although he has factual knowledge of the lady's death, and although he has suffered his own incurable sorrow, the two do not add up to an inward apprehension of the meaning of the knight's loss. The dreamer is still further distanced from the knight by the device with which Chaucer abruptly brings the dream to an end, so that dreamer and reader alike may escape from the intolerable atmosphere of sorrow; but the bereaved knight must remain there solitary and unconsoled. In this way the poem's elegiac and monumental purpose is fulfilled. The feeling of irreplaceable loss so imaginatively conveyed leaves a much greater sense of the dead Duchess's worth than does the overtly epideictic portrait of her that extends from line 817 to line 1033. Ill Several characteristics of the dreamer in The Book of the Duchess are inherited by Pandarus. His romanticized - and probably invented - description to Criseyde ( Troilus and Criseyde , II. 505-53) of how he first became aware of Troilus's love- longing bears an uncanny resemblance to the way in which the dreamer overhears</page><page sequence="5">42 Medium ^Evum lii.i the black knight's lament for his dead lady. When, after the Trojan 'parlement* has decreed the exchange of Criseyde for Antenor, Pandarus visits his stricken friend, he is at first 'So confus that he nyste what to seye' (IV. 356). He begins his consolation by drawing upon the stock-in-trade of the genre: Swich is this world! forthi I thus diffyne, Ne trust no wight to fynden in Fortune Ay propretee; hire yiftes ben comune. (IV. 390-3) In the two succeeding stanzas he ventures two more arguments. He first reminds him that 'thi desir al holly hastow had' (395); it is rather he, Pandarus, who has cause to weep since he has never received from his lady 'A frendly cheere, or lokyng of an eye* (398). His second solace is that 'This town is ful of ladys al aboute' (401) who are, in his opinion, twelve times fairer than Criseyde (cf. 'Other friends remain'). The outraged Troilus eventually refutes both arguments. He perceives that the second cannot logically be maintained by the faithful lover who urged the first (cf. IV. 484-90); and he observes (IV. 477-83) that the first argument flatly contradicts Pandarus's remark (of Boethian origin) at III. 1625-8: For of fortunes sharpe adversitee The worste kynde of infortune is this, A man to han ben in prosperitee, And it remembren, whan it passed is. He concludes with a general observation about the ineptitude of Pandarus's academic reasoning: 'O, where hastow ben hid so longe in muwe,/That kanst so wel and formaly arguwe?' (IV. 496-7). Pandarus is, of course, deliberately acting the part of an sipcov. As the narrator observes about his arguments, 'Thise wordes seyde he for the nones alle' (IV. 428) to prevent Troilus from acting desperately; in order to assuage his sorrow: 'He roughte nought what unthrift that he seyde* (IV. 431). He exploits the outrageous arguments in order to rouse Troilus from his sorrowful lethargy to a state of rational discourse so that his mind may be ready to respond to the proposals for practical action which Pandarus is about to make.11 After Criseyde's departure from Troy Pandarus continues to 'speak less than he thinks', no longer in order to manoeuvre T roilus into action, but to sustain him by a series of temporary expedients so that the prince may not do violence to himself. Throughout the slow-moving stanzas of their scenes together in Book V, Pandarus performs the most painful and prolonged consolatory role of any character in English fiction, only to be rewarded with his friend's recriminations (V. 1709-15) when Troilus has at last recognized 'That al is lost that he hath ben aboute' (V. 1645). The effect of this is to reduce Chaucer's most articulate character to silence (V. 1723-9), before he stammers out two stanzas of apology in which he declares that he hates his niece. But this only reveals that the distance between himself and his 'brother deer' (V. 1731) is even greater than that between the dreamer and the</page><page sequence="6">Consolation in Chaucer 43 mourner at the end of The Book of the Duchess. For Troilus, lost in his apostrophe of his faithless lady, had exclaimed: I ne kan nor may. For al this world, withinne myn herte fynde To unloven yow a quarter of a day! In corsed tyme I born was, weilaway, That yow, that doon me al this wo endure, Yet love I best of any creature! (V. 1696-1701) IV The question of whether Troilus ultimately receives adequate or appropriate consolation, when his soul ascends to the Ogdoad, is one that I do not intend to discuss here. One of the sources for this passage (V. 1807-27) is the account, in Book XI of Boccaccio's II Teseida , of the heavenward flight of Arcita's soul. In the Knight's Tale, however, Chaucer will not allow his Arcite such conventional, dogmatic, theological consolation and compensation for his loss of Emelye: declaring himself to be 'no divinistre', he refuses to speculate about the fate of the hero's soul (A 2809-1 5). The proffered consolation is made relative by being shifted from the narrator to characters within the fiction: Egeus (the only person who can console Theseus for Arcite's death) and, later, Theseus himself when he urges his half-sister to marry Palamon. As I have noted elsewhere, both speeches employ several of the traditional solada of the consolatio mortis genre.12 What is of interest for the present argument is the different ways in which father and son employ these 'topics'. 'Commonplaces' may either be taken at their face value, or they may be manipulated for the purposes of dialectic. Egeus employs them in the former manner; Theseus deploys them in the latter. Theseus, the humane and enlightened ruler, has endeavoured to settle the rivalry in love of the 'sworn brothers' by means of an orderly tournament, subsequently modified in such a way that no combatant shall be killed (A 2536-60). The accidental death of the victorious Arcite during his lap of honour - instigated by the sinister Saturn, whose ascendancy among the planetary and anthropomorphic 'gods' has been demonstrated in Part iii - untunes the Duke's notion of an even- tempered and orderly cosmic harmony. He can be consoled only by 'his olde fader Egeus' who knew 'this worldes transmutacioun/...Joye after wo, and wo after gladnesse' (A 2838-41). Egeus's arguments (A 2843-52) may strike us as platitudinous and his consolation as bleak. But that is what Chaucer intends. Like the old man in the Pardoner's T ale, he has seen all that this life can offer and has no longer any relish for it.13 He has acquired the unsophisticated wisdom of old age that is no longer embarrassed by the fact that the great truths are often the great platitudes: for him the simplicities of religion have replaced the ingenuities of philosophy.</page><page sequence="7">44 Medium ^vum lii.i The fact that Theseus begins his final speech (A 2987-3089) with the First Mover, whom he identifies with Jupiter (cf. A 3035-8), suggests that he has accommodated his father's religious view to his own metaphysic. But, as an active ruler of men, he cannot yet afford to clothe himself in his shroud and turn his back upon life. He employs his topics* to persuade men to act. He argues that stability exists only in the realm of eternity. In the contingent world everything goes by 'progressiouns' and 'successiouns' (A 3013-14): the cycle of birth, life and death continually revolves. The cycle has been (through prolonged mourning for Arci te) arrested for long enough at the moment of death. So he employs all his philosophy and eloquence to urge a renewal of life through the marriage of Palamon and Emelye. It is to this practical end that he employs the topics of the consolatio mortis between lines 3017 and 3066. There are two ways in which this speech may be misunderstood. In the first place, we might suppose that Chaucer intends it as a solution to metaphysical problems raised in the tale, especially as it is based to some extent upon Boethius. But it no more 'explains away* the 'tragedye' of Arcite's death than the mythological machinery of Part iii provides a teleological explanation of it. The speech stands in relation to the Knighťs Tale as Ulysses* speech on 'degree* does to Shakespeare's Troilus and Cressida (I. iii. 75-137). We should hesitate before regarding either as a statement of the poet's own philosophy of cosmic order; for each is spoken by a skilful politician to meet the exigencies of a particular situation. An effective monarch must act as if he believes the world to be governed by 'Jupiter the kyng', the symbol of Justice and Order. On the other hand, it would be a mistake to regard the speech cynically. It may seem unnatural that Theseus, instead of taking the young couple aside to suggest that the time was ripe for their espousal, should direct them towards marriage in a public assembly. In lines 2981-5 we watch him calculate, like an actor, how to make the maximum effect upon his audience. Moreover, in the preceding lines (A 2972-4) we have been told of his political reasons for wishing to arrange the marriage of Emelye to the surviving Theban knight. But there is no need to be cynical on this account. For any hereditary monarch the dynastic implications of marriage are paramount. At the close of this tale there is a felicitious confluence of dynastic considerations, the expected 'romantic* ending, and the fulfilment of Arci te 's dying wish - so providing a kind of resolution of the conflict between love and friendship. Nevertheless, it is a resolution rather than a solution: the final chord of a work that has looked tragedy in the face rather than the triumphant conclusion of a theorem that claims to have 'saved the appearances'.</page><page sequence="8">Consolation in Chaucer 45 V In Part i of the Knight's Tale both Arcite (A 1223-74) and Palamon (A 1281-3) complain about the cruelty, the injustice and the unreasonableness of the human lot. Their speeches are partly based on arguments employed by the character 'Boethius' in The Consolation of Philosophy - arguments that are later refuted by his consoling interlocutor, Philosophia. But in the Franklin's Tale there is one speech that stands outside the tradition of Boethian consolation and questions the very basis of its procedures. I mean the first of Dorigen's 'compleyntes' (F 865-93): the one inspired by her fear of the 'grisly feendly rokkes blake' into which all her volatile apprehensions about her absent husband's safety have been concentrated and solidified. She asks why 'swich a parfit wys God and a stable', who had 'a greet chiertee/Toward mankynde' when He created man in His own image, should allow the existence of such objects of mortal danger to him. And she adds: I woot wel clerkes wol seyn as hem leste, By argumentz, that al is for the beste, Though I ne kan the causes nat yknowe. (F 885-7) The 'clerkes' about whose 'argumentz' she is so sceptical are of course the eminently orthodox followers of Boethius who argue that man's view of the world is partial: if he could perceive God's total design, he would realize 'that al is for the beste'; regarded sub specie aeternitatis , the phenomena of this world will be recognized for the deceptive appearances that they are, and no longer be taken for ultimate reality. The context of this 'compleynt' is that of failed consolation. Although the tale is a romance that involves magic, Chaucer encourages us from an early stage to seek for psychological explanations for the actions of his characters.14 Observe, for example, the technical terms of mediaeval psychology in the following passage: For in this world, certein, ther no wight is That he ne dooth or seith somtyme amys. Ire, siknesse, or constellacioun , Wyn, wo, or chaungynge of complexioun Causeth fui ofte to doon amys or speken. (F 779-83 - my italics) It is, of course, 'wo' (grief) that ultimately drives Dorigen to 'amys ... speken' at F 989-98 when she makes 'in pley' (988) her offer to love Aurelius, if he will perform the (apparently impossible) task of removing all the rocks from the Breton coast. But its immediate effect is to induce in her a 'derke fantasye' (F 844). The primary contextual meaning oí fantasye must be 'obsession'; but it is worth remembering - for future reference - that it can also mean illusion'. In order to assuage her excessive grief, her friends (who are evidently familiar with the standard repertory of solada) 'prechen hire' (F 824), maintaining that 'causeless she sleeth hirself', and apply 'every confort possible in this cas'. Eventually her mind 'Receyved</page><page sequence="9">46 Medium ^vum lii.i hath. ../The emprentyng of hire consolacioun' (F 833-4) so that the worst of her 'rage* abates. But the seaside walks that they prescribe for her convalescence merely aggravate her fears when she sees the black rocks. Although she is emotionally overwrought, there is no occasion for us to feel patronizing or condescending towards her 'compleynt'.15 The question of how Chaucer's contemporaries would have judged the theological opinions of a character in a work of fiction set in pagan times is not quite as straightforward as some 'historical' critics would have us believe. Nevertheless, there is no harm in conceding that Dorigen's complaint would have been condemned, not only by 'Boece', but also by 'the hooly doctour Augustyn' as well as by Chaucer's near contemporary, 'Bishop Bradwardyn'.16 Bradwardine, for example, argued that nothing created is, by nature, bad: everything created, as coming from God, is good.17 When discussing the closely related question of how a perfect and omnipotent God can permit the existence of sin in His creatures, he follows 'the hooly doctour Augustyn', maintaining that the beauty of the universe is not to be considered in its individual parts, but that, as with a picture, our judgement must come from its overall aspect. It is interesting to find that Augustine (as quoted by Bradwardine) goes on to argue that: 'As the black in a picture is, in relation to the rest of it, a means of enhancing its beauty, so sin must be regarded as enhancing the good in the universe'.18 (It is, incidentally, the blackness of the rocks that makes them particularly abhorrent to Dorigen.) In the same context Bradwardine observes: '...in vocibus diuersis unam harmoniam perfecit'19 (cf. Pope, 'Essay on Man', I. 291: 'All Discord, Harmony, not understood'). But Bradwardine finds himself in serious logical difficulties in trying to maintain this position.20 Moreover, the 'Pelagiani moderni', against whose influential arguments he directed the De Causa Dei , would have appreciated Dorigen's predicament sympathetically. These unnamed opponents almost certainly included Bradwardine's compatriots and near contemporaries, the 'Nominalists', William of Occam and Robert Holcot. Occamists - according to the traditional interpretation of their position21 - denied that it was possible to demonstrate rationally the truths of 'natural religion' and maintained that one could not prove the existence of God by means of the traditional 'argument from design'; nor could one make any rational demonstration of His attributes. But Occam and Holcot were both friars and professedly devout Christians. They regarded belief in God as a matter of faith that existed altogether outside the sphere of logical demonstration. This position is not unlike Dorigen's. Having declared her dissatisfaction with 'clerkes' who maintain 'By argumentz, that al is for the beste', she makes an act of pure faith: But thilke God that made wynd to blowe As kepe my lord! this my conclusion. To clerkes lete I al disputison... (F 888-90) It is only then, as an afterthought, that she utters the extravagant, but very human,</page><page sequence="10">Consolation in Chaucer 47 It is only then, as an afterthought, that she utters the extravagant, but very human, wish that all the rocks 'Were sonken into helle for his sake'. Her friends divert her inland to the garden where she meets Aurelius. But the black rocks have not sunk into hell: they have merely sunk into her 'subconscious', from which they arise (an upsurge of her 'derke fantasye') to cause her irrationally to make her offer to Aurelius - another afterthought. It is now possible to appreciate the irony in the developing situation. When Dorigen very reasonably rejects the traditional consolation of 'clerkes' concerning the ultimate illusoriness of (unpleasant) worldly phenomena, she is still suffering from a 'fantasye' (obsession, misconception, illusion) which later causes her to offer to love Aurelius, if he can make 'the coost so clene/Of rokkes that ther nys no stoon ysene ' (F 995-6). The desperate young squire seizes upon these words and (unknown to her) causes a 'clerke' (very different from those envisaged by Dorigen!) to juggle with appearance and reality so that, for a week or two, 'It semed that alle the rokkes were aweye' (F 1296). So she is caught in a 'trappe' (F 1341) constructed out of her own words. The remainder of the tale purports to show that this 'trappe' is itself illusory, and does not justify the self-slaughter to which she is pointed, in her second 'compleynť (F 1355ff.), by the auctoures whose exempla she has evidently searched in vain for consolation. Fortunately, she ignores their unanimous advice and declares her perplexity to her husband. VI In the Franklin's Tale magic places the heroine in a 'trappe'; in the Wife of Bath's Tale magic releases the 'hero' from a hideous matrimonial penitentiary. Before the old, poor and low-born hag transforms herself into a young, beautiful and faithful wife she harangues, from the far corner of the bed, her reluctant young husband on the attractions of old age, poverty and 'lak of gentillesse' (in the sense of 'high birth') (D 1106-1218). Her role is similar to that of the disguised Duke in his counselling of Claudio: she must persuade her husband that what he regards as worse than death is a positive advantage to him. It is surprising that so many commentators have taken this speech in solemn earnest. Perhaps they are daunted by the fact that the hag's argument about the nature of true gentillesse (D 1 109ff.) occurs elsewhere in serious and very respectable contexts: in Chaucer's Ballade on the subject; Dante's Convivio and De Monarchia; The Consolation of Philosophy itself.22 It is therefore worth recalling what one of the earliest commentators on the passage has to say. In The Preface to the Fables , Dryden observes of the hag's performance: 'She takes her topiques from the Benefits of Poverty, the Advantages of old Age and Ugliness, the Vanity of Youth, and the silly Pride of Ancestry and Titles without inherent Virtue'. It is true that Dryden seems to take the discussion in earnest; but it is interesting that he</page><page sequence="11">48 Medium ¿Evum lii.i designates her arguments as 'topiques'. For, as already noted, once an argument is identified as supplying a 'topic', the possibility arises that its enunciator may not necessarily believe in it himself: he may be employing it as a generally accepted premiss from which he can construct an enthymeme - which may well prove to be a 'sophism'.23 Surely it is likely that, in this most teasing of Chaucer's tales (after the Nun's Priest's Tale), the 'topiques' are deployed 'in game'. One of the few critics to regard the passage as playful has observed very pertinently: 'It is surely obvious that the first two ... objections - that she is ugly and old - are the more serious, yet it is the third and least important (though not unimportant) objection [i.e. that she lacks gentle birth] which the hag enlarges on somewhat illogically for over one hundred lines'.24 Analysed technically, this is a comic development of the ancient procedure in forensic rhetoric whereby an advocate would employ amplificatici in order to give prominence to evidence that enhanced his case and abbreviatio to gloss over that which told against it. The hag 'amplifies' enormously her reply to the least damaging of the knight's objections in order to dwarf the more pertinent ones concerning her 'filthe' and 'elde'. At the same time, there is a characteristically Chaucerian joke about the limitations of human reason. The hag is sweet reasonableness itself in the one situation where all argument is patently irrelevant. What is more, her prolix 'moral' discourse cheerfully concludes with the non sequitur : 'But natheless, sin I knowe youre délit, /I shal fulfille youre worldly appétit' (D 1217-18). The volte face is worthy of Chauntecleer.25 The function of the discourse cannot be fully appreciated unless it is viewed in a wider context. In the first part of the tale the knight is manoeuvred into marrying the hag, who has saved his life. The Wife of Bath evidently considers this a more appropriate punishment than death for the rape he has committed - especially as he is a 'lusty bacheler' (D 883). But it is not enough for him to be legally compelled to marry her. He must voluntarily concede maistrie to his wife; and for this voluntary act he will be rewarded with perpetual bliss. It is essential for his happiness that, when the hag offers her husband the choice at D 1219-27, he shall leave it to her, recognizing that in her will is his peace. She works for this result by psychological attrition and verbal bombardment so that he is rendered mentally 'punch-drunk' by the end of her relentlessly protracted diatribe on the advantages of his having married someone of low birth. The tone of his reply (D 1228-35), in which he leaves the choice to her, shows him to be indeed utterly wearied, brow- beaten, and rendered incapable of making any decision. What Chaucer makes game of in this episode is not so much the particular set of 'topiques' cited by the hag as the general tradition of 'remedies against Fortune'. Petrarch had duly rehearsed these particular 'topiques' in the second Book of his De Remediis Utriusque F ortunae' and it is interesting to observe that, when (after 1400) an English translator freely adapted a fragment of that immense 'libellus', the sequence of Dialogues he chose to render was precisely that which included: 'De Deformitate Corporis' ('Of vnsemeli schap'), 'De Originis Obscuritate' ('Of Pore</page><page sequence="12">Consolation in Chaucer 49 Birķe'), 'De Paupertate' ('Of Pouerte,).26 Chaucer converts to solas the basic doctrine of this consolatory tradition which purports to show that (unpleasant) earthly phenomena are other than what they appear to be to our limited human understanding. If the Tale were a moral allegory, the knight would no doubt have embraced the hag in the spirit in which St Francis of Assisi embraced the Lady Poverty:27 he would have discovered within her a spiritual and ethical beauty invisible to the outward eye. But the tale causes things to be 'other than what they appear to be' in a sense that would have horrified Boethius, Petrarch, the saints and the theologians. When the hag transforms herself magically into a being that will gratify l'homme moyen sensuel , she virtually stands all the consolatory topics on their heads. This inversion is the Comic Muse's version of the commonplace that underlies so much of the consolatory tradition: 'ï&gt;is world fareļ) as a Fantasye'28 and it therefore seems peculiarly fitting to the tale's narrator, whose 'entente is nat but for to pleye* (D 192).

Härtel, Corpus scriptorum ecclesiasticorum Latinorum, 30 (Vienna, 1894), pp. 307-29. 3 Cf. V. E. Watts {'Pearl as a consolatio' MAL, XXXII (1963), 34-6), who, however, does not notice the poet's personal involvement; I. Bishop, Pearl in its Setting (Oxford, 1968), pp. 16-17, 18, 20. 4 In Memoriamovi. 1-8. 5 Pearl in its Setting, , 21-3. On the Knight's Tale, see also J. E. Cross's article on 'The genre of The Wanderer y Neophilologus , XLV (1961), 63-75, esp. p. 69. 6 Pearl in its Setting , pp. 23-4. See notes to these pages for other critics' interpretations of the poem. All references to Chaucer are to The Works of Geoffrey Chaucer , ed. by F. N. Robinson, 2nd edn (Boston, 1957). 7 Like most commentators on the passage, I assume that this grief was probably due to unrequited love. 8 W. Clemen, Chaucer's Early Poetry , trans, by C. A. M. Sym (London, 1963), p. 31 ff.; but see last paragraph of p. 35. 9 The most ingenious and attractive of these explanations is that by J. Lawlor, 'The pattern of consolation in The Book of the Duchess' Speculum , XXXI (1956), 626-48. But it involves an unnecessarily elaborate hypothesis; and so I reject it - on the principle of Occam's razor - in favour of a simpler explanation that seems to me to fit the evidence of the text equally well. 10 Nicomachean Ethics , IV, vii. The word has been given currency as a term of literary criticism by Northrop Frye, Anatomy of Criticism (Princeton, 1957), pp. 40, 172-5. On p. 227 he applies the term to the narrator of Gen. Prol. to CT. See also J. A. Burrow ( Ricardian Poetry (London, 1971), p. 39), who applies the term to the narrator in Chaucer's dream-poems. 11 For a more detailed discussion of this episode, see I. Bishop, Chaucer's 'Troilus and Criseyde ': a Critical Study (Bristol: University of Bristol, 1981), pp. 76-8. [Reviewed in this issue, pp. 135-7 - Eds.ļ 12 Pearl in its Setting , pp. 21-2. 13 Cf. I. Bishop, 'The narrative art of The Pardoner's Tale' M/E, XXXVI (1967), 15-24 (esp. p. 15). 14 For a discussion of the differences between mediaeval and modern theories of 'psychology', and of their relevance to the behaviour of Chaucer's characters, see Gerald Morgan (ed.), Geoffrey Chaucer:</page><page sequence="13">50 Medium ¿Evum lii.i The Franklin's Tale , The London Medieval and Renaissance Series (London, 1980) (esp. pp. 1-4, 9-10, 16-25).

G. Leff, Bradwardine and í/v /V/¿gwws (Cambridge, 1957), pp. 54-5. For a different account of Bradwardine's theology, see H. A. Oberman, Archbishop Thomas Bradwardine: a Fourteenth Century Augustinián (Utrecht, 1957). 18 De Causa Dei Contra Pelagium , ed. by Lord Henry Savile (London, 1618), p. 296. Cf. Leff, p. 60. 19 De Causa Dei , p. 295. 20 As demonstrated by Leff, p. 57ff. 21 Some recent commentators, however, have questioned the view that Nominalist philosophy is sceptical and its theology fideistic. See the discussion of Holcot by H. A. Oberman, The Harvest of Medieval Theology: Gabriel Biel and Late Medieval Nominalism (Cambridge, Mass., 1963), pp. 242-48. 22 III, pr. vi. 23 I use the term 'enthymeme', not in the current sense of a syllogism with one term unexpressed, but in the ancient usage where it is the rhetorician's counterpart to the dialectician's syllogism. Whereas a syllogism is concerned to demonstrate the truth from self-evident premises, an enthymeme is concerned to persuade by employing generally accepted 'topics' as its premises. 24 Tony Slade, 'Irony in the Wife of Bath's Tale', MLR , LXIV (1969), 241-7 (esp. p. 245). 2S Cf.
