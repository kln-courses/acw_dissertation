<plain_text><page sequence="1">CESAR AUGUSTO SALGADO Hybridity in New World Baroque Theory This article surveys a genealogy of 20th-century writings on the cultural study of baroque art, literature, and architecture produced in Latin America during the colonial period. It explores the role that theorizing the hybrid plays in works by "neobaroque" authors like Jose Lezama Lima, Alejo Carpentier, and Severo Sarduy and how they define in their works a "New World baroque" aesthetic that is distinct from European sources. The article focuses on Lezama Lima's influential contribution to the debate. America, continent of symbiosis, of mutations, of vibrations, of mestizajes, has been baroque from the start. ... And why is Latin America the promised land of the baroque? Because all symbiosis, all mestizaje, gives rise to baroqueness. [Carpentier 1987:110, 112] WHAT ROLE DOES THEORIZING THE HYBRID PLAY in the critique and redefinition of the Eurocentric concept of the baroque that Latin American authors have conducted throughout this century? The term baroque was first used to designate a stylistic period of extravagant artificiality and ornamentation in post-Renaissance European art and literature and to characterize the doctrinal and iconographic strategies of the Counter- Reformation.' More recently, it has come to describe particular instances of Latin American cultural alterity in the discourse of what I will call here New World (or, for short, neo-) baroque theory. Within this discourse, the baroque functions as a trope or adjective for the region's complex ethnic and artistic mestizaje ("racial mixture") rather than as a reference to exclusively Western cultural forms. To cross from the European baroque into the Latin American neobaroque is to move from a hegemonic, diffusion- ist, and acculturating conception of the term to an emancipating, autochthonous, and transculturating one. I argue here that New World baroque theorists achieved this redefinition by focusing on the hybrid refigurations that European baroque paradigms have undergone when transplanted into the colonial arena. Neobaroque writer-theorists such as the Cuban scholars Jos&amp; Lezama Lima (1910-76), Alejo Carpentier (1904-80), and Severo Sarduy (1936-93) studied how "New World baroque" cultural artifacts of the colonial period could be read as instances of discontinuity rather than as applications of European aesthetic norms despite their visible allegiance to a metropolitan school or style. The neobaroque theorists' emphasis on such discontinuities recalls Homi K.

In other words, these theorists believe that studying the emergence of an idiosyncratic "New World baroque" would point to an ironic reversal of the Spanish imperial project, one in which, through hybridizing strategies, the colonial subject took advantage of baroque elements in the dominant discourse to create sites and terms for cultural resistance and survival. What Bhabha calls "the hybrid reduction of the colonial symbol to sign" (1994:113) describes the transformation that baroque emblems and motifs underwent when criollo (American-bom white or "mainly white" Spanish descendants), mestizo, and native artists recontextualized them into subaltern systems of meaning that "estranged" fixed hegemonic significations. Thus, the "New World baroque" is interpreted as a locus of latent alterities because here the transplanted model became mutated through the surreptitious insertion or grafting of the "denied" cultural elements the model was supposed to displace or suppress. Although the expression "New World baroque" or barroco americano may communicate a grandiose and unproblematic vision of mestizaje (as per the quote by Carpentier at the beginning of this article) and often stands as a formula for a utopian ethnic integration, the neobaroque theorist also reminds us that this "positive" mongrelization of European high styles resulted from the painful and incongruous overlapping of foreign and native morphologies in conflict. The profound concern for the baroque in Latin American cultural theory may have no equivalent in current postcolonial thinking; the colonial projects deconstructed by Edward Said, Gayatry Spivak, and Homi Bhabha tend to be seen as illustrations of what Max Horkheimer and Theodore Adorno called the dialectic of the Enlighten- ment (1994).2 These postcolonial critics study the contradictions of European liberal universalism as it undertook the hierarchical control, domestication, and classification of cultural "others" during the Western imperialist expansion into Africa, the Middle East, and Asia across the 18th, 19th, and 20th centuries.3 The Spanish colonial experi- ment in Latin America predated post-Enlightenment imperialism; it both accomplished its geopolitical and military apogee and fell into financial ruin during the baroque age. The neobaroque writers scoured the postconquest colonial period in Spanish America for baroque texts, images, figures, and artifacts that could help illuminate contemporary issues of culture and hybridity because, as Roberto Gonzilez-Echevarria has argued, they considered the baroque the originary moment of Latin American sensibility.4 Their emphasis on the baroque period contradicted the master narrative prevailing in much of Latin American historiography which regards the emergence of anti-Spanish resentment, nationalism, and the independence struggle as a consequence of the region's exposure to 18th-century enlightened doctrines. Neobaroque theory sought instead to find hybrid dissent at the time of greatest colonial conformity and quies- cence, during the so-called long siesta of the 17th century, when the systematic elimination of the external signs of native cultures was accomplished and racial misce- genation was anathematized by forced classification and disciplination in a societal caste system. New World baroque writers thus theorized the hybrid as a hidden inscription</page><page sequence="3">318 Journal of American Folklore 112 (1999) of difference within the fictional sameness of official culture, as rebellious graffiti camouflaged in the forest of baroque symbols. Precursors of New World Baroque Theory Although formulated between the 1950s and the 1980s in essays related to the humanities and the arts in Latin America and the Caribbean, neobaroque theory had important precursors in the field of Hispanic literary history. None of these precursors visualized the role played by hybridity in the colonial baroque in any analogous fashion. The study of colonial Spanish American baroque poetry as a subcategory of Hispanic peninsular literature was initiated in the late 19th century by the Spanish philologist Marcelino Menindez y Pelayo in his monumental Historia de la poesia hispano-americana ("History of Spanish American Poetry") (1911). Having started his research in 1892 during the celebration of the fourth centennial of Columbus's "discovery," Men6ndez y Pelayo intended to demonstrate how comparable the cul- tural benefits brought by peninsular civilization into the New World were to those the Greeks and Romans brought into the Old World. Menendez y Pelayo read the criollo poets of the colonial period as consonant, "pure" examples of Hispanic character and psychology, who developed an American accent by describing the exuberant New World landscape rather than from any hybrid incorporation of artistic expressions from the "barbarous" indigenous cultures.5 He judged most of the literary production of the 17th century in the Americas to be affected imitations of the florid and, according to Men6ndez y Pelayo, decadent aesthetic of the Seville baroque poet Luis de G6ngora (1561-1627). Menendez y Pelayo's position was challenged in the 1940s by Mexican critic Alfonso Reyes (1889-1959), Dominican scholar Pedro Henriquez Urefia (1889-1946), and Venezuelan essayist Mariano Pic6n Salas (1901-65), who put together exhaustive catalogues of colonial literary works and wrote encompassing essays on Latin American cultural history that highlighted what they called the Barroco de Indias ("Baroque of the Indies") period. Focusing more often on contrast than continuity with European models, they sought to extricate an early criollo idiosyncrasy from the peninsular matrix, arguing that a sense of extraieza ("alienation") and resentments accrued from having inferior political privileges vis-a-vis Spanish-born officials translated into a distinct criollo identity, not just an "accent," by the 1600s. However, although in their work Reyes, Henriquez Urefia, and Pic6n Salas avidly celebrated the mestizo contri- bution of non-European artisans in architecture, the plastic arts, and folk expression from the 16th century on, they did not acknowledge a significant hybrid content in the works of high criollo literature of the 17th century. In contrast to the dynamic Spanish-indigenous cultural and ethnic intermixing of the early decades of Spanish American colonization, they regarded the baroque colonial period as an epoch of reinforced social schisms that permitted less caste-to-caste influence within the narrow, lettered elite and of a "langour" and effeminacy that stood in stark contrast to the enterprising "virility" and inclusive creativity of the immediate postconquest period. Often their Barroco de Indias appears as an age of lavish criollo expenditure and</page><page sequence="4">Salgado, New World Baroque Theory 319 pretense that reflected-through the magnifying lens of colonial opulence--the deca- dence of a declining empire.6 Hybridity plays a very small role in the discussion of the colonial baroque in Pic6n Salas's classic 1944 study De la Conquista a la Independencia (translated in 1962 with "From Conquest to Independence" as subtitle; see 1971). After drawing in his first chapters a favorable picture of the 16th century in Latin America as a time of effervescent cultural mestizaje energized by the open-minded curiosity that missionar- ies like Motolinia and Bernardino de Sahagfin had toward indigenous traditions, Pic6n Salas represents the baroque century as a repressive and repressed aristocratic era. Neoscholasticism, the Inquisition, and a growing economic and social separation between the white urban criollos and the mestizo, Indian, and Black working masses led to cultural stagnation and superfluousness. He writes, "The free spirit and the adventurous, creative zeal to invent new ways to understand the aboriginal way of life characteristic of the sixteenth century had withered away by the seventeenth century: a static, indolent period followed a dynamic one" (1971:69). Thus, rather than regard the creative writers of the Baroque age as hybrid originals, Pic6n Salas tends to discuss outstanding white criollo poets, such as Mexicans Bernardo de Balbuena and SorJuana Ines de la Cruz and Peruvian Juan de Caviedes, as weaker American personifications of the metaphysical and worldly themes, elliptical style, and tortured psychology that characterized "Golden Age" Spanish baroque writers like G6ngora, Francisco de Quevedo, and Pedro Calder6n de la Barca (1971:85-105). Pic6n Salas thus labeled the uniquely bitter Caviedes as "a minor Quevedo" (1971:101) and avoided commenting in depth on cases of translinguistic writing such as the Nahuatl villancicos ("Christmas carols") by Sor Juana and the Quechua plays by Peruvian mestizo and G6ngora apologist Juan Espinoza y Medrano. Pic6n Salas considered the 16th century to be the truer period of mestizo writing; he argued that during the colonial baroque there were no outstanding mestizo intellectual figures as there had been previously (such as Garcilaso de la Vega el Inca and Fernando de Alva Ixtlix6chitl) because a new, more rigidly enforced racial segregation prevented their appearance (1971:75-76). For Pic6n Salas, the "mestizo conciliation" encouraged by the missionaries continued only in architecture, given that the reliance on the native masses for labor allowed indigenous artists to leave "the mark of their artistic will on the Spanish Catholic baroque" buildings (1971:94). Meanwhile, criollo literature became "esoteric" (1971:95) and disengaged from indigenous input. The following description of the baroque years summarizes Pic6n Salas's position: "The Indians had lost their history, as yet the mixed elements had made none, and the little of historical significance that happened was limited to a tiny circle of half-alien whites in whom a national consciousness had not yet dawned" (1971:94). It was in the late 1950s, 1960s, and 1970s that a concept of New World baroque culture as differential and hybrid took hold in the writings of Lezama Lima, Carpentier, and Sarduy.7 It is here that we have an affirmative description of New World baroque literature, not exclusively as a manifestation of white criollo discontent and estranged identity but as a mestizo expression only partially dependent on the European matrix. The neobaroque theorists accomplished this reversal by foregrounding less the sphere of criollo writing while articulating a more inclusive, ethnically and socially mixed</page><page sequence="5">320 journal of American Folklore 112 (1999) scenario of cultural production and giving an equivalent importance in their analyses to the pictorial and architectural arts. As a result, the Indian, Black, or mestizo artisan's presence was unarguably felt. Indeed, the former generation of Barroco de Indias cultural critics-Reyes, Henriquez Urefia, Pic6n Salas-were hommes des lettres, bibli- ographers first trained in philology. Rather than literary historians, Lezama Lima, Carpentier, and Sarduy were poets-novelists-essayists of eclectic education and back- ground.8 They thus deployed in their thinking a more interdisciplinary and fluid notion of culture and make more frequent references in their essays and novels to ethnology, archaeology, cosmology, architecture, musicology, linguistics, and, in the case of Sarduy, semiotics and poststructuralist theory. What I would like to emphasize here is how their vision of New World baroque culture, although inspired by litera- ture-focused Barroco de Indias studies such as Pic6n Salas's, was just as influenced by innovative interpretations from new historical works on Latin American colonial architecture and pictorial arts published in the late 1940s and early 1950s. I believe Lezama Lima, Carpentier, and Sarduy were especially receptive to the conflation of European art history principles with New World archaeology and ethnography which distinguished postwar works on colonial art and architecture by Manuel Toussaint, George Kubler, and Pil Kelemen. In these works a similar debate about an autochthonous and hybrid "Latin American baroque" was made in regard to the plastic arts.9 In their speculations about the aesthetics of New World baroque ornamentation in religious structures, the art historians deemphasized criollo exclusiv- ism and favored transversal research of cross-ethnic and multiclass economic and social negotiations in the arts. In contrast to the literary historians, the art historians rarely spoke about the elitism, degeneracy, resentment, or stagnation of the baroque colonial period but, rather, considered it as a moment of invigoration that managed often to improve aesthetically on the European paradigm. The proposals Lezama Lima, Car- pentier, and Sarduy make extrapolate from such positive appraisals of the plastic arts in the New World; among written works, they chose to discuss those that best incorpo- rated visual artifacts, icons, emblems, and rituals. Both Lezama Lima and Carpentier often address how the urban space of the colonial period became a contact zone in which European architecture, criollo circumstantial literature, and mestizo craftsman- ship mixed to create multicoded forms of convivial public performance-bilingual religious plays, triumphal arches decorated with Nahuatlan motifs, and processions and masques incorporating indigenous or African musical instruments and dances-in the highly ceremonious viceregal society.10 It was Kelemen's 1951 work Baroque and Rococo in Latin America that probably most influenced the neobaroque theorists while leaving, in the process, traces of its meth- odological and conceptual contradictions. Kelemen's evaluation of the American trans- formation of the European baroque was both unusual and attractive because it was made from the perspective of an Old World art scholar turned New World ethnogra- pher. In Kelemen's book we have instances of what James Clifford has called "ethno- graphic self-fashioning" (1988:92-113)." The author organized his catalogue of Latin American cathedrals, temples, religious sculptures, and paintings following the format of the "grand tour" of monuments that typifies European art history, yet his aesthetic observations and travel anecdotes are deftly intertwined to recall the narrative and</page><page sequence="6">Salgado, New World Baroque Theory 321 methods of anthropological fieldwork. Kelemen relates details of his journeys to remote villages in the Mexican Sierra or the Andes Altiplano in search for artworks and annotates his observations about the syncretic ceremonies held by the mestizo and Indian communities in the baroque chapels his team photographed. Although Kele- men's admiration for the vitalilty and boldness of the "baroque folk art" featured in those churches might often alternate with patronizing remarks about the lack of care for these "treasures," his overall commentary is always jarringly relativistic.'2 Kelemen might easily invoke the theories of his teacher Heinrich W6lfflin while describing his stay in a "Maya hut in Yucatan or travel by muleback in the High Andes" in his introduction (1951:vii, xii), allude to principles of avant-garde expressionism while discussing the fetish Aztec carvings on the missionary atrium crucifixes (1951:53-56), or refer to Bernini's baldachin in St. Peter's basilica to discuss "the folkloric interpreta- tion of European models" in the spiral columns of the remote San Pedro Mirtir Church in Juli, Peru (1951:269-270). What authorizes Kelemen to make these leveling comparisons between Old World and New World baroque art without subordinating the latter to the former is the Spenglerian depreciation of "decadent," late European splendor in favor of the merits of the more "robust" American constructions, even when these belong to the "primi- tive" category of anonymous folk art. This calculated disparagement of the metropoli- tan paradigm follows from a crisis of spiritual confidence provoked in Kelemen by the destruction caused by World War II, a disillusionment strongly stated in Kelemen's dedication of the book.13 Kelemen's European art expert turned traveling ethnogra- pher recalls the cultured protagonist of Alejo Carpentier's novel The Lost Steps (1956b) [Los pasos perdidos, originally published in 1953], who, disturbed by his visions of concentration camps as a soldier in World War II and disillusioned with the soulless mechanization of the postwar metropolis, journeys to villages in the primal Amazon jungle or the Andes sierra in search of anthropological objects that can reflect the vitality of an innocent, prelapsarian New World.14 For Kelemen, the New World is the site where the moribund European model will be preserved and transformed as it is "infused with a new blood" (1951:22). Biological metaphors are key tropes in Kelemen's examinations, and they take forms other than multicultural blood transfusions. The American baroque for Kelemen is also an intra- European hybrid, for the apparently absurd, naive overlayering of Western styles in one New World building (with Herrerian towers, Churrigueresque faCades, Gothic ceilings) can nevertheless achieve an organic, vernacular coherence that would have been impossible to accomplish in Europe, as if only on New World ground could such bold graftings be sustained.15 In "The City of Columns" and other essays, Carpentier appropriated Kelemen's idea of the New World baroque as an organic patchwork of anachronistic European forms when analyzing the peculiar aesthetic "stylelessness" that the hybrid juxtaposition of disparate architectural modes produces in Havana and other Latin American cityscapes (1987:42-43).'6 Kelemen also employs botanical notions of hybridity, speaking about the influence of the exuberant New World vegetation on European ornamental motifs and religious symbols, as if the "seed" of the baroque would, by virtue of cross-pollination and the fecundity of the American soil, produced a new species of art.17 The ascription of a baroque differential character to the New</page><page sequence="7">322 Journal of American Folklore 112 (1999) World landscape and soil is another Kelemen trope that Carpentier and Lezama Lima incorporated in their essays.18 Hybridity in Lezama Lima's New World Baroque Among the writings of the neobaroque theorists, the most influential may be the essay "La curiosidad barroca" ("The Curiosity of the Baroque"), the second of five lectures Jos' Lezama Lima gave at the National Institute at Havana in January 1957 and published as a book under the title La expresi6n americana ("The American Expression") later that year (see 1993). All other discussions of New World baroque aesthetics by Carpentier, Sarduy, and Lezama Lima himself take off from this essay. In the remainder of this article I will gloss "The Curiosity of the Baroque" in order to ascertain how Lezama Lima theorized hybridity in his vision of a counterhegemonic American baroque. Then I conclude by commenting briefly on the relevance Lezama Lima's neobaroque ideas have in the contemporary cultural discourse of post-1989 revolu- tionary Cuba. That Lezama Lima acknowledges the "reversal" of the colonialist paradigm Bhabha observes in hybrid colonial representations is evident in how he starts his essay with trenchant definitions of European and New World baroque, which are diametrically opposed. Playing on Wilhelm Worringer's, Heinrich Wolfflin's, and Oswald Spengler's characterizations of the baroque in Europe, Lezama Lima describes the proliferation of ornaments in Western baroque art as operating from passive, mechanical accumulation (acumulacidn sin tensidn) and sedate asymmetry (asimetria sin plutonismo).19 The New World baroque, on the other hand, inscribes a dynamic "tension" within its prolifera- tion, while its asymmetry is the result of "plutonism," a term Lezama Lima never defines explicitly which could be described as a destructive cosmogonical or telluric form of energy that emanates from some primal and volcanic "big bang" explosion of violence (1993:80). Like Worringer and Pic6n Salas, Lezama Lima regards the Euro- pean baroque as a "derivative style" of increasing degeneration. Contradicting Pic6n Salas while siding with Kelemen, he sees the American baroque as a vigorous, "ple- nary" style that is in no way a decadent or depleted reformulation of classical, Renais- sance, or gothic motifs. To Lezama Lima, the American baroque is not a mannerist mimicry of the European but, rather, a creative mode in which Old World styles are acrecentados-cultivated, mutated, grown, coaxed-into New World forms of expres- sion. To illustrate his points, Lezama Lima relies equally on examples from white criollo literary, scientific, and historical writings (by Sor Juana, Mexican savant Carlos de Sigiienza y G6ngora, and Colombian poet-priest Hemando Dominguez Camargo) and from mestizo religious architecture and sculpture (like the intricate stonework in temples of the Titicaca region by Indian craftsman Jos&amp; Kondori and the statues and relief~ in Minas Gerais churches sculpted by the mulatto artisan known as El Aleijadihno). Lezama Lima extols the "occult, hieratical synthesis of the Spanish and the Indian" (1993:105) achieved in the work of Kondori and the "grandiose union of the Hispanic and the African cultures" (1993:105-106) in Aleijadihno's sculpture. He also considers Sor Juana's use of the Huitzilipoztli Aztec fertility rite to dramatize the</page><page sequence="8">Salgado, New World Baroque Theory 323 mystery of the Eucharist in the loa ("prelude") to her religious play El Divino Narciso ("Divine Narcissus") as an equivalent case of hybrid fusion in white criollo writing (1993:98-99). Lezama Lima believes the combination of Western and non-Western religious icons in New World baroque art is an uneasy, anxious synthesis bearing traces of pugnacity--of "tension"-because it is always the consequence of a temeridad ("temerity"), that is, of the brass assertion on the part of both the criollo writers and the mestizo artisans of their right to "insert alien symbols" (1993:103) into the cosmologi- cal construct of the Spanish baroque. Lezama Lima regards SorJuana's, Kondori's, and Aleijadihno's brash insertions as "heresies" or "rebellions" that assault and dismem- ber-"as in an execution" [como contra un pared6n] (1993:86)-the Western stand- ards in order to reconfigure the disjointed pieces into a new, hybrid compound. Thus, the "tension" in New World baroque art Lezama Lima speaks of rises from the many social, ethnic, cross-cultural, and cosmogonical confrontations and resent- ments of the colonial experience; its "plutonism" is a way of reenacting, channeling, sublimating, and, in the end, expiating the destructive violence of the conquest, the encomienda (colonial form of labor tribute and distribution), the slave trade, and other modes of Western exploitation. Nevertheless, Lezama Lima confers a conciliatory capacity to this bold hybridity. In spite of its "tension" and its camouflaged memorial- izing of violence, he insists that the New World baroque is an "art of the Counter- Conquest" (1993:80-81). Lezama Lima here both modifies and parodies Werner Weisbach's famous discussion of the baroque as the "art of the Counter-Reformation" to, in Bhabha's words, "estrange the grounds of authority, the rules of recognition" of such imposing and canonical Old World definitions. Lezama Lima postulates that the baroque in the New World has an invigorating healing capacity that runs opposite to a decadent debilitation in the Old; its assertive hybridity seeks to lessen the psychic wounds of the conquest and bridge caste divisions through a negotiation of cosrmolo- gies in which the participation of "alien symbols" is guaranteed in the Rousseau-like pacto de igualdad ("egalitarian contract") (1993:104) suggested by the increasingly har- monic cohabitation of disparate sign systems in the hybrid construction. Lezama Lima thus extricates New World baroque art from Weisbach's institutional notion of ba- roque aesthetics as a propagandistic, state- or church-guided form of discourse. An "art of Counter-Conquest" can only be fiercely antidogmatic, inclusive, and counter- hegemonic. For Lezama Lima the most telling example in the plastic arts of this audacious insertion of alien signifiers into European baroque cosmology is Kondori's faqade of the church of San Lorenzo in Potosi. Lezama Lima learned about Kondori's work from Kelemen's book and based his poetic analysis on the description and picture featured in it (Kelemen 1951:190-191, plate 127, Figure a).20 Kondori, says Lezama Lima, ex- presses the New World will to hybridity by grafting "Inca symbols" into his composi- tion. Kondori's temerity in San Lorenzo lies in transmogrifjing the classical architectonic motif of the caryatid-the anthropomorphic column-into a sacred Inca princess, producing what Lezama Lima playfully calls the "Indiantid" (indidtide) (1993:83). In Lezama Lima's thinking, the structural presence of such a pagan symbol within a rigid, conventional order of Catholic signifiers sets the whole composition "on fire"; when not excised or exorcised, it forces a hybrid, "plutonic" resemantization of the whole</page><page sequence="9">324 Journal ofAmerican Folklore 112 (1999) system. Kondori's portal illustrates the conflagrative dismemberment and hybrid re- composition the New World baroque art makes possible, for, like burning embers floating in a slowly cooling volcanic magma, here "the scorched fragments [of broken- down cultures] push towards a new end" (Lezama Lima 1993:83). Lezama Lima's inspired pages on Kondori not only summarize well all the tenets of neobaroque theory but also show how the theorist tries to convey the "plutonism" of Kondori's baroque performance through his own excessive and dazzling prose style.21 Lezama Lima takes the presence of heretical signs in New World baroque art to be an American act of "temerity." He does not consider these inclusions of native signifiers as a guided form ofJesuit syncretism, as Octavio Paz does in his essay on Sor Juana (Paz 1988:34-43). They represent, rather, the dominated's will to survive and persist culturally. Lezama Lima's reinvention of the baroque as New World hybrid is thus indebted to the theory of "transculturation" postulated by his fellow countryman Fernando Ortiz in Cuban Counterpoint: Tobacco and Sugar (1947).22 With "transcultura- tion," Ortiz did not consider colonial contact between "advanced" European and "primitive" indigenous societies in America as a process of erasure of the "weak" and assimilation into the "strong"; looking at how Spanish colonists adopted taino (Carib- bean indigenous peoples of Arawak descent) tobacco rituals and consumption that added an alien, "demoniac" dimension to their Catholic mores and behavior, Ortiz argues that so-called extinct cultures always survive by infecting and refashioning the symbols of the dominating culture (1947). This is what the New World transcultura- tion of the baroque in Lezama Lima's theory allows: the survival of Otherness piggy- backing on the unsuspecting signs of Empire. As Brett Levinson has argued, Lezama Lima's cultural thought does not cut off the New World baroque from its European sources but, rather, shows how the Western paradigm is itself replenished, transfigured, diversified, and, ultimately, constituted through the proliferating inscription of "alien" systems of meaning. Lezama Lima's "plutonic" theorizing of the hybrid shows how there is always an "other" within the "same" (Levinson 1996). The powerful appeal of Lezama Lima's conciliatory theory of culture in today's Cuba can be gauged by how the ideal of neobaroque hybridity is presented in a Cuban film as recent as 1993-Tomais Gutirrez Alea's Fresa y Chocolate ("Strawberry and Chocolate"). I interpret this film as the best sign of the resurgence of Lezama Lima's neobaroque thought and aesthetic among Cuban creative intellectuals since 1989. Senel Paz (1995), a young Cuban writer powerfully inspired by Lezama Lima's work and intellectual example, wrote the story and the script on which the film is based.23 I will not dwell here on how I think the film systematically illustrates the principles of "tension," "plutonism," "temerity," and "egalitarian contract." Suffice it to say that the film's protagonists, David and Diego, hold most of their conversations while a picture of Lezama Lima mounted on the wall gazes on them and that the film's climax is a "Lezamian banquet" during which, after initiating David into a more inclusive concept of Cuban culture, Diego rewards him with a first edition of Lezama Lima's masterpiece novel and neobaroque treatise Paradiso (1974). I want to just briefly comment on the neobaroque hybridity figured in the space of la guarida, the foyer room where Diego, a white gay art promoter and photographer who is a creyente ("religious believer"), re-educates David, a prejudiced and provincial revolutionary becado ("scholarship</page><page sequence="10">Salgado, New World Baroque Theory 325 student") at the University of Havana who is also an aspiring writer and a potential state informer. The walls and windows of the guarida are heavily decorated with the ubiquitous, sinuously ornate metal grills that, in "The City of Columns," Carpentier considered emblematic of Havana's baroqueness (1987:43-45).24 Elaborately carved colonial wood frames, mirrors, and furniture are juxtaposed with avant-garde sculptures of wounded saints, pictures of important literary and political figures in Cuban history, and an immense abstract expressionist canvas. In a corner there is a makeshift altar to the Virgin of Charity and other saints. The ceremonies held in this space reflect the remarkable syncretism of the cultural objects that crowd it. In Sevres rococo teacups, which Diego fancies were once owned by an aristocratic 19th-century Havana family, Diego and David drink tea and Cuban coffee. Using regular glasses, they make a toast with a bottle of smuggled whisky but not before pouring some out as an ebb6, or offering, to the orishas, for Diego, as a creyente, is not a Roman Catholic but, like his friend Nancy, an initiate in the Afro-Hispanic beliefs of Santeria. The hybridizations of codes within this space are many: the rococo cups are Cubanized; the Anglo whisky is Africanized; David, the straight, homophobic revolutionary, becomes more liberal and tolerant regarding gay and other alternative cultures within Cuba; Diego, who ironi- cally expresses some mock contempt for an alleged lack of polish and manners in Blacks, addresses the Virgin and saints in Black Santeria fashion. The extreme baroque- ness of this role and sign switching is synthesized in the way Diego playfully addresses his blue refrigerator as rojo ("red"). If this is indeed the space of the New World baroque, where hegemonic signifiers are reversed and redefined by being reassigned to opposed, subaltern signifieds, it is also Lezama Lima's space of egalitarian acceptance, of "Counter-Conquest" on the erotic as well as political sphere. Deceitful seduction, state-sponsored persecution and surveillance, class and sexual repression, and other manifestations of power are suspended, while sexual, ideological, and ethnic differences are figuratively and literally embraced. It is the space for the conciliatory merging of warring factions, for the abrazo ("embrace") between David and Diego which con- cludes the film. This embrace does not represent, however, an ideal harmony or final integration-"plutonic" tensions still abound, exile is waiting, and wounds remain open. In the end, New World baroque theory is a poetic appeal for restitution. Neoba- roque theorists remind us that European culture after the Renaissance was the direct result of Western expansionism in the Americas, that, in the multiple forms of the baroque, Europe sent to the Americas the symbolic capital generated from exploiting New World wealth and people. The neobaroque reversal makes clear that both the material and symbolic flow of the baroque moved as much from America to Europe as from Europe to America. In the 1966 novel Paradiso, arguably the best example of neobaroque poetics in fiction, Lezama Lima took this reversal to an imaginative extreme when he had a character speculate that a Peruvian mestizo writer had a shaping influence on G6ngora's aesthetic doctrines (whose "pure" European character stood as an indispensable axiom in Menindez y Pelayo's argument about the nonhy- brid, derivative character of baroque poetry in Latin America). In chapter 9, the protagonist Jose Cemi suggests that much of G6ngora's work should be read as if</page><page sequence="11">326 Journal of American Folklore 112 (1999) inspired by the tales of Garcilaso de la Vega el Inca, the mestizo author of the Royal Commentaries of the Incas who lived in C6rdoba while G6ngora was writing the Soledades ("Solitudes"), the emblematic masterpiece of Hispanic baroque poetry. Says Cemi, In G6ngora there are frequent allusions to Inca jewels, but they [the Spanish philologists] still haven't studied the relations between G6ngora and the Inca Garcilaso during the time they were both in C6rdoba. "Incas in the imagination of G6ngora," that's a delightfiiul topic: the tales told by the Inca to G6ngora about one of the great epochs of the imagination must have aroused the senses of the great prebendary at the moment he was gathering together vast prebends for his metaphors and this quiver of darts. [Lezama Lima 1974:2391 Here New World hybridization occurs at the allegedly "pure," Old World origin, and a mestizo participates in the conception of what will become the most distinctive and representative poem of the metropolitan baroque. Here we have, thus, a sign of Lezama Lima's own neobaroque "temerity": his most utopian and certainly his most irreverent New World gesture. Notes All translations in this article are mine except when noted in References Cited. 'For a review of the uses of the term in European art and literary history, see Wellek 1978. For a discussion of the baroque as a European mode of state- and church-sponsored mass suggestion though monumental aesthetics, see Maravall 1986 and Weisbach 1942. 2In the aftermath of World War II, Horkheimer and Adomo wrote on the costly social and political consequences that sprang from how the "disenchantment" of religious and mythical thinking motivated by the Enlightenment created in turn a "myth of rationality" that helped justify Western totalitarianism and expansionism in the name of science, order, and reason (see 1994). 3One sentence that illustrates well this interpretative viewpoint is the following comment from Bhabha's essay, "Signs Taken for Wonders": The demand that figures at the center of the originary myth of colonialist power "is recognizable in a surge ofjustificatory Western 'civil' discourse where the presence of the 'colony' often alienates its own language of liberty and reveals its universalist concepts of labor and property as particular, post-Enlightenment ideological and technological practices" (1994:115-116). 4Gonzilez-Echevarria writes, "The new American sensibility found in the Baroque an avenue for the different, the strange, that is to say, the American.... Through its capaciousness and proliferation the Baroque inscribed the American" (1993:198). This article owes much to Gonzilez-Echevarria's analyses of the neobaroque aesthetic and ideas of the writers I discuss. Still, while Gonzilez-Echevarria studies the modem recuperation of the baroque tradition as a way Latin American poets, writers, and theorists compensate for a weak Hispanic Romanticism, I try to evaluate this recuperation as a response to the failure of enlightened ideals to transform and modernize Latin American society and culture. As the subtitle of his 1993 book underlines, Gonzilez-Echevarria highlights New World-Old World baroque continuities and correspondences, whereas here I try to stress the ruptures. 5From 1893 on, Menendez y Pelayo put out several volumes that anthologized the poetry of each Latin American nation. He then collected and revised his prologues in Historia de la poesfa hispano-americana (1911). Among other things, Menendez y Pelayo sought to invalidate with his work what he called the "black legend," the imputation of genocidal cruelty and brutality levied against the Spanish conquistadors and colonizers in much of Protestant and postindependence Latin American historiography. An orthodox Catholic who wrote a history of the aberrations of heterodox sects in Europe to defend the establishment of the Spanish Inquisition, Menendez y Pelayo believed that the cultural and spiritual backwardness of the indigenous peoples justified the providential "civilizing enterprise" of a providential Spanish conquest. It</page><page sequence="12">Salgado, New World Baroque Theory 327 follows why Menendez y Pelayo concluded that the influence of the "impenetrable" indigenous traditions on Spanish American poetry was null and that its history could be told "disregarding altogether those assumed origins" (1911:viii). 6For expositions on Barroco de Indias, see Henriquez Urefia 1945:58-93, Pic6n Salas 1971:70-128, and Reyes 1948:71-118. For a picture of the baroque period in Mexico that aptly synthesizes these ideas, see Leonard 1959. Although throughout his career Reyes fought famously against the "bad taste" stigma attached to G6ngora and baroque writing in general, in his 1942 essay collection Ultima Tule ("The Last Thule") he still proposed that, except for some brilliant exceptions like Sor Juana, un principio de retro- gradacidn ("a retrograde principle") drove artistic activity in colonial Mexico to adopt elementary and ritualistic manifestations that had already become old and archaic in Spain, especially in theater (1991: 242-243). Despite sympathetically assessing much of the viceregal literary output in Mexico as pulcro ("dignified, deserving"), Reyes was just as critical of its superfluousness and uneven quality, arguing that, after SorJuana, the aesthetic promise of the baroque "could only retrocede" (1948:105). Henriquez Urefia drew a more benign picture of the cultural "flowering" of the colonial world in the 17th century. He argued that, despite "plenty of extravagant and useless productions," the colonies were "fortunate in upholding the baroque tradition" (1945:84) after it had suffered a "tragic spiritual collapse" in the peninsula (1945:90) because this allowed a "brilliancy" and "refinement" (1945:84) in many American works not to be found in late and post-Hapsburg Spanish art. Still, Henriquez Urefia granted that the colonial creative mind was "cramped" and inhibited (1945:90) by European traditions and prohibitions and that New World baroque art was mostly the work of a secluded criollo minority. Even the achievements in New World "ultrabaroque" architecture--in which Henriquez Urefia believed "the highest creative gifts were dis- played" (1945:91)--appear to be due more to ingenious criollo innovation than to a mestizo "Indian influence" in his account (1945:91-93). These disapproving or ambivalent notions of the colonial baroque still exercise a great deal of influence today on cultural analysis about the period and are faithfully reflected in a study as recent and influential as Octavio Paz's book on Sor Juana, especially in the first four chapters (1988:11-59). 7Some of the principal essays on New World baroque theory are Lezama Lima's 1957 "La curiosidad barroca" ("The Curiosity of the Baroque") (1993:79-106); Carpentier's 1964 "Problemaitica de la actual novela latinoamericana" ("Problems of the Contemporary Latin American Novel") (1987:7-28), 1964 "La ciudad de las columnas" ("The City of Columns") (1987:40-48), and 1975 "Lo barroco y lo real maravilloso" ("The Baroque and Magical Realism") (1987:103-119); and Sarduy's 1972 "Barroco y neobarroco" ("Baroque and Neobaroque") (1972a) and the essays collected in Ensayos generales sobre el Barroco ("General Essays on the Baroque") (1987), especially those dealing with the transition from Renais- sance to baroque cosmology, such as the 1974 "Barroco" and 1986 "Nueva inestabilidad" ("New Instabil- ity"). These New World baroque theorists also addressed the neobaroque debate implicitly and explicitly in their novels and fiction: Lezama Lima's 1966 Paradiso (1974), Carpentier's 1956 El acoso ("The Chase") (1956a) and 1974 Concierto barroco ("Baroque Concerto"), and Sarduy's 1967 De donde son los cantantes ("From Cuba with a Song") and 1972 Cobra (1972b). 8Carpentier studied architecture and wrote a history of Cuban music; he also worked as a publicist, cultural journalist, and correspondent in several countries in Europe and Latin American. After medical studies, Sarduy wrote a dissertation on European art history in Paris; there he studied with Roland Barthes and became part of the Tel Quel group. Lezama Lima earned his living as a lawyer and wrote a great deal of art criticism; against the hostility of corrupt government agencies and attempts to co-opt him, he edited and published some of the most important independent literary journals in Cuba-- Verbum (1937), Espuela de plata (1939-41), Nadie parec'a (1942-43), and the prestigious Onrgenes (1944-56). These journals devoted great attention to the plastic arts. For biographical information and critical analyses about Carpentier and Sarduy see Gonzilez-Echevarria 1977, 1987. About Lezama Lima, see the testimonies collected in Espinosa 1988. 9See Kelemen 1951, Kubler 1948, and Toussaint 1948. Ironically, in his work, Toussaint, a Mexican, does not give the same attention to hybridity as do Kubler (American) and Kelemen (Hungarian). One typical expression of Toussaint's vision of differentiation in New World baroque appears in his introduction to Arte colonial de Mixico:</page><page sequence="13">328 Journal of American Folklore 112 (1999) After a passing reemergence of Herrerian style at the beginning of the 17th century, the American Baroque still imitated the Spanish model, but began to differentiate itself slowly, and by the end of the century and the beginning of the XVII, was totally divergent from its archetype. Thus the Mexican Baroque became the living and eternal example of a new country that had acquired a separate person- ality. [1948:xiii-xiv] Yet, although Toussaint made a point of identifying the ethnic makeup of the native artisans and acknowl- edging the "soft, sad nuances" (1948:xiv) they filtered into the artworks he was able to document, he argued that this art mostly reflected the cosmopolitan interests and growing affluence of the criollo class. In their books, Kelemen and Kubler appear to be more inquisitive about noncriollo creative input in buildings and paintings, probably as a result of having written studies of pre-Columbian sculpture and architecture before beginning their studies of colonial religious art. They thus were more attentive to morphological survivals of indigenous art practices, techniques, and representations in viceregal structures. o1Lezama Lima calls American baroque "a triumph of the city" (1993:80) and analyzes the powerful aesthetic and semiotic effects densely "full" religious architecture (such as the Puebla, Mexico City, and Havana cathedrals) exerted on the open, "empty" space of the colonial z6calo, or plaza (1993:100-103). In "The City of Columns," Carpentier comments how the mal trazado, or clumsy urban design, of colonial Havana streets, profusion of colonnades, and frequent use of tinted glass panes on windows and doors were local ways of neobaroquely "bending" European standards of public space into a shape that would minimize the oppressive tropical sunlight and facilitate sociability (1987:40-48). 1Clifford writes, "It follows that ethnographic discourse ... works in this double manner. Though it portrays other selves as culturally constituted, it also fashions an identity authorized to represent, to interpret, even to believe-but always with some irony-the truths of discrepant worlds" (1988:94). This slightly ironic self-authorizing is present in Kelemen's tone throughout his book. 12Kelemen often laments the native's disregard for the deterioration of artifacts in the churches where they worship, but he always acknowledges that these are cultural and ritual belongings that are not to be "claimed" by Europeans. Kelemen's description of a Christ child sculpture in the remote Aymara village of Juli, Peru, is typical: They worship in colonial churches, within which a wealth of colonial art is disintegrating because of poverty and the lack of appreciation. But the Child Jesus, warmed by a native shawl such as any Aymara boy would wear, is well kept.... This Divine Child is of the people and through him they come nearer to the spirit of the distant God whom the white conquerors brought to their mountainous land. [1951:49] 13The book is dedicated to "the millions of children, women and men who were tortured and murdered by nations posing as cultured and Christian in the greatest massacre the world has ever known" (Kelemen 1951). 14For a discussion of the influence of Oswald Spengler's theses about "the decline of the West" on Carpentier's work and a penetrating reading of The Lost Steps, see Gonzilez-Echevarria 1977:52-61, 155-212. "1Kelemen writes, "The intermingling of Romanesque, Gothic, and Renaissance elements which oc- curred ... makes for a fascinating mixture. The compound character which resulted from this elastic application of styles prepared the way for the distinctive Baroque and Rococo of Latin America" (1951:20). 16Carpentier introduced his idea of Third World urban "stylelessness" in a section of the essay "Problems of the Contemporary Latin American Novel" (1987:12-14). '7A typical sentence from Kelemen reads, "Just as the tulip bulbs we brought from Holland produced within a few years a changed flower in our Florentine garden-as a result of different treatment, soil, sun--so the many elements of Baroque and Rococo which were brought over from Europe went through a fascinating transformation" (1951:viii). 18Following Eugenio d'Ors, in the essay "The Baroque and Magical Realism" Carpentier considers the "complex" vegetation of the American jungle and tropical landscape as baroque elements (1987:116-118). Responding to Hegel's consideration of the New World purely as "geography" or "nature" and not as history, Lezama Lima writes about the New World paisaje ("landscape") as a form of immanent culture that had "dictated" protobaroque forms of expression since and before Columbus (1993:74-78, 169-173).</page><page sequence="14">Salgado, New World Baroque Theory 329 190n Lezama Lima's manipulation of these sources, see Irlemar Chiampi's annotations (Lezama Lima 1993: n. 79-81). 20Lezama Lima takes note of Kelemen's observation that many scholars regarded the church facade "as the culmination of Hispano-America art-the masterpiece of the Andean mestizo style" (Kelemen 1951: 109). Lezama Lima's interpretation of the fapade's hybridity is much more radical than Kelemen's. Kelemen describes the peculiar caryatid in the facade only as an "exotically costumed" figure; Lezama imagines it as the representation of a stately "Inca princess." Kelemen considers that, intermixing carving and sculpting techniques, Kondori "approach[ed] his task with a different tactile sense from that of a European"; rather than "tactile," Lezama Lima describes Kondori's style as "smoldering," as if Kondori had "burnt out" the figures from the stone or shaped them out of lava or liquid metal. 21Lezama Lima writes, In the beautiful works of the Indian Kondori we can see the insertion of a temerity: the indidtide. Amidst the chubby larval angels, the dangling stone foliage, an Inca princess emerges, hieratical and luxurious, with all her attributes of power and pride. In a closed theological world still suffused with a Medieval, divine wrath, this single icon, this audacity of the stone forced to choose one among many symbols, has put all the elements on fire so that the Inca princess could walk in the procession amidst genuflections and reverences. [1993:83-84] He continues, In the copious flow of baroque accumulations, Kondori successfully inserts the Inca sun and moon symbols, elaborate and abstract pictures of Inca sirens, large angels whose mitayo Indian faces express the desolation of work and exploitation in the mines. Kondori's stone portals compete in quality and proliferation with the best of the European Baroque. Kondori had studied with care the plants, the animals, and the metallic instruments of his race, and was convinced that they could also be part of the procession of baroque symbols in the temple.... Kondori was the first who, in the domains of form, asserted an equality through the manipulation of an European style ... in an exuberance that equated [igualaba] the American leaf to the Greek trifolia, the Inca half moon to Corinthian flourishes, the charango to doric musical instruments and renaissance violins. [1993:103-104] 221 wrote the first draft of this article before the release of Levinson's book; thus, although stimulated by its reading, I cannot here develop and debate in full Levinson's provocative treatment of Lezama Lima's theory of culture in this landmark, book-length analysis of "The American Expression." Although Gon- zalez-Echevarria (1984) and Chiampi (1993) have written lucidly on the dialogue between Lezama Lima's and Ortiz's work, more needs to be done, especially about the latter's common use of "counterpoint" to structure cultural analyses. For two more contemporary scholarly applications of Ortiz's transculturaci6n concept, see Pratt 1992 and Rama 1982. 23For English translations of the film script and the short story, see Paz 1995. For a comprehensive review and bibliography of articles on the film and its makers, see Santi 1998. In this article, Santi lucidly remarks on the film's promotion of the topic of reconciliation that concerns me here, although he considers it more of an evasional "rhetoric" than an efficacious moral theme. Either way, Lezama Lima's neobaroque is clearly among the main sources of this rhetoric. 24Besides front and window fences, Carpentier discusses two other manifestations of the elaborate metal grillwork that is particular to Havana: the guardavecinos (used to block balcony-to-balcony access) and portafaroles ("lantern hangers"). The guarida's decoration features samples of both these items. References Cited Bhabha, Homi K. 1994. The Location of Culture. London: Routledge. Carpentier, Alejo. 1956a. El acoso.
