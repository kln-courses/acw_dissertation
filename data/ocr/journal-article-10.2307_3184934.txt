It has long been recognized that Christianity and Judaism were not the only monotheisms in Late Antiquity. The editors and contributors to this volume deal with its presence in Neoplatonist philosophy and pagan religion. The introduction of Athanassiadi and Frede (1-20) contains an analysis of terminology. They accept usages like 'pagan' and 'Hellene' for scholarly use, but reject expressions like 'polytheism' and 'idolatry' as derogatory. The editors offer provisional analysis towards definition of</page><page sequence="2">264 REVIEWS 'monotheism', suggesting its compatibility with Platonic ideas of the One and of subordinate angels, daemons, and 'ethnic' or 'national' gods. A. and F. rightly emphasize that the Christian monotheism of Origen, Gregory of Nyssa, and ps.-Dionysius was expressed in Platonic terms that at times subverted simpler biblical concepts of the oneness of God. They then lead the reader through select epigraphic and literary documents from the late Hellenic oracular tradition, Hermetic and magical texts, theological poetry, and philosophy, all of them suggestive of belief in a highest God and a 'drift to monotheism' as the theological koine of Late Antiquity. There follow individual studies on particular epochs or subjects. M. L. West (21-40) treats protomonotheism in the Greek archaic period, looking first at Hebrew, Akkadian, and Sumerian concepts of oneness and diversity in divinity. He then discusses the Presocratics, who largely eliminated the anthropomorphism of Homer, but substituted interpretive dilemmas, as for example Xenophanes' 'one god, greatest among gods and men' or Thales' 'everything is full of gods'. Protomonotheism gravitated round the figure of Zeus, but West concludes that 'it would be difficult to find a Presocratic who can be counted as a monotheist without qualification' (39f.). M. Frede (41-67) gives a discussion of the eight hundred years of monotheism from Plato to Augustine, finding it in Aristotle's Metaphysics where the latter talks about one particular being who governs the world, in Plato's Timaeus, where later commentators saw three principles in play God, the ideas, and matter - and among the Stoics who posited God and matter (46f.). Frede identifies overlaps in the theological koine between the Hellenic philosophers and Christian Platonists, in sources as far apart as the Psalms and Augustine's De civ. Dei (9.23), where a common pagan and Christian view is expressed about the existence of subordinate divine beings like gods and daemons. Frede also mentions the progression of Numenius' concept of the first and second gods in Origen's subordinationist theology of the Trinity. Frede observes that only the philosophically educated pagan elite was monotheistic during this epoch. Frede's essay is provocative and should become a vehicle for productive debate. In contrast, J. Dillon (69-79) examines the monotheistic and triadic tendencies of Gnosticism, a monistic system with an emanationist theory of theogony that degraded the God of the Hebrew scriptures to administering the material cosmos with other subordinate entities. Although similarly structured, there is no traceable influence from Platonism or Christianity on the Gnostics' First Principle. S. Mitchell (81-148) proposes the existence of a Mediterranean-wide cult of Theos Hypsistos, a non-anthropomorphic divinity. Its worshippers included Jews, the god-fearers (theosebeis) - Gentiles who frequented the synagogues, the oracle at Oenoanda, and Christians like the father of Gregory of Nazianzus, whose sect, the Hypsistarii, seems to have engaged in the worship of Theos Hypsistos. The cult of Theos Hypsistos had particular appeal in religiously complex regions like Phrygia, and was at times associated with lesser divine beings like angels, to which Apollo himself seems reduced in one oracular inscription. The expression Theos Hypsistos arose in the second century B.C. and appears for the last time on a dated inscription in A.D. 308/9. Mitchell tries to associate this divinity with Christian contexts, in everything from Paul's discourse at the Areopagus in Athens to Constantine's letter to Aelafius, the vicarius of Africa (121-5). I cannot accept Mitchell's view that Aelafius was not a Christian of Constantine's particular persuasion, since the emperor's letter contains the phrase 'you too are a worshipper of highest God' ('te quoque dei summi esse cultorem'), the te quoque suggesting that the men revered the same divinity, Christ. Mitchell provides a useful catalogue of all the known Theos/Zeus Hypsistos inscriptions in an appendix. The last two studies deal with the very late pagan period. P. Athanassiadi (149-83) examines Damascius' and Proclus' handling of the second-century Chaldaean Oracles. Now existing only in fragments, they exerted a powerful influence on Neoplatonist philosophy down to the time of Michael Psellus (eleventh century). Athanassiadi makes a case for the Chaldaean Oracles originating in Apamea in Syria, traces their subsequent transmission, and identifies the elements of monotheism in them. Proclus' theurgic art was tinged with the invocation of numerous divinities. In contrast, Damascius' apophatic method identifies in the Oracles a transcendent One beyond whom lies a hypercosmic abyss of non-being (Orphic Night) and a primordial divine triad that wvas affected by the philosopher's contacts with Zoroastrianism (I68-71), where mythological saviour gods nevertheless have a place. W. Liebeschuetz (I85-205) analyses Praetextatus' speech in the Saturnalia of Macrobius. Praetextatus (or Macrobius) makes a case for the multiplicity of divinities being aspects or emanations of a single supreme god, an ultimate unity, who is subsumed into a solar syncretism. Macrobius' system avoids Neoplatonist argument and is not noticably anti-Christian. Praetextatus' solar henotheism is therefore a product of traditional Roman religion, as seen in the list of priesthoods and initiations recorded in the funerary inscriptions of himself and his wife Paulina.
