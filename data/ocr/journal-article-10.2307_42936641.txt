Representing divine, semi-divine and purely decorative forms/figures, these are variously referred to in the Indian parlance as vyala / ihamriga. Therianthropic figures, a particular category of composite figures, are those combining both anthropomorphic and zoomorphic features. Aims This investigation stems from the absence of any specific work devoted exclusively to the therianthropic figures of Indian art. Here, therefore an attempt is made to explore and account for in a comprehensive manner, the diverse therianthropic figures for the period c. 600 B.C to A.D 600, from a pan-Indian and historical perspective. Method In order to arrive at an integrated understanding of the figures in the visual language, adopted here are certain aspects of the 'iconological method' as embodied in the works of Erwin Pänofsky viz. 'the history of types', 'the image as a historical symptom/ document', and exploring the 'symbolic' aspects of the image. Nature of Evidences A broad survey of the available visual evidences have unearthed a plethora of figures. These encompass major divinities, semi-divine and minor decorative figures in varied media - - lithic, terracotta and ivory. Some of the common examples of such type of figures are the naga-nagi figures, ganesha , varaha, narasimha, goat-faced figures, animal-faced matrukas, kinnaras , garuda, sphinx-like figures, piscine therianthropic figures and a host of other minor figures. Discussion The spatial and temporal patterning of the therianthropic figures indicates three stages in their general development -</page><page sequence="2">490 Bulletin of the Deccarì College 60-61 (2000-2001) i) Genesis Stage (c. 600 B.C - c. 184 B.C), when these figures appear in small numbers. ii) The Innovative and Efflorescence Stage (c. 184 B.C - A.D 300) when they gradually acquire prominence, to almost become a pan-Indian iconographie form, with such types being prolifically depicted, comprising both divine, semi-divine and decorative figures. This was the result of the large-scale patronage brought about by the burgeoning urbanization, trade and commodity production. iii )Abatement: Generai Decline (c. 400 A.D - A.D 600) where they display a gradual decline, so far as the creation of new types is concerned, coupled with the non-representation of practically most of the pre-existing therianthropic semi-divine, decorative and folk-level figurines.While in stage (I) Buddhist therianthropic images proliferate, in stage (III) the neo-Brahmanical imageries are in abundance. The therianthropic figures indicate multifarious sources of origin and inspiration. The figures basically embody a fertility / tutelary connotation with respect to their symbolism as evident from a study of their zoomorphic features. This also explains their employment on a fairly large-scale in the visual language, especially as decorative motifs. However , they were generally accorded with a sub-ordinate position by the mainstream religions, with the exception of certain neo-Brahmanical divinities e.g. varaha, ganesha, narasimha. Interestingly, the predominance of some of these popular therianthropic deities as protective figures, in the period between c. 200 B.C - A.D 300, with a new body language i.e. the abhaya mudra hand posture is apparently indicative of some crisis cults. In their morphology, these figures reveal various schémas in the arrangement of their zooidal and anthropomorphic features. The animal-headed human figure being the commonly represented schema. Conclusions The present study of the diverse therianthropic imageries of the period between c. 600 B.C and A.D 600 has shed light on the following: - a) It appears to be a pan-Indian iconographie form, b) There were no fixed conventions for the visual depiction of these figures, although their basic hybrid composition remained the same, c) The nature of the interactions between the popular-level and the mainstream religious traditions, d) The figures further corroborate the role played by the Greco-Roman influences in providing the prototype for certain therianthropic art motifs, t e) The role of the therianthropic forms in the general development of Indian iconography, and f) How historical factors indeed play an important role in the conditioning of the image.

The subsequent two chapters discuss the iconographie evolution/mutations of individual therianthropic figures (chapters III &amp; IV). The final chapter mainly deals with the interpretation of the figures from historical, symbolical and morphological perspectives (chapter V).</page></plain_text>
