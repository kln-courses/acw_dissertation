<plain_text><page sequence="1">WALTER CAHN Medieval Landscape and the Encyclopedic Tradition An esteemed colleague recently told me of his irritation that speakers at learned conferences now always seemed to feel the need to begin their papers with an abstract disquisition on questions of method, in which they paraded before the listener the complexity of their subject, and of course, their own learning and subtlety. I was inclined to agree and sympathize with my friend's complaint until I began to work on this paper, which seemed to cry out for just such an exercise. The reason for this is easy to appreciate. Landscape in the Middle Ages is a topic that is heavily, even essentially, marked by historical reflection of more recent times. But, one might reasonably ask, is it a topic at all in any meaningful sense? Scholars who from the nineteenth century on- ward sought to chart the history of a concern with landscape in art and literature were struck first and foremost by the silence of the Middle Ages on this score, by absence, in other words, or at any rate, by the apparent lack of a concrete expression in the medieval period of any- thing resembling a conception of the natural world in our sense of the term. This absence was for them a defining feature of the Middle Ages, and conversely, the appearance of landscape painting as a distinct genre in the Lowlands during the early decades of the sixteenth century marked the onset of a radically new sensibility, and could be said to constitute the harbinger of the modem era. The history of landscape (or Landschaftsgeffihl, as our German colleagues like to say) has thus been constructed as an account of the birth and the ensuing progression in the mastery of the means of natu- ralistic representation, accompanied over time by a correspondingly YFS Special Edition, Contexts: Style and Values in Medieval Art and Literature, ed. Daniel Poirion and Nancy Freeman Regalado, ? 1991 by Yale University. 11</page><page sequence="2">12 Yale French Studies successful assertion of art's autonomy from didactic or moralizing concerns.' This account, which takes us from Patenier to Constable and Monet, from the Renaissance Pastoral to Wordsworth's lyrical meditations, is certainly not unimpeachable. Naturalism and land- scape do not always coincide, as the paintings of Turner, to take only one example, demonstrate. The representation of nature is not invari- ably freighted with feeling (Gombrich, Renaissance Theory, 118). The distinction between pure landscape, which is my particular concern here, and the "impure" variety, that is to say landscape harboring ele- ments of anecdote or more or less literal messages, has also proven more difficult to maintain than was formerly assumed. Scholars now routinely seek to recover religious or political significance where only a poetic distillation of nature was once suspected. Nevertheless, the scenario that I have outlined has a certain broad persuasiveness, which is abetted by one's sense that it is congruent with larger patterns of historical change. For the question of medieval landscape, this situation has inspired two kinds of responses. Some students have sought to explain why an independent landscape painting altogether failed to develop in the Middle Ages, giving such reasons as the reign of an otherworldly spirit, or the exclusive place that this spirit gave to man's destiny and the consequent disinterest in nature that it fostered. The first chapter of Kenneth Clark's widely read Landscape into Art, where this issue is considered, indicts "the symbolizing faculty of the medieval mind" which in his view, transformed all natural objects into signs for higher things. Thus, when medieval artists turned to nature, their vision was transfixed by "the icy winds of doctrine," and flowers and trees lost their lively quality to become prototypes of the divine.2 Max J. Friedlander cites the tendency of medieval artists to render physical appearance as a sequence of sharply bounded objects, a habit fostered by the practice and prestige of sculpture. This tendency made it impos- sible to suppress the particular in favor of the whole, and to achieve the informal, hazy or indistinct effect required for a successful illusion of 1. Ernst H.

Other scholars, who find this hieratic and drastically simplified picture of the Middle Ages either wrong or at least one-sided, have disputed this view and sought to arrive at a more accurate and differ- entiated image of medieval attitudes toward nature. Some emphasize the continued practice or revival of ancient rhetorical techniques in the evocation of the landscape, and others find in the art of the later Middle Ages much that foreshadows or prepares the ground for the apparent innovations of the Renaissance.4 The historiography that has accumulated around the figure of Saint Francis of Assisi over the past hundred years has been one of the focal points of this discussion, and of the attempt to uncover medieval roots for a sensibility attuned to nature in its most manifold and quotidian aspects.5 It identifies the phenomenon not with observation or the mind's striving for order and control over our physical surroundings, but with a novel strain of religious feeling, with mysticism, and with poetry. My own subject, the encyclopedic landscape, engages other interests, that might be called descriptive or classificatory at heart. But where an understand- ing of the basis of Landschaftsgefiihl in the medieval setting is con- cerned, it does not seem very helpful to divide science from poetry, as we, who are tributary to other and more recent modes of thought, now commonly do. What can be called encyclopedic forms an enormous body of writ- ing whose models were of ancient origin, and which medieval authors were conscious of revising, expanding or condensing, but not ever wholly setting aside.6 To a greater or lesser extent, they were con- 3.

On the other hand, much encyclopedic writing about the natural world is mere enumeration and description, leavened by etymological word play, and conceived as an inventory of the Lord's creation, a more or less systematic supplement to the record of the divine work given in the opening verses of Genesis. Bartholomeus Anglicus, about whom I shall have more to say later on, claims in his treatment of the regions of the world that he will deal only with those that are mentioned in the Scriptures, but in actual fact, he cites and describes many that are not, and his reference to the geographical lore of the Bible serves only to legitimize his descriptive appetite. This descriptive interest is a fundamental trait of the images on which I shall comment. Those that are to be considered first also make apparent certain stresses within the genre to which the painters were in various ways responsive. One stems from the collection of Marvels of the East, here represented by the oldest known illustrated copy, an Anglo-Saxon manuscript tentatively dated in the second quarter of the eleventh century.7 The marvels in question are for the most part mon- strous creatures, but four items in the collection concern fabulous trees or plants. One (Fig. 1) is the so-called balsam of balm tree, also celebrated in other mirabilia collections, and described as follows: "In that place grow trees that are similar to the laurel and the olive. They produce balsam, and the place where they are found measures 151 stadia, which makes fifty leagues and a thousand paces." The artist has given us what is essentially a portrait of these exceptional plants: the trees are pushed forward-there are three of them in order to account for the plural of the text-and anything extraneous to that purpose is omitted. I shall, nonetheless, venture the thought that the sinuous, billowing foliage, barely contained within the frame, might be read as an evocation of the plant's miraculous powers of germination. The sense of space that is built into the illustration perhaps also means to translate into visual terms the notion of a distinctive setting or place, stipulated in the text by the phrase in hoc loco. In the first book of his Institutions, Cassiodorus gives a description of his monastery at Vivarium, and this celebrated passage in the work inspired visual reconstructions, one of them found in a south Italian 7.

It flows into your grounds, skillfully directed wherever it is considered necessary, adequate for your gardens and your mills alike. It is indeed present when it is wanted, and when it has satisfied your wishes it goes far away; thus, being dedicated to definite service, neither is it dan- gerously rough nor can it be lacking when it is sought.

For there, with the help of the Lord, we have made pleasant ponds, where a multitude of fish may drift beneath the faithful monastery; the situa- tion so much resembles the caves in mountains that the fish in no way realizes that it is a captive, and it is free to acquire food and hide itself in the solitary caverns."9 The German artist's picture of Vivarium differs from the illustra- tion of the mirabilia just mentioned in that it is not a circumscribed portrait of a fabulous object, but a panoramic view which assembles the various features of the site enumerated or merely alluded to by the text. The vertical panel along the left side of the composition evokes for us the well-tended gardens of the monastery, which we are invited to imagine as stocked with every variety of plant species. The area to the right depicts the carefully policed river and the different places where fish can be found. The trees and flying birds in the upper part of the drawing are not mentioned by Cassiodorus, but they are in medi- eval landscape description or rhetoric the almost inevitable pendant of marine life, as when, meaning to embrace the natural world in its entirety, we say "the birds in the air and the fish in the sea." Considering this ample but orderly panorama, we are made mind- ful of just this issue-the nature of the image's dependence on the text. This is an issue that, on the whole, presents itself in a more straightfor- ward way in the case of historical or narrative illustration, endowed with an action or plot of which the image appears to give us a more or less reliable counterpart. In the case of landscape description or poetry, the relation between word and image is looser, and it would be difficult to recover from the miniature something closely resembling Cas- siodorus's description.'0 I want to discuss some additional aspects of this question in relation to an illustration that I had recently occasion to treat in another context. It is a composition found in a French paraphrase of parts of the books of Daniel and Macchabees contained in a manuscript made in northeastern France around the year 1300.11 9.

Ms. 131 A 3, fol. 26) (The Hague, Royal Library) My illustration (Fig. 3) concerns Daniel's vision of the four beasts (7r 1 - 27) that in the interpretation furnished to the prophet by the Lord hi mself, adumbrate the succession of the four world empires. The four huge creatures, depicted here along the lateral and lower margins of the text column, are said to have emerged out of the sea, churned up by mighty winds, four in number (ecce quatuor venti caeli pugnabant in mari magno). The dramatic but very cursory description of the phys- ical setting of the vision does not play a significant role in the exegesis of the prophecy, though artists of the earlier Middle Ages who occa- sionally take the vision as their subject do seek to come to terms with it. They do so, as a rle, with the help of the conventional persofi ca- tion of the winds borrowed from ancient art, a hirsute and winged mask spewing air. 12The French paraphrase of Daniel dispenses with these anthropomorphic winds, and we find in their place a sort of graphically mimetic ideogram, tear-shaped and shaded with linear stri- ations and flourishes. This case reminds us that the rendering of nature in the ancient world and in the Middle Ages is often made by way of personifications, not only of winds, but of other entities like rivers, the earth and n atura herself. Did the artist in this instance fear that in giving his winds the 12.

However this may be, the shift from an anthropomorphic to a mimetic interpretation of natural phe- nomena that confronts us in the French manuscript has some impor- tant implications for the development of landscape representation. It is not, of course, the case that the wiggly and striated blobs give us a more plausible image of a wind than the grotesque bearded masks with wings. But a survey of the art of the high and later Middle Ages that might be fruitfully undertaken would show up other examples of the substitution of the former for the latter, and of a more general tendency at this time for personifications of nature to disappear in favor of land- scape constructed by purely formal means. The reasons for this change involve large-scale speculations that I shall avoid, since they would take me far from my subject. But in the case at hand, a more immediate consideration presents itself: the translator renders the rather lapidary Latin venti into the much more vivid French phrase tourbillons de vent, and tourbillons, I suggest, are what we have in the margins of the manuscript. In a more general way, one might also hazard the sug- gestion that personifications must have seemed naturally suited to the loftier and literary Latin, while the vernacular could more easily ac- commodate itself without them. The encyclopedia which is most closely identified with the depic- tion of landscape is Bartholomeus Anglicus's De proprietatibus rerum. What we know of this author comes to very little. Perhaps of English origin, he was a Franciscan friar active at the University of Paris around the second quarter of the thirteenth century, before being called to take up the direction of the Minorite studium in the new province of Sax- ony. His success as an author owes much to this Parisian connection. He lived at a moment when the production of books by lay and profes- sional scribes and illuminators in the growing capital had become a vigorous and well-organized industry. His work was thus absorbed into the circuit of recommended or approved books for students, and judg- ing by the number of surviving copies, became something of an aca- demic best-seller. Its only serious rival in this respect among medieval encyclopedias was Isidore of Seville's Etymologiae, whose vogue, how- ever, was essentially limited to the early Middle Ages, and whose diffusion and reception involved rather different factors. In his own time, which is customarily regarded as the great age of encyclopedic enterprises. Bartholomeus's chief competitor was of course Vincent of Beauvais, whose Speculum majus indeed towers over his work through its sheer enormity and all-encompassing ambition, as over just about</page><page sequence="9">WALTER CAHN 19 everything else on the thirteenth-century literary landscape. But just this fact, I think, prevented it from achieving a comparably large diffu- sion, since the production of a complete copy of the work, to say nothing of fully illuminated copies, would have put both producer and buyer under some strain. It is therefore only the first section, the Speculum historiale, of which we encounter copies in any number. De proprietatibus rerum is a more compact work, normally com- plete in one volume. It owes this more manageable quality to the fact that, as indicated by the title, it concerns the physical world and the properties of things, omitting sacred and secular history altogether.13 The work comprises nineteen books, whose topics are arranged in a hierarchical order beginning with God (1), followed by the angels, the parts of man and of the cosmos. The books that engendered the land- scapes that I shall briefly discuss come afterward, and concerns matter and form (10), the birds (12), the earth (14), the provinces of the world (15), precious stones and metals (16), trees and plants (17), and the different kinds of animals (18). At the end, Bartholomeus furnishes a long list of authorities whose works he claims to have drawn on. For the books which interest us, it is primarily Isidore, and to a lesser extent, Pliny and Orosius that are cited. Whether the manuscripts of these authors that he and his contemporaries were able to consult also contained images that might in some fashion have entered into the fabric of his work is doubtful, at least in regard to the second and third of these authors, whose works were only very sparingly illustrated in the Middle Ages. For Isidore, the matter is somewhat less clear-cut. The manuscripts of his Etymologiae contain as a rule only diagrams in relation to the teachings of the author on geometry and the degrees of kinship. But there is a twelfth-century copy of the work from the south German monastery of Zwiefalten in which the subject of the respec- tive books of this encyclopedia are identified in more or less literal fashion by lively, if highly abbreviated images set within the initials. For De montibus in Book 14, we thus have a wavy peak sprouting verdure and trees (Fig. 4); for Book 15, De civitatibus, a view of a walled and turreted city (Fig. 5).14 This is the system that the books of the thirteenth-century en- 13.

The early copies of the De proprietatibus are rather modest productions with respect to decoration, and a full sequence of illustra- tions seem only to have been introduced in connection with the French translation of the work, made by Jean Corbechon in 1372 at the behest of the bibliophile king Charles V, at a time when independent vignettes, permitting a more extended and spacious pictorial treat- ment, had very largely supplanted the older historiated initial in Pari- sian book illumination. Corbechon's original presentation copy of the Propriete des choses is lost, but its cycle of illustrations survives in thirteen copies of the later fourteenth and early fifteenth centuries, among them a manuscript now at Iena, which is the source of the images to which I shall refer. 15 The landscapes that precede Book 12 on the variety of birds and Book 17 on the different plants and trees (Fig. 6) are rather calculated, not to say artificial compositions, a trait that we are most likely apt to find unsympathetic. It results, of course, from 15. Iena, Universitatsbib. Ms. El. f. 80. Irmgard Kratzsch, Uber die Eigenschaften der Dinge.

The composition that introduces Book 15, which concerns various lands and provinces has, on the other hand, a different and much more novel character (Fig. 7). The artist had to combine here not easily circumscribed entities like birds and trees, but subdivisions of the world with particular geo- graphic and cultural identities. The subject of the painting is thus landscape itself, or as the text invites us to say, a view of a province or pays, to become in later parlance a paysage. This is reflected in the painting, which is much more casually composed and spatially fluid than the rendition of the author's catalogue of trees, and dispenses as well with the flat, ornamented backdrop in favor of a bluish sky acti- vated by white linear flourishes simulating cloudlets. Bartholomeus's treatment of the pays et provinces is of special interest, as Leopold Delisle noted in a fundamental essay devoted to the Propriete des choses published just over a century ago. 16 Book 14 of Isidore's Etymologiae is Bartholomeus's basic source here, but Isidore is much more cursory in his characterization of the different parts of the world, and since he was dependent on Greek and Roman sources, his nomenclature of the provinces has a distinctly Mediterranean col- oration. In the territory that would now be included in western Europe, he lists outside of Italy only Germania, Gallia, Belgae and Hispania. 16. Leopold Delisle, "Traites divers sur les propridtes des choses," Histoirelittemaire de la France 30, (1888): 353ff.</page><page sequence="12">22 Yale French Studies For Bartholomeus and his readers, this was no doubt a serious short- coming, and his discussion of the same subject includes entries for the major territorial subdivisions of France, Germany and Spain, taking note also of England and Ireland.17 He is also more expansive than his predecessor on the distinctive features of each province, including here and there an appreciation of its inhabitants and local customs. The description of Flanders, which is particularly acute, thus registers the importance of the cloth industry, and the inhabitants' reliance on peat fuels dug up from marshes in order to palliate the shortage of wood. We are made aware by the churches, castles, windmills, and other struc- tures in the painting of the Iena manuscript that the pays as it is conceived by Bartholomeus is not a raw slice of geography but a piece of nature that has been socially invested and structured in particular ways by implicit human agents.18 After this initial Paris-centered production of illustrated copies of the Propriete des choses, roughly spanning the reigns of Charles V and Charles VI, the initiative seems to have passed to provincial centers of the kingdom, following in this respect a general trend. There is in these somewhat later copies of the work a remarkable further elaboration of landscape representation, which would deserve closer scrutiny. A manuscript thought to have been written and illuminated around 1440 in a center of western France, perhaps Angers, transforms the author's list of precious stones and metals (Book 16) into a dramatic panorama of rocky peaks and ravines (Fig. 8).19 The extraordinary painting in a copy of the work made in the southern Netherlands and perhaps at- tributable to the painter of Valenciennes Simon Marmion is attached to Bartholomeus's explanation of the four basic elements constitutive of man (Book 4), normally depicted in schematic or allegorical form, and not easily imaginable as the subject of a landscape.20 The painter's attempt to treat the interplay of fire, air, water and earth as a purely sensory spectacle is Landschaftsgefiihl in an almost excessive sense, and can hardly be said to have been provoked in a literal fashion by the 17. In his Imago mundi (1410), Pierre d'Ailly also complains about the virtual si- lence of Orosius, Isidore and other ancient writers on geography for their near silence on the provinces of Gaul and Flanders.

A historical chronicle concerned with Flan- ders excerpts Bartholomeus's description of that province, and with it, a deep prospect in which the land, perhaps a shade too amiably, exhib- its the marks of cultivation and industry for which it was already famous (Br.
