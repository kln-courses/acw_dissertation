<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Glen Dimplex Artists Award Exhibition Irish Museum of Modern Art April-July, 1998 Excellent Dynamite Palace Studios, Dublin March-April, 1998 Where did it all go wrong? As some one usually asks in those post-match panel dis cussions. The Glen Dimplex Artists Award is, as the cata logue for the shortlist exhibi tion rather optimistically puts it, "now in its fifth successful year." And on paper the shortlist looked plausible, if a little unexciting. When it was originally released, most comment was probably aroused by the inclusion of Janet Mullarney, a fine artist with a creditable track record, but one who comes out of a background of wood-carving, not the sort of practice usually associated with the forward-looking, get-up-and-go aspirations of the Award. There is no objec tive reason as to why this should be so, but there is an undeniable perception that the award is targeted at a certain kind of work, the kind that largely eschews tra ditional media and practices unless, and it's an important exception in the context of this year's shortlist, they are given the benediction of irony. Step forward, Messrs Mac Dermott and MacGough, who form an artistic partner ship so arch it's gothic, along the lines of Gilbert and George's living-sculpture per sonas. Their conceit is that they inhabit the past. They opted to give their section of the exhibition over to a clut tered environment, a frenetic jumble of retro kitsch and pastiche paintings and deco rations, so that the whole thing was a kind of fusty set design, but one that, as you worked your way through it, and whether that was the intended effect or not, *^mwmm degenerated into what |^H8| seemed like panicky ^^HB incoherence. As part of all this you encountered some of The Conspiracy Paintings which, with some trappings, formed their Temple Bar show. By comparison, that exhibition was concentrated and involv ing, marred chiefly by that studied archness, under pinned by a facile postmod ern notion of presence and _________________________________________ ._________________________________^w,?^^^~ ___________________________________________ iki_f_____________-___^_^__H-_P^^^^^^^ Aftermath, 199$^ wKm?.I*.IjjjBBllMi h ._...: :^^PB_______________________L .

For whatever reason their shortlist-show installa tion was a mess, and its messiness was to some degree responsible for the # impression of messiness that dogged the show as a whole. How did this happen? Well, the overall layout was also to blame. What presum ably began as a series of tac tically fragmented, interrupt ed spaces quickly became a series of chaotically frag mented, interrupted spaces. You could put it down to bad luck that projects originally envis aged by Hans Peter Kuhn and Philip Napier appar ently proved impossible on logistical grounds. But then, one would have to say that the enormous empty courtyard at the Royal Hospital looks as if it was just waiting for an artist like Kuhn to do something there. Bud getary constraints are a fact of life, but it seems counter-productive to have put him on the shortlist on the basis of a particular kind and scale of work when it was cer tain that he wouldn't be able to make or recreate any thing remotely comparable. This is one point at which the relative importance of the shortlist show becomes an issue. To be fair, the installa tion Kuhn did show was interesting?in a low-key kind of way. Philip Napier's installation started out well but, by the time you'd put the various pieces together and wondered what on earth it was all about, it looked distinctly pretentious. It's true that Napier likes outlandish propositions and surreally improbably set-ups that flirt with pretension, and that humour is often his saving grace. And there was an ele ment of humour in his instal lation here, but like the piece itself it was not quite enough. He accompanied it with an observation that seems, stripped of its tortu ous phrasing, to boil down to an unremarkable statement about the meanings of a pub lic icon being dependent on its cultural, temporal and his torical context. In a terrific central image, two chimneys (why ____? &amp; ^m _________ &gt;L_i ___________ __________________ ^___P^I __________________________________ __________________________[ ' iw\I ;&lt;_________________H ___________________^r- -J % m ij^^^^^l _________________________K____Mr * ^_L ^___ ___________________________________________ I j6hn Redding, Ves can Boogie (starring the wife) ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^| two?) belched noxious soot into their respective rooms. You could smell the soot throughout the whole wing of the museum: a pungently effective detail. Yet overall the piece lost its way. Putting together scraps of informa tion we learnt that the instal lation related to the Royal Hospital's past role. The noise related to horses in stables, but you'd be hard put to fig ure that out just by listening to it. The facsimile of a William of Orange mural against one wall might have pointed us to a specific inter pretation: something along the lines of the grime of the past contaminating the pre sent. But not necessarily, or compellingly. Again, despite the promise, the impression was of something that hadn't quite come together. Janet Mullarney's Domestic Gods were pick-'n'-mix deities that mingled not only cultural but also divine and mundane sources. There was a good idea here, but the pieces were heavy-handed in embodying it. Mullarney's work usually has the air of being made by a fast, instinc tive carver. The rough-hewn, improvisatory nature of her sculptures relates to forms of popular devotional art she encountered in India, but the new work was an uneasy compromise between these quicksilver qualities and a more considered, finished approach. In fact her best exhibited pieces here were probably two older ones, Waiting for Illumination and the exceptional Aftermath. It could well be that her work is in a transitional stage. Siobhan Hapaska is highly regarded and was widely tipped as favourite to win the award, as much for her illus trious track record as for her showing here. Stray, her tum bleweed on tracks shuttling to and fro, could almost be a homage to Bruce Nauman. There's also an aesthetic of ugliness evident in her glossy fibreglass pieces, from the punningly anthropomorphic car body Mule to the wall mounted pieces that look like fragments of body mould ings, perhaps for motorbikes. Tucked away in a connecting passage was The Inquisitor, the other side of Hapas ka's imaginative world, a lifelike waxwork. But here her calculated stylistic promiscuity seemed less a creative strategy than another manifestation of the show's bittiness. She is a Goldsmith's graduate, and to an alarming extent that statement exactly characterises her work. Goldsmiths sprang to prominence as the cradle of the new British art with Damien Hirst's Freeze, an artist-initiated exhibition that galvanised the London art scene. Recently, artists working in Palace Studios in Foley Street curated a multi media exhibition of con temporary art featuring work by Irish, Scottish, English and Australian artists. It was called Excellent Dynamite, appealing loosely to notions of excellence and surprise. Unfortunately, it only ran for one week and was minimally documented, rather restrict ing its chances of building an audience over a time span. It was also an out-of-the-way venue for a Dublin audience that is notoriously ingrained in its habits, as galleries who have moved premises have repeatedly discovered. Never theless, Excellent Dynamite had real, if erratic, energy and spirit. In past years, the Glen Dimplex shortlist show has CIRCA 85, Autumn 1998, page 50</page><page sequence="3">apparently had an inhibiting effect on several partici pants. For a number of rea sons, their exhibited work didn't adequately reflect their strengths. Under the circumstances, you can see how that could easily hap pen. The pressures have probably been compounded by the uncertainty about how important the shortlist show is in the eventual allo cation of the award. The fact is that so far it looks as if it has been more or less cru cial, not least because sever al of the adjudicators are usually from abroad and may not be familiar with, particularly, the work of Irish artists shortlisted. Those sorts of pressures did not operate on the Palace Studios artists, though they clearly felt under pressure to make an impact, because in broad terms their work was domi nated by the notion of the conceptual one-liner, the attention-grabbing idea that hits you instantaneously and sticks in your mind. As it happened the star of the show was certainly the good-natured, heavily pregnant woman who, attired in sandals and bikini, danced enthusiastically to a low quality recording of Yes sir I can Boogie which, with the addendum (starring the wife) formed the title of John Redding's video, a work that really stymied any predictable response. There was a lot of comparably jokey stuff, but nothing bet ter. Mark Cullen's explosive Thread on my eggs lived up to the dynamite part of the title. It featured a manipu lated chicken carcass, I did It My Way as a soundtrack and an exploding 'egg'. Even grimmer humour was evi dent in the form of Joanne O'Brien's eviscerated panda bear, complete with stuff ing. Kevin Francis Gray's Smack ma boy up eschewed humour altogether with its oblique, uneasy account of an episode of casual vio lence, though it didn't even try to compete with the technically exceptional video of the song that pre sumably inspired it. Michael Canning's accomplished, elegiac paintings looked strong. The inclusion of a photocopied snap of a Mar ian shrine in a hedgerow captioned: Unknown Artist; Title unknown was a poten tially flip gesture that actu ally worked in the context. Glen Dimplex and Excellent Dynamite are two sides of the same coin. Even though it is by nature ponderous and institutional ly led, in a way the exis tence of the former is designed partly to encour age events like the latter. Perhaps the surprising thing is that there haven't been more artists' curatorial ini tiatives like Dynamite or those in Belfast's Queen Street Studios, and other relatively low-key studio co op shows. If this year sees the Glen Dimplex in slight disarray, the chances are that it's a minor hiccup rather than anything more serious, and even given its undoubted merits, Excellent Dynamite couldn't quite be said to have taken the initiative and shifted the balance of power. There was a certain air of the graduation exhi bition about it, partly because a lot of the materi al felt like first drafts of things that might achieve more finished form. But it was more than welcome nonetheless.
