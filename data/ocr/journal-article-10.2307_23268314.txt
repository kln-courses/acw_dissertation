<plain_text><page sequence="1">Architecture, Individualism, and Nation: Henry van de Velde's 1914 Werkbund Theater Building Katherine M. Kuenzli Since Walter Gropius's inclusion of Henry van de Velde's Werkbund Theater (1914) in his Bauhaus book International Architecture (1925), the building has been understood as a precursor to an international architecture and eventually to what was labeled the International Style (Fig. I).1 Following Gropius, architecture historians have downplayed the build ing's complex politics and elaborate relations between archi tecture, painting, sculpture, and stage design in favor of overdetermined notions of simplicity and functionality. De spite its association with internationalism, this theater build ing was designed for the German Werkbund's first exhibition in 1914 in Cologne, where it featured contributions from a variety of Germanic artists. A fountain in the form of a bather by Georg Kolbe stood in front of the building (Fig. 2); its figural language clashed with four nonfigural sculptures by Hermann Obrist, including two relief sculptures set into the building's facade (Fig. 6) and two more works positioned in its side gardens located to the north and south of the theater complex (Figs. 3, 4) .2 The building's interior featured painted murals by Ludwig von Hofmann (Fig. 20), painted tiles by Lissy Brentano, and a sculptural relief by Kolbe's student Milly Steger (Fig. 5). The building's auditorium made possi ble new approaches to set design and stage lighting that van de Velde pioneered along with theater directors Otto Brahm and Viktor Barnowsky. Far from a seamless architectural whole, the Werkbund Theater represented an awkward marriage of convenience among artists working in different modes. Rational massing of volumes in the building exterior, combined with stucco rendering, signaled van de Velde's embrace of affordable modern materials and functionalist building principles. Smooth, alternately convex and concave surfaces set off a lively interplay of light and shadow across the building's facade. Kolbe and others reinforced the optical qualities of van de Velde's architecture by lending their figures simplified forms and continuous, dynamic contours. Kolbe's fountain displayed the most rigorous optical emphasis; he physically isolated his Bather from the viewer in a large water basin, where it appeared as an ocular vision amid spraying water jets (Fig. 1). In contrast to the overwhelming visuality of van de Velde's and Kolbe's streamlined forms and smooth shells, Obrist's sculptures presented elaborate, tactile surfaces grounded in his study of the natural world. The undulating tendrils of a phallic bud in Movement expressed the never-ending vitality of plant life (Fig. 4). The intricately carved surfaces of his foun tain suggested a network of microscopic marine organisms (Fig. 3) .3 Clusters of grapes nestled in the windows appeared above more abstract, alternately wave- or leaflike ornaments (Fig. 6). In all his sculptures Obrist eliminated pedestals in order to make them more physically present and an integral part of nature. He cultivated principles of tactility and bio logical vitalism, whereas Kolbe, von Hofmann, and the others crafted sleek surfaces, which seemed to flicker and partially dissolve in a play of light and shadow. Van de Velde hesitated to include Obrist's sculptures, which were added hastily and at the last minute, unlike contributions by von Hofmann and others. Obrist's fountain, completed about 1910, remained disconnected from a water source, unlike Kolbe's fountain, which sprayed water for the duration of the exhibition. The only existing photograph of Obrist's fountain dates not from Cologne, but from Munich, where it was displayed in 1912 in the courtyard of the Bavar ian Applied Arts Association (Fig. 3).4 Obrist created his relief sculptures specifically for the theater building, but they were added only after its completion. Photographs of the Werkbund Theater's foyer and facade reveal that the two eye-shaped windows on the front of the building admitted copious amounts of natural light before they were partially blocked by Obrist's reliefs (Fig. 7). In their insistent materi ality, Obrist's reliefs complicated van de Velde's original design, in which three unadorned window mullions repeated the vertical columns supporting the building's main entrance in rhythmic succession (Fig. 8).5 While the Werkbund Theater featured contributions from a variety of artists, none is more important and problematic in the context of the Werkbund Exhibition than van de Velde's allegiance with Obrist. Certainly Obrist's sculptures did not belong to the building's original conception and even contradicted it; nevertheless, they take on significance within the context of the 1914 exhibition and the controver sies that it generated. Of the artists who contributed to the theater building, only Obrist and van de Velde belonged to the Werkbund; indeed, they had been among its founding members. Along with ten other founding artist-members of the organization, van de Velde and Obrist were celebrated in a section of the exhibition that surveyed the contributions of Werkbund artists, who were dubbed the "Twelve Apostles."6 Historians have characterized Obrist and van de Velde as allies at the Werkbund Exhibition, but the theater building discloses significant differences in their respective definitions of theater architecture and its relevance to Werkbund objec tives. Understanding these differences deepens our appreci ation of the building's position in relation to the 1914 exhi bition. The debates it generated constitute a watershed moment in the emergence of modern architecture. Organizers of the 1914 exhibition sought to present the German Werkbund's history and current innovations to the public for the first time since its founding in 1907.' Estab lished to promote the role and function of art in industrial production, the German Werkbund represented a loose and diverse association of artists, architects, craftsmen, designers, and industrialists who sought to increase the quality and aesthetic distinction of German architecture, crafts, and in</page><page sequence="2">252 ART BULLETIN JUNE 2012 VOLUME XCIV NUMBER 2 1 Henry van de Velde, Werkbund Theater, German Werkbund Exhibition, Cologne, 1914 (artwork © 2012 Artists Rights Society [ARS], New York/SABAM, Brussels; photograph © Bildarchiv Foto Marburg) 2 Georg Kolbe, Bather, 1914.

The Werkbund was founded to promote and protect the rights of artists who produced original and cost-effective designs for industry. Artist-designers, Werkbund founders reasoned, would fuel the growth of Germany's light industries by fashioning distinctive and durable goods that could compete with products from the leading industrial powers, then England, France, and the United States. Despite efforts to present a unified front at the Werkbund's first public exhibition, the 1914 show brought to light funda mental differences among its members in regard to Germa ny's path to international stylistic and industrial prominence. Along with Werkbund Administrative Director Ernst Jackh, Hermann Muthesius, the chief reformer of Prussia's applied arts institutions, wanted the exhibition to consolidate the Werkbund's increasingly close ties to the government and large industries. Individual artistry belonged to the Werk bund's past, Muthesius reasoned, and in planning the exhi bition he sought to steer the organization toward more prag matic objectives. Muthesius exercised a quasi-dictatorial hand over exhibition planning in order to win the favor of local officials and private industry. His efforts were opposed by a faction of Werkbund members led by Karl Ernst Osthaus, art reformer and owner of two museums, who insisted on the primacy of individual artists who alone, he believed, could stimulate international demand for German products. These differences divided the Werkbund's Executive Committee, to which van de Velde, Osthaus, Muthesius, and Jackh be longed. Disagreements between Werkbund members took on a public dimension at the Werkbund Congress that coincided with the exhibition. The night before the congress opened, Muthesius circulated ten "Theses," or principles of good design, in which he reiterated the need for sensible design in partnership with big industry. He called on industries of scale to forge export markets for German goods and subordinated artistic to economic imperatives. "Individual objects pro duced by artists," Muthesius argued, "can not even begin to</page><page sequence="3">HENRY VAN DE VELDE'S 1914 WERKBUND THEATER 253 3 Hermann Obrist, Fountain in the courtyard of the Bavarian Association of the Applied Arts, Munich, ca. 1912, photo board. Kunstgewerbesammlung, Museum fur Gestaltung Zurich (artwork in the public domain; photograph by Betty Fleck, © ZHdK) satisfy domestic demand." He characterized artistic innova tion as hampering the Werkbund's aggressively expansionist economic objectives.8 These "Theses" provoked the ire of van de Velde, Obrist, and Osthaus, among others, who had suf fered under Muthesius's heavy-handed exhibition planning. On receiving the ten points, artists in the Werkbund asked van de Velde, a Belgian who had moved to Germany, to draft "Counter-Theses," which Obrist then translated into German. Osthaus signed van de Velde's manifesto along with Obrist, August Endell, Bruno Taut, Bernhard Pankok, and Hans Poelzig. Gropius sympathized with van de Velde but agitated largely behind the scenes. Unlike Muthesius, van de Velde and his co-signatories assigned primary importance to the artist. "The Artist," they proclaimed, "is in his innermost essence a burning individualist, a free spontaneous creator." The Werkbund's main objective, they insisted, should be to cultivate "gifts of invention, of brilliant personal inspiration," which alone could create designs that would stimulate inter national demand for German products.9 Their defense of individual artistic freedom earned van de Velde, Obrist, and Osthaus the title of "individualists." The Werkbund Theater stood at the heart of this contro versy as a rallying point for "individualists." In addition to van de Velde and Obrist, Osthaus lobbied in favor of the building 4 Obrist, Movement, 1914, plaster, 6 ft. (1.84 m). Kunstgewerbe sammlung, Museum fur Gestaltung Zurich (artwork in the public domain; photograph by Heinrich Helfenstein, © ZHdK) and published a passionate defense of its principles in the Frankfurter Zeitung that coincided with the Werkbund Con gress. Critics in 1914joined Osthaus in recognizing the Werk bund Theater as one of the exhibition's three architectural innovations, alongside Taut's Glass House and Gropius and Adolf Meyer's Model Factory. Van de Velde's building stood for artistic innovation not only in its design but also in its function. Billed as an "Artists' Theater," the building hosted avant-garde Symbolist and Expressionist drama, including a production of Emile Verhaeren's The Cloister (Le cloitre), per formed in the original French, as well as experimental dance performances by Alexander Sacharoff, among others.10 While Muthesius's views and proposals have received sig nificant scholarly scrutiny, the same cannot be said of "indi vidualist" arguments, despite their striking modernity and continued relevance. Until recently, accounts of the theater building and the Werkbund debates have characterized van de Velde and his associates as out of touch with economic realities and social currents.11 Frederic Schwartz successfully reversed this trend in scholarship by demonstrating how Osthaus and van de Velde deployed design as an agent of culture within a commercial, capitalist system.12 More can be done to deepen our understanding of the "individualist po sition." Far from unified, "individualists" came together over the course of 1913 and 1914 to defend artistic experimenta</page><page sequence="4">254 art bulletin june 2012 volume xciv number 2 5 Milly Steger, Relief sculpture, located over the entrance to the Werkbund Theater's side foyers, German Werkbund Exhibition, 1914.

With its innovative form and experimental perfor mances, the Werkbund Theater lay at the center of their arguments. However, each of the "individualists" defined "theater architecture" and "nation" in relation to distinct and competing artistic and political agendas. Recovering van de Velde's, Osthaus's, and Obrist's conflicting proposals for the building reveals not only the ambitions but also the contra dictions at the heart of the theater project, as well as of the Werkbund's policies in general. Far from outmoded or anachronistic, "individualism" and the Gesamtkunstwerk, or total work of art, lay at the heart of fraught attempts to forge Germany's modernism and cultural politics. The Werkbund Theater's place in architectural modern ism has proven difficult to discern, as it overlapped with both Expressionism and the New Building, although it belonged properly to neither.13 It first drew the attention of Expres sionist architects and critics, who valued its sculptural form, dramatic light effects, and synesthetic coordination of the arts and visual media. At the same time, though, the build ing's unornamented surfaces, massing of architectural vol ume, and rational auditorium design aligned it with function alist principles. In 1920, van de Yelde signaled his distance from a visionary, mystical strain of Expressionist architecture, which he characterized as self-indulgent and escapist.14 Ar chitect Eric Mendelsohn associated the building with a ratio nalist strain of Expressionist architecture when he took it as a model for his Einstein Tower (1920-21). Yet Mendelsohn never saw the building in person and mistakenly identified its</page><page sequence="5">HENRY VAN DE VELDE'S 1914 WERKBUND THEATER 255 stucco construction as reinforced concrete, a myth that has been unquestioningly perpetuated in the secondary litera ture.15 Although van de Velde had experimented with con crete as early as 1910, time and financial restrictions forced him to work in metal and brick with stucco facing in Cologne. Functionalist aspects of van de Velde's design led Gropius to align the Werkbund Theater with the New Building, char acterized by a tendency toward deindividualization and mass production, in his 1925 publication International Architec ture}6 Gropius's opposition of individualism to functionalism inevitably led him to suppress the subjective dimensions of van de Velde's building. In reproducing only the building exterior, Gropius masked the Werkbund Theater's synes thetic and interartistic dimensions, its coordination of all the arts to provoke a totalizing aesthetic experience. Gropius's omission of the building's subjective elements must be seen in light of his attempt between 1923 and 1925 to redirect the Bauhaus away from its Expressionist origins toward machine production.17 The best accounts of the Werkbund Theater were written in the 1920s by architectural historians, unaligned with Ex pressionism and the New Building, who recognized that the modernity of van de Velde's building lay in its aesthetically innovative and technologically advanced stage and audito rium. In his magisterial architectural survey from 1927, Gustav Adolf Platz characterized the Werkbund Theater as among the most progressive theater buildings of its day, distancing its formal rigor from the more romantic and im practical designs of Poelzig at the Grosses Schauspielhaus, Berlin.18 For his part, Walter Miiller-Wulckow discussed the Werkbund Theater as a communal structure in his survey of modern German architecture (1929). He cited the Werk bund Theater alongside Joseph Maria Olbrich's Darmstadt Exhibition Hall, Max Berg's Jahrhunderthalle, Breslow, and Heinrich Tessenow's Festspielhaus, Hellerau, as those build ings constructed before World War I that most displayed a desire for unity and a communal impulse.19 While valued by historians of the 1920s, principles of the ater design and national unity, qualities co-opted by the National Socialists in the 1930s, virtually disappeared from architectural histories written after 1945, which defined mod ernism in opposition to totalitarian impulses.20 The Werk bund Theater continued to appear in narratives of modernist architecture written after World War II, but historians treated it in a confused and contradictory manner. Following Men delsohn, they mistakenly cited its construction as consisting of reinforced concrete in an attempt to insert it into a tech nologically driven narrative of modern architecture. At the same time, they characterized van de Velde as an outmoded Jugendstil designer whose affective, individualist approach to design was out of step with twentieth-century economic, so cial, and technological imperatives.21 However progressive their origins, early twentieth-century modernist experiments in theater architecture and staging were tainted by associa tion with fascist propaganda in the minds of historians writ ing in the post-World War II period. By focusing on architecture alone, historians since World War II have overlooked van de Velde's real contribution to German modernism: his intervention into lively and unre solved debates concerning the total work of art and its signif 7 Van de Velde, Werkbund Theater, view of the front window from inside the theater, before the addition of Obrist's reliefs (artwork © 2012 Artists Rights Society [ARS], New York/SABAM, Brussels; photograph © Fonds van de Velde, ENSAV La Cambre, Brussels) icance to the German nation. Innovations in stage design shaped van de Velde's architecture in ways that have gone unacknowledged. Indeed, his work foregrounds how notions of the Gesamtkunstwerk contributed to the simplification of architectural form after 1900. Juliet Koss notes overlaps be tween stage design and theater architecture in her study of the Munich Artists' Theater, but she misleadingly opposes van de Velde's designs to those of applied arts reformers Georg Fuchs and Peter Behrens, dismissing van de Velde's work as aristocratic and outmoded."2 To the contrary, the modernist dimensions of van de Velde's focus on individual expression and aesthetic experience align it with post-World War I modernist experiments.25 The theater building's three major Werkbund protagonists, van de Velde, Osthaus, and Obrist, all "individualists," played the most instrumental role in getting the theater building constructed. Rather than sim ply supporting van de Velde, however, his allies used the theater building as an opportunity to put forward distinct, and sometimes competing, views on theater architecture and its relation to the nation. Reconstructing each "individualist" position reveals how the theater building constitutes an im portant component of Werkbund discourse and innovation that sheds new light on the shaping of German modernism. "Individualists" at the 1914 Werkbund Exhibition In organizing the 1914 exhibition, Werkbund members sought to sum up seven years of activity and demonstrate its benefits to both private enterprise and the German nation. The choice of Cologne as the site for the 1914 exhibition is significant. Although it had little affiliation with the Werk bund and was no friend to modern art, this rapidly growing city with burgeoning industries wanted to host the Werkbund Exhibition in order to announce its new economic and cul tural importance.24 City official and director of architecture and urban planning Carl Rehorst favored monumental clas sicism in architecture, an idiom apparent in Cologne's new train station and department stores.

With its central dome, pedimented portico, and sculpted hedges that stood at attention like disciplined soldiers, the building displayed a pared-down classicism. The uniformity, sobriety, and homogeneity of Muthesius's architecture communicated principles of stabil ity and balance. Theodor Fischer's main exhibition hall dis played equal restraint in its central dome crowning a classical colonnade. Monumental classicism also characterized Beh rens's Festival Hall (Fig. 10), in which he combined geomet ric architectural forms with gigantic classical nudes. A pedi ment capping the sculptures and central portal lent the building a feeling of rock-solid stasis. The Werkbund Theater departed dramatically from such reasoned classicism; in it, van de Velde redefined classicism, rejecting static monumentality in favor of a Dionysian aes thetic formulated most influentially by Friedrich Nietzsche.26 Van de Velde had discovered Nietzsche's writings in the mid to late 1890s and contributed to the Nietzsche cult in Ger many by designing the interior of the Nietzsche Archive in Weimar (1903) as well as luxury editions of Thus Spoke Zara thustra (1908), Ecce Homo (1908), and Dithyrambs of Dionysus (1914). Along with his friend and collaborator Count Harry Kessler, van de Velde emphasized the life-affirming aspects of Nietzsche's philosophy, above all, his exaltation of instincts and the senses in a post-Christian era. He identified Greek culture with Dionysian rituals of dance, which Nietzsche de scribed as defying the "spirit of gravity" and dissolving indi vidual identity in a dazzling display of light and color.'7 Dionysian dances are explicitly thematized in the Werk bund Theater in von Hofmann's murals, Steger's reliefs, Brentano's ceramic frieze, and Kolbe's fountain figure; van de Velde embraced Dionysian principles by lending his ar chitecture a ritualistic and dynamic character. Proposing art as a substitute for religion, he combined elements of the Greek theater with aspects of the medieval cathedral. The semicircle constituted by the theater building's front steps took the form of a Greek amphitheater. The building's au ditorium doubled as a cathedral nave, with the foyers func tioning as side aisles; the stage occupied the space normally reserved for the high altar and choir, and it alluded to triptychs in its tripartite structure (Fig. 11). Van de Velde did not imitate historical architectural precedents so much as mobilize them in support of his modernist, and essentially abstract, aesthetic. Patterns of light and shadow flickered</page><page sequence="7">HENRY VAN DE VELDE'S 1914 WERKBUND THEATER 257 across the building's stage and facade, destabilizing classical ideals of stasis. Of all the exhibition buildings, the Werkbund Theater was the most hotly contested by Muthesius and his allies as they planned the 1914 exhibition. Muthesius demanded no fewer than seven different designs of the building before begrudg ingly granting his approval. Continual redefinitions of the project necessitated multiple revisions. Exhibition organizers first asked van de Velde to design a cinema, then a dual purpose cinema/theater, before finally settling on a theater building.28 Whereas cinema represented a recent, commer cial art form, theater had been used to stage progressive ideas of the German nation since Johann Wolfgang von Goethe and Friedrich von Schiller. As we shall see, van de Velde and his defenders drew on theater's historical and national im portance in their advocacy for the Werkbund Theater. Once van de Velde succeeded in securing the theater building commission, Muthesius and his partners marginalized it as much as possible. They moved the building from its original planned site adjacent to the fairground entrance to a distant and unpropitious location atop a river dyke and adjacent to Gropius and Meyer's factory building (Fig. 12). Van de Velde did not obtain final approval for his building until March 1914, and it did not begin operating until mid-June, a full month after the exhibition's official opening.29 The building and its performances generated a good amount of critical controversy, but prominent "individualist" critics praised van de Velde's architecture for its artistic, expressive character, which broke with the exhibition archi tecture's staid uniformity. Adolf Behne, who would become a prominent Expressionist architect, critic, and historian after World War I, cited van de Velde's building along with Gropius and Meyer's factory and Taut's Glass House as one of the most successful pieces of exhibition architecture. Invok ing the Werkbund motto, "Spiritualization of German Work," he found the exhibition had fallen short of this principle. Behne reminded readers that "spirit is something light and free, and the spiritualization of things involves freeing them from the weight of the terrestrial." He faulted Behrens's Festival Hall and Muthesius's Farbenschau Pavilion as overly earnest. By contrast, the critic praised van de Velde's building as "festive and dynamic" and admired its auditorium's "inner glow."30 While Behne had a great deal to say about van de Velde's architecture, he offered only one word in praise of Obrist's sculptures. He was not alone in marginalizing Obrist's con tribution. Of the many critics who wrote (positively and neg atively) on the Werkbund Theater, only one, an anonymous critic writing for the Kolnische Zeitung, directly confronted the formal particularities of Obrist's works. The anonymous critic approved how "the building's parts . . . grow together to form a living stone organism," but he puzzled at Obrist's sculp tures, which lent it a strangely anthropomorphic and eccen tric appearance. Directing his attention to the fountain and Movement (Obrist's relief sculptures had not yet been put in place), the critic deemed these fit for "art philosophers, who prefer new tin to old silver." Struggling to find words for Obrist's Movement (Fig. 4), the writer compared it to "a dollop of pastry cream that has been whipped round and round to a stiff peak," as well as to "a spiral flourish from the hand of a 11 Van de Velde, Werkbund Theater, ground-floor plan (artwork © 2012 Artists Rights Society [ARS], New York/ SABAM, Brussels; from Offizieller Katalog der Deutschen Werkbund Ausstellung: Coin 1914 [Cologne, 1914], 246) Japanese calligrapher."31 Van de Velde's architecture, this critic suggested, rendered Obrist's sculptures incongruous. Belated and unfinished as it was, Obrist's contribution to the theater building should be understood in relation to Werkbund goals and controversies formulated at the 1914 exhibition. The building owed its existence to the support of its three major Werkbund protagonists, van de Velde, Ost haus, and Obrist. Far from unified, their contributions to the Werkbund Theater underline the heterogeneity of "individ ualist" arguments. Taken together, the positions of van de Velde, Osthaus, and Obrist foreground the central but con tested nature of the Gesamtkunstwerk and its importance to Werkbund policy and the shaping of German modernism. Opticality in Van de Velde's Werkbund Theater Building Despite his Belgian citizenship, van de Velde played a central role in the German Werkbund, an organization whose mem bership was otherwise limited to native German speakers. His native language was Flemish, but like many well-educated Flemings in the nineteenth century, he adopted French as his language of preference. Van de Velde worked as a painter and designer in Belgium and Paris before moving to Ger many in 1900, first to Berlin and then to Weimar in 1902,</page><page sequence="8">258 art bulletin june 2012 volume xciv number 2 GESAMT-LAGEPLAN der Deutschen Werkbund-Ausstellung KOLN 1914 ANLEGESTELLE «t»VNLEGt~ Baulidikeiten der Ausstellung 9 V,T«aIiungsji-liJuilc 10 Abortc unci WaidirSume 11 Kolncr Haus mil Garten IZ Sommerliaus Stadler mil Garten Oil 13 Ladenstrafie mlt Port u.

In 1907, he founded and directed Weimar's Grand Ducal School of Applied Arts/" Although he spent the defining years of his career in Germany, van de Velde spoke only halting German and relied on translators for his official correspondence and numerous books and articles published in German. His entrance into the German Werkbund was greatly facilitated by Karl Ernst Osthaus, Werkbund founder and member of pan-Germanic organiza tions who counted Flemish as a Germanic language. Van de Velde remained active in the German Werkbund from its founding until his forced departure from Germany in World War I.33 The year 1914 marks the high point of his involve ment, when he served on the organization's Executive and Theater Committees and galvanized the entire organization with his theater building and "Counter-Theses." Van de Velde provocatively approached the Werkbund Theater as a means of presenting his transnational architec ture aesthetic. He forged an international approach to stage and set design, first in Paris through his contacts with Stephane Mallarme, the Nabis, and Loie Fuller, and subse quently in Weimar in collaboration with Kessler and Edward Gordon Craig.34 The painterly and theatrical sources of van de Velde's architecture have been downplayed in the second ary literature in favor of a postwar emphasis on materials and function. However, his theater building reveals how cosmo politan approaches to the Gesamtkunstwerk proved a powerful factor in the simplification of architectural form. The build ing exterior needs to be understood as an extension of van de Velde's innovative set designs, in which he obtained mobile, visual effects by employing filmstrips and multidirectional electric lighting. He took inspiration from Impressionist and Postimpressionist painting and prints, Fuller's dances, and Craig's stage designs, but van de Velde went beyond them in lending their optical aesthetics full architectural realization. Although van de Velde's work has been associated with Ju gendstil design, in the Werkbund Theater he departed from Jugendstil aesthetics in eradicating ornament and emphasiz ing painterly qualities of color and light. With its focus on optical sensation, Impressionist and Post impressionist painting constituted an essential reference point for van de Velde, who began his career as a painter. Even after his 1893 "conversion" to the applied arts and subsequent embrace of architecture, he remained enthralled with Georges Seurat's and Vincent van Gogh's paintings, and he repeatedly collaborated with the Nabis between 1890 and 1914. Van de Velde would have been familiar with the Nabis' set designs for the Symbolist theater, in which they employed gauze curtains, monochromatic panels, and colored lights to partially dematerialize actors and stage scenery into abstract rhythms of line and color.35 In Paris, van de Velde also attended Fuller's dance performances (some of them captured on film), in which she projected mobile, colored lights onto yards of phosphorescently coated fabric in order to transform her body into a series of flickering optical effects.3'3 Her dances appealed to Parisian painters and printmakers, including Henri de Tou louse-Lautrec, who made her dances the subject of vividly evoc ative color lithographs in which spattered ink (crachis) suggests her garments' twinkling effervescence (Fig. 13). French painting and printraaking remained a point of reference for van de Velde in Weimar, where he worked alongside the Francophile Kessler, who acquired French Im pressionist and Postimpressionist artworks for Weimar's mu seums in addition to organizing exhibitions of advanced French and English paintings and prints. Kessler invited Craig and van de Velde to Weimar in an attempt to revive the provincial city as a European theater capital and alternative to Richard Wagner's Bayreuth." Craig's optical approach to set design closely corresponds to his activity as an experimen tal printmaker. In the 1890s, he exhibited prints alongside painters and printmakers Lucien Pissarro and the Nabis.38 Parallel to his work as a director after 1900, Craig produced highly evocative drawings and prints of stage scenery, in which rays of light partially transmuted actors, stage sets, and architecture into dynamic alternations of light and shadow (Fig. 14).

Bibliotheque Nationale de France, Paris (artwork in the public domain; photograph by Erich Lessing, provided by Art Resource, NY) "The true &amp; sole Material for the Art of the T [heater is] light—&amp; through light movement," wrote Craig, who took advantage of new technical advances in electric lighting and stage design pioneered by Fuller to craft a fully mobile stage architecture in which light served as the primary mode of expression.39 Through conversations with Craig, van de Velde sought to realize their shared painterly principles in his stage designs and architecture. He worked with Craig in 1904 on plans for a theater building for actress and director Louise Dumont, in which van de Velde first proposed the use of a tripartite stage. When Weimar's Grand Duke rejected the Dumont Theater, van de Velde sought to realize his ideas at the Theatre des Champs-Elysees in 1910 in Paris. There he collaborated with Nabi painters Maurice Denis and Edouard Vuillard, but ultimately was forced to adapt his ideas to the more conservative taste of Gabriel Thomas, the owner of the Theatre des Champs-Elysees. The Paris theater project was further hampered by van de Velde's reliance on the technical expertise of Auguste Perret regarding the use of reinforced concrete. Perret stole the contract from van de Velde after the latter had provided the necessary designs. Van de Velde turned to the Werkbund Theater commission in 1913 as the site where he could at last realize his and Craig's shared cosmopolitan and essentially abstract aesthetic.40 In an at tempt to avoid the time delays and technical complications 14 Edward Gordon Craig, Design of a Stage Scene for Hamlet, 1910, pen and wash drawing, 12 X 9¥s in.

Victoria and Albert Museum, London (artwork and photograph © Victoria and Albert Museum, London) that had doomed his work in Paris, van de Velde lent His theater building a simple metal frame with brick infill and dressed it with stucco facing. The Werkbund Theater's architectural and technological innovations lie less in its structural frame and more in its stage construction. Drawing on his earlier designs for the Dumont Theater, van de Velde sought to shape an all-encom passing and fluid visual experience in Cologne by employing a tripartite stage, which provides the terms for understanding the building's architecture (Fig. 15) 1 By suspending the stage proscenium from above, he dispensed with side-framing elements that had previously restricted space onstage and separated it from the auditorium. Removable partitions could be used to divide the stage into three sections. Individ ual sections could be opened while others remained closed, facilitating faster scene changes. The stage could also be used without partitions to offer an unprecedented opening (Fig. 16). Measuring nearly fifty-six feet (seventeen meters) across, the stage exceeded by one and a half feet (half a meter) even the width of the auditorium, so that its edges needed to be angled in slightly toward the audience. With a floating pro scenium and wraparound sides, the stage constituted a strik ingly broad and all-encompassing visual expanse. Light towers positioned above and in front of the proscenium projected colored lights onto the nearly forty-three-foot- (thirteen-meter-) deep, semicircular stage, where they intermingled with col ored lights projected from the back of the stage.

Critics com mented that the stage seemed to spread out into infinity. Van de Velde obtained mobile light effects through the use of a "cloud machine," which consisted of clouds painted on a filmstrip that rotated inside an illuminated cylinder. Influ enced by early cinema technology associated with Fuller's dance performances, van de Velde's cloud machine enliv ened the stage with moving pictures in ways that anticipated 1920s avant-garde cinematic experiments.42 Although van de Velde was not the only architect to em ploy colored, mobile lighting around 1910, his application of it stands out for its relation to French painterly aesthetics and avant-garde cinema. Important precedents for his use of electric lighting can be found in Fuchs's productions for the Munich Artists' Theater (1908) and Jacques Dalcroze's rhyth mic gymnastics performed in Tessenow's Festspielhaus at Hellerau. Inspired by Swiss theater reformer and director Adolphe Appia, Fuchs and Dalcroze utilized mobile, colored lighting and simplified stage architecture in order to empha</page><page sequence="11">HENRY VAN DE VELDE'S 1914 WERKBUND THEATER 261 17 Van de Velde, Study of Stage Scenery for "Faust, Part I, " Walpurgis Night, 1914.

Fuchs, following Behrens, employed a shallow stage on which actors appeared relieflike on a single plane, whereas Dalcroze created a deeper space through which actors moved in ordered sequences. However, in both cases, geometric structures remained ever present, and light emphasized the physicality of actors' bodies in movement.43 By contrast, Craig and van de Velde partially dematerialized the body into fluid, optical effects. At the Werkbund Theater, van de Velde constructed a deep stage with a semicircular back wall, and he used light to dissolve actors, stage scenery, and architecture into abstract plays of light and shadow in ways that relate to Craig's ethereal sce nography and Fuller's weightless performances. Closely asso ciated with French Symbolist theater and painting, Craig's and Fuller's work underlines the painterly and international character of van de Velde's architecture and stage designs. Reconstructing the Werkbund Theater's stage designs is a complex task, as van de Velde had to collaborate with direc tors who did not always share his ideas. He had hoped to work with either Craig or Max Reinhardt, but when these collab orations fell through (in part because of financial limita tions) van de Velde had to accept directors selected by the Werkbund Theater Committee.44 Victor Barnowsky from Ber lin's Lessing Theater directed the opening production of Faust, Part I. Going against Barnowsky's naturalist inclina tions, van de Velde proposed abstract set designs in studies that he made for Faust and displayed in a section of the Werkbund Exhibition devoted to theater art. He succeeded in realizing elements of his abstract aesthetic onstage, both in Faust and in subsequent productions after Barnowsky's de parture. These successful moments, documented in photo graphs, studies, and critical reactions, lend important insights into van de Velde's approach to set design and architecture.45 Photographs of the Werkbund Theater's productions as well as van de Velde's drawings of scenery suggest that he emphasized light and movement as the primary means of expression. A photograph of a stage set for the inaugural production of Goethe's Faust reveals a simple mountainside (Fig. 16). Backlight flattens and simplifies the mountain, transforming it into a shadowlike apparition. Another moun tain begins on the right edge of the stage, implying that the scene continues beyond the edge of vision. Instead of fram ing the scene, the proscenium at the Werkbund Theater seems to become transformed into bands of light and shadow that blend in with those of the stage scenery. The floating proscenium casts a shadow over the upper portion of the sky, echoing the dark diagonals of the mountainside. Parted cur tains on left and right merge with the mountain's dark slopes, and the semicircular stage appears as an unlimited glowing expanse. Critics at the time marveled at the scene's expressive lighting effects in which the mountains appeared blue, the fields red.41' By partially dissolving scenery and actors through electric lighting, van de Velde erased all physical barriers between stage and auditorium, making viewers feel as if they inhabited the ethereal mountain scenery. Alongside photographs and published criticism, studies that van de Velde painted for the opening production of Faust lend insights into his theatrical aesthetic.47 In a scene he designed for Walpurgis Night, he evoked dramatic events through tonal contrasts and overlapping waves of constantly modulating color (Fig. 17). While elements of rock, sky, and water can be made out, the source of the wavelike atmo spheric effects remains ambiguous. Instead of representing observed meteorological effects, van de Velde's streaks of blue, white, and green call up brooding emotions through more abstract means. Critic Ernst Hardt, an ally of van de Velde who in 1918 would direct Weimar's National Theater, found the light effects on the Werkbund Theater's stage truly magical in their ever-changing aspect: "sinking sunshine, a vanquished day in crepuscular violet hues, ghostly fog clouds careening in a silvery sunset toward a blue incandescent night that remains unforgettable to all those who have seen it."48</page><page sequence="12">262 art bulletin june 2012 volume xciv number 2 18 Van de Velde, Werkbund Theater auditorium, central light fixture and wooden tracery (artwork © 2012 Artists Rights Society [ARS], New York/SABAM, Brussels; photograph © Fonds van de Velde, ENSAV-La Cambre, Brussels) Abstract, expressive light effects characterized not only the Werkbund Theater's stage but also its auditorium and foyers. A central light fixture on the auditorium ceiling consisted of lightbulbs under strawberry-colored drapery (Fig. 18). Col ored cloth functioned analogously to the colored filters used in stage lighting, bathing the room in a warm, diffuse light. Artificial light mingled with natural light filtering in through tracery cut into the auditorium's dark wooden wall paneling, producing a quasi-mystical atmosphere with its "inner glow," as critic Behne enthusiastically described it.49 In the foyers, light took on a less poetic and more boldly declarative char acter, greeting guests and leading them into the auditorium interior. A friezelike display of lightbulbs in the entrance foyers established light as a major feature of theater architec ture (Fig. 19). Whether mysterious or energetic, light in the Werkbund Theater appeared unabashedly artificial. Abstract light effects also marked the building's exterior, whose smooth surfaces avoided overt or explicit references to history or nature (Fig. 1). Van de Velde obtained sleek sur faces by employing cost-effective and unadorned stucco fac ing, which called attention to the building's rational massing. He determined rooflines of his building according to the different ceiling heights of its vestibule, auditorium, stage house, side foyers, coatrooms, and administrative offices. Op tical as well as functional considerations determined his dis 19 Van de Velde, Werkbund Theater, entrance foyer with decorative lightbulb frieze (artwork © 2012 Artists Rights Society [ARS], New York/SABAM, Brussels; photograph © Fonds van de Velde, ENSAV-La Cambre, Brussels) tribution of architectural volume. Whereas the building fa cade's eyelike windows and doors are recessed, the top of its portal projects forward, and the resulting interplay of dark and light lends the building a sense of dynamic movement in ways that recall his stage scenery (Fig. 6). The portal's broad horizontal expanse punctuated by vertical columns approxi mates the stage's format and dimensions; the portal's over hang doubles as a floating proscenium that casts slanting shadows out toward the audience. The entire facade could even be understood as a stage across which light flickers in quasi-cinematic brilliance. Paintings and sculptures by von Hofmann, Kolbe, Steger, and Brentano reinforced van de Velde's optical emphasis in his architecture.50 Symmetrical, arching water jets in Kolbe's Bather fountain constituted sight lines that framed the build ing's protruding entrance and echoed its dynamic curves (Fig. 1). The smooth, simple surfaces of Kolbe's Bather broke sunlight into opposing bands of light and shadow; its reflec tion in the water basin contributed to its sleek, dematerial ized appearance. With its reduced pedestal, the stretching figure appeared almost suspended in midair as an ocular apparition. In the building interior, Hofmann's friezes dis played a similarly optical character. Narrative and formal complexity give way to elemental rhythms of line and color that run continuously between panels (Fig. 20). Hofmann employed a starkly reduced palette of white, blue, and black paint to generate dynamic oppositions of light and shadow. He simplified and flattened human and landscape elements, which appear decidedly artificial (Fig. 21). Van de Velde yoked the cultivation of opticahty to demo cratic ideals and international principles, envisioning theater as a potentially all-inclusive social ritual. He had intended a much larger building for Cologne, but because of budget restrictions imposed on him by the Werkbund Theater Com mittee, he reduced its seating to about six hundred. Designs that he produced in 1912 for a monument to Friedrich Nietzsche more fully reflect his desire to make theater archi tecture and performance accessible to a broad public.

Not only the building's aesthetic but also the productions staged within it exemplified van de Velde's international ideals. The Werkbund Theater opened with a production of Goethe's Faust that established its Germanic credentials, but this production was quickly followed by a performance of the Belgian poet Emile Verhaeren's play The Cloister in the orig inal French. Stefan Zweig had published a respected German translation of The Cloister in 1910, and Verhaeren enjoyed a strong German following. By rejecting Zweig's translation in favor of the French original, van de Velde paid tribute to the Francophone Verhaeren and their shared internationalist principles. The French-language production of Verhaeren's play explicitly challenged the German Werkbund's national ist emphasis, a challenging position to take on the eve of World War I.52 Van de Velde's internationalism earned him the sympathy of Konrad Adenauer, who as a Cologne city official served on the exhibition committee. Van de Velde's international and individualist aesthetics posed a threat to Werkbund members seeking to orient the organization around nationalist principles and partnerships with big business. In order to get his building constructed in the face of Muthesius and Jackh's opposition, van de Velde needed allies within the Werkbund who shared his belief in the Gesamtkunstwerk and individualistic principles. He found these collaborators in Osthaus and Obrist, even though their contributions to the building contradicted some of his main tenets. Taken together, these tactical collaborations repre sent an important aspect of the building and its relation to broader debates within the Werkbund. 21 Von Hofmann, detail of mural in the Werkbund Theater's side foyer, German Werkbund Exhibition, 1914 (artwork ©2012 Artists Rights Society [ARS], NewYork/VG Bild-Kunst, Bonn; photograph © Bildarchiv Foto Marburg) Osthaus: Theater, Commodity, and Nation In planning and seeking approval for his theater building, van de Velde drew on the support of Karl Ernst Osthaus, an important and influential figure within the Werkbund, who served as the building's most effective publicist and pro moter. Owner of two museums in nearby Hagen, Osthaus enjoyed close contacts with prominent and influential Co logne journalists and residents. His connections among the press and art patrons were matched by his influence in the Werkbund. Osthaus belonged to the organization's Executive and Theater Committees and played an active role in the exhibition's planning in 1913 and 1914. He organized a display of art and design objects from his native Hagen, took charge of the entire exhibition's advertising campaign, and sought to introduce advanced aesthetic principles into the Commercial Street, a display of model shopwindows. Osthaus also lobbied in favor of aesthetically innovative exhibition</page><page sequence="14">264 art bulletin june 2012 volume xciv number 2 buildings opposed by Muthesius, including Taut's Glass House, Gropius and Meyer's Model Factory, and van de Velde's Werkbund Theater.53 In supporting van de Velde at the Werkbund Exhibition, Osthaus continued a pattern of patronage that he had initi ated in 1900. He became van de Velde's most generous and influential patron when he commissioned the artist to design the interior of his newly constructed and deeply innovative Folkwang Museum in Hagen in 1900.54 From this date on, van de Velde unofficially advised Osthaus on his purchases of Impressionist and Postimpressionist painting for his mu seum, making use of the Belgian's numerous contacts in Paris.55 In 1906, Osthaus commissioned van de Velde to design his private residence, Hohenhof. Starting in 1909, he also featured the artist's advertising displays and product packaging at his newly opened German Museum for Art in Trade and Industry in Hagen. These numerous commissions provide the context for understanding Osthaus's support of van de Velde and his theater building at Cologne.56 Osthaus played an active role in the Werkbund Theater, coordinating the contributions of artists and performers and lobbying on its behalf. His clearest and most influential ac count of the theater building and its significance consists of an article, "The Werkbund Idea," that he published in the Frankfurter Zeitung at the opening of the 1914 Werkbund Congress. In this and another article published in 1913, Osthaus made the most explicit case for innovative theater architecture's economic significance, connecting the theater building and its visually stunning stage designs to the artificial and alluring spectacle of artfully designed shopwindows. In the years leading up to World War I, Osthaus sought to extend formal principles associated with Craig's and van de Velde's theater designs into the everyday modern urban en vironment in order to forge new, dynamic, and essentially modern bonds of collectivity and consensus. Osthaus's argu ments matter because they supply the strongest justification for the theater building's presence at a German Werkbund exhibition. Yet rather than simply defend van de Velde's formal and political principles, Osthaus harnessed the the ater building to serve his own cultural and political agenda. Specifically, he yoked the Werkbund Theater to a pan-Ger manic ideology that van de Velde rejected. Osthaus and van de Velde agreed that theater architecture lay at the heart of Werkbund objectives, but they defined "theater" and "nation" in strikingly different ways that have gone unacknowledged. Even before he published his 1914 article, Osthaus placed aesthetic innovation at the center of Werkbund policy and national identity. Far from impractical or Utopian, he be lieved that dynamic design and artful advertising would en hance the appeal of German goods at home and abroad. He commissioned advertisements by leading artists and pub lished essays on shopwindows and urban planning as well as on painting. Through his writings and art patronage, Osthaus sought to demonstrate how aesthetic principles could be applied to everyday life in order to disseminate beauty and good taste that would ultimately benefit the German nation. France served as an example of how the highest aesthetic standards could lead a country to dominate European and American applied arts production. Adopting a nationalist position that was nevertheless open to foreign influences, Osthaus supported the work of advanced painters and de signers, including that of van de Velde, Behrens, Richard Riemerschmid, Ferdinand Hodler, Paul Cezanne, and Henri Matisse. Osthaus explicitly yoked theater architecture to Werkbund goals in "The Werkbund Idea." By referring to a singular idea rather than the conflicts then threatening the organization, he sought to recover some sense of original purpose. In the same spirit, he also overlooked van de Velde's and Obrist's differences, emphasizing instead what drew them together: "the tendency to endow line with new, emotional content."57 Despite his pretension to speak for the Werkbund as a whole, Osthaus's emphasis on aesthetics revealed his attachment to the "individualist" camp. Much of the article repeated arguments that van de Velde and Obrist made in their "Coun ter-Theses." Osthaus claimed that individual genius, not com mercial calculation, sparks artistic innovation. A preoccupa tion with export markets alone cannot elevate the quality of German products; this will come only from inspired artists, who lend the latest technologies and materials new, seductive form. Osthaus wanted to wrest Werkbund policies away from Muthesius's materialist and mercantile focus, insisting in stead on the importance of aesthetics. He dismissed an ex clusive preoccupation with building materials and function as crass materialism and announced the triumph of ideas over mundane, practical considerations. A purely pragmatic and functionalist approach to design, he argued, overlooks art's higher, spiritual dimension. The goal of the Werkbund from its outset, Osthaus insisted, was not to dethrone art in favor of industry, but to endow industrial production with a higher purpose. In this article, Osthaus attempted to legitimate the Werk bund Theater and the "individualist" position it represented by connecting its architecture and theater productions to German idealist traditions. He adhered to Arthur Schopen hauer's Romantic understanding of artistic creation as springing from individual intuition. Alongside passages from Schopenhauer, Osthaus quoted Schiller's "Letters on Aes thetic Education," in which Schiller identified material need as a false God, which distracts people from the true cause of aesthetic freedom. Following Schiller, Osthaus elevated art as "a daughter of freedom" that rises above the "century's bois terous market."58 Beauty never springs from material calcu lations, Osthaus claimed, associating the "Werkbund idea" with the reawakening of ethical and aesthetic sensibilities. In yoking van de Velde's Dionysian architecture to Schiller's aesthetic education, Osthaus sought to validate the Werk bund theater as generative for the new nation. The building's opening production of Faust reinforced Osthaus's argument that van de Velde's building breathed new life into German cultural traditions. Osthaus participated in a variety of theater reform initia tives around 1910, but evidence suggests that he most fully identified with van de Velde's and Craig's designs. In the summer of 1909 he gathered a troupe of actors to perform modern dramas on a stage built by Behrens in Hagen. He also hosted literature readings by Heinrich Mann and Theo dore Daubler and dance performances by Isadora Duncan and Alexander Sacharoff in Hagen.59 In these performances, artists replaced naturalism with abstract, rhythmic combina</page><page sequence="15">HENRY VAN DE VELDE'S 1914 WERKBUND THEATER 265 22 Behrens, Stage set for a production of Otto Erich Hartleben's Diogenes, Hagen, 1909 (artwork in the public domain; photograph from Kunstgewerbeblatt, n.s., 22 [1910]: 43) tions of line and color. Osthaus expanded on his overwhelm ingly visual approach to the stage in his 1909 essay "The Art of the Stage." Rhythm, he argued, should supplant descrip tion as the primary means of communication. He identified actors' stylized, simplified movements and mobile, colored lights as the primary sources of rhythm. Elements of pulsating movement can be seen in a photograph of Otto Erich Hartle bens's Diogenes staged by Behrens (Fig. 22), in which actors in simplified drapery move in a shallow stage bordered by re peated columns. While he admired Behrens, Osthaus re served his highest praise for Craig's expansive light effects, obtained by projecting mobile, colored light against a cloth ground. He marveled at how light turned actors' bodies into purely optical effects, lending them a mystical presence. Such ideas, which clash with Behrens's use of a shallow relief stage and emphasis on actors' corporeal movements in Diogenes, signal greater affinities with Craig's and van de Velde's opti cal aesthetics.60 Osthaus also revealed his engagement with van de Velde's and Craig's architecture and stage designs in his 1913 essay "The Shopwindow," in which he sought to apply their artifi cial and optical principles to commodity display. Following the ancient Greeks, Wagner, and Nietzsche, Osthaus envi sioned theater as a community-forming ritual and proposed to extend its influence into the common culture. Yet rather than repeating past experiments, Osthaus formulated a new approach to stage design grounded in van de Velde's and Craig's technological and aesthetic innovations. Artificial lighting and brilliant color, Osthaus reasoned, could endow the modern city with a source of beauty that would mesmer ize and unite its citizens. He discarded principles of narrative and illusionism in order to isolate harmonious arrangements of line, light, and color as sources of spiritual redemption. By importing the aesthetics of avant-garde theater into shopwin dows, Osthaus opposed a competing approach promoted by Muthesius and his allies, who advocated an objective and rational approach to commodity display. By contrast, Osthaus put forward a theatrical and spiritual understanding of shop windows, exemplified in August Endell's display for the Sal amander Shoe Store in Berlin (Fig. 23). Osthaus particularly admired how Endell made commodities the basis of abstract interplays of light and color that awaken viewers' imagina 23 August Endell, Salamander shopwindow, Berlin, 1913 (artwork in the public domain; photograph © Bildarchiv Foto Marburg) tions; colored stained-glass windows positioned at the top of Endell's glowing shopwindows double as stage curtains. Far from existing outside the viewer, artfully designed shopwin dows, according to Osthaus, take hold of the beholder's consciousness as dream images. Just as in van de Velde's and Craig s designs for theater architecture and stage decor, Osthaus proposed animating objects through overhead lights and colored glass. He envi sioned how "[t] winkling surfaces of deeply colored glass en close the illuminated display cases against the street. Light," Osthaus continued, "ripples over the enclosed objects from above. Glistening trademarks are transformed into magical signs with fervent contours."61 Revising critiques of the mar ketplace as a site of unavoidable alienation, Osthaus envi sioned how artists could transform shopwindows into theat rical stages that entrance viewers and compel their active engagement. "The entire display," he mused, "breathes that atmosphere that every child experiences before a theater curtain that will for the first time usher him into a world of dreams."62 Far from merely solipsistic or subjectivist, these</page><page sequence="16">266 ART BULLETIN JUNE 2012 VOLUME XCIV NUMBER 2 dream images function in Osthaus's schema as essential com ponents of aesthetic education. He attributed to window displays the same pedagogical role as theater architecture and set designs in shaping the minds and sensibilities of a generation: "The shop owner thereby becomes an educator of the people, or even an agent, on whom depends the fate of taste in the widest cultural circles."63 Osthaus sought to real ize theater architecture's pedagogical potential at the Werk bund exhibition by supporting van de Velde's building and also by attempting to secure artful designs for a display of model shopwindows.64 In "The Werkbund Idea," Osthaus offered a powerful de fense of the Werkbund Theater and its centrality to Werk bund objectives, but he yoked the theater building to his own militant nationalist ideology, which clashed with van de Vel de's internationalist politics. In his earlier articles and essays, Osthaus reasoned that Germany was to grow in power and influence, not only by engaging with European-wide devel opments but also by uniting all Germanic peoples in an expanded German nation. Thus, for Osthaus, "Henry" be comes "Heinrich" in his 1903 essay on the artist.65 In such articles as "Strasbourg" (1896), "The Ghent Universal Exhi bition" (1913), "To Henry van de Velde" (1914), and "Ger many and Belgium in Twentieth-Century Art" (1918), Ost haus displayed his pan-Germanic ideology by claiming Strasbourg and Flanders as rightfully German. He enlarged on his militant and expansionist nationalism in his 1914 defense of the theater building, in which he associated the triumph of the "Werkbund Idea" with strategically important battles in the Franco-Prussian War, Gravelote and Mars-la Tour.66 Through a series of deft military metaphors, Osthaus equated the triumph of the Werkbund idea with Germany's military and political hegemony in Europe. Although Osthaus considered that van de Velde's Flemish origins qualified him as German, most Germans did not share this viewpoint before World War I. Van de Velde's very halting command of the German language as well as his ardent and overt internationalism posed a significant barrier to his German integration; his political status in Germany only worsened with the approach of World War I. Help was needed in order to present the Werkbund Theater as authen tically German in a tense geopolitical moment, as well as to connect the theater to the key episodes in the German ap plied arts movement. Osthaus found the necessary help in Obrist, whose work allowed him to insert the theater building into the Werkbund's nationalist historical narrative. Obrist's Tactile Gesamtkunstwerk Evidence suggests that Osthaus rather than van de Velde proposed Obrist as a contributor to the Werkbund Theater. In 1913, van de Velde did not mention Obrist when he presented the Theater Committee with a list of contributing artists.1'7 Furthermore, Obrist and van de Velde had been rivals in the applied arts movement about 1900, and in 1912 van de Velde published an article on Obrist's fountain (Fig. 3), in which he criticized its squat appearance.68 Osthaus alone in his 1914 article sheds light on the motives behind the belated decision to incorporate Obrist's sculptures into van de Velde's theater building. Of all the artists who con tributed to the Werkbund Theater, only Obrist received men tion by Osthaus, who connected Obrist's sculptures to the Werkbund's founding objectives. The importance Osthaus accorded Obrist is surprising, because he had virtually ignored Obrist prior to the 1914 exhibition. Whereas Osthaus had supported van de Velde since 1900, he had never mentioned Obrist in his numerous essays or speeches regarding the German applied arts move ment before World War I, nor had he featured Obrist's work in any of the many prewar events that he had organized at his two museums in Hagen.69 In his speeches, essays, and exhi bitions before 1914, Osthaus had favored not only van de Velde but also Behrens, who designed a crematorium in Hagen (1905-7), the Folkwang Museum's auditorium (1906), villas in Hohenhagen (1908), Osthaus's planned artists' com munity, as well as a 1908 production of Diogenes in Hagen. Osthaus's motivation in incorporating Obrist's sculptures into the theater building appears to have been political rather than artistic: in 1914, Osthaus needed Obrist in order to legitimate the Werkbund Theater and the "individualist" position it represented within the context of the German applied arts movement. Obrist's works strengthened Ost haus's case for the Werkbund Theater in three ways. As we have seen, Obrist resisted Muthesius's and Jackh's efforts in 1913 and 1914 to prioritize large industries over artists; Ob rist's contributions to the theater building therefore helped Osthaus to build a strong coalition of "individualists." Obrist's position can be contrasted to that of Behrens, whose work Osthaus otherwise admired. As opposed to Obrist, Behrens remained neutral in the Werkbund debate, and his disci plined neoclassical architecture at the exhibition presented affinities with the conservative exhibition plan developed by Muthesius, Jackh, and Rehorst.70 Second, Obrist's sculptures reinforced Osthaus's claim that theater architecture lay at the heart of the Werkbund's founding objectives. Obrist played an important role in the Werkbund's historical narrative as an initiator of Munich's applied arts movement and as a founding Werkbund mem ber. In 1897 he co-founded Munich's United Workshops; in 1902 he served as principal instructor at the Obrist-Debschitz School in Munich, where he developed an innovative peda gogy that transcended distinctions between fine and applied arts as well as between applied arts media.71 At the same time, Obrist participated in Munich's theatrical revolution, staging impromptu performances of Henrik Ibsen's plays with the ater director Hans von Wolzogen and associating with Endell and Riemerschmid, who designed important theater building interiors around 1900. Indeed, Obrist praised Riemer schmid's Munich Schauspielhaus interior as the most signif icant example of modern architecture in 1900.72 In 1907, Obrist joined Muthesius, van de Velde, and Osthaus in found ing the German Werkbund, but his involvement waned after his initial enthusiasm. He is reported to have resigned his membership in the Werkbund in 1908 or 1909, but he resur faced at its 1914 exhibition, at the theater building as well as at the exhibition section devoted to the Werkbund's twelve founding artists.73 The stated purpose of the "Twelve Apos tles" exhibit was to present "for the first time an evolutionary history of the new German applied art."74 The theater build ing contributed to this historical narrative. Two of the four sculptures that Obrist exhibited had been created in Munich</page><page sequence="17">HENRY VAN DE VELDE'S 1914 WERKBUND THEATER 267 about 1900 and were transported to Cologne for the pur poses of the exhibition. Obrist's sculptures, therefore, lent visual credence to Osthaus's attempt to connect the Werk bund Theater to the early German applied arts movement. Third, Obrist strengthened Osthaus's case for the Werk bund Theater because his sculptures exemplified a national ist idiom that Obrist had formulated in essays and speeches around 1900. Obrist's nationalist credentials helped Osthaus make a case for van de Velde's international architecture at the German Werkbund exhibit. In his essay "New Possibilities in the Visual Arts" (1900), Obrist defined the Gesamtkunstwerk as intimately associated with German music. Reinforcing a nineteenth-century chauvinist German discourse on art, he distinguished the alleged superficiality of French Impression ism from what he characterized as the totalizing impulses of German art. While French artists contented themselves with "fleeting" optical impressions, German artists, according to Obrist, cultivated deep, mystical states of psychological inte riority obtained through the interworkings of all the senses.75 Following Nietzsche in The Birth of Tragedy, Obrist conceived of art as the product of bold and especially gifted individuals who embody the national spirit. Seeking to counteract dem ocratic tendencies in art, he underlined the difference be tween "folk" and "popular" art in his essay "Functional or Imaginative?" (1901). "Folk" art, he insisted, might be unpop ular in the short term, but will eventually gain recognition from and benefit the people. He cited as examples the ini tially controversial music of Wagner and Ludwig van Beethoven, which ultimately came to symbolize German in genuity and greatness. The goal of artists should not be popular acclaim, he urged, but to forcefully and imagina tively express the defining characteristics of a nation./b Fur thermore, in his 1907 lecture "German and Un-German Art," Obrist saw in the applied arts the best possibility for develop ing "an independent German formal language."77 In his Werkbund Theater sculptures, as in his speeches and pub lished essays, Obrist redefined sculptural monumentality, in voking ideas of nationhood through an intuitive and musical formal vocabulary. However, although Obrist's contributions may have helped van de Velde's theater get constructed, they contradicted his painterly and primarily optical approach to form on three levels. Opposed to van de Velde's overwhelmingly visual ap proach to stage design and architecture, Obrist's sculptures simultaneously addressed the senses of touch, vision, and hearing. His fountain, for instance, presented the viewer with a variety of tactile surfaces, including wavelike volutes, cren ellated edges, and fossil-like encrustations. Obrist placed these varied and dynamic surfaces within arm's reach, omit ting a base so as to increase physical intimacy between sculp ture and audience. Light and shadow played over the foun tain's convex and concave surfaces, creating a series of dynamic, irregular optical patterns. In the carefully staged photograph of the work that was most likely taken under Obrist's supervision (Fig. 3), he produced dramatic tonal contrasts by illuminating the work from the front and posi tioning it against a dark backdrop of trees and bushes. Dark ness even penetrates the sculpture's interior through the oval-shaped void at its center, which throws into relief its intricately carved central flourish. Obrist sculpted stone not 24 Obrist, Movement, detail. Kunstgewerbesammlung, Museum fur Gestaltung Zurich (artwork in the public domain; photograph by Heinrich Helfenstein © ZHdK) only to produce a diversity of tactile and optical sensations but also to direct the flow of water over stone in what he described as symphonic movements. Yet, disconnected from a water source, the fountain's aural potential remained latent to viewers at the Werkbund Exhibition. Second, whereas van de Velde s set designs and architec ture presented an abstract and artificial formal vocabulary, Obrist in his sculptures broke down boundaries between the arts and senses in order to imbue art with nature's vitality. The artist's task, as Obrist conceived it, was not to reproduce nature but to express pulsating, vital energies that course through all living organisms. "An unforeseen plenitude of possibilities," he explained in an essay from 1900, "arises before the eyes of he who has learned to see sculptural forms in nature, the compact power of buds, the curves and ribs of seeds." He urged artists to enlarge these microscopic forms into structures several feet high for all to see.'8 Artists re spond as much to tactile as to visual impressions, and he called on them to model their forms based on "all the forms of tactile sensation [Tastempfindung]," including impressions of "smoothness, roughness, hardness, softness, elasticity, ri gidity, pliancy, fullness and brittleness. . . ,"79 Obrist realized such strategies in Movement (Figs. 4, 24), in which he sug gested the various stages of a bud's evolution. Rather than depicting a bud illusionistically, he expressed its energies in the form of upward-spiraling rhythms that constitute the basis</page><page sequence="18">268 ART BULLETIN JUNE 2012 VOLUME XCIV NUMBER 2 25 Van de Velde, Werkbund Theater, view from the side garden with the top of Obrist's Movement and the Cologne Cathedral spires in the distance (artwork © 2012 Artists Rights Society [ARS], New York/ SABAM, Brussels; photograph © Bibliotheque Royale de Belgique, FSX 929.27.1) of his sculptural composition. He communicated nature's vitality not only through dynamic lines but also through the alternately smooth, jagged, and wavelike surfaces at Move ment's base from which the bud emerges. Third, whereas van de Velde's artificial and abstract idiom resulted in the purification of architectural form, Obrist blurred boundaries between sculpture and architecture and produced hybrid objects. He referred to himself in several letters as an "architectural sculptor." Indeed, all of Obrist's sculptures, which include fountains, tombstones, architec tural reliefs, jardinieres, and plant stands, have a potential architectural function.80 His sculptures for the Werkbund Theater prove no exception, evoking and sometimes merg ing with the forms of surrounding buildings. Movement's spi ral peak rhymed with the Cologne Cathedral's pointed towers located on the opposite bank of the Rhine River (Fig. 25). His fountain evoked an ogival Gothic arch, complete with fantas tic carved ornamentation. The hybridity of Obrist's works can be seen above all in his relief sculptures on the building's facade, which fused with, and even obstructed, van de Velde's architecture. The Werkbund Theater's relief sculptures might seem to present an exception to Obrist's tactile and synesthetic lan guage in their frontal and largely pictorial presentation of grape clusters (Fig. 6), but in other ways they remain faithful to his vitalistic language. Conceived explicitly, albeit belat edly, for van de Velde's building, Obrist's reliefs demonstrate the artist's attempt to integrate his works into the Werkbund Theater's Dionysian thematics. Tellingly, he restricted his reliefs' Dionysian vocabulary to plant imagery. Furthermore, while his grapes displayed a predominandy optical character, his leaves and vines presented an insistent tactility and mate riality. Jagged, irregular points protruding from the bottom of his reliefs disrupted the building's elemental massing and smooth, optical surfaces. In his 1914 article, Osthaus downplayed significant formal and ideological differences between van de Velde and Obrist in order to build a coalition of committed "individualists" and to insert the theater building into the Werkbund's national istic historical narrative. However, Osthaus in his article did more than reconcile their differences and defend the build ing against its critics; he yoked it to his militant and expan sionist nationalist ideology, which neither Obrist nor van de Velde shared. Osthaus's pan-Germanism sets him apart from Obrist's notion of a poetic and inward-turning Germany as well as from van de Velde's internationalist and pacifist com mitments. The question remains: Given their significant ideological and aesthetic differences, what brought van de Velde, Obrist, and Osthaus together? Obrist and van de Velde overlooked these divergences, I believe, in order to get the theater build ing constructed. Van de Velde had designed, but failed to realize, theater buildings for Weimar in 1904 and Paris in 1910. These disappointments made him seek out powerful allies and advocates in Cologne who could help him realize his theater project. Additionally, Osthaus's inflated sense of Germanness helped compensate for van de Velde's foreigner status at a particularly vulnerable moment. The Werkbund</page><page sequence="19">Congress coincided with van de Velde's forced resignation from his position in Weimar because of his Belgian citizen ship.81 For his part, Obrist overcame his differences with van de Velde and Osthaus at a time when many of his earlier collaborators in Munich, especially Riemerschmid, embraced Muthesius's program, sacrificing formal experimentation to the imperatives of export markets and mass production. Health and financial problems had led Obrist to almost cease exhibiting his works and to resign from the school that he had co-founded with Wilhelm Debschitz. He therefore needed the public attention and potential commissions that the Werkbund Theater brought him. Beyond self-interest and calculation, however, van de Velde, Obrist, and Osthaus came together out of the conviction that Muthesius and his camp had violated the Werkbund's founding principles. Their goal was to show how theater architecture and artistic experimentation mattered just as much as export markets to Germany's economy and international reputation. Yet collab oration does not mean consensus, and more than anything else, the building displays the different and competing no tions of architectural art and nation that characterized the "individualist" faction. Differences between Osthaus and van de Velde deepened during World War I, which cut short the Werkbund Exhibi tion. The outbreak of the war led Osthaus to articulate with renewed vigor the racist nationalist ideology that he had espoused in the 1890s. Four months into the war, he pub lished an open letter to van de Velde in the Frankfurter Zeitung that made it impossible for the artist to return to Belgium. As a Belgian national who would become an "enemy combatant" in Germany at the outbreak of war, van de Velde endured hostile treatment from Weimar's court, press, and local pop ulation as he sought to protect his Grand Ducal School of Applied Arts, which remained open during the war. Osthaus defended van de Velde in his open letter, referring to him as a friend. However, he hurt more than helped his friend by referring to him as a member of the Germanic race and defending German aggression in Belgium.82 Van de Velde's contacts with Osthaus, combined with his history of employ ment at the Weimar court, led the Belgian government to refuse his right to return. Even though he desperately needed employment following his forced departure from Weimar, van de Velde refused Osthaus's offer of wartime residency in Hagen and took refuge in neutral Switzerland.83 Although the Werkbund Theater fell into disrepair during the war and was torn down in 1920, it continued to influence architectural modernism after World War I. Indeed, some of the Werkbund Theater's most eloquent defenders, including Behne, Hardt, and Gropius, would go on to assume impor tant cultural positions after the war. Despite ongoing differ ences, van de Velde recommended three Werkbund "individ ualists" in 1914 to succeed him as director of Weimar's Grand Ducal School of Applied Arts: Endell, Obrist, and Gropius. In the end, Werkbund "individualists" shaped the early history of the Bauhaus in ways that are only now beginning to be appreciated.84 Gropius opened the Bauhaus in 1919 in school buildings that van de Velde designed and that had housed the School of Applied Arts that van de Velde had founded and directed. In 1921, Gropius obtained a commis sion to renovate the Jena Theater through Hardt, director of HENRY VAN DE VELDE'S 1914 WERKBUND THEATER 269 Weimar's National Theater and passionate defender of van de Velde's theater building.811 Despite his clear debt to van de Velde, Gropius in his International Architecture acknowledged the Werkbund Theater only insofar as it served his own objectives. In reproducing simply an exterior view of the Werkbund Theater, Gropius ignored its innovative audito rium and stage scenery as well as its painted and sculpted accompaniments. Instead, he sought to claim the theater building for his own purposes, positioning it as a predecessor of Bauhaus experiments and seeking to put behind him the tensions and controversies that characterized German mod ernism before World War I. Significantly, Gropius omitted any mention of Obrist, whose work fell outside his formal and political interests. A more inclusive reconstruction of the building allows us to measure the full range of its ambition in relation to matters of "individualism" and Werkbund policy. Rather than simply pointing the way forward, the Werkbund Theater presented viewers with a series of contradictions and tensions. The building undoubtedly offered a strong version of cultural renewal in Germany, evoking Nietzsche, Wagner, Goethe, and Schiller, underlining their relevance to the twentieth century. And yet the theater building teetered between opti cality and tactility, inclusivity and elitism, internationalism and the "German spirit." Reconstructing a more complete picture of the Werkbund Theater reveals the complex and fraught nature of "individualist" arguments within the Werk bund. Taken together, the building's architecture, sculpture, and stage designs demonstrate the unresolved nature of the Gesamtkunstwerk and its significance to both the German Werkbund and the shaping of German modernism.

Van de Velde welcomed Kolbe's contribution, which consolidated his in creasingly close ties to the artist. In 1912, he had commissioned a mar ble figure for a fountain from Kolbe. In 1913, Karl Ernst Osthaus com missioned a bust of van de Velde from Kolbe, which he presented to van de Velde on his fiftieth birthday.

Dagmar Rinker cites both sources in Der Munchner Jugendstilkunstler Hermann Obrist (1862-1927) (Munich: Tuduv, 2001), 247. 4. Obrist's fountain has been lost; it can be studied only with the help of the 1912 photograph. Movement exists today only in the form of a plas ter model, whose dimensions are significantiy smaller than those of the original. I thank Eva Afuhs of the Museum fur Gestaltung in Zurich for clarifying the status of the plaster cast in relation to the lost, original sculpture. 5. To my knowledge, no drawings or plans exist of Obrist's sculptures in relation to the theater building. I have also found no written corre spondence between the two artists, nor between them and Osthaus re lated to Obrist's contributions to the theater building. Ingo Starz con firms this lack of documentation related to van de Velde's and Obrist's collaboration in his "Ornamental-Plastik: Hermann Obrist und Henry van de Velde im Dialog," in Hermann Obrist: Skulptur, Raum, Abstraktion um 1900, ed. Eva Afuhs and Andreas Strobl (Zurich: Museum Bellerive; Munich: Staatlichen Graphische Sammlung Munchen, 2009), 148-75. Dennis Sharp makes no mention of Obrist's contributions to the the ater building in his otherwise thorough and informative publication of van de Velde's drawings, photographs, and models related to the Werk bund Theater, Henry van de Velde: Theatre Designs, 1904-1914 (London: Architectural Association, 1974). The photograph of the theater build ing's facade was published in the periodical Reclams Universum Weltrund schau on June 15, 1914, just before the theater's official opening on June 18. It shows the top of Obrist's fountain in the theater building's side garden, but Obrist's reliefs are entirely absent from the window openings. We do not know exacdy when the picture was taken, but it indicates that the relief sculptures were among the last elements to be added to the building, certainly after Obrist's freestanding sculptures. 6. The exhibit of the "Twelve Apostles" included contributions by Otto Eckmann, Joseph Maria Olbrich, van de Velde, Obrist, Bernhard Pan kok, August Endell, Peter Behrens, Richard Riemerschmid, Bruno Paul, Martin Dulfer, Josef Hoffmann, and Adelbert Niemeyer. Each of the artists was given a single room to decorate in which he presented his early contributions to the German applied arts movement as well as recent work. The exhibition catalog does not list works displayed by individual artists. See "Sonderausstellungen einzelner Werkkunstler," in Deutsche Ausstellung Coin 1914: Offizieller Katalog (Cologne: Rudolf Mosse, 1914), 35-36. 7. The following accounts of the Werkbund's founding, history, and 1914 exhibition have informed my thinking: Julius Posener, Anfange des Funktionalismus: Von Arts and Crafts zum Deutschen Werkbund (Berlin: Ull stein, 1964); Joan Campbell, The German Werkbund: The Politics of Reform in the Applied Arts (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1978); Anna Christa Funk, Karl Ernst Osthaus gegen Hermann Muthesius: Der Werkbund streit 1914 im Spiegel der im Karl Ernst Osthaus-Archiv erhaltenen Briefe (Ha gen: Karl Ernst Osthaus Museum, 1978); Wulf Herzogenrath, ed., Der westdeutsche Impuls 1900-1914: Kunst und Umweltgestaltung im Industriege biet.

Henry van de Velde, "Gegenthesen," in Muthesius, Die Werkbundarbeit der Zukunft, reprinted in Maciuika, Before the Bauhaus, 305-7. 10. Van de Velde referred to the Werkbund Theater as an "artistic experi mental stage [kunstlerische Versuchsbiihne]." See Washburn Freund, "Die Kolner Deutsche Werkbundausstellung," Schlesische Zeitung (Breslau), June 10, 1914. For a list of both planned and realized performances at the Werkbund Theater during its brief, six-week season, cut short due to construction delays and the outbreak of World War I, see Dirk Teu ber, "Henry van de Veldes Werkbund-Theater: Ein Denkmal fur Friedrich Nietzsche?" in Herzogenrath, Der westdeutsche Impuls, 129-30. As Teuber notes, van de Velde altered his theater's planned repertory because of construction delays and pressures imposed by the Werk bund Theater Committee. 11. Reyner Banham refers to the Werkbund Theater as "a spirited rear guard action by an outgoing type of designer" in Theory and Design in the First Machine Age, 2nd ed. (Cambridge, Mass.: MIT Press, 1981), 78. The following scholars join Banham in characterizing the Werkbund Theater as hopelessly Utopian and outmoded: Nikolaus Pevsner, "Pa tient Progress Three: The DIA," in Studies in Art, Architecture, and Design (London: Thames and Hudson, 1968), vol. 2, 231; Campbell, The Ger man Werkbund, 55; Kenneth Frampton, Modern Architecture: A Critical History (New York: Oxford University Press, 1980), 99; and Markjar zombek, "The Discourses of a Bourgeois Utopia, 1904-1908, and the Founding of the Werkbund," in Imagining Modern German Culture, 1889-1910, ed. Frangoise Forster-Hahn (Washington D.C.: National Gallery of Art, 1996), 133. Frederic Schwartz offers a useful summary of the Werkbund debate historiography in The Werkbund, 148-49. As Maciuika, Before the Bauhaus, 279-81, points out, the tendency to dis miss van de Velde's position as "merely" individualist originated in a press campaign against van de Velde orchestrated in 1914 by Muthe sius and Jackh in the Berliner Tageblatt. Overtly partisan, these articles cannot be taken as a fair or accurate representation of van de Velde's position, although their authority has gone virtually unchallenged. 12. Schwartz, The Werkbund, 164-77, offers an astute and helpful discussion of Osthaus as a Werkbund theorist, though he does not discuss van de Velde's work or his complex relationship with Osthaus at any length. 13. On Expressionist architecture, see Wolfgang Pehnt, Die Architektur des Expressionismus, 3rd ed. (Ostfildern: Gerd Haye, 1998).

Frampton, Modern Architecture, 99, unquestioningly repeats Mendelsohn's verdict, and the error has gone uncorrected. Time constraints at the Werk bund Theater would have prohibited the use of reinforced concrete, which required a large technical apparatus. Reinforced concrete would also have been avoided for exhibition architecture, which was intended to be short-lived. Note that the theater's roof was so flimsy that it leaked just before its scheduled opening, delaying the production of Faust by five days. See F.

Both Nikolaus Pevsner and Sigfried Giedion discuss van de Velde's contribution to modern architecture only in terms of the Jugendstil movement, and they base their judgments on works created in or be fore 1901. In doing so, they overlook the artist's move away from Ju gendstil after 1900.

See Banham, Theory and Design in the First Machine Age, 78; and Framp ton, Modern Architecture, 99. The majority of van de Velde's buildings constructed after 1900 were located in former East Germany, and many of them have been restored during the last decade, thus facilitating a reassessment of van de Velde's career in Germany.

A study of the building's influence on twentieth-century architecture lies beyond the parameters of this article, but it would need to begin with Miiller-Wulckow's observation, Architektur, vol. 3, 8, that the Werkbund Theater's auditorium served as an important source for Karl Schneider's cinema, the Emelkapalast in Hamburg, for Gropius's theater renovation in Jena, and for Poelzig's cinema, the Delikino in Breslau. 24.

Having lost the support of the Grand Duke and his subordinates, van de Velde tendered his resignation as director of Weimar's Grand Ducal School of Applied Arts in July 1914. In part, van de Velde hoped that his resignation would help the school's chances for survival. Under van de Velde's directorship, the school had operated as a private institution with nonguaranteed subsidies from the duchy, which covered only a portion of the school's operating budget. The duchy had explored as suming full ownership of the school over the course of 1913 and 1914. However, the outbreak of the war and universal male conscription left the school with no one to assume the directorship, and van de Velde stayed on for another year after his resignation to oversee the school's day-to-day operations (it remained open throughout the war). On the circumstances leading up to his resignation and surrounding his depar ture from Germany, see Volker Wahl, ed., Henry van de Velde in Weimar: Dokumente und Berichte zur Forderung von Kunsthandwerk und Industrie (1902 bis 1915) (Cologne: Bohlau, 2007). 34.

The Werkbund Theater's design was influenced by early cinematic ex periments by Loie Fuller and the Lumiere brothers, among others, whose work both van de Velde and Craig deeply admired. The build ing predates most examples of cinema architecture, which began ap pearing with some frequency only in the 1920s. Van de Velde enthusi astically praised Fuller in his Notizen von einer Reise nach Griechenland. On Fuller's use of cinema technology, see Giovanni Lista, Loie Fuller: Danseuse de la Belle Epoque (Paris: Somogy, 1995); Ann Cooper Albright, Traces of Light: Absence and Presence in the Work of Loie Fuller (Middle town, Conn.: Wesleyan University Press, 2007); and Rhonda Garelick, Electric Salome: Loie Fuller's Performance of Modernism (Princeton: Prince ton University Press, 2007). 37.

In reconstructing van de Velde's stage, I have relied on the following sources: Henry van de Velde, Le Theatre de I'exposition du Werkbund a Cologne 1914 et la scfrne tripartite (Antwerp: J.-E. Buschmann, 1925); the album of press clippings related to van de Velde's Werkbund Theater (FS X/1319) located at the Fonds van de Velde, Archives et Musee de la Litterature, Bibliotheque Albert I, Brussels; and studies for stage de signs (files 04667, 04668, 12250) located at the Theaterwissenschaftli che Sammlung, Universitat zu Koln, Cologne. I thank Fabrice van de Kerckhove at the Bibliotheque Albert I and Gerald Kohler at the The aterwissenschaftliche Sammlung for their assistance. 42. For a detailed description of the Werkbund Theater's technical innova tions, see "Kunst und Wissenschaft: Die technischen Einrichtungen im Werkbund-Theater," Rheinisch-Westfalische Zeitung, June 25, 1914. The abstract, painterly nature of van de Velde's aesthetic aligns his work with Fuller's performances and avant-garde cinema rather than the kinds of trompe l'oeil effects associated with early popular cinema and mass entertainment. As Jonathan Crary has demonstrated, early cine matic experiments largely relied on outdated or at least conventional notions of the stage as a space of illusionism in which the audience looked through the frame of a proscenium into a perspectival space populated with moving figures. By contrast, van de Velde fundamen tally redefined viewer experience by widening his stage and omitting the proscenium so that the stage merged with the auditorium and wrapped around its audience. On early cinema, see Crary, Suspensions of Perception: Attention, Spectacle, and Modern Culture (Cambridge, Mass.: MIT Press, 1999); and Thomas Elsaesser, ed., Early Cinema: Space, Frame, Narrative (London: British Film Institute, 1990).

On Behrens's stage designs, see Stanford Anderson, Peter Behrens and a New Architecture for the Twentieth Century (Cambridge, Mass.: MIT Press, 2000); and idem, "Peter Behrens's Highest Kultursymbol, the Theater," Perspecta 26 (1990): 103—34. On Fuchs, see Peter Jelavich, Munich and Theatrical Modernism: Politics, Playwriting, and Performance, 1890-1914 (Cambridge, Mass.: Harvard University Press, 1985); and Koss, Modern ism after Wagner, 95-185. On the distinctions between Craig's stage de signs and those of Fuchs, Dalcroze, Behrens, and Appia, see Grund, Zwischen den Kunsten. Van de Velde certainly knew of Fuchs's and Max Littmann's innovations in Munich and most likely viewed them as com petitors. In 1906-8, Littmann beat van de Velde in the competition to design Weimar's new Court Theater. On the competitive relationship between van de Velde and Littmann, see Christian Hecht, Streit um die richtige Moderne: Henry van de Velde, Max Littmann, und der Neubau des Weimarer Hoftheaters (Weimar: Kreis der Freunde und Forderer des Stadtmuseums, 2005). 44. On Max Reinhardt, see J. L. Styan, Max Reinhardt (Cambridge: Cam bridge University Press, 1982). 45. The majority of photographs of Werkbund Theater performances pub lished in newspapers in 1914 reflect Barnowsky's naturalistic approach to set design, which dominated the opening production of Faust, Part I. Informed critics commented that the naturalistic stage sets contra dicted the aesthetic principles motivating van de Velde's stage architec ture. They noted the shortcomings of specific scenes, but they also identified those scenes where stage and scenery beautifully conspired to produce a stunning and unprecedented visual experience. These reports suggest that the styles of set designs were above all mixed in the early performances of the Werkbund Theater, where van de Velde only partially succeeded in realizing his stage decor ideas. For a nu anced and informed response to Faust's stage sets, see Willi Dunwald, "Werkbund," Die Schaubuhne 10, nos. 27, 28 (July 9, 1914), reprinted in a facsimile of the journal (Konigstein: Athenaum Verlag, 1980), 17-19. The critical response to stage decor for Verhaeren's The Cloister was more uniformly positive, in part because van de Velde had by then as sumed more control over stage decor. However, even then the theater fell short of van de Velde's expectations, and the most informed re views of the Werkbund stage normally supplemented an experience of the theater building with van de Velde's exhibited studies for theater decor as well as conversations with the artist. For informed, firsthand accounts of what van de Velde wanted to achieve in his theater, see Fritz Coerper, "Das Werkbundtheater: Eine kunstlerische Versuchs buhne," Berliner Tageblatt, February 27, 1914. Coerper served on the Werkbund Theater Committee and had intimate knowledge of van de Velde's project. Significantly, he published the article months before the theater opened. 46. On the scene's lighting effects, see Dr. Rud. Regeniter, "Kolner Kunst brief: Henry van de Veldes 'Werkbund-Theater,' " Bonner Zeitung, June 22, 1914. 47. These painted studies are located today in the Theaterwissenschaftliche Sammlung, Universitat zu Koln, Cologne (files 04667, 04668, 12250), where they are attributed to Barnowsky's set designer, Svend Gade; see Bernd Vogelsang and Rudi Strauch, eds., Findbuch der Szenischen Graphik, vol. 1 (Cologne: Institut fur Theater-, Film- und Fernsehwissen schaft/Theatersammlung, 1993). However, we know that van de Velde created stage designs for Werkbund Theater performances, which he displayed in the exhibition's main hall even before the theater opened. Van de Velde's production and exhibition of finished stage designs, combined with the style and exquisite quality of the studies themselves, suggest his authorship. Gade leaned toward naturalism, whereas the studies show a more abstract understanding of line and color. Their extremely finished and refined nature supports the idea that they were intended for exhibition. The Theaterwissenschaftliche Sammlung's at tribution of the sketches to Gade reflects the fact that Gade had offi cial control over stage designs for Faust, but this does not mean that he authored the studies, many of which were never realized onstage. On van de Velde's exhibition of studies in the "Theater" division of the main exhibition hall, see Freund, "Die Kolner Deutsche Werkbundaus stellung. Teuber, "Henry van de Veldes Werkbund-Theater," 104, attri butes the studies to van de Velde. 48.

I thank Gerda Wendermann at Weimar's Klassik Stiftung for bringing Ernst Hardt to my attention.

Adolf Behne, "Die Ausstellung des deutschen Werkbundes II," Dresdner Neueste Nachrichten, June 25, 1914. 50. In addition to Kolbe, van de Velde had worked with von Hofmann and Steger prior to the 1914 exhibition. Von Hofmann created six mural paintings for a museum hall that van de Velde exhibited at the 1906 Dresden Applied Arts Exhibition. On this project, see Annette Wagner and Klaus Wolbert, eds., Ludwig von Hofmann—arkadische Utopien in der Moderne (Darmstadt: Institut Mathildenhohe, 2006). Van de Velde en countered Milly Steger in Hagen. A student of Kolbe, Steger belonged to Osthaus's circle of artists and created monumental sculptures for the facade of the Hagen Theater.

Natives of Antwerp and collaborators there as well as in Brussels begin ning in the 1880s, van de Velde and Verhaeren shared artistic, intellec tual, and social convictions, including a deep engagement with French culture, including Impressionist and Postimpressionist painting and Symbolist theater and literature. Verhaeren resided in St-Cloud, on the western outskirts of Paris, as of 1891. He would become an outspoken critic of German aggression in World War I, whereas van de Velde sought less direct modes of confrontation. As an employee of Weimar's Grand Duchy, director of Weimar's Grand Ducal School of Applied Arts, resident of Germany, and father of five children, van de Velde had professional and personal obligations in Germany that he wanted to protect.

Karl Ernst Osthaus, "Die Kunst der Biihne: Reform des Stadtischen Schauspielhauses in Hagen?" (1909), reprinted in Reden und Schriften, 145-52. In arguing for van de Velde's influence on Osthaus, I expand Schwartz's account of Osthaus's theater aesthetics (The Werkbund, 173 76). Schwartz examines Osthaus's indebtedness to Behrens's 1901 the ater experiments at the Darmstadt Artists' Colony. However, he over looks Osthaus's equally important interest in Craig and van de Velde, as well as his significant investment of time and energy in the Werk bund Theater project. 61.

On Munich's importance as a modern theater capital, see Jelavich, Mu nich and Theatrical Modernism. Obrist's participation in Munich theatri cal circles around 1900 deserves more space than can be devoted to it here. In addition to his contacts with Riemerschmid, he befriended Georg Fuchs, who wrote two key articles on Obrist before founding the Munich Artists' Theater in 1908. Obrist also forged a close relationship with Endell, who would go on to design Wolzogen's Modey Theater (Das Bunte Theater) in Berlin in 1901.

As early as 1913, the Grand Duke of Weimar-Saxony-Eisenach explored options for replacing van de Velde as director of the Grand Ducal School of Applied Arts. After having been reduced to unworkable cir cumstances, van de Velde finally tendered his resignation in July 1914—the same month of the Werkbund Congress—in an attempt to save his school. On the circumstances surrounding van de Velde's res ignation as school director in Weimar, see Wahl, Henry van de Velde in Weimar. 82. See Osthaus, "An Henry van de Velde," 187-88. 83. For Osthaus's wartime offer of help, see Osthaus's letter to van de Velde, dated July 13, 1915, Fonds van de Velde, FSX 625/12, Biblio theque Albert I. Although van de Velde never wrote a word against Osthaus, his most important and influential patron, van de Velde's wartime refusal of Osthaus's help suggests fundamental differences between the two men. Once in Switzerland, after his forced departure from Germany, he held true to his internationalist and pacifist princi ples, taking up contact with pacifists, including Rene Schickele. 84.
