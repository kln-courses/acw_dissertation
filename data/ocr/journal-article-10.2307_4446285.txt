<plain_text><page sequence="1">PRIMATES OF SOUTH ASIA- ECOLOGY, SOCIOBIOLOGY AND BEHAVIOR by M. L. Roonwal and S. M. Mohnot. 1977.,Harvard University Press (79 Garden Street, Cambridge, Massa- chusetts 02138). 353 p. $22.50. The authors of this text provide an authorative guide or survey of twenty- five primate species in South Asia, an area providing the greatest concentra- tion of a variety of primate species and forms. The book is a comprehensive sum- mary of research on the part of the authors, as well as a consolidation of published information in different places and languages and includes a bibliogra- phy of over 1,000 references. A general introduction includes pri- mate characteristics and classification, geographical distribution, aspects of reproduction, social organization and mother-infant relations. The body of the book deals with the twenty-five species one-by-one in some detail. For each species is given the first published valid name and authority, 380 THE AMERICAN BIOLOGY TEACHER, SEPTEMBER 1978</page><page sequence="2">as well as vernacular names, followed by the alternative names used by various authorities. Following the taxonomic references are brief particulars regarding the ex- ternal characters and geographical dis- tribution, as well as a systematic note listing the subspecies occurring in South Asia. A detailed account of ecology, socio- biology, and behavior in two sections "In the Field" and "In Captivity" follows. Topics dealt with are: habitat; food and drink; daily rhythm of activity; territory and home range; movements, social groups and their composition; reproduc- tion and reproductive behavior; breeding seasons; interaction within groups; forms of social communication; dominance hierarchies; grooming; play activities; interactions with other groups of the same species, primates of other species, and other animals; hybridization; and longevity. The book would be very useful for zookeepers or people going into field studies of these primates, psychologists who were doing animal studies-or studies of anthropomorphism -and would also be an excellent reference book for libraries.
