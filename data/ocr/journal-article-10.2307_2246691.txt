<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Creed of Science, Religious, Moral and Social. By WILLIAM GRAHAM, M.A., author of "Idealism: An Essay, Metaphysical and Critical ". London: Kegan Paul, 1881. Pp. 412. The object of the present work is to furnish a critical estimate of what may be taken to be the generally accepted creed of men of science, together with an answer to the question how far certain transcendental beliefs are affected by the results of recent physical inquiries. There are propositions indeed respecting which Science becomingly preserves a serene silence, a silence, however, not seldom correctly construed as polite denial, it is a leading aim of the Writer of this book to distinguish between the cases where lack of positive evidence may rightly be held to justify a negative attitude, and those other instances where "the conclusion of the whole matter" amounts simply to this--where is no organ there can be no vision. It is true Science claims large rights both of affirmation and of denial, indeed, to judge rather from practice than theory, without respect of time, place, or subject; for not even yet, with all its balanced intelligence, does the world appear to have settled the old question, whether Faith should precede Knowledge, or Knowledge take precedence over Faith. On the one hand, it is assumed almost as an axiom that assent is valueless in the absence of evidence; on the other, the exercise of "believing where we cannot prove" is claimed as the supreme wisdom. We are reminded of this venerable controversy in perusing Mr. Graham's volume, for very much of the argument hinges upon it. Thus we are not at all clear what is our author's criterion of specu- lative truth. Sometimes it seems the "instincts of the human heart"; at other times, the unthinkableness of the contradictory; again, some inexplicable necessity, a "must believe" or "we are compelled to interpret," and even a majority vote of illustrious thinkers. A more superficial defect is the failure' to observe a dis- tinctly logical order in the treatment of the topics. Book I. discusses</page><page sequence="2">564 Critical Notices. the Creed of Science, Religious and Moral; Book II. the Gospel and the Social Creed of Science; and Book IIL the Future of Religion and Morals: a tolerably clear division; but in point of fact the same ground is constantly being re-traversed, and to grasp the full force of the argument, portions of separate chapters must be carefully collated. Passing to the matter and general tone of the work, there is nothing but praise fairly due. Such free criticisms of the philosophy of science are rarely made with as full comprehension of the doctrines criticised and so evident a desire to be thoroughly impartial. Mr. Graham always makes the best case he can for the positive doctrines, and even after delivering himself of what he deems- their needed supplement and correction, turns back once and again to interpose an assumed reply on the part of his imaginary collocutor. It is evidently the author's desire to gain no merely verbal victory, but really to worm out the very truth. Books like this are certainly needed at the present stage of speculation, controversial works written, as one may say, from within the scientific camp. Nothing can be plainer than these words. " Science is the true revelation to men- the only revelation that men have ever received or can receive." " The truths of science will save you; in the sequel they will save the world; they alone can do so. They will save youir soul in the only sense in which it can be saved. . . ." After such unstinted laudation, the reader will perhaps wonder how it happens that the writer is so discontented with this excellent guide. We shall presently see. And perhaps it may be as well at once to understand our author's attitude to Positive Science. Mr. Graham is willing to receive at the hands of men of science all that they show to be the fruit of first- hand converse with Nature. Whether the theme be the genesis of physical worlds, the elaboration of living forms, the origin of man, the evolution of moral order-he does not seek to evade the conclu- sions which a close adherence to the rules of evidence forces upon the truth-loving mind; but he finds, on closely scrutinising the facts, that they are either largely interwoven with theories or that their discoverers regard them as self-explanatory. Either the line between Fact and Speculation is blurred, or Fact is set up as self- sufficing. Now, Mr. Graham very properly requires that there should be no mistake about what we must and what we may believe. We have seen him declare that there is no other revelation but Science, and this assettion covers the refusal to accept the deliverances of certain remarkable men, for whom special organs of intuition or knowledge have been claimed, as if they were oracles from heaven. The secrets of Nature, of the knowable universe, are only to be read by prolonged interrogation, but by the same raethod of patient obser- vation and experiment ase legible by all men. And yet, though Science can teach us so much, the whole region of belief is not accessible to her. Whatever be the way by which we come by it, there is much else to which Mr. Graham thinks the human mind insists upon holding fast, and which, whatever the character of our phenomenal researches, it will never surrender. How and why is</page><page sequence="3">Critical Notices. 565 this ? The answer is rather hinted at than plainly enounced in the book before us. It is, we presume, that " deep-seated in our mystic frame" there is an element identical in essence with that Ineffable Existence in which "we live and move and have our being If Science be only crust-knowledge this is so, and that Science is crust- knowledge we take to be our author's contention. "She (Science) has long since handed over the question of the why of phenomena to metaphysics, reservirng to herself the question of the how, the question of fact." To speak scholastically, Truth is bounded materially by positive experience, by the presentations of the Changeable, but formally it is enlarged to the dimensions of Infinite and Perfect Reality. Our field of cognition is ever a sphere, our own position being by turns at the centre and the circunmference: at the centre because the Existent must become Object to us, is over against, remote from us; at the circumference when we become objects to other intelligences. There is no Macrocosm without a Microcosm, only chaos unless we have the principle of Order in our own breasts. And unless we are at the heart of things, what right have we to challenge the sufficiency of Science? Mr. Graham finds a philosophy based on the current theories of Physics to be a revised version of the Democritean materialism. It leaves us with no Deity but Chance, "a universe drifting nowhither ". But " Chance" is no explanation, it is the absence of explanation. The metaphysical appetite will also be satis- fied, and supplies the idea of Purpose. Here is the first great gap in the Philosophy of Evolution according to our author,-it has no room in its system for Purpose. But how to get the notion of Purpose without drawing upon positive experience, without in fact abstracting from a select class of human actions ? The difficulty is to steer clear between that Scylla of pure haphazard and the Charybdis of trans- ferring an attribute of finite sentient beings to the vast cosmos, to the Power indeed beneath all appearance. Now I am prepared to go one mile with Mr. Graham, but I cannot see my way to venturing, twain. The "c onception of a grand Reality," so ably contended for by him, the God of Spinoza and of all poets and philosophers who have caught his spirit, the Absolute which refuses to be circumscribed either by a Materialism abstracted from presentations of sense or an Idealism abstracted from representations of intelligenice, is to me, as to him, a datum making all experience possible; but it is a graver matter than I think Mr. Graham realises to apply the attribute purposeful to this All-one, and graver still to describe the supposed purpose as gobd. Mr. Graham does not seem to me to have sufficiently reflected that Purpose by itself is a barren term. What is the content of this Purpose? In what sense can it be said the Impersonal -God he recognises has a purpose? To stop short with such proximate ehtds as "a better world on the earth a higher and also a happier one," is scarcely to furnish a half-answer to the question. It doubtless is a sign of prudence in a thinker to attempt to pry no further, but is no mark of speculative wisdom. Species appear and vanish, worlds come and go, and yet 38</page><page sequence="4">566 Critical Notices. " the most important of all (divine attributes), purpose " remains un- realised. What is this Purpose which urges myriads of beings into consciousness, and then recalls them into the silence of the unconscious after a few years of more or less painful strnggle ? Ieeming ourselves to be now in the world's noniage, perhaps the " higiher and happier" Future of the period of maturity may seem a predestined -goal; but what outlook will there be for the "c rowning race " who peer into the coming night of time, when the waves of dissolution begin to be faintly heard breakinc upon the terrestrial shores ? But our author's faith is large; it not only includes the hope of an Earthly Paradise, but also trust in " the good purpose of the universe ". Now as Mr. Graham does not reveal to us the purpose of the universe at all, I confess my inability to gauge the appropriateness of epithets like those of good or evil. His real meaning, however, is something less than this. He merely intends to express his conviction that in the sphere of hunian life the social virtues are -gaining ground on the selfish propensities, and that measured by a hedonistic standard it was well this earth of ours was sped on its evolutionary journey. In other words he is a declared Optimist, even to the extent of the somewhat dogmatical assertion: " The direct contrary of the pessimist proposition may be held; life for most men is not ani evil; up to the day of death, if asked, they would so reply; and there is no going beyond the individual's testimony in his own case ". This somewhat confident statement is followed up by the remark: "His (i.e. the individual's) testimony to his own experience of the worth of life is more to be relied upon than any system of philosophy which at best applies to average cases ". Surely the optimistic position is not so iuncertain as this, that it has to rely upon personal consciousness in preference to a system of philosophy which at best applies to average cases. On the same showing, then, we should admit the liberum arbitrium indifferentice, a matter on which Mr. Graham is quite content to forsake the solid ground of private testimony. But Mr, Graham seems to labour under the strange delusion that the pessimist is com- mitted to the belief that feeling is always painful (or indifferent), that in fact he does not know the meaning of pleasure at all; for he indulges in an eloquent rhapsody to show that we may and do have hours of perfect felicity, " moments when we have seemed to hold happiness in our hands". But who doubts that? who doubts the artist's rapture at a beautiful sunset, or the quiet joy in the attainment of truth And notwithstanding that he furniishes some well-drawn pictures of the shady side of life, it is clear that Mr. Graham does not appreciate the strength of the pessimistic position. His view of life, as indeed his whole philosophy, seems to me far too much tinged by his own poetic spirit; he cannot and will not submit to the stern pressure of Fact. Things must be better than they seem, there must be a glorious time conming; if only men will be patient, if they will but resign themselves, and so on, all will be exceedingly well. But let us keep apart our aspirations and our positive observations. Let us first of all employ the despised method of averages, and then</page><page sequence="5">Critical Notices. 567 inquire what is the worth of our ideals. Now there is one extremely significant fact, I think, in this controversy of Optimism and Pessim- ism, viz., the very strong tendency of mankind to place its Paradise or its Golden Age in anly other age of the world than its own. Either we have left behind us the Happy Valley, or there is an Island of the Blest towards which we are sailing, and which we shall surely reach in due time. That " our America is here or nowhere " is the grand lesson of life which only the ripe sage really learns, learns indeed usually when its mastery has become valueless. Now, if the pereinnial expectation, the perception that " man never is but always to be blest," is a state of mind so agreeable as to outweigh the pains and troubles of the actual life, a prospective Optimist may be admitted to have the best of it; or if we are to shut our eyes to the agonies which have paved the way for our felicity, if we are to ignore the fact that hitherto in proportion to man's sympathy has been man's sorrow, then again Pessimism may be considered to be disposed of. But if, keeping a strict account, we reckon up the total cost of our possessions-the laborious initiative, the ever-renewed discontent, the Sisyphus labour of philanthropists, and the unutterable pangs which ignorance and deliberate cruelty have evoked-and can still find the pleasure reaped an ample justification; a case will be made out for " the good purpose of the universe " better than I confess it seems to me existing data warrant. In Book I. our author discusses the various scientific cosmogonies, the origin and evolution of Man and his place in nature. He deems Natural Selection a better-proved hypothesis in Biology than the Nebular Hypothesis in Astronomy, only quarrelling with the Dar- winian evolutionists for regarding their positive as a final philosophy. He rebukes the crude Materialism of Prof. Tyndall which professes to find in the solar fires all the Wit and wisdom of the yet unborn earth, and thinks the transmission by inheritance of favourable accidental variations, in the case of the more recondite marvels of animal and moral life "too futile an explanation to be seriously believed or entertained". It is the unlucky word "accidental" in the Origin of Species that Mr. Graham fastens upon; and, taking it au sArieux, he devotes page upon page to expressing his convic- tion that with only " the two shadowy and impalpable ageints" " Chance and unimaginable years," we should never have been able to get our eyes, much less our eye-sight. And yet "in such ways as natural selection indicates, Nature must have travelled ". Why then be distrustful of Nature's self-sufficiency? Mr. Graham will not have an Anthropo-Theism at any price, and yet he is evidently alarmed lest we should burn our Bridgewater Treatises. We exhort him most seriously to consider the stability of his foundations. If he desires to retain Spinoza's Substance, he must refrain with Spinoza from the most attenuated teleology; or if he insists strenuously on 4" a rational purpose," let him see to it that he do not glide back into the anthropomorphic theologies from which he thinks the world well delivered. It seems a harmless thing to grant just a little purpose</page><page sequence="6">568 Critical N! otices. and a little planning in the mighty procession of events; but the thinnest end admitted of the anthropomorphic wedge will split up Mr. Graham's Pantheistic Monism, and strew the world again with all the forms of a gross or refined idolatry. "Chance as an explanation- and if Design be denied Chance must be offered as the explanation- is," he says, " a word expressing nothing, a word which, under pre- tence of explanation, affirms nothing whatever." But who is it that offers "'-Chance " as an explanation; who in fact could offer " a word expressing nothing"? I must alto demur to Mr. Graham's paren- thesis-" and if design be denied, chance must be offered as the expla- nation ". Chance cai in no case be offered because it is insignificant. Those who are Monists in fact not in name, who really admit a Sub- stance which is neither Mind nor Matter, and have a fixed aversion to a word so clearly connotinig a mental mode as Design, do not-wish to offer any explanation of the world in Mr. Graham's'sense of explana- tion at all. They do not think that anything is made clearer by adducing a causality which they only know in a limited class of animal actions, and which by no stretchk of imagination they can conceive as bringing about the effects whose origin it is desired to trace. "lf we must elect between the two agencies, Chance and Design, the latter must be nearer the truth. Design we know already in our, own case to be a true shaping power, while Chance effects nothing, but evil in the long run." A strange agency that which is symbolised by " a word expressing nothing," and which yet possesses the power of effect- ing nothing but evil ! Surely, instead of affirming nothing whatever,. Chance must affirm a good deal if it is productive of such serious consequences. These conflicting statements we confess somewhat perplex us. Which are we to take as Mr. Graham's deliberate opinion -that there is in truth no option for us, that we must have Design or nothing at all? or adopt in its stead a real although an evil prin- ciple ? His polemic against Chance is so determined that we are almost tempted to credit him with the latter. Chance is Ahrinlan, Design or Purpose is Ormuzd. Darwin and the men of science revere the former, but all people of right minds will present their adoration to the good Spirit. I regret to find myself at so great a distance from Mr. Graham on a point so fundamential, but I now come to a subject where I -find the gulf between us even wider, where indeed no hope of compromise is possible. The subject is the Nature of Man. Here, as elsewhere, Mr. Graham admits so much that Science offers for acceptance, that his efforts to save the remnants of older speculations seem almost wilful perversity. He will have nothing to do 'with the metaphysi- cian's soul-substance, or the K-antian noumenal Ego. Man is the highest of the animals, liaving a larger measure, it is true, of the Purposive Power breathing through him than the brutes, but still affiliated to them by lineal descent, a link in the endless chain of Nature. And yet for all that, though his faculties be not different in kind but only in degree from theirs, though the marvel of conscious- itess be the concomitant of a material brain, though mind is so</page><page sequence="7">rtctial Notices. 569 dependent on matter that bodily disorder or a deteriorated circulation will ruin the moral nature, this superior animal is still so unique that for each individual there is reserved innumerable transmigrations, conscious or unconscious, in this or other worlds. " Science has not proved, nor can she prove, that a conscious being may not hereafter emerge somewhere, in which or through which I may awaken again into being. . . . There may have been past existences without memory; there may be a future existence without memory, just as my present feeling of conscious existence is independent of memory. None can tell what makes it [self-consciousness], how I have it, why it did not associate itself with another rather than me, why it did not become the conscious covering to another ego as its real core rather than mine,-why, in a word, to put it in the extremest form, it was not another being rather than I, which was born when I was born, and which slowly awoke into consciousness instead of me; and none can pretend for a moment to affirm that the same strange mystery of awaking from unconsciousness into conscious being, which has already once happened in my case, may not happen once ag,ain." And this possibility is strengthened by the Buddhist alarms about endless re-incarnation, by the hopes and fears of great poets, by the Critique of Practical Reason of Immanuel Kant, so much so indeed that Mr. Graham can calmly conclude: " Another existence, then, is possible, likely, certain; nay, more than one such ". I do not know how other readers may be affected, but the feeling, experienced by myself is one of sheer amazement. Mr. Graham is welcome to the dreams of the imaginative East, to the comfort derivable from Hamlet's famous monologue, and Goethe's personal confidence-these peculiarly subjective " aids to reflection " cannot detain us; but the argumen- tum ad ignorantiam which constitutes the appeal to the reason does " give us pause ". Beclause I do not know how I am I, because self- consciousness has non-conscious antecedents making apparently an irrefragable chain of existence-therefore we are nearer the truth with the great hope than without it. Common sense says-what is Im- mortality without memory? Our author answers, well your Ego is not somebody else's Ego, and even though you re-emerge as a stock or a stone (" unconscious existence is also possible, as of the stone or the plant, and also, what is of much greater importance, unconscious existence of a great and grand order "), the particular stock or stone would not be some other stock or stone. It seems to him something unfathomably mysterious that lhe should not be somebody else. But what is the "I" that is favoured with such strange awe? Surely not the flexure of body and limb. the expression of face and feature, which differentiates human beings to vulgar apprehension; not the dexterities, disposition, bent of character, chiefly owed to my paternal and maternal ancestors, with a slight modification due to special educa- tional influences. But let this spiritual set, these tricks of body and mind be eliminated, and what remains as the content of that " I " about whose fate the mystic is so concerned? What is there in the recognition of this barren unity of consciousness to answer " the</page><page sequence="8">570 Critical Notices. eternal and terrible cry of. the human heart "-that cry, which it turns out is after all the provocation of this strange argumnent: "For we touch here at the primal and true source of the desire for another life, and of all the arguments in favour of it" But a future without me,mory of the past (memory is frankly surrendered by our author), with none of the old marks of resemblance to the foregone personality, with an outward manifestation wholly alien to that by which it was perceived in this sublunary sphere, is hardly a future to repay Mr. Graham's eloquent pleading, and would surely not be valued by his large-hearted poets. Is it necessary to point out to a man of Mr. Graham's intelligence that the fact of self-consciousness can have no beafing upon this question of immortality, that the Ego which it testifies to is not even the thinnest ghost of an Ego, but a mere logical symbol. shapeless and vacant? But then there is the demon- stration of the famous Kant ! It is to be hoped we are not approaching .an age of Neo-Scholasticism when this great name will be employed to enforce submission in philosophy as that of Aristotle in the Mfiddle Ages, a pendant to the authority of the Fathers in the Christian Church; but on this particular subject it is fortunate that the anti- dote has been supplied along with the bane. Kant's Practical is so glaringly at variance with his Theoretical Reason, that respect for the thinker may best be shown by treating the two Critiques as unrelated products of his genius. A two-fold distrust hangs over the Practical Reason. It endeavours to legitimatise Ideas which the author else- where ingenuously confesses no logic would ever constrain hinm to abandon, and it surreptitiously employs conceptions whose extra- phenomenal use had been already proscribed. Is Mr. Graham pre- pared to go the road that Kant went ? Is he prepared to hypostatise a bare logical suibject?1 Will he quantify the spaceless' and timeless realm of Noumena ? And finally, which will he renounce-his Spinozistic Monism, or his Leibnitzian Pluralism? One or the other must go by the board; b~ut even then the human heart will hardly receive the satisfaction it craves. Book II. is devoted to a consideration of the drift of current opinion on social questions, and of the disinclination to accept the logic of Science on the part of the uninstructed many. The invaluablei gain of a strenuous competition is here pointed out, and at the same, time a patient-hearing is granted to the statements of grievances of the less fortunate. The teaching of these chapters is for the most part admirable. The over-conservative attitude of Sociologists, whose reliance for the uplifting of the masses is on the infinitely slow progress of general forces to the disregard of the initiation of special enthusiasm, is deprecated ;_ and on' the other hand, the impatience of the Socialist who favours instant legislation as a cure for all ills is no less rebuked. Mr. Graham shows himself a far-seeing, and judicious counsellor when, following, in the steps of Mlill and others, he advo- cates an improvement of the present system of individualism and competition, a more genuine trial of a really free industrial regime in preference to any arbitrary interference with present economic forces.</page><page sequence="9">Critical Notices. 571 He seems to have but a dim faith in co-operative production; but co-operative distribution has not yet been pushed to the utmost, and it is hard to say what capacities for combination will be developed by the various efforts at union which are now being made in so many directions; the ever-increasing number of societies, councils, com- mittees offering a training which will have its due effect in the industrial experiments of no distant futuire. Lastly we come to our author's deliverances on Ethics and his partial indictment of the Experience Morality. On this subject he has two chapters closing the book entitled respectively " Objections to the Evolution Ethics " and " Conflict and Partial Conciliation between the New and Old Ethics," besides a few pages in the Introduction. From these we gather that Mr. Graham is discontented with all former systems and also with recent attempts to found a scientific Ethics. He seems to think that just as Religion is endangered by ignoring a Cosmic Purpose, so Virtue is jeopardised by resting content with the observed causes and effects of human actions, and that unless certain premisses be borrowed prom Intuitionism the world will relapse into seltishness. It is not altogether clear how maniy of the objections urged to the Experiential Ethics from the side of Transcendentalism are accepted by Mfr. Graham, but I think I am ricght in concluding that he is considerably affected by many of the difficulties raised by theological and philosophical alarmists. Let us see what these objections are. They seem to amount to this. An Ethics which traces the slow rise of Conscience, which in fact resolves the inspiration of duty into inheritecd tendency, really dethrones the Moral Law fromn its commanding authority, and allows allegiance to be lightly renounced by those who do not choose, to be bound by the habits of their ancestors. Again, if virtue has been engendered by the pressure of social necessities, having no other warrant than social sanction, which is in effect to declare that might makes right, the door is opened for the equally valid principle that what man has made man can destroy. And so the Pleasurable coming to be the last word of a scientific Ethics will induce an era of social degeneracy, and the modern civilised world will tend to dissolution like the old Roman Empire,' to be regenerated by the Goths of the proletariate who have not weakened their moral fibre by speculating on the origin of moral distinctions. Mr. Graham is careful to tell us that the alarm is exaggerated, and. believes there is a misunderstanding at the bottom of it in the con- founding of the must due to the social environment, and the ought of ideality. Man has shaped out the law of his conduct by struggle; well and good. To trace the history of the moral sentiments is an interesting study for the psychologist and the sociological student, but it is needless, if not danoerous, knowledge for the common man. "Let hiin accept the fact of its sacredness, as given in the feelings, in all faith." lt may be quite true that the welfare of the tribe was the first moving-spring of duty, but the good of society is too large an object now, and the simple and more practical rule runs: "Veracity, justice alnd benevolence are now to be pursued for their own sakes ".</page><page sequence="10">572 Critical Notices. But although the prospect seems at first sight so gloomy, though "there is real and just cause of alarm for the future of men," as we near the close of the volume we find the inists disperse and are comforted by the assurance that-" Virtue will not be destroyed. Morality, as well as religion, will remain. It will remain as an eternal necessity of our social nature and of our condition in the world." And this because " the doctrine of heredity is on the side of morality ". Yet the Data of Ethics must not be implicitly trusted, for as regards " the utilitarianism of Spencer," " there are the most serious questions raised by it; nay, the most serious and sinister of all questions-whether Virtue has any reality beyond Colnvention -is once more irresistibly raised by it; alid the answer to the question from the evolution point of view is not quite satisfactory ". Here, as elsewhere throughout his work, Mr. Graham seems to have a fondness for raising spectres in order apparently to have the satisfaction of laying them, allowing them, however, to show themselves again from time to time, so that the simple-minded man longing for peace is kept in a perpetual state of tremor, and does not exactly know what to make of it. In fact, the impression conveyed is that our author is one of that not rare class at the present day whose love of truth is too developed to let them close: their eyes to the light of Science, but yet whose memory of faded glories is so strong that they are only half inclined to trust it to the end. His Transcendentalism and his Experientialism are not harmonised; they are simply juxtaposed, and he slips from the critical to the dogmatic veini almost without knowing it. It is well to see what we have to surrender if we are to be faithful followers of the new methods, but no good purpose is served by trying, to put a patch here and there on our worn-out garments. Transcendentalism has an important function in providing an onto- logic base for our phenomenal beliefs, but it is simply mischievous when it intrudes into the domain of positive knowledge. We are reminded of this most forcibly in the present instance. What is meant by the question "whether Virtue has any reality beyond Convention " 7 Has anyone ever contended that men make virtues by a sort of parlianmentary vote 7 Even the terrible Hobbes looked upon the moral law as a practical necessity; and surely no one in these days of historical inquiry is likely to antedate the age of deliberate legislation, or even to imagine that the rule of conduct was shaped in the student's cell. Well then, if we are indebted to social needs for all the codes of Duty this world has ever possessed, why doubt that the same causes will be sufficient for the future? Whv attempt to make the futile division between the Divine and the Human, the voces populi et Dei, which has given such an artificial air to some of the best thinking of the past ? For as little as there can be a private Ethics, so little can there be a conflict between the Ethics of Utility and the Categorical Imperative. The Ideals of Truth, Justice, Charity, reduced to the concrete, are reals which the social spirit inevitably does homage to, although with ever plainer expression, according as the various members of the social system attain a more</page><page sequence="11">Critical Notices. 573 intimate union. The error is, and we think Mr. Graham is not free from it, in laying an exaggerated stress upon the "individual," as if the individual were truly independent. The unreality and the inflexibility of the Intuitional Ethics, with its unlimited accountability and Absolute Morality, are the result of that over- strained conception of individuality which fails to discern the seat of Human Unity in the Body Politic. No wonder that if the transient Ego is exalted to this sublime eminence a strain is put upon his powers too great for him to bear. Morality is safe, then, simply because Morality means the voice of the Common Nature; it is a witness to an underlying community which cannot be dissolved before Humanity itself perishes. And instead of reference to the origin of moral ideas weakening this common feeling, it is a good aid to its realisation; for nothing is plainer, from what is now known of barbarous tribes, than that a common faith and practide is as old as private fancy and self-seeking, that it is as reasonable to imagine a r4gime of Egoism as to expect a suspension of the law of gravitation. The Data of Ethics will strengthen the sense of obligation which in- dividualistic Intuitionism would have weakened long ago if specula- tion could have effected it. A word before I close as to the relation of Mr. Graham to contem- porary thought. In reading his book I am constantly reminded of Dr. Eduard von Hartmann. The stress laid on Purpose is a feature of the latter's philosophy as important as his revised Pessimism. The difference is, however, that von Hartmann's Teleology is a Cosmic Teleology, whereas Mr. Graham -with an Englishman's modesty fights shy of finality, and thinks he has done enouglh for the salvation of an ungpiritual Science when he indulges in generalities which seem like an echo of Mr. Arnold's strain " the Power that makes for righteous- ness ". I hold von Hartmann to be here not only the bolder but the deeper thinker. Mr. Graham, it is true, is not a convert to Pessimism, but he is sufficiently impressed by it to rest its final rejection on its practical danger rather than its theoretical inconclusiveness. "The pessimism of the philosophers in any case is not a true gospel. It does not contain the true word of life for man to-day in Europe; and even if it were wholly true, it would be the kind of truth which it does not profit to insist upon. Unless wvith the diagnosis of the disease there is also the prescription supplied, as by Buddha, there is no good end served by preaching pessimism." Now, nobody wants to "preach" pessimism, and if anybody tried to do so to-day in Europe, he would certainly obtain a poor congregation; but I must protest against the suggestion that the teaching of philosophy should accommodate itself to the supposed cravings of' the age, and also that the theorist is bound to be practical likewise. But I am astonislhed at the remark that the pessimist's prescription must be the asceticism of Buddha. A remedy which would only have the effect of removing the most clear-sighted fron their labour of alleviating suffering, and so permit a more prolonged agony to the deluded masses, hardly recommends itself as a measure of real philanthropy. The supposed</page><page sequence="12">574 Critical Notices. conflict between the Utilitarianism of Mill and the Ethics of Spencer also reminds one of the contrast between Social-Eudaemonism and Progress enlarged upon by the Berlin thinker, but the latter would hardly say that there is " opposition wide as the poles between the new and the old utilitarianism ". If " the happiness of the species," qualifying happiness by "attaiinable," be the aim of the old utili- tarianism, then there is' no conflict between the Ethics of Utility and the Ethics of Progress. The happiness of the aggregate of contem- porary individuals no doubt is an aim directly in conflict with a principle which requires frequent disregard of seeming philanthropy, but if the well-being of an Organism ever changing in its parts be the aim, then it may be perfectly true that the " service of Humanity " and the "law of struggle" are one. The antagonism belongs to a different specudative basis, no other than the despised Pessimismn, according, to which Progress is a higher end than Human Happiness; and the circumstance that Mr. Grahamu does find the antagonism so great, and yet is so loath to abandon the Evolution-principle, is of good augury for his reconsideration of the complacent assumption that Scielnce is and must be optimistic.
