<plain_text><page sequence="1">Technology and the Character of Contemporary Life: a philosophical inquiry Albert Borgmann, 1984 Chicago, University of Chicago Press pp. 302, £26.25, $28.75 The Creative Computer: machine intelligence and human knowledge Donald Michie &amp; Rory Johnston, 1985 London, Penguin pp. 264, £6.95 These two books both focus on technology, and both might be characterised as discussions of a philosophical kind, taking that term in its broadest sense. They are both, in very different ways, at pains to challenge widespread stereotypical views about technology. There, more or less, the similarity ends. The first book is the work of an American philosophy professor, an urbane man of letters, addressing technology primarily as a social phenomenon, which, he insists, has to be assessed from a critical distance, wrested from its everyday, taken-for-granted status, and re-evaluated in the light of an invocation of older, more traditional values and practices. The second is a celebration of a particular technological domain: that of artificial intelligence, written by one of the leading researchers in the field, in concert with a technological journalist. Each book seeks in different ways to get us to sharpen our awareness of technology, and in particular to break down the common unreflective approach to technological products which views them as commodities possessing mysterious principles of working, to be used but not understood. But in the case of Borgmann's work the method adopted is sociological, political and conceptual reflection—in particular an assault on the significance of commodities or devices as such. In the case of Michie &amp; Johnston's book the method is immersion in the details of technological research and productions, in an attempt to get the general reader to penetrate through the veil of technical ignorance to the technologists' own viewpoint. Borgmann's book—the product of many years' scholarship—is in three parts. The first is a brief methodological introduction, concerning theories of technology, and scientific understanding in relation to technology. The second—and most substan tial—part of the book presents a characterisation in depth of the nature of technology, and seeks to develop a critique. The argument revolves around a key notion: that of 'the device paradigm'. Borgmann contrasts the devices of technology with pre- or non technological objects or artefacts—'things', as he terms them—a contrast typified by comparing a modern central heating boiler with an old-fashioned wood stove. What</page><page sequence="2">Book Reviews 277 characterised the latter was its manifold engagement in life: as well as giving heat it provided a social focus for the family, it symbolised the rhythms of the seasons, it demanded special skills and roles. Central heating demands no such labours, no such skills, it is simply there, in the background, serving its specific heat-providing function with no deeper entry in our lives. Borgmann suggests that this duality between thing and device is crucial for understanding not merely the nature of technological products, but also the nature of modern political organisation. In one of the most interesting parts of the book he develops the contention that contemporary liberal democracy can be properly under stood only in terms of the technological underpinnings which facilitate it, and indeed only in terms of the 'device paradigm' itself. The political arena is increasingly seen in terms of governmental machineries which are operated by professional politicians to manage day-to-day affairs, and to handle crises when they happen. The upshot is, inter alia, greater political apathy among the wider citizenry. In the third part of the book, Borgmann proposes that the problems inherent in technological society can be reformed by reference to a conception of the good life which in turn can be characterised through a specific kind of discourse: deictic discourse. This form of understanding, which contrasts with the nomological, or apodeictic discourse of scientific understanding, seeks to understand and value things in their own particularity and complexity, rather than by subsuming them under some generalisation. Compare, for instance, the apodeictic demonstration that burning high sulphur fossil fuels near a cathedral dissolves the stone in its walls, with the deictic appreciation of the value of the preservation of that ancient building, leading us to take as obvious the need to stop burning such fuels in its vicinity (p. 179). It is this kind of understanding from which technological rationality has distanced us, claims Borgmann, by giving us a world dominated by tools, techniques, means, and a political ethos which vaunts a plurality of choices, but which is silent about ends. It will be seen that Borgmann is on the side of the angels. Most people would readily sympathise with his reservations on the rule of technology in our lives, and on the need to restore 'focal' practices—to do more fishing or jogging, or to sit down to festive meals round the family table rather than by the TV. But it's disappointing that, in this rather wordy treatise, we are provided with only a few such illustrative instances of how we might refashion our relationship to technology, and with only a rather indistinct picture of what kind of engagement with life it is that we are striving to restore. Michie &amp; Johnston are also with the angels, to the extent of sharing Borgmann's concern at the perils of technology. But they wish to fight fire with fire, specifically with the new technology of the computer (a form of technology which Borgmann chooses to treat only marginally in his analysis, considering, but resisting, the proposal of commentators like Daniel Bell that it occupies a crucial role in contemporary society). Much of Michie and Johnston's book addresses the practical difficulty that, partly because of its newness, many readers will need to be instructed in the nature of the technology before they can assess its significance. I emphasised the word 'partly', however, because, unlike with other technological devices, the distinction between the appreciation of the surface characteristics of the device on the part of the user, and the appreciation of the underlying complexities of the machinery on the part of the technician or technologist, seems, in the computer, to be radically challenged. Although 'user-friendly', novice-oriented, packages abound, a considerable portion of computer users today have found themselves led to become more and more immersed in the</page><page sequence="3">278 Book Reviews minutiae of the systems they use; more and more to be practitioners, rather than simply consumers, of the technology. The culture of the computer buff is now a familiar enough phenomenon—depress ingly so to those not of its number. One of the most distinctive features of this culture is surely the fact that it combines the technical discipline of the engineer with the creativity of the artist or writer (one can look at a computer program, for example, both as a specification of an electronic system, and as a textual, or conceptual, object). To this extent at least, then, the computer may constitute a new kind of technology: a technology which allows its consumers themselves to be technologists. Michie &amp; Johnston think that the significance of the computer goes much deeper: the key for them is the notion of machine 'intelligence'. To many this latter term smacks of oxymoron. To the writers of this book it suggests a radically new conception of the human mind and of the relation of the human mind to the objects of its creation. Hitherto we have thought of our artefacts as simply tools which dumbly serve our purposes. The computer suggests a quite new picture. For increasingly—it is sugges ted—computers are taking over the cognitive and creative functions of the human mind itself. The result is that computers wil be our partners rather than just our tools: they will forsake the laboratory benches for the podia of scientific congresses; we will fete them in our art galleries; they will be our professional advisors when selling a house or filling a tax return; they will keep us company with diverting conversation and reminiscences during our sunset years. Conceptual purists might be angered by the carefree anthropomorphism here, by the liberal ascription of mentalistic or personal predicates to mechanisms. We can be 'kept company' by a TV or by a good book: no-one would dream of taking the metaphor literally in such cases—why, then, in the case of a robot companion? Can the answer really lie simply in the force of numbers, in the fact that, as our artefacts come to display an ever-increasing range of person-like qualities, so the correctness of taking such attributions literally will increase? I am sceptical about this, and I have a sufficiently deictic conception of the complexity and many-sidedness of human nature to think that, for all the human qualities which may respond to computational representation there will be many—the capacity to feel pain, to be courageous, to love, and so on—which will be forever resistant to the methods of AI and robotics. And in that fact lies a risk that apologists for AI may persuade us to be content with a dangerously impoverished view of ourselves. That said, there is much, I believe, in the AI paradigm which is intellectually fruitful and socially important. Michie and Johnston provide an excellent presentation of the significance of some of the key technical developments in the field—such as expert systems, knowledge engineering, problem-solving, machine learning and game-playing, cognitive modelling and computer art. They also make some observations which will provide food for thought to experts in the field—particularly in relation to the role of computers in the discovery of new scientific knowledge, an area in which Michie has done some important work. Furthermore, they do offer a convincing picture of how AI enriches our conception of our own cognitive capacities, if not of human capacities in the round. It is good to find, in a popular book of this sort, a sufficiently detailed presentation of the technical work in the subject to show the latter's seriousness and complexity. This presentation offers a persuasive argument (where perhaps there can only be persuasion) for the conclusion that, beneath the apparent simplicity of our spontaneous thinking as pre</page><page sequence="4">Book Reviews 279 theoretically conceived, there must be a correspondingly complex underlying realm of representations, structures and transformations, to which current AI simulations offer at least an approximate first guide, if no more.
