<plain_text><page sequence="1">ABSTRACTS OF PAPERS PRESENTED AT THE TWENTY-FIFTH ANNUAL MEETING OF THE SOCIETY OF ARCHITECTURAL HISTORIANS San Francisco, California, January 26-30, 1972 GENERAL SESSION Chairman: H. Allen Brooks, University of Toronto ANTONIO GAUDI AS DRAFTSMAN George R. Collins, Columbia University This is a study of Gaudi's designing procedures as well as an effort to deal with his architectural drawings as artistic works in their own right. The r61le that drawings played in the conceptualizing process of this unusual architect is evaluated, and the numerous other devices that he employed-viz., the varieties of models--are described and illustrated. The drawings themselves, such as have survived, are of wide-ranging media and techniques. They were produced to meet a number of different official and unofficial demands, and they vary greatly in type and character. The major portion of the paper deals with Gaudi's drawing styles in terms of his chronological development. As this involves his relationship to other architects and artists of the Catalan Renaixensa, special emphasis is placed on his early work when he approximated them most closely. It is seen that his drawings fall into fairly distinguishable periods and that each style bears a funda- mental, if not immediately obvious, relation to what he was seek- ing in his building design at the corresponding period in his career. The emergence just after 900oo of his really unique style of both building and drawing involves the matter of his use of other, complementary, devices in design. An effort is made to convey the holistic intent of his vision at that time and to explain the extremes to which he resorted with photography, funicular models, arma- tures, plaster models, and the like to achieve architectural forms, structures, and surfaces that were in complete harmony with natural law. In an analysis of his drawings of this period it can, I think, be seen how his desire to approximate nature in architecture and still avoid the direct copying of nature's forms distinguishes him from the Art Nouveau and led him to the synthesis of a new architecture in the same years in which other new arts like Cubism were appearing on the scene. This paper forms a part of my contribution to the text of a portfolio of Gaudi drawings soon to be published by the Princeton University Press. LATE NINETEENTH-CENTURY PUBLISHED AMERICAN PERSPECTIVE DRAWING Eileen Michels, St. Paul, Minnesota [This paper will appear in full in a forthcoming issue of theJSAH.] THE ANATOMY AND SIGNIFICANCE OF THE LAING STORES BY JAMES BOGARDUS Winston R. Weisman, Pennsylvania State University Although much was known about the Laing Stores, erected be- tween February and May of 1849 by James Bogardus, it was not until February and March of 1971 that a careful disassembly of the buildings revealed the complete anatomical parts of the structures. The dismantling operation made possible by the persistent effort of the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission, The Housing and Development Administration, and undertaken by the Anchor Demolition Corporation was recorded by the speaker with the assistance of a group of Columbia University students in the preservation and restoration program under the direction of Professor James M. Fitch. As a result of this cooperative effort a verbal record now exists replete with measured drawings and several hundred photographs documenting the disassembly from beginning to end. Fortunately the operation proceeded as ex- pected, without serious incident of any kind. The iron elements came apart much as Bogardus predicted they would and are now 221</page><page sequence="2">222 stored nearby awaiting reassembly as part of the Washington Street Urban Renewal Area Plan. However, a number of surprises occurred when it became pos- sible to study the individual units and the cast iron parts that made up the Murray Street and Washington Street fagades. The histori- cal significance of the Stores as a transitional monument was proven when the relationship between older methods of brick partition wall and wood joist supports was seen in connection with the part played by the new cast iron fronts. Because the ornament which once adorned the surface of the Stores had almost entirely disappeared it was not apparent earlier that the composi- tion of the design was much more complex than believed earlier. Thanks to the survival of a few pieces of decoration and to a com- parison with pictures of sister structures, namely the Bogardus Factory and the Milhaud Drug Store, it is possible with a fair degree of accuracy to reconstruct the entire faCade except for the ground-level openings. Equally interesting was the uncovering of the basement which set back the introduction of isolated footings to at least 1849 and probably earlier. And finally the structural relation between wood, iron, and brick was spelled out precisely. Thus until other buildings are dismantled with such care, the Laing Stores are historically unique in what they tell us about nineteenth- century commercial architecture. LE CORBUSIER: THE FORMATIVE YEARS, 1887-1917 Peter Serenyi, Northeastern University "Man walks in a straight line because he has a goal and knows where he is going. . . ." It is with these words that Le Corbusier begins the first chapter of Urbanisme whose meaning becomes more fully intelligible when we consider the layout of his native city. The scheme drawn up by Charles-Henri Junod between 1835 and 1841 for La Chaux-de-Fonds consisted of a rectangular grid system dubbed the "plan ame'ricain" by local historians. In this city domi- nated by straight lines Le Corbusier was conditioned from an early age to value rationality and order in urban design. It was not only the plan of La Chaux-de-Fonds but also its art school that left a permanent imprint on Le Corbusier's mind. Between 1903 and 1914 the Ecole d'Art, headed by Charles L'Eplattenier, was a remarkably progressive school. At the core of his philosophy of art education rested the belief that history and modernity must be seen as a whole through nature. Here the young Le Corbusier first learned to understand in a systematic way the monuments of the past together with the acheivements of the present. And nature, seen through its governing principles and unifying power, was studied with equal intensity. Yet L'Eplattenier was a ddcorateur at heart, and to him the crea- tion of a new style in the visual arts could come about through surface treatment alone without a need to reconsider structure. It is precisely this approach that is at the core ofLe Corbusier's first three houses. For example, in the Villa Fallet of 190o6 Le Corbusier worked primarily as a decorateur rather than as a form giver. In the Villa Stotzer of 190o8 he relied quite literally on L'Eplattenier's own house of I900. However, the villa Le Corbusier designed for his parents in 1912 is of a different order. Of it Le Corbusier had said that it was "white and bare. I had travelled." As a result of his travels in the country of Hoffmann, Perret, and Behrens on the one hand and in the world of the Mediterranean on the other his two later houses built in La Chaux-de-Fonds took a different form. In them the fusion of history and modernity was not only expressed in terms of surface but also in terms of plan and structure. For ex- ample, the plan of the Villa Schwob is in keeping with an ancient Mediterranean tradition going back to the Neolithic Age, as a comparison with the Gigantea on the island of Gozo indicates. Le Corbusier's drawing of the Gigantea was published in his book Une Maison-Un Palais in 1928. Its structure and street fagade, however, were influenced by Perret, especially by the Garage Ponthieu. To attain this level of originality Le Corbusier had to transcend the artistic limitations of his native city. Yet without the tools given by L'Eplattenier he could not have developed so rapidly his rare gift of unifying the past with the present-a hall- mark of his mature architecture. EARLY MENTAL HOSPITALS: THE ARCHITECTURE OF THE WELL-TEMPERED (PSYCHO-SOCIAL) ENVIRONMENT Edward Teitelman, M.D., University of Pennsylvania The first mental hospital in the modern sense was established by English Quakers in York in 1792. This provided the pattern for the Asylum for Persons Deprived of the Use of Their Reason (now Friends Hospital, Philadelphia) established in 1813, and several other U. S. hospitals which followed in New York, Boston, and Hartford in the next decades. Reyner Banham's recent (1969) book, The Architecture of the Well-tempered Environment, provides an interesting manner of de- veloping certain aspects of architectural history-in terms of en- vironmental systems versus style and architect. Although not directly applicable to early mental hospitals whose mechanical systems were relatively primitive, Banham does provide a basis for consideration of the therapeutic environmental "system" which was the main method of treatment of these hospitals, a "system" around which their architectural form developed. The main contribution of the Friends to the care of the mentally ill lay in development of Moral Treatment-a total psycho-social approach in which the sick were accepted into a large and under- standing "family" in pleasant surroundings. Control of behavior and reason were "anticipated with loving care" and patients gained increasingly "normal" r61es in the operation and function of these small asylums as they returned to health. The results were good, especially considering the lack of any useful drug therapy and the pragmatic nature of the development of the treatment program. This paper will trace the adaptation of then-contemporary building models to the therapeutic program, especially at York and Philadelphia. As both structures are relatively intact, although much added to, a sense of the total environment can be repro- duced. Concern for the sensibilities of patients in design of such features as window sash with no visible bars will be illustrated, and the integration of plan and program will be discussed.</page><page sequence="3">223 ARCHITECTURE IN THE PACIFIC NORTHWEST Chairman: Marion Dean Ross, University of Oregon W. W. PIPER: ACADEMY ARCHITECTURE IN OREGON IN THE 1870s Elisabeth Walton, Oregon State Highway Commission [This paper will appear in full in a forthcoming issue of theJSAH.] TYPES OF DOMESTIC ARCHITECTURE IN JACKSONVILLE, OREGON Christopher Owens, The George Washington University / Smithsonian Institution Program in American Studies Although Jacksonville, Oregon, was founded because gold was discovered in southern Oregon in 1851, the town's character de- veloped with the agricultural economy of the Rouge River Valley. In 1884, the railroad bypassed the town, and its economy substan- tially declined from that date onward. The growth and decline of the town can be traced in its architecture. The earliest houses in Jacksonville were of rough-framed or boxed construction. Soon, however, buildings in identifiable "styles" appeared. The first were belated Classical Revival; sur- viving examples generally date from the early i86os, but several major buildings in the style had been built before 1855. By 1858, the Gothic Cottage Style was influencing some Classi- cal Revival buildings. The influence of the newer style is seen in the treatment of certain details, particularly porches and roofs. After 1865, more correctly designed Gothic cottages appear, but even they show a simplification from pattern-book models. The typical Jacksonville Gothic cottage is identifiable by its steeply pitched roof and lattice-columned porch. The Italianate Villa Style was used for a few larger houses. The earliest example is in the arcaded mode; later houses appear in the bracketed version. This style was never as popular as the Gothic cottage; its most appropriate use in a town with small buildings was for arcaded store fagades. Throughout Jacksonville's history, buildings in traditional American building patterns were built: typical midwestern farm houses, "salt-boxes," and simple end-gabled houses. By the mid-i88os, Jacksonville was defensive about its position as Southern Oregon's most important city. As late as 1891, how- ever, a few houses were built in a "prodigy style" and others were remodelled to conform with the then-current Queen Anne models. But Jacksonville and Victorian architecture were both on the wane. ELLSWORTH STOREY OF SEATTLE: PROGENITOR OF A REGIONAL DOMESTIC STYLE Grant Hildebrand, University of Washington Of a number of architects of note at work in Seattle in the first third of the century, Ellsworth Storey was the most original and is most closely associated with the origins of a regional residential style. His importance rests on a small number of buildings, ac- companied by no theoretical writings whatever. He was a native Chicagoan, born there in 1879 during the rebuilding period after the great fire. He grew up in Chicago, where he saw Sullivan's buildings, the world's Columbian Expo- sition of 1893, and the early work of Wright. In 1898, he entered the University of Illinois, and graduated in 1903. His college career was interrupted by a Grand Tour of Europe in which he was intrigued not by the major monuments but by the vernacular domestic work of Switzerland and Austria. In 1903 Storey went to Seattle, where he immediately bought a piece of property near Lake Washington on which he built a house for himself and his bride, and an adjoining house for his parents. These buildings mark the beginning of his independent practice. His early work centered on the neighborhood area known as Denny Blaine, much as Wright found a local clientele in Oak Park. Storey appears especially to have drawn his clients from the congregation of the Church of the Epiphany, for whom he did the church building in 90o8-1gog. Representative of his work of this early period are the "Cottages" of 1912, a group of very low- cost cottages on a sloping, view-oriented terrain; the Denny Blaine bus shelter of 1906; and a residence at 23o6 Thirty-fourth South. Storey's work differed from the Eastern shingle style in relying less on simple planes and sweeps of flowing roof, more on small simple details. His roof forms, and occasionally his massings, seem related to the work of Greene and Greene, but Storey made no attempt to develop an intricately crafted, and therefore expensive, style; his works were far simpler, more modest. He used wood to an appropriately extensive degree in a timber-rich area, and his use of it was free of historicism (if we except a possible debt to Greene and Greene and to those Alpine chalets which Storey had seen in his youth). The simple, modest originality of his work with its reliance on local material, is certainly the explanation for his pervasive influence in Seattle. Storey's significant influence on Seattle architecture is clearly to be seen in current small-scale work in the city, for example in the work of Gene Zema or Ralph Anderson. One final point, however, must be made regarding that influence. It came about not because of a wide publicity or an impressive and powerful patronage, but rested instead on the intrinsic appropriateness and apparent right-ness of the few but important works he produced. THE CROSS-AXIAL HOUSES OF SAMUEL MACLURE Leonard K. Eaton, University of Michigan Samuel Maclure (1860-1929) was an architect who practiced with immense success, largely in the city of Victoria. In his best work he is comparable in quality to his West Coast contemporaries Bernard Maybeck and the brothers Greene. While Maclure owed much to the shingle style architects of the eastern United States, especially Wilson Eyre, the circumstances of his practice forced him to a unique expression in wood. Essentially an arts and crafts designer, he probably owed as much to Richard Norman Shaw and Voysey as he did to Eyre. The purpose of this paper is to trace his distinctive development of the cross-axial plan, a scheme</page><page sequence="4">224 which is found in several of the shingle style architects and also in the early work of Frank Lloyd Wright. Maclure was primarily a domestic architect and particular attention will be given to his Munn house of 1899, Shallcross house of 1907, and Beattie house of 1920. The problems of circulation and program in these dwell- ings will be analyzed, and an attempt at an evaluation of Maclure's contribution to the architecture of his period will be made. ALVAR AALTO AT MOUNT ANGEL ABBEY Barnabas Reasoner, O.S.B., Mount Angel Abbey The library building at the Benedictine Abbey of Mount Angel, Oregon, was designed by Alvar Aalto. Aalto's first response to a letter from the monks came in May 1963. The building was com- pleted and dedicated in May 1970. The unusual beauty of the site, said to be one of the most magnificent in the world, suggested that special consideration be given to the design and prompted the monks of Mt. Angel Abbey to seek an architect of distinction. With this condition in mind the monks were fortunate in being able to interest the great Finnish architect in doing their building. The building was designed to serve an academic community of around 500. It was to house 300,000 volumes, and it was to pro- vide special facilities: archives, map room, electronics control center, bindery, and staff area. It was particularly desired that the library have about it an alert atmosphere, but at the same time be a tranquil place. It was to be economical of manpower with a centralized control enabling one staff member to supervise the operation and serve the needs of the library patron. TOWARDS A REDEFINITION OF PRESERVATION Chairman: Richard C. Peters, University of California, Berkeley SAVE BUILDINGS: FOR WHOM AND FOR WHAT Stephen Tobriner, University of California, Berkeley Among architects and architectural historians there is a growing interest in preserving old buildings of aesthetic or historical im- portance which otherwise might perish in urban redevelopment programs. While the aesthetic values of preservation are often carefully considered, the economic and social ramifications of preservation programs are sometimes overlooked. My paper in- vestigates one subcategory of preservation, the rehabilitation of old buildings, in a particular context, redevelopment area 2 of San Francisco's Western Addition. My object was simply to sur- vey large numbers of property owners, community organization members, and government officials in order to judge the workings and effects of rehabilitation. Rehabilitation is defined (by the AIA Handbook of Professional Practice) as "utilizing the building or facility for an extended useful life with the minimum alteration of original construction." There- fore, rehabilitation is a method of preserving as much of the existing buildings as possible, and does not necessarily imply his- torical restoration. Rehabilitation programs are slowly being de- veloped on the West Coast as alternatives to catastrophic demoli- tion and clearance which so often characterize urban redevelop- ment projects. The Western Addition Rehabilitation Office of the San Francisco Redevelopment Agency, with a staff of eight, and a federal loan to homeowners as its major tool, helps property owners rehabilitate their buildings within the redevelopment area. Although the Rehabilitation Office is doing an excellent job, the problems and inconsistencies of rehabilitation in the Western Ad- dition are many; these are some of the more pronounced: First, some workers within the Agency itself allege that there has been a long-standing bias against rehabilitation which hampered the work of the Rehabilitation Office. Second, perhaps due to the antireha- bilitation bias, many people who wanted to rehabilitate their homes were unable to do so, according to some, because of fallacious sur- veys taken by the Agency. Third, although the Agency officially backs rehabilitation it never bothered to survey the population of the redevelopment area as to whether they wanted to live in reha- bilitated housing or project housing. Fourth, although rehabilita- tion is a valuable alternative for property owners (ten percent of the redevelopment area population) it doesn't help tenants who are often evicted after rehabilitation because the landlords' costs are so high. Fifth, property owners are given the choice of either rehabilitating their property or vacating it, a choice that many residents feel is unfair. Many feel that the cost of rehabilitation is very high, and resent this added burden. Sixth, black radicals saw rehabilitation as a means of helping the community help itself without evictions or rent increases. But in fact rehabilitation pro- grams are being used by well-off people to buy into now-stylish old buildings and restore them, thereby raising land prices and rents. The problems of rehabilitation and preservation in general go far beyond single buildings and encompass whole communities; as architectural historians we should be aware of these problems when we discuss the historical and aesthetic rationale behind pre- serving old buildings. INSTANT HISTORY-THE INVENTION OF A TRADITION David Gebhard, University of California, Santa Barbara Preservation, as generally practiced in the United States, has con- sisted of embalming a single fragment or a group of fragments of the past. In a few rare instances, particularly on the Eastern Sea- board, the basic continuance of all or part of a single community has been retained-normally as a period piece or one specific moment in history. Such traditional goals of preservation are sig- nificant and indeed must be continued. But in the twentieth cen- tury and particularly in California a new and radically different mode of historic preservation has slowly been coming into exist-</page><page sequence="5">225 ence. This new instant history and accordingly instant preservation is coming to play an increasingly important r6le in architectural design and in the planning processes of many West Coast com- munities. In California the examples which inevitably come to mind are Monterey, Ojai, Rancho Sante Fe, Palos Verdes, and, above all, Santa Barbara. In each of these communities, the task has been to create a history (or elaborate on a history) where the historic relics of the past never existed at all, or, if they did, they were visually insignificant. This has entailed an arbitrary selection of one moment in history, in each of these communities, the supposed (and sometimes mythical) Spanish Colonial past. Those fragments of other moments of the past which by chance may have survived in these communities must be remolded into the one chosen historical episode, be moved away, hidden, or, as a last resort, destroyed. The new instant history means that at the stroke of a wand, the immediate past can become history and that which is created now and in the future will be both of the present and of the past. The question of which is genuine (i.e., actually a product of the distant past) and that which is not, becomes a meaningless question, for everything then becomes a thing of the moment which refers directly and pointedly to the past. A strong argument can be made that the instant historic cities of our century are in the long run far more relevant to the present and to the future than those few specific fragments of buildings which are being preserved as architectural period pieces. RESTORATION FOR USE Elisabeth K. Thompson, Architectural Record Many old buildings have significance in the history of a city and in the quality of its environment which are neither historic nor architectural monuments in any sense of the terms. Restored and given a useful function, their scale and character become positive urban values. In the West there are numerous examples of such buildings, often well proportioned and handsome but intended for some such mundane original use as a warehouse, a bakery, a commercial building, a carriage house. Their simple lines and good materials give them distinction quite beyond the original function of the building. Such buildings deserve to contribute to other periods than their initial one. The principal problem in preserving such buildings-represent- ative of the "stuff of life" to a far greater degree than the actual historic or architectural monument, important though these are in their own way-is in finding a valid use for them which will restore not only their integrity as buildings but their r6les in the community. Buildings preserved as museums are familiar enough. The building that becomes a part of the community in a conti- nuity of existence has reality. In San Francisco alone, examples abound: the Ice House, the Folger Building,Jackson Place, andJackson Square. Sacramento is reviving its riverfront and restoring some of its old buildings to serve as real parts of the area. Seattle's Pike Place Market will continue to provide fresh produce and varied eating in an atmos- phere of picturesqueness that was almost lost, and that once was familiar in many cities in the West, but now has all but disap- peared. The Coronado Hotel, despite some unfortunate changes, retains its grand dining room, its quaint court and balconies, and continues a long tradition, now dying out, of such resort hotels. Individual action is often the spur to reuse of an old building. Occasionally an organization is the agent. But sometimes legisla- tion is an aid in delaying demolition of a worthy building until a buyer can be found or until funds can be obtained to buy and restore it. HOW MUCH IS A MONUMENT WORTH? Charles W. Moore, Yale University In a cram course for the architectural state board exams in an eastern state, aspirants are urged to get their caricature straight, to stand a better chance of passing the site planning examination: "Remember, architects love trees, are ambivalent about people, and hate cars." Curiously missing is their attitude toward build- ings, especially buildings left over from the past. This talk is meant to explore what some legitimate attitudes might be, where the convenient presumptions diverge from reality, and what, if any- thing, might be done about it. The attitude toward old buildings, for instance, which matches enlightened architectural doctrine of the decades just behind us, favors prolonging their usefulness, refitting them for functions already required or which can plausibly be devised, so as to retain a visible connection with a living past. Enough instances of this crea- tive revisionism can be found annually in America's older cities to make a handsome if not fat portfolio. But far more numerous are the instances, especially in newer cities, where the scale of the requirements and the point of view and the technology have changed so quickly in the recent past that the chief discernible value of old buildings, if they have any, is as immovable talismans, mute spokesmen of the already remote world of, say, forty years ago. Now it is the problem of these talismans that they keep getting in the way; they cannot conveniently be boxed up, like the sacred Shinto objects at Ise, or kept in attics and warehouses and the living rooms of the innocent until they accumulate the status of antiquity, like normal small movable objects. And ruins, at least at home, make many Americans very uneasy. Arguments for old buildings' usefulness often fail to hold up, and sentiments about their irreplaceability are given the lie by Disneyland and the great fake "Spanish" cities like Santa Barbara. Technically, we're easily up to replicating an adobe hacienda, and we could probably find a better site than the parking lots most old adobes in the West seem to find themselves marooned in. This discussion will try to sort out the alternative possibilities which lie between beneficial occupancy and obliteration with suitable photographic documentation.</page><page sequence="6">226 ASPECTS OF LANDSCAPE ARCHITECTURE Chairman: F. Hamilton Hazlehurst, Vanderbilt University PIETRO CRESCENZI AND THE ITALIAN RENAISSANCE GARDEN Margaretta Jean Darnall, University of California, Berkeley The theoreticians who have influenced the art of garden design have traditionally been in two categories-the artistic or architec- tural writers and the scientific or agricultural writers. All too frequently, the contribution of the scientific writer to design theory is overlooked. Pietro Crescenzi falls into the category of the agricultural writ- ers. He was born in Bologna in 1230 and was trained as a lawyer. Because of his Ghibelline background, he spent most of his life in exile as counsel to various kings including those of southern Italy where he is certain to have familiarized himself with their lavish gardens-a reflection of earlier Roman and Moorish ones. When in 1299 Crescenzi returned to Bologna, he began his famous treatise, Oi RuraltAccommiodation. Within this work, made public in 1305, one entire book was devoted to ornamental gardens. In tiis section he discusses the small-scale garden as well as the plan- ning of large gardens for kings and other wealthy men. Here, he recommends that the house face south with the main gardens to the north. As to the general organization, he says that the house should have a level parterre on the north, and beyond the parterre should be a dense wood well stocked with animals. The arrange- ment should, of course, be symmetrical, and the kitchen gardens should be off to one side. Oni Rulral Accomniodation was first trans- lated into Italian and published in Florence in 1478, and it is after this date that Crescenzi's ideas became most evident in the planning of villa gardens. It should further be noted that while Alberti approached the subject of garden design from the viewpoint of the artist-architect in his Ten Books on Architecture, he in no way contradicts Cres- cenzi's recommendations. Pietro Crescenzi is a figure who is important to the history of the theory of garden design on several accounts. 'His treatise was the only agricultural work of any import produced during the Middle Ages. The work spans the gap between the Roman agriculturists and those of the Renaissance. It also serves to link the Roman gardens, the mediaeval Moorish gardens of southern Italy and Sicily, and the Renaissance villa gardens as they emerged in the central Italian hills in the fifteenth century. One must remember that the early villa was the center of a working farm and that Crescenzi's work was unrivalled as an agricultural guide until the sixteenth century. The book devoted to ornamental gardens set forth commonsense principles of villa layout based on the premises of the Romans and tempered by experience in southern Italy. These ideas were followed with slight variations by garden design- ers throughout the Renaissance. A CIRCUS, A WILD MAN, AND A DRAGON: THE ICONOGRAPHY OF THE VILLA MATTEI GARDENS Elisabeth MacDougall, Boston University THE MOLLET FAMILY AND THE DEVELOPMENT &amp; DISSEMINATION OF THE FRENCH BAROQUE GARDEN Richard O. Swain, Kenyon College French Renaissance gardens of the first half of the sixteenth cen- tury were larger in size but not much grander in scale than were mediaeval walled gardens. The lines of the still quasi-defensive walls of the chateaux determined the garden enclosures, and with- in these lines small geometrical patterns were symmetrically ar- ranged side-by-side in squares with no design relationship to each other. Variety and alternation in the many small squares making up the parterre were more important than elegance or continuity. In about I58o, however, the French architect and engraver Etienne Du Perac returned from Italy where he had studied closely the greater monumentality and elaborateness of the Italian terraced garden. Together with the gardeners Jacques Mollet and his son Claude I, Du P6rac brought about a revoltution in French garden design that basically involved: (I) the unification of all elements in a large garden plan into a single comprehensive de- sign; and (2) the use of highly intricate arabesque patterns as the decorative basis of this design. Working in this style, four generations of the Mollet family were largely responsible for the development and dissemination of this phase in the history of the French formal garden. (An im- portant exception was Marie de' Medici's landscape architect Jacques Boyceau.) As garden designer and horticulturalist to the French kings Henri IV and Louis XIII, Claude I Mollet planned the first monumental gardens at Fontainebleau, St. Germain-en- Laye, the Tuileries, and elsewhere. In addition, his important treatise Le The'dtre des plans et du jardinage of i652 was one of the most complete summaries to date of current horticultural and garden-design practice and went into five editions in twenty-five years. Claude I's son Andr6 became the great disseminator of the Mollet garden style. Between 1635 and his death in the Great London Plague of 1665, he designed major royal gardens for Frederick Henry of Orange, Henrietta Maria of England, Chris- tina of Sweden, and Charles II of England. His handsome and influential folio of his garden designs published in Stockholm in 1651 was entitled Lejardin de Plaisir, and Der Lust Garten and The Garden of Pleasure in subsequent translations. With the appearance of the considerably more complex, more illusionistic, more "Baroque" French garden of the Mollet- trained Andr..Le Nostre at Vaux-le-Vicomte in the 1650s, the Mollet garden quickly became outmoded, but it is clear that most of Le Nostre's basic ideas for the Louis XIV garden can be traced back to the discoveries and developments of the Mollet family. ANDRt LE NOSTRE AND OPTICAL ILLUSION F. Hamilton Hazlehurst, Vanderbilt University One of the most fascinating aspects of the landscape architecture ofAndr6 Le Nostre was his use of optical illusion as an enlivening</page><page sequence="7">227 agent in the garden. This was probably the direct outgrowth of his study ofPtreJean-FranFois Niceron's La Perspective curieuse, pub- lished in Paris in 1638. This study, together with similar treatises on optics appearing in the important formative years of Le Nostre's development, surely left their mark upon him, for the methods of creating optical illusions, so carefully described in these treatises, were soon applied to the sphere of the garden. For some curious reason, this aspect of Le Nostre's work has been largely overlooked by succeeding generations of scholars and practitioners of landscape design. And it is indeed lamentable, for the optical tricks which Le Nostre often introduces in his designs constitute the pleasing leaven of his otherwise often coldly formal composition. The "discovery" of these visual illusions necessarily requires on-the-site visits, for no plan can possibly do justice to the ever-changing perspectives nor reveal the many hidden "sur- prises" in a garden's design. In like manner, the compositions themselves could not have been executed without a careful pre- liminary site study on the part of the landscape architect himself. Thus, Le Nostre, perforce, had to visit, and closely examine and measure the terrain before addressing himself to the drawing board. And it is doubtful that one journey to the site was ever sufficient, for constant adjustments and readjustments were neces- sary in order to achieve a desired visual effect. This notion is borne out in the frequent trips of the landscape architect late in life to the Chateau de Pontchartrain. Though optical subtleties are very much present in all of Le Nostre's undertakings-from his first acknowledged masterpiece, Vaux-le-Vicomte, to his late involvement at Pontchartrain-it is at Chantilly and Saint-Germain-en-Laye that several of the most intriguing examples of his optical gymnastics are found. At Chantilly, Le Nostre gives full reign to visual dynamics in the design of the avenue of approach which has as its focal point not the customary chateau but the equestrian statue of the Conn6table de Montmorency. At Saint-Germain, the landscape architect's wizardry is seen in the creation of the Grande terrasse which in its mammoth scale, visual balance of parts, and ordered formality is the very quintessence of the French Baroque quest for and ap- preciation of rational form. FINE ART AND THE VICTORIAN GARDEN LANDSCAPE John Freeman, University of Victoria No society in history, with the possible exception of our own, was so devoted to fine arts as the Victorian. Armed with the mentality of archaeology, the memory of art history, and the eye of art appreciation, its goal was to make the world "artistic" through the transformation of artifacts into art. Victorians would be aston- ished, therefore, by twentieth-century opinions about themselves. The following may be typical: "Throughout the nineteenth cen- tury and the beginning of the twentieth, there is not much land- scape design, other than its social and horticultural aspects, that can detain us to enjoy it as fine art" (G. A. Jellicoe, "Landscape from Art," Studies, 1966). Inasmuch as Mr.Jellicoe is likewise devoted to fine art and believes that the vitality of landscape design is de- pendant upon "inspiration... from sister arts" (e.g., Nicholson, Hepworth, and Klee), the following question may be not alto- gether untimely: Why did so great a dedication to fine art garden landscapes by Victorians produce so little of enduring aesthetic value? There are a number of possible theories, among them the fol- lowing: (I) if the principle of fine art is a vital one, Victorians merely erred in choosing improper models and imitating surface effects rather than distilling essences; (2) if the principle of fine art is a pernicious one, Victorians thwarted their own ambitions; (3) if landscape is not a major art form in Western civilization, Victorians were engaged in a futile exercise; (4) if landscape is a major art form in Western civilization, Victorians merely erred in losing contact with the mainstream of the tradition. This paper explores these theories and concludes that landscape, although of recent origin in Western civilization and consisting of two idioms differing essentially in their ideology, is a major art form. The Victorian garden landscape tradition did not thrive because of the Picturesque, the Gardenesque, Arts &amp; Crafts ma- terialism, or Beaux Arts formalism, but in spite of them. From the eighteenth-century Whig Eden to the early nineteenth-century Garden City of the Dead, from the mid-century Urban Pleasure Ground to the late nineteenth-century Garden City of the Living there is an unbroken line of direct contact and development. MEDIAEVAL ARCHITECTURE Chairman: Richard King, Rutgers University THE NAVE OF JUMIEGES, AN ASSESSMENT Jean Bony, University of California at Berkeley [This paper will appear in full in a forthcoming issue of theJSAH.] DECORATED AND PERPENDICULAR: A RECONSIDERATION Richard Morris, University of Victoria In the nineteenth century, Decorated and Perpendicular were re- garded as consecutive styles, but more recent research has shown that mature Decorated and early Perpendicular are actually con- temporary. At the same time, early Perpendicular has generally been accepted as the style of London and the Court, whereas Decorated is thought of as a style rooted in the provinces. Yet England was a compact and relatively centralized country in the period ca. 128o-1350, and there is really no historical or social basis for this interpretation of Decorated. In fact, it can be shown that Decorated works are as much a part of the Court style as Perpendicular ones. For example, a stylistic comparison of Wells Cathedral chapter house with St. Stephen's Chapel at Westminster suggests that both are the work of the royal master mason Michael of Canterbury, whose works are generally thought to exhibit a repugnance to florid detail. If this attribution is correct, such features of the chapter house as ornate vault patterns and ballflower ornament,</page><page sequence="8">228 both of which are always considered to be essentially provincial, should be reassigned to the Court. In the same way, it can be shown that the notable royal master mason in this period William Ramsey, who is generally accepted as the first exponent of Perpendicular style, also makes extensive use of Decorated features such as flowing tracery. Again, the Decorated forms in Peter Parlor's work in the choir of Prague Cathedral suggest that Decorated was the Court style in England in the mid-fourteenth century. It is difficult to explain why else the German Emperor would wish to employ features from "provin- cial" buildings like York, Ely, Wells, and Bristol in such a promi- nent position in his capital city. Again, this to be the explanation for the use of Decorated tracery and other English characteristics in the Duke of Berry's early Flamboyant chapel at Riom. In other words, contemporaries in the fourteenth century did not think in terms of Decorated and Perpendicular, because they were one and the same thing-the Court style of England. LAON CATHEDRAL: THE SECOND CAMPAIGN OF CONSTRUCTION Richard King, Douglass College, Rutgers University It is likely that the famous five-towered transept design of Laon Cathedral dates, not from the beginning of construction (about I160), but only from the commencement of the second campaign, begun about 170. During the first campaign the choir and eastern sides of the transept arms were erected, and it is apparent from the continuation of the first-campaign masonry of the side aisle into the adjacent transept end bay of the south arm that during the first campaign the transept fagade bays were planned fairly close to, if not precisely, the way they were carried out during the second campaign. On the other hand, the addition of massive buttresses on the exterior of the east side of each transept, as witnessed by the discontinuities between these buttresses and the corresponding side aisle piers and tribune window frames, indicates that the twin transept fagade towers were not foreseen during the first campaign, but were planned only at the beginning of the second, at which time the necessary buttresses were put in place. In addition, it appears that the Norman-style open crossing tower was conceived at the same time, and that it, too, was not part of the original first-campaign scheme. The evidence lies in the two eastern crossing piers, both of which were carried as high as the main vault springings during the first campaign. In each pier, the course of stone between the adjacent triumphal arch capitals is of a variety of limestone more similar to the soft, fine-grained capital stone than to the harder, coarser type of stone used in all other pier courses; in the southeast pier the fragility of the course in question is evidenced by fissures. These observations suggest that during the first campaign the shafts of the inner face of the two crossing piers were topped by capitals-three in each pier-at the level of the triumphal arch capitals; if this were the case it would indicate the intention to construct, at the height of the adjacent choir vault, a crossing vault, the ribs and formerets of which would have been supported by the hypothetical capitals. Presumably, at the outset of the second campaign the builders changed their minds and decided to construct an open crossing tower; the capitals of the three central shafts would have been simply carved away and the stone reshaped as sections of the pier shafts. Whether or not the builders of the initial campaign intended a closed crossing tower above the vault remains problematic. However, the fact that prior to the nineteenth-century restoration the choir triumphal arch had only a single row of voussoirs- scarcely enough to buttress a tower-seems to preclude the possi- bility of a crossing tower of any sort planned in the first campaign. If the above hypotheses are correct, then the first-campaign transept design would have been nearly identical to that of Arras Cathedral, also begun about 116o, which had a rectangular plan, aisled transept, with no towers. As a corollary the origin of the five-towered transept scheme at Chartres Cathedral (begun in 1196, where, in the reverse of Laon Cathedral, an open crossing tower was originally planned, but never carried out), usually attributed to the initial design of Laon Cathedral, dating about 116o, must be seen as conceived at the outset of the second cam- paign-about I Io70-somewhat closer in time to the commence- ment of Chartres Cathedral. SONDAGES AT SOISSONS Carl F. Barnes, Jr., Oakland University In 1970 as a Fellow of the American Council of Learned Societies I directed two sondages in the Cathedral of Soissons, the first re- corded subterranean investigations made in that building, the dis- covery of a Romanesque capital of ca. 1I40 by Emile Brunet in 1924 being accidental to his examination of the foundations of the nave main arcade piers following World War I (see Art Bulletin, 51 [1969], 161-163). The first sondage was made in the bay immediately northeast of the northeast crossing pier, its purpose being to locate the founda- tions of the eastern periphery of a circular north arm of the late twelfth-century choir. Construction of a tower of unspecified lo- cation is documented in a cathedral text of II58. Cut into the upper surface of this blocaille were depressions for the emplace- ments of footings of two sets of periphery responds of the twelfth- century north arm. Painted fragments of the superstructure of this arm were found embedded in one of these depressions, the other having been disfigured by the cutting of a later (seventeenth- century?) grave. There can be no doubt that a north arm was built at Soissons in the twelfth century (see JSAH, 28 [1969], 9-25). The second sondage consisted of an east-west trench cut on axis with the choir, beginning at the foot of the platform covering the bishops' crypt (built in 1770 when the present choir pavement was laid) and running westward. In this trench were found four tombs, three of which had been unopened but which were void of any identifiable or datable artifacts. The external surface of a hitherto unknown westward extension of the bishops' crypt was likewise found. At a depth of I.07 m. lower than the upper surface of the blocaille in the north arm a blocaille identical to the latter was discovered. However, in this instance the sondage revealed the eastern edge of this mass which was carefully faced with ashlar. Because the trench ran east-west and the edge of this blocaille north-south it was impossible to unearth more than 5 m. of its eastern surface without the danger of a cave-in. However, what could be seen appears to be flat rather than rounded or curved. Only more extensive excavation will clarify this point beyond doubt. On the basis of these limited sondages, it appears that the fol- lowing speculation concerning the twelfth-century choir of Sois- sons is in order: it may have had a flat chevet and its choir may</page><page sequence="9">229 have been flanked on the north by a tower set into the angle formed by the meeting of the choir and the north arm. Supposing a comparable arrangement on the south-which would account for the placement of the south-arm chapel off any major axis in the building-this choir must have resembled that of the many smaller twelfth-century churches in the Laonnais and Soissonnais. But Soissons was not a small church such as Morienval. Despite the towers being on the west side of the transept at Saint-Martin at Laon, one might suspect a link with that Premonstratensian church. Perhaps it is more than coincidence that the twelfth- century choir of Soissons was built under Bishop Josselin de Vierzy (d. II52) who sponsored five Premonstratensian foundations in his diocese. THE CAROLINGIAN CRYPT AND MEROVINGIAN TOMB OF ST. LIGER Gary Hess, Columbia University In 1875, the late Gothic abbey church of St. L6ger in Saint Maixent-les-Ecoles (Deux-S6vres), about fifty kilometers south- west of Poitiers, was judged structurally unsound, deconsecrated, and scheduled for demolition. A sondage made through the apse floor by a local archivist during the demolition of the superstruc- ture revealed a large, barrel-vaulted "hall crypt," sealed and for- gotten since the late seventeenth or early eighteenth century. The crypt was labelled "Romanesque" by its discoverer and dated to the eleventh century, sometime before the fire of o082 which destroyed the upper church. This date persisted throughout the restorations effected between 1884 and 1886. While these restorations were in progress, an alternative dating was proposed. It was suggested that the existing crypt dates not from the eleventh but from the seventh century, and is not Romanesque but Merovingian. It was claimed that the crypt is a surviving element of the original church of St. L6ger, built to house the bones of the martyred bishop of Autun, executed by Ebroin in 678 or 679. A date at the end of the seventh century, based on an analysis of the textual evidence and on certain clearly pre-Romanesque aspects of the structure, quickly became the accepted one for this monument, and has been maintained to the present day. After my own investigations in the spring and summer of 1971, which included a series of sondages within and above the crypt, and a reexamination of the relevant texts, I found neither the Romanesque nor the Merovingian date acceptable. Neither is realistic given the plan, style, and structural details of the building; nor can either be justified on the basis of the existing textual evidence. The crypt of St. L6ger can be best understood if dated to the reconstruction of the monastery of St. Maixent, of which the Church of St. L6ger was a part, undertaken at the very end of the ninth or at the very beginning of the tenth century. The plan, the type of masonry employed, the style of the supports, and the impost moldings all fit comfortably within a Carolingian context. The masonry was destroyed, "totally" according to the charters, by the Vikings in 864-865. The original, rather modest crypt of St. L6ger existed essentially on the site of the present apse. When the church above was rebuilt, this small dual-entrance crypt was expanded to the west by the addition of the vaulted hall. The idea of dual entrances was maintained but now opened further to the west. The new much enlarged crypt was designed to accommodate the two important relics belonging to the monastery, the remains of St. L6ger and St. Maixent. These relics were removed to safety before the Viking incursions. The crypt can be dated, therefore, to the period between 898, the restoration of the abbots, and 923, the return of the relics. Between this major reconstruction of the crypt and the late seventeenth or early eighteenth century when it was sealed, the crypt underwent at least two significant restorations, particularly in the area of the entranceways and the apse, which was revaulted. In the course of these same investigations, the remains of a tomb and an early apse were found directly above the apse of the crypt. The tomb consists of a large trapezoidal sarcophagus, of which only the bottom slab survives, topped by a finely finished, gently gabled lid of a distinctly Merovingian type. It originally stood within a caveau in the center of the apse whose masonry had been incorporated into a later building campaign. This apse can be re- constructed as having had a semicircular interior and a rectilinear exterior. That these are the remains of the original tomb of St. L6ger, making a confessio of the Merovingian crypt, is a tempting hypothesis. It finds support in the style of the tomb, in its location, and in certain documents which strongly suggest that the relic was originally housed in the upper altar. But more must be learned about the stratification of the upper churchbefore any conclusions may be drawn as to its date. ARCHAEOLOGICAL METHOD: THE PRE-ROMANESQUE "AMBULATORY" OF CHARTRES CATHEDRAL Jan van der Meulen, Pennsylvania State University The design of the high-Gothic cathedral of Chartres is conditioned largely by the retention of the crypt of the early-Romanesque building. The long "galleries" of the extant crypt, its "ambula- tory" and three-deep radial chapels were simply enveloped by "Gothic" masonry. The eastern parts of this crypt are in their turn traditionally represented as enveloping still earlier masonry com- prising a rudimentary ambulatory (within the limits of the present apse) and diverse masonry west of this. The system of five preserved supports in the crypt, supposedly belonging to the "ninth-century" apse (today called the caveau Saint-Lubin) are built onto the eastern face of Gallo-Roman ma- sonry; the supposed eastern periphery of this inner room has five niches, traditionally interpreted as windows which have been closed by the inner wall of the early-Romanesque crypt "ambu- latory." It can be shown that the five supports in the caveau Saint-Lubin, together with the three-deep radial chapels which were later in- corporated into the early-Romanesque crypt, in fact belong to an earlier, unvaulted confessio constructed to the east of the original basilica. The present eastern peripheral wall of the caveau Saint- Lubin is the rising foundation wall of the early-Romanesque apse arcade, which thus separated the inner and outer parts of the original confessio at the time of its conversion into a crypt (to- gether with the side aisles of the original basilica). In summary: observations on the accessible parts of the building -without excavation or scaffolding-suffice to indicate that in 1020 the original basilica and a confessio built to the east of it were</page><page sequence="10">230 partly filled in and converted to the unified subterranean sanctuary of the new cathedral. The form of the high-Gothic cathedral is indeed directly con- ditioned by pre-Romanesque forms-but not in terms of the development of the traditionally postulated "rudimentary ambu- latory" of the caveau Saint-Lubin. MODERNE ARCHITECTURE Chairman: David S. Gebhard, University of California, Santa Barbara EUROPE AND THE AMERICAN MODERNE-1930s Ludwig Glaeser, Museum of Modern Art CHICAGO'S "CENTURY OF PROGRESS" EXPOSITION: THE MODERNE AS DEMOCRATIC, POPULAR CULTURE Forrest F. Lisle, Jr., University of Florida Contrary to most historical and critical assessments of American architecture of the 1930s, Moderne architecture can be shown to have been the logical and thus, perhaps, "proper" stylistic choice, for America to have made in view of the nation's institutions, traditions, and ideals. Using Chicago's 1933-1934 "Century of Progress" Exposition as the touchstone, it is demonstrable that basic to the development and acceptance of the Moderne was the existence of, and regard for, democratic, egalitarian, middle-class, commercial, free-enterprise, popular culture values and compre- hensions. Based on its ornament and silhouette, the "Century of Progress" is correctly identified, though frequently pejoratively, as Moderne (or modernistic). Legitimately it bears many of the more obvious inputs of this category: Art Deco, the Paris 1925 Fair, Frank Lloyd Wright, cubism, machine ethics, Mayan forms, Pueblo patterns, Dudoc, the Viennese Secession, modern interiors, the zoning-law setback. This large number of weakly related sources, readily identified as underlying the Moderne in America, begins to sug- gest the loose, broad, inclusive, less intense, rather indiscriminate, thus democratic, perimeters of the modern movement here as opposed to the impersonal, reductive, exclusive, more idealistic, more moralistic thrust of avant-garde Europe at that time. At the fair a high esteem for business was declared through the focus in early design studies on that symbol of "big business," the skyscraper. Ideals of business and commerce, individual identi- ty, free competition, practicality, and open-ended solutions, com- bined to produce, in the layout of the fair, an early version of that now-ubiquitous unplanned planning solution, the commercial roadtown. Ignoring Europe's mystical, theosophical justifications for the asymmetrical, America abandoned the restraints of classic symmetry in both site and pavilion planning out of a simple appreciation for the "new" and the pragmatic fact that it made the job easier. Though truncated "International Style" images and a special, American version of Functionalism were present, they were modified by a proclivity toward the "realistic," a many- layered sense of the word that included a realistic anticipation of the intellectual and aesthetic capabilities of the ultimate client, the consumer of the fair, mass man. Conclusively, this commercial, but "humane," consideration operated as probably the strongest force in the fair design. This commitment to an "average" indi- vidual supported the retention of ornament with a focus on cor- poreal form rather than the more abstract, and thus more difficult to comprehend, concern for space and volume. The levelling ac- tion of the "median" mind, the common, thus "mediocre," cul- tural values and tastes of the "majority" of Americans, the liberal tolerance that grows out of a melting-pot mixture of multiple positions produced this Moderne architecture, an architecture without purity, without precision, without a hard cutting edge. But if it were imprecise, it was equally nonauthoritarian and thus did not consciously deny such cherished democratic ideals as free- dom and individuality. Moderne architecture, ultimately, repre- sented a sort of laissez-faire, tolerant, architectural humanism of that time that is in many ways more closely attuned to today's "enlightened," antiheroic humanism than the more promoted, elite-based, architectural ideas of that era. SCIENCE FICTION AND THE MODERNE Mary Kathleen Church, California Arts Commission If it is true, as Dr. Gebhard has suggested, that the earmark of 1930s Moderne design was its symbolism of the future, we can expect to find connections between it and contemporary litera- ture dealing with the future-science fiction. Science fiction has influenced architecture ideologically through- out the century-in the '30s, primarily in its fascination with the machine and transportation. The influence of H. G. Wells is all- important. Based on a faith in science, Wellsian thought was most influential in the '30s, when people were ready to accept a promise of plenty from the machine. Interestingly, the Moderne designers, in their persistent Wellsianism, were behind the times compared with contemporary science fiction,which was already anti-Wellsian by the '30os (cf. Brave New World, 1932). There are several instances of the direct influence of science fiction visualizations on architecture in this century (cf. The Brad- bury Building)-Dr. Gebhard has noted the early appearance of streamlining in popular science fiction magazines (as early as 1926). But again, most influential were the word-pictures of Wells, par- ticularly his descriptions of new materials, of airborne transport, and of architecture of titanic proportions with curved walls and much glass. Science fiction art of the '3os, relying heavily on Wells, provides us with examples of Moderne design in its extreme, notably the work of Frank R. Paul, whose visualizations of the future point out the primitivism of real Moderne architecture. By the '30s science had not yet produced the materials which Moderne designs demanded, and the designer had to make do with Bakelite and glass brick. Bevis Hillier has suggested, in reference to movie houses, that</page><page sequence="11">231 the fantastic element in Moderne design is significant--perhaps this is why the most inoderne of the Moderne is to be found in science fiction illustrations. In science fiction movies we find design so moderne it was deplored for its crass modernism and tastelessness. However, in spite of its primitivism and outdatedness, moderne design must be taken seriously as an expression of Wells's hope for the future improvement of society. THE FOOTPRINTS OF THE MACHINE John Beach, University of California, Berkeley The recent interest in the 192os and '3os has resulted in articles, lectures, books, exhibitions, film festivals, paraphrases, and paro- dies by contemporary artists, and in a lively (and profitable) traffic in the newly respectable artifacts of the period. This activity has concerned itself primarily with individually produced high-art objects of European origin. While this limited investigation has uncovered many wondrous things, it has ignored or treated with contempt the countless inexpensive, mass-produced, everyday articles which were such an important visual and economic aspect of the American Moderne. In Europe the new style was accepted as a new style: it was the expected and fashionable reaction against Art Nouveau. But in America a different attitude was operating: the national self-image was progressive rather than frivolous, in- terested in improvement rather than novelty. Therefore, if the new style was to be sold to Americans (not the F. Scott Fitz- geralds and Harlows and Bright Young Things who bought the latest style in any case; but the man in the street and the little old lady from Dubuque and your Uncle Henry) it must acquire the authority of necessity, morality, inevitability. And that authority is just what the propagandists of the Moderne attempted to pro- vide. That they succeeded is not, I think, open to question. It was this feeling that the Moderne was not merely a new fashion, but rather the newly discovered way to design things properly, which was responsible for its application to a range of items not normally so carefully (or extravagantly) styled. There are many objects currently marked with telltale traces of Moderne styling, and it is sometimes difficult to distinguish between objects which look the way they do because the Moderne has influenced the way we ex- pect objects to look, think they should look, and those designed in, say, 1934 and still stamped from the same die because no one since has come up with a convincing argument for retooling. Such companies as Ronson, General Electric, Napier, Frankart, Toledo, and De Villbiss found the Moderne a design mode both exciting and profitable. Excitement and profit sum up, perhaps as well as any set of adjectives, the mixed motives, the odd combination of exploration and exploitation, of earnestness and hucksterism, of the mode which could produce designed obsolescence and the Ade~man Laundry, streamlined irons and the dymaxion bath- room, the Chrysler Airflow and the bustless female form. THE MODERNE IN THE TWIN CITIES: THE POPULARITY OF THE MODERNE IN THE MIDWEST Herbert Scherer, University of Minnesota This paper is concerned with the expression of the Moderne style in Minneapolis and St. Paul. It is intended to call attention to the major monuments and place them within the framework of the style. Acceptance of Professor Gebhard's terms for the 1920os phase (Zig-zag Moderne) and the '30os phase (Streamlined Moderne) should by now have reached acceptance. It should be realized that the style was a continuum through these years. Robert Pincus- Witten in his talk at the Minneapolis Institute of Art was the first to note the neoclassic strain in the Moderne style. There are evi- dences of it in several official buildings of the 1930s in the Twin Cities. It is distinctive enough to merit its own term: Neoclassic Moderne. The Sears Roebuck Office and Store in Minneapolis was built in 1927 after the designs of a prominent Chicagc industrial designer. The bold massing of the tower shows the perpendicular emphasis sought by American architects of the 1920s. This was a result of the influence of Saarinen's Tribune design. It is perhaps the first major Moderne building in the Twin Cities. Like the classic Zig-zag Moderne of the Forum Restaurant (1929), it was imported from the headquarters of a national firm. The Forum design was exe- cuted with minor variations in several American cities. The Foshay Tower had its inception possibly as early as 1926, but due to financial difficulties was not completed until 1929. It represents in its way an expression as individual in Americana as the Watts Towers. It was built by William Foshay, the utilities king. It was his idea that the unique shape of the office building, a simulacrum of the Washington Monument, would at once attract successful corporations which would value the advertising worth of such a location, and honor the first president. The lavishness of the interiors shows the hand of the sophisticated Beaux Arts archi- tect Leon Arnal, who was obviously aware of the Paris Exhibition. The Horace Mann Elementary School in St. Paul (1930) shows a free use of brick every bit as vigorous as the work of the Amster- dam school. It reveals a high degree of craftsmanship and an imaginative use of traditional building materials in the Moderne style. The complete assimilation of the Moderne idiom in the Twin Cities is best proved by its assured use by local architects. The Women's City Club of St. Faul (1930), built by MagnusJamne is a prime example. It is a completely integrated design. The Highland Theatre (1939) in St. Paul is a minor masterpiece. Its fagade con- tains subtle nuances of massing, and color and texture, not gen- erally associated with Moderne design. NORMAN BEL GEDDES AND THE MODERNE J. Kotas, University of California, Berkeley Considering his relatively exotic career, which filled the two decades between the wars, Norman Eel Geddes could be thought of as a stage designer, an inventor, a graphic designer, a play- wright, a writer, a filmmaker, or an industrial designer. When he is remembered at all, it is seldom in architectural terms. Yet his was a purposeful and directional influence in the formation of a mod- ern American commercial architectural style, the Streamlined Moderne. He can be seen today as a most important popularizer of the Streamlined Moderne, if not the veritable fountainhead of that optimistic design mode. As an architectural conceptualizer and propagandist-if not quite a theorist-he was, perhaps, unsur-</page><page sequence="12">232 passed in the I92os and '30os, in terms of quality and quantity of commitment to a spectacularly dramatic architecture of stream- lined imagery and futuristic appearance. Although the great ma- jority of his scehmes remained paper fantasies, their early and powerful suggestiveness added the excitement of the streamline to the majesty of scientific rationalization in a genuine and impressive creation. Often his most logical proposals, shorn of their glittering symbolic garments, were reborn as the work of later designers. Much American architectural practice was, and is, handled straightforwardly as a business venture very like deliberate mer- chandising, and Bel Geddes capitalized on this vein to some extent. As a design promoter he established a veneer of so plausible an art that his version was echoed and imitated until after World War II. Rather than initiating that trend, Bel Geddes was the first to ride the crest of a mixed media modernization wave, an amalgamation of International Style architectural devices, prophesies of future machine-age perfection, and traditional architectural commercial practices, united by a superb sense of showmanship. Bel Geddes was the instigator of the process he called industrial design, and in which he was a most energetic creator. ORIENTAL ARCHITECTURE Chairman: J. LeRoy Davidson, University of California, Los Angeles EARLY VAISHNAVA MONUMENTS Wayne E. Begley, University of Iowa Recent excavations at Besnagar have revealed the outlines of an elliptical structure adjacent to the famous pillar of Heliodoros, which was apparently once surmounted by the Garuda emblem of Vishnu. This structure was probably a shrine dedicated to the deified hero Vasudeva-Krishna, described in the pillar inscription as the supreme "god of gods." Although the pillar is usually assigned to ca. 100 B.c., the shrine itself may date more than a century earlier, making it the earliest-known religious structure dedicated to a major Hindu deity. The discovery of the structure raises again the problem of defining the significance of the entire shrine complex at Besnagar within the context of the formative phase of. Hindu temple architecture. The only other early site where foundations of both Vaishnava and Saiva temples have sur- vived is Nagarjunakonda, where a temple dedicated to Vishnu was built around the middle of the third century A.D. We know almost nothing of early Hindu architecture in the long interval between Besnagar and Nagarjunakonda, although the numerous sculptural fragments of Vishnu icons which survive at Mathura and other sites provide evidence of the existence of structural shrines in which the images were undoubtedly housed. In an at- tempt to bridge the gap in our knowledge of the development of early Vaishnava monuments, the present paper will review the archaeological and inscriptional evidence for the reconstruction of the shrines at Besnagar and Nagarjunakonda, within the contex of the early history of the Vaishnava sect. BRICK MONUMENTS OF THE GUPTA AND POST-GUPTA PERIOD Prudence R. Myer, University of California, Santa Barbara Discussions of early Indian temples often neglect the great brick temples that once adorned most of the important centers of the Gangetic plain because few of them survive. Archaeological finds indicate that the architects of the region experimented with a variety of types and plans, some of which were to exert substantial influence on later architecture over a wide area. We shall analyze the relatively well preserved Vishnu temple at Bhitargaon to demonstrate the standard architectural vocabulary of the late fifth century (?) and its development in the next century or so. THE MUNDESVARI TEMPLE Frederick M. Asher, University of Minnesota The Temple of Mundeivari, located about eight miles south of Bhabhua in Shahlbad District, Bihar, may be ascribed to the early seventh century and must be one of the temples mentioned in an inscription dated 636 A.D. which was discovered in the debris around the temple. The temple has an octagonal plan which, though extremely unusual, is not unique to this temple. It is one of the several temple ground plans enumerated in the literary sources compiled close to the period of the Munde'vari Temple such as the Brihat Sarhhitd and various Purrnas and in later texts as well. In any case, the plan is no indication of the date of the temple which, judging from the decoration of the walls, is clearly more evolved than the late fifth- or sixth-century Vishinu Temple at Deogarh and anticipates such late seventh- or eighth-century temples as the Lakshmana Temple at Sirpur or the Parasurameivara Temple at Bhuvanesvara. Hence the temple must have been erected close to the time of the inscription, and it reveals some of the develop- ments of Indian temple architecture just after the Gupta period. There is a doorway on each of the sides facing the cardinal directions. On the intermediate sides there is a large central niche with a smaller niche at either side of the central one in the fashion of temples dating from the seventh century onward but unlike Gupta temples which have, at most, one niche on a side. Relief decoration is confined to the area just around the doorways and niches and on one of the massive moldings which form the base of the temple. The rest of the large ashlar masonry with which the temple is faced remains undecorated and reminiscent of the rela- tively plain temples of the Gupta period. The interior is also octagonal in plan with a raised plinth in the center on which there was a tall chaturmukhaliniga until its theft in December 1968. On one side of the garbha-griha is an image of Mahishamardini, known as Mundeivari, from which the temple derives its name. When Francis Buchanan-Hamilton's artist visited the Mundes- vari Temple in 1811, there was on the eastern side a flat roofed mand4apa supported at the front by four pillars. This no longer remains. The superstructure has also collapsed, and it is impossible to determine its form. However, the earliest photograph of the temple, made in 90oI, shows a pile of rubble on top of the garbha-griha, suggesting that there once must have been a towering</page><page sequence="13">233 fikhara, typical of temples of the period, which would have been octagonal in section. The features of the Mundesvari Temple relate it closely to temples in Central India and Orissa but distinguish it from the more severe temples in Bihar east of the River Son. Thus this temple serves as a further indication-along with the total absence of Buddhist images and the extremely rare use of Rajmahal Schist -that Shihabad District, separated from the rest of Bihar by the River Son, was culturally distinct, in spite of the fact that Shahabad District was surely part of the political sphere of Magadha during the time the Mun.desvari Temple was built. THE NEPALESE BAHAL: ITS POSITION IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF B UDDHIST ARCHITECTURE John C. Huntington, Ohio State University The Nepalese version of the Buddhist vihara (bahal or baha in Nepali) has been overlooked by scholars working on Buddhist architecture even though the early investigators in the field have recognized its importance as a living document in the history of architecture. The principal concern of the authors who have dealt with the bahal as a distinct subtype of the Nepalese architectural complex has not been so much the nature of the architecture but, rather, religious, ethnographic, or generalized investigations into the history of Nepal. One recent study was concerned with traces of early forms of Buddhism combined with a brief architectural guide and analysis. It is the purpose of this paper to offer a sum- mary of the type of Buddhism practiced, a typology of the bahals, and an introduction to the historical significance in the context of the history of Buddhist architecture. Previous writers have not failed to notice the type of Buddhism practiced in Nepal but they have either been unwilling to ac- knowledge the degree to which it dominates the region, have insisted on searching for other "purer" forms as well, or have investigated the sociological aspects of its function as a focal point for two of the castes of the Nepalese social system. The Nepalese practice the Tantric form of Buddhism based on the Guhyasamaja and allied texts according to the preceptorship of the patriarchal lineage of the Mahasiddhis. It is known (from the Chao lo-tsi-ba'i rnam-thar, "Biography of Dharmasvamin") that, by the thirteenth century, Nepal was already a center for this kind of Buddhism and, according to other Tibetan traditions, has continued to be a center to the present. The lack of outward appearance of this phenome- non is due to the very esoteric nature of the teachings and to the close-knit structure of the small community of advanced teachers active in the region. The presence of this form of Buddhism may easily be identified by the specific iconography of certain images used as architectural adornment and by the names of some of the bahals. Typical examples are Matsyendranath and Minnath, both named after Mahasiddhis (and both containing major images of Avalokiteivara, appropriate to the Guhyasamaja meditation cy- cles), and Bikuche and Kwa, both of which show clearly the iconographic conventions specifically related to the teachings of the Mahasiddhis. There is a history of Buddhist institutions in Nepal stemming from the earliest beginnings of the proselytization of the faith and in Patan there are five stupas that are traditionally associated with the activities of the third-century B.C. Indian Emperor A.soka. Even so, the buildings that are presently extant in the Kathmandu valley may not be assumed to be older than the fourteenth or fifteenth century at the earliest. These still maintain strongly tradi- tional ground plans and some of them compare very closely to those of the western Indian caves of Aurangabad. Of the presently extant bahals one may distinguish several types of recurring plans: (i) Basic plan, usually no more than a courtyard with a single stupa in the center and a shrine in one wall (usually west or south). Example: Kvata in Patan. (2) Temple court, a temple in the court- yard is the key feature but there is still a shrine in either the west or north buildings surrounding the courtyard. The surrounding buildings are not unified and do not comprise a single structure. (3) There are three subtypes of this category but the feature that they share in common is that they are a single structure enclosing a courtyard and having consistent architectural conventions in many aspects of their structure. A. Single structure with a stupa in the courtyard. Example: Woku in Patan. B. Single structure with a temple in the courtyard. Example: Hiranyabarna. C. Single with an ambula- tory around the shrine. This type shares additional features with some of the western caves in the presence of the ambulatory. Example: Nag Bahi, Patan. (4) Built around a major stupa. Several of the old places of pilgrimage are now the center of bahals and while each of these has its own individual characteristics they still constitute a rather distinct classification. Example: Swaymbunath. Conceptually, the Nepalese bahal may be demonstrated to be a transition between the Indian vihara and the Tibetan monastic complex. This is especially clear in the iconography of the shrines and the usage patterns of the various architectural elements. THE TWO PHASES OF MAHAYANA PATRONAGE AT AJANTA Walter M. Spink, University of Michigan The present paper is based on the assumption that the Mahayana caves at Ajanta, Caves gI and N3 at Aurangabad, and the vihara at Ghatotkacha were all excavated and decorated between ca. 465 and 500 A.D. under the patronage (direct or indirect) of the Vaka- taka dynasty. The traumatic disruption of the Vakataka dynasty in the very last years of the fifth century left most of the caves un- finished, but (for reasons not entirely clear) work on the caves was never taken up again. Despite the urgency with which the site developed during its great period of Mahayana patronage, there is good reason to think that even within this generation of activity there was a brief but distinct hiatus in activity at approximately 475 A.D., possibly due to a brief economic or political setback. In support of this thesis, we find, quite remarkably, that none of the earliest caves to have been begun (Caves 4, 6, 7, II, I5, and 16) were ever finished; in fact, all of these inaugural undertakings show at least two very distinct stylistic and iconographic phases. This is equally true, although less apparent, in caves such as z, 17, 19, and zo, all of which were probably begun a few years after the group mentioned above. However, the Ajanta caves begun after the time of Cave I (ca. 475-480?)-a group which would include Caves 3, 4, 14, and 2I-29-and the Vakataka caves at Aurangabad and Ghatotkacha evidence no such apparent break, even though</page><page sequence="14">234 carefully conceived decorative programs tended to fall apart in the latest years of Vakataka patronage, when there was a notable shift in the nature of donations. We will suggest that the occurrence of certain apparently anom- alous motifs in some of the Vakataka caves can be explained by the above hypothesis. Thus we hope to shed further light on the in- ternal development of the Vakataka cave sites during their very brief but very complex period of patronage. RESEARCH PAPERS BY PH.D. CANDIDATES Chairman: Ruth Capelle Kline, University of California, Los Angeles BERNARD RALPH MAYBECK AND THE PRINCIPIA: ARCHITECTURE AS PHILOSOPHICAL EXPRESSION Robert M. Craig, Cornell University The campus plan, including unexecuted designs and actual con- struction of buildings, for Principia College, Elsah, Illinois, repre- sents one of the last, the longest, and one of the most significant commissions in the career of Bernard Ralph Maybeck. The archi- tecture of Maybeck is rarely found out of the California area, and the college buildings comprise the majority of this out-of-state production. Principia College represents what to the architect was a life-dream realized, and what Maybeck viewed as a monument which would serve the ideals of man after his death. This paper examines Maybeck's relationship with Principia Col- lege during the 192os and 1930s from the point of view of his philosophy of the r61le of architecture in society, specifically the Principia community. The essay examines the spiritual ideas and values which Maybeck sought to embody in the college buildings and the methods he employed to identify them and to materialize them in architecture. In 1931 Maybeck wrote his Elsah supervisors, "Principia is spending all this money for us to paint a picture. Anyone could build houses." Maybeck looked to an English Cotswold village for his model and, thus inspired, began to paint his architectural concepts in a materialized yet pictorial framework. Maybeck de- signed a college which in form, mood, and physical surroundings would embody the spiritual ideas of friendship, peace, and serenity which he associated with English village life. This study, a preliminary investigation of Maybeck and Principia College, will soon be expanded in a doctoral dissertation which will examine and criticize the Principia commission in relation to Maybeck's total career and in the context of the era of the first few decades of the twentieth century. This broader investigation will draw upon other points of view: a detailed examination of the Principia College buildings themselves, their planning, construc- tion, architectural design, and landscaping. Maybeck's methods of design and execution of the commission and his relationship with the client will be prime considerations. The present paper, how- ever, restricts its scope to Maybeck's purposes at Principia and the philosophy and attitudes behind this effort to embody Idea in material architecture. RICHARDSONIAN TRADITION AND FRANK LLOYD WRIGHT, WITH AN EXCURSUS ON THE FLOWER POT THAT GREW INTO A CHURCH Stanley Kenneth Jernow, Columbia University Some of the most famous examples of H. H. Richardson's work were small suburban railroad stations built in the I88os. One of these, as James O'Gorman has noted, was probably the source for an early Wright building, and we believe that it also influenced other architects. Early in his career Wright produced other deriva- tive designs and one of the most ambitious of these was his entry for the Milwaukee Public Library competition of 1893. We pre- sent here a previously unknown important pen drawing by Wright which shows clearly the strong dependence of this design upon Atwood's Columbian Exposition Fine Arts Building (a de- pendence H. R. Hitchcock has previously discussed). Other World's Fair buildings which could have influenced Wright were Richardsonian railway station renderings exhibited by Bradford Lee Gilbert in a pavilion which adjoined Sullivan's Transportation Building. These small station renderings were proto-Prairie in their emphasis upon long low dominating hip roofs and in their pronounced articulation. Wright probably knew Gilbert, and he probably was interested in railway stations as the Adler and Sullivan offices had designed the 1891 New Orleans terminal of the Illinois Central Railroad. This building, square in outline, with a generous hip roof and marked horizontal emphasis in its division between upper and lower storys is, we believe, the direct ancestor of Wright's Winslow house in 1893. The Winslow stables are important because their articulation and emphasis upon floating shallow hip roofs are prophetic of future Prairie House developments. And the Cooper stables and the related drawing which Wright submitted at his job interview with Sullivan are even more important in this regard, as H. Allen Brooks has pointed out. These stables were, we believe, derived directly from Richardson's Ames Gate Lodge in North Easton, Massachusetts, a building which was famous in Chicago at the time. Other Richardsonian aspects of Wright's early houses shall also be mentioned. One interesting specific example is the River Forest Golf Club of 1898 which has similarities to Gilbert's 1895 Bayonne</page><page sequence="15">235 station and to the verandahs and porte cocheres of J. L. Silsbee. Thus, the I89os was a time in which Wright was developing his concepts and much of that development was dependent upon Richardsonian tradition. An excursus deals with the development of a particular circular form-the geometrical shape of the 1956 Wauwatosa, Wisconsin, Greek Orthodox Church of the Annunciation. It shall be shown that this form was used previously by Wright for flower pots at both his Oak Park Studio and at the Imperial Hotel. The church, therefore, appears to be an example of Wright's occasional habit of playfully amplifying the shape of common objects into buildings -and the only one known to have been carried to completion. SOURCES OF JAPANESE INFLUENCE ON AMERICAN ARCHITECTURE IN THE LATE NINETEENTH CENTURY Marjorie Pearson, University of Chicago In thinking of the influence ofJapan on American works of archi- tecture, one's mind may often turn to such buildings as those by the Prairie School architects, most notably Frank Lloyd Wright in his Warren Hickox and B. H. Bradley houses at Kankakee, Illinois. However I do not propose to delineate specific Japanese charac- teristics in buildings such as these, but rather to show how Ameri- can architects found out about Japanese architecture and related arts and to discuss why such works proved influential. Japan remained largely a closed society to the West until Com- modore Matthew Perry was officially received by the Japanese in I853. Following the signing of a Treaty of Peace, Amity, and Commerce between Japan and the United States in I854, trade relations could begin. SoonJapanese artworks began to gain popu- larity in Europe and the United States. The sources for information about Japanese art and design were several. Among the earliest were accounts by various diplomats and travellers of their experiences. Most of these books contain impressions of theJapanese way of life and of variousJapanese art- works, often illustrated with examples. International exhibitions such as the ones at London in I862 and Paris in 1867 brought the art and architecture ofJapan to the atten- tion of both artists and the general public. The Philadelphia Cen- tennial International Exhibition in 1876 gave a large number of Americans an opportunity to see what Japan had to offer at first hand. By the time of the Chicago World's Columbian Exposition in 1893, a fair amount was beginning to be known about Japan, its culture, and its art. However, the opportunity to see the Hoo-den, or Phoenix Villa, which encompassed almost a thousand years of Japanese development in design, confirmed earlier accounts and research. Exhibitions such as these both aroused public conscious- ness of Japan's art and made the public willing to accept such works in their own homes. Periodicals aimed more at the professional than at the general public did not overlook the newly aroused interest in Japan and often provided helpful information about Japanese design. But it was not until 1885 when Edward S. Morse published his Japanese Homes and their Surroundings that the American architect was pro- vided with a definitive handbook on Japanese architecture. Now the American architect could readily find specific details to in- corporate into his own buildings. Archaeologically correct Japanese buildings did not appear in the United States despite the nineteenth-century. attention to his- torically correct detail. However, given the constant call for a new architecture to express the spirit and ideals of a new age that pervaded the nineteenth century, it is not surprising that American architects should look to Japanese designs as a new source of inspiration. Although first a novelty which expressed itself in the application of Japanese details and artworks to Western-style buildings, ultimately the inspiration of Japan incorporated itself into American architecture in a truly artistic and meaningful way. SULLIVAN'S ARCHITECTURE AND THE AESTHETICS OF DEMOCRACY Narciso G. Menocal, University of Illinois, Urbana An analysis of Sullivan's oeuvre reveals the existence of three strains which weave through his entire production and which de- termine, in their final synthesis, the character which is universally recognized as Sullivanian. These three strains may be labelled as the romantic (which he later identified with the organic principle), the rationalist (or organic), and the transcendental-idealistic, which finally led him to an anthropomorphic conception of architecture. These became ingrained in Sullivan during his childhood and young adulthood and his receptivity toward them was in turn determined as a matter of course by his natural inclinations. This interplay between innate affinities and external influences at an early age not only informed his personal character but, also, that which Walfflin labelled as the aesthetic will, that is to say, his penchant toward designing in a particular manner or, if one wishes, his personal style. The existence of these currents acting in this manner may be checked against, and proved by, Sullivan's own writings. The purposes of the present work are first to analyze the nature of these currents and the causes which they in turn produced and, second, to observe how a flux and reflux of fusion and diffusion among them determined a progressive development of an archi- tectural iconography which finally crystallized, after the dissolu- tion of the partnership with Adler, into the most mature style Sullivan thought he was capable of and which was, by this time, a conscious expression and extension of his philosophical theories. It will be further observed how this iconographic system was paradoxical in nature due to the extreme polarity of the two main concepts shaping it: namely, the organic and the inorganic, the romantic versus the rational. Nevertheless, because of the visual strength produced by Sullivan's particular brand of anthropo- morphic symbolism already alluded to, this paradox is, in many cases, not easy to discern. It will be pointed out also that although this paradox never found a final solution in Sullivan's creation ofa typical and personal architectural morphology, it was indeed solved satisfactorily in his system of ornament. JOHN SOANE AND THOMAS HARDWICK: A NEO-CLASSICAL PARTNERSHIP IN ROME Pierre de la Ruffinibre du Prey, Queen's University, Kingston, Ontario The Royal Academy of Arts in London, founded in 1768, offered its outstanding pupils the coveted oPPortunity of a trip at the</page><page sequence="16">236 King's expense to Italy. After a rigorous series of academic con- tests, John Soane (1753-1837), a student in the school of architec- ture since 1771, left London on 18 March I778 as the winner of the prestigious three-year Rome prize. Thomas Hardwick (1752-1829), Soane's former fellow-student, had preceded him abroad in 1777, financed with parental support. Although Hardwick was absent in Naples when Soane arrived 2 May, he returned to Rome 7 June, met Soane, was impressed by his recent plan of the Church of Sant'Agnese fuori le Mura, and copied it, thus beginning a fruitful collaboration. As early as 16 June the two Englishmen were jointly engaged on a project. This collaborative system offered two advantages. In the first place the partners could freely copy one another's previous independent studies without duplicating all the effort involved. Secondly, the pair could more quickly accomplish such ambitious tasks as mea- suring Santa Maria Maggiore, the temples of Minerva Medica and Vesta, the Church of Santa Maria degli Angeli, and the Villa Madama. The amicable working relationship sought rapidly to expand the collections both men were frantically accumulating to impress prospective clients back at home. It ended abruptly, due to an acrimonious dispute during the late autumn of 1778 involving Soane and John Henderson, an architect-friend of Hardwick's. As a group the Soane/Hardwick drawings (in their separate respective homes, the Soane Museum and the R.I.B.A. collection) form a unique survival revealing the teamwork practiced among students, as well as the sort of concerted campaign undertaken to record the best-preserved "antique" structures in Rome. The ap- proach here in contrast to earlier surveys was significantly farther- reaching in its intent: to distill from intact buildings their planning principles, general appearance, and concept of internal space, with a view to incorporating these characteristics literally into Neo- Classical designs. Certain differences in the two parallel sets, nonetheless, distin- guish Hardwick, the more artistically gifted, from Soane, who avoided details that had to be executed freehand. Soane concen- trated instead on scrupulously recording information and on re- ducing forms to their essentials with less attractive but more prophetic effect. Both men's portfolios returned eventually to London where they have remained successfully deceptive until now as to their dual authorship and purpose as shortcuts to beating the rat race of a Neo-Classical architect's Grand Tour. THE CHAPTER HOUSE OF YORK MINSTER Steven H. Wander, Stanford University The chapter house of York Minster, begun around I290, lies at a crossroads in the history of English mediaeval architecture. On the one hand, it can be seen as part ofa long-standing English tradition of building octagonal chapter houses. On the other hand, it can be seen as a precursor to the Decorated style. So that while the York chapter house adheres closely to the format of its two immediate predecessors, the chapter house of Westminster Abbey, begun in I245, and the chapter house of Salisbury Cathedral, begun ca. 1263, it does diverge in various significant ways. The chapter houses of Westminster and Salisbury are funda- mentally identical. Both share an octagonal plan and similar in- terior elevation: At ground level an entranceway in one bay and a wall arcade in the other seven, above large tracery windows and a stone vault resting on a central pier. They even share the same internal dimensions; both are fifty-eight feet across. York shares this basic format, even to the point of being fifty-eight feet across as well. But now at York a three-dimensional undulating sedilia at ground level replaces the flat wall arcade of Westminster and Salisbury. At window level appears a wall passage, a typical Eng- lish architectural feature but never before used in a chapter house. The window itself shows a jagged five-light design instead of the balanced four-light grouping of Westminster. By shifting to a wood vault, the York architect was able to span the interior space with- out the use of a central pier. Thus freed from checking the thrust of a stone vault, the exterior buttresses take on increased orna- mental richness. In fact, the overall impression of the York chapter house is one of increased formal complexity and greater spacial development. This would seem to result from the fusion of this basic chapter house format with elements drawn from small-scale shrine archi- tecture. While the sedilia is unrelated to contemporary architecture in England, it shows extremely close parallels to the portal systems of French cathedrals. The wall buttresses resemble most closely such shrines as those of St. Alban (1307) and St. Erkenwald (1313). Even the horizontal masonry block above the doorway seems drawn from the vocabulary of shrine architecture. The York window is a fusion of two earlier types. The idea for a five-light grouping probably comes from Lincoln east faqade (completed I280) and the idea of a window head of three equal oculi and a central lancet containing a secondary arch, from Southwell chapter house. By comparison with other windows in North England including those at Ripon Minster and Lincoln cloister (dated securely to 1296), one may infer that the York chapter house dates from the 129os. Nevertheless, the York master's particular adaptation of sculp- ture for purely architectural purposes led him to create a chapter house whose unique character sets it off from all contemporary architectural projects and simultaneously establishes it as a possible source of inspiration for later works of the Decorated style. THE CHOIR ELEVATION OF ST. WERBURGH'S CHESTER Virginia Jansen, University of California, Berkeley The Benedictine Abbey of St. Werburgh, now Chester Cathedral, is often considered a largely nineteenth-century building. Al- though thoroughly restored by Sir Gilbert Scott, its design and most of its details remain mediaeval. Perhaps its art historical neglect results from the architecture itself. It does not fit easily into English patterns, nor is the church a unified design: there is a confusing succession of four projects of which the choir is the second. Begun ca. 1280, the choir presents a new elevation pattern for England-the Chartrain elevation of tall clerestory and short tri- forium. There is a difference, however: Chester retains the thick- walled structure of Anglo-Norman tradition with two passages- one in the triforium and one at the clerestory. The combination of two passages has a long tradition in England, but the Gothic triforium elevation with two passages is not specifically English; it is also the "passage-ridden Burgundian parti," itself derived from</page><page sequence="17">237 England, from the Trinity Chapel at Canterbury. Were Bur- gundian influences penetrating into England at Chester although all details reveal English work? This is possible, for in neighboring Wales where King Edward I was building castles, the head master mason and many other workmen were Savoyards, borrowed from the King's great-uncle, Count Philip of Savoy. Savoy, as part of the Kingdom of Burgundy, belongs to the Burgundian ambiant. Furthermore, the joint supervisor of several of the castles was the King's Engineer, Richard Lenginour, who was master to the abbot of St. Werburgh's in 1310. Connections between Chester and Savoy are direct and definite. Responses to French architecture were often present in English architecture in the second half of the thirteenth century; West- minster Abbey, St. Paul's Cathedral, and York Minster were among many buildings which translated French vocabulary into an English idiom. During this period of rapid change Chester's choir elevation showed new possibilities for English design; it departed from the tiered equality of the tribune or tall triforium elevation, the main pattern of English architecture since the Con- quest. This elevation of large, deep window openings and a ripple of depth in the second story succeeded only when the multiple smaller units of the Early English style gave way to the unifying larger forms and elegant details of the Decorated style. The triforium elevation of Chester was a current experiment only for a short time, reflected in the elevations of the choirs of Gisborough, ca. 1290, and Exeter, ca. 1300. Thereafter, different ideas appeared, and new patterns formed, unifying the profusion of precocious early Decorated forms. Even at Chester, in the south transept (ca. 1330), the architect discarded the triforium elevation. He retained the large clerestory with passage, but simpli- fied the design into two broad stories of equal value. The three- story triforium elevation was no longer an acceptable solution to church design in England. Research for this paper was supported by a grant from the Mabelle McLeod Lewis Memorial Fund. THE ARCHITECTURE OF THE FACADE OF WELLS CATHEDRAL Carolyn Malone, University of California, Berkeley The early thirteenth-century faqade of Wells Cathedral provides a rich example of ornate architectural decoration in Gothic archi- tecture. Moreover, the faqade is part of the recurring phenomenon in mediaeval art of enriching architecture with motifs borrowed from small-scale objects, but goes far beyond enrichment alone in its translation of small-scale forms into architecture. Two architectural traditions of richness meet in the faqade of Wells. The most ornate elements of Lincoln-inspired Early Eng- lish architecture are intensified with rich effects already found in the late twelfth-century school of West Country masons. Both traditions were a source for the dematerialization of mass effected in the faqade by deep undercutting, framing with detached shafts, and other devices for spatial penetration of the wall. Although fagades and porches had long been an important point for the localization of rich effects, the most elaborate style was particularly appropriate for a faqade which represents the Heavenly Jerusalem. Accordingly, the architect of the facade of Wells also drew upon forms outside of architecture. An evolution of small-scale motifs from shrines to architecture at the end of the twelfth and the beginning of the thirteenth century in England provides a background in which the bold idea for the design of the faqade of Wells could emerge. Shrines first influence the decoration of church furniture, such as tombs and choir screens, and are then borrowed for the decoration of archi- tecture. A motif, like the quatrefoil, is easily transferred from a metal reliquary to a stone tomb, which on an enlarged scale emulates the sacred r81e of the shrine; likewise, it passes easily from a screen enclosing the choir to the actual walls of the choir. The architect of the faqade of Wells, however, saw richer possi- bilities-aesthetic and thematic-for the use of small-scale forms when he treated an entire facade as something other than archi- tecture.</page></plain_text>
