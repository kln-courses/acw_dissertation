<plain_text><page sequence="1">Pierre Klossowski and Denise Morin Sinclaire in Roberte. Journals Gilbert Adair From Paris One can also begin to find comfortable the experience of reading an extremely violent novel - like the novels of Bataille, for instance - and it might be amusing to pub- lish Bataille by slipping in one or two pages of Anatole France in order to make Bataille revolutionary once more . Except that Ana- tole France is himself extremely perverse. - From an interview with Pierre Zucca Pierre Zucca' s Roberte , this year's French entry in the Semaine de la Cri- tique at Cannes, is one of the only two new movies I've seen recently with an I.Q. of more than 100 (the other being Truffauťs astonishing La chambre Verte). Zucca is a young ex-photographer whose earlier feature, Vincent mit Vane dans un pre et s'en vint dans Vautre (a title requiring two separate translations, as Vincent Put the Ass in One Meadow and Went Off into Another and again as 2,000,000 Years in One Meadow and 120 in Another ), though promising, abso- lutely did not prepare us for his second, which is quite simply one of the cinema's great originals. Roberte is based on the first volume of a trilogy, Les lois de V hospitalité , by the novelist and philoso- pher Pierre Klossowski. His protagonist, a Resistance heroine become member of the Commission de la Censure, might be seen as a partner in two very distinct rela- tionships: with Octave, her fictional hus- band, a much older man whom she res- cued from post-Occupation disgrace by marrying him; and with Denise Morin Sinclaire, Klossowski's own wife and Muse, who was in certain respects her in- spiration. The above-mentioned "laws of hospi- tality" are those permitting a husband to offer up his wife to the delectation of chance guests and acquaintances, and in which the outwardly severe Roberte is not, perhaps, an unwilling participant. Amid the red velvet trappings of some comedy à l' italienne , her exhibitionism plays hide-and-go-seek with the voy- eurism of Octave; it is only after his death by poison that she realizes she can never be other than "his" Roberte, the creature of his obsessions (as Denise is Klossowski's?). Zucca' s coup was to have persuaded these two sacred monsters of Parisian lit- erary life to portray Roberte and Octave on screen. Klossowski (already to be glimpsed in Au hasard Balthazar) is mag- nificent, what I'd be tempted to call the Groucho Marx of unintentional humor were it not evident that he is totally in control of every effect he achieves. In a series of scabrous situations, whether be- ing strapped onto parallel bars in a sinis- ter gym or "interfered with" (this kind of démodé terminology is peculiarly appro- priate to the movie's somewhat per- fumed eroticism) in the presence of Arab shoe-shine boys, Mme. Morin Sinclaire, a remarkably well-preserved grande dame , never forfeits her dignity. I should add that Klossowski has just turned casting anyone else. Ideally, perhaps, the film should have been made twenty years ago, but I'm not so sure. Even those spectators who were put off ini- tially by the age factor admit nonetheless that they were extremely troubled - especially in the parallel bars scene - to the point of finally forgetting how old she was. I think the whole notion of being sexually aroused by only one codified type of physical object is false and ter- roristic. It's precisely in the contrast be- tween the respectability of Denise and the narrative indecency that the source of the film's eroticism may be found. In the same way, Klossowski employs a highly elaborated neo-classical language - to depict events and motivations for which it was never intended." In effect, Klossowski (another of whose novels, La vocation suspendue , has been filmed by the Chilean Raul Ruiz) is one of those eminently French seventy-two and his wife is, as the French nicely put it, d'un certain âge. With this in mind, and given that the Ro- berte of the novel is presumably a woman in her prime, I asked Zucca about his choice of actress. "In fact, there was no choice. Denise is Roberte and I never for a moment considered authors whose extreme preciosity of style is calculated to reduce the Anglo- Saxon reader to fits of incredulous gig- gles. Except that in his case these giggles have been, as it were, worked into the texture of the fictions themselves: in dia- logue, for instance, of almost Firbankian drollery. If Zucca has been as faithful to 2</page><page sequence="2">his model as Rohmer to Die Marquise von O ... y the Bergsonian laughter that this fidelity invariably provokes - with juxtapositions of cinema and literature, twentieth and nineteenth centuries, the O . . . family of Rohmer' s film going in exclusively for Empire furniture, and so on - becomes an authentic echo of Klossowski' s own ironic distancing. "For the film I insisted that Roberte wear high-heeled shoes, since I could hardly imagine her otherwise. Which is why Denise, who wears only flat, 'sensible' shoes in life, seems forever about to tot- ter and fall over. Apart from giving her the appearance slightly of a Warhol trans- vestite, as befits the character's double nature and rather masculine name, it proved a useful metaphor for the con- stant state of suspension in which she finds herself." The danger of movies such as this, of course, is that they remain beautiful but decorative objets d'art, like those gor- geous chess sets in ivory or steel that no chess master would ever contemplate us- ing. Because of this state of suspension, however, and the sly manner in which Zucca puts a not-so-innocent blue eye to the keyhole of the older artist's most inti- mate fantasies, Roberte emerges victori- ous from the test. Since the movie succeeds in pastiching even the style of Klossowski's drawings (one could compare them to Max Beerbohm's if Beerbohm had been an erotomane), I asked Zucca finally about the nature of his own contribution. "When I speak to friends, I refer to the film as Pierre's (Klossowski's); when he does, he calls it Pierre's (mine). In my very fidelity to his text I feel I've done something quite different. As the charac- ters are all playing roles anyway, I tried to emphasize the theatrical or tableau vi- vant aspect of the film with drapes, busts, domino masks. The decor itself becomes a character. Which is why I in- serted the little newsreel of Pius XII at the Vatican. What a spectacle that is! Did you notice how the gestures of his hands are identical to those of Denise through- out the film? In the church, of course, the hand represents a word, a source of language; and, paradoxically, eroticism is also a language of gesture, of the body. A Klossowskian paradox, that." And not the least adornment of the chronicle, to paraphrase the lyrical blurb at the end of Ada , is the delicacy of picto- rial detail, the amazing dialogue, Barbet Schroeder as a lecherous Swiss Guard, Juliet Berto as a boy, and much, much more.© by Jonathan Rosenbaum Back And Forth (London, 1/10/78), in Pam Cook and Simon Field's avant- garde film course. Each time I encounter Michael Snow's crisscrossed classroom, I learn a little bit more about how to watch it. Following those relentless, oscillating pans with the eyes - equating one's head and ego with the camera or vice versa in some sort of anthropomorphic/illusionist perversion conditioned by Hollywood - turns out to be about as useful as climb- ing into a Mix Master and throwing the switch. Sitting still, in your head as well as in your seat, affords a smoother, sub- tler, and more contemplative experi- ence. After all, it's only the movie that's moving, not the spectator, and learning to play (not work) with this fact here and in La Region Centrale is like discovering how to fly. [Being flown by a 747 like Close En- counters Of The Third Kind (L.A., 12/7/ 77) is a different trip entirely; you see a lot less through the window, even though it's blown-up to look bigger - in the benign spirit of Bradbury, or Albert Speer.

After so much narrative coercion and good-natured cattle-prodding, the possibilities of relax- ing in a Snow film are deeply refreshing: a Jacusi of the mind that allows the non- narrative parts of the brain to dip and dive freely through the available spaces.] Nick Ray's Bigger Than Life (UCSD, La Jolla, 12/1/77), in the last session of my lecture course in Paranoia, has always been inextricably linked in my mind to Cinemascope. But after booking the largest auditorium and screen on cam- pus, the unexpected arrival of a TV scanned print forces me to acknowledge that I now have to deal with a different film: an intimate family closet-drama without a community or a society framing its edges. The horizon tal/social implications of Frank Lloyd Wright's organic architec- ture, linking inside and outside, are be- ginning to seem as archaic as Fifties Scope films, perhaps for related reasons. After lavishing time and money on re- storing the façade of an Arkansas mov- iehousefor September 30, 1955 (L.A., 12/ 12/77), James Bridges cut to a champ / contrechamp between the hero and the last scene of East Of Eden in a TV- scanned version, complete with a differ- ent end title. Is this the way to lovingly recreate a period? The Utopian notion of Consensus sug- gested by the broad image is being re- placed by the isolated box, necessitating different jokes for different folks. Re- duced to a fortress, Bigger Than Life be- comes melodrama without a front or back yard - an aberration that stays in the house, refusing to mix with the neigh- bors. "What the film shows so well, to the shame of psychiatrists," note Deleuze and Guattari in Anti-Oedipus, "is that ev- ery delirium is first of all the investment of a field that is social, economic, politi- cal, cultural, racial and racist, pedagogi- cal, and religious: the delirious person applies a delirium to his family and his son that overreaches them on all sides." It is the literal expanse of this overreach that the TV cookie-cutter tends to elimi- nate, turning sociology into psycho- pathology. One more reason why Ameri- can movies no longer exist. Latest riposte to the author theory: In the Marilyn Monroe chapter of James Bacon's Hollywood is a Four Letter Town (Florence, Alabama, 3/5/78), one learns (or is told) that MM spoiled twenty- seven takes of one shot in Fritz Lang's Clash By Night (to continue this alphabet- ical list), explaining to Bacon that she only delivered her line correctly when she liked the way the rest of the scene was going. Who's the auteur of that scene, complete with final edit? On a thematic level, The Downfall [Orizuru Osen] (London, 1/3/78), a late silent film of Mizoguchi from 1934, is scarcely different from his countless other sagas of female victimization. What makes it special, as a transitional movie between silence and sound, is the pres- ence of a benshi on the soundtrack - a male voice reciting not only all the inter- titles, including dialogue for male and fe- male characters alike, but also occasional narration supplementing them, in past tense and third person. And thanks to the music on the soundtrack (ranging from a Vivaldi concerto to A Night on Bald Mountain) and the earphone English commentary supplied at the National Film Theatre - effectively adding an- other benshi layer - the lovely silent ex- pressionist visuals, gravitating around flashbacks away from a Sternbergian train station where a locomotive is stalled, are literally only half the story of this haunted melodrama. c kJiown piecemeal in J-P Gorin's lec- ture course/nightclub act on Munich movies, my first look at Werner Schroeter's Eika Kapata (UCSD, La Jolla, 2/14-15/78, thanx to Tom Luddy) endlessly baffles and enthralls me in a way that Schroeter's more commercial compatriots seldom do. The magnetic soundtrack consists of opera (don't ask me what) heard continuously at the same volume level. And the shaky pans and zooms, like the attitudes and expressions of semi-in-drag cast and the monumental color compositions, are all pitched at pre- cisely the same point of excruciation. This is chamber music, not opera: the jazz piano equivalents could be either the bubbling brooks of George Shearing or the scalding shower-baths of McCoy Tyner - each of which maintains the same temperature throughout. What is it that keeps this lack of dy- namics interesting, working only from fragments of untold tales - a montage of emotional climaxes reeking of Dreyer's Jeanne D'Arc, with all the connective narrative tissue stripped away? Maybe it's the dedicated intensity behind every image, the overall lack of cattleprodding, and the discovery of a fixed, flat surface that links its experience to Tati, Ozu, late Lang, Jeanne Dielman , and earlier Bresson (before his Sam Fullerish shocker, The Devil Probably ), be- queathing the spectator some freedom to roam around and linger a little in various discrete pockets. L'Innocente (Paris, 12/25/77), Viscon- ti' s last film, is nothing but narrative, but all of it means something more than cattle-prodding. Is this why it still hasn't crossed the Atlantic? Seeing it the night after Chaplin's death only stresses the profoundly confessional tone of this ele- gaic hatchet job on a "freethinking" narcissist - the last sort of thing I'd have expected from Visconti after The Damned and Death In Venice. (Seeing the director's infirm hand emerge from the bottom of the screen behind the credits, to leaf through an equally old copy of the D'Annunzio novel the film is based on, is more than a "personal touch"; it's part of the diagesis. ) One can even read the climactic shot of Giancarlo Giannini catching his own gaze in a mirror, on the door of a closet opened by a servant - defining the mo- ment that he decides to murder his wife's illegitimate infant out of "love" for her - as the ultimate indictment of the director's own drawing-room Marxism, and the film festival Marxism that usually contained it. As with Proust and Chaplin, the degree of candor in the self-scrutiny makes this political in a way that Bertolucci's 1900 (L.A., 1/16/78)- com- ing on like a Giant that's pretending to be a Potemkin - doesn't even hint at. What Lang's Moonfleet (L.A. County Museum, 1 1/20/77) shows me today that I didn't recognize as such in 1955 is the discontinuity of the separate décors, the isolated surreal landscapes stretching off at oblique angles to one another. Like the dark well that's weirdly and improba- bly "lit" by a candle wedged into a recess halfway down, each of the characters seems to be isolated by the upholsteries of slightly different genres, no two view- points ever quite coinciding. They seem to inhabit a once-ordered universe whose father-god-director is drifting away from his children, taking all the connective tis- sue with him. The extraordinary thing about Satur- day Night Fever (New Orleans, 2/28/78) is the dance numbers - not only as dance but as the kind of dancing in films that leads straight into fantasy, even when the movie half-convinces you that it's a "real" extension of the rest. What gets released in, by, and through the gor- geous rush of these dream-bubble num- bers is precisely what gets repressed in, by, and through the characters else- 4</page><page sequence="4">where - a bit like what you find in Gilda. An eleven year-old girl in the commune where F m staying listens every day to the soundtrack record and would love to see the movie, but her mother says no - it sounds too raunchy - and I feel some of the pain in her frustration. She needs the songs as much as Tony and Stephanie and I do, but has to make her own private movie in order to get inside them. The audience at Loew's seems tired at the last show - not at all like the one I saw it with in Hollywood eight days ago, mainly black, who fed on the movie as if it were honey. In Milwaukee four nights ago, Sandy Flitterman and I agreed that the film theory conference we'd just at- tended should have shown it. Seriously. Speaking for myself, whatever the di- verse and discernible interests of Comolli's La Cecilia , Gidal's Condition of Illusion and Mulvey and Wollen's Rid- dles of the Sphinx , it is the musical num- bers here that teach me the most about the symbolic, the imaginary, and even the signifier - not to mention ideology and the libido. Maybe, on second thought, American movies have at least one lung left. But most of this particular column is concerned with disintegration (have you noticed?) of one kind or another, and the sorts of clarity that it can make possible. Which leads me ineluctably to the sub- titled 35mm prints I saw of Lang's The Ti- ger of Esc hnapur and The Hindu Tomb (London, 1/3/78), his penultimate films, thanx to Ian Christie and David Meeker. What are the signs of disintegration? ( 1 ) A conscious naivete that is sought and achieved, aimed at a child's sensibility and easily read as camp. (2) A naked arti- fice of props, actor-props, color schemes, and schematic plots laid bare, so that even the wires holding up the fake snake in Debra Paget' s religious dance inside a cave temple are visible. (3) A displace- ment (or misplacement) of narrative in- terest shortly after the beginning of The Hindu Tomb , Part II of the story, when Berger (Paul Hubschmid) is placed in chains at the bottom of a pit a lot like the well in Moonfleet , while Seeta (Paget) is confined to her chambers in the same palace. The hero and heroine are then re- placed by another couple, more klutzy and ineffectual, who parody the roles of Hubschmid and Paget, meanwhile con- suming acres of screen time. The effect of this is such that when Berger and Seeta are finally freed and united - and the vil- lain Chandra (Walter Reyer) suddenly renounces his palace and villainy to study with a holy man - the characters are still present on the screen, but they no longer exist. (4) A series of structural arrows drawn by one of the disintegrating cou- ples (I forget which) on the wall of an un- derground labyrinth before they sepa- rate, to find their way back to each other, but which wind up confounding all sense of continuity, like the décors in Moon- fleet , losing characters and spectators alike. What are the signs of clarity? All of the above, and more. London probably hasn't seen so much "baring the device" since copies of Viktor Shklovsky's Third Factory turned up at Compendium Books. Straub' s point that Lang offered his producer a film instead of a golden calf is well taken, but it is, of course, a film about a golden calf that we call cinema - made by someone who knows more about the subject than most - and a game that is played honestly. Critics hung up on "craft" and intentionality will probably never be able to see it as a daz- zling achievement (as they would have if Lang had raped them in their sleep), but there is nothing else in cinema like it. I'll go even further: it has the only cave in movies that's worthy of Plato's. ® 5</page></plain_text>
