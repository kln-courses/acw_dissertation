<plain_text><page sequence="1">FOSSILS OF THE MIND I THAT the present age is one of critical examination, in which social, educational, and moral concepts are be ing scrutinized and revalued is an observation so trite that only a purveyor of ethical platitudes would be guilty of recording it. Nevertheless, the sweep of this intellectual reconstruction is so broad in its scope that not only have religion and biology been swept from their secluded moor ings, but even the field of physics can no longer hope to preserve immunity to the virus of scepticism which is at tacking all hidden premises and unexamined assumptions. Such, in mixed metaphors, is the chaos of ideas we now survey. From a more theoretical viewpoint the most dis turbing eddies in the stream of modern thought, which are agitating most profoundly the current of ideas, are "psy choanalysis," "behaviorism," and the "theory of relativ ity." No doubt the more ambitious philosophers, who strive to attain that synoptic vision which Plato held should con stitute the perspective of the spectator of all time and all existence, will rush in, where the more circumspect scien tist fears to tread, and claim to discover some unifying principle underlying and harmonizing these seemingly un related movements. This, of course, is always the prerog ative of those whose avowed mission is that of presenting a "synthesis of the sciences." But whether there is any fundamental concordance between movements separated</page><page sequence="2">82 THE MONIST by the wide expanse between the field of physics and the province of psychology remains for the future to reveal. In any case, the merit of the present conflict between the older traditional conceptions and the newer and more revolutionary notions is that these more recent ideas serve as catalytic agents agitating a solution which is otherwise always on the point of coagulating into that inflexible sys tem of beliefs and creeds which has been called the "cake of custom." Such a state of stagnation and immobility is nothing less than a symptom of intellectual fossilization, a condition which the pessimistic intelligentsia have always feared is about to materialize. Indeed, protagonists of the intellectual aristocracy, summoning to their aid all the newly discovered methods and marshalling the statistical data and hasty generalizations of the youthful but lusty psychological and social sciences, now proclaim in no feeble utterances the oncoming decay of the social order, the twi light of civilization, which, they believe, will inevitably fol low the intellectual anemia and mental atavism which must accompany the gradual extinction of the superior Nordic stock here in America. I shall not be so presumptuous as the philosophers and social scientists. My present task is the modest one of attempting to establish the thesis that if it be granted that psychoanalysis and behaviorism (whatever their differ ences may be) have in common the ideal of establishing a monistic or biological conception of personality, then, thus linked together, they provide the basis for a new psycho logical science which one student has already designated as paleo-psychology. This science, studying the fossilized forms of mental evolution in a fashion analogous to the study of paleontology, which investigates the structures of ancient and extinct animals, differs from its sister science in that it does not limit itself to the fossilized forms of human thought of past ages, but also studies existing types</page><page sequence="3">FOSSILS OF THE MIND 83 of thought structures regarded as survivals and recon structions of more primitive systems of belief. Paleo-psy chology thus includes the comparative anatomy of ideas. This science begins its studies with the dawn of the mind, when the penumbra we call "consciousness" lighted up the pathways of the central nervous system, and intelligence, as foresight of the ends to be attained, guided the previ ously unconscious modes of response of the lower organ isms. This way of viewing our ideas is so novel, and per haps repugnant, to our natural human prejudices, that one may anticipate that something of the same battle is to be waged in psychology which was fought out and settled in England in the field of evolutionary biology fifty years ago. II The interpretative problem which faces this new disci pline is that of isolating the sources of conviction and be lief. Emphasizing the continuity of mental evolution, as opposed to the cataclysmic nature of social evolution, the investigators in this field must find relatively stable and uniform driving forces behind the various systems of be liefs. This is a very difficult problem, for personality and its forms of behavior are extremely complicated. Fortun ately, the results of research in biology and psychology tend to introduce some simplicity into the matter. Even such widely differing doctrines as behaviorism and psycho analysis have common ground. By "behaviorism" is meant the movement initiated by that radical group of psycholo gists who regard man solely as a biological creature, there by excluding mind or consciousness as a causal agency in human conduct, and who disregard introspection (the main traditional method of securing psychological facts) as a valid method of studying human and animal psychol</page><page sequence="4">84 THE MONIST ogy. "Psychoanalysis" refers to that movement in psy chology and psychiatry, closely associated in popular thought with the name of S. Freud, which seeks to reduce all higher forms of thought and conduct, scientific research, art, literature, etc., to "rationalizations" and "sublima tions" of biological impulsions or instincts common to all higher forms of animal life. In accordance with these prin ciples of rationalization and sublimation we remold, refine and modify our individually inherited cravings and emo tions such as fear, rage, hunger and sex, so that they express themselves in forms which are socially acceptable. While the behaviorists sometimes accuse the psycho analysts of making mystical entities out of such concepts as the "psychic censor" and the "unconscious," and while the psychoanalysts can not sympathize with the behavior ists in their rejection of introspection as a technique, both are in accord in challenging the popular idea of the self activity of the mind, or the notion of a self or ego as a non biological causal agency or principle, which can create de novo its systems of beliefs, independently of the biological nature and social heritage of an individual. If we sought to relate these psychological movements to the theory of relativity as a doctrine in physics we might state the matter as follows: Just as the physicist ignores the aether of space as a privileged "frame of reference," because it acts as if it did not exist, in the sense that its presence can not be detected by physical measurements, so in psychology mind is rejected as a privileged "coordinate system" for the reason that mind, as such, can not be iso lated and measured by any known instruments yielding quantitative results.</page><page sequence="5">FOSSILS OF THE MIND 85 III As illustrative of what is meant by fossils of mental evo lution we may cite the world-views embodied in primitive mythologies and cosmogonies, or theories of the origin of the universe and of man. All would agree that the con ception of Tha?es, that water was the primordial stuff out of which things evolved, is but an interesting survival of a primitive view of the universe. In other fields the "social contract" theory of Hobbes and Rousseau, and the doctrine of the "divine right of kings," may be singled out as socio logical myths which contemporary social philosophy has outgrown. A more controversial application of this sci ence which reaches back into the childhood of the mind, in its attempts at exploring the obscure depths and shoals of the intellect, may be exhibited in an analysis of the recru descence of spiritualism after the recent war. From a psy choanalytic point of view the belief in the continued exist ence of and possible communication with the spirit of a departed individual is an example of what is termed "com pensation thinking." In its widest meaning this principle refers to the fact that we are always striving to realize ends which, it they are denied us in reality, lead us to the creation of an ideal world wherein these desired objects are regarded as already existing facts. Unfulfilled wishes are satisfied by the creation of an imaginative world where in the things we desire are obtained. In this way the ideal world furnishes us an escape from the unwelcome facts of the real world. The virtue of this psychic motivation is that it is sometimes the only thing which makes life bear able, but the danger is that if it is carried too far, that is, if we live too much in the unreal world of sheer romance, it is likely to unfit us for living effectively in and solving</page><page sequence="6">86 THE MONIST the problems of the actual universe. To return to our illus tration, the psychoanalyst is likely to argue that spiritual ism, as a belief in the continued existence of and possible communication with personalities "on the other side," appeals to many uncritical minds simply because it satis fies the ineluctable demand in some for the survival of their loved ones. The craving which the present generation has for "superman" literature is another instance of this same mental mechanism in operation, especially if there is reason to suspect an "inferiority complex" underlying the thirst for this type of literature. In this connection the fact that this semi-philosophical genre had such a vogue in the pre war Germany may or may not be significant. The extreme application of this view is to be found in the expositions of those psychologists who contend that the desire for per sonal immortality of any sort is a sublimation of the uni versal biological craving of the sexual appetite. Without, for the present, attempting to evaluate the validity of these latter applications of the doctrine, I cite them as illustra tions of how the wish may become father to the thought and belief. This way of viewing human thought appeals to those who are searching for theories the sweep of which is suffi cient to include the entire span of mental evolution and the history of ideas. The "culture epoch" theory, which in social theory is analogous to the biological theory of re capitulation, holds that the mental development in the indi vidual recapitulates the mental evolution of the species. Previous to this hypothesis attempts at such formulae for the movement of thought have been ventured a number of times. Hegel's statement of this developmental sequence as exemplifying the moments of the dialectic, the thesis, the antithesis, and the synthesis, finds a parallel generaliza tion in Comte's conception of the three stages of the evolu</page><page sequence="7">FOSSILS OF THE MIND 87 tion of thought as given in the theological, the metaphysi cal and the scientific (positivistic) levels of explanation. The part which temperament plays in the determination of one's outlook on life has always been recognized. The most obvious divisions of human beings on the basis of temperament are to be found in such contrasts as are designated by "optimistic" and "pessimistic," or "conserva tive" and "radical." A more opportune illustration is now embodied in the theological classification into Fundamen talists and Modernists. In more technical spheres we have the famous division by William James of the tender-minded and the tough-minded, which is paralleled in contemporary literature by the distinction which Jung has made famous by the terms "introvert" and "extrovert." But the whole matter is far more intricate than any such dual division can indicate. In fact, such oppositions are rather arbitrary, and not easily maintained. For example, idealists have always pointed out that many to whom James applied the term tender-minded have been very active in social work and "practical" affairs. Again, one may be a radical on one subject and a conservative on others. Indeed, it is difficult to define these terms, for they are, like sanity itself, relative, varying between groups and in dif ferent periods of time. One may even be radical in his conservatism, as instanced by prominent opponents of views who, because of prejudices based on emotional bias, hold tenaciously to doctrines which are rejected by the ex perts competent to sit in judgment on the matter. This may sound like one of Mr. G. K. Chesterton's paradoxes, but it represents the truth of the matter?whatever that may ultimately mean. In the end, therefore, all that we have a right to conclude is that the explanation of the prob lem of why we entertain the opinions and beliefs we do hold to lies wrapped up in that most obscure word, per sonality.</page><page sequence="8">88 THE MONIST IV The problem of the analysis of mind as a system of be liefs, which constitute the intellectual framework of per sonality, is superlatively complicated, involving, as it does eventually, the old philosophical insolubilia, the "mind-body problem," and the age-old dispute of "mechanism versus teleology." Nevertheless, there are a few facts established, irrespective of how they are to be interpreted. If we look upon man's organism as a product of biological evolution, we may note that he, in common with his progenitors, is always faced by the necessity of presenting a unified and integrated system of responses to the external world. Be liefs are therefore necessary to action, for they represent past experience epitomized for present and future conduct. Admitting that so-called "motives" are frequently ration alizations of, or finding "alibies" for, what we do on in stinct or emotion, it must be conceded that "ideas," what ever they are, are usually "dynamogenic," in that they have motor consequences, or lead to overt behavior. It is for this reason that most people can not endure what someone has called the agony of a suspended judgment. Primitive credulity represents the tendency to believe everything, and to take all experience at its face value. This attitude is characterized by the term "naive realism." It is only by building up a system of collateral ideas, which serve as checks upon the tendency to react immediately to the given stimulus, that men, as individuals, have accumu lated serviceable reservoirs of knowledge which they can bring to bear upon the novel situations which present them their problems. That is to say, anything is believed and acted upon for which there is no counteracting idea, and hypnotic suggestion consists in limiting the field and ban</page><page sequence="9">FOSSILS OF THE MIND 89 ishing from consciousness these collateral ideas which nor mally tend to inhibit or prevent responses. Since our ideas are so intimately bound up with conduct anything which upsets our cherished notions is uncomfortable and unwel come, if for no other reason than that it disorganizes and throws into chaos the neurone patterns in the brain. It is not surprising, therefore, that individuals vigorously resist encroachments upon their religious or political faith, for disintegration of one's faith is here striking at the very roots of one's being. There is, then, this conservative tendency, which leads us to view with hostility any unfamiliar idea, or one which does not fit in with our accepted notions. In society this conventionalized system of beliefs constitutes the "mores'' of the group. On this plane of thought discussion of an issue frequently takes refuge in stereotyped phrases which arouse emotional response in the individuals of the group because they have what might be called a "herd complex" on this subject. Campaign slogans of political parties are apt to be of this character. On the other hand, there is a desire for new experiences, and it is this reaching out for novel environmental contacts which leads the thinker into new fields of investigation of discovery. The interaction between these sometimes con flicting modes of action, the tendency towards standard ization and the movement towards variability, is further complicated by the fact that all organisms, except parasites, are centers of complexes of energies, which are quanti tatively greater in amount than is necessary for the imme diate demands of the environment, i. e., maintaining an existence. We sometimes expend this super-abundance of energy by trying to impose our own accepted systems of beliefs upon others. Such individuals are known as re formers, and they are apt to make themselves obnoxious to others who believe in the laissez-faire doctrine so far as</page><page sequence="10">go THE MONIST this particular subject is concerned. What this energy is which, in us, constitutes the moving power behind what optimists choose to call progress is an inscrutible and hence a fascinating mystery. Jung's conception is that of a pri mal energy of life, which is the living power of man's cre ative desires and interests. Bergson's conception of the vital impetus (?lan vital) is somewhat similar. From a scientific (mechanistic) point of view, life, or living proto plasm, like yeast, is a fermentation of chemical elements, and the only difference between man and more primitive or less differentiated aggregates of colloids is that we have fermented to the extent of effervescence, and this bub bling over we call art, science and culture. In any event, we are beings who must believe something ?one can not even be a consistent sceptic, for the sceptic must at least believe that he does not believe. Our beliefs may range from the lower limit where we have what, adopting a phrase from Santayana, we may call an animal faith in the existence of an external world, to the highly elaborate Weltanschauung which Bertrand Russell attrib utes to the system making vanity of the philosophers. Between these two limits we find all sorts and degrees of belief. On the whole it is found that the process of creating beliefs is so engaging that it is indulged in to the limit, and the limit is the amount of mental energy which the individual cares to expend. Really consistent think ing, however, is hard work, for the checks and obstacles which facts put in the way of intellectual progress is baf fling and discouraging. It takes only one nasty little fact to kill a beautiful theory, as Huxley somewhere says, and this is the tragedy of all scientific and philosophic thought. And why are we thus relentlessly driven on towards goals, all-inclusive explanations, which we can never hope to reach ? Without doubt, one of the greatest incentives to effort in research is the desire for social recognition. This</page><page sequence="11">FOSSILS OF THE MIND 91 may drive a thinker deliberately to formulate a theory which appears radical because it singles its proponent out from his colleagues, or the mass of people who constitute the conservatives on that subject. On the other hand, there is a genuine quality of intellectual honesty which sometimes leads to revolutionary ideas which are real advances. Einstein's theory of relativity must be reckoned as such an advance. The love of knowledge for its own sake, the disinterested interest in the "particular go" of things, without reference to the monetary and practical value of results is perhaps the greatest gift to the human mind. It is the Promethian fire of the intellect which lifts man to the stars. It is conceivable that one of the worst forms of torture is to feel the surge of creative energies, seeking some form of expression, without finding an en vironment wherein the products of genius are recognized. The explanation of the one-sided development of talent, which is frequently to be found in genius, lies, perhaps, in the inheritance of mental traits, a doctrine which genetics is in process of establishing. This may also throw light upon the rather rare type of individual who is radical on one subject and conservative on others. On the whole, people who are born heretics and dissenters are non-con formists on most subjects, but there are individuals who rebel only against a particular system of dogmas. It is difficult here to separate the hereditary from the environ mental factors, and there is still question as to the mecha nism of the inheritance of mental traits, but if the same Mendelian principles hold which obtain on the levels of strictly biological inheritance (color of the eyes, etc.) then these special abilities (musical, mathematical ability, etc.) behave as "unit characters," more or less independently of each other. It is not strange, therefore, that versatile individuals with a wide range of interests and exceptional abilities in diverse lines should be so rare.</page><page sequence="12">92 THE MONIST This may also account for the tendency which people in general have of keeping their various systems of beliefs in water-tight compartments; so that, for instance, one's scientific beliefs do not flow over into and inffuence one's religious convictions. Personality, as a unified and well rounded out individuality, constituted of a variety of inter ests and a rich sense of values subordinated to dominant rational purposes, is not a gift, but an achievement. In short, many persons are not individualities ; they are soci eties of selves, with conflicting impulses tending to disin tegrate their individuality into a lunatic asylum of dishar monious clusters of alter-egos. In order to hold firm convictions one must be impervi ous, to some extent, to other points of view. Those who have written theses "in defense of prejudice" recognize that prejudices are necessary and justifiable, up to a cer tain limit which is hard to define. Liberalism, or the tol eration of any and every doctrine and creed, is sometimes only a symptom of shallowness. The dogmatist is one who drains all his mental energies into one channel of thought. His beliefs get so ossified that he can not understand how any one can disagree with him. A mind may become more resistent than steel to the impact of novel ideas. All re formers are persons who have become obsessed with ideas ?they are mono-ideaists. I do not use the word in a derog atory sense. Reformers are necessary?did not even Soc rates compare himself to a gadfly? If their ideas run in the direction of a clamor for the "good old days," they are examples of arrested mental development. If their ideas are so new that they are rejected in their own age, but accepted in subsequent ages, they are prophets and geniuses. The dogmatist is apt to become a fanatic, i. e., one who is dominated by fixed ideas. The liberal, because of his wider range of experience and his more permeable nervous system, is not so walled up in his universe of be</page><page sequence="13">FOSSILS OF THE MIND 93 liefs, and is therefore more susceptible to new ideas. If we must choose between fanatical dogmatists and unprin cipled liberals, the liberals must be preferred, for more harm is done by well-meaning but misguided reformers than by unscrupulous intellectuals. To understand any individual's system of beliefs one must understand his social environment?the socially in herited system of beliefs, customs and practices of the cul ture epoch. Considering in addition to the social forces the individual components of belief and conduct, it is obvi ous that the problem of the interrelations of the two be come almost too complex to handle. The difficulties are increased when it comes to analyzing these components which are known as beliefs, ideas, concepts, feelings, etc. The question of whether personality is nothing more than the biologically inherited modes of response (reflexes, in stincts, etc.) as modified by experience (environmental in fluences) is one which always invites disputation; again illustrating differences of temperament and training. Recent research on the influence of the secretions of the ductless glands (i. e., the endocrine glands, which dis charge their harmones or "chemical messengers" directly into the blood stream) suggests that the whole organic apparatus controlled by the autonomie nervous system (i. e., the whole mechanism of the "sympathetic" nervous sys tem, the glands, and the "smooth muscles," all of which are concerned in the expression of the emotions) must be taken into account in any theory of personality. However, the fact that we do not ordinarily attribute much person ality to guinea-pigs, which are, so far as glands are con cerned, about as well-equipped as human beings, indicates the extremes to which the glandular theory of personality may be carried?especially by the popularizers of psychol ogy and the hangers-on of psychoanalysis. While it is cer tainly an exaggeration to say that famous military leaders</page><page sequence="14">94 THE MONIST failed to conquer the world because, perchance, of a hyper activity of the pineal gland, or a failure to function nor mally of the pituitary body, or what-not, the fact that it is possible in some types of cases of arrested development to appreciably raise the "intelligence quotient" of an indi vidual by feeding him thyroid preparation, or some other glandular extract, is a matter of such importance that it puts the hormones (a better term is "autocoids") in the class with enzymes and vitamins as chemical regulators of bodily metabolism and mental behavior. V With the rise of the sciences of ethnology, anthropology and sociology the study of the primitive mind has taken on added significance, for with the progressive discovery of the missing links between primitive cultures and more modern civilizations it is being more clearly established that the human mind as we know it today has somehow evolved from the sub-human mind. The literature on this subject is large, and still growing. One of the few bene ficial results of the war is the renewed interest in history and human culture. Historical method has been applied to the comparative study of religion, and results in this field throw light upon tihe psychological motivations of religions, not only of primitive cultures, but also of religions of today. Taking primitive religion as a subject, it is our purpose in the fol lowing section to analyze the historical and psychological origins of this fossil of mental evolution from the view point of paleo-psychology. Primitive man's speculations concerning the world are embodied in the system of thought known as animism. It is the belief in a living or vital force, which is the source</page><page sequence="15">FOSSILS OF THE MIND 95 and sustainer of all the varied phenomena of nature. This notion that everything is alive and pervaded by a spirit is sometimes known as pan-biotism. Man spills his super abundant vital energies over into the events and processes surrounding him, and personifies what we now take to be the material forces of nature. The universal life or breath pervading all things is indi viduated, so that specific activities come to be the expres sion of particular personal powers. This is the origin of the gods of mythology. Storms and catastrophes are the expression of the anger of the gods. An arrow does not fly straight because it is possessed by an evil spirit. These beings, however, can be controlled to some extent by magic, sacrifices, prayer, and even threats. But religion for primitive man is something more than a system of beliefs about the causes of natural phenomena. It is known that religious practices are also to be regarded as a means for controlling the behavior of the group with reference to the needs and ends which are most insistently felt by the group. Primitive group solidarity appears in the conception of sin, which, at this stage, is not so much a falling short of ideals as it is a ritualistic breach or viola tion of external forms. The gods, like conscience in man, is the "echo of the tribal self," and crystallizes the mores or customs of the group. But whatever the humble origin of the religious attitude, it is evident that men are not usually content to worship gods of moral character inferior to themselves. This stage is illustrated in the philosophy of the Greeks, who criticized the ethical ideals of the gods of Olympus, as popularly conceived, and as pictured by the poets of the time. Religions may therefore be placed higher or lower in the scale, accordingly as they have been sub mitted to rationalizing, sublimating and purifying influ ences. Thus, it is generally agreed that monotheism repre</page><page sequence="16">96 THE MONIST sents a higher stage of religious thought than pagan poly theism, or the henotheism of the ancient Hebrews. The attempt to control by magic the forces of nature is the origin of what later developed into science. Animism is the only kind of analysis at the disposal of primitive man. But as the analysis of the phenomena of nature con tinued, the supernatural element gradually dropped out. Causal relationships were depersonalized. In time, astron omy replaced astrology and chemistry superceded alchemy. It is only recently that biology has banished the vital forces which it inherited from the animistic view of nature. The result is that the external world is now conceived as a vast mechanism, devoid of all the richness and beauty we think we perceive in nature, and man stands alone in the stupen dous universe of space, time, and matter as a conscious, reasoning, loving, fearing, and aspiring being. The para dox of modern science is the attempt on the part of the mechanistic behaviorists in psychology to apply this capac ity for reason to the problem of the reduction of man to the level of the material universe of meaningless and un reasoning tractations and pellations of electrons and pro tons in space. Those who do not believe that this reduction is feasible or legitimate are apt to interpose the question : Why should natural processes be personified by the primitive animistic philosopher? How can external forces be considered as the objectification of intelligent living forces if man him self be but a complicated sum of physiological processes? In the words of T. H. Green, is not any philosophy inade quate which ignores the philosopher himself? It is the common belief among men of science that the notion of force originated in the sense of effort which all experience in doing work, or accomplishing results by overcoming resistences. If animism or vital dynamism arises out of the externalization of the sense of human activity, the sense</page><page sequence="17">FOSSILS OF THE MIND 97 of effort projected out into the objective world, does not this testify to the existence within the human being of an active mental agent of which muscular activity is but the bodily expression ? The scientist, insofar as he theorizes about the ultimate explanation of the phenomena with which he is concerned, is likely to adopt the position which may be termed physi cal monism. Without trying rigorously to define this term, which must vary in its connotation with the varying con ceptions concerning the nature of the ultimate elements of the physical universe, we may note that it implies that all processes involving transformations of energy follow the principle of the conservation of energy. As the histori cal continuation of what is known as materialism, this doc trine asserts that every form of behavior, whether in the organic or the inorganic realms, is the expression of a law which states that all activity proceeds in the line of least resistence, or obeys the principle of least action, and that the supposed exceptions to this rule are only apparently so. Consequently, the subjective feeling of effort is not a viola tion of this principle. The sense of activity, of surmount ing obstacles by an effort of the will, is the sum-total of the kinaesthetic sensations, or sensations of muscle strain, which accompany all bodily activity. There are definite sense organs, known as "interocep tors" and "proprioceptors," which receive and transmit these impulses of tension, effort and strain. For a mate rialistic psychologist the idea of self-activity, or "freedom of the will," is a delusion. However, the mechanist in psy chology, or one who believes in the universal application of the doctrine of physical monism, must give an explana tion of the origin of animism, and he must account for the present misconceptions of popular psychology, that we pos sess a mind, if he is to complete his theory and make it plausible. Without committing ourselves to it, the follow</page><page sequence="18">98 THE MONIST ing is presented as a monistic explanation of the origin of the belief in a non-biological or supernatural principle in human beings, the soul, self, or mind, which monistic account would be acceptable to the psychologist who would reject these concepts as symbolic of realities, but who would admit them as historically real products of the evo lution of thought. VI The problem we have before us is this: assuming, ten tatively, that the particular biological variation we know as man is nothing but a physiological machine for convert ing stimuli into reactions, how can we explain the origin, in this organism, of the idea that he possesses what he calls a mind, with attributes entirely different from those which are known to be attached to the physiological mechanisms of behavior ? How, in a word, can physiological processes give rise to the conception of, and swear by the reality of, non-physiological processes ? First of all, it must be noted that many of the theories and practices of primitive man, with his anthropomorphic conceptions of causal relationships, seemed plausible and efficacious to him because they are based upon a defective logic. This period with which we are dealing has been called the pre-logical stage by Levy-Bruhl. Most of the superstitions and religious and magical practices of primi tive man are the result of errors of logic which are tech nically known as the fallacy of false cause, the neglect of negative instances, and argument by analogy. The processes of reasoning by analogy has been the most disastrous of all the illogical procedures whereby the mind falls into error. An outstanding example of its fallacious application is to be found in the very natural personification</page><page sequence="19">FOSSILS OF THE MIND 99 of the forces of nature, once the idea of the soul had been conceived to explain the actions of man himself. By anal ogy with the cause of human behavior, primitive man argued that anything which behaved anything like a human being was animated by a Ka, or pneuma, or spirit, or mana, which was alive. If a stone fell from a cliff and killed a man it was because it was possessed by a spirit. Xerxes, preparing to cross the Hellespont, finds the sea rough. What is his natural response ? He orders the slave to give the sea a hundred lashes. The argument her^e rests upon the following inference: motion or activity is a sign of life; therefore, everything which moves is alive. It was only by ignoring exceptions to accidental coinci dences, or explaining away the negative instances which called into question these superstitious beliefs, that primi tive man could preserve his faith in the good old religion of his forefathers. And it was only in the school of expe rience that man subsequently built up the methodological processes or system of scientific inference which enables him to avoid committing what now seem to us such elemen tary logical blunders. However, thus far, we have assumed that the animistic view of the universe presupposes the reality of a spirit within man without the externalization of which it would be impossible for man to ensoul the choir of the heavens and furniture of the earth. We have not yet accounted for the origin of the notion of the soul in man, which is to be projected out into the forms and events of the objective universe. To be able to account for the origin of animism on monis tic principles it is necessary to assume that primitive man had to have a theory of behavior, and that an organism with a theory of behavior has the advantage over an organ ism without a theory of behavior. A theory, in this case, is simply a tentative plan of action. The possessor can</page><page sequence="20">THE MONIST thereby anticipate what his fellow creatures are going to do, and act accordingly. To be able to predict what your friend or enemy is going to do involves observation and interpretation of what other creatures have already done under similar circumstances. The possibility of this analy sis, wherever it may have first occurred in the misty morn ing of the intellect ages ago, and whatever its biological conditions may have been, whether in the ape-man of the preglacial period, the Java, Foxhall, Heidelberg, Piltdown, or the Neanderthal man, all of whom lived from 500,000 to 100,000 years ago, or whether this capacity for analysis and synthesis took its origin still more recently, in the post glacial period, in the Cromagnon man, who roamed the plains and inhabited the caves of Western Europe only 25,000 years ago?whatever the time and place of the ori gin of the tendency to explain and predict, it must be recog nized that at this stage in evolution a new principle of selection was substituted in the struggle for existence. A new instrument, reason, involving memory and creative imagination, from thenceforth gradually replaced the older factors of survival ; and sharp teeth, powerful muscles, and mere size and sheer weight yielded to the most mighty and subtle of nature's creations, the ne?ncephalon or cerebral hemispheres of the big-brained mammals. Very wrell, then, here we have primitive man, with a tendency to cogitate and to explain things. Why did the explanation take the form known as animism? What are the phenomena which suggest this explanation of nature and of human nature? All students of the subject agree that one of the most important factors in the construction of the animistic ex planation is the phenomenon of dreams. In dream life primitive man's friends or enemies appeared before him; but the bodies of his fellow men were known to be miles away. Similarly, he himself could visit his friends or ene</page><page sequence="21">FOSSILS OF THE MIND mies while his body remained stationary. Human beings, he was forced to argue, must therefore possess a duplicate of the visible body, which must be of a finer stuff because it is more nimble and elusive than material bodies. And this subtle replica is not subject to the ordinary limitations of time or space. Having no idea of the actual physiological bases of dreams, primitive man interpreted what we now know to be conditions of our own ordinarily invisible nervous sys tems, but about which he had no information, in terms of visual and memory images. Shadows, images of himself in pools of water, etc., helped to confirm the idea of a breathlike double of the body, though this duplicate was still conceived as semi-material. This soul-body can move around and go on journeys while the waking body is inac tive. In death this more nimble manikin fails to return from its wanderings. Another characteristic of primitive thought is the tend ency to regard all processes or functions as entities. Sick ness, stomachache or headaches are now held to be dis turbances of the normal functioning of bodily processes. Primitive man made entities out of these disarrangements of function?he "hypostatized" forms of behavior. Disease and insanity were regarded as obsessions, and the way to get rid of them was through magic incantations and exor cism. Thus, a headache is due to the presence in the head of a spirit, causing a disturbance because it can not get out ?unless, as was done in some primitive groups, the skull was trephined to provide an opening. A similar belief is found in the Greek myth that Minerva sprang full-armed from the aching brain of Jupiter. Primitive therapeutic practices still survive among present-day "mental healers," and for that matter, psychoanalytic treatment is not so far removed from the ancient practice of "casting out devils." In this way, processes, functional relationships, and forms</page><page sequence="22">I02 THE MONIST of behavior are treated as things or entities; the mind is conceived as a thing, by analogy with other things. On the whole, we may affirm that primitive man materializes what later people regard as spiritual, and spiritualizes what physical science has taught us are the material forces of nature. Once having arrived at the conception of the soul, the endowing of all the phenomena of nature with a spirit was natural. The idea of an ethereal, but still attenuated materiaj, duplicate of the body was ejected into the be haviors of the objective world (trees, winds, clouds, streams, etc.) because there Was no other explanation available. Why animism was an inevitable stage in the evolution of human thought is not difficult to show. Other human beings are the natural environment of man, primi tive or modern. People are gregarious, and live in groups. Man is a social animal, as Aristotle puts it. Reactions to other human beings are therefore the habitual modes of response. The personification of the forces of nature is due to the tendency to react to unfamiliar objects or events with the old familiar set of responses, the habitual adjust ments, man employs in response to other individuals. Anim ism is this tendency to respond to things as persons. That there still lurks within us this same cave-man is demonstrated by our similar tendency to respond to things as persons. Anything which offers resistence to our deter minations is regarded as endowed with a personal spirit of opposition and rebellion, and we heap invectives upon the evil spirit which animates its unruly behavior. Moreover, we still find in nature the reflection of our own subjective states. A sunset is beautiful ; a rainy day is sombre?and so on; but, of course, beauty and melancholy and joy are not in the objects, but in us. Aesthetic appreciation is based upon this tendency to read our own subjective personal states and affective dispositions into disinterested nature.</page><page sequence="23">FOSSILS OF THE MIND Poets speak of the "slumbering sword," or how the "moun tain lifted up its shoulder," and these expressions inspire a thrill in us because they bring these objects nearer to us, to our own feelings and experiences. Empathy is the tech nical name given to this tendency to humanize things. Religion, likewise, protests against the arid intellectual ism of science, and the devastating analysis which reduces nature to a vast, senseless whirl of atoms and electrons, combining, separating and recombining in meaningless configurations of mass particles in space. Is there no per manent meaning continuous with the cosmic order, lend ing spiritual significance to the universal processes? Is there no Ariadne's thread running through the tapestry of evolution, no pattern of design, certifying that man's valu ations of worth, sacrifices for the future, and affirmation of a higher reality interpenetrating what seem to be the soul-less mechanisms of the universe, are of permanent significance? Is not man himself more than an alien and inexplicable excrecence in a meaningless universe supremely indifferent to human aspirations?a universe which is destined in a brief span of time to swallow up in some cosmic calamity, or return to the primitive star-dust, this rebel who but disturbs for a moment the universal silence of the great Unconscious? VII Since the epoch of primitive thought the idea of the soul has undergone an evolution. Many layers of ideas have added their strata to the earlier fossils of mental growth. Insofar as the idea of the soul has not been given up entirely, the principle contrast between the modern notion and the primitive conception lies in this : whereas in primi tive animism the soul is conceived as quasi-material, the</page><page sequence="24">I04 THE MONIST modern doctrine on the contrary, holds the soul to be non spatial and non-material. This distinction was introduced by Descartes, though the problem of the relation between the soul and the body appears in Greek philosophy. Appar ently, the early Hebrews entertained no conception of an immortal soul, and, without doubt, many Greek ideas have crept into the doctrine of soul imputed by theologians to New Testament scriptures. Why, we may ask, should the idea of the soul have un dergone evolution ? One might well argue that the desire for immortality, whatever its psychic motivations, is one of the factors responsible for the sublimation of the idea of the soul. That is, in order to guarantee the possibility of its continued existence after the death of the mortal body, the soul had to be dematerialized, for if it were material it would be subject to the same laws of disintegration and decay to which all physical bodies are subject. One of the most interesting and important aspects of the evolution of thought within historical times is the de velopment of the animistic conception into the doctrine which has been variously designated as two-worldism, dualistic supernaturalism, or the pre?volutionary view of man and morality. The social and moral consequences of this view have been most profound. The dualism of the eternal and perfect universe set over against the imper fect world of change, of a higher world of the spirit opposed to a lower world controlled by a principle of evil, was first enunciated in Western thought by Plato. Form ing the background of Christian theology, the views of Plato and Aristotle have entered into the very texture of Occidental thought, blending into the Scholastic system a corresponding ethical, psychological and political pattern of ideas. That this is not a matter of purely theoretical or histori cal interest, and that one's theory of mind and of human</page><page sequence="25">FOSSILS OF THE MIND IO5 conduct does have practical educational and social impli cations is familiar to all who are versed in the history of pedagogy. The classical cultural theory of education was based upon the psychological doctrine of "faculty psychol ogy," with its concomitant conceptions of "transfer of training," and the doctrine of "formal discipline." Simi larly, and more relevantly to our own immediate prob lem, the supernaturalistic dualism of a higher and a lower nature in man, had immediate social consequences. The theory that the animal appetites constitute the lower nature of man, which must be repressed and strangled as part of the world, the flesh and the devil, has, for better or for worse, established taboos from which we may never be freed. That this ethical dualism is the logical consequent of the psychological dualism established by animism is, I be lieve, reasonably self-evident. From a slightly different angle, another social consequence of the ethical correlates of the intuitionistic theory of conscience, or the doctrine of innate moral ideas, is to substitute a blind obedience to abstract rules of conduct, grounded in a world of eternally fixed standards, for an intelligent morality which finds the sanctions for conduct in the concrete consequences of one's acts upon other human beings. However, the most irrep arable damage wrought by the pre?volutionary concep tions of two-worldism is the notion that matter is a prin ciple of evil. The doctrine that matter is evil, which appears in medi eval monasticism, and which reappears in the degenerate Berkleyan idealism of Christian Science, is but the noisome aroma still lingering over the decaying corpse of ancient puritanism. From the point of view of paleo-psychology this doctrine is one of the fossils of the mind, a petrified form deposited in the evolution of the human intellect, which should have remained buried in the earlier strata of</page><page sequence="26">6 THE MONIST mental development, but which has been uncovered and bowed to by those atavistic worshippers who are unable to distinguish archeological stones from the true bread of life. VIII In the preceding pages I have tried to show how inevit able animism and two worldism were in the development of human thought; and that these doctrines must have pos sessed intellectual survival value in the age of their incep tion, whatever their worth may now be ; that the evolution of human thought could not have been other than it was; and that our problems today, moral, intellectual and social, are what they are because of their historical settings. This manner of regarding our ideas as systems of adaptations to the physical, social and intellectual environments sug gests a number of observations, which bear upon the pres ent conflict of ideas. Since the "group mind" usually tends to cling to the cultural heritage of the past, we must look to the individual, who alone formulates creative conceptions, to initiate the new idea-complexes which make moral and intellectual progress possible. But our educational systems and social mechanisms must not only be adapted to facilitate the progress of the gifted student, and to provide opportunities for the expression of the capacities of exceptionally en dowed individualities?though, of course, here in America there is much need for the greater recognition of the supe rior ability of the trained expert?but our emphasis should also fall more upon the need for that flexibility of mind, and adaptability to novel ideas, which is necessary in the adjustment to the new and complex problems which have developed out of the growth of nationalism, the advent of the industrial revolution, with all its economic and social</page><page sequence="27">FOSSILS OF THE MIND IO7 problems, and the growth of the sciences, the results of which seem to throw in doubt many of the traditional notions supporting the religious idealism of the age. This does not imply that we must disregard the spiritual and cultural heritage of the human race, or that we are to look with pity or contempt upon any system of thought which appears archaic and outworn to our own enlight ened age of self-conceit. What we need is a more disin terested interest in the achievements of the mind, a more artistic attitude towards the products of the culture of other ages and races. Such an appreciative attitude does not sap our enthusiasm for the art, literature or intellectual and religious accomplishments of other cultures, but rather enhances our interest in them. From this point of view, the history of civilization is the march of the mind through time. It is the story of minds with the passion to create; of minds feeling the need to give expression to the yearning to mold the world a little closer to the heart's desire ; of minds ever in quest of some golden fleece or holy grail; of minds on fire with ideas which would make a funeral pyre of the unjust social order, and replace it with Utopia; of minds which, Icarus-wise, attempt to fly to that City of the Sun, which, it seems, is always to remain the Promised Land; of minds which, tentatively exploring the shoals of the universe, are event ually drawn outward to depths which do not answer to the soundings of our plumbs. Such an aesthetic interest and delight in the panorama of human thought averts the catastrophe which results from tying up our moral idealism with a system of belief involving the literal acceptance of any system of creeds as absolute truth, once for all revealed. By moral idealism is meant the faith in the possibility of the creation, through intelligent and enterprising good-will, of a better order of things here on earth, and the hope that we are all co?p</page><page sequence="28">8 THE MONIST erating in the realization of some pervasive, intelligible scheme of things, however inscrutable it may appear in stellar evolution, and dimly it may be foreshadowed in the ascent from amoeba to man. Thus viewed, the binding of the ethical teachings of Jesus to theological conceptions of a geocentric universe and an anthropomorphic interpreta tion of nature has been a detour in moral progress. From a broader point of view, however, this movement of thought arises as an inevitable conflict of the various forces within man himself, a conflict the resolution of which will, in time, transform both scientific and religious conceptions. We are living in a creative and evolving universe, and no system of dogmas can be regarded as final. For this reason, no attempt has been made to lay the foundations for that structure of beliefs which we must all labor to create, if we are to live effectively in a universe teeming with problems which challenge our adventurous minds. That there still exist intellectual problems, as such, in addition to the problems of applied science and social mal adjustment is clear. After all is said, it is evident that no analysis of the historical and psychological origins of ideas, whether the idea of the aether of space of the physicist, or the concept of mind of the psychologist, or the notion of God, freedom, and immortality of the religionist, will tell us much about the truth or falsity of the belief in the sup posed realities which these ideas are held to symbolize. We have heard much within the last few years concerning the salvaging of civilization?but the previous question still remains to be asked: If man is what some materialistic physicists and a greater number of mechanistic psychol ogists assert that he is, are man and society worth "salvaging" ? The test of the logical consistency and workability of any ethical system is its theory of social obligation. Every moral theory must provide an answer to this question:</page><page sequence="29">fossils of the mind IO9 Why should one be good, if by disregarding the rights and interests of others one can thereby increase his own private gain ? On the one hand, idealistic moralists proclaim that no generation of thinkers has been satisfied with a mate rialistic philosophy, and that it is absurd to suppose that one can get a theory of personal responsibility and social obligation out of mechanistic psychology. On the other hand, the behaviorist may argue that it is only because ethical theory has traditionally been tied up with some form of supernaturalism that it seems impossible to base a categorical morality on physical monism. From this point of view the vituperations which those who hold that the universe is controlled by "spiritual values" hurl against "crass" materialism only beg the question in appealing to an inherited prejudice?the old superstition that matter is inherently evil. Indeed, Jacques Loeb, prince of mecha nists, was not content to remain on the defensive, and, no doubt, his followers will push forward with increasing audacity along the lines of advance which he opened up. I do not propose to attempt to resolve this great paradox which must inevitably arise in the course of the evolution of the human organism. Oliver L. Reiser. Ohio State University.</page></plain_text>
