<plain_text><page sequence="1">AN EPITOME OF TH:E SYNTHETIC PHILOSOPHY. By F. HOWARD COLLINS. With an Introduction by HERBERT SPENCER. Williams and Norgate. 1889. THE origin of this volume, which will be to many a valuable com pendium of the Spencerian philosophy as a whole, is frankly dis closed in the first words of the preface. "After spending several years in the self-imposed task of making indexes to my books, Mr. F. HOWARD COLLINS volunteered to make an epitome of The Syn thetic Philosophy; and asked me whether, if an epitome were satisfactorily made, I would agree to the publication of it. After some hesitation I consented." It is, therefore, a faithful piece of discipleship which this painstaking volume offers to the philo sophic reader-a kind of extended index or outline map of the vast regions of Mr. HERBERT SPENCER'S metaphysics. Mr. Collins himself describes the method of his five years' work. " The object of the volume is to give in a condensed form the general principles of Mr. Herbert Spencer's philosophy as far as possible in his own words. In order to carry out this intention, each section has been reduced, with but few exceptions, to one-tenth; the 5,000 and more pages of the original being thus represented by a little over 500." The Epitome, therefore, represents the original, as he hopes, " as it would be seen through a diminishing glass, the original proportion holding between all its varied parts." To review such a book adequately would be to review the Spencerian philosophy itself; and apart from the fact that our columns are hardly the place for such an undertaking, it may be doubted whether the time has not already gone by. The First Principles were published long ago, if we measure not in years but in the movement of thought. The keynote which the present redaction strikes in the headnote to its first chapter recalls us -vividly to the change of the world's attitude; for it claims that the famous doctrine of "the unknowable" is but a better expression of the views developed by Mansel and Sir Wm. Hamilton. It is as if one talked of the thinkers of the Middle Ages. And in truth the whole reasoning of these earlier sections of the book forces on one all the while the conviction that in it!a essence and logic it is pre-Kantian. It is the last of the many vain attempts to construct a philosophy of the universe of being upon that old untenable theory of knowledge which Locke left to English thinkers as a damnosissima hereditas. Berkeley, Hume, Hamilton, the Mills, and Mr. Herbert Spencer, and a hundred men of less leading, have been crippled by these old fallacies,-always recurring in some new and subtle form, of which Locke's " tabula rasa" was the beginning. Doubtless the faithful followers of Mill or of Spencer would deny it, and would believe the modern tendency to prescribe a careful appreciation of Kant as a "prole gomenon of any future metaphysic" to be a sort of demented obscurantism. Nevertheless, there is but little doubt that this most careful and excellent handbook to Spencerianism finds its philosopher already a little out of date. Such criticisms, in any case, would apply only to what we have ventured to call the metaphysical part of the system. The scientific side of it must be judged by another standard; and, indeed, the whole scheme of articulated theories, biological, psychological, and sociological, commands the respect which is due to a great conception of the ordered unity of things. Every such effort cannot but advance, even by its failures, the work of</page><page sequence="2">Jan. 4, 190.] THE BRIT1SH MEDICAL JOURNAL. 2X science. The bewildering range of paragraphs suggests at once all the fields of controversy open to modern thought. The data of ethics, the nature and office of the state, the relation between mind and body, the history of religion-all these and many more are but incidents in the encyclopaedic progress through which Mr. Collins follows his master. Throughout, the statement, if summary, is lucid, and it is not infrequentlythe case that the condensation makes the logic easier to follow than the cumbrous elaboration of the original. To one point of special interest at the moment we may call attention. In the synopsis of the Principles of Biology will be found in its due place Mr. Spencer's general statement of the "evolution hypothesis." Reading it again in the light of the later dis cussions, one is struck with two things: In the first place, evo lution, in the Spencerian sense, is opposed to nothing except what he calls the " special creation hypothesis," which means a very anthropomorphic view of things, representing the Creator as making organisms separately without any coherence at all. In the second place, evolution itself is a very wide word. It means merely " the production of all organic forms by the slow accu mulation of modifications upon modifications, and by the slow divergencies resulting from the continual addition of differences to differences." There are very few people nowadays, even among the most orthodox, who would not accept this formula, especially when it is supplemented by the other admission that this hypothesis as well as the other "implies an inscrutable Cause." In this, as in other things, the appearance of a bare but accurate summary of the Spencerian dogmas will serve a useful purpose if it brings busy people back to a consideration of the general principles which underlie all their thinking, but which are too apt to be either assumed without precision of statement, or practically forgotten in the immedia.e urgency of details.</page></plain_text>
