<plain_text><page sequence="1">Behaviorism and the Philosophy of the Act' LAIRD ADDIS THE UNIVERSITY OF IOWA An adequate philosophy of mind must satisfy a number of criteria. The two most important among them are, first, that it take account of and be entirely consistent with the phenomenological data; and, second, that it accord with both the presuppositions and the findings of sci- entific psychology. Many philosophers as well as many philosophically-minded psychologists have believed that it is impossi- ble at once to satisfy both of these criteria-at least as their require- ments are widely interpreted. Consider two notable examples. The psychologistJohn Watson believed that the requirements of a scientific psychology imply the denial of the efficacy and possibly the very existence of private mental states. Denying the existence or the efficacy of private mental states is inconsistent with the phenomenological data. The philosopher Jean-Paul Sartre believed that an adequate phenomenology of the mind implies the impossibility of the causal explanation of human behavior. Asserting the impossibility of the causal explanation of human behavior is not in accord with the presup- positions of scientific psychology. Among the relatively few philosophers and psychologists who were moved by the impulse to account fully for the phenomenological data were a yet smaller number who defended the act. The most elaborate analysis and defense of the act among twentieth-century analytic philosophers is to be found in the writings of Gustav Bergmann.2 Yet Bergmann is also known as one who, as a logical positivist, helped to develop and defend the philosophy of psychology known as behaviorism.3 Behaviorism and the philosophy of the act: the dearth of those who would defend both is almost intimidating to one who, like myself, agrees with Bergmann that both must be defended. Indeed, I believe that behaviorism and the philosophy of the act alone jointly satisfy the requirements of a scientific psychology and of respect for the phenomenological data, respectively. The historical tension that has existed between scientific psychol- ogy in general and behaviorism, in particular, on the one hand, and dualistic philosophy of mind in general and the philosophy of the act, 399</page><page sequence="2">400 NOUS in particular, on the other is without doubt based on the belief that there is a logical tension between the two. And as the ideas of each are often presented, it is not surprising that there should appear to be such a tension. Yet more careful analysis shows, I believe, that there is no incompatibility whatsoever between behaviorism and the philosophy of the act. In the remarks that follow it will be my primary intention to show that that iS SO. I shall proceed as follows: First, I shall discuss behaviorism, distin- guishing what is from what is not important in it from a philosophical point of view. Second, I shall show what behaviorism presupposes about the relation of mind to body. Third, I shall do some very selective history of the philosophy of the act, trying to show how it came to be seen as incompatible with the notion of a scientific psychology. Forth, I shall sketch and defend the philosophy of the act, with heavy emphasis on Bergmann's particular version of it. And fifth and finally, I shall show precisely how the philosophy of the act complements behavior- ism. Behaviorism is a methodological approach to the study of human behavior that assumes that, in principle, every behavior has a full, lawful explanation that does not require mention of the realm of the mental. Or, to put it somewhat more technically: A complete set of relevant, independent variables for the lawful explanation of behavior exists among the physical variables alone.4 Like any other occurrence, a behavior is given afull, lawful explanation if and only if initial condi- tions and laws are cited such that whenever and wherever precisely those conditions obtain, by those laws that precise behavior does or would occur. It is important to understand for a point that will be stressed in the next section that, like any other occurence, one and the same piece of behavior may have more than one full, lawful explana- tion. That will be so in one sense if certain different initial conditions from those that actually did obtain would also have brought about the behavior to be explained. But the sense I wish to stress here is some- what different: that from among the conditions that actually did ob- tain, more than one subset is such that by the laws of nature whenever and wherever it occurs, the behavior of the kind to be explained occurs. If, for example, a, b, c and d are four conditions such that condition c occurs if and only if condition d occurs, and if a, b, and c constitute a set of conditions that fully explain the occurrence of s6me given behavior, then a, b, and d also constitute such a set. Either of these senses may be expressed by saying that there may be more than one (minimum) complete set of relevant variables.</page><page sequence="3">BEHAVIORISM &amp; THE PHILOSOPHY OF THE ACT 401 It is evident then that what I shall call thefundamental assumption of behaviorism-that the mental variables need not be taken into account in the full, lawful explanation of behavior-does not imply that the mental variables cannot be invoked in the explanation of behavior. It would also appear to be evident-the reason for my caution will be- come clear momentarily-that this fundamental assumption is a very general, empirical hypothesis; for what is lawfully connected with what, and in what manner, is always a matter of fact and never one of meaning or of logic or of values. That it is an empirical matter is reinforced by the observation that, in the opinion of many, it is a hypothesis that is patently at odds with our everyday experience of the way in which our minds and bodies affect each other. But it will be granted, even by the most hardline of positivists, that even if it is an empirical hypothesis ultimately, it is one that, since it does involve presuppositions about the nature of mind and its relation to body, naturally recommends itself to philosophical reflection and clarifica- tion. But is the fundamental assumption really an empirical hypothesis after all? One might be led to believe from the writings of the logical positivists including Bergmann that behaviorism can be defended philosophically not merely as a consistent and possibly true hypothesis about how certain variables do and do not lawfully connect with one another, but, much more radically, as the only "hypothesis" that is even meaningful, all others being ruled out as being non-empirical. This is what, very roughly, was meant by the idea of logical behaviorism. Still roughly, the theory, as expounded in Ayer's Language, Truth, and Logic and elsewhere, is that the very notion of an unobservable variable that interacts which any of the set of observable variables is unintelligible, whether that unobservable be (the property of) an atom, or a god or a mind. Obviously, this very crude account disregards a world of differ- ences. Put a little less crudely and with the essentials of the argument, the reasoning was as follows: In order for any descriptive predicate notion to have empirical content (and thus to be eligible for appearance in scientific contexts), it must either refer directly to a property that is observable or else be wholly (or in some versions only partially) defina- ble by predicates for such properties. Since the mental variables, con- sidered as properties of private mental states, are not (publicly) observ- able, their corresponding predicates either are not to be admitted to systematic scientific discourse at all or else must be "defined" by predi- cates that refer only to publicly observable-that is, physical and espec- ially behavioral-properties. So it was made to appear that the funda- mental assumption of behaviorism is guaranteed by philosophy by argu- ing that any alternative to it is meaningless. Logical behaviorism, is, I believe, if not simply false, at the least misleading. Furthermore, I hesitate to ascribe logical behaviorism</page><page sequence="4">402 NOUJS without qualification to all the logical positivists and especially to Bergmann (who in any case was inclined to apostasy among the logical positivists very early). The main reason for my hesitation is as follows: Unlike many of the more stringent positivists (such as Feigl and Car- nap), Bergmann recognized, correctly, that the sense in which the (names of the) mental variables can, and even possibly must for the purposes of systematic scientific discourse, be "defined" by the (names of the) behavioral or other physical variables is not definition in the literal sense. (That is why here and in the next to final sentence of the last paragraph I put 'defined' in double quotes.) In the literal sense, a definition shows that the notion to be defined is an abbreviation-an expression that stands for or refers to strictly the same property or state of affairs as the expression for which it is the abbreviation. Thus, because the expression 'being an unmarried human male' defines the expression 'being a bachelor' in the literal sense, the latter therefore being an abbreviation of the former, the property of being an unmar- ried human male and the property of being a bachelor are strictly one and the same property. If the same conception of definition is applied to the case of the mental and the physical, mental predicates being therefore conceived as abbreviations for physical predicates, one gets the result that the mental variables are strictly the same as some physi- cal variables. That-the thesis that the physical variables alone exhaust the universe-is materialism. Although, to judge by his earlier writings alone, the evidence is not clear, I think Bergmann always believed, as he came later more emphatically to assert, that materialism is false. Thus my reservation. In any event, materialism is false. It is false on phenomenological grounds (which, by the way, don't apply to atoms and gods), and the mental variables are a set distinct from; and not merely a subset of, the physical variables. Since this is so, and since each of us is acquainted with some members of the set of mental variables, logical behaviorism must be rejected as false or misleading. I now proceed to refine further my characterization of behavior- ism by discussing four ideas of what behaviorism is not or, better, is not, for analytical purposes, usefully thought of as being. First, behaviorism is not the thesis, nor does it presuppose the thesis, that lawful explanation is the only possible or even, apart from any context, the only "appropriate" kind of explanation of behavior. I have never understood the impulse to argue, from whatever quarter, that there is but one "real" kind of explanation to be given or under- standing to be had of human behavior. That lawful explanation has a certain kind of superiority to all other kinds I would insist upon, if it is in need of any defense, in that it is that kind of understanding of the phenomena that enables prediction and control (about which more</page><page sequence="5">BEHAVIORISM &amp; THE PHILOSOPHY OF THE ACT 403 momentarily). The essential logical feature of lawful explanation that gives it this characteristic is, of course, that it is, in principle, deductive in nature. Since that is so, a particular explanation of the lawful type tells us, as we expect, why what it explains occurred, rather than did not occur. All the defender of behaviorism need argue is that the lawful understanding of behavior is possible and that nothing in philosophy or in our experience of ourselves shows that such understanding can- not be had through the physical variables alone. Second, behaviorism is not the thesis that the prediction and control of behavior are the goal of sceintific psychology. That proposi- tion, which one associates primarily with B. F. Skinner, might be taken in any of three senses: (1) as a statement about the nature of science itself, or more precisely, one that follows from such a statement; or (2) as a statement about the possibilities of a science of human behavior; or (3) as a statement about our responsibilities deriving from our present or future knowledge of the causes of human behavior. Nature, pos- sibilities, responsibilities: the words suggest that a normative or modal statement is disguised as a categorical, factual one. Yet I can think of no other reasonable, precise meaning to attach to the statement. Be that as it may, and whatever the truth value or reasonableness of each of these three statements, I wish to dissociate each of them from what I mean by behaviorism in the following way. I characterized behaviorism as the thesis that only physical variables are needed in the lawful explanation of human behavior. Scientific prediction and therefore, where possible, effective control of any kind of phenomena, are logically more super- ficial than, because they are logically dependent upon, scientific expla- nation, at least when one is relying upon knowledge of the causes of the phenomenon to be predicted or controlled. Within certain limits, as we know, reliable prediction is possible without knowledge of causes just because the phenomenon is regular in its occurrences. The succession of the seasons is an obvious example. Control, however, does ordinarily require knowledge, however imperfect, of causes. That I take to be obvious. The essential point, however, is that, historically and logically, the "goal" of science has been, and remains, lawful explanation. More accurately, it is the search for laws and theories that permit the explana- tion and sometimes the prediction of particular occurrences and contain the explanation(s) of kinds of phenomena. The asymmetry between what is "permitted" and what is "contained" shows the logically more fundamental nature of explanation as compared to prediction. (We don't predict kinds of phenomena.) Prediction as such is not the "goal" of any science and not therefore of scientific psychology. Third, behaviorism is not the thesis that behavior is the proper subject matter of psychology. I do not wish to disagree with this essen- tially normative proposition and for anyone who has a role in decisions</page><page sequence="6">404 NOUS concerning the use of resources in academic and professional psycho- logy, its importance is obvious. Obvious, too, is the motive force in treating this essentially normative proposition as one of fact, or of meaning or of "philosophy." Insofar as it derives from or even em- bodies the non-normative proposition that mental phenomena cannot be scientifically studied in just the way that pre-behavioristic psycholo- gists supposed, it is not merely a value judgment. But whatever its precise status is or is even decided to be within reasonable limits, it is usefully separated from propositions about what is possible in the lawful explantion of behavior. Fourth, behaviorism is not the thesis that a full set of relevant, independent variables in the lawful explanation of behavior exists among the so-called environmental variables alone. Probably no advo- cate of behaviorism ever held this thesis in such a stark form whatever its critics may think and, alas, whatever reason some of its advocates may have given them for so thinking. Which among the physical variables are essential in the full, lawful explantion of behavior is just science in a way in which the exclusion of the mental variables is not just science but necessarily involves certain philosophical considerations. Whether, for example, certain near-universal characteristics of the human brain (or the dispositions or capabilities of which those char- acteristics are the "ground") are essential, as they almost certainly are, in the full, lawful explanation of language acquisition and employment is of no obvious philosophical significance, Chomsky and some of his critics to the contrary notwithstanding. Nor does the extent to which the full, lawful explanation of differences in human capacities and behavior requires mention of genetically-determined physiological differences among us in itself raise any interesting philosophical ques- tions. Once again, that is or ought to be science and only science. But the fact, and indubitable fact I presume everyone would take it to be, that no full, lawful explanation of behavior is to be found among the environmental variables alone gave rise to an issue among philoso- phers of which I must take some extended note before I turn directly to the mind/body issue. Given that there are bound to be "gaps" in explanations of behav- ior that countenance only environmental variables, the question arises what,should be assumed to fill those "gaps". Ignoring entirely the possibility that nothing fills them, that is, the possibility that deter- minism is false, there are, within the context of our discussion, three possibilities: (1) mental states, (2) physiological states, and (3) behav- ioral dispositions. Behaviorism rules out the first or, more precisely, implies that the second or the third will suffice. Whether it should be the second or the third will be recognized as the by now somewhat hoary issue of hypothetical constructs (the physiological) vs. interven-</page><page sequence="7">BEHAVIORISM &amp; THE PHILOSOPHY OF THE ACT 405 ing variables (behavioral dispositions). As to this matter I have three comments. First, when the classical positivists spoke of "defining" the mental variables through certain physical ones, what they should have meant is not, as we have already seen, that a mental predicate, given its already existing sense, can be regarded as literally an abbreviation 'for some physical predicate, but rather that one can, for the purposes of sceince, substitute for any mental notion a behavioral-dispositional one. To feel thirsty "is", by such a substitution, to be such that, under certain conditions, one drinks. But should the behavioral-dispositional notion in turn be replaced by a physiological one even while always keeping firmly in mind that a mental state, a behavioral-dispositional state, and a physiological state are three, and not two or one? That brings me to my next comment. The answer to the question I just asked may depend on the answer to the philosophical question as to the nature of dispositions in general. I believe that it does, especially since, in my view, dispositions are, in a special but important sense, nothing.5 Indeed they are, to speak most succinctly, materially though not formally, identified with their "grounds." Be that as it may, it is enough to remark here that the discussion of the old issue I mentioned was seriously impaired by a failure to bring to it an adequate theory of dispositions. Another confusion is the point of my final and longest comment. The hesitancy many philosophers and psychologists had about filling the "gap" with the physiological was due to the "unobservability" of the physiological. We cannot, ordinarily, look inside living human bodies, and it is the behavior of conscious, alert, intelligent human beings that, one assumes, the psychologist is most interested in under- standing. Yet, research strategies are one thing, matters of principle and especially of philosophical principle quite another, even if the latter do, as they ought, to some extent shape the former. Let me explain. The notion of unobservability is really at least four notions. Or, perhaps better said, the various kinds of unobservability derive from such fundamentally different circumstances that its core meaning is insufficient to its useful application. When confused, the four notions lead to ,bad arguments. The four "meanings" are: 1) something's being unobservable because it is covered up, too far away, too small. Exam- ples are: my pineal gland, the most distant star in the Andromeda galaxy, a virus; 2) something's being unobservable because of its nature as a disposition or other kind of defined property. Examples are: being soluble, being a trade union; 3) something's being unobservable be- cause of its privacy as a mental phenomenon. Examples are: being a sudden remembering, being a sharp pain; and 4) something's being</page><page sequence="8">406 NOUJS unobservable because of "its" being utterly non-existent. Examples are: unicorns, gods, and infallible philosophers. Although behavioral dispositions are unobservable in the second sense, this was felt by many philosophers not to be a difficulty of principle because such notions are, one assumes, definable by way of observable properties-solubility, for example, by the observable properties of being put into water and dissolving. Being unobservable in the sense in which the mental is unobservable is really, it is worth stressing, only unobservability-to-others; not being publicly observable and not being observable at all are two quite different matters. This point is worthy of emphasis because for an empiricist all property notions that are to be intelligible and therefore eligible for scientific discourse must be either observable or (literally) definable by way of the observable. The mental is not ptublicly observable. Yet each of us has observed a remembering. How we know we are all observing (instances of) the same property doesn't concern me for the present. Somehow we do know it. But it does make it at least intelligible for one to insist that 1) an empiricist may hold that mental properties are a distinct set of properties from the physical, and 2) to imagine that those properties could be interacting ones with the physical, that is, that the fundamental assumption of behaviorism could be false. Once again, it is, therefore, an empirical hypothesis, and logical behaviorism is false or misleading. The unobservability of the non-existent needs no further com- ment here, even though, in an obvious sense, it is of the most radical sort. But the unobservability of the physiological is, philosophically speaking, the most superficial of all. Whatever unobservability it has is, in part, a function of the lack of an adequate technology for its obser- vation combined with, of course, moral and legal prohibitions on the unrestrained observation of living human beings in any sense. Fur- thermore, and partly for the same reasons, especially keeping in mind the "technology of behavior" some psychologists wish to develop and apply as the result of psychological research, the environmental vari- ables are often easier to modify in order to shape or modify behavior. Finally there is a tendency to polarization-either the environmental or the physiological. The result was an entirely misplaced distrust of the physiological from Watson on among the behavioristic psychologists with a left-handed boost from the logical behaviorists. Yet the shallow- ness of filling the "gaps" by behavioral dispositions was evident to many despite the heroic efforts of some to show (what is true, in some cases) that the behavioral disposition could be defined and even identified logically independently of an, in particular instances, temporally prior to the behavior for which it was to be the partial explanation. And in some cases, as Skinner has argued, the role couldjust as well be taken by the earlier environment of the person whose behavior was to be ex-</page><page sequence="9">BEHAVIORISM &amp; THE PHILOSOPHY OF THE ACT 407 plained. So, for example, rather than invoke the behavioral disposition being thirsty, one could point instead to the fact of water deprivation for several hours. Neither, however, as we already know from common- sense and science, will serve systematically. As a research strategy, for the reasons mentioned above, one may reasonably sometimes ignore the physiological.6 But as a matter of principle based on what we already know of the empirical facts and the logic of dispositions, it is reasonable to conclude that only the physiological will suffice system- atically to fill the "gaps" in the full, lawful explanation of human behavior. I shall assume so in what follows. II It will be useful in the sequel if I generalize the fundamental assump- tion of behaviorism as follows, although, of course, it is not strictly implied by it: that every occurrence in the physical world, including therefore all human behavior, has a full, lawful explanation solely by other occurrences in the physical world. That means that for every event in the physical world there is what some call a "deterministic" explanation: laws and a set of purely physical prior initial conditions from the statement of which laws and initial conditions a statement of the event to be explained can be deduced and which initial conditions are such that were they to occur again, the result would be precisely the same. Let us, following Bergmann, express with succinctness this idea of the non-necessity of invoking any non-physical occurrences in the explanation of physical phenomena by saying that the physical world is "causally closed".7 Commonsense holds, and phenomenology confirms, that (1) minds exist in the sense that there is a set of non-physical variables (that materialism is false); and (2) minds are efficacious in the sense that what we desire, believe, remember, imagine and so on make a differ- ence to our behavior (that fatalism is false). Both minds and bodies are there; neither is, in the ontological sense, reducible to the other. And they do affect each other: if I didn't feel thirsty, I wouldn't drink water now; if I hadn't just been pricked by a pin, I wouldn't feel pain now. Some behaviorists, we know, believed that, in order to be consistent with the, fundamental assumption, they had to deny the efficacy of mind. The most radical way to do that is to deny its existence. And some philosophers continue to support this barely plausible but fundamen- tally mistaken line of reasoning by adopting as the criterion of existence whether or not the candiate it is "needed" for scientific explanation. Are the phenomenological data (and therefore commonsense) consistent with the idea that the physical world is causally closed? Does holding the fundamental assumption commit one in logic to mate- rialism or fatalism? Let us see.</page><page sequence="10">408 NOUYS First, as to the mere existence of a distinct set of mental variables, there is, fairly obviously, no problem unless we adopt, as we should not and shall not, the scientistic criterion of existence. For the fact that a given set of variables constitutes a causally closed set implies nothing whatsoever about the existence or non-existence of any other variables. If we assume then, as is assuredly the case, the there is a distinct set of mental variables, there are three abstract possibilities as to their lawful connection with the physical variables. Those possibilities are captured roughly in the notions of (1) no lawful connection at all, (2) connection by laws of succession, and (3) connection by laws of coexistence. Let us consider these possibilities in appropriate detail by imagining the somewhat repugnant situation of two human beings who are physio- logically identical, two persons whose brain states, neurological states, and all other bodily states are qualitatively indistinguishable. Assume that they are conscious. Are their mental states of lawful necessity also qualitatively indistinguishable? If, for example, the one is thinking that 2 + 2 = 4, is the other also of lawful necessity thinking that 2 + 2 = 4? The answer is either yes or no. If the answer is no, two of our three abstract possibilities remain. One is that the mental variables have no lawful connection with the physical ones at all. That isfatalism and fatalism is inconsistent with the phenomenological data. The other is that by certain laws of succession the mental variables interact with the physiological ones much as, in mechanics,mass, position, and velocity interact with each other. But then, just as no two of the latter constitute a causally closed set, so too, if this possibility is correct, the physical world is not causally closed. Interactionism is precisely this thesis-that the values of the mental variables make a difference to those of the physical variables in a way that makes the physical world not causally closed. If, however, the answer to our question is yes, then for every mental state, there is a simultaneous physiological state to which it is related by a law of coexistence such that whenever that particular physiological state occurs, that specific mental state occurs. That, pre- cisely, is the thesis of psychophysiologicalparellelism. It does not imply, of course, that for every physiological or more radically, as Spinoza believed, for every physical state, there is a lawfully corresponding and simultaneous mental state. But that accords with commonsense and science too, insofar as they hold that bodies can exist without minds but minds cannot exist without bodies. This kind of "materialism"-the primacy of matter-one denies only at the risk of absurdity. Thus, of the four "isms"-materialism, fatalism, interactionism, and parallelism-only interactionism implies that the physical world is not causally closed. (Some may wonder whether my categories are truly exclusive. Does not the materialist in denying the existence of mind also</page><page sequence="11">BEHAVIORISM &amp; THE PHILOSOPHY OF THE ACT 409 deny its efficacy thus making him a fatalist as well? The answer, of course, is negative insofar as the materialist regards the mind not as non-existing but as a subset of the physical variables, whether as, in the case of Ryle, behavioral and behavioral-dispositional ones or as, in the case of the so-called "identity" theorists, certain states of the brain or central nervous system. Thus mind, while non-existing in a certain sense in nonetheless efficacious. So there is no inconsistency.) For the behaviorist that leaves materialism, fatalism, and parallelism as consist- ent with the fundamental assumption. Materialism and fatalism are, on phenomenological grounds, absurd, the first in denying the existence of the mental variables, the other in denying their efficacy. Parellelism is thus the only reasonable position for the behaviorist to hold with respect to the connection of mind and body. Parallelism implies the fundamental assumption of behaviorism. For whenever one might wish to explain the occurrence of some behavior by the prior or simultaneous occurrence of a certain mental state (and, contrary to Skinner, such explanations are sometimes accu- rate as well as appropriate), one can, as it were, "'substitute" the lawfully corresponding physiological state (or behaviorial disposition or earlier environment) in the explanation. But-and this is the crucial point with respect to the phenomenological data-it does not follow from paral- lelism that the values of the mental variables make no difference to the values of the physiological and therefore of the behavioral variables. Quite the contrary, parallelism entails that some differences in the values of the mental variables will, of lawful necessity, be paralleled by differences in the values of the physiological variables. If I did not have the desire I do now have, my brain state would be different from what it is, and so my behavior different from what it is or will be, and so on. So it is not paradoxical as it first appears that parallelism is consistent with the propositions both that the physical variables constitute a causally closed set and that the values of the mental variables make a difference to those of the physical variables. Yet some may wonder whether or not this is not just a modern version of epiphenomenalism according to which the mental variables simply ride "piggy-back" on certain physical ones while themselves having no real causal efficacy? And if they have no real causal efficacy, is this, not really fatalism after all? My answer to the first of these questions is yes and no, and to the second, therefore, no, while observ- ing at the outset that the labels don't really matter but only accurate description. There are several reasons why some may wish to say that on parallelism, at any rate, brain states are the cause of mental states and not the other way around. I shall mention only the two most important. The first is that brains and some of their states can exist with no lawfully corresponding mental states while no mental state can exist</page><page sequence="12">410 NOUJS without a lawfully corresponding brain (or some physical) state. This is again but the primacy of matter and embodies, in an obvious sense, a contextual notion of what makes a certain lawful connection a causal one. This, in my opinion, is as it should be. Yet, our universe being what it is, if parallelism is true, it is lawfully impossible for certain brain states to occur unless certain mental states occur. Could the universe have been such that those brain states could occur without those or any mental states at all? Yes, but it isn't that way. The second reason lies in the fact that the parallelistic connection is almost certainly many/one, not one/one, from body to mind. If that is so, then, in an obvious sense, mind is "deducible" from (not: reducible to!) body, but not the other way around. More precisely, knowing all the laws permits the calculation of specific mental states from specific bodily states, but from specific mental states only to ranges of bodily states. Parallelism is true. Indeed, properly clarified, it is commonsensi- cal. By that I mean that it is the only hypothesis that is consistent with our experiences of ourselves and our presumed knowledge of others. In its dualism, it recognizes the existence of a distinct set of mental variables. But unlike the other dualisms, interactionism and fatalism, it is what is presupposed by the practice of medicine in general, and anesthesiology and attempts to relieve pain in particular, by the prac- tice of lie detection, by all attempts to locate precise neural substrata for each of the various mental activities, by our belief that we often know what another person is thinking, and, fundamentally, by the constant experience each of us has of the relation of his or her own body and mind.8 And since parallelism is true, behaviorism is justified in its fundamental assumption. I turn to the history of the act. III Speaking commonsensically, there are mental acts of remembering, imagining, doubting, perceiving, and so on. Yet many philosophers and psychologists have denied that there are acts. Obviously, they were not denying that people sometimes remember, imagine, doubt, per- ceive, and so on. What, then were they denying? As is usually the case in philosophy, some understanding of the history of the issue is essential to grasping the issue itself. For the issue at hand there is, however, an unusual complication. On the one hand, the notion of the mind as "active" in cognition is, unquestionably, the historical source of the notion of the act itself. Denying that there are acts in this sense is denying that the mind is "active" in cognition (or in any other of its states). This notion of "activity" is, of course, a metaphysical one and is</page><page sequence="13">BEHAVIORISM &amp; THE PHILOSOPHY OF THE ACT 411 tied historically and structurally to a substance ontology. On the other hand, the question of the existence of acts has been raised, particularly in the last century and a half, entirely outside a substance ontology. In this case, I submit, the fundamental question was: Are there any simple entities that are intrinsically intentional, that is, that by their very "nature" are about something else? If so, there are acts; if not, there are none.9 Histori- cally, the two notions were not always distinguished nor, what amounts to almost the same, conceived and characterized clearly. So there were many bad arguments on both sides of the issue. Eventually I shall, as it were, "side" with the notion of an intrinsically intentional entity as being both more defensible than that of "activity" and structurally the more important notion in the analysis of mind. For the moment I observe only that whether we rely on the one notion or the other- "activity" or intrinsically intentional entity-the issue concerns, as it should, not the existence or non-existence of some ordinary object or state of affairs such as an act of perceiving a tree, but rather the existence or non-existence at the basic ontological level of a category or subcategory of entities of certain characteristics. It is not surprising then that the historical review of the issue that follows should be built around the notions of relations, substance, and the theory of ideas. As early as his Theatetus Plato raised one of the fundamental questions of intentionality, a question that has plagued philosophers to the present day: How can we think about what is not the case or what does not exist? It is essential to my task that we understand both why that raises a problem and why a certain answer to it is not acceptable. My desk is in the relation being-two-meters-from to my bookcase. In order that it stand in that relation to the bookcase it is necessary that the bookcase, like the desk itself, exist. In general, if any object a stands in any relation whatsoever to another object b, it is necessary that both a and b exist. Now it is natural to suppose that to think of something or to perceive it is to be in some relation to that something. But how can someone stand in any relation to something that does not exist as when one imagines a centaur? Putting aside materialist "solutions" to this problem which are absurd and irrelevant, there would seem to be three abstractly possible kinds of answers for it: (1) One may insist that there is, after all, always something there to be related to-a proposition, a false fact, a sentence, perhaps a Cartesian idea; or (2) one may claim that, on analysis, the appearance of being in a relation to something disappears altogether, or (3) one may hold that the "relation" is not really a relation but a link of another sort such that it can, after all, hold between an existent and a non-existent. If there are intrinsically inten- tional entities, the first or the third of these solutions would appear to be the right one. Yet the second probably has the most initial attraction. How tempting then to take it and thereby assert that there are no acts.</page><page sequence="14">412 NOUS Aristotle introduced into Western philosophy the ontological cat- egory of substance. Among the several features ascribed to a substance by philosophers is its capacity for spontaneous "activity," although always in accord with its nature. For the medieval philosophers, even though the mind is still officially only the "form" of an essentially physical substance, it is in itself inherently "active"-this being the beginning of a line of thought that culminated in Berkeley and the idealists according to whom only the mind is "active". For the medievals this "activity" was expressed primarily in knowing, something in which, according to their theory of abstraction, the mind takes the form of something else and makes it temporarily its own. Officially, the mind is a form. In practice, as it were, the mind is "active" and takes on a form. The language was already that of a mind as a substance itself and not merely the "form" of another. Descartes made it explicit. The mind is itself a substance, and mental acts are the "activities" of these mental substances. If there are no such "activities" or if they are of no efficacy, then the existence of acts is, or was eventually taken to be, in doubt. Two developments, one from science and one from philosophy, tended to that very conclusion. In the first instance, the scientific revolution spread the idea of "me- chanical" explanation, that is, of the physical world's being causally closed. When mental acts are thought of as spontaneous "activities" impinging in a causal manner on the physical world, the grounds for their efficacy and hence their existence (since their very conception as "activities" has to do as much with their efficacy as with their intention- ality) is undermined. But in the second instance, Descartes also taught that to be aware of something is for the mind to "have" an idea of that something where an idea is conceived as something like an image or picture. Yet we know, on phenomenological grounds, that we can think of things with very imperfect images of them or none at all. My thought yesterday of my friend whom I had not seen for several years was no less of him and of no one else even though my image of him in fact resembled his son more than him. In short, so far as ideas are something like images, we make them stand for what we are thinking of. Hence the intentionality of the thought cannot lie in the relation of resemblance that the idea or image has to anything. (Nor, of course, and for a similar reason, can it lie in any causal relation which the image or anything else in the mind has to the object thought about or perceived. If that is what the so- called causal theory of perception asserts, it is absurd. If it does not, then why should the causes of our mental states, whether of perception or imagination or remembering, be mentioned systematically at all in a philosophical account of their intentionality?) Images or ideas are not (always) object-specific. Yet my thought is undoubtedly specific: it is directed to one definite person and to no other.</page><page sequence="15">BEHAVIORISM &amp; THE PHILOSOPHY OF THE ACT 413 With something of a historical paradox, Descartes who was to affirm most explicitly the two-substance view of human beings (which is not, Ryle and many others to the contrary notwithstanding, the same as dualism as such) by his theory of ideas initiated a development that led, in one major school of thought, to the demise of substance altogether. Locke was uncertain whether or not there are mental substances and his physical substances are but shadows of Aristotelian-Thomistic ones. Berkeley was convinced that there are no physical substances, only mental ones. Yet each, while subscribing to the theory of ideas in his own way, retained greater or fewer remnants of the act, Locke in talking about the operations of the mind, and Berkeley in his assertion that only minds are "active." It remained for Hume, who recognized no substances, to declare that the mind is just ideas. There are no acts then because there are no "activities" and there are no "activities" because there are no substances. In such a manner, if my history is reasonably accurate, were the philosophically disastrous associations established: acts with a sub- stance ontology and a notion of freedom as spontaneous "activity" incompatible with determinism and mechanism, all with an overtone of distaste for empirical science characteristic of post-17th-century ra- tionalism; empiricism with determinism, the theory of ideas, and an actless philosophy of mind, all deriving in part from the critique of substance. The associations were disastrous among other reasons be- cause the critique of substance and hence of "activity" was mistakenly taken to cast doubt on the existence of intrinsically intentional entities. Modern psychology began a little over a century ago with a con- ception of its task that derived essentially from philosophy: to discover the nature of and connections among the "elements" of the mind. An element is, of course, a "simple" entity. A simple entity is one with no constituents. So the argument persisted: Are there among those ele- ments any that are intrinsically intentional? Are there acts? Given the background I have just sketched, it is not surprising that those who defended the act as being among those elements-the school of intentionality-should also typically have been substance philosophers, although in the case of Brentano, only minds and never bodies are genuine substances. Brentano insisted that the act is the distinguishing mark of the mental, and Meinong and his student Ehrenfels explic- itly(but deplorably) gave the act its old "active" role. The unfortunate associations also persisted. Meanwhile, the founders of the first laboratories in psychology, thinking of themselves as good empiricists, maintained that a mental state consists entirely of "ideas" or rather, as they had now come to be called, "contents." Contents, hovering uncertainly between minds and physical objects, at least have, or were described as having, the same</page><page sequence="16">414 NOUS properties that we ascribe to physical objects-colors, shapes. pitches, and the like. This, it was felt, is at most a very mild dualism, whereas to make the act the distinguishing mark of the mental is to maintain a radical dualism of mind and body that is not in accord with the modern outlook. Indeed, for many of the members of the experimentally- oriented tradition, the insistence on the act came to be seen as down- right pandering to religion and superstition. As Boring stresses: "Act fits the Church better than content, for it tends less toward a mechanis- tic and therefore a deterministic psychology." ([20]: 453) Thus, the suspicion of and even hostility to the act has several sources. First, the act is conceived at the outset as being or involving a relation between a knower and that which is known. But then, accord- ing to its critics, there is no way to understand how there could be such a relation in the situation in which, as we ordinarily speak, we think of what does not exist or obtain. Second, the act is thought of as being or depending upon an inherent "activity" of the mind, a notion that, it will be (rightly) said, derives from an anthropomorphic and outmoded substance ontology. Third, and closely related to the preceding point, the act is often advanced as the basis of a presumed "freedom" of a sort that would make determinism false and psychology "non-mechanistic". And fourth, the act is described, unlike mere contents, as being radi- cally unlike physical objects or their constituents. This, it is objected, introduces an extreme and unacceptable dualism into the world. In short, it may be said by way of summary of this line of thinking, the act is "unscientific" especially for anyone committed to behaviorism. I turn to the philosophy of the act. IV As I walk down the street I suddenly remember that my grandmother wore glasses. What in this situation are the phenomenological data? First, it is given to me that something has happened in the universe and something of which, despite the several people around me, only I am or could be directly cognizant. No matter what changes in my brain or central nervous system accompany this occurrence, it is given to me as something in addition to those or any such changes, that is, as a non-physical occurrence. But the falsity of materialism is not my pre- sent point and has been labored enough already. Second, it is given to me that I am indeed remembering (whether accurately or not) and not, say, doubting or imagining or perceiving. This feature is what Bergmann calls the species of the mental state. And third, it is given to me that it is that my grandmother wore glasses I am remembering and not, say, that I had strawberries for breakfast or that Hubert Hum- phrey became vice-president of the United States in 1965. It is not of</page><page sequence="17">BEHAVIORISM &amp; THE PHILOSOPHY OF THE ACT 415 course the intention itself of my remembering that is directly given-I don't have my grandmother herself in my mind-but rather that the intention is my grandmother's having worn glasses. Let us call these latter two features which are directly given to one in any typical mental state simply the species feature and the intention feature. How shall these two features be grounded in the ontological anal- ysis of mind? To answer that, we should first have at least the sketch of an ontology before us. In Bergmann's ontology as in many others, there are the two fundamental categories of particulars and universals. The universals are of two major subcategories-what I shall call simply properties and relations. That properties and relations are universals rather than so-called "perfect particulars" is of no present, direct relevance. As for the particulars, they are, unlike the substances of the traditional act philosophers, momentary and not inherently "active". Their being momentary, while obviously of importance in any treat- merit of the problem of the self, is of no relevance in the context of this discussion. Their not being "active", however, is crucial. Bergmann properly rejects the notion of "activity" (reflected in some contempo- rary notions of "agency") as unduly anthropomorphic and "irremedi- ably confused". The world, including mind, is in this respect Newton- ian and not Aristotelian. Consider again my sudden remembering and its two crucial fea- tures. Like every particular occurrence in the history of the universe, it will consist at least in the being of one particular. The two features, being, broadly speaking, descriptive aspects of the situation, must be grounded in either properties or relations. Which shall it be? If we recall that the features are directly given ones, the question almost answers itself. A relation cannot be given to me unless both (or all) of its relata exist and are also given to me. Yet when I think of centaurs and mermaids, the intention does not exist, and when I think of my grand- mother, she is not directly given to me. Nor is there any other entity that could plausibly serve, in addition to the particular that "is" my mind, as the other term of a descriptive relation that would ground either or both of the two features. So both the species feature and the intention feature must be grounded in properties of the particular and not in relations that particular has to the intention or to anything else. What are those properties? The most natural way to refer to the ones of our example are being-a-remembering and the-thought-that-my- grandmother-wore-glasses. My inscribing their names with hyphens is designed to indicate that each is a simply property, that is, has no other properties, of the same or of a different kind, as constitutents.'0 Being simple, they both have the first qualification for being an intrinsically intentional entity of a sort that would entail that there are acts. Neither, of course, is of the character of an "idea" or content or sense datum.</page><page sequence="18">416 NOUS Neither therefore is either an image of or a constituent of the intention. It is obviously the second of these properties, the one that grounds the intention feature, that is an intrinsically intentional entity. Itis such that by an "inspection" of it, one can tell what specific state of affairs it points to. It is therefore what the medievals would call a natural sign unlike the purely conventional ones of language and the partly voluntary ones of both mental and physical images. Nor can the intentional property (as I now call it) be decomposed into simpler properties none of which is a natural sign. Thus if intentional properties exist (are exemplified), then there are acts. I have already given the sole, fundamental "argu- ment" for maintaining that there are such properties-the phenomenological fact of my knowing immediately what the intention of my remembering is. So, on this analysis (which is essentially one first proposed by Bergmann and defended in greater detail by Grossmann and this author elsewhere),"1 my remembering consists of a particular's examplifying the species property being-a-remembering and the inten- tional property the-thought-that-my-grandmother-wore-glasses. And it is clear that this analysis can be extended to all mental acts, commonsensi- cally speaking; even, in my opinion, to the experience of pain and similar sensations. No relation is involved in the analysis. To remember something is not, ontologically speaking, to stand in the relation of remembering to that something. Yet it remains to be answered how, after all, a mind is connected with what it thinks about. If I am in no relation to my grandmother when I remember that she wore glasses, surely there is yet some kind of link between her and me that does not, at that moment, hold between me and anything else. It will be apparent that for the analysis here outlined and using the example I have chosen, the problem concerns precisely the connection between the intentional property the-thought-that-my-grandmother-wore-glasses and my grandmother's wearing glasses, whether or not that state of affairs that is the intention of my remembering actually obtains (or did obtain or will obtain). What is the connection between a natural sign and that of which it is the sign if it is not a descriptive relation? In Bergmann's language, the answer to the question is that the intentional property means the state of affairs intended. For our present purposes the word itself is not particularly important although it is by Bergmann naturally very carefully chosen. What is important for us is its general ontological character. Let us consider. Or, as in the fact stated by 'It's raining or it's not raining' is a logical connection. Two-meters-from as in the fact stated by 'My desk is two meters from my bookcase' is a descriptive relation. A descriptive rela- tion, in order to be exemplified, requires the existence of its relata. In the fact stated by 'It's raining or it's not raining' the logical connection or</page><page sequence="19">BEHAVIORISM &amp; THE PHILOSOPHY OF THE ACT 417 holds between an existing state of affairs and non-existing state of affairs. This possibility is one feature of a logical connection. Two- meters-from is causally efficacious in that by the law of universal gravita- tion distance is a relevant variable in explaining certain phenomena. All relations are of lawful significance. Or, like all indubitably logical connections, is of no lawful significance, is not causally efficacious. That is another feature of a logical connection. The link between an intentionalproperty and what is intended is a logical connection. By assimilat- ing this link to the general category of logical connection, two palpable advantages are obtained: (1) It is at least somewhat easier to under- stand in the manner appropriate to philosophy how we can think about what does not exist, and (2) it accounts for the commonsense fact that to think about something even when it does exist is not to affect it in any way. There may, of course, also be a descriptive relation between the knower and the known which may indeed be the cause of the knowing. But the intentional link itself is logical. Bergmann is, I believe, the first to see clearly that the link between the mind and what it thinks about must be a logical connection, cannot be a descriptive relation.12 I also believe that this insight and its articu- lation in his writings constitute his most important contribution to philosophy. Be that as it may, it is well to remind ourselves that the analysis carried to this point leaves entirely open the answer to, but invites attention upon, the difficult questions of the ontological status of logical connections and of non-existent states of affairs. Bergmann himself has devoted considerable energy to those tasks.13 For what I am about however we need not pursue them. If that is not already evident, it will become so in the final section of this paper. v Before I state positively the fundamental point of this paper, permit me to rehearse the essential features of behaviorism as I described it and of the philosophy of the act also as I described it and defended it but in its basics as developed by Bergmann. As to behaviorism: its fundamental assumption is that for the purposes of sceintific explana- tion of human behavior, a full set of relevant, independent variables exists among the physical ones alone, and for the same purposes the non-physical ones may therefore be ignored. Thus, the defender of behaviorism must deny that there are non-physical variables that in- teract with the physical ones. If that defender also wishes to be consist- ent with commonsense dualism and the everyday facts about and scientific knowledge of the effects of minds and bodies on-each other, he will also subscribe to parallelism rather than, as would also be consistent with the fundamental assumption, materialism or fatalism.</page><page sequence="20">418 NOUS As to the philosophy of the act: despite its historical antecedents in a substance philosophy and the corresponding notion of spontaneous "activity," the essential characteristic of the act, that of an intrinsically intentional, simple entity, can be consistently maintained without being committed to those historically antecedent notions. Furthermore, all of the descriptive features of the act are properties of the mind and none relations between it and something else, the intentional link itself being a logical connection. One more brief preparatory step is necessary. Temporal relations are descriptive relations. Few would dispute that claim and I shall not argue for it here. They are therefore of lawful significance. Yet their significance is unlike that of all other properties and relations in that their holding is the very precondition for any sort of lawful connection whatsoever between and among the phenomena. They are pervasive; indeed, in Bergmann's words, time is the "great binder" of the realms of the physical and the mental. So one (of simultaneity) holds between any given mental state and its lawfully corresponding bodily state. Having taken note of the special status of the temporal relations (which, by the way, does not apply to the spatial relations), I may now ignore them in the following decisive paragraph of this paper. If the act did involve a descriptive relation of lawful significance between the mind and what it intends (or anything else non-mental), then the physical world would not be causally closed and thefundamental assumption of behav- iorism would be false! But since, on the philosophy of the act as described and defended, all the descriptivefeatures of the act are properties and none relations, all suchfeatures may be held to be connected by laws of coexistence tofeatures of the physical world. Hence, the philosophy of the act is consistent with the denial of interactionism. Thus is thefundamental ass1imption of behaviorism safeguarded within the philosophy of the act. One may fully recognize the act but deny that there are "activities". To do so is to separate the philosophy of the act from its historical origins in substance philosophy. And as we have seen, the recognition of the existence of intrinsically intentional, introspectively given en- tities need in no way diminish one's commitment to the possibility of a deterministic and "mechanistic" psychology, that is, to behaviorism. Only intellectual fashion, not logic or phenomenology, says otherwise. So it is not surprising after all that Gustav Bergmann, who began his career as a member of the Vienna Circle and as such was a proponent of logical positivism and behaviorism, should emerge eventually as the most distinguished contemporary representative of the Austrian school of the act.</page><page sequence="21">BEHAVIORISM &amp; THE PHILOSOPHY OF THE ACT 419 REFERENCES [1] Addis, L., "Ryle's Ontology of Mind," in L.

Yet for reasons both of history and clarity of exposition, it is desirable to proceed under the deterministic presupposition. 5See [3] for details.</page><page sequence="22">420 NOOS 6The laws that actually are discovered may be only what I call "polychronal" laws.
