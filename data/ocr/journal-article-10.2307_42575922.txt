<plain_text><page sequence="1">Charles Weingartner* EDUCATIONAL RESEARCH: The Romance of Quantification (This article is dedicated to Red Holtzman for the answer he gave during a TV interview to the question &gt; " How come the Knicks had a 78% shoot- ing average tonight ?" Holtzman said , "How the hell should I know?") On analytical a recent look occasion, at educational I was asked research; to to . raise . take pertinent a hard-nosed ques- analytical look at educational research; to raise pertinent ques- tions about and to identify the significance of the research process; to pose better questions and to propose more profitable directions for future research." The following is my response to this request: I must admit at the outset that my response to the charge may not seem adequate since I am not at all sure what educational research "is." This is partly because I am not sure what it isn't. My general impression is that much important research dealing with education was conducted by people who did not think of themselves as "educational researchers." Among these were men such as Adelbert Ames and I.A. Richards. Ames had a law degree, but preferred painting. Richards was an English professor at Cambridge (England) who later became (of all things) an education professor at Harvard. Neither one of them ever messed with test scores or "teacher competencies" or any of the other curious activities that serve as the focus of much, if not most, of what is currently done in the name of "educational research." Incidentally, in 1950, John Dewey wrote in a letter to Ames that: "... I think your work is by far the most important work done in * Charles Weingartner has recently retired from teaching at the University of South Florida at Tampa. 109</page><page sequence="2">110 Etcetera • SUMMER 1982 the psychological-philosophical field during this century - I am tempted to say the only really important work." I have even more problems related to the charge, largely stemming from a long-standing interest in semantics. As I come at things, "education" is by no means synonymous with schooling; it is an entirely different kind of enterprise from training. The word "learn- ing" I am also skeptical about since there is no clear referent for it that I am aware of, much less an understanding of the process via which "it" occurs. I also think it is necessary to distinguish between evaluation and testing which are commonly used synonymously. Then there is the problem of the attempt to separate the cognitive from the affective. This distinction can only be made verbally, not operationally. As Plato noted: "In order for education to accomplish its purpose, Reason must have an adequate emotional base." I avoid the word "teach" in all of its forms. It is a dangerous word, about as dangerous as the words "progress," "freedom," and "equality," and for similar reasons. One of the primary sources of confusion in attempts at human communication is the tendency to reify: that is, to treat an abstrac- tion as substantially existing. This applies both to nouns and verbs, thereby compounding the problem of our talking in nouns while dealing with a universe of verbs. The common response to this ubiquitous problem is: "It's just a matter of semantics." Any attempt at human communication is "just a matter of semantics," and that is not a trivial point; it is crucial. In any case, the term "educational research" seems to me to be a misnomer because its focus is on school conventions, not on educa- tion, and because much of what is done under the rubric of research doesn't seem to complement the Oxford English Dictionary definition of research. The OED defines research as being (among other things) "studious inquiry or examination; esp.: critical or exhaustive inves- tigation or experimentation having as its aim the discovery of new facts and their correct interpretation, the revision of accepted conclusions, theories, or laws in the light of newly discovered facts, or the practical applications of such new or revised conclusions, theories, or laws." One example of why I am not sure that much of what happens in the name of educational research is research in OED terms is provided by the Encyclopedia of Educational Research which largely chronicles the re-discovery of old facts, many long known before educational research ever became a term in common currency. As nearly as I can tell, the primary characteristic of educational research is that it has no perceptible effect on school policy or procedure.</page><page sequence="3">Educational Research: The Romance of Quantification 111 Beyond that, the current dominant process to which the term educational research refers seems to be the generation and manipula- tion of "data." Much, if not most or all, of this "data" derives from the tabulating of responses (limited) on "survey questionnaires," or of scores on standardized tests. There are two striking features of this kind of "data": first, there is so much of it that it is not possible to keep up with it, and, second, there doesn't seem to be much argument as to what it might mean. There are a number of assumptions that seem curious to me that underlie much of this data-generating activity. Among these are: 1) the assumption that there is a substantive significance to be assigned to a single-score on a standardized test that "measures achievement" via providing pre-determined "correct" answers for the testees to "recognize" (rather than recall or reconstruct); 2) that, in any case, whatever is "measured" via this process is worth measuring in the first place; and 3) that the transportation theory of communication is appropriate for developing paradigms relating to instruction in the schools as well as to an "evaluation" of the "effectiveness" of such instruction. There is no way to over- emphasize the importance of this third assumption, particularly in view of the research of such men as Ames which directly confutes it. It seems to me that the first assumption is called into question both by retention studies and by the phenomenon of "regression toward the mean," to say nothing of the fact that one of the most widely subscribed to school ethics is that which holds that it is unreasonable to expect students to remember anything in one marking period which was "covered" in any previous marking period. When you consider the amount of time, effort, energy, and resources that go into producing such trivial and transitory results as generally accrue from the usual school convention of "imparting content" to students - via any instructional medium - a whole series of other questions arises, including "What the hell is that all about?" The second assumption relates to the broader question of the role of technique, not only in educational research, but in society at large. Jacques Ellul, for example, notes that one tendency that accom- panies a preoccupation with technique is for discourse relating to it (technique) to displace questions as to whether or not it should be pursued at all. That is, "how" questions displace "why" questions. Perhaps one of the clearest examples of this phenomenon is provided by Robert F. Mager, in his book Preparing Instructional Objectives. When this book first appeared, incidentally, in 1962, its title was Preparing Objectives for Programmed Instruction. Following the PPBS eruption in the schools, with its "accountability" fallout, the title, and only the title, was changed. In the preface to this book, Mager</page><page sequence="4">112 Etcetera • SUMMER 1982 emphasizes that "The book is not about the philosophy of 'teaching machine' programming, nor is it about who should select the objectives, nor about which objectives should be selected." In the more recent edition, he simply omits reference to "teaching machine programming." Everything else remains the same. The book is solely about the techniques of stating objectives - how, not which, why, or whether, and that is a crucial point. It is crucial because unless there is some substantive attention given exactly to what Mager says he is not concerned with, what we have is yet another mindless application of technique that not only can but probably will make things worse rather than better. Our whole society is an illustration of this danger. The most crucial sociological and ecological problems we face, with their concomitant psychological, economic, and political consequences, are a result of the mindless pursuit of technique lacking any philosophical base except the production of short-term monetary profit. The pollution of our air and water; the poisoning of our land - and virtually every form of life on it and in it and above it - for example, are direct results of the lack of an intervening mechanism which asks questions about who should decide which techniques can or should be used and for what purposes or objectives, along with which objectives the techniques can be expected both to achieve and not to achieve, along with questions about the probable long-term effects of the application of the technique. The only example that I know of that illustrates (belatedly) a recognition of the fact that we can jeopardize our own survival by a failure to pose such questions was the decision (since modified) to deny the SST access to the United States and (still in effect at this writing) to prohibit U.S. overflight by this same aircraft. Much of what occurs under the rubric of "educational research" is politically, not educationally, motivated and subsidized. It is the collation and manipulation of statistics in response to political decisions either by executive fiat or by laws enacted by a legislative body; it is totally lacking in any coherent or even poorly articulated educational philosophy. The basis for most educational research, I am saying, is political, not educational. For example, I have a copy of a memo from the staff of the budget committee of a state legislature addressed to the staff of the education committee of that same legislature. The memo instructs the education committee "to get with accountability because it has political sex appeal." Not only is this not surprising, it is predictable. The practice of politics may or may not be pragmatic in our society, but it is certainly expedient. The perquisites of office propel politicians to do whatever is expedient to prolong their tenure. It would be curious indeed if</page><page sequence="5">Educational Research: The Romance of Quantification 113 they did otherwise. Most "educators," however, are politically illiterate. Their rhetoric about how politics "ought to be" is dow- nright quaint. Those aligned with the labor movement are currently in the process of in-service training in political reality, and some have even discovered that if you are a public employee who doesn't make any difference politically, you just don't make any difference. The current form of "accountability" in the schools has intensified the attention and significance given to test scores beyond any reasonable degree. One index of the irrationality of the present state of things in this regard is provided by the curious - and widely held - expectation (and even insistence) that all testees should score above the norm. The third assumption listed above was that the "transportation theory of communication" is inadequate to the circumstances of human communication. The transportation theory of communica- tion, for example, holds that a "message" can exist discretely, prior to, and independently of, any particular "receiver," and that the primary concern must be with the "fidelity" of the transmission of the message over a given channel. The common paradigm for this theory is the "message-transmitter-channel-receiver-message" one. The focus of this paradigm is primarily, though not exclusively, on the channel. The analog for this theory and its paradigm in educa- tional research can be found in the assumption that there is a 1:1 ratio between what a "teacher teaches" and what some, or any, "student learns." This theory underlies, for example, virtually everything I have ever seen about "accountability." The analog for this paradigm in behavioral psychology (which has become increas- ingly visible since the accountability movement started in the schools) is the "S-R" metaphor. The S-R metaphor, like the 1:1 ratio, assumes a direct relationship between "stimulus and re- sponse." The transportation theory paradigm, the 1:1 ratio model, and the S-R metaphor are all mechanically based. What each one omits or ignores is the infinite variability, uniqueness, and complex- ity of human meaning making processes. If we had nothing else, as I noted earlier, the Ames demonstrations in perception alone would discredit the application of this theory to human communication. It turns out, for example, that the O (organism) that is being S'd (essed) and that is R'ing (arring) is the most crucial part of the process, yet it is omitted entirely from mechanically based models of communication. All serious attempts at analyzing the process of human communi- cation focus on the audience as the critical determiner of the meaning of any attempt at communication. No matter how "important" the message, nor how sophisticated the mode of communication, the</page><page sequence="6">114 Etcetera • SUMMER 1982 meaning that is made of the attempt is ultimately the result of what the audience is and does. In the absence of a detailed analysis of the audience, there simply is no pragmatic way to make a judgment about the "effectiveness" of any attempt at human communication. In the current accountability movement, and its accompanying escalation of educational research focussing on "assessment," all of this is ignored. All that is attended to about the audience is the score it gets on a standardized test. That is just too gross an oversimplifica- tion to produce any useful information. Yet this is just about all educational research is devoted to dealing with. It was this kind of oversimplification, incidentally, that led Heisenberg to formulate his principle of uncertainty. An analogous principle might be articulated for educational research that could be called the principle of indeterminacy. That is, we are far from certain what a score on a standardized test determines, much less what policies and procedures should be developed as a consequence of the tabulation of such scores. There is more than just my whimsical opinion to warrant consider- ing this principle (although it is not clear to me why my opinion wouldn't be sufficient). E.L. Thorndike, for example, observed that: Existing instruments (for measuring intellect) represent enormous improvements over what was available twenty years ago, but three fundamental defects remain. Just what they measure is not known; how far it is proper to add, subtract, multiply, divide, and compute ratios with the measures obtained is not known; just what the measures signify concerning intellect is not known. We may refer to these defects in order as ambiguity in content, arbitrariness in units, and ambiguity in significance, (cited in The National Elementary Principal, March/ April, 1975.) The durability of Thorndike's observations illustrates the serious- ness of the problem that the principle of indeterminacy refers to. The illusion of certainty produced by the invocation of numbers in our society warrants a restatement of some observations made in 1960 by Charles E. Goshen (in "The Tyranny of Numbers," The Saturday Review, Feb. 2, 1960, pp. 55-57.): Man's ability to construct mathematical models of nature has become such a highly developed skill that the self-confidence it inspires sets up an almost insurmountable obstacle to the introduction of new thinking. Few scientists acknowledge to themselves that mathematics, far from being a fact of nature, is a man-made, hypothetical model of nature. This lack of realization is responsible for the assumption by many, if not most, scientists that the only genuine test of truth lies in the ability to construct a mathematical equivalent, and in assuming that the behavior of this model is identical with the behavior of nature. The fact</page><page sequence="7">Educational Research: The Romance of Quantification 115 that close parallels often exist between mathematics and nature seems to confirm the deception. Actually, of course, mathematics is only a way of expressing man's interpretations of nature, and there is no objective reason to suppose that the rigid and arbitrary rules on which we build our "language of numbers" indicate the existence of "laws of nature." Science has allowed itself to fall into the same trap which the medieval scholastic philosophers did, that of becoming infatuated with the language itself and deriving "truths" from arbitrary rules originally built into it. Quantitation has become a kind of god which is worship- ped in much the same way that the monastic philosophers worshipped their God. In both cases, all truth is required to fit into a pre- determined system of ritualistic logic. In one case, it had to fit into "the will of God." In the other case, it is required to fit into a mathematical formula. Any other class of theory is heretic, being despised as "lacking in precision," a modern-day equivalent to the older condemnation, "work of the devil." The mathematical viewpoint sufficiently approximates the truth of physical phenomena that it has extensive pragmatic usefulness. Fal- lacies appear only when we view nature at the molecular and celestial levels. The danger inherent in the Newtonian viewpoint is not that of lack of usefulness, but the tendency to become a belief, a faith, a criterion of credibility against which all truth is measured. Empirically, it is sound, but philosophically it is false. The abuses often practiced in the name of quantitative science are comparable to the clever device employed by an anthropologist who wished to teach elementary sanitation to a group of primitive people. He advised them that the water from a contaminated stream nearby was filled with evil spirits, that these spirits could be destroyed by fire, and to avoid being cursed by these spirits the natives had to boil the water before drinking it. The natives offered no resistance to this theory, appeared to com- prehend it perfectly, and quickly adopted the recommendations. Any scientific discussion with them of typhoid or dysentery would have gotten nowhere. Such is the case with today's mechanistic scientist. We can get him to act on a hypothesis if we first assure him that the subject in question contains measurable phenomena. If we ask him to undertake a study in which quantitation is inapplicable he shies away in great alarm, crying out that it is "unscientific." He is willing only to study that which is measurable, assuming this to be the criterion of all that is scientific. "Objective" really means "independent of human bias." Since mathematics is a human creation, and a product of the human wish for orderliness, it is difficult to see how its use liberates science from human bias. Objectivity is in truth a quality that a given scientist may or may not possess. If he does possess it, his observations will be objective. A non-objective scientist cannot conceal his bias behind numbers.</page><page sequence="8">116 Etcetera • SUMMER 1982 Without specifying how many scientists we have been referring to, we have implied that many, or most, of them are unscientific in their thinking. To the extent to which this is true, it would follow that objectivity is rare in science. We know this unobjective quality is characteristic of some scientists, and we suspect it is true of many. Perhaps the greatest harm done by this trend is through the way in which today's public image of science is being created. Statistics, numbers, and measurements are being advertised as the epitome of scientific thinking. According to these criteria, unquantified observa- tions and studies receive little respect, and even less in the way of financial support from the dispensers of research grants. Apparently many of the spokesmen for science have advanced their scientific sophistication only as far as the philosophy of Newtonian physics taught in high schools. The more modern viewpoint, initiated a half-century ago by Einstein and Planck, has little influence on the philosophy behind much of what passes for science today. In the science of human behavior we see the most glaring abuses of the quantitation myth. The very essence of human behavior is its qualitative aspects. The differences between "normal" and "abnormal" behavior are determinable only by qualitative judgments invented by society, and any attempt to translate these differences into quantitative terms is naive. Even the attempts to measure intelligence itself in quantitative values are as misguided as would be efforts to measure the truth of some statement on the basis of counting the number of people who agreed with it. Behavioral science, being one of the youngest of the disciplines, has attracted more than its share of amateurs. These enthusiastic innocents, captivated with the glamour of sharing the spotlight, tend to go overboard with anything they regard as "scientific." Knowing the reverence in which mathematics is held by other scientists, they tend to distort their observations of people into a quantitative mold, hoping, no doubt, to enhance their status in the scientific world. The more seasoned of the behavioral scientists are content to await their day, when the world will become disillusioned over numbers, and will show more attention to the source from which scientific data is derived and less attention to the language of its expression. In addition to the problems caused by the reification of numbers, educational research is self-constrained by an emphasis on posing narrowly focussed convergent questions. William D. Rohwer ad- dressed this problem at an American Educational Research Associa- tion (AERA) meeting a few years ago. He said (in "Children and Adolescents: Should We Teach Them or Let Them Learn?," Changing Education : Alternatives from Educational Research , M.C. Wittrock (ed.), Prentice-Hall, 1973.): We are largely ignorant when it comes to answering questions about vital issues in education. What should be taught? When should it be</page><page sequence="9">Educational Research: The Romance of Quantification 117 taught? How should it be taught? To whom should it be taught? What are the consequences of teaching this rather than that, of teaching it now rather than then, of teaching this way rather than that way, to this person as well as to that person? If candid, our professional response to these questions is that we don't know. Indeed, we might even take some measure of pride in the response. As researchers, it is fitting to disclaim possession of final answers and to advertise the boundaries of our knowledge. Thus, we can justly enjoy good feelings about declaring the modesty of our wisdom. But whatever comfort we derive from this honest statement of our limitations, it cannot last long because we are also committed to making significant reductions in our ignorance. If you find this appraisal too extreme to deserve consideration, imagine yourself in the role of a trusted and respected consultant, endowed with all of the most powerful theory, evidence, information, and skills that we share collectively. Suppose a client comes to you with the questions just mentioned for the purpose of implementing your answers by establishing an entirely new system of schooling. Assume the client has all of the resources necessary for accomplishing this purpose excepting only the information he seeks from you. To inject a note of realism, let him impose two conditions: that the system should serve a population having a composition comparable to that in the United States; and that the maximum time he can allow you to answer the questions is ten years. Also suppose the client offers to fund your efforts to obtain answers, on whatever scale necessary, for the ten-year period. In advance, he requires only two things of you: that you explain the methods you propose to use, showing their potential for answering the questions; and that you give him your personal assurance that the probability of your success is reasonably high. Suppose that success simply means obtaining enough answers to yield some concrete propo- sals for a program of schooling. Could you comply? I am not confident that I could. And the reasons for my pessimism do not seem trival - they do not concern shortages of trained personnel, nor an inability to estimate costs, nor a fear that an interval of ten years is too short, even though it probably is. The reason is that I note precious little evidence that questions of the kind asked by the client are the questions typically addressed by educational research. If this appraisal is accurate, it is dismaying because it seems to me that the questions posed by the client are important questions. They are obviously the same questions that are being asked currently about schooling in the United States. The imaginary client, after all, is not a product of pure fantasy. He could easily be a district superintendent, a school board chairman, or, more likely, a visible representative of the public. . . . Rohwer then mentions two of many possible reasons why research to date has produced too few answers for vital educational questions: first, it may be practically impossible to do decisive research in education, and, second, educational researchers may be too conven-</page><page sequence="10">118 Etcetera • SUMMER 1982 tional or conservative to engage in it. I would add that another reason why research has produced too few answers to vital educational questions is that it is too constrained by the kinds of paradigms I referred to earlier. These mechanistic paradigms, based on the transportation theory of communication, may be appropriate for certain kinds of training, but they are totally inadequate for dealing with education. We need other paradigms. In relation to the paradigm problem, Herbert Walberg (1) (of the Wisconsin Research and Development Center for Cognitive Learn- ing) pointed out that: Thomas Kuhn [has] termed underdeveloped fields of science "pre- paradigmatic." He defined "paradigms" as "universally recognized scientific achievements that for a time provide model problems and solutions to a community of practitioners." In distinguishing "pre- paradigmatic" and "normal" science, Kuhn writes: No natural history can be interpreted in the absence of at least some implicit body of intertwined theoretical and methodological belief that permits selection, evaluation, and criticism. If that body of belief is not already implicit in the collection of facts - in which case more than "mere facts" are at hand - it must be externally supplied, perhaps by a current metaphysic, by another science, or by personal or historical accident. No wonder, then, that in the early stages of development of any science different men confront- ing the same particular phenomena, describe and interpret them in different ways. By this characterization of nascent disciplines, then, educational research and evaluation are in an early stage of development. Gage, for example, has summarized some paradigms for research on teaching, but none would meet Kuhn' s criterion of universal recognition. While these and other paradigms in education have been useful in isolated research efforts, none has led to a programmatic, cumulative series of studies. Much of educational research is atheoretical, and what theoret- ical work has been accomplished is largely derived from physical, biological, and social sciences, from philosophy, or from personal idiosyncrasies. Even aside from theory, fundamental and unresolved methodological problems of gathering "facts" plague educational research and evaluation. Research workers and schoolmen alike have been disappointed in the practical results of experimental methods in education. Experimenters argue that more precise measurement and rigorous research designs are likely to bear fruit eventually. But other investigators question the appropriateness of quantitative methods and use in their place methods of anecdotal descriptions of classroom events, like those of the social anthropologist, or observation and intuition, in the manner of a clinical psychologist. The point is not to bewail the inadequacy of various methods of gathering "facts," but to</page><page sequence="11">Educational Research: The Romance of Quantification 119 illustrate the necessity for a re-assessment of educational evaluation, its theory, practice, and their interdependence. . . . . . . And in describing the controversy over objectives, Herbert Walberg refers to a point made by Benjamin Bloom to the effect that: . . . less specific objectives may be more appropriate for educational media designed for teacher use. Indeed, it may be that a teacher's rigid adherence to pre-determined, specific objectives may impede student learning in much of education. Now in training, as opposed to liberal education, a number of explicit objectives are set forth; they can be "covered" by a teacher, programmed materials, or, probably just as effectively, by a textbook. Training is most effective when the objec- tives are explicit and when adequate motivation or reinforcement can be assumed as in military or industrial settings. Such training is characterized by its emphasis on the acquisition of basic skills, which can often be defined behaviorally. On the other hand, curriculum makers, school boards, and teachers aspire to inculcate ideals, values, social skills, and other intangibles. They are concerned with higher order cognitive processes such as analysis and critical thinking. Moreover, both the teacher and the students bring important, though vague, objectives, ideas, and inter- ests to class, some permanent, others transient. Paradoxically, these random elements lend caprice and serendipity to the class that may be far more important to the attainment of general ideals than pre- determined specific objectives and lessons. Or certain events of the day may conjoin unexpectedly with the teacher's planned objectives and activities. These occurrences inject relevance, suspense, humor, and other human qualities to learning that are impossible with a pro- grammed machine, a programmed course, or a programmed teacher. I must say that there is little in the present discourse about "accountability" that recognizes the important kinds of distinctions between training and education that Walberg makes. The political rather than the educational concerns of accountability become quite clear as Walberg discusses the impact of the limits on research imposed by Federal funding agencies requiring the statement of mechanistic objectives in all proposals. He says: Their rhetoric seems to insist that what is not objectively specified and precisely measured does not exist or is not important, and further, that what is most measurable is most important. Taken to an extreme, the argument holds that social and affective learning may be ignored since it is difficult to measure; that, in cognitive domains, essay examinations are undesirable because they lack technical standards or reliability; and that hope lies in multiple-choice tests because they are efficient and require no judgment in scoring. And, this may be right; it remains to be seen. But until there is convincing evidence to support these kinds of assertions, it is dangerous to force such an orthodoxy on the schools.</page><page sequence="12">120 Et cetera • SUMMER 1982 Well, in several states, this orthodoxy seems to have been forced on the schools, and most of what passes for educational research here serves to intensify rather than to ameliorate the imposition of this orthodoxy. The rhetoric and assumptions of business and systems management has begun to displace educational theory and philoso- phy in the formulation of school policies and procedures, and I know of no substantive educational research that is raising any questions about this. And there is yet more being imposed on both teacher education and teacher "evaluation" in the schools by the current BTE/CBTE "movement." The rush to "evaluate competencies" seems once again to be motivated by something other than a serious educational philosophy, and, again, most of the activity in educational research has by-passed the crucial questions. Richard Turner (associate dean for research and development at Indiana University) is one of the few educational researchers who has resisted the rush to point out some of the grievous shortcomings of the present activity. He has said, (in "Teacher Education: The Whys and Hows of Reform," American Teacher , February, 1975) for example, that: A major difficulty with CBTE is that it has never had good conceptual underpinnings. Robert Houston has said (1974) that CBTE rests on our cultural concepts of accountability and of personalization. These two concepts, however, do not provide a rationale for this view of teacher education; rather, they state its objectives. They do not offer cogent intellectual arguments demonstrating why teacher education should be conducted in this particular way. Because CBTE/TC does not have a good conceptual base, its basis in research evidence is quite important. The type of research evidence needed to support CBTE/TC is quite clear and is as follows: First, a competency-based program requires the selection of com- petencies to be mastered by candidates. If candidates are held responsi- ble for bringing about pre-specified levels of student achievement, the competencies selected must be those that lead to better pupil learning. That is to say that the competencies selected must be demonstrated to be valid. The problem is that research on teaching has not been able to turn up such a set of competencies. Indeed, the most recent research (Brophy, 1974) suggests that the same teacher behaviors or "competencies" have a different effect with different types of pupils. For example, highly critical teachers get good achievement from middle-class students in the elementary school, but poor achievement from working-class students. Thus, selecting a list of competencies and assuming they are valid, or will lead to better pupil learning, is more likely than not to be naive from a research viewpoint. If CBTE is to succeed rather than fail, the research basis for valid competencies must be established.</page><page sequence="13">Educational Research: The Romance of Quantification 121 As has variously been noted, the constraints imposed upon educational research by the metaphors and paradigms, the language of "accountability," systems management, behavior modification, and statistics have grievously distorted discourse about schooling. Not that there haven't been warnings about the hazards involved in such a witless shift to such language in formulating school policy and procedure. Back in the days before the escalation in our national neuroses (that has reached the point where millions will rally round any promise that produces the illusion of control over something in a world in which there is obviously no control over anything) it was not unusual to find the belief articulated that any attempt at an analogy between business and education was specious. In 1929, for example, Alfred North Whitehead said (in The Aims of Education , MacMillan): . . . the management of a university faculty has no analogy to that of a business organization . . . The faculty should be a band of scholars, stimulating each other, and freely determining their various activities. You can secure certain formal requirements, that lectures be given at stated times and that instructors and students are in attendance, but the heart of the matter lies beyond all regulation. . . . The modern university system in the great democratic countries will only be successful if the ultimate authorities exercise singular restraint, so as to remember that universities cannot be dealt with according to the rules and policies which apply to the familiar business corporations. . . . (p. 104, Mentor edition, 1949) This kind of reminder that there are differences between educa- tion and business that really make a difference is hard to find in the language about schooling in recent years, so drastic has been the displacement by accountability and systems talk. I did find, however, one, explicit statement by a university president that is so distinguished by its rarity that it is almost exotic. Harold Enarson, President of Ohio State said in 1973: There is a tempting heresy loose in the land. Very simply, it is the dangerous notion that state universities are simply another agency of state government, a unit to be policed, regulated, and whipped into a bureaucratic mold. In this view, the university is simply a production unit in the knowledge industry . . . . . . Make no mistake about it, in state after state, a managerial revolution is steadily under way. It threatens to convert relatively free-standing, self-directing institutions of higher learning into homogenized state-systems. The old faiths - academic freedom, institutional initiative, institutional flexibility - are pushed aside. The new articles of faith are control, coordination, efficiency, and some- thing called "accountability."</page><page sequence="14">122 Et cetera • SUMMER 1982 ... To the new managers the university is just another large system. It has raw material (students), a labor force (faculty and support personnel), instruments of production (classrooms, laboratories, librar- ies), a production schedule (academic requirements, classes admitted, classes graduated), management (trustees and central administration), and a production index (the cost of producing a student credit-hour). In this view, faculty are worker bees, producing quietly, unobtrusively, on schedule their "fair share" of the units of production. The product (students) reflects "value-added" in manufacture. The cheerful as- sumption is that more has been put in your head than taken out. ... In my considered judgment, the managerial revolution creates the exact reverse of the goals that are sought. (President Harold L. Enarson, Ohio State University in "Univer- sity or Knowledge Factory?" The Chronicle of Higher Education, June 18,1973.) So rare and infrequent are statements such as this and so pervasive is the language of "management" that Enarson is, given the insidious pressures to "get with the program," more heroic than romantic. This "tempting heresy" toward bureaucratic control over educa- tion is fostered, as I've said, by an increasingly pervasive anxiety among us produced by a reluctant awareness that change in every- thing is occurring at such a rapid rate that nothing is under control. One of the most interesting paradoxes produced by this anxiety and its concomitant increase in the need for the illusion of control is that while it results from the failure of old assumptions, slogans, and metaphors, it simultaneously produces greater effort to invoke and to depend upon those same old assumptions, slogans, and metaphors. It is, indeed, fanaticism, as defined by Santayana, who said that "Fanaticism consists of redoubling your efforts after having forgot- ten your aims." The universe of discourse that both produces and is produced by the mindless analogic confusion of education with business includes such metaphors as: productivity, input-output, school plant, pro- gram products, product evaluation, priorities, resources, modules, instructional delivery systems, accountability information manage- ment, prorating fte/s to program categories, objective evaluative criteria, contingency management, management by objectives, task analysis, behavioral objectives, operant conditioning, schedule of reinforcement, and so on and on. The most obvious thing to say about all of this terminology is that it ignores, omits, and excludes any reference to human beings. This is a crucial characteristic of such language. It is a curious kind of reverse anthropomorphism. This technocratic language, by remov- ing all reference to human characteristics, reduces human beings to things. That is a high price to pay in the Faustian bargain with</page><page sequence="15">Educational Research: The Romance of Quantification 123 "accountability" for the illusion of control and certainty. One of the irrational curiosities about the current form of "accoun- tability" in the schools, and there are many, is that it totally ignores more than thirty years worth of research conducted by business and industry that has produced irrefutable "hard data" about worker morale (morale is incidentally a word that has all but totally disappeared from talk about school personnel) and productivity. Study after study has demonstrated beyond equivocation that work- ers are demoralized and productivity diminished when: 1. the production goals are set by others 2. operating techniques are standardized 3. detailed operations are routinized 4. the work product is not seen as meaningful in a larger social context 5. the individual sees himself as almost immediately replaceable 6. experimentation on the job is specifically discouraged 7. the emphasis is upon quantity vs. quality in the end product, even though the antithesis is not necessary 8. the differences in individual talents, and the quality of individual talents is made irrelevant by standardization 9. problems which arise during the course of production are settled by fiat from above 10. the occupation itself is seen by the worker as being socially depre- ciated by others, especially by his superordinates at work. (Melvin Tumin, "Obstacles to Creativity," ETC., Summer, 1954, p. 269) Now, I submit that this list of negative procedures is characteristic of every public school - at every level - struggling under the weight of "accountability" and other mindless attempts at imposing "control." The relentless pressure to standardize everything from course numbering systems to every section of every course has elevated the misbegotten ethic of fungibility from the level of clerical convenience to the level of divine desirability, and the most depressing aspect of this process is the silence with which most faculties, including educational researchers, simply accept it. When cognizance is taken of other "aversive" factors affecting schools, the degree to which the problem of "productivity" and "efficiency" is exacerbated can be sensed. The combination of administrative harassment in the name of accountability combined with the economic penalties that have been levied by both external and internal forces has made school into a virtually reward free environment for teachers. And while this kind of deterioration is occurring, research of crucial significance to education is being done outside of any formal concern with "improving" schooling.</page><page sequence="16">124 Et cetera • SUMMER 1982 For example, J. E. Bogen, a neurosurgeon who did much of the early research with R. W. Sperry in "hemisphericity" has reported on "Some Educational Aspects of Hemispheric Specialization" (in a special issue of The Educator , the UCLA Graduate School of Education journal in the Spring of 1975.) I want to quote from him to illustrate one of the most important areas of all in which educational research needs to be conducted. ... we have finally learned a fact about the brain which is directly relevant to everyday pedagogical practice. How little we do know is emphasized by the primitiveness of this fact. It is most simply, that the brain is double, in the sense that each cerebral hemisphere is capable of functioning independently, each in a manner different from the other. One way to look at this new information is to see how it might apply to an ancient problem: the dichotomous nature of "knowing." I mean by this the conclusion which has been reached by a long series of students of the mind, namely, that we typically employ two different "kinds of intelligence" or (in a more modern vocabulary) two different "sets of information-processing rules." After arriving at this conclu- sion, each scholar has then offered his own favorite dichotomy; [These range from Apollonian-Dionysian through convergent-divergent and rational metaphonic to atomistic-gross.] What we have is an overabundance of choices . . . attributable to the ambiguities inherent in the "closed box" approach to the brain. In the closed-box approach, one compares input with output and then concludes that the transformations which have occurred require that there be two separate mechanisms or processes within the box whose activity is combined in varying ratios. A given behavioral output can usually be explained in terms of any number of different pairs of hypothesized brain processes. And a choice among the many available pairs is often urged upon us for reasons which are hardly distinguish- able from personal idiosyncrasy. There is a better way: we can open the box and see how it is structured within. What we see, when we do this, is that there are indeed two apparatuses (cerebral hemispheres), each capable of cogni- tive processing independently in some degree one from the other; and these hemispheres are clearly different in function. One might at this juncture ask the question, "Why not three or four or more types of intelligence?" A complete answer to this question would involve us in a complicated (factor analytic) discussion. For now, I would offer a short answer assuming two types of intelligence, rather than some larger number, appeals not only for reasons of parsimony, but it has the very important advantage of conforming with neuroanatomical reality. A dichotomy which has a sound anatomicophysiologic basis is one which ascribes the input-output transformations to the interaction of two principal and different types of cognition each typically identifiable with one of the two cerebral hemispheres. Our concept of the Mind will</page><page sequence="17">Educational Research: The Romance of Quantification 125 then depend upon what we understand of the specialized capacities of each hemisphere. In contrast, it is appealing and helpful to suppose that these various tasks have some underlying processes in common - that is, that each hemisphere is specialized for a particular type of information process- ing less available to the other. What distinguishes hemispheric spe- cialization is not so much certain kinds of material (e.g., words for the left, faces for the right) but the way in which the material is processed. In other words, hemispheric differences are more usefully considered in terms of process specificity rather than material specificity. Levy, et al wrote: All four of the present tests confirmed in different ways the presence of a fundamental difference in the way the right and left hemispheres perceive things. More than a slight preference in a competitive situation, the results suggest a strong basic differentia- tion. Where the kind of task being tested could be performed by either left or right hemisphere, the two hemispheres accomplished the same task by characteristically different strategies. To describe appositionality as "spatial" hardly encompasses its musical and other auditory aspects, most notably timbre recognition; and it blithely ignores the obvious need for " spatial perception" in the left-hemisphere act of reading. To characterize it as "synthetic" similarly ignores the synthetic aspects of language formulation, a typically left-hemisphere activity. Although the left hemisphere is dominant for speaking, reading, calculation, and writing, the right hemisphere is not "non-verbal." As pointed out by Gazzaniga, the right hemispheres of split-brain patients have shown a considerable verbal capacity. We would be in error to consider the right hemisphere less "semantic" than the left. There has even been found some syntactic capability. But this capability is insufficient, even at best, for the construction of sentences of more than a few elements. Propositionality, in other words , is only minimally present in the right hemisphere . And this is true even in the extreme condition of recovery after left hemispherectomy. We can say, therefore, that the rules of information processing typical of the right hemispheres of well-lateralized right-handers are not the rules characteristic of syntax or linguistic transformation. In spite of remaining uncertainties, enough is known to motivate some conjectures regarding certain educational policies and practices. Possible implications. The notion of two largely lateralized modes of thought suggests that teaching by either precept or percept affects primarily one or the other hemisphere. Learning of almost any idea is likely to be better if both methods are used. This means that teaching solely by example is as open to the charge of one-sidedness as is a college curriculum consisting solely of lecture courses.</page><page sequence="18">126 Et cetera • SUMMER 1982 Since education is effective only in so far as it affects the working of the brain, we can see that an elementary-school program narrowly restricted to reading, writing, and arithmetic will educate mainly one hemisphere, leaving half of an individual's high-level potential un- schooled. We are accustomed to hear these days, of the "culturally disadvan- taged," those persons whose propositional potential has remained underdeveloped for lack of relevant exposure. There is likely a parallel lack of appositional development in persons whose only education consists of the three "R's." That is, just as the left-hemisphere potential for propositionizing may be underdeveloped, so too should we expect that right-hemisphere capacities can suffer educational neglect. Have we heretofore erred in overemphasizing the values of an analytical attitude, or even of rationality? The physicist Gell-Mann has stressed the importance of what he calls "preliminary phenomenologi- cal schemes" in ordering our observations beginning with the percep- tion of apparent patterns in the data. In the construction of such a scheme: One is guided mainly by the data . . . sometimes even discarding a few as possibly being experimental errors . . . and not by deep reasoning from theoretical principles or from underlying dynamical arguments. The atomic chart of Mendeleev and the evolutionary theory of Darwin were schemes of this sort whose underlying mechanisms were not understood for generations. The overambitious attempt to intro- duce Newtonian theorizing prematurely can be as unproductive (he notes) as either aimless data gathering or the presently fashionable construction of computer models, often on a grandiose scale and often of little relation to the data already available. Gell-Mann concluded: Do we sufficiently encourage scheme-makers, particularly qualita- tive ones? Perhaps in our educational system we lay too little emphasis on natural history. Perhaps in our schools and univer- sities and throughout the whole battery of intelligence and achievement tests that we use, we do not seek out enough persons with the talent to do the kind of work done by Mendeleev and Darwin ... I would like to encourage our society to search for such people, and to support them. In a recent review of hemispheric specialization, Sperry wrote: The main theme to emerge from the foregoing facts is that there appear to be two modes of thinking, verbal and non-verbal, represented rather separately in left and right hemispheres, respec- tively, and that our educational system, as well as science in general, tends to neglect the non-verbal form of intellect. What it comes down to is that modern society discriminates against the right hemisphere.</page><page sequence="19">Educational Research: The Romance of Quantification 127 If our society has overemphasized propositionality at the expense of appositionality, more is involved than the adjustment difficulties of isolated individuals. It means that the entire student body is being educated lopsidedly. Have not certain pedagogic policies often tended to aggravate and prolong this one-sidedness? For example, the usual justification of "IQ" tests is that they predict further scholastic achievement and that the latter is in turn predictive of "life success." This is intimately based upon a criterion of "success" which is not only most often measured monetarily, but seems to depend in part upon an analytic attitude hypertrophied by centuries of contention against nature. It is a view which culminates, when extreme, in measuring national "success" by the gross national product and in measuring progress of the human species in terms of total population. The latter criterion was explicitly adopted by Childe; such a criterion is clear, quantitative, and graphable; and it avoids altogether any concern for the quality of human existence. Stanley did a scholarly review on the prediction of success by the use of the scholastic aptitude test (SAT) and related measures. Having meticulously supported with many sources that such tests predict success in college, he then resorted to plain old common sense to argue that they are also predictive of "life success." He asked: . . . What is the probability that out of 1000 carefully tested eight-year-old boys, who have IQ's of 90, there will emerge even one mathematician or Shakespearean scholar on the Ph.D. level? Why not a sculptor, singer, painter, poet, or politician? A possible answer to this question is, perhaps, that although a school may enjoy an art or music department, its primary purpose should be to encourage intellectuality, i.e., left-hemisphere potential. Which suggests that many students consider their instruction "irrelevant," not just because they find their courses difficult (as Stanley suggests) but because they view "life success" differently than he does. They are concerned not only with rationality but with sensitivity. They are concerned not so much with making a living as making a life. They see a world of warring elders, busily Becoming at the expense of Being, who want them to be unhappy in the same half-brained way. The fight with nature for survival is won, they feel; and it is time we learn to live within nature as bilaterally educated, whole persons. Such sentiments are difficult to evaluate for various reasons, but that they exist is hardly arguable, and their influence seems to be spreading. (Witness the recent promise by President Gerald Ford that his adminis- tration will help young people to ". . . get a job that makes sense as well as money.") We sense about us a growing awareness of the values of the more complex, the interdependent, the non-verbal and, (one is tempted to say) the appositional. It is surely encouraging to find Arthur Jensen - often considered an apostle of less education for certain persons - saying</page><page sequence="20">128 Et cetera • SUMMER 1982 Future solutions will take the form not so much of attempting to minimize differences in scholastic aptitudes and motivation, but of creating a greater diversity of curricula. Instructional methods and educational goals and values that will make it possible for children ranging over a wider spectrum of abilities and proclivities genuinely to benefit from their years in school. It may be a principal virtue of these more recent findings about the brain, not only to serve as scientific support for a more diversified curriculum and not only to provide some direction for this diversifica- tion, but also to stimulate a new set of questions for those who will pilot the future of education. We have a few new landmarks; hopefully they will help us steer a better course. So, in conclusion, what I have been trying to say is that there is a need for serious thoughtful questions well beyond those concerned with techniques for generating yet more "data." There is a great need for questions about the assumptions underly- ing most current educational research. There is a need to ask questions that are addressed to substantive purposes even more than those addressed to quantifiable objectives. There is a need for questions to determine the meanings that students make of school "curriculum" beyond the usual standardized "recognition" tests. There is a need for questions that can synthesize what is already known. There is a need for questions that focus on strategies for implementing the best of what is known. There is a need for questions addressed to the problem of improving the quality of life within schools - for students and teachers. And, there is a need for entirely new kinds of questions derived from new areas of research outside of education, such as that being conducted in relation to brain function, that require new assumptions and new paradigms for all school conventions, including educational research.
