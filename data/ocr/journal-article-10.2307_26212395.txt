Blair Campbell Summary The sense of estrangement from contemporary politics expressed by Plato, Isocrates, and others in fourth-century Athens resulted not solely from deteriorating political conditions (as these thinkers suggest), but also from the notion of the professional intellectual as politician that often shaped their political expectations. This notion rests on a framework of aims, techniques, and obligations so completely at odds with Athens' political heritage as to foster estrangement under any conditions. The inadequacies of the fourth-century construct of the political intel lectual become apparent when appraised in the context of Athens' tradition of political leadership. Past leaders such as Solon and Pericles had accepted as their guide in political affairs the notion of reason that Aristotle was later to describe as phronesis, practical reason. Here the function of political know ledge is not to shape or transform the city in accordance with 'higher' or external norms, but rather to accept as fundamental the consensual aims of the citizenry; these are the stipulated ends defining the leader's mandate. The fourth-century conception of leadership rejects this traditional view of thought as subordinate to action. The leader is no longer presented as agent of the established values of public life. His mandate now is defined by aims peculiar to the professional intellectual's craft: the city must be reconstituted to accord with norms more akin to those expressed in Aristotle's sophia than to phronesis. As a consequence of this shift in priorities, the notion of the professional intellectual as political leader is anomalous both in analytic perspective and ethical implication. It cannot address the familiar problems of practical politics, and it even poses new problems that remain insoluble within its framework. Furthermore, the leader's obligations to his constituency become so tentative and restricted within this conception as to render such leadership t I am deeply grateful to Dr F.D.

In contrast to his traditional counterpart, this leader is entitled, even duty-bound, to abandon his post should the city fail to conform to his expectations, for his ultimate allegiances lie elsewhere. Unlike Athens' traditional leaders, he can readily accept a posture of political estrangement because his intellectual calling is not bound up inextricably with the fate of Athens. Introduction It was generally accepted among Athens' political thinkers of the fourth century BC that they had scored a triumph for political tradition as well as for intellect by introducing the conception of the intellectual (or philosopher) as statesman. My purpose here is to examine the validity of some of their more important claims regarding this notion of a leader who commands by dint of his intellectual virtuosity. In this respect Plato is an accurate spokesman for fourth-century thinkers in Athens. The first, perhaps, to issue these claims, he defines both the problem of Athenian politics and its solution in terms of fealty to an intellectual governing class. According to this assessment, Athens had suffered a sharp decline in the quality of her political life because she had abandoned her great tradition of intellectual leadership. Whereas formerly the city had given control of public affairs to the most intellectually gifted among her citizens— those superior in wisdom and judgment, as well as virtue—she now denies intellectuals their rightful place in politics.1 Those citizens who remain com mitted to the disinterested principles of justice and the orderly life enjoined by intellect no longer occupy the foreground of politics.2 Now the city is directed by a class of self-serving politicians who, devoid of a sense of loyalty or public-spiritedness, routinely sacrifice the common good to their personal ' Compare, for example, Plato's praise for the leaders of former times in Menexenus, 238d-239a with Isocrates' Areopagiticus, passim·, Aeschines' praise of Solon 'and the other lawgivers of those days', Against Timarchus, 6-7; and Demosthenes' comment on the esteem accorded Solon in Against Timocrates, 113,211.

Although Plato's diagnosis affords little basis for optimism in other res pects, it does offer a comparatively jubilant prospect for the intellectual in politics. The philosopher's political disengagement is at times expedient but it is never inevitable or permanent.5 Despite his misgivings about his own capacity for political action,6 Plato retained the belief (at least up to the time of Dion's Sicilian venture) that, given sufficient power and a modicum of luck, the philosophically-enlightened ruler could subject the state to the 'mar vellous overhauling' it required.7 Here Plato would appear to be placing his philosopher within the political tradition founded in Athens by Solon.8 Like Solon, Plato's philosopher is a political agent, at least in principle; that he is unable to execute his function within fourth-century Athens can only reflect 1 Gorg., 502e; compare Isocrates, Areopagiticus (hereafter Areop.), 47-52; Demosthenes, On the Crown, 61; Demosthenes, Against Timocrates, 157, The orators here echo a favourite theme of Aristophanes; see esp. Knights, passim. 4 Socrates was 'the most just of men' (Seventh Letter, 324e); the 'only man of the present time who manages affairs of state' (Gorg., 521d). 5 The early and middle dialogues do not, for example, draw the conclusion of twentieth-century scholarship that 'it is practically given by the nature of the intellectual's orientation that there should be some tensions between the intellectuals and the value-orientations embodied in the actual institutions of any society'; Edward Shils, 'The Intellectuals and the Powers', in On Intellectuals, ed. Philip Rief (Garden City, 1970), p. 32. 6 Here I assume the validity of the Seventh Letter, which lists among the motives for Plato's return to Syracuse a dread 'most of all, lest haply I should seem to myself to be utterly and absolutely nothing more than a mere voice and never to undertake willingly an action'; 328cd. 7 Seventh Letter, p. 326ab. 8 Plato's general attitude of scepticism regarding Athens' more recent leadership did not extend to Solon who, described in Timaeus as the wisest of the Seven Sages (20e), is viewed primarily as an intellectual of the fourth-century type; he attained his immortality as a λογογράφος έν πόλει; see Phaedrus, 258c. Plato's relation to Athenian political tradition is quite complex, however, as 1 have emphasized elsewhere. See B. Campbell, 'Intellect and the Political Order in Plato's Republic', History of Political Thought, I (1980), pp. 361-89, as well as below. Although as philosopher he would fain create the ideal polity afresh, unencumbered by tradition, as patriot he seems to have remained deeply respectful of Athenian tradition throughout his life. The author of Seventh Letter avows that Plato would not meddle in the settled life of his parents (and thus of his mother city) no matter how odious such a life might seem to Plato; 331bd.

CAMPBELL upon his city.9 Plato even suggests at times that his philosopher is the fulfil ment of ideals expressed but never perfectly realized within Athenian trad ition. This philosopher is able to effect the moral betterment of his fellow citizens and thus can succeed where Athens' historic leadership had failed.10 This view seems to have been accepted without serious challenge among those Athenian intellectuals who were interested in fourth-century politics. Isocrates, Plato's rival, and even Demosthenes of the next generation (far more sophisticated in practical politics than either Isocrates or Plato) also cast themselves as guardians of Athenian tradition." These thinkers, who do not share Plato's misgivings about political involvement, betray no hint of doubt or reservation regarding their claims to have maintained an unimpaired continuity with the great intellectual leaders who presided over Athens during her ascendancy. For example, Isocrates identifies himself as a philosophic orator in the grand tradition of Solon, Cleisthenes, Themistocles, and Pericles,12 and Demosthenes boasts that his principles 'resemble in spirit and purpose those of the venerated names of antiquity'.13 What renders the fourth-century thinkers uniquely suited as claimants to this great heritage, in their estimate, is the disinterested, public perspective14 afforded by their calling as intellectuals. Intellect alone is immune to the allurements of private interest; its purview—the comprehensive and law abiding—must exclude the petty, the merely idiosyncratic. Only the intel lectual, then, is capable of a truly political techne, by reason of his com manding view of the interests of the city as a whole.15 The intellectual of "Yet Plato retains his misgivings on this score throughout most of the dialogues.

Republic (hereafter Repub. ), 428bd.</page><page sequence="5">THOUGHT AND POLITICAL ACTION 21 Isocrates and Demosthenes, like the ideal leader adumbrated in Plato's Gorgias, is marked above all else by his disinterested pursuit of justice and the public good. He is quintessentially a public man, both in his perspective and loyalties. According to Isocrates, the man of wisdom should devote himself to the interests of his city and, additionally, the interests of all Hellas. Conse quently, the discourses of Isocrates deal not with private disputes but rather with Hellenic concerns of the broadest scope and with affairs of state.16 Similarly, Demosthenes claims that his intellectual prowess has always been exercised on public matters: 'My purposes are my countrymen's purposes; I have no peculiar or personal end to serve'.17 That these men rarely prevail in their exalted political designs in no way refutes their conception of the intellectual's role or their claim regarding its connection with ancestral grandeur, at least from their perspective. Like Socrates and Plato, they are merely victims of Athens' retrograde develop ment. The citizen body has been transmogrified into a self-indulgent mob; it has lapsed into 'folly and confusion', lusting after 'evil ways', Isocrates observes. In her present mood she has no desire for public men of superior intellectual ability.18 The fault, in short, lay with Athens rather than her intellectuals. By resisting their leadership she was rejecting her own tradition, to her immense detriment. The conviction that they were bearers of this tradition thus appears to have remained unshakable among these spokesmen. Yet there are problems both with this self-identification of the fourth century thinkers as guardians of Athens' ancient style of leadership, and— perhaps more important—with their claim that the intellectual is uniquely competent to preside over political affairs by reason of an intrinsically public perspective. As they themselves realized, to varying degrees, these spokes men had assumed a new role within Athenian politics, that of the professional intellectual. If we understand 'political intellectual' to refer to the individual who claims competence to exercise political leadership solely by force of ideas, quite apart from considerations of his efficacy in military or political affairs, then it can be said without inordinate distortion that this role is largely a fourth-century creation, making its first literary appearance in Plato's 16 Antid., 38.40. 17 Demosthenes, On the Crown, 277, 281-2. 18 Areop., 76; Isocrates, On the Peace, 13.

CAMPBELL middle dialogues and the orations of Isocrates.19 There were, of course, fifth-century anticipations of the new role. Socrates had at times described his intellectual vocation in quasi-political terms (gadfly to the city), and the Sophists no doubt had issued extravagant proclamations regarding their expertise in matters of justice, as Plato charges. But these were not yet political intellectuals, at least according to our restricted usage, since they did not seek to direct the course of politics. Just as Socrates (and this applies to the Socrates of Xenophon no less than that of Plato20) had shunned the political arena from principle, so had the Sophists, mostly foreigners, from necessity.21 Thus the very novelty of their role would seem to create some embarrassment for those intellectuals who would claim unqualified continuity with the past. Even more problematic for this claim is that the intellectual's professional ization entails a tacit redirection of perspective and commitment which would appear to signal a fundamental change in his relation to politics. At the most obvious level, one notes that he does not present himself as a man of vast 19 Although Plato gives the concept of the professional intellectual its fullest and most aggressive formulation (the philosopher of Gorgias and the Republic is presented as uniquely suited for political leadership—a better statesman, even, than any of those lionized by tradition, as is clear in Gorgias, esp. 515c-517c), Plato's philosopher-king, nonetheless, was far too reclusive, his education too blatantly élitist to be assimilated to Athenian politics without modification. It was Isocrates who effected this modification, broadening the notion of the professional 'philosopher' (Isocrates' term as well as Plato's) in such a manner as to include orators of the better sort. Isocrates' rendition of the political intellectual as orator, though less influential than that of Plato within philosophic circles, has still exercised considerable influence in the west, providing an archetype for the modern journalistic 'pundit'. See Max Weber's discussion of this continuity in 'Politics as a Vocation' (originally a speech delivered in 1918), in From Max Weber: Essays in Sociology, ed. H.H. Gerth and C.W. Mills (New York, 1958), pp. 77-156, esp. p. 96. From these twin fountainheads seem to flow all major intellectual currents of Athenian politics in the fourth century. Most of the orators who shaped the political perspectives of subsequent decades were informed, one way or another, in their conceptions of the political intellectual's calling by the views of Plato and Isocrates. Thus the education of all the fourth-century orators discussed by the pseudo-Plutarch is ascribed to Plato and/or Isocrates, with the exception of Demosthenes and Deinarchus. Even Demosthenes (who as the pupil of Isaeus, student of Isocrates, was the latter's intellectual grandchild) followed the instruction of Plato with the utmost zeal; Pseudo-Plutarch, Lives of the Ten Orators, 844b. 20 Compare Xenophon, Memorabilia. VI. 15; and Plato, Apology, 31c-32a. For the historical sources regarding Socrates, see W.K.C. Guthrie's History of Greek Philosophy, III (Cambridge. 1969), Ch. 12. 21 Some Sophists had been active in politics on occasion. Protagoras, for instance, was chosen to draft a legal code for Thurii; Guthrie, Hist. Greek Phil.. Ill, p. 264. And Gorgias had exhorted the Greeks to unite against the Persians in his Olympic Speech; DK 82A.1 (see note 60 below). But these apparently were isolated episodes. See Plato's general assessment of the Sophists on this issue (cited below, note 74), which seems confirmed by the testimony of the Sophist Prodicus; DK84.B6.</page><page sequence="7">THOUGHT AND POLITICAL ACTION 23 experience in the practical affairs of the city, as had earlier aspirants to leadership. Whereas the ideal statesman of tradition had been primarily a military and political figure by virtue of training and proclivity, and only secondarily of an intellectual bent, the leader delineated by Plato and Isocrates is foremost a man of intellect, permissibly ignorant and even scornful of the practical preoccupations of traditional politicians. Thus Plato opposes his philosopher-king to 'men of action',22 and Isocrates expresses disdain for those branches of oratory (forensic and deliberative) that bear the taint of quotidian politicking.23 This posture of disengagement from practical politics (sufficient of itself to cast serious doubt on the intellectual's grandiose estimate of his political competence, as well as his explanation for his de facto failures) reflects a more profound change in orientation, I will suggest, which would appear to disqualify the intellectual for political leadership, even according to his own standards. He seems no more able to measure up to the requirements of leadership he advances—a disinterested perspective geared to the city as a whole, conjoined with an ethic of public-spiritedness—than are the self serving 'politicians' he despises. Intellect in the fourth century had itself become self-serving as an accompaniment to its professionalization, imposing perspectives upon political affairs that appear no less private in their tendency than were the politicians'. Here too a particular set of involvements is placed before the public concerns of the city—that of a class of professional intel lectuals who, committed primarily to the specialized techniques and objec tives of their craft, measure their worth by standards quite different from those informing Athenian tradition. The crucial transition underlying this new tendency is from the belief— taken for granted by former generations of politically engaged intellectuals— that political thought must be shaped and validated by the aims and values of the public sphere, to the opposite belief that politics must be shaped by the directives of intellect. Thought ceases to take its cues from the public ends of politics, posing instead, as ends for political action, norms that derive from the intellectual's craft. Philosophic convictions, arrived at by a process unrelated to the publicly-sanctioned procedures for reaching decisions, are now exalted above politics to a degree that Solon or Pericles would have found incomprehensible. Thus the intrusion of private preoccupations and commitments into politics, castigated as a destructive symptom of stasis by the intellectuals when manifested elsewhere, acquires for them a transcendent sanctity.

CAMPBELL In the following pages I will sketch the development of this tendency and will discuss some of its consequences—the dilemmas, realignments, and tacit renunciations attending the emergence of the professional political intel lectual. I will suggest that this new vocation was neither a culmination of tradition nor an unqualified triumph for intellect in political affairs. On the contrary, professionalization entailed a retreat of intellect from politics in significant ways, at least when measured against Athenian tradition: a diminished estimate of the validity and self-defining integrity of public interests, and a loss of that sense of unwavering allegiance to the city which had characterized traditional political intellectuals such as Solon and Pericles. Moreover, I will suggest that the intellectual's inability to assume his envisioned role was not merely attributable to his corrupt era, as he claimed. He was rendered incompetent in politics by his very commitments as an intellectual. Having cast his perspective in opposition to the unruly political realm, he could not finally reconcile the two. The symbolic universe that is the object of his contemplation and loyalty remains unapproachably apolitical in its perfection. II Truths political and intellectual: the probative question It is in their assignment of relative importance to the spheres of thought and politics that the fourth-century Athenians set themselves in opposition to their ancestors. The issue here is whether political thought is to be directed, shaped, and validated by the norms of the polis or, conversely, whether thought itself is to be cast in the superordinate role, presiding over these norms as final arbiter. Should the consensual aims and values of the city be accepted as fundamental, setting the point of departure for all speculation about political conduct, or should these commitments be conceived as merely provisional, subject to redirection in accordance with standards discoverable only by intellect? The old order Aristotle, viewing Athenian experience retrospectively and as an outsider, recapitulates the traditional position on this issue, both in distinguishing phronesis from sophia, and in insisting that justice and the other virtues are at once distinctively political and fundamental, the 'givens' of ethical and political thought.24 The assumption underlying the notion of phronesis—that within the human world thought is to be viewed as but an adjunct to action— Aristotle, Ethica Nicomachea (hereafter EN), VI.7; 1.3; X.8(1178b).</page><page sequence="9">THOUGHT AND POLITICAL ACTION 25 had been accepted without question throughout most of the fifth century, for it had been taken for granted that the validity of an idea was to be measured by its efficacy in fostering practical aims. It is not the mere 'planner' but the man of action who deserves the city's respect, Aeschylus' chorus in Agamemnon had reminded its fifth-century audience; "Tis the doer's part likewise to do the planning'.25 Here Aeschylus expresses a bias firmly entrenched within Greek thought, dating back at least to Homer and Hesiod. Homeric Greek does not admit of purely intellectual knowledge. The Homeric verb epistamai refers to a capacity to act rather than a quality of cognition.26 And in Hesiod's Works and Days, which offers only passing tribute to the man of thought ('He who knows the right and is prepared to speak it'27), the appellation 'altogether best', panaristos, is reserved for the possessor of practical intelligence.28 In keeping with this practical bent, Athenian politicians had been expected to evince both a thorough knowledge of the practical arts necessary to the state—fiscal, metallurgical, and agricultural, no less than military and pol itical, according to the Socrates of traditionalist Xenophon29—as well as an attitude of disdain (or at best condescension) toward intellectual dreamers. Even the notoriously imprudent demagogue Cleon affects this attitude in chastening his opponents: 'You seek, one might say, a world quite unlike that in which we live, but give too little heed to that which is at hand.'30 The stereotyped intellectual star-gazer who is foolishly, irresponsibly inept in practical affairs, parodied so boisterously by Aristophanes' Clouds, was a 25 Sophocles also bears witness to this attitude; see his disparagement in Philoctetes of the tendency to view the tongue as 'mightier than deeds of strength', 96-9. 26 See, for instance, Homer, Iliad, II, 611; V, 60; VII, 317; XV, 282; XVIII, 599; XXI, 318; Homer, Odyssey, XI, 368; XII, 307. On the practical bent of early Greek conceptions of knowledge, see Bruno Snell, The Discovery of the Mind, trans. T.G. Rosenmeyer (New York, 1953), pp. 136-53, and John Gould, The Development of Plato's Ethics (Cambridge, 1955), pp. 1-15. 27 Hesiod, Works and Days, 280-1. 28 The panaristos man 'considers all things himself and marks what will be better afterwards'; 293-4. Similarly, Theognis in the sixth century admonishes his lover Cyrnus to confine his thoughts to practical affairs: 'Never give thou thy mind to the impracticable, nor desire things whereof there cometh no accomplishment'; fragments 461-2. 29 Xenophon, Memorabilia, Ill.vi. This expectation persisted even in the late fourth century (Aristotle, Rhetoric, 1.4.7 ff). But see the critique of Phocion, the fourth-century Athenian general, raised against the city's orators for their deficiencies, Plutarch, Phocion, passim, discussed in note 174 below. 10 Thucydides, History of the Peloponnesian War, III.xxxviii.4-5.</page><page sequence="10">26 B.CAMPBELL commonplace of public experience as well as of drama31 during the Periclean age. Pericles had surrounded himself with such types, underscoring by this very juxtaposition the contrast between his own distinctly political intel ligence and theirs. For instance, few Athenians could miss the lesson to be learned from Pericles' paternalist relationship with the greatest of these, Anaxagoras. This avatar of intellect (who bore the epithet 'Nous') was so dependent upon his patron that he languished when Pericles, pressed with public business, was forced to neglect him. Pericles, returning to find his friend helpless in the throes of physical and emotional privation as a result of this neglect, hastened to restore the philosopher to his former condition.32 Here the contrast between the philosophic and the political careers had been presented no less sharply in life, before the public eye, than in Plato's Gorgias and Republic, and here—in opposition to Plato's version—the contrast was drawn unmistakably in favour of politics. Anaxagoras' intellectual career had been measured and found wanting by public standards. No matter how formidable his intellectual prowess in other areas, it had left him pathetically impotent in the practical affairs of civic life. This worldly notion of political intelligence had prevailed within Athens from the time of Solon, who had fashioned of the Greek penchant for practicality a conception of the intellectual's political mandate. Solon had given the authoritative stamp to what was later to be known as phronesis, both by his own example as lawgiver and in his writings. The latter offer a sort of cosmic justification for the intellectual statesman, delineating for him a legitimate sphere in which the forces of deity and destiny can be supplanted, in part at least, by human agency. In Solon's conception action has been identified exclusively with politics. The significant deed—formerly the pre rogative of gods and epic heroes inspired by the higher purposes of divinity— is now assigned to the intellectual statesman, for it has been confined within the context of distinctly human purposes. 31 Socrates alone had been caricatured during his lifetime in a number of comedies by at least four different poets; K.J. Dover, Aristophanic Comedy (Berkeley, 1972), p. 120. 32 Plutarch, Pericles, XVI.5-7. Although this story no doubt exaggerates Anaxagoras' indif ference to political affairs, it appears to be true in essentials. Plato and Aristotle both refer to instances of this indifference. Plato, Hippias Major, 283a; Aristotle, EN, 1141b3, 1179al3; Eudemian Ethics (hereafter EE), 1216all; cited in Guthrie, Hist. Greek Phil., II (Cambridge, 1965), p. 267 note 1. Pericles' own conception of the optimal relationship between thought arid action has been recorded in Thucydides' rendition of his funeral oration. Here Pericles takes it for granted that his conception is shared by his fellow Athenians: 'we have this point also of superiority over other men, to be most daring in action and yet at the same time most given to reflection upon the ventures we mean to undertake; with other men, on the contrary, boldness means ignorance and reflection brings hesitation'; II.xl.3.</page><page sequence="11">THOUGHT AND POLITICAL ACTION 27 It is true, in part, that the practical bent of Solon's thought was necessitated by his ignorance of philosophical trends, as Plutarch has noted.33 Yet Plutarch is wrong in his conclusion that Solon was devoid of philosophic ambition. It is true that Solon was not entirely free of the religious platitudes that formed his intellectual heritage, any more than were his philosophic contemporaries. In a number of the fragments his thought remains bound to religious con vention.34 Yet in their central aim these writings seem theologically emanci pative: Solon seeks no less than to justify the independent validity of practical aims within a theologically defined universe, and this requires that he present the political order as a realm of the humanly possible, a haven from the seemingly arbitrary depredations of destiny and the gods. Although justice retains its 'awesome' religious origin in Solon's frag ments,35 the political authority that gives human meaning to justice is not itself viewed as a gift of Zeus, as among past thinkers such as Hesiod.36 We encounter instead the novel claim that the statesman's activities are not dictated by the gods.37 The significance of this claim, however, is obscured by the attitude of conventional piety from which it seems to issue. At first glance, Solon appears only to be expressing a conservative view (reiterated by Pindar and Plato) when he remonstrates against those who ascribe evil ways to the gods. 'If ye suffer bitterly through your own fault, blame ye not the gods for it,' Solon remarks.38 But the blame for this suffering has been shifted in a manner that departs significantly from convention: not to 'man' as a creature of nature or a metaphysical construct, but rather to homo politicus. It is not 'the destiny of Zeus or the will of the gods immortal' but Athens' own citizens who endanger the city, by their collective greed and folly.3' Thus the numerous facets of human misery are surveyed from a political perspective. That the rewards of Athens' citizenry had been incommensurate with their efforts—an observation which in the conventionally pious fragments had elicited an effusion of Job-like musings regarding God's ultimate intent—is 33 Plutarch, Solon, III.4. 34 See esp. fragments 4, 13, 15-17, 28 in Greek Elegy and Iambus, trans.

CAMPBELL now ascribed to the corrupt institution of debt slavery and other forms of economic, as well as legal, inequality.40 In these political fragments obeisance to conventional belief is markedly absent. Traditional theopolitics has given way to a conception of the state as a human artifact. If Zeus escapes blame for creating Athens' problems he also is denied credit for resolving these. Not the gods but Solon himself had delivered the city from her afflictions, these fragments inform posterity, invoking deity only as passive spectator of Solon's triumph: Right good witness shall 1 have in the court of Time, to wit the Great Mother of the Olympian Gods, dark Earth, whose so many fixed landmarks I once removed, and have made her free that was once a slave. Aye, many brought I back to their God-built birthplace, many that had been sold, some justly, some unjustly, and others that had been exiled through urgent penury, men that no longer spake the Attic speech because they had wandered so far and wide; and those that suffered shameful servitude at home, trembling before the whims of their owners, these made I free men. By fitting close together right and might I made these things prevail, and accomplished them even as I said I would. And ordinances I wrote, that made straight justice for each man, good and bad alike.41 Solon was not entirely free; he had laboured under constraint in the execution of this task, like the epic heroes of mythic antiquity. But for Solon this constraint had been imposed not by divine ordinance but by his mortal constituency, the citizens who had chosen him as archon. He was required to work within that framework of preestablished ends which had defined his mandate, as the above quotation indicates.42 Solon the intellectual (indeed one of the fabled Seven Wisemen) thus would appear to have stipulated, by his very acceptance of this mandate, that in mortal affairs intellect is to be 40 See Solon's account of the suffering created by these institutions in frgs. 36, 37, and in the passages quoted in Aristotle's Constitution of Athens, xii.4.

As political architect he is given carte blanche in all other respects—judging at least from Solon's apparent sense of freedom in setting up his constitution. For instance, in explaining his decision to retain the Areopagus as guardian of the laws while giving the popular courts new functions, he betrays no trace of suspicion that he is under any of the constraints to which one might expect such a lawgiver to be prey—either of religion, destiny, and nature, or of history. Solon had effected this political division of labour simply because he was convinced that 'anchored to two councils the city would the better ride out a storm and keep her people in the greater quiet'.44 The intellectual statesman's task does not end with the construction of political institutions. He is not merely an architect but an engaged leader as well, and here too he is limited only by his mandate. Legislation of itself is insufficient; laws must be supplemented by the intelligent leader who can channel the multitude into the desired direction45 and, at the same time, is possessed of 'sound judgment' (gnomosyne) which 'alone hath the ends of all things'.46 Although this quality of judgment is given an esoteric cast at times (its 'unseen measure is difficult to discern'), it is not grounded in the verbal arcana of oracular or shamanistic tradition, which, though addressing a reality removed from the sphere of action, was susceptible of political manipu lation.47 On this score Solon is unwavering: speech is but 'the mirror of action';48 one of the reasons for Athens' suffering has been her vulnerability 41 Plutarch emphasizes that Solon—unlike Lycurgus, who could impose his policies by force— was required to rely 'on the wishes of the citizens and their confidence in him'; Solon, XVI. 1-2. 44 Solon, frg. 37a.

CAMPBELL to masters of verbal legerdemain.49 Gnomosyne, in contrast, appears to be informed by the experience drawn from a lifetime's commitment to political affairs;50 its function is to translate the city's aims into action, harnessing right and might or 'word and sword'.51 But this anthropocentric conception of politics does not deprive Athens' nomoi of ethical significance. If the city is not grounded in the higher purposes of divinity, neither does she rest upon mere expediency. Again Solon has anticipated Aristotle, presenting the state as a distinctively human sphere of ethical values. Like conventional religious thinkers before him (such as Hesiod, whose Works and Days had underscored the distance separating the righteousness of Zeus from the knavery of politicians),52 Solon draws a contrast between divine and political justice. Yet here as elsewhere Solon has shifted the onus implicit in this contrast between man and god. Political justice appears to acquire heightened ethical import by reason of its very dissimilarity to divine justice. Minimally, political justice can mollify some of the fundamental inequities of mortal existence that seem to accompany the trans-generational procession of divine justice. Although the religious fragments counsel belief in the gods' ultimate justice (should an evil doer escape divine punishment in his own lifetime, his liability undoubtedly will be transmitted to his progeny53), it is apparent, nonetheless, that in Solon's estimate this belief must rest upon blind faith, for divine justice is by no means evident to man.54 The evidence would suggest rather that deity betrays a callous disregard for justice in mortal affairs. Human happiness and misery are allocated irrespective of merit; virtue is often attended by suffering, while vice is rewarded. Who can fail to observe that 'sometimes he that striveth to do a thing falleth unawares into ruin great and sore, whereas God giveth good hap in all things to one that 49 'Ye look to a man's tongue and shifty speech, but never to the deed he doeth'; Solon, frg. 19. 50 'As I grow old I learn many things', Solon observes; ibid., frg. 18. 51 Diog.

Insofar as it aims at correcting these anomalies of divine justice, it possesses a validity immedi ately apparent to all. Here the wicked are restrained, rather than rewarded; good rule 'putteth fetters upon the righteous . . . checketh excess [and] confuseth outrage'.56 It is not this rectificatory function, however, that confers greatest value upon politics. The fragments also afford a rudimentary glimpse of the state as paideia, a formative medium that has begun to supplant all the older loci of value, acquiring an intellectual, psychic force already coequal, perhaps, with that of the gods and even of physis. Thus political power is described by means of dramatic meteorological analogies such as those Homer had reserved for Zeus: 'The strength of snow and hail is from a cloud, and thunder cometh of the bright lightning; a city is destroyed of great men, and the common folk fall into bondage unto a despot because of ignorance'.57 Elsewhere religion is reduced to a status merely equipotent with legislation, and both are to be measured by the political standard of public welfare.58 But most revealing is Solon's sketch of the state as a characterological mould, providing man with a second nature that would in time supersede the physis which had linked Athens' governing aristocracy with divinity. The state, as depicted in this sketch, 'straighteneth crooked judgments, she mollifieth proud deeds ... and of her all is made wise and perfect in the world of man'.59 Such, then, was the practical wisdom that had informed Athenian political tradition. Of course Solon's successors had been familiar with the alternative conception of wisdom (Aristotle's 'sophia'), as propounded by Ionian and Eleatic philosophers such as Pericles' friend, Anaxagoras. This naturalist philosophy had posed a sharp contrast to the practical wisdom of Athenian tradition, for scientific wisdom acknowledged no public, found no mandate in the consensus mundi. In the estimate of natural philosophers, nature's truths elude the facile apprehension required of public knowledge: nature is fond of hiding herself; although man can gain knowledge of her truths—a knowledge 55 Ibid., frgs. 13.15. 56 Ibid., frg. 4. 57 Ibid., frgs. 9, 10.

This is most apparent in Xenophanes' parodies of anthropomorphism in Greek religion. Xenophanes (the founder of Eleatic philosophy, according to the doxographers) ridicules those who ascribe human characteristics to divinity, adding that animals too, no doubt, would depict the gods in their own likenesses 'if cattle, horses or lions had hands and could use these to draw'.61 But more significant was the widespread tendency to question the validity of all sensory data. Here the assumption is that truth cannot be situated within the world of ordinary apprehension, which is to say (inter alia) the public realm. To seek this truth one must disregard those perceptors that provide our information regarding the world about us.62 The eyes and ears are unreliable witnesses to reality, 60 Heracleitus, DK 22B123; Xenophanes, DK 21B18. Compare Democritus, DK 68B117.

Rosamon Kent Sprague's The Older Sophists (Columbia. 1972) is a straightforward translation of the relevant sections of Diels. except for Antiphon; here the fragments are reconstituted to accord with the translator's belief that the two Antiphons (orator and Sophist) are one. Thus apart from those of Antiphon. all Sophist citations are from Sprague. 61 DK21B11,14-16. 62 J.E. Raven's comment on Parmenides is equally applicable, mutatis mutandis, to the majority of preSocratics: 'Starting from the premise εστι, "it is,"—in much the same way as Descartes started from the premise "cogito"—Parmenides proceeds, by the sole use of reason unaided by the senses, to deduce all that can be known about Being, and he ends by denying any truthful validity to the senses or any reality to what they appear to perceive'; G.S.

Kerferd, The Sophistic Movement (London, 1981), pp. 94-9. According to Kerferd, this new approach 'amounts to a massive shift of emphasis, away from the view that much of Greek philosophy was concerned primarily with problems of existence, and towards the view that it was rather in such cases concerned with what we could call problems of predication, but which they tended rather more to regard as problems of the inherence of qualities and characteristics in objects in the real world around us', p. 95.

Yet while this scientific trend of thought had freed itself from the parochial beliefs and biases that had been imposed by public opinion upon political thought, philosophic reality was not entirely unbounded by mortal apriority. Natural philosophy had a mandate of its own. Aristotle notes that the objects of scientific inquiry were to be measured against the standards of necessity, timelessness, and immutability,66 and the Greek scientists had indeed assumed from the very beginning that final reality must conform to these intellectual norms, among others.67 Nature's order is not then the funda mental datum, the 'given' of inquiry, insofar as it must be shaped to accord with intellectual standards. 'To think is the same as to be', Parmenides had insisted,68 and this demand recurs throughout the pre-Socratic fragments in various forms. For instance, it is stipulated that reality measure up to the intellectual criteria of uniformity69 and universality,70 in addition to those Aristotle attributes to sophia. This requirement that the truths of the universe accommodate themselves to intellect is not extended by the physicists into political affairs, however. On the contrary, their tendency is to view the city's nomoi as inviolable, even sacred. It would even appear that Pericles' friend, Anaxagoras, was merely following the counsel of natural philosophy in accepting his political passivity. 'Good conduct consists in obedience to political authority, to the law, and to the man of superior wisdom', Democritus remarks,71 and Heracleitus coun " DK 22B56, 107. 64 DK 28B7-8. 65 DK59B21. 66 Aristotle, £7V VI.3.1139b.

Many were themselves politically engaged aristocrats, such as Zeno and Parmenides, who apparently were active in the government of Elea,73 or Thaïes and Hecataeus, who had been immersed in Ionian politics.74 Still the fact remains that their intellectual animus was not allowed to obtrude upon the city's nomoi.

Whereas Protagoras79 appears to have confirmed the validity of Athenian 'phronesis' in his great monologue on justice,80 Antiphon and his colleagues repudiated Solonian precedent by extending into politics the 'sophia' of Greek physics. For these latter Sophists, at least, politics must be validated by the intellectual norms that have directed cosmological inquiry. Thus for Antiphon political laws are an alien imposition upon the human physis and, consequently, are of an inferior order of reality and value precisely because they lack the properties of necessity and universality characteristic of physis. Nature's stipulations are binding by compulsion, whereas those of political law are merely contrived.81 Moreover, nature's dictates are omnipresent; they apply to all humanity, in contrast to political law: 'we are all by nature alike in all respects, barbarian no less than Hellene'.82 Others who share Antiphon's penchant for extending 'sophia' into politics further claim immutability for the laws of nature,83 as well as a uniformity that cuts across the various animal species, even annulling the differences separating god and man. Plato's Callicles, for example, offers by way of evidence for his thesis that it is a law of nature 'for the better to have advantage of the worse, and the abler of the feebler' the observation that this is characteristic of the animal as well as the human world,84 and in his Encomium of Helen Gorgias remarks of his version of this same law of nature that it also applies in relations between god and man.85 Few of the Sophists appear so unequivocal as Antiphon in attempting to impose the standards of natural philosophy on political conduct. Some even go so far, on occasion, as to deny explicitly the applicability of these standards to human affairs. This, apparently is the crux of Gorgias' argument in On the Nonexistent or On Nature, in which it is asserted, against Parmenides' conception of the Existent (esti): 'first and foremost, that nothing exists; second, that even if it exists it is inapprehensible to man; third, that even if it is 7β At least the Protagoran persona that is the eponymous subject of Plato's dialogue; but see below. 80 Protag., 320c-328d. 81 DK, 87B44A1. 82 DK. 87B44B2. 83 See the Anonymus lamblichi's comment on Law and Justice, DK, 89B6.2. 84 Gorg., 483d. 85 DK, 82B11.6. Gorgias appears inconsistent in his views on nature, however. See below, next paragraph.</page><page sequence="20">36 Β. CAMPBELL apprehensible, still it is without a doubt incapable of being expressed or explained to the next man'.86 And Protagoras' assertion of man as the measure of all things87 would seem to yield the same conclusion, at least if Plato and Aristotle are correct in interpreting this as solipsism,88 for this standard implies that universal standards cannot be imposed upon humanity. Yet most of these thinkers remain oriented, if only negatively, by the standards of 'sophia' in their ethical and political views. The majority of those whose views have been preserved seem to have believed that intellectual norms ought in some sense to preside over the state, that politics otherwise is unintelligible. Throughout these fragments it is apparent that their authors expect to occasion great surprise or outright dismay by their demonstrations that politics does not conform to the exalted norms the natural philosophers had imposed upon nature; in the Sophists' own view this conclusion seemingly amounts to a direct assault on the validity of the political order (never prima facie for any of the Sophists). If, for instance, final reality is inapprehensible and incommunicable to man, as Gorgias claimed, it would seem to follow without doubt, in his estimate, that the city's nomoi are reduced to intellectual (and hence ethical) nullity. It apparently did not occur to Gorgias to reflect that public purposes and values might well be of a different order from the objects of natural philosophy, and that the two, therefore, are incom mensurable. Because the web of belief that sustains the city is mere 'seeming' (to dokein), it is 'unreliable'; it does not 'involve existence'.89 Even Protagoras appears to have reached this conclusion, for his exaltation of the individual as final measure extends beyond intellectual norms in its nugatory effect. His 'standard' would appear to deny any standards to politics,90 including those that had provided the statesman of Solonian tradition with his mandate. This Protagoras (in contrast to Plato's mythopoetic apologist) has impugned political justice in two respects, epistemological and ethical. If the individual is final measure, justice is reduced to the level of matters of taste: if in political affairs 'all appearances and opinions are true 86 DK, 82B3.

Greek Phil., Ill, pp. 170-1, 186-7,267-8. 89 DK, 82B26. 90 See Sextus' comment here, DK, 80B1.</page><page sequence="21">THOUGHT AND POLITICAL ACTION 37 and . . . truth is a relative matter because a man's every perception or opinion immediately exists in relation to him',91 there can be no common knowledge, no public dimension of rational consciousness. Furthermore, justice is nulli fied as an ethical value, for Protagoras' solipsism assigns equal validity to opposing statements not only in matters of fact but also in ethical judgments, at least in Aristotle's construction: 'the same thing turns out both to be and not to be, and to be bad as well as good'.92 Thus the legitimacy of the nomoi would seem to have been assaulted no less by Protagoras' subjective anthro pocentrism than by Gorgias' denial of esti. No matter how conservative Protagoras may have been in personal proclivity, he differed little (at least according to this tendency of his thought), in his implication for Athenian tradition, from Antiphon and the other unabashed apologists for physis. What distinguishes all these thinkers from Solon, reducing to triviality the affinities of interest stressed by Plutarch, is the essentially nonpolitical character of the Sophists' profession—nonpolitical at least from the per spective of Athenian tradition.93 As an intellectual minstrel wandering from city to city, the Sophist lacked the insider's intimate familiarity with the nomoi of his host cities—with those idiosyncratic biases, habits, and other unspoken concurrences of feeling and belief that had set the framework of ends for the 91 DK.80B2. 92 Metaphysics, XI.6,1062bl3. 91 But we must remember that Athens provided the centre for the Sophistic movement through out the last half of the fifth century. According to Kerferd, this movement might never have come into existence without Athens; Kerferd, Sophistic Movement, p. 15. There is a sense in which the Sophists would appear to be political, and in ways that even seem appropriate to Athenian democracy, as Eric Havelock has emphasized in his Liberal Temper in Greek Politics (New Haven, 1957), Ch. 9. Democracy, as an affirmation of 'the validity of common human opinion in all matters pertaining to political action' (p. 241 ), requires orators as opinion brokers in order to function. But this of itself is insufficient, at least in the estimate of many Athenian democrats who tended to view these Sophists with a mixture of amusement, suspicion, and contempt—judging, at least, from the testimony of Aristophanes, and that of Anytos et al. as reported by Plato and Xenophon. As Aristophanes suggests throughout his Clouds, a scheme of knowledge uncon nected with a political tradition is not merely 'value free' (not merely capable of 'making the lesser cause seem the better'). Rather the problem with sophistic knowledge, as depicted in Clouds, is that it is grounded in values at odds with those of any historical polity, since it negates the traditional framework of beliefs and values underlying those tokens of mutual commitment and obligation required of any political community, such as oaths and contracts. The Unjust Logic in Clouds teaches its students not merely to escape their financial obligations but to repudiate their loyalty to the political order as well. 'How sweet it is, these novel arts,' Pheidippides observes after beating his father, 'these clever words to know / And have the power established rules and laws to overthrow', 1399 ff.

On his own admission, he was neither statesman nor philosopher, but was rather poised on the borderline between the two.94 It is not simply a question, then, of distinguishing between those Sophists who attacked and those who defended the cause of nomos, as often assumed. Advocate and opponent alike were guided by concepts, priorities, and canons of validity that had nothing to do with those stipulated by Solon. Solon's attempt to disengage an autonomous sphere for state and citizen from theology and metaphysics could not be rigorously defended (or even, per haps, understood) by Sophistic apologists of nomos because this attempt presupposed an acute appreciation of the influence of political forces—a belief in their causal and ethical primacy—which could never be instilled by a curriculum that envisages intellect as no more than a brokerage in abstrac tions.95 Although the Sophists claimed political relevance for their training, this was a relevance that denied to politics the very primacy which Solon had sought to vindicate, for their conception of intellectual virtuosity is no less reductionist in political orientation than was the theocentrism that had confronted Solon. There can be no such creature as Solon's political man from the perspective imposed by the Sophist's techne. 'Man' is either a meta physical construct—an epiphany of 'physis', as with Antiphon—or a con geries of 'sensation', as with Protagoras;96 in either case he is actuated by abstract interests to which are reducible the public aims that had defined Solon's mandate. The Sophistic movement did not issue in a sweeping rejection of the political status quo, as one might expect. Indeed, even the most iconoclastic of these thinkers would appear to have been surprisingly conservative ('Nothing is worse for mankind than anarchy', observes Antiphon97), at least in comparison with Solon before them, or Plato in the following century. Despite their tendency to posture as critics of the nomoi, they were profes 94 Prodicus, DK, 84Bb6. 95 Plato was well aware of the significance of this departure. In Timaeus he remarks: 'As to the class of Sophists, although I esteem them highly versed in many fine discourses of other kinds, yet I fear lest haply, seeing that they are a class which roams from city to city and has no settled habitations of its own, they may go wide of the mark in regard to men who are at once philosophers and statesmen, and what they would be likely to do and say, in their several dealings with foemen in war and battle, both by word and deed.' (19e) For a summary of the sophistic curriculum, as well as of the teaching methods of the Sophists, see Kerferd, Sophistic Movement, Ch. 4, esp. pp. 30 ff. 96 Theaetetus; 152 ff. 97 DK.87B61.</page><page sequence="23">THOUGHT AND POLITICAL ACTION 39 sionally dependent upon the established order of their host city, inasmuch as their aim, apparently, was to teach their pupils how to manipulate this order. Still there is a radical implication to the Sophists' political views, quite apart from their intent, at least for a political tradition founded upon Solonian iphronesis\ With the Sophists we encounter for the first time a thorough repudiation of the answers Athenian tradition had given to the probative questions posed at the outset of this section. Public values have come to be perceived as contingent upon the intellectual's perspective to a degree hitherto unthinkable; now it rests with him to validate or reshape these. Intellectual norms, formed privately in response to aims having little to do with politics, have superseded those embodied in the nomoi. Correlatively, the consensus mundi forfeits to the intellectual the prerogative of final arbiter. He is to judge political affairs by such standards as 'interest', 'benefit', or 'advantage' (sympheron, ôphelimon, chrësimon),98 which are not discernible to the public, unskilled as it is in the intellectual's craft. Even Protagoras ends up by granting the intellectual the last word in matters of justice. Although it is true that what appears just to a city is in fact just for it, the function of the wise man is to work a change in the populace so that its perceptions coincide with what is truly beneficial for it: 'the wise man makes what is beneficial rather than what is harmful for them in any particular case appear and be just'.99 Ill The fourth-century legacy What is remarkable about the fourth-century intellectuals, in view of their avowals of continuity with Athenian tradition, is their tacit acceptance of the probative reversal that repudiates this tradition. For these thinkers, no less than for the Sophists, intellect adduces new canons of validity, norms, and loyalties antithetical to those stipulated by Athens' historic leaders. Indeed the new generation of intellectuals draws more extreme conclusions from the Sophistic position than had the Sophists themselves: politics is not merely to be evaluated but also directed and even transformed, if possible, in accor dance with standards deriving from the intellectual's craft. '8 See Guthrie's discussion of these standards, Hist. Greek Phil., Ill, pp. 164-75.

CAMPBELL The new standards for political knowledge and conduct For Plato and Isocrates intellect is not merely a guide to action; 'philo sophy' has rather supplanted action as man's epic medium. Both render homage at times to the practical conception of statesmanship that Solon had stressed,100 but their most consistent attitude toward this orientation is one of disdain. Men of action are more akin to base 'lovers of spectacles' than to intellectuals in Plato's estimate; accordingly, he excludes the practically oriented disciplines from the educational curriculum of philosophy candi dates.101 Isocrates, in turn, contrasts his own culture, 'which contemns the petty things and attempts to achieve the great things', with the orientation imparted by active participation in public affairs.102 Although the political intellectual is still depicted as a public agent, he no longer acts on behalf of the established values of public life. Indeed from the perspective of Athenian tradition, he cannot lay claim to any recognizable form of political accomplishment, for his political curriculum vitae is non existent or at best inconsequential, at least if his education has gone according to plan. His intellect has not been shaped by political involvements. Like its Sophistic predecessor, fourth-century 'philosophy' is acquired in private, in the cloistered school or under the individual tutelage of a master, rather than in the political arena. Thus Plato—whose Academy, like Isocrates' school, epitomized this departure from Solonian tradition—stresses that political involvement within any city that is not itself a creation of philosophy is destructive of the philosophic genius; only those youthful talents have been spared who have pursued their education privately in isolation from political life.103 Similarly, Isocrates claims to have guided himself by this aim of isolation even in his own education, choosing at the outset of his career to remain 'aloof from participation in public affairs',104 and subsequent intel lectuals at times carried this preoccupation with privacy to absurd lengths in their educational regimens. For instance Demosthenes (who was tutored privately at home) perfected an elaborate repertoire of techniques for iso 100 See, for instance, Plato's discussion of euboulia, Repub., 428bd, and Isocrates' Antidosis, 266, 277; Panathenaicus, 30. 101 Repub., 476ab, 525de, 526ab, 527ab, 529ab. I have discussed this point in greater detail in 'Intellect and the Political Order in Plato's Republic 102 Isocrates, Letter to Dionysius the Elder, 9. 103 Repub., 496ac. 104 Isocrates, Letter to Dionysius the Elder, 9.</page><page sequence="25">THOUGHT AND POLITICAL ACTION 41 lating himself in order to learn his craft before immersing himself in practical politics, including that of shaving one side of his head.105 The new generation of thinkers has retained Solon's conception of the political intellectual as epic hero'06 uniquely capable of significant accom plishment within the mortal sphere, but this hero's work is no longer to be appraised within a framework of ends stipulated by a political constituency. Indeed there appear to be no extraneous criteria for intellectual accomplish ment; 'philosophy' seems rather an autonomous force that would impose its own standards upon the world of man. This is most obvious, of course, in Plato's conception of the philosophic practitioner as metaphysical artist. Fixing his gaze 'upon the things of the eternal and unchanging order, and seeing that they neither wrong nor are wronged by one another, but all abide in harmony as reason bids', Plato's artist seeks merely to give mortal embodi ment to his metaphysical vision: after wiping clean the political canvas ('the city and the characters of men') he would stamp his transcendental patterns upon the plastic stuff of human nature, 'in public and in private'.107 The norms guiding this metaphysical artist hark back directly to those of Greek science; as the account cited above indicates, his patterns are identified by the criteria of universality, timelessness, and uniformity no less than were the meta physical constructs of Ionian and Eleatic thought. Plato's artist differs from these prototypes only in the scope of his artistry: unlike these, he would stamp his patterns upon the public order. Isocrates, who does not share Plato's metaphysical temperament, is no less unequivocal in portraying intellect as a norm-imposing force: it has enabled men to escape the life of wild beasts by establishing laws and other insti tutions, thereby positing standards which enable them to draw such distinc tions as just and unjust, honourable and base, good and evil.108 Consequently Isocrates' 'philosophy' is not to be appraised by merely political standards, its own creation. Like Plato's philosophy, it must be judged by standards proper 105 Pseudo-Plutarch, Lives of the Ten Orators, viii, 844cd; Plutarch, Parallel Lives, Demosthenes, vii.3. Compare the account of Lycurgus' education in Lives of the Ten Orators, vii, esp. 842c. 106 Sheldon Wolin has made a similar point in regard to Plato; see his Hobbes and the Epic Tradition of Political Theory (Los Angeles, 1970), pp. 4-14. 107 Repub., 500c-501b. This passage is criticized throughout Karl Popper's Open Society and its Enemies (New York, 5th edn., 1963) as illustrative of an aesthetic orientation to politics that reflects 'the uncompromising attitude of all forms of out-and-out radicalism'; p. 166.

CAMPBELL to the intellectual's art, such as originality or novelty, comprehensiveness of perspective, loftiness and nobility.109 Although these criteria are unabashedly self-serving (they are precisely those attributes that reflect Isocrates and his school in the best light, in his estimate), they derive, albeit less directly, from the same source as do Plato's, the norms of sophia. Like the Sophists béfore him, Isocrates pays left-handed tribute to the standards of Greek science in his claim that 'discourse' or 'philosophy' gains in validity as it becomes more comprehensive and universal, increasingly abstract and remote from the parochial concerns of the city-state.110 To gauge the distance separating this fourth-century conception of political 'artistry' from its traditional counterpart, we need only contrast the views of Plato and Isocrates concerning the intellectual's relationship to the state with those of their common mentor,11 ' Socrates, as he is presented in Plato's early dialogues (presumably an accurate account of Socrates' beliefs)."2 That Socrates was himself a transitional figure makes the contrast all the more illuminating, for though it is true that he carried the Solonian conception of the political intellectual to its furthermost limits, he did nonetheless remain within these limits, providing posterity with what is perhaps the most widely renowned exemplification of Athenian tradition in this respect. "" Isocrates invokes the standard of originality in Against the Sophists, 12-13, and Antidosis, 82-3 ; comprehensiveness ('men of wisdom give preference to the broader and worthier cause') is discussed also in Antidosis (38,40,80,84), as are the standards of loftiness and nobility (76-7). In addition to these, Isocrates occasionally resorts to such standards as beauty, aesthetic pleasur ableness, and artistic excellence; see for instance Panegyricus, 47-50, Antidosis, 47. 110 Moreover, Isocrates' emphasis on novelty and originality appears, in context, to be an attempt to recapture the experience of breaking beyond the boundaries of convention and tradition that had inspired the naturalists. Isocrates' remark that authors of original discourses should be held in higher esteem than lawgivers (Antidosis, 80-2) seems recognizable as a faint echo of Democritus' claim in the previous century, that he would 'rather discover one cause than acquire the kingdom of the Persians') DK, 68B118. 111 On Isocrates' relationship with Socrates, see Plato's Phaedrus, 278e-279b; the pseudo Plutarch's Lives of the Ten Orators, 838 ff; and George Norlin's introduction to the Loeb Classics edition of Isocrates' extant speeches, Vol. I, xvi ff. 112 David Daube, for instance, accepts the Crito (for present purposes the most important of these) as an accurate record of Socrates' position in Civil Disobedience in Antiquity (Edinburgh, 1972), pp. 72-8, as does A.D. Woozley, Law and Obedience: The Arguments of Plato's Crito (Chapel Hill, 1979); see esp. pp. 2-5. Although C.H. Kahn has challenged this conventional view of the early dialogues in his 'Did Plato Write Socratic Dialogues?', Classical Quarterly, 31 (1981), pp. 305-21, his argument does not affect the issues raised in this essay regarding the Crito or the Gorgias. Kahn concedes that the Crito accurately reflects Socrates' basic position, denying only that its theory of tacit consent or contract was Socratic.</page><page sequence="27">THOUGHT AND POLITICAL ACTION 43 Socrates anticipates fourth-century developments in important ways. We encounter in the early dialogues the tendency, characteristic both of the Sophists and the fourth-century intellectuals, to refer political issues to the intellectual expert or the man who has episteme, the one who knows the real truth."3 And Socrates does appear to impose intellectual norms such as logical consistency and rational conviction upon political matters; he has always been, he avows, 'a man who follows nothing but the reasoning which on consideration seems . .. best'.114 Indeed it is true that there is a universalist implication to his thought which, logically at least, could not be confined to the narrow boundaries of the city-state, as Ernest Barker has noted."5 Yet Socrates remains true to tradition in the essential belief that political inquiry must be directed and tested by the consensual values embodied in the city's nomoi. Although it had been necessary for him to dispute legal matters with his prosecutors in the Apology,116 his dispute did not extend beyond the issues of the meaning of the law and the qualifications of its self-appointed inter preters. He did not reject these nomoi on behalf of 'higher' or more properly intellectual norms. This fidelity to the probative commitments of Athenian tradition is abun dantly demonstrated in the Crito, where Socrates casts himself in the role of his own interlocutor as spokesman for the city's Laws. These Laws—which are to provide the last word on the question of Socrates' political obligations —confront the intellectual with a higher authority than his reason. They do not 'argue' with Socrates, for they do not accept the intellectual values he has stipulated as common ground for argument."7 The Nomoi appear not as a See, for example, Plato, Apology, 24d, 25b; Crito, 47b, 48a. Xenophon's portrait of Socrates in Memorabilia also describes this tendency; I.ii.9, III.vi. 114 Crito, 46b. 115 Ernest Barker, Political Thought of Plato and Aristotle (New York, 1906), p. 53. But this implication could be drawn only in retrospect, only after his fourth-century successors had given enduring respectability to the sophistic penchant for bringing the norm of universality to bear upon political thought. Socrates himself indicates that his interests are confined within the city; see Crito, 52bc. His divinely-appointed mission is defined exclusively in relation to Athens (Apology, 30e-31b, 36c), and as his intellectual biography sketched in Phaedo makes clear, the mature Socrates is no more metaphysical in proclivity than had been Solon; Socrates had early 'given up investigating realities' (99d). As E.R. Dodds has observed, 'It was probably Plato who first discovered in his master's teaching the foundation of a new political ideal, but one which could never be realized in Athens'; Plato, Gorgias: A Revised Text with Introduction and Commentary (Oxford, 1959), p. 369. 116 He also refers to previous collisions with political power.

CAMPBELL scheme of ideas to be examined in conformity with Socrates' initial proposal, but rather as a moral and psychic environment, a formative medium that engulfs the questioner, demanding priority over intellect. One can no more impose the canons of logic upon them than upon the womb or the family."8 They are not to be measured by these, or for that matter, any extraneous standards because they are themselves the measure of reality and worth within the city: it is the Laws, with their commands and prohibitions, that stipulate what is most exigent, most real in Athenian experience, just as the city's welfare defines a sphere of value that must predominate over all others.119 Consequently, the state's well-being provides the final appeal of the Laws in their admonition. Merely to point up the political consequences of Crito's proposal is itself a refutation: 'Tell me Socrates, what have you in mind to do? Are you not intending by this thing you are trying to do, to destroy us, the Laws, and the entire State, so far as in you lies? '120 The upshot of Socrates' dialogical soliloquy in Crito. then, is to recapitulate the conservative con clusion of the Greek scientists: intellectual norms must not obtrude upon the city's nomoi.{2&gt; "8 Ibid., 51ac. "® The Laws reinforce their position on this issue by reaffirming the Solonian conception of intellect as subordinate to action. It is not to Socrates' logical faculty that the Laws address themselves, but to the actions and acquiescences that have defined his public engagements and. therefore, his very existence as a moral being. Thus the Laws carefully formulate their leading conceptions in the language of public action. Justice, for instance, is presented not as an intellectual 'virtue' but as a political function. To 'understand' it is to learn how it is administered within the city; its meaning is to be discovered by reference to its institutional context (Crito, 51de). Even the Socratic norms of logical consistency and rational conviction are translated into the vocabulary of political activity. Socrates' preliminary concern to adhere to the same argu ments that he 'used to advance' (46b) is subtly replaced by a concern for fidelity to his public commitments, so that logical consistency becomes consistency of action, an integrity not of argument but rather of political biography (52bd). By the same token, rational assent blurs into the political norm of consent ; a man ought 'to do what he has agreed to do' (49e). This consent, in turn, is defined by Socrates' public involvements rather than by his arguments: 'you agreed, not in word, but by your acts, to live in accordance with us' (52d). Here again Xenophon concurs with Plato. According to the Memorabilia, Socrates proclaimed his notion of justice by his deeds, which 'are better evidence than words' ; he rendered 'scrupulous obedience in all that the laws required'. IV.iv.l, 10. 120 Cnto, 50ab. 121 Similarly, according to Xenophon, Socrates conceived political knowledge exclusively from the traditional perspective, i.e. as a form of phronesis, grounded in public values and needs. See. for instance, his account of Socrates' exchange with Glaucon regarding the requirements of political leadership. Memorabilia, IILvi.</page><page sequence="29">THOUGHT AND POLITICAL ACTION 45 Although Plato and his contemporaries pay lip-service to the patriotic attitude reflected in this position, they do not share Socrates' categorical commitment to the city's nomoi, for their political concerns have taken a new direction. The fourth-century conception of political authority represents more than a methodological reorientation or a mere recasting of the city's political problems in a perspective more appropriate to the intellectual's new professional status. There also occurs a fundamental change in the focus of political analysis that would appear to have the effect of displacing Athens almost completely as an object of professional interest, positing an alternative political model shaped by intellectual norms. It is not Athens' political problems (at least as these are defined by her citizen body) that dominate the professional intellectual's attention. His philosophy stipulates a hypothetical 'higher' polity as alone worthy of intellectual concern, a 'city whose home is in the ideal'—as Plato characterized it—no less distantly removed from the sphere of public experience than were the constructs of Greek science. This city suffuses the political thought of Isocrates no less than that of Plato, albeit in different form. In describing his transcendent Callipolis in the Republic Plato again speaks, mutatis mutandis, for his fellow intellectuals: 'there is a pattern of it laid up in heaven for him who wishes to contemplate it and so beholding to constitute himself its citizen. But it makes no difference whether it exists now or ever will come into being. The politics of this city only will be his and of none other'.122 With Isocrates and subsequent orators this ideal is projected historically, rather than metaphysically. It is Athens' ancestral constitution that holds out the pattern for the ideal state.123 Isocrates, for instance, avows that the entire world must acknowledge the superiority of the ancestral city, admitting it 'to be not only the most impartial and the most just, but also the most profitable to all and the most agreeable to those who lived under it'.124 Yet despite its historical trappings, the political ideal presented by the orators appears, at times, to have no more connection with the contemporary city than does 122 Repub., 592ab. The past must serve as our exemplar in planning our future, Isocrates remarks (To Demonicus, 34); similarly Demosthenes observes that the conduct of a state must be guided by its most honourable traditions (On the Crown, 95-6). See Finley's discussion of the orators' position on this score in Use and Abuse of History, Ch. 2. Plato himself is not immune to the temptation of offering historic projections of his higher city. In Timaeus (20c-25d) he suggests that archaic Athens (nine thousand years before Solon) had been, in effect, an epiphany of the Republic's Callipolis. 124 Isocrates, Panathenaicus, 130-3. Isocrates discusses this ideal constitution in Areopagiticus and On the Peace, as well as Panathenaicus. In addition, see Demosthenes' On the Crown, 203 ff. Against Leprines, 91 ; and Aeschines, Against Ctesiphon, 178 ff.</page><page sequence="30">46 B.CAMPBELL Plato's Callipolis. This ideal polity is manifest only symbolically in the vestiges of Athens' great past—her tombs, shrines, speeches, and spectacles—yet it is a presence that continually overshadows the city.125 Only occasionally do the orators attempt to integrate their dual images of Athens by stressing the element of historical continuity.126 More often, the two cities are sharply opposed. In Isocrates' account the ancestral polity 'was much better and stronger than that which obtained later as Aristeides and Themistocles and Miltiades were better men than Hyperbolus and Cleophon and those who today harangue the people'.127 And Aeschines takes it for granted that all thinking men share Isocrates' view: 'If any one should ask you whether our city seems to you more glorious in our own time or in the time of our fathers, you would all agree, in the time of our fathers. And were there better men than now? Then, eminent men; but now, far inferior'.128 The orators are guided, then, by the same aim as Plato in this dimension of their political speculation: mimesis of an ideal that has been transferred to the plane of sophia. The ancestral constitution, now removed from the clamorous ephemerae of politics, tends to function as a transcendent model that, like Plato's, is timeless and universal in its appeal, and possessed of a unity of purpose that is utterly incompatible with the self-regarding motives of con temporary citizens. The Athens lauded in Isocrates' Areopagiticus, for example, is no historic product, insofar as it is immune to that continuous 135 Thus Hyperides exhorts his fellow-citizens: 'Remember the tombs of your ancestors and punish the offenders in the interests of the whole city'; Against Demosthenes, frg. ix. This is a common appeal among the orators. On its significance within classical Athens, see S.C. Humphreys. 'Family Tombs and Tomb Cult in Ancient Athens: Tradition or Traditionalism?', Journal of Hellenic Studies, 100 (1980), pp. 96-123. Also see Demosthenes' discussion of the ennobling effects of Athens' historic speeches and spectacles, 'memorials of the high prowess of your ancestors'. On the Crown, 68-9; and Aeschines' references to the inscriptions on the Hermai as testimony to ancestral grandeur. Against Ctesiphon, 183 ff. 126 I have discussed one such attempt in 'Poliatrics: Physicians and the Physician Analogy within Fourth-century Athens', American Political Science Review, 76 (1982), pp. 810-24, Here, 1 suggest, the orators follow the example of medicine, describing Athens' historic constitution as a lkatastasis', a living, reactive 'body politic', subject to historical forces and capable of initiating adaptive changes. The latter conceptiont needless to say, is inconsistent with the position discussed in the present article. This inconsistency reflects a duality of role on the part of the orators (never completely integrated); they are at once democratic leaders and members of an intellectual élite within Athenian politics.

Rather it is for Isocrates an Athens frozen in time, an unalterable blueprint of the city as it once existed. This Athens must serve as standard for our political conduct, Isocrates informs his fellow citizens: 'the one way—the only possible way—which can avert future perils for us and deliver us from our present ills is that we should be willing to restore that earlier democracy which was insti tuted by Solon and which was reestablished by Cleisthenes'.129 This polity, which has been acknowledged as a model of perfection throughout the civilized world,130 comprised a unified citizenry ('of the same mind regarding public affairs') that had been an exemplar of disinterested patriotism and altruism. Ever ready to sacrifice their private resources for the city's welfare, the citizens had shown in their mutual relations 'that degree of consideration for each other which is due from men who are right-minded and partners in a common fatherland'.131 Although Demosthenes is fully involved in the fray of contemporary politics, unlike Plato and Isocrates, he nonetheless appears to have accepted their mimetic aim, at least in part."2 For Demosthenes, as for Isocrates, historic Athens provides a timeless model of perfection universal in its appeal ; its citizens alone of mankind have merited a renown that surpasses all detraction.133 These citizens were exemplars of public-spiritèdness and altruism: 'they were careful to obey the spirit of the constitution . . . [and] selfish greed had no place in their statesmanship, but each thought it his duty to further the common weal.'134 So fervent is Demosthenes as guardian of this ideal, indeed, that the role in which he casts himself seems more closely akin to the Old Testament prophet than to Athens' traditional leadership. Despite his lip service to the traditionalist claim regarding the superiority of political action over mere speech in his Second Philippic (3 ff.), Demosthenes often confines his own political contribution to the verbal sphere, and even within this restricted area his intent frequently appears more negative than con structive—less to guide the political conduct of the city than to castigate I2' Areop., 15-16.

CAMPBELL Athens for her misconduct.135 Like the Old Testament prophet chastizing Israel for her divagations from Yahweh's design, Demosthenes rebukes his fellow citizens and their leaders for their failure to measure up to his vision of the constitution.136 Thus idealist metaphysics and an idealized history produce the same result. In both instances the traditionalist political posture of Socrates in Crito has been rejected. Whereas for Socrates, intellect has been subordinated to the duties of citizenship, intellectual culture now tends to become self-justifying, relinquishing its vital bond with the city's nomoi. Politics is often viewed as merely the adjunct of this intellectual culture, a 'politics' purified of the demands and preoccupations of everyday affairs. The notions of law and justice have been so completely sublimated, transformed to accord with the higher values of intellect, that they seem little more than metaphors having only the most remote connection to the legal structure of Athens. Law is primarily an ethical or spiritual condition rather than a political institution, referring to the 'regular and orderly states of the soul', in Plato's formu lation.137 Even Demosthenes (or the pseudo-Demosthenes) sometimes des cribes law as foremost a means for expelling savagery from the soul by the wise legislator.138 And in Isocrates' estimate as well as Plato's, justice is primarily a moral rather than a legal artifact, to be cherished in the souls of those who are rightly governed.139 1,5 'Now you have a habit of asking a speaker on every occasion, "What then must be done?" ; but I prefer to ask you, "What then must be said?" 'Now there are some who think they confute a speaker the moment they ask, "What then ought we to do?" To these I will give the fairest and truest answer: not what you are doing now'. On the Chersonese, 23, 38. Hence Aeschines' description of Demosthenes: 'a man who is made up of words ... if you treat him as you might a clarinet, and take out his tongue, you would have nothing left'. Against Ctesiphon, 229. But in fairness to Demosthenes, I must again emphasize that 1 am here addressing only one of the two roles assumed by him. He was also a practical politician, attaining a position of leadership within Athens. See Werner Jaeger's Demosthenes: The Origin and Growth of His Policy (Berkeley, 1938) for an account of Demosthenes' political career. 116 See, for example. Third Olynthiac, 31-2; On the Peace, 2-3; On the Chersonese, 21-3; Third Philippic, 54-5; On Organization, 19-20,24-5; On the Crown, 61; Against Timocrates, 157-8. 1,7 Gorg.. 504b.

Plato's political ineptitude regarding Sicily, for instance, has been subjected to critical scrutiny,140 as has Demosthenes' visionary attempt to arrest the imperialist sweep of Greek history on behalf of his ancestral constitution.141 In both instances criticism is confined to issues of political casuistry, suggesting only that a Plato or Demosthenes erred in their exercise of practical judgment. The Athenian intellectual has thus remained immune to critical scrutiny regarding his central assertion that his political views are uniquely valid because these are untainted by private interest—that his profession, in elevating him above the self-interested fray of contem porary politics, has exempted him from the perceptual and ethical biases characteristic of other claimants to leadership. Yet it becomes apparent that the intellectual's conception of his political role is misconceived when this conception is appraised within that context of Athens' tradition which he is wont to invoke in order to legitimate his profession. His very commitment to this profession would appear to confer upon him a bias that negates his claims regarding his disinterested analytic perspective and his self-transcending civic ethic. He, too, has a sphere of private interest (private, at least, insofar as his calling stipulates that he reject the city's interests as conceived by the citizen body) more rigidly defined and imperious than had been the class or professional interests of a Solon, Miltiades, Cimon, or Pericles. His perceptions, preferences, and allegiances 140 See M.I. Finley's 'Plato and Practical Polities', in Aspects of Antiquity (New York. 1974). pp. 73-89. Guthrie discusses Plato's practical limitations in a more sympathetic light than Finlev in Hist. Greek Phil.. IV (Cambridge, 1975). pp. 17-32. Guthrie, however, overstates his case, denying that the Platonic intellectual offers any claim to political leadership: The way in which a philosopher might influence the course of government was not bv gaining power himself but by being accepted as advisor to those who held it . . . The philosopher-kings of the Republic, whether or not the world might be ready for them, were certainly not intended to operate in contemporary society. This is borne out not only by the dialogues but by what we know of his pupils, whose activity was advisory and legislative rather than executive. (Ibid.. p. 412.) Guthrie, who describes such Academy-trained political leaders as Pytho and Heracleides as exceptional, has forgotten the Academic assault on Sicily, led by Plato's pupil Dion, just as he has forgotten the numerous Athenian leaders educated in the Academy, including (in addition to the orators), the widely esteemed general.

CAMPBELL are shaped by this calling, and these must pose a threat to his integrity as a leader within the mundane polity—a threat more significant, perhaps, than the most egregiously 'political' forms of self-promotion that he castigates. Of course this conclusion would be relatively inconsequential if it only deflated the intellectual's pretensions, placing him on a level of mere parity with his rival claimants to leadership. That he viewed the world from a limited perspective—that he too was only human—is hardly a devastating revelation, even though it is true that his avowed exemption from such human frailty would appear to constitute the sole basis for his claim to political ascendancy. The trouble is that the intellectual seems reduced, by virtue of his perspective, to a level markedly inferior to his rivals, the 'politicians',142 for not only does his professional bias render him incompetent to solve the practical problems of mundane politics, it actually creates problems that otherwise are non existent. These problems, deriving from the intellectual's endless preoccu pation with that 'true' politeia which alone warrants his unconditional allegiance, would seem to ensure his political failure under any circumstances of Athenian history. In the first place, the intellectual's analytic perspective is flawed, both in a central assumption and in its efficacy, by dint of his normative commitments. The assumption—that political man must be devoid of self-regarding motives if the state is to function as it should—renders the intellectuals less recog nizable than their opponents as bearers of Athenian tradition and, at the same time, jess qualified to address the city's problems. This notion of the 'good' (ancestral) citizen as actuated by an abstract sense of justice collides not merely with contemporary experience within Athens but also with traditional belief, for in the past it had been taken for granted that political—and indeed all human—transactions were irreducibly self-regarding. Sophocles' Oedipus Rex, for instance, had depicted personal ambition not merely as an inevit ability but, properly channelled, a boon to the state.143 Self-interest had not '42 On the identification of 'politicians', see S. Perman, 'The Politicians in the Athenian Democracy of the Fourth Century B.C.', Athenaeum, 41 (1963), pp. 327-55. 143 This quality of self-regard had imparted an expectation of quid pro quo to Greek religiosity from Homeric times (Iliad, 1.39 ff.), reducing holiness to 'an art of barter between gods and men', in Plato's estimate, Euthyphro, 14e. Even the exalted religiosity of Aeschylus reflects this preoccupation, for his characters frequently appeal to the gods' self-interest in their prayers. See, for instance, Libation Bearers, 254-63, Seven Against Thebes, 173-80 and esp. 270-80, where Eteocles' prayer is cast almost as a business transaction. This barter relationship was apparently the foundation of religious legalism which, according to M P. Nilsson, was one of the major features of Greek religion. See his Greek Piety, originally published 1948 (New York, 1969), pp. 30 ff.; here legalism is defined as 'the attempt to win the grace and favour of the gods by fulfilling their commands', p. 30. See also A.W.H. Adkins' discussion in Merit and Responsibility</page><page sequence="35">THOUGHT AND POLITICAL ACTION 51 been viewed as posing an insuperable obstacle to the city's welfare in former times because this welfare tended to be restricted in meaning to matters of collective advantage rather than being conceived as an impersonal 'good'.144 That such a conception of political conduct could have issued in seeming triumphs of self-abnegating patriotism, such as those ascribed to a number of Athens' former leaders, is attributable to a counterbalancing of this narrow construction of the public good with an expansive view of self-interest— expansive, at least, in comparison with the infantile political hedonism excoriated in Plato's Gorgias and in the speeches of Isocrates and Demos thenes. According to this conception, the desire for honour and renown is rooted in man's primal urge to surpass his mortality and, therefore, is no less fundamental to the human physis (no less an object of our self interested reckonings) than is the desire for pleasure.145 Here as elsewhere Solon had set the precedent for Athenian politics by invoking this notion to justify his refusal to exploit his power for more obviously self-serving ends. He is too ambitious for such trivial ambitions, he states in effect: 'If I have spared my country and not put my hand forth unto despotism and rentless violence, befouling and disgracing my good name, I am not ashamed of it: for thus methinks I rather surpass the world . . . why did I stay me ere I had won that for which I gathered the commons? Right good witness shall I have in the court of time.'146 For the fourth-century thinkers, in contrast, self-interest poses an in superable problem because it cannot be assimilated to their model of political conduct. The leader must conceive virtuous political conduct within present day Athens as transformative in aim rather than as instrumental to the satisfaction of existing desires; it must seek not to accommodate present interests but to make men 'better' or more disinterestedly just. Consequently, (Chicago, 1960), pp. 134-5, and. for parallels within Christianity, A.J. Krailsheimer's Studies in Self-Interest: From Descartes to La Bruyère (Clarendon. 1962), passim. 144 Hence Adkins' observation: 'The agathon which the Greek pursues is not "Something which is good for the majority even if it harms me, and therefore I will put up with it." It is of no use to tell him even in a military context, where a certain self-sacrifice might be expected, that he must stay and fight because it is to the advantage of all for him to do so even if he is killed... agathon to be pursued, must be "agathon for me" '. Merit and Responsibility, p. 251. Of course self-interest was perceived as having its nether side even in the fifth century, as is obvious in Thucydides' famous Melian dialogue, V.87 ff., esp. 89, 105. See also the depiction of Athenian self-interest offered by the 'Old Oligarch', in his Constitution of the Athenians, 1.6,1.9, passim. 145 See Lysias' Funeral Oration on this score, 77 ff. Even Thucydides, not usually given to sentimentality in his assessment of motives, accepts this need as fundamental (see I.lxxvi.2), as does Plato's contemporary, Xenophon (Hiero, vii.3). 146 Frgs. 32-33a, 36-7; see also frgs. 13.1-4.</page><page sequence="36">52 Β. CAMPBELL self-interest, which hitherto had been accepted as the state's motive force, now becomes inimical to civic virtue. A politician is to be castigated as corrupt if, accepting the traditional conception of motivation, he seeks to further his own aims by serving the interests of his constituency. Isocrates, for example, opposes self-interested political conduct to political virtue. The citizens of his ancestral constitution 'did not regard a charge over public affairs as a chance for private gain but as a service to the state'; contemporary leaders, in contrast, 'take no thought for the things which are advantageous to the commonwealth but are ready to go to any extreme to further their personal advantage'.147 Similarly, Plato condemns Athens' contemporary politicians because they seek, from self-regarding motives, to gratify the desires of their constituency.148 Not only does the new model of political conduct create dilemmas of its own by drawing this sharp contrast between self-interested and virtuous political conduct, it also denies itself access to tradition as an archetypal response to the issue of self-interest. The very antithesis that creates the problem also renders past solutions unacceptable. Plato, for instance, views the traditional response to self-interest not as an integral part of the ancestral political style, which in other contexts he had found so commendable, but rather as a compromise that had diminished ancestral grandeur. Although he praises Athens' traditional leadership in Menexenus, as we have seen, and cites this tradition—'the principles and traditions of our forefathers'—as justification for condemning contemporary politics in the Seventh Letter,149 he condemns Athens' past leaders along with contemporary politicians in Gorgias, where he has drawn his contrast between virtuous and self-interested conduct. Pericles, Miltiades, Cimon, and Themistocles 'were scarcely, if at all, superior to their successors', since the former were no less negligent than the latter in diverting Athens' 'desires another way instead of complying with them [or in 147 Isocrates, Areop., 24-6; Panathenaicus, 133. Aeschines and Demosthenes draw the same irreconcilable contrast between private interest and political virtue; see, for instance, Aeschines' description of the constitutional laws in Against Timarchus, 177-9 and Against Ctesiphon, 194; Demosthenes' contrast between his own disinterested political style.

This critique is not bound by the requirement of equability of application or by any conventional rules of evidence, since it would seem to admit of no counter evidence. Plato's case against Pericles is cogent only if one accepts a priori the validity of Plato's assumption that the norms of his ideal city must take precedence over those shared by Athens' citizens—only if the criterion of making citizens 'better' is construed as Plato himself has stipulated. Prima facie, Plato's argument that Pericles' ill-treatment (his trial for embezzlement) at the hands of Athens' citizens had demonstrated his failure to make his charges better151 would seem to apply at least as well to Plato's mentor, since Socrates explicitly claimed to have been charged with the task of making Athens' citizens better152 and even touts himself, in the Gorgias, as the only real statesman of his day, as measured by this standard.153 But Plato does not accept the conclusion here that consistency would seem to dictate, i.e. that Socrates' condemnation by his fellow-citizens had also reflected on his statesmanship.154 On the contrary, Gorgias depicts this trial as a sort of confirmation of the validity of Socrates' mission: he was 'like a doctor tried by a bench of children on a charge brought by a cook'.155 Furthermore, the evidence would appear to suggest that from a merely political perspective Pericles had indeed made his citizens 'better', in the sense of having furthered their common interests. Accepting the acquisitive aims of the city as his mandate, he transformed Athens into a resource-laden 150 Gorg., 503c ff., 517b. /6/rf.,515e-516d. 152 Apology, 30de. Gorg., 521d. Dodds emphasizes that this is Plato's claim, rather than Socrates' own. Plato, Gorgias, p. 369. 154 This criticism was raised against Gorgias in antiquity, and was turned against Plato himself, as well as Socrates. According to Dodds, 'People asked whether Socrates had made Alcibiades and Critias better men, whether Plato made Dionysius II a better man, and whether the Athenians' treatment of Socrates did not disprove his claim to be a statesman'.

From Solon's day down to the time of Demosthenes, Athens' political thinkers had stressed the limitations of human accomplishment, emphasizing that success in politics is always tenta tive and fleeting.158 It seems highly unlikely that any of the fourth-century thinkers, imbued as they were with that tragic mentality which was no less a part of Athens' heritage than was her political tradition,159 would presume to criticize Pericles' inability to surmount the Keynesian 'long run'. The fact remains that Pericles had given to Athens Periclean Athens. His regime had endured longer than that of Solon or of any other past leader. It had success fully ministered to the public welfare as measured by any non-Platonic standard, whether material prosperity or cultural achievement.160 If this accomplishment was but an outcome of Pericles' pandering to the Athenian mob, as Plato's Gorgias suggests, then one can only admire this mob for its exquisite taste. The intellectual is incompetent, then, to address the problems of politics even as he defines these, insofar as he is unable to reconcile the antithesis between self-interest and public virtue that he himself has created. The Gorgias makes it clear that this animus against self-interest must result in a posture of rejection toward the self-serving politics of Athens. After cen 156 There seems to be little doubt that the desire for empire was universal within Athens. On this point see R. Meigg, The Athenian Empire (Oxford. 1972).

On the contrary, he announces that his duty requires him to effect an inward retreat from the politics of his corrupt city: he must cease being a 'busy-body'.162 His strategy is not then to supplant but merely to endure passively the inferior leaders who continue to dominate Athenian politics. In his condition of withdrawal, he must endure the taunts of political men such as Callicles who will be quick to point out the ironic denouement of the intellectual's preoccupation with his higher city: it has rendered him apolitical and thus utterly powerless within the Athens he inhabits; he has become a pathetic creature who 'must cower down and spend the rest of his days whispering in a corner with three or four lads'.163 It may be true that the Gorgias reflects an uncharacteristically pessimistic attitude on Plato's part, that the status quo he is here condemning is not his contemporary city but the Athens of Nicias or Cleon, as A.E. Taylor has suggested.164 After all, the Gorgias does not rule out the possibility of sub sequent political involvement for the intellectual who has renounced his civic duties under conditions he defines as unacceptable. In counselling others of a philosophic bent to accompany him on his spiritual withdrawal from politics, Socrates makes it clear that this withdrawal need only be temporary: 'after wards, having practised [virtue] together, we shall in due course, if we deem it right, embark on politics or proceed to consult on whatever we may think fit'.165 Still, this suggestion that the intellectual can justifiably retreat from the political life of his city raises a second major problem of intellectualist politics in the fourth century, that posed by the tentative and restricted quality of the ",l See note 112 above.

CAMPBELL intellectual's sense of obligation to his city. If in his analytic perspective he creates the problem of self-interest as an abstract possibility, he exemplifies this problem as a political actuality in the ethical credo that defines his political obligations. The idea enshrined in Gorgias of effecting an honourable retreat to a life of private contemplation, away from a political world that had failed to measure up to one's expectations, would have been inconceivable prior to the fourth century.166 Solon and his successors had taken it for granted that their obligation to the city was not subject to such facile annulment, or for that matter, to any sort of unilateral abrogation on the leader's part. Solon, apparently, had been harried by his political obligations to the end, retiring only after Athens had embraced the tyranny of Peisistratus; he then 'brought his armour out in front of his door and said that for his part he had come to his country's aid as far as he could (for he was now a very old man) and that he called on the others to do the same'.167 Solon apparently believed that he remained obliged in his leadership role for so long as he was deemed useful by the Athenian public. And Pericles also seems to have conducted himself according to this belief. Retired from politics in the wake of his trial, Pericles was compelled to resume a public career that could hardly have been more disastrous for him personally168 by the same dogged sense of obligation that had guided Solon. Approached by the volatile Athenian populace, Pericles forgave them for their ill-treatment and acceded to their request.169 It is true, of course, that leaders in the Solonian tradition had considered themselves to be the city's foremost counsellors, no less than did Socrates of Gorgias. But for these, this counselling role did not itself define their political obligations. Their engagement in the city's affairs had been total and cate gorical, regardless of whether their counsel was accepted. Just as Solon and Pericles had remained constant in their duty after the city had rejected their advice, so Aristides, another subject of Athens' political hagiography (who 166 On the contrasting attitudes of fifth- and fourth-century Athens regarding this notion, see Victor Ehrenberg's 'Polypragmosyne', esp. pp. 46-7. 117 Constitution of Athens., XIV.2. "'8 In addition to his trial for embezzlement and those of his mistress Aspasia and his friend Anaxagoras for impiety, he had been harassed with charges of responsibility not merely for the war (for which nearly everyone had clamoured) but also for the very plague that had killed off his legitimate sons and, as Plutarch observes, 'of his relatives and friends the largest part, and of those who were most serviceable to him in his administration of the city'. Pericles, xxxvi.4. 165 Ibid., \\\\ii. 1—2.</page><page sequence="41">THOUGHT AND POLITICAL ACTION 57 had been known to withdraw a political proposal on the point of having it carry, persuaded that his opponent's measure was best for the city), had once written his own name dutifully on the ostracism ballot in behalf of an illiterate fellow citizen sitting next to him in the Assembly who had explained that, even though he did not know this man, Aristides, he was thoroughly 'tired of hearing him everywhere called "The Just" \170 Socrates of the Crito also reflects this older notion of unqualified allegiance, in contrast to the Socrates of Gorgias. Here he reminds himself that as a citizen he is like a soldier stationed at his post: 'you must not give way or draw back or leave your post, but in war and in court and everywhere, you must do whatever the state, your country, commands, or you must show her by persuasion what is really right'.171 In the fourth century, Socrates' analogy of the soldier at his post has become trivialized, reduced to a mere rhetorical device to be hurled in vidiously at one's political adversaries. Thus Aeschines labours this analogy to remind Athens that Demosthenes had already fled his post in terror during the battle, of Chaeronaea.172 Here as elsewhere, the fourth-century intel lectual evinces a greater affinity with the Sophists than with his Athenian ancestors: his ethical orientation, like his analytical perspective, does not centre upon Athens. His allegiances and commitments lie outside the political arena, for his foremost loyalty is to his calling, which—unlike that of Socrates—is not bound up inextricably with the fate of his city. Inherent in the intellectual's craft, indeed, is an aversion to the sort of dogged commitment epitomized in Solon and Pericles or in the soldier in the Crito. Apart from the intellectual's craft, there are no commitments that can be regarded as more than inconclusive or provisional—mere approximations of truth173 and, as such, hardly the stuff on which to stake one's life, as Crito's soldier analogy 110 Plutarch, Aristides, iii.2, vii.5-6. On the accuracy of this anecdote, see F.D. Harvey, 'Literacy in the Athenian Democracy', Revue des Éludes Grecques, 79 (1966), pp. 592-3. 171 Crito. 51bc. This analogy is first drawn in the Apology (28e), where Socrates reminds his jurors that as a soldier he had remained at his post. For other instances, see Guthrie, Hist. Greek Phil., Ill, p. 379, note 1. 172 Against Ctesiphon, 159; cf. 253. 171 Consequently Plato can repudiate the entire corpus of his writings without loss of credibility, at least if the Second Letter is accurate. The author of this letter declares that 'no treatise by Plato exists or will exist, but those that now bear his name belong to a Socrates become fair and young'. 314c.</page><page sequence="42">58 Β. CAMPBELL would require.174 Fpr example, Plato's teaching mission is devoid of that sense of duty toward the city characteristic of his teacher. Whereas Socrates, according to the Apology,1''5 preferred to edify his fellow citizens, the Academy readily received pupils from all regions and political persuasions.176 Moreover, Plato's-disappointment with the realities of practical politics, which had compelled him to retreat from Athenian public life, had by no means required him to abstain from involvement in the intrigues of Syracuse throughout a period spanning two generations of tyranny and the subsequent tumultuous reigns of Dion et al. By the same token, Isocrates, who con scientiously shunned the self-promoting politics of Athens' assembly and courts, did not refuse the luxurious gifts resulting from his dalliance with monarchy.177 Thus the intellectuals were as deficient in their ethical orientation as in their analytic perspective—deficient, at least, from the perspective of that tradition of political leadership they claimed to represent. In their displaced sense of political responsibility, the fourth-century intellectuals seem less akin to Solon and Pericles than to the retired Anaxagoras (the same 'Nous' who had been so completely dependent upon Pericles for his welfare) who, upon being reproached for neglecting his civic obligations after he had retired to his native city, pointed to the heavens in reply, proclaiming Ί am greatly con cerned with my Fatherland'.178 174 This new attitude had been noted in the fourth century by Phocion, the last great Athenian general. Himself an alumnus of Plato's Academy and a seasoned politician (having occupied the office of generalship more often than any other Athenian, including Pericles), Phocion was eminently qualified to assess the political competence of the new breed of intellectuals. According to Plutarch, Phocion had often remarked upon the retrenchment of political obli gations occurring among the intellectuals as a result of their professionalization—a divorce of thought or counsel from the political and military responsibilities that had given earlier leaders such as Solon and Pericles their claim to political credence. See Phocion's critique of the intellectual's empty verbosity in Plutarch's Phocion, v. 2-4, ix. 4-6. Plutarch sets the tone for this critique in the opening paragraph of his Phocion by quoting Antipater's description of the aged Demades, who had long functioned as an influential orator within Athens: 'he was like a victim when the sacrifice was over—nothing left but tongue and guts'. 175 Apology, 30b. 176 See Guthrie's account of the Academy's pupils in Hist. Greek Phil., V (Cambridge, 1978), pp. 446-93. 177 One of the charges he feels compelled to defend himself against in Antidosis is that he 'had received many great presents from Nicocles, the king of the Salaminians'; 40. See also his orations To Nicocles and To Demonicus, as well as his various letters to Dionysius, Philip, Alexander, and Archidamus. 178 Diogenes Laertius, Lives, ii.7.</page><page sequence="43">THOUGHT AND POLITICAL ACTION 59 IV Postscript Plato apparently altered his views regarding the political role of the intel lectual in his later years. In the Laws he abandons not merely the central notion of the Republic that intellectuals should preside over the state, but also the general tendency of the middle dialogues to allow the norms of sophia to obtrude upon politics. Here Plato denies the possibility of a disinterestedly patriotic intellectual leader, for he has accepted as inevitable the tension between intellectual and political commitments: 'no law or ordinance is mightier than knowledge, nor is it right for Reason to be subject or in thrall to anything, but to be lord of all things, if it is really true to its name and free in its inner nature'.179 Consequently, the intellectual of Magnesia appears to have resumed the posture of Socrates in Crito, submitting to the norms of the city; in his political capacity he seems directed by iphronesis\ But the political intellectual of the middle dialogues had been launched irretrievably upon his career. That he has retained his allure even in the present age attests to a far greater power of the fourth-century thinkers as creators of their own tradition than as bearers of an antecedent political style.
