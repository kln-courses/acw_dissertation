This could, however be a very Beckettian move, indeed. Neither is the exhibition, thankfully another 'literary' one of photos and books interspersed with inevitably mediocre art works attempting to 'illustrate' a writer; nor is it, unfortunately, the necessary and long overdue groundwork: an introduction to Ireland of the canonical visual art created in reaction to or dialogue with Beckett's work during the last four decades. Bram van Velde, even Alberto Giacometti, Robert Ryman and, most importantly for the generation of emerging artists, Bruce Nauman, have not been seen here. A graffito at NCAD puts this succinctly:'BRUCE NOMAN7 By contrast an ambitious millennium exhibition entitled Endgames was organised?not here but in Geneva. Very recently, Bruce Nauman retrospectives have not only been shown around the globe (bypassing Ireland), but the tangible and seminal inspiration of Nauman by Beckett has been thoroughly researched and presented in an exhibition?in Vienna. This evidence almost amounts to another posthumous emigration of the author; this time brought about by an apparent lack of interest in his visual legacy in his home country. The curator of the current exhibition, Pieter Hensen, attempts to bring Beckett 'home' single handedly. He is Dutch, an artist who seems to have fewer scruples than literary scholars or art historians to begin to tackle a demanding, interdisciplinary topic. Without a wide awareness of how our prized Irish authors have been adapted and adopted into the very visual European imagination of which they were a part, without the mentioned groundwork i.e., the current exhibition may initially be welcomed merely as another low budget attempt at introducing the public on this island to current European art. The fact that it is beautifully presented and shows a variety of practices (with a I stress on sculpture, video and installation) already makes it well worth a visit. In relation to the Beckettian theme, text would be an expected conceptual approach. There are indeed quotes from the writer But they are adequately 'disguised': as unreadable, non protruding Braille letters on a perspex 'headstone' or as Morse code drummed with sore knuckles on a table (both by Dermot O'Brien). Beckett's text exists as pauses between stage directions read out in Italian by Liliana Moro, as clear inspiration of the evocatively contradictory pleas "let me down? don't let me down" and a stubbornly refuted "drop it" in works by Carl von Weiler Art on Beckett is obviously not about quotes?and not really 'about' much at any rate. Absence is the theme of the works presented in Derry: Mary Maclntyre's photographs of stage curtains without any other props or actors and Maurice van Tellingen's three dimensional wall pieces including the white noise of television screens seemed particularly appropriate. Peter Cleutjens, in his large pin-hole photographs on canvas, also addresses absence by means of spot light effects on empty spaces. But painting has a difficult stand in this context: an investigation of painting's means is so omnipresent that it can only bring forth the vaguest relation to how Beckett has seen the world. Each artist needed to choose and has chosen their own approach to the author?if it was indeed the artist and not the curator Andrew Currie e.g. claims not to have read Beckett before his name was mentioned in reviews of the artist's work. Quite rightly, this has not deterred Hensen. Currie's anthropomorphic combinations of small fans and black refuse sacks Hans Op de Beeck: Determination (4), 1998; courtesy Ormeau Baths Gallery 50?

Beckett's spirit is certainly tangible. This is more important than supposedly 'direct' inspiration or the artist's stated intention. The demise of the notions of authenticity and originality also has a bearing on how it is to be interpreted that Nauman's perspective on Beckett casts such a strong light on these very recent works. One would miss the point of Beckett and contemporary art completely if one were to expect of someone like Carl von Weiler to avoid references to Nauman's essentially human and visual exploration of the body its idiosyncrasies and its limits. Nauman has after all introduced these elements as important fields of enquiry into contemporary art? based on his reading of Beckett. Richard Crow needs to allude to Beuys in his installation with tape recorders that are at once a reference to Beuys and Krapp's Last Tape, because he is representing the additive, Joyce-inspired Beckett of the trilogy, rather than the Beckett of the 'minimalist' plays. Only in the case of Joris Wille I felt that Tony Oursler with his Not-l-like mouth projections on dolls' heads made of stockings would have been preferable to these less strong and menacing stocking heads with pillows. But then, this is not the better known artists' turn?and for once, Oursler has been shown in Dublin. Hans op de Beeck's model of a crossroads, complete with dead trees and a set of functioning traffic lights, seems to comment beautifully on how Ireland has changed when juxtaposed (inevitably in the context) with an imaginary stage set of Waiting for Godot. We hardly seem to notice the ecological collapse and readily substitute Beckett's hopeful singular green leaf for a stylish technical apparatus that promises to gives us the go ahead?i.e. if we'll ever see an empty crossroads again. The construction of the room in which the model is presented once more reminds one of Nauman's ^^^ Dream Passages with eerie light. An exhibition like this raises the question whether Beckett himself has viewed for example his Quad, 1982, as a visual artwork in the wake of video art pioneered by Nauman and others in the 1960s. Inspiration is not a one way street and James Knowlson's biography has shown effectively that art has played an important part in the writer's life and work. In 1997, Quad was included as a matter of course among the visual work at documenta X. The current exhibition is witness to the fact that Beckett is still very much alive for the generation of emerging artists. Almost anyone could have been included. Hensen seems to take this into account and embraces a certain arbitrariness by changing the participants of not i wherever the exhibition is shown. It is enjoyable to look at Beckett through young artists' eyes?and it would have been even more enlightening to be able to assess their more canonical predecessors' perspectives on the writer simultaneously. Hopefully, this creative approach to an important theme will eventually lead to a more comprehensively researched exhibition plus catalogue that may not only bridge the gap between art and literature, but also that between outdated expectations of literary' exhibitions and the current associative approach. 'Who remembers a single piece by Nauman included in ROSC '84? Some book objects by Ryman and others were shown at the Douglas Hyde Gallery in 1991. No catalogue remains.
