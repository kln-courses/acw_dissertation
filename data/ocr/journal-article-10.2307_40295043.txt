The ancient lawgiver Solon of Athens left norms of proper conduct that carry important ethical implications for all manner of human affairs, including commercial activities and the pursuit of wealth. In his extant poetry, he emphasizes the strong connections between individual virtue and its consequences in the social and political sphere. In considering the proper means of obtaining material wealth, he describes multiple ways to earn a living and connects them to proper intellectual and ethical dispositions through a concept of justice. This focus on virtue establishes a long-range ethics that is based on a principle of justice, demands rational intellectual activity, and carries implications for everyone's self-interest. Solon's concern for matters of virtue, the proper means of attaining wealth, and the need for long-range awareness of conse- quences offers a valuable point of historical focus for our own examinations of business ethics today. KEY WORDS: ancient, classical, ethics, career, fate, goal setting, Greece, Greek, justice, law, Solon, virtues, wealth Introduction Modern studies in business ethics have come to rec- ognize the value of ancient thinkers.1 Institutional forms and concepts have changed dramatically over the past two and a half thousand years, and no ancient figure could have foreseen the scientific and industrial revolutions. Yet, like us, ancient peoples faced ethical problems with life or death consequences. They needed moral, political, and legal standards by which to order their lives properly and to preserve their freedom to think and to act without compromising the social order of their city-state, or polis. Many of their ethical discoveries - in particular, the idea that we need such standards, even if we disagree about their content - remain valid guides to conduct in a modern business context, despite our massively greater industrial and technological achievements and our vastly different political institutions.2 In 594 BC the village of Athens - which had not yet reached the cultural heights of the later classical period - was on the verge of civil war. For reasons largely hidden to us, certain nouveau riches, men of families with no aristocratic standing, were gaining personal success and status through the attainment of wealth. (I use "man" here to stress that Solon's poems are concerned with Greek males.) They were challenging the social and political prerogatives of the ruling aristocracy, which boasted of noble birth as its claim to those privileges. The crisis was in many ways a clash of moral values - a conflict be- tween the claims of the traditional aristocracy, who saw virtue as connected to noble birth, versus the claims of those who were gaining wealth and wanted recognition of their own excellence. In the ensuing social upheaval, the polis - by which Solon always means Athens - had fallen into an economic crisis. Many farmers were deeply indebted and had pledged their persons as security for the loans. As they de- faulted, many were taken into slavery, either owned outright or forced to work for their debtors. The resultant pressures threatened to engulf the entire polis into violence. As tensions rose between factions in Athens, the citizens chose Solon (ca. 640-560 BC), a poet and singer with a reputation for justice, to be their chief official and to mediate their disputes. His is the first voice from ancient Athens, and the date of his appointment as chief official is the first confirmable date for Athens, 594 BC. Solon enacted political, social, legal, and moral reforms that served as the foundation for Athens' later development into the world's first democracy and into a commercial center of the Greek world during the classical age.</page><page sequence="2">124 John David Lewis Solon used poetry to bring a new standard of excellence to Athens, and he elevated these ethical maxims into the forefront of discourse. This brought some measure of harmony to the social and political practices of the Athenians, which laid the ground- work for long-lasting political change. According to later writers, especially Aristotle and Plutarch, he provided the Athenians with a unified festival calendar, wrote a comprehensive set of laws, estab- lished the first courts of appeal in Athens, and opened the legal process to anyone who wished to participate. Solon also reformed certain commercial exchange practices, including laws regulating ex- ports, and is alleged to have enacted a law regulating brothels. In essence if not explicitly, he subordinated the pursuit of wealth to an ethical code and de- manded that those pursuing wealth do so in a seemly manner. In considering Solon's economic reforms, we must not assume a money economy, but rather an agricultural context dependent upon barter.5 There are several reasons for emphasizing this fact. The first is to avoid the use of modern economic terminology that could inappropriately imply the presence of modern capital markets, or could overstate the conceptual tools by which these early Greeks understood their own wealth-pursuits and the effects on their ethical dispositions. Second, this recogni- tion of an agricultural, bartering context allows us to focus on the ethical importance of material wealth per se, even absent the particular forms of wealth creation and exchange we use today. This allows us to abstract the nature and effects of material wealth from money, by focusing on the real material value itself rather than the paper form we see today. Solon is concerned with the effects of material wealth as he understood it, but his understanding can be applied to forms that he had not seen and might not have grasped. There is a huge difference between a businessman running a financial company today and a farmer growing grain in 600 BC - but perhaps not as much difference in the ethical issues that arise in matters of wealth. Beyond Solon's political, legal, and economic reforms, his maxims, ethical guides, and principles have left strong lessons for those who wish to pursue wealth in a just and proper way today. The com- prehensiveness of his maxims may be his greatest lesson for us. Business ethics, to be relevant, must be relatable to a social and political context. To Solon as for all Greeks, individual ethics and the characters of the citizens are strongly constitutive of social norms, which are reflected in the institutionalized enact- ment and enforcement of laws. At one level, ethical norms offer guidance for conduct, and thus help define the nature of the state we conduct ourselves in and the laws it enforces. Conversely, the norms and laws adopted by that state strongly influence the practices adopted by the citizens, and thereby influence their individual ethical natures. Such a give-and-take was central to major Greek thinkers such as Plato and Aristotle. Human responsibility and social upheaval Solon's life has been reconstructed for us from anecdotal evidence by the writer Plutarch (ca. AD 40-120), and some of his ethical maxims were given narrative form by Herodotus in the mid-fifth-cen- tury BC. But it was Aristotle (388-322 BC) who first waxed philosophically on Solon's political and economic importance.6 Although it is tempting to draw upon Herodotus, Plutarch, and others for evidence of Solon's thought, these later writers elaborated upon Solon's own preserved words according to their own philosophical and moral views. These views offer much information about the tenor of their own times but must be used with care in discerning Solon's own ideas. Solon was contemporaneous with Thaïes, the first of the Milesian natural philosophers, and he lived 200 years prior to Aristotle. Fortunately, Plutarch, Aristotle, and others also preserved fragments of Solon's own poetry, which were intended to be memorized as maxims of wisdom and sung. Solon's poem 4, the so-called Hymn to the Polis, is of seminal impor- tance in the development of ethical and political thought. It provides a vital context for Solon's wis- dom about the pursuit of wealth.7 Solon begins by noting that Athens will never be destroyed by divine intervention; it is only human beings who can cause its demise: Our polis will never be destroyed by a dispensation from Zeus or the plans of the blessed immortal gods, for truly a great-hearted daughter of a mighty father Pallas Athena holds her hands over it.</page><page sequence="3">Solon of Athens and the Ethics of Good Business 125 The citizens themselves by their foolishness desire to destroy the great polis, persuaded by material goods, and the leaders of the people have an unbalanced mind, by which they are about to suffer many pains from great hubris. For they do not understand how to restrain their greed nor to order the present festivities as a meal in calmness. They grow rich, persuaded by their unjust deeds.8 Athena is the protector of Athens, holding off the natural and divine forces that earlier poets, such as Homer and Hesiod, had once drawn as directly intervening in human affairs. Yet, Athena is unable to prevent the destructive consequences of men who lose their moral and intellectual bearings; they will have to save themselves. Solon here defines a distinct sphere of responsibility for human beings, and he refuses to allow them to blame divine interference for that which they have caused themselves. This assignment of responsibility is a precondition for all ethical judgment, which will carry important implications for Solon's views of wealth attainment. Solon's metaphor for the polis is a ceremonial meal, at which the men of depraved moral faculties act with arrogance, presumably pushing others around and taking more than they justly deserve. They are violating an ethical principle by infringing on the prerogatives of others, and such actions are leading to conflict. Solon tells us that "by their foolishness" they "desire" to destroy the polis, be- cause their leader has an "unbalanced mind," caused by an improper attitude toward material goods. To be "persuaded by unjust deeds" is Solon's formula- tion for the psychological encouragement that fol- lows when one gains from unjust action - as when an embezzlement scheme or accounting fraud grows, following short-term success. Solon sees a powerful connection between thought, appetites, and action: it is thoughts that lead people to act in ways that are ethically unseemly, and when they receive physical rewards for their unethical conduct, they are motivated to further unethical action. Should the leaders of the polis do this - a point that implies the citizens at large - ruin will fall upon everyone. Solon knows no divide between an intellectual and a moral failing; in this early age it is central to Solon's views that an intellectual failing is a moral failing, and that immoral actions and "weak- ness of will" (a later Greek formulation) are based ultimately upon intellectual failings (more on this below). Those of us heeding his lessons today will place the use of reason central to our personal, political, and business ethics - and will recognize that our actions and their consequences are our own responsibilities. Solon's explanation for Athens' political condi- tion, the intellectual status of its citizens, is based on justice, the Greek dike, a term that will require more explanation below. For the moment, we may note that the "unbalanced mind" of the leader is an adikos noos, literally an "unjust disposition," which leads him to act with the arrogant assaults that the Greeks called hubris. Hubris is not merely an arrogant atti- tude; it is an action, an assault on the honor, or prerogatives of another person, the community, or the gods; it includes larceny, battery, or the public demeaning of another person. To act with hubris is to act unjustly and unethically. Wealth is a good thing - we shall see that Solon wants it enough to work and pray for it - but it must not be gotten by unjust means or by men with unjust dispositions, because it will lead them to commit hubristic assaults against the prerogatives of others. Solon recognizes that the commission of those ac- tions "persuades" a person to commit further injustices, which spreads into a cycle of violence in the body politic. In the end, for Solon, the cause of problems in Athens is rooted in matters of the intellect, and in what we may call character flaws, but which he did not distinguish from such intel- lectual failings. It is those failings which allow men to be persuaded by material goods to commit the kinds of actions that put everyone at risk of violence. Virtue and excellence The early Greeks did not have a word for virtue; they rather spoke of arête, or "excellence," which had to be defined in terms appropriate to its object. For Homer and the warriors of the Iliad, arête was fighting skill, including the ability to cunningly outwit an opponent. This was exemplified in Odysseus's construction of the wooden horse. In the post-Homeric world in which Solon lived, Greek thinkers had redefined arête into the excellence appropriate to a Greek male in the polis. It was first</page><page sequence="4">126 John David Lewis closely connected to men of aristocratic rank, who were understood to have greater excellence than the poor farmers and artisans. Virtue, as transmitted through the Roman and Christian tradition, refers today to some sense of excellence of character as defined by particular virtues. We should note here that the Greek ethos - the etymological root of ethical - relates to the character that develops from certain habits of action. To say a person is ethical is to say that he has developed proper virtues of character from the practice of good actions. It is Solon's view that these actions are subject to our understanding and that a person will develop certain dispositions to act based on his understanding and his practices. If his dispositions are malformed and he has wealth and power, the consequences will be horrifie. Our understanding of virtue today must come to terms with the production and exchange of wealth on a scale never contemplated in the ancient world. Solon makes the connection between character issues and nous explicit in a poetic verse that dem- onstrates the disvalue of wealth to a man who lacks the virtue needed to control it: For excess breeds hubris, whenever great wealth follows a man whose understanding (noos) is flawed. "Excess" - the Greek koros - is not too much material goods by some arbitrary amount; it is rather an amount that exceeds the capacity of a person to understand and to control it. The source of what we may call "greed," which is an aspect of Solon's koros, is a desire for wealth that exceeds one's own noetic disposition, and therefore one's ability to use it properly and to benefit from. Solon's argument is not against wealth; it is against the unjust pursuit of wealth. A person's debased intellectual and ethical state makes him unfit for wealth (and power), and which leads to further abuse, and to further im- proper persuasions, or ethical habits. Solon repeated this idea in a different poem, again stressing that there was no long-term benefit from wealth gained by unjust means: Many evil men grow rich, and good men poor. But we will not exchange our virtue for their wealth, since the latter abides forever, but money jumps from one man to another11 Solon here stresses the hierarchical relationship between wealth and virtue: since it is a proper ethical disposition that allows one to pursue wealth properly, to sell one's virtue would lead inevitably to a loss of one's wealth. This is a repetition of the idea, stated above, that wealth is only as valuable as the ethical character of the man who possesses it. In our own world, the presence of virtue in a busi- nessperson is revealed by his use of the resources available to him or her. A person who rises in a corporation to a level that is beyond his ability to handle will be worse off - and more detrimental to the organization as a whole - than if he had reached a level appropriate to his understanding and his abilities. Thus, Solon rants against those of position in the polis - its "leaders" - who act in an unseemly way, but he also denies that the com- mons have a right to the redistributed wealth of the rich. Those on either side are capable of acting with hubris against others and thus deserve Solon's condemnation, based on their characters and those actions. But what is virtue to Solon, and what standard can be discerned for its practice? Solon draws upon an idea, later expanded, and codified by Aristotle, of moderation. In Solon's terms, we are supposed to place our dispositions toward wealth and power - our noos - into proper measure. A calm and properly ordered state of affairs in the polis - and in a cor- poration today - begins with a calm and properly ordered state of affairs in the mind of its leaders and participants. Solon has a verse that is explicit about this understanding: You, calm yourself in your hearts, who drag yourself into a koros of material goods, moderate your mega noos; for we will not be persuaded, nor will things turn out right for you.12 In Solon's terms, this injunction does not apply solely to the rich who might wish to keep their wealth; it also applies to those of a new rising class who are acting in unseemly ways to attain such wealth, as well as to the poor who clamored to tribute the wealth of the rich. The important point is that the proper moral and intellectual character is needed in matters of wealth so that one is not improperly persuaded by the acquisition of wealth to</page><page sequence="5">Solon of Athens and the Ethics of Good Business 127 take unseemly actions. Solon's grasp of being "per- suaded" in this poem and poem 4 (above) is a call to understand and to act as is proper, and not to be caught up in pursuits that may bring short-range gain, but that must fail in the end. Solon is famous, in a passage created by Herod- otus, for claiming that one cannot know whether a person is "blessed" until after all the days of his life have passed and he has died.13 This idea is not in Solon's preserved poetry, although he does make it clear that it is difficult to know the end of all things. But what Solon does claim is that a man can be happy without the possession of great wealth: He is equally rich who has much silver gold, wheat-bearing plains, horses and mules, and he who has this alone, to live pleasantly in stomach, sides and feet, and when this comes, a season for woman and child with proper youthful vigor. This is wealth to mortals; for no one carries to Hades all their surplus possessions, nor can he pay a ransom and escape death, deep disease, or encroaching old-age.14 As we shall see, Solon's ideas are deeply influ- enced by Greek fatalism. But the essential point that remains relevant to a business context today is that the acquisition of wealth for public display or flamboyance is not a route to excellence or to happiness. "They grow rich equally" is another translation of the opening words of this passage, which we may take as the need to evaluate wealth in terms appropriate to a particular person. The Greek poet Hesiod had written similarly of the virtues of farm life, and the need to "work with work upon work" while filling a barn full of hay.15 Only then one should get involved in civic affairs, and attain a position of renown among one's fellows. One should never use public forums, i.e., the courts, to improperly gain the wealth of others. The mere possession of great wealth does not indicate either its virtuous achievement or virtue in the man who possesses it. By implication, a person who gains more than he can properly use will not be happy. Solon does not have a conception of production and does not distinguish activities in terms of productive versus non-productive effects. Absent a way to make such a distinction - and we should here remember the undeveloped state of law and technology at the time - he turns rather to mod- eration as a measured amount of action. To Solon and other Greeks, moderation is the way to avoid hubris. We shall see that he does rule out the use of slavery against Greek males, but he sees this as an overreaching on the part of those doing the enslaving. Those concerned with business ethics today would do well to consider whether moder- ation in the pursuit of rational productive activity is a virtue. Should industrial producers not be praised for their product activities, without regard for moderation? Or is there a certain limit to such activities, beyond which the pursuits become inherently vicious? Solon's own emphasis on moderation will connect directly to his concern for justice, a causal principle of balance, as well as a proper state of affairs in a man's soul as well as the polis. Justice in the polis The centrality of justice - and the connection be- tween injustice and hubris - is further emphasized in the lines that follow in poem 4, the "Hymn to the Polis": Sparing the wealth of neither public nor sacred treasuries with rapaciousness they rob from one another, and fail to guard the sacred foundations of Justice who silently knows what is and what was16 The basic principle of order in the Greek polis is the same as that which keeps balance in a person's mind: justice, the Greek dike. It has a range of meanings in Greek thought and has legal application as a "lawsuit" as well as a "penalty" or "judg- ment."17 Dike, to Solon, is not only a description of a calm state of affairs in a social context; it is a causal principle of order that is natural.18 "Natural" here means arising from the internal actions of an entity, which may be understood causally. Solon's poem on the sea can illustrate this: The sea is stirred up by the wind. And if something does not move it, it is calmest of all things.1 The Greek word for "calmest" is dikaiotate, lit- erally, "most just," which describes the sea when its</page><page sequence="6">128 John David Lewis internal movements are in balance, and it is bereft of violence. Its opposing forces are at equal strength, and none can overcome the other. A 'just" polis is also internally calm, not devoid of factions but also not subject to violence from them, and not domi- nated tyrannically by any one of them. So it goes for a person's noos: it is calm when it is not acting in a hubristic, violent manner. The sea, the polis, and a person will erupt into violence only when some- thing causes this. An adikos noos is an unjust, unbalanced intellectual state of affairs, in which a man is easily thrown out of kilter by the possession of wealth and power that he cannot control. We can grasp the essence of justice as "balance" by consid- ering the meaning of a "balanced" life, of business affairs conducted affairs with a sense of balance and proportion in both ends and means, and of a drive to achieve _ ^ properly - _ j_ - j chosen _ goals £2 -, in a ^ proper ^ way. j _ ^ - _ j_ - j _ £2 -, ^ ^ j _ ^ - _ j_ - j _ £2 -, ^ ^ j For Solon, failure to uphold justice in the polis - to fail to protect the sacred roots of dike in the polis and to fail to respect her by acting in ethically seemly ways - will lay the polis low with violence and slavery. Public officials have a special charge, to protect the treasuries, but justice also requires respect for individuals. Poem 4 continues: But, in time, retribution certainly comes. And now this inescapable wound comes to the entire polis, which falls swiftly into an evil slavery. It awakens civil strife and sleeping tribal war, which destroys the beautiful youth of many; and from its troubles the much-loved polis is swiftly worn out, friendships destroyed in unjust factions. These evils turn on the people; and of the poor many are brought into foreign lands, sold, bound in miserable chains20 Solon's medical metaphor - the inescapable wound - has a concrete meaning. Acting with hubris reopens the feelings of vengeance that follow from an attack on one's honor, which leads to factional fighting, civil strife, and ethnic conflict ("sleeping tribal war"). The individual acts of vengeance that add up to civic violence are remembered as past injustices ("what is and what was") by individuals who demand retribution. The sum total for the "entire polis" is a breakdown in law and order, a disintegration of the community into gangs, and the flight of victims into foreign exile. In Solon's own day, the default of many farmers on their debts, and the use of debt slavery by the creditors, was one of the worst problems facing the people of Athens. The incorporation of debt slavery into early Athenian practices - and its acceptance by magistrates - was a cancer that spread havoc throughout the polis. The enslavement of Attic- speaking men was unseemly to him, and he openly proclaims that he ended it.21 Both Aristotle and Plutarch tell us that the amelioration of such debts was one of Solon's most important achievements, although it is highly unlikely that he canceled them outright. He set clear limits to debt contracts; it is likely that he made it illegal to enforce a default by turning the debtor into a slave (either de facto or by ownership). The wealthy could no longer enslave a debtor, and debtors could not pledge their own bodies as security for a loan. Solon implies here that there are distinct limits to the terms that two parties may accept in a contract - a principle that subordi- nates contracts to an ethical and legal standard and that still applies today. Plutarch and other writers also pass on a tradition that Solon canceled debts in Athens, as a means to ameliorate the underlying economic problems that were fueling the debt slavery and driving the polis into civil war.22 But these later stories have no counterpart in Solon's actual poetry. It is doubtful that he canceled the debts outright; the wealthy classes would likely not have stood for it, and indi- vidual creditors would not have been able to claim that they should not be made to pay. It is more likely that he ended the practice of slavery as a judgment that followed on the default of a debtor - a reform that would have helped spread the practice of law throughout the countryside as the courts became more available to individual farmers, and people learned to accept the judgments received under the laws.23 Solon couches his admonishments in terms of "moderation," but he has actually disavowed an entire category of judgments. This would have set limits to the agreements that could have been made between lenders and borrowers. For a parallel to our own day, we need not think of outright slavery, but only of the broad consequences of deceptive business practices, accounting fraud, or defaults on contracts, in a network of modern business relationships, to realize how a single failure can have wide-ranging</page><page sequence="7">Solon of Athens and the Ethics of Good Business 129 effects across the range of a market. An intellectual failing by an executive in a modern corporation - let alone a conscious plan to defraud - can have consequences for the entire corporate body, if not for millions of people. Everyone involved must act within ethical and legal norms in order to preserve the system of contracts vital to market activity. In tracing the effects of improper action from the intellectual failings of the citizens in the polis to its political condition, Solon then presented another first: he connected the civil strife back to "each one of us" in our homes: Thus the public evil comes to the house of each man. It jumps high over the court-yard fence, breaks down the locked door, and finds any man for certain, even if he flees into the farthest corner of his bed- room24 People should care about the consequences of their actions, Solon claims, not because of some innate rule or categorical imperative to be followed for its own sake, but because the breakdown in law and order leaves each person at individual risk. There will be no sanctuaries on private estates for those who think they can escape civil strife; the disorder and violence will follow them. Solon con- nects the health of the community to the character of each person in it and shows it to be in the self- interest of each person to support the moral norms upon which the polis runs. The ethical intelligence by which a modern corporation is run will reflect in the ethical character and decisions of the corporation as a whole, which influences how each person in it may act. Even more widely, scrupulous adherence to contracts is required by everyone's self-interest, and a breakdown in contracts will have detrimental effects upon the entire context of business dealings. It is important to note that Solon's answer to the political problem caused by wealth gained unethi- cally is not the redistribution of property by a stan- dard of equality, as might be suggested by a modern notion of "social justice." It is clear that some people at the time wanted Solon to redistribute property, but that he rejected this as a kind of hubris directed at those to whom wealth properly belonged. Solon's verses are full of entreaties to restrain the desires of those who would redistribute the wealth of the rich - for it is as much a vice for a poor man to take what is not properly his, as it is for a rich man to rob the poor. Solon makes this clear in a different poetic fragment: To the people I gave as many privileges as belonged to them neither taking away their honor nor overextending it And those who had power and were magnificent due to wealth, I saw to it that they had nothing shameful In defending his own actions as chief official, he reminds the people of Athens that he did not go against the proper order of things by redistributing property. From another poetic fragment: For whatever I said, I have done with the gods, I did not take pointless measures, nor did it please me [to compel] with the force of tyranny nor to subject my rich fatherland to an equality of shares between good and evil men Solon intends that those who deserve their wealth should keep it, and that the citizen body should not have a right to take it. Many people today - as then - consider disparities of wealth to be inherently unjust, but the courts do not yet enforce such claims solely on those terms. The courts are with Solon, although Solon goes much further. He linked the redistribu- tion of wealth with the actions of a tyrant, arrogant, hubristic soul who would not have acted as the gods require. By pandering to the whims of the people, he becomes a tyrant. It is far better, Solon claims, to adopt a "moderate," i.e., "middle" position, and to hear the claims of both sides according to a certain standard of seemly action. Solon's claim here, as it regards the pursuit of wealth, is to note that actions which violate the norms of conduct proper to Greek males have devastating consequences for the social organization. The rule of law collapses when these norms are forgotten. The need for ethical guidance is clear - as well as for ethically proper laws to define, enforce, and foster proper norms of conduct. It is helpful to consider that Solon's poem 4, cited repeatedly here, has no mention of laws; the "Good Order" (Euno- mie) it promotes is based on proper ethical action. Solon's poem 36 rather explains his actions at bringing law to Athens, and thus implies strong</page><page sequence="8">130 John David Lewis effects of laws upon ethical conduct. As in our own time, Solon's audience needs to remember that the laws cannot define, in advance, every detail of proper action. The very purpose of ethical norms here is to guide action in terms of principles apart from exhaustive enumeration in written laws. Lawfulness Solon is not content to leave us adrift, unable to understand how we should conduct our lives and by what principle we can interact rationally with others. The poem heals the breakdown in the polis with Solon's alternative to hubris and violence, a return to justice that takes a particular form: These things my heart prompts me to teach the Athenians: how Lawlessness brings the worst evils to the polis, and Lawfulness manifests good order and everything perfect, and often puts chains on the evil-doers. It smoothes what is rough; quells anger, dims hubris and shrivels the flowering bud of arrogant destruction. It straightens crooked judgments, calms overbearing deeds, stops the deeds of civil strife, and stops the anger of grievous strife. It is by this. that all things to men are perfect and reach their peak28 Lawfulness (the Greek Eunomia) is a state of good orderliness, or the rule of law, in which the people follow the laws and the moral norms that legitimate them. The laws themselves varied among the dif- ferent Greek poleis, according to the norms tradi- tionally used in them, and were developed by lawgivers who became figures of legend.30 The ultimate source of legitimacy was found in the lawgiver's personal authority as a mediator ("man of the middle") and a sage, which was often claimed to agree with the divine order. In terms of historical development, however - much of which is shrouded in legend - the laws became the standard of justice in a polis when the lawgiver swore the people to live by the laws and then went into voluntary exile. The people were then unable to appeal to his personal judgments, and they had to consult the laws directly. This lessened the power of personal whims in judgments and solidified the reliance of the polis upon the laws.31 In poem 4 Solon further supports his vision of lawfulness in terms of consequences. Evil-doers rather than innocent slaves will carry chains (which implies proper prosecution of crimi- nals); the judgments of magistrates will be straight and not crooked (justice will be available and not merely an idea); civil strife will end as public insti- tutions and norms rise above factional disputes. Thus, the competing terms of legitimacy - claims to divine sanction, personal authority, and good con- sequences - come together in a principled, and practical, plan to maintain the order of the polis. Solon is famous for establishing a law of public prosecution, whereby anyone could bring a lawsuit, and not merely those who were party to an unjust action. This was important for the development of public, i.e., criminal, law, and thus in using the power of the community to prevent blood feuds based on accusations.32 Solon has traditionally been credited with the establishment of jury courts in Athens, a claim that should not be overstated; pop- ular sovereignty was not understood at the time, and the idea that a citizen jury should have final say runs counter to Solon's stated desire to restrain the actions of his non-aristocratic fellows. But he did take vital steps to open the law up to everyone and to found it on the dispositions of the citizens to live under the laws. In Solon's words, the anger in their rough minds will fade as they get used to living lawfully, hubris will dim, and their actions will follow suit. It is in such a moral, political, and legal context that "all things reach their peak," and each person will be able to pursue wealth, and to bring benefits to families and friends, by his own energy. The main- tenance of good laws requires a certain commitment by the citizens to those laws; in return, the citizens gain great benefits. Part of the problem that Solon faced was that the existing laws of Athens had been derived from tra- ditional aristocratic norms, and impartial judgments were largely unavailable for those of lower social standing. Farmers did not have access to magistrates who were able to enforce some publicly identifiable, written laws; too often the deck was stacked against a poor farmer who had to face the claims of a rich nobleman with powerful connections. Effective written laws consistent with Solon's new standard of arête were vital to the health of the polis. Solon's rejection of most of the earlier lawgiver Draco's laws</page><page sequence="9">Solon of Athens and the Ethics of Good Business 131 likely reflects such deeper ethical reforms, as well as his attempt to correct the social conflicts they had engendered. Solon described his legal actions in very general terms, in a 27-line poem preserved in Aris- totle's Constitution of the Athenians. Solon proclaims that he had set free the Black Earth, which is probably a reference to his reform of laws relating to loans on land, as well as to having freed numerous Greeks who were born free but had been taken into bondage. He draws the connection between the laws and justice in these lines: I set them free. By my own power, fitting together force with justice, these things I did, and I came through as I promised. And statutes alike to the base man and to the noble fitting straight justice onto each man's case, these I wrote33 So much here is necessary for prosperity, and for a climate conducive to business. First, a legal judgment ('justice") involved more than a settlement agreed upon through arbitration; some settlements, such as acquiescence to slavery, would now be illegal. Should arbitration fail, "force is fit together with justice," and the decision of the court would be enforced whether the parties agreed or not. The standard for this was in written statutes, which were intended to be applied alike for men both base and noble; these laws were literally carved into stone or wood and became the point of focus for everyone's ethical action. Further, the general principles of justice coded into the written laws were to be applied to particular cases in a way that was straight and not crooked. Bribery, personal favoritism, and influence were - or were at least supposed to be - prohibited, while people got used to living by the laws. (I leave aside the point that the ability of the population to read developed over generations; Solon's laws helped to make reading into a valuable skill.) With such an openly understandable set of laws, people pursuing wealth could now measure their own conduct against these standards. People could also use the ethical standards behind these laws in making many decisions that would never be evalu- ated legally. Magistrates, meanwhile, could use their discretion in resolving the fine points of disputes, but always within the guidelines mandated by the laws. The direct connection between these early Greek laws and the moral outlook of the population pro- vides these laws with a kinship to the written or unwritten code of conduct that helps guide a modern corporation. To this point the focus has been on Solon's political reforms, which established a basic moral and legal framework for individuals to pursue wealth in a social context. In the generation after Solon's re- forms, Athens extended these norms out into the countryside, replacing the wild and wooly norms of rustic life under local strong men who imposed a Mafia-style of justice with the standards of life in a rational polis.34 Solon based his vision of a proper civic order solidly on the intellectual and moral health of the citizens, and it was this foundation that allowed Solon to consider matters of business ethics - in his terms, the proper and just ways of pursuing wealth, with a view to their implications for the future. Wealth Solon's most developed views of wealth have been preserved in his longest extant poem, the 76-line poem 13, also known as "The Hymn to Memory." This prayer to the daughters of Memory asks for "prosperity" and a "good reputation." The reputa- tion he seeks is not universal approval, but rather: To be sweet to my friends, and bitter to my enemies, Respected by one, and a terror to the others In Solon's thought this Greek adage - often stated as helping friends and harming enemies - is accompanied by a desire for wealth that is not unconditional but based on the difference between ill-gotten and justly deserved gains: I want to have money, but to get it unjustly I am not willing; for justice surely comes later. Wealth which the gods give is present to man, steadfast from the deepest foundation to the top, but that which men honor by hubris and comes not with proper order, but persuaded by unjust deeds does not follow willingly, but swiftly mixes with calamity36</page><page sequence="10">132 John David Lewis The basic issue here with respect to ill-gotten wealth is that it has no basis in the divine order, and, consequently, it is followed by inescapable calamity. The divine order is long range and ex- tends to the ends of all things; improperly taken wealth, persuaded by unjust deeds and taken against its nature, is rather ephemeral and transient. Solon claims that justice is inevitable in matters of wealth, as it was in the polis; the consequences of justice cannot be escaped. Justice follows "surely" and "in time" (from poem 4), and the person who "honors wealth by hubris9' and cheats his way to material riches may get loot for the moment, but his short- range view will not last long. "One man gets what he deserves right away, another later; some them- selves/flee ... the innocents pay for the deeds/or their children or their family thereafter."37 The consequences for families are also seen today; a default on a mortgage can put innocent children out of home along with the one taking the loan. How often - then and now - did this occur, be- cause a debtor failed to foresee approaching trou- ble? The principle at stake here - the long-range view versus the seductive results of the moment at hand - could also apply to cases of fraud in our own day. In particular, the pursuit of goodwill, a tangible business asset, cannot be achieved without a long-range business plan, sound understanding of proper ethical standards, and adherence to those standards in practice. In the "Hymn to Memory," Solon explains that the inevitability of justice is like a storm sent by Zeus. This metaphor is not a primitive claim either that Zeus dispenses justice by a will akin to Jehovah's or that natural events (such as earthquakes) follow from human actions; it is a claim rather that there are inevitable consequences to human actions that can be compared to the onset of a storm. Human beings are free to act as they choose, but not free to escape the consequences of their actions - this is the sense in which Solon thinks that justice is natural and inevitable. As the poem continues, Solon observed that immorality is like a fire: "It begins from small start, as a fire" (perhaps just a small accounting gimmick?) but then grows to a general conflagration. "At first it is minor, in the end devastating," Solon says (as the accounting gimmick grows into a crisis). "For the works of hubris do not abide for mortals" (the company's finances collapse).38 The issue at stake here is not minor, either for Solon's fellows or for us today. Solon here embodies "justice" as Zeus, a principle of causation that operates in areas that we have not understood, and that always reflects the fundamental nature of people and events. "Zeus looks upon the end of all things . . ./but not upon each thing/as a mortal man does he become angry." It is the capacity to see to the final consequences of our actions ("the end of all things") that we must strive to achieve. As ignorance was the cause of political upheaval in the polis, so ignorance is the enemy of those pursuing wealth. In the end, a person doing wrong (Solon unabashedly calls him "evil") may try to hide, but his true character will shine forth: "But always whoever is not clear all through, who holds evil/in his heart, in the end surely becomes visible."39 Solon is again expressing, in mythical and anthropomorphic form, the inevi- tability of consequences for those doing evil. We might again think of the attempts by unethical people to hide the nature of their actions, and how, in business most of all, these consequences become catastrophic if not corrected. Again, the conse- quences of such immorality, says Solon, cannot be escaped forever. In our own day, we would do well to distinguish wealth gotten by force or fraud from that which is produced by voluntary, lawful activity. The first is unethical and unjust; the second is good. The first is limited by the capacity to loot; the second is unlimited because human productiveness has no limits. The first brings ruin and the second, prosperity. But what should we do to live the good life, the goal of all later Greek ethical thinkers? Solon had not yet formulated the issue in this way, and his solution therefore takes a specific form. Solon focuses on the need to see the final end - the long-range conse- quences - of our actions. After Solon's own day, this would be extended, by Herodotus, into the idea that one cannot know whether a person is "blessed" until after he is dead - a thought that is not in Solon's own poems. The inherent difficulty in seeing the final consequences - the fact that human beings are not omniscient - reaffirms Solon's view that ethics is essentially an intellectual issue. This is expressed at several places in his poems. In a couplet preserved by a later Christian writer without their wider context, he claims that "it is most difficult to know the</page><page sequence="11">Solon of Athens and the Ethics of Good Business 133 measure of wisdom, which alone holds the end of all things."40 This connects to the thought of Heracli- tus, two generations later, in which wisdom is to "know how all things are steered through all." In his discussion of wealth, Solon tells us similarly: We mortals, both base and noble, think we know [our situations], and each of us expects that things are going well; Until experience hits us41 This focus on the intellect as the only way to determine the final consequences of our actions - and the only means to understand how we should act in order to live a good life - may be Solon's greatest legacy. The brute fact of experience marks the final reckoning of justice, which is the final validation (or repudiation) of our understanding of ourselves and the world. The important point here is that the pursuit of wealth must be honest and ethical, and that an attempt to fake such virtue cannot suc- ceed in the end. Solon is most unclear - or silent - about many issues vital to an ethical theory, but he leaves us the means to discover them; he makes it clear that it is our responsibility to be aware that our actions have consequences. An ethical business per- son is always learning, monitoring his own progress, looking to the long-range effects of a plan, and willing to face the facts of the situation whatever they may be. Solon had earlier said that the citizens of a polis fall into calamity "by ignorance," and the same principle applies to matters of wealth. The wisdom needed for a "career" A term such as "career" is, strictly speaking, inap- plicable to the world of Solon; people had not broken from the inherited strictures of family or the requirements of agricultural sustenance, and eco- nomic activity had not advanced enough for most people to choose a life's work. There were the exceptions - such as Solon himself and some of the newly rich citizens - but most sons of farmers remained farmers, and most family homesteads pas- sed down to heirs. Yet Solon does have an equiva- lent to a "lifestyle," bios, the active way of life needed to "earn a living." Solon leaves an heretofore unprecedented description of the multiple ways that people may pursue wealth and prosperity, in an extended passage that is worth reproduction here: Men pursue wealth in different ways. One fishes in the sea, using ships to bring home profit; battered by the merciless winds, he places no regard upon life. Another man plows the many-treed land for a year, working the curved plow for hire. Another man, having learned the works of Athena and Hephaistos of many crafts, gathers a livelihood with his hands. Another one, taught the gifts of the Olympian Muses, is an expert at the meter of lovely poetic wisdom; King Apollo far-shooter makes another man a seer, he knows the evil coming upon man from afar, if the gods are witnesses. Surely neither augury nor sacred rites can protect against one's allotted fate. Other men, holding the many potions of Paion treat the sick; and there is no certain end to their efforts. Often from a little pain comes a deep disease and he cannot be released from it by gentle reme- dies; Another one, in the grip of a deep debilitating disease, he cures by placing his hands on him Fisherman, farmers, artisans, poets, prophets, doctors - these are the ways of earning a living that Solon saw in his own day. His brilliance lies not in the descriptions of these activities per se - unfortu- nately he leaves us no elaboration - but rather in his ability to see aspects common to all such activities. Each of these tasks involves intense effort, aimed at the achievement of values, and with no guarantees of success. For Solon, this uncertainty threatened to sink into fatalism, and a pessimistic attitude toward our ability to control our direction in life. But rather than seeing man as lacking free will and determined, Solon thinks that our ability to understand the long- range consequences of our actions requires some- thing more than the evidence of our senses. We need reason, the conceptual faculty that Solon is taking the first steps in identifying. The seer here is as important as the farmer; with the help of the gods, he tries to understand those ultimate consequences and to guide us toward long-term prosperity. The physician wants to heal the sick, for instance, although his lack of knowledge makes the results far</page><page sequence="12">134 John David Lewis from certain. Each of these tasks was valuable, and each was paid for by willing buyers - but in each case it is difficult to see to the end of one's efforts. It is not an accident that the artisan, the poet, the seer, and the doctor pursue crafts that the early Greeks thought had come from the gods - for these arts were mysterious to ancient people and involved skills that were not understood. It is precisely the gods, Solon and his fellows believe, who are able to see the implications of the evidence before us and to garner a true understanding of its unseen signifi- cance. The gods are not mystical spirits, but rather figures in human form, projected by human beings, that embody the capacity for expanded knowledge that the Greek sought. It is not too much to say that the single biggest problem the Greeks faced was that of understanding the things they could not see - and that we share this problem. We are ephemeral beings, they said, locked into awareness of the present day, and unable to know the deeper meaning of what we do. This makes it very difficult to know the ultimate results of our actions. This difficulty led some thinkers at the time to reflect that many people act as if they had no minds at all, living for the moment with no thought of the future. The poet Semonides compared this state of ephemeral awareness to that of animals, who munch the grass before their eyes with unthinking abandon: O child, Deep- thundering Zeus holds the end of all things, as it is and which he establishes as he wishes. There is no understanding (nous) in men, but they live upon the day, like cattle, knowing nothing of how the god will bring each thing to an end43 Like Solon, Semonides knew that noos is a human characteristic - but he compares us to cattle in order to illustrate the nature of the problem involved in seeing past the range of the moment. The god Zeus, again, is able to think beyond the limits of perceptual awareness, and to gain conceptual understanding, in a way that is difficult if not impossible for us. Semonides and Solon are not denigrating man by reflecting on his failure to achieve omniscience; they are identifying a problem and expressing it poeti- cally. In modern terms, animals do not write business plans, do not save and allocate capital resources, and do not build food processing plants, precisely be- cause they do not think beyond that which is in front of their eyes. Solon, like Semonides, is dubious about the ability to think out a range of causal consequences to its final state, but he and his fellow Greeks laid out the basic intellectual issue. In busi- ness ethics, the need is not to demand omniscience, but rather to see beyond the particulars of the deal into its broader implications for long-term success. The faculty that makes this possible is reason. The purpose of reason is to guide our actions in an effective, just, and ethical way. Solon's final lesson Solon's dubiousness about our ability to understand the ultimate consequences of our actions begins, in the Hymn to Memory, with his recognition that success is not assured for us. 'There is risk in all actions, and no one knows/how something, having started, will end up."44 We, too, understand that success not assured, even if we think a plan through and do the right thing to implement it. Solon, living in a world that had not yet penetrated into the forces of nature and that had no scientific, medical, or industrial methods, knew that disaster could fall on anyone with blinding speed. He concluded that the human capacity to control fate was seriously limited: One man, attempting to do well but not seeing ahead falls into great and difficult calamity. To another acting badly the god grants good luck in all things, releasing him from his folly45 Even today we do not know if doing the right thing will bring success; the complexities of a market economy (let alone the possibility of accident or disease) can be outside of our personal control. Conversely, it is possible to make a mistake and then to recover; that we are not omniscient does not doom us to failure. In Solon's terms, Moira, the goddess of chance who stands for the unexpected and the unknown, can bring calamity when it is least expected.46 Moira is a term with complex conno- tations. It can stand for "fate" or "destiny" - the ultimate end of our lives that is unknown to us - and the Greek phrase "moira thanatou" refers to one's allotted death. We know this end is coming, but not how or when. Moira also refers to one's "lot" in life: one's general status or condition as renown and</page><page sequence="13">Solon of Athens and the Ethics of Good Business 135 blessed or not, but also one's material circumstances. This is literally the "lot" of land on which one's home is founded, and which was so important to an early Greek farmer and householder, and wTas in many ways outside of his control. In all such matters, the vagaries of chance and circumstance have their influence, which neither the Greeks nor we can totally escape. Solon was not a Pollyanna; he knew that disaster could strike even the best prepared, well-meaning person. For him, blessedness - or happiness, if you will - was forever vulnerable, susceptible to the vagaries of an unforgiving world. There remained no guarantee of success, only a guarantee of failure should one act in a way contrary to the requirements of justice. Solon was more fatalistic than we may be today, since we better understand how to control nature - with no claims to perfection in our actions or omniscience in our understanding - and he had none of the advantages of financial security, medical technology, or industrial production that we enjoy. He had little grasp that these matters could be brought under greater human control. Nevertheless, his concerns for justice, law, and fair dealings remain fundamental to our ability to produce, expand, and maintain such achievements and to our ability to use them for proper ends. Solon's full lesson comes by properly contextu- alizing business activity - the pursuit of wealth - in a civic context, while holding in mind its intellectual foundations in persons of just character. On an individual level, immoral action corrupts our ethical characters and breeds further immorality. On a corporate level, it will inevitably undermine business plan and invite disaster. On the political level, justice means that acting immorally for the sake of gain destroys the rule of law and leaves us with nothing except force in dealing with others. Although we might see someone doing something wrong and not receiving his due, a long-term perspective requires us to act properly, not as a matter of following arbitrary rules, but in order to protect our self- interested security. Proper business ethics establishes the irreplaceable moral context needed for all good dealings and the basis for such moral understanding in a rational process. We may ask whether there is a business theory today that bears parallels to Solon's emphasis on an ethical character, proper understanding, long-range focus, and the attainment of proper ends. We have no evidence that Solon worked out any theory as subtle as what we have today - indeed, for Solon, theoria meant something other than abstract theo- rizing. But the theory of goal setting and task per- formance, developed by Edwin Locke and Gary Latham, is a valuable point of reference. Their the- ory is centrally concerned with reason: "One's mind is the means by which one gains knowledge, ap- praises the value-significance ofthat knowledge, and guides action accordingly."47 This is the first point of intersection with the intellectual focus taken by Solon. But as a goal-directed theory, it asks us to look out to the ends of our actions, both our goals and the inevitable consequences of our actions, in order to determine what those actions should be. The widely different cultural norms that separate the Greeks of Solon's time from us today are yet eval- uated within this basic framework. A further parallel can be found in the basic respect held for the mind as the judge of value-significance. Although the concept "mind" was not well devel- oped in Solon's time, Solon definitely thought there were right and wrong ways to use one's mental faculties - ways just and unjust (adikos). A rational person thinks and acts, in Solon's terms, with a noos that is just. Solon also thought that one must understand more than we might see in the present moment; as Locke and Latham put it, "Human beings have the capacity to go beyond sensory material. They have the capacity for reason."48 This is what Semonides attributed to divine figures, when he considered the ability of the gods to understand more than we - and the cattle - see Semonides' cows have only the experience of their senses, with no faculty to understand that experience. Human beings will live like cows if they do not use their ability to understand the world rationally. Solon demonstrates, in effect, that the immediate picture a person gets of his surroundings - the perceptual level of awareness - is the starting point of understanding, but that grasping the implications we cannot see is a far deeper problem. Solon has no epistemological theory, of course. But one can, however, point to numerous places in his poems where he assumes that what we literally see is how we know, and that understanding that which we cannot see is our most important problem. The only way we can formulate proper goals is to</page><page sequence="14">136 John David Lewis understand more than we can see. Solon knew, in his own way and in his own terms, that only the rational faculty could allow men to develop proper goals and the ethical means to achieve them, even if he saw this capacity as limited. As he sang to his fellows: Of wealth there is no limit revealed to man, for those of us who have the greatest standard of living work twice as hard. Who can be satisfied in every way?49 The need to understand the implications of events becomes even more acute in a social context. Locke further notes, in his writings on leadership, that the way for leaders to influence group performance "would be an appeal to reason based on the perti- nent facts."50 Similarly, when Solon saw his fellows in a social setting, falling for the deceptions of shifty speakers in a public assembly, and making very bad decisions, he identified the reason and the solution: "the ruin of the polis comes from unjust men/and the people fall into slavery by ignorance . . . now it is right to know all things well.51 Aware of how the consequences of intellectual failings are magnified in a group setting, Solon told his fellow Athenians: Each one of you walks in the steps of a fox but all together your mind is empty. You look to the tongue and words of a wily man and fail to see his deeds or the facts52 Solon's seminal importance is not in his specific injunctions or prescriptions; an ethical businessman today, for instance, would gain little by calling upon the gods for inspiration. Solon's importance is in his intellectualism, which focused on the use of the mind, and set a standard for classical Athens that culminated in the intellectual revolution of Socrates the next century and led to the philosophies of Plato and Aristotle. Solon was one of the Seven Sages, and among those credited with the well-known maxim griôtlïë seauton, "Know Yourself," inscribed at a temple at Delphi, a precursor to Socrates' dictum that an "unexamined life is not worth living."53 The overriding lesson that Solon holds for us is the need to think beyond the immediate moment into the consequences that span time and space, to use reason as the only oracle of the true and the good, and to act ethically. We could do worse than to emulate Solon's boast, at the end of his life: I grow old, learning many things54 Notes 1 For instance, Chan (2007) demonstrates the rele- vance of Confucius today; Natoli (2008) discusses the development of a moral conscience in Augustine through the orderliness of numbers. In classical Greece, Aristotle in particular - a prime starting point for ethical studies today - placed great emphasis on Solon as a fig- ure of renown from the Athenian past. Two important, and accessible, studies of popular Greek moral values are Adkins (1972) and Dover (1974). Modern histories of this period: Jeffrey (1976), Murray (1993), Orrieux and Schmitt Pantel (1999), Dunstan (2000), Hall (2007). These are largely syntheses of ancient evidence taken from the preserved fragments the early Greek poets starting with Solon himself, a lit- erary tradition beginning with Herodotus and stretching through Plutarch, as well as archeology. 4 Anhalt (1993) stresses the connections between Solon the politician and Solon the poet; Parker (1995, pp. 43-55) for the calendar. b Stanley (1999) and Woodhouse (1938) adopt eco- nomic approaches to Solon's reforms. 6 Plutarch's works are from Dryden (1992). Herodo- tus Histories is translated by de Sélincourt. Aristotle's Constitution of the Athenians, his treatment of Athens' political history and institutions, is translated with a brief commentary in Moore (1983). Aristotle also dis- cusses Solon at Politics 2.19, and Nicomachaean Ethics 1.10. Plato places Solon into his dialogues, notably with respect to Plato's cosmology, and the (claimed) Egyp- tian derivation of Solon's laws: Plato Timaeus 26d f. See Cooper (1997). A complete translation of Solon's poems may be found in Lewis (2008, pp. 155-162). Solon's poems are cited in this article by fragment number and line, e.g., Solon 4.1-11 as is standard for classical scholarship, using the numberings of West (1998, 11.139-165), followed by Gerber, Greek Elegiac Poetry (1999a, pp. 108-165).
