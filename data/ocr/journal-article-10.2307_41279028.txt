<plain_text><page sequence="1">4 American Children's Literature: Background and Bibliography by Beverly Lyon Clark The central for field or adopted contradiction: of children's by young decisions literature- children about by and/or what which children adolescents- I mean read, literature what is shaped is available written by a for or adopted by young children and/or adolescents- is shaped by a central contradiction: decisions about what children read, what is available for them to read, are made by adults. Virtually none of those who write for children or about children's literature belong to the ostensible audience for that literature. And until the past decade, virtually none of those who have written about children's literature have been literary critics. Yet now children's literature is emerging as a respectable- and exciting- field of literary criticism, thanks in part to the increasing interest in popular culture and the emergence of cultural studies, the study of the interactions between cultural institutions and texts. I am inclined to think that children's literature is at the stage that feminist criticism was some ten to fifteen years ago. In the 1970s and early 1980s there appeared perceptive initial forays into children's literature: Selma Lanes's Down the Rabbit Hole (1971), Roger Sale's Fairy Tales and After (1978), and Humphrey Carpenter's Secret Gardens (1985). To these books have now been added works of literary criticism that grapple with children's literature in the light of recent critical theory. The University of Georgia Press has been leading the way, with volumes like Zohar Shavit's Poetics of Children's Literature (1986) and Perry Nodelman's Words About Pictures (1988). Other prestigious presses have contributed such volumes as Maria Tatar's The Hard Facts of the Grimms' Fairy Tales (Princeton, 1987), Kirsten Drotner's English Children and Their Magazines, 1751-1945 (Yale, 1988), Gillian Avery and Julia Briggs's Children and Their Books (Clarendon- Oxford, 1989), Peter Hunt's Criticism, Theory, and Children's Literature (Blackwell, 1991), and Claudia Nelson's Boys Will Be Girls (Rutgers, 1991). Prestigious presses have also been snatching up or launching journals in the field: Children's American Studies International, April 1992, Vol. XXX, No. 1</page><page sequence="2">5 Literature is now published by Yale University Press and The Lion and the Unicorn by Johns Hopkins University Press. Two recent articles in The Chronicle of Higher Education likewise suggest that the field is gaining credibility: Ellen K. Coughlin's "A Cinderella Story: Research on Children's Books Takes on New Life as a Field of Literary Study"(1991) and my own "Books for Children Deserve to Be Part of Literary Studies" (1990). Children's literature is, further, a particularly useful field for those teaching English as a Second Language because, often, the vocabulary and style are accessible to second-language learners. Children's literature can also serve as an introduction to American culture: cultural values are frequently conveyed with greater directness than in literature addressed to adults. Although criticism of children's literature requires interdisciplinary work- in history, psychology, education, sociology, library studies-I am going to focus on secondary works that take a literary approach, and on book-length works rather than articles (virtually every important article is soon reprinted in this anthology-happy field). To start sketching the shape of the fields of children's literature and of its criticism, I will discuss three rather artificial categories of people who have contributed to this shaping, three categories of adults who speak for the child. Other critics have been inclined to ascribe disagreements among critics to whether a commentator is more a "book person" or a "child person."1 I would like, however, to suggest the influence of cultural institutions in shaping adults' responses to children's literature. I will start by outlining some of the distinctive contributions made variously by librarians, teachers, and professors of literature; then I will discuss topics and modes to which all three groups have contributed. The Librarians Throughout this century, American children's literature, especially in its more highbrow forms, has been dominated by librarians- or, more precisely, by a Beverly Lyon Clark teaches English at Wheaton College in Norton, Massachusetts. She is the author of Talking about Writing: A Guide for Tutor and Teacher Conferences and Lewis Carroll, and she edited a reprinting of Evelyn Sharp's The Making of a Schoolgirl. Her current interests include children's literature and feminist theory; she is working on a book on crossgendered school stories. American Studies International, April 1992, Vol. XXX, No.l</page><page sequence="3">6 loose grouping comprised mostly of librarians but also including publishers, editors, booksellers, teachers, trainers of teachers, and trainers of librarians (some individuals have in fact slipped from one such profession to another). Even now, librarians are responsible for some eighty-five percent of children's book purchases,2 so it is not surprising that librarians have shaped the field. They have done so not just with their purchasing power but with their characteristic activities of reviewing and judging. Ever since 1882, when Caroline Hewins published her first list of books recommended for children, American librarians have been compiling influential lists of what children should or should not read. Nevertheless, despite the scores of bibliographies that librarians have produced, there is still no comprehensive bibliography of primary and secondary works in American children's literature. The closest approach to the latter is Virginia Haviland's Children's Literature: A Guide to Reference Sources (1966) and its supplements (1972, 1977). As for bibliographies of primary works, iyAltÂ£ A. Welch's monumental Bibliography of American Children's Books Printed Prior to 1821 (1963) is a comprehensive listing of the earliest such sources. Other bibliographies and indexes of primary sources tend, on the one hand, to focus on such subgroups as fantasy literature, bestsellers, the black experience, or books about single-parent families, or to offer perhaps a subject index to poetry (need a poem tomorrow about a rhinoceros?). On the other hand, some published bibliographies catalogue the holdings of a particular collection. The most important of these include A.S.W. Rosenbach's Early American Children's Books (1933), Jacob Blanck's Peter Parley to Penrod: A Bibliographical Description of the Best-Loved American Juvenile Books (1938), the Pierpont Morgan Library's Early Children's Books and Their Illustration (1975), and Judith St. John's two-volume catalogue of the primarily British holdings of The Osborne Collection of Early Children's Books 1566-1910: A Catalogue (1958, 1975) in Toronto. Increasingly, however, the best place to turn for bibliographies of primary works is computerized lists such as RLIN (Research Libraries Information Network), on which the extensive pre-1876 holdings of the American Antiquarian Society (in Worcester, Massachusetts) are now catalogued. The bibliographical impulse of judging merit is likewise echoed in the other main arenas where librarians have been active. One such arena is the reviewing of books- and often the choosing of which books to review-in both newspapers and such journals as the influential Horn Book Magazine (started in 1924 by a bookseller). Another arena is the awarding of medals: the Newbery Medal, starting in 1922, is awarded each year by the American Library Association for outstanding writing; the Caldecott Medal, starting in 1938, for outstanding illustration. These medals not only constitute the most prestigious prizes for American children's literature but guarantee tens of thousands of sales, since any self-respecting American library that caters to children will be sure to get the medal winners that year, no matter how tight its budget is otherwise. No national award for adults' literature has anything like a similar impact. Reinforcing the prominence of librarians in the field of children's literature is a secondary industry that has grown up in connection with their awards. American Studies International, April 1992, Vol. XXX, No. 1</page><page sequence="4">7 Volumes have been devoted to the medalists' acceptance speeches, accompanied perhaps by a brief biographical commentary: to wit, Bertha Mahony Miller and Elinor Whitney Field's Newbery Medal Books: 1922-1955 (1955) and Caldecott Medal Books: 1938-1957 (19 57); and Lee Kingman's Newbery and Caldecott Medal Books: 1956-1965 (1965), Newbery and Caldecott Medal Books , 1966-1975 (1975), and Newbery and Caldecott Medal Books , 1976-1985 (1986). Another volume, Irene Smith's A History of the Newbery and Caldecott Medals (1957), recounts the process whereby the medalists are chosen. In addition, anyone seeking a workable sample of "quality" children's literature is likely to turn to the awarding-winning books. You seek to provide a text on art appreciation for adults working with children? Then like Lyn Ellen Lacy, in Art and Design in Children's Picture Books: An Analysis of Caldecott Award-Winning Illustrations (1986), you might catalogue the formal elements of art and design in some readily-available Caldecott winners. Or you're a social scientist seeking to document social influences on children? Then you will turn for at least part of your sample to the Newbery and/or Caldecott Medal winners, as Lenore Weitzman and her coauthors did in what is probably the finest article of this sort, "Sex Role Socialization in Picture Books for Pre-School Children" (1972) (an article that, curiously, seems to have been reprinted only in one or two anthologies devoted to examining sexism). Librarians are also responsible for numerous anthologies of critical response and appreciation. Among early collections of criticism, the two best and most influential were in fact compiled by librarians: Only Connect: Readings on Children's Literature (1969, rev. 1980), edited by Sheila Egoff, et al.; and Children and Literature: Views and Reviews (1973), edited by Virginia Haviland. The former places somewhat more emphasis on historical aspects, the latter on the relationship between child and book. Such all-purpose anthologies generally have something on fantasy or fairy tales, something on picture books, something on poetry, maybe something on non-fiction, or censorship, or bibliotherapy (using books as therapy to help children deal with divorce or death or other disaster), and, if the volume is recent, something on fiction for young adults. Other collections geared to the concerns of American librarians include Evelyn Rose Robinson's Readings about Children's Literature (1966), Sara Innis Fenwick's A Critical Approach to Children's Literature (196 7), Zena Sutherland's The Arbuthnot Lectures 1970-1979 (1980), Winifred Ragsdale's A Sea of Upturned Faces: Proceedings of the Third Pacific Rim Conference on Children's Literature (1989), and the Association for Library Service to Children's The Arbuthnot Lectures 1980-1989 (1990). Similarly, though his focus is on Britain, Nicholas Tucker's Suitable for Children? Controversies in Children's Literature (1976) offers a lively collection of essays on controversies of particular interest to librarians- on the desirability of fairy tales and comics, on Little Black Sambo, on the value of children's literature generally. When librarians' collections do not emphasize controversial issues, they are likely to emphasize the personalities of authors and illustrators. It is as if, in their desire to get children to read, the compilers want to stress that "books are by people"- to quote the title of Lee Bennett Hopkins' 1969 collection of brief American Studies International, April 1992, Vol XXX, No.l</page><page sequence="5">8 accounts of "interviews with 104 authors and illustrators of books for young children." Other books of interviews include Justin Wintle and Emma Fisher's The Pied Pipers: Interviews with the Influential Creators of Children's Literature (1974) and, in effect, Jonathan Cotfs Pipers at the Gates of Dawn: The Wisdom of Children's Literature (1983); a similar impulse motivates Miriam Hoffman and Eva Samuels in Authors and Illustrators of Children's Books: Writings on Their Lives and Works (1972), which reprints brief biographical appreciations of some fifty practitioners. Even more often, volumes edited by librarians- or by people with similar interests-collect not interviews but essays, miscellaneous essays by miscellaneous authors and illustrators. These anthologies often recycle the same or similar essays, such as Susan Cooper on fantasy, Virginia Haviland's interview with Maurice Sendak, and, among British practitioners, C.S. Lewis on ways of writing for children and J.R.R. Tolkien on fairy tales. Betsy Hearne and Marilyn Kaye's Celebrating Children's Books: Essays on Children's Literature in Honor of Zena Sutherland (1981) features essays by such authors as Lloyd Alexander, Paula Fox, and Virginia Hamilton, together with representatives from editing, reviewing, teaching, and library work. William Zinsser's Worlds of Childhood: The Art and Craft of Writing for Children (1990) is comprised of transcribed talks by six writers for children, including Katherine Paterson, Jack Prelutsky, and Jean Fritz, at the New York Public Library. Barbara Harrison and Gregory Maguire's Innocence and Experience: Essays and Conversations on Children's Literature (1987), with more than eighty contributors, features work by American practitioners, talking at Simmons College on such topics as the uses of memory and myth, the nature of fantasy and realism, illustrations, poetry; the final section is devoted to the many audiences for children's literature, addressing cleavages created by age, profession, and race and ethnicity. The proceedings of a subsequent conference organized by many of the same people appear in Travelers in Time: Past , Present , and to Come (1990). In That Eager Zest: First Discoveries in the Magic World of Books (1961), Frances Walsh has assembled a collection of established writers' reflections on early experiences with books; Phyllis Fenner's Something Shared: Children and Books (1959) has a similar premise. In The Voice of the Narrator in Children's Literature: Insights from Writers and Critics (1989), Charlotte Otten and Gary D. Schmidt place "authorial" and "critical" voices side by side. Sometimes, too, librarians showcase the work of academic researchers: James H. Fraser's Society &amp; Children's Literature (1978) and Selma K. Richardson's Research About Nineteenth-Century Children and Books: Portrait Studies (1980) include essays addressing not only matters of bibliography and preservation but also social history and literary criticism. Certainly some librarians have been much more willing to acknowledge the work of academic researchers than academic researchers have been to acknowledge that of librarians. Still another kind of anthology is one that reprints essays from a single journal. The leading professional journals for American children's librarians are the Journal of Youth Services in Libraries (formerly Top of the News) and the School Library Journal The Horn Book Magazine also addresses librarians' interests, interspersing reviews of children's books with essays mostly by authors and American Studies International, April 1992, Vol. XXX, No. 1</page><page sequence="6">9 illustrators. Lillian Gerhardfs Issues in Children's Book Selection: A School Library Journal/Library Journal Anthology (1973) reprints articles on such topics as censorship, racism, sexism, the environment, sexuality, science fiction, and young adult literature. Three general collections of articles from The Horn Book Magazine are Norma R. Fryatt's A Horn Book Sampler: On Children's Books and Reading (1959), Elinor Whitney Field's Horn Book Reflections: On Children's Books and Reading (1969) and Paul Heins's Crosscurrents of Criticism: Horn Book Essays 1968-1977 (1977). More specialized is Lee Kingman's The Illustrator's Notebook (1978), which excerpts Horn Book pieces on artists and techniques of illustration. Finally, librarians are notably partial to reference tools, and many important ones besides bibliographies have appeared. I will not enumerate the many dictionaries of practitioners, characters, and plots, but I will note several important tools. The most indispensable tool for literary research-even though more complete for British than for American literature- is The Oxford Companion to Children's Literature (1984), compiled by Humphrey Carpenter and Mari Prichard. In addition, several reference volumes include extended biographical- cum-analytic essays about each author or illustrator: Jane M. Bingham's Writers for Children: Critical Studies of Major Authors Since the Seventeenth Century (1988); and four volumes of the Dictionary of Literary Biography- John Cech's American Writers for Children , 1900-1960 (1983), Glenn E. Estes' American Writers for Children Before 1900 (1985), his American Writers for Children Since 1960: Fiction (1986), and his American Writers for Children Since 1960: Poets , Illustrators, and Nonfiction Authors (1987). The Teachers The second category, the most arbitrary because of the way it overlaps with the other two, is that of the teachers. Here I have assigned the advice manual, a near relative of the librarians' book list. The advice manual is hardly the province of teachers alone, but its emphasis on the importance of education makes it particularly congenial to their concerns. Often journalistic, the advice manual characteristically starts with a few statistics about declining reading skills, then shifts into a pep talk urging parents to read more to their children, and ends with an annotated bibliography of children's literature- frequently accompanied by photographs of parents reading to their children. One that has received a good deal of publicity is Jim Trelease's The New Read- Aloud Handbook, as it is now called (1982, 3rd ed. 1989). Yet this book is simply one in a long line that includes Nancy Larrick's A Parent's Guide to Children's Reading (1958, 5th ed. 1982); a volume prepared by the National Council of Teachers of English, Linda Leonard Lamme's Raising Readers: A Guide to Sharing Literature with Young Children (1980); and Eden Ross Lipson's The New York Times Parent's Guide to the Best Books for Children (1988, rev. 1991), a volume in which the bibliography dominates. Handbooks aimed more at teachers include Daniel Fader's The New Hooked on Books (1976), a recasting of his earlier Hooked on Books (1966) and Hooked on Books: American Studies International, April 1992, Vol XXX, No.l</page><page sequence="7">10 Program and Proof (1968); and the British Aidan Chambers' The Reluctant Reader (1969) and Introducing Books to Children (1973). Even more clearly in the domain of the teachers is the textbook on children's literature. Such volumes constitute an important force in shaping the field, in particular shaping the understanding of future teachers and librarians. I will limit my discussion to three. The most influential text has been May Hill Arbuthnot/ s Children and Books, first published in 1947 and currently in its eighth edition (1991), revised by Zena Sutherland, who is now listed as the first author. Like most texts addressing children's literature, whether focusing on literature for young children or for young adults, it is primarily organized by genres (folk tales, fantasy, poetry, historical fiction, biography), devoting the most space to brief recapitulations of books deemed important; it also, typically, includes some discussion of the history of children's literature and of the psychological development of children, as well as a chapter or two on how to approach literature with children, and topical discussions of such issues as censorship. An example of a textbook with an alternative emphasis, one that organizes the discussion according to issues-in this case family, sex, gender role, heritage, special needs, old age, death, and war- is Masha Kabakow Rudman's Children's Literature: An Issues Approach (1976, rev. 1984). Finally, one recently-released textbook makes valuable contributions to literary criticism: Perry Nodelman still uses genres as an organizing strategy in The Pleasures of Children's Literature (1992), but he also reads children's literature in the light of recent critical theory. There is likewise an entire industry of books devoted to how to approach children's literature in the classroom. Those of more general interest include Pamela Petrick Barron and Jennifer Q. Burley's Jump Over the Moon : Selected Professional Readings (1984) and Janet Hickman and Bernice E. Cullinan's Children's Literature in the Classroom: Weaving Charlotte's Web (1989). Kay E. Vandergrift has worked at bridging theory and pedagogy: Child and Story: The Literary Connection (1986) engages with traditional approaches to literary theory, such as the old New Criticism; Children's Literature: Theory , Research, and Teaching (1990) admixes some discussion of structuralist, reader-response, and early feminist approaches, together with sample syllabi and worksheets. Key journals addressed to teachers include Language Arts (formerly Elementary English, and before that Elementary English Review), the English Journal (directed to middle- and high-school teachers), and Children's Literature in Education. Articles from Children's Literature in Education have been collected by Geoff Fox and several coeditors in Writers, Critics, and Children: Articles from Children's Literature in Education (1976). The Critics Children's literature as a professional field, then, starts with librarians, who have greatly influenced the shaping of the literature now available to children and the way in which adults talk about it. Yet my interests are not primarily American Studies International, April 1992, Vol. XXX, No. 1</page><page sequence="8">11 those of a librarian but those of a literary critic, and the rest of my essay will show that bias. What excites me is how the field of literary criticism is opening up-how it is increasingly possible to do literary criticism in children's litera- ture-despite the low status still accorded anything associated with children, even among those who profess cultural studies. The privileged trinity of shibboleths- race, class, and gender- has still not been joined by age. Most literary critics, in fact, treat children's literature as if it is a communicable disease. In Growing up Female: Adolescent Girlhood in American Fiction (1985), Barbara A. White claims to have excluded juvenile fiction in order to place some limits on her material, yet she still goes on to discuss Little Women , Rebecca of SunnybrookFarm, and the Elsie Dinsmore series, all of which were originally intended as, marketed as, and perceived as stories for girls. In Sensational Designs: The Cultural Work of American Fiction 1790-1860 (1985), Jane Tompkins wants to redeem many of the works she focuses on- Uncle Tom's Cabin, The Wide , Wide World, and The Last of the Mohicans -from obscurity, from, in particular, having "come to be thought of as more fit for children than for adults."3 In other words, as interest in popular culture takes off, as cultural studies gains respectability and even urgency, it is hard for a critic like Tompkins to avoid children's literature; but to enhance the respectability of her venture, she then wants to cast off the children's-literature label. Both White and Tompkins are, in effect, what I call closet juvenilists. Yet a number of literary critics have emerged from the closet, beginning with Francelia Butler, who launched the journal Children's Literature in 1972, a journal published by the Division on Children's Literature of the Modern Language Association. She was also instrumental in organizing the Children's Literature Association, the other main American professional organization for critics of children's literature and the publisher of the Children's Literature Association Quarterly. Two other journals that address the interests of critics are the British Signal and the American-based The Lion and the Unicorn. Early in the 1980s the Children's Literature Association attempted to construct a "canon" of children's literature-a countermove, in effect, to the librarians' ad hoc canon of Newbery and Caldecott Medalists. Although the Association's effort is not without controversy- with respect both to omissions and to the more theoretical issue of whether one can create a canon by fiat- it does embody an attempt to address the concerns of literary critics. This effort also benefits from more hindsight than the librarians' annual venture can (who now remembers Secret of the Andes, which won the Newbery Medal in 1953, beating out Charlotte's Web?). The critics' "canon" too, like the librarians' medal winners, is reinforced by book-length publications. The three volumes of Perry Nodelman's Touchstones: Reflections on the Best in Children's Literature (1985, 1987, 1989) are devoted to articles on works named in the canon, articles that contribute to the canon project while also offering perceptive comments on the individual works. The first volume, devoted to fiction, includes essays on such works as Little Women, Tom Sawyer, Charlotte's Web, and Harriet the Spy', the second, on collections of folk tales, myth, and poetry; the third, on such picture books as Millions of Cats, The Snowy Day, Swimmy, and Where the Wild Things Are, together with essays taking issue American Studies International, April 1992, Vol. XXX, No.l</page><page sequence="9">12 with the "canon" as originally formulated. Like the librarians and teachers, the critics are fond of publishing collections of essays. The most comprehensive is Robert Bator's Signposts to Criticism of Children's Literature (1983), which includes theoretical pieces by critics (such as Felicity Hughes and Peter Hunt), reflections by authors (such as Isaac Bashevis Singer and Susan Cooper), a sampling of nineteenth-century criticism, and discussions of fantasy, fairy tales, science fiction, picture books, poetry, historical fiction, and young adult novels. Within a smaller compass, Peter Hunt gathers theoretical pieces by British and Commonwealth critics in Children's Literature : The Development of Criticism (1990). Other useful collections include several associated with the Children's Literature Association or with the journal Children's Literature. Jill P. May's Children and Their Literature: A Readings Book (1983), the first book-length publication of the Association, includes articles addressing fairy tales, realistic fiction, illustrations, non-fiction, and teaching. Patricia Dooley's The First Steps: Articles and Columns from the ChLA Newsletter/Quarterly, Volume 1-IV (1984) clusters articles on such topics as science fiction, poetry, realism, child readers, theory, folklore, and illustration. Some of the Association's conference proceedings have been published in the Children's Literature Association Quarterly, others include Susan R. Gannon and Ruth Anne Thompson's Cross-Culturalism in Children's Literature (1989) and The Child and the Family (1990). Francelia Butler and Richard Rotert7 s Reflections on Literature for Children (1984), on the other hand, reprints articles published in the annual Children's Literature; these articles variously address Raggedy Ann, Oz, E.B. White, T.S. Eliot, jump rope rhymes, storytelling, and Maurice Sendak. Of related interest is a collection of previously unpublished articles gathered by the same editors, in Triumphs of the Spirit in Children's Literature (1986). The emphasis on uplift here seems to have constrained some of the contributors, but they do offer insights into, for instance, Hawaiian and Mormon children's literature and also Holocaust and Depression-era fiction. A similar focus on values informs Joseph O'Beirne Milner and Lucy Floyd Morcock Milner's Webs and Wardrobes: Humanist and Religious World Views in Children's Literature (19 87), which attempts to put the two traditions cited in the title in dialogue. Congruent with the research interests of academic critics is Opening Texts: Psychoanalysis and the Culture of the Child (1985), edited by Joseph H. Smith and William Kerrigan: this volume is primarily devoted to children's literature, with discussions of lullabies, fairy tales, eighteenth-century school stories, and twentieth-century domestic fiction. As for bibliographies, the most comprehensive and useful listing, from the perspective of the literary critic, is Linnea Hendrickson's Children's Literature: A Guide to the Criticism (1987); an updating is currently in progress. Bibliographies of recent criticism appear periodically in the Children's Literature Association Quarterly (1983, 1989, 1991). American Studies International , April 1992, Vol . XXX, No. 1</page><page sequence="10">13 Recent Theoretical Approaches Within the past decade, especially within the past five years, literary critics have made exciting advances in applying literary theory to children's literature, and vice versa. Of course all approaches to literature are necessarily informed by theory, even if only covertly, yet a number of works are particularly attentive to recent theoretical developments. The works that I address here are hardly the only ones informed by theoretical perspectives, but this sampling includes important works with implications for the field of children's literature as a whole (not all of them focus on American children's literature). In many ways the best contemporary theorizing about children's literature is still Jacqueline Rose's The Case of Peter Pan or The Impossibility of Children's Fiction (1984), informed as it is by deconstructive, feminist, Marxist, and especially psychoanalytic theory. Although the texts that Rose discusses are almost all British, the questions she raises are urgent for anyone studying children's literature: what to make of the necessary rupture, in children's literature, between the writer and the audience; how adults construct childhood through children's literature; how children's literature brings together two concepts of origin, that of language and that of childhood, such that writing for/of one regulates our relationship with the other; and how children's literature and concepts of childhood are linked with colonialism. Two critics who have done important work grappling with Marxist approaches are Jack Zipes and Ariel Dorfman. In Breaking the Magic Spell: Radical Theories of Folk and Fairy Tales (1979) and Fairy Tales and the Art of Subversion: The Classical Genre for Children and the Process of Civilization (1983), Zipes places fairy tales in social and historical context and examines their uses in indoctrinating children. In The Empire's Old Clothes: What the Lone Ranger , Babar, and Other Innocent Heroes Do to Our Minds (1983), Dorfman argues that children's literature, especially that featuring such popular figures as Babar and Donald Duck, provides the basis for global cultural domination, a latterday imperialism. A couple of works are particularly informed by recent work in semiotics. Perry Nodelman's Words about Pictures: The Narrative Art of Children's Picture Books (1988) provides a superb initiation into the art of "reading" pictures in British and American children's books, with detailed attention to the work of such artists as Sendak and Chris Van Allsburg. Nodelman discusses, among other things, the ways text and picture interact, the implications of framing, the uses of color, and the creation of irony. On the other hand, Zohar Shavit's Poetics of Children's Literature (1986) is more concerned with texts than with pictures. Shavit focuses on the double audience for children's literature, addressing how it has had to appeal, because of its doubtful status, to both children and adults. Linda K. Christian-Smith's Becoming a Woman through Romance (1990) illustrates the potential of cultural studies for illuminating children's literature, especially popular children's literature. Her examination of teen romance novels, their historical and economic contexts, together with a sampling of the responses of some teen readers, shows how the books can both induce conformity to American Studies International , April 1992, Vol . XXX, No.l</page><page sequence="11">14 stereotyped images of femininity and also foster oppositional practices. Similarly suggestive is Roberta E. Pearson and William Uricchio's The Many Lives of the Batman: Critical Approaches to a Superhero and his Media (1991). Another promising direction is a reader-response approach- indeed it is a vital direction, given the necessary disjunction between literary critics and the ostensible audience of children's books. It is also the approach that has received the most attention so far. Many of the above critics attend to the readers; Christian-Smith, in fact, interviews teenage readers. Early volumes informed by a reader-response approach include Margaret Meek et al/s The Cool Web: The Pattern of Children's Reading (19 77) and Geoff Fox et al/s Responses to Children's Literature (1980). Aidan Chambers reprints some of his work on reader response in Booktalk: Occasional Writing on Literature and Children (1985). Peter Hunt addresses the possibility of what he calls childist criticism, what it means to read as a child, in Criticism , Theory, and Children's Literature (1991). Related work that takes more of a social science approach to reader response, through case study and ethnography, includes Dorothy White's Books Before Five (1954), Dorothy Butler's Cushla and Her Books (1979), Maureen Crago and Hugh Crago's Prelude to Literacy : A Preschool Child's Encounter with Picture and Story (1983), and Marilyn Cochran-Smith's ethnography of a nursery school, The Making of a Reader (1984). Other works by psychologists, who seem to have been less disdainful of children than literary critics have, is helpful as well, including Arthur N. Applebee's The Child's Concept of Story: Ages Two to Seventeen (1978), Nicholas Tucker's The Child and the Book: A Psychological and Literary Exploration (1981), and J.A. Appleyard's Becoming a Reader: The Experience of Fiction from Childhood to Adulthood (1990). More traditional in its theoretical stance, but innovative in the ways it connects literature for children and literature for adults, is Juliet Dusinberre's Alice to the Lighthouse: Children's Books and Radical Experiments in Art (1987). Countering the common assumption that children's literature adopts the modes and styles that adults have cast off, Dusinberre argues that children's literature provides an arena for experimentation that can influence the adult avant-garde. Historical Approaches The librarian, the teacher, and the critic (not to mention the historian) have all been concerned with the history and the historical contexts of children's literature, yet most work on the history of children's literature- or on other aspects of children's literature- still focuses on British traditions more than American ones. Many of these works- by such authors as Gillian Avery, Samuel F. Pickering, Jr., and Geoffrey Summerfield- are concerned exclusively, or almost exclusively, with British children's literature. Emblematic of the tendency is Humphrey Carpenter, who devotes a single chapter of Secret Gardens: A Study of the Golden Age of Children's Literature (1985) to an American author (Louisa May Alcott) and none, despite the allusion in the title, to Frances Hodgson Burnett, who lived much of her life in the U.S. and is often claimed by Americans. American Studies International, April 1992, Vol. XXX, No. 1</page><page sequence="12">15 The classic overview of the history of British children's literature, an overview that makes some reference to American literature, is F.J. Harvey Darton's Children's Books in England: Five Centures of Social Life, first published in 1932, the third edition revised by Brian Alderson (1982). Also discussing American children's literature- in the revised editions- is John Rowe Townsend's Written for Children: An Outline of English-Language Children's Literature (1965, 3rd ed. 1988). Some other general works are likewise reasonably balanced with respect to nationality: these include Cornelia L. Meigs's A Critical History of Children's Literature: A Survey of Children's Books in English (1953, rev. 1969); William Sloane's Children's Books in England and America in the Seventeenth Century (1955); Joyce Irene Whalley's Cobwebs to Catch Flies: Illustrated Books for the Nursery and Schoolroom 1700-1900 (1975); Ruth K. MacDonald's Literature for Children in England and America from 1646 to 1774 (1982); William T. Moynihan and Mary E. Shane^s The Twentieth Century, volume 8 of Masterworks of Children's Literature (1986); and Charles Frey and John Griffith's The Literary Heritage of Childhood: An Appraisal of Children's Classics in the Western Tradition (1987), which is essentially a companion piece to their textbook anthology of children's literature. More specialized histories abound as well. For those interested in a history of children's literature from the perspective of the book collector- that is, with comments on the rarity and current value of various editions- there is Eric Quayle's The Collector's Book of Children's Books (1971), which discusses some American works. A similar perspective animates William Targ's collection, Bibliophile in the Nursery: A Bookman's Treasury of Collectors' Lore on Old and Rare Children's Books (1957), which combines appreciations of children's literature with accounts of book collecting. As for histories specifically of American children's literature, there is still no comprehensive survey (at least until Gillian Avery completes hers). The librarians, as I have noted, have been especially enamored of bibliographies; even their early historical surveys of American children's literature have tended to be annotated bibliographies in paragraph form. At its worst this early work simply catalogues titles or seems to aim for typology for the sake of typology. Such volumes may be useful to a librarian choosing books for a collection, but they are not always informed by a sense of the larger whole. At their best, though, these historical surveys were the best. They laid important groundwork and offered sensitive appreciations. Thus one of the best general works on nineteenth-century American children's literature is still Alice M. Jordan's From Rollo to Tom Sawyer and Other Papers (1948). This anecdotal account rarely devotes more than a paragraph to a given work, yet Jordan gives a good sense of the reading matter that nineteenth- century middle-class children were likely to encounter, from Peter Parley to Susan Warner, including what they would read in such magazines as Our Young Folks and St. Nicholas. Similarly, the best overview of late- twentieth-century developments is Sheila A. Egoff's Thursday's Child: Trends and Patterns in Contemporary Children's Literature (1981). Nevertheless, the best general overviews of the full range of American children's literature are chapters rather than books, American Studies International, April 1992, Vol. XXX, No.l</page><page sequence="13">16 and are by critics rather than librarians, in particular, the chapters by Elizabeth A. Francis and Sally Allen McNall in Joseph M. Hawes and N. Ray Miner's American Childhood: A Research Guide and Historical Handbook (1985). Other useful historical surveys include Virginia Haviland's The Travelogue Storybook of the Nineteenth Century (1950), a guided tour of the nineteenth-century American phenomenon named in the title, as practiced by such writers as Parley, Jacob Abbott, and Hezekiah Butterworth. Siri Andrews' collection The Hezvins Lectures 1947-1962 (1963) addresses the backgrounds of such authors as Abbott, Laura Richards, Lucretia Hale, and Susan Coolidge (and reprints Haviland's essay on the travelogue). Dora V. Smith's Fifty Years of Children's Books 1910-1960: Trends, Backgrounds , Influences (1963) provides an overview of early twentieth-century American children's literature and is valuable for its discussion of historical contexts, though at times it slips into the mode of the annotated bibliography. Lillian H. Smith surveys genres in The Unreluctant Years: A Critical Approach to Children's Literature (1953). Nellie McCaslin lists production groups and outlines the history of twentieth-century children's theater in Theatre for Children in the United States (1971). More scholarly historical approaches include Anne Scott MacLeod's A Moral Tale: Children's Fiction and American Culture 1820-1860 (1975), which examines the values purveyed by literature immediately preceding classic nineteenth-century works (e.g., Little Women) and is noteworthy for the sensitivity with which it explores the interplay between social forces and literature. R. Gordon Kelly similarly examines the ideals of gentility purveyed in late-nineteenth century magazines for children, in Mother Was a Lady: Self and Society in Selected American Children's Periodicals , 1865-1890 (1974). Ruth K. MacDonald's Christian's Children: The Influence of John Bunyan's The Pilgrim's Progress on American Children's Literature (1989) is good at outlining nineteenth-century religious contexts and also addresses specific works that have been influenced by or allude to Pilgrim's Progess. Mary Cadogan and Patricia Craig provide a chronicle of nearly a century and a half of stories for girls, both British and American, both highbrow and low, in You're a Brick, Angela! The Girls' Story 1839-1985 (1976, rev. 1986). As for picture books, the most comprehensive history is Barbara Bader's American Picture Books from Noah's Ark to the Beast Within (1976). This intelligent, well-illustrated account provides information about twentieth-century publishing, international influences, and the Golden Books phenomenon; it also pays close attention to such artists as Wanda Gag, Roger Duvoisin, Jean Chariot, Marcia Brown, Dr. Seuss, Crockett Johnson, and Maurice Sendak. Most other surveys of picture books (especially, it seems, if they contain the word "treasury" in the title) focus more on reproducing the art than on analyzing it. Better than most of these, because of its historical discussion and its telling juxtapositions of illustrations, is William Feaver's When We Were Young: Two Centuries of Children's Book Illustration (19 77). Other works are not so much histories of literature as social histories that draw on the literature; but somewhere between the two, written before those categories were clearly differentiated, is Rosalie V. Halsey's Forgotten Books of the American Studies International, April 1992, Vol XXX, No. 1</page><page sequence="14">17 American Nursery: A History of the Development of the American Story-Book (1911). To get a sense of the daily life of the child, Halsey examines publishers and writers, British imports, later British responses to American works, and accounts of what individual children were reading in the eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries. By and large, the field of history, like that of psychology, has been more receptive to the study of children and their literature than literary criticism has. Social and intellectual histories that discuss children often use children's literature as a source; they also provide some historical background that can inform other studies of children's literature. The classic study in the history of childhood is Philippe Aries' Centuries of Childhood: A Social History of Family Life (1962), which focuses on France. Bernard Wishy's The Child and the Republic: The Dawn of Modern American Child Culture (1968) has an American focus and devotes several chapters to the literature that children were reading in various eras of history. Other informative historical studies include Rites of Passage: Adolescence in America, 1790 to the Present (1977), by Joseph F. Kett; A Century of Childhood 182J0-192J0 (1984), an exhibit catalogue by Mary Lynn Stevens Heininger et al.; and American Childhood: A Research Guide and Historical Handbook (1985), edited by Joseph M. Hawes and N. Ray Hiner. Other historians and social scientists who shed light on children's literature include Monica Kiefer, who uses books written for children, especially instructional books, to gain insight into the manners and morals of historical children, in American Children through their Books 1700-1835 (1948). In From Dr. Seuss to Dr. Mather: 200 Years of American Books for Children (1980), Mary Lystad undertakes a content analysis of a sampling of American children's books to gauge changes in social values, noting, for example, how attention to the family peaked in such books in the late nineteenth century, when the appearance of minority characters likewise peaked. Her subsequent At Home in America as Seen Through its Books for Children (1984) details a content analysis addressing changes in the ideal family. A good source on nineteenth-century publishing and especially nineteenth-century reviewing is Richard L. Darling's The Rise of Children's Book Reviewing in America, 1865-1881 (1968). R. Gordon Kelly's Children's Periodicals of the United States (1984), though effectively a bibliography, offers analyses as well as descriptions of an insufficiently -studied phenomenon: the pervasive and influential journals for children. Issues, Themes, and Genres Librarians have generally shown a preference for issues over genres, among them the issue of censorship, which had become particularly acute by the late 1970s. The numerous volumes discussing censorship include Lee Burress' Battle of the Books: Literary Censorship in the Public Schools, 1950-1985 (1989), which provides a good overview of the issues, including the subtle self-censoring to which publishers and other purveyors of books may succumb, and how pressure American Studies International, April 1992, Vol. XXX, No.l</page><page sequence="15">18 may come from either the political Right or the political Left. Mark I. West's Trust Your Children: Voices against Censorship in Children's Literature (1988) tackles censorship, in particular that coming from the Right, by providing interviews with authors, publishers, and activists. At the same time librarians have been to the fore in exploring racism and sexism. In addition to the inevitable bibliographies of books recommended and otherwise, including several listings prepared by the Council on Interracial Books for Children, a number of volumes have focused on race or gender, especially the former. The book that has drawn the most fire for being racist (one written by a Scot rather than an American) is Little Black Sambo. Phyllis J. Yuill explores the history of the controversy in Little Black Sambo: A Closer Look (1976). More generally, Donnarae MacCann and Gloria Woodard's The Black American in Books for Children : Readings in Racism (1972) reprints articles exposing racism in works like Sounder and The Story of Dr. Dolittle and in the publishing industry generally. Dorothy M. Broderick recounts the relentless stereotyping of blacks in children's literature between 1827 and 1967 in Image of the Block in Children's Fiction (1973). In Shadow &amp; Substance: Afro-American Experience in Contemporary Children's Fiction (1982), Rudine Sims chronicles results from 1965 through 1979 and charts the emergence of a culturally conscious fiction. Dianne Johnson goes on to explore the traditions of children's literature written by African-Americans since 1920, most of it what Sims would call culturally conscious, in Telling Tales: The Pedagogy and Promise of African American Literature for Youth (1990). Donnarae MacCann and Gloria Woodard's Cultural Conformity in Books for Children: Further Readings in Racism (19 77) addresses the stereotyping of several different races and ethnic groups, as does Betty Bacon's How Much Truth Do We Tell the Children? The Politics of Children's Literature (1988). Arlene B. Hirschfelder's American Indian Stereotypes in the World of Children: A Reader and Bibliography addresses the stereotyping of Native Americans in children's literature and in the culture at large. Sexism in children's literature has received less book-length attention; books that deal with it are more often by social scientists than by librarians and generally deal with other topics as well. Diane Gersoni's Sexism and Youth (1974), for example, addresses sexism not just in fairy tales and picture books but in real life. Human-and Anti-Human-Values in Children's Books: A Content Rating Instrument for Educators and Concerned Parents (1976), prepared by the Racism and Sexism Resource Center for Educators of the Council on Interracial Books for Children, provides a rating instrument and ratings of individual books with respect to both sexism and racism. Andre Michel's Down with Stereotypes! Eliminating Sexism from Children's Literature and School Textbooks (1986) deals with sexism- as the title indicates- in both literature and textbooks, but especially the latter. Literary critics have been slower to focus on race and gender. More often, especially in the past, their attention has turned to matters of genre. The most attention has been devoted to genres especially associated with children: fairy tales and fantasy. Over the centuries, fairy tales have drifted in and out of favor in adult deliberations on what is suitable for children. In the mid-twentieth American Studies International ', April 1992, Vol. XXX, No. 1</page><page sequence="16">19 century, some pedagogues felt some discomfort with fairy tales, finding it preferable for young children to focus on the everyday and the familiar. Although Dick and Jane have not altogether disappeared from elementary primers, there is now more willingness, there and elsewhere, to embrace fairy tales and fantasy, spurred in part by Bruno Bettelheim's psychoanalytic justification in The Uses of Enchantment: The Meaning and Importance of Fairy Tales (1976). As for current scholarly work on fairy tales, most critics seem to start with an interest in German literature, and hence in the Grimms' tales, or with an interest in folklore. Overall there has been less attention to American stories, whether Appalachian stories like the Jack tales or African-American tales about High John the Conqueror. Then again, Americans have appropriated many tales, especially European tales, for their own, sometimes Disneyfying them, and sometimes reworking them in other ways, as demonstrated in Jack Zipes's collection Don't Bet on the Prince: Contemporary Feminist Fairy Tales in North America and England (1986), a collection of fiction, poetry, and essays. I will not here go into the many discussions of fairy and folk tales- the theoretical works, the casebooks on particular tales, nor the more general discussions of folklore- but I will point out that a good introduction to the latter is Richard M. Dorson's American Folklore (1959). Works that, focus more on children's folklore include Mary Knapp and Herbert Knapp's One Potato, Two Potato . . . The Secret Education of American Children (1976) and Francelia Butler's Skipping Around the World: The Ritual Nature of Folk Rhymes (1989). Another title worth noting is Elizabeth Cook's The Ordinary and the Fabulous: An Introduction to Myths, Legends and Fairy Tales (1969, rev. 1976). One of many books on storytelling, Cook's contribution is noteworthy for being much more than a pep talk and bibliography: she discusses the backgrounds of various tales and compares styles. Literary critics have paid even more attention to the literary genre of fantasy, both fantasy considered to be for children and fantasy considered to be for adults. In fact, since children's literature still strikes many people as synonymous with fantasy, many critics who turn to children's literature often find themselves turning first, as if unconsciously, to fantasy. It is characteristic that when Roger Sale claims, in Fairy Tales and After: From Snow White to E.B. White (1979), simply to be addressing those children's classics with which he feels imaginative sympathy, they all turn out to be works of fantasy (and mostly British). Similarly, in Narratives of Love &amp; Loss: Studies in Modern Children's Fiction (1987), Margaret Rustin and Michael Rustin's interest in "the imaginative and emotional aspects of children's experience"4 leads them to works of fantasy (again mostly British). In fact, though general and theoretical discussions of fantasy often address children's literature, they are more likely to address such British writers as Carroll and Tolkien than an American such as L. Frank Baum. Nevertheless, important theoretical accounts include The Fantastic: A Structural Approach to a Literary Genre (1975), in which Tzvetan Todorov derives the fantastic from a hesitation between the uncanny and the marvelous, between the supernatural explained and the supernatural accepted; The Fantastic in Literature (1976), in which Eric S. Rabkin locates the fantastic in the contravention of narrative ground rules; Fantasy: The American Studies International, April 1992, Vol. XXX, No.l</page><page sequence="17">20 Literature of Subversion (1981), in which Rosemary Jackson explores the way in which fantasy can register the psychological effects of living in a materialistic culture; and Fantasy and Mimesis : Responses to Reality in Western Literature (1984), in which Kathryn Hume argues that fantasy comprises a literary impulse as significant as mimesis. Collections of fantasy criticism, too, often include at least one article on fantasy for children: Roger C. Schlobin's The Aesthetics of Fantasy Literature and Art (1982) includes more than most, with discussions of such authors as Ursula K. Le Guin and Lloyd Alexander; Robert H. Boyer and Kenneth J. Zahorski's Fantasists on Fantasy : A Collection of Critical Reflectbns (1984) includes reprinted essays by British and American writers for both children and adults. Other critics who have particularly addressed fantasy for children include Sheila A. Egoff, in Worlds Within: Children's Fantasy from the Middle Ages to Today (1988), and Ann Swinfen, in In Defence of Fantasy: A Study of the Genre in English and American Literature since 1945 (1984). Brian Attebery's The Fantasy Tradition in American Literature: From Irving to Le Guin (1980) provides an historical account of an American tradition, one that includes fantasy for children. Mark I. West's anthology of fiction, Before Oz: Juvenile Fantasy Stories from Nineteenth-Century America (1989), succeeds in making a case for the existence of a long-standing American fantasy tradition. Next door to fantasy, indeed overlapping with it in some definitions, is nonsense literature. Celia Catlett Anderson and Marilyn Fain Apseloff provide a guided tour of both verbal and visual nonsense, broadly defined, in Nonsense Literature for Children: Aesop to Seuss (1989). Susan Stewart provides a more theoretical account in Nonsense: Aspects of Intertextuality in Folklore and Literature (1979). Another related genre is adventure fiction. Here too critics have tended to focus on British stories, but both Martin Green and Margery Fisher attend to some American writers as well, in, respectively, Dreams of Adventure, Deeds of Empire (1979) and The Bright Face of Danger (1986). Even though domestic fiction like Alcott7 s comprises an important tradition, many fewer works of criticism address the more realistic genres of American children's literature. Perhaps critics of children's literature tend to overlook a mode that they do not immediately identify with children. Mainstream critics may also be reluctant to associate children with a mode whose status they are trying to elevate- witness the efforts of critic Jane Tompkins when addressing the nineteenth-century works of Susan Warner. Possibly too the considerable attention that has been devoted to Alcott somehow takes the place of general discussions of domestic fiction. In fact, one of the few overviews of domestic fiction for children, outside the general histories of children's literature, appears in Cornelia Meigs's Louisa M. Alcott and the American Family Story (1970; the American edition is entitled simply Louisa M. Alcott). Other than that, the only book-length studies I have been able to locate are sociological: Mary Lystad's content analysis, cited previously, and Anne W. Ellis' The Family Story in the 1960's (1970). In the latter, devoted mostly to British writers, Ellis briefly traces the history of the family story and then sketches the relationships of parents and children and the portrayal of everyday activities in books from a single decade. American Studies International, April 1992, Vol. XXX, No. 1</page><page sequence="18">21 Some attention to realistic fiction likewise seeps into discussions of contemporary fiction, especially fiction for young adults- what was once called "the junior novel/' to cite the title of Cecile Magaliff's early tour of the genre (1964). Some discussions of contemporary fiction are appreciations by fellow practitioners, such as John Rowe Townsend's A Sounding of Storytellers: New and Revised Essays on Contemporary Writers for Children (1979), which addresses several American writers; and David Rees's The Marble in Water: Essays on Contemporary Writers of Fiction for Children and Young Adults (1980) and Painted Desert , Green Shade: Essays on Contemporary Writers of Fiction for Children and Young Adults (1984). Other discussions of contemporary fiction for young adults have focused on issues of particular concern to librarians. In Dennis Thomison's Readings About Adolescent Literature (1970), many of the reprinted articles are essentially annotated bibliographies; others address such issues as censorship and comic books. Jana Varlejs offers a more comprehensive collection, in Young Adult Literature in the Seventies: A Selection of Readings (1978), addressing history and trends, reading interests, minorities, censorship, and comics. Similarly, Millicent Lenz and Ramona M. Mahood, in Young Adult Literature: Background and Criticism (1980), address history and psychology, stereotypes and multiculturalism, sexuality, media, poetry, fantasy, and censorship. Some thematic approaches address both fantastic and realistic modes. Margaret Blount offers a stylish guided tour of animals in both realistic accounts and also fables and fantasies, in Animal Land: The Creatures of Children's Fiction (1975). Although her focus is primarily British, she discusses such American creatures as Brer Rabbit, Mickey Mouse, Stuart Little, and the Wild Things. Denise Escarpit has collected international discussions of the images of the child in The Portrayal of the Child in Children's Literature/La Representation de V enfant dans la literature d'enfance et de jeunesse (1983). Millicent Lenz seeks a mythology of peace, in fantasies as well as in realistic fiction, in Nuclear Age Literature for Youth: The Quest for a Life-Affirming Ethic (1990). Joanne M. Golden takes a quasi- semiotic, quasi-Burkean approach, in The Narrative Symbol in Childhood Literature: Explorations in the Construction of Text (1990). In Don't Tell the Grown-ups: Subversive Children's Literature (1990), Alison Lurie emphasizes how the classics of children's literature, both fantasies and more realistic works, challenge adult values. Another genre that is starting to receive perceptive criticism, a genre unique to children's literature yet too often ignored by those of us whose bread and butter is verbal rather than visual literacy, is that of the picture book. Early studies tended to be typologies-cum-advice books, such as Ruth S. Freeman's Children's Picture Books Yesterday and Today: An Analysis (196 7), or texts explaining artistic and pedagogical techniques, such as Patricia Cianciolo's Illustrations in Children's Books (1970). Then came studies that emphasize the connections between picture books and the fine arts- a useful corrective, but an approach that de-emphasizes the narrative functions of the art. The best of these is probably Donnarae MacCann and Olga Richard's The Child's First Books: A Critical Study of Pictures and Texts (1973). More recently, as I have already noted, Perry Nodelman has sensitively explored the relationship between pictures and text. Also American Studies International, April 1992, Vol. XXX, No.l</page><page sequence="19">22 noteworthy is Joseph H. Schwarcz's W ays of the Illustrator: Visual Communication in Children's Literature (1982), an intelligent introduction to how to read pictures. His discussion touches on the relationship of text and illustration, the portrayal of motion, the portrayal of metaphor, the visual uses of words, and the portrayal of anthropomorphic machines (Schwarcz disapproves). His subsequent The Picture Book Comes of Age: Looking at Children through the Art of Illustration (1991), completed by Chava Schwarcz, deals with such issues as portrayals of stress and space, of grandparents and environments, of war and peace. Harold Darling and Peter Neumeyer's Image &amp; Maker (1984) likewise offers valuable insights, in a miscellaneous collection of essays. Yet another approach to children's literature is to examine its intersections with popular culture. Douglas Street's collection, Children's Novels and the Movies (1983), includes discussions of several American novels that have been made into films, including well-known works (Little Women), less well-known ones (Toby Tyler), and of course The Wonderful Wizard of Oz (of which the movie version, minus the "wonderful," is both better known and better, period). Volumes devoted to popular culture have long been hospitable to children's literature (as has the Journal of Popular Culture ): the early Challenges in American Culture (1970), edited by Ray B. Browne et al., includes essays addressing Little Lord Fauntleroy, the Little Colonel series, and the Hardy boys. Similarly, general surveys and theoretical works, such as John G. Cawelti's Adventure ; Mystery, and Romance: Formula Stories as Art and Popular Culture (1976), touch on genres that have a special resonance for children. Some critics, such as Russel Nye in The Unembarrassed Muse: The Popular Arts in America (1970), not only touch on such crossover works as the dime novel and comic books but also devote attention to works more exclusively for the young, such as the products of the Stratemeyer syndicate (a fiction factory loosely modeled on the Ford assembly line). As for treatments of children's popular culture, much of what passes for criticism here is a revisiting of the scenes of juvenile pleasures. The best of these are fiction writer Bobbie Ann Mason's The Girl Sleuth: A Feminist Guide (1975), a personal, feminist retrospective on Nancy Drew and other girls' series, and Arthur Prager's Rascals at Large, or, The Clue in the Old Nostalgia (1971), a reflection on the many series books available at mid-century. With less style and more combativeness, the engineer John T. Dizer, Jr., addresses boys' series books in Tom Swift &amp; Company/'Boys ' Books" by Stratemeyer and Others (1982). Another nostalgic trek through series books is Faye Riter Kensinger's Children of the Series and How They Grew: Or a Century of Heroines and Heroes, Romantic, Comic, Moral (19 87). More scholarly is Carol Billman's The Secret of the Stratemeyer Syndicate: Nancy Drew, The Hardy Boys, and the Million Dollar Fiction Factory (1986), which offers good insights into the Stratemeyer syndicate. Even more theoretical- though he disclaims the association with children's literature- is Michael Denning' s Mechanic Accents: Dime Novels and Working-Class Culture in America (1987). With respect to other popular forms of children's literature, most volumes devoted to comic strips and comic books seem more intent on anthologizing or American Studies International, April 1992, Vol. XXX, No. 1</page><page sequence="20">23 enthusing- or excoriating- than on interpreting them. The most rabid attack, that of the psychiatrist who fueled the anti-comic-book furor in the fifties by correlating comics with juvenile delinquency (even testifying at U.S. Senate Judiciary hearings), appears in Seduction of the Innocent (1954), by Fredric Wertham. On the other hand, the best general history of the comic strip, covering both U.S. and European contributions, and amply illustrated, is probably still Pierre Couperie et al.'s A History of the Comic Strip (1968). In Comic Books and America , 1945-1954 (1990), William W. Savage, Jr., places a decade of comic books in historical context, noting how they enabled Americans to work through post-war anxieties. Other useful studies of popular culture include Frank Luther Mot^s pioneering study of best sellers, Golden Multitudes: The Story of Best Sellers in the United States (1947), which devotes several chapters to children's books and lists them along with their adult counterparts in tables at the end. Richard Schickel provides an insightful treatment of the Disney phenomenon in The Disney Version : The Life, Times, Art and Commerce of Walt Disney (1968, rev. 1985), a biography that situates the man in American culture. Tony Goodstone's anthology of material from pulp magazines, The Pulps: Fifty Years of American Pop Culture (1970), provides some background for a little-studied area. Alternatively, all of children's literature can be treated as popular culture, presumably to examine the way it purveys social values. That is what Fred Inglis attempts in The Promise of Happiness: Value and Meaning in Children's Fiction (1981), a study that pays somewhat more attention to British than to American manifestations and far more attention to highbrow than to lowbrow forms of children's literature. Finally, it is worth drawing attention to work that has been done in mapping the structures and histories of relevant cultural institutions, work that has not yet been assimilated into literary or cultural criticism of children's literature. An invaluable exploration of the marketplace dynamics of both highbrow and mass-market children's publishing is Joseph Turow's Getting Books to Children: An Exploration of Publisher-Market Relations (1978). Jean Karl's From Childhood to Childhood: Children's Books and Their Creators (1970) and Jean Poindexter Colby's Writing, Illustrating and Editing Children's Books (196 7) provide editors' views of the editing and publishing process. Harriet G. Long outlines the early history of the relationship between American libraries and children in Public Library Service to Children: Foundation and Development (1969); Evelyn Geller provides a more specialized history in Forbidden Books in American Public Libraries, 1876-1939: A Study in Cultural Change (1984). Noteworthy among the many books that recount the history of a publishing firm is Quentin Reynolds' journalistic The Fiction Factory or From Pulp Row to Quality Street (1955), an account of a century of Street &amp; Smith, publishers of both Horatio Alger and Mademoiselle magazine, of comics, Westerns, romances, detective stories, and more. American Studies International, April 1992, Vol. XXX, No.l</page><page sequence="21">24 Individual Authors and Illustrators When literary critics write about children's authors who are better known for their adults' literature (or whose work has been taken over by adults), they generally pay scant attention to the works for children. Books of criticism on T.S. Eliot, for example, typically either fail to mention Old Possum's Book of Practical Cats or dismiss it with a single sentence. Rare is the chapter devoted to such an author's works for children; rarer still is the entire book- a book such as Jerome Griswold's The Children's Books of Randall Jarrell (1988). Yet sometimes a critic discussing an author who has not achieved canonical status will devote more than usual attention to the children's publications, as Linda Welshimer Wagner does in Phyllis McGinley (1971). It is also worth noting that, in general (and especially with respect to literature for boys), one generation's pernicious trash is looked back on with nostalgia by the next generation and is elevated to respectability. Such has been the case with dime novels, with various series mass-produced by the Stratemeyer syndicate (once condemned by the Boy Scouts), and now perhaps with comic books. Horatio Alger, for example, has long since achieved respectability, as critics like Gary Scharnhorst (Horatio Alger, Jr., 1980) point out. Occasionally the once- pernicious trash is even admitted to the pantheon of literature for adults. Mark Twain's work is the clearest example; The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn , now a classic American novel, was once banned in Concord, Massachusetts. There are as well a number of authors with somewhat less elevated, more ambiguous, status in the adults' pantheon, such as James Fenimore Cooper, Jack London, and perhaps Joel Chandler Harris. All have received extended treatment by critics (or, in the case of Harris, folklorists), and I will not delve into the criticism here, though I might point out that useful books of criticism include Earle Labor's Jack London (1974) and R. Bruce Bickley's Joel Chandler Harris (1978). A related phenomenon is the kind of critical attention accorded Ursula K. Le Guin. More attention, at least in the U.S., goes to her works of science fiction than to her works of fantasy-more attention, that is, to her works considered to be for adults than to her works considered to be for children. One useful volume of criticism, of the many devoted to Le Guin, is Barbara J. Bucknall's Ursula K. Le Guin (1981). In general, the phenomenon of elevation and deification has not happened with girls' literature, or at least not until now, when Louisa May Alcott' s currency is on the rise, as latterday feminists pay homage to the impact of Jo March on their lives. Most works of criticism (so too the biographies, which I here ignore) address both Alcott7 s life and work, sometimes the tensions between the two, and sometimes the tensions within each (submission versus subversion). Ruth K. MacDonald provides an overview in Louisa May Alcott (1983). Sarah Elbert's A Hunger for Home: Louisa May Alcott and Little Women (1984) and Charles Strickland's Victorian Domesticity: Families in the Life and Art of Louisa May Alcott (1985) situate Alcott in her nineteenth-century context. More narrowly focused is Joy A. Marsella's The Promise of Destiny: Children and Women in the Short Stories of American Studies International, April 1992, Vol. XXX, No. 1</page><page sequence="22">25 Louisa May Alcott (1983). Madeline Stern's Critical Essays on Louisa May Alcott (1984) samples a variety of views. As for other authors and illustrators primarily known for their children's literature, few works of criticism exist outside specialized series. The largest such series, still going strong, is produced by Twayne, a publisher generally noteworthy for publishing criticism on hitherto marginal figures. Most of these books are titled simply with the author/illustrator's name: they include Michael Levy's Natalie Babbitt (1991), Phyllis Bixler's Frances Hodgson Burnett (1984), Erling B. Holtsmark's Edgar Rice Burroughs (1986), Pat Pflieger's Beverly Cleary (1991), George Shannon's Arnold Lobel (1989), Gary D. Schmidt's Robert McCbskey (1990), Lucien L. Agosta's Howard Pyle (1987), Ruth K. MacDonald's Dr. Seuss (1988), and Janet Spaeth's Laura Ingalls Wilder (19 87). Twayne books about contemporary authors of young adult literature, books incorporating material from extensive interviews with their subjects, begin their titles with the word "presenting," as in Presenting Judy Blume ; they include Maryann N. Weidt's book on Blume (1990), Ted Hippie's on Sue Ellen Bridgers (1990), Patricia J. Campbell's on Robert Cormier (1985, rev. 1989), Jerrie Norris' on Rosa Guy (1988), Jay Daly's on S.E. Hinton (1987, rev. 1989), Alleen Pace Nilsen's on M.E. Kerr (1986), Allene S. Phy's on Norma Klein (1988), Sally Holmes Holtze's on Norma Fox Mazer (1987), Rudine S. Bishop's on Walter Dean Myers (1990), Susan P. Bloom and Cathryn M. Mercier's on Zibby Oneal (1991), Donald R. Gallo's on Richard Peck (1989), and Jack Jacob Forman's on Paul Zindel (1988). Among older series, now inactive, is one published by Walck in the U.S. (by Bodley Head in England); these books, largely appreciations-cum-biography, include Edward Blishen's Hugh Lofting (1968), Elizabeth Nesbitt's Howard Pyle (1966), Virginia Haviland's Ruth Sawyer (1965), and Cornelia Meigs's Louisa M. Alcott (1970, entitled Louisa M. Alcott and the American Family Story in England). Outside the specialized series are biographies, mostly hagiographies, some of which include criticism as well-and they are often one of the few sources of criticism on their subject. Daniel Roselle's Samuel Griswold Goodrich , Creator of Peter Parley : A Study of his Life and Work (1968) includes some analysis of the nineteenth-century Parley industry, together with accounts of the spurious Parleys. Helen Frances Benner's Kate Douglas Wiggin's Country of Childhood (1956) proffers some criticism of Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm and Wiggin's other works. John Levi Cutler gives an account of a dime novelist in Gilbert Patten and his Frank Merriwell Saga: A Study in Sub-Literary Fiction , 1896-1913 (1934). Not strictly biographical is Anne Carroll Moore and Bertha Mahony Miller's Writing and Criticism: A Book for Margery Bianco (1951), which includes tributes to Bianco and occasional pieces by her. Authors with a cult following, usually fantasists, spawn a special breed of secondary work, especially indexes to the works and guides to the memorabilia. Lloyd Alexander's work is indexed in Michael O. Tunnell's The Prydain Companion: A Reference Guide to Lloyd Alexander's Prydain Chronicles (1989). The more-established Oz following has given rise to David L. Greene and Dick Martin's The Oz Scrapbook (19 77), which provides an account of the various Oz American Studies International, April 1992, Vol. XXX, No.l</page><page sequence="23">26 books by Baum and others, the movies and other spinoffs, accompanied by illus- trations of, among other things, wallpaper, a board game, and playbills; Allen Eyles's similar The World of Oz (1985); and Jack Snow's Who's Who in Oz (1988). More scholarly is Raylyn Moore's Wonderful Wizard Marvelous Land (1974). Critical essays on Baum appear in Michael Patrick Hearn's edition of The Wizard of Oz (1983). Books about individual illustrators, like many of the books about illustration generally, are primarily concerned with reproducing the illustrations. But since the accompanying text, however minimal, often provides some insight that is not available elsewhere, and since the illustrations allow one to examine samples of an entire oeuure without having to trundle to half a dozen libraries, these volumes are worth noting. They include David Larkin's The Art of Nancy Ekholm Burkert (1977), Byron Preiss's The Art of Leo &amp; Diane Dillon (1981), Henry M. Reed's The A.B. Frost Book (1 967), Helen L. Jones's Robert Lawson, Illustrator: A Selection of his Characteristic Illustrations (1972), Henry C. Pitz's Howard Pyle: Writer ; Illustrator, Founder of the Brandywine School (1975), Mary Stofflefs Dr. Seussfrom Then to Now (1986), Gene Mitchell's The Subject Was Children: The Art of Jessie Willcox Smith (1979), and Douglas Allen and Douglas Allen, Jr.'s N.C. Wyeth: The Collected Paintings, Illustrations, and Murals (1972). More interpretive than these volumes are Douglas G. Greene and Michael Patrick Hearn's W.W. Denslow (1976), Selma Lane's The Art of Maurice Sendak (1980), and S. Michael Schnessel's Jessie Willcox Smith (1978). Finally it is worth noting the many volumes of essays written by individual authors and illustrators. Most are collections of occasional pieces, generally including some exploration of the writer' s own work, together with essays that range between rationales and how-tos. Jane Yolen works both ends of the spectrum: her Touch Magic: Fantasy, Faerie and Folklore in the Literature of Childhood (1981) is a plea for the importance of folktale and fantasy; her Writing Books for Children (1973, rev. 1983) is more of a how-to. Henry C. Pitz does both in a single schizophrenic book, Illustrating Children's Books: History- Technique-Production (1963). Lois Lenski celebrates regional diversity in Adventure in Understanding: Talks to Parents, Teachers and Librarians 1944-1966 (1968); Ursula K. Le Guin celebrates fantasy and science fiction in The Language of the Night: Essays on Fantasy and Science Fiction (1979); and Nancy Willard celebrates nonsense and fairy tales in Angel in the Parlor: 5 Stories and 8 Essays (1983). Marcia Brown's Lotus Seeds: Children, Pictures, and Books (1986) includes accounts of her own practices and reflections on children and literature; Maurice Sendak's Caldecott &amp; Co.: Notes on Books and Pictures (1988) includes accounts of his practices together with appreciations of his predecessors, including Disney; and Katherine Paterson's Gates of Excellence: On Reading and Writing Books for Children (1981) and The Spying Heart: More Thoughts on Reading and Writing Books for Children (1989) similarly include accounts of her writing process and background. In Trailing Clouds of Glory: Spiritual Values in Children's Literature (1985), Madeleine L'Engle provides extended quotations, ranging from Mark Twain to Judy Blume, to show how children's literature can reinforce spiritual values. Uri Shulevitz' Writing with American Studies International, April 1992, Vol XXX, No. 1</page><page sequence="24">27 Pictures: How to Write and Illustrate Children's Books (1985) is at the how-to end of the spectrum, but his amply illustrated volume also offers insight into how to read pictures, as well as into his own artistic process and the process of shepherding artwork through publication. Particularly illuminating among these practitioners' works, for the purposes of literary criticism, is Eleanor Cameron's The Green and Burning Tree: On the Writing and Enjoyment of Children's Books (1969), which celebrates fantasy, style, children's literature, and children, duly noting the gap between adults and children, and the insidious dangers of condescension. Cameron thus brings me back to where I started, to the contradiction at the heart of children's literature. This gap between the producers and the ostensible consumers, together with such questions as how children's literature is an instrument of global culture and how verbal and visual literacy interconnect, set the stage for the next step-the next step not just in criticism of children's literature but in literary criticism generally. For these issues that confront the criticism of children's literature also confront literary studies as a whole. Children's literature provides an ideal laboratory for re- thinking, re-theorizing, language and literature.
