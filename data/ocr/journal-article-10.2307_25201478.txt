The Ka^haka or Katha Upanisad is the first of the metrical Upanisads. This makes it apparently easier to understand than the old Upanisads. In every verse of good Indian poetry the conclusion of the idea coincides with the conclusion of the verse, or, even better, with the conclusion of the half-verse.</page><page sequence="2">154 REVIEWS OF B00K8 The dialogue form, chosen and adhered to in the K??haka Upanisad (a dialogue between Yama and Naciketas) gives a further incentive to concise and pregnant expression of thought in assertion and contradiction. Thus the K?thaka Upanisad is generally regarded as easy of comprehension. Moreover, according to the general opinion of those who discuss the age-sequence of the Upanisads, it is connected with the beginning of the middle Upanisad period. The Kathaka Upanisad depicts?sometimes in literal quotations?the views of the old chief Upanisads concerning cosmogony and ritual. To these questions are now added psychological problems (Yoga), which develop in the later Upanisads into further personal problems, e.g. god person alities, which are not personified elements of nature as in the Rigveda. For all these reasons special interest is shown in the K?^haka Upanisad, particularly in the West and in modern India, which is influenced by the West. Because of this the author of the above book undertook the difficult task of writing the first comprehensive commentary on the K??haka Upanisad which is indeed the first ever published on an Upanisad on the Unes of classic philological research or of bible exegesis. Rawson makes use of all three chief groups of the Ved?nta interpreters (?ankara's Advaitam, R?m?nuja's Vi?isfca-advai tam, and Madhva's Dvaitam), and adds the explanations of most of the modern and Western authorities. Thus an extensive compendium has been made up (xviii + 242 pages), a work most valuable on account of its accuracy in compilation and translation. But the very exhaustiveness of the work emphasizes the fact that the Kanaka Upanisad presents fundamental difficulties to the understanding. Some of these can, it is true, be ascribed to the author's point of view. Intent on pointing out the parallels to monotheism he treats the slight trends in this direction which occur in the K?thaka Upanisad as completed conceptions. But perhaps even for these another explanation might be found. Rawson interprets</page><page sequence="3">THE KATHA UPANISAD 155 the first appearance of the Yoga, too, in a theistic sense. Yoga, which according to his own views, is in its classic form with Pata?jali (Yoga-sutras) far removed from the idea of God. Thus Rawson displaces the balance which, in the K?thaka Upanisad, is still actually on the side of the old cosmic Upanisads. To understand the ancient Upani?ads we must adopt a basis of thought fundamentally different from that to which we are accustomed. We must discard the Western premises of view handed down to us from the times of the Sophists of ancient Greece, the presupposition that Man and the single personality is the measure of all. We must return to the presophistic cosmic standpoint that Man and his highest anthropomorphic ideal, God or gods, are only part and parcel of the universe. But when we once take this difficult step and abide by it, the way is open for the under standing of the whole world of the early Upani?ads and of all texts previous to their times. All these are founded on the fundamental idea of complete union and relationship of all and everything. Without a logical break they develop on this basis their conceptions of cosmogony and magic ritual. But even this attitude towards Indian mind does not help us over all the difficulties of the K?^haka Upanisad. These arise because it may be regarded as the transition from natural to transmitted cosmic views. The premise of equality for everything is firmly held, even if psychological research has arrived at the conception of a purely intellectual ?tman. Rightly or wrongly this merely human ?tman is now sought in all nature, whether in animate or inanimate shape. In addition to these inner difficulties the shortness of the metric form of the K??haka Upani?ad, far from simplifying the understanding of the text, renders it more complicated. Verses from Rigveda and quotations from the early Upani?ads are introduced. On the other hand the metric form of the K?thaka Upanisad is suitable for later insertions.</page><page sequence="4">156 REVIEWS OF BOOK8 The distinctions between the two Adhy?yas or between single Vall?8 within the same Adhy?ya do not help in the solution of this difficulty. Further in the Kanaka Upanisad the balance between early cosmic and new personal problems has not yet been established, as is perhaps the case in the subsequent middle and later Upanisads. New difficulties crop up, especially in the K?thaka Upanisad, when we apply detailed analysis. The plot of the K?thaka Upanisad is taken almost word for word from Taittiriya Br?hmana, iii, 11; 8. There Yama has, through the sin of neglected hospitality towards a brahmin, forfeited in the first night his offspring, in the second his cattle, in the third his good works ; their redemption by means of corresponding gifts is characteristic of the consis tent Br?hmana views. Offspring is gained or, in this case, regained by returning the son (Naciketas) to his reconciled father (pronta = returned to his senses) ; cattle (worldly possessions) and also good works (ethical Karma) are, accord ing to the Karma-m?rga, likewise acquired or redeemed by sacrificial fire. In the K?thaka Upanisad actio and reactio 1 and 2 remain the same as in the Br?hmana narrative. But to the Karma-m?rga is added in the times of the K?thaka Upanisad the Jn?na-m?rga ; thus the ethical debt (actio 3) is now replaced by the granting of knowledge as the new conception of good works. Therefore the knowledge of Yoga and the knowledge of immortalization of works or of their agent, the ?tman, is now asked for. Thus it is not a question of the meaning of sampar?ya (death) but definitely one of the continuation of the ?tman in death, the third boon in K?thaka Upanisad, i, 20 and 29. In this way a difficulty of interpretation is solved by consistent comparison with the Br?hmana text. Other problems cannot be solved by comparison. The K?thaka Upanisad contains hapax legomenon, unfortunately in most important passages. The second boon is granted to</page><page sequence="5">THE KATHA UPANISAD 157 Naciketas in the form of a * srnlc? '. In the discussion of the third boon (Jn?na-m?rga), however, this same srrjk? is rejected with scorn?perhaps this contradiction and the hapax legomenon are to be explained as a change of front from Karma-m?rga to psychological Jn?na-m? ga. Srnk? should accordingly in both instances be translated as " chain ", in the sense of the magic practice of sacrifice, which is emphasized by the magic of numbers (?n-naciketas, tribhir . . . ?nkarma-krt. . . ?nnaciketas . . . trayam ... i, 17 and 18), following on the first appreciation of srnk?. The contradiction between the second and third mention of srnk? would lie in the nature of this composite text (combination and conflict of Karma and Jn?na-m?rga). Another difficulty in the understanding of details might be overcome by the simple means of substituting a rendering different from the one generally accepted. K?thaka Upani?ad, i, 3, tells of the cows which Naciketas* father offers in what is called the " sarta-vedas " (sacrifice of all and everything). It would be more than surprising if the father had dared to supply nothing but cows which were " old " and " whose strength was worn out " (Rawson, p. 57 f.) In my Madhvas Kommentar zur K?thaka Upanisad, published in 1922, I suggested a translation of " nir-indriya " as " sinnloses Vieh "=senseless cattle. On the one hand this would agree better with the idea of sarva-vedas, the greatest sacrifice, for which the worst cows ought not to be chosen?it is note worthy that the Taittir?ya Brahmana does not mention a depreciation in their quality !?on the other hand this would also explain the resolution of the ?raddh?v?n (ardently devout) Naciketas, to make the sacrifice really one of all and everything by offering up his own human sense-gifted person. A further small addition to the meaning may be made. The two attributes of the Purusa in Kanaka Upanisad, vi, 8, must be taken together. " Alinga " might well be rendered, as a few translators besides Rawson have given it, in the logical sense as " indefinable " (without characteristics).</page><page sequence="6">158 REVIEWS OF BOOKS This is suggested by the accompanying attribute " vy?paka ", which also has a logical tinge. The following verse, 6, 9, points expressly to this view that the exterior perception, confined to marks, fails to help us to conceive the Purusa, and that a real conception of him can only be gained by intuition. In connection with this thought, K?thaka Upanisad, ii, 23, can also be understood. Here we are not meant to regard the " vrnute " as a personal choice of grace of Him, the ?tman, or as a personal favour of revelation to His follower. The expression seems to be merely metaphorical, as if one were speaking of an object of which one suddenly and spon taneously becomes aware. Rawson takes this poetic mode of expression as a starting-point for his theistic interpretation. There has also been an attempt to point out a theistic tendency of the K?thaka Upanisad in its use of the term dh?tu- (or dh?tuh-) pras?da (grace of the creator). Rawson's conscientious scientific methods, however, raised a doubt here in his own mind as to whether it would not bo better to give the impersonal rendering " through clarification of the elements" (dh?tu-pras?da), although from his outlook he prefers the theistic interpretation. If one, however, under stands the two above-mentioned passages in the way suggested by me, there is scarcely a trace of theistic tendency to be found. The designation " Purusa " for the highest ?tman, which is taken over from early cosmic texts does not support the theistic theory. " The highest step of the Visnu " is interpreted in rigvedic manner as connected with the ancient ideas of Svarga. The highest ?tman, identified with the impersonal cosmic power of the Brahman, is still in the sense of the old Upanisads " ?nanda " (supreme bliss), because he is " ananta " and " bh?man " (=unlimited, cosmic wideness). Therefore, it is superfluous to replace ananta in Taittir?ya Upanisad, ii, 1, by ?nanrfa (cf. Rawson, p. 35). With this highest universal ?tman every single ?tman is identified as his worldly manifes</page><page sequence="7">THE KATHA UPANISAD 159 tation. It is not evident why Rawson designates this funda mental dogma of all Upanisads as " impossible bare identity " (p. 169). We regret that Rawson has not added the intended chapter on definite theism in the K?^haka Upani?ad as a justification of the subtitle of his book An Introductory Study in the Hindu Doctrine of God and of Human Destiny. His occasional hints of " the theistic element in the Upanisads being much stronger than was once supposed " and his remark that the K?^haka Upani?ad&lt;( is on the whole distinctly theistic " (p. 208) would then have been more convincing. He himself admits (p. 145) that in the Kanaka Upanisad " a personal development... had not yet proceeded very far ". Nor can his definition of the Yoga in the K?thaka Upanisad as " meditative prayer " and " prayer of communion with . Him, the God " (p. 92, 223 ff., etc.) be accepted without fuller explanation. The comparison he makes with the Yoga taught in the Bhagavadg?t?, the chronology of which is still uncertain, is not quite convincing, since even there another meaning is possible. (I hope to publish shortly a treatise giving in detail a vindication of these views.) The analogies with Western thinkers, which Rawson often brings in, are not a definite help. There are literal similarities of expression but bound to another basis of thought. In the above review no mention has been made of other possible deviations from his interpretation of points not essential to the main principle. Sometimes we might prefer to his translation an earlier rendering which he quotes but rejects, e.g. on K?^haka Upani?ad, ii, 8 ; ii, 13 ; ii, 16, and iii, 1. Occasionally he himself gives a better translation in his notes than in the text, e.g. on " apramatta ", K?thaka Upani?ad, vi, 11. Only in rare cases does one fail to see the reasons which made him deviate from the literal translation (in Kanaka Upanisad, iv, 1, by rendering " ka?cit " by " a certain " he unnecessarily narrows the meaning of the wide term. The literal translation agrees better with the general tenor of this passage).</page><page sequence="8">160 REVIEWS OF BOOKS These trifling criticisms are not intended to detract from the merit of the work, which is excellent in its details.
