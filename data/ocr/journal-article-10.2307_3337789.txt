"It is smoking but there is no firewood." nthropologist Victor Turner documented this Lunda-Ndembu proverb in Zambia, and with the aid of an interpreter he provided the follow- ing explanation: "Often a lot of smoke comes from a kitchen, but on inspection there are no more than one or two pieces of firewood; one must not be deceived by imposing external appearances, for in reality there may be little substance behind them."' Since the 1930s the systematic documentation of various aspects of the life and culture of Chokwe, Lwena (Luvale), Lunda, and other related peoples of Angola, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and Zambia has greatly increased, thanks to the ef- forts of scholars such as Hermann Baumann (1935), Jose Redinha (1965, 1974), Charles M.

All of us have benefited from the rich accounts pro- vided by explorers and ethnographers such as Hermenegildo Capelo and Robert Ivens (1881), Serpa Pinto (1881), Vemey L. Cameron (1877), Henrique A. Dias de Carvalho (1890), Fonseca Cardoso (1919), Dugald Campbell (1922), and others who tra- 18 versed the lands of these central African peoples more than one hundred years ago. In all, there is a significant amount of ethnographic material and a number of excellent anthropological studies that range in focus from the economy of the region to its ritual practices and cos- mological views. However, in many ways the study of its arts is in its infancy. To return to the proverb at the beginning of this essay, in terms of Chokwe and related peoples, the only pieces of fire- wood in the art historical kitchen were placed there by one dedi- cated scholar, Marie-Louise Bastin, whose oeuvre remains the main source for any consideration of Chokwe art.3 Her postulated atrican arts ? winter 2000</page><page sequence="4">Opposite page: 3.

This style of Pwo, with its particular treatment of the hair, is favored in areas of western and northwestern Zambia, where the Lwena are known as Luvale. styles of Chokwe sculpture (Bastin 1976,1982) and the sculpture of the Lwena, Songo, Ovimbundu, Ngangela, and others (Bastin 1971) have given us a solid basis for attributing to these peoples countless works of art in private and museum collections.4 Bastin's numerous scholarly contributions provide a core theoretical (art historical) model that invites further analysis. These arts are so diverse and complex that even some of the more well-known forms remain vastly understudied or misunderstood.5 To illustrate this point, this article will focus on Pwo ("woman"), a popular ancestral mask character, or akishi, for Chokwe, Lwena (known as Luvale in areas of western Zambia), winter 2000 ? atrican arts Lunda, and their neighbors.6 Pwo is a familiar face in most museum and private collections (Fig. 1). Pwo, Dundo Style The most discernible elements of a Chokwe style of wooden mask carving have been well defined. Bastin describes their Pwo masks (Figs. 2, Cover): In the wooden masks, the eyes are usually elliptical or almond-shaped and generally half-closed. The swollen eyelids are prolonged down to the center of the concave eye-sockets. Sometimes the eyes are globular and have horizontal slits. Occasionally the forehead has a carved head-band. The ears are near- ly always curved or else semi-circular with the tra- gus shown. The traditional scarifications are usually engraved, cut away, incrusted or carved in relief. (Bastin 1982:90) To this list of elements one may also add the sharply defined mouth, partially open, its protruding flattened lips framing filed triangular teeth.7 Bastin's close observation of numerous Pwo mask examples at the Museu do Dundo in Angola, as illus- trated in her book Art decoratif tshokwe (1961), helped her reaf- firm what she called Chokwe "traditional canons" that reflect the "collective concept of ancestral spirits" (Bastin 1982:90).8 The study of art styles found in a Portuguese-sponsored muse- um located in Chokwe territory9 brings forth several issues that are relevant to this contemplation of Pwo masks. One important Dundo museum photograph (Fig. 3) shows 30 Pwo masks displayed on glass shelves in the Sala da Crenqa Animista, or "Room of Animist Belief." They are part of a collec- tion that in the 1950s included 110 wooden masks, including numerous Pwo examples, and 67 fiber-and-resin masks of vari- ous types (Porto 1999:104-5).10 The masks illustrated in this pho- tograph confirm the general accuracy of Bastin's description of this style for the Chokwe: all of them share similarities in the styl- ization of the eyes, in the formal treatment of the mouth, nose, and ears, and, in most cases, in facial scarification details.1 However, there are obvious differences in the conception of these masks. Some tend toward naturalism, while others exhib- it varying degrees of stylization, particularly in the eyes and mouth as well as in the overall contours of the face, which may be oval, angular, or elongated. Even if one allows for individual artistic creativity as an influence in this variation (Bastin 1982:90), the fact remains that not all the masks in the Dundo photograph are "purely" Chokwe. In fact, some are catalogued as Shinji (western neighbors of the Chokwe in northeastern Angola), and others are similar to masks documented among the Songo in central Angola, though they may not necessarily carry that attribution (ordian et al. 1998: fig. 60).12 A couple of other masks in the photograph show Upper Zambezi stylistic tendencies: they suggest a transitional style between stereotyp- ical Chokwe and Lwena/Luvale styles, an exchange of influ- ences acknowledged by Jose Redinha (1965:36-37), who collected most of the Museu do Dundo's pieces (Fig. 4). Bastin explains that a Lwena style of carving (related to that of the Chokwe) is distinguished by the "gentleness of its lines," a tendency toward naturalism, and a taste for round and full 19</page><page sequence="5">forms (1969:49).13 Lwena Pwo masks sometimes incorporate tall, rounded coiffures (Figs. 5-7). Although not shown in the Dundo photograph, at least a couple of Pwo examples in the museum accurately fit the Lwena style description (Bastin 1961: figs. 261, 262). However, a large number of Dundo masks depart from an essentially Chokwe stylistic canon and inconclusively hint at other attributions. Most of the masks were originally collected under Redinha's direction, and others were acquired by Hermann Baumann; both men pursued independent collecting campaigns through parts of central, eastern, and northeastern Angola from the 1930s to the 1950s (Areia 1995:11-18).14 To some extent the stylistic variation evident in the photograph may be attributed to a combination of elements, but it most probably reflects a sampling of styles and substyles favored in different areas. Because Bastin gained ac- cess to the Dundo collection in the 1950s, when all these Pwo masks were in the context of a Chokwe stronghold, she never approached the pieces in their diversity but rather saw them through the eyes of local Chokwe informants. As familiar as these masks may seem, we still do not have a grasp on the stylis- tic complexities of the region, a problem compounded by the lack of documentation for these and many other collected masks.15 Carvalho's early (1890) illustration of a Chokwe mask per- former (Fig. 8) is relevant to this argument. The performer wears a face mask (identified as Pwo in Bastin 1982:90) that does not clearly fit within the described canons of a Chokwe style. Its subtly conceived anthropomorphic face has open, round eyes and mouthl6 and is devoid of scarification details.17 This mask actually has more in common with Lwena/Luvale and Luchazi examples documented in eastern Angola and western and northwestern Zambia (Fig. 9; see also Jordan et al. 1998: figs. 64, 66, 67; Felix &amp; Jordan 1998) than it does with most of the masks collected for the Dundo museum and attributed to the Chokwe.l8 Carvalho's illustration supports the idea that in the late nine- teenth century at least two clearly discernible stylistic approach- es or trends in the manufacture of Pwo masks were established in Angola. In addition to the more elaborate tendency that remains close to Bastin's definition of a Chokwe style, as seen in the most of the masks in the Dundo collection, there was a more atrican arts ? winter 2000 20</page><page sequence="6">minimalistic but equally refined and expressive style.19 The lat- ter is depicted in Carvalho's illustration and found in numerous Pwo examples collected in eastern and southeastern Angola, as well as in western and northwestern Zambia. Efforts to distin- guish Congolese (D.R.C.), Angolan, and Zambian Pwo styles are beside the point. People, like good ideas, cross all boundaries, and similar Pwo styles are commonly found on both sides of the political borders of this region.20 A generalization that may have some validity supports two major (northern and southern) stylistic zones. One lies north and northeast of Muzamba, the Chokwe "country of origin" in north- eastern Angola (Bastin 1982:246), where Chokwe and their Minungu, Songo, and Shinji neighbors continue to create versions of Pwo that depart from a Chokwe stylistic canon (Felix 1997:105-11). The second is south and east/southeast of Moxico (in central-eastern Angola), where the Lwena/Luvale and Luchazi probably sowed their own stylistic seeds that may have developed separately or in combination with the often distinct and subtle southern styles of the southern Lunda, Mbunda, Mbwela, and Ngangela (Fig. 10; F6lix &amp; Jordain 1998; Kubik 1993:25, 98-99).

The tall, rounded coiffure with incised lines probably indicates the high sta- tus of the female ancestor represented. Pwo, or "woman," is a generic term for such masks, but specific masked ancestral spirits may be addressed using the actual name of the woman/ancestor meant to-be honored by the community or by the family hosting an initiation camp. This page: Left: 6. Pwevo/Pwo mask. Luvale or Luchazi, mid-20th century. Wood, fibers, pigment; 20.3cm (8'). Private U.S. collection. In Zambia, where this mask was probably collected, the Luvale and Luchazi name for Pwo is Pwevo. Luvale and Luchazi mask-carving styles are close- ly related. In the case of masks such as this one, it is almost impossible to make a distinction. Right: 7. Pwo mask. Lwena, early 20th century. Wood, feathers, fiber, metal, leather, pigment; 31.1cm (12.3").

In 1997 1 showed a photo of this mask to various Zambian friends (Luvale, Lunda, and Chokwe), who said the mask represented a female chief. Its elaborate coiffure, feathered headdress, and overall elegance were key to this interpretation. MANU SASSOONIAN 21 winter 2000 ? atrican arts</page><page sequence="7">Within these predominant northern and southern styles, specific group attributions are often possible, but without concrete field documentation such an exercise would remain highly speculative. Considerable ethnic integration (marriages, alliances, clans, shared territories, shared initiation camps) occurs in all these neighboring areas, and commissioning masks from one carver in one or another style is not uncommon (Felix &amp; Jordan 1998). In the case of the Dundo museum collection, it is also significant that the Pwo masks were available to performers who wore them in dances held in the context of a Dundo "cultural vil- lage," where Portuguese and other European visitors consti- tuted the main audience (see Areia 1995; Porto 1999). Most important, a number of carvers in museum-sponsored "crafts" workshops created wooden sculptures, including various ver- sions of Pwo masks, "inspired" by pieces in the Dundo collec- tion that had been collected in widely dispersed regions of Angola (Areia 1995:174-75).21 In that context, the institution became a new source for the imitation of stylistic canons, a development that must have affected the natural flow of ideas; masks created in and around the town may reflect styles more common in other areas of Angola. In many ways the Museu do Dundo was a supermarket of regional art forms divorced from most of their original cultural framework. Ironically, the most common form of Pwo mask among Chokwe and related peoples is a nonwooden version made from pitch or tar over a framework of bent branches to which facial details are applied in bands of white and red cloth or paper. 22 This page: Left: 8. This illustration of an Angolan Pwo performer was published by Portu- guese explorer Henrique Carvalho (1890:245). The mask is similar to exam- ples found among Lwena and Luchazi in Angola south and east of the town of Moxico in Angola and in areas of western and northwestern Zambia. Right: 9. Pwevo/Pwo mask.

This mask, probably a Zambian or Angolan Luchazi example, resembles the one illustrated by Carvalho in its rounded facial contours and open eyes and mouth. Elements of a Chokwe Pwo carving style are still evident, but the treatment of forms reflects a different aesthetic. The style is less idiosyn- cratic but equally expressive and dramatic.

This well-documented mask was collected in a Luchazi village in north- western Zambia. When it was photographed in the field in 1971 (Kubik 1993), it wore a different coiffure and beaded hair decorations. Pwo/Pwevo hair and hair ornaments are often replaced. Wooden masks are well kept and sometimes inherited through generations. atrican arts ? winter 2000</page><page sequence="8">Until recently (Jordan 1993; Felix &amp; Jordan 1998) it was not given proper attention. Bastin did not have access to such types, prob- ably because the collectors for the Dundo museum were not interested in masks made from ephemeral materials. That led her to note that "very few Pwo masks in resin are known," although she provided an accurate description of the type: "...the features are standardized but less pronounced. A sort of rectangular domino in red cloth normally covers the eyes and nose. The mouth is small" (1982:90). That description generally applies to such masks representing male and female characters. Even today they far outnumber similar characters in wood.22 The failure to recognize the complexities of Chokwe and related art styles has in my opinion resulted in shortcomings in the established canon. These are easily matched by those in the documented descriptions of the context for akishi masquerades and their attributed meaning or meanings. Understanding Pwo The importance or sociocultural relevance of Chokwe and relat- ed masquerades has consistently been dismissed by scholars, who usually treat the subject as peripheral to what they deem to be more important ritual processes or symbolic structures.23 C. M. N. White (1948:13) most clearly expresses his lack of inter- est in what he seems to see as evidence of the "degeneration" of the culture of a distant past.24 White comments on Lunda and Luvale masquerades in Zambia: winter 2000 ? atrican arts The circumcision ceremonies of the Lunda and Luvale tribes are characterized by the makishi dancers-mask dancers who vary from tribe to tribe. It is impossible to describe them in any detail here, and it must suffice to say that they usually wear fiber costumes covering the whole body and have dis- tinctive head-dresses, often very elaborate. To some extent they have to-day degenerated to become itin- erant clowns and lost their original status, and this particularly refers to the mwana-pwevo.25 Recent fieldwork focusing on the role of masquerades in Zambia (Cameron 1995; Jordain 1993, 1996) provides an alterna- tive view, documenting how akishi (makishi in Zambia) masquer- ades represent aspects of the shared cosmologies of Chokwe, Lunda, Lwena/Luvale, and related peoples. Within a large reper- toire of mask character types, Pwo (Pwevo in Zambia)-the "woman" or female ancestor-and Mwana Pwo (Mwana Pwevo in Zambia; Fig. 11)-"the young woman"-actually perform a crucial role in transmitting culturally relevant information, main- ly in the context of the mukanda male initiation.26 The "woman" and "young woman" masks represent ideal and comparable models for a "fulfilled" versus a "potential" woman (Cameron 1998a, 1998b; Jordan 1998). Such associative elements are further developed by these peoples' creation of other female mask types, including an "immature woman," a mother, an old woman (Fig. 12), and a female chief (Jordan 1998; Felix &amp; Jordan 1998). 23</page><page sequence="9">The identification of some masks as representing female chiefs (or female ancestors perceived as bearers of royal lineages) is based on the recent field documentation of one Chokwe fiber- and-resin mask representing Lweji, the first Lunda female chief (orda_n 1993:50, 2000:90), together with the field identification (based on photographs of specific masks) of various Pwo-related masks with exceptionally elaborate coiffures (Figs. 7,13). Some of the hairstyles include consecutive arched diadems that resemble the crowns worn by male and female chiefs in Angola, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and Zambia (Jordan et al. 1998: fig. 65; F6lix &amp; Jordan 1998:176-77, 180-81).27 Akishi masquerades, like many other art forms created by the peoples concerned here, evoke cosmological precepts and serve to present and represent principles of social and political organiza- tion, history, philosophy, religion, and morality (Jordan 1998:67). These principles are shared but also distinct in that they may respond to local interpretations of broader regional or overarch- ing cultural models. Further studies of regional art styles and types will probably better reflect these peoples' sociocultural and political complexities, because intended modes of representation give shape to defined (shared or distinct) values or norms. This article is a brief initial reflection on the established body of knowledge regarding the arts of Chokwe and related peoples. Strong field documentation will be crucial in corroborating or reconsidering theories. By revisiting Pwo, a familiar and cele- brated mask, I have been able to outline issues that I will con- tinue to address in future publications.

Zoomorphic items were produced from the 2nd century B.C. onwards; however it is only in the 12th and 13th cen- turies A.D. that large numbers of terracotta anthropomorphic and zoomorphic sculptures, measuring between 1.5 cm and 35 cm high, were produced. These statuettes were found alongside copper alloy items, small human figurines, and more especially many items of jewelry, sometimes adorned with small-scale human heads or animal forms. A number of these human representa- tions are heavily stylized, such as cylindrical busts with eyes perforated through the clay, and a mouth marked by an incision. A spe- cial feature is the horned excrescence on top of the head. Other busts support a simple, flat oval head. Another group of sculptures, which in- clude zoomorphic representations, stylized busts and figurative human statuettes, are characterized by eyes made up of a sphere slit horizontally, and chevron incisions. The b O kS Continuedfrom page 15 rations of the term Barumism create much- needed intellectual space for the seamy side of "serious" educational displays, subtexts that are fraught with irony, play, voyeurism, and the unexpected distortions of often rigid or conventionalized content. Erlmann's essay on the African Choir begins with compelling issues of how nonwhite colonial subjects may seek an imagined, almost talismanic connec- tion with a global ecumene in a politically and culturally disconnected world. He ends, how- ever, with too little said about the choir itself, made up of young black South African men and women who toured Britain and Europe, or about the meanings that can be reasonably inferred from their dress and dramaturgy. Two essays, thematic vignettes from longer biographical works, focus on the activities of exceptional individuals. Peacock's contribu- tion on the Great Farini (born William Leonard Hunt) focuses on how differently the showman conceptualized his display of Zulus, his first foray into African entertainment genres, com- pared to the more sedate and educational exhi- bitions of San people that he produced later in his long and wide-ranging career. Peacock emphasizes the extraordinary life and persona of Farini himself, how he recruited performers and learned about Africa by traveling there, and his role in popularizing images of the Zulu and San with American audiences. Gordon's essay, by contrast, looks at Donald Bain's pet objective: setting up a "Bushman Reserve" from the public impetus he hoped to gain from the exhibition of San people in Johannesburg's Imperial Exhibition. This failed philanthropic project reflects the changed intellectual climate surrounding the display of colonial subjects in the years leading up to the Second World War. The remaining three essays deal with a more difficult and less studied subject: how the African performers lived through and respond- 92 shaven heads of the figurative statuettes are tiny, whereas the lips and chin are prominent. The short arms of the statuettes carry sashes crossed over the bust, and jewelry. Other sculp- tures are hybrid, being made up of a cylindri- cal body mounted by an animal head. Some isolated heads have their faces engraved with circle motifs. The Urgency of the Situation Most of the objects came to light during official excavations and were placed in the custody of Muse6 National du Tchad at N'Jamena. However, a part of this collection was scat- tered in 1979 at a time of political crisis. Since then, looting has also taken place at the site of the archaeological excavations themselves. The cultural authorities reacted by setting up an emergency plan to inform the population about the need to protect their heritage. There has been a special effort to promote the construction of museums by the inhabitants in the regions affected. C ed to the remarkable experience of being people on show. The essays by Green on the six imper- turbable "pygmies" who visited the Queen and Westminster, and lived for a time in Yorkshire; by Killingray and Henderson on the public masquerade and private homosexuality of LoBagola/Lee; and by Parsons on the cross- Atlantic epiphany of a brutalized Taaibosch as "Clicko, the Dancing Bushman" are works of careful scholarship. More important, they pre- sent a rather tricky premise in extremely polit- ically correct times: that within the exploitative structure of the shows, these individuals in their travels may have fueled their own intel- lectual cpriosity and even experienced personal growth. Greene makes this point subtly and provides abundant documentary evidence to support his argument that the six diminutive African men and women had an extremely var- ied impact on the considerable number of peo- ple whom they met and performed for over a number of years, and that in certain circles of both elite and ordinary Britons, they were very well regarded. Parsons makes a similar point in a more candid fashion within the context of Taaibosch's otherwise very brutal life. His description of Taaibosch's later years as a "sideshow artiste" with Ringling Bros. Barnum &amp; Bailey Circus cogently makes room for an alternate voice of "Clicko" as shaman, even within the overlay of structures of imperialism, racist paternalism, and ethnic stereotypes. The case of LoBagola is unique and research is still in progress, but the authors make it very clear that LoBagola's invention of his African persona enabled him to earn a living while enjoying a colorful and cosmopolitan life that would other- wise have been impossible for an American black man in the United States and Britain. These three essays are important and innovative works that balance the discourse on the display of exotic peoples, so that the impact is felt on either side of the stage and the disjuncture of the experience of modernity is shared. [] notes Notes, from page 25 [This article was accepted for publication in October 2000.] 1. Victor Turner, undated and unpublished manuscript, the University of Zambia. 2. Research by historians such as Joseph Miller (1969), archae- ologists including Carlos Ervedosa (1980), and others has also contributed to the body of documentation relevant to the peoples discussed here. 3. Although Jose Redinha in particular (1965, 1974) made major contributions to art history in the region, he focused mainly on collecting and cataloguing pieces, and to some extent describing them. Bastin was concerned with analyzing art styles and types, and identifying specific symbols that she interpreted with the aid of assistants. 4. Besides generally addressing style distinctions among these peoples, Bastin (1982:246-87) discusses a "style of the country of origin" and an "expansion style" meant to distin- guish nineteenth-century court art styles, mainly in figurative sculpture. 5. If one were to survey a number of museum and private col- lections, and published exhibition catalogues, it would appear that Chokwe and related peoples created only a handful of mask types. In fact they have a large repertoire of ancestral mask characters, most of which remain underdocumented. This situation is due in part to collectors' taste for wooden (vs. fiber and resin) examples. Wood is used in a selected number of character types including Pwo, Chihongo (male chiefly ancestor), and a few animals. Similarly, nineteenth-century royal figures have been the subject of several articles, although there is little or no documentation to explain their actual con- text and use. The more schematized hamba ancestral figures, another example, remain grossly understudied. 6. Some Lunda call the female character Mubanda, which also means "woman." Other names are also used. 7. The teeth recall the practice of teeth filing that was favored by the Chokwe. 8. Throughout her career, which spanned more than forty years, Mme. Bastin visited and studied a great number of museum collections, and almost everything Chokwe-related was in one way or another brought to her attention. I focus on her Dundo study here because it solidified the definitions of Pwo styles and meanings that still shape our approach to such masks. 9. For an excellent study of the Dundo museum-Portuguese colonial campaign in Angola, see Porto (1999). Dundo was established by the former Portuguese Companhia de Diamantes de Angola (Portuguese Diamond Company of Angola). 10. The sixty-seven fiber and resin masks apparently did not include any versions of Pwo made in those materials. 11. This defined style is applicable to other Chokwe anthro- pomorphic wooden masks such as Chihongo, the male coun- terpart of Pwo. 12. It is impossible to ascertain whether the Songo-collected example is actually Songo. It may very well have been carved by a Chokwe artist and bought by a Songo client. The oppo- site alternative is also possible, because masks in the same style have been documented among the Chokwe as well as the Songo. 13. Here Bastin applies an earlier definition of a Lunda style of carving (which she considers nonexistent) to the Lwena. 14. Baumann collected a number of pieces that he meant to take to Germany, but because of exportation restrictions they were left at the Dundo museum. He had earlier collected other excellent pieces that are now in Berlin. 15. A zoomorphic wooden sculpture (in my opinion a mask made to be placed atop the head as opposed to the face), excavated in central Angola and (carbon-14) dated to over 1,000 years ago, indicates an artistic tradition that predates the presence of Chokwe-related peoples in the same locale. The fact that zoomorphic masks, documented in the region since the nineteenth century, exhibit similar stylistic traits suggests a continuity that can be traced to an ancient, local model. That Chokwe became the dominant art emissaries does not mean they were the originators of particular art forms, types, and styles. 16. It may be argued that the image represents the illustra- tor's general or interpreted version of what the mask or mask performer actually looked like. However, given the large number of illustrations published by Carvalho, and the degree of detail in all the objects and scenes illustrated, I believe that the illustration is probably accurate. 17. Not all masks show scarification details. None or few scar- ifications often indicate that the character portrayed is a young person-in this case a young woman, or Mwana Pwo. 18. I base this observation on numerous examples I have seen in field performances in Zambia as well as on my study of over two hundred masks (several well documented, in private and museum collections) that are from the men- tioned regions and display similar stylistic traits (Felix &amp; Jordan 1998). 19. This. point is significant because it refutes the idea that more subtle styles are decadent or artistically less accom- plished versions of an older "classic" canon. 20. It certainly is important to document Chokwe styles in the Democratic Republic of the Congo as they may relate to those of neighbors such as the Mbangani, Luluwa, Pende, and others. 21. A selection of these pieces, made by master carvers for alrlcan arts * winter 2000</page><page sequence="12">export, is now housed at the Coimbra University in Portugal. 22. Wooden masks are commissioned from professional carvers at great cost. The fiber and resin, or soft, versions of masks may be constructed by any person who lears the skills in an initiation camp. They are therefore more common because they are relatively inexpensive, yet equally function- al as forms that relate to ancestral representation. 23. In fact masquerades bring forth similarly important cos- mological principles. 24. I do not mean to detract from White's immense contribu- tions to the study of these related peoples in Zambia. The fact remains, however, that he, like other scholars, did not carefully consider the role of masks in the context of mukanda initiations. 25. The word "clown" or "clowns" relates to aspects of akishi/makishi performances that are highly entertaining. Nevertheless the performances are very complex, and the demeanor of these characters changes according to specific ritual requirements. 26. These masks also perform during political rallies, chiefs' investitures or confirmatory ceremonies, and on other occasions. 27. The Lwena/Luvale and Lunda (in Zambia) in particular have had very prominent female chiefs. Some, like Southern Lunda female chief Nyakulenga in northwestern Zambia, continue to rule today with political powers that are equal to those of other male chiefs. References cited Areia, Manuel L.

NETTLETON: Notes, from page 39 [This article was accepted for publication in December 1998.] The research for this article was generously funded through a scholarship from the Standard Bank Foundation of African Art. A condensed version was presented at the College Art Association conference in Toronto in April 1997. 1. Some of the debates provoked by the exhibition appeared in newspaper reviews and subsequently in catalogue articles (Powell 1985, 1986; Richards 1990; Dell 1989). The show later toured Germany. 2. See Richards (1990) and Powell (1989) for critiques of this search for an African identity. This was not a new phenome- non in South African art circles: the Amadlozi group put together by Egon Ginther comprised artists (including one black artist, Sydney Kumalo) whose works were considered to display specifically "African" qualities. Most of them worked in very formal modernist styles. See Berman (1974:25-27) and Lissoos (1996:49-52) for brief outlines. 3. The unequal access to art training in South Africa has been frequently documented since Steven Sack's 1988 publication (see Rankin 1991), but most of this research has concentrated on urban or mission-based institutions. Most schools for blacks still do not provide any training in the visual arts, and even those black artists with a primary-school education have not had this most basic exposure to contemporary "Western" concepts of art. 4. The confusion over classifying rural artists is evident in Gavin Younge's Art of the South African Townships (1988), which includes many artists who live and work in rural areas and have limited contact with the townships. 5. The Northern Province, part of what was previously the Transvaal, includes the white farmlands from Louis Trichardt to Warmbaths and the homeland of Venda, and parts of the old homelands of Lebowa and Gazankulu, the rest of which are included in Mpumalanga Province. While the homelands were ethnically defined and often territorially fragmented, the new provinces are ostensibly not drawn on ethnic lines, although the recent struggles by residents of Acornhoek to be included in Mpumalanga have been suggested to be ethni- cally based. 6. See Nettleton (1992), Klopper (1992), Friedman (1992), and Schneider (1986) for a discussion of the ways in which "tra- ditional" material culture was used as an element of identity formation and reinforcement in the ethnic separation of peo- ples in South Africa. 7. Here I disagree with Rankin's suggestion (1990b:38) that only some works by these artists should be placed in a cate- gory separate from those produced by black (or other?) artists working within the mainstream. The works by individual artists cannot be separated from each other, and the fact remains that none of these rural artists has much theoretical underpinning to their production of objects. 8. This much debated topic has generally concentrated on early-twentieth-century primitivism in Europe (Torgovnick 1990; Price 1989; Rubin 1985; Miller 1991; Shiner 1994), but it remains a trope firmly embedded not only in a contemporary global consciousness of Africa's supposed backwardness but also any search for a "roots" alternative to those of Western civilization. See, for example, Honour's discussion of Euro- pean fascination with things Chinese (1961:5-29), which he traces back to Roman times. 9. See Nettleton (1989c) for a discussion of the attitude of the colonial powers in South Africa, both past and present, toward the development of artistic skills among black South Africans. 10. This, Mukhuba asserted, was done by "the govern- ment," but he refused to elaborate any further on the issue. Other members of the community interviewed at Tshakuma in 1979-80 claimed that there had been some complaints that Mukhuba was betraying local custom by selling these sculptures, something that remained an issue for him until his death. 11. His concern with notions of authenticity was further evi- denced in his founding of a troupe which performed "tradi- tional" dance and music; it was one of a few commissioned to play at the "Independence" celebrations of the then Venda homeland in 1981. He also formed a number of Marabi dance bands and recorded "seven-singles" for the local Venda mar- ket. His wife made "traditional" beadwork for band mem- bers to wear at performances. 12. In fieldwork conducted in the late 1970s to mid-1980s, I often found that older men in Venda and Gazankulu ap- proved of the homelands in principle. They saw them as a means of safeguarding their cultures against the Sotho-speak- ers, who were numerically dominant in the region, and as a bastion against encroachment by Western cultures. This view, then, was not held only by chiefs and others with a vested interest in maintaining traditional political structures. Younger people, however-both men and women-were less sure of the value of such ethnic traditionalism, seeing it not only as enmeshed in a system which restricted their chances in life but increasingly as belonging to an imposed set of reg- ulations in the apartheid state. 13. Venda-speakers tend to link conspicuous success with the use of nefarious methods, and one had to be careful not to challenge the authority or status of the nobility through an overly public display of wealth. Witchcraft accusations con- tinue to surface in the Northern Province and have been the subject of much media coverage in recent years (Dell 1989:49). 14. David Rossouw worked for Ditike in Venda in 1986-89. He suggests that this mistrust was occasioned by Mukhuba's experience with a Johannesburg-based art dealer who took some of his works to exhibit in New York but did not pay him (personal communication, April 23, 1998). 15. He also killed his wife and one child and set light to the storeroom in which he kept most of his works. His elder son, Gazland, was away from home at the time. Now also a practicing sculptor, he has been selling his father's works singly to individuals and institutions, not through agents or galleries. 16. In fact, the officials of Ditike defied the ethnic parameters of the Venda Development Corporation and spread its net wider to include artists from other ethnic groups and home- lands (Duncan 1994:72; David Rossouw, personal communi- cation, April 23,1998). 17. An example of this is seen in Kendell Geers's plea for sub- sidies or sponsorships for artists on the cutting edge of con- temporary art but whose work is difficult to sell (personal communication, April 22,1998). Geers, who wears the hats of both artist and art critic (for the Sunday Times in Johannes- burg), might be situated in the avant-garde of contemporary South African art, and he is also a consultant for Gencor Gallery. He believes that the art market system in South Africa (and beyond) encourages artists to produce works which are repetitive, and he disallows any distinction between the ways rural artists and avant-garde urban artists are cannibalized by the market (personal communication, April 22, 1998). Elsewhere, however, he has suggested that "Venda" carvers' works should be returned to the "craft" or "folk art" category (Geers 1997); he does not regard them in the same light as works by artists such as Durant Sihlali or Robert Hodgins. 18. Siebritz, who worked for Trent Read in 1993-95, esti- mates that Read must have bought 200-300 individual works from artists in the area, the majority from Owen and Goldwin Ndou, Paul Tavhana, Freddie Ramabulana, Noria Mabasa, and Johannes Maswanganyi. Duncan (1994:82-86) discusses the intervention of Read Contemporary and Trent Read, but her version differs slightly from those offered by other actors on the scene. Among rural artists' works exported by Everard Read Gallery in 1995 were pieces by Mabasa and by Owen and Goldwin Ndou, in which two strains could be distinguished: large-scale pieces calling on indigenous traditions for their subject matter, and single figures with a heavily satirical bent, as in the pieces by the Ndous. 19. The practice of showing wood carving and clay modeling by local artists in agricultural shows has a long history in rural South Africa, A number of artists came to the attention of government officials through this forum (e.g., see the dis- cussion of Asmon Mzila in Miles 1997:49). 20. Dell (1989:51) has discussed the difficulty of attributing to Mabasa any political imperative in producing these images. See Duncan (1994:43) for Linda Givon's explanation of the process of turning Mabasa's works into a political statement. 93</page></plain_text>
