KELLERT, Yale University, School of Forestry and Environmental Studies, 205 Prospect Street, New Haven, CT 06511 Abstract: This paper describes the importance of socioeconomic and perceptual factors in the management of endangered species. Most endangered species programs tend to emphasize biological assessments and technological solutions. Additionally, attempts to consider the societal context of endangerment are typically narrow in perspective and inclined to stress economic and monetary problems. Despite the mandate of the Endangered Species Act to consider aesthetic, ecological, educational, historical, recreational, and scientific values of wildlife, most endangered species efforts omit consideration of these values. The problem of assessing societal factors in endangered species programs is increasingly complicated when the imperiled species are invertebrates and the location of the problem is primarily in developing countries of the tropics. Unfortunately, the possibility of massive species extinctions will primarily involve invertebrate species in the tropics. This paper reviews some of these difficulties, particularly the differential perception of endangered species and the protection of endangered wildlife in developing countries. J. WILDL. MANAGE. 49(2):528-536 A compelling rationale and an effective strat- egy for protecting endangered species will re- quire an increasing recognition that most con- temporary extinction problems are the result of socioeconomic and political forces. This socio- economic basis of the problem is evident when assessing the causes of most species declines and should constitute an important consideration in the formulation of recovery efforts. The extinction and endangerment of most of Hawaii's endemic avifauna is a classic example of the importance of these social forces (Banko 1979, Berger 1981). In the majority of cases, human-related factors were the primary causes for the decline of these bird species. Principal factors included agriculture, grazing and for- estry-related habitat destruction, the impact of feral herbivores and carnivores, competition with introduced birds, and overharvesting for meat, sport, and feathers. Although Hawaii's endemic birdlife was biologically vulnerable to these impacts, socioeconomic forces, for the most part, created the contextual basis for this de- cline. The consideration, however, of social factors and human perceptions in most endangered species protection efforts is quite marginal (Yaf- fee 1982). The typical endangered species pro- gram emphasizes biological assessments and so- lutions. Perhaps this bias reflects the training of most wildlife professionals in the biological rather than social sciences and the hope for a technological solution to the problem. Perhaps it also reflects the enormous complexity of the issue when viewed in socioeconomic terms and the inherent political risks associated with any perspective that suggests the altering of social institutions and perceptions as an appropriate response to the problem. Most important of all, this biological and technological emphasis probably reflects an expedient response to the political pressures of a Congress and public that demand immediate remedial action rather than fundamental and long-term social and percep- tual solutions. An approach to the species preservation problem suggesting that its causes and solutions are woven into the fabric of modern society implicitly assumes the need to examine funda- mental social and perceptual forces. This per- spective is further suggested by the prospect of thousands of species extinctions during the next quarter century if contemporary rates of habi- tat destruction continue, particularly in the tropical moist forests (Myers 1979, Counc. on Environ. Quality 1980). The likelihood of this enormous species loss emphasizes the problem not as the case of a single species whose rarity engages our altruistic capacities, nor as the es- oteric preoccupation of academic scientists. This situation suggests, instead, that an effective re- sponse to this species-extinction crisis requires a fundamental assessment of the relationship between human society and the natural world. The objective of this paper is to review var- ious social and perceptual factors contributing to the contemporary endangered species prob- lem. The consideration of these factors should 528</page><page sequence="2">J. Wildl. Manage. 49(2):1985 SOCIAL AND PERCEPTUAL FACTORS * Kellert 529 facilitate additional understanding of the prob- lem and perhaps suggest strategies for mitigat- ing its impact. A basic assertion is that the en- dangered species problem is primarily a socioeconomic distortion involving a variety of attitudinal, social, and economic forces char- acteristic of contemporary life. VALUING ENDANGERED SPECIES A major deficiency in most endangered species protection efforts is an insufficient ap- preciation of people's perceptions of endan- gered wildlife, and an inadequate evaluation of the benefits society derives from these species. This problem manifests itself in two primary respects: an incomplete specification of the full range of values associated with endangered species, and a lack of empirical and numerical assessment of these values. This inadequate consideration of species-related values usually results in decisions that, by default, place great- er emphasis on monetary measures of benefits, typically serving the interests of economic de- velopment and resource exploitation. A first task is to identify the full range of values society derives from endangered wild- life. Previous research has suggested that at least seven discrete values can be specified and, to a limited extent, quantitatively assessed (King 1947, Kellert 1980a, Rolston 1981). These in- clude: (1) naturalistic/outdoor recreational val- ue-the appreciative benefits associated with direct contact or experience with endangered wildlife in the context of activities such as camping, hunting, birdwatching, etc.; (2) eco- logical value-the systemic importance of par- ticular endangered species and associated hab- itats to the well-being of interrelated flora and fauna, as well as to the maintenance of basic hydrological, soil, and other biogeochemical processes; (3) moral or existence value-the sig- nificance of particular endangered species based on presumptions regarding its inherent rights and spiritual importance; (4) scientific value-- the biological importance of imperiled species for advancing human knowledge and under- standing of the natural world; (5) aesthetic val- ue-the physical attractiveness and symbolic importance of specific threatened and vanish- ing species; (6) utilitarian value-the present usefulness and future practical benefit of par- ticular endangered species as sources of mate- rial well-being; (7) cultural, symbolic, and his- toric value-the importance of endangered species as expressions of unique societal expe- riences and specialized attachments; and, relat- edly, what might be called humanistic value- i.e., strong emotional affection for individual endangered animals. The entire range of these values has rarely been identified or adequately assessed in most conflict situations involving species preservation and diverse human activities. An example might illustrate this point-the Tellico Dam/snail darter (Percina tanasi) controversy. The snail darter is a 5-8-cm member of the perch family. Of approximately 130 darter (Etheostoma) species, 85-90 occur in the state of Tennessee. The snail darter was thought to be endangered by the construction of the Tellico Dam. Sub- sequent to the controversy, additional popula- tions of the snail darter were discovered, and the animal was removed from the endangered species list. For the purposes of this discussion, however, the earlier controversy is a useful il- lustration. A review of three documents-the Tennessee Valley Authority's cost/benefit analysis (1978), the General Accounting Office's (GAO) report to Congress (General Accounting Off. 1977), and the staff report of the Endangered Species Committee (Endangered Species Staff Rep. 1979)-revealed the difficulties involved in as- sessing the value of an endangered species and its habitat. The GAO report, for example, ig- nored the moral, ecological, aesthetic, scientific, and other noncommodity values associated with the area or the snail darter. The cost-benefit assessment focused almost entirely on dollar values associated with land and construction costs, bridges, dams, reservoirs, spillways, rec- reational expenditures, flood control benefits, power benefits, hunting and fishing expendi- tures, and water supply potential. Cultural and historical values were discussed to a limited ex- tent. The report was clearly biased toward com- modity values, and monetary measures domi- nated the assessment. The Endangered Species Committee recom- mended the dam not be completed, primarily on the basis of its quantitative assessment of construction costs, dam benefits, and flooding impacts. The dam nonetheless received bud- getary approval by Congress. The public and congressional debate particularly stressed the power-related benefits of the project which, given the energy-crisis mentality of the time, were especially persuasive.</page><page sequence="3">530 SOCIAL AND PERCEPTUAL FACTORS * Kellert J.

All other water use differences between approve and disapprove are highly significant, P = &lt;0.001. This difference in public susceptibility to varying project rationalizations that might en- danger a species is additionally reflected in the results of a national study of nearly 2,500 ran- domly selected Americans (Kellert 1980c). In a Tellico Dam/snail darter-related question, the majority of respondents expressed a willingness not to create a lake for recreational purposes or divert water for cooling industrial equipment if these projects endangered an obscure fish species (Table 1). If the project produced hy- droelectric, agricultural, or increased drinking supply benefits, however, the public over- whelmingly supported the development activ- ity regardless of its impact on the rare fish species. The snail darter controversy suggests that two factors primarily impede the assessment of the relative merits of societal activities that endan- ger a species' survival. First, a bias often exists in the minds of most analysts, the general pub- lic, and legislative decision-makers toward quantitative material benefits, especially if measurable in dollar terms and related to com- paratively critical human needs (e.g., food, en- ergy, jobs). Second, a tendency exists to under- state the risks of endangerment or extinction, because most species-related values are often incompletely specified and inadequately mea- sured. The need is to be more precise about the various benefits people derive from endangered species, as well as the values they associate with them. Until this assessment is sufficiently ac- complished, an inadequate basis will exist for making trade-offs between species preservation and socioeconomic development. If a more comprehensive evaluation of wildlife-related values is achieved before the preservation crisis becomes conflict-oriented, then the ability to make the protection case would be considerably enhanced. A thorough examination of the values people attach to protecting endangered wildlife might also reveal the surprising finding that greater support exists for species protection than is gen- erally presumed. Studies of the American pub- lic (Mitchell 1978, Kellert 1980b) have repeat- edly demonstrated that in various socioeconomic conflict situations, most Americans are willing to forgo diverse social benefits to protect certain endangered species. For example, a majority of Americans accepted substantial increases in en-</page><page sequence="4">J. Wildl. Manage. 49(2):1985 SOCIAL AND PERCEPTUAL FACTORS * Kellert 531 Table 2.

On the other hand, they were unwilling to render sacrifices on be- half of such imperiled species as an eastern in- digo snake (Drymarchon corais couperi), cave spider (Adelocosa anops), or a plant like the furbish lousewort (Pedicularius furbishiae). A primary need is to ensure that consider- ations of species preservation are not treated apart from fundamental socioeconomic deci- sions. The exclusion of such environmental as- sessments from most societal evaluations has historically been an important factor in the pro- cess leading to the decline and endangerment of many species. To regard our economic sys- tem as environmentally separate, independent, and superior is to invite the contextual basis for species degradation and decline. FACTORS IMPEDING SOCIAL AND PERCEPTUAL CONSIDERATIONS The ability to consider human attitudes and valuations of endangered species is seriously limited, however, by three characteristics of the contemporary extinction crisis. First, present rates of habitat destruction, particularly in the tropics, intimate the possibility of losing an ex- traordinary number of species, perhaps in the hundreds of thousands. Second, most endan- gered species are invertebrates, mainly insects. Third, this species loss will primarily occur in the developing countries, characterized by low per capita incomes, economic dependence on</page><page sequence="5">532 SOCIAL AND PERCEPTUAL FACTORS * Kellert J. Wildl. Manage. 49(2):1985 natural resources, and serious human overpop- ulation pressures. A primary problem arising from the pro- jected scale of species loss is that it renders dif- ficult valuations of species on a single-case basis. What might be a reasonable response to an in- dividual endangered species problem is typi- cally impractical when dealing with thousands of imperiled species. In this latter situation, the most feasible strategy might appear to be an ecosystem approach, focusing attention on pre- serving large geographic areas essential to the survival of many imperiled species. Although an ecosystem strategy might seem the most reasonable approach, any species pres- ervation effort is confronted with the necessity of convincing the public that such a problem warrants this degree of sacrifice. Species extinc- tions on a large scale, primarily affecting in- vertebrates (many unknown and only found in the tropics), constitute a class of environmental catastrophe not easily perceived. If people are to be persuaded of the necessity of saving species, they must first perceive the problem. From the perspective of what is important to the ordinary person, a single-species approach emphasizing biologically familiar animals may be an emotional and even ethical necessity. Fortunately, animals are hierarchically or- ganized in food chains, with many of the larg- est, most culturally meaningful species at the top of these energy pyramids. Experience has demonstrated the ability to rationalize the pro- tection of these culturally familiar animals and, in the process, obtain public support for estab- lishing habitat preserves. In this manner, the preservation of all species party to the same food webs as the target species can be accom- plished. The second major impediment to assessing the value of endangered species protection is that most of these species are invertebrates. It becomes necessary, as a consequence, to consid- er public perceptions of lower life forms, par- ticularly insects. T. J. Lovejoy (pers. commun.) somewhat facetiously labeled public bias against invertebrates "vertebrate chauvinism," reflect- ing the tendency of most people to view these species with a mixture of anxiety and disdain. This antipathy has some of its roots in cultural norms typically associating invertebrates, es- pecially insects, with irrational impulses, an in- ability to experience pain, and the absence of intelligence. Few people express much concern for the plight of endangered invertebrates, with the possible exception of species possessing excep- tional aesthetic or utilitarian value. The protec- tion of an endangered butterfly (diurnal Lepi- doptera) or bee (Apoidea), for example, is far easier to thrust on the general public than the preservation of a rare spider (Araneae) or worm (e.g., Oligochaeta). Few invertebrates possess much recreational, naturalistic, or humanistic value for the ordinary person. Invertebrates are also rarely awarded ethical consideration be- cause moral worth is typically based on pre- sumptions regarding an animal's capacity for experiencing pain or thought. Because inver- tebrates are not usually perceived as animals that experience, most people feel no particular ethical obligation to safeguard the welfare of these animals. Most biologists, however, regard inverte- brates as possessing considerable ecological and scientific value and emphasize the importance of their preservation on these grounds. For ex- ample, the contributions of invertebrates to nu- trient cycling, pollination, pest control, and seed dispersal have been cited (Pimentel 1975, Myers 1983) as essential to maintaining various food and energy chains, as well as in performing di- verse biochemical functions. Unfortunately, the average person only dimly recognizes these ecological and scientific benefits. These attitudes toward endangered inverte- brates emphasize the importance of utilitarian and aesthetic rationalizations in promoting their protection. Norton (1982) referred to this prag- matic emphasis as "anthropocentric utilitarian- ism." Because of the significance of utilitarian arguments in invertebrate species preservation, recent books by Myers (1979), Erhlich and Erhlich (1981), and the Congressional testimo- nies of Raven (1981) and Wilson (1981), are important in documenting the practical bene- fits of invertebrates for medicine, agriculture, and industry. Wilson (1981:370), for example, noted: "in reflecting on the preservation of species and genetic diversity, it is worth re- membering that..,. scientists have documented the vast opportunities offered by species varia- tion for the development of new crops, drugs, and renewable energy sources." The consideration of public attitudes toward endangered species inevitably leads to the dif- ficult issue of a perceptual calculus in assigning species preservation priorities. This possibility</page><page sequence="6">J. Wildl. Manage. 49(2):1985 SOCIAL AND PERCEPTUAL FACTORS * Kellert 533 is anathema to most scientists, although the public has little trouble in rendering such judg- ments. In this regard, people are most inclined to protect endangered species that are large, aesthetically attractive, phylogenetically simi- lar to human beings, and regarded as possessing the capacities for feeling, thought, and pain. Shepard (1978:233) referred to such species as the "phenomenologically" significant animals. A further assessment by Burghardt and Her- zog (1980) suggested four major factors as re- sponsible for these species preferences includ- ing factors associated with human benefits, and anthropomorphic, ecological, and psychological factors. Human benefit factors include an ani- mal's capacity to provide food, clothing, rec- reation, and companionship, as well as its threat to crops, property, and health. Important an- thropomorphic variables include the animal's capacity for experiencing pain, its cuteness, size, phylogenetic similarity to people, humanoid appearance, mental similarity, and unpleasant habits. Ecological factors include an animal's rarity and its contribution to diversity and eco- logical balance. Important psychological vari- ables are the animal's aesthetic characteristics, spiritual and religious associations, symbolic re- lationship with the wild, and the ability to tame, control, and mold an animal's behavior and personality. This information could suggest strategies of public persuasion necessary to generate support for protecting endangered wildlife or for mak- ing priority decisions regarding which species to protect. The latter possibility is likely to pro- duce considerable discomfort for most scientists because it suggests a nonbiological decision- making process. Additionally, this calculation would result in a far greater emphasis on the higher than lower life forms and would tend to institutionalize perceptual considerations in en- dangered species listing and recovery pro- grams. The counterargument for considering these factors is the realistic constraints confront- ing most species preservation efforts-i.e., most species are endangered not because of their bi- ological inadequacies, but because of a variety of human social, psychological, and cultural factors. The third social impediment to the devel- opment of an effective approach to endangered species protection is the scope of this problem in the tropical moist forests of developing coun- tries. Among the difficulties confronting these countries, which interfere with and prevent an adequate response to the extinction problem, are low per capita incomes, hard currency needs, dependence on raw materials for trade, overpopulation, and the lack of an organized wildlife management infrastructure. An additional problem is the relative absence of a well-defined "conservation ethic" in most developing countries (Lusigi 1981). This com- parative lack of an animal protection philoso- phy should not suggest, however, an unaware- ness or disrespect for wildlife. It reflects instead the absence of relatively affluent wildlife rec- reation and animal welfare constituencies which, in many Western nations (Cart 1971, Carson 1972, Reiger 1975) historically provided a voice for the protection of birds, domestic animals, and game species. Two other perspectives of animals appear to dominate in most developing countries. The first emphasizes the practical and material value of animals and is often rooted in subsistence-ori- ented economies. The other perspective implies a sense of awe and respect for animals, but largely in an abstract, idealized, and mystical manner. This latter attitude is typically ex- pressed in religious, mythical, and philosophi- cal terms, but usually exerts minor influence on the personal treatment or public management of wildlife. Nevertheless, both the utilitarian and mystical perspectives of animals should receive particular attention in species preservation ef- forts in developing countries. A major obstacle to the evolution of effective endangered species programs in most develop- ing nations is the depressed socioeconomic con- ditions of these countries. Widespread poverty and the need to exploit natural resources as a major income source often render species pres- ervation efforts an impractical luxury. Why should these countries defer the pursuit of eco- nomic opportunities for the sake of protecting largely obscure and mainly invertebrate species? Sacrifices of this scope tend to be unconvincing when the benefits derived are abstractly for- mulated, projected into an uncertain future, and dispersed to humanity in general. The primary difficulty is reconciling endan- gered species protection objectives with the re- source-dependent needs and utilitarian values of impoverished peoples. It may be necessary to link species protection concerns with the res- olution of socioeconomic problems such as low per capita incomes, rural underdevelopment,</page><page sequence="7">534 SOCIAL AND PERCEPTUAL FACTORS * Kellert J. Wildl. Manage. 49(2):1985 small-scale subsistence agriculture, nutritional deficiencies, high rates of population growth, large dependencies on primary product exports (e.g., minerals), the necessity of firewood for cooking and heat energy, and grossly inequi- table distributions of national income (Todero 1977). Species preservation efforts may have to be designed in ways that directly assist indige- nous populations rather than primarily serving the needs of foreign tourists, scientists from de- veloped nations, or a central government (Western 1982). These problems are illustrated by the expe- rience of Kenya, ironically, one of the few de- veloping nations to have derived major finan- cial gains from land and species preservation. Lusigi (1981:87) concluded that the very con- cept of species and nature preservation "as presently conceived is an alien and unaccept- able idea to the African population." Most sub- sistence-oriented Kenyans perceive the preser- vation of land and wildlife as a choice of animals and plants over people. Creating parks and pre- serving species as a means of promoting tourism is often viewed as taking land from local pop- ulations to enhance the pleasures of foreigners. Endangered species and land protection are, thus, regarded as a vestigal perpetuation of a colonial relationship between developed and developing nations. A variety of strategies have been suggested for resolving these problems and enhancing public support for species and land preservation in developing countries. One suggestion is fi- nancially compensating developing nations for socioeconomic losses associated with protecting endangered species. International aid agencies, for example, could administer incentive funds for protecting endangered species of important value. Myers (1979) additionally suggested a levy on multinational corporations that derive monetary benefits from natural resources of de- veloping nations-e.g., agribusiness, forestry, and mineral-related companies. A share of prof- its obtained from wildlife-related tourism could also be distributed to local peoples displaced by the creation of species reserves. The major challenge, however, is to incor- porate the socioeconomic needs and utilitarian values of developing nations into the establish- ment of species preservation programs. It may be necessary to include rather than exclude lo- cal peoples from protected areas, but somehow within the carrying capacity and renewable re- source limits of the land. This approach would emphasize the maintenance and even enhance- ment of living standards among indigenous populations as an accompanying objective of any endangered species and habitat protection program (Batisse 1980). This strategy could also permit subsistence use (e.g., hunting, livestock grazing) and economic development activities within the boundaries of protected areas, but subject to enforceable zoning and land use lim- itations (Halffter 1981). The success of endangered species efforts in developing countries will also depend on the emotional convictions of the general popula- tion. Local support potentially can be enhanced by active public involvement in the manage- ment of species preserves. In addition, concern for protecting endangered species could be pro- moted by emphasizing the relation of a devel- oping country's biological resources as a basis for national pride. In a world tending toward a homogenization of values and a consequent erosion of national identity, the uniqueness of a country's wildlife can be cited as a distin- guishing characteristic of a nation. A final consideration of endangered species efforts in developing countries is the nature of their economic relationship with developed na- tions. It would appear somewhat counterpro- ductive for developed nations to advocate species preservation in developing countries if their economic demands on these countries en- couraged excessive resource exploitation and species endangerment. As Clement (1979:12) noted: "It was partly to facilitate mining activ- ities by foreign capital that Brazil's trans-Amer- ican highway network was built; and it is partly to satisfy America's hamburger culture that cat- tlemen have displaced ... [tropical forests] of central America." Developed nations need to promote policies among their business and lending agencies that minimize habitat destruction and species loss in developing countries, while still recognizing the need for profits and sufficient economic returns on investments. A primary consideration is the extent to which international aid agencies, mul- tinational corporations, and commercial bank- ing institutions reveal concern for the environ- mental and species-related consequences of their actions. Some studies (Gladwin 1977, Johnson and Blake 1979), unfortunately, suggest only marginal attempts among such institutions to assess or mitigate the ecological impacts of their</page><page sequence="8">J. Wildl. Manage. 49(2):1985 SOCIAL AND PERCEPTUAL FACTORS * Kellert 535 various resource-related projects in developing countries. In a few situations where environ- mental factors were considered, the focus was almost exclusively on air, water, and solid waste pollution and rarely on the destruction of hab- itat or wildlife endangerment. The relationship of economic markets for wildlife-related products in developed nations with excessive species exploitation in develop- ing countries also needs to be considered. In- creasing technological access to remote global areas and swelling consumer demands in de- veloped countries have resulted in an interna- tional wildlife products trade estimated in ex- cess of $1 billion/year (King 1978). Despite the overwhelming importance of habitat destruc- tion in contemporary species losses, the wildlife products trade is cited (Intern. Union for Con- serv. of Nat. and Nat. Resour. 1980) as the pri- mary factor in 37% of all vertebrate species endangerments. The consumer demands of people in devel- oped nations largely account for the incentive to market these wildlife products. While an eth- ic of environmental appreciation has grown in most economically advanced countries, an iron- ic consequence of this new awareness has been an expanded interest in possessing wildlife products. A shift in demand from domestically raised furbearers to wild animal fur garments is one example of this attitude change. The Convention in International Trade in Endan- gered Species has discouraged the marketing of endangered species, although history has re- peatedly demonstrated that the existence of strong economic rewards typically results in the circumvention of regulatory controls (Matthies- sen 1959). The effective reduction of the wild- life product trade will require a change in the attitudinal basis of consumer demand. As Clement (1979:11) noted: "the new traffic in animals and their parts we need to confront and regulate is a byproduct of the jet age and the mass-consumption society. It is the result of un- educated affluence." MANAGEMENT IMPLICATIONS This review of social and perceptual factors associated with the endangered species prob- lem has suggested some possible strategies for confronting this issue. An important need is to articulate more effectively and to specify em- pirically the diverse values society derives from endangered wildlife. Relatedly, this values as- sessment should be consistently applied in trade- off situations involving choices between species protection and human socioeconomic develop- ment. People attach different values to the preser- vation of endangered species, and this variation may require systematic consideration in assign- ing species preservation priorities and imple- menting effective recovery programs. This con- trast is particularly striking when comparing public concern for protecting endangered ver- tebrate and invertebrate species. Unfortu- nately, most endangered wildlife are inverte- brates, and a need exists to develop a compelling rationale for invertebrate species protection based on prevailing attitudes. Species preser- vation efforts focusing on invertebrate animals should emphasize the aesthetic and especially utilitarian contributions of these species to hu- man economic and social well-being. Most endangered invertebrates exist in the tropical moist forests of less developed coun- tries. The needs and perceptions of people in these countries must be given special consid- eration in any global endangered species ef- forts. The dominant wildlife-related values of most developing countries are sacral/mystical and utilitarian. Endangered species programs in these countries should stress these values rather than Western-oriented endangered species concerns. Relatedly, the protection of endangered species in developing countries should link this effort with the fundamental ob- jectives of social and economic development. Additionally, economic dependencies between developing and developed countries that foster tropical habitat destruction and species extinc- tions should be minimized. Areas requiring at- tention include the exploitation of wildlife to serve consumer markets in developed nations and the financial practices of resource-based multinational corporations and lending institu- tions. Although this paper's emphasis has been somewhat pragmatic, the long-term solution to the global extinction crisis will depend as much on people developing a closer sense of personal and spiritual relatedness to the nonhuman world. The evolution of a conservation ethic and an empathetic concern for endangered wildlife are perhaps the major prerequisites of any success- ful species preservation effort. If this change in perception occurred, it would result in an</page><page sequence="9">536 SOCIAL AND PERCEPTUAL FACTORS * Kellert J. Wildl.

Extinction would be regarded not just as a reduction in biological options for cop- ing with an uncertain future but, more impor- tantly, as a reduction in the aesthetic, cultural, and spiritual opportunities humans crave in their quest to make life more meaningful and worth- while.
