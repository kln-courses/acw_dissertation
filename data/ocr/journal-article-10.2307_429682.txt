<plain_text><page sequence="1">ROGER A. SHINER The Mental Life of a Work of Art When we do philosophy we are like savages, primitive people, who hear the expressions of civilized men, put a false interpretation on them, and then draw the queerest conclu- sions from it. Wittgenstein, Philosophical Investigations, 194. I. At the end of his detailed and subtle study of the concept of expression,1 Alan Tormey refers to The prevalent assumption that a reference to expression in art is either (a) a reference to some- thing lying behind or beyond the work-a thought, feeling, mood or attitude to which the work stands in some external relation-or (b) a refer- ence to something immediately presented to per- ception as an aesthetic "surface." Let me introduce the terminology of "A- theories" and "B-theories" to refer to the philosophical approaches which proceed from one part or the other of this disjunc- tive assumption. A-theories would be char- acteristically associated with a Romanticism about expression in art, and about artistic criticism. Collingwood, Dewey, Ducasse, and others are uncontroversial examples of A-theorists.2 B-theories would be character- istically associated with a Formalist ap- proach both to art and to criticism. The term "surface" is specifically emphasized by Prall's analysis of expression,3 and Beards- ley refers to expressive qualities4 as "re- gional qualities" of the artwork.5 Discussions of expression in art do in- deed tend to oscillate between A-theories and B-theories, not the least, one imagines, because theories of both art itself and of artistic criticism tend to oscillate between Romanticism and Formalism. The initial theme of my paper is that both the exist- ROGER A. SHINER is professor of philosophy at the University of Alberta. ence and persistence of this seemingly in- soluble dispute about the nature of expres- sive qualities of artworks is caused by the unnoticed influence of a certain confused picture of the mind. I shall argue later (cf. pp. 260) that the influence of this picture is not the whole story, but it is a very impor- tant part of the story. This confused picture of the mind is dominant also in philosophy of mind itself. We must therefore turn to philosophy of mind and argue the point for a while there, before returning to aes- thetics. II. The false view of the mind I shall call the "Cartesian" view. I use that terminol- ogy more for intra-paper identification than for advancing historical scholarship, though I do not wish to ignore relevant connota- tions. I say "false view of the mind"; how- ever, it would be better to speak of a false view of the mind, the body, and the human being. To think of the mind in terms of the Cartesian view is also to have a certain view of the body and of what it is to be a human being. So I shall speak also of the Cartesian view of the body, and of the Car- tesian view of the human being. I shall also refer to any rival theory which takes its es- sential framework from the Cartesian view as also a Cartesian view. The reason for this is that I wish to emphasize as strongly as possible the common ground between the Cartesian view proper (as it were) and other views.</page><page sequence="2">SHIN ER According to the Cartesian view proper, the mind and its contents are ontologically separate from the body and its parts. More- over, the terms and concepts corresponding to the former are logically separate from the terms and concepts corresponding to the latter. That is to say, to attribute a feel- ing or emotion to some entity does not thereby commit one also to attributing some bodily state, whether active or passive, to that entity. Likewise, to attribute to some entity a state of the body, and in particular a pattern of behavior, does not thereby commit one also to attributing any mental state to that entity. The Cartesian concept of the mind is that mind can exist and be active independently of being em- bodied, and the Cartesian concept of the body is that it too can exist and move (be- have) independently of containing a mind. The mind and its contents belong to one network of causal relations and the body and its parts belong to another. The mind and the body are the two basic kinds; they are substances. The existence of neither one presupposes the existence of the other. The concept of a human being is not a primi- tive concept, but a derivative one. It is con- structed out of the joining together of the two prior concepts of body and mind, just as we in a commonsensical way construct the concept of centaur out of the concepts of man and horse, or the concept of mer- maid out of the concepts of woman and fish. We did not arrive at the concept of horse by abstraction from the concept of centaur; no more did we arrive at the con- cepts of mind and body by abstracting them from the concept of a human being. The wider notion of "Cartesian" that I wish to employ comes into play as follows. In this wider sense, the Idealist, the Ma- terialist, and the Behaviorist views of a hu- man being can also be called "Cartesian." The Idealist regards a human being as sim- ply equivalent to his mind, where "mind" is understood in the way that the Cartesian view proper understands the mind-that is, as a basic substance ontologically separate and conceptually distinct from the body. The Materialist by contrast regards a hu- man being as simply equivalent to his body, where "body" is understood in the way that the Cartesian view proper understands the body-that is, as a basic substance onto- logically separate and conceptually distinct from the mind. The Behaviorist does not in quite the same way reduce a human be- ing to his body. The Behaviorist does not explicitly deny that there is anything to a human being except the behaving "black box." Instead, he claims that the contents of the black box play no role in the analy- sis of the mental concepts that we apply to human beings. Everything we could ever want to say about the mental life of a hu- man being can be said in terms of the be- havior of his body; about everything else we must be silent. The concept of "body" employed here is the Cartesian concept, that is, of a substance which can, in prin- ciple, behave as it does whether or not it contains a Cartesian mind, and from the behavior of which no inferences can be made as to the existence within of a Car- tesian mind. I take this time to lay out the Cartesian view and its kin, because I wish to trace the insidious influence of the Cartesian view of the mind, the body, and the human being on aestheticians' discussions of expression in art. The view of expression I shall try to develop at the end of the paper presup- poses a different view of a human being, his mind, and body. I shall now try to sketch out this. The picture I oppose to the Cartesian picture is crystallized in Wittgenstein's re- mark that "only of a living human being and what resembles (behaves like) a living human being can one say: It has sensations; it sees; is blind; hears; is deaf; is conscious or unconscious. . . . Only of what behaves like a human being can one say that it has pains."6 Understanding this remark re- quires some reference to the wider back- ground of Wittgenstein's thought. His later work retains from his earlier period the no- tion of there being limits to language and thought, but the notion is enriched in that these limits are not constituted merely by the propositions of logic.7 There are other fundamental concepts and principles which form the "scaffolding" 8 of human under- 254</page><page sequence="3">The Mental Life of a Work of Art standing. The concept of a human being is one of these fundamental concepts. We do not learn first the concepts of mind and body, and then add them together to get the concept of a human being, as we learn the concepts of man and horse and add them to produce the concept of centaur. Rather we absorb from the very beginning the concept of a bodied creature with thoughts and feelings and consciousness, and only later with the emergence of self- consciousness develop the ability to distin- guish systematically between a human be- ing, the mind, and the body. As John Cook cogently argues (HB, pp. 121-28), the tradi- tional problem of other minds, given this background, cannot get a grip, because our concept of a human body is simply not that of a material substance which may or may not have sensations etc. inside it. The Cartesian concept of "body" is an extraor- dinary one of purely philosophical prove- nance. When we say "His body has a farm- er's tan, forearms but no more," we are not intending any contrast with his mind, which, like his chest, might have had a tan but, unlike his chest, is prevented by logic rath- er than his occupation from that destiny. The concept of a human being is the per- manent backdrop against which all our talk of thought and emotion, expression and sup- pression, sincerity and deceit takes place. As Wittgenstein has remarked, the human body is the best picture of the human soul (PI, p. 178). Our talk of the human mind, that is, is indeed ineluctably rooted in our observation of human behavior. But the move from human behavior to human mind is not a move from something tangible, certain and seen to something intangible, uncertain and unseen. It is simply a case of the application of one of the range of predicates we naturally learn to apply to other human beings as well as ourselves. To say that the human body is the best picture of the human soul is to draw atten- tion to a platitude about human beings which ,the Cartesian view in all its different forms obscures from us. As I have said, I am aware how sketchy the above is; reference must be made to other material for a fuller treatment. To 255 come closer to the matter in hand, let me now consider how the expression of emo- tion is to be dealt with. The Cartesian view regards expression as a bi-polar relation ob- taining between an "expressans" and "ex- pressandum."9 The "expressans" would typically be a gesture or utterance and the "expressandum" some feeling or emotion. The relation may be regarded as contin- gent or causal, or, more plausibly, as gov- erned by conventions. The mode of cogni- tion appropriate to the relation may take various forms-a guaranteed intuition, iden- tity (Behaviorism), an inductive inference (Physicalism), a noninductive, nondeduc- tive criterion. One must, however, reject all such theo- ries. The schema for the conceptual rules or conventions that govern here involves no relation. It is a schema for an entity which displays its anger, embarrassment, sympathy, grief, etc., in such-and-such a way, and for the "such-and-such" one fills in the relevant behavior both linguistic and nonlinguistic. To say of a gesture or a re- mark that it expresses sadness is to say that the gesture/remark is conventionally of the kind made by human beings who are sad and showing it. For a human being to be sad and showing it is simply for a certain kind of entity (one with a body and a mind) to be behaving in a certain kind of way as opposed to some other way. It is not for that entity to be behaving in one way with something inside it as opposed merely to be behaving in that way with nothing inside it (the supposed analysis of feigned expressions), nor is it for that en- tity to be behaving in one way with some- thing inside it as opposed to not behaving at all with that same thing inside it (the supposed analysis of suppressed emotions). The distinction between sincere and decep- tive expressions and the distinction between expressed and suppressed emotions are both simply a matter of one kind of pattern in the behavior of a human being (not of a Cartesian body) rather than another kind. I feel like saying here that the gesture or the remark does not really express the anger at all. That very form of words itself is redolent of the Cartesian view. Rather, the</page><page sequence="4">SHINER gesture or remark in an important sense is the anger, sadness, grief, etc. But of course that way of putting the matter is too Be- havioristic to be the last word. The thought that the gesture is the emotion is accurate, in that the emotion is not anything onto- logically separate from the gesture to which the gesture stands in some relationship called "expression." With those words I re- ject the Cartesian view. But the thought is misleading insofar as it seems to be stat- ing a form of Behaviorism, which is a part of the rejected Cartesian view. Why does the thought not express Behaviorism? The alternative to thinking of expression as a relation between two ontologically separate things is not to think of only one of those things and reduce expression to identity. The emotion is one thing and a human being's expressive behavior another thing simply in the sense that, humans being as they are, we need the resources to make distinctions between sincere and deceptive behavior. We need to be able to say that Arthur really does feel the anger he is ex- pressing while Bertram is only acting. Bu: we do not need, in order to draw this dis- tinction, either the Cartesian ontology or its Behaviorist sibling. The concept of a human being itself contains the conventions for distinguishing between sincere and de- ceptive human behavior. Given that the re- mark/gesture emanates from a human be- ing, and given that with the learning of language itself we learn that this is so, then the behavior either is the sincere expression of emotion or it is not, and applications of the conventions will, in principle, allow one to decide the matter. The Cartesian view licenses us to think that the campaign- ing politician on our doorstep might be literally, not merely metaphorically, a pup- pet or robot. Certainly, we might wonder whether he means what he says, but that is not of a piece with the Cartesian doubt. The latter is, while the former is not, meta- physical nonsense. I have tried in the preceding paragraphs to bring out the way that the concept of a human being structures our thought about emotion and its expression. It structures our thought in the sense that, in the appro- priate context, for a human being to be- have in a certain way just is for him or her to express emotion sincerely, and in another context the same behavior is an insincere or deceptive expression. What makes a ges- ture or remark sincere is not a relationship it bears to something outside itself. Rather it is a matter of it being one pattern in the behavior of a human being rather than an- other. But the pattern is in the behavior of a human being; that the behavior is the behavior of a human being is given,10 and not a conclusion which one has to draw on the basis of an investigation of the entity exhibiting the behavior. III. The analysis of expression in the previous section showed that expression was typi- cally regarded as a relation between two separate things, "expressans" and "expres- sandum." We shall find a similar pattern in aestheticians' remarks about expression in art. The very nature of art itself of course militates against a crude causal view. Words- worth, a thoroughly Romantic poet, still remarked that a poem is emotion recol- lected in tranquillity. But the idea that the link is causal is hard to shrug off. One finds it deep in Eliot's notion of the "objective correlative," 11 and the "artistic inevitabil- ity" he there talks about. This inevitability, as Stephen Spender has pointed out,12 seems to be construed by Eliot on a mechanical basis. Normal expressions of emotion are, one might say, gratuitous; the expression of emotion in good poetry is a determined causal consequence constituting the creative process. Emotion and artwork are onto- logically different entities linked by this chain of causation. We see the same Car- tesian dichotomy retained in the theories of philosophers despite the rejection of the causal model. Collingwood, Dewey, and Du- casse13 in various ways all distinguish the expression of emotion in art from the mere venting or discharging of psychological pres- sure. Common to all of these A-theories is the thought that the emotion is a separate entity which lies behind the work and to which the work is "organically related," to use Dewey's suggestive phrase. The initial difficulty with these A-theo- 256</page><page sequence="5">The Mental Life of a Work of Art ries, as Tormey has coercively argued, (CE, pp. 102-06) is that we have no clear idea what the relation being called "expression" is. It is supposed to be unlike the relation involved in venting emotion, and yet suffi- ciently akin to it to be called genuinely "expression." But how is one to try to rem- edy this supposed defect? As long as one preserves the fundamental strategy of the A-theory, one is under the Cartesian spell. The truth is that the A-theorists' attempts to explain a certain relationship fail, be- cause what they are trying to explain is not a relationship at all. As I have tried to show in the foregoing, a human emotion is not something separate that lies behind its expression and to which its expression is in some way related. A fortiori, artworks qua expressions are not entities separate from human emotions and to which emotions are in some strange way related. Given the kind of thing art is, we need a conceptual framework which will allow us to distin- guish between an artwork qua expression and the emotion it expresses, and that framework must take account of the differ- ence between artworks, as deliberate cre- ations, and gestures, facial expressions, and so forth. Thus there must be the kind of talk we find in A-theories about these dif- ferences. But we must try to break the hold of the Cartesian view of the mind and of a human being, and realize that investiga- tion of the characteristics of artworks as human responses does not mean investiga- tion of a mysterious relationship between one thing, the artwork, and another thing, a human emotion. Our concept of a human being is the concept of a creature which, given the requisite gifts, expresses its emo- tions in the special kind of behavior we call "artistic" just as it does in other kinds. This paper began with the opposition between A-theories of expression and B- theories of expression. B-theories are, as much as A-theories, under the influence of the Cartesian picture. B-theories of artistic expression are the analogues in aesthetics to behaviorism or materialism in philoso- phy of mind. The B-theories' approach to the expressive qualities of artworks sets great store by the insistence that for an art- work to have expressive qualities is not for it to bear some mysterious relation to some- thing else, some actual feeling lying behind it. Rather, it is simply for the artwork to have certain nonexpressive qualities in a certain configuration, certain regional qual- ities, a certain aesthetic surface, or what- ever. At this point, however, another element enters in, which causes a disanalogy between B-theories of expression in art and Behav- iorism in the philosophy of mind. The Be- haviorist can explain why we call a gesture or a remark "sad," e.g., in terms of the ges- ture/remark being part of the behavior on the basis of which we call human beings "sad": the behavior under the appropriate circumstances in fact constitutes the sad- ness. The B-theorist can pick up on this latter idea; he can say that the nonexpres- sive qualities of a piece of music or a poem constitute its sadness. But how is he to par- allel the former explanation, and say why it is that we call the poem "sad"? The word "sad" is presumably not idly chosen. If for the poem to be sad is simply for it to have features fl, f2, . . fii, why do we want to call a thing with that set of fea- tures "sad," rather than, say, "mournful," or "grim," or "jolly" even? In short, any account of the expressive qualities of art- works which reduces them to the nonex- pressive qualities of that artwork faces in a way that Behaviorism does not face what I shall call the homonymy problem. If to attribute sadness to an artwork is not to imply any relation at all to anything out- side the work, why call the work "sad"? Why does not the application of the term "sad" to a work simply become a matter of homonymous predication? Aristotle was wont to refer to the hand or the eye or other aspects of a painting or statue as be- ing hands or eyes in name only.14 He was wrong about that. But, as far as concerns the expressive qualities of artworks, the B- theorist cannot show Aristotle the error of his ways. IV. I have accused A-theorists of expression of trying to represent as a relation what is not a relation. I have also accused B-theories, 257</page><page sequence="6">SHINER or so it might seem, of trying to represent as not a relation what is in fact a relation. In fact, this way of putting what I have said so far is in important ways accurate. If the A-theory account of expression is the paradigm of what it is for an artwork to have expressive qualities via a relation, then I am denying that artworks have expressive qualities in that way. If the B-theory ac- count of expression is a paradigm of what it is for an artwork to have expressive qual- ities not via a relation, then I am denying that artworks have expressive qualities in that way also. This latter point, however, coupled with the introduction of the ho- monymy problem, raises issues which have not so far received much treatment, and I must turn now to those. The two most recent sustained attempts to present a theory of expression in art, Tormey's in CE and Sircello's in MA, are both conceived by their sponsors as alter- natives to the familiar A- and B-theories. We now have some idea of the standard by which these two attempts should be judged. We must consider how far these new theo- ries are under the spell of the Cartesian view of the mind and the human being; we should also consider how far the two theo- ries solve the homonymy problem. Let us consider first Tormey's account. He argues (CE, p. 127) that the term "ex- pressive of 0" is an incomplete one-place predicate which, properly completed, is de- scriptive of some feature of an artwork. This feature, the expressive property, is (CE, p. 131) wholly constituted out of the nonexpressive properties of the artwork. "Wholly constituted" here is intended to mark a contrast between expressive quali- ties of artworks and expressive qualities of persons. In the case of persons, the expres- sive quality is not wholly constituted out of the behavior: there is also the ostensibly inner or private element. In the case of an artwork "expressive of 0" is a one-place nonrelational predicate just because, the expressive quality being wholly constituted out of the work's nonexpressive properties, there is no need to include a reference to anything beyond the artwork to which the expressive quality term implicitly refers. There is a need for such a reference in the case of expressive quality terms applied to the behavior of persons. The problem with this account is that it preserves both too much and too little of the analogy with the expressive behavior of persons. It preserves too much, in that it says expressive qualities of artworks are just like the expressive behavior of persons if the "inner" element is taken away. This idea quite clearly preserves the structure of the Cartesian view. Despite the qualifica- tion "ostensibly" (CE, p. 131), which pre- sumably is intended to leave open the ques- tion of whether there really is inner privacy in the proper Cartesian sense, the "inner element" has sufficient ontological status to exist "behind" the behavior, and for the behavior to be ontologically the same wheth- er the "inner element" exists or not. Tor- mey's view preserves too little of the anal- ogy with the expressive behavior of persons as follows. His account forces him to say that expressive qualities of artworks are those qualities of artworks whose names also designate intentional states of persons, (CE, pp. 128-29) and that is all he can say about the meaning-relations between, for exam- ple, "sad" as applied to a piece of music and "sad" as applied to Cassie's frame of mind. But the homonymy problem has to be dealt with, and Tormey's theory will not allow him to do so satisfactorily. Because Tormey cashes out the expressive quality in the case of artworks entirely in terms of constituent nonexpressive properties, he is left with "0a", a particular expressive pred- icate, as attributable to an artwork in vir- tue of one set of features, to a person in virtue of a quite different set of features, and no explanation of why this is not ho- monymous predication. Any attempt to un- derstand the expressiveness of art must make some reference to the expressiveness of human behavior in a more general sense. The question is, How is this reference to be construed? Tormey is confused here. A person, Tormey says, provides us with in- dependent evidence about his expressed in- tentional states by his avowals of his feel- ings or his subsequent behavior. Paintings remain silent, however, in the face of our 258</page><page sequence="7">The Mental Life of a Work of Art misjudgments and "disagreements over the expressive qualities of artworks remain es- sentially and necessarily open" (CE, pp. 134- 35). If, however, the expressiveness of hu- man behavior is understood as a relation between a behavioral surface and a feeling which is revealed, then no such disanalogy can be established. If we are thinking pre- philosophically, then no one ordinarily doubts that G.M. Hopkins's "Carrion Com- fort" expresses abject despair any more than they doubt that the bloody and screaming accident victim is in pain. Such doubts arise philosophically even in the case of such human behavior because of the influence of the Cartesian picture of the mind. If Tormey is to secure his disanalogy, he must extirpate those doubts. Here, no appeal to the way in which we ordinarily remove such doubts about the mind of another will work. The sceptic will never regard avow- als or subsequent behavior as providing un- shakeable evidence as to inner intentional states. Tormey must therefore presuppose either some special kind of valid inference to intentional states or a Behavioristic re- duction of intentional states to appropriate expressive behavior. If the former, then we have an A-theory of human expressiveness and no independent reason for denying this model to the expressiveness of art. If the latter, we have a B-theory of human ex- pressiveness and again no independent rea- son for denying this model to the expres- siveness of art. As long as one's analysis of the expressiveness of human behavior is conditioned by the picture of a surface of outer, public behavior and a core of inner private emotion, as Tormey's indeed is so conditioned, there simply is no third alter- native to A- and B-theories. V. Tormey's theory is best seen as a sophis- ticated version of the Formalist approach to expression in art. Sircello, on the other hand, makes clear in his introduction that the Romantic insistence on expression as the essence of art is an important truth about art. A Rylean Behaviorism about ex- pression "has discarded the baby with the bath water" (MA, p. 9); it must be replaced by a philosophy of mind which preserves the important truths Romanticism has sought, though with blameworthy unclar- ity, to present. While these plans are laud- able, their execution is ultimately unsuc- cessful, and this is so because Sircello ends up too close to a view like Tormey's. The key notion in Sircello's account of expression is that of an "artistic act." "Ar- tistic acts" (MA, p. 25) are such things as viewing, observing, treating, portraying, commenting, presenting. Sircello claims (MA, pp. 35-36) to demonstrate that "pre- cisely in virtue of their artistic acts and of the similarity they bear to common kinds of expression, works of art may serve as ex- pressions of those feelings, emotions, atti- tudes, moods, and/or personal characteris- tics of their creator which are designated by the anthropomorphic predicates appli- cable to the artworks themselves." That is, to mention a couple of his examples, Pous- sin's The Rape of the Sabine Women is aloof and detached because Poussin calmly observes the violent scene and paints it in an aloof, detached way (MA, p. 25). "The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock" is a com- passionate poem because Eliot compassion- ately portrays the plight of his "hero" (ibid). Sircello says he does not intend the nomenclature "artistic act" to have any metaphysical import, that artistic acts should not be held to belong to a category prop- erly called "acts" (MA, p. 26). The grounds for the description of the artistic act in the painting or poem come from within it (MA, p. 27), and the acts are not identifiable or describable independently of the works "in" which they are done (MA, p. 29). None- theless, artistic acts are, he insists, acts of the artist and not of the artworks them- selves, and thus the artworks serve as ex- pressions of the artist's feeling in the sense the Romantic requires. This seems to me an impossible combi- nation of claims. Sircello on the one hand wants to preserve a fundamentally Roman- tic approach to expression in art. He there- fore wants an analysis of the use of expres- sive quality terms to include some refer- ence to the artist. On the other hand, as 259</page><page sequence="8">SHINER he acknowledges, talk of expressive quali- ties of artworks is talk about the features of the artworks. Thus there is pull in the direction both of a standard A-theory and of a standard B-theory. Sircello's concept of an artistic act is designed to avoid the po- tential problems. He roundly declares that statements about artistic acts are statements both about the work and about the artist (MA, p. 27). The concept of an "artistic act," on behalf of Sircello's Romanticism, is sup- posed to avoid both the total separateness of the expressed feeling that is associated with traditional Romanticism and A-theo- ries and the ignoring of the artist charac- teristic of Formalism and B-theories, while nonetheless embodying the core of truth in both-that reference to the expressive quali- ties of an artwork is in some sense reference to qualities of the artwork itself and that expressiveness is primarily a property of human responses. Sircello's position, however, is in its own way as unstable and unsatisfactory as Tor- mey's. Sircello no more than Tormey has an adequate answer to the homonymy prob- lem. His implicit answer to the homonymy problem is that expressive quality terms are applied to artworks in virtue of the artistic act performed in them; however, reference to the artistic act is reference to the artist, for artistic acts are human behavior. But we must recall Sircello's assertion that ar- tistic acts do not belong to some special category of act and have no metaphysical status. Given this metaphysically sterile ac- count of them, I do not see how they are other than acts in name only. If artistic acts do not belong to some special category of act, then a more compelling account of them seems to be in Formalist terms of the usual B-theory kind. If Poussin expressed aloofness or Eliot compassion in a way that does not belong to the normal class of ex- pressions of aloofness or compassion, then how do the predicates "aloof" and "com- passionate" attach to the respective art- works in a way that preserves a nonho- monyous connection with human feeling? Sircello cannot answer this question, as long as he makes the expression ontologically separate from the emotion being expressed and searches for some explicit link between the two. As with Tormey, as long as that basic Cartesian structure is preserved, only an unstable position will result. VI. One possible solution to these difficulties is, with Colin Lyas, simply to declare a "fundamental parting of the ways"15 be- tween Romanticism and Formalism, be- tween those for whom it is vital to construe art as an expression of human feeling and those for whom it is not. An alternative is to say merely that the Romantic focusses on some cases and the Formalist on others. But either of these results is hopelessly anticli- mactic. The resolution I am searching for is, I would like to think, more substantial. Consider Bouwsma and his idea that mu- sic is sad because it has some of the char- acteristics of people who are sad.16 One strength of Bouwsma's position which we can now notice is that he does offer a solu- tion to the homonymy problem. We call a person "sad" because of certain character- istics of that person; when a piece of music has those very same characteristics, we call it "sad" too. But of course this idea, taken as literally as Bouwsma seems to take it, is absurd. But suppose that one takes it more abstractly, as Langer does. Langer's theory, originally developed only for music,17 and later extended to all forms of art,18 postu- lates an isomorphism between the work of art and the emotion it is expressing. The emotional life of human beings and the artworks which express that life share sig- nificant forms. The artist expresses, not some emotion he is actually feeling, but "the forms of sentience as he understands them" (FF, p. 28). Langer's theory can thus be seen as a highly sophisticated and complex version of Bouwsma's. For her too, music is sad be- cause it has some of the characteristics of people who are sad. This latter notion, however, is spelled out at great length in terms of isomorphism of significant form. What assessment is one to make of her theory? It cannot be denied that she faces head on the homonymy problem. More- 260</page><page sequence="9">The Mental Life of a Work of Art over, she faces it from within a framework which is neither a standard A-theory nor a standard B-theory. She explicitly rejects A- theories as typified by Collingwood and also B-theories as typified by Prall,19 and indeed for her the expressiveness of art is neither a matter of a relation to an external feeling nor of simply the nonexpressive fea- tures of the artwork. Nonetheless, she still makes another unquestioned assumption, which must be questioned. This assumption has been combined in all the views con- sidered so far with the assumption of a Cartesian view of the mind. It is not in- tegral to Langer's theory of artistic expres- sion that mind be understood in the Car- tesian sense. We can therefore see in an unobscured way this further assumption op- erating in her theory. The assumption is this-that the use of expressive quality terms in artistic descrip,tion must be under- stood as a derivative use of those terms, de- rivative from the fundamental use in the ascription of feelings and so forth to per- sons. It is implicit that, if the expressive quality term is applied thus derivatively, the predication is nonetheless not homony- mous, and thus the homonymy problem is thereby supposedly solved. Langer expresses this idea in her declaration that art is the creation of forms symbolic of human feel- ing, (FF, p. 40) "symbol" being for her sys- tematically different from "sign" in indi- cating a logical or conceptual, not a causal, relationship (cf. FF, pp. 23-32). One could take a line with this position comparable to the one taken here with Tormey and Sircello. The acceptability of Langer's theory from the point of view of traditional accounts of expression depends on the extent to which she can make sense in detail of the postulated isomorphism. Often, however, her language at crucial points lapses into pure rhetoric and mys- tery. However, if I left my criticism there, one would be sorely tempted to think I was simply registering my emotional hos- tility to the very idea of swimming com- fortably in Langer's sea of metaphor. In fact, I want to press a deeper and altogether more important objection. If this objection is cogent, it will cut against any thought of regarding as derivative descriptions of art- works by means of expressive quality terms. The objection is this. By insisting on the primacy of descriptions in these terms of humans, one gives the following impres- sion. Mankind has through the ages devel- oped this rich and complex emotional life. Then, when this development was com- plete, along came artists with their unique talents for producing objects (in a broad sense), the nature of which, it turns out, was enormously illuminated by the exten- sion to those objects of expressive quality terms. This picture omits a vitally impor- tant element of expression in art, an ele- ment which Collingwood has so valuably emphasized. Collingwood time and time again insists that the art of expressing is the exploration of emotion.20 Expression, he says, "individualizes," whereas descrip- tion only generalizes (PA, p. 112). Express- ing an emotion has something to do with being conscious of it (PA, p. 113). The role of expression in art, in other words, is not simply to reflect passively an already exist- ing rich emotional life. It is in part actively to enrich that emotional life by creating new instances of its expression. The artist is trying to come to grips with emotions whose individuality transcends existing at- tempts to capture them by normal descrip- tion. When he is successful, it is because we see a new expression and a new emo- tion, not because we see how faithfully he has reflected what we already understand. This deep truth in Romanticism is ob- scured by any form of the insistence that artworks have expressive qualities only de- rivatively. VII. At this point, one may be tempted to throw up one's hands helplessly and say "How can one not think of the use as de- rivative, for it just is derivative. Sadness is primarily a quality of persons and second- arily of their behaviour and the results of their behaviour such as artworks."21 That seems an entirely natural thing to say. The rest of my paper is devoted to showing how such a natural idea produces unnatural re- 261</page><page sequence="10">SHINER suits when it gets into the hands of philoso- phers. Langer declares that art is the cre- ation of forms symbolic of human feeling (FF, p. 40). If I had to state my own view of expression in art in a catchy slogan, it would be this-"Art is the creation of forms of human feeling." Let me try to explain this. Here is a long, but important, quota- tion from Wittgenstein (Notes, pp. 303-04): But couldn't one say that if I speak of a man's angry voice, meaning that he was angry, and again of his angry voice, not meaning that he was angry, in the first case the meaning of the descrip- tion of his voice was much further reaching than in the second case? I will admit that our descrip- tion in the first case doesn't omit anything and is as complete as though we had said that he really was angry-but somehow the meaning of the ex- pression then reaches below the surface. But how does it do that? The answer to this would be an explanation of the two uses of the expression. But how could this explanation reach under the surface? It is an explanation about symbols and it states in which cases these symbols are used. But how does it characterize these cases? Can it in the end do more than distinguish two expressions? i.e., describe a game with two expressions? "Then is there nothing under the surface?!" But I said that I was going to distinguish two expressions, one for the 'surface' and one for 'what is below the surface'-only remember that these expressions themselves correspond just to a picture, not to its usage. It is just as misleading to say that there is just the surface and nothing underneath it, as that there is something below the surface and that there isn't just the surface. Because we naturally use this picture to express the distinction between 'on the surface' and 'below the surface.' Because once we make use of the picture of the 'surface' it is most natural to express with it the distinction as on and below the surface. But we misapply the picture if we ask whether both cases are or aren't on the surface. Wittgenstein's point is this. Suppose we try without grinding philosophical axes to give an explanation of the kind he mentions. We might say, "When I use the phrase 'George's voice was angry,' meaning George was angry, my remark reaches under the surface in that it talks about George and not merely his voice. But when I say 'George's voice was angry, but there was a twinkle in his eyes and he gave her the ice-cream anyway,' I am not in the same way reaching beyond George's tone of voice to his state of mind; I am simply describ- ing George's tone of voice, leaving it open whether he was really angry or not." Sup- pose now the philosopher says, "But this does not really explain what is meant by 'under the surface.' It does not really ex- plain what it is that is under the surface, and why it is reached in the one case and not in the other." Indeed not-but who said that there had to be any such explana- tion? The picture we carry with the use of the word "surface" is that of the mine of- fice staff on the surface and the coal-diggers beneath, the cucumber lying on the surface and the potato hidden beneath. But philos- ophers then use that picture in order to give an account of the difference between two ways of speaking about an angry voice. The picture suddenly develops a life of its own, so that philosophers become con- strained to interpret every aspect of the mental life of human beings in terms of the picture.22 In truth, however, the ex- pressions, as Wittgenstein cryptically puts it, correspond just to a picture, not to its usage, and in particular not to the use of the picture made by philosophers. One can use the picture to express a Cartesian view of the mind, if one already has one. But the usefulness of the picture in making the distinction in question between two uses of the phrase "His voice was angry" does not commit anyone who employs it for that limited purpose to a Cartesian view of the mind. The picture is misapplied if one tries to use it for more than its original appli- cation. As Wittgenstein puts it (Notes, p. 280), "we must get clear about how the metaphor of revealing (outside and inside) is actually applied by us; otherwise we shall be tempted to look for an inside behind that which in our metaphor is the inside." We use the metaphor ("He was seething inside") to characterize in a certain way what is unexpressed or suppressed. But the suppressed emotion which is appropriately termed "inside" in our metaphor is not for that reason part of a Cartesian inner life which goes on unseen behind behavior. In sketching out earlier (pp. 254ff.) Witt- genstein's view of human beings, I empha- sized the ultimacy of the concept of a hu- man being, that it was a concept which 262</page><page sequence="11">The Mental Life of a Work of Art structured our thought and was not a con- struction from it. That idea underlies the distinction between the two language-games that Wittgenstein speaks of in the passage under discussion. These are (i) the language- game of using "George's voice is angry" to talk indifferently about George and his voice, and (ii) the language-game of using "George's voice was angry" to talk about George's voice, leaving it open whether George himself was angry. Wittgenstein in fact presents the distinction as one between two ways of speaking of a man's angry voice. Suppose one objects to this, and says, "No, the distinction is between speaking about an angry man and speaking about an angry voice." This response misses Wittgenstein's point in an extremely illuminating way. For the response embodies precisely the Cartesian-style distinction that Wittgen- stein is trying to combat, viz. the systematic distinction between a person and his be- havior. Indeed there is language-game (ii), the well established language-game of tak- ing the terms which apply to human states and qualities of mind and applying them to human behavior considered in abstrac- tion from those states and quali,ties. Why do we call the tone of George's voice "an- gry" in this language-game? As long as one is not a philosopher in the grip of the Car- tesian picture of the mind, one requires no further explanation than that the tone of George's voice is the tone of voice conven- tionally characteristic of people who are angry and are expressing their anger. The Cartesian view both takes the second lan- guage-game as the primary one and inter- prets it as a language-game in which terms are applied in a way which leaves it open not merely whether George is angry but even whether George is a human being at all. The Cartesian view then represents the first language-game as one in which we both use the phrase "George's voice was angry" in the way in which we use it in the second language-game and make some kind of epistemologically contentious infer- ence as to George's state of mind. Wittgen- stein, on the other hand, makes the first language-game primary, and characterizes that language-game as one in which it is 263 meaningless to insist on the distinction be- tween the expressive behavior and the state of mind, meaningless ultimately because of the way that the concept of a human being structures our thought. The second case presupposes some conceptual distinction be- tween an angry voice and anger itself. Witt- genstein aims to hold talk of the distinction right there, and not allow either notion to be subjected to a Cartesian interpretation. In the second case, we could be using "George's voice is angry" to report evidence as to George's state of mind, but the exist- ence of this fact does not imply the Carte- sian dichotomy between the body and the mind. In the first language-game, we are not reporting evidence as to George's state of mind at all; we are reporting George's state of mind. Certainly, one might say that the first use carries a commitment that the second does not carry. But this commit- ment does not have to be cashed out in Cartesian terms, and the first use is not ana- lyzable into the second use plus this com- mitment. It is a different use, in the analy- sis of which the second use does not appear as a component separable either materially or conceptually. The concept of a human being is the concept of an entity which nor- mally (conceptually, not statistically) re- veals its mental life in its behavior, and this fact is reflected in the first language- game. In that first language-game, the pos- sibility of the expression not having the feeling behind it cannot enter in (cf. Notes, p. 293). The concept of a human being shows this feature of the deep grammar of that language-game. When we move to the realm of expres- siveness in art, we move to a vastly richer, more complex and highly crafted realm of human responses. The difficulty in seeing artworks as expressions of human responses may seem more acute, but the philosophical issues are in the end analogous. One may have the idea that there is something mis- leading in talk of a "surface" to expressive behavior. This idea gets some of its attrac- tion from the fact that this "surface" can- not in fact be peeled off. But consider the actor who peels off his make-up mask and leaves it on his dresser. The expressiveness</page><page sequence="12">SHINER of the mask achieves an independence from the feelings the actor projects by means of it in his performance. Artworks seem to have similar independence, and thus a simi- lar distance from any emotions of the artist felt while creating them, a distance which is not possessed by George's angry face. This difference between masks and art- works on the one hand and facial expres- sions on the other hand is irrelevant. The important analogy is that either case may be the subject of Wittgenstein's two lan- guage-games. To call Coleridge's "The Dungeon" an angry poem is to make a move in the second language-game; it is simply to say that the poem expresses anger at prisons and their effects on their inhabi- tants. It does that, because, like the tone of George's voice, its text conforms to the conventions; the text consists of words char- acteristically used by human beings express- ing anger. Suppose that we now go on to ask, "Is it Coleridge's anger that is being expressed?" We deal with this question in different ways, according as to whether we are participating in the first or second lan- guage-game. If we are participating in the first language-game, and the Romantic ap- proach to art and to criticism encourages us to do this, then there is no significant distinction between the question about the poem and the question about Coleridge. To provide a justification from within the text for calling the poem angry because of its tone is to show that it is Coleridge's anger. The introduction of the biographical ques- tion as a question in its own right is the move from the first language-game to the second. But now the biographical question is settleable in principle in the way that the corresponding question about George's anger is settleable-namely, by employing the conventions built into our concept of a human being. The Formalist approach to art and to criticism encourages us to play the second language-game, to exploit the distinction in that language-game between an expression and the feeling expressed. The fact that simply this is the difference between Romanticist and Formalist ap- proaches is obscured by Cartesian influ- ences. As a result, the Romantic takes the A-theory line of insisting that expression reaches beyond the surface of the work to a real feeling in the artist, while the For- malist takes the B-theory line of restricting expression to the surface of the work alone. The Romantic emphasizes the impossibility of thinking that artists systematically ex- press emotions they do not feel; the For- malist emphasizes the independence of the artwork. One can however retain both of these truths and avoid a retreat to the A- and B-theories which represent one or the other emphasis exclusively. The successful use of expressive quality terms to illuminate works of art is underwritten by the (philosophi- cally) boring fact that part of the natural history of human beings is the expression of emotion in a particular deliberate and articulated form, namely, in the creation of works of art. To paraphrase Wittgenstein (cf. p.257 above), only of a living human be- ing and of what resembles (behaves like) a living human being can one say: it cre- ates art. The expressive qualities of the art- work itself, as opposed to the expressions of human feeling which it might repre- sent,23 are there, not because the artwork symbolizes human feeling, or because it has certain properties the names of which are homonymously related to the correspond- ing names of expressions of human feeling. They are there because, quite simply, the artwork is a form of human feeling. The mental life of a human being is not some- thing separate which goes on behind hu- man behavior and which may or may not be concealed by human behavior, whether artistic behavior or nonartistic behavior. The mental life of a human being consists of behavior and interaction with its envi- ronment, including other human beings. The "behavior" I am talking about here is not the "colorless movements" of behavior- istic psychology; 24 it is already human be- havior. The primitive concept of a human being identifies certain human behavior both artistic and nonartistic as the expres- sion of mental states and qualities. The mental life of a work of art consists pre- 264</page><page sequence="13">The Mental Life of a Work of Art cisely in its being part of the mental life of a human being in the sense specified. The expressive qualities of a work of art are internal to it in the sense that the critic justifies the use of an expressive quality term by pointing to features of the work of art. The expressive qualities of a work of art are external to it in the sense that it is a human response, and applications to it of expressive quality terms by the critic are underwritten by the language-game of treat- ing the distinction between expression and feeling expressed as meaningless. It is true that artworks are independent objects, and in that way more like persons than the gestures and utterances of persons. It is also true that persons create artworks, as they may gesture and speak deliberately. But we should not forget Wittgenstein's em- phasis on the naturalness of speech, thought and action for human beings-and action here will include artistic creativity. The in- dependence of artworks, and indeed the whole dimension of our form of life which is the artistic, makes it inevitable that the normal use of expressive quality terms in aesthetic discourse is to apply them directly to the artwork. Aesthetic discourse is in this way idiosyncratic-like person-talk in being talk about independent objects and like ges- ture-talk in being about objects created by persons and not persons themselves. There is a temptation now to find what I have just said incoherent, and to seek an account of expression in art which resists assimilation either to persons or to gestures and utter- ances. But this temptation rests upon over- looking Wittgenstein's first language-game, in which to talk of a person's behavior is to talk of his feeling. That is the primary language-game both for talk about persons and for talk about their behavior. The sec- ond language-game is secondary and deriva- tive for talk about human behavior, because it is dependent upon another way of talk- ing about human behavior. Talk about the expressive qualities of artworks is talk about human creations, not human beings-but the sense of that distinction is captured by the first, not by the second, of the two lan- guage-games discussed.25 265 Just as I reject the whole framework pre- supposed by A- and B-theories of expression in art, rather than produce a refined ver- sion of one of them, so also I aim not to solve so much as dissolve the homonymy problem. The homonymy problem arises because one thinks of the application of expressive quality terms to persons as pri- mary and the application to their behavior as derivative. I have been arguing, however, that persons are not distinct from their be- havior in a way that allows the homonymy problem to be stated. This is as true for artworks as it is for utterances and gestures. We must be careful not to be seduced here by the spatial terminology in which phi- losophers typically talk about these issues. One hears talk of a "continuum of senses- sad person, sad face, sad music." "Sad mu- sic" is "further down" the continuum than "sad face." The question then becomes, "Is it so far down the continuum that it ceases to be a proper use of 'sad' at all?" The A- theories try to preserve a "closeness" to "sad person" by insisting on analogies with "sad face." The B-theories reject this line, but then find themselves "so far down" the continuum that they "end up" in a differ- ent literal use. Those who talk of the ap- plication of expressive quality terms to art- works as being "metaphorical" are in one sense rejecting the whole spatial picture, for it does not make sense to ask whether a cer- tain metaphorical use is closer to one literal use than is another literal use. But in an- other sense they reject the whole enterprise of trying to understand expression in art, and we do not want to follow them in that.26 The root problem is in the whole idea that "sad person," "sad face," "sad music" is a developing continuum, and that, in order to justify the third use, one must give some account relating it to the second use, as one justifies the second use by relating it to the first. But, as I have argued, the first use does not exist "by itself," and neither does the second. They co-exist in the way that Witt- genstein has tried to illuminate. The deep truth in Romanticism is indeed that art- works, like utterances and gestures, are hu- man responses, human expressions of feel-</page><page sequence="14">SHINER ing. But the influence of the Cartesian view of the mind on Romanticism causes it to conceal the equally deep truth that art- works, utterances, and gestures are the very stuff of human feeling, and not merely evi- dence for the existence of human feeling, whether by a dualistic or behavioristic in- ference. Wittgenstein once said of epistemology, "It is so difficult to find the beginning. Or, better: it is difficult to begin at the begin- ning. And not try to go further back" (OC, p. 471). This is also the problem with philos- ophers' accounts of expression in art. They are always, under the bewitchment of their intelligence by the Cartesian view of the mind, trying to go further back to the real feelings of the artist. The problems with doing this provoke the reaction that the artist is irrelevant. The point to realize is that the artwork itself is the real feeling of the artist, in the sense that the normal language-game with expressions of feeling is the first of Wittgenstein's two, that in which there is no meaningful distinction between expression and emotion. The art- work itself is of course not the real feeling of the artist in the sense that, as the sec- ond language-game shows, in principle any given expression of emotion may be feigned and not sincere. But the question of sin- cerity when asked of an artwork is purely biographical, and raises in the ordinary course of events no more philosophical dif- ficulties than the same biographical ques- tion when asked of an artist's nonartistic expressions. The question of whether a given expressive quality term is legitimately applicable to a given artwork is no differ- ent in principle from the question whether that term is legitimately applicable to some piece of nonartistic behavior. Of course, it may be said that applications of expressive quality terms to human nonartistic behav- ior is a matter of simple perception, and that, by contrast, the application of those terms to artworks requires discrimination. There is something to this contrast, and it is a something which is not affected by the following valid point. One can in fact over- do the emphasis on perception in the case of nonartistic expressions. In fact, it often requires great sensitivity and subtlety to read people's emotional states from their expressions, even when they are not dis- sembling. One manifestation of the depth of an emotional relationship is the posses- sion of this sensitivity with respect to each other's emotions. The claim is made, with more than a purely anecdotal foundation, that women as a whole are better at exer- cising this discrimination than men. But nonetheless, one still here would hardly talk of aesthetic discrimination. All that seems to follow, however, is that discrimi- nation of expressive qualities in artworks is a matter of discrimination within categor- ies;27 these categories are different from, albeit related to, those employed in the dis- crimination of expressive qualities in hu- man behavior. Cultural history conditions both the expressiveness of artworks and the perception of them in a way that it does not for the general categories of human emotion. But none of that affects the theory I am offering in this paper. Wittgenstein also said, "At some point one has to pass from explanation to mere description" (OC, para. 189). In philosophi- cal discussions of expression in art, I sub- mit, that point has now been reached. To understand further the nature of expression in art requires attention to critics' descrip- tions, and not to philosophers' explana- tions. The Concept of Expression (Princeton Univ. Press, 1971) (henceforth CE). 2 See Tormey, CE, Appendix for long quotations and full references. Albert Fell has put to me that Collingwood's position is much closer to mine than I here acknowledge.

However, he does not develop this idea at all, and indeed the theme of both papers is the re- habilitation of traditional Intentionalism and Per- sonalism in literary criticism.

These are human qualities" (p. 202; his italics). 22Cavell puts the point well-"We want to say that when we express our recognition of the other's pain we are recognizing not merely an expression but also that of which it is the expression; our words reach as immediately to the pain itself as to the behaviour-that, the pain itself, is what our words mean. What this says must be true, and yet one again feels on the brink of an old misunder- standing, taking the 'pain itself' and 'mere be- haviour' as two different things (though no doubt generally in the closest possible connection with one another)." (The Claim of Reason, p. 339). 23 This important distinction is well emphasized by Tormey (CE, pp. 138-39). 24 The phrase, from C. L. Hull's Principles of Behaviour, is quoted and discussed by Cook (HB, pp. 130ff). 25 Aldrich (op. cit, [n. 9], p. 214) makes a distinc- tion between two uses of expressive terms which looks very like the distinction made here. The argu- ment in his paper as a whole is, however, complex and allusive. If I understand it aright, the use he makes of the distinction is different. His point seems to be that "expressive" is logically redundant and moreover a misleading metaphor for qualities we perceive in artworks as straightforwardly as we per- ceive any quality in anything. Although I would agree that we do not need to postulate a special mode of perception for the expressive qualities of artworks, I am enough of a Romantic to want to retain some special connection between expressive qualities and the mental life of human beings. 261 apologize for dealing so summarily with an approach to expression that many will feel deserves fuller consideration. However, this paper is already long enough. Morever, any thorough discussion of this approach must deal with Goodman's account of expression as metaphorical exemplification (see Languages of Art [New York, 1968], pp. 85ff); that opens up issues of considerable complexity. As a gesture in the right direction, let me say just this by way of amplifying the text. An M-theory, as we might call it, as much as any other faces the hom- onymy problem. It also faces the following dilemma in trying to solve that problem. If the M-theorist has a powerful account of metaphor, an account, that is, which explains convincingly the generation of metaphors out of literal uses, then his theory collapses into a B-theory. If, on the other hand, the M-theorist insists on the ineffable creativity of meta- phor, the homonymy problem is simply restated. Goodman's answer to the homonymy problem is totally to ignore it, and the brilliance of the meta- phors he uses to explain metaphor must not disguise this from us. In his view, the use of any label can be explained ultimately only by habit, and a fortiori</page><page sequence="16">268 the use of expressive quality terms in talk about art- works. My own account of expression implies that Goodman is wrong on both counts; however, I can- not here debate further the philosophy of language. 27 For the philosophical significance of this notion, see Kendall Walton's rightly respected paper "Cate- gories of Art," The Philosophical Review, 79 (1970), 334-67. Earlier versions of the position defended in this paper have been read to the American Society for Aesthetics, the Western Canadian Philosophical Association, and the Canadian Philosophical Asso- ciation. I should like to thank my respective com- mentators-Alan Tormey, Petra von Morstein, and SHINER Albert Fell-and also Berel Lang for valuable crit- icism; also Judith Mitchell of the Department of English, University of Alberta, for many profitable discussions on this topic. My major debt is to my colleague Allen Carlson, who mercilessly exposed the problems and confusions in several very early versions, while mercifully encouraging me to pursue further the important line of argument which we both felt must be in there somewhere. So great, in fact, is the present paper's debt to Carlson that, had he shown even the slightest inclination to believe that what it said was true, I would have unhesitat- ingly co-opted him as a joint author. Some of the initial work on this paper was done during tenure of a Leave Fellowship from the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada.</page></plain_text>
