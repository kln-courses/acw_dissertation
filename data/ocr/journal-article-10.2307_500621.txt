BRADFORD WELLES, Editor PLATES XII-XXXI The Editor wishes to thank the various European contributors, who have given this report the excellence it possesses. Professor Brondsted submitted his manuscript in English; Professor Garcia y Bellido's was translated by Daniel E. Woods; the others have been translated by the Editor with the devoted help of his assistant, James F. English, Jr. It has not been possible to submit the final manuscripts to the contributors, and the re- sponsibility for the text devolves on the Editor. On the other hand, as many of the books and journals mentioned are not available in this country, it has not been possible to verify references systematically. It will be noted that several important European countries are not now represented. It is hoped that reports from these may be available for 1949. FRANCE By Paul-Marie Duval, Directeur des Etudes Gallo-Romaines a l'Ecole Pratique des Hautes Etudes (Sorbonne) D URING the war, the initiative of J. Car- copino and A. Grenier gave rise to legisla- tion, long needed, regarding excavations.1 As revised in 1945,2 the law divides the metro- politan territory (including Corsica) into two series of independent areas, one group of twelve being the great prehistoric regions, and the other, of nineteen, more restricted areas, being regions significant for classical antiquity (including the period of the invasions). At the head of each area is a regional director of antiquities, chosen from among the most competent archaeologists. These authorize and control excavations, public or private, in the name of the Fine Arts Administra- tion, and under the direction of its Excavation Commission, which includes experienced scholars in the field and architects of the historical monu- ments. Excavations are published by the Na- tional Center for Scientific Research in Gallia, fouilles et monuments archeologiques en France metropolitaine, edited by A. Grenier.3 A. PREHISTORIC GAUL, GREEK COLONIES, INDEPENDENT GAUL The oldest city of France, MARSEILLES, is be- ginning to be explored. The Germans had blasted with dynamite all of the "quartier du Vieux-Port" which covered the ancient city, and after their withdrawal excavations were under- taken and will continue as long as the recon- struction permits. Directed first by H. Rolland and later by F. Benoit, these searches have brought to light for the first time in France the remains of a Greek theater together with the pavement of the agora of the city, the Greek beach, and the Roman docks. These are con- structed, as at Ostia, of dolia (diameter 1.50 m.), many of which were found complete, and of masonry foundations. The Greek ramparts, whose location is unknown, have not yet been found nor has the primitive acropolis, but many potsherds dating from the beginning of the sixth century B.C. to the Roman period have already permitted the establishment of a very precise chronology. There was no native city on the site before the arrival of the Phocaeans. The city ex- tended to the east as far as Lacydon in the Roman period. Phocaean pottery, imported and local, and Attic pottery are well represented and furnish a basis of chronology for Gallia Graeca. The local product proves to have been of un- suspected importance. Two colonies of Marseilles have yielded less fruitful discoveries, as excavated by H. Rolland. 'A.

The southern section of the city, excavated particularly since 1942, will soon be completely cleared, with its three streets marking the limits of three insulae. One can distinguish three periods. Glanum I is a Greek city whose peristyle houses are ex- cellent examples of the Greek house in France, built of large blocks of stone. In 1945 and 1946 the remains of a large building with pediments were uncovered. With Glanum II (about 100-40 B.c.) there appear Roman houses with atriums more modest than the preceding and of small and irregular stone work. Glanum III (40 B.c.-to the end of the third century A.D.) is the Roman city, with its public monuments built of small, regular blocks of stone. There are baths of the Republican type with an asymmetrical plan, and a large monument with an apse, perhaps a temple. Although inscriptions have been found in rather large numbers' and although pottery from the sixth century B.C. is abundant,6 it is for the study of architecture that this excavation is important, presenting types of Greco-Roman buildings and modes of construction. At SAINT-BLAISE, in the delta of the Rh6ne, H. Rolland uncovered, in 1942, the Greek wall of another colony of Marseilles which was dis- covered in 1935 on a rocky promontory.7 This is the first Greek fortification known in France; constructed with magnificent, dressed stones, it dates from the fifth or fourth century B.c. and bears mason-marks in Greco-Punic characters representing numerals. It carries rounded mer- Ions, similar to those of Motye and Eryx in Sicily. One can study at Saint-Blaise the influ- ence of the Sicilian engineers, entering Gaul through the medium of Marseilles." Rolland is now engaged in excavating the city itself, whose history seems to stop at the end of the Greek period, resuming again only in Christian times. Two oppida where native influences predomi- nate have been the object of important excava- tions. The first, ENSERUNE (Herault), situated on an elongated ridge, was revealed by the dis- coveries of Mouret in 1916 and excavated by Abbe Sigal and J. Formig&amp;.9 Since 1944, it has been explored by J. Jannoray.10 The necropolis has yielded over four hundred tombs. The fur- niture of these shows three periods of occupation. The Iberian occupation of the fourth century is distinguished by a crematory urn in the form of an Iberian vase accompanied by weapons of La Tene I. The Iberian pottery, which is usually dated back as far as the fifth century, begins here only about 350 B.c. The Celtic occupation of the third century is marked by Italian or Celtic urns with black glaze. These tombs are super- posed on the first, which were often levelled off. In the period of the Roman occupation, in the second and first centuries B.c., the necropolis became a residential area. These excavations clarify for us the native funerary customs and chronology of the Iberian invasions of Gaul. ENTREMONT (Bouches-du-Rh6ne) is a Gallic oppidum destroyed by the Romans in 123 B.c. and replaced by Aquae Sextiae (Aix-en-Pro- vence), situated four kilometers away. In digging a trench in 1943, the Germans discovered some sculptured heads, now in the Museum of Aix. The excavations, begun by F. Benoit in 1945, have yielded numerous fragments of large statu- ary, squatting warriors, an equestrian statue, and separate heads, all belonging to a funerary group of a cultic nature. It is the first important statuary group antedating the Roman conquest which has been found in France. This sculpture seems to have escaped Greek influence. R. Lan- tier sees in it especially: "An attempt by the Celts to express their indefinite religious images in forms borrowed from Mediterranean Art."1' The excavations have also opened up a residen- 4 H.

F. Benoit is now excavating the city wall, remarkable for its construction in dry masonry, its towers with rounded corners, its postern with staircase, and an interior division separating an upper city (where the statuary was discovered) and a lower city. No necropolis has yet been discovered. Entremont, capital of the Gallic realm of the Salyens, is today the capi- tal of Celtic archaeology. Some Celtic necropoleis are the object of ex- cavations in Champagne directed by Brisson and Loppin12 who continue the exploration of that region. A necropolis of the "champs d'urnes" (Urnen- felder) type, discovered in 1937 at FONTAINES- SALVES, near VWzelay (Yonne), where Gallo- Roman baths were already known, is being ex- cavated by R. Louis and R. Dauvergne.13 This necropolis dates from the beginning of the first millennium. An extensive examination of prehistory in southwest Gaul has led Mlle. G. Fabre to estab- lish the fact that the Celts circled around the borders of Aquitaine and never occupied the in- terior, where Iberian influences maintained themselves.14 The two great Gallic sites of the period of in- dependence, Gergovia and Alesia, continue to be explored actively. At GERGOVIA, the excavations were resumed in 1941, under the direction of T. Lassus and J.-J. Hatt with the cooperation of their Strasbourg students who were refugees at Clermont-Ferrand and of the Pro Gergovia Committee.5" The west- ern Gallic city wall of dry masonry, a large building, and two Celtic temples were already known. To the south, the excavations un- earthed a very ancient dwelling, probably of the Hallstatt period. They have established the date of the construction of the wall at the end of the period of independence or the beginning of Gallo- Roman times. Since then, other excavations, directed by Hatt and later by Labrousse, have brought to light an Augustan dwelling in the center of the plateau, and traces of another wall cutting across the first. The Romans continued to utilize and to reenforce the system of fortifica- tions."1 At ALESIA, J. Toutain has been excavating actively since 1942.17 An edifice with a double colonnade of the Gallo-Roman period has been uncovered. A road, paved with stones and of the Gallic era, is in the process of excavation. B. GALLO-ROMAN PERIOD Since Roman civilization was essentially an urban one, research is now being centered on the cities. The attempt is being made to discover their plans, even on the sites where there are modern cities. As was the case at Marseilles, the destruction caused by the war occasionally ren- ders new discovery possible. The study of cities, and notably of fortifications, is being organized in all of France.'8 Caesar's fortifications were studied minutely at NOINTEL, in the Oise, with the aid of excava- tions made before the war;"1 it is now known what is meant by vallum (palisade, moat, agger, contre- agger) and the respective r6les of the castra, cas- tella, praesidia, burgi, turres. The differences between the urban fortifica- tions in Gaul and in Africa have been studied in relation to the African excavations. In Gaul may be noticed the absence of masonry stairs (due perhaps to the abundance of wood in this coun- try), the rarity of the double wall (made up of two contemporary, joined walls), the absence of the citadel, and the presence of reused materials in the walls of the later Empire.20 One of the most important excavations at present has been opened at BAVAI (Nord) as a 12 M.

Bavai had al- ready yielded important series of pottery. Abbe Biyvelet has discovered a new section of the city wall, and an immense portico, seventy meters long.2 This building is one of the largest known in France, and excavation is continuing. The classification of ceramic collections, very impor- tant for the history of the north of Gaul and of Roman Belgium, has been undertaken. At PARIs, the digging of shelters in the garden of the Museum of Cluny in 1940 brought to light the unknown parts of the only well-pre- served monument of Lutetia, the "Palais des Thermes." The excavations undertaken in 1946 have exposed the northern facade of the edifice, with a large, rectangular chamber and a broad entrance in the center of the facade. The excava- tions which are going forward at the present time have as their aim to discover the complete plan of the monument in order to clarify its still un- known purpose; there is a strong presumption in favor of baths. Some parts of the construction which are remarkably well preserved permit us, perhaps, to find an approximate date in the third or even the second century A.D. Finally the prows of ships which adorn the large room have for the first time been measured and studied. They are to be connected with the corporation of the Nautae Parisiani.2 At SENLIS, Matherat is pursuing the explora- tion of the city on the central hill. The outline of the city wall of the later Empire is disclosed by the excavation of several towers and of a princi- pal gate. At the summit of the hill, a tower and curtain wall dating from the beginning of the Roman occupation have been discovered, while a rectangular edifice whose date is still doubtful is the object of careful excavation. The unified plan of a city of the Early Empire, whose check- erboard outline has been in part preserved until our time, is beginning to be established with certainty.23 At LYoNS, Wuilleumier has found the outline of the principal streets,24 and has brought to light on the hill of Fourviere the great Roman theater and, at the side, a small odeion whose orchestra has its stone pavement preserved. The area be- tween these two neighboring monuments is being excavated at the present time and has yielded some Roman statues of good quality. At VAISON-LA-ROMAINE, Canon Sautel is ac- tively continuing the clearing of the city. One can study there well preserved Roman houses grouped in different types of insulae.25 At VIENNE (Isere), the theater, except for the stage, has been entirely uncovered. At the top of the cavea was discovered a cultic edifice con- nected with the dramatic performances. At ARLES, F. Benoit has uncovered a little- known portion of the wall.26 The large cryptopor- ticus continues to be explored. On the other bank of the Rhone, the suburb of Trinquetaille is at the present moment the object of fruitful ex- cav itions. At NICE-CIMIEZ, excavations, interrupted since 1880, were resumed in 1943 on the site of the Roman city of which important vestiges re- main. The amphitheater has been completely unearthed, and the baths, of which a part is well preserved, are being excavated at the present time. The archaeological zone is contained in an unfinished park-area, and will be excavated as a whole. If the Greek city of Nice is impossible to explore, the Roman city of Cimiez will thus be known.27 At NIMES the important structure tradition- ally known as the "Temple de la Fontaine" has been explored.28 At NARBONNE, the late Abbe Sigal unearthed a cryptoporticus analogous to that at Arles, but much more modest, which seems to be a hor- reum.29 A very remarkable discovery was made near the church of Saint-Paul; an early Christian cemetery situated on the site of a pagan ceme- tery. Six Christian sarcophagi occupy the inte- rior of a semicircular mausoleum. One of them bears some remarkable sculpture, representing 21 H.

The topogra- phy of the city, still little known, begins to be clarified. The excavations of SAINT-BERTRAND-DE-COM- MINGES which is, along with Frejus and Vaison, one of the most productive sources of information for Roman life in Gaul, have centered particu- larly on the great baths to the north, whose very systematic plan resembles that of the great baths at Pompeii. The piles of the hypocausts are truncated cylinders of clay in one piece.30 Now being excavated is a large structure with a basil- ical plan, which seems to be a market and which shows traces of repairs in the fourth century. Another large city, TOULOUSE, has given rise to a splendid discovery. A portion of the rampart of the later Empire has been unearthed along seventy-five meters of length with, in its founda- tions, pieces of architecture and sculpture reused from the earlier period, and perfectly preserved by the mortar which covered them. These ex- cavations, conducted by Fort, are not yet pub- lished. Examinations of urban topography have been undertaken in other cities: VIEIL-EVREUX,3V ORANGE, PERIGUEUX,32 SAINTES, CLERMONT- FERRAND. At TOUL, and at ORLEANS the de- struction due to the war has brought to light im- portant remains of the Roman past which are being investigated at the present time. Isolated monuments have been studied equally in large urban centers or outside the cities. THEATERS. Besides Lyon, the theater of Fr&amp;- jus has been the object of study by Dr. Don- nadieu;33 it belongs to the type, frequent in Gaul, of theaters constructed partly of masonry and partly of wood. AMPHITHEATERS. That of Cimiez (cf. n. 27), one of the smallest of the Roman world, had two periods of construction. Originally a primitive arena found by an embankment of earth, re- tained by two walls, it was later enlarged, in masonry, with a promenade and seats. At Besan- gon the amphitheater is being excavated at pres- ent.34 The amphitheater-theater at Sanxay (Vienne) has been published by Formig.35" BATHS. Besides the "Palais des Thermes" of Paris whose nature is still uncertain (cf. n. 22), the baths of Cimiez (cf. n. 27) and those of Saint Bertrand-de-Comminges (cf. n. 30), excavations are being made of the large bath establishment of Fontaines-Sal&amp;es. R. Louis has uncovered some baths with polygonal chambers, rebuilt several times, which form a remarkable whole.36 The baths of Sanxay (Vienne) have been published."' TEMPLES. At Fontaines-Salees, R. Louis is now uncovering an enclosure, near the baths and certainly connected with them. It is probably one of the "spring temples" which are frequent in Gaul. At Sanxay (Vienne) the sanctuary with a centered plan has been published;38 it may be compared with that of Moulin du FA (Charente- Maritime), where baths and a theater were both studied."3 Finally the baptistery of Saint-Remy de Pro- vence has been published. It is a new example of the type of baptistery well preserved in Gaul, together with that at Frejus.40 Two studies in CERAMOGRAPHY should be noted. That of G. Chenet on the ceramics of the fourth century in Argonne is an authoritative publication which fills a great need and will serve as a guide for all the Gallo-Roman excava- tions of the fourth century.41 The workshop of Montans (Tarn) is the subject of a study by Mme. Durand-Lefebvre of which the first part has just been published;42 the vases are at- tributed to the first century, and Montans ex- erted an influence on the Graufesenque. 30 B.

BARBARIAN PERIOD (FIFTH TO EIGHTH CENTURIES) The methodical exploration of barbarian ne- cropoleis in France is a new field of archaeology. It is beginning to reveal to us the art of the period of the invasions, and it permits us to catch a glimpse of what may have been the mixtures of populations. The method is explained by Eduard Salin, mining engineer and archaeologist, who has been making excavations, exact in all respects, in the east of France for the last thirty years.43 A burial is studied like a mineral deposit. Prospecting is done electromagnetically, by air photography, or by sounding. Exploration is carried out by cross- trenches perpendicular to the constant orienta- tion of the tombs and 1.20 m. apart, by hori- zontal surface cleaning when the tombs are ir- regularly oriented, and by systematic cleaning of surrounding terrain. To preserve the furniture, first the area at the feet is excavated and then up towards the head on both sides, leaving the skele- ton covered with earth. Finally the metal objects are analyzed in the laboratory.44 Chemical treat- ment returns to corroded iron an appearance similar to its original. Vacuum packing between sheets of plexiglass ("mise en atmosphere neutre"), after radiography, also gives good re- sults. Quantitative spectral analysis of bronzes permits the determination of the tin content. Analysis of the gilding on the metal shows us that gilding in fire was replaced in the barbarian pe- riod by gilding in mercury, which is a prehistoric process. Thus it is possible to distinguish Frankish tombs (where one finds battle axes and the scramasax of foot soldiers) Alamanic (the long sword of the knight), Burgundian (large badge- buckles with damasked belts and animal decora- tion of oriental origin). "It is prehistory which re- appeared in Gaul with the barbarian invasions; not a local prehistory, but the prehistory of the Near and the Far East" (A. Grenier). This is what is proved by the latest excavations of E. Sa- lin in the Meurthe-et-Moselle, at Varang~ville (inhumation burials of the seventh and eighth centuries), at Pompey, and in the region of Nancy. They establish also the persistence of German paganism in the middle of the seventh century and the importation of oriental influences through the Pontus region from the Scythians and the Sarmatians.45 The tombs of the Huns, Alans, Sarmatians, Suevi, Vandals, Saxons, and Bretons remain dif- ficult to identify. A Visigothic necropolis was ex- cavated in 1935-1936 by Raymond Lantier at ESTAEL (Pyrenees-Orientales)46 who renewed ex- cavations in 1945. The first results show connec- tions with the Visigothic necropoleis in Spain. The characteristics are the regular orientation of the tombs, the presence of rectangular badge- buckles decorated with uncut gems or glass beads, arched fibulae, tombs dug in the soil it- self, but lined on the interior with stones or bricks, the absence of offensive or defensive arms, the absence of pottery, the rarity of glass beads, the poorness of the tombs of men and the com- parative richness of the women's tombs. All is Germanic and pagan in this necropolis of the sixth century. These studies, which illuminate the population of barbarian Gaul, pose important questions. It is thus that the chemical analysis of barbarian swords perhaps imported from Jiitland has led E. Salin to wonder whether the success of the invasions was not due to a superiority of arma- ment.47 Minute archaeological analysis opens to the historian new perspectives in this field. THE MIDDLE AGES By Sumner McK. Crosby, Associate Professor at Yale University In the summer months of 1946 and 1947 new excavations were opened by the correspondent in the Abbey Church of ST. DENIS, outside of Paris, France. These excavations, carried forward with the permission and under the supervision of the Service des Monuments Historiques, confirm the evidence of his earlier work in 1938 and 1939 and provide startling new information in regard to the constructions of the eighth, eleventh and twelfth centuries of our era.

Four bases, two with carved ornaments of the nave colonnade of the same building, were also discovered. Masonry apparently belonging to the tower built at the end of the eleventh century with funds provided by William the Conqueror was found under the north transept. Foundations and interior bases of the twelfth-century nave and transept were brought to light with the sur- prising proof that this church, begun by the great Abbot Suger, was the prototype for Notre- Dame in Paris, since its plan provided for non- projecting transepts. Several tombs were also found. Among them, one containing the well-preserved remains of a thirteenth-century bishop, and another with a beautifully preserved stone bas-relief of the twelfth century, showing the twelve Apostles under arcades. SWITZERLAND By Pierre Bouffard, Premier Assistant, Musie d'Art et d'Histoire, Geneve Some years before the War, the Swiss Depart- ment of Antiquities conducted a number of ex- cavations using the labor of unemployed persons. When this project was interrupted for a time at the beginning of the War, it was resumed using the labor of interned military personnel. The largest part of the cost was borne by the Con- federation and the cantonal governments, but museums and learned societies, as well as indi- viduals, made their contribution. All of the finds have appeared in the Rapport annuel de la Socidt6 suisse de Prehistoire, and locally, at greater length, in the journals Ur-Schweiz, Revue suisse d'art et d'archgologie, and Genava. In spite of the mountainous nature of Switzerland, air survey has been employed with profit. The following report is concerned only with the more important discoveries. A. PRE-ROMAN PERIOD Palaeolithic and Mesolithic.-No systematic ex- cavations have been conducted in stations of this period, but there have been numerous sur- face finds. In the Alpes Bernoises, a number of caves have been discovered, but with poor fur- niture. Palafitti.-The great lakes of Switzerland continue to disclose stations of lake-dwellers, some of which have been partially explored. At- tention has been concentrated, however, princi- pally on the easier stations in the smaller lakes and in dried marshes. In the Lake of Baldegg (Argovie) there has been discovered and ex- cavated an important Neolithic station, while at Cudrefin-le-Broillet has been found a station of the Bronze Age. Further excavations employing the labor of military internees have been carried out at the Neolithic stations of Burglischi (Berne), of Pfyn and of Arbon (Thurgovie). Terrestrial Neolithic. - Chance finds of tombs with skeletons in the retracted position have oc- curred in the cantons of Vaud and of Valais (Collombey and Chamblandes). Bronze Age.- The canton of Grison has proved rich in stations of this period, situated generally on isolated hills or on the slopes of valleys. Systematic excava- tions have been undertaken at Fellers, Caziz, and Conters. First Iron Age (Hallstatt). -Tumuli on the Swiss plateau have been explored. Second Iron Age (La Tene).-During the War, the can- ton of Tessin has continued rich in necropoleis of the First Iron Age, many of which continued in use to the end of the Roman Period; particu- larly noteworthy are those at Bellinzone, Cade- mario, Sementina, and Solduno. Some further traces of the great Gallic vicus known as that of the "Gas-Works" at BAle have appeared in the course of terracing. The finds are, as usual, of ordinary grey ware, vases with red and white stripes, fibulae of La Tene III, and Gallic coins of varied provenience. In the canton of Grison, fortified villages have been discovered at Bonaduz and Castaneda. B. ROMAN PERIOD: EXCAVATIONS AVENCHES (Aventicum). Canton of Vaud. The temples and public buildings of the Roman city are on the little hill where the modern town lies, making exploration difficult. Nevertheless, building operations near the theater have dis- closed a large temple enclosed in a vast portico, possibly dedicated to Dionysus. The court of the temple lies on the axis of the theater; that is where was found a gold bust of Marcus Aure- lius (see below). Laborious clearing of the amphi- theater proved relatively useless, for the seats had been removed in the Middle Ages. Some pri- vate houses have been discovered.</page><page sequence="8">206 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGY AUGST (Augusta Raurica). Canton of Bale- Campagna. As the plan of the insulae of the city is known, the excavators have proceeded systematically to clear one insula after another. Large baths have been found, women's baths, private houses, and vaulted structures filled with wine amphoras. As to the theater, extensive re- building has given it a rather too modern aspect. WINDISCH (Vindonissa). Canton of Argovie. The dreary succession of Roman barracks has yielded little of interest, but investigation of the refuse heaps rewarded the investigators with wooden tablets and leather garments, now in the Museum Pro Vindonissa, at Brugg. MARTIGNY (Octodurus). Canton of Valais. The great road from Italy into Helvetia passed by the Great Saint-Bernard (Summus Poeninus), at the highest point of which has been found a temple dedicated to Jupiter, and a resthouse. The first Helvetian town met on the descent was Octodurus, where, early in the twentieth century, were found fragments of large bronze statues. Just before the War, the Department of Antiquities undertook excavations which have yielded part of the town plan, and uncovered private houses and a large public building, prob- ably a collegium. VIDY-SOUS-LAUSANNE (Lousonna). Canton of Vaud. Excavations show that the Roman town on the shores of Lake Geneva was the home of sailors and fishermen, and an active commercial center. NYON (Colonia Julia Equestris). Canton of Vaud. The Roman town, founded by Caesar for his veterans as the first colony in Switzerland, is entirely covered by the present-day Nyon. Nevertheless, a covered market has been dis- covered, and the substructure of what may have been a temple of Mithras. Outside the city, the course of the aqueduct from Mt. Jura may now be followed in its entirety. GENEVA (Genava). Modern construction, lit- tle by little, reveals the plan of the ancient city. Investigations carried out in 1944 have revealed a double line of fortifications along the Rh6ne, including a glacis, a ditch, and an earthern ram- part, particularly strong where fords occur. This is attributed to Caesar. TEGNA. Canton of Tessin. The original char- acter of the square buildings with vaulted cel- lars uncovered on the hill which dominates the village remains uncertain, but the location favors the hypothesis that it was a military storehouse. Cantons along the Rhine now exhibit the complete line of late Roman Imperial defenses, following the abandonment of the limes. Among the many Roman villas discovered on the Swiss plateau may be mentioned those at Aeschi (Soleure), Beinwil (Argovie), Grenchen (Soleure), and Laufenburg (Argovie). Many of them were heated by means of hypocausts, and equipped with plunge-baths. ROMAN PERIOD: FINDS Attention is called to the forthcoming exten- sive report on the discoveries in Switzerland be- tween 1939 and 1946 in the RA by Professor W. Deonna, Director of the Geneva Museum. STONE SCULPTURE. A statue of Venus, dis- covered at Martigny, is a poor copy of Praxit- eles' Aphrodite of Cnidus. It is of marble, and was probably imported from Italy. Two reliefs from Vindonissa represent, respectively, Pan and the head of an animal thrusting out its tongue. An Italian import at Nyon is a marble portrait of Julia Domna. BRONZE SCULPTURE. Bronzes are more nu- merous than sculptures in stone, but are mainly statuettes or applied ornaments. The most inter- esting represents a nude goddess, Venus or her Celtic counterpart (pl. xII, A). The bust was discovered long ago at Avenches, but has only been known to science since 1938. From Avenches also comes an applied ornament of gilded bronze in the form of a head of a young Gaul, un- bearded, and either dead or dying (pl. xII, B). The eyes are half closed and the corners of the mouth depressed. The hair falls in long locks. It is a work of the second century, based on the best Hellenistic models. Other objects are a Mercury, from Vidy, a careful copy of a Hellenistic type pl. xII, D, a Si- lenus from Chavornay, designed as a pendant, a Capricorn from Martigny with the head of a grif- fon and the tail of a fish, fastened upon a handle for use as a military standard, and a Satyr from Niedergisgen (Soleure), a poor work, which has been acquired by the National Museum. The excavations of Vindonissa have yielded a number of bronze objects of little value, and two worth mentioning, the head of a beardless Satyr and a panther standing with its paw on a disk decorated with a Medusa's head. At Augst have been found a beardless Satyr</page><page sequence="9">ARCHAEOLOGICAL NEWS 207 with a syrinx in his right hand, made to serve as part of a balance, a small bull, the protome of a lion, and an ear of corn and a grenade from a cor- nucopia. The most interesting piece from Augst is a bronze disk 0.208 m. in diameter, decorated with human masks and concentric zones in re- pousse work. It will be published by Deonna in Prdhistoire. PRECIOUS METALS. The gold bust of Mar- cus Aurelius from Avenches, discovered in 1939, shows the Emperor wearing a cuirass and a palu- damentum (pl. xII, c). At Vindonissa was found a statue of Mercury in gilded silver. It is of a stock type, showing the god with the usual hat, chlamys over the left shoulder, caduceus in the left hand, and purse in the right. It may be dated at the beginning of our era. PRECIOUS STONE. The treasury of the Abbey of St. Maurice, in the canton of Valais, contains an antique vase in sardonyx, with a gold frame of the Merovingian Period. It bears scenes in relief representing the funeral of Achilles. IVORY. In 1943, under the great altar of the cathedral of Coire, in the canton of Grison, were discovered various objects, including an antique ivory box with a representation of Aesculapius on the cover. MosAIcs. A large mosaic with marine scenes found at Nyon has been reconstructed in the local museum. A second mosaic, with represen- tations of various fishes and the head of Oce- anus, discovered at Mtinsingen (Berne), has been assembled in the museum at Berne. Other mo- saics, discovered during the War, have geometric designs. GLAss. The great Roman cemeteries of the canton of Tessin have yielded a fine series of glass containers, many of them intact. C. THE MIDDLE AGES From the early Middle Ages, the only signifi- cant finds have been those of tomb furniture of various sorts in cemeteries of the Allemani or the Burgundians. In the ABBEY OF ST. MAURICE (Valais), which was founded in A.D. 515 by the Burgundian king Sigismond, excavations have revealed the exist- ence of five superimposed basilical churches, dat- ing from the sixth to the eleventh centuries. A crypt was found under the choir of the latest of these at the beginning of the twentieth cen- tury. These structures were flanked by covered and subterranean passages for the use of pil- grims; in one of these occurred very fragmentary remains of Carolingian frescoes. The twelfth- century tower of the abbey, damaged early in the war by a falling stone, has been entirely re- constructed. Restorations have been undertaken in the Romanesque church of GIORNICO (Tessin) and in the triple-choired church at SPIEZ (Berne), be- neath which has been found a well-preserved crypt. In the Alpine canton of Valais, the episco- pal Majorie at SION has been transformed into a museum of fine arts, and at BRIGUE, the chateau of the Stockalper family has been restored to its seventeenth-century aspect. Under the cathedral at COIRE have been found foundations of Carolingian churches. The city of NEUCHA^TEL has traced most of its ancient fortifications. The stained glass of the Swiss churches was removed during the war for safe-keeping. It is now on exhibition in the museum of Zurich prior to being replaced. The famous painted wooden ceiling of Zillis, of the twelfth century, which was in bad repair, has been restored successfully. D. MUSEUMS The museum of Schaffhouse was partially de- stroyed by bombs during the War. It is now open to the public, with the missing objects replaced with others presented by various Swiss museums. At Bienne, the Schwab museum, devoted par- ticularly to the stations of the lakes of Bienne and of Neuchitel has been completely renovated. BELGIUM, HOLLAND, AND LUXEMBURG By Pierre Hombert A. PRE-ROMAN PERIOD BELGIUM In her popular book on Belgian prehistory, Mme. Saccasyn-della Santa studies the Palaeo- lithic and Neolithic periods. Few important prehistoric discoveries have been made in Belgium since 1940. OMAL, justly celebrated for its ribbed pottery, produced in 1941 still more ancient articles, when Mlle. Danthine excavated a workshop of the Mouste- 1 E. Saccasyn-della Santa, La Belgique prdhistorique (Brussels, 1946).</page><page sequence="10">208 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGY rian period. The stone utensils resemble those of the station at Ste. Walburge near Lidge and of the levels of the Tranchees Helin and of Stambruges, both in Hainaut.2 As for the objects of Mouste- rian Mosan (Mos6en) discovered in 1931 at Engihoul (province of Liege), they present some rather unusual characteristics.3 Since 1945, Mme. Saccasyn-della Santa has been excavating a Neolithic station at "Lindeke- molen" at WOLUWf-ST. LAMBERT. An abundance of stone, pottery, and clay with imprints of wat- tle was collected from this site, characteristic of the culture of Michelsberg (or Robenhausienne). The flint seems to come from Spiennes, from Obourg, and from Ottignies. This station may be compared with those of Boitsfort and of Rhode- St. Gendse.4 Several years previously another Michelsberg station was discovered at MALINES on the Zonnenberg (Pennepoel). The seventy- odd stone objects gathered there have been de- posited at the Bersleyden Museum in Malines.5 On the plateau of Solumont at Virton-St. Mard, numerous stone instruments of the Neo- lithic period were discovered by chance. The flint used in them came from Spiennes.6 At a place called "Neckersgat" at UCCLE (Brussels) several prehistoric and protohistoric finds were made. They consist in the first place of stone material of considerable importance, be- longing to the Tardenoisian industry (Meso- lithic). On the other hand, the floors of huts or tombs about one meter in diameter produced ob- jects of a different nature, belonging particularly to the period of La Tene III. A silver coin of Augustus was also discovered.' Belgian LIMBURG is a region rich in discoveries from the Stone and Iron Ages. The majority of these objects are assembled at Hasselt, at the Museum of Beguinage, and at the Institut St.- Jean Berchmans at Zonhoven.8 Discoveries from the Bronze Age are rare in Belgium. Several axes of bronze discovered be- fore the war were published after 1940.9 The Musees du Cinquentenaire possesses a scabbard chape of the Bronze Age (Period III of Deche- lette), the only one in Belgium. It was found in 1867 in the Bas-Escaut at Gendbrugge (Gand) and seems related to the group of the Oise and of the Somme.'o P. Lambrechts has discussed two horses' bits from COURT-ST. ETIENNE, which are like the bits discovered in Hungary in the area of a pre- Scythian, horse-using, people. These bits which date from Hallstatt C (end of eighth to beginning of seventh centuries) suggest conclusions as in- teresting as they are unexpected on the connec- tions between eastern and central Europe in the protohistoric period. The author does not com- mit himself on the place of origin of these bits." At LOMMEL, in the convent of St. Sacrement, the monks have excavated several mounds of the Hallstatt period. These tombs, surrounded by a small moat, may be attributed to the Urn- Field people.12 In 1942, additional discoveries of the same nature were made in the same clois- ter. Numerous urns, coming from about forty burials of the Bronze Age or of the Hallstatt and La Tene periods were unearthed.'3 On the borders of Longlier and of Juseret (Belgian Luxemburg) at a place called LA HUTTE, A. Geubel excavated a tumulus in 1942 contain- ing a female burial of the La Tene period (fourth or third centuries B.C.). It contained a torque, a vase and some bracelets.14 2 Hk61ne Danthine, Mhmoires de la SociWt&amp; royale des Sciences de Liege, i (1943), pp. 151-188. Paul Four- marier, ibid., pp. 189-190. 3 A. H.

Tourneur.x5 HOLLAND Bijvanck has published an instructive manual tracing the prehistory of Holland from the palae- olithic period to the conquest of the country by the Romans.'- Early Palaeolithic is almost unrepresented in Holland. Therefore it is not without interest that the discovery of an Acheulean-Mousterian coup-de-poing is reported at the Museum of the Chateau Erenstein near Kerkrade."7 The study of A. Bohmers on the Late Palaeolithic and the beginning of the Mesolithic periods resolves numerous problems of technical terminology in the Netherlands.s8 The megalithic civilization of the provinces of Drente, of Groningue, of Frise, and of Overijssel has furnished much pottery. J. C. Kat-Van Hulten has attempted to classify this pottery on the basis of its style and to establish a relative chronology." The stone axe of the Hanoverian type, found at Baexem (Dutch Limburg) and published by F. C. Bursch, belongs to the mega- lithic civilization. A part of the wooden handle is still preserved in the orifice of the axe. The end of the handle was decorated with a series of nails in bronze.21 The mounds which may be found in the Netherlands from the Neolithic period to the first centuries of our era have been explored by Pro- fessor Van Giffen. H. Brunsting has retraced the history of his study and exploration of these funerary mounds.21 As is well known, Professor Van Giffen has concerned himself particularly with the archae- ology of the Province of Drente. In his inaugural address at the University of Amsterdam he painted a vivid picture of the history of Drente, which he has explored for thirty years.22 In a re- markable volume he has united the results of the principal excavations in that region down to 1941. Like the report on Gasteren23 this book is particularly interesting for the transition from the Bronze to the Iron Age. There was no pause, but a progressive evolution of culture.24 In 1940, despite the war, A. E. Van Giffen continued his excavations with the aid of H. Brunsting. They were concerned especially with the Stone-Age or Bronze-Age mounds at Eext (township of Anloo), at Eldersloo (township of Rolde), and at Vredenheim (township of Rolde). At Eldersloo there was also an urn field used from the Neolithic period to the Roman era. The Bronze-Age funeral mound at Drouwen (township of Berger) was surrounded with stones.25 In 1941, several mounds were excavated. Those of Fluitenberg belonged to the period of the great migrations. A. E. Van Giffen published, at the same time, two megaliths found at Anloo. One of these, that of Eext, was excavated in 1927.26 The report which was published by the same author in 1944 is devoted exclusively to pre-war excavations dating in the 'twenties and 'thirties concerned with prehistory or protohis- tory.27 It was in July of 1939 that the urn field and the mounds of Gasteren (township of Anloo) were excavated. The report which appeared in 1945 is important for the transition from the Bronze Age to the Iron Age.28 H. Tj. Waterbolk and J. Leutscher published two addenda, the first on the analysis of pollens,29 and the second on the skeletons of the urn field."s 15 V. Tourneur, Les Belges avant Chsar (Brussels, 1944). 16 A. W.

Bursch proposed for him- self in 1942 was to submit the Dutch urn fields of the last centuries B.C. to a thorough study. Besides the previous excavations, the author re- fers to studies of his own which are not yet pub- lished.31 The mound at Hoenderloo, excavated in 1939 by F. C. Bursch, belongs to the end of the Neo- lithic period and identifies itself with the "Beak- er-culture." It was surrounded by a triple palisade and contained three tombs, each of which yielded one urn.21 The Beckers, father and son, published at the outset of the war a large volume containing re- ports on the excavations they had made over twenty years in Dutch Limburg. Their investiga- tions extend over a very long period, running from the Palaeolithic to the Carolingian periods.33 C. C. W. F. Hijszeler in a book dedicated to Professor Van Giffen, publishes a series of pre- liminary reports on the excavations made in the province of Twenthe. A native settlement at Losser belongs apparently to the beginning of our era. A prehistoric vase decorated with four ani- mal motifs was discovered in a cemetery there. The remains of a moor-bridge was discovered at Haaksbergen. At Denekamp and at Tubbergen, several mounds of the Stone and the Bronze Ages were excavated. At Ham four axes of polished stone, some fashioned bones and some bones of animals belonging to the Neolithic and Meso- lithic periods were unearthed. Finally, at Enschede, some workshops of flint objects were brought to light.34 The native houses of Losser were constructed following different designs (round, rectangular, oval, trapezoidal). The ob- servations of Hijszeler concerning the date - the first centuries of our era - are corroborated by the analyses of pollen.35 The mound at Denekamp contained a burial of the Neolithic or Eneolithic periods and is surrounded with stones. Not far away was another mound, where three burials of the Bronze Age were discovered.36 Finally, at Tubbergen, at a place called "De Manderesch," Hijszeler excavated a funerary mound enclosed by stones. This burial of the late Stone Age had been subsequently disturbed by a second in- humation.37 Farther to the south, at Schaarsbergen, near Arnhem, five mounds were excavated during the summer of 1947 by W. Glasbergen and H. Tj. Waterbolk. One, containing the burial of a person in the retracted position, belongs to the Neolithic period. It contained an urn of corded pottery, and a flint axe and knife. The mound was orig- inally surrounded by a palisade. The four other mounds dated from the Bronze Age and con- tained no objects. Around the edge of two of them are more recent burials. In the course of the same summer, four other mounds were excavated at Uchelen near Apeldoorn. All had been robbed. Three of these mounds date from the Bronze Age, and one from the Neolithic."3 Before leaving the prehistoric and protohis- toric studies of the Low Countries, it is proper to mention the ambitious task undertaken by H. Halbertsma, assistant to Professor Van Giffen. It consists of cataloguing the mounds of the provinces of Frisia and of Groningen.9 LUXEMBURG The township of Oetrange is quite rich in pre- historic documents. The stone material found in that station falls between the Aurignacian and the end of the Magdalenian periods. One may also mention a Mousterian coup-de-poing and an extensive industry in bone.40 At the beginning of the occupation a German scholar excavated the remains of a large wooden structure thirty- one meters in length and nearly nine meters in width. This dwelling, situated near Befort, in- cluded three parallel naves; only the central one was paved. It was probably covered by a peaked 31 F. C.

The facing of the walls cannot be determined with certainty. This structure, which belongs to the period of La Thne, was destroyed by fire.41 B. ROMAN PERIOD BELGIUM Several general works treating Roman Bel- gium have appeared in the past few years. Un- doubtedly the most important is the manual of Gallo-Roman Archaeology of Professor Van de Weerd. Although the fourth and fifth centuries, still poorly known, are not here treated thor- oughly, the manual is still an indispensable vade- mecum for the first three centuries of the Roman period. A new edition, completely revised, is being prepared and will appear in French.42 Jacques Breuer has briefly traced the history and sketched the civilization of Roman Belgium. the larger part of his book is devoted to the first three centuries of our era. The final chapter is devoted to the fall of the Empire and the Frankish invasions. A Flemish translation, with several illustrations added, has also been brought out.43 According to common opinion, the economic decline of Roman Gaul began as early as the end of the second century. The third century saw the spread of this decadence, which was definitely sealed by the Frankish invasions in A.D. 276. Professor Van de Weerd has recently subjected this view to doubt, at least in respect to the north of Gaul.44 S. J. De Laet has summarized this theory in French.45 Following up his important work published in 1937, R. De Maeyer has brought out, in 1940, the first part of his descriptive and bibliographical index of the Roman villas of Belgium. Special circumstances have prevented the publication of the second volume up to the present time.46 In a small and remarkably well illustrated book, M.-E. Marien sketches the history of Bel- gian sculpture. The study is based almost en- tirely on the monuments of Belgian Luxemburg; those of Tongres are not represented. Three periods are distinguished by the author: the mili- tary sculpture of the first century, the school of Arlon of the second, and the final works which belong to the third century.47 The same author has devoted a study to the funerary monuments of Arlon, the ancient Orolannum. They belong either to the first century or to a period embrac- ing the second half of the second and the first half of the third centuries.48 The same scholar exam- ines the funeral monuments of Buzenol, most of which date from the second century.49 See AJA, li, p. 344. Ch. Dubois has brought together all the bibli- ography and documents concerning Arlon in the Roman period."5 * At the time of the digging, in September 1944, of shelter trenches at Jupille, J. Thisse-Derouette discovered a Roman cremation cemetery. The site was not explored in its entirety. From the evidence of the objects which has been gathered, it dates from the first century of our era. Never- theless, some pottery seems to be later and could belong to the third or fourth century."5 In 1946, an excavation revealed a Roman cre- mation burial at Izel (Belgian Luxemburg). All the antiquities found there are now preserved 41 Gustav Riek, Germania, xxvi (1942), pp. 26-34. 42 H.

At Sainte-Marie (Chevigny, Belgian Luxem- burg), where excavations had already been made in 1870, discovery was made in November of 1946 of a small hypocaust with square pillars and a human skeleton. No sherds permit its dating with certainty.52 During the war, excavations devoted to the searching of the out buildings of the Villa de la Corne du Bois des Pendus (Belgian Luxemburg), did not give very important results.53 At the be- ginning of the German occupation, P. Fouss, Curator of the Museum of Virton, excavated the remains of a Roman villa near Toutelange, in Luxemburg. The rather fruitful results have not yet been published.64 In 1945, J. Breuer excavated at Cerfontaine (province of Namur) a small Roman cemetery. The twenty tombs yielded, besides earthen vases, several coins and some enameled fibulae. This necropolis, which dates from the second half of the last century of our era and from the be- ginning of the second, has not yet been pub- lished.56 Nineteen cremation burials were excavated in the unviolated part of the Roman cemetery at Couillet. This necropolis dates from the end of the first or the beginning of the second century." The sigillata preserved at the Museum of Char- leroi and coming from the neighborhood of Char- leroi and of Thuin has been published by Ferdinand Vaes. No fragments of Italian impor- tations were found. Ninety percent of the pot- tery came from southeastern Gaul, and only ten percent from the region of Treves. At the be- ginning of the third century, the importations from the south ceased.57 By the study of pottery, Mme. Faider-Feyt- mans concluded that if the upper basin of the Haine knew as early as the period of Claudius a real prosperity, this ended towards A.D. 275. After this date one no longer finds traces of civil occupation. The region became a frontier glacis which protected the interior routes.58 The wide destruction caused at Tournai by the German invasion in 1940 permitted the Com- missariat general a la Restauration du Pays to undertake excavations in the city. There was discovered in the Rue des Choraux in April of 1941, a rubbish ditch containing not only sherds of Belgian pottery, but also some fragments of sigillata imported from the south of Gaul. Ana- lyzing this discovery, M. Amand concludes that the ditch was used during the last half of the first century but was out of use at the time of Ves- pasian.59 In 1941-42 the remains of a hypocaust, with some fragments of dressed stones, blocks of a rose colored pavement, and sherds, were cleared in the Rue des Orfevres. The construction seems to place it towards the end of the first half of the first century. A sounding in the Rue des Choraux yielded a badly damaged fragment of a funerary inscription of the middle of the second century. At the same time a fragment of a planetary vase was discovered.60 In July 1943, important substructures were brought to light at the March6-aux-Jambons.61 Only a part of the construction could be cleared. This consists of walls and paving belonging to the part of a house where baths were installed. Two basins and hypocausts were found. Among the objects in the dwelling were the ivory cover of a writing tablet and two pieces of stylus. The sherds found date the occupation of the building in the second half of the first century. The fur- nace of the hypocaust was destroyed at the end of the second century. The remains of this struc- ture were covered in the Middle Ages by the foundations of the city wall. Other substructures were brought to light at the ]Ecole Saint-Luc, at the edge of the Rue de la Tate d'Or and the Rue des Clarisses. Inhabited as early as the first century, they were occupied until the middle of the second century. Among the debris were some 52 A. Geubel, Archgologie (=Antiquitg classique), 1946, p. 314. 53 V.

At Place Reine Astrid, the traces of a large room were discov- ered.62 At the time of the excavation of the Pre- Roman church of Saint Brice, some Roman sherds of the first century were found. M. Amand also notes a belt buckle of the Merovingian Period. It is of tinned bronze and dates from the first half of the seventh century.63 The soundings made at the cathedral furnished a series of sherds, dating for the most part from the first and second centuries. Some of them belong to the third and fourth centuries but these are very rare. A fragment of a Merovingian urn and two fragments of combs of the seventh century were also discovered there." From all the excavations carried out at Tour- nai, it seems to be that the city was occupied from the first century until the beginning of the third century, when it was sacked. It recovered later, as is shown by the Itinerary of Antoninus, the Peutinger Map and the Notitia Civitatum, as well as by some rare objects of the fourth century. The most densely occupied area lies between the Escaut and the Church of Saint Brice. No trace of the Roman wall has been found. The German scholar P. Goessler could not take into consideration the recent discov- eries in the article which he devoted to Turna- cum in the RE.65 The excavations and archaeological studies concerning the Flemish country are less numer- ous than for the southern part of Belgium. The occupation of northern Belgium was much less dense under the Romans. S. J. DeLaet has devoted three articles to the Roman vicus at Assche-Kalkoven. In a first study he describes some figurines of horses in white clay. They are probably votive offerings, remains of a cult in which horses were conse- crated to a local divinity.68 The vicus reassumed a certain importance in the Roman period for it lay at the junction of three routes. Numerous objects have been found in the town, which was apparently a market, frequented by the peasants of the district. It was occupied from the middle of the first century until the reign of Tetricus and revived briefly in the fourth century.67 The same author studied the sigillata found at Assche- Kalkoven. The earliest sherds belong to the reign of Claudius, the latest to the second half of the second century.68 In 1946, numerous Roman antiquities were dis- covered at Hofstade. They will soon be published by S. J. De Laet who is undertaking excavations in that township this fall. Aside from sherds of the end of the second century coming from a field, the other discoveries of last year were made on an area of five square meters and include sigilla- ta, Belgian pottery, imitations of Belgian pot- tery, common ware, and jugs. The majority date from A.D. 80 to 105; certain pieces go back as far as A.D. 70.69 It was not until 1943 that the Chevalier Georges de Schaetzen published the results of soundings which he made in 1937 at Tongres, between the Geer and the great wall on the side of Liege. They determined the outline of several streets and marked out a large square, probably surrounded by buildings.70 At Tongres also has been recently found a Roman inhumation burial dating from the fourth century. It will soon be published.7" The article in RE devoted to the Tungri72 by Karl Scherling contains some serious errors pointed out by H. Van de Weerd.73 The township of Velsique (Eastern Flanders) has attracted the interest of archaeologists for several centuries. Recently, a peasant gathered a number of sherds from a field situated along the road between Audenarde and Alost. Further- more, in the same area there was found a wall 62 M.

Although this latest discovery cannot yet be controlled, the sherds, coins, tegulae, etc., have been briefly published by S. J. De Laet. All the objects date from the first three centuries of our era.74 At Brunsbeek, at a place called "Heideblok," not far from the Roman road from Tirlemont to Diest, a Roman urn was discovered in June, 1930, containing a hoard of Roman coins, dating from A.D. 100 to 220.75 In 1942, a Limes Committee was created in Belgium under the direction of H. Van de Weerd, J. Breuer, and J. Vannerus, and under the patronage of the Academies Royales.76 The pur- pose of this committee is to study the Gallo- Roman fortifications of Belgium which have been called, a little pompously, Limes Belgicus. In preparation for this project, which has not been started, J. Vannerus has published a very im- portant "toponymic" study of the problem.77 HOLLAND Parallel to his history of the prehistoric period in the Low Countries, A. W. Bijvanck has pub- lished a monumental work on this country in the Roman period.78 W. Glasbergen, also, has given a brief and striking picture of the Roman occupa- tion of the Low Countries.79 W. J. Van Liere has sketched the occupation of the "Westland" (re- gions of Delft, Naaldwijk, and Arentsburg) un- der the Romans. P. J. R. Modderman has traced the occupation of the "Bommelerwaard" (situ- ated between the Waal and the Meuse) from pre- historic times to the Middle Ages.so In a very important publication, J. H. Hol- werda and W. C. Braat make known the results of the excavations which they made at Holdeurn between 1938 and 1942. They give a very com- plete idea of the organization and of the func- tioning of a Roman military tile-kiln. On the other hand they show the place of manufacture of the pottery which is found in the region of Nimegue. This last workshop functioned espe- cially between A.D. 70 and 105, and saw a rapid decline later on. The tile-kiln of the Exercitus Germaniae Inferioris was only created a little before A.D. 180; its activity extended until the middle of the third century. Its products are found in all of Lower Germany.81 Previously, J. H. Holwerda had published the pottery of Holdeurn, found in the cemeteries of Nimegue. This pottery now belongs to the Kam Museum at Nimegue.82 The pottery called "Belgian," an indigenous product of the first century in the north of Gaul, has never been the subject of a general study. J. H. Holwerda, however, published in 1941 a remarkable catalogue of that pottery preserved at the Kam Museum at Nimegue. He has thus established the base for a systematic study of that important manifestation of the local indus- try of Roman Belgium.83 In 1948 two reports will appear which will treat the excavations made at Heerlen in 1941. The first will be by Professor A. E. Van Giffen, and will describe the mounds of which impor- tant remains have been found. The second re- port will be presented by W. Glasbergen who will treat the sigillata brought to light in these excavations. The sherds go back to the middle of the first century. The latest belong to the fourth century. Of the three castella which P. Peters be- lieved could be identified in the plan of the town, none was found at the time of the recent study.84 One of the most sensational archaeological dis- 74 Siegfried J.

Under the Reformed Church badly damaged by the war, the government archaeological service discovered the remains of two superposed Roman temples, whose axes were in a north-south direc- tion. The importance of that excavation is very great because we know scarcely any pagan reli- gious edifices in our regions (pl. xIII, A). The earlier sanctuary, which is also the smaller, is a rectangular edifice of 8.50X 11.50 m. The walls are about 0.70 m. in thickness. A large part of the foundations and the pavement are pre- served. The latter was composed of crushed tiles and white mortar. A fibula and sherds show that the construction may go back to the beginning of the first century. It has been impossible to estab- lish whether the traces of fire which have been observed are connected with the events of A.D. 69 (the revolt of the Batavi). The second temple, constructed on the ruins of the first, is much larger. It is composed of a rectangular cella, enclosed by a peristyle, also rectangular. The cella measures about 15X13 m., the entire building 28X23 m. The walls are quite thick (1.80 m.). The entrance to the temple must have been in the southern facade. The peri- style was constructed with fluted Ionic columns topped with Corinthian capitals. In the interior of the building, in the cella as well as in the peri- style, numerous fragments of frescoes of different colors were discovered. Few objects have been found, making the dating difficult. P. Glazema, who conducted the excavations, suggests the sec- ond century. Although no statue or other object identifies the divinity worshiped, examination of the ani- mal bones indicates that the sacrifices were suovetaurilia. Up to the present only four miliaria are known in the Low Countries: CIL, xiii, 9162 to 9165. In a recent article H. Brunsting85 describes these stelae erected about A.D. 100 and in A.D. 1692. He is concerned particularly with CIL, xiii, 9165, of which the authenticity has frequently been doubted, but without reason. Some new letters have been read by the author in CIL, xiii, 9164; one cannot, however, reconstruct the text. Very recently, two new fragments of miliaria have been discovered in Dutch Limburg at Eygels- hoven. The inscriptions may be dated in the time of Constantine the Great (A.D. 306-337). In the summer of 1947, an excavation at Rim- burg (Dutch Limburg) made possible the study of the Roman road from Boulogne to Cologne, at the point where it passes the river Worm. There were two periods in the construction. Beside the road was found, in this place, a building with por- tico, which it is hoped may be excavated and ex- amined next year."A W. C. Braat has published the results of the excavations of 1936, 1937, and 1938 in three Ro- man villas in Dutch Limburg. They comprise a small Roman villa, or rather an annexed build- ing, at Kaalheide, where only the walls were dis- covered, and of two others at Simpelveld. The first of these could be only partially excavated. It seems, however, to correspond to the type which groups several small rooms around a large central chamber. Two small cellars were added towards the end of the occupation of the dwelling, which was constructed at the end of the first century and inhabited until the beginning of the third. The second villa, which can be examined more completely, yields but little data for its precise dating. On the southwest side there is a portico; the excavation reveals neither bathrooms nor cel- lars. It is probable that this villa existed from the end of the first century to the beginning of the third.87 Not far from the two villas at Simpelveld, situated about 50 m. apart, the famous sarcoph- agus of Simpelveld was discovered in 1930. Excavated at the beginning of the nineteenth century, the castellum of Rossum (Gueldre), on the left bank of the Waal, yielded numerous sherds of sigillata. W. Glasbergen has studied these and reaches the conclusion that the castel- lum, occupied first in A.D. 70, saw its garrison reduced after 200, before being evacuated to- wards the middle of the third century. The few coins from the end of the third century and from the beginning of the fourth, were connected with a short military reoccupation of the site, but no sherds of this period have been found.88 The town of Valkenburg was the scene of hard fighting in May 1940. Its destruction allowed 81-. Brunsting, Oudheidkundige Mededeelingen, n.s., xxvii (1946), pp. 28-36. * Information furnished by H. Brunsting. s7 W. C. Braat, ibid., xxii (1941), pp. 39-51. 8s W.

Van Giffen to undertake there some very important excavations in 1941, 1942, 1943, and 1946. Six superposed castella were dis- covered. The first three were separated from the others by a bed of cinders, corresponding to the Batavian revolt of A.D. 69-70. The wooden sub- structions of the rampart of the first three camps were very well preserved. The first seems to have been built at the time of the conquest of England in A.D. 43. The sixth camp was of stone and was probably abandoned towards A.D. 240.89 The sig- illata and the graffiti collected by A. E. Remou- champs at the time of the excavations of the castellum "Op de Woerd" near Valkenburg have been studied by W. Glasbergen. The sherds, with some exceptions, belong to a period from Vespasian to A.D. 240. The majority of the frag- ments date from the second half of the second century." The Roman camp at Vechten near Utrecht had already been explored on several occasions by MUiller, Holwerda, Remouchamps, and Braat. In the autumn of 1946 and during the year of 1947, Professor A. E. Van Giffen made several new ex- cavations there."9 The sigillata coming from the workshops of Bassus and of Coelius (La Grau- fesenque) found at Vechten come from excava- tions prior to those of 1946-47.92 In Velzen (a province of northern Holland) was found in 1945 a quantity of Roman sherds at the time of the digging of an anti-tank trench. From the study of these, both the sigillata and common ware, it appears that they belong to the Claudian period. A. E. Van Giffen and W. Glas- bergen connect these with the expedition of Cor- bulo against the Chaugui in A.D. 47. Perhaps, then, the site represents a foraging camp.93 During the summer of 1947, the excavations of J. Willems at Alphen (northern Brabant) at a place called "de Bartjes" were pursued without important results. The native house discovered in 1940 by J. Willems is still the only structure completely explored. This year a great number of stake holes were discovered without, however, permitting the reconstruction of any sort of build- ing. Roman and native sherds were gathered in great number. An excavation undertaken not far from this place in a field covered with fragments of Roman pottery and tiles discovered, perhaps, a Roman guard post, established on a road.94 The curate of Alphen has recently published an excellent little book in which he unites all the archaeological evidence of toponymy and folk- lore concerning the township.95 The province of Drente has furnished but little sigillata, for it lay outside the routes of communi- cation. From the fact that the pottery comes pri- marily from Treves (second half of the second century and beginning of the third century), it is clear that commercial relations between that re- gion of the Low Countries and the Empire were not very important.96 It was before the war that J. H. Holwerda suc- cessfully excavated a Batavian village near the Oppidum Batavorum, on the "Kobse Plateau" near Ubbergen (Nimeque). Thanks to the Ro- man objects and objects of the Roman period found there, he can fix the date of this dwelling between 15 and 8 B.c. It is rather surprising to note that the Batavians, who had just estab- lished themselves near Nimeque, were importing Arretine ware.97 According to earlier estimates, the native set- tlement of Zeijen (Drente) on the "Noordsche Veld" dated about from 800 B.c. Recent excava- tions have modified this date; the dwelling dates from a period extending from the second to the fourth Christian centuries.98 19 A. E. Van Giffen and W.

MEROVINGIAN AND MEDIAEVAL PERIODS BELGIUM H. Roosens has devoted an excellent study to the problem of the Merovingian tombs in Bel- gium, in which he gives a critical review of the diverse theories which have arisen up to the pres- ent concerning the cemeteries and the Frankish colonization in Belgium. The problem is still far from being solved, both from the chronological and from the ethnological points of view. It will be necessary first, we believe, to have a corpus sepulcrale of the Merovingian Period before building theories on the archaeological evidence.99 Although purely historical, the study of Ch. Verlinden on the Franks and Aetius ought to be cited here. The conclusions at which the author arrives are very important. The Salian Franks of whom we hear nothing between 358 and the bat- tle of Vicus Hellena remained in that period apud Toxiandriam. It could not, then, be a question of Frankish colonization in Belgium and in north- ern France either in the fourth or in the begin- ning of the fifth century.100 The same author places Deusone in regione Francorum at Doesburg in Gueldre.llo Just before the war J. Maertens de Noordhout excavated the Merovingian cemetery of SEM- MERSAECKE near Gand. This rather late cemetery (end of sixth-beginning of seventh centuries) contained only a poor selection of objects, includ- ing, among others, some urns of the so-called Saxon type. As a rare circumstance in Belgium, there were some cremation burials among the in- humations.'02 At TORGNY (Belgian Luxemburg), E. P. Fouss excavated a Merovingian cemetery during the autumn of 1938. The section which he brought to light contained only late burials of the seventh century. The cemetery of Torgny is the largest of those discovered up to the present in the prov- ince of Luxemburg.o03 Beneath the church of Saint Brice at TOURNAI the substructions of a Pre-Romanesque church were discovered during the occupation. Several disturbed Merovingian burials were found on the same occasion.04 In August and September 1945, the Service des Fouilles de l'Etat completed the excavations begun in 1940 in the Merovingian cemetery in the park of the Abbaye Saint Mar- tin at Tournai. This very large cemetery had been robbed on several occasions; about fifty tombs dug in open ground yielded but one rather poor and late object (end of sixth-beginning of seventh centuries). These objects are preserved at the new Museum of Tournai, but have not yet been published.105 The tragic events of May, 1940, caused cruel ravages in the cities of TOURNAI and NIVELLES. These were nevertheless the occasion of interest- ing discoveries in the churches of Saint Brice and Saint Quentin at Tournai and in the church of Saint Gertrude at Nivelles. They consist of mural paintings of the fourteenth, fifteenth, and six- teenth centuries. At Saint Brice was brought to light an Annunciation surmounted on the left and right by the figure of an angel, a Ram Scene, and other fragments. The Annunciation dates, according to P. Rolland, from 1406-7, and should be attributed to Robert Campin. At the church of Saint Quentin, two large murals represent re- spectively the Pilgrimage to Saint Jacques de Compostelle, and the Entry of Jesus into Jerusa- lem. The first dates from the sixteenth century, the second from the fourteenth. At Nivelles, be- sides some effaced fragments, was found a fresco representing Saint Gertrude and Saint Ursula, dating from the beginning of the fifteenth cen- tury.'10 The destruction caused by the war in other Belgian churches has permitted archaeological investigations of the highest interest.

Lemaire could study at leisure the church of Saint Lambert at KESSEL near Lierre. Built at the beginning of the fourteenth century, it was subject (up to 1500) to numerous changes and additions.'1' The excavations undertaken by G. Meersse- man and by Brother Firmin in the Church of Saint Peter of TORHOUT in 1941 have two-fold interest. First, they permitted the study of the remains of the Romanesque church constructed in the eleventh, twelfth, and thirteenth centuries. Second, they brought to light the foundations of a Carolingian church erected at the beginning of the ninth century. This church of rectangular design offers numerous points of comparison with that of Germigny-des-Pr6s. Numerous foreign in- fluences, Eastern among others, can be estab- lished there.'0s At the church of Saint Gertrude at Nivelles, J. Breuer discovered some rather important re- mains of a church dating from the eighth century. There are preserved, in the axis of the nave, two altar bases built over tombs, just as at Saint Galle, Fulda, and Saint Riquier. There was also a fragment of a Roman inscription which had been reused several times. Canon Lemaire un- dertook in 1941 excavations at the forepart or "Westbau" of the twelfth century.109 The excavations undertaken in the ruins of the church of Saint Brice at Tournai were very in- teresting. Discovered there were the remains of a Pre-Romanesque church whose existence was pre- viously unknown. Its design could be established just as could that of the Romanesque church. As for the examinations made in the Gothic church, they clarify the construction and general plan of that building."n At the time of the excavations in 1941, P. Rolland studied the traces of the par- ish chapel (adjacent to the cathedral) erected during the second decade of the sixteenth cen- tury and burned in 1940. On this occasion he was able to identify the cloister of the twelfth century as well as the primitive state of the chapel, known as the "6glise Notre-Dame." The "capitulary" cloister destroyed between 1669 and 1672 was built during the third quarter of the twelfth cen- tury, on the site of the "capitulary" buildings re- ferred to in the documents of the beginning of the ninth century. Some unimportant substructions of this Mediaeval edifice were found in 194.11 The Abbaye Saint Bavon at GAND was the ob- ject of important excavations in 1943 and 1946. They were intended to locate the remains of the Romanesque church on the site where the Gothic church, destroyed under Charles V at the time of the construction of the Chateau des Espagnols, was built. The outline of the chancel was almost entirely recovered. The tombs of three abbots dating from the end of the tenth and the begin- ning of the eleventh centuries were brought to light. On one of them the site now occupied by the city of Gand is called locus Gandensis. The excavations of 1943 yielded also some mural paintings which are now being examined by the technical service of the Musees du Cinquante- naire.112 At the early abbey of Saint Trond (Bel- gian Limburg), excavations indicated that the abbey church of 1055 was constructed in a very ancient Romanesque style. The complete plan of the edifice has been established. Some data con- cerning the Ottonian church of 945 were also gathered."n EENAME, a small village on the Escaut north of Audendarde, was an important center in the tenth and eleventh centuries. Chief town of the marquisate of Einham, a settlement rapidly grew up around the chateau-fortress. The portus of Ee- name was destroyed by the counts of Flanders in the middle of the eleventh century. Shortly after, an abbey grew up on the site and existed until the end of the eighteenth century. A. L. G. Van de Walle, an architect of Gand, has been excavating this site since 1942. In 1942, 1943, and 1944, the abbey of Eename was brought to light (pl. xmII, B).

It consisted of a large basilica with pillars; the principal chancel was rectangular and surrounded by four lateral chancels. Two side towers were erected on the east side at the junction of the chancel and the projecting transept. Beneath this church another, smaller, that of the portus, was also found. Its plan includes a large nave with chancel and apse. A tower arose on the western facade. This sanctuary dates from the beginning of the eleventh century. A third church, that conse- crated to the Saint Vierge of Lotharingie, con- structed in the tenth or in the eleventh century, formed part of the castellum erected towards 976. The plan of this place is similar to those of Germany (Goslar and Gelnhausen). The excava- tions of 1946 brought to light the remains of a rather primitive rampart. This year the excava- tions are still in progress. A. L. G. Van de Walle has cleared a cemetery of the tenth and eleventh centuries in the neighborhood of the church of the Saint Sauveur. Around this church he has started the examination of the remains of the portus. There is still much to excavate in this unique site. Almost all the portus and the church of Saint-Laurent, which is located under the present church of Eename, figure among the most important objects of future campaigns. Although these excavations revive, little by little, the history of a city in the tenth and eleventh centuries, this is not the only interest of the research of A. L. G. Van de Walle. The numerous vases and sherds which were found there will permit interesting chronological and typological studies on Mediaeval pottery. Pre- liminary reports on the first campaigns will soon appear."14 HOLLAND The excellent Dutch numismatist P. C. J. A. Boeles has devoted an interesting article to the Merovingian coins of the Dronrijp type and to the finds at NIETAP (Drente).15S Before the war W. C. Braat made excavations which led him to find the remains of Mediaeval dwellings at HARTEN near Renkum and at HARGEN near Schoorl. The first group of houses probably goes back to the Carolingian Period (ninth-tenth centuries). In the second town, only one house, of about 1200, was discovered.is In 1941 and 1942 the same archaeologist exca- vated two strong mediaeval fortresses near KEPPEL. One of them was situated along the Oude Ijssel, the other at Barlham. The first dates from the tenth and eleventh centuries. The second, originally constructed of wood in the tenth or eleventh century, was occupied until the middle of the fifteenth."' It was also W. C. Braat who undertook in 1939 excavations at SOUBURG, on the island of Walcheren; the war prevented him from continuing them. Traces of Carolingian houses of the ninth century were found; the town of Souburg was circular and surrounded by an earthen rampart and moat forty meters in width. All the sherds discovered belong to the ninth century and are, then, prior to the Norman invasions.118s MIDDELBURG, badly destroyed at the time of the battle of Zdlande in May 1940, was, the fol- lowing year, the subject of research by W. C. Braat. The results obtained on the history of the mediaeval town are analogous to those at Sou- burg. The occupation of the site goes back to the ninth century here, too; the wall was similar to that of Souburg. In 1941-19491, W. C. Braat engaged in new excavations at Middelburg. Traces of houses were discovered. Besides Caro- lingian sherds, numerous objects in leather were also found, including shoes and soles which seem to date from around 1100.119 The excavations made by A. E. Van Giffen in 1939 in a mound at LEENS yielded interesting results. The finds go back to the second half of the seventh century, and continue until the be- ginning of the tenth century. The excellent stratigraphy noted in the course of the excava- tion was particularly profitable for the study of the ceramics. Numerous remains of dwellings were also found.

The following cases are the most important as outlined in a recent study by P. Glazema.21' In 1943 and 1944, two churches in Frisia were examined. The picturesque brick church at JANUM which dates from the thirteenth century provides interesting information. The nave in front of the octagonal chancel was probably covered by a roof of reeds, which was burned. On the other hand, it appears that the bell of the church of Janum was cast in the nave itself; the same phenomenon was observed at Ooster- beek and at Wessem. The excavations reveal that the nave, for the needs of the cult, had been divided into three parts. The Romanesque church of Rinsumageest was altered in the fifteenth century. It was built on a crypt and had a round chancel. On the north side of the church where a side nave was supposed to be, some foundations were found which seem to belong to a more ancient church. Beneath these foundations, the excavators brought to light some tombs without furniture, which can date back as far as the eleventh century. Destroyed in 1944 at the time of the furious battle of Arnhem, the church of OOSTERBEEK was chosen for archaeological research. The results obtained in that sanctuary, built in the Caro- lingian Period and altered in the twelfth, four- teenth, fifteenth, and nineteenth centuries, were particularly interesting. There was found the only example known in Holland of a chancel bordered by three apses of equal depth, of which the middle one is the widest. The fight for liberation brought severe destruc- tion to the church of WESSEM near Roermond. The excavations which were undertaken there brought the discovery, under the fourteenth century Gothic church with three naves, of a Roman church of the tenth or eleventh century, also including three naves. Among the objects found we note a fragment of a sculptured altar and the upper part of the Romanesque bap- tismal fonts. The church at ANGERLO was examined in 1946. To the Romanesque nave had been added a side nave to the north ending in a tower on the east side, a Gothic chancel, and, on the western fa- cade, a tower now destroyed. The presence of a tower on the northeast is rather curious. In the course of these excavations, which are not yet completed, was found a Romanesque candela- bruin in bronze of the eleventh century. Beneath the church of PIESSEN were uncov- ered the foundations of a building of rectangular exterior, but probably of a circular interior. They are, perhaps, of the first church. Three different structures preceded the present gothic church at ZELHEM. A small square build- ing, situated under the modern chancel, was fol- lowed by a long nave with a circular chancel and without a tower on the west side. Later this church was enlarged by two side naves ending in apses; that is the third and last phase before the Gothic structure. In the interior of the chan- cel of the church at Vries were found the remains of a more ancient building, one of whose sides was semi-circular. The Reformed Church of ELST, beneath which, as we have already noted, were located two Roman temples, was excavated by P. Glazema during the summer of 1947. Three stages were distinguished there. First of all in the remains of the second pagan temple there arose, in the eighth century, a small rectangular church with a rectangular chancel narrower than the nave. Certain of the walls follow those of the Roman- esque structure. In the tenth century the con- struction of a Romanesque church of larger di- mensions was undertaken. It measured, in fact, 42X 12 m. against 2.X 12 m. for the preceding church. The nave was rectangular. Beneath the east side of the edifice was a crypt. It is worth noting that this crypt had no vaulting but, rather, a flat wooden ceiling. This is a unique case in the Low Countries. This Romanesque edifice was followed, in the fifteenth century, by a Gothic church which existed until the tragic days of the autumn of 1944.122 Medieval Dutch archaeology is not essen- tially religious. Thus excavations were undertaken in 1946 at the county chateau of ZUTPHEN. The design of this, just as that of the castellum of Eename, is comparable to the Pfaltz at Goslar. 120 A. E.

Glazema.</page><page sequence="23">ARCHAEOLOGICAL NEWS 221 This stone structure of about 1100 was preceded by a wooden building. The fortified castle of Ter Horst near RHENEN is a little more recent. The excavations made in 1942, make possible the recovery of the outline of this heavy polygonal structure. The house constructed at the be- ginning of the thirteenth century by one of the seigneurs of Voorschoten, between Overschie and Schiedam, is called Huis Starrenburg. It was ex- cavated in 1941. It was a rectangular building divided into two parts. The principal interest of the excavations made between 1943 and 1945 at the fortified castle of Duurstede rests, in the first place, in the position of the general dungeon area. This was con- structed in the wall. During the second half of the fifteenth century, Bishop David fortified and modified anew the stout fortress. The dungeon lost its importance to a heavy circular tower. The county chateau constructed at Middel- burg by Floris V at the end of the thirteenth century was excavated in 1942-1943. It con- sists of a relatively small building consisting prin- cipally of a great rectangular dungeon. With the fortified castle of SPANGEN near Rotterdam we are in the fourteenth century. The most ancient part is the great rectangular dun- geon. The other structures were built from the second half of the fourteenth century to the first half of the sixteenth. The castle was burned by the Spaniards in 1579. Other houses or fortified castles going back to the fourteenth century were excavated at MER- WEEDE near Dordrecht, at BALGOY near Grave, at LEVENDAEL near Rhenen, and at OuD-EHnREN- STEYN near Kerkrade.123 W. C. Braat's attention has also been directed towards the mediaeval pottery found in the Low Countries. He reviews the different forms, at- tempts to arrange their chronology, and treats the places of origin of the pottery. This remark- able study well merits the consideration of all those who make mediaeval excavations.124 D. VARIA The small museum of Alost possesses several pieces in bronze having a certain interest in the cultural history of Belgium in the periods of La Tone and of the Romans. H. Van de Weerd and S. J. De Laet published four small objects in 1943. These are a theriomorphic amulet repre- senting a ram, a tripod, a bull with forehead en- circled with a nimbus, and a nude dancer.2' P. Lambrechts has commented on a statuette of Mercury in bronze preserved at the museum of TONGRES, and discovered in a Roman burial in that city. It is of Celtic origin and of an apo- tropaic and funereal character.1' At Tournai the archaeological museum housed in the Hall aux Draps was completely destroyed by the German bombardments in 1940. A new museum, containing the objects found in the last excavations was inaugurated a few months ago. On Easter 1947 occurred the official inaugura- tion of the museum of Mariemont which its dis- tinguished curator, Mme. C. Faider-Feytmans, has completely reorganized. Several years previ- ously Mme. Faider had published a very detailed catalogue of the Roman and Merovingian glass- ware preserved at the museum of Mariemont.'27 In connection with the plans for and results of the restoration and reconstruction of the his- torical monuments of Belgium, information can be found in the Bulletin de la Commission royale d'art et d'archeologie, monuments et sites. SCANDINAVIA By Johannes Brondsted, Copenhagen In spite of the war, there has been lively ac- tivity and marked progress since 1940 in all spheres of Scandinavian archaeology: from the Mesolithic to Viking times. Important finds have come to light (especially in the bogs as a result of the great peat-cutting drives); important excava- tions have been made; outstanding books and papers have been written. To anyone making a comparison between the different Scandinavian countries and their ar- chaeology, it is evident that each country, as it were, has its own tone, determined by tradition, disposition and conditions. In the first twenty years of the present century, the course of 123 J. G. N. Renaud, Gedenkboek Van Giffen, pp. 427- 444. 124 W. C. Braat, ibid., pp. 459-474. 125 Hubert Van De Weerd and Siegfried J.

He kept research sternly disciplined; he was at once humanist and a searcher after realities. In the 'twenties Carl Neergaard was the foremost Danish archaeolo- gist. In the 'thirties Danish prehistoric research entered upon a busy period, with the arrange- ment of the new National Museum buildings, and the excavation of the many new discoveries out in the country. The rapid developments in re- search showed the need for a new handbook; and then in 1938-40 appeared Brondsted's Danmarks Oldtid. After synthesis, research proceeds along the path of analysis, with new investigations and observations. Since the days of MUller, Danish archaeology has been characterized by two things: intimate cooperation with the schooled classical archaeology, and a markedly critical sobriety. In recent years the former trait has dropped somewhat into the background, whereas sobriety, being innate, will undoubtedly persist. Outstanding Danish archaeologists today are: Mathiassen, Broholm, Glob, Becker, Winther. Swedish archaeology in the first years of the century was under the influence of its great figure, Oscar Montelius. New faces soon ap- peared, however: Salin, with his large work on animal ornamentation (he succeeded Montelius as King's Custodian of Antiquities); Almgren, who with his book on the Scandinavian Iron Age fibulae created an instrument that is indispensa- able to this day; Stjerna, a worker with a fertile mind who passed away all too early. Swedish archaeologists look well about them, as is evi- denced by Ture Arne, eastern in his orientation, and Nils Aberg, erudite in continental matters. Swedish archaeologists have never shrunk from bold hypotheses, and in their collaboration with the natural sciences they have held the lead. Of late years Sweden has also obtained her large new museum, impressive in its lay-out, radical in its modern technique of display. Important names in Swedish archaeology now are Arne, Rydbeck, Lindqvist, Ekholm, Aberg, Arbman, Stenberger. A painful loss was the death of Fors- sander. In her archaeological research Finland is naturally governed by her easterly situation. Russia, the Baltic States, Sweden edge the hori- zon. Since the deaths of Hackman, Ailio and Tall- gren, the leading men there now are: Nordman, Ainiipai*i, Cleve and Kivikoski. A fresh breeze meets us from Norway's ar- chaeology. The two leading personalities during the past generation have been Shetelig and A. W. Brogger. Brogger is outstandingly a culture-his- torian who predilectively allowed his studies to cut right across all rubrics, periods and systems. His indefatigable initiative has been behind all the new and brisk happenings in Norwegian archaeology. Shetelig is one of the most versatile workers in Scandinavia. These two have in- spired a group of younger men who are devoting themselves to the work today as they will to- morrow: Bee, Hougen, Grieg, Gjessing. For obvious reasons Iceland can share in Scan- dinavian archaeology only from the Viking Age; but in exploring this, the closing period of an- tiquity in Scandinavia, she is active too, as will be seen from the circumstance (among others) that just before the war a joint Scandinavian ex- pedition carried out important excavations of Icelandic farm sites dating from saga times (see below, no. 33). The chief results of Scandinavian archaeology will be given below in brief form as "Excavations and Finds" for the period 1940-1947. The fol- lowing abbreviations are used: Aarboger, Aar- boger for nordisk Oldkyndighed oj Historie, Copenhagen; Arbejdsmarken, Fra Nationalmiis- ects Arbejdsmark, Copenhagen. EXCAVATIONS AND FINDS Mesolithic 1. Station at Bromme. Denmark. In mid-Zealand, at Bromme, Erik Westerby in 1944 found traces of what so far is the earliest known dwelling-site in Denmark, dating from Early Mesolithic or Palaeolithic times. Exca- vated 1945-46 by Therkel Mathiassen (see Aarboger, 1946, French summary) the site is a low sandy spit jutting into a bog along a brook. It was inhabited in the so-called "Allerod pe- riod," a climatically mild break in Denmark's Late Glacial Age (about 10,000 B.c.). The list of finds comprises flint alone and consists of arrow heads ("Lyngby type"), scrapers and burins. There are neither axes nor microliths. The ani- mal bones (reindeer, elk, wolverine, beaver and swan) indicate an arctic fauna with an incipient woodland character.</page><page sequence="25">ARCHAEOLOGICAL NEWS 223 2. Stations at Holmegaard. Denmark. Stations of the Maglemose period, about 6000 B.c., have previously been examined in the bogs of South Zealand at Svaerdborg and Holme- gaard (see Aarboger, 1918 and 1924). Another complex of stations was unearthed in Holme- gaard bog in 1944 (the fourth), being excavated by C. J. Becker (see Arbejdsmarken, 1945). It provided important new features for throwing light upon the Maglemose culture: remains of huts with floors of strips of bark; well-preserved reinforced bows of elm; arrow shafts of mountain- ash or birch, sharpened at the point, where there is a groove containing traces of resin, probably once serving to hold a microlith as a barb (see the arrows of the southeastern Spanish meso- lithic rock paintings at Alpera, cf. Breuil-Ober- maier); other arrow shafts with a thick cylindri- cal head, i.e. knob-arrows, such as those used by several primitive peoples today; spear heads of wood with grooves for the insertion of flint edges. Becker points out that the reinforced type of bow as well as the knob-arrows and the spear heads with flint edges suggest the so-called "cir- cumpolar" culture circle (see below, no. 54). 3. Stations at Ageraid. Sweden. In Ageraid bog in western Scania in 1946-47 Carl-Axel Althin after extensive excavations has been able to demonstrate the presence of six mesolithic settlements (dating from the later part of the Boreal period through early Atlantic times). The excavators made use of the method founded by J. Troels-Smith, according to which geological and pollen-analytical measurements and samples are taken in a long vertical trench (running at right-angles to the shore-line) from dry land out into the bog, and at the same time all culture remains encountered in the trench are measured three-dimensionally. This estab- lishes a close contact between archaeology and geology, and the actual excavation of the sites is only undertaken when this is completed. The method ensures that the various cultural strata are kept separate, for strata which in the dry- land station often lie immediately over one an- other or are mixed up, have their equivalents out in the bog distinctly separated stratigraphi- cally. These excavations, which have not yet been completed, have yielded a rich material of finds from various mesolithic periods. Cf. Holger Arbman in Fornvdinnen, 1947. 4. Station at HaIJljarp. Sweden. In the course of the excavation in 1947 of a station at Hiiljarp in Scania, on the east shore of The Sound, Carl-Axel Althin has succeeded in finding all four Litorina transgressions. Work is continuing. 5. Stations at Aamosen. Denmark. Aamosen is a large bog area in mid-Zealand in which more than sixty stations of mesolithic and neolithic times have been found (the most important site is called Qgaarde). Therkel Mathi- assen, who has published these finds in the series Nordiske Fortideminder, Copenhagen, 1943, un- der the title of Stenalderbopladser i Aamosen (French summary), claims that here the Magle- mose culture continued to exist right down into neolithic times, influenced more or less dis- tinctly by other contemporary culture groups (Ertebolle, Gudenaa). 6. Station at Dyrholmen. Denmark. In Det kgl. danske Videnskabernes Selskab, Arkmol.-kunsthistor. Skrifter, i, 1, 1942, the ar- chaeologist Therkel Mathiassen, the zoologist Magnus Degerbol and the geologist-pollen an- alyst J. Troels-Smith have published an impor- tant Stone Age find under the title Dyrholmen. En Stenalderboplads paa Djursland (German summary). This rich find from East Jutland rep- resents three zones: I (contemporary with and possibly earlier than the middle of the High- Atlantic Transgression); II (contemporary with the Regression after the above Transgression); III (contemporary with the Late-Atlantic and the sub-Boreal Transgression). Zones I and II are mesolithic, III neolithic. In Zone I Degerbol has demonstrated unequivocal traces of widespread cannibalism. 7. Human figures in Zealand. Denmark. On an aurochs bone from Ryemarksgaard are incised five small clothed human figures, two full face, three in profile, schematic and stylized, it is true, but quite animated in draftmanship. An axe of stag antler from Jordlese has on it a rather crudely incised human figure seen in pro- file. A bone dagger with flint edges has a human figure drawn in single line. Ryemarksgaard dates</page><page sequence="26">224 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGY back to Maglemose times, the others are late- mesolithic. See J. Brondsted in ActaArchaeologica, 1940, and Therkel Mathiassen in Arbejdsmarken, 1941 and Stenalderbopladser i Aamosen, Copen- hagen, 1943. 8. Fish traps in Zealand. Denmark. Four finds of more or less fragmentary fish traps of basketry, datable to late-mesolithic and early-mesolithic times. See C. J. Becker in Aar- beger, 1941 and in Fra det gamle Gilleleje, 1943 (French and English summaries). Neolithic 9. Station at Barkjaer. Denmark. On a small holm in Djursland (East Jutland), surrounded by water in the Stone Age, were found two rows of house-sites, about thirty in all, rectangular, 7X9 meters, with a "street" about 10 meters wide between the rows. In front and in back of the houses are pavings. The finds con- sist of flint artifacts and pottery of early-neo- lithic times. The station was excavated in 1947 by P. V. Glob. Unpublished. 10. Station at Vivastemfla. Sweden. A cord-pottery station was excavated in 1939 by Axel Bagge (Stendldersboplatsen vid Vivastem- dca, Stockholm, 1941; German summary), in SmAland, Southeast Sweden. An important link in a number of stations showing that the early cord-pottery culture spread not only into the southern and western parts of South Sweden but also into the eastern parts. 11. Station at Blandebjerg. Denmark. This station is the third large neolithic site found and excavated on the island of Langeland by Jens Winther. The earliest of the three is Troldebjerg (about 2000 B.c.), of importance on account of its house-sites, its curious sacral hearths and the find of the sacred axe with votive gifts. The latest is Lind0 which is late-neolithic. Between these in age is Blandebjerg, where the sacral hearths and the sacred axe were found again. See J. Winther, Lind , i-ii, 1926, 1928; Troldebjerg, 1935 (and Tilleg, 1938); Blande- bjerg, 1943. (The last two have German sum- maries.) 12. Station and cemetery at Visterbjers. Swe- den. This station, on the large Baltic island of Got- land and belonging to the later part of the neo- lithic period (beginning of the second millen- nium) is described by the archaeologist Mxrten Stenberger, the geologist H. Munthe, and the anthropologist Elias Dahr in the monograph Das Grabfeld von V`iterbjers auf Gotland, Lund, 1943. The graves, 88 in all, contained more or less well- preserved skeletons, usually lying extended and face upwards; they were interred in gravel in flat graves. The grave furniture reflects a mixed cul- ture, influenced from north, west, and south, Stenberger refers especially to the Ostdorf cem- etery in Mecklenburg. The 21 skulls recovered are chiefly dolichocephalic. 13. Stations and house-sites at Trtena. Norway. Trana is a group of islands off the Norwegian coast (Helgeland) south of Lofoten. The largest of the islands, Sanda, has produced both cave finds and house-sites. The largest is the imposing cave known as Kirkhelleren, facing the sea. Both in Kirkhelleren and elsewhere habitation ex- tends in time from the late neolithic to the migration period, i.e. roughly over 2500 years. Some of the houses were round, others rectangu- lar in shape. Over the old cultural deposits in Kirkhelleren was a mediaeval cemetery. The finds were published in Gutorm Gjessing in the monograph Tran-Funnene (Inst. for sammen- lignende Kulturforskning, Oslo, 1943). 14. Station at Hedningahiillan. Sweden. On Hedningahlillan, an isolated mountain- plateau in Hiulsingland, a culture deposit has been found with sherds of comb-pottery and with a touch of the Swedish boat-axe culture. Holger Arbman, who discusses the find in Strena Ar- chaeologica A. M. Tallgren sexagenario dedi- cata, considers the remains to be those of a Finnish colony at the close of the Stone Age. Bronze Age 15. Two horned bronze helmets from Viks0. Denmark. (Pl. xxI, A). Two fairly well-preserved, magnificent horned helmets were found in 1942 in a North Zealand bog; they are of thin, chased sheet bronze and the technique and ornamentation classify them as having been imported from the HIallstatt or the Villanova cultural circle. On the other hand, the horns, which are of cast bronze, are probably of Danish workmanship and applied to these foreign</page><page sequence="27">ARCHAEOLOGICAL NEWS 25 helmets. Horned helmets are familiar, e.g. from Swedish rock carvings. Period: Prpsumably 9th- 8th cent. B.C. See H. Norling Christensen in Arbejdsmarken, 1943 and Acta Archaeologica, 1946. 16. Tumulus at Slotsbjergby. Denmark. Large burial mound in West Zealand, ex- cavated 1946-47 by P. V. Glob (see Arbejds- marken, 1947), The excavations have provided an interesting insight into the design and struc- ture of a prehistoric mound. There were three phases: lowest, a low mound, datable from its urn graves to about 800-700 B.c.; overlying it a somewhat larger mound of the Late Bronze Age (about 500 B.C.); and uppermost the very large mound dating from the Late Iron Age (after 500 A.D.). The tumulus was sited on cultivated Bronze Age fields. In later historic times, pre- sumably the Late Middle Ages, the mound was used for executions and interment of the exe- cuted. 17. Bogged wooden ploughs from Jutland. Den- mark. In Acta Archaeologica, 1942 and in Strena Archaeologica A. M. Tallgren sexagenario dedi- cata, Helsingfors, 1945, P. V. Glob describes three new finds of wooden ploughs in Jutland bogs: Hvorslev and Sejbaek, both sole ploughs of the so-called Walle type, and Donneruplund, an ard of the D0strup type. Both sole plough and ard are figured in South Swedish Bronze Age rock carvings. The Donneruplund plough is an unusually well-preserved specimen. According to Glob, these Danish ploughs found in bogs and dating from the Late Bronze Age were votive deposits: the plough itself, or a part of it, was laid out as an offering to higher powers for the safety and success of the crops. A fragmentary plough from Norre Smederup bog in Jutland is so unused and at the same time of such poor qual- ity that possibly it was employed only for a single ploughing rite; such a scene is depicted in a South Swedish rock carving. 18. Bronze shield from Taarup. Denmark. (PI. XIV, B). During peat-cutting operations in 1946 in Taarup bog, on the island of Falster, was dis- covered a fine oval shield of thin, chased bronze ornamented with concentric rings and with round dots in close rows, all in embossed work. An imported shield, probably from east Central Europe (Hungary). Period: Late Bronze Age, presumably 9th-8th cent. B.c. - See C. J. Becker in Arbejdsmarken, 1947. 19. Arm-and-hand carvings from Zealand and Funen. Denmark. (P1. xv, A.) A curious symbol, consisting of a human fore- arm and hand with three to five horizontal lines at the ends of the fingers, has been found in seven different East-Danish localities, including two graves of Late Bronze Age times. A similar symbol is sometimes shown in conjunction with ships on South Swedish rock carvings. Presum- ably a sacred sign with benedictory or protective powers. See Johannes Brondsted in Acta Archae- ologica, 1941; H. Norling Christensen in Arbejds- marken, 1942. Iron Age 20. Fortified refuge and village at Borremose. Denmark. In the years 1934-42 Johannes Brondsted and P. V. Glob excavated a fortified holm, situated in a North Jutland bog, Borremose, Himmerland (not far from the spot where the famous Gunde- strup silver vessel was found). This holm, which was surrounded by water and swamp in the Early Iron Age, had been fortified by means of a sur- rounding moat and another shorter moat at the place where the distance to dry land was short- est. The encircling moat is about 2 meters deep, about 6 meters in width, and the earth dug out to make it was thrown up as a rampart. When completed, the distance from the top of the ram- part to the outer bank of the moat was 8 meters, and to the bottom of the moat 4 meters. At several places the bottom and sides of the moat were provided with pointed wooden sticks and spikes. In the fill now excavated from the moat were found a large number of these defensive spikes and a well-preserved measuring rod of oak with incisions at every 16- cm. (=half a Greek foot); moreover a rich collection of pot- tery, partly an early deposit contemporary with the fortress (Early Iron Age, second or first cen- tury B.C.), partly a later deposit of the same period as the village which about the beginning of the Christian era was founded on the site of the gradually dismantled fortress. This village had consisted of about 20 rectangular houses with walls of turf, free roof-bearing posts in two rows,</page><page sequence="28">226 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGY and a roof of heather; between the houses wound a stone-paved street. On the north inside the rampart was a watering place. Where the dis- tance to dry land was shortest the villagers had laid a road 3 meters wide and about 70 meters long, stone-paved, to take cattle, etc. between the holm and the fields and pastures on the dry land around it. See Johannes Brondsted in Ar- bejdsmarken, 1936; P. V. Glob, Danske Oldtids- minder, 1949. 21. Bog-interred corpse from Borremose. Den- mark. (Pl. xv, B.) Close to the above fastness and village in Bor- remose, North Jutland (Himmerland), the dis- covery was made in 1946 of the naked body of a man, the back of his head smashed and a severed noose round his neck. At the feet lay two short mantles or capes of sheepskin. Across the body lay a birch cudgel, possibly a symbol of justice. The man had been hanged, the back of his head fractured by a blow, and his right arm broken. Whether these mutilations were inflicted prior to the hanging (torture) or afterwards to ward off ghosts, is uncertain. He had then been sunk in the bog. The soft parts of the body were well preserved; an analysis of the contents of the in- testines showed that his last meal had been a gruel of spurry and polygonum. About a hundred similar corpses have been found in the bogs of the Jutland peninsula, north- west Germany and Holland. Where a dating has been possible they have proved to be Early Iron Age. The Borremose man is probably about two thousand years old. As is well known, Tacitus says in Germania, 12, that among the Germanic tribes traitors and deserters were hanged on trees, whereas cowards and those who indulged in unnatural practices were drowned in bogs. See Knud Thorvildsen in Arbejdsmarken, 1947. 29. Paved road at Tibirke. Denmark. At Tibirke a stone-paved road, 3 meters wide and about 150 meters long, through a bog for the purpose of connecting a holm in the bog with dry land, was excavated by E. Kunwald in 1943- 46 (see Arbejdsmarken, 1944). The road, which is of exactly the same type as the one in Borremose (see above, no. 20) was built of two rows of large kerbstones flanking a roadway of smaller stones and can be dated by means of two bronze fibulae found on it to the Celtic Iron Age (the last centuries B.C.). 23. Village at Vallhagar. Sweden. Vallhager lies on the island of Gotland, near its east coast. There, under the leadership of MArten Stenberger, a number of young archae- ologists from Sweden, Denmark, England, Fin- land, Norway and Iceland worked in 1946 and 1947 on the excavation of a Gotlandic settlement of Roman Iron Age: 20 houses and 3 cemeteries. The object was to obtain a picture of social life and occupations. In addition to the already fa- miliar Gotlandic type of house with two rows of inside posts and broad, stone-built wall founda- tions, a few unusual types were unearthed (one of which has been interpreted as a drying-house for grain). The houses are grouped in complexes (farms) in which every building has its function (byre, dwelling, etc.). The remains of a baking- oven and a vertical loom have been found. Grains and domestic animal bones (especially horse) bear witness of field and animal husband- ry, as do finds of plough-shares, sickles, short scythes, etc. On the old fields in the vicinity are still to be seen heaps of stones removed when clearing the ground for cultivation. A continua- tion will be made in 1948 with osteologists, bot- anists, geologists and pollen-analysts. An important trait in these investigations is their inter-Scandinavian character. Cf. Forn- viinnen, 1947 (Stenberger). 24. Double grave at Dollerup. Denmark. In 1947 M. Qrsnes Christensen and Olfert Voss excavated a double Roman Iron Age grave at Dollerup in South Jutland, a flat grave. It consisted of two bole coffins laid E-W, a man's and a woman's. Remnants of teeth indicated that the heads lay to the west. In the man's grave (to the south) were found a silver fibula, two gold finger-rings, two spurs (of iron, bronze and silver), two bronze situlae, two silver cups (pl. xvi, A, on a tray of plaited osier), an iron knife, a bone comb, three clay vessels. In the woman's grave lay a fibula of silver and iron, two drinking horns with bronze mountings (rim, chains and cow-head shaped end-cap), a gold finger ring, an iron knife, several small silver mountings, three clay vessels. In the space be- tween the coffins were two sets of clay vessels,</page><page sequence="29">ARCHAEOLOGICAL NEWS 227 each consisting of a large jar and a shallow bowl. -Period presumably about 200 A.D. 95. Offering place in bog at Kiiringsjoin. Sweden. A sacred place in Halland, near Halmstad, was used by the surrounding population as an offer- ing place in the 3rd and 4th centuries. It was examined in former times by various archaeolo- gists and in 1941 by Holger Arbman, who de- scribes the find in his book Kiiringsjin, Studier i Halliindsk jiirnrlder (Stockholm, 1945; English summary). It is rich in pottery and wood. The find is of a peaceable character and in this it differs from the otherwise analogous large Danish bog finds of about the same period. This excellent publication makes abundant use of ethnological comparative material in the classification of the various objects of wood. 26. Two cemeteries at Kjuloholm. Finland. A total of 32 graves have been found at Kjulo, south Finland (uncremated, flat graves) chiefly of the seventh century A.D, some a little earlier. Excavated by Nils Cleve, who published the re- sults in Finska fornminnesfireningens Tidskrift, 1943. A third cemetery (Viking Age) will be pub- lished later. Cleve's copious paper includes both cultural history (clothing, weapons, crafts, etc.) and settlement history. 27. Tumulus at Raknehaugen. Norway. The largest tumulus in Scandinavia (15 meters high, 95 meters in diameter) is situated in Ullen- saker, south Norway. Excavated in 1869-70 by Anders Lorange and in 1939-40 by Sigurd Grieg (see Viking, 1941). The mound proved to contain three hard-compressed layers of timbers as- sembled in a tent-like structure, but no grave. Grieg considers the timbering to be in imitation of the great pyre constructions built for the ob- sequies of the Roman emperors (e.g. Septimius Severus's pyre, described by Herodian). He re- gards Raknehaugen as a cenotaph and is inclined to estimate its date as of the sixth century. Viking Age 28. Boat-Grave at Arby. Sweden. A plundered boat-grave of the Viking Age was found at Arby, in Uppland. See Holger Arbman in Acta Archaeologica, 1940, where a lot of im- plements and household utensils of wood as well as horse and dog skeletons are published. 29. Tumulus at Gjermundbu. Norway. In Ringerike, south Norway, at the Gjer- mundbu farms, was a low long-barrow in which were two graves. Grave I contained ring-mail and, packed closely together in an iron cauldron, a sword, two spear heads, 8 arrow heads, a hel- met, four shield bosses, three gaming pieces, two dice, a pair of stirrups, a pair of spurs, 5 bits, 3 strap buckles, 4 iron hooks, 3 knives, mountings from a casket, and various kitchen utensils. Grave II yielded a sword, a spear head, an axe, and a bit. Both graves were cremation graves. See Sigurd Grieg, "Gjermundbu-Funnet" in Norske Oldfunn, viii, (Oslo, 1947), a compre- hensively descriptive publication with excur- suses on the history of the helmet and mail in Scandinavian antiquity and on Ringerike finds and monuments of the Viking Age. 30. Cemetery at Ihre. Sweden. This large cemetery, situated on the island of Gotland, has almost a thousand graves, some covered with a low mound of stones ("rise"), some flat graves. In time it spans the period from the Migration Age to the end of the Viking Age. M&amp;rten Stenberger in Fornviinnen, 1942, writes on his examination of a number of the graves here, both cremation and inhumation graves. It is possible that future excavations here will throw some light upon the little known burial custom in the early part of Gotland's Viking Age. 31. Tumulus at Jelling. Denmark. The southern of the two great "royal barrows," Denmark's largest monuments of the kind (7-8 meters high, 60-70 meters in diameter) at Jell- ing, South Jutland, had already been examined in 1861 by means of subterranean tunnelling, under the leadership of Worsaae. In 1941-42 this great mound was again examined by Ejnar Dyggve (see Arbejdsmarken, 1943, ActaArchaeo- logica, 1942). The mound proved to consist of a core of heather and grass sods laid horizontally, over which was a covering of sandy or clayey sods, and finally an uppermost covering of mould. It had been erected in three periods. There was no grave in it (see Raknehaugen, above no. 27), but a curious, slender wooden structure, symbolic and for the present inexplica- ble. At the bottom of the mound were found a</page><page sequence="30">228 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGY number of large boulders, "menhirs," which turned out to be the remains of the enclosure round an immense, triangular sacred area, laid out in relation to the northern "royal barrow" and to the earlier of the two Jelling runic stones. The south mound at Jelling was built in the second half of the tenth century; the north mound is somewhat earlier. 32. Fortified camp at Trelleborg. Denmark. (P1. xvw, B) In the years 1934-42 Poul N0rlund excavated a large ring-shaped complex at Trelleborg in West Zealand (see Arbejdsmarken, 1936), dating from about the year 1000. Details of this, the most important of all Danish excavations in re- cent years, are withheld until publication (in 1948). In 1946 C. G. Schultz at Aggersborg in North Jutland found the remains of a quite analogous ring-shaped fortification, now ploughed up and practically invisible. There are parallel phenomena in England not yet excavated. 33. Farm sites in Iceland. Eight farm sites were excavated in 1939 in Iceland by Scandinavian archaeologists, six of them in Pj6rsardalur, a valley near the volcano Hekla. In 1943 appeared the publication Forn- tida gardar i Island (Old farms in Iceland), Copenhagen, edited by M&amp;rten Stenberger. The work contributes to our knowledge and under- standing of the Icelandic dwellings in the Viking and Middle Ages. There are also interesting zoo- logical and anthropological sections. Jon Steffen- sen, the anthropologist, believes that the skeletal material suggests a Celtic intrusion into Iceland's first colonization. CZECHOSLOVAKIA By Professor Karel Absolon, Brno, Czechoslovakia1 The German occupation of Bohemia and Moravia gravely disrupted the healthy develop- ment of Czechoslovak archaeology. For political reasons, the field of ancient Slav archaeology attracted the attention of the Nazis. German pre- historic works published under the Hitler regime prove that even archaeology was brought into line to support German political and expansionist aims. Their scientists attempted to prove the great antiquity of the Germanic settlement in the Czech lands. They maintained without ex- ception that the Slavs arrived very late in Bo- hemia and Moravia, and they reverted to the obsolete and discarded theory that the Slavs were brought to Central Europe by the Avars only in the sixth century. The Slavs, the Ger- mains claimed, merely copied the elements of civilization and social achievements from the highly developed Germans. Prior settlement by Germanic tribes was claimed so that the absorp- tion of the so-called Protectorate by the Greater German Reich could be justified on historic grounds. In pursuit of their theories the Germans resorted to clumsy misstatements. The tomb of a Przemyslid knight excavated on the Prague citadel, dating from the ninth century, was called the tomb of a Germanic warrior. A rare diadem of the same period, found in Stare Mesto in Moravia was used to prove the Germanic na- ture of the population, though its Byzantine origin is quite obvious. Professor Franz from Leipzig recommended that "inconvenient" ar- chaeological discoveries should be suppressed. In spite of the Nazis' efforts, a number of im- portant works were published during the years of occupation. Dr. Ivan Borkovsky's Ancient Slav Ceramics in Central Europe (Prague, 1940) is the first comprehensive and thorough account of the oldest known Slav ceramics in Bohemia, Moravia, and Central Europe. It proves the an- tiquity of Slav culture, antedating written his- tory. These ceramics are relics of an autoch- thonous population, which produced them under the influence of the late Latin culture. Chrono- logically these undecorated ceramics go back to before the fourth century of our era and continue until the sixth and seventh centuries, forming the basis for the ancient Slav ornamental ceram- ics. Dr. Jiri Neustupny, curator of the prehistoric section of the National Museum in Prague, states in his work, "The Oldest Slav Culture in Bo- hemia" (Journal of the National Museum, 1939), that the existence of Slav culture in Bohemia and Moravia in the fifth and sixth century does not mean that the Slavs settled then only. The dis- coveries prove merely that these areas were oc- cupied by Slavs, but the question when they arrived remains open. The statements of Drs. Borkovsky and Neu- '1Prepared with the help of his pupil, Frantisek Adamek of Brno.</page><page sequence="31">ARCHAEOLOGICAL NEWS 229 stupny provoked, on the German side, the book of v. Zotz and v. Richthofen, Is Bohemia-Moravia the Original Home of the Czechs? (1940), in which they disputed the antiquity and autochthonous nature of Slav culture in the Czech lands. Josef Poulik, curator of the Brno branch of the Archaeological Institute, in his book, Slavs in Moravia to the Era of the Great Moravian Empire (Archaeol. Library, Brno, 1947), supple- mented and confirmed the statements of Dr. Borkovsky on the basis of his Moravian excava- tions. He determined the order of evolution of Slav ceramics from the types called the "Prague type" by Borkovsky to the ceramics of the Great Moravian era in the second half of the ninth cen- tury. He also points out that the Slavs were living in the sweep of the Carpathians long before the Avars, so that the arrival of the Slavs in Central Europe cannot be linked to that of the Avars. At least from the fourth century on, southern Moravia and the territory between the rivers Danube and Frein (Dyje) were occupied without interruption by Slavs with their own distinct culture. Poulik published an earlier study, Skeleton Tombs in Blucina, based upon the interesting tombs in Blucina in Moravia, correcting earlier theories about the chronological order and age of Slav ceramics (Prague, 1941). Prof. E. Simek in his paper, Western Slav and Germanic Tribes, deals with the ancient expan- sion of the two races in Central Europe. He does not believe that the Czechs are the original in- habitants of Bohemia, nor that any nations in Central Europe can make similar claims, since that whole area has been the crossroads of na- tions since time immemorial. Nazi publications about the Slavs are ana- lyzed by Dr. F. Kalousek in The German Science in the Service of Nazi Anti-Slav Propaganda. Jaromir Korcak dealt with the question of the origin and development of Czech Slavs in his study, The Ethnic Profile of Our Nation (Prague, 1940). He places the cradle of the Czech nation near the river Morava. This area shows the long- est continuity of settlement of the neolithic age in central Europe, which in turn continues palae- olithic settlements. In the first volume of his work, The Origin of the Czech Nation (Prague, 1946), Professor J. Slavik touches upon the earliest days of the nation. A very good study is Bohumil Horak's paper, "The Settlements of the Slavs at the Dawn of History" (Geographic Journal, xi, 2), which regis- ters the results of discoveries made until now about the origin and development of the ancient Slavs. An outstanding work is Dr. Jan Filip's The Beginning of Slav Settlement in Czechoslovakia (Prague, 1946). He proves that the ancient so- called Lausitz culture and the cultures derived from it belong ethnically to the Slav group. The Lausitz culture, of autochthonous Central Euro- pean origin, caused a revolution in the ancient history of Central Europe and covered approxi- mately the period from the thirteenth century B.c. until the first century of the Christian era. This culture, which spread in all directions, was essentially agricultural, with settlements located in fertile parts of the country. The Lausitz people used cremation consistently as their method of burial. The quantity and quality of the discov- ered relics prove a very high cultural level. Dr. Neustupny published a paper on The Ancient History of the Lausitz in Prague, 1946. New archaeological discoveries correct existing notions about the low culture of the ancient Slavs at the time of their Christianization. In six volumes of the Velehrad Collections for the years 1939-1947 much valuable material is published for the history of the Great Moravian Empire. These are the results of great discoveries by the archaeologist Antonin Zelitius in Stare Mesto in southeast Moravia, where the capital of Great Moravia has been definitely located. Many finds of jewels of Byzantine origin prove the cultural and political contacts between Great Moravia and Byzantium between the eighth and the tenth centuries. Further reports about these discoveries can be found in some monographs of Zelitius, e.g Stare Mesto, 1946; Stare Mesto, Uh. Hradiste and Babice, 1944; Stare Mesto- Spitalky, 1944. A collection of stories and legends about early Christianity in Bohemia and Moravia was pub- lished by Prof. Vaclav Chaloupecky, Josef Va- sica, Bohumil Ryba and others in The Dawn of Christianity, Prague, 1942. Dr. Jaroslav Baihm's book, Chronicle of Dis- coveries, Prague, 1942, occupies an important position among general prehistoric and archae- ological works dealing with the ancient history of the Czech lands.</page><page sequence="32">280 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGY A related picture of the ancient history of the Czechs is given in the excellent Czech National Chronicle (first part, Prague, 1940) by Dr. J. Neustupny. The same author has made an im- portant contribution to Czechoslovak science in his book, Prehistory of Mankind (Prague, 1946), where he discusses the world's important ar- chaeological discoveries of the last fifty years. Dr. Neustupny also has published a number of monographs such as The Religion of the Primeval Inhabitants of Bohemia and Moravia (Prague, 1940), Cremation of the Dead in Bohemia and Moravia (Prague, 1941), and Primeval Art in Bohemia and Moravia (Prague, 1941). In The Evolution of Mankind in Prehistoric Times (1940), Professor J. Schranil deals with European and non-European peoples and their cultures. Dr. J. Filip describes some features of prehis- toric life in Cultural Chapters of Our Prehistory (Prague, 1940) and Prehistoric Craftsmanship (Prague, 1941). Dr. J. Boihm published an interesting book on the origin and function of Slavic and Celtic Towns; Our Oldest Cities (Prague, 1946). Rudolph Turek has published monographs on the sites in Slavnikova Libice and the Prachov Rocks, Settlements and Tombs of the Ancient Slavs (Prague, 1946). Frantisek Adamek wrote a comparative study of neolithic cultures in Moravia and their rela- tion to late palaeolithic and mesolithic cultures (published in the magazine Priroda). Together with Professor Absolon he compiled the first scientific typological analysis of flint artifacts which will form the basis for the Moravian neo- lithic typology. Among short papers and articles the following should be mentioned: I. Borkovsky, "A Celtic Impression from Bohemia"; K. Tihelka, "A New Cultural Group of the Bronze Period in Mora- via"; J. Dezort, "The Relations of Moravia with the Southeast in the Bronze Period"; Fr. Adamek, "Byzantine Relics in Ancient Slav Tombs in Malomerice," and "Ancient Slav Dis- coveries in the Malomerice Tombs." Professor Absolon's excavations in the impor- tant diluvial stations in Moravia, especially in Unter-Wisternitz and Predmost, were halted by the Nazis and in some instances taken over by the SS. The Nazis also confiscated and looted his private library with its unique collection of pa- laeontological literature. Manuscripts and price- less collections were stolen, abused, and de- stroyed. Since he refused to convert the Anthro- pos Institute into an institute for Nazi-style anthropology, they took it over and it was eventually destroyed. In spite of these losses he was able to reconstruct some important papers and manuscripts. He has published one book, Mammonth Hunter Stations in Moravia, in 1945 and others are in the course of publication. Some articles about his discoveries will appear in the AJA. Other articles have been published in ILN and Toronto Star of Canada in 1946 and 1947. AUSTRIA By H. Vetters In the years 1939-1945, archaeological activ- ity in Austria was concerned mainly with the preservation of chance finds. Those excavations, which were begun before the war, were provi- sionally concluded. These are described at the beginning of the following report. Only the in- vestigations of the Dutch archaeologist, Asien Bohmers, in Unter-Wisternitz, have been lost beyond recovery, all records having been de- stroyed in the burning of Schloss Nikolsburg. Restoration of the war-damaged institutes oc- cupied 1945 and 1946, and field work was not resumed until 1947. Chance finds will be mentioned under the ap- propriate period, prehistoric materials having been made available through the kindness of G. Mossler of the Bundesdenkmalamt. All of them have been or will be published in the annual Fundberichte aus Osterreich. A. EXCAVATIONS Carnuntum The war prevented the carrying out of the plans to excavate the whole of the city, which under the direction of E. Swoboda proposed to turn the area into an open-air museum. Actually, it is not yet possible to determine the nature of the building complex uncovered before cessation of work in June, 1940, whether it may have been a palace, or baths (see plan, fig. 1; pl. xvi, c). The entire area constituted a "Centuria" of the ancient city, and is rectangular in shape, 143.41 X99.60 m., with the long axis north-south. The</page><page sequence="33">ARCHAEOLOGICAL NEWS 231 surrounding wall, which has been explored on the west and north, is bounded on the former side by a canal 0.77-0.80 m. wide, draining to the Danube on the north. The side of the canal is supplied by the socle of the wall, which is built of the same large cut stones as make up the pave- ment of the court. On the south and west of the court, the interior of the wall is lined with a por- tico, 4.00 m. wide, the entrance of which lies in former opening through three doorways onto the court, here crossed diagonally by a canal. To the west of 9 lay the little room 8, with hypocausts, and before it, the foundations of two pillars. Of the little complex to the north, 11 contained ashes from the heating of 8. In the narrow room 14, the heating arrangements could be especially well observed. The hypercaustal columns stood on a cement floor, and were 1.00-1.10 m. high, P-(APNVNTVMo IIMISR STASS I S??l ?i~d hi-~ n7 t __ A-B] 19, 15 4 .t , L - 210 i 1 1742.19 2 II 1452Yf3-L T I ..43 10 io rn O.MYf k-LATU .1932 FIG. 1.

Within this enclosure stood a building consist- ing of a number of large rooms, the dimensions and relationships of which may be seen from the plan. Most of them contain hypocausts for heat- ing. Room 9, the largest, includes an apse at the east end. Over hypocausts, the floor was of water- cement 0.20-0.22 m. thick, and over this, slabs of Euboeic marble 0.08-0.10 m. thick. The walls were covered with thin (0.05 m.) slabs of marble, and at the top of the wall ran an egg-and-dart molding. The room was at least 6.00 m. high. To the south lay two large rooms, 10 and 20, both with hypocausts and furnaces at the side, the composed of tiles and slabs of stone. The floor above was of cement, 0.30 m. thick. Room 15, like 11, contained ashes, and the beginning of a stairway. Traces of reconstruction are evident in rooms 12 and 14. East of 14/15 are column foun- dations, and it is possible that the main entrance of the building is to be sought in this direction. Wall construction in the building consists partly of a double foundation wall, with fill be- tween the halves, then of a section of ashlars, and above them a row of tiles.'

It is dated to the Augustan period by the discovery of coins dating to the early years of that Emperor. Small finds included nails and pins, keys, knives, iron rings, bits, and farm equipment. Above the villa lay the remains of an Illyrian settlement, which was destroyed by a land-slide in the fourth century. The latest datable object was a coin of Constantine. Pottery was poor and local, with a striking absence of good sigillata. Iron objects occurred: a sword, daggers, arrow- points, etc. Below the villa lay the remains of a Veneto-Illyrian settlement of the La Tene Pe- riod, which yielded numerous bronze objects, in- cluding a sickle-shaped razor, a few iron objects, and a large quantity of pottery. About sixty com- plete pots have been put together, mostly of the Germans. The first, however, consisted of what was apparently a cult building, rectangular and including two fore-rooms on the east and one on the west, with an off-center altar of mica-bearing materials. The construction involved a frame of wooden posts supporting a gabled roof, with walls of stones laid dry. Nearby were other buildings, a dwelling and an assembly room, dated to the second half of the second century by a fibula with animal head and a bronze armband. Evidence of burning indicates that the settlement was de- stroyed by the Romans, after which it was de- serted for some centuries.3 Karnburg (Klagenfurt; Kiirnten) The investigation of the old Carolingian Kai- serpfalz was interrupted by the war, but was later resumed by the Kiirntner Geschichtsverein. 2 For burials of this type, cf.

Even in the times of the Empire, the salt mines were still profitable. Kelchalpe near Kitzbtihel Since 1931 the copper mines of the Hahnen- kamm (height about 1815 m.) have been sys- tematically observed, as the most important Austrian source of copper in the Bronze Age. Many otherwise perishable objects have been found in the layers of deposit saturated with copper salts, wooden shovels, spoons, cooking spoons, knives, buckets, spindles, shingles, and boards. Tallies reveal that a kind of writing existed. Bronze and pottery remains have con- tributed to the chronology of the Urnenfeld cul- ture of the north Tirol, which some also call HIittinger culture.7 Voisendorf, south of Vienna. P1l. xvII In the course of quarrying for gravel, an ex- tensive cemetery of the Neolithic to the Middle La Tene Periods was found, and explored by H. Ladenbauer. In addition to fifteen graves of the Linearkeramik, which show a mingling of the later phase of this pottery with that of the Lengyel (Theiss) culture, a village of the Hall- statt times was uncovered, with about fifteen dwellings. The site was occupied also in the Ur- nenfeld and in La Tene times. The burials were all cremation burials, either free in the soil, or covered with a stone slab. A plural burial of the Neolithic times covered with stone offers paral- lels with similar finds in Lower Austria, and be- longs to the northern Baden culture. Mauthusen (Gusen; Oberoisterreich). Pl. xviii In 1942 and the following years, H. Laden- bauer explored a cemetery of the Urnenfeld Period, which proved to belong to one brief time. The cremation burials, which are like those of Baiersdorf in Lower Austria, Vtisendorf south of Vienna, Aspern near Vienna, and Illmitz in Bur- genland show the strong influence of the Lausitz culture from the North, at the end of the Bronze Age. Linz (Ober isterreich) Since 1938, the Bundesdenkmalamt has con- cerned itself with the approximately five hundred archaeological areas in and around Linz. The period of Hallstatt C is particularly well repre- sented. A cemetery of the early seventh century of our era yielded remarkable finds of silver and gold objects, and pottery of the characteristic variety. The publication by H. Ladenbauer is in preparation. B. PREHISTORIC PERIOD Burgenland This district contains the route of the migra- tions, and was always thickly settled. The Wieselburg culture is represented in Oggau (Eisenstadt) by inhumation burials showing the contracted position. Neolithic scrapers and blades occur in the Zicksee (Neusiedl) area. To the same period belongs, perhaps, a female in- humation burial in Kalvarienberg, covered by a stone slab. To the right and the left of the tem- ples of the corpse lay a spiral of gold thread, and elsewhere in the tomb, several prettily decorated cups of the Baden culture. Kairnten Settlements of the Neolithic times have been found in Strappelkogel (Wolfsberg), of which G. Mossler prepares a publication, and in a cave in Eggerloch (Villach), which may have served as a winter dwelling. In the Sattnitzmoor, dredg- ing operations uncovered two great timbers of oak, 4.50-4.75 X0.60 X0.29-0.47 m., reinforced with ribs. Lack of parallels makes dating difficult, but a pollen analysis will be undertaken."7 Niederoisterreich The Landesmuseum and the Heimatsmuseen of Krems, Horn, Eggenburg, etc., have been active in the study of this period. The Lengyel culture is enriched by a male idol, painted pot- tery, and "Pilzgefiissen" from Hoipfenbtihel near Neubach (Melk),8 and hitherto unattested cre- mation burials, established by the discovery of two clay urns in Langenzersdorf (Vienna XXI). The early Bronze Age is represented by dwell- 7 This information has been forwarded by R.

Kriegler in Schleinbach, with graffiti drawn on sandstone, which may be identified as a station of the Aunjetitz culture, and a settlement of thirteen buildings in Lot 561 in Stillfried. Of the so-called Thrako-Cim- merian culture, a deposit at Haslau (Bruck am Leitha) furnished fibulae, hatchets, sickles, a bronze pot, and characteristic horse-trappings. A large settlement of the Hallstatt Period is evi- denced at Prinzendorf on the north bank of the Zaya by building-foundations and small finds. In the sediment of the Enns near Dorf was found a well-preserved long dagger of bronze, with a handle fastened with four rivets. Obertisterreich At Linz has been found the first contracted burial of the "Schnurkeramik" culture, oriented east and west, and containing in addition to the skeleton of an elderly woman a single damaged pot, now 0.143 m. high, of excellent quality. The profile suggests Bohemia.9 In St. Peter (Linz) in industrial construction were found many burials, cremation and inhumation, of Hallstatt B, C, and D, and La Thne. Bronze-Age burials yielded pot- tery, and bronze shovels, hair-pins, and ear and neck rings. At Wels, in the vicinity of the airport in the Welser Heide was found a burial of the earlier Urnenfeld culture, with sixteen urns as high as 0.80 m., which held ashes and various objects of clay and bronze. Salzburg In the castle park of Klessheim has been found an industrial building with a hearth in the cen- ter, which may be dated to the fifth century B.c., with the usual equipment and furnishings. It is to be published by M. Hell. A grave in Rainberg of the Hallstatt Period yielded a set of six knuckle bones, marked to serve as dice. In Hallstatt itself, an ancient working in the salt mine has been discovered, a chamber 6.00 X2.00 X2.50 m. cut in the almost pure salt vein, with colored traces here and there of the ancient bronze pick and two wooden steps or ladders. The discovery of a bronze dagger in the course of repairs on the Glocknerstrasse indicates that the Alps were accessible in the Bronze Age. Tirol-Vorarlberg A great Urn Field of the Hattting culture, discovered in Imst, includes 41 burials. Bronzes found there include arm-rings, nails with cylin- drical heads, punches, knives, and the charac- teristic semi-lunar razors, which occur frequently in the Villanovan period in Italy.xo Between Bodmann and Lipperingen on the Bodensee has been identified a large settlement of the Urnenfeld Culture, of the late Bronze Age. The site was formerly regarded, without investi- gation, as belonging to the Pile Construction People. With the support of the Bundesdenkmalamt, A. Held has been able to carry out extensive ex- cavations at Bludenz in the so-called Little Exerzierplatz. The earliest settlement is that of the Urnenfeld times, with an apparently Illyr- ian population. The next period shows the same population, identified in five cremation burials of the shallow style of the north Tirol. This is followed by traces of the late Hallstatt (C and D) of south Germany, which came from the North in the period 700-500 B.c. Then there came a new wave of the Illyrian Culture over the Arl- berg, the post-Hallstatt Melaun Culture; there are indications that the change was a violent one. Traces of the Fritzen and Sanzen Cultures are lacking, and the Melaun is replaced directly by the late La Tene. Here, the Celts appeared only in La Tone D, in the last century before the Roman conquest. Of these, there have been found a cavalry spur, bronze fibulae, lance points with sockets, knives, pearls, tools, and some fragments of the "Kammstrichgefaisse." The Roman period is represented by a military fibula and a large bronze coin of Domitian, while the Period of the Migrations left an Allemanic bone comb; these are stray finds, but furnish evidence that the region was not depopulated in these periods."

Nevertheless, in one grave was found a vase, the lead glaze of which had been dissolved by the vegetable acid of its contents. Seemingly, a jar of wine had been buried with the dead.12 In Weiden (Neusiedl am See), a grave of the second and third centuries, with a sarcophagus oriented west-southwest east-northeast, con- tained a denarius of the triumvir M.

Egger dis- covered in 1941 a great court 500X1,500 m. with a Roman cemetery in the northwest cor- ner. In the trash from the defense measures of 1944 has been found a marble statuette of a Priapian type, which will be published by C. Praschniker. KXRNTEN A sacred precinct has been excavated in Bal- dersdorf (Spittal an der Drau) by H. Dolenz, containing two temples and a smaller cult build- ing, with other buildings for administrative and technical purposes, including an iron foundry. The method of construction employed dry stone walls and wooden frame, in local fashion, and dates to the second and third centuries. No traces of burning were apparent. Of the finds, the best is a well-preserved goblet of pale green glass. The temples show a new variation on the Cel- tic rectangular form, since the cella does not lie in the geometrical center of the building.'4 A number of new inscriptions have been found. 1.

Egger in the Jahreshefte of the Austrian Archaeo- logical Institute. At St. Donath (St. Veit) has been discovered in 1943 a relief of the school of Virunum, showing a Maenad with a knife, about to sacrifice an ani- mal. The type suggests the dancing Maenad from Carnuntum.14a Nieder-sterreich A grave stone found in 1938 in Lichtenwarth (Wiener Neustadt) bears evidence to the early infiltration of Germans into Noricum. It may be dated on the basis of the script to the first century. The text is as follows: Tudro I Ariomani 1(iberto) an(norum) I XL h(ic) s(itus) e(st).15 The Roman camp at Mautern (Krems), the study of which was under the direction of the late Dr. Riedl, is better known as a result of building operations during the war years. Part of the cemetery has been explored, with early cremation burials followed by inhumations in stone caskets or merely in the earth. The dis- covery of a potter's oven offers advances in our knowledge of the pottery. A tile stamp provides additional evidence for the Cohors I Brittonum in the second century.'1 The text reads: (Co(hors) I A(elia) B(rittonum) Ant(oniniana). An inscription found in 1942 at Neud6rfel gives information on the composition of the population in Roman times.17 It reads: Vindain(a) I Veicon- (is) I f(ilia) an(norum) XX h(ic) e(st) s(ita) I Belatomar(us) et J Cobua J Verciovi I f(ilii) v(ivi) I Cocate J Sura I p(osuerunt) sor(ori) I e(t) nep(ti). The family relations implied in this text are shown in the following table: VERCIOVUS ---?----- BELATOMARUS COBUA (daughter)= VEICO (Uncles of Vindaina) I I COCATE SURA VINDAINA (Sisters of Vindaina) The dedicant is Belatomarus. After the death of their parents, Cocate, Sura, and Vindaina lived with the household of their uncles Belato- marus and Cobua. The masculine name Cobua is shown to be Celtic by potter's stamps in Reims. The other names are Celtic, too; of these Vin- daina is new, cf. Vindania. Obertisterreich Discoveries in the legionary camp at Lauria- cum (Enns) continued during the war, due to the efforts of Dr. Schicker. The hospital, which in late antiquity was converted into a simple church, has been studied."s To the right of the via praetoria, under the foundations of the plunge bath, foundations of an earlier structure were found, which had been removed by the Romans; other building remains were found else- where, going back before the Roman period. Of the city of Lauriacum, traces were found west of Enns in the court of the peasant Mayr, with a mosaic floor of black and white tiles. More im- portant, though not yet ready for extended notice, was a new fragment of a law of the city on a bronze plate, dealing with elections to a corporation. Likewise available for mention only is a dedication to a new native deity, found not far away. Both are being prepared for publica- tion. A substantial hoard of denarii and An- toniniani, belonging mainly to Gallianus and Claudius Gothicus, was only the most important among the many coin finds. In the Filialkirche at Schalchen was un- covered a Roman epitaph dating about A.D. 100. ..... nus sibi et Plotiae Coni(ugi) benigne Genetivo fil(io) vivo et Augustiano gen(ero). At Wels (ancient Ovilava), remains of a bath were found under Maidchenrealgymnasium, an elaborate structure, to judge by the painted wall decoration, and the remains of mosaic pavement, and the pottery from the best Imperial times. A glazed plate bore on the back a name in Greek characters. Outside of the walls was found a Roman epitaph, which reads as follows: Ul(pia) Pacata viva f(ecit) sibi et Jul(io) Sucesso con(jugi) o(bito) an(norum) LV et Ulpiis Optato f(ilio) 14a Cf. A.

A hitherto puzzling curse-text from Wilhering (Linz an der Donau) was deciphered by Dr. Alexander Gaheis shortly before his death. Written in a difficult cursive, the document had previously been thought to be in Runes. It is now read, "Domino fartori Victorino salutem. Mox litteras meas perceperis, ut statuim(us). Demes litteras meas felicissime et i(n?) pos(t?) cum Livia peribis." Salzburg A remarkable find made during the construc- tion of a new bridge over the Salzach, in a caison four meters below the surface, was that of a great marble block, 0.90 X 0.95 X 0.40 m., with a square depression cut in one side, in which stood a bronze steer 0.18 m. long and 0.192 m. high. It is thought to be the foundation stone of the Roman bridge, with the statue representing an offering to the river god. In the construction of a school at Irrsdorf was discovered, at a depth of 1.20 m., the lead cover of a Roman sarcophagus, and with it, good glass from Cologne and from Italy, an "Armbrust- fibel" with knobs of tinned white bronze with filigree work in silver, of the type Almgren 191, a gold finger ring, and other jewelry, also two iron knives. The grave, with a neighboring one of less distinction, belongs to the second half of the fourth century.20 In the Oberschwarzmayergut in Urreiting (Bischofshofen), a Roman key and part of a wall, turned up in plowing, proved to belong to the cellar of a Roman villa of some size, but the excavation could not be carried far. D. PERIOD OF THE MIGRATIONS Finds of this period divide themselves into Germanic, Avaric (the Riding People from the East), and early German (friihdeutsch), and they are not numerous nor important except for the Germanic period. A few sherds of Germanic times were found at Carnuntum. Some inhumation burials of the fifth century were found at Grafen- worth, in the An-den-Seen, some of them in stone caskets. A Gothic tomb with gold and silver articles was discovered in Marchegg. Burials of the Bajuwares of the "Reihengraiberfelder" type occurred in Anif (Salzburg), as also in Htirsching (Linz) and Marchtrenk (Wels).21 Allemanic influence is apparent in a cemetery of the fifth-seventh centuries in Bludenz. The Carolingian reaction to the Avars is ex- pressed in the so-called Ktinigsho5fe and Pfalzen. In addition to the one in Karnburg, for which see above, another building of this type has been recognized in Loosdorf (Melk). To this same western influence is due the cemetery in Pitten (Neunkirchen) and that in Zistersdorf (Giinserb- dorf), where K. Krenn has discovered not only weapons and equipment, but also bits of textiles and wood of the caskets. Of the Rider People, the remains center on the plain and about Vienna. Beyond Liesing (see above), graves have been found in Zwtslfaxing (Wien) wherein occurred strap-buckles decorated with palmettes, showing a connection with Hun- gary. Poor are the graves of Perchtoldsdorf, richer those of Mtiinchendorf and Guntramsdorf (Miidling), and of Traiskirchen.21a The Avars left graves also in Mistelbach in Lower Austria. E. RECENT EXCAVATIONS In the course of a six-weeks campaign in 1947, H. Vetters directed an excavation of the Austrian Archaeological Institute around the altar of the Genius Cucullatus in Wabelsdorf (Klagenfurt).22 In a polygonal court were found six rectangular temples of native construction, with wooden frames and walls of dry stone masonry. Each con- sisted of a single room. The water supply was secured through a well outside the enclosure, with the roof supported on six pillars, and a sacred well and cistern within the enclosure. The sanctuary continued in use from the first to the fourth centuries, when as a consequence of con- version to Christianity, presumably, the temple treasures were buried in a pit. A second excavation of the Institute was di- rected by H. Thaller in Mautern (Krems), where was found a sacred building oriented east and 1' Artur Betz, ibid., xxxiii (1941), pp. 71-74. 20 Cf. M.

On the altar in front of the niche in the long axis of the cella stood a little vase, covered with a lead tablet, in- scribed in a very cursive Roman hand. According to R. Egger, this contained a magical curse. In the late autumn of 1947, the Institute in- vestigated the rock inscriptions of Koth near Rupprechtshofen (Melk), under the direction of H. Vetters. Rock-cut tombs contained urn burials of a people, who revealed themselves as Illyrian and Celtic by their names, Atvortes, Aio, Plaus, Cocina, etc. Such tombs have been hitherto unknown in the Alpine region. In one instance, a kind of catacomb had been con- structed. The investigation is continuing. Under the direction of G. Mossler, in Liesing (Vienna, XXV), a number of interesting graves of the Rider People were found (pls. xIx-xx), rich with weapons and decorative materials, swords, scimitars, bows and arrows, golden earrings, ornaments of gold and silver, bronze belt decora- tions. With the horse skeletons were found bridles, stirrups, and strap ornaments. In graves of women and children were found glass beads, egg shells, bronze bells, etc. A little decorated clay cup stood in all graves at the feet of the dead, a container for funeral offerings. The cemetery may be dated to the sixth and seventh centuries. At Gtiffis (Feldkirch) in the Vorarlberg, A. Hild discovered on the so-called Heidenburg an early Christian church, simple and rectangular, belonging to the fifth-sixth century. The orienta- tion is to the east, dimensions 4.00 X 7.00 m. A masonry mensa, 1.10 X0.95 m., was found in the substructure wall on the east. The pavement is partly preserved. The altar lay, not on the cen- tral axis, but a little to the north, as at Grepauld (Graublinden, Switzerland). Apparently the church was designed to meet the needs of persons taking refuge on the Heidenburg in times of trouble. F. BIBLIOGRAPHY Volumes xxxi-xxxvi of the JOAI have ap- peared. Volume xiii, ed. 1942, of the Sonderschriften contains a study and a catalogue, by A. Schoir- gendorfer, of the difficult Roman provincial pottery. Volume xiv, ed. 1943, of the Sonderschriften contains a description of the excavations at Ktittlach, by R. Pittioni. Of the monumental Forschungen in Ephesos, volume v, ed. 1944, contains reports of the Celsus Library and the Heroon, the former of which can be dated, through J. Keil's reading of an inscrip- tion, to the year A.D. 125. About A.D. 400, the building was converted into a fountain. Volume iv, 3, in print, is a publication of the Church of St. John. The third volume of the Forschungen in Salona, edited 1939 by R. Egger and E. Dyggve, de- scribes the old Christian cemetery of Marusinac. The former derives the mausoleum construction from the usual Roman tomb types, but the tomb arrangements from Mesopotamia, and contrib- utes studies of the epigraphical material. An Institute monograph by M. Theuer, ed. 1944, is devoted to the altar of the Artemisium in Magnesia on the Maeander. In 1946, the Institute published the study of L. Feilers on the Villa of the Mysteries at Pom- peii, entitled Mysterion. The author considers in particular the influence of the Gnosis, and the origin of the cross symbol. In the present year, C. Praschniker has pub- lished from the records of the late E. Nowotnys, in a large and handsome volume, the Biiderbezirk von Virunum. Volumes ix and x of the Schriften der Balkan- kommission have been published by the Institute, 1939, the former of E. Groag dealing with the Imperial officials of Achaia down to Diocletian, the latter by E. Swoboda concerned with the system of the upper Moesian Limes in Serbia. He has determined that the construction of the Roman road through the Iron Gate was due to Tiberius, not to Trajan.

THE MUSEUMS In Vienna, the Kunsthistorische Museum suffered severe bomb damage, but is being re- built. The contents were saved. The Museum Vindobonense was completely destroyed. In Kairnten, the Klagenfurt Museum suffered serious bomb damage, and the central part is almost entirely destroyed, but reconstruction has been undertaken, and there has been little dam- age among the exhibits. In Villach, the Museum and its contents were destroyed, with the valu- able prehistoric (Fro$gg) collection. The rich Museum in Salzburg, with collections important for antiquity and the Middle Ages, was leveled with the ground. The Schlossmuseum of Petronell and the depot of the Excavation 1938-1940 were plundered, and little remains ex- cept the Lapidarium. It had contained the finds from the city of Carnuntum. SPAIN AND PORTUGAL By Antonio Garcia y Bellido* It is a difficult task to compress into a few pages seven years of archaeological activity on the Iberian peninsula. These years for the most part saw much of the world at war, but for Spain these seven years have been peaceful ones. Fortu- nately Professor Walter W. S. Cook of the Insti- tute of Fine Arts, New York University, recently gave a resume1 of the archaeological activities of Spain, particularly of the Middle Ages. This to- gether with the fact that the American Journal of Archaeology devotes its attention principally to classical antiquity has permitted me to spend less time on the mediaeval period, highlighting only the most outstanding monuments of that time. Consequently I have devoted more space to those periods antedating Christian times. There- fore the reader will herein find more information about Greek, Punic, Iberian, Celtic, Roman, and Visigothic cultures, almost all of which fell en- tirely within ancient times, than about the mediaeval culture. Due to spatial considerations all reference to museum activities (of great im- portance because of the reorganization of old and the creation of new ones) has been omitted; also reference to books or monographs dedicated to monuments already known and pertaining to our periods has been strictly limited. This therefore is simply a chronicle of the archaeological dis- coveries during the seven years 1940-1947. This report will lack information about the unpub- lished current finds, the study of which will be included in future chronicles, as their results are known. That explains why some finds made previous to 1940 are included in this chronicle; although only such of those are included as were considered to be of outstanding importance. A bibliography is supplied for all of the monuments discussed, and illustrations of the most impor- tant ones; a map (fig. 4) shows the sites.

For in Parpall6 appeared a great quantity of slabs of slate showing palaeolithic engravings and paint- ings. These slabs number about six thousand and have on them figures of animals which date from the Aurignacian period onward, and fortunately they were found in clearly distinguished strata. In the site called "El Cuetu," near Llanes (Asturias) were discovered new galleries in an already known cave. Here there were found Quaternary paintings with bisons, male and fe- male deer, horses, goats, the head of a horse, etc., in all forty-four figures. The excavations within showed stone and bone materials with engraved deer, fish, a bird with a large beak, a horse's head.3 In the province of Guadalajara, on the site called "Cueva de los Casares," near Riba de Saelices, was discovered a very important series of figures related to the Upper Aurignacian pe- riod. Its very fine representations include horses, bulls, stags, a fleecy rhinoceros, etc., reaching at times the highest level of quaternary art. An- thropomorphic figures, famous for their magical character, are also present in these paintings.* In Portugal many palaeolithic deposits have been found, e.g. those of Sezimbra, Nazar6, those of the region of Caldas da Rainha and Foz do Arelho (more than a hundred of these discovered by Professor M. Heleno, of Lisbon) those of Alpiarga, Algarve, etc. These have been or will be published by their discoverers in monographic form.5 NEOLITHIC AND BRONZE AGE To the north of the Province of Granada, in the site called Montefrio, there has been explored an extensive dolmen zone containing small sepulchres of very different ground plan. Some of these were undisturbed, and contained human remains in the retracted or extended position. In spite of their differences the general type consists of a trapezoidal room preceded by a short dromos. The furnishings consist of knives, arroWv- heads, blades, all of flint; axes of diorite; daggers; spades and arrowheads of copper, mixed with arsenic and antimony (no tin); ceramics adorned with motives of the southeast neolithic type; jewelry in the form of bracelets, rings of shell, necklace beads, etc.6 Of the "argirica" necropolis of Alcaide, near Antequera (Malaga) only ad- vance notices have been given. Here caves were excavated in the rock containing an entrance corridor and a circular burial chamber (a type similar to the famous one of Romeral and akin to those described). It is interesting in its close re- lationship with those of Sicily and Portugal and its remote but clear dependence on those of the valley of the Egeo.7 In the southern part of the peninsula, on the Atlantic coast, much research has been carried on by the excavators. Attention, above all, should be called to the Portuguese dis- coveries in Alapraia and Vila Nova de S. Pedro. The material here pertains to chalcolithic stations of the highest importance. The finds are of every sort and show close relations between the Mediterranean East and Western Europe. In Alapraia, near Cascais (west of Lisbon) were dis- covered three more caves, which must be added to those first found in 1889. These three new caves have given up wonderful ceramic material of the bell-shaped type; beads; stone votive sandals; plaques of slate in the form of idols, etc.,8 now in the Museo del Conde de Guimaraes in Cascais. Concerning the discoveries of Vila Nova de S. Pedro, a site located near Sanatarem, we have to limit ourselves to a r sum6 of the campaigns from 1939 to 1942.

A part of the walled precinct has been uncovered, some underground granaries; mineral deposits; dwellings of rectangular ground plan; remains of carbonized grain; a small clay figure of a woman with tatooed face; a statuette of bone, strange in appearance in that it recalls Mesopo- tamian forms, perhaps by mere coincidence; bell- shaped pottery; stone material in abundance (arrow points, axes, mallets); bone instruments; beads; perforated shells; engraved plaques of slate; cylindrical idols; more varieties of axes, arrows, daggers, chisels; sheets of copper; etc.9 There are also finds from the artificial grotto of Ermegeira, near Torres Vedras,10 as well as those of PBrto do Concelho, near Mago (Beira Baixa).11 The cave burials of Montgri (Gerona) are related to those of La Clape (Narbonne). In them were found small necklace beads of black stone, evidently imported, identical with those of La Clape and also those lately found in Valls (Tarragona)12 as well as those known in eastern Spain. It would seem that this zone was con- nected with Southern France by a similar cul- tural physiognomy which can be dated to about the year 2000 B.c.13 The caves of Tivisa14 belong to the early chapters of the Bronze Age, after the first invasions of the "Campos de Urnos" (Urnenfelderkultur). Pottery of the "argArico" type has been found here. Finally there was found an extraordinary deposit of bronze axes in Samieira (near Pontevedra). The 175 axes were probably made for commercial purposes, they must have been packed in a box of wood or twigs seeing that they were found in the form of a prism, with the edges measuring one meter and the square base 0.50 meter. It is the largest find of this kind known in Spain.15 We must not terminate this section devoted to the prehistoric period without citing the explora- tions lately brought to a head in Africa. They were conducted by Spanish, Portuguese, and Moroccan investigators. During the past few years in Spanish West Africa various mixed ex- peditions formed by participating geologists, ethnologists, naturalists, anthropologists, and archaeologists, have worked together in survey- ing the interior of Morocco, the Spanish Sahara, and the territories of Ifni and Cabo Jubi. These efforts have discovered a great number of stone deposits, and engraved rocks and slates. The garrison officials in these territories, who guided the specialists in their investigations, played an important part in these finds. Of very great in- terest are the engravings showing figures both human and animal (elephants, antelopes, oxen, gazelles, rhinoceroses, giraffes, ostriches, cats, horses), anthropomorphic figures, geometric figures, etc. They date from comparatively recent times, in spite of the fact that most of the fauna mentioned above has disappeared, evidently sur- vivals of prehistoric communities and retarded far behind their contemporary Mediterranean culture. In some cases however a combat chariot and a palm tree show evidences of more recent date."1 To these may be added the palaeolithic finds in the northeast of Angola," and those in the region of Tarache (Spanish Morocco).18 ARCHAEOLOGY OF THE CANARY ISLANDS The conquest of the Canary Islands by the Spaniards in the fifteenth century and the rapid incorporation of these islands into Spanish his- tory together with the consequent flow of pen- insular immigration have clearly outlined the primitive culture of the pre-Spanish aboriginals. Information about this culture, formerly known through the books of the chroniclers and docu- ments of the archives, has grown by the applica- tion of modern archaeological methods. Its in- terest is more than merely local. Because of its proximity both to the African continent and to Western Europe it may contain evidences of the Mediterranean cultures which possibly arrived 9 A. do Pagos and E.

The primary problem set up by these dis- coveries is concerned with the origin, date, and relationship of these data. There are clear rela- tions with Sardinian buildings, Balearic, North African, and even Iberian. But evidence is lack- ing to prove whether or not these similarities can be chronologically supported. In any case it would be premature to extract conclusions from these parallels, since we do not as yet know the chronological space time of the pre-Spanish Canary Island culture and know very little about its relative chronology. For until now the archae- ological evidence has not been presented in defi- nite superimposed strata.'9 PUNIC COLONIZATION By reason of the new installation of the Archaeological Museum of Seville, work has been European invasions, etc.), was found a bronze jar, only recently published, although it was found before 1936. It is an oinochoe and now in the Museo del Instituto de Valencia de Don Juan, Madrid (fig. 8). It belongs to the Punic archaic series, and compares favorably with that of the Cafiada de Ruiz Sanchez and that of the Regolini Galassi Tomb.22 Of the recent explorations under- taken in Ibiza there are as yet no published notices, but I can report in advance that they are uncovering new hypogea with funerary mate- rial of a type already known. One of these struc- tures, very large, contained a number of unused sarcophagi. In Cadiz there are for the moment no new finds of importance.

It must have been the largest of the colonies. The excavations carried out regu- larly since 1908 set out to uncover all the area within the ancient inclosure, the visible parts of which date from the Hellenistic and Roman epochs. Now the excavators have begun to make deep test pits and trenches below the upper stratum, to uncover the remains of the purely Greek city lying beneath and to solve the many chronological problems still awaiting explana- tion. For the present the presence of a popular Ionian pottery is of interest; it is similar to that 19 Jimenez Sanchez, Atlantis, xvi, 1941, and espe- cially, Excavaciones arqueol6gicas en Gran Canaria (Madrid, 1946). 20 Bonsor, Early Engraved Ivories (New York, 1928). 21 Concepci6n Fernandez Chicarro, MMAP, vi, 1945; AEArq, lxviii, 1947. 22 It was published for the first time in my book Fenicios y Carthagineses en Occidente (Madrid, 1942), but at that time I did not know its provenance, which after investigation I found out to be the Estu- ary of the Huelva.</page><page sequence="48">246 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGY which has also turned up in the south of France.23 The most important of the Greek figured vases last found in Ampurias are represented in pl. xxi.24 With respect to the old colony of Mainake, according to the ancient texts "the most western of all in the Greek world," we continue in the same ignorance as before. The attempts of A. Schulten to locate it have proven unfruitful. He, supposing that it was in Torre del Mar, a locality near V6lez-M'laga, made several trial digs there, particularly in the Cerro del Pefi6n, but the finds were limited to prehistoric, Iberian, and Roman potsherds, and there was nothing of the Greeks CM FIG. 8. BRONZE OINOCHOE RECOVERED FROM THE ESTUARY OF HUELVA, MUSEO DEL INSTITUTO DE VALENCIA DE DON JUAN, MADRID. there.21 Concerning Hemeroskopeion the same thing can be said. The traditional belief was that it had been Denia (ancient Dianium) and there is where Strabo (III, 4, 6.) among others placed it,26 but traces of such a site have not as yet been found in that height. The hypothesis of R. Carpenter27 placing it in Pefi6n de Ifach, slightly farther south, has had no substantiation either, up to this time. Much more interest is attached, in the mean- while, to the other Greek evidence including both chance and excavated finds. In fact, besides the continual and extensive ceramic remains, espe- cially Hellenistic (pottery with figures, sherds of the so-called "Etrusco-Campanian" style), which appear in abundance in all of the Iberian towns of the Mediterranean coast, we have some Greek figurines both in bronze and in clay, and other objects coming not only from the Balearic Islands, but also from the east and the interior of the peninsula. One of these bronze figurines is more interesting than all the ones found hitherto on the Balearics. It comes from Lluchmayor and is owned by a collector of Barcelona, having been found by a worker on the island. It is of pure bronze, 12 cm. high, its feet and hands badly preserved, crudely made (pl. xxII, B), showing a very pronounced archaic style for the beginning of the sixth century. The figurine carries a quiver; its waist is encircled by a broad strap; its hands must have held a bow and perhaps an arrow. It is evidently a "toxotes" and may possibly repre- sent an image of Herakles. Its date proclaims it up to now the most ancient Greek figurine found on the Balearics, a place fertile in such figures.28 There are some other very interesting figurines in a private collection of Palma de Mallorca. One of these (p]. xxII, A) is a woman stylistically re- lated to a South Italic prototype, known from various examples (two in the British Museum, from Locri; one in the Louvre, from Ancerenza; one in clay found in the Sanctuary of the "Malo- phoros," Selinos).29 All of these come from south Italy and date between fifth and fourth centuries B.C. The Lluchmayor figurine measures 18 cm., twice the size of the figures from Locri. Another bronze in this same collection (pl. xxII, c) repre- sents a dancing Satyr and measures 19 cm. It was found with the former figure in the vicinity of Lluchmayor. It may have been a part of the handle of a situla cover, similar to the type cur- rent in Etruria and Central Italy. The figure in its time was ithyphallic, although it may not seem so now because of the mutilated state in which it has come down to us.30 In another private collec- tion, in Lluchmayor, there is a large bronze head, which must measure nearly half a meter in height. It was found in the ruins of a megalithic low tower near Lluchmayor. From the shape of its 23 Jacobsthal and Neuffer, Pr histoire, ii, pt. i, 1933. 24 M.

Very late "Etrusco-Campanian" ceramics, simi- lar to those of Ibiza, and vases of clay, indige- nous and of crude manufacture, proclaim a com- paratively late date. It appeared, then, in a re- cent Hellenistic environment, and from what you can get from its appearance, roughly but in- timately related to the figures from "Son Favar," (pl. xxIII, B, c). It measures 23 cm. and wears a helmet in the shape of a "pilos," with a thick border, perhaps of Italic ancestry.32 Perhaps the most surprising collection of this type may be that group of figurines found in the site called "Son Favar," situated in the vicinity of Capdepera, in the northeast corner of Mallorca. Here a workman by chance stumbled on a figurine of bronze, representing a warrior with his lance and shield missing (pl. xxIII, A), in an attitude resembling that of the previous figure ("Son Carrio"). The helmet he wears, in the shape of a "pilos" has on one of its sides an appendage, and also the remnants of two horn- like ornaments, similar to those seen on a certain species of Italian helmet (e.g. the one from Canosa, in the Museum of Karlsruhe; one in Ruvo; another in Naples; those in the Ancona Museum; one from Magna Graecia, in the British Museum, etc.). The figurine we are con- sidering must have been placed on a pedestal, to judge from the dowels which drop from the soles of the feet. It measures over all 29.5 cm. and is now in the Arth Museum. The discovery of this statue stimulated the interest of the archaeolo- gist, Sr. Amor6s, who undertook some methodical excavating on the same site. This resulted in the uncovering of an indigenous construction with a circular plan (a megalithic low tower) and beside it a kind of sanctuary where came to light three more bronze figurines, like the first, undraped warriors in the act of attacking. Their size and manufacture are, however, quite distinct. The most important, because of its craftsmanship and dimensions (pl. xxIII, c), measures a half a meter over all; the lance is lost but the shield is still preserved, and it is oblong in shape. The modelling of its body, although shapeless and crude, betrays classical ideas. The most dis- tinguishing feature of this curious figure is the helmet. It has a large neck covering, a high vizor, and two chin straps which, as the wings of a bird, lift themselves to both sides of the temples. The high and graceful crest is even more interesting, erected as it is over the vertical stem which rises from the summit of the helmet in the shape of a Phrygian cap. Pegs from the soles of the feet served to fasten the figure to a pedestal, which fortunately was found intact and measures 12.5 cm. In spite of the exceptional dimensions of this bronze statue it was found entire, and moreover it is in one piece. The two companion figures have much less artistic and technical interest. One of these (pl. XXIII, B), 22 cm. high (without including the dowel on one of the feet), wears a helmet which when complete must have been like that on the previous figure. This figure is wearing a beard and mustache, a rare occurrence on this type of representation; it also wears high footwear. Still cruder is the third figure, 20 cm. in height, with pegs on both feet put there for the purpose of attaching it to a pedestal, which is lost. The helmet on this figure is of the type similar to that on the larger figure (pl. xxIIi, c). These bronze statuettes appeared together with late Greek ceramic material, as that of Ibiza, indigenous, and also with some unspecified bronze vessels, fibulae with eagles, some unguent boxes made of polychrome glass paste. The date that can be derived from this group seems to be about third and second centuries B.c. The bronzes seem to derive more or less from the Italic type of Mars, when the characteristic shape of the helmets were based on South Italian Hellenistic models of about fourth-third century B.C. Perhaps these figures (as all or almost all of the Greek bronzes found in the Balearic Islands) may be explained by the numerous Balearic 31 L. R. Amor6s and A. Garcia y Bellido, AEArq, xvi, 1947. 32 L. R. Amor6s, BSAL, Ix, 1944. A. Garcia y Bel- lido, AEArq, lxi, 1945.

It also testifies to South Italian connec- tions in the fourth century B.c. The beautiful bronze, representing a dancing negro, found in Arcos de la Frontera, near Cadiz, and now in the Cadiz Archaeological Museum, is a product of the Hellenistic period.38 Among the Greek clay figures should be noted some unpublished finds lately made in Ibiza, and also the beautiful Eros (pl. xxIv, A) from the Province of Cadiz, and now in the Museum of Cadiz. Curiously it repeats a Hellenistic type of Cyrenaica (Antike Terrakotten, ii, p. 330, fig. 3). It measures 11.5 cm. and retains some of its original colors. In the same Museum and from the same place, are kept two small heads of Hellenistic terracottas, and the fragment of another seated figure.3 Passing from the bronzes and terracottas to the jewels we must cite first of all the silver patera of Tivisa (near Tarragona) found with other indigenous jewels (earrings and pendents) and paterae about which we shall speak later (pl. xxv). It measures 15.7 cm. in diameter and all around in repouss6 there is depicted a scene showing three quadrigae driven by two persons. Its scheme repeats formulae that go back to the fifth century, but its craftsmanship is poor and it would seem to have been a provincial work, evidently late, but made from good models. Its most important parallels are those from the south of France (British Museum), two specimens quite similar to the one from Tivisa; the techni- cally finer silver phialai in the Metropolitan Museum, New York;38 the one from Baschova- Mogila;39 and the ceramic paterae of the style called "Calian" datable in the Hellenistic epoch. Considering the coins, jewels, and other objects turned up in this find, as well as the style which the Tivisa phiale shows, it must be a provincial product (perhaps from Massalia) and dates about third century B.C.40 Mallorca, which continues to yield many Greek figurines, has also furnished some beautiful ex- amples of Greek jewelry, gold pendents, for the most part, and of a type current in the rest of the Mediterranean area from the fourth century B.C. through the Hellenistic era. The most beauti- ful piece is the winged Nike of La Alcudia (now in the Museo Arqueol6gico de Barcelona) with some of the pendents previously cited; the rest of these are preserved in the Instituto del Conde de Valencia de Don Juan, Madrid). The Nike measures 5.5 cm.; is made of gold, hollow, and with soldered wings. It may have belonged to a necklace.4' To the imported Greek coins found on the peninsula (among which have appeared examples of nearly all the important Mediterranean mints: Massalia; Cumae; Phistelia; Hyele; Thurioi; Messene; Metapontum; Tarentum; Selinus; Leontini; Syracuse; Apollonia of Illyria; Aetolia; Camiros; Cyrene; Alexandria in Egypt; archaic coins without inscriptions and of the "Auriol" type, etc.)2 have now been added examples from Chios, Cibyra Maior (Phrygia) and Panticapaeum (Tauric Chersonesos).

Excavations in search of Tartessos, which Schulten supposed (without proof) in the Coto de Donfana, have been con- Ages. Among them the Greek (fourth century B.C. ceramics), Roman, and Arabic, have been outstanding." The excavations of Cabecico del Tesoro, in Verdolay, near Murcia, have a greater interest. Here, over a period of years, has been uncovered an interesting indigenous necropolis, containing an abundance of Iberian ceramic material of a very fine type (fig. 13), Greek ceramics imported from the fourth to the second centuries, perfume censers of the "Tanit" type, 43 Besides my chronicle from AA cited above, see F.

In addition there are sculptured remains of the greatest interest, floridly ornamented weapons (many scythes) and a Celtic bronze hel- met. The seated figure shown in pl. xxIv, B is from this site; it is perhaps a funerary object. It is interesting to isolate the characteristics which parallel those of the seated figures of Asia Minor (Miletus, Samos, etc.), similarities which con- tinue in significant detail, and which seem to imitate the style current among the "epheboi" about the beginning of the fifth century. However this may be merely coincidental, or an archaizing style which in reality was much more modern, since in the necropolis of Verdolay there has not yet appeared anything with so remote adate. Con- cerning the finds of Liria we shall have something to say when we discuss Iberian ceramics.45 In Albacete two interesting necropoleis have been excavated; the one of Hoya de Santa Ana, near Tobarra, contained things similar to those of Verdolay, much poorer in quality and partly more recent. The most interesting objects are a bronze Celtic helmet, a ceramic vase with ani- mals in relief, in the manner of Etruscan "Black Bucchero," another vase showing fishes, beauti- fully painted. There is also some Greek pottery of the fourth-third century B.C.48 Liria (near Valencia) which years ago yielded very curious examples of Iberian pottery, show- ing scenes done in the manner of Greek vase painting (the similarity is only formal, since the Iberians produced these in the Roman period) has yielded a new series no less valuable, of which only the most important will be mentioned here. One of these (fig. 9) reveals the scene of a ritual dance, in which soldiers and women dance hand in hand, preceded by musicians with large trumpets.47 It is a scene very similar to another one on a vase dug up in previous excavations on the same site. No less curious is the representa- tion of a warrior and his horse, with a fine frieze of birds in the lower part; the warrior wears a helmet with a crest and raises a javelin on high; the horse seems to be frightened by a wolf (near- by, on the right hand side) (fig. 10). More curious even is the scene depicted in fig. 11, showing in black figures, from left to right, a mare suckling its young, the taming of a colt, some hunting dogs, a weasel, a species of bull-baiting, and a struggle between two warriors who hold concave shields, swords, and javelins. The bull baiting scene is the first known graphic representation of this fiesta so genuinely Spanish, only here it seems that the bull is attracted by a kind of fis~T - \- L~C~- r r~ ii FIG. 13.

Filling the empty spaces are some flying birds, and triangular figures which probably represent huts or cabins. The scene of the struggle is not merely pantomime as in other cases, but an actual com- bat (cf. fig. 12), so real that because of its as- sociation with the fiesta of the bull it is natural to ask whether it might not be a spectacle similar to that of the gladiatorial games. The texts tell us that at the funeral of Viriathus unusual combats were held about his tomb.48 The most beautiful of the vases recently discovered in Liria is no doubt the one which contains the scene repro- duced in fig. 12. It shows a "baroque" composi- tion, an exuberance which recalls the spirit of the "retablos" and facades of eighteenth-century Spain. Amidst a real tropical forest of ornamenta- 4G. Nieto, BSAA Univ.

The technique of these paintings is of poor quality, monochrome, but the paintings in recompense are extremely expressive; they constitute up to now the most eloquent graphic documentation for the customs and dress of these primitive Spaniards of about of painted ceramics, containing scenes. Besides the very valuable group from Azaila, now well known,"0 there is also more recently the fragment (pl. xxIv, c) from Alloza (Teruel), representing three hunters, one of whom leads a chained animal."1 In the Southeast, in Verdolay, near Murcia, was found the "Vase of the Goats," showing great naturalistic and descriptive under- standing52 (fig. 13). The two pieces reproduced in figs. 14-15 came from Elche (near Alicante); the first is a fragment showing a feminine, winged, figure, which recalls the busts of "Tanit" found in Cova d6s Cuyrams, in Ibiza; the second is part of a large vessel on which this small male head (with braided hair and goatee) appeared.53 Iberian metal work has been enriched lately by a series of important discoveries. Two of these are outstanding, that of Tivisa, and that of Santiago de la Espada. Tivisa (to the West of Tarragona 41 For the last finds from Liria, see I.

The other phiale is un- adorned except for the boss which has in strong repouss6, the head of a wolf from the front and done in a style very similar to that which we shall see in the following phiale.

The valuable find was not known to scholars until its owner, in 1940, deposited it in the Museo Arqueol6gico de Barcelona, where it is now. It consists of four silver phialai; some bracelets without orna- mentation, others made of fringed threads of silver; ten silver vases, well preserved, and frag- ments of others. One of the Greek phialai has an engraved circular decoration composed of rolls of stalks of acanthus, very stylized but of classic the manner of an emblem with the frontal head of a wolf in high relief. Around the boss runs a string of pearls (the classical motive simplified) and a broad circular band in which are engraved some very curious scenes of a religious character. The figures are covered with thin plates of gold, so that they show a certain delicate coloring. A superficial description of these scenes is as fol- lows: an offering before an enthroned divinity; a centaur; a rider with shield and lance; a lion devouring a bull; a winged genius sacrificing a lamb and assisted by two other winged genii, one carrying a candelabrum on which an eagle perches, and the other with two boughs, one of 54 Bosch-Gimpera, Anuari, 1913-14; Gomez- Moreno, Homen. a Melida, ii. 1934.</page><page sequence="56">254 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGY which he holds in the left hand, the other of which sprouts in a strange manner from the base in his right hand; a muffled figure; and finally, filling the void, but without doubt in intimate connection with the scenes, wild boars and mountain cats (?). The technique is infantile and dull, but graphically descriptive. However, the religious sentiment or ritual is undeniable. Per- haps it intermingles unknown indigenous re- ligious concepts with ideas imported from the classical world. Such may be inferred at least from certain of the subjects such as the centaur, the combat of the lion and bull (ultimately of oriental origin) and the winged figures which seem to contain plastic reminiscences coming from the classical world, with an inclination toward the Etruscan. It is interesting to em- phasize in any case, no matter what its inner significance or formal background may be, that the ritual scene here represented formed part of the Iberian religious inheritance, even though on the reverse this phiale carries a long inscrip- tion with the name of a person, which has not been deciphered. Some of the silver vases are unadorned, others are decorated in repousse, all of them have the shape commonly found among the Iberian clay vases. One of the most beautiful because of its decoration has on its base an Iberian inscription, legible but not deciphered. The date of these liturgical paterae must be about the third or second century B.C.s5 The treasure found in Santiago de la Espada (Province of Jaen, near the boundary of Murcia) is in its own way as important as that of Tivisa. This treasure, in the collection of the Instituto de Valencia de Don Juan, Madrid, and not known until 1943, consists of a silver vase similar to the most simple one of Tivisa; fragments of two others; a silver bowl, with engraved rosettes like that of Tivisa, and an Iberian inscription; various bracelets; necklaces; pendants; rings and brooches of silver and gold; and finally, two magnificent gold ear rings which we shall now discuss briefly. They measure in height about 10 cm. and consist of two main pieces, one a kind of disc more than semi-circular in shape, and the other piece a complete bust of a figurine. The more than semi-circular disc is a magnificent work of a local goldsmith, the outstanding parts of which are foliated spirals, interweavings, rosettes, and half spheres, all united by a very fine granulation. The figurine busts are linked to the ends of these disks and appear somewhat as feminine genii, with long braids and two pairs of wings (lacking in the example here reproduced, (pl. xxvi); in their hands they hold a vase and a bird. It is interesting to observe that they wear a full skirt from the waist but that the torso is uncovered revealing the breasts. No doubt the figures are symbolical relating to a mythology about which we are ignorant but perhaps which is closely related with the scenes on the dish of Tivisa. The craftsmanship of these gold figurines is extremely barbarous and crude. In general one may suspect Punic influence in the ornamental work of the large plaque. The large pendants would perhaps have to be worn in the manner in which the Lady of Elche wears her enormous earrings. These finds date from about the third century B.C."6 CELTIC CULTURE We shall not enter here into the complicated and difficult problems of the so-called "Urnen- felder Kultur" or into the appearance on the Iberian Peninsula of that stage later known in central Europe by the term "Kerbschnittkera- mik." It is sufficient to know that Spain has abundant and well-studied remains of both phenomena. We shall limit ourselves to only two or three of the most important stations of these cultural stages. As clear and evident reflections of the central European phases mentioned let us cite the necropoleis of Molh, Agullana and "El Redal," known recently after the excavations of the last years. The necropolis of Molk (near Falset, Province of Tarragona) was published in 1943 by its ex- cavator in a model study.57 It is principally a large cremation necropolis of the type known as "Urnenfelder" (Cemeteries or Fields of Urns) closely related to other similar necropoleis on the Catalan coast. It seems to be of the Hallstatt Period C, which can be approximately dated in 56 The group has been published by Serra-Rafols, Amp, iii, 1941. For the patera (fig. 16) cf.

From here came much characteristic ceramic evidence, many decorated objects of bronze showing an intimate relation with other similar bronzes in Spain and the rest of Europe (Hungary, Bohemia, Switzerland, France, central and northern Italy). The necropolis of Agullana (near Figueras, Province of Gerona) in general shows similar relationships and dependence. We are, therefore, confronted with more proof of the penetration into Spain of central European racial and cultural ele- ments, and bearers of iron. It seems that they represent the first appearance in the northeast of Spain of those "Celts" or "proto-Celts" of Central Europe whose entrance into the penin- sula can be fixed around the year 900 B.C. or somewhat later. From the necropolis of "El Redal" (Province of Logrofie, on the banks of the Ebro) has come a very eloquent series of in- cised ceramics ("Kerkschnittkeramik") quite similar to that of other well known deposits (Roquizal del Rullo, Numancia, Las Cogotas, near Madrid, Portugal, Arag6n). The introduc- tion of this central European type of incised ceramic is now dated about 700-600 B.C. These cultures continued for a long time showing a very slow evolutionary process. The necropolis of Agullana has revealed up to the present nearly three hundred burials some of which are very much later than the initial stage.58 As is well known, a special culture was estab- lished in the northwest obrner of the Iberian Peninsula (North of Portugal, and Galicia) which is different from that of the rest of the peninsula by virtue of the circular shape of its dwellings. The people who lived in these were probably of Iberian stock, but the culture with which they appear before us, in the epoch im- mediately preceding the Roman, shows (except in the form of its dwellings) Celtic features, no doubt due to influences from the new invaders from central Europe who overflowed through these regions. The indigenous folk must have K .--.. u~?ZY FIG. 19.

The cultural pattern of the northwest of Spain has been known for a long time, and important colonies ("castros") of this culture have been discovered not only in Portu- gal but also in Galicia. All of these show circular or nearly circular huts. That of Santa Tecla, near Vigo, at the mouth of Miflo was excavated years ago, but its results, although known, were not conveniently published until recently.59 In the west of Asturias, near Coania, there was ex- cavated between 1940 and 1944 another impor- tant site which, to date, is perhaps the most ex- pressive and characteristic of this culture. The good preservation of its ruins where some of the houses still stand to a height of four meters allows us to recover not only their plan but also 5s In addition to the bibliography prior to 1940, principally the works of P. Bosch-Gimpera and M. Almagro, now must be added: M. Almagro, Amp., ii, 1940, where the finds of the so-called "incised" ceramics are catalogued; J. Maluquer de Motes, Amp, vii-viii, 1945-1946, where the problem of the Hall- statt cultures of N.E. Spain is studied; S. Vilaseca, cited above for the necropolis of Mold; P. del Palol and J. Maluquer, Amp, v, 1943; vi, 1944, in which Agullana is treated with special attention. For Celtic invasions in general see the studies of P. Bosch-Gimpera, Two Celtic Waves in Spain (London, 1939), and Laformaci6n de los pueblos de Espania (Mexico, 1945). The last two, which are rich in suggestions, have made use of archaeological as well as philological source material and attempt a classification of the known place-names of ethnic character. Nevertheless Bosch-Gimpera was not then able to study the finds of the last few years, which clarify so many problems. For "El Redal," see B.

In fig. 17 we present the plan and in fig. 18 the reconstruction. Unfor- tunately the acropolis was already demolished except for the circuit walls. However, there re- mained almost untouched an extensive group of dwellings which after the Pax Romana formed a kind of precinct outside the walls, surrounded merely by a mud enclosure. With this precinct was also preserved the entrance to the acropolis, consisting of a passage fortified by a tower and it has come down to us still preserving the con- siderable height of about seven meters. The houses were made of slate slabs and covered with a roof of straw and branches, held up by one or more vertical pillars. With regard to its date the findings indicate the period between the time of Caesar and the end of the Roman Empire (coins of Caesar, Tiberius, and Gallienus, terra sigillata, a Latin inscription, Roman amphorae, dolia, etc.). Explorations along the basin of the Navia have resulted in the discovery of other "castros"; that of Pendia is the most important. Here are houses like those of Coafia, but showing two chambers, probably mortuary. They are related to one in Coanfa, and to one of Briteiros (Portu- gal), found in 1930. A cult of rain or water wor- ship was intimately connected with these struc- tures. Their chief characteristics are a more than semicircular apse, and a covering by means of the corbel or "false arch" system. In Coafia the upper end of this type of structure (fig. 17, upper left corner) was reconstructed to serve as a dwelling place at a much later date; another of this type, from Pendia, is illustrated in fig. 19.10 It is interesting that the people responsible for Coanfa and Pendia were the Albiones, mentioned by Pliny (IV, 3), a fact well established by a stele found in the vicinity and on which their name appears.6' The excavations of Coafia have not been completed. Neither have the campaigns after 1944 added anything of importance nor will future excavations be likely to do so. Concerning the excavation carried on in the Portuguese "castro" of Bagunte nothing as yet has been published. The settlement is very interesting and belongs to an epoch which includes the last days of the Roman Empire. Perhaps we can report about its results in the next chronicle. The same can be said for the "castro" of Sanfins, also in the north of Portugal. In another Portuguese "castro," that of Lan- hoso, near Braga, less famous than those cited, was found a completely preserved bronze-like helmet of the Celtic type, with a chain attached, no doubt for carrying on the march. From this site have come various crude sculptures in stone; gold necklaces; clasps; arms; coins; pottery; etc., typical of this culture. In Verdolay and in Hoya de Santa Ana similar helmets were found.62 The region to the northwest of the peninsula has always been prolific in finds of gold, espe- cially necklaces and bracelets. The latest in im- portance (besides those of Lanhoso, Coania, etc.) are from Caldas de Reyes, Province of Ponte- vedra, where in 1940 a series of very interesting gold objects was accidentally discovered in a hiding place. The find is an important one; it contained three hemispherical earthen bowls (one with a short neck) adorned with geometric engravings, each provided with a handle; vari- ous anklets or bracelets, unadorned; earrings; a necklace; and rarest of all, a gold comb. Other pieces were lost before official intervention; the recovered pieces weigh 15 kilograms,63 and are now in the Museo de Pontevedra. In Drives, Province of Guadalajara, in a territory pre- dominantly Celtic, a treasure was found (this time consisting only of silver pieces) in which there were more than six hundred fragments of indigenous jewelry, weighing in all about 14 kilo- grams. The grouped collection seems to indicate that it was a silversmith's hoard (such as that of Santiago de la Espada) destined to be melted down for the manufacture of new jewels. There are many fragments of necklaces, anklets, 60 For Coafia see A. Garcia y Bellido, AEArq, xlii, 1941, and xlviii, 1942; J. Uria, Rev. Univ. Oviedo, 1941. For Pendia, see, A.

The more important objects are some brooches with doves, a head in high relief, etc. A cast with a Latin inscription is worthy of attention. The coins come from the mints of Emporion, Rhodes, Massilia, Carthago Nova, and Rome (Republican denarii), and date the treasure to about 80 B.C.64 THE ROMAN EPOCH For clarification this period will be divided into three parts, one part for each of the three prov- inces into which the Romans divided the Iberian Peninsula, Tarraconensis, Baetica, and Lusitania. In Tarraconensis lay the Roman city, Am- purias, raised on the side of the Iberian town and near the Greek city of Emporion. The entire stretch of its great southern wall has been dis- covered, and the lines of the other three sides have been almost completely determined. The wall was built of large stones, irregular and cushioned, but the joints are nicely fitted. The construction recalls good Etruscan practice. It was about five meters high, the lower half of stone work, the upper half of cement, poured in a mold, and filled with stone rubble. The wall has come down to us so complete that its upper con- structions, as well as the flat top of the wall and the parapet or breastworks, can be clearly recog- nized and studied. The wall to the south measures without interruption 400 meters in length. The complete circumference is now known in its gen- eral lines, and measures more than two kilo- meters. These walls seem to have been built either during the Sertorian War, or later in the first century B.C. when Caesar established the veterans here who formed the nucleus of the Roman colony. In the southwest corner there is an angular doorway, and in the middle of the south side another door, with an apotropaic phallus on one of the jambs. Inside the Roman city no systematic excavation has, as yet, been undertaken, but this will be the work of the next campaign, which promises great monumental and scientific results. In the meanwhile, a large palace has been uncovered in the northeast corner of the Roman city, with very beautiful mosaics, painted stuccoes, a female portrait of the Julio-Claudian epoch, a large garden with a peristyle and an enormous cryptoporticus, like those in Italy (Pompei, Tivoli). On the southern boundary of the wall has been uncovered what seems to have been a small amphitheatre and a palaestra. Curiously the former, although late in date, still used very primitive methods of con- struction, simple wooden platforms supported by small radial walls of ashlar coated with stucco and terminating on the outside with pilasters of well squared ashlar masonry. It is a type of amphitheatre quite different from the stepped series of stone found in the Imperial epoch, rather it recalls the primitive wooden structures of the Republican era. In Ampurias there has also been found a small clay head of Etruscan type, datable in the first century B.C.65 Farther to the south of Ampurias, in Gerona (ancient Gerunda), an ancient Roman precinct has been studied. It was in part built on top of a previous megalithic structure, similar to that of famous Tarragona. Nearly the entire Roman circuit, with the details of some of its parts, has been preserved."6 Thanks to the last investiga- tions and explorations of Barcelona, the entire periphery of the Roman precinct wall has been studied and knowledge about it is virtually complete. The average thickness is four meters. It consists of two parallel surfaces, the outer one of large ashlar blocks set up in horizontal courses, the inner of fairly regular ashlar masonry, and in between a rubble filling, mortar, and archi- tectural debris. In places the Roman rampart, still intact, rises to a height of ten meters, and has towers of rectangular plan, 6 by 8 meters. The general date seems to be fourth century, at which time reconstructions had to be made after the destructive entrance of the Franks in the middle of the third.67 In Tosa, south of the coast of Gerona, an im- ' San Valero, El tesoro preimperial de Drives (Madrid, 1945). 65 Study of the walls of Ampurias has not as yet been done.

It would seem that the villa suffered vari- ous reconstructions, the last of which, in the southwest corner, was a Visigothic temple with an apse. A marble figurine of Attis, in the classi- cal form of this oriental divinity, was found in- side the villa.71 Excavations have been started in the large area of the ruins of Sadaba, north of been revealed. The palace was perhaps begun in the time of Hadrian, and received various altera- tions down to the invasion of the Franks in the middle of the third century, or slightly later, when it must have been destroyed. The coins which were discovered there are an eloquent index of its chronology.72 In Alemanras de Adaja (Valladolid) a villa has been partially excavated, which dates in the third-second centuries (fig. 29). It has yielded more than four hundred square meters of geometric mosaics.73 Two Roman heads 46. FIG. 22. PLAN OF THE EXCAVATED PARTS OF THE "VILLA" AT ALEMANRAS DE ADAJA (VALLADOLID). Zaragoza. Baths and other constructions have been investigated, but much remains to be done. Excavations of the large palace at Clunia, the head of the Convento Juridico of that name, have far greater interest. In the ruins (near Corufia del Conde, south of the Province of Burgos), in addition to the remains of its theater and other things, the complete plan of a large urban palace has been uncovered (fig. 21) in which a considerable number of geometric mosaics, and a few showing plant forms, have have come from Villalba de los Alcores (Valla- dolid) and are now in the Museo Arqueol6gico de Valladolid. One of them, male, seems to date from the middle of the first century.74 Regarding the excavations in the Roman ruins of the city of Juliobriga, near Retortilla, Province of Santander, no satisfactory results have been an- nounced.

One of them,'7 now in the Museo Arqueol6gico de Madrid, is a monumental piece (pl. xxvIII, A) and perhaps was imported from a good Roman atelier. Another (an old find) from Jumilla, Province of Murcia, and now in a private collec- tion, has recently been conveniently studied."' It is another wonderful piece of Roman portraiture of the Antonine period. The third is a Roman- Iberian head found in Minateda, Province of Albacete, now in the Museo de Albacete, an example of local portrait sculpture, following Roman models of the early first century.77 From the same region there are two more Roman works, the "Sarcophagus of the Muses," a chance discovery in the Cathedral of Murcia in 1942; and the beautiful mosaic from Hellin, found in 1940. The former is reproduced in pl. xxvII, B. It is stylistically related to works of the third century. Below the nine muses appear the figures of Homer and Socrates (with certainty) and Plato, Hesiod, and Pythagoras (with less cer- tainty).78 The mosaic from Hellin is divided into various compartments, representing the months of the year and the seasons in an allegorical manner. In the circular compartments appear very beautiful and richly colored rural scenes. The mosaic is now in the Museo Arqueol6gico de Madrid. 7 In Baetica, the excavations of Italica have continued. That part of the "cardo" has been uncovered which leads to the gate of the city and the amphitheatre, and an area abutting the "decumanus" has been revealed. In another part of Italica a beautiful statue of Venus by chance came to light; it is now in the Museo Arqueol6gico de Sevilla.so Not far from Italica, in Dos Hermanos (a grange of Tixe) there was found some time ago a seated group of a woman and a soldier, of provincial craftsmanship. This has recently been given to the Museo de Sevilla by its owner the Marquesa de Esquivel and it will soon be published. In C6rdoba, underneath the remains of an Arab dwelling, eight meters deep, various funeral sculptures and three sarcophagi of lead have been discovered, (now in the Museo de C6r- doba). The burials were at the foot of the Roman wall, and on the road which leads to ancient Castulo (today, Cazlona), The sarcophagi are trapezoidal in shape and measure 1.80 meters in length; their cases, formed of sheets of soldered lead, are unadorned, but the lids have ornamen- tation, an acanthus leaf and daisy motive on one, and a row of running animals above a maeander on the other two (pl. xxvii, c). The ornamenta- tion is in relief and was stamped on by a mold. The sarcophagi are of the type "adorned with bands," frequent at the end of the Empire. A coin of Theodosius found near one of them reveals the date."8 In the environs of C6rdoba, in Espejo (ancient Ucubi, Claritas Julia), in addition to an extensive inscription on the pedestal of a statue dedicated to Septimius Severus, and the frag- ment of a figure wearing a cuirass (perhaps a part of the figure of the Emperor), a bearded head has been discovered. It wears a hemispherical cap and may represent a priest or devotee of one of those oriental religions which evidently were very important in Baetica. Marble slabs orna- mented with spiral leaves and small birds, the remains of a sumptuous dwelling, have also been found; they apparently belong to the second century.82 In Guijo, near Pozoblanco, an interesting re- lief was found some time ago, and has recently been presented to the Museo de C6rdoba by a private donor. Although the relief is somewhat worn, a seated veiled woman can be clearly seen, her feet on a footstool, a cornucopia in her left hand and a long wand in her right hand. No doubt she represents Demeter; at her side are three standing female figures, one of whom holds a long torch, probably her daughter Kore or Proserpina. On one of the edges of the slab can be seen a female figure who is running and dragging by one of her hands a small goat. The piece is of good quality, apparently of the second century. In the fine relief work can be detected light touches of the drill. The religious sentiment 75 A. Fernandez de Aviles, AEArq, lii, 1943. 76 A. FernAndez de Aviles, MMAP, ii, 1941. 77 J.

Here the remains of a fish-salting works has been discov- ered, an occupation very popular on these shores throughout antiquity;84 some bathing establish- ments; a villa with mosaics; a Roman necropolis; and a kiln for making tiles and pottery."5 The principal discoveries in the area of Lusitania remain to be discussed. In the capital, Merida (ancient Emerita Augusta, Province of Badajoz), prior to 1940 some very important things had been found, publication of which was prevented by the Civil War. In addition to the monumental veiled head of Augustus, a copy of the statue of the Via Labricana published in 1941,86 and other Roman portraits of local manu- facture have been found, interesting for their time (Julio-Claudian), and also some relief frag- ments from a large building, which turned up in the sewer of Pancaliente, near Merida. These fragments are of great importance, parts of eight large medallions, showing Gorgon heads and a head of Zeus Ammon, well done in the marble and placed within heavy wreaths. The style and iconography are similar to that which appear on the medallions which adorned the Temple of Augustus in Tarragona and compare with those which came to light not long ago in the excava- tions of the Forum of Augustus in Rome. No doubt the marble medallions of Merida and Tarragona must have been dependent upon the type made official in Rome during the Principate of Tiberius. Besides the medallions we must also mention some female figures dressed in long full robes; some capitals; and a series of relief fragments of very fine workmanship, with gar- lands, bucrania, and sacrificial scenes which closely recall Roman things of the Julio- Claudian epoch (pl. xxVIII, B). We add a funerary stele with two figures, a male and female, shown from the waist up, and with an inscription.'7 In Chparra, (the ancient Capara) Province of Caceres, some interesting excursions have been made in the extensive field of ruins of the now isolated Roman city. For a long time the four- sided arch there has been known, a type similar to the Janus Arch in Rome, and those in Tripoli and Tebessa. In the two modern campaigns the sur- rounding rampart has been discovered and fixed; K II FIG. 23. BATHS (?) OF TORRE DE CARDEIRA NEAR BEJA (PORTUGAL). it measures about 2.5 kilometers in length and has an average width of about 3.20 meters; it is constructed of well squared ashlar stones. The general lines of the two main streets have been discovered, as in the military encampments, crossing in the center. We now know that it was at the crossing of the two main thoroughfares that the quadriform arch was erected, which results in being somewhat of an imitation of the Hellenistic tetrapylon. The well-preserved re- mains of various buildings have been uncovered in the vicinity of the arch, a temple dedicated to Jupiter according to an inscription, and a nym- phaeum.

Geometric mosaics from an architectural com- plex, a head of Gallienus, and other things of lesser importance, have been unearthed in the excavations in the area of the Roman baths of Coimbra, from which it received its name). The excavations were resumed in 1939, after a long interval. A large palace was explored, outside the walls. In front of the palace is a monumental portico, followed by a semicircular hall, opening on an atrium, which gives access to a peristyle J ? .6. ii o 6' 10 Irr.. FIG. 25.

It had three aisles, and an attached circular baptistery in which there was a font reached by two descending steps. Other annexes of the structure are imperfectly identi- fied (fig. 24). The remains, to judge from the decorative fragments, are evidently those of an important building. There are column shafts and decorated column bases, lattice fragments and parts of the chancel screen, etc., in which geo- metric motives abound, principally secant circles, diamonds, squares, pointed ovals, spirals, etc., now isolated and now combined, and done in the characteristic beveled technique. The building was erected during the time of Recaredo, (587- 602), and clearly shows, in plan, elevation, and ornamentation, a style similar to other buildings of North Africa."9 The excavations undertaken in the vast field of ruins in Cerro de la Oliva, municipal boundary of Zorita de los Canes, Guadalajara, promise much more important results. These ruins may possibly be those of the city of Rec6polis, built by Leovigildo in memory of his son Recaredo. The texts say that it had notable walls and buildings. The ruins are of a walled Visigothic city, with the remains of large buildings, among which is a three-aisled basilica, completely ex- cavated (fig. 25). The city, where it could be measured, is 580 meters long and 380 meters wide. The deposit of coins found in the basilica is very important, as it contains coins of gold belonging to the Merovingian series, Swabian, Hispano-Visigothic, Justinian II, and the "primi- tiva leovigildiana" series. In addition to its numismatic interest it fixed the date of the basilica prior to A.D. 580-583. The basilica was afterwards burned, looted, and razed, as was the entire city, and never restored. The basilica seems to have gone through three periods, first an Early Christian church with a central nave and an apse to the East, from which have come various frag- ments of figured sarcophagi, pedestals, shafts of columns, Corinthian capitals, stylistically related to the fifth century. The second period saw the earlier church transformed into a basilica with a nave and two aisles, a "prothesis" and a "diako- nikon" organized in the form of a transept at the upper end of the side aisles, and a baptistery to the left of the atrium, all of which transforma- tions belong to the second half of the fifth century. In the third period the basilica was con- verted by the Visigoths into a church suited for Arian worship (ca. 578 A.D.). The last changes must have been due to Leovigildo, after he had conquered the Early Christian city.97 In Tarrasa (near Barcelona) new excavations are proceeding in an attempt to find the solutions to the many and difficult problems which involve the ancient buildings.98 Finally, in Yecla (near Santo Domingo de Silos, Burgos) some refuse heaps are being uncovered, in which Visigothic things are found: belt plaques, receptacles, the bridle of a horse, and objects of bronze and iron.99 It would be a pleasure to reproduce some photo- graphs and reports from the excavations of Durat6n (Segovia) where for some years now they have been extracting Visigothic funeral furniture from the ruins. It already has the reputation of being the greatest discovery on the 14 p. Quintero and C. Gimenez Bernal, Memorias de la Alta Comisaria de Espai~a en Marruecos 2, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 1941-1946.

HISPANO-ARABIC ART In the palaces of the caliphs of Medinat Al- Zahara, near C6rdoba, new excavations were undertaken in 1943 beyond the zones discovered lery over columns, nor a portico on the shorter sides was as yet used; these forms must have been later introduced by the Almohades.

Among the new finds appears a group of dwellings with a trapezoidal perimeter, which is thought to have been the residence of the prime minister. Another group of houses belonging perhaps to the guards throws new light on the problem of the Hispano-Moslem house. It would seem that neither the patio with a gal- dinarily rich in every type of constructive and ornamental element, make it possible to recon- struct the entire hall in plan and elevation, and this is now being done. The many capital bases, shafts, parts of the arches, pilasters, etc., allow us to form a clear idea of the rich interior decora- tion. The capitals are outstanding, of very pure Corinthian ancestry, but beautifully interpreted for Arabic taste. A very fine base of one of the columns, worked in marble, carries a dedication to 'Abd al-Rahman III, which places it in the 100 For 1926-36, see R. Castej6n, Excavaciones en Medina Azahara (Madrid, 1945).</page><page sequence="70">268 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGY years 953-4; other capitals can be dated 954-5 and 956-7. In the middle of the two side walls of the large hall there were doorways, with pilasters which can be dated 954-5. In addition many pieces of the socle and marble entablature have been found. The walls were covered with marble revetments decorated with some of the finest and most beautiful motives yet found in these ruins. From all this we may believe that the royal hall was perhaps the most splendid jewel of all palace structures in the West at this time, far superior to contemporary Christian buildings. It may have served as a reception hall for 'Abd al-Rah- man III.101 In the Alcazaba of Malaga excavations con- tinued during the Spanish civil war. An im- portant fortification was revealed, smaller than that of the Alhambra, but surpassing it in the extent of its defensive methods. It seems to have been a work of the eleventh century. On the inside, the so-called "Cuartos de Granada" was uncovered, and a great quantity of domestic pottery of unusual interest. The "Cuartos de Granada"was the fortress of the stronghold; three courtyards open up around it. Another unit was erected for small dwellings and baths. The "Cuartos de Granada," like those of the Alhambra, date from the thirteenth to the four- teenth centuries. The dwellings in the complex mentioned above hold our interest because of their proportions; they constitute a valuable series of examples of this type of Arabic architec- ture, the beginnings of which are poorly known, dating perhaps from the eleventh century. The openings were closed by double doors, and all in- closed a square patio. The pavement is of mortar dyed red, as are the socles in the dwellings, the courtyards, and even streets. Over the socle there are Cufic inscriptions in white against a reddish background.102 In Almeria some private dwellings similar to those of Malaga, but somewhat later (perhaps of the twelfth or thirteenth century) have been discovered,103 and in Mesas de Asta the remains of houses, earlier than those of Malaga, have been found.104 In all of these houses important specimens of pottery and domestic household furniture have appeared, including, from Mesas de Asta, both glazed and unglazed pottery, and some fine examples of the Medinat Al-Zahara type. Not long ago in C6rdoba, the beautiful figurine of a stag was found in the drain pipe of a house. It is somewhat mutilated, the horns, one ear, and part of the other missing (pl. xxIx, B). It is of bronze, hollow except for the feet. The gilding which covered it was decorated with an incised circular pattern. It is a work of the last part of the tenth century, later than a similar work which came from Medinat Al-Zahara, now in the Museo de C6rdoba, while the stag from C6rdoba is in the Museo de Arqueol6gica in Madrid.'5o The recent substantiation of Hispano-Arabic export to the Islamic East is an interesting aspect of the study of Spanish-Arabic culture. The testimony is poor but eloquent. It consists of pieces of vessels of the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries with a metalic glaze. It was a type, it would seem, much appreciated in the Moslem countries, which for some reason or other did not have products of this class. The jars were ex- ported to Egypt from Manises and Malaga, and also to Syria, Palestine, Turkey, and no doubt to other parts of the East."'6 In Castilian lands, but with Arabian workman- ship and inscriptions, some samples of rich gesso have recently been found. They cover the so- called cloister vault of San Fernando in the Monasterio de las Huelgas de Burgos, and were discovered while cleaning the plaster which later covered them. Some of the motives copy or trans- late textile and ivory models, and show a net- work of arches, symbols heraldically disposed, leaves, castles, animals (bears, camels, peacocks, eagles, deer, griffons, harpies, hares, etc). Traces of the ancient coloring, red, blue, yellow, 101 The excavations have been directed by the architect F. Hernandez, and the archaeologists E. Camps and R. Castej6n.

Inscriptions, both Cufic and cursive, are also visible (pl. xxIx, c). Apart from their aesthetic value interest also derives from their date, inasmuch as they belong to the thirteenth century, therefore preceding the Granadine gesso. Their technique is also an earlier one, whereas the Granadine examples were made by a mold, those of Burgos were cut freshly in the soft plaster. They are prior there- fore in date and technique to those of the Alhambra.107 We shall refer to Arabian textiles of the twelfth-thirteenth centuries in the follow- ing paragraph. CHRISTIAN SPAIN The most important discoveries of the mediae- val period in Spain have been those in the Monasterio de las Huelgas of Burgos. Here a short time ago they uncovered thirty-seven sepulchres and began to study the remains, both human and artistic (fabrics), which were left after previous profanations (Frankish spoliations during the War of Independence), during which time the jewels must have disappeared. Only one of these thirty-seven royal sepulchres had not been profaned at some time in the past. In this Royal Pantheon of the Monasterio de las Huelgas there are burials which date from the end of the twelfth century, but most of them, including the most important, already belong to the thirteenth. Others go down to the six- teenth century. Among the most famous persons buried here appear Alphonso VIIIth of Castile and Leonore of England, founders of the Mon- astery; Henry, son and successor of Alphonso; Alphonso's daughters, Constance, Leonore, Queen of Arag6n, and first born Berenquela, wife of Alphonso IXth of Leon, later Queen of Castile. The unusual series of textiles turned up here presents itself as the most superb collection of its kind throughout the West in mediaeval times. Some of the pieces are Christian, but for the most part they are Arabian and extremely handsome. A classification has been made by Gomez- Moreno in his book on the sepulchres; a) classi- cal Arab series; b) Moorish series; c) Christian series; d) painted fabric series; e) oriental series; f) striped textiles; g) plain textiles; h) scarves of light gauze fabric; i) ribbons; j) braids; k) em- broidery; 1) gems. When you add this series of textiles to those previously acquired from thir- teenth century tombs (e.g. the tombs of Bernard, Archbishop of Compostela; Rodrigo Jimenez de Roda, Archbishop of Toledo; Infante Don Felipe and his wife; Pedro de Urg, Bishop of Uregel; etc.), it is perhaps no exaggeration to state with Gomez-Moreno, "that it constitutes a treasury of industrial products of the thirteenth century and the centuries immediately preceding and following, without a rival, and perhaps elevates Spanish production above the entire West, in some branches." The same can be said for the fabrics found in the tomb of Don Enrique IV of Castile (end of the fifteenth century) opened recently in the Monasterio de Guada- lupe. POLAND By Louise Llewellyn Jarecka After the defeat of the German Army of in- vasion, Polish scholars returned to the work of the conservation of old monuments and of scientific research. The curator of regional antiquities in the small town of Strzelno, east of Gniezno in the district of Poznan, Zdzislaw Kepinski, has made some interesting discoveries within the last few months. Long ago there had been found among the ruins of the fortifications a few examples of early Romanesque sculpture from the Rotunda and the Basilica of the Norbertanek Cloisters known as the Holy Trinity. Both churches were built about the middle of the twelfth century. The latter, destroyed by many invasions and rebuilt in the thirteenth and eighteenth centuries re- spectively in Gothic and in Baroque styles, pre- served nevertheless through the centuries its original Romanesque plan. This led Curator Kepinski to suspect that the foursquare pillars which had formerly separated the main nave from the sides and that supported the Baroque vaulting, might owe the form of their later con- struction to the masking of their original shapes. And indeed when the brick superstructure had been ripped off, there stood revealed four well preserved Romanesque columns, built of the local sandstone (pl. xxx). The pair nearest the presbyterium was covered 107 F. Inguez, AEArq, xlv, 1941; L. Torres Balbis, Al-Andalus, viii, 1943. F. Ifiiguez and L. Monteverde played principal roles in their discovery.</page><page sequence="72">270 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGY with figures in relief; the second pair by the choir consisted of one column that had been poly- chromed in the style of the epoch and another sculptured in a spiral. The average height of the columns was 4 meters, together with the capital. The base of each presented an ornate profile with dominating motifs in concave grooves instead of the mouldings characteristic of the Romanesque on German territories. The figures in relief (pl. xxxi) were set within three groups of arcades separated by six little columns in each group. There are thirty-six figures on the two tall columns representing saints with aureoles, a nude figure of Adam, winged cherubs, knights and personifi- cations of the virtues and the vices. The vigor and strength of the modelling, the differentiation of the faces and the soft flow of the draperies indicate a mastery of artistic directive. The ex- ceptional daring of the composition betrays a close relation between these freshly discovered relics and the remains of sculpture preserved down to the present time in the churches of Strzelno, pointing to the probability that they all derived from the same workshops or group of artists, even though not at precisely the same time. The influence of French art on Polish church architecture in the twelfth century is confirmed by an ever increasing accumulation of evidence. Poland maintained at that time both commercial and artistic ties with France and Belgium and many religious Orders were imported from those countries, who in turn brought in builders and sculptors. The method of treatment apparent in these reliefs at Strzelno compared with sculpture of the same period preserved in the North of France and in Belgium would argue that the sculptors brought to Poland from beyond the Moselle created a sort of Polish "school," active no doubt until the end of the twelfth century. The little town of Strzelno is thus in possession of a precise historical document.</page><page sequence="73">PLATE XII ::. . . . . . . . . . . . ..............::-::::::i- ..... .. .. .. . . .. .. ..
