CHAMBERLAIN [NOTE. - Authors, especially those whose articles appear in journals and other serials not entirely devoted to anthropology, will greatly aid this department of the American Anthropologist by sending directly to Dr A. F. Chamberlain, Clark University, Worcester, Massachusetts, U. S. A., reprints or copies of such studies as they may desire to have noticed in these pages. - EDITOR.] GENERAL Andr6e (R.) Ethnologische Betrachtun- gen iiber Hockerbestattung. (A. f. An- throp., Brnschwg., 1907, N. F., vI, 282- 307, 2 pl., 17 fgs. ) Treats of the racial distribution of the "knee-elbow" dis- position of the corpse in burial in Amer- ica (Aleuts, Eskimo, N. W. Pacific coast, California, " mound-builders," Mohawks, Muskhogee, Pimas, Mexico and C. America, funeral-urn region of S. America, - Tupi-Guarani in particu- lar, Chaco, Peru, etc.), Europe (wide- spread in prehistoric times), Africa (Egyptians, Hottentots, Bantu tribes, and some W. African negroes), Asia (un- known in Islam and over a large part of the continent; known in several regions of Hindustan, Andaman ids., Malacca, Malay archipelago, Japan among poorer classes), Australia, Melanesia and Poly- nesia, etc. The various methods of dis- posing the body in this way (sitting, lying, orientation, position according to sex, social standing, etc.) are briefly considered. Among the reasons for the "knee-elbow" position are lack of space (e. g., in urns, etc.) and dislike to dig graves large enough (primitive "laziness") ; it is the common position of rest and sleep among very many peo- ples, and so appropriate to the dead, especially where death is affined to sleep; the limbs are tied to the body to prevent the return of the dead, etc. Dr A. rejects the theory that this position for the dead was intended to imitate the embryo in the womb of the mother, hold- ing that a knowledge of the embryo-posi- tion was hardly possessed by man in the stone age, or by later savages. Bartels (P.) Tuberkulose (Wirbelkaries) in der jiingeren Steinzeit. (Ibid., 243- 255, I pl., 4 fgs.) Describes a skeleton of the later stone age, found in a grave at Heidelberg in 1904, of which the spinal column in the region of the 3d to 6th vertebrae (of which a detailed account is- given) show pathological changes due probably to tuberculosis. It is interest- ing to note that the individual had prob- ably recovered from the disease - Spon- dylitis tuberculosa. Bergt (W.) Dr Hermann Obst. (Jhrb. d. strdt. Mus. f.

In both cases affections of the bony structure (rachitis) were noted, and Dr B. finds the causes of scaphocephaly in rachitic disease of the skull after birth, intrameningeal dropsy, and irregularities in the ossification of the sutures. C. (F.) Francisco Ferraz de Macedo. (Portugalia, Porto, 1907, II, 480, I fg. ) Brief account of scientific activities, list of chief publications, etc., of Dr Ferraz de Macedo (1845-1907), the Portuguese anthropologist and criminologist. He had charge of the photo-anthropometric laboratory of the criminal court in Lisbon. He was the author of two works relating to America: O Homemn quaternario e as civilisaces prehistoricas na America (Lisboa, 1882) and Ethno- genie brisilienne (Lisboa, 1886-87). Curtin (R. G.) The medical superstitions of precious stones, including notes on the therapeutics of other stones. (Bull. Amer. Acad. Med., Phila., 1907, viI, repr. pp. 51.) After discussing generally super- stitions relating to "unlucky stones," scarabs, flint knives, "blessed stones," amulets, charms, crystals, changes of color in stones, colors, etc., the author treats of the diamond (classed in some parts of Europe in the Middle Ages with the animals), amethyst (by the Greeks deemed the antidote for wine), topaz (cured lunacy and many other affections of mind and body), torquoise (emblem of success), carnelian, chrysolite (wanes and grows in its faculties with the moon), jet, amber (powerful against witchcraft and sorcery),rock crystal,agate (" almost a universal remedy " ), bloodstone, onyx, jade (warded off kidney disease), sar- donyx, emerald (older in history than the diamond ; now tabooed for engage- ment rings), opal (one most prized of all stones; now recovering a lost popular- ity), cat's eyes, lapislazuli, garnet, car- buncle, ruby (always a " lucky stone "), sapphire, pearls, coral (associated with children), zircon, ranolite, stanotite, spinel, moonstone, hyacinth, jasper, bezoar, toadstone, lodestone, eagle stone, alecoria, mineral stone, vegetable stone, magical stone, angelical stone, white and red stone, lapis porcinus, lapis armenus, philosopher's stone, snake-stone, mad- stone, hag-stone, elf-stones, birth-stones, the months and their gems, symbols of gems, etc. Dr C. is also the author of A Study of Ancient and MAodern Secret Aledical Fraternities (Phila., 1907, pp. 24), in which are briefly treated the Greek mysteries, Asclepiads, Pythagoras, Hippocrates, Essenes, Druids, Rosicru- cians, Christians, Fraternity in Phila- delphia (in 1819), and allied medical clubs, etc. Dr C. thinks that " Moses, Iemhotep, Solomon, Pythagoras, Hip- pocrates, and the Asclepiads were fel- low-fraters of ours, having belonged to secret medical fraternities." Modern Greek-letter societies are essentially of American College origin, and Greek-letter medical fraternities are only a few years old. The author argues in favor of such societies. Czekanowski (J.) Untersuchungen iiber das Verhiltnis der Kopfmasse zu den Schidelmassen. (A. f. Anthrop., Brnschwg., 1907, N. F., vI, 42-89, 4 fgs.) Detailed discussion, with many tables, mathematical formulae, etc., of the rela- tion of the measurements of the head to those of the skull - methods, statistical (biometric) ideas, relation between measurements on the living individual and on the skeleton, complicating factors (race, age, sex, nutrition), history of the problem, results of previous studies and of C.'s investigation of 65 male and 54 female corpses from the Ziirich Patho- logical Institute. The general difference between the indices of head and skull is about 3 unities for the same individual. The soft parts reach their maximum thickness at the age of 40-50. Race (type), age, sex, and nutritional condi- tion affect the soft parts as well as the relations between measurements of head and skull. Emil Schmidt. [(A. f. Anthrop., Brnschwg., 1907, N.

Argues for a unitary phonetic system as a key to dictionary pronunciation, for recording the results of dialect research, and for the teaching of foreign languages. Summarizes efforts in this direction and advocates an international conference. See Hewilt (J. N. B. ). Hamy (E. T.) La collection anthropolo- gique du Mus6um National d'Histoire Naturelle. Le&lt;on d'ouverture du cours d'Anthropologie faite le II avril, 1907. (L'Anthropologie, Paris, I907, xvIII, 257-276.) Sketches the history of the anthropological collection of the National Museum of Natural History (the chair to which these specimens be- long was created in I635 for the study of surgery), the special collections now number some 49,000 objects, of which about 27,000 were added during the regime of Dr Hamy. Hewitt (J. N. B.) Proposed international phonetic conference to adopt a universal alphabet. (Congr. Int. d. Amer., xve Sess., Quebec, 19o6 [1907], II, 273- 276). Argues that "a single alphabet ought to be adopted by the common con- sent of all the branches of science con- cerned." This could be provided by utilizing the variations current already in the forms of the Roman alphabet among the European nations and by a few addi- tional modifications of these letters. To create such a world alphabet an interna- tional conference of delegates represent- ing philological societies, the Interna- tional Geographic Congress, Boards 6n Geographic Names, the great diction- aries, the International Phonetic Asso- ciation and certain educational organiza- tions is advocated. See Geddes (J.). Hofler (M.) Gebildbrote bei Sterbeflillen. (A. f. Anthrop., Brnschwg., 1907, N. F., vi, 91-III, 6 fgs., 2 pl.) Treats of funeral bread in the forms of animals, etc. (hare, stag, dog, horse, cow, sheep, pig, fowl, eggs, dove, goose, fish), vegetables, etc. (" soul-corn," millet pap and sub- stitutes for such) ; in the form of hair- braids, pretzels, rings, crowns and wreaths, etc. These cakes and loaves in forms of animals, etc., represent many relics of the symbols of the ancient cult of the dead. Interesting is the compari- son (p. Io9) between ancient Egypt and modern Bavaria. Kendall (H. G. O.) The case for eoliths restated. (Man, Lond., 1907, vii, 84- 86.) Author argues that " although we have discovered the handiwork of human beings who may be described as pre- paleolithic, we have not yet got back to a time when some individuals could not make a flaked implement of paleolithic type." Nevertheless the ruder imple- ments seem to have been trimmed by the hand of man. Kraus (A.) Etnografia musicale. Ap- punti sulla musica dei popoli nordici. (A. p. l'Antrop., Firenze, 1907, xxxvII, 47-87 + I-12, 3 pl.) Treats of music among the North American Indians, peoples of Siberia and Russia (Aryan and Anaryan), Scandinavians, Scotch, Irish, Gaels, and Celts. Texts and music of American Indian, Siberian songs, etc., are given ; also Russian, Scandinavian, English folk-songs, etc. The predomi- nant tonal systems, like the musical instru- ments, are assigned a Central Asian origin. Lattes (L.) Asimmetrie cerebrale nei normali e nei delinquenti. (A. di Psichi- atria, Torino, 1907, xxvIII, 1-22, pl.) Gives results of examination of Ioo right and left hemispheres in the Turin Ana- tomical Laboratory. The weight-differ- ences between the two hemispheres are greater in criminals ; the greatest differ- ence found was 60 gr., larger than pre- viously reported by Saraglia, Giacomini, etc.; 5 per cent. of the cases had equal weight for both hemispheres. Morpho- logical asymmetries in the parietal and occipital lobes and the "Affenspalte" are noted. Lomer (G.) Schaidelmasse und Beruf. (Allg. Z. f. Psychiatrie, Berlin, 1907,</page><page sequence="6">148 AMERICAN ANT7ROPOLOGIST [N. S., 1o, 1908 LXIV, 612-618.) Gives results of skull measurements of 210 sane and 382 psycho- pathic inmates of the hospital at Tapiau (East Prussia) compared with 28 crimi- nals, and with special reference to the professions of the subjects (workmen, manual laborers, peasants, merchants, officials, students, and learned men with- out professional education). Dr L. found that the majority of the cranial measurements were greater with the mentally unsound than with the sane; that the smallest skull-measurements came from the lowest (workmen) social class; and that the skull-measurements of the sane peasants were strikingly large. The measurements of the mentally un- sound manual laborers, merchants, offi- cials in general were about the same. As to the cephalic index the learned class has the highest, the peasants the lowest, while the workmen approximate most of all to the dolichocephalic type. Mannu (A.) Sui rudimenti della vertebra occipitale nel cranio umano. (A. d. Soc. Rom. di Antrop., 1907, XIII, 227- 248, 13 fgs.) Figures and describes 20 cases (out of 295 skulls) showing more or less traces of the presence of the primitive "occipital vertebra" in the human adult. The pharyngeal tubercle is present in 15 of these cases. Mibius (P. J. ) Ueber die Verschiedenheit mannlicher und weiblicher Schidel. (A. f. Anthrop., Brnschwg., 1907, N. F., vI, 1-7, I pl., 5 fgs.) Treats particularly of the greater prominence of the upper portions of the occiput (a fact noted by Gall and confirmed by M.) in woman as compared with man. This peculiar form of the female occiput M. considers re- lated " to the quality of woman in which she exceeds man." This occipital " boss " is the only plus in the female as compared with the male skull. Piccinini (C.) Sul valore degli errori cromatici nell' infanzia. (A. p. l'An- trop., Firenze, 1907, xxxvII, 41-45.) Gives results of investigation of color- errors in 80 children. P. found that, contrary to the conclasions of Garbini, errors of this sort in children of 6 and 7 years are due in large part to lack of attention and do not demonstrate any principle. Pittaluga (R.) Studi osteologici sulle scimmie antropomorfe. (A. d. Soc. Rom. di Anthrop., 1907, XIII, 155-185, 3 fgs. ) Descriptions and measurements of 4 orang, 5 hylobates, 3 gorilla, and 4 chim- panzee skulls, of which the last and those of 2 orangs belonged to young in- dividuals. The occipital, temporal, pari- etal, and frontal bones are studied in de- tail. Previous data are resumed. The greatest capacity of the orangs is 422 ccm., of the gorillas 510 ccm., of the chimpanzee 403 ccm. The young are more brachycephalic than the adults. The hylobates differ from the other an- thropomorphic apes in several respects. The occipital bone nearest that of man is that of the chimpanzee; the temporal bone of all these anthropomorphic apes departs least from that of man, and un- dergoes variations of little importance in passing from the infantile to the adult state; the parietal bones are notably re- duced as compared with the correspond- ing human ones; two fundamental types of frontal bone occur, between which ex- tremes lies that of the chimpanzee. Reche (O.) Ueber den Nasenindex. (Korr.-Bl. d. D. Ges. f. Anthrop., Brnschwg., 1907, xxxvIII, 49-52.) Argues that the old nasal index (length : breadth) is worthless as a means of dis- tinguishing human from animal forms - a Viti Islander, e. g., has an index of 48 and a Troglodaytes niger one of 48. I; a Tirolese one of 56.5 and a Simia satyr one of 56. Dr R. proposes two new nasal indices, which give better results for higher forms in the animal scale and for diverse races. R6v6sz (B.) Rassen und Geisteskrank- heiten. Ein Beitrag zur Rassenpatho- logie. (A. f. Anthrop., Brnschwg., 1907, N. F., VI, 180-I87.) General discussion of mental affections among races and peoples and their prevalence : Japanese (hysteria and neurasthenia common; "possession" ), Malays (latak, "running amuck "; Tagal mali-mali, Burmeseyaun, Siberian miryachit, Ainu imnubacco, etc.), Abyssinian and Algerian peoples (lathrysmus), African negroes (alcoholism, " sleeping sickness'" ), American negroes (increase of mental diseases since emancipation ; from his own observations in Brazil Dr R. con- firms F. da Rocha's opinion of the resis- tance of the negro to alcohol), American Indians ("kayak-faint" of the Eskimo, probably akin to agoraphobia and not due to coffee drinking or tobacco-smok- ing), etc. Asia is preeminent for the occurrence of mental diseases among her races of man. Rosen (F.) Darstellende Kunst im Kin-</page><page sequence="7">CHAMBERLAIN] PERIODICAL LITERATURE 149 desalter der Valker. (Z. f. Angew. Psychol., Leipzig, 1907, I, 93-118, 6 fgs.) Compares particularly the art of Giotto and that of the child - art in the individual repeats in its essential traits the development of the race. The child begins with outline drawings; both child and art begin also with man, the human form; the highest object of art is the first object. Primitives and children relate and wish to be understood in their draw- ings. Another resemblance between early art and children's drawings is the way in which the time-problem is solved. Rouse (M. L.) The pedigree of the na- tions. - II. (J. Trans. Vict. Inst., Lond., 1907, xxxIX, 83-101.) An outrh attempt to ethnologize the lists of the members of one of the great families of Japhet as given in the tenth chapter of Genesis. Here are considered the de- scendants of Tiras. This paper belongs with Prof. John Campbell's Etruscan " interpretations" and Hittite theories. Schreiber (W.) Ueber die Deviation der anatomischen von der geometrischen Medianebene des menschlichen Schdidel, in bezug auf die Biaurikularlinie. (As f. Anthrop., Brnschwg., 1907, N. F., VI. 256-269, 6 fgs.) Treats of deviation of the anatomical from the geometric me- dian plane in the human skull in rela- tion to the biauricular line, the methods and apparatus for investigation, etc. No skull is so symmetrical as to be without such deviation (left prevails). Such de- viation does not follow race or skull form, and the cause is not purely morpho- logical. Stefanini (G.) Terre eduli esistenti nel Museo Nazionale d'Antropologia di Firenze. (A. p. 1'Antrop., Firenze, 1907, xxxvII, 89-112.) Lists and de- scribes 21 specimens (India 15, Sumatra I, New Guinea 5) of edible earth in the Museum at Florence. This custom was known to the ancient Latins, and is in vogue today in parts of Treviso, Sar- dinia, etc. The literature of the subject is briefly r6sum6d, with references. Tovo (C.) Sur le suture palatine trans- verse chez les criminels. (A. d. Psichi- atria, Torino, 1907, xxxvIII, 464-468, 3 fgs.) Gives results of examinations of 130 normal and 148 criminal skulls, all male, and chiefly from upper Italy; and of 98 normal female (from Piedmont) and 311 criminal female skulls (mostly from southern Italy). The "atavistic" (turn forward) type of the suture occurs in 71 per cent. of male and 62 per cent. of female criminals as compared with 58 per cent. and 49 per cent. among normal individuals. The "progressive" type is found in 12.2 per cent. and 15.2 per cent. of male and female criminals, and in 24.8 per cent. and 23 per cent. of nor- mal individuals. Welldon (-) The development of the religious faculty in man, apart from revelation. (J. Trans. Vict. Inst., Lond., 1937, XXXIx, 7-21.) Treats of sleep and dreams, illness, lunacy, death, and the religious ideas, etc., associated with them among uncivilized races. Primitive man spiritualizes and personi- fies Nature. Man "owes his religious interpretation of the natural world to the constitution of his own nature." EUROPE Blake (T. P. U.) Matrimonial customs in the west of Ireland.

Discusses the black and red imprints of human hands (chiefly left) in the remarkable cavern of Gargas in the commune of Aventignan (Hautes-Pyr~nbes). C. be- lieves that these hand-imprints due to early prehistoric man "are identical in individual aspect, in grouping, and in technique," with those reported from Australia, and owe their origin' in both cases to the same superstitious beliefs. - et Breuil (L'AbbW) Les oeuvres d'art de la collection de Vibraye au Mus6um Na-</page><page sequence="8">150 AMERICAN ANTHROPOLOGIST [N. s., IO, 1908 tional.

B.) The European sky-god. VIII. The Celts. (Folk Lore, Lond., 1907, xvII, 24-53.) Discusses the old Highland poem on "The death of Fraoch," the tale' of "The slothful Gillie " (ca. 1630), with. their "magic tree," and cognate episodes in Chictien de Troyes Yvain, Hartmann von Aue's Jwein, and the tale of The Lady of the Fountain from the Welsh lMabinogion. According to C. " the Anglo-Norman tale underlying Yvain and The Lady of the Fountain may be regarded as the source of several episodes contained in the old French prose romance called the Livre d'Artus." The tree episode goes back to "one common Celtic myth, which implies . . . a ritual practice strictly analogous to that of the rex Nemorensis." As the heroine of the French Arthurian romances was derived essentially from the ancient Celtic fte, their typical hero came likewise from "'the Celtic aspirant to the position of woodland king." Thus the rule of the Arician priesthood lies at the basis of medieval chivalry. Cox (M. R.) Cinderella. (Ibid., I9I- 208.) Cites r6sumes of numerous Scan- dinavian Cinderella stories not included in Miss C.'s Cinderella published in 1893. Also references to Cinderella variants in other languages published since 1893. Eyles (F.) Notes and queries on Dr Ran- dall-Maciver's " Medieval Rhodesia." (Man, Lond., 1907, viI, 7-9.) Points out some difficulties in the way of Dr R.- M.'s view that these ruins were built by the native Africans, e. g. the Bantu. See also p. 43. Fortes (J.) Duas joias archaicas. (Por- tugalia, Porto, 1907, II, 412-416, 3 fgs. ) Describes and discusses an ornamented gold collar from Valle da Malhado (Vouga) and a bracelet from Bairro. The first resembles Portuguese gold and silver collars or bracelets of the bronze age and those from Beachy Head (Sussex), etc., but for the present must be classed by itself. In form the Bairro bracelet is Iberic, pre-Roman, and very ancient. Frassetto (F.) Crani antichi del contado di Camerino III e II secolo av. Cristo. (A. d. Soc. Rom. di Antrop., 1907, xIII, 195-225, 7 fgs. ) Descriptions (Sergian) and measurements of 15 ancient skulls from Camerino belonging to the second or the third century B.c., and now in the Museum of the University of Bologna. One pathological skull was found. Of the others' Io are " Eurafrican," and 4 " Eurasian." The cephalic index ranges from 71 to 83, the capacity from I17I to 1580. The chief anatomico- anthropological variations are described. These skulls represent a mixed Eurafrican (preponderating) and Eurasian popula- tion. Gasti (G.) Sui disegni papillari. (Ibid., 187-194, Io fgs.) Gives results of ex- amination of finger-prints of 100 foreign- ers (of whom 50 Germans), Ioo normal individuals, and Ioo criminals from cen- tral Italy, and distribution of the 9 types (exclusive of lacking or indecipherable) found. Dr G. found among the foreign- ers a greater prevalence of simple types, and in the Italian criminals a preponder- ance of the complicated types, the nor- mal Italians showing more complication than the foreigners and less than the criminals. Giuffrida-Ruggeri (V.) Materiale palet- nologico della grotta del Castello di Termini Imerese. (Ibid., 143-154, 2 pl., 2 fgs.) Describes and figures 37 stone implements (with references to a number of others), from the cavern of Castello di Termini Imerese, a pre-neo- lithic "station," probably Solutrean. This is indicated also by the fauna. Gray (II. St. G.) An arrowhead of rare type from Banwell Camp, Somerset.

(L'Anthropologie, Paris, 1907, xvIII, 127-139, 5 fgs.) Treats of human bones from the tumulus of Franche-Comt6 (Mont de PgBgille, Brery), and Lor- raine (Foret de Haye, Clayeures, and Contrex6ville), with measurements of 10 skulls. Dr H. believes that the intro- duction of iron into western Europe is associated with the appearance of a dolichocephalic " new race." Certain regions at this time show a mixture of the old brachycephalic and new dolicho- cephalic types. Harrison (M. C.) Serpent procession at Cucullo. (Folk-Lore, Lond., 1907, xvIII, 187-191, 2 pl.) Describes the procession of S. Domenico of Foligno, patron of Cucullo, a village in the Abruzzi mountains, --the feast of ser- pents, or of S. Domenico is held on the first Thursday in May and is visited by people from all south Italy. Serpents collected by the ser paro, or snake-men, are hung about the saint and coiled in his hand. Afterward the snakes are paid for and killed. Hoffiller (V.) O nekim starinama, naba- vljenim za narodni muzej godine 19o6. (Vjes. hrvatsk. arh. Drustva, Zagreb, 1907, N. s., IX, 194-200, 4 fgs.)

Topographical notes on Kos- troman (Castra romana), Gora Zaprta (Mons Claudius), Bile vode (Aquae gradatae, Albae aquae), Titusevina, Bez- ja'ija, Hampovica. Lang (A.) Celtic sword blades. (Man, Lond., 1907, vU, 3-4.) Discusses the passage in Polybius on the badness of Celtic iron, which S. Reinach has re- cently termed "a mere etiological myth," which idea L. does not accept. Lewis (H. L.) The flint supplies of the ancient Cornish. (Ibid., 21-22.) Points out, following F. Brent, that the flints were brought in bulk from certain places on the coast and worked up on the spots where they were found in large numbers. - Notes on some rude stone monuments in Glamorganshire. (Ibid., 37-39.) Describes briefly cromlechs and dolmens at St Nicholas, St Lythan's, etc., the last being extremely like " Kit Coty's House" in Kent. Resemblance to dol- mens of India is also pointed out. - Modern Druids in Wales. (Ibid., 70-72.) Treats of the stones near Ponty- pridd and the books of Myfyr Morganwg and " Morien," with the theories em- bodied therein. Mr L. is of opinion that " whatever fragments of antique tradition may be in possession of the modern pro- fessors of Druidism, a knowledge of the original manner of using the British cir- cles is not among them." Lones (T. E.) Folk-lore of Aristotle. (Folk-lore, Lond., 1907, XVIII, 212- 215.) Cites from Aristotle's History of Animals 10 items of folk-lore concerning animals and asks for modern Greek correspondences. Macdonald (A.) Some former customs of the royal parish of Crathie, Scotland. (Ibid., 84-86.) Treats briefly of circuit of fields at Hallowe'en with lighted torches to ensure fertility, burials (no more burials of unbaptized children after sunset), etc. M'Kenzie (D.) Children and wells. (Ibid., 253-282.) Points out the fre- quency of the belief that wells cure chil- drens' diseases (detailed examples from England), discusses use of wells for bap- tismal purposes, the ceremonial washing, baptism, lustration, etc., of children (widespread and ancient custom among civilized and uncivilized peoples), pre- Christian holy wells in Britain, child-lore of water (supposed origin of infants from sea, lake, river, marsh), birth- goddesses and water, baths for curing sterility and helping childbirth, water- spirits and children, child sacrifice to wells, rivers, etc., children as rain-mak- ers. Dr M. thinks the idea of the con- nection between water and children (at first thought to be actual and physical, later mystic only) was based on the two facts that "children in the prenatal period do actually live in water" and "there is a natural association between fertility and water, seen plainly in the vegetable world." Since "the spirit of life of the well was also the spirit of life of children, then immersion in a well would renew the life of ailing and weakly children." Monteiro (M.) A loiga de Miranda do</page><page sequence="10">152 AMERICAN ANTHROPOLOGIST7 [N. S., IO, 1908 Corvo. (Portugalia, Porto, 1907, II, 431-438, 6 fgs.) Treats of the pottery of Miranda do Corvo, in the district of Coimbra, a great ceramic center. The ceramic ware of this locality was noted, among rustic potteries, for its elegance of form, etc. Moser (L. K.) Ein Ausflug nach der Sandinsel Sansego. (Globus, Brnschwg., 1907, xvI, 249-256, 6 fgs.) Describes a visit in April 1906 to Sansego, a sand- island of the Adriatic coast, its people, etc. - they are Croats and call the island Sul'ak. The sand of Sansego has been much written about, and the Abbot Fortis, in 1771, connected it with the legend of the Argonauts. Peixoto (K.) Os cataventos. (Portu- galia, Porto, 1907, II, 439-448, 46 fgs. ) Interesting account of weather-vanes of numerous types in various regions of Por- tugal. In the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries weather-vanes became real or- naments. Some were originally heraldic emblems. Others resemble children's toys. Peixoto (R.) O traje serrano. Norte de Portugal. (Ibid., 360-389, 55 fgs.) Treats of dress and ornament among the mountaineers of northern Portugal (Serra da Amarella, Miranda, Marao, Serra de Arga, Gralheira, Montesinho, PitOes, Rebordaos, Montalegre, etc.) - clothes, cloaks, capes, caps, hats, shawls, shoes, etc. Some of the crude garbs corre- spond quite to the descriptions of Strabo. P. criticizes some of the illustrations in the Album de Costumes Portuguezes (Lisboa, 1888). Pinho (J.) Ethnographia Amarantina. II. A pesca. (Ibid., 448-459, 22 fgs.) Treats of fishing (implements, nets, traps, boats, etc. ) in the region of Amar- ante, on the Rio Tamega, Portugal. Pocock (W. I.) Supplementary notes on cat's cradle and string-tricks. (Folk- Lore, Lond., 1907, XVIII, :25-329, I fg.) Records and describes four Rumanian string-tricks (etelbetel) - " cutting off the head," watch-guard, mouse alter- native, button-hole, with comparaive notes. In parts of E. Somerset "cat's cradle" is known as "the hammock," "the chair," etc. Riitimeyer (L.) Ueber Masken und Maskengebriuche im L6tschental, Kan- ton Wallis. (Globus, Brnschwg., 1907, XCI, 201-204, 215-218, I pl., I fg.) Describes the masks of the L6tsch valley in the Swiss canton of Valais and their uses --a sort of species relicta, with comparative notes on similar objects in other parts of the globe. These masks are worn but once in the year (for three days in Lent) and then only by young bachelors, never by married men. A costume of sheep skins with co.w-bells attached goes with the masks. R. thinks that these maskings go back to an age-class secret society. In Valais the barns and houses still represent the old pile-dwellings. dos Santos Rocha (A.) Esta4oes pre- romanas da idade do ferro nas visin- hangas da Figueira. (Portugalia, 1907, II, 301-356, 13 pl., 4 fgs.). Treats of the pre-Roman " stations" of the iron age in the neighborhood of Figueira, at Santa Olaya, where were discovered, besides mediaeval ruins and a Luso- Roman "station," three pre-Roman " stations " belonging probably to the "savages" of this region mentioned by Strabo. Buildings, metal implements and instruments (iron was forged, but copper and bronze objects imported), pottery (both primitive local types and exotic wheel-made and others), objects of glass, bone, and stone, and kitchen refuse are described. At Ferrestello was discovered a necropolis, with inhumation. The culture represented by the imple- ments, etc., is the second period of the European iron age, but with few and unimportant art objects. Some of the pottery of foreign aspect may have been made by Carthaginian immigrants or colonists. Some came from Spain. Schcetensack (0.) Ueber die Gleichzeit- igkeit der menschlichen Niederlassung im L6ss bei Munzingen unweit Freiburg i. B. und der dem Magdal6nien zugehari- zen paliolithischen Schicht von Thaingen und Schweizersbild bei Schaflhausen. (A. f. Anthrop., Brnschwg., 1907, N. F., VI, 169-179, 3 pl., I fg.) Against Stein- mann, the author holds that the culture- deposits of Munzingen are postglacial, not inter-glacial, and represent the Mag- dalenian (80 stone implements are fig- ured), as do the "stations" of Thaingen and Schweizersbild. Steinmann's views are criticized in detail. Sergi (G.) I sepol creti di Novilara, Pesaro. (A. d. Soc. Rom. di Antrop., 1907, XlII, 129-142, 9 fgs.) Descrip- tion and measurements of 47 skulls from Molaroni and Servici, two burial places at Novilara. At the first and older loca- tion, the so-called "Pelasgic" types</page><page sequence="11">CHAMBERLAIN] PERIODICAL LITERA TURE 153 (Ellipsoides pelasgicus), markedly doli- chocephalic, is more common, though characteristic of both. S. believes that the remains found at Novilara indicate "'a late Pelasgic or Mycenean colony." This is supported by archeological data (stelae, ornaments, etc.). A second burial of another people has also occur- red at Novilara. The incriptions on the stelae seem to be in a non-Aryan tongue. The burial-places were investigated in 1893. Severo (R.) Necropoles lusitano-romanas de inhumacao. (Portugalia, Porto, 1907, II, 417-431, 22 fgs.) Describes the Lusitanian-Roman burial-places of Bair- ral, Villa Verde, etc., and the objects found in the graves (clay vessels, terra sigillata dishes, glass vases, iron nails, pieces of coal, etc. ). As arrecadas d'ouro de Castro de Laundos. (Ibid., 403-412, I pl., 7 fgs.) Describes two gold ear-rings found in a clay vessel, with a piece of melted silver and copper at Castro de Laundos. To- gether with finds at Affife, etc., the Laundos ear-rings represent a prehistoric development of gold-working in N. E. Portugal, with barbaric technique. e Cardoso (F.) Note sobre os restos humanos da necropole de Ferre- stello. (Ibid., 357-359.) Gives chief measurements of 2 crania, some long- bones, fragments, from the Luso-Roman "station " of Ferrestello, and compared with the human remains from the "sta- tion " of Desterro. The evidence indi- cates that the proto-historic population of the Mondego valley had approximately the same physical characters as the pres- ent inhabitants. Siret (L.) A propos de poteries pseudo- myc6niennes. (L' Anthropologie, Paris, 1907, xvIII, 277-299, 34 fgs.) After noting proof of the relations of the east- ern and western Mediterranean areas from the beginning of the neolithic period, on the disappearance of the neolithic "civilization" and its replacing by the bronze age, the Punic colonies (particularly Villaricos, the ancient Baria, its tombs, decorated pottery, fibulae, ornaments, ashes-urns, amulets, funeral stelae), the Visigothic necropolis of Almizaraque, etc., S. concludes that the so-called "pseudo-Mycenean " pot- tery was introduced into Spain by the Carthaginians. The Spanish objects of this group form "a variety of the art spread all over the Mediterranean basin at the period of Carthaginian and Greek commercial expansion." This view, S. thinks, is made better than the theory which attributes these ceramic objects in Spain to "a Mycenean influence upon Iberian artists." de Sousa (T. M.) Costumes e tradi4oes agricolas do Minho. I. Regimen pastoral dos povos da Serra do Gerrez. (Portu- galia, Porto, 1907, II, 459-472.) Gives an account of the primitive government in vogue among the pastoral population of the Serra do Gerrez in Portugal. Sturge (W. A.) Thin arrowheads. (Man, Lond., 1907, viI, 37.) Reports an arrow- head from Derbyshire corresponding al- most exactly with that found near Bridg- water (Somerset) in shape, size, and thinness. Tetzner ( F.) Die Slowen. (Globus, Brnschwg., 1907, xcI, 265-270, 3 fgs.) Treats of the Slovenians of Austria: History (Slovenian greeting, Ottocar), customs and usages (wedding, dances, etc.), house and arrangement, hospital- ity, amulets, folk-poetry and fabulous beings (German texts of 4 songs and a number of epitaphs are given). Val- vasor in 1689 was the first to give details of Slovenian folk-lore; after him Hacquet in I675. Anastasius Grtin (1849) gave many of the songs literary form in German. The Slovenians have the "Wanderlust nach Amerika." Wakefield (S. S.) Marriage customs of the southern Gallas. (Folk-Lore, Lond., 1907, xvIII, 319-325.) No wooing; marriage negotiations by relatives on both sides; power of paternal uncle; bride-price; visit of groom to bride's father; marriage ceremony; address to bride by father; fire-making ; name ; position of women (higher than with some E. African tribes) ; polygamy allowed (each wife has separate dwell- ing); divorce rare; duties of wife; girls under control of mother and corrected by her only ; chastity inculcated. Warren (S. H.) The flint supplies of the ancient Cornish. (Man, Lond., 1907, VIl, 39-41.) Points out that "the raised beaches of Cornwall which yield the chalk flints are clearly Pleistocene, so that if the flint was brought by man it was brought by paleolithic and not by neolithic man," an "absurd and un- reasonable theory." The presence of flint can better be explained by eleva- tion-depression and water action. Weston (J. L.) The grail and the rites</page><page sequence="12">154 AMIERICAN ANTHROPOLOGIST [ N. s., IO, 1908 of Adonis. (Folk-Lore, Lond., 1907, xvIII, 283-305.) Argues that the most characteristic features of the Bleheris Grail story (older than the version of Chrktien) "are a survival misunderstood and imperfectly remembered, of a form of nature worship, closely allied to, if not identical with, the rites of Adonis so exhaustively studied by Dr Frazer in The Golden Bough. The central motif of the Gawain grail-story, Miss W. thinks, is "a death and failure of vege- tation caused by that death." The " maimed King" is also explained by reference to the Adonis rites; likewise the wasting of the land, the "weeping maidens" (" women weeping for Tam- muz"''). The grail itself "is no Chris- tian relic, it acts simply as a food-pro- viding talisman, coming and going without visible agency." The whole machinery of the story is, in fact, non- Christian. Wieland (G. R.) Historic fossil cycads. (Amer. J. Sci., New Haven, 90o8, N. s., xxv, 93-101.) Notes (p. 95) the use of a fossil C. etrusca found in the ancient ruins of the Etruscan village and necropolis (ca. 4000 years old) on the river Reno, and bearing evidences of having been used as a smoothing or sharpening stone. W. has suggested that " not a few of the fossil cycad trunks were gathered into towns or cities now in ruins or long since destroyed." Zur Nephritfrage. (Globus, Brnschwg., 1907, xcI, 225.) Brief r6sum6 of Prof. Kalkowsky's important work on the "Geologie des Nephrits im Siidlichen Ligurien," in the Ztschr. d. deutschen Geol. Ges. for 190o6. K. found nephrite in some II different places. Prof. K. has also recently published another article on "Der Nephrit des Bodensees" in Isis (Dresden) for 1906. Nephrite was used much by the lake-dwellers. AFRICA Abiose. Some West African customs (Folk-Lore, Lond., 1907, xvIII, 86-88. ) Notes on taking baby out of cradle, measuring time by cock-crow, dangers of whistling (forbidden in house, as it in- vites snakes, etc.), pregnant woman armed at night, hissing, etc., when one sees a flash of lightning, honoring the dead at family feasts, etc., passing younger children over corpse of parent. Bertrand (L.) Notes et documents sur Rusicade. (Rec. d. Doc. et M6m. Soc. Archbol. du Dep. de Constantine, 19o6 [I907], XL, 71-82, 6 pl.) Gives ac- count of recent excavations at the Villa Sallustiana (?) probably the villa of Sallust, the Roman historian and pro- consul of Numidia at Colonia Veneria Rusicade, etc. A marble fountain was discovered in 184o at Rusicade. All along the shores of the Numidian gulf are remains of villas, public monuments and temples. Carton (-) Cinquieme annuaire d'6pi- graphie africaine, 1905-190o6. (Ibid., 201-267.) Bibliographic index and list of African inscriptions ( Latin, Greek, Punic, Libyan) published in 1905-1906. What may be an Etruscan inscription is noted at page 256. Debruge (A.) La station quaternaire Ali-Bacha, t Bougie. (Ibid., I19-158, Io pl., 7 fgs.) Describes investigations at the quaternary cave of " Ali Bacha " and the "station" in its neighborhood, finds, etc., in 1902 and subsequently. The " shelter " yielded many flints, etc., of the Mousterian type, but no pottery, and but two specimens of polished bone and two shell beads. The cave itself was used for burial. In the first cave were found flints, bones, a human skele- ton, etc.; in the second cave the skeleton of an infant; in the third cave a human skull, etc., and a number of copper ob- jects, which the author considers "one of the earliest attempts to make coins." Elsewhere in the cave skull fragments, teeth, ocher, bits of red hematite, shells, animal bones, etc.,also a polished stone hatchet. The human beings represent- ed may have been of the Cro-Magnon type. See Delisle (F.). Delisle (F.) Deuxiame note sur les os- sements humains pr6historiques de la (Grotte Ali Bacha. Ibid., 197-200oo.) Brief description of a male cranium, upper maxillary, lower maxillary. These remains resemble the Kabyle and also the Cro-Magnon type.

Gives from the Ms. in the Bibliothbque Nationale of Paris numer- ous extracts referring to the Maghreb in in Nodjoum of Djem&amp;l ed-Din Abu'l- Mehasin Yusuf ben Tangri-berdi, an Egyptian writer, of Turkish origin (d. 1469 A.D. ). Frobenius (L.) Ethnologische Ergebnisse der ersten Reisen der Deutschen Inner- Afrikanischen Forschungs-Expedition. (Z. f. Ethnol., Berlin, 1907, XXXIx, 311-333, 24 pp.) Gives the results of ethnologic researches in 1905 in the Kassai basin, etc. Houses, bows (maps of distribution; 3 types), wood-work, etc. The tribes concerned are Kioque, Bapenda, Bakuba, Baluba (Bechuana type),-the most adaptive and industrious of the Kassai peoples exceeded in intelli- gence only by the Kioque, - Bassongo- Mino related to the Batelela-Wakussu and really Mongo, etc. Dr F. considers that the styles of Benin bronzes, the Saharan embroidery, and the textile pro- ducts and carvings of the Bakuba belong together, though their origin is yet un- known. The parallelism (p. 332) of three series of motifs (Benin, Bakuba, and Lombard) is interesting and sugges- tive, but F. does not commit himself. Gaillard (-) Etude sur les lacustres du Bas-Dahomey. (L'Anthropologie, Paris, 1907, xvIII, 99-125, I pl., 7 fgs.) Treats of the lake-dwellers of the region of Lake Nokou6 in the marshy delta of the Oubmb, etc. Physical characters (lower limbs and gait modified by bent position), dress and ornament, habitations (pile- dwellings, canoe-shelters, etc.; some of these natives are lacustrine only in the rainy season), birth, marriage, death and burial (children circumcized at about 6; polygamy in vogue; no tombs on piles, burial places always inland for each vil- lage), religion (the supreme fetish is Ma6, - others are thunder, smallpox, rainbow, etc.; fetish-men a special caste), social organization (holiday every five days), trade (cowrie-money for- merly), fishing, arts and industries, musical instruments, disease and mor- tality (smallpox worst; death-rate not above 40 to 50 per 3,0oo at the village of Avansouri), etc., are discussed. Gautier (E. F.) Etudes d' ethnographie Saharienne. (Ibid., 37-68, 315-332, I pl., 13 fgs.) Gives the results of inves- tigations made in 1904-1905 in the Sahara from South Oran to the Niger: The tombs (ardjem) of several types scattered all over the country traversed, particularly at Ain Sefra, Beni-Ounif, etc., their form, contents, etc., and other stone monuments; rock-sculptures (at Barrebi, Ain Memnouna, Hadjra Mek- touba, Foum Zeggag, Ouan Toura, Timissao, Ifor'ass) ; neolithic weapons and implements (from the " stations " of AMn Sefra, Zafrani, Tar'it, at Savoura, Touat, Ahnet, Tanezrouft, Adr'ar', Ifor'ass, Tilemsi, etc.). According to G., the evidence at hand indicates that in the neolithic age the Soudan (negro or negro-mitis) advanced to the gates of Algeria, as now the Berbers have made their way even to the Niger. The Berber occupancy (marked by ardjem, rock sculptures, and tifin'ar inscriptions) of this area is relatively recent. The neolithic people of the north were nomad Berbers, those of the Central Sahara agricultural negroes. By scratch- ing the Tuareg Berber one easily finds the negro. Even as late as the period of the Roman conquest the Berbers and negroes of the Soudan held the relations indicated. The progressive desiccation of the Sahara (aided by the introduction of the camel, the Arab conquest, etc.), has opened it to the Berbers and closed it to the Soudanese. Much can be urged in favor of this view. Grell (S.) Note sur une inscription de la r6gion de Sbtif. (Rec. d. Doc. et M6m. Soc. Archbol. du Dep. de Constantine, 1906 [1907], XL, III-II8.)

Gutmann (-) Die Fabelwesen in der Mdirchen der Wadschagga. (Globus, Brnschwg., 1907, xcI, 239-243.) The largest cycle of legends among the Wajagga treat of a monster called frimu (a metamorphosed human being), who is not, however, without some kindly traits; another fabulous being resembles the unicorn of ancient European lore; a third is the huge snake, Mfolyimo, and a fourth the giant cow Rdli.

Lortet thinks, of the Groeco-Roman epoch). The cranial type is that known as annular scaphocephaly. The head is compared with the scaphocephalic skull of an Egyptian mummy. The figurine rep- resents possibly a syphilitic subject. Johnson (J. P.) Note on a stone imple- ment from the Embabaan valley, South Africa. (Man, Lond., 1907, vii, 86- 88, I fg.) Describes an implement of Solurio-Magdalenian type from the Em- babaan valley, and of more recent date probably than those of the Acheulean type reported from the tin-bearing gravels of this stream. von Luschan (F.) Ueber Boote aus Baumrinde. (Repr. from Aus der Natur, 1907, pp. 13.) Treats of boats of bark with special reference to a pas- sage in an anonymous Periplus maris Erythrwi dating from the last half of the first century A. D., relating to the island of Menuthias, i. e. Zanzibar, and to a bark-boat from the Mozambique coast, now in the Museum fiir V61lkerkunde, of which a detailed description is given. The two great "bark boat areas" of the globe are America and Australia. Maclaud (-) Notes anthropologiques sur les Diola de la Casamance. (L'An- thropologie, Paris, 1907, xvIII, 69-98, 6 fgs.) After treating briefly of the habitat, tribal divisions (the io sections number some Ioo,ooo souls, the Diamate and the Diola of Fogny being the larg- est), history, etc., of the Diola or Felup peoples of the lower river Casamance, West Africa, Dr M. discusses physical characters - stature, color, hair, consti- tution, features, mutilations, etc. - and gives details of description and measure- ments of the skull and skeleton of Sialab6, a Diola chief (a characteristic negro), now in the Museum. The theory of the ethnic unity of the abor- igines of West Africa, Dr M. thinks, though very probably true, remains to be proved. Mercier (G.) Une inscription arabe de Constantin. (Rec. d. Doc. et M~m. Soc. Arch6ol. du Dep. de Constantine, 19o6 [1907], XL, 383-386.) Records an inscription (in mechergi characters) of 1793 A. D., from the Arab cemetery, in memory of Mohammed ben Reduan, whose father was cadi of Belt-el-Nal. de Morgan (J.) Note sur l'incertitude de la chronologie relative des faits pr~his- toriques. (L' Anthropologie, Pari s, 1907, XVIII, 380-383, I fg.) Illustrates theoretically, on the basis of observa- tions in North Africa, the difficulty of basing chronology correctly upon the</page><page sequence="15">CHAMBERLAIN] PERIODICAL LITERATURE 157 superpositions observable in the alluvia, in caverns, etc. Pallary (P.)

Recherches palethnologiques sur le littoral du Maroc en 1906. (Ibid., 301- 314, 4 fgs.) Notes on finds of prehis- torique flint implements on the coast of Morocco, -Zaffarine Is. (flints rare), M61ila, Tetuan (traces of '"stations"), Centa (no "station" found), Tangier (nothing ancient), Larache (flints and quartzites abundant, some fine), Rabat (implements of Pleistocene epoch dis- covered here, for the first time in Mo- rocco), Casablanca (I"station" at Onck), Mazagan, Saffi (no characteristic "sta- tions"), Mogador, etc. The oldest "station" on the Moroccan littoral be- longs to the Pleistocene. Further ex- ploration of the bed of the Oued-bou- Regreg at Rabat and the cliffs from Rabat to Mazagan is desirable. Passarge (S.) Ophir und die Simbabye- kultur. (Globus, Brnschwg., 1907, xcI, 229-232.) Opposes Randall-Maclver's theory of the Middle Ages origin of the Zimbabye ruins and argues that " Ophir " was in Rhodesia and these famous re- mains are to be attributed to the exten- sion to that region of Sabean culture. Robert (A.) Documents romains divers d6couverts dans la commune mixte des Maadid. (Rec. d. Doc. et M6m. Soc. Arch6ol. du D6p. de Constantin, 1906 L'907 ], XL, 99-104, 2 fgs.)

Brief account of the six coats of mail said to have belonged to the mara- bout Sid-el-Djoudi, but probably origi- nating from the warriors of the Duc de Beaufort, killed at the siege of Djidelli in 1664. Rouquette (0. A.) La n6cropole numide et romaine d'Ain-el-Hout, environs de Souk-Ahras, Province de Constantine, Alg6rie. (Ibid., 82-98, 7 pl.) Gives account of the exploration of the little Numidian-Roman burial-place of Ain-el- Hout and the discoveries made-graves (incineration, inhumation, holes in rocks), inscription (one only), funerary objects of terra cotta (56 lamps, 2 urns, 5 dishes, 12 unguentaria), marble (2 tablets), glass (14 unguentaria), ivory (12 pins), bronze (lamp snuffers, fibuloe, rings, bracelets, styli, mirrors, compass, lantern, etc.), iron (knife blade, nails), lead (a spoon or spatula), coins, etc. The necropolis probably belongs to the close of the first century, B. C., or to the first century A. D., and was used during the first two centuries A. D., covering a period from incineration with funerary object, to inhumation without them. Sabatier (-) Mus~ede T6bessa. (Rec. d. Nat., ibid., 1-70.) Descriptive cata- logue of the objects inside and outside the temple-pottery, tiles, painted terra- cotta statuary, mosaics, marble and stone statuary, sculpture, architecture, votive stelse, altars, etc., inscriptions, stone and marble objects, bronze and other metals, glass, etc., dedications, funeral monu- ments, boundary-stones, etc., funeral epig- raphy, Christian and heathen antiquities, etc. More than Iooo objects are listed. Seton-Karr (H. W.) On a maul from Upper Egypt. (Man, Lond., 1907, V)), 6, I fg.) Note on "a rare, if not unique" type, showing a peculiar style of hafting. It may possibly be modern, nothing being known of its exact provenience. Torday (E.) and Joyce (T. A.) Note on the southern Ba-mbala. (Ibid., 81- 84, I pl., 2 fgs.) Describes habitat, clothing, ornament, iron-smelting, social classes, pregnancy-customs, cross-bow (used only as a child's toy), religious ideas, etc. Boys are circumcized before they are a year old. No tattooing or cicatrization is in vogue. The northern tribe practise cannibalism. Vel (A.) Excursion arch6ologique sur le territoire de la commune mixte d'Ain- M'lila. (Rec. d. Doc. et M6m. Soc.

S., 10, 1908 ASIA Baelz (E.) Zur Vor- und Urgeschichte Japans. (Z. f. Ethnol., Berlin, 1907, xxxIx, 281-310, 15 fgs.) After brief discussion of Ainu (more Caucasian than Mongolian) and other elements of population, Dr B. treats of shell-heaps and " stations " of the stone age, and the remains and implements, etc., there dis- covered (best ceramic objects, particu- larly clay human figures in N. Japan, - animal figures rare and small), bronze age (little known ; at least 1,500 years old), iron age (" the dolmen period "- four types; misasagi or emperor-graves) and its remains (swords, bronze orna- ments, pottery, clay figures, and images). The bronze-culture of Japan is found exclusively, and the iron-culture almost exclusively, west of a broad isthmus in E. lat. 136-1I37, north of which is found the neolithic culture (here but a single iron-culture "island" appears, i. e. aboutTokyo). Five other dolmen-centers occur, two on the island of Kiushiu. The age of the dolmens,-they are suigeneris, - is probably from 400 B. C. to 700 A. D. The Ainu are the stone- age people of Japan; the bronze-age people of the S. W. expelled or subdued a more primitive stock; the iron-age people of the S. W. represent a conquer- ing stock who ultimately took possession of the whole empire. Bernstein (Der) in China. (Globus, Brnschwg., 1907, xcI, 224-225.) Re- sumps the monograph of Dr B. Laufer in MWem. Amer-. Anthrop. Assoc., 1907, I, 211-244. Dalton (0. M.) Gandhara sculptures. (Man, Lond., 1907, viI, 69-70, I fg.) Brief description of a panel in gray schist showing evidence of Graeco-Roman in- fluence, particularly a sella curulis upon which one of the figures sits. Faber (E.) Contribution to the nomen- clature of Chinese plants. (J. N. China Branch R. Asiatic Soc., Shanghai, 1907, xxxvIII, 97-164.) Treats of the iden- tification of the plant-names contained in a Chinese book published first in the seventeenth century and several times since. At pages 133-161 is given an alphabetical list of the scientific plant- names with their equivalents in Chinese. Based on MS. of Dr F., revised by Dr Barchet and the editor. Keane (A. H.) The Cochin tribes and castes. (Man, Lond., 1907, vIl, 41-42.) Based on the monographs published by L. A. Krishna Iyer. The Kadir hill- men, K. thinks, present "distinct negroid features," and tend to support "the view now gaining ground that a negro or negrito element formed the sub- stratum of the populations of Southern India, which is now almost exclusively inhabited by Dravidians and Kolarians from Central Asia." Masterman (E. W. G.) Recent dis- coveries in Palestine in relation to the Bible. (J. Trans. Vict. Inst., Lond., 1907, xxxIX, 218-254.) Treats of ex- cavations at Tell el Hesy (on the edge of the Philistine plain) and other south- ern tells: Tell el Mutasellim, Tell el Ta'anuk, etc. Also (pp. 228-249) the religious beliefs and culture of the early inhabitants as revealed by the examina- tion of tombs, high-places, etc. The pottery-types recognized are : I. Prehis- toric (earliest pottery of Gezer ca. 4000 B.C.) ; 2. Historic; I) early Amorite or early pre-Israelite (ante 1600 B.C.) ; 2) later Amonte or late pre-Israelite (1600- 1300 B.C.) ; 3) Phenician influence (1300-1oo B.C.) ; 4) later Phenician (1000-800 B.C. and later) ; 5) Hellenic influence (8oo-600 B.C.) ; 6) later Hel- lenic; 7) Roman. Morse (H. B.) Currency in China. (J. N. China Branch R. Asiatic Soc., Shanghai, 1907, xxxvIII, 1-60, 8 pl. ) Interesting account of "1those systems which lead directly to the inodern cur- rency practice of the Empire " - copper currency, paper money, 'silver currency, etc. Odling (C. W.) Orissa; a little known province of the Indian empire. (J. Trans. Vict. Inst., Lond., 1907, XXXIX, 119- 145.) Treats of language (Uriya, a distinct Aryan dialect with a special al- phabet) and inscriptions, religion (holy- land of Buddhists and then also of Hin- dus), Jaganath worship, population (occupations, industries, etc.), society and family life (few criminals of any caste), childhood (children universally happy). In Orissa still exist remains of the different culture-waves that have passed over India. Louse (W. H. D.) Presidential address. (Folk-Lore, Lond., 1907, xvIII, 12-23. ) Treats of the Pali Jata/a Book, birth- stories of Buddha, a collection, which seems to have existed even before the split of the northern and southern Bud- dhists and to have been esteemed sacred ca. 300 years after the death of Gautama</page><page sequence="17">CHAMBERLAIN] PERIODICAL LIJERA TURE 159 Buddha. The Jataka book has connec- tions with -Esop's ?Fables, the Gesta Romanorum, and a good deal of modern Oriental folk-literature, as R. points out. There are also numerous allusions in the Jataka to superstitions, charms, incan- tations, etc. Sarasin (F. u. P.) Die Steinzeit der Weddas. (Globus, Brnschwg., 1907, xcI, 255-256.) Brief letter announcing the discovery in Nilgala, the center of the Vedda country, of chips, knives, ar- rowheads, scrapers, and other stone im- plements, proving fully a stone age for this interesting primitive people. In these caves and holes has thus been found the evidence of a stone age for the prehistoric Veddas. Spoer (Mrs HI. H.) The powers of evil in Jerusalem. (Folk-Lore, Lond., 1907, xvIII, 54-76). Treats of folk-lore of water and the bath, invocation of name of God against evil spirits, jinns, Chris- tian and Moslem bath-formulke, finns and their doings, sacrifice, annual (Mos- lem) pilgrimage to the shrine of Moses in the desert of Judea, use of "revenge image'" for bewitching by Arabs, man- drake, high-places and standing stones, spirits and apparitions under trees, sacred trees, amulets, Jewish folk-lore concern- ing jinns, divination, children's games, "Solomon's quarries," "tomb of Ra- chel," etc. Turner ( . S.) Mencius. (J. Trans. Vict. Inst., Lond., 1907, xxxIX, 255- 269.) Outlines the teachings of the Chinese philosopher (d. 288 B.C.), par- ticularly his doctrine of the original and inherent goodness of human nature. White (G. E.) Survivals of primitive religion among the people of Asia Minor. (Ibid., 146-166, 2 pl.) In Asia Minor both Mohammedanism and Christianity carry with them much of old heathen belief. In the Oriental churches the Trinity is practically the Father, the Son, and the Virgin Mary - this due to the domination of belief in the mother prin- ciple in the divine nature. Sacrifice still holds a large place in the religion of the people. The lore of the saints (St George is venerated by Armenians, Greeks, and Turks alike; shrines once Mohammedan and now Christian, and vice-versa) is paralleled by lore of/jinns and evil spirits. Belief in the "evil eye" is general. Religious festivals on mountain-tops in summer are held by Armenians as well as Greeks, and there are perceptible "traces of a primitive agricultural religious year." Luck and prognostics of all sorts are believed in. INDONESIA, AUSTRALASIA, POLYNESIA PEdge-artington (T. W.) Ingava, chief of Rubiana, Solomon islands, died 19o6.

Possibly used for storing greenstone meres, etc. van Gennep (A.) Questions australiennes. (Ibid., 23-24.) Replies to a critique by A. Lang and discusses the primitive Australian theories of generation. Howitt (A. W.) The native tribes of Southeast Australia. (Folk-Lore, Lond., 1907, xvIII, 166-186.) Reply to and critique of previous article by Mr N. W. Thomas. Argues that the classificatory system is closely connected with pfr- raura marriage. The tippa-malku is " not a classificatory term, but defines the relation between two individuals." Dr HI. considers that the noa relation- ship "restricted the range of an earlier and wider license to the present limits of the pirraura marriage." Preceding this wider license was a period of promis- cuity. The "group mother" is also dis- cussed. Dr Howitt died March 8, ISo8. KrAmer (A.) Zur Tatauierung der Mentawei-Insulaner. (A. f. Anthrop., Brnschwg., 1907, N. F., VI, 36-41, 5 fgs.) Describes tattooing (breast, belly, back, leg, arm, hand, etc.), among the Mentawei islanders, gives native technical terms with interpreta- tions, etc. The locality concerned is Pageh. K. compares his observations with those of Volz -he considers incor- rect the statement of V. that these islanders are very dirty and have "flat feet."'' Krause (F.) Zur Ethnographie der Insel Nissan. (Jhrb. d. staidt. Mus. f. Vlkrk. zu Leipzig, 19o6 [I9o7], 1, 44-159, 126 fgs.)

W. Solomon ids., and forms a notable link in the intercourse between these and Bismarck group. Lang (A.) Australia : Prayer. (Man, Lond., 1907, vII, 67-69.) Reply to Marett (q. v.) regarding prayer among the Australian aborigines as reported by Mrs Langloh Parker. Conceptional totemism and exog. amy. (Ibid., 88-90.) Discusses A- van Gennep's " conceptional " theory of totemism as set forth in his Mythes et ldgendes d'Australie (Paris, 1906). Marett (R. R.) Australia : Prayer. (Ibid., 2-3.) Questions the validity of the cases of prayer among the native Australians cited by Mrs Langloh Parker. Suggests "coloring." Schoeppel (F. A.) Kommerzielles Hand- buch von Niederlandisch-Indien. (Abh. d. K. K. Geogr. Ges. in Wien, 1907, VI, 2, I-X, I-301, 26 pl., 2 maps.) Pages 1-34 of this "Handbook of the Dutch Indies" treat of population, na- tive and immigrant. No Negrito tribe of pure type has yet been shown to exist in Dutch India,-such alleged "black" tribes turn out to be always very mixed. At pages I-27 is an interesting general account of the aborigines, their divisions according to languages, religion and civilization, character and life. Brief sections follow on the Arabs, Chinese, and Europeans. On pages 202-211 are considered the art industries of the na- tives-- architecture (temple ruins of Java), textiles (in particular batik ), leather work (figures for puppet-shows are a Javanese specialty), carving, etc. The native population of the Dutch Indies increased 1880-1885 10.9 per cent., 1885-1890, I I.4 per cent. and 1895-1900 the increase was 3,o015,186. Of the alphabets in use the Javanese- Bali, Batak, Redjang-Lampong, Macas- sar-Buginese-Endeh-Bimanese, are of Hindu origin ; Atjeh and Ternate, Ara- bic; and the Roman alphabet has been introduced among some tribes (p. 9). Hindu and Arab influences in religion have been important and "a large part of the culture of the natives of the Archi- pelago is of Hindu-Javanese origin." Dr S. does not take a high view of the character of the Malayan peoples. The Arabs of the Dutch Indies came chiefly from Hadramant (E. Arabia) and brought no women with them, marrying Malay women of the country. The Chinese have not mingled so much with the natives, and the author considers a general mixture improbable. The Euro- pean-Malay mixture (mostly illegitimate) has in many places already affected the physical and even the mental type of the European population (p. 29).. Seidel (H.) Die politische und wirt- schaftliche Lage auf den Neuen Hebri- den. (Globus, Brnschwg., 1907, xcI, 261--264, 280-285, 5 fgs.) Discusses the political and economic relations of the New Hebrides. Contains some notes on the aborigines (physical characters, houses, canoes), missionary efforts, etc. Thomas (N. W.) Australian marriage customs. (Folk-Lore, Lond., 1907, xvIII, 306-318.) Reply to and criti- cism of previous article by Dr A. W. Howitt. Discusses terminology, theory of social evolution, origin of marital terms, meaning of maian-bra and kandri, and area of pirraura custom. Woodford (C. M.) Notes on Rennell island. (Ibid., 33-37, 4 fgs.) Treats briefly of habitat, origin (probably cast- aways from the N. of Santa Cruz), cloth- ing, weapons, tree-cutting, tattooing, etc. The numerals I-Io and a few other words (p. 37) indicate the Polynesian origin of the language.

Haida portrait-mask. (Man, Lond., 1907, vII, 1-2, I pl. ) Describes a mask carved from a solid block of wood some 40 years ago by a Haida Indian, intended to be a portrait of his wife, and "1a good likeness." This mask is now in the Pitt Rivers Museum, Oxford. Batres (L.) Les fouilles op6r6es h Thoti- huacan. (Congr. Int. d. Amer., xve Sess., Quebec, 19o6 [I907], H, 279-282.) De- scribes excavations begun in 1904 under auspices of Mexican government, Pyra- mid and Temple of the Sun in particular. The "city" appears to have been de- stroyed by fire. The excavations so far "have revealed magnificent archeological treasures." Boas (F.) Notes on the Ponka Grammar. (Ibid., 317-337.) Outlines the gram- mar of the Ponka language of the Siouan stock, richer in morphology than the Dakota. Articles (inanimate, ani- mate, and indefinite), demonstrative, personal, and possessive pronouns, the verb (instrumental, locative prefixes; pronominal forms, indirect object, parti- cles, etc.), are cited and explained. In Ponka the irregularities of the verb are much greater than in Dakota, and the wealth of form in the article is phe- nomenal. Breton (A.) The wall . paintings at Chichen-Itza. (Ibid., 165-169.) De- scribes briefly paintings, method (evi- dence of two artists, one careful and methodical, the other more impetuous), colors (two reds, two blues, four greens, yellow, white, black, purplish tint, and various tones of flesh color), etc. Dif- ferent race-types are represented. Scenes of sacrifice and of war are figured and some personages are painted life-size. To the graffiti of the ancient devotees have been added names of the local tourists. Carelessness of copyists has injured some of the paintings. Bushnell (D. I., Jr.) Primitive salt- making in the Mississippi valley. (Man, Lond., 1907, vIi, 17-21, I pl., 5 fgs.) Describes, with account of pottery, im- plements (stone, bone), animal remains, shells, etc. (probably refuse-heaps etc. ), found in a very interesting and exten- sive salt-making site, near the village of Kimmswick, Jefferson Co., Missouri. It had probably been abandoned before the arrival of the French in Louisiana, and was similar to the site on B.ack river referred to by Du Pratz. At Kimmswick no objects of European workmanship were found in either the superstratum or the stone-lined graves near by. Chamberlain (A. F.) South American linguistic stocks. (Congr. Int. d. Amer., xveSess., Quebec, 19o6 [I907], II, 187-204.) Points out need of map of distribution of S. American stocks (since completed by the author) ; dis- cusses recent classifications. Gives list of 83 stocks with locations, etc. Charency (Cte. de) Deux contes des Indiens Chontales. (Ibid., 307-3i6.) French text of two tales ("Fourteen forces, or the godson of the brother," and " Juan Clapi, or Ashes John" col- lected among the Chontal Indians of Oaxaca by F. E. Belmar. Both stories are perhaps more European than aborig- inal, the second belonging in the Cin- derella cycle, though very distantly. De Cora (Angel) An effort to encourage Indian art. (Ibid., 205-209.) Argues against the "attempt to transform the Indians into a brown Caucasian within the space of five years or a little more." Criticize's exhibits of Indian school work done under dominance of white ideas; points out good results achieved when "young Indians recognized themselves as such and came into their own." Dionne (N. E.) Les langues sauvages du Canada et l'oraison dominicale. (Ibid., 211-216. ) Prints sideby side and points out differences between the translations of the Lord's Prayer in the language of the Montagnais Indians by Father Le Jeune in 1634 and Father La Brosse in 1767. The differences "Iindicate rather a progress in the language than an incon- sistency in the way of speaking." Dixon (R. B.) Linguistic relationships within the Shasta- Achomawi stock. (Ibid., 255-263. ) Treats of the lexical and grammatical differences among the various languages (Shasta, Achomawi, Atsugewi, New River, Konomihu, and Okwanutcu, the last a dialect of Shasta) of this stock. In the Achomawi and Atsugewi 35 per cent. of the vocabulary are alike, the remaining two-thirds being radically distinct; and but 15 per cent. of the Shasta vocabulary is represented in the Achomawi-Atsugewi. The New River agrees with Achonawi-Atsugewi in c . 8 per cent., and with Shasta in AM. ANTH., N. S., O--II.</page><page sequence="20">162 AMERICAN ANTHROPOLOGIST [N. S., Io, 1908 ca. 16 per cent. The limit of difference is reached in the Konomihu. In this stock striking grammatical variations also occur, particularly in the pronouns and verbal forms. According to Dr D., "the great linguistic and considerable cultural complexity of this whole Cali- fornia-Oregon region is due to progres- sive differentiation, rather than to the crowding into this restricted area of remnants of originally discrete stocks.

From graves excavated in the raised beaches of Taltal three classes of pottery have been taken, all of which were probably of local origin - Peruvian black ware is wanting and there is "a total absence of any attempt at molded ornament." The ornamentation is painted on outside and inside with black pigment, the commonest design being the freehand spiral. On two fragments the guanaco is pictured. Gagnon (A.) Origine de la civilisation de l'Am6rique pr6colombienne. (Cong. Int. dt Ambr., xv: Sess., Quebec, 1906 [I907], II, I7I-I78.) From analogies of architecture, ornamentation, social organization, etc., the author attributes the pre-Columbian civilization to the "Cushites" of S. W. Asia, Chaldea, and Assyria, who reached the New World by way of S. E. Asia, Malaysia, Polynesia. Jett' (J.) On the language of the Ten'a. (Man., Lond., 1907, viI, 51-56.)

Altmexikanische Mo- saiken im Kgl. Museum fiir Volker- kunde zu Berlin. (Ibid., 339-349, 4 fgs.) Describes a double-jaguar from the collection of A. v. Humboldt and a jaguar head from the Bevern collection, both now in the Royal Ethnological Museum, Berlin. Of such ancient Mexi- can and Central American mosaics but 23 exist in European museums. The Ber- lin Museum possesses also a mosaic skull- mask. -- Ergebnisse und Aufgaben der mexi- kanischen Forschung. (A. f. Anthrop., Brnschwg., 1907, N. F., VI, 113-168, 2 pl.) Resumbs results and problems of Mexican anthropology, philology, and ethnology, with full bibliographical ref- erences and estimates of value of various authorities. L. believes man to be so old in America as to be practically au- tochthonous (there has been no contact between the Old World and the New from the earliest times). The physical anthropology of the Mexican Indians is in a very unsatisfactory state (the "American race" was unitary only at the beginning). Among the languages of Mexico of independent stocks are Otomi (the Otomis are thought by some to represent the real aborigines of the country), Totonaco, Tarasco, Mixteco- Zapoteco, Mix6-Zoque, Huave, etc. The Huaxteco is perhaps the oldest mem- ber of the Mayan family. Some of the tribes in ancient Mexico belonged with the Mayan culture-group. At pages 149-166 Dr L. discusses climate, material culture, sociology, intellectual culture, etc. He sees in the "IToltecs" a Nahua people, from whom both Mexican and Mayan peoples received their culture. Lejeal (L.) et Boman (E.) La question Calchaquie. (Cong. Int. d. Amer., XVe Sess., Qu6bec, 1906 [I907l 1, 1, 79- 186. ) Treats of the historical and ethnic geography of the Calchaquis, the monu- ments, ethnographlc material, etc., of the Calchaqui region, the history and linguistics of the Ando-Peruvian area, etc. The conclusions reached are that the Calchaqui culture is really a Diaguito culture; that the Diaguito culture in almost all its details belongs archeolog- ically with the great pre-Columbian civili- zation of Peru; that no distinct " Cal- chaqui race " existed, and no relationship of the so-called "Calchaquis" to the Pueblos Indians of N. America can be maintained. Lemoine (PIre) Le g6nie de la langue</page><page sequence="21">CHAMBERLAIN] PERIODICAL LITERA TURE 163 Algonquine. (Ibid., 225-242.) Outlines the grammar (noun, adjective, pronoun, verb, and verbal particles) of the Algon- kin, spoken at the Lake of the Two Mountains, Maniwaki, etc., at lakes Barridre, Victoria, Temiskaming, and Abittibi ; at Grassy Lake, Golden Lake, and at Mattawa. According to Father L. the elementary words of Algonkin are as short as those of French; the lan- guage is really neither monosyllabic nor sesquipedalian. This language was stu- died earlier by Cuoq. Mavor (J.) The Eskimo of the Mackenzie river. (Univ. Mo., Toronto, 19o08, vIII, 142-145.) Notes on the Kogmollik and other Eskimo of the coast east and west of the Mackenzie, based on letters of V. Stefhnsson, name, type, etc. Their numbers have seriously diminished. The Nunatama are "inland, deer-hunting Eskimo." Ostermann (L.) The Navaho noun. (Congr. Int. d. Am6r.; XVe Sess., Qu6bec, 1906 [I9071, II, 243-254.) Treats of Navaho nouns from the etymo- logical standpoint (4 classes: radical, verbal, composite, foreign, - radical nouns are of one or more syllables), grammatically (no grammatical gender; but larger, robuster things are often styled male; and weaker, gentler, etc., female ; personifications rare ; no special forms for plural, - terms of relationship, how- ever, seem to have separate forms ; de- clension; augmentation and diminution expressed by adding adjectives; homo- nyms and synonyms scarce ; pronouns of address), etc. Certain Navaho nouns in particular are also discussed : terms for wagon, locomotive, nickel, dime, iron, house, paper, etc. Rivet (-) Les Indiens Jibaros. ttude g6ographique, historique et ethno- graphique. (L'Anthropologie, Paris, 1907, XVIII; 333-368, 9 fgs.) First part of a valuable monograph on the Jivaro Indians of Ecuador, with abund- ant bibliographical references, map, etc. The name (Xivaro, Xibaro in 1651, with many varieties since), habitat (region of rivers Santiago, Morona, and Pastaza), history and mission efforts, geographical distribution (list of numer- ous tribes), population (ca. 20,000), physical characters (stature below aver- age, skull sub-brachycephalic; body- painting), material life (dress simple; 3 sorts of " crowns" ; ear-rings, necklaces, belts, etc.), are discussed. Dr R.'s study is a welcome addition to the litera- ture of the Jivaran stock. Sapper (K.) Grenada. (Globus, Brns- chwg., 1907, xcI, 233-239, 4 fgs. ) Con- tains a few notes on the negro popu- lation, - Choles und Chorties. (Congr. Int. d. Amer. xve Sess., Quebec, 19o6 [I907], II, 423-438, map.) Treats of the past distribution of the Chol and Chorti language. The speakers of Chol and Chorti in Central America now number 20,000, the related Chisequefios, Lan- quineros, and Cahaboneros Io,ooo. Dr S. thinks that the Lacandones and Acalones of the I6th and 17th centuries also spoke Chol. The Chol-speaking Lacandones of eastern Chiapas have had their place taken by Mayas bearing the name of Lacandones. The Choles of British Honduras are completely extinct. -- Vocabular in Chorti, Chol und Pocoman von Jilotepeque. (Ibid., 440- 465.) Vocabulary of some 270 words in parallel columns, numerals, pronouns, conjugation, and sentences in Chorti and Pocomam. The closeness of the Chol of Chiapas and the Chorti of eastern Guatemala is seen from these vocabu- laries. They are both dialects of Maya, as is Pocomam. Schmidt (M.) Besondere Geflechtsart der Indianer am Ucayaligebiet. (A. f. Anthrop., Brnschwg., 1907, N. F., VI, 270-281, 2 pl., II fgs.) Treats of the weaving-art of the Conibo and Cocama Indians of the Ucayali region of Peru, as exemplified in their cotton arm-bands, bow-covers, ponchos, etc.; also painted and incised ornaments on pottery, etc. The weaving apparatus is also described and figured. Seler (E. ) Die Wandskulpturen im Tem- pel des Pulquegottes von Tepoztlan. (Congr. Int. d. Am6r., xve Sess., Qu6- bec, 19o6 [I907], II, 351-379, 8 fgs.) Treats of the pulque-god Tepoztecatl, his temple at Tepoztlan (a small but typical ancient Mexican provincial sanc- tuary), and the numerous wall-sculp- tures with which it was adorned -reliefs, symbols, hieroglyphs, etc. According to Dr S. the pulque deities are moon dei- ties. The 18 symbols represent the 18 festivals of the years, a north and a south series. -- Die Monumente von Huilocintla im Canton Tuxpan, des Staates'Vera Cruz. (Ibid., 381-389, 3 fgs.) Describes two reliefs from Huilocintla, one of which is</page><page sequence="22">164 AMERICAN ANTHROPOLOGIST [N. S., Jo, I9oS now at the Colegio Preparatorio of Jalapa, the other (its ciunterpart) in the Hacienda San Isidro, Tuxpan. From study of the figures and symbols Dr S. concludes that the god represented (ce ocelotl, "one jaguar" ) is either Quetzal- coatl himself or one of his incarna- tions. Einige fein bemalte alte Thongefisse der Dr Sologuren'schen Sammlung aus Nochistlan und Cuicatlan im Staate Oaxaca. (Ibid., 391-403, 6 fgs.) Treats of some finely colored and painted figures on old clay vessels from Nochis- tlan and Cuicatlan belonging to the Solo- guren collection of Zapotec antiquities. One vessel has figures of the gods Quet- zalcoatl and Tonacatecutli, the one asso- ciated with a temple, the other with a mountain (the mythical home of the tribes). Another vessel has heads of the death, fire, and sun gods, representing the four cardinal directions. The vessels from Cuicatlan present another and ruder type of art, and have a band of ornamen- tation of human faces, borrowed appar- ently from textile or weaving patterns. These vessels deserve careful study. Bericht iiber die chemische und physikalische Untersuchung einer Mex- ikanischen Kupferaxt. (Ibid., 405-412, 4 fgs.) Gives details of the chemical and physical examination of an old Mexi- can copper axe from the neighborhood of Tlaxiaco (Mixteca Alta). The almost pure copper of this axe appears to have been cast, and in part worked when cold. No traces of tin were found; silver was present .I13 per cent. and zinc.I17 per cent. Iron was not known to the ancient Mexicans. Studien in den Ruinen von Yucatan. (Ibid., 413-422, 6 fgs.) Treats of the Casa del Adivino, Casa de Monjas, Casa de Tortugas, Casa del Gobernador, etc., at Uxmal; the Casa de las Monjas, Castillo, Caracol, etc., at Chich'en itzi. The Caracol type is known elsewhere only from Mayapan. Dr S. thinks that in Chich'en itza a people of Mexican stock was long dominant- a fact indi- cated by the character of the figures of the monuments. Tozzer (A. M. ) Survivals of ancient forms of culture among the Mayas of Yucatan and the Lacandones of Chiapas. (Ibid. 283-288.) The Lacandones "make pilgrimages to the ruins in their midst, and carry with them their incense- burners, in which they offer incense and gifts of food and drink to the gods of the race who are supposed to inhabit the ruins." The "renewal of the incense burners" is a clear survival of a rite mentioned by Landa, even in minor details. Piercing the ear with a stone knife, placing the body over the burning incense are still practised. The names and attributes of many of the old gods survive. So far, however, these people furnish no one capable of giving aid in deciphering the hieroglyphs. This sub- ject is treated further by Dr T. in his monograph on the Mayas and Lacan- dones. Trebitsch (R.) Die "blauen Geburts- flecke" bie den Eskimos in Westgr6n- land. (A. f. Anthrop., Brnschwg., 1907, N. F., VI, 237-242, 7 fgs. De- scribes 14 cases (Godhaab 8, Egedes- minde 3, Upernivik 3) of " Mongolian spots," observed by him in the summer of 1906 among the Eskimo of West Greenland. Of these 5 were girls, and 2 adult men of pure stock; of the chil- dren 6 were of mixed race. Dr T. con- firms the occurrence of these spots in infants, older children, and even adults, in the regio sacralis and adjacent parts. They appear earlier in the lighter-pig- mented than in the darker Eskimo. Dr T. inclines to look on them as a race mark. Verneau (R.) Les nouveaux documents anthropologiques rapportis de 1'Equateur par le Dr Rivet. (L'Anthropologie, Paris, 1907, xvIII, 146-155, 26 fgs. ) Notes on the human remains (350 skulls of 3 types; 150 femurs), numerous stone and bronze objects (axes, clubs, etc.), clay and lava vessels, pottery. ornaments, etc., brought by Dr Rivet from the An- dean region of Equador. Interesting are an anthropomorphic terra-cotta vase from the Napo, a stone idol suggestive of the sculptures of the French dolmens, etc.</page></plain_text>
