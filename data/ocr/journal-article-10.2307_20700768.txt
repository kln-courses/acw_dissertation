<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE LOEE OF THE WH?BE-KOHANGA. NOTES ON PROCREATION AMONG THE MAORI PEOPLE OF NEW ZEALAND. with some account of the various customs, rites, and superstitions pertaining to menstruation, pregnancy, labour, &amp;c. By Elsdon Best. Part I. HAVING resolved to put together such notes concerning Maori sociology, and more especially those pertaining to family life, as I have collected from the Tuhoe tribe, I begin with those treating on birth, in order to give some idea of Maori customs, rites, beliefs, and general ideas connected with generation. The native system of genesiology we shall never know in its entirety, but enough has been preserved to show that the natives of this land treated generation as a most tapu matter, and that they possess a complete ritual in connection with conception, pregnancy, parturition, and care of the young. It will also be seen that the Maori held some very peculiar views and ideas anent these matters ; ideas that are by no means restricted to these people, inasmuch as many similar items have been placed on record as connected with divers barbarous races in various parts of the world. The main part of this paper will be divided into four parts, treat ing on Menstruation, Pregnancy, Abortion, and Labour, while following the latter will be given an account of the treatment accorded to mother and child after they have left the tvhare-kohanga, or " nest house." Preceding the main part of the paper will be given a few notes concerning sex in Nature, and the tendency of the</page><page sequence="2">206 JOURNAL OF THE POLYNESIAN SOCIETY Maori mind to personify natural phenomena, &amp;c, and view such as being represented by, or having originated with, anthropomorphic beings. Animism. There appears to have ever obtained among the neolithic Maori an universal vivification of nature : a personification of, and applica tion of sex to natural phenomena and inanimate objects. The term used here, i.e., personifications, has been objected to, it being said that allegory would be a more correct expression. I would submit, however, that such allegories imply personifications, and that such are often the personified forms of abstract ideas, or continued metaphors. This process of primitive thought was even applied to the period when man had not yet appeared on earth. For strange mythical beings, probably personified forms of cosmic forces, or of unknown aeons, preceded Bangi and Papa (the Sky Parent and the Earth Mother), and these are alluded to in Maori mythology as though anthropomorphous beings ; they cohabited and produced young. The physiogony of Maori myth is both singular and interesting. Their system of anthropogeny resembles those of many other primi tive peoples, in that it derives man from the union of earth and sky, which were looked upon as being the origin of all things. The primitive Maori traced the origin of man, birds, fish, insects, trees, plants, &amp;c, back to Bangi and Papa. But long ages before that there were a series of gods, or allegorised eras, or forces ; and those personifications were also endowed with sex and produced young. From them eventually sprang the earth and sky. The remote primal pair who existed before light, sound, the elements, &amp;c, were Te Bangi-matinitini and Te Ao-matinitini, who are said to have been atua (gods, demons, supernatural beings, or forces). The two produced Te Pu and Te More, who are described as really one being, but possessed of a bi-sexual nature and a double name, the upper part being Te Pu and the lower part Te More. Such was the origin of sex in Maori myth. After these beings came Te Weu, Te Aka, Te Bea, Te Wao-nui, Te Kune, Te Whe, Te Po, and then came Bangi and Papa, the heavens and the earth. The above names are singular ones, those from number three to number eight inclusive being terms applied to trees, their growth, parts, &amp;c. Then come conception, sound, nothingness or chaos, and darkness or gloom. The above allegory accounts for the origin of sex according to Maori myth. From Bangi and Papa sprang certain beings possessed of supernatural powers, though not termed gods, i.e., atua. These were the origin and personification of war, peace, winds, trees, birds,</page><page sequence="3">THE LORE OF THE WHARE-KO HANGA 207 &amp;c, &amp;c. Among these offspring was one Tane-nui-a-rangi?he who searched long for woman ere he found her. His first acts were to produce the various forest trees, by means of cohabiting with certain beings, who are looked upon as the origin and personified forms of such trees.* Then he found woman. Her name was Kurawaka, and she was a daughter of Tiki and Ea. By her Tane had Hine-titama, whom he also married, and this was the origin of incest. Ea was the first woman of this world, the world of light and being. She was taken to wife by Tiki, who was of the Po, or world of darkness. These myths differ somewhat among the various tribes, but the above will give a general idea of their nature and of the Maori idea of the origin of man and of sex. I have never been able to obtain from reliable native sources any corroboration of an unfortunate account of the origin of man which has appeared in print, and which is undoubtedly the result of missionary teaching. According to the myths of the M?t?tua tribes, the sun (Ba) was a male descendant of Rangi and Papa, and who mated with two females, one being the personification of summer, the other that of winter. For a lengthy account of such personifications and anthro pomorphic agents in Maori mythology, see the journal of the Polynesian Society, Vol. viii., p. 94. When Tane desired and sought woman, he hied him to Rangi, the sky parent, and asked : "0 Rangi ? Where is the uha ? " (female or female principle). And Rangi said : " The whare o aitua is below ; above is the lohare o te ora." The first of these terms may be trans lated as " the abode or origin of trouble, death, misfortune." It is here applied to the female organ or principle, and apparently so for two reasons : in the first place, man is born of woman to encounter many troubles in this world, and finally death ; again, the female organ (or principle) was the origin of death. In this wise, when Maui of old sought to gain eternal life for man, he proceeded to enter the organ of Hine-nui-te-Po, Goddess of Death and Queen of Hades, that he might obtain the life principle, or breath of life, from her sacred body, and so conquer death. For the seed of man is implanted in that organ and is endowed therein with the breath of life, or life principle. But it was not to be, and Maui perished in the organ of the Goddess of Hades?that is to say, in the tuhare o aitua. Hence death ever assails man in this world. The term l?hare o aitua might also be applied to Papa, the earth mother, for she is the personifica tion of the female principle. Her descendants who dwell on her broad bosom, i.e., man, birds, trees, &amp;c, all perish and are received back into the earth mother. For Papa said to Rangi: "Our offspring shall return to me in death, and I will conceal them. They shall be our legion of the dead."</page><page sequence="4">JOURNAL OF THE POLYNESIAN SOCIETY The expression tohare o te ora is applied to the heavens and the denizens thereof who have grasped eternal life. For those of the offspring of Eangi and Papa who remained on high, i.e., the sun, moon, and stars, know not death. Ever among the Maori people the organs of generation were deeply imbued with tapu (sacredness, sometimes " uncleanness ") and m?na (influence, prestige, supernatural power), both of an active and of a passive nature. This may have sprung from an observance of the mystery of sex, and the application thereof to all departments of nature, as also such items as those above given. When a person repeated a magic spell?say, to ward off the witchcraft of others, and cause their death?he would place his hand on his genital organs in order to give force, supernatural power (m?na) to his incantation. This is quite Oriental. Observe sundry passages in the Bible, where a man, when making a solemn promise, is said to have placed his hand " in the hollow of his thigh." The ancient sacerdotal term for the organs of generation is tawhito. This was only used in invocations, &amp;c. ; other expressions obtained for ordinary use. An old native said to me : " As for the tawhito of Hine-nui-te-Po, that was the atua which destroyed man " (see ante). And again : " Friend ! the salvation of my ancestors was the ure, the tawhito. By its aid were the shafts of magic warded off and life retained." Ure is the ordinary term for the membrum virile, the expression in common use. The word tawhito may be rendered as " ancient," or "the ancient one," but I am inclined to believe that another meaning of the word, as retained by the natives of Futuna (who are Polynesians and allied to the Maori), is the correct one in this case. The Futuna word ta gito signifies "cause, source, principle, origin." In one sense, however, all these meanings are allied. The Esthonians term their deity " the aged one." Another term, presumably a mystical or sacerdotal expression, applied by the old-time Maori to the male organ, was tangata matua, which would appear to have much the same meaning as tawhito. In time of war the warriors would, prior to setting forth on a foray, pass beneath the tawhito, in order that the m?na of that organ might prevent them from being afflicted by atua (malignant demons, gods), and so be assailed by indecision, faint-heartedness, &amp;c, in battle. This singular rite, termed a hirihiri tana, was effected by means of the men passing between the extended legs of the priest. In like manner, when a warrior has been affected by such afflictions as the above, he will hie him to a firstborn female of a family of rank and get her to cure him. She does so by stepping across his body as he lies on the ground.</page><page sequence="5">THE LORE OF THE WH?RE-KOHANGA 209 The quaint old myth of how the mountains grouped around Lake Taupo quarrelled, separated and went away to other places, is an example of animism, the vivification of nature. Those mountains are endowed with sex, the powers of speech, and locomotion. They married and produced young in the form of hail, snow, and sleet. Such items are illustrations of the ancient hypothesis of the anima mundi, which appears to have obtained among all primitive peoples. Maunga-pohatu, a mountain of Tuhoeland, is spoken of by the Tama Kai-moana sub-tribe as their mother, that people having dwelt beneath it for centuries. After Bongo-maui had visited Whanui (the star Vega) and obtained from him the germs of the humara, or sweet potato, he returned to this lower world and caused his wife, Pani-tinaku, to give birth to the sweet potato, which was thus acquired by the ancestors of the Maori. Several cases of human beings having been born in an extra ordinary or supernatural manner are recorded in native myths and traditions. Thus Bawaho, a son of Hape of the " Bangi-matoru " canoe (which made the land at Ohiwa), was born from the armpit ; also one Tama-mutu, an ancestor of the Tuhoe tribe, entered this world in the same manner. Potiki the first, origin of Nga-Potiki, the ancient people of Tuhoeland, was not the offspring of human parents, but was the result of the union of Hine-pukohu-rangi (personification of mist) and Te Maunga (the mountain). For the Maid of the Mist lured to her arms the mountain, who descended from his high places to Onini at Bua-tahuna, in the Ure-wera County, where originated the ancient tribe of Nga-Potiki, the Children, or Children of the Mist. The above Hine was the personified form of the white mists, as seen among these forest ranges. And when dawn breaks across the vale of Bua-tahuna, you may oft times see the white form of the Mist Maiden as she reclines upon the broad breast of her old-time lover. But when the sunlight gleams down from rugged Huiarau, then is it that Hine fades away and disappears. Cases of miraculous or extraordinary conception are not absent from Maori tradition and mythology. For example, one Kura-nui-a monoa, wife of Toi the Wood Eater, of immortal fame, is said to have been visited by one Tama-i-waho (also known as Puhaorangi), who descended from the heavens and is looked upon as a god, and she bore to him the child Oho-matua-rau. Similar cases are those of Uenuku and Tairi-a-kohu, Te Maunga, and Hine-pukohu-rangi. Such myths are of world-wide distribution ; many of them are allegories based upon natural phenomena, as are the last two above</page><page sequence="6">210 JOURNAL OF THE POLYNESIAN SOCIETY mentioned. The Aztecan myth of Coatlicue and the humming bird, with its Greek counterparts, illustrate another common form of miraculous conceptions as preserved in many lands. Enough has been said to show the supernatural power which the generative organs were supposed to possess by the Maori of old, as also concerning that form of animism which endowed with sex the forces of nature, the heavenly bodies, and other items of the inani mate world. My notes on the evidences of animism and of phallicism to be found in Maori myth and ritual are somewhat numerous, and must be reserved for a separate paper. The word ai signifies to " procreate, beget," while hika means u to generate," and is applied to the generation of fire by the rubbing process, as well as to the generating or begetting of children. This term hika is also used in connection with certain rites, as hika moana, a rite and invocation to calm the ocean. We will now commence the main part of our subject, dealing with the various divisions in the order given above. Menstruation (Paheke). The native terms for menstruation are paheke and mate maroma, The former term is applied to the menses, and is also used as a verb (compare heke, " to descend, to drip.") The expression mate mar ama means literally "monthly sickness," mar ama meaning the moon and the lunar month. The term atua is also sometimes applied to the menses. This word is generally translated as " god," it is applied to demons, evil spirits, spirits of deified ancestors, to caco-d mons, also to diseases (thought to be caused by malignant demons), to persons of evil or quarrelsome nature, &amp;c, also to various phenomena not understood, as menstruation, for example. When the Mat?tua canoe arrived from far Hawaiki and was coasting along the shores of the Bay of Plenty, near Matata, one of the crew said to Wairaka, the principal woman on board :?" Ha ! He atua kai raro i ou loaewae," i.e., " There is an atua beneath your limbs," alluding to her paheke, which he had observed. Hence the name of Te Awa-a-te-atua at that place, meaning, " The Biverof the Atua," or menses. The term parapara is also applied to the menstrual discharge, likewise to that of birth. (Compare para, " refuse, sediment, impurity, dross, etc.") In regard to the name mate mar ama, the monthly " or " moon " sickness, I quote from native authorities :?" The reason of this sick ness being known as mate mar ama is because it affects women when the moon appears. It never affects them when the moon is lost to view, that is during the dark nights (hinapouri) of the moon. Some women are affected when the moon is just seen, and others at various</page><page sequence="7">We have lately come across a genealogical table?said to have been recited by the late Wahanui, principal chief of Ngati Mania-poto?which illustrates in a very complete manner Mr. Best's remarks on the successive generative ideas applied to chaos, and which moreover shows at the head, or origin of it, the seldom-mentioned and exceedingly sacred god Io, as the origin of all things.

A woman is always affected at the same stage of each moon, the time of her affliction does not vary." Another native, an old woman, said to me :?" Women always paheke at the same time, at the same stage of each moon. Hence, when it com mences, they always know what night of the moon it is. (Natives reckoned time by the nights of the moon, and the lunar month.) Women do not paheke during the dark nights of the moon, nor yet while suckling a child, although the child may suckle its mother for a long time. When the moon appears the skin of women who have a bad time during menstruation becomes affected. " Ka hinawanatva kotoa te kiri o te wahine mate kino, e ka puta mai te mar ama," i.e., the skin becomes rough, like unto what we term " gooseflesh," in cases of dysmenorrhcea. When the moon appears, then women say :? " The tane (husband) of all women in the world has appeared." Another native, an old man, said :?" The moon is the permanent husband (or true husband) of all women, because women paheke when the moon appears. According to the knowledge of our ances tors and elders, the marriage of man and wife is a matter of no moment, the moon is the real husband." The above is a very singular belief, the supposed connection between the moon and women, but it does not seem unnatural to the Maori mind, deeply inbued as it is with the spirit of animism common to primitive peoples. For his strange mentality had vivified the moon and endowed it with sex and human passions. Moreover, the heavenly bodies and man were equally descendants of primal chaos, through Eangi and Papa, were derived from the same proto type, an anthropomorphic personification of the origin, or beginning, of all things?the Void whence were evolved Light, Sound, Water, Fire, and matter organic and inorganic. In a sense, therefore, the Maori looked upon the moon as a relative and ancestor of his own ; and the Maori ever turned to the spirits of his ancestors to save him from evil. The moon is said to have had two wives, Eona and Tangaroa-a-roto, both daughters of Tangaroa, who was originally a a land deity. There was, and still is, a certain amount of tapu connected with the menstrual discharge, though that tapu scarcely seems to apply to the woman herself, except in the sense of " uncleanliness." The discharge is viewed as a sort of human embryo, an immature or undeveloped human being, hence the tapu. " E ahua tangata ana te paheke o te wahine. He whakatipu tangata taua mea" (The paheke of a woman is a sort of human being, it is a person in embryo.) Another aged authority states :?" The menses is a kind of human</page><page sequence="9">212 JOURNAL OF THE POLYNESIAN SOCIETY being, because if the discharge ceases, then it grows into a person, that is when the paheke ceases to come away, then it assumes human form, and grows into a man." In native legends there are several instances of the development of the menstrual discharge into a human being. Such were generally developed after having been cast away by the woman, by means of the care and nurture bestowed upon them by supernatural beings, as in the cases of Maui-potiki and Whakatau, famous heroes of Maori tradition. It wrould also appear, according to some of these old-time folk tales, that the menstrual discharge sometimes developed into a caco-d mon, a malignant spirit which afflicted man grievously, and was termed an atua kahu or kahukahu, a name also bestowed upon the malignant spirit of a stillborn child. However, my chief authority among the Tuhoe tribe states that these atua kahu were the spirits of stillborn children only, whereas the paheke possessed no luairua* (spirit) ; that is to say, the menstrual discharge is not endowed with the spirit of life, the spirit which animates man, leaves his body at death and descends to Hades. But a stillborn child does possess this spirit, and it is liable to resolve itself into a most mischievous demon, as we shall see anon. On account of the above-described feeling in regard to the paheke, or menses, the sleeping places, &amp;c, of women were looked upon as being unclean and hence dangerous to man, who is tapu. Such places are to be avoided by all men of standing, although they might not be harmful to a common, tapu-\ess person, such as a slave. Should a man sit down, or recline on a place were women sleep, or rest, or should he utilise an article of female wearing apparel as a pillow, he will be polluted thereby, his tapu, the sacred spiritual and intellectual ichor which pervades, vivifies, and preserves him, will be contaminated by contact with " uncleanness," and hence his spiritual, physical, and intellectual wTell-being will be seriously affected and endangered. He would become kahupotia. The terms kahupo and hinapo signify " dim-sighted." Not that his ordinary sight will be affected, that kind of dim-sightedness is termed m?t?po, but his spiritual sight will suffer, that is to say, he will lose his power of second sight, a most serious affliction to the Maori, and one which would have seriously endangered his life in pre-Buropean days. In this state he would no longer be able to observe the numerous signs, tokens, by which ancestral gods warn their living descendants of impending troubles and dangers. An old warlock of Ngati-Awa said to me :?" Son ! Never recline on the resting places of woman, such * See Journal of the Polynesian Society, Vol. 9, p. 177, for an account of the wairua of man.</page><page sequence="10">THE LORE OF THE WHARE-KOHANGA 213 places are unclean. The blood (i.e., paheke) of woman is there. They are the undoing of man. But should you happen to do so, then be sure that you conciliate your ancestors, that they may restore your sight, and continue to guard and preserve you from evil." A man would perform the whakaepa rite in order to free himself from the polluting effects of the moenga toto, or unclean sleeping place. Begarding unnatural discharges, a peculiar case was mentioned to me by the Bua-tahuna natives. A woman of the Hamua clan has a discharge of blood from the nose at each appearance (kohititanga) of the new moon. This is termed her menses by the natives, inasmuch as the ordinary discharge is invariably absent. The material used here, in Tuhoeland, from time immemorial, as a menstruating cloth, is a variety of moss (generic term rimurirmi) known as angiangi. It is probably Hypnum clandestinus. It is a light coloured, fine, very soft moss, found growing on logs in the forest. As used for the above purpose, it is termed a kope. It is not prepared in any way, but simply crumpled up and thrust into the vagina. After the discharge has ceased, the woman will go off into the forest and there bury the kope, each woman has a secret place where she does so. It would be a serious matter for her were her kope to be seen by anyone. For they would probably make a great joke of it, and she would feel terribly humiliated, so much so, indeed, that she might commit suicide. In cases of difficult, or painful menstruation, the woman was usually isolated in former times. In native opinion it is the moon that is affecting a woman in this plight. A stoppage of the menses, which does not seem to often occur among Maoris, though perhaps it it is more frequent among half-breeds, is spoken of as " he mate kino na te mar ama" an evil complaint caused by the moon. Such an illness may continue for a week, during which time the woman will take but little food. At such a time women have a great desire to drink cold water, but are not allowed to take much, lest it should aggravate the trouble. Those who are not ill during menstruation are allowed to eat any kind of food, there is no restriction whatever. They also bath in cold water at such times, should they desire to do so. It does not appear that woman herself is looked upon as being " unclean " during the period of menstruation, although the discharge is so viewed, indeed the latter is very polluting in its action, as we have seen. Women perform their ordinary duties at such times, as cooking food, etc. There is no recognised rule or custom regarding copulation during the period of menstruation. The women seem to please themselves in the matter, some indulge while others do not.</page><page sequence="11">214 JOURNAL OF THE POLYNESIAN SOCIETY Now, the term paheke has, strictly speaking, three applications. It is the name of the discharge, it is the verb " to menstruate," and it is also applied to the period of menstruation or, more properly speaking, to the first day thereof. The term koero is applied to the second and third day of such period. When a woman does not desire to conceive, she will not copulate during menstruation or, rather, during the koerotanga (koero stage) of such period, for such a connection, she believes, would surely be fruitful. But she will abstain until three days after menstruation has ceased. Thus, according to native ideas, it is during the koero stage (and immedi ately after it) that the sexual act is fruitful. " He eke koero tena, ka tupu tomi ahi he iangata "?that is, a koero copulation, it will surely be fruitful?said my informant. If a woman does not desire to conceive, and her husband wishes to have connection with her during the koero stage of menstruation, she will say : " Kaore au e pai kia mahia koerotia ahau e koe, he hoha noku ki te whanau tamariki "?I am not willing that you should have a koero connection with me ; it is so tiresome to me to bear children. Copulation is desired mostly by women just prior to menstruation. It is said by natives that a girl will not conceive at her first, nor yet her second, menstruating period, but that she will at the third. The natives of the Tuhoe tribe state that their women have more trouble in menstruation of late years than they had formerly. Difficult or painful menstruation was very rare in former times ; it is much more common now. Possibly this may be connected with the increasing lack of fecundity so noticeable among these tribes. Native women are generally affected by a slight headache a day or so before menstruation commences. (These notes have been collected from the Tuhoe or Urewera tribe only : hence there is necessarily much Maori birth lore, &amp;c, not included in them. Cus toms, rites, &amp;c, differ to a certain extent among the various native tribes of New Zealand.) The stoppage of the menses is termed papuni. To cure this a woman will, at dawn of day, go and bathe in a stream, and then on her return she takes a dose of a decoction made as follows : Four pieces of flax root (i.e., the native flax, phormium tenax, the harakeke of the Maori) and four pieces of the branchlets of a forest climbing plant known as aka taramoa are cut up into small pieces- and boiled in a vessel until the liquid is considerably reduced in quantity. This delightful beverage is said to be effective in cases of difficult mens truation. When obtaining these roots and twigs for the above medicine, they must be taken from the east side of the flax clump and creeper, as the mana, or virtue, of them is on that side only as</page><page sequence="12">THE LORE OF THE WHARE-KOHANGA 215 regards their use as medicine for menstruating women. This singular superstition may be connected with the rising of the moon in the east. For when the same materials are being procured for the purpose of making a medicine for diarrhoea or constipation, it does not matter from which side they are taken. Another decoction used as a medicine in cases of difficult mens truation is made in a similar manner from the bark and berries of the rohutu tree (myrtus pedunculata). It is, however, very improbable that these " medicines " were used in olden times, but have only come into use since the advent of Europeans. The natives do not appear to have used internal medicines in ancient times, or certainly but to a very limited extent. Some singular beliefs obtain among the natives in regard to menstruation. If a menstruating woman goes on to a sea beach where the pipi shellfish (cockles) are found, all those shellfish wdll desert that beach and migrate to pastures new. Or if such woman essays to cook the kernels of the berries of the taw a tree (nesodaphne tawa) in a boiling spring, they will never be cooked, but remain quite hard, although those of other women not so afflicted will be quite cooked. Or if a menstruating woman goes to an ahi titi (a fire made to attract the titi, or mutton birds, and at which they were formerly taken in great numbers), no birds will be caught. For the birds will persistently avoid the fire, and will be heard crying out and screech ing. Then the fowlers will know that a menstruating woman is among them. They will know it from the actions and cries of the birds. In former times women were not allowed to take part i ri the cultivation of the hue (gourd plant), because it was believed that if a menstruating woman went among the plants, they would surely die. As few natives know their ages, it is not easy to say at what age menstruation commences, but, so far as I can judge, probably at about the fourteenth year?perhaps the fifteenth in some cases. It may, however, occur earlier. (To be continued.) 17</page></plain_text>
