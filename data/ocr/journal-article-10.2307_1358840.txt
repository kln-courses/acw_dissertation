<plain_text><page sequence="1">P 0 R T R A I T S ANA MENDIETA "Pain of Cuba, body I am By Kaira M. Cabafias ropic Ana,' as she liked to be called, was born in Havana, Cuba, in 1948, into an aristocratic family that had played a significant role in that nation's history. Like many Cubans in the late 1950s, the Mendieta family originally support- ed Castro's struggle against Batista's rule. However, once he was in power, the rumors of Castro's communist identification were confirmed, and Ana's father, Ignacio, quickly broke with Fidel and engaged in counterrevolutionary activity.2 Ignacio Mendieta's involvement in the Bay of Pigs led to his 18-year confinement in one of Cuba's political prisons. As the Mendieta family grew increasingly concerned over the future of their country, they decided to send their children to the United States under the auspices of Operation Peter Pan.3 On September 11, 1961, Ana, 12, and her sister Raquel, 15, arrived at Miami International Airport, but unlike many of the other chil- dren sent to the United States, the Mendieta sisters had no family there. After spending their first few weeks in refugee camps, they were sent to Dubuque, Iowa, where they moved from orphanage to foster home to orphanage. In the Midwest, the girls experienced not only a new environ- ment but a new sense of difference, compounded during their adolescence by the intense racial climate during the Civil Rights Movement. Although their skin was "white," Ana and Raquel be- came targets of racism. During high school in the late 1960s, their classmates called Ana "nigger" and told her, "Go back to Cuba, you whore. "4 These experiences exacerbated their feelings of alienation and displacement, and, accordingly, both women later began identifying themselves as "non-white."5 The girls were reunited with their mother, Raquel, and younger brother, Ignacio, in January 1966, but it was not until 1979 that their father was able to join the family, now settled in Cedar Rapids. Ana had developed an interest in painting and stud- ied at the University of Iowa, receiving a B.A. in art in 1969 and an M.A. in painting in 1972. Soon after, though, she gave up painting because "it wasn't real enough.""As she later explained, "The turn- ing point in my art was in 1972 when I realized my paintings were not real enough for what I wanted the image to convey-and by real I mean I wanted my images to have power, to be magic."'7 Mendieta enrolled in Iowa's more experimental, multimedia M.F.A. program, where she was exposed to such visiting artists as Robert Wilson, Vito Accioni, and Nam June Paik. Their emphasis on process and the body and the relationship between artwork and viewer contributed to the redirection of Mendieta's style. Photog- raphy and video also became integral components in documenting her increasingly ephemeral works. In the climate of the 1970s, feminism, performance, earth- works, and video all found a place in Mendieta's work. The exten- sion of her art into real time and space positioned it in "a web of references, not necessarily located in only one form, medium, or site."s This makes it difficult to analyze her work, which is situated between media. Nevertheless, a key to its understanding is found ini the following poem (c. 1981): Pain of Cuba body I am my orphanhood I live In Cuba when you die the earth that covers us speaks. But here, covered by the earth whose prisoner I am I feel death palpitating underneath the earth. And so, As my whole body is filled with want of Cuba I go on to make my work upon the earth, to go on is victory.' Mendieta gave form to the pain of exile and established a feel- ing of connectedness. "Pain of Cuba, body I am" is the individual- collective body of Ana Mendieta as she communicates her person- al experience and critiques the inherited social relations where women and ethnic Others are viewed as objects. In 1973, Mendieta was found bent over naked, tied to a table and covered with blood, her apartment in disarray. This staged presentation of the aftermath of violent rape was her response to a series of rapes on campus. Mendieta recalled: "When a young stu- dent at the University of Iowa was found murdered after having been brutally raped...I started doing performances as well as plac- ing objects and installations in public places in order to bring at- tention to this crime and all sexual violence.""' The audience for Mendieta's performance, postnamed Rape- Murder, was composed of students from the M.F.A. program whom she had invited to her apartment. Her body was the subject and object of the work. She used it to emphasize the societal con- ditions by which the female body is colonized as the object of male desire and ravaged under masculine aggression. Mendieta's corpo- real presence demanded the recognition of a female subject. The previously invisible, unnamed victim of rape gained an identity. The audience was forced to reflect on its responsibility; its empa- thy was elicited and translated to the space of awareness in which sexual violence could be addressed. Sweating Blood, a video performance, also from 1973, depicts Mendieta with her eyes closed in a trancelike state. Blood rises to the surface of her skin, then slowly collects and drips down her forehead. Her body here represents an affirmation of self as sub- ject. In addition, the "association of video with television, together with television's social function as the most popular source and in- terpreter of information and entertainment," underscores how representations are used to construct the female body as an object." Thus, Mendieta attempts to decenter the cultural hege- mony of dominant representations. Mendieta's early use of blood, citing its power, locates works such as Sweating Blood within her interest and belief in Santeria, SWOMAN'S ART JOURNAL</page><page sequence="2">an Afro-Cuban religion that attributes blood with ashe: power or life force.12 Mendieta's trancelike state in Sweat- ing Blood resembles a state of posses- sion common to Santeria practice. Mendieta claimed connection with the "goddess of sweetwater,"'3 the Oricha Ochun in the Santeria pan- theon. Ochun, a symbol of female sex- uality, owns the rivers and rules the blood, and it is from her that the say- ing "The blood that runs through the veins" is derived." By linking herself to and perhaps being possessed by Ochun, Mendieta presented a female subject in control of her own repre- sentation and sexuality. In her February 1974 performance, Blood Writing, Mendieta dipped her arms in blood and wrote "SHE GOT LOVE" on a white gallery wall, elicit- ing associations with sexual violence. "She" is denied agency by the verb "got," thus becoming the object of "love," here an aggressive and unidi- rectional attack. The sentence, when juxtaposed to Mendieta's actual body, drew attention to the artist as subject. Blood Writing also may have been related to events in Mendieta's family. Only months before the performance, she had become aware of vio- lence in her sister's home that had led to her divorce in Decem- ber 1973.15 The circumstances paralleled Mendieta's perfor- mance: marriage, conceived as a bond of mutual and reciprocal love, becomes bondage when fe- male subjectivity is denied and "she" becomes the object of mas- culine aggression. A related work, Body Tracks (Fig. 1), was performed (and filmed) for the first time in March 1974.16 Here Mendieta, dipping her arms in blood and then drag- ging them down a white wall from a standing to a kneeling position, became a "living brush." The ac- tion recalls Yves Klein's 1958 An- thropometries, in which he used the female body, overpainted with IKB blue, to make images at his direction. In contrast, Body Tracks is Mendieta making art with her own body, critiquing an art world directed by men. Afro- Cuban drums can be heard in the background of the Body Tracks performance, the music under- scoring Mendieta's conception of herself as "colored."`' Music is an Fig. 1.

These features are preserved in Santeria, where "music, particularly rendered on the sacred bata drums, serves as a critical organizing aspect of most ritu- als and ceremonies." 18 The Santeria aspects of Body Tracks and Sweating Blood present an overlap and contingency between Mendieta's concern for the condition of women and ethnic Others. The practice of Santeria in the United States provides an infrastructure to a community of refugees-ashe in a struggle for survival in a dominant so- cial order where exiled Cubans' expe- riences are subsumed, their practices misunderstood. A "disturbing" Cuban ritual witnessed in Miami was de- scribed in a 1981 Newsweek article: Two white robed women stood on a river bank, softly chanting as a third woman rubbed a chicken over her naked body, slaughtered it and threw its remains into the river's current.'9 For Mendieta such practices com- municated a critique of the ob- jectification of ethnic Others and conveyed her emotional need to identify with an exiled community. During Bird Transformation (1972) at Old Man's Creek in Iowa City, Mendieta rubbed her- self with blood and rolled in white feathers, transforming her- self into the Santero sacrificial white cock. In a similar film piece, she stood naked holding a sacrificial chicken whose contin- ued movements spilled blood on her. The act of sacrifice is inte- gral to Santeria initiation rites, and Mendieta communicates the pain of exile and displacement in these ritual performances. Like the uprooted Santeros whose rit- uals reconstitute ties to the com- munity, Mendieta, in a shared bodily experience of ritual, places herself in a community that helps her feel whole. Ritual also expresses how cul- ture is written on the body. Mendieta draws attention to her own body as a locus for cultural experience. As the viewer is con- fronted with an enigmatic ritual, SPRING / SUMMER 1999</page><page sequence="3">Fig. 3. Ana Mendieta, Incantaci6n a Olukun-Yemay6 (1977), earth and body work, Oaxaca, Mexico.

Mendieta's performances deny the "con- cept of a monotone meltdown pot," in which it is assumed every- one would end up white."20 While her skin may be white, her cul- tural experience is not. Mendieta's body is both the subject and object of her perfor- mance; her bodily presence demands the recognition of a subject as she makes visible the violence and images that contribute to women's subjugation. Mendieta brought attention to the rarely discussed issue of sexual violence; her body in performance was a bridge that altered the subject-object relations of knowing. During the mid-70s, Mendieta moved from the direct presen- tation of her body to a more focused search for identity and con- nectedness. The Silueta Series (1973-80) began with her 1973 visit to Mexico with the University of Iowa's Summer Program, during which she rediscovered her Latin roots: "Plugging into Mexico was like going back to the source, being able to get some magic just by being there.""1 Mendieta's first Silueta was performed in an an- cient Zapotec tomb in Oaxaca that year. She lay down in the grave site, surrounded by flowers that seemed to grow out of her body, an image reminiscent of Frida Kahlo's Roots (1943; Private Collec- tion). For Mendieta, "the analogy was that I was covered by time and history."22 The Silueta Series, at 200 Mendieta's largest, encompassed rit- ual processes in which the artist placed her body in communion with various landscapes (Fig. 2). In each piece she left an imprint of the silhouette of her body on the land and documented the process with both still photographs and film. Mendieta said that she "felt best when the creative process was physical.... When the whole body is part of a piece I feel one."23 With her Siluetas Mendieta conflated land with home. Such a personal mark on the land represented a mythic whole in Mendi- eta's attempt to reconstitute ties to her home and assuage the pain of exile. "[I was] trying to find a place in the earth and trying to define myself," she explained.24 When she stepped away from the work, the feeling of displacement reasserted itself. While the Silueta Series represented Mendieta's continued search for identi- ty and belonging in the split experience of exile, her incorporation of Santeria practices embodied a community of experience of exile and ethnic Other. One aspect of outdoor Santeria ritual practice is described as going "monte adentro." One searches for a monte, uncultivated land, on which to perform a ceremony, and adentro means to go inside. Monte adentro thus signifies "going back to the roots,"" a kind of spiritual meditation. Mendieta described it: "There are many places I have gone to time and time again just because I feel connected to them...when I find a site I have things to do there, work rituals."26 The title of Incantaci6n a Olokun-Yemayd (1977; Fig. 3), from the Silueta Series, reveals its dedication to a Santeria Oricha, or goddess. This silhouette, created and photographed in Oaxaca, doc- uments the imprint of Mendieta's body in the sand and is surround- ed by the shape of a hand. The work represents a metaphorical re- turn home; it expresses the need for her body to join the land where she came from in order to establish a connection: I came from a tropical country and I have a picture of myself, seven months old, crawling around on the sandy beach. We had a house there, and I would be outside from 7:30 a.m. to 2:00 in the after- noon... out in the water and the sand. I learned about my body from doing that. Now I continue to use my body to communicate with the world.27 Interestingly, the goddess Olokun-Yemayai is invoked if one wants a child or needs a home." Yemaydi is the owner of the sea and is syncretized with the Vir- gin Regla, the protector of Havana Bay. In an untitled Silueta from 1980 (Fig. 4), execut- ed in Iowa, Mendieta cov- ered her silhouette with gunpowder and set it on fire, which she later dis- covered evoked a Santeria practice. "Later I found out that in certain rituals the Santeros make five piles of gunpowder, light them, and if they burn, it means yes to a question, and if it does not burn it means no."29 This image, when pub- lished in Heresies, was ac- companied by a text in which Mendieta described the legend of the Black Venus as an anti-slavery symbol representing the "affirmation of a free and natural being who refused to be colonized."" The im- age is thereby activated by Mendieta's text and rein- forces the personal and so- cial nexus of her body. The legend of the Black Venus presents a contem- porary metaphor for the continued oppression of women and ethnic Others. Each Silueta contains Fig. 4.

" Further, the Silueta Series expands the vocabulary of earthworks' engagement with the land. Working with and within the forces of nature, Mendieta recreated her form on an intimate, personal scale: "I'm five feet tall so I... measure things with my body. I started doing imprints to place myself and my body in the world."2' (In contrast, Michael Heizer's power-laden 1969 Double Negative displaced 24,000 tons of earth in a forceful attempt at the communion of man and the universe.) One of Mendieta's few extant Siluetas was formed on a tree in Miami. The tree and its location had special meaning to Mendieta: The Santeros use a tree that in Spanish is called Ceiba and in Eng- lish is called a cotton silkwood tree. It has very long roots that stick out. In Miami there is a tree like that which the Santeros have claimed, and the people do things to that tree when a healer tells them that they have to make a sacrifice. When I was there I decided to do a piece on the tree. I was in the Cuban section and collected human hair from the different beauty shops so I knew that it was Cuban hair. Then I made an image of a figure on the tree. A root was sticking out so the figure appeared to be either male or female being screwed. There were also three knots on it that happened to look like female genitalia so I surrounded them with hair that I glued on.... The last time I saw the tree, people had added coconuts, chicken wings, all kinds of offerings. For a while they put a figure of Santa Barbara underneath it, cut an opening in what would be the face and stuck a shell in the mouth. They have really activated the image and claimed it as their own.w" Here is an example of how "personal associations, education, political and environmental contexts, class and ethnic background...all exert pressures on the interaction between eye, mind, and image.":3 The work is located in the gap between artist and culture and reinforces the dialogic character of this space in the production of meaning. After completing her M.F.A. in 1978, Mendieta moved to New York City, working as a waitress to help pay the rent. The follow- ing year the documentation of her Silueta Series was exhibited at the A.I.R. Gallery, a woman's cooperative. Like many artists in the 1970s seeking to work outside the commercial art gallery system, Mendieta had only these photographs as evidence of her work. The year 1980 marked a turning point in Mendieta's life: She was awarded Guggenheim and NEA grants, and, with an invitation from the Cuban government, she fulfilled her long-awaited desire to return to her homeland. She recalled: I was afraid before I went there because I felt I've been living my life with this obsessive thing in my mind-what if I find out it has nothing to do with me? But the minute I got there, it was this whole thing of belonging again." In August 1981, at Janlco State Park, Havana, she began the Ru- pestrian sculpture series, which she described as taking the Silueta Series "to its source."''"i Moving away from reference to her oewn body, she explored the goddess imagery of the Taino, the indige- nous inhabitants of the Antilles. She carved the forms into the limestone rock formations at the park, and for the first time used paint to bring out the outlines of her carvings, thereby establishing a "connection with the regions native inhabitants whose cave paint- ings are some of the scant remaining evidence of their existence."3' Mendieta sought to emphasize the legacy of cultural domina- Fig. 5.

In preparing a book of twelve photo-etchings of the work, she wrote: Few people have had a destiny as cruel as the Tainan which in 1492 greeted Christopher Columbus in their islands. In a matter of a few years due to the inequality of weapons, over- powered by hunger, sickness and hard labor and stripped of their national identity, the few survivors were rapidly assimilated by the conquistadors. From that tragic event little has been saved. So it follows as a Cuban American and cultural inheritor of the Tainan culture I want to make a small publication, a collaboration you might say between them and I." The images were given Tainan goddess names: Guabancex (God- dess of the Wind) (Fig. 5), its oval shapes and graceful curves working with the natural form of the cave, Guanaroca (First Woman), and Atabey (Mother of the Waters), for example. The photographic documentation of the Rupestrian Series was exhibit- ed at A.I.R. gallery in November 1981. Lucy Lippard defined essentialist feminism of the 1970s and 1980s as based on the "belief in a female essence residing some- where in the body of women," with an emphasis on "body identifi- cation and biologically derived forms" to communicate the female experience.":' Thus, according to Gloria Orenstein, essentialists posit an "intuitive-body knowledge";"' their art encourages the glo- rification of women. The search for a female mythology and iconography in prehistoric matriarchies also resulted in the image of the Great Goddess as a symbol for female awakening. Because of her use of earth and body, Mendieta's Silueta and Rupestrian series often are considered essentialist, although this categorization limits the understanding of this work. The Siluetas are grounded in Mendieta's feelings of displacement and in Sante- ria and are not a call for a return to a matriarchal order. Although deeply associated with the earth and nature, Santeria is holistic in its belief in the universal energy running through all beings, mat- ter, space, and time. The 1970s feminist identification with the Great Goddess posits that "women see themselves as the Great Goddess," and SPRING / SUMMER 1999</page><page sequence="5">that woman is transformed "into the virtual incarnation of the Earth Goddess" as a source of empowerment.41 The emphasis in Santeria, however, is on a pantheon of gods and goddesses who are owners of the landscape. Mendieta herself asserts, "I believe in water, air, and earth. They are all deities."42 The image of the Silueta and the personal and cultural content that informs the se- ries thereby illustrates ideas about how "images actively operate in the gaps between known cultures and contribute in sometimes in- direct ways to expose barriers between them."43 Although Mendieta's Rupestrian Series may be linked to essen- tialist feminism because it incorporates universal fertility goddess forms, the work nevertheless pays homage to a decimated culture. The use of essentialist language to evaluate her work duplicates the fixity of patriarchal categories; it demonstrates how "society will impose a certain selection and priority of meaning upon the multiplicity of meaning inherent in a given situation."44 Mendieta's retrieval of the female body form became a metaphor for the retrieval of Cuba from colonization. She ex- pressed her continued feelings of difference and dislocation in the introduction to Dialectics of Isolation: Exhibition of Third World Women Artists of the United States (1980): During the mid to late 60s as women in the United States politicized themselves and came together in the Feminist Movement with the purpose to end domination and exploitation by the white male cul- ture, they failed to remember us. American feminism as it stands is basically a white middle class movement.45 The white population of the United States, diverse, but of basic European stock, exterminated and put aside the Black as well as the other non-white cultures to create a homogenous male-dominated society above the internal divergency.46 Mendieta affirmed her critical position vis-a-vis the historical legacy of domination and oppression that denies women and ethnic Others their experiences. Her words do not convey a biological de- terminism that unites all women but rather emphasize the different sociocultural circumstance of her body. Inscribing Mendieta's art with the fixed language of essentialist feminism impoverishes its meaning, or in their appropriation of Mendieta, essentialist femi- nists' colonize the work and consequently whiten its content. In 1983 Mendieta was awarded a year-long fellowship at the American Academy in Rome.47 In this new environment her work changed form. Working indoors, in her first studio, she continued to use natural materials, combining sand, earth, and binder to make earth relief sculpture, later carving and burning freestanding tree trunks with gunpowder to reveal anthropomorphic imagery. Although she was creating objects, Mendieta maintained a con- ceptual continuity through her use of natural elements and tools. On her return to the United States Mendieta married Minimal- ist sculptor Carl Andre. She continued to make her home between New York and Rome for several months, until, on September 8, 1985, Ana Mendieta met an untimely death. Her fall from the 34th story window of the apartment she shared with her husband caused substantial media attention.48 Her life ended, but her work survives as testimony to her personal search and critical reflection on the human condition. Mendieta reflected on her feeling of difference as an adoles- cent in the United States: "When I finally learned the language and talked to other people, I found that we would look at the same event, talk about it and would see it totally differently."49 Her art pleads with the viewer to perceive differently. Her search for both identity and connection parallels her search for meaning. While appreciating the beauty of her work, one must gaze not only on "the familiarities and unfamiliarities, on the neutral and the exotic" but on the area between, "that fertile, liminal ground where new meanings germinate."'5 Mendieta's focus on the body as both subject and object alters the subject-object social relations of knowing. She positioned her- self, a female and ethnic Other, as a subject and recognized the contingency between the individual body and the social body; her art takes us across the borders of individual and social, self and Other, subject and object. Mendieta critiques the historical legacy of patriarchal ideology that controls women and ethnic Others through its binary social positioning. "Pain of Cuba, body I am" embodies the experience of Ana Mendieta. A Cuban-American, her experience of exile is embod- ied in the space between."5 This space between, where Mendieta's body is located, is a space for the renegotiation of concepts, social relations, and the production of meaning. It is a critical space, a fluid space, and a multiple space. It is a space of possibilities, a space of education and learning. "The interesting thing," said Mendieta, "is that education is about un-educating yourself."52* NOTES I thank Dr. Kristine Stiles and Amy Vickers for their guidance and support during the formation of this text.
