<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE EFFECT OF THE NEW SCIENCE UPON THE THOUGHT OF JONATHAN EDWARDS THEODORE HORNBERGER The Henry E. Huntington Library SOME YEARS ago, Mr. Clarence H. Faust reviewed in these pages the evidence of Jonathan Edwards's early interest in science, reaching the conclusion that from the first Edwards's pow- ers were dedicated to theology rather than to science. No quarrel with this judgment is intended in the present article, which seeks rather to present proof that Edwards's metaphysics, and hence his theology, were markedly influenced by the new science, however subordinate science may have been in the mind of the theologian. The suggestion of such influence is not new, but heretofore, so far as is known to the present writer, no one has troubled to demon- strate it, even though it appears to be the thread that unravels much that is difficult to understand in Edwards's intellectual outlook. The constant factor in Edwards's thinking is probably, as most commentators say, subjective idealism, whether derived from some- one like Berkeley or arrived at independently. That philosophy was in the air when Edwards was a youth, and it was attractive to the theologically-minded because it appeared to be a great support to religion. Berkeley, we are told, developed his metaphysics for fear and hate of the materialistic tendencies of the followers of Locke and Newton; Edwards's famous essay "Of Being" concludes with the statement that "those who think material things the most substantial beings, and spirits more like a shadow" are making a "gross mistake." The same essay asserts without equivocation that "Space is God," and that the universe "exists no where, but in the Divine mind." These are concepts so similar to those of Maleo branche, Norris, and Berkeley that it is fairly safe to conclude that x"lonathan Edwards as a Scientist," American Literature, I, 393-404 (lan., x93o).

This edition is cited hereinafter as Works.</page><page sequence="2">Edwards and Science 197 Edwards, like those philosophers, was primarily anxious to save God and spirit and religion from the scientific glorification of matter. It is significant that the essay "Of Being" was a part of the manuscript "Notes on Natural Science," begun, together with the parallel notes on "The Mind," when Edwards was an undergradu- ate. These notebooks reveal much speculation that is scientific in spirit, from the rule: "Always, when I have occasion, to make use of mathematical proofs,'' to the assertion that the principles laid down in the essay, "Of Being," do not "make void Natural Phi- losophy, or the science of the Causes or Reasons of corporeal changes; For to find out the reasons of things in Natural Philos- ophy, is only to find out the proportion of God's acting.'' There are many notes, moreover, called "things to be considered, or writ- ten fully about," which show Edwards's wide though somewhat uneven reading in the sciences. In optics and astronomy, particu- larly, he was much interested, and his comments indicate his awareness of important problems in these fields. In other subjects, such as physiology and geology, he was still using the dialect of the ancient and medieval philosophers. Some of the things he set down for consideration were these: 11. To show, from Sir Isaac Newton's principles of light and colours, why the sky is blue; . . . why the Sun is yellow, when rising and setting, and sometimes, in smoky weather, of a blood red; why the Clouds, and the Atmosphere, near the horizon, appear red and yellow, before sun- rising, and after sun-setting; why distant Mountains are blue, etc. 4. To know the shape of the Spheroid of the Universe, by observa- tion of the Milky Way; and to know whereabout our System is in it; Ist, with respect to the plane of the greatest circles, from observations of the ratio of the brightness of the opposite sides compounded with several other ratios.-2d. With respect to the latitude, or the axis of this Spheroid, by observing how much the Milky Way differs from a great circle .... It is not probable that, when the parts of the body are touched, the Animal Spirits, that were in those parts of the nerves, go quite to the brain before the soul perceives, but that motion is continued to the brain, in the tubes that contain the animal spirits, as motion in a tube filled with water. If the water at one end moves never so little, the motion is continued quite to the other end; or as the motion, given to Works, I, 703. Ibid., I, 669.</page><page sequence="3">198 American Literature the blood in the Arteries, by the pulse of the heart, is communicated all over the body . . . . 45. To observe, it is somewhat difficult to know, how it comes to pass, that there are, in all Continents, however uneven and confused, hilly and jumbled, though they seem to have mountains and vallies, in- differently, and undesignedly, every where dispersed; yet, that there are such convenient Channels, whereby water may be conveyed from the middle of the Continents, and from all parts, into the Ocean. The reason is, when the world was first created, the water covering all the earth, the surface of the earth must needs be very soft, and loose, and easily worn or altered, by the motions of the water; and afterwards, the water, retiring in such a vast body, into one place, from off the conti- nents, and some places of the (continents, being higher, and others lower, some were easily worn, others more difficult; in some places, the waters moving with more force, in others with less, some places would neces- sarily be worn deeper than others, from the middle of the continent to the ocean; and as the water decreased, as going off from the earth, all would retire into those channels: and, the water still decreasing, the re- mainder would run in the deeper places of these channels; and after they (the waters) were gone, they left channels everywhere; into which, the waters afterwards gushing out, in various parts of the continent, would naturally-find their way. Thus, also, after the Deluge, when the surface of the earth was again loosened. Thus Edwards turned occasionally to scientific hypotheses, and even, more rarely, to direct observation and experiment. Even in these college notes, however, the dominant tone is the theological, and the more typical comments are such as these: To show how Infinite Wisdom must be exercised, in order that Gravity and Motion may be perfectly harmonious; and that, although the jumble of the Epicureans be allowed, although it be, in fact, im- possible .... To bring in an observation, somewhere in the proper place, that-in- stead of Hobbes' notion, that God is matter, and that all substance is matter-that nothing, that is matter, can possibly be God; and that no matter is, in the most proper sense, matter, . . . To observe that, if bodies have no substance of their own, so neither is solidity, strictly speaking, a property belonging to body, and to show how. And if solidity is not so, neither are the other properties of body, 7Ibid., I, 7~6-726. 8See, for example, the famous flying spider paper and his various speculations on light and color, ibid., I, 23-28, 717.</page><page sequence="4">Edwards and Science 199 which depend upon it, and are only modifications of it; so that there is neither real substance, nor property, belonging to bodies; but all that is real is immediately in the First Being. Coroll. 1. Hence see how God is said, still more properly, to be Ens entium, or, if there was noth- ing else in the world but bodies, the only Real Thing, so that it may be said, in a stricter sense than hitherto, 'Thou art, and there is none beside thee.' Coroll. 2. Hence see, that, instead of Matter being the only proper substance, and more substantial than any thing else, because it is hard and solid; yet, it is truly nothing at all, strictly and in itself con- sidered. Coroll. 3. The nearer in nature beings are to God, so much the more properly are they beings, and more substantial. And that Spirits are much more properly beings, and more substantial, than bodies. Such statements leave no room for doubt of the centrality of subjective idealism in Edwards's thinking, nor of the share of the new science in pushing him to that position. His mention of the Epicureans and of Thomas Hobbes is enough to show his fear of the materialistic implications of seventeenth-century scientific thought. It is evident that Edwards, like the other idealists of his time, was deriving from science itself a new metaphysics, and a metaphysics which permitted more fully even than Newton's the retention of God in the world. By the time he had finished college in 1720, science would seem to have definitely affected Edwards's idea of God. It was not the only influence upon his thinking, to be sure; as one of his biographers says, he had reached a conclusion, "driven thereto by the threefold suggestions of phys- ics-God is space; of philosophy-God is mind; and of religious experience-God is the source of our intuitions.'' There is every reason to believe that Edwards had reached this conclusion before he left college, and that it persisted throughout the remainder of his life, coloring his utterances upon almost every subject that he touched. Before turning to his writings, we should note that his reading list is added evidence of a mild but lifelong interest in science and 9 Ibid., I, 72I, 725-726. ~?See, for suggestions of the importance of these implications, which have not yet been fully examined, J.

His reasons for that interest, and his own peculiar subordination of science to religion, may best be seen, however, in his printed books. After leaving college, Edwards studied theology, preached for short periods in New York and Connecticut, and served for two years as a tutor at Yale. Not until 1727 was he ordained at North- ampton; not until 1731 did he publish his first sermon, God Glorified in the Work of Redemption, by the Greatness of Man's Dependence upon Him (Boston, 1731). In this and in his second printed sermon, A Divine and Supernatural Light Shown to Be Both a Scriptural and a Rational Doctrine (Boston, 1734), may be seen the first expression of the new religious vigor which was Edwards's chief contribution to New England life. He who reads these sermons today feels, as the average listener probably did in the 1730's, that there is no great break between Edwards and his predecessors. The Mathers, for instance, speak in the same dialect of the glory of God and the power of His will. On closer examination, however, a difference appears which may in part be accounted for by perceiving it as an extension of scientific and philosophical speculations. As A. V. G. Allen puts it, at a time "when the prevailing Deism represented God as if a passive agent, governing the world by general laws and second causes, as well as far removed from the scene of human activity, Edwards presented Deity as immanent and efficient will.'' In his earlier thinking Edwards had conceived of God as underlying all external phenomena. "It was God's immediate action on the mind, in ac- cordance with His fixed and stable will, which gives to the mind the idea of an external world." He now, as Allen suggests, extends this conception to the world within. "In the invisible sphere of man's moral or intellectual existence, God was still the universal substance; it was he alone that existed and there is none else.'' Looking at it from this angle, it becomes reasonable to believe that much of Edwards's theological importance comes as a result of this extension to the moral sphere of his scientific and philosophical conceptions. He gave to the old Calvinism a new idea of God. See Thomas H. Johnson, "Jonathan Edwards' Background of Reading," Publications of the Colonial Society of Massachusetts, XXVIII, I93-222 (Dec., 1931). ~alonathan Edwards (Boston and New York, x889), p. 58. X4Ibid., pp. 6o-6~.</page><page sequence="6">Edwards and Science 201 This new synthesis of science, philosophy, and theology doubt- less justified to Edwards his stirring and epoch-making preaching of the all-importance of God and the insignificance of humanity. It cannot be said, however, that his new concept of Deity shines clearly through his works, and it is probable that the majority of his hearers interpreted his words in terms of the old transcendent, anthropomorphic Deity of the Old Testament. Nor did Edwards shake himself entirely free of that conception, as may be seen in the famous Enfield sermon Sinners in the Hands of an Angry God (Boston, 1741), or in his posthumous History of the Work of Re- demption (Edinburgh, 1774), in both of which God is anything but immanent will. Throughout his life, as Professor McGiffert says, Edwards's mind passed "back and forth with no apparent jolt or difficulty from a pantheistic to a personalistic interpretation of God . . . . It seems not to have dawned on him that there is a contradiction in speaking of God as at the same time a person and an expansive substance.'' Despite his idealistic world-view, therefore, Edwards did not hesitate to make use of the familiar analogies and dialectic of Calvinism; and the great part of his work appears to the average reader to be entirely theological, utterly untouched by any specu- lation outside of Scriptural exegesis. In his significant relation to the Great Awakening, for example, there is no noticeable evidence that clearly indicates anything but a transcendent and personal Deity. His many writings about the phenomena of conversion, so interesting to the student of the psychology of religion, show no particular effect of scientific thought. The same thing may be justly said of his many sermons, which are singularly free of al- lusions or arguments based either upon science or upon his philo- sophical speculations. For the evidence that he returned to science and philosophy, we must go to the great theological works of his last years, written in exile at Stockbridge. The first of these, A Careful and Strict Enquiry into the Mod- ern Prevailing Notions of Freedom of the Will (Boston, 1754), is concerned with an old theological problem reinvigorated by the Deistic controversy. As Paul Elmer More states it, Edwards's book represents the Calvinist angle of a triangular controversy with the Deists and the Arminians over the place of evil in the uni- A. C. McGiffert, op. cit., p. 181.</page><page sequence="7">202 American Literature verse. At first glance nothing would seem to be further from the realm of science. One needs, however, to follow only a little of the knotty argument of the Freedom of the Will to perceive that the book is saturated with the effects of science. Full quotation would require many pages, but it could reasonably support the argument that Edwards's definition of cause and his discussion of causation, as well as his vigorous defense of moral necessity, depend in great measure upon illustrations and reasoning drawn from the new science. One example must suffice. A stock Armin- ian argument against Calvinistic determinism had been that God could hardly be concerned with the innumerable minute differ- ences visible in the world. "To which I answer," says Edwards, in a passage which exhibits both his science and his inexorable logic: it is impossible for us to determine, with any certainty or evidence, that because the difference is very small, and appears to us of no considera- tion, therefore there is absolutely no superior goodness, and no valuable end, which can be proposed by the Creator and Governor of the world, in ordering such a difference. The forementioned author mentions many instances. One is, there being one atom in the whole universe, more or less . . . . It is possible that the most minute effects of the Cre- ator's power, the smallest assignable difference between the things which God has made, may be attended, in the whole series of events, and the whole compass and extent of their influence, with very great and impor- rant consequences. If the laws of motion and gravitation, laid down by Sir Isaac Newton, hold universally, there is not one atom, nor the least assignable part of an atom, but what has influence every moment throughout the whole material universe, to cause every part to be other- wise than it would be if it were not for that particular corporeal exist- ence. And however the effect is insensible for the present, yet it may, in length of time, become great and important. To illustrate this, let us suppose two bodies moving the same way, in straight lines, perfectly parallel one to another; but to be diverted from this parallel course, and drawn one from another, as much as might be by the attraction of an atom, at the distance of one of the furthest of the fixed stars from the earth; these bodies being turned out of the lines of their parallel motion, will, by degrees, get further and further distant, one from the other; and though the distance may be imperceptible for a long time, yet at length it may become very great. So the revolution of a planet round the sun being retarded or accelerated, and the orbit of its revolution ~eThe Cambridge History of American Literature, I, 65-66 (New York, I9t7). ~v Works, II, 50-55. ~8 Ibid., II, 225-244.</page><page sequence="8">Edwards and Science 203 made greater or less, and more or less elliptical, and so its periodical time longer or shorter, no more than may be by the influence of the least atom, might, in length of time, perform a whole revolution sooner or later than otherwise it would have done; which might make a vast alteration with regard to millions of important events. So the influence of the least particle may, for aught we know, have such effect on some- thing in the constitution of some human body, as to cause another thought to arise in the mind at a certain time, than otherwise would have been; which, in length of time (yea, and that not very great) might occasion a vast alteration through the whole world of mankind. And so innumerable other ways might be mentioned, wherein the least assignable alteration may possibly be attended with great consequences. So frequent are such analogies and illustrations from science, and particularly from physics and astronomy, that one might almost argue from Edwards's writings that he believed in an un- interrupted order of nature. However, he concludes the Freedom of the Will with a view of providence which leaves room for divine interposition. Equally impregnated with the effects of science is Edwards's Great Christian Doctrine of Original Sin Defended (Boston, 1758), a book not yet off the press when he died. One passage in it particularly exemplifies the close relation of his theological ideas regarding the intellectual and moral world to his scientific notions. He is writing about his belief that a tendency to evil exists in the very nature of mankind. In all colonial literature there is perhaps no more acute analysis of the scientific method: The natural dictate of reason shews that where there is an effect there is a cause, and a cause sufficient for the effect; because if it were not sufficient, it would not be effectual; and that therefore, where there is a stated prevalence of the effect, there is a stated prevalence in the cause. A steady effect argues a steady cause. We obtain a notion of tendency, no other way than by observation: And we can observe nothing but events: And it is the commonness or constancy of events that gives us a notion of tendency in all cases. Thus we judge of tendencies in the natural world. Thus we judge of the tendencies or propensities of nature in minerals, vegetables, animals, rational and irrational creatures. A notion of a stated tendency or fixed propensity, is not obtained by ob- serving only a single event. A stated preponderation in the cause or occasion, is argued only by a stated prevalence of the effect. If a die be Ibid., II, 240-241.

How ridiculous would he make himself, who should earnestly dispute against any tendency in the state of things to cold in the winter or heat in the summer; or should stand to it, that although it often happened that water quenched fire, yet there was no tendency in it to such an effect ? That we are dealing with human nature does not alter the case, continues Edwards; "the evidence of tendency" remains the same. If there were a particular family which, from generation to generation, and through every remove to in- numerable different countries and places of abode, all died of a con- sumption, or all run distracted, or all murdered themselves, it would be as much an evidence of the tendency of something in the nature or constitution of that race, as it would be of the tendency of something in the nature or state of an individual, if some one person had lived all that time, and some remarkable event had often appeared in him, which he had been the agent or subject of from year to year and age to age, continually and without fail. In such comments as these there is abundant evidence that Edwards possessed in a degree uncommon to his age the scientific mind, which seeks always to relate particular events to general laws. The work which sums up Edwards's cosmology, however, is his Dissertation Concerning the End for Which God Created the World (Boston, 1765). Competent scholars have regarded this as his most important work, and there is reason to believe that it contains his most mature opinion of a subject which he regarded as of extreme importance. We at once face the question, there- fore, of the relation of science to this final statement of his theology. Let it be said, first of all, that the thought in this dissertation on God's end in creation marks a return (or, as some think, a devel- ~[bid., II, 321-322. ~2 Printed as Two Dissertations, with the essay on The Nature o/ True Virtue. ~*See F.

He begins with God, the eternal and infinite Being, Who, he says, "is in effect, Being in general; and comprehends universal existence.'' Although his terminology is difficult, and he is not always clear, he appears to most readers to vacillate between an anthropomorphic God the Creator, and a concept expressed by "emanation," which suggests the idea of God as universal substance. Our question becomes, consequently, that of the relation of science to Edward's idealism. Let us bring in for purposes of comparison another New Eng- land book, John Cotton's Briefe Exposition upon Ecclesiastes (London, 1654). Like Edwards's Dissertation, Cotton's book insists upon the glory of God and the insufficiency of the creature in the attainment of true happiness. Cotton's exegesis of the "Vanity of vanities; all is vanity" chapter demonstrates the unprofitableness of the study of nature as compared to the contemplation of God; Edwards states that "the whole system of created beings, in com- parison of the Creator, would be found as the light dust of the bal- ance, or even as nothing and vanity.'' And yet, despite their agreement on this point, what a vast difference there is between these two books! The material world seemed to Cotton a neat mixture of the four elements, with the earth firmly occupying the central position in the universe, demonstrating to man the transi- tory quality of his own life and the permanence of the creation. The material world seemed to Edwards to have real existence only in terms of mind or divine idea, although for practical purposes it could be conceived of as composed of innumerable dissimilar par- ticles held together by the God-revealing law of universal attraction; the earth and the solar system were to him but one of the innum- erable manifestations of the Deity, demonstrating chiefly the dom- inance of mind or spirit in the universe. Cotton and Edwards, in other words, although both Calvinists, held quite distinct meta- physical beliefs, and differed widely in their concepts of Deity. There is perhaps no way of direct proof that these differences z~I. W. Riley, op. cit., p. x8o. ~Works, III, 38. mA. C.

One need but note that Edwards's immanency permits a far more sophisticated idea of God, and leaves room for uninterrupted causation or, better yet, one need but try to conceive of Edwards's having reached the position he did without the work of Locke and Newton, to realize that there is some relation, and probably a rather close one, between science and this reinterpretation of Calvinist theology. Edwards, as much as Berkeley, is best understood as a theological product of reaction against the materialistic aspects of seventeenth-century science. Philosophically speaking, there are inconsistencies in Edwards's position of which he seems not to have been aware. He postulates, for instance, an infinite and eternal Deity, Who is, in effect, Being in general, suggesting that all substance is in some degree ema- nation of the Deity. Yet he is anxious, in his early notes on natural science, to deny an infinite universe, and insists in one of his ser- mons that "there is a certain place, a particular part of the external creation, to which Christ is gone, and where he remains. And this place is that which we call the highest heaven, or the heaven of heavens; a place beyond all the visible heavens." Likewise, from a theological standpoint, his suggestion that the creation is an emanation of the infinite and eternal Deity is contradicted by his insistence on finite and temporal bounds to that creation. These inconsistencies do not detract, however, from Edwards's achievement. His effect upon the religious life of the American people and upon the theological school which followed in his foot- steps can hardly be exaggerated. Through all his works, Allen says, there runs the common purpose of bringing back the world again to God, and in that purpose he succeeded far beyond what might have been expected. Not only is he the key to the characteristic American confidence in revivalism, but in theology, we are told, he was "the chief human instrument in turning back the current for over a century in the larger part of New England to the theory of salvation and of man's dependence on God which marked the earlier types of Calvinism.'' s~ Works, I, 704, 72I, and passim.

He succeeded in turning back for a large number of Americans and over a considerable length of time the tide of materialism to which the new science in some measure contributed. And Edwards accomplished this pious work not by attacking science, as Johnson and the Hutchinsonians tended to do, but by utilizing it, by implicit confidence that the study of natural things is "the discovery of the proportion of God's acting." From the new science, among other things, he developed a new foundation for his burning and mystical worship of God.</page></plain_text>
