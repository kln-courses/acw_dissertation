<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Hamartia of Imagination in Shelley's Cenci DONNA RICHARDSON IN his preface to The Cenci, Shelley says he adapted Beatrice Cenci's story to exploit the morally ambiguous debate it still excited in Rome, a "restless casuistry" in which "men seek the justification ofBeatrice, yet feel that she has done what needs justification."' He might find it ironic that this casuistry has also characterized interpre- tation of his play. The prefaces to his plays seem to assert a classi- cal view of tragedy according to which the protagonist's downfall is caused by a culpable refusal to recognize inevitable limitations in human nature. While describing the Romans' "restless casuistry," Shelley says of Beatrice's acts that "revenge, retaliation, and atone- ment are pernicious mistakes," implying that the audience as well as she would be "wiser and better" if they did not try to justify such acts. Moreover, the preface to Prometheus Unbound condemns as "perni- cious" a similar "casuistry" excusing Satan's faults because his wrongs "exceed all measure" (p. I33). Yet many have felt that Beatrice's crimes are offset by her nobility of character and by the wrongs done to her, not only by her father but also by a society that sanctions such patriarchal tyranny on every level. Shelley's readers, like the Romans of his time, have consequently been unable to agree upon the extent of her culpability in defending herself against institutionalized oppression. It is impossible to do jus- tice to the numerous and complex interpretations of The Cenci, but it is possible to trace a main line of development. Though interpre- tations have become increasingly sophisticated, they consistently im- ply her error does not involve the radical moral and intellectual lim- I.

Most crit- ics before 1950o rejected Shelley's preface and asserted that Beatrice is an entirely sympathetic victim of social forces.2 One exception is Carlos Baker, who accuses Beatrice of "corruption," yet also calls her an epitome of "human saintliness" whose destruction "by the con- spiracy of social circumstances and the continued oppression of a vin- dictive tyranny" is "perhaps inevitable."3 Subsequent critics have analyzed Beatrice's psychology more closely to explain how such saintliness is compatible with corruption. In one of the most influen- tial of such analyses, Milton Wilson identifies Beatrice's error as self- contempt due to her family's "fatal flaw" of rational introspection. Their obsessive "self-anatomy" over "what must be thought, and may be done" leads the Cenci to believe human nature is essentially depraved. This despair then becomes "an excuse" and "a persuasion" to indulge their darkest desires. Thus, when Beatrice is raped, she murders her father and feels justified in doing so because her self- analysis erroneously leads her to think he has irrevocably contami- nated her.4 While maintaining that Beatrice's problem is her inability to exert sufficient sympathy for herself and others, more recent interpreters have found the social evils she faces more insidious because they in- clude conceptual as well as physical and legal tyranny. Critics since the early 1970s have ascribed to Shelley various world-views, includ- ing permutations upon mythopoeia and deconstrution, in which Beatrice's errors result from the paradigm society forces upon her. Such readings imply that people are inevitably imprisoned in the ide- ologies of their era and mistake what are often (or always) subjective projections for objective realities, but that the imagination can out- grow the need for such destructive objectifications. Stuart Curran and Earl Wasserman argue that Beatrice's failure of imagination is due 2. See, for example, Newton Ivey White, Shelley, 2 vols.

Beatrice conceptualizes everything in terms of her culture's universal belief in an omnipotent divinity that protects its adherents, and only when it is too late-if at all-does she recognize the absence of any such rational system of justice in the universe.5 Applying concepts derived from Marx, Freud, and deconstruction, Jerrold E. Hogle has argued that deeper linguistic and psychological dynamics predispose Beatrice to co-optation by the ideology of her era. According to Hogle, Shelley believes a person comes to con- sciousness within a preexisting, ever-shifting context of psychologi- cal and linguistic interactions, and she can therefore only form an au- thentic identity by resisting all fixed concepts purporting to assert determinate truths. Such truths are illusions used to evade uncertainty and gain a false sense of separate identity and power over others. They should be rejected in favor of "radical transference," the open- ended impulse to "look beyond [the] self to analogies that extend, contextualize, and define it."6 Beatrice's errors of self-contempt and revenge are grounded in a perversion of this impulse in which the self seeks vindication of its desires by attributing them to some absolute Other and by then "abjecting" itself before the presumed power of this Other to define its fate. Thus Beatrice attributes more power and certainty to her father than he possesses, and unwittingly challenges 5. According to Earl Wasserman, in Shelley: A Critical Reading (Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press, 1971), Shelley rejects fictions of a reality knowable by reason for a positive belief in a metaphys- ical realm of Being knowable by imagination, and he believes human nature is essentially innocent in a metaphysical sense (p. 125). Because Beatrice "accepts the oppressive doctrine of paternal authority, di- vine and therefore human" rather than believing in her own essential innocence, her father's rape makes her feel a despairing self-contempt; she "progressively misdirects her will until she suddenly, 'impa- tiently,' resolves on revenge" (pp. 98-99). Stuart Curran, in Shelley's Cenci: Scorpions Ringed with Fire (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1970) and Shelley's Annus Mirabilis (San Marino: The Huntington Library, 1975), takes the more prevalent view that Shelley is a skeptical idealist who postu- lates no absolutes, imaginatively known or otherwise. According to Curran, Beatrice believes that re- venge is not only justified but imperative because she has lived according to a Renaissance Christianity that demands absolute retribution for evil (Shelley's Annus Mirabilis, pp. 134-35). James Rieger's analy- sis of The Cenci, in The Mutiny Within: The Heresies of Percy Bysshe Shelley (New York: George Braziller, 1967), is similar to Curran's on many points, especially in his claim that Beatrice's error is her belief in a rational, objective order (p. I19), an error which a stronger exercise of imagination could correct (p. 126), and that the audience follows her process of learning that there is no such order (pp. 118-19). Rieger appears, however, to think that she is left with an erroneous belief in a negative, evil divine or- der rather than a rejection of all objective deities (pp. I26ff). 6. Jerrold E. Hogle, Shelley's Process: Radical Transference and the Development of His Major Works (New York: Oxford University Press, 1988), pp. I4-Is5-</page><page sequence="4">Hamartia of Imagination in Shelley 219 his claim to authority by invoking the same kind of tyrannical power. Since society has embedded various forms of this perversion in its lan- guage and institutions, Beatrice can only resist Cenci's claim to rep- resent God's will by invoking the dominant discourse of patriarchal Catholicism, which further disposes her to believe that her rape con- firms the power of her father's beliefs. But because she can "attach her emotions to numerous other beings analogous to herself," she does have a capacity for positive transference and should have resisted be- lieving in either her father's self-concept or Catholicism as absolutes.7 Valuable as these analyses are in discovering the complexities of Shelleyan psychology and social theory, they leave the casuistry about Beatrice's responsibility restless because they offer little evidence from the play to suggest how Beatrice could have resisted the forces ranged against her. How could she imaginatively transcend the con- ceptual limits of her religion, much less arrive at a radical skepticism about all conceptions, in a society where Catholicism is, as Shelley says, "a faith in that of which all men have the most certain knowl- edge" (p. 240)? Several of these interpreters, in fact, believe she could not possibly do so.8 Some have attempted to solve the problem by maintaining that The Cenci is a specific tragic moment in the greater comedy of historical progress represented by Prometheus Unbound.9 But if individual historical figures have no way of transcending the conceptual limitations of their era, how can collective humanity, in the person of Prometheus, do so? The analysis that has been made of the imagery of mirroring in the play implies that Beatrice can find no answers by looking either inward or outward. Introspection leads only to narcissistic self-reflection and self-contempt;'0 seeking an ex- ternal, mimetic model will only result in finding and mistaking for real the fictional social constructions of the era, or more basically one's own and others' falsely-objectified desires for dominance."

These problems are sufficiently difficult that several interpreters have claimed restless casuistry is Shelley's intended tragic aesthetic.13 A possible resolution may be sought by comparing The Cenci not with Prometheus Unbound but with the more historically-situated characters and action in Laon and Cythna (later The Revolt of Islam). Laon and Cythna are maximally ideal figures carrying out a kinder, gentler version of the French Revolution in the hypothetically more progressive immediate future. Yet together they suffer and err much as Beatrice does, and unlike her they go on to learn from their mis- takes. Their story is a reminder that, although Shelley often says the human condition is perfectible, he also implies that human nature will always contain imperfections capable of producing evil if cir- cumstances are less than ideal. He may say, in A Defense of Poetry, that "every epoch . . . has deified its peculiar errors" and "Revenge [in Homer] is the naked Idol of the worship of a semi-barbarous age" (pp. 486-87), but the enlightened Laon is initially as vulnerable as Beatrice and Achilles are to this Idol when violence threatens him and his beloved. Cythna's speech in canto vI, based on experiences much like Beatrice's, shows that such idols represent a deeper "self-idolatry" embedded in the noblest creations of imagination. She affirms, as many have suggested, that religion epitomizes the tendency to pro- ject anthropomorphic desires onto the universe. But her experiences imply further that all imaginative projections, including her own ideal of revolution, lead to doing or suffering evil-not because there is no correspondence between such projections and the world, but because the ego prefers its limitless aspirations to those correspon- dences which do exist. In creating any ideal, the imagination mixes entirely self-centered, impossible dreams with more mutually feasible desires and objectifies the entire concept as real. Experience in- evitably fails to fulfill that portion of the concept which most em- bodies the ego's unlimited desires for power and self-justification-for example, the anthropomorphic qualities in deities created to explain 13.

But the ego persists in interpreting ex- perience so as to affirm a "dark idolatry ofself," a faith that such qual- ities are precisely the ones that are most real. The second part of this essay will analyze the epistemological and moral basis for this hamartia, a theory of perception involving both projection and correspondence and represented in many of Shelley's works by imagery of mirroring. Those who have analyzed this im- agery in The Cenci have described how the mirroring process con- structs concepts, but not how it also provides a basis for discriminat- ing degrees of error. A more complete analysis will suggest that, for Shelley, the imagination's tendency to create fixed images of its de- sire cannot be overcome simply by endlessly reformulating those im- ages. In fact, to polarize fixed conceptions as the source of error and constant reformulation as the correction would be, for Shelley, a ver- sion of the most fundamental error. According to his use of mirror imagery, all objectified conceptions are not wrong but incomplete; some aspects of every concept accurately "mirror" or correspond with experience and produce a reduplicated reflection of "light" or mutual desire, while others do not. To avoid exchanging one inade- quate belief for an even less adequate one, a person must learn which aspects of her desire produce the most positive results and which are most consistently reflective only of self-serving darkness. The rest of the essay will then demonstrate how Shelleyan tragedy involves the interaction of an individual's self-idolatry with the pre- vailing beliefs of a historical era. As Shelley's comment on "the dou- ble face of false and true" in religions suggests, no concept, be it dom- inant ideology or revolutionary ideal, is monolithic; all combine complex, often conflicting values and overlap with other concepts, so a person has the freedom and responsibility to test her version of an ideology against other versions and against experience. Beatrice's struggle with her father reflects a deeper struggle against the "dark idolatry of self" in her own multifaceted Christianity. For Cenci, re- ligion is merely identification with divine power, and he controls others by exploiting their inability to face the presence of this self- idolatry in their own ideals. Despite Beatrice's avowed commitment to love and altruism, her "prototype" of herself as an invulnerable minister of God's justice entails more belief in divine power than in</page><page sequence="7">222 Keats-Shelley Journal divine love. Ironically, therefore, her father's rape makes her fear his version of religion is true-brute power is the only god, and her faith in love has been culpable weakness-rather than leading her to her stepmother's version of religion, in which one can love and do good despite error and weakness. Unable to bear the former reflection of her prototype, and refuising the vulnerability implied by the latter, Beatrice asserts the least plausible aspect of her original prototype- her invulnerability to evil-and thus enacts what she most wishes to deny, her father's belief in power. Representing the consensus about Beatrice's insufficient use of imagination, Carlos Baker has said that Beatrice's flaw is the "crack in her armor ofself-righteousness."14 Her error is rather to believe self-righteousness can be "holy and un- stained." Her tragedy implies that even victims of horrible crimes should do more than commit equally dark, self-protective acts of re- venge. They can mirror the mutually destructive effects of such self- righteousness and show how love can resist without accepting the oppressor's beliefs. I. THE IDEALIST'S DARK IDOLATRY OF SELF Many readers have found it difficult to believe that Shelley wants Beatrice to take more responsibility for her fate. Yet in Laon and Cythna, Cythna, an even more innocent victim of rape, delivers a complex analysis of human nature in which she claims both victim and victimizer share such responsibility. As many have noted, Cythna describes the genesis of religion as the epitome of human error. Some "moon-struck sophist," searching for the mysterious causes underly- ing things, saw his own desire, "the shade from his own soul," reflected back from "the world's vast mirror." This would have been a neutral perceptual error, "an innocent dream," except that "fear's dew of poison" fixated this belief and added further anthropomor- phic qualities, creating a punitive god whose "will of strength is right" (vIII.46-54; 7I). But the creation of an external power-god is only one manifesta- tion of a more universal self-protection. Cythna's language implies everyone bears responsibility for evil; she uses phrases that could ap- I4. Carlos Baker, Shelley's Major Poetry, p. 148.</page><page sequence="8">Hamartia of Imagination in Shelley 223 ply to evildoers or victims ("To weep for crime tho' stained with thy friend's dearest blood" [vIII.99]), and describes victims in language implying they themselves become guilty (persecuted women wear false smiles "As calm decks the false Ocean" before storms [vlII.I321). Originally all people, like the "sophist," innocently create partly er- roneous projections of desire, and in pursuing this desire they expe- rience "stains of inevitable crime," that is, they do or suffer wrong. They then compound the problem by reacting to such crime with "hate" or "self-contempt" (viii.I 63-80o) rather than with mutual for- giveness. The root of both feelings is an idolatry of human power to resist evil, especially a refusal to "know thyself," to accept one's own limitations. Reproach not thine own soul, but know thyself, Nor hate another's crime, nor loathe thine own. It is the dark idolatry of self, Which, when our thoughts and actions once are gone, Demands that man should weep, and bleed, and groan; O vacant expiation! Be at rest.- The past is Death's, the future is thine own; And love and joy can make the foulest breast A paradise of flowers, where peace might build her nest. (vIII. I90-98) Cythna's and Laon's own experiences show how fundamental this dark idolatry is to the noblest people. Because they initially believe they can avoid "stains of inevitable crime," they hate themselves for failing, cannot fully admit they have failed, and therefore commit worse errors and crimes than if they had accepted their vulnerability. Most insidiously, such worship of their own integrity is inevitably a part of their most ideal conceptions, and is therefore all the more difficult to distinguish from the possible good in such conceptions. Laon and Cythna originally believe they can nonviolently and in- vulnerably effect a bloodless revolution, a noble but also self-serving illusion quickly shattered by Cythna's abduction and Laon's murder of three of her captors in a vain attempt to save her. Laon's behavior and the madness both subsequently experience might have been less extreme if they had been more humble about their susceptibility to</page><page sequence="9">224 Keats-Shelley Journal doing and suffering harm. More significantly, they do not dwell on physical pain, on the effect of their acts on each other, or on how they can continue to help suffering humanity as they had planned; in- stead, each is obsessed with personal guilt and shame. Laon sees the world as a "choir of devils" in his own shape, "hideously multiplied" (III.199-2o7), a gross overestimation of his power to ruin the world. With less guilt but equal egocentrism, Cythna remains entirely pre- occupied with shame over her rape for months afterwards (vII.I133- 34). The extent of their self-idolatry is graphically imaged in their mutual cannibalism fantasies: they have consumed any concern for others in their private hells of shame. It is only after years of protec- tive isolation that these "ideal" heroes can disentangle what was al- truistic and objectively possible in their original ideal from their illu- sions about their personal power and goodness. II. THE PROTOTYPE OF SELF AS A DARK EIDOLON The dynamics of this idolatry in The Cenci, as well as in Laon and Cythna, are linked by images of mirroring to the process of ethical de- velopment outlined in many of Shelley's works. As already noted, in- terpreters of The Cenci have emphasized that the passivity associated with mirroring suggests individual mind is acted upon by powerful social and psychological forces which it cannot fully know or control. But the multivalence of both the mirror of self and its sources in Shelley's writing implies a complex, not entirely passive mental process in which it is possible to discriminate how accurately and morally the self reflects other sources.'5 On the one hand, mirrors do not merely imitate what they reflect. Like a mirror, the self frames a S15. The aforementioned analyses of mirror imagery (cf. n.Io) share the idealist assumptions about Shelley and about Romanticism in general embodied in M. H. Abrams' The Mirror and the Lamp (New York: Oxford University Press, 1953), which contrasts epistemological models before and after the Romantic revolution according to the binary opposition of the mirror-mind as passively reflecting a universe known by reason and independent of mind-and the lamp-mind as actively projecting imag- inative form onto an essentially unknowable, morally and ontologically unforthcoming universe (pp. 57-58). This opposition is implicit in Jerrold Hogle's distinction between perverted transference as "mimetic" mirroring, as falsely ascribing objectivity to a conception and subjugating oneself to it (pp. 149-50, 158), versus the "analogic" or "metaphorical" transference which continually finds similarities without insisting that they be essential or exclusive (pp. I4-15, 155). It is impossible to do a complete analysis of Shelley's use of mirror imagery here, but a few examples from major passages, coupled with the above analysis, would suggest that Shelley's epistemology might better be construed as a complex, indirect realism rather than as radical skeptical idealism (see especially Adonais, stanzas 52-54, and the first stanza ofMont Blanc).</page><page sequence="10">Hamartia of Imagination in Shelley 225 limited perspective, reverses that perspective to one uniquely its own, and distorts light if the mirror is irregular, "prismatic," or "many- sided," as in many of Shelley's metaphors.'6 On the other hand, this imagery suggests that love is a reflection of desire whose origins are not primarily the secret springs of self but other beings, including nonhuman sources. According to the Defense, love, the "great secret of morals," is "a going out of the self, and an identification with the beautiful that exists in thought, action, or person, not our own" (p. 487). "On Love" provides the mechanism for this process; we form an internal "prototype" of the good based on what we like best in ourselves, then seek its "antitype" or likeness in nature, especially in other people. This prototype is a distorting "mirror" because it "reflects only the forms of purity and brightness." But these forms are not purely self-generated and self-referential; they are the ideal in "our nature" as observed in "the nature of man" generally (pp. 473- 74). Elsewhere, as in the preface to Alastor, Shelley says internal ideals are responses to the beautiful in natural "objects infinite and unmea- sured" as well as in people (p. 69). Having received the light of some love or life-force from nature and other people, one is kindled with corresponding desire. The subsequent going out of self to find an an- titype is thus a reflection and transmutation of desire from many sources in the uniquely-shaped mirror of the individual's prototype of the good. This image of love as reduplication of light in a series ofmirrorings occurs often in Shelley's work. Laon and Cythna describes peoples' fea- tures as reflecting love back and forth until, from being initially "pas- sive instrument[s]" of others' love, they become "lamps" kindled by mutual reflection (as in the Hermit's self-description in canto III). In The Cenci, Bernardo implies such a process when he says that Beatrice was "a perfect mirror of pure innocence," presumably his own as well as hers, "Wherein I gazed, and grew happy and good" (v.iv. 30-3 I). 16. Active, multifaceted mirroring which both improves upon and distorts original impressions is an image connecting many of Shelley's major concerns. He uses it frequently to describe an epistemolog- ical process which is initially mimetic of nature but which becomes elaborated and altered by reflecting human interaction. According to A Defense of Poetry, the self is both a typical mirror and an atypical Aeolian harp because it adds to as well as responds to stimuli (pp. 480-8 i). Drama and poetry, the high- est expressions of imagination, are both prismatic mirrors that modify what they reflect (pp. 485, 49I). But act Iv of Prometheus Unbound, in describing what man was like before the "destined hour" arrived, suggests that the imagination's alteration of impressions from nature is also the primary cause of evil and error: "Man, who was a many-sided mirror / Which could distort to many a shape of error / This true fair world of things" is now, punningly, a "Sea [see] reflecting Love" (pp. 382-84).</page><page sequence="11">226 Keats-Shelley Journal But if mirroring is the mechanism of knowledge and love, both Laon and Cythna and The Cenci imply that it is simultaneously the mechanism of error and self-idolatry. If the self can actively select, re- fract, and contribute light, it can also distort light terribly-or fail to reflect it at all. Like the "moon-struck sophist," we project onto "the world's vast mirror" prototypes of desire which inevitably include the "shade of [our] own soul"-impossible fantasies of our omnipotence and righteousness. Such purely self-absorbed desires figuratively ab- sorb light, literally give nothing of the self, and therefore cannot cause any reflection back from another being. The equally imperfect world then reflects back even darker "antitypes," distortions of the proto- type implying that the self is vulnerable to doing or suffering evil. As Cythna claims, "all minds" are "mirrors" of crime and mortality, en- mity and shame, and they blush to face the reflection of such weak- nesses in their own and others' minds (viiI.I72-76). Experiencing such images of their ideals can then cause both vic- tims and victimizers to retreat from the attempt to identify with oth- ers. Forced to choose between qualifying his prototype and rejecting what the world has reflected back, a person often chooses a dark, false self-idolatry over a true, if imperfectly bright, blending of his proto- type with the desires and realities of other beings. (Shelley probably uses imagery of the self as worshipping reflections of its own image with the intent to evoke the Greek word for both "image" and "idol"-eidolon.) One may even, like Orsino, "flatter the dark spirit" of self (II.ii. 159), or be seduced by such flattery, as Giacomo is when he laments that Orsino's murderous suggestions seemed like light but were actually "the mirror of [Giacomo's] darkest thoughts" (v.i.2I). Ifone's desire to find antitypes of goodness is sufficiently thwarted, the imagination may revert to total self-idolatry, an assertion of the self's desires as the image of all good in a world otherwise alien and evil. III. THE JANUS FACES OF CHRISTIANITY Together with Laon and Cythna, The Cenci demonstrates how in any era the noblest person will to some degree pervert all conceptions, es- pecially prevailing ideologies, by reflecting their false, self-serving implications over their more feasible and mutually beneficial ones. Shelley constantly affirms that people need ideals, which can be</page><page sequence="12">Hamartia of Imagination in Shelley 227 beneficial even in the form of religion; his "Address, To the Irish People" maintains that "all religions are good which make men good" (p. 216). But all ideals are like religions in having, "like Janus," a "double face of false and true" (A Defense of Poetry, p. 482). In The Cenci, Beatrice's Christianity is no more purely good or evil than Cythna's revolutionary idealism; her god of justice is also an idol which conflates disinterested benevolence with purely selfish mo- tives. Beatrice's more brutal circumstances of family and culture make her more like Laon than Cythna in her responses to others' evil. She is driven not only to a greater need for physical self-protection but also to a dark idolatry more compromised by investment in self- centered power, with the result that she does as well as suffers evil. But since all idols are Janus-faced, her position in history makes her no more exonerated by the primitive ideological conditions of her age than she is superior to the idols of earlier ages. The play provides numerous ironic mirrors, including alternatives to Beatrice's rather selective interpretation of Christianity, which suggest that Beatrice becomes more responsible for her fate the more she avoids facing the reflection of her own darkness in the people and events around her. Most darkly, Beatrice's father, far from being an atypically mon- strous being, is the dark parent who embodies human limitations and who controls others in precise proportion as they do not acknowl- edge their kinship with him. Cenci's description of his spiritual rake's progress is not the exhibition of cold reason some have found it,'7 but rather a demonic version of Shelleyan love. In the opening dialogue with Camillo, Cenci says that his "captious fancy" makes his various evil "designs" into the "picture" of his fancy's "wish," and then is compelled to pursue this perverse prototype as though it were a ne- cessity of life "until it be accomplished" (I.ii.87-9I). Having begun by seeing sensual pleasure as the prototype of his fancy's wish, he has found that others' resistance and his own mortality frustrate the real- ization of his "design" (I.i.92-99). Far from meeting with any sym- pathetic response, all indulgences of his desires provide opportunities for others to take advantage of him. According to his first speech, the 17. John Schell, in "Shelley's The Cenci: Corruption and the Calculating Faculty," The University of Mississippi Studies in English, 2 (I98I), 1-14 (4), identifies the flaw of both Beatrice and her father as an "unimaginative" pride in their calculating or reasoning faculty, a position widely shared by other readers, apparently because it exonerates imagination from active responsibility for evil.</page><page sequence="13">228 Keats-Shelley Journal Church diminishes his possessions every time he engages in his per- verse amours. His own children are his disease and particles of his di- vided self (Iv.i. 1I7-I8), regrettable side-effects of his passions who drain him of his substance. Consequently, he withdraws into greater isolation and secrecy, as he does in act I when the Church punishes him. In a reversal of Shelleyan love, he seeks to reject identification with the ugliness and pain he can cause in others, "flattering [his] se- cret peace" with its difference from "other's pain" (I.i.80). He sees all going out of the self as a vicious cycle in which one ego cannibalizes rather than nurtures another, as he wants to starve his children or drink their blood (i.i.133, I.iii.81-82) instead of having his substance eaten up by them. The worst curse he can later wish on Beatrice is that she have a child who will be what she has been to him, a "dis- torted mirror" in which to see "her image mixed with what she most abhors" (Iv.i.1I47-48). Hideous as the Count's vision is, his opening dialogue with Camillo suggests that it is reflected by the others around him. Everything in this scene affirms Cenci's self-justifying belief that peo- ple use their Christianity to objectify their self-interest, and that only he accepts-and therefore represents-the terrible God this behavior implies. Appropriately, given Camillo's repeated use of the word "in- terest," the Pope serves his own interest by taking Cenci's lands as the price for "hush[ing] up" his crimes, and Camillo extorts the moral usury of claiming to save his soul in the process. Cenci's comments convey his contempt for such hypocrisy, and his perception that this selfishness is, in their own definition of the term, diabolical (he likens the Pope's respiting his soul from hell by taking his property to the devil's respiting the Pope's soul from heaven [I.i.26-271). In fact, Cenci's power over others comes from realizing that they too identify with a megalomaniacal god to whom all others are re- bellious devils. In act I, Cenci quickly progresses beyond irony to di- rect expressions of evil, because he knows others will not oppose him. His threat at the banquet that his vengeance is like the sealed commissions of a king "which kill, and none dare name the mur- derer" (I.iii.96-98) implies more than the guests' fear of retaliation. Camillo and the banquet guests fail to denounce or even fully recog-</page><page sequence="14">Hamartia of Imagination in Shelley 229 nize his evil largely because they dare not name the murderer, i.e., admit the degree to which Cenci's motives are theirs. Camillo, in fact, opens the play by "hush[ing] up" Cenci's being a murderer in order that the church may become a silent partner in the wages of sin-a complicity Cenci puns on as the Pope's having monetarily "compounded" with him in crime (I.i.Ig). Every man in the play-except for Cenci's surviving sons-secretly covets absolute au- thority, as Cenci intimates to Camillo when he says his fancies are those which "men like you would start [startle] to know" because men like Camillo want to begin knowing such evils-but pull back in fear when they begin to know Cenci's desires as their own (I.i.89). Cenci flaunts his awareness of this hypocrisy when he invites his guests to join him in a black mass for his sons' deaths-after all, it was their god who killed his sons for him (one died in a collapsing church!). Cenci, who is described as a "serpent" (Iv.iv. 16) and as hav- ing a "fiend" or "devil" within (i.i.45, II.i.45, Iv.ivI6), embodies what Orsino calls the "unbeheld divinity" or "dark spirit" that "stir[s] up men's minds / To black suggestions" (II.ii. 155-60), everyone's se- cret self-idolatry. Shelley implies we are all Cenci just as Dostoevsky implies we are all Karamazov. Like her father, Beatrice has the family tendency "to analyze their own and other minds," a "self-anatomy" which "can teach the will / Dangerous secrets; for it tempts our powers, / Knowing what must be thought, and may be done, / Into the depth of darkest purposes" (nII.ii.Io9-13). But although her first speech shows her being driven to anatomize herself and others, her accusation of her father at the banquet shows that her analysis has served mainly to help her face and resist the evil he represents. Far from being cynical,18 she clings to hope and generosity of spirit longer than most could in her circum- stances. In her first speech she apologizes to Orsino for mistrusting him, and in the banquet scene she hopes that her brothers are not dead even when she alone suspects the evil motives for Cenci's gai- 18. Schell accurately points out that from the very beginning Beatrice shares Cenci's pride of intel- lect and a recognition of the selfish hypocrisy surrounding her. He goes too far, however, in claiming that Beatrice is fundamentally cynical and calculating from her first appearance (7). Although there are parallels between her distrustful manipulation of Orsino and Cenci's of Camillo, the differences are equally striking.</page><page sequence="15">230 Keats-Shelley Journal ety. Her recognition of evil in others, as she intimates to the banquet guests (I.iii.Io8-Io), is what the preface calls a "violent thwarting" of her desire to love the good in others, especially in her father. But Beatrice too has created a self-idolatrous version of Chris- tianity. Her invocations of a just paternal god who punishes evil (I.iii.52-53), protects the weak (II.i.I6-r8), and is offended by tyranny (I.iii.157) postulate a god unlike her father's and reflect her own heroic defiance of him to protect her family. But they also pos- tulate an omnipotent external justice which will empower her to be morally superior and to triumph over any suffering, often at others' expense. In act I, Beatrice uses her religion to protect herself by ex- posing others' unjust motives and shaming them, as well as to serve a disinterested ideal ofjustice. Her first words in the play, to Orsino, are to "Pervert not truth" (I.ii.I), to cease his lovemaking and remember his priestly vows, which Beatrice honors by swearing him a "cold fidelity." But taking the moral high ground protects her from her own confused emotions and from having to make them both face her basic reason for rejecting him--her dislike of his "sly, equivocating vein." Her self-righteousness is also intended to shame Orsino into deliver- ing her petition to the Pope. At the banquet, she defends others while also protecting herself and her sense of superiority, when she "rebuke[s] the devil" in Cenci, as Lucretia later says (n.i.45), by accusing him of injustice (I.iii.I46-57). Her ideal of her relation to God is as much a conflation of disinterested love with self-interest as is Cythna's belief that she can reform the world without being touched by evil. Beatrice has also created an idol which is no more fully represen- tative of the best in Christianity than are the idols of the male char- acters. Humility, mercy, and love in response to evil are notably ab- sent from her behavior and invocations of god. Throughout the play it is Lucretia who exhibits these virtues. Despite her manifest weak- nesses, she is the only example of love and resistance to Cenci Beatrice has ever seen; Beatrice says she owes all her "virtuous thoughts" to Lucretia (I.ii. 17-18, I.i.89-93). As discussed below, Lucretia exhibits the moral superiority of fallible yet unswerving love to Beatrice's rather Old Testament justice. Despite having suffered almost exactly what Beatrice does, Lucretia retains enough love and self-esteem to</page><page sequence="16">Hamartia of Imagination in Shelley 23 tell Beatrice the one truth that would have saved her: "Whate'er you may have suffered, you have done / No evil" (III.i.121-22). As in classical tragedy, Beatrice's error is a major factor in inciting catastrophe. Her stern "laying bare" to Orsino of his faults only makes him, as he says, conceal his evil further (I.ii.83-9I).19 Such unloving, accusatory confrontation has a more terrible effect on her father. Cenci has not worked himself up to inflict new horrors on the rest of his family because he has not needed to in order to believe that he has complete power over them all. As a result, however, he has become so jaded with his ability to dominate others that he is on the verge of suicide (I.i.99-Io2), a scorpion about to sting himself to death. Beatrice's "brow superior" (II.i.I I7) sharpens his appetite by giving him something to exult over defeating. Her '"just" mirroring of others to themselves is dark not only in being self-serving but also in "just" reflecting others' darkness without any light of love--and with consequent destructive effect on herself. When Beatrice is raped, the deepest cause of her temporary insan- ity is the self-concept now forced upon her, the "image which has transformed" her that she cannot bear to "feign" or face up to fully, and this image derives its most terrible features from her self-idolatry. The fear of social opprobrium she directly expresses, which some have seen as the essence of her fear,20 is only a potentially confirming effect and a reflection of something deeper in herself; to take a com- ment of Lucretia's less literally, the words Beatrice speaks indicate that she "apprehends the sense of pain, / But not its cause" (mi.i.34-35). Nor is there evidence to suggest that she feels self-contempt because she has disappointed a benevolent deity. Like Cythna, Beatrice has 19. Though Beatrice implies that naked reality needs the clothing of human community and love (I.iii.Io5-7), most people in the play deny each other love and clothing (I.iii.96), use clothing as dis- guises in order to victimize others (v.ii.Io4), or give false and ironically unprofitable clothing such as the "robe of woven gold" which Beatrice gives Marzio-and which gets him apprehended (v.ii.26). But stripping others bare, as Beatrice's anatomizing does repeatedly, is a form of rape; like Orsino, the stripped person feels unjustly violated and only conceals his evil more carefuilly. Beatrice herself resists being stripped bare by public scrutiny (m.i.158). Nor should one throw off the garments of civilization in order to commit revenge, as Beatrice asks her family to do in an echo of Othello's throwing off "re- spective lenity" (III.i.2o8-io). The only appropriate removal of clothing is the stripping off of one's own disguises, which Beatrice refuses to do (mi.i.i 57-60). As Cythna says in Laon and Cythna (vim. i63ff), this is the only way to convert both oneself and others to love. 20. Jean Hall, "The Socialized Imagination," 343.</page><page sequence="17">232 Keats-Shelley Journal based her self-worth on an unrealistic faith in her own power to de- feat evil. But having experienced far less love and more violence than Cythna, Beatrice's concept of the good is based more on the power to intimidate and punish evil than on love. When her father's rape savagely challenges her belief in her own power, she has little faith in love to fall back upon. Instead, she is left with the fear that power is omnipotent but not just. Perhaps, as her father believes, God sees vulnerability to evil as culpable weakness rather than injured moral superiority-and her own weakness has allowed her to be paralyzed further by putting her in a situation where she has to contemplate this idea. No wonder she feels guilty and says, "What have I done?" (Im.i.69).21 Unable to face this possibility, Beatrice can express it, at a later moment of apparent triumph, only in the form of a denial that "power is as a beast which grasps / And loosens not; a snake whose look transmutes / All things to guilt which is its nutriment" (Iv.iv.178-80). But when condemned to die, she momentarily faces the horror, fearing that "all things" after death "should be . . . [her] father's spirit" eternally violating her ("For was he not alone om- nipotent / On earth?" [v.iv.68-711). Beatrice's fear is reflected in the odd way she confuses her identity with Lucretia's in her moment of temporary madness. When she can- not "feign" or face "the image which has transformed" her, Beatrice says she sees "a woman weeping there, / And standing calm and mo- tionless" while Beatrice herself feels as if the world were rocking be- neath her feet (mI.i.9-12). Since the only other person present is Lucretia, who is not weeping, one might assume Beatrice is talking 21. Shelley's depiction of rape as primarily an exercise of patriarchal power parallels at least one im- portant recent analysis with eerie precision. In The Bait and the Trap (New York: Crown Publishers, 1975), Jean MacKellar argues that rape is a working-out of social domination by those whose attempts to gain power by ordinary means have been frustrated, in "revenge against an exploitative society" (p. 12). But the rapist's valuing of power is "not an abnormality in our culture; [rape] is only an extreme of the accepted modes of male behavior" (p. 138). Under all the pretenses of law and socialization, "the prevailing standards for 'success'" in society are based on "exploitation of the weak by the strong" (p. 137), with exploitation of women by men a subset of the general standard (p. 141). Indeed, society uses such myths as the "sex fiend" to create a false distinction between rape and more subtle, universal ex- ercises of male aggression (p. 27). MacKellar also describes women's reactions to rape either as a dis- covery of their moral and physical ability to resist such power-values-if they are lucky-or as a shock which makes them feel "moral failure" for being vulnerable in a world of power-relations (p. 39). But as the title of MacKellar's book implies, victims can recognize destructive paradigms such as those of "bait" and "trap" for the socialization of women and men, respectively. Victims are also responsible for making their situation public to save other victims--such as the siblings of an incest victim-and to give them a model of self-esteem.</page><page sequence="18">Hamartia of Imagination in Shelley 233 about herself-and could therefore be looking into a mirror. If so, her confusion implies literally that Beatrice is unable to recognize an ob- jective reflection ofherself, or ironically that she cannot confront her own self-image as the cause that has transformed her.22 But the lines are also ambiguous enough to imply that she, like many baffled read- ers, may be having trouble distinguishing herself from Lucretia. Lines 56-58 in this scene are similarly unclear as to whether Beatrice's "thou" is herself, perhaps seen in a mirror, or Lucretia ("Who art thou? Swear to me, ere I die / With fearful expectation, that indeed / Thou art not what thou seemest . . . Mother!" [III.i.58-60o]). The passage could imply Beatrice is afraid of identifying with her step- mother. To be like Lucretia, named for a famous rape victim, would reflect what Beatrice most fears, since as Lucretia herself says there is no escape for her from Cenci's possession, sexual and otherwise, ex- cept death (II.i.80-87). But Beatrice is too overwhelmed at the moment to see fully what this identification means. She cannot rise above the "mist" of con- fused thoughts which besiege her (III.i. 170) or fully formulate the im- age of herself reflected back to her by her rape. For the audience, however, her situation reflects back a distinction between what may be truly possible good in her self-concept and what has been ego- centric wish-fulfillment. Beatrice and the audience both infer from her experience that anyone can be overcome by another's power. She can no more resist her father than Cythna could resist Othman with her "words of flame." Also like Cythna, Beatrice cannot even rely on her ability to maintain some psychological integrity before such an assault; she fears repeated violation could destroy her will (III.i.216-I8) and drive her mad, unable to refuse emotional consent to further violation, as Cenci intends (Iv.i.I o-12, 0oo-Io2). But Beatrice is less justified in concluding, as Orsino urges her to do, that her only choices are to reassert her own righteousness by vengeance and concealment, or to be dominated by her father's power. Such 22. In Queen Mab, Shelley puns on "feign/fane" by describing Mab's fane as the place where "fancy soar[s]"; the "fane" or temple is an imaginative construct "feigned" to capture in cognitive form the sacramental feeling of relation to the universe Ianthe feels during vision. So when Beatrice says she can "feign no image / Of that which has transformed [her]," one suspects Shelley is ironically implying she subliminally wishes to (or would fain) worship her self-image, but cannot-and that it is the self-worship already embedded in this image, more than the fact of rape or fear of social opprobrium, which is most responsible for "transforming" her and driving her mad.</page><page sequence="19">234 Keats-Shelley Journal thoughts are revealed when she contemplates what her death, and the moral judgment on her life, could be. She rejects one of Lucretia's al- ternatives, that death could be a Christlike "reward of trampling down / The thorns which God has strewn upon the path / Which leads to immortality" (III.i. I21-23), and repeats only the other alter- native, the idea that death may be "the punishment of crime" (III.i.II19-26), i.e., punishment by her or of her. The play will demonstrate how impossible it is for her to be "holy and unstained." But as Lucretia, echoing the preface, points out, one cannot be morally degraded by another's act (III.i.119-22). Nor does one's own weakness or error necessarily entail the supremacy of egomaniacal power over innocence and virtue. Lucretia managed to raise two stepchildren with love and to defend them in many ways from Cenci despite her weaknesses and her hellish fate. Beatrice forgets this when she says, "if another ever knew / Aught like [my sufferings], she died as I will die" (Im.i.I14-16). Beatrice can hardly be condemned for an initial inability to face the horror and to separate the truth from her hopes and fears. But she be- comes increasingly compromised as she flees from self-knowledge by relying repeatedly on the very aspects of her self-image which her re- cent experience should cause her to question. The meaning of the Manichaean image informing Laon and Cythna, in which eagle and serpent must remain intertwined, is that the more one struggles to disentangle the two, to idolize one's desire as an entirely good bird and the restraints on the self as an evil serpent, the more one makes the self the source of evil. When she claims she has recovered from her madness and separated good from evil, "unravelled [her] entan- gled will . . . and determined what is right" (III.i.220o-2I), Beatrice has not recognized the greater madness of denying that some evil, her vulnerability, is inseparable from the good, from some remaining po- tential for love and justice. She may think the serpent of power and evil is no longer "entangled" in her "will"; but in later calling power an evil serpent dissociate from herself, she echoes her father when he called her a "painted viper" (I.iii.I65) and a disease. Beatrice and Cenci use serpent imagery to attribute their own culpability to each other much as Hamlet and Claudius each use disease imagery to blame the rottenness in Denmark, for which they are both responsible, entirely</page><page sequence="20">Hamartia of Imagination in Shelley 235 on the other. As she proceeds to carry out her vengeance, Beatrice's exercises of power in the name of her righteous ends are hardly in- nocent. As Cythna's imagery implies, charmed birds are killed by ser- pents because to believe oneself "charmed"-invulnerable-is to make oneself "charmed"-mesmerized by illusion and vulnerable to evil. IV. THE PERIPATEAI OF REVENGE: RIGHTEOUS IN WORDS, IN DEEDS A CAIN Beatrice's revenge manifests a tragic unity of action in which each at- tempt to pretend her father's dark spirit of selfish power is not in her requires that she exercise this spirit more fully. In Shelley's version of peripateia, each time Beatrice tries to affirm the self-idolatrous aspects of her prototype, she further denies the practicable and altruistic part, the Christian love of family and of justice she claims to profess. In the process, she becomes less sympathetic than the other conspirators and more like her father. Worse, she becomes a hypocrite like Orsino, who suppresses sympathy and manipulates others in the belief that he can control the "dark spirit" in them without being ruled by it him- self (II.ii.155-6I)-as if his desire for control did not show that this spirit rules him most of all. The contrast between Beatrice's and Lucretia's behavior in act Iv suggests that by persevering in self-righteousness, Beatrice brings Cenci's curse upon herself. Cenci summons Beatrice and is refused by her three times, whereupon he curses her to see, "as / From a dis- torting mirror . . . Her image mixed with what she most abhors" (Iv.i.I46-48), himself and what he represents. She may not literally have a child by her father, as Cenci intends, but her self-righteous- ness is the inheritance from her father mixed with her most ideal self- concept. Terrible as her situation is, Shelley implies that she brings this curse upon herself by refusing any attempt to "convert the in- jurer from his dark passions by peace and love," as the preface puts it (p. 240), because, although Beatrice refuses to try, Lucretia does try and, in her clumsy but well-meaning way, nearly persuades her hus- band to give up his evil designs on Beatrice. Symbolically, Beatrice has denied Christ three times by defying Cenci rather than con- fronting him with loving resistance. In the murder scene, Shelley echoes Macbeth to show how Bea-</page><page sequence="21">236 Keats-Shelley Journal trice's self-righteousness makes her become "hardened" like her fa- ther and more cruel than Lady Macbeth. Although the hired assassin Marzio cannot kill the sleeping count because Cenci reminds him of his own father (Iv.iii. 14-22), Cenci's own daughter is ready to kill the assassins and her father until she frightens the assassins into going back and carrying out the deed (Iv.iii.23-32). Beatrice's actions thor- oughly contradict her belief that she is what she calls Marzio, a "weapon in the hand of God" (Iv.iii.54) and affirms, as does the logic of her so designating Marzio, that she deifies herself as the God who wields this weapon. In the last act, Beatrice bases her self-defense on a lie which she be- lieves serves the higher truth implicit in her self-image, but which only serves the self-idolatry in it. She denies not only moral culpabil- ity for murder but the deed itself, believing that since she has done nothing wrong she should not have to admit the deed and risk being judged or punished by corrupt authorities. She will not face the pos- sibility that public scrutiny might reveal something wrong in her deed-either the ambiguity of her motives or the fact that actions may have public consequences for which she is responsible regardless of her motives or her cause. She even deludes herself up to the last that a just cause will require no personal sacrifice to be efficacious for pub- lic good, even in a highly imperfect world. As a result, she acts more selfishly than the other conspirators, accomplishes no public justice or reform by her vengeance, and actually destroys the one chance she alone had to save them all. It has been recognized that Beatrice's ability to detect others' evil and her steadfastness to her principles contrast favorably with her brother Giacomo's vain remorse, his confession under torture, and his inability to discern Orsino's perfidy. But Giacomo's capacity for sympathy is less corrupted than Beatrice's. His remorse over the mur- der is due to pity for his father rather than fear for himself (v.i. Io-I I). He also questions his own motives, comparing them with what he calls the purely just motives of Beatrice (v.i.42-46); he exhorts Beatrice to confess more to spare her from torture than to save him- self (v.iii.52-54); and his last thoughts are remorse for the sufferings of others (v.iii.96-Io6). Although Lucretia consents to the murder and breaks under torture, as far as her strength permits she acts more</page><page sequence="22">Hamartia of Imagination in Shelley 237 for others than for herself. Even Marzio the assassin is more sympa- thetic. After confessing under torture and then hearing Beatrice's recital of her wrongs, Marzio swears she is innocent, takes on all the blame, and kills himself before being forced to confess further (v.ii.158-64, 180-82). By contrast, Beatrice is willing that her family undergo torture and even upbraids them for betraying her and the family name (v.iii.28-52). Her behavior recalls Prometheus's curse defying Jupiter to "imprecate" on him and his "The utmost torture of thy hate." Her self-centered thoughts when sentenced to die (v.iv.48-74) contrast with the sympathetic thoughts of those around her. She has abrogated her self-appointed role as moral exemplar for her family, one of the altruistic and feasible aspects of her self-image. Although Beatrice, like Hamlet and Othello, delivers a final speech in hopes that she can justify herself to posterity, she is a failure as ajust avenger in addition to failing her family. Traditionally, the revenger's tragedy is to be caught between two corrupting choices, letting a murderer go free to infect the body politic or becoming guilty of murder himself. Beatrice's choices are to kill her father or probably to be driven mad by his continued violation of her. Although the ar- rival of a messenger to arrest Cenci just after the murder suggests that ideally Beatrice should have been more patient, her mental state and the unresolvable ambiguity about what caused this arrest imply that hardly anyone could remain steadfast in such circumstances until some unforeseeably distant self-destruction of evil occurs. But even a compromised avenger can still partly redeem her situation. Any pos- itive resolution in revenge tragedies lies in public action, including revelation of all that has happened. The revenger must be willing to sacrifice herself and to confess, or suppress, any purely selfish motives in the name of the public good-a situation unfortunately still com- parable to a woman's willingness to prosecute a rapist. Such an out- come accords with Cythna's version of the Christian ethic when she claims all commit or suffer crimes but can be morally renewed by re- moving self-protective "disguises" and by mutual forgiveness. Beatrice, however, refuses to make a personal sacrifice of any sort. She is afraid public reaction will confirm her fear that power has tainted her. As a result, under the ironically appropriate guise of de- fending her patriarchal name, she affirms this taint by refusing pub-</page><page sequence="23">238 Keats-Shelley Journal licly to "name the murderer" (she will not either name herselfa mur- derer or name her father's deed and confess her fear of consenting to it). Unlike Hamlet, she is not ready to die or to confess as much as she understands of her involvement in the crime so that society might be horrified at the injustices which provoked it. She considers her deed an enaction of divine justice, yet she will not trust this justice enough to admit she was its agent. By the end, her only god is the image of her integrity. She has committed the particular form of self- idolatry which A Defense of Poetry says it is the function of tragedy to correct: the mistake of cherishing one's crimes as a justified "creation" of "choice" rather than admitting that crime originates in "unfathomable" natural weakness and "error" (pp. 490-9 I). In the culminating irony of the play, Beatrice's disingenuous self- defense seals her fate. As attempts to avoid appearing guilty of mur- der, her arguments are false and self-serving, as the inquisitors can partly see. In fact, her arguments rely unsuccessfully on assumptions about the selfishness of human nature. She claims Marzio's implica- tion of her means nothing because people confess to anything under torture, and her inquisitor, the Cardinal, would himself confess un- der torture to such a horrible lie as the murder of his beloved grand- son. But she has killed her father whereas the Cardinal did not kill his grandson, and no one is under the illusion that she loved her father. Although she claims that if she were ruthless enough to commit mur- der she would also have been smart and ruthless enough to have killed the assassins, her accusers know she had no time to kill them before the deed was discovered, and such an argument speaks poorly for her motives. And her plea to Marzio (v.ii.35-157) is a fabric of careful equivocations that convinces no one but Marzio because it is couched so that only he understands it. Yet, if she had confessed to the deed but denied the motives of par- ricide-which, in effect, she does to Marzio--some of her arguments would have an entirely different meaning, and they might have swayed her judges as they swayed Marzio. She could have appealed rationally as well as emotionally to the inquisitors by arguing that tor- ture never brings forth true motives, whether or not it reveals deeds, rather than relying for sympathy on the specious physical resem- blance between herself and the Cardinal's grandson. Then, in defense</page><page sequence="24">Hamartia of Imagination in Shelley 239 of her motives, her argument to Marzio would have to all present the force of "discrimination / Between the sly, fierce, wild regard of guilt" (v.ii.15i3-54) and Beatrice's relatively more sympathetic mo- tives. The inquisitors and the audience, like Marzio, could under- stand the distinction between cynical parricide and self-defense as the sympathetic mitigation, though not the denial, of her "pernicious mistake" of revenge. But because she cannot bear to admit any weak- ness or error, Beatrice fulfills the worst horrors she tries to deny. The Cenci is indeed an indictment of society and of the conceptual errors in traditional religion, a more romantic indictment of exter- nally-imposed evils than is to be found in much Greek tragedy. Its effect is also more pathetic, initially evoking extremes of revulsion at Cenci and sympathy with Beatrice. But the play finally makes an ap- peal to rational analysis and detached judgment by treating Beatrice's beliefs ironically, in order to teach the audience that people have some responsibility for their actions despite the inevitable limitations of human weakness and social tyranny. Beatrice's failure of imagina- tive sympathy is not merely the result of unavoidable ideological lim- itations imposed by history, nor of employing reason rather than feel- ing-and a stronger exercise of imagination will not be sufficient to correct it. The most beautiful idealisms of moral excellence are them- selves the source of evil, in their conflation of purely selfish with more mutual and feasible desires. This conflation, and the difficulties of dealing with it, constitute Shelley's version of the fundamental weakness in human nature most responsible for evildoing. But like Christian sin or the revelations of human hamartia pronounced by Greek oracles, this weakness can be mitigated by intellectual per- spective, which can both guide and motivate a greater exercise of sympathy.
