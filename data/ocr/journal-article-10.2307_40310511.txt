<plain_text><page sequence="1">PREHISTORIC TOMBS NEAR ZEBBUG, MALTA (Plates I- III) (i) The Tombs and Their Contents In September, 1 947, whilst digging trenches for the laying of the foundations of a building in the field known as 'ta Trapna iz-Zghira\ in the parish of Zebbug (Ref 394228 on the standard 2-inch map of Malta), five early tombs were discovered. Th&lt; workmen, not appreciating the importance of the discovery, cut a trench 2 feet wide through the middle of two of these burials, thus partially destroying the deposit. Further destruction was prevented by Mr. Ian Small, Civil Engineer of H.M. Dockyard, who stopped the work and reported the discovery to the Museum; and on inspection of the site it immediately became apparent that we were dealing with tombs of a type hitherto unrecorded. The excavation of these remains was conducted with the fullest care to secure adequate records and ensure the recovery of all the archaeological material. The tombs were five in number, irregularly disposed within an area of 50 sq. yards (Fig. 1 ). They all exhibited more or less the same features. Each tomb consisted of a saucer-shaped cavity roughly cut in the rock-bed, which at this point is the soft, white, Middle Globigerina Limestone and which underlies about 2 ft. of field soil. The diameter of the tombs averaged about 6 ft., and they attained a depth of about 2 ft. at the centre. A single layer of flat, roughly chipped slabs, derived from the local rock-bed, was used to pave the tomb floor. These slabs, about 4 in. in thickness and 10 in. in width, varied in length from 6 in. to 2 ft. 3 in. Overlying the slabs there was a layer of marl, about 6 in. in thickness, in which were embedded human skeletal remains, mostly in a fragmentary state and in utter disorder. Intimately associated with the human remains were numerous fragments of pottery, flint implements, and personal ornaments of sea-shell and bone. The whole layer was profusely impregnated with red ochre. Overlying this was a layer consisting almost ex- clusively of stone chippings, which was about 10 inches deep. The rest of the deposit, 2 ft. 10 in. in thickness, consisted of ordinary red field soil. A thin layer of angular and rounded stones divided this layer at a depth of 1 ft. 6 in. from the surface; below these stones the earth was hard and compact, but above them it was soft and loose. Tomb No. I Somewhat elliptical in shape, measuring 7 ft. 6 in. in maximum length, 5 ft. 9 in. in maximum breadth and 1 ft. 6 in. in depth. It was cut through by a modern trench, 2 ft. 3 in. wide. Only three paving slabs were found in a good state of preservation, the largest of which measured 2 ft. 3 in. in length and an average of 9 in. in breadth; the rest were in an advanced state of disintegration owing to the softness of the rock of which they were made.

A modern trench was cut up to the east side of the tomb without extending into the interior.

Stone: (1) Head of a statue-menhir made of the yellowish, compact variety of Lower Globigerina Limestone. It is damaged on the upper left-hand side, especially at the back, and shows an irregular break at the base where the rest of the block has been broken off. The edges of the block are rounded off and it is well finished on both sides. The face is in slight relief and outlined by a deep groove, and the same is true of the nose, which is the only prominent feature. Eyes and nostrils are indicated by pairs of small holes, and the mouth by a deeper conical drilling. Mouth and chin are connected by a vertical groove. The groove out- lining the face is joined at the top by another, which runs horizontally round the sides and back of the head. A larger, vertical groove runs down the middle of the back. There is a slight trace of what appears to be the right shoulder where the stone is broken off below. The whole surface of the stone, especially the face, is stained with red ochre. These stains of red ochre also appear on the two scars, especially that of the main break, thus showing that this object was already broken when it entered the deposit.

The homogeneity of the material found in each of them proves these graves to have all belonged to the same period. Since the pottery is clearly of the type distinguished by Mr. J. D. Evans as his Period ia^* the tombs as a whole may be assigned to this phase. Tomb 1 , however, contained a pot (Fig. 4, no. 1 ) decorated with broad cut-out bands; this is characteristic of the preceding phase, and may indicate that this tomb was in use slightly earlier than the others. From the invariable incompleteness of the pots recovered from these tombs it may be inferred that part of the burial deposits had been destroyed at some earlier date. This might have taken place when the area was first converted into an arable field. Further support for this idea may be gleaned from the extreme shallowness of Tombs Nos. 2 and 3, and the great poverty of the material obtained from them.

Evans for his many helpful suggestions in the course of pre- paring it. J. G. Baldacchino (ii) The Significance of the Finds The five prehistoric tombs described with their contents above constitute by far the most important group of early burials so far recorded in the Maltese islands. Tomb 5, as can easily be seen from the lists of finds, was the richest and most important, closely followed by Tombs 4 and 1. Very little was left of Tombs 2 and 3, and their yield was correspondingly poor. It was immediately recognised that the pottery from these tombs differed entirely from that normally regarded as representing the earliest period of the islands' prehistory. Stronger still was the contrast with the types of ceramic current during the later pre- historic phases, from the Tarxien cremation-cemetery and the Borg in-Nadur and Bahria sites. The primitive appearance of the Zebbug pottery, which accorded well with that of the remainder of the tomb-furniture, suggested that here was an earlier stage of culture than anything hitherto recognised in the islands. New research on the prehistoric material from Malta and Gozo has substantially confirmed this surmise, and it can now be said with confidence that these tombs represent an earlier, more primitive phase of the culture well known from the finds in the Tarxien temples and at Hal Saflieni. The pottery in the tombs was found in a very fragmentary condition; the small cup from Tomb 1 was the only vessel to emerge intact. Many of the sherds are small, and the ware is almost invariably much decayed, often to such an extent that it crumbles away in the hand. This decay is probably due to the continual seepage through the tombs of water from the field-soil above. The better-preserved pieces are seen to be made of a compact grey ware mixed with small white grits, which is covered with a fine, well-polished slip. The surface is generally somewhat mottled, and may vary in colour from light grey to almost black. The pieces are almost invariably decorated with lines deeply incised after the application of the slip. The most common shapes found are two. The first is a jar with a singular bell- shaped neck and inverted pear-shaped body (Fig. 4, nos. 3 and 4). On the shoulder are two opposed horizontally-pierced lug-handles, and between these are two smaller lugs or decorative knobs dimpled to imitate lugs. On the neck are generally two further small knobs standing directly above the first pair. It is a strange, but dignified and impressive form of vase, and examples occur in every tomb. The second type of vase is a deep, bag- shaped bowl with a broad, only slightly constricted neck. A number of large sherds of 1 Ant. Journ. viii, 1928, p. 481.</page><page sequence="16">i6 THE BRITISH SCHOOL AT ROME such vases show that they were often fitted with at least one thin, broad strap-handle connecting the neck and shoulder (Fig. 6, nos. i and 3 )♦ Remains of these bowls were found in Tombs 1, 4, and 5. A less-common shape was the small, deep cup with omphalos base and large, oval strap-handle, of which a complete example was found in Tomb 1 (Fig. 5, no. 3, and PL II, a, no. 1 ). Fragmentary remains of two similar ones were extracted from Tomb 4, making three examples in all. The flat-based dish with inverted conical body was also represented in two tombs, Nos. 2 and 3 (Fig. 5, nos. I and 2, and PL II, 6, nos. 1 and 2). From Tomb 5 came fragments of a tiny bead-rimmed pot with an ovoid body and flat base (Fig. 5, nos. 4 and 5). Other shapes represented by one example only are a shallow, roughly-made bowl from Tomb 2, of which we have only one sherd, and a tall jar with flaring neck from Tomb 5. This latter is a somewhat conjectural reconstruction from a few fragments. It is evident that the range of forms is severely limited, and of those recognised only two are at all frequent. With the exception of the bowl-fragment from Tomb 2, all the sherds of any size show traces of decoration. The motifs are generally rather elaborate, but only rarely are the fragments sufficiently large for the arrangement to be made out. The decoration is generally based on groups of from two to four parallel lines. The single line and groups of more than four are sometimes used, but they are not the norm. These groups of lines may be bordered by rows of dots (Fig. 7, no. 9), or, more frequently, by rows of small cut-out triangles with their bases resting on the outermost lines of the group (Fig. 7, nos. I and 2). On the necked bowls two rows of these triangles are sometimes cut base- to-base to accentuate the division between neck and body (Fig. 6, nos. I, 2, and 4). The necked bowl from Tomb 1 (Fig. 4, no. 1 ) is unique in having a decoration of broad, shallow cut-out bands instead of the usual deep lines. The form of this bowl also looks somewhat more primitive than that of the other necked bowls. Groups of verticals are often broken up by a curious motif like two flails laid across each other. When repeated several times it gives the verticals something of a 'Cornstalk' appearance. Another curious feature of the decorative style of the Zebbug pottery is the frequent occurrence of one or more irregular incised lines running round the interior of the mouths of vases just below the rim. The rims themselves are sometimes milled. The following motifs are recognisable in the normal decoration: semicircles, with a tendency sometimes to take on a rather ogival form (Fig. 6, nos. 1-4, Fig. 7, no. 3), simple zig-zag lines (Fig. 6, no. 6, Fig. 7, nos. 5 and 6), horizontal bands formed by arcs of circles set end to end (Fig. 7, no. 10), and blocks of vertical lines narrowing towards the lower end (Fig. 7, nos. 1, 2, and 4). Some fragments of jars are decorated with lines forming inverted isosceles triangles with the apex resting on the base of the vase. Besides these simple geometric motifs, however, there are numerous more com- plicated arrangements of lines which are not so easily described, and the significance of which will be discussed below. A broad, but rather thin and fragile type of strap-handle is used on the cups and bowls (Fig. 5, no. 3, and Fig. 6, nos. I and 3), but far more common are various types of lugs and lug-handles. These are seen in their greatest variety on the jars, which have a number of different types on the neck and shoulders, viz. large horizontal lug-handles, smaller horizontally- or vertically-pierced knob-lugs, and finally unpierced knobs. The</page><page sequence="17">PREHISTORIC TOMBS NEAR ZEBBUG, MALTA 17 latter may be elongated either horizontally or vertically, and may or may not be decorated with dimples at either end to imitate the pierced lugs (Fig. 6, nos. 5 and 6). Though some of these lugs have a distinct practical use, they also constitute an im- portant decorative feature, since the more complicated incised patterns referred to above are built up around them. The lug-handles, with their slightly bevelled edges, seem to have suggested a pair of eyes, and the idea came of strengthening this by means of a crude arrangement of lines to suggest the rest of the figure. Only such a supposition can make this type of decoration intelligible to us. The feeling once aroused, it was carried over tó the small knob-lugs, and even to the unpierced lugs, which are often provided with dimples to play their part more effectively. Finally, pairs of dimples may occur on a pot independently of the existence of a knob or lug, simply as a nodal point for decoration. The anthropomorphic decoration is extremely abstract and schematised. Usually the head and body are indicated as fused together and almond-shaped, the outline being given by pairs of lines. Arms are indicated by pairs of lines or by single lines, and generally end in three-fingered 'hands'. Legs are never indicated (Fig. 4, no. 2, and Fig. 6, nos. 5 and 6). So far as can be seen, this type of decoration is confined to the jars. On two fragments of necked bowls, however, there appears a tiny human figure, schematised in an entirely different way. These have a triangular head and no body to speak of. Two crossed flails represent, in the one case arms and legs, in the other arms alone, the legs being added separately (Fig* 6, no. 4 and Fig. 7, no. 10). The pottery of the Zebbug tombs is by no means such an isolated phenomenon as was at first thought. Wares of a similar type with similar, often identical, decoration, can be recognised among the material from almost all the temple-sites excavated. It is however, abundant only on sites such as Mgarr and Kordin I and III, where there are buildings of primitive form, having, that is to say, a trefoil or clover-leaf plan. In tem- ples with a more developed plan, and in the large complexes where there is evidence of frequent rebuilding and extension, pottery of the Zebbug type is rare. The bulk of the ceramic material found in them is made up of the well-known wares with pitted, studded, scratched, or scale decoration. The Zebbug pottery would therefore seem to belong to an earlier and more primitive culture-complex than that characterised by the fine ceramics and exquisite spiral and animal designs in stone and paint found at Tarxien and Hal Saflieni. There is, however, a noticeable difference between the pottery of Zebbug type from the temples and that from the tombs themselves, which is expressed both in the shapes and in the decoration. In the tombs the range of shapes is very restricted, and about three-quarters of the fragments seem to belong to bell-necked jars. In the temples, on the other hand, shapes are varied, and in particular various types of cups and shallow bowls are common. Bell-necked jars are comparatively rare, though other types of jar are present. Corresponding to the rarity of the bell-necked jars is the rarity of the anthropomorphic decoration, though it is faintly adumbrated on a few vases. This difference between the tomb and temple finds is emphasised by the existence in Malta, though mostly dispersed in private collections throughout the island, of a fine series of complete bell-necked jars.

This series of jars helped considerably in reconstructing the fragments from Zebbug, and also in understanding the general scheme of the decoration. From them it is clear, for instance, that there were two distinct types of decoration in use for the jars, one pre- dominantly curvilinear, with much use of semicircles and ogival curves, the other (rather commoner) predominantly rectilinear, based on vertical lines and inverted triangles. It is with the latter decoration that the anthropomorphic elements are associated. The jar illustrated (Fig. 4, no. 2) is a good example of the rectilinear style, with the anthropo- morphic features. Parallels are not easy to find abroad for this peculiar and distinctive type of pottery- decoration. However, it is possible to trace certain significant affinities between it and some of the post-Stentinello pottery of Sicily, which is grouped together under the general title of the San Cono-Piano Notaro culture. Among the features common to both are the general arrangement of the decoration, based on from two to four parallel lines, the border of dots, and the occurrence of wavy lines and of bands filled with rows of dots ♦ Single dimples used as a nodal point for decoration are a feature of both wares (Fig. 5, no. 1, and PL II, &amp;, no. 1). The similarities extend to certain of the shapes also. The Zebbug tombs them- selves, however, provide very little illustration of this, since the shapes are so limited, and the main one, the bell-necked jar, appears to be unknown outside Malta. However, the small ovoid jar with bead-rim from Tomb 5 (Fig. 5, nos. 4 and 5) can be paralleled in the material from Piano Notaro,2 and the flat-bottomed dishes from Tombs 2 and 3 can also be paralleled among material from the same phase. Turning to the material of similar style from the Maltese temples, we find that the shallow bowls, particularly an example from Kordin III, can again be closely paralleled at Piano Notaro.3 A type of strap-handle with concave section, which is set on the rim of a cup of some sort, and which is common at Mgarr,4 has exact parallels from the Grotta Zubbia in Sicily.5 Finally, the shouldered bowl with a high strap-handle from Piano Notaro 6 has an almost identical counterpart at Kordin III. While it can scarcely be claimed that either of these cultures was the originator of the other, it may fairly be said that the affinities between them are such as to indicate contemporaneity and a certain amount of mutual influence. The origin of the post- Stentinello phase in Sicily remains obscure, though there appears to be some basic con- nection with the earlier phases. However, the decorative style shows much less cohesion and organic unity than that of the Zebbug type in Malta, and in particular the anthropo- morphic elements are missing in Sicily. It seems possible, therefore, that the affinities may be due mainly to influence exerted from the Maltese side, but until a great deal more work has been carried out in both areas it would be unsafe to dogmatise on this point. Before leaving the discussion of the pottery it will be necessary to say a few words 2 Orsi, Bull. Pal. It., xxxiv, 1908, pl. Ill, 5.

The chronological position of this has been settled once for all by the finding in Tomb 5 at Zebbug of four small painted sherds (Fig. 7, nos. 1 1 and 12), identical in every way with those from the other sites. This painted pottery is not to be confused with the small quantity of painted ware found at the Hypogeum, Borg in-Nadur, and Bahria, which is much later and was probably made under Mycenean influence. It was found at Kordin III and Santa Verna, but the bulk of it comes from Mgarr.7 A careful study of the sherds of this early painted fabric shows that the motifs used conform closely to those incised on wares of the normal Zebbug type. Some fragments also possess lugs of the usual Zebbug types. Finally, at Mgarr there are numerous sherds of a light-faced ware, identical in shapes and decoration with the normal dark-faced Zebbug wares, though in colour and in the coarser quality of the paste and firing they compare with the painted ware. The significance of this small quantity of painted pottery escapes us at present, though it seems most likely that it is the product of a faint and belated influence of the Neolithic painted-ware cultures of South Italy on the Maltese islands. The Zebbug tombs provide us with the only instance so far in Malta in which the non-ceramic aspects of a culture can be with certainty related to a particular type of pottery. Some of these non-pottery objects are themselves of great significance, and may lead us to important conclusions, especially when considered together with the pottery. The remains of the stone and flint industries, with one notable exception, are not of great importance. There are two fragments of limestone vessels and four small flint blades. All of these are finely retouched to a greater or lesser extent, and one (Fig. 9, no. 2) is masterly in its workmanship. The smallness of the blades invites comparison with the flints from the San Cono tomb, but the working on the Maltese implements is finer, whereas arrow-heads, so numerous at San Cono, are completely absent.8 More important for comparisons are the shell beads and pendants, in particular a number of barrel-beads of Spondylus shell. Alone, these would be insufficient to warrant any conclusion, but from Tomb 5 comes a small domical button with V-perforation and an object which is evidently the head of a variety of statue-menhir (PL III). These two objects taken together, in conjunction with the anthropomorphic elements of the pottery- decoration are, I think, sufficient to enable us to assign the Zebbug tombs to a definite phase in the wider development of Western Mediterranean prehistory. In this develop- ment the culture which they represent may have played a very significant role. Buttons with V-perforation made of various substances, such as shell, bone, jet, amber, and even tin, make their appearance in Central and Western Europe at a definite moment, which coincides with the appearance of a number of other well-characterised elements, and generally with the first industrial use of copper. They are found in Danubian III in Central Europe, and in the Mediterranean in the Los Millares, Palmella, Remedello-Rinaldone, and Anghelu Ruju cultures. In South France they are associated with the spread of the complex assigned to Chalcolithic II.9 Pottery of Beaker type occurs in all the cultures mentioned, and V-perforated buttons are found 7 Ashby, Excavations in Malta, 1 908-11, figs. 6 and 25, show the fragments from Kordin III and Santa Verna respectively. Zammit, Bulletin of the Valletta Museum, Vol. 1, No. 1, p. 25, fig. 17, illustrates some specimens of painted wares from Mgarr. 8 For the San Cono flint industry see Orsi, Bull. Pal.

Statue-menhirs seem to form a part of the same cultural horizon. In South France one is re-used as the lintel of a corbelled megalithic tomb.10 Some North Italian examples are armed with a triangular midrib dagger clearly of Remedello type (an object specifically associated with V-perforated buttons at Monte Bradoni).11 In Spain and Portugal they belong to the complexes that produced the elaborately-decorated bone and schist idols, with which they have many features in common - that is to the complexes of Los Millares and Palmella and their equivalents. The nature of the anthropomorphic decoration of the Zebbug pottery leaves no doubt of its connection with the weirder forms of megalithic art in the West. The 'expressionist' technique and phantasmagoric suggestion of the style often achieves a weird and uncanny effect, and its virtual limitation to the bell-necked jars makes one suspect a specifically funerary intention. The two curious schematised figures on frag- ments of necked bowls (Fig. 6, no. 4, and Fig. 7, no. 10) are in a somewhat different style, but even this is distinctly reminiscent of the figures in some of the metal-age rock- paintings of Spain and South France. The Zebbug statue-menhir is unfortunately broken off at the neck, so that the evidence of whatever arms or ornaments may have been carved on the lower part is lost to us. However, it is perhaps worth noting in passing that some of the French statue- menhirs have necklaces, the principal feature of which is a large barrel bead in the centre, similar in shape to the shell ones from Zebbug. The carving of the face of the Zebbug statue-menhir differs in a number of ways from that of the Spanish, French, and Italian ones. One fundamental point is that it is carved in slight relief instead of being cut back into the stone in the manner of the majority of the Western examples.12 A more signi- ficant difference, however, is the indication of the mouth by a conical drill-hole, with a vertical groove joining it to the base of the chin. On the Western statue-menhirs the mouth is normally not indicated at all; the method of indicating it by a dot and line is well known on the pottery plank-idols of Cyprus, though in their case the line generally runs upward to join the nose. These plank-idols are themselves very closely paralleled by the flat schist idols of South-western Spain and Portugal.13 Perhaps it would not be too rash to suggest that we have here in Malta a link in the chain of connection, one which may be further elucidated by future discoveries. There remains to be considered what may be gleaned from the form of the tombs about the external relations of the Zebbug culture. Only two tombs of the San Cono culture are known in Sicily, that of San Cono itself and one other. It is noteworthy, however, that when found these presented the same aspect as those of Zebbug - namely a more or less circular hollow scooped out of the soft rock. It has already been remarked in Part I that the curious form of the Zebbug tombs might well be due to the destruction of the rock in which the upper part of the tomb was worked. This might also have been the case with the Sicilian examples, which were in any case further mutilated by their chance finders.14 The original form might have been either a chamber tomb or a well- tomb. In Malta scanty remains of pottery of the Zebbug type were found mixed with 10 Childe, op. ciV., p. 101. 11 ColinL Bull. Pal. It., xxv. 1800, p. 101. 18 Observation made by Dr. R.

Certain features of the pottery-decoration, and some of the non- ceramic finds, enable us to find analogies farther afield and to relate the culture to those of Palmella, Los Millares I, Chalcolithic II of South France, Remedello, early Anghelu Ruju, and so to the earliest phase of the Beaker expansion in the West Mediterranean. If we may take it that all these cultures were in progress by about the middle of the nineteenth century B.C., then it seems likely that the Zebbug culture must also have been flourishing at about that time. Furthermore, if we allow that certain features, such as the V-perforated buttons, triangular midrib daggers, and statue-menhirs, are ulti- mately of East Mediterranean derivation, we may propose a date slightly earlier than that of any of these for the inception of the Zebbug phase in the Maltese islands.

This was used as a dump for pottery from the neighbouring temple, but a few fragments of Zebbug ware may represent the remains of the original burial. 17 For the Maltese pottery-sequence referred to above see J.
