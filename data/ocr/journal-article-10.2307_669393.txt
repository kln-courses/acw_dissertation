Reviewed by HENRI LEHMANN, Musee de l'Homme, Paris It is a difficult task to cover both pre-Columbian and modern Indian art of Middle America in the same volume. Dockstader, director of the Museum of the American Indian in New York, has faced up to the difficulty and surmounted it. An art historian by background, he has published a work which breaks a new trail, being addressed particularly to devotees of art. His choice of some 250 illustrations deliberately rejects well-known pieces in order to present objects which he feels have been unjustly ne- glected, some of them not previously published. An introduction of about 40 pages provides the novice with a good initiation into the art of the area. The author begins by emphasizing the unique character of this art: "Middle Ameri- can Indian art is a composite of many factors combining to create a form of visual ex- pression which, in the main, exists nowhere else. And it is this fact that makes it an identifiable concept" (p. 21). According to him, Middle American artists preferred to express themselves in pottery figurines, incense burners, clay musical instruments, and masks. Hence, he refers almost solely to pieces of these categories. One of the most obscure problems is that of the origin of art in America. The author advises against drawing hasty conclusions from the cultural analogies which have been noted between America and other continents. On the other hand, within Middle America itself the sharing of artistic concepts convinces him of intense interchanges. Finally, he remarks that the existence of mass production perhaps conceals from us a large part of the cultural activity of ancient times. One can, he says, collect some hun- dreds of the same object, in pottery or in stone, from Chupicuaro, Tlatilco, Veracruz, Copin, or elsewhere; all seem to have come from the same hands, as if each artist had continually reproduced the same work, or had trained a group of students to repeat a unique initial model. "We may be judging some of these cultures by the work of a single individual (or a very small group) within that culture" (p. 24). These cautions stated, Dockstader then provides a chronological table which allows the reader to locate the different pre-Columbian civilizations in relation to each other. He briefly explains the new methods thanks to which American chronology, for long enigmatic, is gradually becoming precise: dendrochronology, radiocarbon analysis, thermoluminescence, obsidian hydration, glottochronology, etc. The analysis of styles takes up about 15 pages. Whoever attempts to draw up an outline of pre-Columbian art finds he must choose between two methods-geographical order or grouping according to large stylistic categories-both of which involve in- conveniences due to the fluidity and interpenetration of styles. It is sufficient to cite the Olmec style, which occurs not only on the Veracruz coast but also in the Maya area and central Mexico. The author opts for the geographical arrangement. He studies successively each region from north to south, and presents the illustrations in the same order. The result, in many cases, is a dispersal which risks annoying the reader, especially if he is trying to use the photographs to familiarize himself with a given style.</page><page sequence="2">Book Reviews 561 The pieces reproduced to illustrate this chapter have mostly been chosen from the collections of the Museum of the American Indian; they possess considerable interest for the European reader who cannot easily see the originals. Some of the inevitable gaps have been filled with objects from other museums, such as the extraordinary Maya wooden anthropomorphic figure in P1. 87. However, several types are still not represented. One thinks, for example, of the pottery showing scenes or activities of daily life, which usually come from Nayarit. These omissions are unimportant for the professional, but they deprive the beginner of many typical aspects of the art of these regions. The chapter titled "Gold, Graves and Scholars" deals with the rediscovery of the American past. Tribute is here paid to the scholars and scientific institutions which have replaced, in Mexico, Guatemala, and Honduras, the guaqueros of the last century. Dockstader speaks chiefly of the work of American institutions, particularly the Carnegie Institution, and notes the fruitful cooperation which exists between some U. S. scientific institutions and certain Latin American countries. For Guatemala, he cites the case of Tikal, where a University of Pennsylvania project is working in col- laboration with archeologists of the Guatemala National Museum. We may add that similarly a Franco-Guatemalan mission has worked at Mixco Viejo since 1954; the scientific explorations are financed by French institutions (Commission des Fouilles and the C.N.R.S.) and the Guatemalan government provides funds for stabilizing and reconstructing the ruins. Colonial art is intentionally excluded from this study. The three centuries following the arrival of Europeans in America are skipped over, in order to take up survivals from the past in recent products of several representative tribes. The gamut is very wide, from the Seri in the north to the Choc6 in the south, the latter being nearly en- tirely South American in culture. The 40 photographs given here as examples corre- spond to nearly as many cultural varieties. Too numerous-or perhaps not sufficiently numerous-they form a disparate mosaic from which one does not know whether to conclude decadence or the nefarious effects of reciprocal influences. From these illus- trations one would hardly guess that they represent a new art, probably the expression of autochthonous traditions. It is strange that the author rejects folk art, which he claims is less authentic. The criticism of detail formulated here does not detract from the fact that the work has achieved its purposes: it contains surprises even for the expert, and it familiarizes the beginner with American pre-Columbian products and modern artisanry. The high quality of Dockstader's work makes the numerous typographical errors even more regrettable. Since the author's corrections never reached the printer, a list of errata is provided. Unfortunately the same errors reappear in the French edition, where moreover the translation leaves something to be desired concerning the technical terms customarily employed by Americanists. It would not seem too much to ask of publishers that they en- trust to specialists the translation of specialized works, and allow authors to review the translations.
