University of Okla- homa Press, Norman. xiv + 162 pp., 16 color plates, 32 black-and-white illustrations, 4 tables. ISBN 0- 8061-2919-0. Cloth, $40.00.-Alexander Skutch needs no introduction to most ornithologists, based on his more than 25 books mostly on ornithological themes. Past books include Parent Birds and Their Young, A Guide to the Birds of Costa Rica (coauthored with Gary Stiles), and his "Life of" series: The Life of the Hummingbird, Life of the Woodpecker, Life of the Tan- ager, Life of the Pigeon, and Orioles, Blackbirds, and their Kin. His Life of the Flycatcher, the latest contribution to this series, is vintage Skutch: a smoothly written, nicely illustrated account of New World flycatcher (Tyrannidae) life histories and daily lives, based prominently on his original observations, and abun- dantly spiced with anthropomorphism and Skutch's sometimes offbeat views of nature. Skutch begins and ends the book with his view that the New World flycatchers are peaceful neigh- bors and devoted parents (with strong family val- ues?). He maintains that the "tyrant" flycatchers are unjustifiably tainted by the image of aggressiveness and belligerence, an impression originating with be- haviors of some kingbirds and relatives, and rein- forced by many of their common names. He then de- scribes the history of such epithets, and renames spe- cies; e.g. Torrent Tyrannulet (Serpophaga cinerea) be- comes Torrent Flycatcher. Besides an introductory chapter (The Flycatcher Family) and his final defense (Flycatchers as Neighbors), he details their lives in nine additional chapters: Food and Foraging; Daily Life; Dawn Songs and Flight Songs; Duets, Greet- ings, and Nest Songs; Courtship; Nests; Eggs and In- cubation; The Young and their Care; and Enemies, Defense, Nesting Success, and Longevity. I applaud Skutch for pulling this material on a single avian family together into one volume. He also weaves into the text discoveries by many other students of fly- catchers so as to give a more balanced view of the whole family than his own, largely tropical, obser- vations would allow. All the chapters are interesting, in part because Skutch does a good job identifying unusual behaviors and adaptations of this diverse</page><page sequence="2">January 1998] Reviews 267 family. I learned something new from most chapters, for example how some flycatchers roost socially at night, and how they respond vocally to a mate from inside the nest. I enjoyed his debunking of myth (p. 83): "Great Crested Flycatchers (Myiarchus crinitus) and related species frequently add strips of shed snakeskin to their nests, possibly, as some naturalists have surmised, as a talisman to hold nest-plundering snakes aloof, but more probably because these exu- viae are soft and flexible, like shreds of cellophane or plastic that are also found in birds' nests." My fa- vorite example of anthropomorphism occurs on p. 49: "The impression that the singing Yellow-bellied Elaenia (Elaeniaflavogaster) is angrily self-assertive is intensified by his flattened crest, like the laid-back ears of a resentful horse." As in other books in this series, statements are ref- erenced only by chapter bibliographies, not individ- ually, which will inhibit tracing sources of some statements. Overall, however, the book is reader- friendly. A six-page index references species, illus- trations, authors, and subjects. The prose flows smoothly. He asks many "why" questions (e.g. why do flycatchers sometimes join mixed-species flocks?), and keeps his answers and arguments nontechnical. The 16 color plates and numerous (excellent) line il- lustrations add considerably to the work, but this is not quite as lavish a coffee table book as Skutch's pre- vious "Life of" works due to the scaled-down format and to the fewer and less ambitious color plates. I think this book will appeal particularly to those who wish to watch tropical birds, to those interested in flycatchers or bird natural history in general, and to graduate students looking for research questions. The several tables and voluminous facts or anecdotes stimulated me to think about why some flycatchers build certain kinds of nests and how this is related to their phylogeny and life history, why some species have particular anatomical characteristics such as rictal bristles or long tails, how flycatchers commu- nicate with each other (e.g. What is the role of crests in so many species?), why some species have unusu- ally long incubation or nestling-feeding periods, why emancipated males in some species do not ap- pear to be sexually selected, what determines the un- usual array of flycatcher social systems including di- verse variations on a theme of monogamy, why some species nest near wasp nests, what determines nest- ing success, and what determines clutch size. Skutch himself addressed some of these questions, but often I was unsatisfied that he considered alternative hy- potheses as thoroughly or persuasively as he could have. I was disappointed that Life of the Flycatcher did not reflect more of the recent research on New World fly- catchers, although I recognize that it was not intend- ed as a state-of-the-art review. His chapter on food and foraging was not as up-to-date and lively, for ex- ample, as the "Sallying Forth: a Flycatcher's Baede- ker" chapter in Steven Hilty's book (Birds of Tropical America: A Watcher's Introduction to Behavior, Breeding and Diversity). I also found Skutch's accounts of duet- ting, twilight and flight songs, flocking and migra- tory behavior, and demography superficial consid- ering the available literature. Finally, I think that Skutch's spin-doctoring of flycatchers as generally benign and family oriented works against him in this book, because it tends to obscure the grandeur of tyr- annids' adaptive and social radiation, a theme that is not well developed. For example, several Caribbean kingbirds (including Loggerhead Flycatcher [Tyran- nus caudifasciatus], Giant Flycatcher [T cubensis], and Gray Flycatcher [T dominicensis]) kill other birds more often than Skutch admits, and Piratic Flycatch- ers (Legatus leucophaius) certainly do not do their "hosts" any good. In summary, I recommend that both the text and artwork be savored by a wide or- nithological audience as a very readable and richly detailed natural history account of a fascinating fam- ily, and as a kind of memoir by a giant among orni- thologists.-THOMAS W.
