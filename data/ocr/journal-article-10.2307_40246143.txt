<plain_text><page sequence="1">Proust Fifty Years Later ANNA BALAKIAN ABSTRACT Although Proust's literary fortune has remained high and international, recent assessment reveals profound change in critical attitudes. Proust has been transformed from a painter of an era into an existential writer concerned with reality, mortality, solitude, and sexuality. His search for meaning in a nonanthropocentric biosphere makes him relevant to the novelists of the ab- surd and to the structuralist critics, but they overlook the poetic character of his universe. Its inherent analogical unity and the aesthetic solace it generates separates Proust's world from the unstructured one of his alientated successors. (AB) Since Proust lived fifty-one years, the centennial of his birth was quickly followed by the half-century mark of his death, pro- viding ample opportunity for assessment of his literary fortune. In one brief year so much was written about him, so many special numbers of magazines devoted to him, that to gauge the inventory of opinions becomes a monumental exercise in itself. The power of his prevalence and presence can actually best be measured not by the length of the cumulative bibliography of critical writings about him but by the fact that he has entered into the frame of reference of so many writers both on the basis of his creative values and for his technical developments in the novel genre, which led far beyond the frontiers of French literature. Proust has indeed ceased to be the special property of the French and now belongs to the heritage of Western literature. The author of one of the best books on Proust, Leon Pierre-Quint, observed as early as 1931 that each successive gener- ation would find in Proust what had priority in its own scale of values. He concluded that these changing interpretations would constitute the best evidence of the work's viability and richness of meaning.1 The first wave of interest in Proust seemed to have been moti- vated by curiosity about him as a person and about the true 93</page><page sequence="2">94 COMPARATIVE LITERATURE STUDIES identity of the characters of his fiction. It was a process of dis- mantling the Proustian creative clock to discover its human com- ponents and the factors of time and chronology. Anais Nin in her Novel of the Future likened this process of study to the unraveling of a knitted sweater.2 In this kind of research, it is the personality of Proust that comes through as a product of the elements and circumstances that may have shaped it. These studies, such as Harold March's The Two Worlds of Marcel Proust, George D. Painter's and Philip Kolb's bio- graphically oriented studies, and so many others, seem to be based on the Sainte- Beuvian concept that if you know the tree you can savor the fruit- that knowledge of the man and his environment presumably leads us to a better comprehension of the work and the world it represented. Indeed, Painter thinks of A la recherche du temps perdu not as a real work of fiction but as "a creative autobiography," and many manuals of literary history still main- tain that what Proust did was to paint the waning French aristocra- cy of the turn of the century and that he left a magnificent fresco of a world he knew so well because he was not merely a witness of it but a distinguished participant. That this is a very partial approach to the understanding of Proust seems obvious in retrospect, for we have come a long way from the time when art's role was deemed to be primarily repre- sentative. Actually, the biographical approach to Proust is one that goes counter to his own concept of literary criticism. In the essay significantly entitled Contre Sainte-Beuve he pleaded for the sepa- ration of the work of art from the author's personality. He ex- pressed astonishment that in the case of Stendhal those who knew him personally should have assumed that they were most com- petent to judge his human and literary worth. On the contrary, thought Proust, a man in his personal context displays a behavior quite disparate from his creative personae. It would therefore follow that the search in the daily life for the elements that make the genesis of the work of art comprehensible is a futile pursuit. In the case of Stendhal, Proust suggests that future generations will better understand his work precisely because they will be removed from the presence of the writer's private personality. He concluded that a book "is the product of another T than the one we manifest in our habits, in society, in our vices."3 Modern criticism has been moving in line with Proust's points of view rather than with Sainte- Beuve's. This fact throws an ironic color on the early critical</page><page sequence="3">PROUST FIFTY YEARS LATER 95 writings on Proust, which led essentially in search of the author. Another element that long fascinated Proust's early audiences was his power to recapture a lost society. Commenting on this aspect of the novel, Pierre Abraham, the past editor of the periodi- cal Europe and one of the last survivors of Proust's generation, makes a cogent observation in his monograph on Proust that was written in 1931 and reissued in 1971. He suggests that if Proust's virtue lay in representing a tableau of a certain milieu, he could claim nothing original: in La Foire sur la place of the multi- volumed Jean-Christophe , Romain Rolland had in 1908 presented the same ambience? And if Proust's work was principally the portrait of a neurasthenic, narcissist dandy, there would have been too many competitors for the honor of having brought to literary fulfillment that common archetype. Yet, the man and his milieu, the power of transfer from the world of reality to the world of fiction, not only preoccupied those of his contemporaries who were attracted to his work but has continued to interest successive generations of scholars and critics, for Proust was particularly tempting as a subject for psychoanalysis and challenging to that power of scholarly detective work which has long motivated our sleuths of erudition. The most recent of these studies is one by Albert Fournier that traces in detail (and some are excellent), we must, in the light of radically changing attitudes, classify them as purely paleolithic criticism as far as studies of Proust are concerned. Another angle from which Proust's work has been viewed is that of the ideas it reflects. There is a group of writers on Proust who consider his work a poor excuse for fiction. They throw the spotlight on his reflections, his whims, his failings, his idio- syncrasies, his opinions on music, painting, politics, poetry, death, love, and other themes. They align him with the tradition of the great essayists: Montaigne, Rousseau, Thoreau, Chateaubriand. From that vantage point, Proust's work becomes a "journal in time," and its interest lies not in the movement of his characters on the chess board but in the consistencies and fluctuations of his rich mind. In other words, although no one has gone so far as to establish a consistent system of philosophy in Proust, his work has been categorized as a medium for auto-identification and has in many instances been dismembered into philosophical, moral, or aesthetic abstractions.</page><page sequence="4">96 COMPARATIVE LITERATURE STUDIES Of course, the device that launched Proust and most frequently catalyzed critical interest in him is probably his particular handling of the faculty of memory. In preparation for this essay, as I reread some of the old criticism, I was amused (not to say amazed) to note the amount of contradiction there is about Proust's power of memory. Some (the larger number) believe that he was over- whelmed by the very weight of a cumbersome and profuse memo- ry; others attribute his confusion of chronology to the faulty character of his recall. Samuel Beckett contended in an essay written in 1931 that Proust suffered from a very weak memory: "Proust had a bad memory .... The man with a good memory does not remember anything because he does not forget anything. His memory is uniform, a creature of routine, at once a condition and function of his impeccable habit, an instrument of reference in- stead of an instrument of discovery."6 Proust is, of course, supposed to have been influenced in his handling of memory by Bergson's sense of time, or rather of du- ration, which involves the measureless character of moments lived in intensity in a distant past with the moment of their spontaneous remembrance in an immediate present. Indeed, much has been written about the fact that in Proust we can find two types of memory: voluntary memory, with the chronological, rationally re- membered events of the past; and involuntary memory, with its more vivid though less structured visions, of which the celebrated example is the cup of tea and the madeleine that trigger the most cherished memories of Proust's childhood. What has always sur- prised me in the unending references to this minor incident in Proust's work is that no one seems to question the authenticity of the alleged spontaneity. This, despite the fact that we have access to his workbooks, which were a far cry from the automatic dic- tation of the involuntary activity of memory as recollection culled in authentic samplings of stream-of-consciousness exercises before and after Proust's time. As one reads the many scholarly analyses of time remembered and time recaptured, the portrait that looms is one of a sick and unhappy man, seeking his release from an unpleasant reality by escape through a benevolent power of memory into a happier past, miraculously preserved for him. Another strong basis of Proust's early popularity among critics and fellow writers was the contention that, along with James Joyce and Virginia Woolf, he was among the first to experiment with the</page><page sequence="5">PROUST FIFTY YEARS LATER 97 interior monologue or stream of consciousness. It is primarily to this process that a certain disorganization in his work has been attributed. This flexibility of narrative form is what made Edmund Wilson place Proust with the group of avant-garde writers of the turn of the century. That was in Wilson's Axel's Castle, which did much to spread the fame of Proust in America. If, therefore, Proust came to be considered a master craftsman in the rendering of objective reality through the reconstruction by memory of the salons and personages of his childhood and youth, his utilization of the natural currents of reminiscences as a tech- nique made him seem at the same time, the master of intimate writing, the deft magician who lets the reader look into the ka- leidoscope of his consciousness, to identify totally with the author's eye and mind, of its projection into a presumably ficti- tious character. It is the combination of this power to subjectify and objectify at the same time that spelled out for Proust's early admirers his superiority over most of the novelists of his time. This combination of the macrocosm and microcosm of life seemed unparalleled in literature. Finally, the theme of homosexuality, which was a novelty and a taboo in fiction in Proust's generation, gave to his work a noto- riety, as it did to Gide's that also in some measure helped spread his fame. Among critics it became a game to discover and follow up the changes of sex that occurred in Proust's personae as they moved from real life to their life in his world of fiction; detailed exegeses have been given of the transmutation of characteristics as the homosexual relationships were transformed into heterosexual concepts of passion, jealousy, and suffering. The famous line Proust uttered to Gide was that "everything is permissible if one does not say T "7 and in reading assiduous critics one sometimes gets the impression that their allocation of permissiveness to Proust far exceeds the writer's intentions. What really dis- tinguished Proust's attitude toward homosexual relationships from Gide's is that Proust, unlike Gide, did not take a militant attitude toward making homosexuality morally acceptable; he used it rather as a metaphor to represent alienation of every variety and probed the effects of separateness on human behavior as a whole. If, for some of the reasons just summed up, Edmund Wilson and others of his generation placed Proust in the avant-garde of modern novelists, we also know that the mid-century renovations of the</page><page sequence="6">98 COMPARATIVE LITERATURE STUDIES novel form have left Proust, as well as Joyce and Virginia Woolf, far behind. When we search for references to Proust in the critical writings of Nathalie Sarraute, Alain Robbe-Grillet, Michel Butor, and others, we find that they treat him with respect but strictly as a paleolithic writer. The attitude is that writers whom we admire cannot necessarily serve as our guides. Sarraute 's comment is typi- cal: "For most of us, the works of Joyce and of Proust appear already far away like the witnesses of a finished epoch. The time is not very far off when we shall visit them only with a guide; among groups of school children, in respectful silence, and with a somewhat mournful admiration, as one visits historical monu- ments."8 Others more modest tell us that Proust had to be dis- carded as a model simply because one could not have improved on him. To understand why the new novelists treat Proust as dated, we must try to view him in relation to some of the basic theoretical changes that have occurred in the very notion of the novel. In the most recent approach to psychological truth, the author no longer gives the reader the privileged position of mind reader or of sharer of the author's experience. The monologue is no longer a confidential aside or unheard and unspoken speech but, on the contrary, spoken and presumably heard discourse. It is no longer an interior musing but an oral soliloquy. Not enough nonnovelist critics make this very significant distinction in the innumerable writings that have appeared about the new novel. Nathalie Sarraute describes the difference very clearly: "One begins now to under- stand that one must not confuse under the same label the old analysis of feelings and this stage, necessary but outgrown, with the process of setting into motion psychic forces unknown and to be constantly discovered; no modern novel can do without them."9 She adds that, like a map maker, Proust by his minute interpre- tations takes away the reader's own liberty to explore empirically the material at hand. There is in the new novel a distinct shift in the position of the reader. He no longer identifies with the speaker of the narrative but with an emblematic and uninvolved listener, an analyst, or judge, or high inquisitor, who hears the confession or deposition as the speaker of the narrative seeks, not self-illumination, but sympathy and emotional release. Sartre triggered the shift in perspective when he took to task François Mauriac for playing God with his characters.10 Sartre</page><page sequence="7">PROUST FIFTY YEARS LATER 99 pointed out that authenticity of psychological insight demanded a choice on the part of the author. Either he could take exclusively the point of view of his hero and look at the world from that vantage point, or be the outside observer, who would not know ahead of time what reactions the characters could have to each other. When the author explicates the characters ahead of time, said Sartre, there is no chance of discovery on the part of the reader. Application of the criticism to Proust would mean that be should not have had to tell us in an aside that Tante Lêonie was speaking sincerely ; the dynamics of verbal discourse should have made the sincerity self-contained. Heeding, as it were, Sartre's admonition that there is no place for a privileged observer in fiction, novelists are more and more abstaining from the omniscient position of the paleolithic novelist. The reader, in turn, no longer able to be a mind reader, becomes instead a listener, who knows no more nor less than the exterior evidence, and he makes his psychological deductions from speech, parole, which is presumed to reveal the natural ambiguity of personality rather than to serve as a means of clarification. As the phenomenologist philosopher Merleau-Ponty has said, "conscious- ness is the locality of the equivocal."11 The revelations that the novelist makes are no longer of intentions shared by the protago- nist with the reader but in the presentation of direct, raw speech with its capacity to communicate truth and deception, conscious revelation as well as what we have come to consider the "Freudian slip," that is, truth without intention, or betrayal through the word. In other words, it takes two to reveal the truth, including at least an awareness of another person's presence; and very often it is through the verbal communication with another that we are best revealed to ourselves. Recent writers have become aware that for this type of speech to be truly revelatory, it has to appear fairly devoid of stylization and resemble as much as possible demotic or ordinary speech, without any evident effort at literary embellishment or highlighting. This is one of the major reasons Faulkner and Hemingway are given such high ratings by recent European critics of the novel. It has been suggested that the reason we find so many tramps (or clochards) in the modern novel is that they are precisely the people who speak most naturally, and often out loud, even when nobody appears to be listening. We can give as examples, of course, Beckett and Genet, who have</page><page sequence="8">100 COMPARATIVE LITERATURE STUDIES admirably succeeded in suggesting nonaffected speech as the basic approach to character. Where does all this leave Proust? As far as character revelation through speech is concerned, Proust does not measure up to the new novelists. He does not possess the ear for demotic speech. Educated and uneducated alike share Proust's elegant patterns of speech, and parole can hardly be in his work a device for psycho- logical revelation. Illustrative of this inauthenticity of language is the elegant apostrophe Françoise addresses to Combray. But Proust does make valiant efforts to avoid playing God with his characters. He tries to take a single point of view at a time in viewing locus and persona, and he tries to leave with his reader the equivocal aspect of the consciousness of his characters. If he enters the consciousness of Swann as well as that of the young and older Marcel, his "I" is the focal point through which all other persons are seen and gauged. I say "he tries" because he slips time and again into secrets of the human heart that go beyond the under- standing of the eavesdropper. If an element of reductiveness can- not be avoided in the expository nature of the narrator's estimate of character, Proust nevertheless manages to preserve an element of mystery as we meet and drop off and then meet again his charac- ters, and the process of cumulative delineation does not produce a resolved clarity. In that sense, Proust is closer to the new novelists than are his contemporaries. In fact, misled by the intentional ambiguities in his work, the Russian social realists have been led to call Proust an impressionist. Writers of the nouveau roman, like Nathalie Sarraute, while approving the ambiguities in Proust, tell us that we love Proust for the wrong reasons: for his embellished style, on the one hand, and, on the other, for extrafictional reasons, such as curiosity about his life, interest in the degree of realism he introduces into his writing, and concern for the amount of personal identification we can find with our own idiosyncracies in the overt, so-called psychological explanations he so often proffers for motivations and behavior. The truth is, says Nathalie Sarraute, that it is not through a uni- versally recognizable reality that a novelist survives; rather, he prevails by having been able to discover a small, heretofore un- recognizable patch of reality: "it can happen that isolated individ- uals, maladjusted, lonely, morbidly hanging on to their child- hood and self-centered, cultivating a more or less conscious taste of a certain form of failure, succeed in abandoning themselves to</page><page sequence="9">PROUST FIFTY YEARS LATER 101 an apparently useless obsession, to grasp and bring to light a parcel of reality yet unknown."12 The new novelists and critics see this uniqueness filter through Proust's images and metaphors as if he were a medium. These are considered psychologically more symptomatic than his explanations, and instead of throwing light on precise verities, these paradigmatic emblems are supposed to widen the frontiers of human knowledge about experience and existence. If Proust's intentional psychology makes the new novelists blush, his minute indications of body signs, movements of objects, metaphoric prolongations of sensory perceptions, give them in- sights into those dark corners of personality that are allegedly far more telling than Proust's own commentaries about these phenome- na. Not through the free-form unraveling of his thoughts or through the reportage of experiences but through his isolated descriptive precisions does Proust anticipate techniques appreciated by the new novelists. There is, for instance, the famous scene at the end of Du côté de chez Swann when the eye of the narrator observes from outside a window the relationship between Mile Vinteuil and her sapphist friend. Insofar as Proust describes the compromising gestures of the two young women, he is in the realm of the modern, sympto- matic technique of narration; but when he starts interpreting these gestures and supplies conjectures, the voyeur is turned into analyst and moralist, and falls into the category of the paleolithic novelist. A book by Gilles Deleuze, entitled Proust et les signes and written in 1964, opened up this entirely new field of Proustian studies. It sought to deliver Proust from the position of "great psychologist of memory" and to place him as a semeiologist in the ranks of more contemporary novelists. Such an observation as the following, gleaned from Le temps retrouvé , is given as evidence that over and above the personal reminiscences, Proust's work con- tains the hieroglyphics of a master alchemist: "II fallait tâcher d'interpréter les sensations comme les signes d'autant de lois et d'idées, en essayant de penser, c'est-à-dire, de faire sortir de la pénombre ce que j'avais senti, de la convertir en un équivalent spirituel."13 Proust's conclusion in the passage just quoted was that the sensations identifiable with reminiscences were part of a meaning- ful grimoire, or Mystic Book, and that to get at the relationship of meanings was to be like a deep-sea diver, plucking treasures from</page><page sequence="10">102 COMPARATIVE LITERATURE STUDIES the abyss. The power of reading signs corresponded to the harvest- ing of the treasures of the sea; the diving was the act of creation; the treasure, the resulting work of art. In fact, we can go back to the beginning of the long novel and find this same attitude: "Alors, bien en dehors de toutes ces préoccupations littéraires et ne s'y attachant en rien, tout d'un coup un toit, un reflet de soleil sur une pierre, l'odeur d'un chemin me faisaient arrêter par un plaisir particulier qu'ils me donnaient, et aussi parce qu'ils avaient l'air de cacher, au delà de ce que je voyais, quelque chose qu'ils m'invitaient à venir prendre et que malgré mes efforts je n'arrivais pas à découvrir. Comme je sentais que cela se trouvait en eux, je restais là, immobile, à regarder, à respirer, à tâcher d'aller avec ma pensée au delà de l'image ou de l'odeur." To approach Proust from this angle is to view all the personal experiences he describes as independent phenomena participating in an alchemic rebus, becoming part of an enigma whose answer is not reducible to abstract rationalizations but identified as an in- corporated and immanent physical force of the biosphere. This monistic view of the universe of Proust would tend to bring his work right in line with the chosism of the new novelists. In this view, Proust's greatness no longer consists of his power to derive essence and spirit from the remembrances of things past; it no longer depends on his revelation and elucidation of personal and interpersonal behavior, through the filter of memory and the attitude of meditation; it becomes, instead, his power for occul- tation and mystification: the expository elements begin to be viewed as secondary to the immanence of masks and to the in- trusion of symptomatic, uncommented observations. Here is how Jean-Noël Vuarnet sums up what the new reader is supposed to find in reading Proust: "The work, then, becomes a search, an explication and development: its object is not to convey the visible, but to render visible (significantly the sentence is borrowed from an observation of Paul Klee about modern painting). What a modern work renders visible is not, obviously, the character but rather something which without it would not appear: the relationship of force and intensity, the play of masks, the meaning."14 For such appraisers of Proust, his descriptions of decor- as in the salon of Mme de Villeparisis, of Odette de Crécy, or of Tante Léonie- are the exterior poles between which the inner eye establishes its mysterious currents. The world of Marcel Proust is</page><page sequence="11">PROUST FIFTY YEARS LATER 103 likened to the paintings of Gustave Moreau.15 It is an imaginative world if we define the power of imagination in a certain modern way: as the construction of images based on physical reality where- in the actual choice of the components and their relationship is symptomatic of the psychic chemistry of the artist. This is how certain modern critics interpolate what we used to label the aes- thetics of an artist. The radical difference is that what used to be attributed to the sensitivity and arbitration of the artist is now an emergence through him: the work of art writes itself through the author, as the structuralists say. This gives Proust's work a totally empirical character and places it under the aegis of Marx and Lévi-Strauss. As we know, and as fifty years of Proust scholarship have been telling us, there is paradoxically both continuity and discontinuity in Proust's A la recherche du temps perdu. Discontinuities of narration and of the emergence, disappearance, and development of the characters are held together by the continuity of the Proustian personality and vision. Older critics have been in the habit of sustaining the continuity over the discontinuity by high- lighting the egocentric character of Proust's world and the personal, spiritualized stamp and color that the objective world in its various stages and facets assumes as it is confronted by this highly complex intelligence. The phenomenological approach to Proust cultivates, on the contrary, the discontinuity, for according to the precepts of Lévi-Strauss and his followers, this discontinuity is an essential factor in the rational understanding of phenomena, which, as he believes, delivers the work of art from the solipsism of its author. Thus, all that Proust tells us of the subjectivity of his world is now often minimized in favor of statements taken out of context to substantiate the empirical assumptions. Has not Proust told us that our knowledge of a person is based on our own personality, that his visions of exterior objects were actually inscapes rather than landscapes, bordered with a spiritual aura? Actually, Proust work is so rich that his transformation can be achieved as easily as the one Flaubert has been undergoing at the hands of Sartre and of the structural critics. One of the interesting results of the new look at Proust is that it tends to erase the old antithesis between Zola and Proust; it used to be pointed out that although both were reared in the Beauce valley, their works were poles apart. Now it appears that the antith- esis existed only when you looked for social reality in the work</page><page sequence="12">104 COMPARATIVE LITERATURE STUDIES of art and in Sainte-Beuvian fashion detected the effects of person- al culture and environment in the work of the author. But when La Terre and A la recherche du temps perdu are juxtaposed in terms of phenomena and objects perceived, and the interaction of human and inert matter, they presumably become parallel samplings of archeological and anthropological data of the same geographical region.16 To pass to another question, how do the new novelists view Proust's handling of the elements of time and memory, heretofore considered his trump cards? Of course, the new novelists are much more interested in the present than in the past; in fact, one critic, Jean Bloc Michel, entitled a book about the nouveau roman Present of the Indicative to emphasize the character of immediacy so prevalent in the new novel. The distinction made by the experi- mental novelists in the handling of time is not in terms of volun- tary and involuntary memory (or, if you will, spontaneous versus intentional recapture of time past). Rather, they take note of the difference between chronological passage of time and the intensely lived moments of life. Perhaps Frank Kermode has best defined this distinction, in his appropriation of the Greek terminology, in his book Sense of Ending. Applying this terminology to Proust's mnemonic mechanism, we might suggest that when his narrative is a straight-line one, he is within the time measurement of chronos, and that when he has incidents such as the madeleine, he falls under the spell of kairos. Modern novelists are interested only in kairos. In viewing Proust from the perspective of the theoreticians of the new novelists, we find a definite challenge to the earlier notion that Proust's handling of time was Bergsonian. Some of the modern novelists believe that they are better disciples of Bergson than Proust was because of their emphasis on the present rather than on their total or partial recapture of the past. But to quote a fundamental concept of Bergson in Matière et mémoire: "The past can be grasped by us as past only if we follow and adopt the movement by which it blooms in the present image, emerging from darkness into broad daylight."17 In other words, Bergson ex- plained the sense of acute time-duration as the composite presence of time past, present, and future. The gradual and lately dra- matic disappearance of the historical tick-tock seems to be in the modern novel the triumph of kairos over chronos. We find it in</page><page sequence="13">PROUST FIFTY YEARS LATER 105 Anais Nin, in Alain Robbe-Grillet, in Djuna Barnes; and in William Burroughs' Naked Lunch, where we follow the character in the throes of drug addiction into those open pits between tock and the next tick, which seems to be suspended in infinity. If Proust learned from Bergson the preservation of time, the re- construction of the past, the freedom from sustained narrative chronology, yet according to the criticism of the new novelists he is not totally Bergsonian. They believe that the great lesson to be learned from Bergson is not to juxtapose past with present, or to stop at the discovery of the kairos moments of the past, but to draw the experience of memory into the anatomy of the present experience. The reshuffling of the time factor is no longer based purely on mnemonic structure, on memory's invasion or dis- turbance of chronological sequence. There is another mechanism at work: the failure of memory, the forgetting process that makes time stand still, or proceed in a circular, obsessive motion rather than in a straight forward or backward direction. Anais Nin explains this mechanism in Winter of Artifice: "The loss of memory was like the loss of a chain. With all this fluidity came a great lightness. Without memory I was immensely light, vaporous, fluid."18 In other cases- for example, in Cortâzar, in Beckett, in Alain Robbe-Grillet- this alternate remembering and forgetting destroys the notion of beginning and ending, replacing them with the sense of simultaneity and in fact of immobility. In the Labyrinth is a novel where a man's memory or failure of memory is emblematically present in a box that he carries around in an eternally present moment where the total absence of tick- tock makes it possible to begin and end the novel on any page. To make concrete the difference between Proustian time and the new time, let us assume that Proust looked at the distant past through a magnificently clear telescope with lenses that he constantly polished to achieve precision, illumination, and in effect, conquest. On the other hand, some of the new novelists who consider Proust an ancient monument are viewing the past in their narratives with lenses intended as reading glasses to clarify objects near them. It must not be concluded that they don't have the finer instrument for viewing distances. Perhaps they possess it, perhaps not. The point is that their interest in memory is not to keep the past reality alive but to clarify the immediate present by giving it the blurred but thicker stratification of meanings through the two-way mechanism of remembering and forgetting.</page><page sequence="14">1 06 COMPARATIVE LITERATURE STUDIES When it comes to the sexual question in Proust, modern critics or readers are not dazzled by his rather innocuous descriptions of homosexuality or its transfer to the heterosexual plane in Proustian characters. The discussions of love have been transformed into studies of eroticism, in which the point of interest no longer seems to be the nature or the process of crystalization of love for Proust or for his chief characters, nor the emotions that sexual desire catalyzed, such as idealization and suffering. There is, rather, in the studies of sexuality in Proust's work a search for sexual symbols immanent in the text itself, symbols of which Proust may or may not have been aware. In other words, if early critics were interested in finding the clues to Proust's life in his work, now the interest lies in finding the psychic data and sex obsessions of which he may not himself have been conscious. A recent article of this nature would have us believe that every pointed shape in Proust's descriptions of objective reality is in- herently suggestive of the male organ and every rounded form refers to woman's breasts.19 Imagine the symbolism of a gothic church with its steeples and domes as described by Proust and ex- plicated by a sex-obsessed structuralist! The fact is that since sex in the new novel carries very little affective implications the emotional power of suffering, the suspicions, the paroxysms of sublimation, are all lost as values on the positive ledger of Proust's survival as a relevant writer in the eyes of these moderns. As a result, the study of love in Proust, so long a happy hunting ground for the scholar, and so long also one of the more pleasurable ele- ments for the reader, is now transformed into a laboratory for erotic specimens and for their cool, unemotional examination and calculation. Actually, the most direct relevance of Proust to the latest gener- ation of novelists and critics no longer appears to be the discovery of his power as lay psychologist of the society he knew and con- veyed so well, nor of his joys and sufferings in interpersonal re- lationships. Rather, it is the existential anguish that is perceived over and above the psychological truths that earlier generations had discovered and highlighted in Proust's work. In other words, suddenly Proust becomes closer to Pascal and maybe to Heidegger than to memorialists such as Montaigne and Rousseau. We had thought that Proust's long and intimate novel had brought to his readers a close relationship with a man, unique,</page><page sequence="15">PROUST FIFTY YEARS LATER 107 unusual, of the kind that Rousseau had in mind when he said, "When God made me he destroyed the mold." We had thought that we admired him for the qualities that made for his difference and unusualness rather than for his resemblance to us. But writers commenting on Proust today find, by reading between the lines rather than by accepting his expression of self, the collective (un- conscious) psyche, the ability to pass from the "I" or the "he" that is another form of the "I" to the "we" or the "one," to the level of the basic human condition; the fear of death, of the aging of man, of the deterioration of relationships, of the irony of human motivations, of the loneliness of man in the universe. From this vantage point, we find Proust obsessed with the Orpheus legend and the Theseus adventure, with the quest, the search in forbidden zones, and with the confusions and alienations as he observes on all sides the devastating effects of an indifferent world. We may answer that in the world of Proust art triumphs over the human condition. Although pessimism may be a leitmotiv through all Proust's volumes, there is enough of a network of meaningful activities and enough of a euphoria provoked by contacts with people and the beauties of nature to lay the foundation of the eventual victory of the essence of the artist over the negative ele- ments of human existence. That triumph is, we dare say, magnifi- cently evident in the final volume, Le Temps retrouvé, as Germaine Brée and a number of other major critics of the past have pointed out. But just as it is possible for modern critics to view eroticism minus passion and emotion and thereby to bring Proust closer to our time, so too does it seem intelligently, cleverly possible to over- look the redeeming surges of meaningful existence in Proust's world and to make of him a brother to the alienated antiheroes of the novels of the absurd. The fact is that the death of God and of the anthropocentric universe has manifested itself in literature in various steps. The first stage implied absence after presence, the sense of mourning of the father no longer there to guide his creatures. Then comes a stage of alienation, in which that absence is no longer a cause for mourning but triggers resentment against the absurdity of the non- intentioned and nonanthropocentric universe. Scientists like Jacques Monod, on one hand, and novelists like Robbe-Grillet, on the other, have recently been telling us that there is a third step, that beyond the anguish and beyond the sense of the absurd is a stage of acceptance of the indifference of haphazard movement of</page><page sequence="16">108 COMPARATIVE LITERATURE STUDIES the biosphere. Man has to rid himself of the pathetic fallacy, they argue, and no longer consider the natural world as his accomplice; in rejecting this illusion he will be rid, at the same time, of his sense of tragedy. In his article "Nature, Humanism, Tragedy," Robbe-Grillet suggests that our notion of tragedy is based on man's unsuccessful attempts to relate to a presumably inherent design. He claims that tragedy disappears when the fable of intentionalism is debunked. There is no longer any struggle to find the missing links of the pattern when you know that whatever pattern there is falls together without conscious intent. How has this evolution been made evident in literature? The alienation and loss of destiny is basic in Kafka, in Camus, in the nausea of Sartre's Roquentin. When we come to more recent writers such as Robbe-Grillet and Beckett, we find them setting their narratives adrift in an entirely soulless space; we have indeed reached the decentralization and dehumanization of the universe. "Man looks at the world and the world does not respond," as Robbe-Grillet puts it. Or as Beckett's Molloy says, "I listen and the voice is of a world collapsing endlessly, a frozen world, under a faint untroubled sky." Indeed, recent studies argue that Proust acknowledged the non- anthropocentric character of the universe and that his weapon of defense in the midst of the desolation was his irony. His irony, it must be said, looms larger when demonstrated by structuralist methods of study of the writing itself than it did in the previous biographical approaches, which based their generalizations on the relationship between the man and his work. But Proust is not so conveniently turned into a novelist of the absurd. If as we reread him closely, we discover the amazing proof that in his descriptive technique he largely avoided attributing affective qualifications to nature, we must also observe that he did not thereby reject nature or drift into indifference toward the vegetable world. In fact, he is closer to the precepts of the new scientists than are the new novelists, who seem to have misread the scientists as well as misread Proust. Neither in the philosophical writings of Monod nor in those of the earlier Heisenberg can one find the somber conclusions implicit in Robbe-Grillet 's nameless hero or Beckett's Molloy or Moran. Neither Monod nor Heisenberg suggests that the loss of the myth of intention precludes the possibility of man's setting his own design and purpose on the uni- verse. Heisenberg's conclusion is that the subject of scientific</page><page sequence="17">PROUST FIFTY YEARS LATER 109 research is not nature separated from man, but nature subjected to the human interrogation. This is precisely the position the surrealist André Breton had taken. Very much aware that man was in need of a new humanism to relate to the fact that he could no longer presume to be the center of the universe, nonetheless he felt that he could still relate to nature's metamorphic cycles and, instead of feeling alienated, introduce his own anthropomorphic design into the universe. Proust, even before Breton, but more succintly and less axio- matically, accepted the nonanthropocentric universe but refused to renounce man's self-initiated analogical pact with nature. What separates people like Breton and Proust from the new novelists is that they are poets and that the concept they really refused to give up is that of beauty: in man and in nature. Through the use and practice of beauty, Proust is forever separated by a tremendous abyss from his successors in the development of the novel. If he does not attribute to nature the feelings of the human heart, as did the romanticists, he maintains throughout his copious volumes the thread of the contact he established from earliest childhood with nature. The wisdom of the true poet lies in the comprehension that by the link between the subjective world and the objective reality surrounding it, man overcomes the drifting, dehuman- izing effect of isolation and the ensuing sense of the absurd, un- related movement in the vortex of an unpatterned universe. When the narrator in Proust's novel is disillusioned in his re- lationships on the psychological level, his triumph lies on the aes- thetic level, regardless of all the traumas that grim philosophers may find in his writing. The triumph is there because, as for André Breton, under every stone there is a message for Proust as he walks through his labyrinth of high society and rural landscapes. It is early in Du côté de chez Swann that he says: "Je trouve très raison- nable la croyance celtique que les âmes de ceux que nous avons perdus sont captives dans quelque être inférieur, dans une bête, un végétal, une chose inanimée, perdues en effet pour nous jusqu'au jour, qui pour beaucoup ne vient jamais, où nous trouvons passer près de l'arbre, entrer en possession de l'objet qui est leur prison. Alors elles tressaillent, nous appellent, et sitôt que nous les avons reconnues, l'enchantement est brisé. Délivrées par nous, elles ont vaincu la mort et reviennent vivre avec nous." If, as has often been observed, love in Proust's works is only a one-way affair in which the central character projects his</page><page sequence="18">110 COMPARATIVE LITERATURE STUDIES sublimation of the love onto a character most often unworthy of that love, so is it also true that his eye projects its own sense of beauty, its own intensified scope of reality, on the intermittent ardor of the "aubépine," on the bells of Saint-Hilaire as they strike his hallucinated ears, and on so many other manifestations of the natural or human world. He may have been deceiving himself, but the fact remains that the love he projects into nature has as great a fortifying power for him as the love he remembers of his mother or grandmother. Basically, the richness of the world of Proust in the long view is not based on the multiplicity of his relationships but on his power of association, whether with a parent or mistress, or inert object, or the vegetable world; the joy he derives in a life bound by pain and loneliness and frustration is not really through the restoration of the past but through the ever enlarging of his subjective reality, what Baudelaire had called before him "l'expansion des choses infinies." Basically, Proust is a poet in the modern sense of poet first defined by Rimbaud. One of Proust's most recent commentators, Georges Dupeyron, has asked how we can "judge the quality or non-quality of a work, since the judgments themselves are challengeable? "20 Proust made sure to include in his monumental work enough variety of self and universe to satisfy the changing tastes of many generations to come. If the gossip about high society becomes a bore to in- creasingly egalitarian societies, if the artifices of fiction exasperate the fervent postulants of authenticity, Proust is quite as capable of surviving "la belle époque" as Homer survived the Trojan War. As the critic George Lucasz pointed out, when all is said and done the constant gauge of rich writing is the richness of the inner life. ANNA BALAKIAN • New York University NOTES 1.
