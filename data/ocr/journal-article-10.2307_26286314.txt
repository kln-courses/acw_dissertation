<plain_text><page sequence="1">"greening" postcolonialism: ECOCRITICAL PERSPECTIVES Graham Huggan What do a polemical report on dams, a (pseudo-)philosophical treatise on animal welfare, and a novel about elephants have in com mon? They are all legitimate objects of the practice of ecocriticism, both a critical method and an ethical discourse that "takes as its subject the interconnections between nature and culture, specifi cally the cultural artifacts of language and literature" (Glotfelty xix). With "one foot in literature and the other on land," ecocriticism is primarily a "study of the relationship between literature and the physi cal environment"; but its mandate also extends to the fields of envi ronmental philosophy and bioethics, where "as a theoretical discourse, [it] negotiates between the human and the nonhuman [worlds]" (Glotfelty xviii-xix). And what if the works in question are by an Indian, a South African, and a Canadian writer, respectively? What if each, in its own way, articulates resistance to authoritarian habits of thought and value-systems, connecting these clearly to the domi nating practices of imperialist and/or neocolonialist regimes? Clearly, there are grounds here for a productive overlap between the tasks of ecocriticism and those of postcolonial criticism, opportunities for a fruitful alliance between the two critical/theoretical schools that opens up new aesthetic horizons, as well as offering food for political thought. By comparing three recent postcolonial works—Arundhati Roy's The Greater Common Good (1999), J. M. Coetzee's The Lives of Animals (1999), and Barbara Gowdy's The White Bone (1998)—that offer insight into ecological issues and relationships, this essay asks M£ MFS Modern Fiction Studies,Volume 50, number 3, Fall 2004.

"greening" postcolonialism: ECOCRITICAL PERSPECTIVES Graham Huggan</page><page sequence="2">702 "Greening" Postcolonialism: Ecocritical Perspectives what contemporary postcolonial and ecologically oriented literary/ cultural criticism might have to offer one another at a time of global environmental crisis. Deep ecologists might argue that postcolonial criticism has been, and remains, resolutely human-centered (an thropocentric); committed first and foremost to the struggle for so cial justice, postcolonial critics have been insufficiently attuned to life-centered (eco- or biocentric) issues and concerns.1 A growing body of work exists, however, to suggest a convergence between the interests of postcolonial and ecologically minded critics (see, for ex ample, Adams and Mulligan; Ashcroft, Griffiths, and Tiffin; O'Brien; Platz ["Greening" and "Literature"]; Sluyter). From recent reports on the devastating impact of transnational corporate commerce on lo cal/indigenous ecosystems (Young) to more theoretically oriented reflections on the efficacy of postcoionial literatures and/or literary criticism as vehicles for Green ideas (Head), postcolonial criticism has effectively renewed, rather than belatedly discovered, its com mitment to the environment, reiterating its insistence on the insepa rability of current crises of ecological mismanagement from histori cal legacies of imperialistic exploitation and authoritarian abuse. Conversely, recent evidence can be cited of a "postcolonial turn" in environmental criticism and philosophy that combats the tenden cies of some Green movements toward Western liberal universalism and "[white] middle-class nature-protection elitism" (Pepper 246), and that rejects the lunatic-fringe misanthropy that hovers at the edges, and threatens to discredit, some of the more radical schools of ecological thought (Curtin 18-20).2 Deane Curtin's Chinnagounder's Challenge: The Question of Ecological Citizenship is a paradigmatic example here, arguing that moral debates about land use, bioethics, and the rights of (threatened) indigenous peoples are always cultur ally coded, and that cross-cultural understanding is needed as much as an ability to decide what is right or wrong in any given event. "What makes sense as a preservation strategy in the first world," argues Curtin, "often has disastrous consequences in the third world" (5). Curtin's concern echoes frequent complaints from Third World scholars (for example Gadgil and Guha; Guha; Shiva) that First World environmentalism, in assuming that its protest rhetoric and pallia tive measures are universally applicable, runs the risk of turning itself into another, late-capitalist form of "ecological imperialism" (Crosby; see also Curtin 5-7, 18-20). No one would dispute that Western environmental groups have been effective in attracting nega tive publicity for, say, technocratic World Bank/IMF-sponsored devel opment programs, several of which (the Green Revolution, for in stance) have ironically emerged as examples of cultural arrogance masquerading as global philanthropy. But in seeking to foist their</page><page sequence="3">Huggan 703 ethical/intellectual agenda onto non-Western peoples and cultures, some of these groups risk being seen as arrogant in their turn; or, at best, as distractingly naive in their ritual invocation of anthropocentrism as the root-cause of the world's ills (Arnold and Guha 19; see also Curtin 100). This essay takes its cue from Curtin's conviction that global "ecological citizenship" requires commitments to human, as well as wider ecological justice, engendering the recognition that nature has extrinsic, as well as intrinsic value for us all. (After all, as Curtin says, "the view [held by several prominent radical ecologists] that nature has only intrinsic value is strangely anti-ecocentric since it implies that humans are not part of nature" [189].)3 It also tries to answer Curtin's call for a carefully case-based, historically contextualized analysis of contemporary social and environmental problems. My analysis, therefore, weighs the advantages of a plural istic "cross-cultural ethical discourse" against the implicit arrogance of First World (neo)liberalism (164) and seeks to add ecocritical per spectives to a number of fundamental postcolonial debates. Among these are what Gayatri Spivak calls the "worlding" of the Third World (Spivak, In Other Worlds), the ambivalent role of the postindependence state in brokering national economic development, and, not least, the value of imaginative writing as a site of discursive resistance to authoritarian attitudes and practices that not only dis rupt specific human individuals and societies, but might also be seen as posing a threat to the entire "ecosphere" and its network of inter dependent "biotic communities" (IMaess).4 The essay also gives a recent postcolonial twist, acutely conscious of its cultural location, to the longstanding debate within environmental ethics on the reconcil ability or not of (liberal) animal-rights and (radical) ecocentric posi tions.5 Finally, it offers some thoughts on the cultural construction of the "ecological subject" (Dobson 54-55), and on the implications for postcolonial, as well as ecological criticism of entering into the imagi native world—the collective consciousness—of other sentient crea tures. Ecocriticism, at present, is a predominantly white movement, arguably lacking the institutional support-base to engage fully with multicultural and cross-cultural concerns (Glotfelty xxv; see, how ever, Buell, especially Writing; Murphy; Slaymaker). Similarly, eco logically related contributions to postcolonial criticism have tended until fairly recently to focus on the former (also predominantly white) "settler cultures," taking in such issues as the use of territorial meta phor to reflect changing patterns of land use and spatial perception, the geopolitics of colonial occupation and expansion, the rival claims of Western property rights and Native/indigenous title, destructive</page><page sequence="4">704 "Greening" Postcolonialism: Ecocritical Perspectives encounters between conflicting ecosystems, and the mutual entangle ment of biological and cultural factors in providing the ideological basis for imperial rule (Carter; Crosby; Darian-Smith et al.; New). Several of these studies are arguably motivated, at least in part, by a sense of collective historical guilt and vicariously experienced trauma, and are not always sufficiently alert to the temptations of "imperialist nostalgia"—a closet ideology the practitioners of which are given to mourn what they themselves have helped destroy (Rosaldo 69-70).6 It seems useful, in this context, to turn to contributions from non-Western environmental scholars, as well as to case studies from other parts of the world that explore the intersections between postcolonial and ecological concerns. Unsurprisingly, predominantly literary scholars are outflanked here by those working in other—or across other—academic disciplines. Within the vast interdisciplinary field of South Asian studies, for instance, the sociologist Ramachandra Guha's historical account of the Chipko (Himalayan peasant antideforestation) movement in the 1970s, and the ecofeminist-ac tivist Vandana Shiva's analysis of the disastrous consequences of the Green Revolution for subsistence-farming communities in late-twen tieth-century Punjab, serve as twin reminders that ecological disrup tion is coextensive with damage to the social fabric; and that envi ronmental issues cannot be separated from questions of social justice and human rights. In documenting histories from below, both schol ars mount an indirect challenge to what Ania Loomba (following Spivak) has called the "overworlding" of the Third World—to that well-intentioned, but unmistakably Western-elitist construction of the Third World as a locus of anti-imperialist resistance, the overpower ing rhetoric of which risks silencing the very masses on whose behalf it claims to speak (Loomba; see also Spivak [Critique; In Other Worlds}-, and O'Hanlon).7 Yet Guha's and Shiva's primary concern is less with the West or Western imperialism per se than with the neo colonialist imperatives of the postindependence Indian state. This "centralized management system," in pursuing "a policy of planned destruction of diversity in [both] nature and culture" (Shiva 12), has actively sought to impose a homogenizing late-capitalist vision of economic progress most obviously beneficial to the nation's ruling elite (Guha 195-96). The state's coercive allocation and manage ment of natural resources can be seen as a postcolonial version of ecological imperialism in which it becomes clear that "the forced march to industrialisation" has had disastrous cultural, as well as ecological effects (Guha 196). For Shiva, there are thus two symbiotically re lated crises in postcolonial India: an ecological crisis brought about by the use of resource-destructive technological processes and a</page><page sequence="5">Huggan 705 cultural/ethnic crisis emerging from an erosion of the social struc tures that make cultural diversity and plurality possible (12, 235). Guha and, particularly, Shiva stand behind the work of Arundhati Roy, whose fulminating essays "The Greater Common Good" (1999) and "The End of the Imagination" (1998), capitalizing on the run away success of her Booker prizewinning novel The God of Small Things {1997), probably represent the most eye-catching ecocritical intervention to date by a recognized postcolonial writer. The essays first published separately as cover stories for two mainstream En glish-language Indian magazines, Outlook and Frontline, and later repackaged for the international mass market as The Cost of Liv ing— are clear attempts to reach out both to a local readership famil iar with their controversial issues (the Narmada Valley Project in the first essay, India's decision to go nuclear in the second), and to an international audience possibly unaware of, and probably uninformed on, either issue, but sufficiently attuned to Roy's success to grant her work another look.8 The essays are deliberately designed, that is, as a politically motivated publicity venture that, riding on the back of Roy's recently accorded literary celebrity status, seeks to attract and, ideally, convert large numbers of readers both in her home country and elsewhere. Now, it would be easy here to catego rize Roy as another media-hungry Indo-Anglian cosmopolitan celeb rity (Brennan; Mongia), or to see her as placing a well-timed stake in the latest popular humanitarian cause. Certainly, in the first essay mentioned above (on which I shall concentrate here), Roy takes rhe torical liberties with her disempowered Adivasi subjects, converting them into mythologized victims in her own highly personal moral crusade against the tyrannies of the modern Indian state. And cer tainly, she is aware throughout the essay of the constitutive, but also distortive, role of the global media in constructing the latest, highly visible human/ecological catastrophe as a newsworthy "event" ("Greater" 47, 50, 63; see also Rowell 282-86).9 But Roy, as in her previous work, is not only interested in manipulating publicity for her own, and other people's, interests, but in showing how publicity—or, in this case, the mediated language of the common good, the na tional interest—achieves its magical effects. Hence the ironic title of her essay, which reflects on the ways in which a centralized state has not only commandeered national assets and resources, but has also sought through media channels to convey the fiction of a carefully monitored "national progress." The fiction of "national progress" de mands that government be "abstracted out of the messy business of politics," thereby releasing it for the Utopian task of "receiving inputs from all parts of society, processing them, and finally allocating the optimal values for the common satisfaction and preservation of soci</page><page sequence="6">706 "Greening" Postcolonialism: Ecocritical Perspectives ety as a whole" (Chatterjee 160). Technological know-how is an es sential instrument of the "magic of the State" (Taussig, Magic). And such expertise, in the hands of the few, requires the self-sacrifice of the many: Place all your prayers at the feet of the sarkar, the omnipo tent and supremely enlightened state, and they will be duly passed on to the body of experts who are planning for the overall progress of the country. If your requests are consistent with the requirements of progress, they will be granted. (Chatterjee 160) These, in Partha Chatterjee's appropriately sardonic terms, are the grounds for Roy's ecological fable of the Narmada Valley Project: the ill-fated postindependence irrigation scheme, affecting hundreds of thousands of lives, that is usually considered to be "India's Great est Planned Environmental Disaster" (Roy, "Greater" 44), and that is sometimes seen, in "the congealed morass of hope, anger, informa tion, disinformation, political artifice, engineering ambition, disin genuous socialism, radical activism, bureaucratic subterfuge, [and] misinformed emotionalism" that surrounds it ("Greater" 9), as a metonymy for the self-consuming narrative of modern India itself (Preface n. pag.). A few facts may be helpful here. India is the third largest dam builder in the world, having built over three thousand big dams in the fifty-odd years since independence (Roy, Preface n. pag.; McCully). Of these dams, several of the largest and best-known belong to the state-administered Narmada Valley Project, spanning three states (Gujarat, Maharashtra, and Madhya Pradesh) in central India. This hugely ambitious project, first dreamed up more than forty years ago and still—despite massive protests and a legal stay, now lifted, against further construction—10 considered to be a viable proposi tion, conceives of building "3,200 dams that will reconstitute the Narmada [river] and her forty-one tributaries into a series of step reservoirs—an immense staircase of amenable water." Two of these dams, the giant Sardar Sarovar in Gujarat and the Narmada Sagar in Madhya Pradesh, will hold "more water [between them] than any other reservoir on the Indian subcontinent" (Roy, "Greater" 33). The project aims to provide electricity and safe drinking water for mil lions, while irrigating millions of hectares of infertile farming land. From its inception, however, the project has been fraught with prob lems, proving in many people's eyes to have been massively miscon ceived. Hundreds of thousands of local people, mostly Adivasis, have been ousted from their land, with irreparable damage being done to their daily lives, their economic self-sufficiency, and their culture.</page><page sequence="7">Huggan 707 Evidence suggests that the project may consume more electricity than it produces, and that its state-of-the-art flood-warning and irri gation systems have had a damaging—in some cases, devastating effect on the very land the dams sought to protect, the very crop yields they promised to increase. The astronomic cost of the project, heavily subsidized by the World Bank until its forced withdrawal in the early nineties, has helped push "the country [further] into an economic bondage that it may never overcome" (Roy, "Greater" 35). Widespread dissent, mobilized around the powerful Narmado Bachao Andolan (Save the Narmada Movement), has been violently sup pressed. All in all, as Andrew Rowell summarizes it, the Narmada Valley Project, conceived in the dinosaur development era that deemed megaprojects the panacea for the world's energy prob lems, has been nothing short of a human and ecological catastrophe, ... an example of the neglect of local com munities' needs and views in the development equation and the state repression against dissent when communi ties want to have their voices heard. (282) But the story, as Roy knows, is not limited to the facts, de pressing though these may be. For the project and, particularly, the big dams at its center have also played a symbolic role in the devel opment of India as a modern nation (Roy, "Greater" 15; McCully 1). As Patrick McCully puts it, Perhaps more than any other technology, massive dams symbolize the progress of humanity from a life ruled by nature and superstition to one where nature is ruled by science, and superstition vanquished by rationality. They also symbolize the might of the state that built them, mak ing huge dams a favourite of nation-builders and auto crats. When a dam is given such a powerful symbolic role, its economic and technical rationale and potential nega tive impacts fade into insignificance in the decision-mak ing process. (237) Big dams, in other words, suggest a potentially deadly alliance be tween the modernist ideology of technological gigantism and repres sively authoritarian politics of state ownership and control (Roy, "Greater" 91-92). This alliance is further cemented by transnational commer cial interests. The international dam industry, as Roy points out, is worth $20 billion a year. If you follow the trails of Big Dams the world over, wherever you go—China, Japan, Malaysia,</page><page sequence="8">708 "Greening" Postcolonialism: Ecocritical Perspectives Thailand, Brazil, Guatemala—you'll rub up against the same story, encounter the same actors: the Iron Triangle (dam jargon for the nexus between politicians, bureaucrats and dam construction companies), the racketeers who call them selves International Environmental Consultants (who are usually directly employed by dam-builders or their subsid iaries), and more often than not, the friendly neighbourhood World Bank. ("Greater" 35-36)11 The national allegory of statist abuse Roy constructs around the Narmada Valley Project thus gradually widens out into an eco logical "war for the rivers and the mountains and the forests of the world" ("Greater" 52). At the same time, the narrative Roy spins out takes on the dimensions both of antistatist fable, quasi-Dickensian in its moral intensity—"[The state is] a giant poverty-producing ma chine, masterful in its methods of pitting the poor against the very poor" ("Greater" 28)—and of cautionary tale on the ecological price to be paid when "human intelligence . . . outstrips[s] its own instinct for survival," and "twentieth-century emblems" such as big dams and nuclear bombs become "malignant indications of a civilisation turning upon itself" ("Greater" 101). If Roy's message is crystal-clear, unashamedly partisan in its intentions, her text remains a curiously unresolved mixture—part hard-headed investigative report, part sentimental political fable,12 part historically situated postcolonial allegory, part universal Green manifesto and call-to-arms. The different narrative strands cut across and contradict one another. Facts are needed to illustrate the enor mity of the story, but its teller also complains of suffocating statistics and the state's own version of "Fascist Maths" ("Greater" 72). The breathless language of fable is ironized on numerous occasions— "Nobody knows this, but Kevadia Colony is the key to the World. Go there, and secrets will be revealed to you" ("Greater" 73)—only to be reinstated, writ doubly large, on just as many again: Who knows . . . what the twenty-first century has in store for us. The dismantling of the Big? Big bombs, big dams, big ideologies, big contradictions, big countries, big wars, big heroes, big mistakes. Perhaps it will be the Century of the Small. Perhaps right now, this very minute, there's a small god up in heaven readying herself for us. ("Greater" 12; see also God of Small Things) Complex social, political, and ecological systems—as if to counter the technocrat's with the storyteller's magic—are repeatedly reduced to the black-and-white dramatics of the children's morality tale ("Greater" 15, 24, 41). In the end, the standard format of the eco</page><page sequence="9">Huggan 709 logical heroes-and-villains story, however ironically manipulated, proves to be no match for contemporary postcolonial realities.13 In deed, it raises the question of whom Roy believes herself to be speak ing for (Adivasi "oustees"? The Narmada Bachao Andolan? Interna tional environmental activists and "eco-warriors"?14 The Indian people?)—an open question that blurs the boundaries between the underclass victims of ecological disaster and their privileged sup porters (Gadgil and Guha), and that makes Roy vulnerable to the criticism that she is silencing those on whose behalf she wishes to speak. Roy's tirade against the state seems to want to claim a vic tory for the people ("Greater" 48-49). But which people? As other commentators have pointed out, it is already oversimplified to say that the political battle in the Narmada Valley is a basic conflict be tween "the state" (in the Blue Corner) and "the people" (in the Red); there are also numerous conflicts between different sections of the people and different branches of the state, while even within the Narmada resistance movement there are factional splits between different groups, each of which sees itself as acting in the people's interests (Singh 1; see also Fisher and Omvedt).15 Roy's text thus draws attention to at least two different modes of the "worlding" of the Third World to be found in certain postcolonially inflected forms of environmental protest writing: the first of these launches a right ful attack on a quintessential^ neocolonialist "Iron Triangle" (politi cians, bureaucrats, and corporations, with International Aid back ing), which has exploited the progressivist ideologies of Third World economic development for its own immediate ends; the second risks amounting to a further subalternization of some of the Third World's poorest people, whose stories are told—in English—so that we privi leged First-Worlders, and our Third World middle-class counterparts, might help them "resist." "The Greater Common Good," for all its overdramatized pieties, remains a highly intriguing text—not least because, like the autocannibalizing tiger that provides its first and most arresting image (Roy, Preface n. pag.), it effectively deconstructs many of its own best arguments by drawing attention to itself as a playful piece of highly literary investigative writing.16 This raises the larger question of how to harness the resources of aesthetic play to reflect on weighty philosophical/ethical issues, as well as to serve a variety of "real-world" needs and "direct" political ends. This dilemma has been central to the work of the South African writer J. M. Coetzee; and it is to Coetzee's staged philosophical debate-cum-ecological trea tise, The Lives of Animals, that the essay brings me next. The Lives of Animais, although initially given in 1997-98 as a pair of university lectures, is characteristic of Coetzee's work in pre senting complex philosophical/ethical debates in self-consciously fic</page><page sequence="10">710 "Greening" Postcolonialism: Ecocritical Perspectives tional terms. The main body of the text consists, accordingly, of two mock-lectures—"The Philosophers and the Animals" and "The Poets and the Animals"—given by a fictive Australian novelist (Elizabeth Costello) at an equally fictitious college (Appleton University) in the United States. The lectures, amply documented, use the expository discourses of philosophy and literary criticism to offer a scattered series of provocative comments on contemporary bioethical abuses, the self-justifying claims of philosophy, and the case for animal rights. The simulated form of the lectures allows Coetzee to reflect ironi cally on the gap between ivory-tower academicism and real-world social practice while drawing together, at the same time, a number of fictional (literary) and non-fictional (scientific) sources to produce a cannily displaced apologetics for the sympathetic imagination.17 It is the more particular form on which the lectures draw, namely the beast fable, that interests me most here, since, as I will suggest, it is by means of this traditionally anthropocentric genre that Coetzee is able to explore contradictions in the competing moral and intellec tual discourses that surround ecological debates on the exploitation of nonhuman resources in the postcolonial world today. It seems fitting, then, that Elizabeth Costello should choose to build the first of her lectures, "The Philosophers and the Animals," around a kind of counterbeast fable, Kafka's satirical "Report to an Academy" (1925), in which a learned discourse on the evolutionary process is presented by that most urbane but also most melancholy of figures, Red Peter, a civilized African ape. The subversive potential of Kafka's fable has not been lost on postcolonial critics, probably most notably the American anthropologist Michael Taussig, who uses it both to attack those historical "othering" processes that helped produce, and justify the domestication of, "colonial wildness" (,Mime sis xviii), and to celebrate the sympathetic magic of an "ape aping humanity's aping"—the dizzying, but also enabling, spiral of postcolonial "mimetic excess" {Mimesis 245).18 And it is not lost ei ther on Elizabeth Costello, who in recasting herself as a late-twenti eth-century, antipodean version of Red Peter, diverts the anthropo centric axioms of beast fable away from their usual targets—the frailties of humanity—using them instead to test the very limits of the human: the capacity for reasoned thought (Coetzee 40). The continuing mistreatment of animals, Elizabeth suggests, is insepa rable from the arrogant belief in sovereign reason, a belief that has historically been used to legitimize dominion over the entire animal kingdom, as well as over large numbers of allegedly "inferior" mem bers of the human race (Coetzee 22-23, 98-99; see also Singer 231-32 and Wise, especially chapter 1). The whole history of West ern philosophy, she further implies, can be read as a litany of ex</page><page sequence="11">Huggan 711 cuses, justified in the name of reason, that have permitted the treat ment of animals and, by extension, the "natural world" as a replenishable human resource (Coetzee 23-25, 29). Reason, for all the philosophers' claims, is neither "the being of the universe nor the being of God"; on the contrary, it may be no more than "the being of a certain spectrum in human thinking" (Coetzee 25). Yet Elizabeth is faced here with the seemingly insuperable task of arguing against reason while remaining bound within it. Her unsympathetic daugh ter-in-law Norma, a professional philosopher of mind, is dismissive of her efforts: "There is no position outside reason where you can stand and lecture about reason and pass judgment on reason" (Coetzee 80); while even Elizabeth herself recognizes that "reason will [always] validate reason as the first principle of the universe— what else should it do? Dethrone itself?" (29-30). It is here that the double coding of the fable and its moralizing counterparts, the par able and the allegory, come in useful. For while beast fables are traditionally thought of as bodying forth the universal truths that might provide grounds for moral action, those such as Kafka's (or, in a different context, Swift's—see the postlecture discussion of Gulliver's Travels in Coetzee's 96-99), aim rather, to interrogate the episte mological procedures by which such truths are revealed. In the pro cess, the fable secretes its secondary meaning as "a fiction invented to deceive" ("Fable" def. Id) sovereign reason, while hardly dethroned, is at least effectively challenged by drawing on a speculative form of moral discourse that ironically illustrates the inadequacies and apo rias of Western logical thought.19 There is more, however; for Coetzee—as in all his work—is not only concerned to challenge the certitudes of reason, but also to undermine those "discourses of power" that claim reason for their own (Huggan and Watson 4-5). Anthropocentrism emerges as one of these discourses; colonialism is a second; "phallogocentrism" is a third (Derrida).20 At the same time, the lectures reveal the difficulty of speaking on behalf of animals who, as Elizabeth Costello senti mentally puts it, "have only their silence left with which to confront us" (Coetzee 30); of speaking the international language of human/ animal rights from a "marginal location" (Attridge 171);21 and of speaking at all without falling into the familiar patterns of speech, and repeating the same self-serving clichés, that validate the view of those who believe the world is theirs, and language theirs to shape it. In this last context, the graphic analogies Elizabeth draws (for instance, between the mass slaughter of farm animals and the geno cide of the Jews—[Coetzee 20-21, 82-83]) arguably betray a star tling lack of cultural sensitivity;22 while even the most convincing of her critiques reveal authoritarian traces of their own. Hence the irony,</page><page sequence="12">712 "Greening" Postcolonialism: Ecocritical Perspectives presented by one of her opponents, the philosophy professor O'Hearne, that the animal-rights movement she so fiercely supports, deriving as it does from other Western philanthropic movements, risks becoming "yet another Western crusade against the practices of the rest of the world, claiming universality for what are simply its own standards" (Coetzee 103-04). Hence the irony, acknowledged by Elizabeth herself, that "[a]n ecological philosophy that tells us to live side by side with other creatures justifies itself by appealing to an idea, an idea of a higher order than any living creature . . . [an] idea, finally, . . . which no creature except Man is capable of compre hending" (Coetzee 91).23 And hence the irony that her discourse, for all its altruistic sentiment, frequently betrays self-interested motives, not least by offering a confused mixture of liberal do-goodism and Christian eschatology in which the mission to save lives becomes a displaced quest for self-redemption, and the triumph of the spirit is imaged in symbolic hierarchies of self-denial—from vegetarianism to asceticism, from the abjuration of meat to the mortification of the flesh (Coetzee 65, 107,117-19). The lectures can be seen, in fact, as another of Coetzee's for ays into the guilt-ridden, occasionally death-driven, territory of lib eral thought. Like her closest literary descendant, Elizabeth Curren in Age of Iron (1990), Elizabeth Costello appears to embrace her own extinction as the member of an endangered species, a self acknowledged "dying breed" (Huggan, "Evolution"). Certainly, her lectures are permeated with the smell of death, most of all her own (Coetzee 43). As O'Hearne surmises, "there is ... a collapse of the imagination before death . . . [which provides the] basis of our fear of [it]" (Coetzee 110). This is the condition, he implies, from which the septuagenarian writer is suffering—a suggestion apparently con firmed in the final scene in which her son John, taking his exhausted mother in his arms and attempting to console her, whispers ambigu ously in her ear, taking in "the smell of cold cream, of old flesh. 'There, there,' he whispers in her ear. 'There, there. It [Your life?] will soon be over'" (Coetzee 122). Transformed into another of her own long-suffering animals, Elizabeth herself becomes the subject for a fable—the ironic terminus of a locked debate that, begun in the spirit of defiance, ends on a plaintive note of self-defeat. Yet if the argument for animal rights seems to rest, here as elsewhere, on human insecurity, the sympathy that Elizabeth invokes, and in turn attracts, is not so easily dismissed. She is sentimental to a fault, but her sentimentalism can still engage us—as in her halting attempt to explain the Utopian gesture of embodying animals "by the process called poetic invention that mingles breath and sense in a way that no one has explained and no one ever will" (Coetzee 89).</page><page sequence="13">Huggan 713 The literary representation of animals, she suggests in her second lecture, has historically been dominated by anthropocentric conven tions. One of these is fabular abstraction, "where the animals stand for human qualities: the lion for courage, the owl for wisdom, and so forth" (Coetzee 83); another, romantic primitivism, disdains abstract thought in the search to represent embodied experience, yet de pends upon it nonetheless (see the discussion of Ted Hughes's "jag uar" poems in Coetzee's 89-90). The attempt to represent the "natural world" is inescapably Platonic; no surprise, then, that Elizabeth's own literary-critical discourse is caught in similar traps. While her work is primarily concerned with the representation of fictional ex perience (as in her "pathbreaking" feminist novel on Joyce's literary antiheroine Marion [Molly] Bloom),24 she believes that her success in rendering this experience into words provides conclusive evidence that she can "think her way into the existence" of any living being: If I can think my way into the existence of a being who has never existed, then I can think my way into the existence of a bat or a chimpanzee or an oyster, any being with whom I share the substrate of life . . . [T]here is no limit to the extent to which we can think ourselves into the being of another. There are no bounds to the sympathetic imagina tion. (Coetzee 49) This optimism, however, proves to be largely unfounded. The Pla tonic dilemma remains: in her first lecture, for instance, she be comes, not Red Peter himself, but the idea of Red Peter—as if to confirm her own suspicion that there is no access to embodied expe rience other than through the channels of abstract thought. The iro nies begin to multiply again: fables, pushed to their interpretive lim its, turn into versions of themselves, thus generating other fables; ecologism itself becomes a fable of the impossible attempt to escape anthropocentric thought (Coetzee 91-93, 99). These conundrums, as so often with Coetzee, have no rational solution; rather, they require, if the fiction of intersubjective experi ence is to be sustained, a leap of imaginative faith. In this context, Elizabeth, for all the irony at her expense, may yet be validated. In her first lecture, she quotes disapprovingly from an essay by the American philosopher Thomas Nagel, who maintains that the re sources of the human mind, powerful though these are, cannot suf fice for us to know what it is like to be another, to grasp "a funda mentally alien form of life" (Nagel 168, qtd. in Coetzee 42). Nagel is right, up to a point, but are animals (his main example is a bat) necessarily alien to human consciousness? And what is the imagina tive faculty if not the attempt, defying the limitations of human con</page><page sequence="14">714 "Greening" Postcolonialism: Ecocritical Perspectives sciousness, to enter the experiences—even the inner experiences— of lives other than our own? "The poet and the philosopher" : it seems like the setting for another of Coetzee's ironic fables. But as Nagel grudgingly admits, "It may be easier than I suppose to transcend inter-species barriers with the aid of the imagination" (172, note 8). In this sense, at least, Elizabeth's claims on behalf of the sympa thetic imagination are neither as naive nor as eccentric as some of her opponents might like to think. Turning now to Barbara Gowdy's prodigiously imaginative novel about the lives of African elephants— and taking a leap of faith myself—I shall ask not so much whether she can "think her way into the existence" of other creatures, but how she can, and what might be at stake. In Coetzee's text, animals are functionalized in a drama of hu man mortality and suffering—one in which the attempt to reach out to the animal world, to inhabit the mental and emotional space of animals' lives through a sustained act of sympathetic imagination, is counteracted by the ironic awareness of animals as objects of hu man desires and needs: objects of exploitation and abuse, objects of charity and affection. This unresolved dilemma points, in turn, to the problematic of animal representation, registering a tension between what the visual theorist Steve Baker calls (after the philosopher Kate Soper) "animal-endorsing" and "animal-sceptical" views of art. The former view, says Baker, "will tend to endorse animal life itself (and may therefore align itself with the work of conservationists or . . . animal advocacy)"; the latter "is likely to be sceptical not of animals themselves (as if the very existence of nonhuman life was in ques tion), but rather of culture's means of constructing and classifying the animal in order to make it meaningful to the human" (9). This tension, everpresent in Coetzee's text, is also maintained in Gowdy's novel, which confronts the impossible task of making animals speak without humans speaking for them, of rescuing animals from the "instrumental characterisation" to which human history (Baker 175)— including literary history—has consigned them, converting them from passive objects for human use into self-willed "ecological subjects" (Dobson 54-55).25 Gowdy goes about her aim, in part, by transforming the literary genre of the animal fable, a genre deployed traditionally to support moralistic, often highly conservative views of the human educational process and, more recently, to prop up the social hierarchies and disciplinary regimes that legitimize imperial rule (Fernandes 7-49; see also Vance). More specifically, Gowdy draws on a source in which both of these aspects come together—Kipling's popular miscellanies for children, the Just So Stories (1980) and Jungle Books (1894 95). Gowdy's elephants have much in common with Kipling's eel</page><page sequence="15">Huggan 715 ebrated jungle creatures: they talk, debate, and interact with one another within a stratified social structure; they inhabit a quaintly honor-bound, quasi-Biblical realm of religious legend and cosmogenic myth. But there the resemblance ends. For one thing, Gowdy's el ephants, unlike Kipling's beasts, are endowed with a painful con sciousness of their condition—a consciousness largely shaped by the memory of who they (individually) are, and what they (collectively) must once have been (Gowdy 83,148). And for another, unlike Kipling's dutifully rewarded colonial subjects, they are condemned to move through a shiftless postimperial world defined as much by human as animal savagery—a world in which the fragile network of ecological alliances on which they previously depended for their safety has been thrown violently, perhaps irrecoverably, out of place: The emergénce of humans did not, as is widely assumed, initiate a time of darkness. On the contrary, in the first generations following the Descent [the advent of human beings, originally descended from elephants], The Domain [Earth] was a glorious place, and this is partly because humans back then were nothing like today's breed. They ate flesh, yes, and they were unrepentant and wrathful, but they killed only to eat [and there] weren't any massa cres or mutilations. There was plenitude and ease, and between she-ones [elephants] and other creatures was a rare communion, for . . . all she-ones were mind talkers, and the minds of all creatures were intelligible. (42-43) Instead, the elephants now inhabit a fallen world in which their collective existence is threatened, and "a new and stunningly vora cious generation of humans," their minds impenetrable, appears in tent on their destruction (56, 43). This world, for all its obvious mythic resonances, recalls certain parts of postcolonial East Africa. Here, elephants, while no longer officially endangered, must compete for territory with rapidly increasing human populations, producing a "con flict of space [that gradually] compresses them into smaller and smaller areas," and threatens to reduce their viable habitat to the relatively protected enclaves of the wildlife parks (Douglas-Hamilton 256). (Ironically, the mythical Safe Place that Gowdy's elephants seek is envisioned at one point in terms of the modern tourist indus try, as a wildlife park where peaceful "hindleggers [humans] . . . [g]ape at she-ones [elephants].. . [a]ll day long," as if, by "star[ing] at us hard enough, they [might] inflate back to what they were. Grow their ears and so on" [74]). Meanwhile, the brutal massacres of the herds—nightmarishly rendered in Gowdy's novel (85-90)— might also be linked to the crisis of the 70s and 80s, when a sudden</page><page sequence="16">716 "Greening" Postcolonialism: Ecocritical Perspectives rise in ivory prices, allied to the increased availability of guns across the African continent, led to a potentially cataclysmic escalation of the East African ivory trade (Gavron 121).26 In the main, however, Gowdy prefers to maintain a guarded, sometimes a deftly ironic, distance from both indirect historical analo gies and directly cited documentary sources. This is in part because her elephants are mythical as much as world-historical creatures; but it is clear they are also both, and she steers clear by and large of the temptation that some of the self-appointed elephant experts on whose work she draws appear unable to resist—the signal urge to coopt elephants into the type of neoprimitivist morality play in which the elephant becomes a "noble victim" in a traditional society thrown disastrously off kilter (Baker; see also Scholtmeijer), and the con tinuing assault on African wildlife contains within it a history of Euro pean imperialist greed. This sentimental view is endorsed by the English journalist Richard Gavron, whose travelogue The Last El ephant is listed as one of Gowdy's sources (Gowdy 339), and for whom the elephant is nothing less than "a flesh-and-blood symbol of . . . the most important question of all for Africa: the struggle of ancient traditions and resources to survive and contribute in the modern African world" (Gavron 3). After independence, Gavron claims, the first instinct of Africans was to turn around and wipe out their elephant populations: not merely to use the ivory to buy modern material goods, but also, it seems to me, to destroy their world's wildness and danger, to eradicate what many Africans regard as a primitive and shaming past, (xii) Gavron's view, besides being smugly Eurocentric, risks relegat ing animals once more either to commodities—the exchangeable tro phies of postimperial conquest—or to the romantic embodiments of an atavistic "wildness" in which the ambivalent inscriptions of West ern modernity on the African continent are strategically erased. While Gowdy's novel is by no means free of the rhetoric of sentimentality— indeed, she makes it clear that she wishes to engage with it (Gowdy 2)—her aim is neither simply to reproduce the kind of fateful "declensionist narrative" (Vance 172) in which animals are seen, along with humans, as inhabiting an irreversibly postlapsarian wilderness, nor to revert to the type of mock-historical fable in which animals are enlisted for the nostalgic production of a lost precolonial past. Rather, she is concerned to show how both sets of myths may be imagina tively redeployed to articulate a collective nonhuman consciousness, a unique—and by no means wholly unrealistic—vision of the world captured from the "elephant point of view." Filtered through the con</page><page sequence="17">Huggan 717 sciousness of several members of the extended herd (including its legendarily gifted "visionaries," "link-bulls," and "mind talkers"),27 the elephant worldview presented in The White Bone balances its faith in a universe saturated with cosmic meaning ("everything ex ists for the purpose of pointing to something else" [135]) against an ecology of melancholic remembrance in a landscape touched with despair. Precious links to the past have been lost, and different spe cies are now sealed off against one another. The land, previously "trembling with mystic revelation," has fallen silent; afflicted with the worst drought in living memory, it conjures only visions of "corpses and dust above which the roar of planes pours down from an illimit able emptiness" (145, 75). Memory, meanwhile, records a litany of losses, while also giving shape to the fleeting visions that link the beleaguered modern herds to a heroic ancestral past: "Every moment is a memory," [the matriarch, She-De mands, tells two of the young calves in the herd.] . . . "Everything has been ordained by the She" [the first el ephant and mother of all elephants]. . . . "Therefore ev erything must already have been imagined by the She. We live only because we live in Her imagination. Your life, as you experience it, is the She recollecting what She has already imagined. We are memory. We are living memory." (83) Epic memory counteracts the constant fear of annihilation, as the remaining members of the extended herd renew their search for the Safe Place that might guarantee the future of their species. Memo ries are an elephant's hold on life, the narrator explains, for "they are doomed without it. When their memories begin to drain, their bodies go into decline, as if from a slow leakage of blood" (l).28 And yet memories are also reminders of death, reconfirmatory visions of a seemingly preordained destruction, as if each individual elephant were made to carry the burden—were branded with the imprint—of devastating communal loss (148, 270). Memory is mourning, a patho logical condition already suggested by the novel's epigraph, taken from Rilke's Duino Elegies-. Yet in the alert, warm animal there lies the pain and burden of an enormous sadness. for it too feels the presence of what often overwhelms us: a memory, as if the element we keep pressing toward was once more intimate, more true, and our communion infinitely tender, (qtd. in Gowdy n. pag.)</page><page sequence="18">718 "Greening" Postcolonialism: Ecocritical Perspectives Rilke's poem, paradigmatically melancholic, uncovers the incurably nostalgic impulses behind the sympathetic imagination. But how is the epigraph to be read in the context of the novel? Is this self-ironic evidence of "the luxury of pity" that comes from sentimentalizing suffering animals (Scholtmeijer 119), or of the paradoxical detach ment that marks attempts to solicit sympathy for animals by making "them" seem more like "us," by making their plight our own? Or does it mark the outset of a narrative that attempts to break with anthropocentric/anthropomorphic conventions by presenting the ex perience of creatures in a language that can never fully be theirs, nor yet unequivocally our own? As the American ecofeminist critic Linda Vance warns, Crafting narratives that will give voice to animals and make humans care about them in appropriate ways is no easy task. We want to avoid anthropomorphizing animals even though that has proven itself an effective tactic for mobi lizing public sympathy toward them. We need to be faithful to their stories, not our own. The goal is not to make us care more about animals because they are like us, but to care about them because they are themselves. (185) If this is the task—and I believe it is—that Barbara Gowdy has set herself in writing The White Bone, then it is in the very grounds of its impossibility that it contrives to achieve its goal. For The White Bone enacts a variation on the Utopian narrative in which the "envi ronmental imagination" takes on the force of a performative (Buell, The Environmental Imagination), conjuring up a semimythic, largely nonhuman world that both presents and transcends ecological ca tastrophe, and that in so doing gestures toward the conditions under which our own world might be transformed.29 The nightmare of the present contains within it the dream, now partially occluded, of a possible future (Gowdy 326-27). This dream, already foretold, of a space beyond existing spatiotemporal boundaries requires a new lan guage that reanimates nature in accordance with "ecotopian" ideals (see Devall and Sessions; also Manes).30 In The White Bone, these ideals appear to correspond to certain strands within Western (Anglo American) ecofeminism, whose universalist agenda includes the im perative to create greater dialogue between humans and animals by "translating animal consciousness into a form [that] humans can apprehend" (Vance 183). Certainly, Gowdy's novel has little difficulty matching Vance's requirements for "ethically appropriate ecofeminist narratives" (182). Narratives about animals, suggests Vance, should be informed by both observation and imagination .. . An animal's life history can be told in factual ways, and it</page><page sequence="19">Huggan 719 can be told in mythic ways as well. [While] mythologizing has so often been used to objectify animals, . . . that ob jectification ... is more a function of the world view of the mythmakers than of mythology itself. In dreams, in fanta sies, in visions, animals often speak to us—and who is to say that this is not a form of communication? (183) Similarly, the standard ecofeminist association between the domination of animals and the subjection of women (Warren 4-5) finds echo'es in the crude triumphalism that surrounds the halluci nating scenes in which elephants are slaughtered in The White Bone\ The human strolls over and raises his gun again. "I don't believe I've had the pleasure!" She-Sees trumpets, extend ing her trunk in the greeting gesture. When the human is close enough she wraps her trunk around the barrel. The human fires, then prances back from the red spray. Still, She-Sees does not fall. The chain-saw human shouts, and Mud looks toward the shallows. The chain-saw human holds the tiny tusk of She-Scares between his legs. He pumps his hips. More shots from downshore, and then a tremen dous shuddering underfoot as She-Sees drops to the ground.(89) The tone of moral condemnation, here as elsewhere, is unmistak able; but Gowdy generally avoids the ethical universalism that ecofeminist accounts such as Vance's are apt to underscore. Obvi ously committed to a version of "animal-endorsing" artistic idealism, Gowdy also reserves the right to a more "animal-sceptical" (Baker 9) awareness of the significant cultural differences that ecologically ori ented writers and critics often overlook in their well-intentioned ef forts to cross the human-animal divide. The setting of the novel, for instance, draws attention to a different kind of "othering" process, uncovering the hubris behind Western cultural constructions of a mythicized "Africa" that has historically been manufactured as a pro jection-screen for European anxieties and desires (Mudimbe). Once again, then, postcolonial and ecocritical imperatives enter into pro ductive conflict. From a postcolonial perspective, cultural incommen surability is elided in the project of ecological convergence (Curtin). Aware of this, Gowdy chooses, like Coetzee, to articulate both a pow erfully inclusive ecological vision and a critique of the tacit ethnocen trism that sometimes underlies attempts to create imaginative con nections with species other than our own. What lessons might be learned from the yoking of postcolonial and ecologically oriented criticism? This essay has identified a num ber of overlapping fields in which a critical dialogue between the two</page><page sequence="20">720 "Greening" Postcolonialism: Ecocritical Perspectivès schools—still relatively new—might usefully be pursued. The first of these fields, more explicitly activist, takes in historically situated cri tiques of capitalist ideologies of development; the second, more text based, foregrounds the traditional discourses of environmental rep resentation. Both fields combine a political concern for the abuses of authority with an ethical commitment to improving the conditions of the oppressed. (Hence Roy's, Coetzee's, and Gowdy's revisionist con tributions to a genre—the fable—that is made to reveal its historical insufficiencies without surrendering its contemporary relevance as a vehicle for social and environmental critique.) A third field concerns the (cross-)cultural implications of current ecocritical debates. Here, postcolonial criticism, despite what might still be seen as an unduly anthropocentric bias, offers a valuable corrective to a variety of uni versalist ecological claims—the unexamined claim of equivalence among all "ecological beings" (Naess), irrespective of material cir cumstances, and the peremptory conviction, itself historically condi tioned, that global ethical considerations should override local cul tural concerns.31 A fourth field addresses the problem of the rationalism/emotionalism dichotomy in postcolonial and ecological discourses. This field suggests the need for a more properly historicized, self-reflexive debate on the rhetorical function, as well as direct material effects of Western-oriented discourses of intercul tural reconciliation and anti-imperialist resistance, fora critical reas sessment of the ideological work performed in romanticizing exploited indigenous peoples, endangered animals, and the encroachment of modernity on "the wild" and for a sustained challenge to the domi nance of instrumental reason as a means of justifying authoritarian behavior, both now and in the (colonial) past, both within and be yond the (human) species. A fifth field, partly contained within the fourth, concerns the representation of the "other." Here, the crucial questions of who speaks and for whom require constant critical at tention, particularly in cases where "othering" is the inadvertent re sult of an act of well-intentioned political advocacy (Roy), or where the attempt to reach out to one oppressed group runs the risk of further marginalizing another (Gowdy, Coetzee). Finally—and despite the problems mentioned above—it seems necessary to reaffirm the potential of the environmental imagination to envision alternative worlds, both within and beyond the realm of everyday human expe rience, which might reinvigorate the continuing global struggle for social and ecological justice. To be sure, the Utopian aspirations of postcolonial criticism might well conflict, rather than coincide, with those of ecocriticism, while the early history of the twenty-first cen tury, already darkened by a series of preventable human/ecological disasters, might well suggest that there is little room left for Utopian</page><page sequence="21">Huggan 721 thought. For all that, some form of active exchange between the critical projects of postcolonialism and ecologism now seems urgently necessary—not just as collaborative means of addressing the social and environmental problems of the present, but also of imagining alternative futures in which our current ways of looking at ourselves and our relation to the world might be creatively transformed. Notes 1. The anthropocentric versus biocentric dichotomy is central to the different versions of what is generally known as "deep ecological" thought. One version of the deep ecological view is presented as follows by John Porritt: "The belief that we are 'apart from' the rest of creation is an intrinsic feature of the dominant world-order, a man-centred or anthropocentric philosophy. Ecologists argue that this ultimately destructive belief must be rooted out and replaced with a life-centred or biocentric philosophy" (206). Deep ecologists, or "Dark Greens," usually like to distinguish themselves from envi ronmentalists ("Light Greens"), whom they see as being less radical, and as seeking a primarily "managerial approach to environmental problems" (Dobson 13). (See also Glotfelty, who argues that the prefix "enviro-" is "anthropocentric and dualistic, implying that we humans are at the center, surrounded by everything that is not us, the environment" ["Introduction" xxl].) But as Andrew Dobson, among others, has pointed out, there is a tension between the radical aims of deep ecology and "the reliance on traditional liberal-democratic means of bringing [change] about" (23). See also Pepper for a use ful, if overstated, Marxist critique of deep ecology's "bogus radical ism," and of the misguided—even misanthropic—tendencies of "one world" eco- or biocentric philosophies that "ignore the importance of struggle to change the social order" (141). Fora more balanced view of deep ecology, which acknowledges both the diversity within its ranks and its collective commitment to social transformation, see Merchant, as well as note 31 below. See also Curtin, who endorses weak anthropocentrism as a means of combining agendas for eco logical freedom and human justice, and who sees the traditional binaries of environmental philosophy (including that between anthropocentrism and biocentrism) as outdated. 2. One of Curtin's examples here is Garrett Hardin's notorious "ethics of the lifeboat," which elevates First World environmental assets (for example wilderness areas) over and above the value of human life in the Third World, preferring to see the latter as the primary source of the world's potentially cataclysmic "population crisis" (Curtin 18-20). For a somewhat intemperate attack on the view of overpopulation as a, or even the, fundamental threat to "global ecological balance"— which he considers to be sometimes little more than a euphemism for First World economic/environmental security—see also Pepper.</page><page sequence="22">722 "Greening" Postcolonialism: Ecocritical Perspectives 3. The "intrinsic" versus "extrinsic" or, more commonly, the "intrinsic value" versus "instrumental value" dichotomies are a staple of envi ronmental philosophy: see, for example, the essays in Elliot and Gare, Callicott, and Pojman. For more relativistic positions, see Curtin and Pepper, the latter of whom attempts—not entirely convincingly— to rescue Marxism from the charge of instrumentalism. 4. The notions of the "biotic community" and the "ecosphere" (also called "biosphere") are associated first and foremost with the work of Arne Naess, the Norwegian founder of deep ecology. The "biotic community" is a constellation of interconnected human and nonhu man entities; its balance must be preserved, not just for its own sake but to protect the principle of "biospheric egalitarianism"—and to secure the future of the "ecosphere" as a whole. Naess's nature mysticism goes beyond everyday environmental considerations, reg istering a Buddhist-inspired commitment to the nonharming of all "beings," human and nonhuman, sentient and nonsentient alike. Naess's followers, however, are divided on the practical consequences of his philosophy; critics such as Andrew Dobson have pointed out that Naess's emphasis on ontology rather than ethics suggests the difficulty of bridging the gap between (deep) ecological theory and social practice (54-55). 5. Disagreements between animal-rights and eco/biocentric advocates within environmental ethics and philosophy usually revolve around the latter's view that all nature, sentient or not, must be considered as having intrinsic value. Deep ecologists are therefore always likely to be uneasy with an ethical discourse derived, sometimes explicitly, from human duties and rights (see, for example, Regan). For an overview of the issues at stake, see Dobson, especially chapters 1 and 2; see also the later discussion in this essay of animal-welfare approaches in Coetzee's and Gowdy's work. 6. "Imperialist nostalgia," in the words of the anthropologist Renato Rosaldo, revolves around a paradox: A person kills somebody, and then mourns the victim. In more attenuated form, someone deliberately alters a form of life, and then regrets that things have not remained as they were prior to the intervention. At one more remove, people destroy their environment, and then they worship nature. In any of its versions, imperialist nostalgia uses a pose of 'innocent yearn ing' both to capture people's imaginations and to conceal its complicity with often brutal domination. (69-70) Imperialist nostalgia is antithetical, of course, to the contemporary discourses of environmental protest and postcolonial apology; it sur faces from time to time, nonetheless, in functionalized celebrations of "non-interventionist" precolonial cultures, or in self-serving lib eral attitudes toward "endangered" cultures/species, intercultural "reconciliation," and the protection of "universal" human rights.</page><page sequence="23">Huggan 723 7. The debate on how to articulate resistance without either essentializing the dominant society/culture or monumentalizing the oppressed has been integral to the so-called "Subaltern Studies Project," the collective efforts of a group of mostly Indian and/or Indian-based scholars committed to the task of reversing the tradi tionally elitist biases of South Asian historiography. For a fairly re cent collection of essays in which Subaltern Studies practitioners reflect on the extent to which the project has been complicit in the very "worlding" of the Third World it originally set out to counteract, see Chaturvedi. See also Guha, who suggests that the Subalternists, in obsessively theorizing their own procedures, have gradually lost touch with the historical experiences of peasants and workers, and that their work has effectively been taken over by environmental historians and scholars—such as himself (222). 8. It has been suggested, somewhat uncharitably perhaps, that the "postcoloniality" of Roy's work owes as much to its success on the international market as to its capacity to generate historically situ ated anti-imperialist critique. However, this is less an accusation of "selling out" than a recognition of the function of the contending "regimes of value" that surround postcolonial works and regulate their reception in different parts of the world (Appadurai 4, 14-15). For a more detailed discussion of postcolonial "regimes of value," see Huggan {The Postcolonial Exotic 4-8, 28-33); for an incisive analysis of the reception of Roy's work, and the construction of Roy herself as a mythologized literary celebrity, see also Mongia. 9. In his study on Chipko, Guha mischievously observes that "the ba ton has passed" to Narmada Bachao Andolan (NBA) as India's most globally visible environmental movement (200). Rowell points out, similarly, that Narmada has become a "national and international hot-spot of controversy" (282), and that the media have played a leading role in conferring glamour on the players of India's own ver sion of the NBA. Butas Roy notes, rather more sourly, "[Narmada is] no longer as fashionable as it used to be. The international camera crews and the radical reporters have moved (like the World Bank) to newer pastures. The documentary films have been screened and appreciated. Everybody's sympathy is all used up. But the dam goes on. It's getting higher and higher" ("Greater" 50). 10. For up-to-date news, as well as useful records, on the conflicted history of the Narmada Valley Project, various websites can be con sulted—for example the Narmada Bachao Andolan (NBA) homepage at http://www.narmada.org/html and the site for River Revival (In ternational Campaign for River Restoration and Dam Decommission ing) at http://www.riverrevival.org/html. 11. See Vandana Shiva's similar view of the dam-building industry in general, and the NVP more specifically, as a consortium of "free trade . .. institutions,... transnational corporations and . . . development institutions like the World Bank, who are also acting on behalf of corporations, because for every dam they build they are basically</page><page sequence="24">724 "Greening" Postcolonialism: Ecocritical Perspectives generating contacts for the turbine manufacturers and the construc tion companies" (qtd. in Rowell 286). 12. It is worth noting that while the ninety footnotes to "The Greater Common Good" are all to nonfictional sources (scientific studies, economic reports, etc.), Roy's essay continually draws attention to itself as a literary artifact. Various intertexts come to mind, including Dickens's novels and Swift's satires, but in its combination of righ teous indignation and storytelling verve, the essay most recalls the work of Rushdie, particularly the cross-over political allegory/fable/ children's-tale-for-adults, itself drawn from multiple sources, that is Haroun and the Sea of Stories (1990). 13. For an extended documentary version of the heroes-and-villains ro mance to which radical environmental writers-activists seem par ticularly susceptible, see Rowell; for a more nuanced, but equally romanticized account of "TNCs-against-the-people," see also Kane. 14. The self-conferred heroism implicit in media-friendly terms such as the "eco-warrior" (although generally avoided by environmentalists) has done little to enhance the credibility of the environmental move ment as a whole. Roy, although her tongue is clearly in cheek, sim ply cannot resist: "All sorts of warriors from all over the world, any one who wishes to enlist, will be honoured and welcomed. Every kind of warrior will be needed [in the war "for the rivers and the mountains and the forests of the world"]. Doctors, lawyers, teach ers, judges, journalists, students, sportsmen, painters, actors, sing ers, lovers . . . The borders are open, folks! Come on in" ("Greater" 52). 15. See Gadgil and Guha's (hyper)sociological distinction between "eco logical refugees," who comprise as much as one third of India's total population, "ecosystem people," perhaps comprising half of the popu lation, who depend on the local natural environment to meet their material needs and a small minority ("omnivores"), who have ben efited from processes of national economic development while con tinuing to "enjoy and consume the produce of the entire biosphere." According to Gadgil and Guha's schema, Roy occupies the role of the "socially-conscious omnivore," a subcategory of mostly urban omni vores who are concerned about the environment, and some of whom have played a valuable role in mobilizing resistance to human rights/ environmental abuses (98). For a more critical view of the role of "urban omnivores" in assuming control of—and representational rights to—rural "people's" movements, see also Omvedt, for whom the NBA, in particular, is much less democratic than many of its middle class supporters like to think. 16. Play has of course become a tried-and-tested strategy of radical (especially anarchically inclined) Green movements, which have coopted the language, and some of the attributes, of Carnival to their fervent anticapitalist cause. Play, at least since Bakhtin, has been seen as a powerful force for social disruption; to call Roy's essay "playful," in this respect, is not to trivialize her arguments, but</page><page sequence="25">Huggan 725 rather to place them within a wider context where humor and, occa sionally, violence meet (see Buettner on Carnival motifs in the con temporary rhetoric of globalization). The self-conscious infantilism that sometimes surfaces in "The Greater Common Good" arguably belongs to this category of play; even so, it appears at times as if Roy's penchant for aesthetic play might have got the better of her, diverting her text from the material priorities on which it otherwise wishes to insist. 17. Following Michael Taussig, I shall define the sympathetic imagina tion here as the human capacity—flying in the face of rational lim its—to "yield into and become Other" {Mimesis xiii). Speaking as and through the Other raises the irresolvable dilemma of simulta neously speaking for the Other—a dilemma explored in these "ven triloquized" lectures and, indeed, throughout the body of Coetzee's work. The sympathetic imagination, as Coetzee makes clear, has profound implications for both the exercise and the dismantling of colonial authority (see also Taussig, Mimesis 250-55); it also marks the contradictions of much liberally oriented animal-rights philoso phy, where claims made on behalf of animals—particularly suffering animals—are contingent on the ability to intuit their experience and, feeling for them without necessarily thinking as them, to somehow make them speak. 18. "Mimetic excess," for Taussig, is "a form of human capacity potenti ated by post-coloniality," which "provides a welcome opportunity to live subjunctively as neither subject nor object of history but as both, at one and the same time." Mimetic excess, claims Taussig, "pro vides access to understanding the unbearable truths of make-be lieve as foundations of an all-too-serious serious reality"; it invokes "the [magical] power to both double yet double endlessly, to be come any Other and engage the image with the reality thus imagized" {Mimesis 255). While much of Coetzee's work—including these "made up" lectures, filtered through another—strikes a chord with Taussig's theories, it bears reminding that the "magic of mimesis" is not just a resource for postcolonial freedom, but also a source of colonial abuse (see also Huggan, "(Post)colonialism " 8). The Lives of Anima/stbus moves, characteristically for Coetzee, between a celebration of the possibilities of sympathetic magic and an ironical awareness that these possibilities may be more limited, dangerous, and ultimately more irresponsible than Taussig seems to think. 19. See, by way of comparison, Benjamin's poignant essay on Kafka's fables and parables, which he reads, not in terms of metaphysical hope, but a kind of radiant epistemological despair (144-45). Eliza beth Costello's empathy with Red Peter may be seen, in this respect, less as a gesture of defiance than as an admission of failure, still more as a confession of shame at her own atrophied condition: "Be ing an animal presumably meant to [Kafka] only to have given up human form and human wisdom from a kind of shame—as shame may keep a gentleman who finds himself in a disreputable tavern from wiping his glass clean" (Benjamin 144). For essays that explore</page><page sequence="26">726 "Greening" Postcolonialism: Ecocritical Perspectives the connections between Kafka's and Coetzee's work, see Huggan ("Is There a K?") and Merivale; see also Dovey for perceptive com ments on the allegorical dimensions of Coetzee's novels {The Novels ofJ.M. Coetzee; "Waiting for the Barbarians"). 20. Coetzee's work, as several commentators have pointed out, is obvi ously underpinned by poststructuralist understandings of the radical instability of language and of the systems of authority—often explic itly or implicitly masculinist—that are made possible by language (Huggan and Watson, Introduction, 5). For examples of critical work on Coetzee informed by poststructuralist linguistic/philosophical theo ries, see the essays by Attridge and Parry in Huggan and Watson. 21. As several of Coetzee's critics have pointed out, there is a tension in both his fiction and his critical work, between the desire to enter the global mainstream of intellectual debate (as represented, for ex ample, by the various international schools of [postmodernism), and the awareness of being geographically and culturally isolated, of speaking from what Derek Attridge calls "a marginal location." Hence the decision, I would argue, to filter his views—with considerable ironic distance—through the figure of an Australian writer: a mem ber, like Coetzee, of a Western-oriented "settler" culture with uncer tain links to an exploitative colonial past. 22. The work of some animal-rights activists, notably Peter Singer, is marked by a similarly loose—and potentially dangerous—use of an thropomorphic analogy. In his book Animal Liberation, for example, Singer sees vivisection in the same perspective as "the atrocities of the Roman gladatorial arenas or the eighteenth-century slave trade" (91); even more controversial is the assertion that "[a] chimpanzee, dog, or pig . . . [has] a higher degree of self-awareness and a greater capacity for meaningful relations with others than a severely re tarded infant or someone in a state of advanced senility" (22). The implication behind many of Singer's arguments—that we humans should treat animals better because they are "like us"—ignores con siderable social, as well as individual differences in animal behavior; several of his analogies also assume that there are normative stan dards in human physiology and behavior, thus laying him open to the accusation of a form of "speciesism" against members of his own kind (7). For a convincing critique of Singer's often utilitarian argu ments from within liberal animal-rights philosophy, see Regan. Fora defense of the right to make analogies between different forms of animal and human mistreatment, see Spiegel. 23. Elizabeth attacks ecologism on the grounds that it is implicitly an thropocentric. Animals themselves, she says, "are not believers in ecology"; it is rather we humans, "the managers of the ecology," who "understand the greater dance [and can therefore] decide how many trout may be shed or how many jaguar may be trapped before the stability of the dance is upset. The only organism over which we do not claim this power of life and death is Man. Why? Because Man is different. Man understands the dance as the other dancers do not. Man is an intellectual being" (Coetzee 92-93). Elizabeth's emotion</page><page sequence="27">Huggan 727 alism, however, is arguably just as anthropocentric, being based on a media-friendly "empathy" with animals as objects of human pity and affection (Coetzee 93). To conclude, as Elizabeth's son John does, that the animal-rights movement as a whole is prey to woolly liberal sentimentality is, however, unduly simplistic. For a critical analysis of the reductive binary thinking that so often underlies popu lar views both of and within environmental movements ("anthropocentrism" vs. "ecocentrism," "intellectualism" vs. "emo tionalism," "animal-rights liberalism" vs. "ecological radicalism," etc.), see Dobson, chapters 1 and 2; see also note 1 above. 24. Coetzee is obviously poking fun here at the self-congratulatory as pects of the academic fashion-industry (just as he pokes fun else where at the hypocritical protocols of the university lecture and the shallow one-upmanship of academic debate). This playful anti-aca demicism belongs, however, to a more serious attack on the arro gance of Western rationalism; Coetzee is also making a point here— however tongue-in-cheek—about the writer's capacity to enter and extend the range of other people's creations: a capacity well demon strated in the prolific intertextuality of his own work. The Lives of Animals is no exception, alive with traces from a variety of literary sources, including Coetzee's own novels (notably Waiting for the Barbarians [1980], Life &amp; Times of Michael ^[1983], and Age of Iron [1990] and engaging several of the themes that traverse his large body of critical work. Special mention should probably be made here of Coetzee's justly acclaimed novel Disgrace, published in the same year (1999) as The Lives of Animals. With its fictional—frequently ironic—engagement with the consolations of animal welfare and the displaced (Old Testament) symbolism of retribution and sacrifice, Disgrace constitutes a useful companion-volume to the more osten sibly "academic" text. 25. An "ecological subject," according to Dobson, belongs to a larger biotic community marked by a diversity of life forms and intercon nected ecological "spheres" (54). The postulation of the nonhuman ecological subject implies that "the [entire] biosphere . . . has moral standing" (Dobson 55), and that interactions between different spe cies are part of a larger environmental drama in which humans play a contributing, though by no means an inevitably determining, role. Gowdy's elephants are ecological subjects, not just in the sense of being members of an identifiable—and increasingly threatened—bi otic community, but also insofar as they are endowed with a finely tuned capacity for moral discrimination that sheds light on codes of environmental practice (and their abuses) as a whole. 26. On the horrors of the ivory trade, see also Ritvo and Eltingham. The trade is now banned in parts of Africa (Kenya, for instance, which lost two thirds of its elephant population in the 70s alone); poach ing, however, remains an everpresent threat, with changing mar kets, allied to more fully developed military and transportation tech nologies, ensuring that the demand for ivory and other elephant products can produce sometimes spectacular economic success.</page><page sequence="28">728 "Greening" Postcolonialism: Ecocritical Perspectives 27. A "visionary," according to Gowdy's elephant mythology, is a "cow or cow calf who is capable of seeing both the future and the distant present"; a "link-bull" is one who has special insight into "omens, signs and superstitions"; a "mind talker" is "a telepathic cow or cow calf," able to read not just other elephants', but also other animals', if not humans', minds (335-36, 338). Gowdy's elephants, though rendered biologically and culturally plausible, can thus be seen as semimythic subjects for a form of zoological primitivism, inhabiting a fully fashioned tribal world of ancient superstitions and ancestral beliefs. 28. Gowdy's use of pronominal shifters, allied to her glossary and bat tery of "explanatory" footnotes, suggests her ironic awareness of the impossibility of explaining elephants' lives either from the "out side" (analytical human) or the "inside" (self-reflexive elephant) point of view. Rather, Gowdy (like Coetzee in Lives), uses an array of fic tional, as well as historically verifiable sources to create the comfort ing, but by definition self-deceiving illusion of a nonhuman world amenable to human understanding. 29. See Buell's Environmental Imagination for an in-depth study, mostly devoted to American nature writing, of the capacity of the "environ mental imagination" (Buell's term) to counteract environmental cri sis by "finding better ways of imaging nature and humanity's rela tion to it" (2). For Buell, as for Gowdy, the environmental imagina tion requires not only a transformative social/ecological vision but also a rethinking of basic assumptions about the nature or represen tation itself (2). Gowdy's radical revision of the animal fable is a case in point here (as, for that matter, is Coetzee's use of the fable to reflect on the ethical, as well as aesthetic dilemmas posed by "tradi tional" ways of representing animals in literature and art). 30. In their book Deep Ecology, Bill Devall and George Sessions define ecotopia "in the broad sense of all visions of a good society placed in the context of deep ecological norms and principles." Ecotopian vi sions, according to Devall and Sessions, are like other Utopian vi sions in that they "help us see the distance between what ought to be and what now is in our technocratic-industrial society" (162). Gowdy's novel complicates this picture in several ways, not least by filtering such visions through the worldview of nonhuman species and by stressing the need to account for specific cultural circum stances (for example those in postcolonial Africa) rather than simply asserting global "technocratic-industrial" norms. Devall and Sessions's book, first published nearly twenty years ago, needs to be seen of course in its own historical context, and several of its generalizations would now likely be contested by other deep ecologists: see note 31 below. 31. It would be both inaccurate and unfair, of course, to accuse ecologi cal/environmental criticism in toto of culture-blindness. Many con temporary ecocritics are conspicuously attentive to social and cul tural differences (particularly those associated with social ecology,</page><page sequence="29">Huggan 729 ecosocialism, and the environmental justice movement, but also at least some of those associated with deep and/or spiritual ecology, holistic movements whose practitioners continue, despite their obvi ous commitment to egalitarianism and social justice, to get a bad press). To some extent, "Third Worldist" critiques of First World en vironmental practice suffer from similar tendencies toward overstate ment: see, for example, the introduction to Guha and Martinez-Alier's Varieties of Environmenta/ism, which while rightly questioning the crude opposition between the "full-stomach" environmentalism of the North and the "empty-belly" environmentalism of the South, still tends toward an overdrawn distinction between First World conser vationist and/or managerial practices and Third World ecological re sistance movements, which the authors bracket under the catchy heading of the "environmentalisms of the poor" (Introduction xxi).
