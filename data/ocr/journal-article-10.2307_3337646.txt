<plain_text><page sequence="1">Beyond Master Hands The Lives of the Artists ALISA LAGAMMA W ATe have so far spoken of African artists mainly in the mass or at least in the plural. Now we would like to put them forward in their individual aspect, for every artist has his own personal style, which we can identify, and is as much of an artistic individualist as his Western counterpart. William Fagg, African Sculpture, 1964 XW~ ^ Xithin the culturally complex and diverse field of African art, Yoruba tradition has been the focus of the greatest concentration of critical studies and commentaries on questions of artistic practice and author- ship. This rich and abundant body of scholarship is informed by two perspec- tives that provide an unusually exten- sive view into the art history of a sub-Saharan culture. Beginning in the 1950s, a succession of engaged and cul- turally sensitive Europeans interested in understanding and preserving local her- itage studied, documented, and often field-collected a discrete body of Yoruba material culture. Launched by Kenneth Murray, who in 1943 founded Nigeria's Department of Antiquities as well as its network of national museums, and art historian William Fagg, this effort has been complemented by extensive com- mentaries by scholars of Yoruba descent on their own heritage. The resulting dia- logue has offered unparalleled insight into not only the authorship of a Yoruba corpus created in the last century but, by extension, African sculpture in general. Although interest in artistic practice in Africa has not been restricted to scholar- ship on the Yoruba, elsewhere it has been neither pursued as consistently nor af- forded a comparably documented body of artifacts. An integral dimension of the study of Yoruba aesthetics has been the attribution of works not only to regional centers but also to specific workshops and individual hands. According to John Picton (1994:4-5), William Fagg began his inquiry into the subject during a six- month research program in Nigeria in 1959. Although he fell short of his ambi- tion to write a work to be called Seven Yoruba Masters, he nonetheless introduced most of the artists identified in the litera- ture in a range of articles and catalogues.1 The fact that this reservoir of knowl- edge complements works that have been preserved in both Western and Nigerian collections made it possible for me to organize an exhibition that integrated scholarship and artworks. "Master Hand: Individuality and Creativity among Yoru- ba Sculptors," at the Metropolitan Muse- um of Art in New York (September 11, 1997-July 12, 1998), presented works at- tributed in the art historical literature to specific sculptors, together with Yoruba perspectives on achievements of these authors. One of the goals of that exhibition was to make the extensive documentation on this subject accessible to the general public. By doing so it suggested that the vague and generic information that gener- ally accompanies African objects displayed in Western museums should be evaluated more critically. "Master Hand" was not merely an academic exercise in connois- 24 seurship in Yoruba sculpture. Instead it attempted to present African forms of expression as the endeavors of individual artists, and reinfuse appreciation of the art- works with a sense of the historical circum- stances underlying their creation. The exhibition introduced the careers and achievements of these sculptors by situating them within a framework that explored the artistic process and notions of individuality in Yoruba culture. From Father Kevin Carroll's early treatment of the subject in Yoruba Religious Carving (1966) to the scholarship of Robert Farris Thompson (1969,1973) and Henry Drewal (1980, 1983 [with Margaret Drewal], 1984, 1989), there is a tremendous amount of documentation concerning the artist's approach to design and execution. These scholars began by delineating the carving process, which they consistently describe as unfolding in the following sequence of distinct phases (Carroll 1966:94-95; Drewal 1980:10-11): 1. Ona lile, blocking out the main forms with an ax or adze 2. Aletunle, working over the main forms and breaking them down into smaller precise masses (the forms of ears, hands, and eyes) with an adze or a chisel 3.

Fifin, cutting sharp details (such as hair, eyelids, and patterns), chiefly with a knife These steps underscore several ideas that are central to understanding the nature of a Yoruba artist's engagement with a work. The fact that one is trained to observe, practice, and ultimately mas- ter them implies that professional skill is not merely innate but rather is based on a combination of talent and an extended period of artistic development. The pre- cisely enumerated steps are reminiscent Above: 1. Installation view of "Master Hand: Indi- viduality and Creativity among Yoruba Sculptors" (September 11, 1997-July 12, 1998). The Michael C.

Whatever the division of labor in the carving process, it is important to consider that the design is initially concep- tualized (Drewal 1980:9). It is the individ- ual responsible for determining the work's form and overseeing its realization who is ultimately credited as the artist, no matter the level of his involvement in later stages. Even though a convergence of hands might appear to blur the boundaries of author- ship, a work's design is ultimately corre- lated with a master's signature style. In Yoruba culture, as elsewhere, it is generally the innovators who are remem- bered. While Yoruba artists historically have strived to master conventional forms of representation, exceptional individuals have developed "signature styles" through creative departures. Olabiyi Yai has noted that in Yoruba, the term for tradition, asa, is derived from the verb s2, meaning to select, choose, discriminate, or discern (Yai 1994:113). Consequently Yoruba "tradi- tion" is seen as a series of dynamic multi- layered practices introduced by individual artists of past and present generations. In a manner similar to the Western practice of attributing works to the "school" of a cer- tain master, sculptures by members of a Yoruba workshop are identified by the name of its founder. Indeed, the weight of a master's reputation may actually obscure issues of attribution. The innovators lend their names to works that are identified as theirs by contemporaries and by later generations of artists. In a society where historical documentation is oral, this con- flation of artists' names is exacerbated over time as objects are handed down to successive generations of owners. "Master Hand's" focus on the Yoruba artist took the form of a narrative of the life stories and careers of exceptional indi- viduals, accompanied by representative carvings; what we know about the lives of Yoruba artists gives us valuable insights into the shaping of their work. The instal- lation promoted an appreciation of differ- ences in individual interpretation by pairing a series of works representing dis- tinct genres, including architectural sup- ports, Epa masks, Gelede masks, ritual vessels, Sango staffs, and figural sculpture (Fig. 1). Many of the juxtapositions fea- tured artists who were contemporaries and competitors. Continuities among artists of successive generations from the same workshop were also addressed. Research for the exhibition confirmed that on a practical level, a Yoruba artist's 26 potential to innovate is bounded by the nature of a given commission. While in some instances the artist might be allowed complete license to decide a work's iconography, in others he would be required to replicate an existing piece. Similarly the degree of emphasis placed on innovation might differ according to the patron. The same sculptor may have produced both monumental archi- tectural sculpture and small figurative containers; these commissions differ sig- nificantly in terms of both the contexts for which they were designed and the response they were intended to elicit from viewers. VERANDA POSTS The sculptural programs that enhanced palaces in the Ekiti area appear to have been commissioned during a period of social and cultural renaissance in north- eastern Yorubaland during the first quar- ter of the twentieth century (Pemberton 1989:189-97), after a succession of inva- sions had devastated the region. Local leaders engaged in resettlement estab- lished their authority by commissioning lavish palaces adorned with impressive architectural sculpture. The verandas that enclose impluvium courtyards are a distinctive feature of Yoruba architectural design. The king's wealth, power, and sophistication were underscored in this setting in which he received visitors and conducted impor- tant affairs of state. Figurated posts- display pieces rather than functional weight-bearing supports (Fig. 2)-lined the courtyard's perimeter. It was in this context that Ekiti carvers gave form to a new vision of regional culture through a series of allegorical representations. Principal among these is the northern equestrian invader, an image adopted by local leaders and transformed into an emblem of local power. Another impor- tant image is the female figure. In Yoruba culture, as elsewhere, women are hon- ored as the source of human life, and representations of women embody ideals of spiritual, political, and econom- ic power. These two powerful icons together became a classic subject that was distinctively interpreted in the works of the highly successful contem- poraneous Ekiti masters from Efon- Alaiye: Olowe of Ise (ca. 1873-1938) and Agbonbiofe (d. 1945). Their contrasting styles were the subject of one of the pair- ings in "Master Hand" (Fig. 3). 01o6w of Is. and Agbonbiofe Admired as an innovator in both Yoruba tradition and in the West, O.ldwe pro- duced works whose classic forms and dynamic compositions convey the illu- sion of movement.

Agbgnbibfe's most notable interpre- tation of the same subject is weighty and powerful, its composition relatively self-contained (Fig. 3, left). Although the male and female figures are, like O16we's, carved in two tiers, they are frontally aligned. Instead of attempting to extend attention beyond the center, the artist accentuated the full, boldly cut contours of the figural forms. AgbQnbiofe emerged as the leading practitioner of the Adesina family of artists from Efon-Alaiye. In 1912 the palace of Alaiye was destroyed by fire, and he was commissioned to replace twenty-five veranda posts for its audi- ence chambers and courtyards (Fig. 4). Completed in 1916, these works brought autumn 1998 * african arts 27</page><page sequence="5">renewed magnificence to the palace (Fagg 1969). The juxtaposition of the two posts embodying the signature styles of Ol.owe and Agbonbiofe brings to mind the in- terpretations by two Western masters, Michelangelo and Bernini, of a "classic" subject in Renaissance sculpture, David: in one work the figure is introspective; in the other, galvanized into action. Although we have come to consider the pairing of the equestrian warrior and female figure a timeless theme in Yoruba art, these two artists from Efon-Alaiye may have been members of the first generation of sculp- tors to give it formal definition. EPA MASKS Like the architectural programs of Yoruba palaces, the Epa (also Elefon) festival pays tribute to the cultural renewal that accompanied the founding of Ekiti com- munities at the turn of the century (Pemberton 1989:189-97). Individuals rec- ognized for achievements that relate to the community's development are honored on this occasion and celebrated by mas- querade performances organized by their descendants. These performances include a series of monumental sculpted head- dresses featuring idealized protagonists. The first Epa masquerade to appear is that of the warrior, who through his physical and military prowess is associated with the founding of the community. This mask is followed by that of the herbalist, who is relied upon for his knowledge and ritual power, and by a mask portraying female figure, who is fundamental to the longevi- ty of the community. The defining figure of the mask, at the focal point of each com- position, is surrounded by an entourage of followers. Commissioned collectively by an extended family, such works heavily emphasize "tradition," and their relatively conservative design affords artists rela- tively narrow parameters within which to innovate. When not worn in performances animated by dance, song, and musical accompaniment, these towering struc- tures are placed on altars in family shrines, where they are the focus of offerings and prayers. Areogun and Bamgb6se, two of the most accomplished artists associated with the genre of .Epa mask carving and whose works were con- trasted in "Master Hand," are also known to us through photographic documents. Areoguin and Bamgbose As noted above, the range of scholarly insights recorded over several genera- tions has made it possible to couple attributed Yoruba works with biographi- cal commentaries to an extent that is unusual in African art studies (Pember- ton 1989:119-36). In "Master Hand," ex- cerpts from various artists' oriki (praise songs), reflecting the esteem in which 28 these individuals were held in their own communities, were combined with data concerning the span of their respective careers. This exploration of artistic iden- tity was further concretized visually in photographic portraits taken by Carroll, Fagg, Thompson, Drewal, John Pember- ton III, and Norma Wolff.2 Such eloquent pictorial records figure prominently in the literature beginning in the 1950s, but curiously they had little impact on the field at large and in popular conceptions of African art in the West. Because of his prolific sculptural out- put and extensive workshop ties linking him to artists of subsequent generations, the influence of Areogin (Ar6w6oogin) of Osi-Ilorin (ca. 1880-1954) is pervasive in the art historical record for the Ekiti region. His praise song repeatedly evokes both appreciation for his exceptional talent and the esteem in which his work was held: "He carves hard wood as though he were carving a soft cal- abash.../The expert, whose sculptures dazzle the beholder.../One who knows how to carve appropriately for kings" (Pemberton 1994:121-22). Father Carroll writes that he first met Areogin in 1948 as a result of his work- ing relationship with Areoguin's son, the sculptor Bandele (b. 1910). Father and son had become estranged from one another, and Carroll, at Bandele's re- quest, interceded successfully in their dispute (Carroll 1966:79). Young sculp- tors do not necessarily receive profession- al instruction from their own parents, and although he was the son of a cele- brated master, Bandele did not study directly under his father. Interestingly, however, the master who trained him, Osamuko (ca. 1890-1940), had served as an assistant to the slightly older Areoguin after his apprenticeship to the sculptor Ajijola-Ogiin of Osi. In a photograph of Areogtin taken by Carroll in 1952, the master appears seat- ed on a stool, hands resting in his lap, next to several of his works (Fig. 5). The informality of the moment captured is suggested by the seriousness of his downcast gaze and underscored by his casual dress-he wears a dark shawl-like wrapper (iro) over a white upper gar- ment (daisiki) and trousers. A contrast- ing portrait, taken by Carroll in the same year, presents Ar6oguin's head in three-quarter view (Fig. 6); even though the image is tightly cropped, it is clear that the artist is more formally dressed in an agbddd. While Yoruba artists are often influ- enced by the example of other family practitioners, Ar6eogin appears to have been self-motivated to pursue a sculpting vocation. Neither his father nor his grand- father was a carver (Carroll 1966:79). Instead, for sixteen years he trained as an apprentice and assistant to the sculptor Bamgb6os (d. 1920). An Epa mask in the collection of the Toledo Museum of Art, depicting a Mother of Twins, has been variously attributed to Areoguin or his master Bamgb6se; the uncertainty may reflect the convergence of the two careers at the time when Areogin was ready to become autonomous (Fig. 8). While the openness of the overall composition, in which the central figure balances a small- er figure on each knee, is characteristic of Bamgb6se, the full-rounded figural ar- ticulation suggests Areogin's style.3 Although Bamgb6oe's reputation has sur- vived, few of his actual works still exist. Likewise, few biographical details are known beyond the fact that his influence and involvement with his contemporaries appear to have been considerable on a number of levels. Other artists sought him out to discuss work, obtain advice, and consult on individual and collabora- tive projects. Bamgb6ye In the Ekiti region a prominent master of the generation following Arbguin was Bamgb6ye (1893-1978). Three portraits of him, taken by Fagg successively on the same occasion around 1950, are at once introspective and formal, conveying a sense of that artist's personal qualities. His form is elegantly cloaked in a flowing agbadd, and each frame records a subtle shift in facial expression, from serious thoughtfulness to a broad and engaging smile (Fig. 7). In their sensitive treatment of their subjects, such photographic doc- uments attest to a profound connection between artist and scholar. From Fagg's perspective, Bamgb6ye's career spanned a transitional period in Yoruba art history (Fagg 1969). A master of complex compositions on a monumen- tal scale, Bamgb6ye became renowned as the foremost designer of the Epa. His rendition of a warrior Epa, now in the Newark Museum's collection, features thirty-six subsidiary figures accentuated throughout by brilliant color (Fig. 9). The red, yellow, and blue pigments used to accentuate Epa compositions were his- torically derived from local materials until European metal-based paint be- came available. The imposing presence of the female figure achieved in the "Mother of Twins" Epa (Fig. 8) attributed to Bamgb6se or Areogun presents a dis- tinct contrast with Bamgb6ye's ap- proach represented by the mask at the Newark Museum. Although his compo- sition consists of relatively static tiers of small secondary figures, their sheer number and diversity endow the work with a sense of dynamism and suggest a lively procession. During the latter part of Bamgb6ye's career, local patronage systems changed, and commissions from Europeans created a market for new types of sculpture. In an effort to pre- serve traditional art forms, some British alrican arts * autumn 1998</page><page sequence="6">colonial officials sponsored an experi- mental school and employed Bamgboye as an instructor. GELEDE MASKS More than any other major Yoruba sculp- tural genre, the mask of the Gelede soci- ety, with its breadth of subject matter and the emphasis placed on innovation by its patrons, has encouraged the artist to depart from established precedents. Since the fourteenth century, residents of the Ketu region of Yorubaland have cele- brated motherhood through a wide range of artistic representations de- signed for the Gelede festival that ad- dress almost every aspect of Yoruba life (Drewal &amp; Drewal 1983; Lawal 1996). This diversity reflects an intense compe- tition among families that commission masks for the same event, where they appear as part of a succession of perfor- mances that unfold in the order of the dancers' seniority. On such occasions, Gelede strives to dazzle the viewer with daring and original sights. The Anago Master The Gelede tradition developed at Ketu and was subsequently adopted by the communities situated along a corridor of trade in western Yorubaland that extends into the Republic of Benin (Drewal 1989:219-22). A number of highly refined and superbly carved Gelede headdresses in Western collections have been attrib- uted to the hand of a nineteenth-century master from the Anag6 region (Fagg, Pemberton, &amp; Holcombe 1982).

Bamgb6ye's career spanned a transitional period in Yoruba art history, when colonial patronage began to affect the market for traditional commis- sions, such as the Epa masks for which he was renowned.

They are characterized by delicate lines, a distinctive angular design of the ear, deeply carved and elliptically contoured eyes punctuated by a circular opening, and often rows of tiny triangles incised across the forehead from ear to ear. In addition each work dresses the head in a unique and complex manner that endows it with individual character. Emphasis on adorning the head reflects the Yoruba belief that it is the site of one's personal essence and identity. Elaborate women's coiffures allow artists to display their talent in the finely incised lines that convey the texture of hair arranged in 32 complex configurations. Two such repre- sentations of idealized female beauty by the Anag6 master are crowned by ele- gantly inventive coiffures, each com- pletely distinct in its design (Figs. 10, 11).

Henry Drewal has docu- mented that a work of this type in the Metropolitan Museum's collection is one of a pair of headdresses begun by Fagbite about 1930 and completed by his son FalQol Edun (b. 1900), also of Idahin, in June 1971 (Fig. 12). In this composition the lateral exten- sions, attached to the headdress with hinges, take the form of two enormous snakes devouring antelopes. Depictions of animals consuming other animals occur frequently in Gelede iconography as metaphors for competing spiritual or social forces. Serpents are especially appealing to artists for their fluid form and plastic qualities. In 1971 Drewal filmed Faloli Edun as he carved the set of hinged attachments in the town of Idahin. He also filmed the completed mask, together with the other mask in the pair, in performance at the conclusion of the Gelede festival. That footage, excerpt- ed from Efe/Gelede Ceremonies among the Western Yoruba, was shown on a monitor in the "Master Hand" installation. Because of the premium placed on innovation from one year's Gelede perfor- mance to the next, over a mask's lifetime it may be physically altered by its owners. This refurbishment may be limited to a new layer of paint or it may involve new attachments to the superstructure. Such extensive changes, which may completely transform the subject matter of the head- dress, reflect the ongoing aesthetic input of the sculptor or the changing desires of the patron (Drewal 1984). VESSELS Various vessel genres relating to specific religious contexts provide a contrast to the costly and ideologically charged trib- utes to princely patrons, the communal- ly commissioned elegiac Epa, and the unorthodox Gelede. The level of aesthet- ic embellishment they receive undoubt- edly depends on the sophistication of the patron. Among the standard repertory of vessel forms are the arugbd Sango, a large container for offerings and implements of worship placed on shrines devoted to Sang6, the god of thunder, and the olumeye, a bowl designed to hold kola nuts offered to visitors. Their names refer to female figurative elements-in the first case a devotee supporting a bowl above her head, and in the second a messenger of the spirits extending a gesture of respect in the form of a sacrificial cock. In african arts ? autumn 1998</page><page sequence="10">both instances the proffered receptacle alludes to the womb as a vessel of life and a site of transformation. One gets the sense that, as in Western religious art, the more visually appealing the artist's inter- pretation of the standard design, the greater its potential to evoke the desired spiritual response. Exhibited in "Master Hand," an arug- bd Sang6 whose formal qualities reflect Areogun's influence may be related to a much later phase of that artist's career, when he was responsible for overseeing an active workshop (Fig. 13). Although the forceful composition and powerfully rendered female figure at its center are characteristic of Areogun's style, details suggest contributions by a number of dif- autumn 1998 ? atrlcan arts ferent hands.4 In addition to his collabo- ration with the sculptor Osamuko, Areoguin worked closely with three ap- rentices who distinguished themselves: Ogungbe, Aworoogun, and Abuleogin (Carroll 1966:86). Abatan Sacred receptacles that pay tribute to the god Erinle are given form by female artists (Thompson 1969, 1971; Drewal 1989:229-30).

Awo ota Erinle are considered emblems of divine leadership, and the openwork lid, regardless of the contain- er's degree of abstraction, alludes to a crown (Thompson 1969). Certain artists 33</page><page sequence="11">..~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~# ?? I~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</page><page sequence="12">have expanded upon this idea by carving a human head adorned with an elaborate coiffure at the top of the openwork crown. In such anthropomorphic vessels by the female master Abatan Odefuinke Ayinke Ija (ca. 1885-1967), breasts project above the bowl, the latter suggesting the life-sheltering womb (Figs. 15, 16). Abatan (Fig. 14) belonged to a third generation of distinguished female pot- ters in her family. Patronized by clients across southwestern Yorubaland, she was inspired by her grandmother's and mother's careers and absorbed their techniques. In his pioneering study of her career, Robert Farris Thompson (1969) paints a complex biographical portrait that also recognizes Abatan's accomplishments as a master of mud sculpture, praise poetry, and dance. He notes that after her success as a designer of sacred vessels for Erinle was estab- lished, she eventually became a senior member of the cult of O)sun and Erinle at Oke-0dan. FAMILY WORKSHOPS In most instances artistic careers record- ed in the Yoruba literature are character- ized as both innovative and at the same time linked to established lineages of creative talent, balancing continuities with departures. The workshops of espe- cially gifted and successful sculptors often became family enterprises. Two such notable examples are descendants of the Adigbologe (Adugbologe) and Esuibiyi workshops in Abeokuita's Itoko quarter (Fagg in Fagg, Pemberton &amp; Holcombe 1982; Chappel 1972; Wolff 1985).5 Fagg records that in 1862 the sculptor Esibiyi (d. ca. 1900), originally from the tgba Yoruba town of Ibara Oko, settled in Abeokuta and founded one of its principal artistic workshops. Esubiyi was also a priest of the risai Esu and an official of the Gelede association; during his later years he devoted more attention to these pursuits than to sculpt- ing.

Adigbologe arrived at Itokb quarter as a refugee in 1851 and founded Abeokuta's other principal carving workshop (Fagg 1964). He was a close friend of the sixth Alake, Gbadebo I (1898-1920), and the kings of Abeokuta regularly commis- sioned works from him for display out- side the palace as well as for its shrines (Chappel 1972:297). According to T. J. H. Chappel (1972:297), Adigbologe "is remembered not only as a leading carver of his day but also as a warrior, Ifa priest, owner of medicine and as a politician." His fame and talent are addressed in passages of his oriki: "Adigbologe who shines like the new moon./ There is no place where he is not known on this earth./ The son of a per- son who makes money from the ir6ko 36 tree." The Adigbologe workshop has come to be best known for its masks designed for the Eguingun cult honoring the ancestors (Fig. 17). Although Esubiyi and Adigbbloge enjoyed a collegial pro- fessional friendship, an artistic rivalry developed between their children and subsequently their grandchildren. The life histories of notable Yoruba sculptors reveal them to be complex, multidimensional figures who, because of their success as professional carvers, attained positions of social, political, and religious leadership. The name Areogun (which came to replace that master's birth name, Dada) is an abbre- viated reference to his professional and commercial success: "The one who gets money from the tools of O)gun [the god Clockwise, from top left: 14.

The wealth such individuals accrued afforded them the opportunity to acquire chiefly titles that carried with them enhanced status and political influence. Similarly many masters who were especially involved in creating works de- signed to honor specific ori.sa became de- votees and priests or priestesses of those deities. Bamgboye held the title Alaga (Chief) of Odo-Owa and was an Ifa autumn 1998 ? african arts priest. The impact of his influence, both as an artist and as a leader, is reflected in the praises sung in his memory: "The mighty one has fallen in the forest and can no longer rise./The elephant has fall- en; the elephant is gone" (Pemberton 1994:133-34). In taking on such a range of demanding roles, exceptional Yoruba masters had the opportunity to fulfill the highest social aspirations imaginable. Prominent art critics continue to see Africa in terms of Western values and the relationship of Western artists to the conti- nent's art. Reviewing "Master Hand" in the New York Times, Grace Glueck con- cluded that although the exhibition ad- dressed an interesting topic, in her opinion Yoruba sculpture lacked refinement and sophistication. She dismissively noted: "Yet charming as it is, Yoruba art-which is not, by the way, the work that influenced the French modernists early in this centu- ry-seems to me more provincial, with less aesthetic claim, than the highly sophis- ticated creations of some other African cul- tures" (1997:35). The arrogance reflected in that commentary by a professional critic in one of the world's most cosmopolitan periodicals reveals the entrenched resis- tance to understanding African cultures on their own terms. The message of the exhibition was lost on the critic, but one can only hope that it reached members of the public. Appreciation of the richness of the careers of these masters, the recogni- tion they enjoyed, and the admiration their achievements aroused in their own communities may promote greater sensi- tivity in future commentaries. D Notes, page 89 37</page><page sequence="15">essays are clogged with critical jargon or dogma, but more speak in a fresh voice diver- gent from the orthodox (e.g., Mweze, Maldoror, Bouzid, and Tomaselli). Political and critical methodology saturates some articles while oth- ers express personal experience and philoso- phy. The historical articles, tedious with facts, are useful if not exciting. Ssali's excellent essay, "Apartheid and Cinema," which focuses not on apartheid but rather the entire colonial period, merges historical information with political and cultural interpretation. The primary audience of African Experi- ences of Cinema is specialists and students in African film and culture, although film schol- ars in general should also be attentive. It is suitable for college undergraduates and grad- uate students, and perhaps even advanced high school students. Since few of the gener- al public have seen African films (or even know they exist), the book is unlikely to appeal to them. The brief additional bibliographies for each of the four essay sections are beneficial. Budget constraints probably account for the total lack of photographs and film stills, a par- ticularly unfortunate omission in a book about a visual medium. For students of African art, African Ex- periences of Cinema offers a feast of information about the extremely difficult conditions under which these filmmakers operate. It seems a miracle that any African film-much less the ambitious, artistic creations-ever reaches final production. Because of the high technical expenses and the large number of people involved, economic realities plague filmmak- ers to a much greater extent than they do painters, sculptors, or other artisans. However, African artists in all the media are vexed by problems of making a living from their art and marketing their wares. The intersection of filmmaking with other arts such as drama and oral narrative (see Diawara, "Popular Culture"), music, and dance instructs our understanding of all African arts, which share cultural symbols and aesthetic principles such as structure, rhythm, juxtaposition, symmetry/asymme- try, contrast/repetition, abstraction/realism. I wish the book had included more on the sig- nificant question of what makes African aes- thetics distinctive and how such principles are incarnated into artworks. This fascinating issue is ripe for exploration. The richest materials for art scholars illumi- nate the nature of the creative process and audi- ence reception (see particularly Bouzid, Maldoror, and Mweze). The most important essays analyzing individual films are those by Diouf, Ukadike, Diawara ("Popular Culture"), and Pfaff. These articles, offering thematic- and sometimes cinematic- explication of films in their cultural context are relatively recent and reflect the new confidence that African film transcends a mere documentary witness and achieves the complex subtlety of great art. I hope that African film scholars and critics will increasingly explore such issues-especially cinematography-which make African films genuinely "moving" pictures. D autumn 1998 african arts notes STROTHER: Notes, from page 12 Many thanks to Eugenia W. Herbert and to Elisabeth Cameron for their review of this review. 1. Birch de Aguilar borrows the evocative phrase "ritual dread" from the poem "Lament of the Images" by Ben Okri (p. 13): And when the Images began To speak In forgotten tongues Of death The artists of the alien Land Twisted the pain Of their speech And created a new Chemistry Which, purified of ritual Dread, They called Art. Since the text does not identify Okri as a Nigerian novelist, uninformed readers might mistake his oft-cited voice for that of a Chewa speaker. Beyond Okri, in the focus on "dread" as a return to the fundamental core of religion, one hears an echo of Rudolf Otto's influential work, The Idea of the Holy, which identifies "religious dread" as "the starting point for the entire religious development in history" (1958 [1917]:14). In the poem, I do not know which artists Okri imagines have stripped African masks of their "ritual dread." In my view, the African mask has served as the very icon of "ritual dread" in twentieth-century visual culture. One need only think of Les Demoiselles d'Avignon (1907), of Dada, of urban shamanism, and of the screaming meanies on The Twilight Zone. 2. Birch de Aguilar provides new information on women wearing masks (pp. 34 [n. 3], 105, 172). My informal indexing of important passages on the relationship of women to mas- querading include: 34, 56, 105, 108-11, 115 (n. 11), 136, 137, 139, 157-69, 171-75, 193-95, 200 (n. 30). 3. See the critique by Walter Van Beek (1991). 4. For example, Borgatti &amp; Brilliant (1990), Borgatti (1991), Fischer (1984), Himmelheber (1972). 5. Yoshida reports: "It is customary for every nyau member to make his own feathered or wooden mask and to continue to wear it on appropriate ritual occasions as long as it lasts. While someone might commission a mask from a man with a well-known talent for carving, there are no professional carvers as such" (1992:220). 6. Yoshida writes that he obtained permission to "reveal some nyau secrets for 'educational purposes' " and has abridged certain texts in order to avoid unnecessary disclosure of coded information (1993:92, notes 6, 8).

This limitation is acknowledged in the book's preface, writ- ten by Rayda Becker, Director of the Gertrude Posel Gallery. 2. Rankin had the advantage of hindsight here; her book Images of Wood (1989) was read by these audiences, so she kept them in mind while writing Images of Metal. All of Rankin's reflections about the writing of this book were expressed in two personal interviews conducted at the University of the Witwatersrand, Johannesburg, on November 18,1997, and December 9,1997. 3. As with Images of Wood, Rankin went to great lengths to find both women sculptors and black sculptors. Though this chapter inaugurates serious research in these arenas, much work remains. Rankin decided that equitable inclusion of women and black sculptors of metal in an introductory text would present a false picture. As she put it, "One can't write a holistic history about things that aren't whole." 4. In my interview of December 9, Rankin explained that a great many texts closely examine this topic, and that in the process of selecting issues from a vast amount of material, she chose not to delve into this area. 5. The men are important to Polly Street's history: Skotnes was its foundational Director and studio master; Guenther, a long-standing patron. LAGAMMA: Notes,from page 37 I am grateful to Olabiyi Yai for his generous assistance with the Yoruba diacritical markings for my articles in this issue. 1. Picton (1994) provides the following list of artists Fagg con- sidered writing about in Seven Yoruba Masters: Adigbologe of Abeokuta Ologan of Owo Olowe of Ise-Ekiti Areogun (or Arowogun) of Osi-Ilorin Bamgboye of Odo-Owa Agbonbiofe of Efon-Alaiye Agunna of Ikole-Ekiti Ologunde also of Efon-Alaiye Bamgbose also of Osi-Ilorin Ajigunna of Ilofa Akiode also of Abeokuta The Master of Isare 2. These scholars all generously contributed their invaluable primary research to the exhibition. I am grateful to all of them for their involvement and insights throughout its planning. 3. The attribution to Areoguin was first made for the Toledo Museum of Art by Roy Sieber. In the exhibition text for "Yoruba: Nine Centuries of African Art and Thought," John Pemberton III suggested the attribution to Bamgbose (Pem- berton 1989: fig. 226). 4. Personal communication, John Picton, 1997. 5. Norma Wolff (1985:195) notes that this family of carvers use "Adugbologe" as a proper name. "Adigbologe" appears in some of Fagg's references; I use this spelling here because my colleague Bolaji Campbell has pointed out that it picks up on the racy nickname given the artist because of his reputation as a womanizer.

HELDMAN: Notes, from page 55 Much of the material in this article is taken from my 1994 monograph on Fre Seyon. I wish to thank Diana Spencer and Francis Anfray for permission to publish their photographs, and Jeff Allison for his resolution of a computing disaster. I am grateful for Professor Getatchew's translations of the major inscriptions in this article. 1. Written communication, May 5,1995. 2. In highland Christian Ethiopia there was little interest in painting beyond the religious sphere. Portraits of nobles and royal patrons grace devotional images and adorn manuscripts of religious texts, church walls, and processional crosses. The decoration of reception halls of palaces and perhaps other sec- ular structures was apparently limited to imported luxury fab- rics, such as patterned silks (Perruchon 1893:118). 3. The art of the Byzantine empire and the Greek Orthodox Church frequently provided models for the arts of the other Eastern Churches. 4. The Ge'ez term for all painted or engraved images is se'el, meaning "image" or "picture." 5. Compare with Isaiah 6:3: "Holy, Holy, Holy is Lord of Sabaoth, the heavens and earth are full of Thy glory." This pas- sage from Isaiah is used as a hymn in the Christian liturgies. For a more complete discussion see Heldman 1994:29, n. 9. 6. Literacy was the privilege of the nobility and the priestly class; furthermore, Ge'ez, the literary language of the Ethiopian Church, ceased to be spoken by the twelfth or thirteenth centu- ry and was incomprehensible to the unlettered peasantry. 7. Takla Maryam is the name he assumed when he took his vows. See Budge 1898:31-34. 8. Qasis Asteraye T. Nigatu, written communication, May 5,1995. 9. The inscription in the upper margin reads, "Picture of Our Lady Mary with her Beloved Son." Below the figure of Emperor Dawit an inscription reads, "Picture of King Dawit whose faith is pure." Note of this manuscript was first published by Diana Spencer (1967). This portrait of Mary probably follows the iconography of Dawit's palace icon, no longer extant, which he used for his daily private devotions; see Getatchew 1983a. This collection of Marian tales of diverse origins had been translat- ed from Arabic (the language of Egyptian Christians) to Ge'ez, the literary language of the Ethiopian Church, during the reign of Emperor Dawit (Cerulli 1943). 10. Constantinople was also conceived as a "New Jerusalem" (Sherrard (1965:79 passim). 11. This elegant gesture has a long history in European paint- ing; see Wohl 1980:81. 12. I do not mean to suggest that the use of devotional images was unknown in Ethiopia until this time. Iconic portraits of the saints in manuscripts of the fourteenth century are inscribed with prayers to the saints, and iconic portraits inscribed with prayers appear in pre-fifteenth-century murals. A portrait of St. Mercurius slaying Julian the Apostate in the late-thirteenth-cen- tury church of Gannata Maryam is inscribed: "Saint Mercurius, martyr of Christ, pray and supplicate for Yekunno Amlak and Nehyo Bakrestos. Amen." Other iconic portraits in the same church are inscribed more generally, as in "St. Cyriacus, martyr of Christ, pray and supplicate for us" (Heldman &amp; Getatchew 1987:5). There are, to my knowledge, no extant Ethiopian devo- tional images in the form of wooden panel painting from a time earlier than the reign of Zar'a Ya'eqob. 13. For a summary of the great contribution made by Zar'a Ya'eqob to the literature of the Ethiopian church, see the essay "Ethiopic Literature" by Getatchew Haile in Heldman et al. 1993:49-51; see also Getatchew 1992 and 1981:99-100. John Meyendorff (1986:672) has observed that in the Byzantine 90 East, not only monks and clerics but also laymen, including emperors and civil officials, could compose and publish theo- logical treatises. This was the case in Ethiopia as well. 14. In addition to Michael and Gabriel, who stand beside Mary, there are Rufa'el, 'Ura'el, Fanu'el, Saqu'el and Ramu'el. Getatchew Haile (letter, April 1984) noted that this list follows EMML no. 204, ff. 10r-v, a manuscript dated A.D. 1966-67, which is a direct copy of the original Horologion of Abba Giyorgis still preserved at his monastery at Gasecca (Macomber 1975:215; Getatchew &amp; Macomber 1981:339-40). 15. This composition combines several incidents from the pro- lix reading for the commemoration of the feast of the Covenant of Mercy that was added to the Ethiopian Synaxary when it was revised circa 1563 (Colin 1992:450, 550-57). The reading tells how the angels would take Mary to heaven where she would see her Son enthroned and King David, and it also says that when Mary prayed to her Son on 16 Yakkatit at Golgotha, asking him to reward those who pray and do good works in her name, he came to her saying he would grant her wish. 16. The term "Frank" means not just the French, but all Europeans. 17. See the discussion of the account of the stolen painting by Brancaleon that was owned by Prince Sem'on (Heldman 1998:139-40). 18. The act of signing one's name upon a finished work did not imply being in possession of artistic genius. The concept of an artist or musician having divine force or genius and thus claiming higher social status did not begin to develop in western Europe until the fifteenth century and may be attrib- uted to the revival of Neoplatonic philosophy (Martindale 1972:97-104; Pelles 1963:20-22). 19. Brief inscriptions of supplication which include the mural painter's name are frequently found in provincial churches of Crete during the fourteenth century (Kalopissi- Verti 1994:144, 150-51). 20. Because virtually no work has been done on collecting scribal signatures and colophons in Ethiopic manuscript, the frequency with which they occur is undocumented. References cited Alvares, F 1961.

ROBERTS: Notes,from page 73 This article has been modified and expanded from a paper orig- inally prepared for "Individuality and Creativity in African Art: A Cross-Cultural Comparison," a symposium organized by Alisa LaGamma for the Metropolitan Museum of Art in con- junction with its exhibition "Master Hand: Individuality and Creativity among Yoruba Sculptors" held in 1997-98. I wish to thank Alisa for the invitation to participate in the symposium and also for inspired conversations with her during the devel- opment of this article. I am also grateful to Allen Roberts for his comments and suggestions. This paper is dedicated to Sid, Seth, Avery, and Al, and to our parents, Robert and Nancy Nooter. 1. Predoctoral fieldwork and archival research in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (formerly Zaire) and Belgium was made possible by the generous support of the following agencies: the American Foundation of University Women (1986-87), the Wenner-Gren Foundation for Anthropological Research (1987), the Belgian-American Educational Foundation (1987-88), and Columbia University (1987-88). I also wish to thank my affilia- tions, the Institut des Musees Nationaux du Zaire, the Africa- Museum, Tervuren, and the Smithsonian Institution's National Museum of African Art in Washington, D.C., where I spent one year in residence as a pre-Doctoral Fellow (1989-90), culminat- ing in the traveling exhibition (1996-98) and book Memory: Luba Art and the Making of History, which I co-authored with Allen F Roberts (Roberts &amp; Roberts 1996). The exhibition program was sponsored by the Museum for African Art in New York and was generously funded by the National Endowment for the Humanities, the National Endowment for the Arts, and the New York Council on the Humanities. 2. I wish to thank Huguette Van Geluwe and the late Albert Maesen of the Section of Ethnography, Africa-Museum, Tervuren, for allowing me to use the archives of Luba art, litera- ture, and documentation during 1982 and again in 1988-89, when I was a Belgian-American Educational Foundation Fellow. 3. An entire journal is dedicated to issues of naming: Naming: A Journal of Onomastics. 4. It is worth considering whether the exceptionality of the Yoruba case may relate in part to the fact that well before the arrival of colonials, Yoruba culture had one of the earliest cap- italist economies in Africa, with highly developed urban cen- ters and market systems. In the West the moderist notion of gathered artifacts and the importance of the individual artist has developed hand in hand with an emerging capitalist "sys- tem of objects" since the nineteenth century (Baudrillard in atrican arts * autumn 1998</page></plain_text>
