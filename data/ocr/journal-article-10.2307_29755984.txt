<plain_text><page sequence="1">Srivatsa VC, Sun Worship in Ancient India. Allahabad, Indological Publications 1972, XXXVI 463 pp., 30 pis.). A well-informed study on the Sun worship in India in the pre-Vedic, Vedic and post-Vedic times. The Author first of all draws his attention on some symbols of the sun which are found in prehistoric or protohistoric documents such as paintings and designs on pottery; then he proceeds to a very accurate investigation of S?rya as conceived in the Vedas, sometimes in such a way as to arouse the suspicion that there developped in those times even an anthropomorphic conception of the God; then he considers separately all the Vedic entities which are in one way or another connected with S?rya himself; Savitr, P?san, Mitra the ?ditya and also Visnu and so on, with his different aspects, the scorching sun, the besto wer of light, moral force and so forth. In Indian mythology there have always oc? curred frequent examples of the intermingling or the coalescence of different gods or divine entities which in spite of this fact, maintain their own often indefinite entity. Then the work of research follows the evo? lution of the cult of S?rya as documented by the Puranic literature, and other literary or iconogra phic documents. The only part which perhaps needs a major investigation is that concerning the immigration of the Magas, the Sakadvipa and the first introduction of the Iranian concepts concer? ning the solar cult. After all, there is no clear indication that the Sun as such had a peculiar cult in Iran: however, it might have received it in some parts of Eastern Iran. Is Sakadvipa connected with Sis tan? When and why did this introduction take place, and in which form? The representation of the God in India points to a Central Asian origin or inspiration. All these points need to my mind to be further investigated, but this detracts nothing from the merit of the book in which is collected a great deal of material that will-eventually facilitate fresh scholarly research. There are many plates, but unfortunately several of them are not very clear. Giuseppe Tucci</page></plain_text>
