<plain_text><page sequence="1">GeoJournal 26.2 21 1 -21 5 21 1 © 1992 (Feb) by Kluwer Academic Publishers Arctic Worlds and the Geography of Imagination Doubleday, Nancy C, Inuit Circumpolar Conference, 141 Aylmer Ave., Ottawa K1S 2yl, Ontario, Canada ABSTRACT: The intent of this paper is to contribute to a larger discussion of the history of geographical thought and its consequences by gently drawing attention to the Arctic as a place where alternative visions of nature, home and horizon persist; by contrasting many of our unchallenged geographical assumptions with what might be the logical consequence had we started in a different place, under different conditions and with a different perspective. It is never easy to comprehend the perspective of another and it is unwise to presume that one has indeed done so. For this reason, while this paper explores the dichotomy between the geographic perspectives of the Arctic, particularly those of the Inuit who know it best, and those of the Western Europeans who have literally laid claim to the Arctic geography, it does not purport to be anthropological or ethnographical. Rather it is an attempt to sketch the intellectual landscapes implicit in the contrast between Inuit and European approaches to the Arctic. Our vision is almost inevitably delimited by our perception and by our perspective. Standing on the coast of the Arctic Ocean with the wind driving inland, one senses the indomitable force of the Arctic. In the magic light of the midnight sun splintered by raindrops clinging to Arctic meadow flowers, one senses the enchantment. Reading the journals of the European polar explorers, one encounters the power of polar desire - for wealth, for fame, for the unknown, and in some cases, for the unknowable. All of these things are elements of the mystery that becomes the irresistable lure of the Arctic. But this is the Arctic mystery as it is experienced by the outsider. It is not the experience of the Arctic as home. As we, the outsiders come to the Arctic, we carry our cultural and historical baggage with us in our minds. Then in some of us the spell of the land takes hold and we begin to transcend the intellectual constraints of our origins. But there are others who also belong to this Arctic mystery, who have their own relationship to it, who are indeed within it, and have been for thousands of years. In order to understand the Arctic as home, one must turn to the Inuit for guidance, because for them, the Arctic is home. This paper seeks to illuminate Arctic worlds through Inuit perceptions, and by contrasting these perspectives with others, to bear witness to the insight and inspiration inherent in the understanding that nature, home and horizon can be one. Perception and perspective dominate our world view: what was Meta Incognita to Elizabeth I (Lopez 1987, p.293)1 was even then part of nunatsiaq (the beautiful land, the shining land), to the Inuit. The Inuit were as unknown to Elizabeth as their lands; and indeed she was unknown to them. But the Arctic was known to the Inuit. Prior to the advent of the Vikings, the Europeans, the Americans and their explorers, whalers, traders, missionaries and others, the Arctic was a circumpolar world populated by Inuit, Chukchi, Saami and other indigenous peoples. For the Inuit who are ocean-going and whose culture depends heavily on availability of living marine resources, this world was ocean-centred and east- west in orientation. North-south trade is known to most indigenous groups, including the Inuit; but because of the access to the water and ice of the Arctic Ocean which Inuit strength, skill and innovative technology, made possible, the Inuit world stretches from Siberia to Greenland. The Arctic rim is an "edge" environment. In ecological terms, borderlands, or transition zones are noted for their turbulence, their richness, their complexity and their constant state of becoming. In</page><page sequence="2">212 physical terms, the Arctic is the tundra, the lands above the treeline that some call the barren lands, together with the frozen ocean. The Arctic is high latitudes, vast spaces, and vortices of winds and currents. It is also stage and player in the constant drama of meteorologically and astronomically driven atmospheric events, like the winter- night and summer-day which dominate not only the Arctic landscape but the cycles of Arctic life itself. The Arctic, like all of the earth, is in a constant state of transformation: day to day transformation where sunny thirty degree Celsius temperatures plummet to near freezing as wind direction changes from south to north; and seasonal transformations where a land of dark and cold becomes a land of light and life. Biological transformations in which great waves of life, millions of birds - geese, ducks, swans, shorebirds, songbirds, predatory jaegers, eagles, hawks and owls wash over the Arctic, pursuing their reproductive potential as spring sun reveals emerging tundra beneath retreating snow. Then there are the other waves which come not on wings, but on foot - the migrating caribou transform the hillsides into landscapes vibrating with motion. Life does not end at the waters edge, rather it changes form, producing fish, seals, walrus, narwhals, belugas, bowheads and innumerable other organisms vital to the survival and function of the ecosystem. And of course, in moments of calm air, billions of insects emerge, surrounding all. When the sun slips away to the south the dense concentrations of living beings drawn to the Arctic rim dissipate into migratory streams, spreading southward the living aura of the Arctic, and giving deeper meaning to the transcendent power of nature. Evidence of recent, yet longer-term transformation is found in the shifting treeline and changing zones of Inuit and Indian occupation during the post-glacial period. More ancient transformations are documented in the Inuit stories of a world were shamans could transform themselves into animals, and could fly when necessary; and in stories of the Arctic as a tropical world. The preserved remains of ancient forests and dinosaurs "discovered" recently by scientists confirm for us the relevance of an evolutionary perspective and serve to remind us of the change which is constant and of the interconnectedness of climate, landscape and life which form the complex of Arctic nature. But like reconstruction of some extinct animal, if we can only piece together the material elements, the bare bones, how can we ever appreciate the nature and quality of the life which once animated the creature? How do we acquire an appreciation of the Arctic as a whole from a point outside it? This brief sketch has thus far only outlined the most prominent and fundamental features of the Arctic reality: space, latitude, motion, ecological richness, diversity, variety, extremity and interdependency. These are the geographical and ecological elements. The next step is to find the spiritual, transcendent dimensions, which like the spirit of the animal, are more than the groupings of its GeoJournal 26.2/1992 bones. How do human beings experience the Arctic as home? Before we can address this question, we need to understand what, beyond the walls and roof which shelter us, we mean by "home". Barry Lopez, one of the most articulate of the newcomers to the Arctic has written about the relationship of individuals to landscapes as follows: The differing landscapes of the earth are hard to know individually. They are as difficult to engage in conversation as wild animals. The complex feelings of affinity and self- assurance one feels with one's native place rarely develops again in another landscape. (Lopez 1987, p. 228) This passage from Arctic Dreams raises what is really the hard core of our theme of nature, home and horizon: the sense of belonging, or in Lopez' words "of affinity". But what is the quality of affinity? And what is its object, its other? Is it the magnetic attraction of the Pole for the polar explorer? Is it the logic of measuring of latitude and position, determining success or failure with respect to a material goal, or is it qualitatively different? Can it be shared? Is it synergistic? Is it personal? An illuminating view of the possibility of a truly interactive relationship between Arctic landscape and Arctic culture is to be found in the language, heritage and values of Inuit, for example: I walked on the ice of the sea Wondering I heard The song of the sea And the great sighing Of new formed ice Go then Strength of soul Brings health To the place of feasting. (Anon, trans. Tegoodligak 1974, p.40) This Inuit song delicately touches the transformation of the soul through the wonderment engendered as a result of direct physical contact with the Arctic itself. Moreover it establishes the link in perception between landscape and transformation of soul, leading to strength and health. The perspective implicit in this song stands in stark contrast with the following non-Inuit view of the Arctic and its potential: . . . nothing short of persecution could have driven them to take up their abode in these extreme parts of the globe, amidst ice and snow, where worse than Cimmerian darkness dwells for half the year . . . Theirs, it must be confessed, is a most cruel and wretched lot, for whom any permanent relief appears to be hopeless, surrounded as they are in every part of the coast-land, bounding the dreary Polar Sea. (Barrow, in Brody 1987, p. 7) The European story of Arctic exploration and exploitation has been one of coming to terms with the Arctic, but has been thought of as prevailing over nature, rather than adapting to it by many. Accommodation to the Arctic, learning to be at home in it was not the goal</page><page sequence="3">GeoJourna/ 26.2/1992 of most of these newcomers. At one end of the scale of accommodation we find the presumption of the necessity of hardship as a fundamental characteristic of the Arctic reality. But on examination, we find that hardship is a consequence in part, of the insistence on imposition of foreign ways on Arctic realities. Examples of this form of accommodation, which is the imposition of inappropriateness, are found in the case of the many explorers who marched on in their European clothing, freezing and falling down dead in their tracks; or the whaling captain who denied scurvy-afflicted and starving whalers the scraps of whale skin to eat which would have saved their lives, on the grounds that: They considered it a disgraceful habit, symptomatic of the savagery and desperation created by hunger, and took it as their duty to ensure that the men could not satisfy their base appetites on these loathsome items. (Ross 1985, p. 80) We might characterize this as a fatal preference for the familiar, or as the chauvinism of culture. Clearly, this does not qualify as being at home in the Arctic. Indeed, it represents an almost total rejection of the Arctic itself, while attempting to appropriate elements of the "unknown" Arctic and its riches like trophies for material gain. Farther along the scale, in some of these Europeans a consciousness began to dawn that perhaps there was some thing to be said for the ways of others, at least in the context of Arctic survival. This was an almost heretical notion for the time. For example, David Sugden quotes from the journals of Robert Scott's last expedition: one continues to wonder as to the possibilities of fur clothing as made by the Esquimaux with the sneaking feeling that it may outclass our more civilized garb. (Scott, in Sudgen 1989, p. 3) It is interesting to contrast Scott's rather self-conscious comparision with an Inuit view of the differences between themselves and the Europeans, as reported by Rasmussen: . . . we have our customs, which are not the same as those of the white men, the white men who live in another land and have need of other ways. (Rasmussen in Pétrone 1988, p. 102) The Inuit view is one of tolerance, accepting differences; the European view, being burdened by the historical conviction of innate superiority, is one of judgement. Still farther along the scale of accommodation to the Arctic, we find other Europeans who not only recognized the potential of adopting some of the practices of the Inuit, which Scott had recognized; but acted in order to achieve their ends. Of Parry, for example, it has been said: Although Parry did not learn all the Eskimos could teach him he did learn a great deal. He appears to have regarded the Eskimos in much the same manner as he regarded his 213 sailors, with affectionate patronage, but his admiration for the way they adapted to life in the Arctic was genuine. He learned how to paddle a kayak and drive a dog sledge . . . (Mountfield 1974, p.76) Parry's approach contrasted with that of his ill-fated contemporary, John Franklin, whose ice-bound boats were observed by Inuvialuit, the Inuit of the Canadian Western Arctic, on the Beaufort Coast, west of the Mackenzie River. One of these observers commented that: We wonder that you are not provided with sledges and dogs, as our men are, to travel along the land when these interruptions [from ice] occur (Mountfield 1974, p. 83) Clearly these newcomers displayed a wide range of attitudes and behaviours, some more accommodating of Arctic conditions and Inuit ways, some less so, but restricted basically to the material plane. None of these steps in accommodation are indicative of the adaptations of mind or spirit necessary to make the Arctic more home rather than horizon. Perhaps this is not surprising, given that many Arctic venturers came to the Arctic with visions of China or at least a Northwest Passage, or of the Pole, or of wealth; and capable only of seeing the Arctic as horizon or perhaps as nature. More recently we have given up our visions of Cathy, but Arctic newcomers are still looking for the Arctic wealth that they can take away. Few are looking for home in the Arctic. Given how narrowly we have come to construe the idea of home, how far we have become removed from nature, and how foreshortened our horizons have become; perhaps we need to learn how to see Arctic as home more than we know. As we struggle to put back together the worlds that 500 years of colonial expansionism have put assunder, we must reexamine our relationships - with nature and with our fellow human beings - in the hope of finding harmonies both old and new that will allow us again to feel at home in nature and in the world. Shepard writes that: Man is in the world and his ecology is the nature of that inness. He is in the world as in a room, and in transience, as in the belly of a tiger or in love. What does he do there in nature? What does nature do there in him? What is the nature of the transaction? (Shepard 1969, p.l) Perhaps "the nature of the transaction" which Shepard writes about may be understood by reference to Jantsch who finds a correspondance of mode of perception to "the terms in which understanding may be gained" (Jantsch 1975, p. 92) According to Jantsch: Rational, mythological, and evolutionary modes of inquiry typify three aspects of design applicable to the building of an anthropomorphic world, a world in which man is at home (Jantsch 1975, p.91) In this typology which Jantsch has proposed for modes of perception, he offers three interrelated categories. The</page><page sequence="4">214 rational mode deals with facts, using logic and invokes an "I-It relationship between observer and observed. The mythological mode operates on the basis of felt qualities, again between observer and observed, but in a relationship which Jantsch characterizes as "I-Thou". The third basic mode of perception offered by Jantsch is the evolutionary approach which establishes union between observer and the observed and focuses on the 'We', on the identity of the forces acting in the observer and the observed world . . . sharing in a universal order of process (namely evolution) (Jantsch 1975, p.84) Again, perception and perspective is everything: for some newcomers, the Arctic is rather like a blank screen upon which prejudices and obsessions can be projected. There is no sense of relation, nor connection, nor transaction. This is of the nature of the I-It relationship, the rational approach, described by Jantsch in his typology of modes of perception and inquiry (Jantsch 1975, p. 83) For Inuit, the relationship of affinity with the Arctic has clearly gone beyond the "I-It", and is something far more integrated and personal. There is no doubt of the mastery of the Inuit with respect to adaptation to the conditions of the Arctic, as evidenced in their sophisticated designs, executed in everyday materials, to serve specific purposes; but it does not stop there, nor does it degenerate into a struggle for power or dominion. The emphasis is on adaptation to the Arctic, rather than modification of the Arctic. This is simple, but highly significant point, for it suggests the "I-Thou" of Jantsch, reflecting feeling and quality through a "mythological" approach to a landscape which comprehends the order of change. To listen again: The Great Sea has set me in motion Set me adrift And I move as a weed in the river The arch of sky And mightiness of storms Encompasses me And I am left Trembling with joy (Anon, trans. Tegoodligak 1974, p. 40) This song is not about control in the form of resistence to nature, rather it reflects resiliancy in accommodation to and unity with nature, which gives way to joy. Is it possible that affinity, the quality of being at home, could be related to the "we" of Jantsch's evolutionary approach? For Inuit the situation is very clear: hunters are connected, dependent upon nature, knowing that nature is also dependent upon them. Knowledge of this connectedness, is experienced in tides, storms, and all manner of natural phenomena, and is a source of joy, for it is recognized as being one with life; and so we have the songs which celebrate aliveness within the Arctic landscape: GeoJournal 26.2/1992 I think over again my small adventures When with the wind I drifted in my kayak And thought I was in danger My fears Those small ones that seemed so big For all the vital things I had to get and to reach And yet there is only one great thing The only thing To live to see the great day that dawns And the light that fills the world (Anon, trans. Tegoodligak 1974, p.40) The continuum from material to mythological to evolutionary perspectives is unbroken, perhaps because the relationship with the land is unbroken, and indeed the land itself is unbroken, in the sense that in the Arctic human beings are still an element within the landscape. It is said of Europe, that the landscape has been wholly transformed by the activities of humans since the Neolithic. Somehow the act of modification of landscape to create "home" has simultaneously created the not- home, which has also been distinguished from domesticated land by being called "nature". In essence, the identification of home with the modification of landscape is a source of almost inevitable alienation from nature. This has not yet taken place in the Arctic, where the process of becoming at home has been quite different. The history of the relationship of Inuit to the Arctic is clearly qualitatively different from the relationship of humans to European lands. While the Arctic has been inhabited by humans for a long time, the fact that their way of life was based on hunting has resulted in an approach to the landscape which may be characterized as living within it, in the sense that the landscape itself was home, rather than being contingent upon a process of modifying the land to accommodate human practices, with the area so modified being "home". Yet it is quite clear that the Inuit relationship to the Arctic world has depths and dimensions which transcend even the affinity of home: in Greenland, the story is told of the man from Aluk, whose heart burst as he watched the sun rising out of the vast ocean, as if dancing in the deep swells (Anon. Namminersornerullutik Oqartussat, 1991, unpaginated) When we hear the word "nature" there is a tendency to believe that we must define it as including man, for it somehow has ceased to do so, the implication being that we have lost our connection and are rootless, perhaps even floating, independent of nature. We perceive nature as being outside, beyond, nearer the horizon than to home. Prehaps Shepard is right: "Man is in the world and his ecology is in the nature of that inness." If so, then perhaps the alienation which we are conscious of in our relationship to all nature is a product of our self- consciousness, our fixation on observation, and our inability to understand that the real quality of being in</page><page sequence="5">Geo Journal 26.2/1992 the world, of being alive; is the recognition of the union between observer and observed, that nature is "we", and not "it". Jantsch would support this analysis, for in his words: We are planning for a rational world, but we are mainly living and acting in a mythological world, and our actions impinge on the course an evolutionary world takes. Herein lies perhaps the most fundamental mismatch obstructing our intentions, ambitions, and goodwill, the basic calamity of our time. In rationalizing our world we tend to reduce action to behaviour, quality to quantity, experience to data, values to measure, insight to empirical evidence. Without evolutionary inquiry we lack a sense of direction, without mythological inquiry a sense of systemic existence. Without both we separate ourselves from the world in which we live (Jantsch 1975, p. 92) It is very difficult to develop insight without time. Inuit have a memory of the land that is long enough and deep enough to support both mythological inquiry and evolutionary inquiry, but newcomers come to the Arctic without equivalent temporal context. This analogus to amnesia at the level of information, but at the level of comprehension of process and interrelationships, it is more like the arrival of alien beings on a foreign planet. 215 Few of us have established and retained a relationship with the land anywhere which is sufficiently intimate, or sustained over a long enough period, to begin to have insight, let alone an appreciation of an evolutionary perspective which would enable us to understand that not only is there a process of transformation occurring, we are both participating in it and inside it. As Wright so aptly said perhaps the most fascinating terrae incognitae of all are those which lie within the minds and hearts of men (Wright 1966, p.88) Nature, like the Arctic, may appear as terra incognita, but there are still those among us who can remind us that it is possible to see both as "home", and not just as horizon. Perhaps if we listen, the ancient songs of Arctic worlds and the geography of imagination will enable us to understand that the "terra incognita" which nature has become to us, in fact lies within us; and so like ourselves, can be transformed, if we are willing. The land is so beautiful with its high rivers and lakes waiting to be fished. It has great mountains, and images form as if you could be a carribou among them (Paulla, in Brody 1987, p. 3) References Anon.: Namminersornerullutik Oqartussat, 1991.
