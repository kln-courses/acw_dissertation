<plain_text><page sequence="1">235 THE CEMETERIES OF ABYDOS: WORK OF THE SEASON 1925-26 BY H. FRANKFORT With Plates xx-xxiii. I. STELAE. The stelae recovered in the last season's work in the Cemeteries of Abydos were all found loose in the drift sand, or re-used as paving-stones in late tombs, but never in connexion with the tombs for which they were originally intended; they may well, therefore, be treated by themselves. Old Kingdom. No. 23 (P1. xx, 3). Limestone, 1'06 by 0'25 m., probably an architrave from a tomb. On the left are depicted the deceased and his wife, holding a perfume-vase and a flower respectively, seated side by side on a couch, the lion-feet of which rest on stone cones. Both wear a composite bead necklace, the woman a short and the man a long wig, and the latter the "full-dress" loincloth (to judge by the folds) which was worn with a more or less ornate girdle on festive occasions. (BONNET, Aegyptische Tracht, 40 ff.; ERMAN-RANKE, Aegypten, 234.) The man is called the venerable Shenay, while in the column in front his name is accompanied by the titles Mayor and Real Friend. Over and behind the woman one reads his beloved wife Neshememhet. In front of the pair stand their two sons, his beloved eldest son the courtier ("friend") Ideky, who offers incense to his parents, and his beloved son Inpuiarn, surnamed Mury, who wrings the neck of a goose for them. The sons are dressed in striped loincloths which are not very clearly rendered; that of the elder son especially seems garbled; it may be that a fringe is indicated. The main inscription consists of a short funerary formula in the first line, and further of words said by Shenay, who leans leisurely on a stick on the extreme right of the stone. This figure is, in contrast to the others, of some artistic merit; particularly remarkable is the subtle contrast between Shenay's left leg, which carries his weight, and his right leg, which is loosely bent forward. The somewhat peculiar style of both representations and inscriptions would make it difficult to assign a date to the stone; the emaciated figures on the right and the use of relief en creux are links with the Middle Kingdom. But the main inscription shows in a number of its phrases such definite parallels with late Old Kingdom texts that it seems impossible to remove it far from these. The main inscription runs: (1) A boon which the king gives and Osiris, invocation-offerings of bread and beer of the Mayor and Real Friend, honoured with the great god, Shenay. (2) He says: I came</page><page sequence="2">H. FRANKFORT from my city, I came down from my nome. I was one who said good things, I was one who repeated good things. I was one beloved (3) of his father and praised of his mother. I never took away the possessions of anybody (4) with violence. As to any people who shall take away any possessions from (5) &lt;this&gt; tomb, I shall be judged with them by the great god in the necropolis (6) when &lt;they will be&gt; in the West, their memory being evil in the necropolis. I am a virtuous spirit. (7) I know all magic which is advantageous (to me?) in the necropolis; I did all things which are advantageous to me. 1. 2. The beginning of this line, which is senseless as it stands, should be con- sidered as an abbreviation of a fuller text given by Herkhuf (SETHE, Urk., I, 121, 11 ff.), who states in detail that he has come to-day from his town and his nome, has built a house, set up its doors, dug a lake and planted trees. Here we have clearly the enumeration of the essential features of a funerary establishment, house standing for tomb, and the meaning of the passage is evident: the speaker has just died (came to-day from my town) and finds waiting for him a well-appointed dwelling which he has prepared in the West. Thus the statement finds appropriately its place at the very beginning of the speech of the dead man. A variant, which changes the sense of hi.n-i m slightly, is quite explicit (SETHE, Urk., I, 150, 16 f.) J] -o^C ~\ | A E; I went forth from my house, I descended into my tomb. Another inscription from Abydos (SETHE, Urk., I, 150, 6 f.) and one at Der el-Gebrawi (DAVIES, Deir el Gebrawi, ii, PI. xxi, tomb 38 A 2) show the same abbreviation of the passage as our inscription, and so does MARIETTE, Mastabas, 185; this shortened formula survives now and again into the Middle Kingdom (e.g. Hieroglyphic texts from Eg. stelae etc. in the British Museum, ii, PI. 14, no. 214, 3, 4). The second half of line 2 stands similarly as an abbreviation to represent a fuller state- ment. This is preserved by Herkhuf (SETHE, Urk. I, 122, 17-123, 2) and Pepinekht (ibid., 132, 16 ff.), who give as reason for their abstaining from libellous or objectionable talk, that they wished that it would be well with them in the presence of the great god. On the identity of this great god see below. 11. 3-5. The beginning of line 3 has numerous parallels; a difficulty arises, however, with the words a ' at the beginning of lines 4 and 5. I am inclined to take the beginning of line 5 as miswritten under influence of the word standing immediately above it; the condition that the word which should open line 5 ought then to be very similar in sound to the one which was erroneously put in its place is admirably fulfilled by J mni, for the result would then be that we get an injunction against those who would do damage to the tomb; and such admonitions are exceedingly common in the inscriptions of the period, which use, just as our text does, the emphatic future of the sdmtyfy-form in this passage (SETHE, Urk., I, 35, 1; 49, 1, 2, 8; 50, 16 f.; 58, 6, 7; 70, 12, 15; etc.). It may be said against this that the word mrhr t for tomb is not used in the Old Kingdom; but, as we have seen above, the style of the sculpture of our stone points similarly to the succeeding period in some of its peculiarities. In view of these arguments there seems to be little probability in the alternate view, viz. that with violence was meant to stand in both places, and that the sculptor merely doubled the preposition m in line 5 by mistake, under influence of the words above it. One would get good sense, though, on this assumption, namely, a general pronouncement of a moralistic nature: I have acted well, for "as to those who shall take away any possessions with violence, there will be" etc. Unfortunately such statements are very unusual in these texts. The explicit qualification with violence is even in line 4 unusual; generally the verb stands alone. SETHE (Urk., i, 75, 15) gives I_? n+bI . 236</page><page sequence="3">Plate XX. 2.

Bibl. Arch, xiII, 122, c. 3; CAPART, Chambre funeraire de la sixieme dyn., P1. iii). 1. 7. This is the greatest crux of the text, and unfortunately the parallels (SETHE, Urk., i, 89, 17; 90, 1; 143, 2 f.; cf. 122, 13, and CAPART, Rue de tombeaux, Pls. 19, 20) are too different to help much. There need be little uncertainty about the first half, whether or not one wants to read hn.n*i for ;h.n.f, which would have been written under influence of the ink ih ikr of 1. 6, end. It is the latter half of the line which is confusing. I am inclined to see in it an iw sdm.n.f (in its exceptional reduplicating form), standing in parallelism with iw + old perfective, because the two members of this phrase are also parallel in meaning: I know all magic which is useful, and I have taken all measures useful to ensure a good hereafter. Professor Peet, on the other hand, would consider the possibility that the sentence was not complete, and that irr ni is a parti- ciple + dative: He who does for me everything which is useful to me (shall...). A few remarks have to be made as to the writing. Strange is - in the last word of line 4, and sp in line 3 is written with e. The n of h.n*?i in line 2 and the f of mwtf in line 3 are transposed for graphic reasons, contrary to the usage in Herkhuf. The s is, both in the name of the woman and in iS't in line 4, written with a sign which shows three groups of vertical lines, viz. in the middle and at the ends, and which resembles thus the mat on which the bread is put in the Old Kingdom form of =,=. Lastly we have to consider the main peculiarity of our text, viz. the insistence with which the judgment in the hereafter is referred to. In all the parallel texts quoted above we find either a reference to a judgment in the place of judgment, or to a judg- ment by the great god. In neither case is there definite proof that a judgment in the hereafter is referred to at all, and Kees (Totenglauben, 49; cf. 33 f. and 154) may well be right when he suggests that these formulae applied originally to the king, by whose special favour the tombs were made and who could be trusted to vindicate the rights of their legal owners. But our inscription contrasts sharply with the others, and is even much more emphatic than the few texts which were known before and in which a somewhat similar tone prevails. (CAPART, Chambre fun., P1. iii; Rue de tombeaux, Pls. 19, 20). The term the great god, which up to the end of the Fourth Dynasty was a regular reference to the king, and may in religious texts well have persisted with the same meaning even after its change to the good god in the Fifth, in ordinary usage-this term is in our case qualified as the great god in the necropolis. The judgment will over- take the evildoers when they are in the West, and the essential danger to which they expose themselves is that their memory will be evil in the necropolis. Obviously a change in beliefs, which may have been developing for some time already, has here found full expression. The weakening royal power of the late Old Kingdom could not be relied upon to afford protection to those who needed it, and thus an all too human craving created the belief in a counterbalancing justice in the hereafter, or, at least, such beliefs, which may have existed vaguely and ineffectually, now came to the foreground. And it is no mere accident that our inscription, in which the new conviction has found such emphatic expression, lacks on the other hand the threat of personal vengeance which s</page><page sequence="6">H. FRANKFORT certain nomarchs addressed to the would-be defilers of their tombs (SETHE, Urk., I, 122, 15; 142, 17; also probably 90, 4). It was the lesser people who were left exposed by the disintegration of the central power, and if they did not despair in the pessimism of the "man who discourses with his'soul," they had to find, as our mayor Shenay did, consolation in a strengthened belief in divine justice after death. This stela is in the Museum at Cairo. Middle Kingdom. No. 19 (P1. xxi, 3 and Fig. 1). Limestone, 0'31 by 0'19 m., very much damaged by salt. Underneath two uzat-eyes and a Q sign follow six lines of inscription. A man without wig, wearing the simple loincloth, a bead-necklace and an amulet, stands behind the offering-table. On the other side stands a woman whose name is lost, but who is called a Royal Daughter. The man is: the Royal Son Dedtu, triumphant. The inscription runs: (1) A boon which the king gives to Osiris, Chief of the Westerners, Lord of Abydos, that he may give invocation-offerings of bread and beer, of cattle and fowl,...(2) incense and oil, and all good pure things on which the god lives, (3) which heaven gives, and which the earth brings forth and which the Nile brings as his food offerings; (4) and the sweet north-wind of life [to the ka of] the hereditary [prince] and count who is great before the king of Upper Egypt (5) and grand before the king of Lower Egypt, a prince at the head of the people, the Chancellor of the king of Lower Egypt, The Royal Son Dedtu (6) [born of] the-priest-who- has-admission-to-Sebek, Sebekemheb, triumphaint. It may well be that so poor a monument of a Royal Son and high official belongs already to the Second Intermediate Period, when a number of principalities existing side by side claimed each the royal prerogatives and titles for their ruling families. Other instances are known of people called Royal Son without their being of full royal descent, like our Dedtu. So, for instance, on the Cairo stela 20537, where the Royal Son is the son of a "count and overseer of the priests," and a "Royal Daughter," while the Royal Son of the Cairo stela 20304 seems to have sprung entirely from commoners. This stela is in the University Museum, Manchester. ~" a a J\ - 0 A .~~ l&gt; ' . r 2 o , 1 -pr, l a,,,, r0 B r? fT~~ r~ q7 `7 117__ a__ ~ "aa Fig. I. 238</page><page sequence="7">Plate XXII. 2. 3- 4- Statuette and Stelae, from Abydos.

The deceased, seated on a square seat, and his son who performs the sacrifice, are both clothed in the simple long loincloth of the Middle Kingdom, and wear a bead necklace, a "handkerchief" and no wig. The seated man has also a band which starts from the right hip and seems to pass over the back and the left shoulder but is not shown to rejoin the loincloth or its own beginning. Perhaps a sash is meant, if not clearly indicated. (Compare SCHAEFER-LANGE, Grab- u. Denksteine d. Mittl. Reichs, iv, P1. xxxii.) The seated man is styled: the venerated Overseer of Peasants Ameny, triumphant, born of Sitsneferu, triumphant. The vertical column and the horizontal column over the offerings read: (1) A boon which the King gives to the ka of the Overseer of Peasants Ameny, triumph- ant, (2) celebrated by his beloved son, the Overseer of Peasants Khakheperrec, the venerated one. The main text reads: (1) A boon which the King gives to Geb, to Ptah who-is-on-the-South-of-his-wall, the Lord of 'Ankh Tawy, to Sokaris, to Osiris the Great God, Lord of the Shyt (?), to Osiris Lord of Abydos, (2) to Anubis who-is-on-his-mountain, who-is-in-Ut, the Lord of the necropolis, that they may give invocation-offerings of bread and beer, of cattle and fowl, of linen, of all vegetables and all gifts, (3) of food-offerings, of a thousand of all good pure things which the heaven gives and the earth brings forth, on which the god lives, to the ka of the (4) venerated Overseer of the Peasants Ameny, born of Sitsneferu, triumphant, and to the ka of everyone whose name is on this stela. (5) (Done) by his beloved son, who causes his name to live, the Overseer of the Peasants Khakheperrer, triumphant, born of Yeta, triumphant, the venerated one. The photograph does not do full justice to the exquisite relief en creux, while it shows well the fine spacing of inscriptions and figures. The purely decorative character of the work, with its rigid hieratic poses and the difference in proportion of main and secondary persons, shows that the so-called "naturalistic" indication of the folds in the body of fat men, started no doubt in an attempt to a more life-like rendering, has soon, in the Middle Kingdom, become mere convention in its turn. The symbol of Anubis at the beginning of the second line deserves notice. This stela is now in the Ashmolean Museum, Oxford. No. 4 a and b (P1. xxii, 4). Limestone; the largest fragment is 0*46 by 0'30 m.; the smallest, with only the leg of the chair, 0'18 by 0'17 m. A man with a long wig, short false beard, holding a "handkerchief," is engraved rather than carved on the left half of the stone. We cannot say whether he was the main personage. The inscription is too damaged to yield any information, besides a few names: two women, the mistress of the house, Hediry, and Wenta; and her son Rerpu.... This stela is in the Chadwick Museum at Bolton. No. 13 (P1. xxii, 1). Flake of very hard limestone (0'09 by 0*10 m.), showing the names of a number of people. (Compare SCHAEFER-LANGE, op. cit., No. 20374.) The first line gives the name of the butler Herreshy, son of Theta, while the other three lines enumerate Sitkherti daughter of Sitrer, and the two sons of Sitkherti, the Treasurer Senmery and Senebu. No. 14 (P1. xxi, 2). Limestone, 0-37 by 0'21 m. Flesh dark-red, hair and stick red; collar bright blue, signs blue; plastic border yellow, with black lines; stripes on cornice red, green and blue alternately. The man wears a long wig, short false beard, necklace, handkerchief, long walking-stick and short loincloth, which shows particularly well how</page><page sequence="10">H. FRANKFORT the projection in front results from a loose slip with the seam hanging down where it is tucked in in front of the body. Near this stela was found the statuette (P1. xxii, 3) which shows the same inscription as the stela, except that the latter specifies Menthuhotpe's descent, born of Uya, triumphant, while the statuette specifies the granary: A boon which the king gives, a thousand of bread and beer, of cattle and fowl, to the ka of the Overseer of the Granary of the God, Menthuhotpe, triumphant. Though the figure is a rough piece of work its importance is nevertheless obvious. The inscription is that of an ordinary funerary statuette, but the fact that it is inscribed on the body instead of on back-pillar or base, 4 A and the general shape, hint already at 1 1 c= the later shabti-figures, and thus it would (A j )OO FJU zi)X be valuable if its place within the Middle Kingdom could be fixed with somewhat $ T q ~ ? l greater precision; but this seems hard to , do. The general impression one gets from the p / TA jf' dz- &amp;f A M tl style of the figure on the stela as well as the, c= o considerable height of the relief seems to ] ?4hl o N_ a1 4~' connect with the Old Kingdom; a similar nA &lt; stela in Cairo (20014) contains the name - - L -' J v- Khentikhetihotpe, which points perhaps with o v , . - 0- n somewhat more decisiveness to the beginning t - ?O c of the Middle Kingdom than the names on ' ^Q f r h A &amp; our objects; and I would be inclined to put L T /t ( Iy . + hLA t these therefore provisionally in the beginning to00 A r p1 ,On a I ?I X of the Middle Kingdom.

The shroud is common enough with seated funerary statuettes in the L: A L [, , t.A?..A., ,A A , 1 Middle Kingdom, but rare with standing c. nc n,= ones; an instance of the latter is Berlin SEATED "1 oav C1nI O FIGIRE 12485 (SCHAEFER-ANDRAE, Kunst d.

Stela and statuette are now in the Museum Fig. 2 at San Diego, U.S.A. No. 6 (PI. xx, 1 and Fig. 2). Limestone, 1-00 by 0'50 m. This stela, dated to the reign of Sesostris III, is very much damaged by salt, more so than Mr. Felton's admirable 240</page><page sequence="11">CEMETERIES OF ABYDOS: WORK OF THE SEASON 1925-26 241 photograph would lead one to suspect. Both Dr. Gardiner and Mr. Gunn have suggested various readings, and the latter collated our copy most carefully when visiting us at Abydos. At the left-hand bottom corner we see the deceased in front of his offerings, which are marked as such: dbh . t. Then are enumerated, from left to right: sty-hb, ointment; hknw, oil; sft, balsam; nhnm, oil; twiw t, oil; first quality foreign oil; green eye-paint; black eye-paint. The main text is shown in Fig. 2. (1) A boon which the king gives, Horus Divine-of-Being, (2) the King of Upper and Lower Egypt, Khakaurer, Son of ReJ Sesostris, given life; (3) May he give glory, power, force, triumph to the House-Official of the Palace Sesostris, the venerated one. (4) A boon which the king gives to Osiris, Chief of the Westerners, and to Anubis and to Wep-wawet and to Horus, Avenger of his Father; (5) May he give a beautiful Tomb of Triumph to the House-Official of the Palace Sesostris, the venerated one in the presence of the Great God; (6) May he "open the face" of the House-Official of the Palace Sesostris, so that he may see (in2&gt; the sarcophagus; May he cause that (7) the House-Official of the Palace Sesostris be amongst the Circumpolar stars every day eternally. (8) A boon which the king gives to Osiris, Chief of the Westerners, (and which he) gives to Aubis an t Ais to Wep-wawet, Chief of Abydos, (9) and to Hekt and Khnum, to all the gods of Abydos, that they may give in- vocation offerings of bread and beer, of cattle and fowl, of every good and pure thing (10) which goes forth in the presence of the Great God to the House-Official of the Palace Sesostris, born of the Nurse Hetept. (11) He says: 0 Priesthood of the temple of Abydos, and every citizen of this town who shall pass (12) by this my tomb; If you love Osiris the Chief of the Westerners and if you would repeat the celebration of his festivals. (13) If you love Anubis and Wep-wawet your gods, sweet of love, and you wish that your hearts be happy (14) in the king for ever, loving life and hating death, (15) then you shall say for me: a thousand of bread, a thousand of beer, a thousand of cattle, a thousand of geese, a thousand of linen, a thousand of every good thing (16) to the ka of the venerated House-Official of the Palace Sesostris, born of the Nurse Hetept, triumphant. Line 14 contains some deviations from the parallel texts preserved in three large stelae in Cairo, which are contemporary with our inscription. (SCHAEFER-LANGE, Grab- und Denksteine d. Mittl. Reichs, Nos. 20536 d, reign of Amenemmes III; 20538, reigns of Sesostris III and Amenemmes III; 20539, reign of Sesostris II.) All three show the harsh parallel, with substantives, of the sdm-f-form ndm ib.tn. Then however follow in all three cases two more sdm.f-forms: shy'tn (or mrw.tn) rnh, smh.tn (or smhw.tn) mwt. Professor Peet suggests that the participles, which seem to be used in line (14) (for the absence of the reduplication in mrw in participles in this formula see, e.g., Beni Hasan, I, P1. xxiv, A), are used vocatively, even though that implies a slight anacolouthon: "...(if ye love all these things) then, 0 ye who love life and hate death, say...." No. 24 (P1. xx, 2). Limestone, 0'56 by 0 39 m. The hieroglyphs are coloured light blue, and each line of script is surrounded, within the engraved rectangle, with a red line. Light green are the wigs of the two main personages, the spouted water-vessel, and its basin and the loaves on the offering-table; the latter are dotted with red. The pots, the geese and the joints of meat are red, and so is the right-hand bottom person. The whole is surrounded by a semi-circular plastic border at the top and the two sides. The drawing of figures and hieroglyphs is very clumsy. A seated man is seen stretching his hands towards the offering table. The text says: A boon which the king gives to Ptah</page><page sequence="12">H. FRANKFORT for the ka of Senebtef (or probably Senebtyfy), triumphant. Opposite stands an unnamed woman, smelling a flower. Below on the left is the deceased's mother squatting behind her offerings to the ka of the lady of the House Keseru, triumphant. For the strange and apparently foreign name compare SPIEGELBERG-P6RTNER, Aegypt. Grabst. aus siid- deutschen Samml., i, No. 31, p. 17, ~6,, with an additional s, and moreover from the New Kingdom. To the right one sees another woman squatting in front of her offerings; with her is a servant, with her hands in or on the top of a large pot, such as we see in baking- or brewing-scenes when the pots are cleaned out, or in the brewing- scenes when the thick fermenting liquid is filtered through a basket into the big pot underneath. It is probable that that scene is meant to be shown here. Other instances are known where the brewing is the only activity represented besides the offering to the dead. (BOESER, Beschryving etc., Leiden, P1. ii. Also KLEBS, Reliefs u. Malereien d. Mittl. Reichs, 120ff.) It is probable that the inscription in the frame belongs to the woman, and the loose one (to the ka of Ir...triumphant) to the servant. The woman seems to have the domestic title iry't ht, and seeing that foreigners are so prominent on this stela one wonders whether her name means she who speaks foreign languages, as the New Kingdom has a corresponding word for "interpreter." The main text gives: (1) A boon which the king gives to Osiris, Lord of the Two Lands, living, the Great God, Lord of the necropolis, and to Anubis who (2) is on his mountain, who is in Ut, Lord of the necropolis, (3) that he may give invocation offerings of bread and beer, of cattle and of fowl, of linen, incense and oil, and food-offerings (4) to the ka of the washerman Senebtyfy, triumphant, born of Keseru, triumphant. The bird of 3 possesses three heads but only one pair of legs.-A work which falls so far short of the average standard of workmanship can hardly be assigned to one period rather than to another, within the scope of the Middle Kingdom. This stela is now in the British Museum (No. 1653). New Kingdom. No. 12 (P1. xxii, 2). Limestone, 0'16 by 0'10 m. This small stela shows Amuin's goose with the fan, and near it "Amen-Rer." The two lines of inscription run: Made by the Overseer of the cattle of Nebpehtirer Arabau. It is interesting as a monument from the reign of Aahmes the Liberator. It was found in one of the tree-pits of the Cenotaph of Seti I, which had been dug out to some extent anciently, perhaps for the good black earth of its filling, and some objects of little use were thrown into it apparently by those who had been robbing graves in the necropolis and who passed there on their way back to the town. At least we found close by our little stela a group consisting of Predynastic and Nineteenth Dynasty pots-this as a warning to those who would conclude from the finding of this little stela that Seti I found an earlier building on the site. Now in the British Museum (No. 58520). No. 7 (P1. xxiii, 1). Limestone, 1-50 by 0'58 m., broken through the middle, and left top corner missing. The scene shows divinities enthroned round their offerings. Above the scene is the winged disk of Horus of Edfui, on both sides of which is written He of Edfa, 242</page><page sequence="13">CEMETERIES OF ABYDOS: WORK OF THE SEASON 1925-26 243 the great god, the Lord of Heaven, may he give life and health. On the extreme left is the falcon-headed god Horus the son of Osiris, the great god, the Lord of Heaven who dwells in the Thinite nome. He wears the double crown and holds, as the other gods, the - and the I sceptre. Facing him sits Osiris, the great god, the Lord of the necropolis, with the Atef-crown and flail, and wrapped in the mummy-shroud. Behind him sits Isis the mother of the gods. The right half of the stone repeats exactly the scheme of the left half, two gods facing one, but the combination of the two identical groups is so deftly d6ne that we get the impression, not of repetition, but of pleasantly varying asymmetry, in which a group of three gods in the centre is flanked by a single figure on one side and a pair on the other, while the whole composition is nevertheless well balanced. On the right of the centre we see Hathor, Mistress of the High House, dwelling in Abydos, and opposite her Anhert,...dwelling in Abydos; and finally the lion-headed goddess, Mehyt, Mistress of Heaven, Mistress of the gods. The line in the centre between the two god- desses says: All protection of life to her, every day like Rer. The stone was probably part of the superstructure of the grave, and is now in the museum at Brooklyn, U.S.A. No. 2 (P1. xxiii, 2). Limestone, 0'30 by 0'11 m., right half damaged.
