<plain_text><page sequence="1">Section Vî ARCHAEOLOGY Sectional President's Address ROCK ART OF INDIA: A HISTORICAL PERSPECTIVE Respected President, Fellow Sectional Presidents, Delegates, Budding Scholars, Ladies and Gentlemen, I deem it a privilege and honour to have been called upon to preside over the deliberations of Section V devoted to Archaeology of the 63rd Session of Indian History Congress, being held under the auspices of the History Department of the Guru Nanak Dev University here at Amritsar. I am beholden to the Executive Committee of the Indian History Congress for giving me this rare opportunity by electing me as a President of Archaeology Section. I know for certain that there are many scholars much more qualified and distinguished, definitely of better choice, working in this field. Sincerely, I believe, they have done this honour to me more in recognition of the contributions of the Institution I belong and my illustrious predecessors like Prof. B. Subbarao, Prof. R.N. Mehta, Prof. K.T.M. Hegde and Prof. S.C. Malik. Compared to them my contribution to field of Archaeology is quite modest. However, I would like to take this opportunity to present, before this august body of scholars, the present status of rock art research in India." Though an important record of archaic expression of human presence, it is yet treated as something apart and has been neglected both by archaeologists and historians. Introduction Rock art represents by far the largest body of evidence we possess of humanity's artistic, cognitive and cultural beginning. It occurs in most countries of the world, having served as an almost universal expression and communication of human thought since the dawn of humanity. It is one of our greatest surviving art treasures. Though rock art is very unevenly distributed in the world, India is fortunate in possessing one of the three largest concentrations of this world heritage; the other two being Australia and South Africa. Rock art sites are located in</page><page sequence="2">Archaeology 1171 the most divergent climatic zones. Indian rock art covers a long span of time from Palaeolithic to historic period and presents difference stages of achievements, socialization and civilization of man. Its spectrum is large both in thematic and stylistic contents. In magnitude, vividness and richness it is wonderful and in some respects unique in the world, forming an important and cultural heritage of humanity. For a long time, the existence of rock art in India had been an enigma and even its very antiquity had been questioned. Though its study crossed the threshold of archaeology rather late, it is now regarded as one of the prime source of study. A cursory glance at the panorama of rock art is enough to reveal its diversity in time and space. In a way, rock art is mostly a reflection of the human mind to a changing environment and culture. From time immemorial, such creative works of human origin have been controlled by his feelings of visual space and reflects how man perceived the world. Extensive painted galleries exhibited in the hollows of rock shelters and engravings executed on stone, bone and ostrich egg shells stand as mute testimony to this bygone art. An attempt can therefore be made to reconstruct the life style of the people of different cultural periods with the integrated study of these extant works of art. History of Rock Art Research Rock paintings in India were first recorded by the pioneering discoveries made in 1867 by Archibald Carllyle in the forested region of the Kaimur ranges in Hirzapur District, Uttar Pradesh. These paintings were discovered about twelve years prior to the discovery of Altamira cave paintings in Spain. Though Carllyle did not publish any account of his discovery, he had left his notes with a friend and was published by Vincent A. Smith (1906). Carllyle assigned the date of these paintings tô the Prehistoric period. John Cockburn, a contemporary of Carllyle studied these rock paintings systematically and produced tracings of several of them. However, he failed to recognize their prehistoric antiquity. In 1 899, he published an account of all his discoveries. In this, he compared them with those found in Australia, South Africa, North and South America (Cockburn 1899). Percy Brown, who visited the Painted shelters at Singanpur in Raigarh District of Madhya Pradesh in 1914 recognized their importance and included them as prehistoric art in his book on Indian paintings (Brown 1917). The first rock engravings of south India were brought to light only after the visit of F. Fawcett to Kupgallu in 1892. Fawcett is better</page><page sequence="3">1 172 ¡HC: Proceedings , 63rd Session, 2002 known for his discovery of Edakal cave (Fawcett 1 90 1 ). Prior to this, rock bruisings were reported by Huburt Knox from Bellary District of Karnataka. Subsequently, more rock bruisings were reported from this area by F.R. Allchin (1963: 181), A. Sundra (1974), K. Paddayya (1968: 294-98). and N. Chandramouli (1995). In 1921, Manoranjan Ghosh brought to light a group of painted rock shelters at Adamgarh near Hoshangabad (Ghosh 1932). In 1930's, D.H. Gordon tried to tackle the chronological problems of rock art by observing the superimposition of paintings, their style and technological contents. He worked basically on the rock paintings of Pachmarhi confined to the Mahadeo hills of central India. Unfortunately, he could not imagine a long autochthonous development of the Indian rock art in its original setting. Nevertheless, he was the first antiquarian to write extensively on the thematic elements shown in the rock paintings. A chapter dealing with rock art in his book became a widely read introduction to rock art in Indian Archaeology (Gordon 1958). Since then, more than 5000 painted shelters have been reported from different parts of the Indian sub-continent. These spectacular discoveries brought a new momentum to rock art studies. V.S. Wakankar, who recognized its archaeological potential, was the driving force behind these recent large scale discoveries. He had discovered several hundred painted rock shelters mainly in central India and attempted a broad survey of the rock art sites of the whole country (Wakankar 1975a; 1987; 1992; Wakankar and Brooks 1976). Wakankar had employed an appropriate guideline to determine the chronology of the paintings based on its theme, style, superimposition and its archaeological context in historical perspective. The most outstanding contribution of Wakankar to the field of rock art was the discovery of Bhimbetka in 1957. It is one of the most splendid rock art sites known to the world. This site has now become synonymous with rock art in India. Among the contemporary researchers of Wakankar are S.K. Pandey (1975; 1993), Shankar Tiwari (1975), Jagdish Gupta (1967), R.K. Varma (1964), A. Sundra (1984), Erwin Neumayer (1983; 1993) and Yashodhar Mathpal (1984; 1995) who have contributed comprehensively to develop a possible link between the rock art and the archaeological data to ascertain its antiquity in terms of historical relevance. The rock art studies in India, on the basis of where we stand now, is beyond any application of scientific or technological base. However, strides are being made by young researchers to develop a muhidisciplinary approach for its systematic investigation focusing on regional studies. The most active among these are K.K. Chakravarty,</page><page sequence="4">Archaeology 1173 Principal Secretary, Department of Forest, Environment, Culture and Tourism, Government of Chhattisgarh; Giriraj Kumar of Dayalbagh Institute, Agra; Somnath Chakravarti of Calcutta University; Rakesh Tewari (1990) of U.P.

Malla of Indira Gandhi National Centre for the Arts, New Delhi besides Gajendra TVagi, R.K. Pancholi, Meenakshi Pathak and Sudha Malaiya. The foreign scholars of post- independence period include R.R.R Brooks (U.S.A.), Erwin Neumayer (Austria), R.G. Bednarik (Australia) and Michel Lorblanchet (France). They have made substantial contribution to promote rock art research in India. Distribution and Nature of Rock Art The vast corpus of rock art in India is confined to sand stone and granite pockets, stretching from the southern parts of Kerala to the high altitudes of the Ladakh and Zanakar valleys in the north and from Gujarat in the west to Orissa, Assam and Manipur in the cast (Fig. 1 ). However, the largest accumulation is confined to the Vindhyan ranges of Madhya Pradesh and its Kaimurean extensions into Uttar Pradesh. Equally important paintings and engravings were reported from the southern Deccan in the extensive granite wilderness of the Krishna Tungabhadra Doab. In the sandstone region of central India, rock paintings were found on the walls or ceilings of shelters and sometimes as well in cliff wall cavities or at any other suitable place where they could withstand the onslaught of different weathering agents. Bhimbetka, Jaora, Kathotia, Firengi, Kharwai, Gupha Maser, Lakhajoar, Adamgarh and Pachmarhi are the important localities representing rock art sites of this nuclear region. The geomorphological setting of the rock art sites of sputh India is strikingly different from those of central India. To a large extent, the rock art of south India is represented by rock bruisings. Incidentally, there are cases of paintings also. The paintings are generally found on the shelter walls of projected ceiling hoods and invariably in niches developed by natural weathering. Among the several south Indian sites, the better known are Kupgallu, Maski, Piklihal, Edakal cave, Tekkalkotta and Badami. So far rock paintings ar p concerned, they are found in various states of preservation depending upon their location. Many of these paintings have partially faded because of the destructive action of natural and human agencies.</page><page sequence="5">1 1 74 IHC: Proceedings , 63rd Session , 2002 The paintings on granite surface are not very durable. As a result, only those paintings found located in well protected spots or hallows maintaining the environmental balance are well preserved. The great mass of rock paintings show a predilection towards the red colour in several shades ranging from rather dark violet to yellowish brick red. The red pigment, in most cases, was acquired from red Haematite nodules, called geru containing iron oxide found in lateritic formations. The next most frequently used colour was white. It would have been obtained either from calcium carbonate nodule ( kankar ) or kaoline clayey deposits. Occasionally, some of the earliest paintings were depicted in green and yellow, employing mineralized chalcedony of the respective colours. Though, most of the paintings were monochrome, there were instances of bichrome and polychrome drawings too. The authors of these paintings had exploited the natural resources available within the proximity of the rock art sites for colour pigments. At places, the rock floors of shelters show scooped out circular depressions often retaining the traces of paints. Such 'cupmarks' were intended for preparing colours for painting the rock. Unfortunately, no serious attempts have so far been made by scholars using various scientific methods to study these pigments. It has been proposed that the authors had painted the pictures either by securing the paint by diluting the colour in water or by tempera. The use of fibrous material derived from plants cannot be ruled out in the creation of some of the rock paintings. They had also used dry colour technique using crayons or employed stencil or spray technique. Drawing by means other than colour are also recorded on the rock surfaces. These include engravings and carvings better specified as bruisings or petroglyphs. In the Indian context, bruisings form the most predominant part of the rock art next to rock paintings. Bruisings were executed either by rubbing or pecking of rough granite surface. As a result, the intended picture in white appear clearly against the dull brown background of the rock. Such bruised works of art can withstand all weathering agencies even on unprotected rock surfaces and survive for a prolonged period of time. Besides rock paintings and bruisings, portable artefacts carved on stone, bone and ostrich egg shell pieces, though very meager in number, form an additional source of information. These early forms of applied art reflecting an aesthetic taste in the archaeological context are of extreme importance in the absence of absolute dating evidence. Chronology Although rock art was discovered in India quite early, the knowledge</page><page sequence="6">Archaeology 1175 of its existence had little influence on archaeological research until the last two or three decades (Mathpal 1992). Recent attempts to find the chronological indicators for rock art from associated artefacts through excavations have helped to some extent to establish the antiquity of some of these paintings. Such paintings, in the absence of absolute chronometrie 'dating, are taken into consideration for formulating a tentative stylistic criteria for the chronological sequence of Indian rock art as a broad based working hypothesis. Besides, the rock paintings themselves are useful in establishing the relative chronology on the basis of their thematic content, superimposition, style and context. Therefore, one could use these different parameters for chrono-cultural classification of our vast and diverse rock art treasures. In many shelters, rock pictures are very often found painted one over the other. In such cases, building up a relative chronology of the pictures becomes quite easy by observing the overlapping of paints. Here, one has to note the stylistic features of the successive paintings as well as the use of colour. Thus, by correlating the relevant chronology with chronologically relative features, one can unravel the age or cultural period of the rock pictures effectively. Indian rock pictures are numerous and extremely narrative having diverse details. A thematic analysis therefore, can establish a wide ranging picture of the technological and social conditions under which they were created. The correlation of such paintings with archaeologically known data will bring us closer to a technologically well defined periodization of Indian History. For convenience, the pictures drawn before the introduction of the Brahmi script, are considered as prehistoric and are divided into two distinct groups, those of hunters and gatherers and those of agriculturalists, representing the food gathering and food producing societies. Pictures showing neither domesticated/ ridden animals nor giving any clue of the use of metal weapons obviously belong to a class of society which did not possess these innovations. Such early pictures show that the hunting and gathering groups fashioned microlith - barbed weapons like spears and arrows and account for the developed microlithic technology current in India from the late Upper Palaeolithic to the Mesolithic period. Unlike the pictures of hunters and gatherers, the paintings of people practicing animal domestication are shown by pictures of humped cattle, goat and sheep. In this category, we also find yoked oxen and two wheeled bullock cart and many other features of an agriculture- based settled life style (Neumayer 1991). In central India, particularly, they resemble the Chalcolithic pottery designs found on Malwa ware.</page><page sequence="7">1 1 76 IHC.ě Proceedings , 63rd Session , 2002 None of the south Indian bruisings can be compared with any of the Mesolithiè paintings. It seems that all bruisings were done once agriculture and animal domestication were well established. The main subject of the bruisings and the paintings of this period are cattle. On the contrary, the rock paintings of Historic period are characterized by the appearance of inscriptions along with painted compositions. The presence of Brahmi and Shanka writings beside depiction of religious icons and symbols of Brahmanical and Buddhist faiths, war scenes or processions showing horse and elephant riders armed with swords and shields and mythological and contemporary narration are the predominant depictions of the Historic period. Very often there is a predilection for a white colour in later paintings of this period. The periodization of Indian rock paintings is thus supported by a chronological framework based on the observation of overlapping rock pictures belonging to different stylistic groups. The dating is further based on the thematic analysis of the pictures showing patterns of subsistence, tool technology and technological innovations. Unfortunately, unlike parts of Europe, datable finds of carved or engraved artefacts from archaeological strata are lacking in India which would have, enabled the comparison of the rock paintings with the design pattern found on such artefacts, like India, most rock art around the world has not been securely dated so far; however, with the advent of the AMS (Accelerator Mass Spectrometry) dating through pigment analysis atleast a few paintings of selected areas can be dated to confirm their chronological classification. Earliest Rock Art Expressions In the Indian context, the antiquity of rock art dates back to the Upper Palaeolithic period; however, the evidence begins with the Haerriatite and quartz crystals found in the Acheulian deposits of the lower Palaeolithic period. One such Haematite specimen was found on the exposed floor of locality V at Hunsgi (Karnataka) and bears a worn facet with distinctive striation marks suggesting that it had been used as a crayon to colour or mark a rock surface (Bednarik 1990). The excavator believes that these small Haematite nodules might have been brought to the spot from some distance since this material does not occur in its natural state around the site. He further states that these red ochre nodules must have been used for body decoration and similar purposes (Paddayya 1984: 305). Interesting evidence also comes from Singi Talav (Rajasthan) where, from the base of the Lower Palaeolithic deposit, six small quartz crystals had been recovered. They measured 7-25 mm in 'length and are therefore too small to have been used as</page><page sequence="8">Archaeology 1177 tools and were almost entirely unmodified. Like the Hunsgi Haematite nodules, they had been brought to the site deliberately and were apparently collected for their visual qualities (Bednarik 1994: 356- 57a). Although regarded as a tentative inference, one cannot rule out the possible functional reality involving an aesthetic sense among our early ancestors. Such an early beginning for rock art is further substantiated by the discovery of petroglyphs found at the site of Bhimbetka. Bednarik has reported two petroglyphs from the excavated Auditorium rock shelter (III F-24). These consisted of a large circular scooped out cupule and a pecked meandering line running parallel to its periphery. Their stratigraphie position within the habitation deposit suggests that they were made during the Acheulian period. He considered them as the oldest known rock art in the world (Bednarik 1994: 358-57a; Bednarik et . al. 1991: 34). More recently, Giriraj Kumar has reported nearly 500 cupules at a place called Daraki-Chattan near Bhanpura inChambal valley and assigned them to the Palaeolithic period based on occurrence of the Acheulian and Middle Palaeolithic implements on the same cave floor (Kumar 1996). It is quite possible to infer that some of the symmetrically formed and beautiful looking bifaces often encouhtered in the lithic assemblages of the Lower Palaeolithic period reflect the artistic ability of the tool makers and served as either art or religious objects. Two such circular discoid stone artefacts of non-utilitarian entity, one found from Bhimbetka III F-24 and the other from Maihar (Madhya Pradesh) have provided possible relevant evidence in this regard (Bednarik 1992). The anthropomorph as forms of Copper Hoard objects and numerous ethnographic analogies would corroborate this assumption. Upper Palaeolithic Period Though there is no dispute about the historicity of the Mesolithic rock Paintings, it is quite likely, as Wakankar believed, that some of the early depictions in rock paintings painted in green colour do belong to the Upper Palaeolithic phase of Indian prehistory. The possible reason for this supposition is that faceted green earth (what he calls terra Vera) have been found in the Upper Palaeolithic deposits in one of the excavated rock shelters (III A-28) at Bhimbetka (Wakankar 1975b: 18; 1983). There is some dispute however on the chronological position of the green paintings. Some researchers have found green paintings preceded by red paintings (Tyagi 1992: 304). Here, emphasis has to be given to the style rather than colour of the painting. Though</page><page sequence="9">1 178 IHC: Proceedings , 63rd Session , 2002 red colour is most frequently found in the paintings of the earliest style in the region around Bhopal, there are instances of paintings drawn in green and a few oven in yellow. These paintings show a strictly codified repertoire in their style and use of space as if they ware part of a widely understood communication system. They are distinguished from later* paintings by a very high degree of craftsmanship and a characteristic uniformity. The quality of application of the pigment in the form of fine and controlled lines seen in these early paintings symbolize the beginning of known or surviving rock art in India. Basically, the Upper Palaeolithic paintings can be broadly sub-divided into two phases, pre-figurative and figurative or non-iconic and iconic representations, on the basis of their thematic style. Closer inspection of global rock art sites shows that pre-figurative rock art precedes figurative one in most cases. The pre- figurati ve art consists of a fairly restricted range of elements or form constants, which are found in numerous variants or which may be built into elaborate "mazes" or geometric arrangements. The basic elements of all archaic rock art are dominated by curvilinear motifs, such as concentric circles, spirals and their variations and intermediate forms including geometric motifs (Bednarik 1994b). Indian rock art is no exception in this widely accepted phenomenon. The paintings consisting of geometric patterns or intricate designs form the most conspicuous stylistic feature of this earlier style (Neumayer 1993: 43). In several paintings these intricate designs often identified as 'Labyrinthian' or 'Phosphene Motifs', are composed of rhombic meanders and honeycomb patterns along with their multiple derivatives and cover large space of virgin rock shelters surface. None of these are superimposed on any of the earlier paintings (Tyagi 1992: 304-06). Chronologically, pre-figurative or non-iconic symbolic motifs are followed by figurative or iconic representations. This has been attested at some places where 'S' type green paintings depicting dynamic dancing human figures have been observed superimposed on the intricate designs of earlier paintings drawn in red ochre. The striking feature of this later style is human forms which are transformed to perfect 'S' shapes. These paintings do not dfepict any activities except dancing and hunting scenes and are known for their vigorous dynamism which is unparalleled in later rock art. In this regard, the authenticity of a green painting depicting an ostrich noticed recently by S.K. Pandey at one of the sites in central India might resolve the earlier controversy (personnel communication with S.K. Pandey). In several rock shelters the intricate designs are found as body decoration of some animal</page><page sequence="10">Archaeology 1179 figures. Here, among other designs, the spiral rhomboid is a recurring motif on the large and uncommon depictions of wild boar, elephant, rhinoceros and deer. These large figures are identified as deified animals' (Misra 1985: 120). It seems this early tradition continued to some extent even during the Mesolithic period and therefore sometimes becomes difficult to demarcate precisely. Other Art Forms Apart from rock paintings, interesting evidence pertaining to working on Ostrich egg-shells, bones and stones come from a few sites of this period. In this regard, an engraved portable artefact of applied art is reported from Patne, (Maharashtra). Out of several ostrich egg shell pieces recovered from the Upper Palaeolithic levels here, one had distinct simple geometric pattern forming a crisscross hatching between two parallel lines. Some what similar engraved design is also seen on the lower part of the same egg shell fragment. This has been dated to 25,000 B.P. based on C-14 dates of the Ostrich egg-shell samples from the same strata (Sali 1974: 157). The authenticity of the engraving found on the ostrich egg shell pieces reported from Bhopal, Ramnagar and Chandresal has been questioned by scholars (Bednarik 1993: 34; 1994: 359a; Neumayer 1990: 27), though they have furnished very early dates ranging from 40,000-25,000 B.P. (Kumar et. al. 1988). Ostrich egg shells were also effectively exploited for making ornamental beads. Two such'perforated disc beads were reported from Patne. Two more beads of this category were found at Bhimbetka in shelter III A-28 excavated by Wakankar. All of them were recovered from the stratified archaeological deposits of the Upper Palaeolithic period. In this context, recent discovery of ostrich egg shell bead manufacturing site in Narmada valley at Khaparkheda by S.B. Ota and Sheila Mishra is going to prove very interesting (Ota: personal communication). Apart from these, barrel shaped bone beads and grooved animal teeth (bovid) pendants were found from one of the caves at Kurnool (Bila Surgam III) of Andbra Pradesh (Murty and Reddy 1975). The Upper Palaeolithic cave site of Muchchatala Chintamanu Gavi has furnished a TL date of c. 1 9,000 B.P. from where one such bone bead was obtained (Murty 1974). All these specimens show facilities of attachment to a string and they constitute the earliest known evidence of ornamentation in India. In this context, a carved bone artefact recovered from cemented gravel layer III of Lohanda Naia in the Belan valley (Uttar Pradesh) is worth recalling. The specimen is about 8cms long, between 1 .5-2.5cms</page><page sequence="11">1 180 IHC : Proceedings , 63rd Session , 2002 broad and about 1cm thick. It had generated two divergent feelings among scholars, viz . whether to call it a figure of a mother-goddess or an object similar to that of a harpoon (Gupta 1979-80; Bednarik 1993: 34-35); however, it is now regarded as a well made bone harpoon which has suffered extensive damage in the very coarse sediment matrix. The presence of it does provide cogent evidence of a highly sophisticated tradition of bone working during this period even in India. The strata in which this artefact was embedded contains evidence of a Upper Palaeolithic blade and burin industry and has been dated to 25,000 BP by the accompanying fresh water shells (Misra 1977: 49). A solitary object found from Chandravati (Rajasthan) in the form of an engraved core is highly significant in this context. The design engraved on the semi-rectangular patinated cortex of the chert nodule appears to be like a spiral rhomboid (Fig 9). The design consists of a pair of parallel lines moving clock wise from the center forming two intertwining spiraling arms. One of these arms bears a series of short diagonal lines whereas the other one has been left plain to render a foreground and background effect. The engraver has taken care to make these infinitesimal yet distinguishable marks. This precisely indicates the specific intention of the artist to ensure that the significance and visual effect of the engraved design should not go unnoticed. The design was engraved on the nodule prior to its use as a core (Sonawane 1995:98). Identical designs have been found painted in earlier rock paintings at Mahadev Hills, Cheel Dant, Bhimbetka, Kathotiya (Fig 2) and several other places in India which are identified as examples of pre-figurative rock art. A striking parallel exists even in the Upper Palaeolithic art of Mezin, a site at Krimean (South Russia) where similar design have been found on the mammoth ivory female figurines as well as ivory bracelet of late Pleistocene period (Clark 1977). Unfortunately the earliest paintings representing geometric patterns, because of close similarity of the design engraved on the Chandravati core, has been attributed to the Mesolithic Period (Sonawane 1992). However, the Chandravati specimen is not actually dated, since it forms a part of the surface assemblage. It is merely assumed to be Mesolithic and acknowledged that the engraving on the object predates its use as core (Bednarik 1993:34). Tyagi's only objection to Wakankar's observation is that green paintings representing 'S' shaped dynamic dancing human figures are not the earliest paintings (Ty agi 1992, 310). In light of new evidences, both from Chandravati and else where it appears that the pattern of design engraved on the Chandravati core is of the Upper Palaeolithic tradition</page><page sequence="12">Archaeology 1181 (Sonawane 1996). In view of the above situation, rock paintings representing purely geometric patterns as pre-figurative or non-icònic art forms and succeeding figurative or iconic depictions painted either in red or green, animated human and animal figures need to be seriously considered as the earliest depictions belonging to the Upper Palaeolithic period. The existence of these early paintings has been consolidated by other contemporary surviving art objects as a parallel or simultaneous development at par with the rest of the world, Mesolithic Period The wide spectrum of rock art of the Mesolithic period is full of varied descriptive details. It trsurprisingly uniform in style and content all over India. There is a remarkable divergence in the degree of abstraction between the depiction of the human and animal forms. While animals are depicted quite naturalistically, the human forms are reduced to stick like figures in a stylistic manner. Sometimes, humans are shown wearing masks op elaborate heed dress. This difference between the human and animal depiction is most visible in hunting scenes. Again, in contrast to fragile male figures, the female form is always static with a plump square body. Since animals and women are quite bulky, there was enough room for body decoration. Most of the intricate design patterns like the spiral or honeycomb are seen in such paintings and thus show continuity with the earlier tradition. There is no clear demarcation between body pattern and "X-ray depictions". Both appear at places side by side within a single composition. Mesolithic paintings give a remarkably detailed account of the various activities, recording minute details of the intended message. The hunting scenes which predominate in the rock art of this period show a variety of games, both big and small, being hunted with spears and arrows tipped and barbed with microliths. They also furnish fairly detailed description of a variety of traps used for capturing game, shooting arrows at prey, transporting the kill, butchering, fishing with net traps, catchina rats by pushing digging sticks into burrow, as well as the collection of fruits, honey and other subsistence practices. Apart from these, there are paintings which speak of other activities such as dancing, singing, playing with musical instruments (Neumayer 1992-93), drinking and eating inside a roofed house. A large number of paintings show subjects which may be classed as religious or cultic. Here, we find mythical stories depicting huge defied animals chasing diminutive human beings. Scenes narrating magical cures or medical treatments signify a deeper meaning in their creation. The most touching is the scene of a child burial where family members are shown</page><page sequence="13">1 1 82 IHC: Proceedings , 63rd Session , 2002 mourning over the death. Compared to the rock paintings,' Mesolithic engravings are few and far between, with whatever is known being in the form of mere scratches, figures of animals or abstract patterns. In Orissa (Pradhan 1995) and Bihar (Chakravarty 1998), such engravings were invariably filled in with colours. The continuity in the tradition of engravings as a mode of expression is further supported by discovery of bone objects recovered from the Mesolithic deposits in the rock shelter III A-28 of the Bhimbetka complex (Wakankar 1975b). The engraving consists of simple straight or zigzag lines and irregular parallelogram designs. Apart from this, the evidence of bone and antler rings used as ornamental ear rings and components of a necklace from Sarai Nahar Rai and Mahadaha (Uttar Pradesh) supply additional information on the aesthetic taste developed by these Mesolithic communities (Pal 1994). Neolithic and Chalcolithic Period An abrupt change is seen in style and theme between the rack art of the hunter gatherers and the early agriculturalists. The earliest pictures of this period featuring domesticated animals are stylistically well demarcated from the pictures of the preceding periods. The dynamic art of the hunters and gatherers get replaced by a progressively stiff and static art of the agriculturalists and cattle keepers whose thematic spectrum is extremely limited and confined to the depiction of long- horned humped cattle; however, where hunting scenes are painted, they give a good idea about the weapons used during this period. Although the most common weapons were bows and arrows, the appearance of metal arrow-heads, spears and axes herald a fast changing technology. The complexity of this available technology is best represented by depiction of chariots. Several large Chalcolithic pictures show processions, accompanied by acrobats, boxers, load carriers and musicians. In several such scenes, chariots and their crew are prominently depicted showing an advanced state of social stratification. Agriculture, the economic foundation of this period, is hardly shown in the paintings except those found at Chaturbhujnath Naia and Lakhajoar, where paintings of ploughing farmers are seen. All the Chalcolithic pictures of central India represent very much a man's world, in which women were depicted very peripherally. Similar tendencies are also visible in the Neolithic/Chalcolithic pictures ol the South India where women appear very subservient to ithyphallic men. There are also instances of scenes depicting heterosexual intercourse in different postures.</page><page sequence="14">Archaeology 1183 Depictions of bullock carts are quite frequent as the common vehicle for transportation. A cart bruising from Kupgallu resembles the terracotta toy cart models reported from several Chalćolithic sites and is worth recalling. There are several indications that chariots were drawn by horses and in paintings they also appear as mounts. Compared to this, elephant riders are very few. Elegant long horned bulls are a special feature of Neolithic/ Chalcolithic pictures in south India, taking the position of an icon. One interesting depiction comes from Kupgallu where four typical bulls are arrayed at the periphery of a circle. In other pictures, they are placed on a T-shaped pedestal. Besides this, there are several bruisings of large implements. Compared to the size of the accompanying human figures, they are drawn excessively large. These engravings of implements are often placed at prominent points on the granite hills indicating their use as standards or cultic weapons. Likewise, depictions of endless knots recall the design pattern ehgraved (Sundra 1996) on the copper tablets found at Mohenjodaro. Of these, several rock art sites are situated in the vicinity of Megalithic burials. Obviously, some of the paintings and bruisings can be related to burial Practices (Rajan 1991). One such painting show a dead person within the burial inventory of a stone circle in Benakal forest. In the same spirit, rock engravings found in the Karakoram and Himalayas, particularly, in the upper course of the river Indus and its tributaries in Ļadakh and Zanskar, show hunters with bòws and arrows stalking ibex, deer and bovids (Francfort et. al. 1992). These compare well with the hunting scenes engraved on the stone slab recovered from the rectangular structure belonging to the Neolithic phase II at Burzahom showing the hunting of a deer by two armed persons (Pande 1971). Another slab föund in the same context has an abstract design identified as a tectiform or trap, representing a hut with a thatched domed roof (Pande 1972). The obvious advantages of dating the rock art of this cultural period is the availability of reliable stratified archaeological data in the form of contemporary proto-historic art forms. Historic Period So far as the rock art of Historic period is concerned, it is characterised by the presence of writings of Brahmi, Sankha and even Nagari scripts, besides the introduction of religious icons and symbols of various prevailing faiths. The depiction of Krishna, Balarama and Vinadhar Shiva (Fig 20) at Tikula near Gwalior (Neumayer 1992-93); Ganesha</page><page sequence="15">1 1 84 IHC: Proceedings , 63rd Session, 2002 and Yaksha at Bhimbetka; Lajja Gauri at Chintakunta (Andhra Pradesh); Buddha at Satdhara near the Sancbi; stupas showing structural and decorative details at Satdhara, Kotra near Narsinghgarh; Gambhirpura, near Idar (Fig 21) (Sonawane 1992-93); Dharmachakra on a pillar; Bodhi tree and Triratna symbol besides the story of Shravan Kumar at Chibbarnala near Bhanpura; suggest the depth of penetration of a codified and uniform system of religious beliefs throughout the country. Similar depictions mostly in the form of petroglyphs have been found further north in Ladakh and Chilas (Pakistan) narrating Buddhist themes along with Kharoshti and Brahmi inscriptions (Orofino 1990; Dani 1983: 43-58). Apart from distinct religious or cultic narrations, rock art of the Historic period is dominated by heavily caparisoned horses and elephants often with riders depicting battle scenes, with soldiers engaged in fighting with metal weapons such as spears, swords and shields, daggers and occasionally bows and arrows. Sometime, soldiers are shown wearing armour. There are also royal processions depicting royal personages standing under canopies. In addition, there are pictures representing many aspects of the contemporary life of the people residing both in plains and forests, together with variety of animals, birds and plants confined to the regions of rock art distribution. The aesthetic sophistication of some of these paintings particularly those from Badami and Mahadev Hills are comparable with the famous fresco paintings of classical Indian art and some show close parallels with Kushana and Gupta sculptural styles in their descriptive details. In this regard, the rock painting of sailing boats found at Chamardi near Bhavnagar in Gujarat speaks of the type of sea going vessels current on the west coast of Saurashtra is unique (Sonawane 1998: •71-72). Apart from these, there are several examples of traditionally accepted themes and styles marked by stereotypical monotonous depictions showing a decline in artistic standards. The inclusion of geometric and floral patterns, signs, symbols etc. which are distinctly different from earlier paintings show strong stylistic and thematic analogies with modern pictures found in houses in the tribal belts and are attributed to a comparatively recent origin but confirm their popularity and common ethos. Conclusion- The aforesaid data which is generally neglected as a source of information not only- reveals the antiquity and development of rock art in India but also enriches the understanding about the way of life of the people of different cultural periods. The works of art on any</page><page sequence="16">Archaeology 1185 media, therefore, can tell about the contemporary flora, fauna, hunting, gathering and other subsistence tactics, use of variety of stone and metal implements besides social and religious aspects; which otherwise cannot be expected from any other branch of research in terms of time and space. All these works of art can be regarded as an influence of their living environment. The reason for this development is still open to speculation, but one should not overlook the decorative value of such forms of expression. Though many of these are highly abstract, atleast a few of them can be regarded as symbolic; while others are rich in descriptive details. The motif engraved on the Chandravati core and its variations found elsewhere in numerous early rock paintings clearly denote some religious connotations in Prehistoric art (Sonawane 1995-96). In this regard, the evidence obtained from the Upper Palaeolithic site of Baghor I (Son Valley, Madhy a Pradesh) offers an important convincing clue (Kenoyer et.al. 1983). The pictures of 'defied animals' often decorated with 'spiral' patterns are linked with the mythological stories prevalent among the tribais. Symbols are often considered as a material representation of ail immaterial concept. There is no visually obvious, association between the symbol and the entity which it represents. A typical non-iconic art is far more likely to be symbolic then the iconic art. The latter is only symbolic when the depiction of the object refers to an abstract concept (Bednarik 1994: 174). The depiction of 'defied' animals is the best example to illustrate this ideological concept!" Therefore, most of the graphic representations found in the Indian rock art served as expressions of their authors metaphysical beliefs. Hence, it is the reflection of human culture on the whole which the authors had experienced, observed, believed and lived as the manifestations of human society. However, knowing the weakness of the archaeological interpretation, Kenoyer has rightly pointed out that traditionally speaking, objects or patterns of objects with no definite or identifiable utilitarian function are, by default, srymbolic in function (Kenoyer 1987). The most .obvious example of this type of interpretation are rock paintings and carved objects; therefore, one has to be very cautious while interpreting any work related to rock art. At the same time there is a definite need for regional studies in rock art as the peculiarities of a micro- region should not be overlooked in a holistic macro-level study.
