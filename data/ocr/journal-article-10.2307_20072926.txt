<plain_text><page sequence="1">Tributes to Jonathan J. G. Alexander: The Making and Meaning of Illuminated Medieval and Renaissance Manuscripts, Art and Architecture. Edited by Susan L'Engle and Gerald B. Guest. 532 pp. incl. 242 b. &amp; w. ills. (Harvey Miller, London and Turnhout, 2006), XI37- ISBN 1-872501-47-8. Reviewed by ROBERT GIBBS University of Glasgow 'JONATHAN'S PUBLICATIONS HAVE always focused squarely on the iUuminated manuscript [. . .] from the early Middle Ages to the height of the Renaissance, from the British Isles to Italy. This breadth of interest has remained a constant throughout his career'. So opens this substantial volume: it might seem to be centred upon a contradiction until one reflects how few scholars can be considered masters of any thing like such a spread of Western art history or of the range of meanings associated with it. Manuscripts form the best preserved and most universal source for European culture down to and beyond the invention of printing. This universality of subject and approach has consis tendy informed Jonathan Alexander's research and teaching, since he and Otto Pacht stormed the resources of the Bodleian Library with an impetus that has probably never been matched.</page><page sequence="2">'Making' and 'Meaning' - both issues perti nent to some of Alexander's most important publications - were the themes provided by the editors to participants. The essays are arranged alphabetically in six sections, which makes for a rather confused sequence of material. The vol ume has a distinguished cast of contributors, and it might have been fruitful to ensure that their essays interacted as far as possible with each other. Fortunately, the illustrations are associated with the texts and printed to a high standard. Paul Crossley's account of the painful interaction of Nikolaus Pevsner's Germanic scholarship and John Betjeman's English snobbery would have stood better as an intro duction to the altogether happier interaction of the two cultures in the Bodleian Library; instead, several disparate essays by major schol ars are bundled together at the end of the book. The general impression of this volume is more diffuse than it should be: brief papers on con trasting subjects are much in evidence, as is the build up of essays on major topics and the illumination of neglected ones. Several papers reflect Alexander's early work, in both senses. Lawrence Nees's discus sion of the mid-Carolingian 'Jonathan Gospels' (actually signed 'Jonatham' by its scribe), reflecting earlier Late Antique sources, would have made an apposite opener, especially if associated with Jane Rosenthal's and Patrick McGurk's account of the Anglo-Saxon Gospel books owned by Judith of Flanders and with Margot Nishimura on the tenth-century Grey Gospels in Cape Town, although the works covered reach back even further to the Ashburnham Pentateuch and forward to the English Great Bible of 1539. A significant exception to the normal brevity of contributions is the posthumous publication of Albinia de la Mare's study of the books of Braccio Martelli, a Florentine human ist and son of a doctor of law who taught at Bologna and Florence. Both legal manuscripts and Bologna are prominent here, which prob ably would not have been the case before Alexander's influence on the discipline. Susan L'Engle contributes a study of legal manuscripts from that city, particularly the production processes evident in the Durham manuscripts first studied by Alexander, while Lilian Arm strong introduces a fine drawing of Hercules and Antaeus attributed to Marco Zoppo and serving as the flyleaf to a fine copy of the Peter Schoef fer edition of the Clementines. It might be noted that this edition of 1467 was not necessarily superseded by the Venetian edition of 1476, as Armstrong suggests, since it closely matches manuscript copies, and both this and the exem plar in the Fitzwilliam Museum, Cambridge, have illuminated initials: Schoeffer's might have remained an edition of choice for those with the resources. Kathleen Scott presents two fragments of a fifteenth-century legal compila tion by Thomas Bekyngton for Henry VI with remarkable anthropomorphic initials in grisaille, perhaps reflecting earlier legal manu scripts, just as the (later) representation of the King (Edward IV) in Council reflects the imagery of Civil and Canon Law. Extending the legal theme is Michael Kauffinann's account of the history of the Judgment of Solomon in universal legend and in twelfth- to fourteenth-century iUumination, particularly the Psalter and the Bible Historiale. The fifteenth century is particularly well represented, as befits both Alexander's work and the richness of the surviving material: Federica Toniolo and Gennaro Toscano on the early work of Girolamo da Cremona, Roger Wieck on Liberale da Verona, Giordana Mariani Canova on a Paduan Mantegnesque Plutarch in Link?ping, which she attributes to Giovanni Vendramin, and a fascinating study of the repetition of specific compositions and architectural settings in Franco-Flemish illumi nation by Fran?ois Avril. Lilian Randall's study of framed faces in manuscripts from the circle of the Bedford Hours omits the long previous history of such motifs in Bolognese illumi nation undoubtedly transmitted to the Bedford Master and French illuminators by the work of the Brussels Initials Master. The section on marginalia, to which the latter essay belongs, might have been better directed if incorporated within 'text and image'. Madelaine Caviness endeavours to explain the compound half-queen, half wyvern juxtaposed with Good Government at the opening of a copy of Aegidius Romanus' De regimine principum as an allegory of Mis(s!)rule, not an implausible account in itself, but one that she expands as a general principle for the reading of such grotesque compounds. She reminds us that the thir teenth and fourteenth centuries had marked periods of misogynistic politics, but much of her argument is tenuous at best. There is no consistent evidence for the specific reading of compound grotesques as 'freaks', let alone 'demons', and certainly not in such law books as the Decretum Gratiani in Tours that she cites. The earliest surviving Bolognese copy of this text, in Barcelona, uses such creatures not as marginal 'others' but as the very initials of its text. Giles of Rome's fellow friars, incidentally, would have been highly annoyed at Caviness's description of their prior general as an Augus tinian Canon, given the later conflicts between the two orders and his own role as the pioneer of the teachings of Aquinas! Ruth Mellinkoff provides a summary of her more plausible perception of such creatures as apotropaic, but it is unlikely if any simple general explanation beyond the proliferation of medieval ornament and fantasy fits both the exuberance of the finest and the routine repetition of the dullest examples, especially in secular manuscripts where they may be idly repeated by the dozen. More convincing are the essays on visual sermons, such as Nigel Morgan's study of the illustrations of friars preaching for the commen taries appended to text of a Bestiary related to the Lambeth Apocalypse, and Kathryn Smith's discussion of apocryphal miracles and misdeeds of the young Christ in the Holkham Bible Book and contemporary manuscripts. Martha Easton analyses the wound of Christ, represent ed in isolation as a vesica in several surviving manuscripts, to be seen as an 'inversion of the conception of the vagina as hell-mouth', resolving an evolving debate on the subject with the suggestion that the fourteenth-century viewer did not see the sexual and the spiritual as mutually exclusive. There are also oddities such as Pichard and Mary Rouse's account of the burial of a cat in a disastrous attempt to divine the thief who stole money from a Cistercian abbot in 1323 and Lucy Sandler's proposal that a dancing bear in a Bohun Psalter is perhaps a scribal portrait. Particularly useful is Alison Stones's account of the Bishop of Cambrai's Terrier with its illustrations of his lands and their taxes in the context of other manuscripts with such matter-of-fact descriptions of objects which she sees as part of the impact of Aris totelian empirical science. These are for the most part defined as 'Cultural Contexts', a sec tion opening with a study by Paul Binski of 'John the Smith's Grave', a modest inscription and indent that he justifiably calls 'provocative' for its early reference to the macabre and its reflection of the rapid social changes among the survivors of the Black Death to which the social rise of its owner testifies. It is impossible to do justice to the full range of papers or the often unfamiliar manuscripts discussed here. The volume provides a useful snapshot of the methodological expansion to which Jonathan Alexander has given a personal boost, as well as substantial papers that will con tinue to provide important reference material in the future. It should take its place alongside those major exhibition and library catalogues that complete the bibliography of Alexan der's own writings, distinctively arranged from reviews to papers to 'edited works'.</page></plain_text>
