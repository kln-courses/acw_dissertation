Mainland's Elementary Medical Sta- dent upon the pattern (aggregation) of both the prey and predator, and is increased by the presence of prey refuges. Stability of these model systems is also in- creased when there is mutual interference between searching predators, and when a predator is able to ex- hibit switching (taking a larger proportion of a common prey and a smaller proportion of a rare prey) between two or more potential prey species. These concepts, de- veloped by the author with their underlying mathemati- cal models, and bearing in mind some of the essential differences between predators and parasitoids, are ap- plied to the field of biological control. A few general- isations can be made, e.g. a host-specific parasitoid is likely to be a more efficient control organism than a polyphagous one, or the presence of hyperparasitoids will raise the pest's stable equilibrium density. Such conclusions are relatively mundane, and it is clear that there is still much to understand about the population dynamics of biological control. In the introduction to this review two criteria of the Princeton Series were mentioned: individualism and novelty. This book is certainly individualistic since so much of the work described has been published by the author (the reference section lists 26 papers of which Dr. Hassell is either author or co-author). Despite this individualistic approach, the subject matter of the book is well-balanced, except that population age structure, mentioned in the introductory chapter and the epilogue, is almost forgotten. Hence, this book will undoubtedly form an extremely useful textbook of population dy- namics. The second criterion, novelty, is not attained. The book surveys the subject, being essentially a re- view, and will not be seen to infuse new ideas into the science of ecology in the way that some of the other monographs in the series have done.

There is little in it which is likely to be of great interest to bio- metricians. Indeed, the only contribution with any di- rect bearing on biometry is a short paper using ther- modynamic and chemical analogies to connect speciation and population size in the Volterra model. There are also two articles which explore the uses of in- formation theory in theoretical biology. Apart from these and papers on inductive logic and on search the- ory, most of the contributions are concerned in some way with applications to statistical mechanics. There are two informative survey papers, also with a ther- modynamic flavour, which include some intriguing ap- plications among their references. P. E.

One cannot think of a better choice for the Se- ries' first reprint in biostatistics than Mainland's Ele- mentary Medical Statistics, as this book ranks with Bradford Hill's Principles of Medical Statistics in its in- fluence and impact on clinical research. In Socratic style, it reviews a research project from beginning to end using ten groups of questions. Current investigators brought up on statistical pack- ages and hand-held calculators would benefit by its commonsense approach. Today, we perhaps too readily apply high-powered computer-based procedures instead of thinking our way through the statistical analysis. Your students may find the style wordy. Medical stu- dents who had criticized my teaching as too mathemati- cal were asked to read Mainland and found the text ver- bose! For this reason and because it is out of date, this reprint is best used to supplement more recent develop- ments in statistical analysis. Many of these develop- ments, such as survival analysis,.di.screte multivariate analysis, sequential trials, etc. lie outside the book's scope. If Dr. Mainland could be persuaded to write a third edition he would surely include sections on the mangement of multi-center trials and natural history studies, in addition to rewriting his treatment of exact 2 x 2 tests and confidence limits, omitting the tables in favor of computational algorithms. It is doubtful, however, if anyone, let alone Dr. Main- land, could do this without in effect rewriting the whole book. This reprint is therefore welcome in that everyone should have a copy of Mainland on his shelf to remind him of the fundamentals. S. J.

Princeton University Press, Princeton, New Jersey, U.S.A., 1979, 352 pp. $20.00 cloth, $7.50 paper. The social insects have fascinated generations of biol- ogists and natural historians, partly because they appear somewhat anthropomorphic (terms like 'queen', 'sol- dier', 'worker', etc. are evidence of this) and partly be- cause the uniting of many individuals into an organic whole (developed to its greatest extent in the almost fic- tional writings of Eugene Morais) has attracted human imagination. With this wealth of uncritical interest in social insects it is extremely pleasant to read a book that critically analyses the evolution and role of eusociality. The book explores the origins of social structures and emphasises the eusociality threshold concept, first pub- lished in 1976 by E. O. Wilson. The eusocial insects ex- hibit three traits: cooperation in caring for the young, a division into reproducing and non-reproducing forms, and an overlap of at least two generations (usually ac- companied by a haploid/diploid reproductive process).</page></plain_text>
