IN an article on " The Psychological Standpoint" in MIND 41, I endeavoured to point out that the characteristic English development in philosophy-the psychological move- ment since Locke-had been neither a " threshing of old straw," nor a movement of purely negative meaning, whose significance for us was exhausted when we had learned how it necessarily led to the movement in Germany-the _so- called " transcendental" movement. Its positive signifi- cance was found to consist in the fact that it declared consciousness to be be the sole content, account and criterion of all reality; and psychology, as the science of this con- sciousness, to be the explicit and accurate determination of the nature of reality in its wholeness, as well as the deter- mination of the value and validity of the various elements or factors of this whole. It is the ultimate science of reality, because it declares what experience in its totality is; it fixes the worth and meaning, of its various elements by showing their development and place within this whole. It is, in short, phtilosophic vmethod. But that paper was necessarily largely negative, for it was necessary to point out that as matter of fact the movement had not been successful in 11</page><page sequence="2">154 J. DEWEY: presenting psychology as the method of philosophy, for it had not been true to its own basis and ideal. Instead of determining all, both in its totality and its factors, through consciousness, it had endeavoured to determine conscious- ness from something out of and beyond necessary relation to consciousness. It had determined its psychology from a dogmatically presupposed ontology, instead of getting at its ontology from a critical examination of the nature and con- tents of consciousness, as its standpoint required. It had a thing-in-itself, something whose very existence was to be opposed to consciousness, as in the unknowable "substances" of Locke, the transcendent Deity of Berkeley, the sensa- tions or impressions of Hume and Mill, the " transfigured real " of Spencer; and it used this thing-in-itself as the cause and criterion of conscious experience. Thus it con- tradicted itself; for, if psychology as method of philosophy means anything, it means that nothing shall be assumed except just conscious experience itself, and that the nature of all shall be ascertained from and within this. It is to the positive significance of psychology as philo- sophic meth6d-its significance when it is allowed to develop itself free from self-contradictory assumptions -that this present paper is directed. It was suggested in the previous paper that this method, taken in its purity, would show substantial identity with the presuppositions and results of the "transcendental" movemnent. And as the priincipal attacks upon the pretensions of psychology to be method for philosophy, or anything more than one of the special sciences, have come from representatives of this movement, this paper must be occupied with treating psychology in refereiice to what we may call German philosophy, as the other treated it in reference to English philosophy. In so far as the criticisms from this side have been occupied with pointing out the failure of the actual English psychology to be philo- sophy, there is of course no difference of opinion. That arises only in so far as these criticisms have seemed (seemved, I repeat) to imply that the same objections must hold against every possible psychology; while it seems to the writer that psychology is the only possible method. It is held, or seems to be held, by representatives of the post-Kantian movement, that man may be regarded in two aspects, in one of which he is an object of experience like other objects: he is a finite thing among other finite things; with these things he is in relatioins of action and reaction, but possesses the additional characteristic that he is a knowing, feeling, willing phenomenon. As such, he forms</page><page sequence="3">PSYCHOLOGY AS PHILOSOPHIC METHOD. 155 the object of a special science, psychology, which, like every other special science, deals with its material as pure object, abstracting from that creative synthesis qf subject and object, self-consciousness, through which all things are and are known. It is therefore, like all the special sciences, partial and utterly inadequate to determining the nature and mean- ing of that whole with which philosophy has to deal. Nay more, it is itself ultimately dependent upon philosophy for the determination of the meaning, validity and limits of the principles, categories and method which it unconsciously assumes. To regard psychology therefore as philosophic method is to be guilty of the same error as it would be to regard the highest generalisations of, say, physics, as ade- quate to determining the problems of philosophy. It is an attempt to determine the unconditioned whole, self-con- sciousness, by that which has no existence except as a conditioned part of this very whole. "Metaphysics (saLys Prof. Caird) has to deal with conditions of the knowable, and hence witlh self-conlsciousn-ess or that unity which is im- plied in all that is and is known. Psychology has to inquire how this self-consciousness is realised or developed in man, in whom the conscious- ness of self grows with the consciousness of a world in timne and space, of which he individually is only a part, and to parts of which only he stands in imiiiediate relation. In conisidering the former question we are Con- sidering the sphere within which all knowledge anid all objects of know- ledge are contained. In consider inc, the latter, we are selecting, oile particulai object or class of objects within this sphere. . . It is possible to have a purely objective anthropology or psychology-which abstracts from the relatioin of man to the mfind tha? knows himn -just as it is possible to lhave a purely objective science of nature." 1 The other aspect of man is that in which he, as self-con- scious, has manifested in him the unity of all being and knowing, and is not finite, i.e., an object or event, but is, in virtue of his self-conscious nature, infinite, the bond, the living union of all objects and events. With this infinite, universal self-consciousness, philosophy deals; with man as the object of experience, psychology deals. In stating the position of the post-Kantian movement, I used the word seemed, and used it advisedly, as I do not conceive that at bottom there is any difference of opinion. But it seems to me that there are invariably involved in the reasonings of this school certain presuppositions regarding the real science of psychology which, probably for the reason that the writers have seen such misuse made of a false IArt.

DEWEY: psychology, are not distinctly stated, and which, accordingly, not only lessen the convincing force with which their reason- ings are received by those unacquainted with the necessity and rationality of these presuppositions, but which also, as not distinctly thought out, tend at times to involve these reasonings in unnecessary obscurity and eveni contradictiolns. It is these presuppositions regarding the nature of a real psychology, lyillg at the basis of all the work of the post- Kantian school, conditioning it and giving it its worth, which it is the object of this paper to examine. The start is miade accordingly from the supposed distinc- tion of aspects in man's nature, according to one of which he is an object of experience and the subject of psychology, and according to the other of which, he, as self-conscious- ness, is the universal condition and unity of all experience, aind hence not an object of experienee. As I have already referred to Prof. Adamson's treatment of this distinction, let me refer to a later writing of his which seems to retract all that gave validity to this distinction. In a recent number of MIND (ix. 434), after pointing out that the subject-matter of psychology cauniot be pure objects but must always be the reference of an individual subject to a content which is universal, he goes on with the following most admirable statement: "It is in and throughl the conscious life of the indiviclual that all the thinking and acting which form the material for other treat- ient is realised. When we isolate the content and treat it as having a quasi-existence per se, we are in the attitude of objective or natural science. When we endeavoui to interpret the significance of the whole, to deter- mine the meaning of the connective links that blind it together, we are in the attitude of philosophy. But when we regard the Iio(les through which knowledg-e and acting are realised in the life of an individual sub- ject, we are in the position of the psychological inquirer." Now, when psychology is defined as the science of the realisa- tion of the universe in and through the individual, all pretence of regarding psychology as merely one of the special scienees, whose subject-matter by necessity is simply some one department of the universe, considered out of relation to the individual, is, of course, abandoned. With this falls, as a matter of course, the supposed two-fold character of man's nature. If the essence of his iiature is to be the realisation of the universe, there is no aspect in which, as wiagi, it ap- pears as a mere object or event in the universe. The dis- tinction is now transferred to the two ways of looking at the same material, and no loniger concerns two distinct materials. Is this distinction, however, any more valid? Is there</page><page sequence="5">PSYCHOLOGY AS PHILOSOPHIC METHOD. 157 any reason for distinguishing between the modes through which the universe is realised in an individual, and the significance of this universe as a whole ? At first sight there may appear to be, but let us consider the following questions. Does the whole have any significance beyond itself ? If we consider experience in its absolute totality so far as realised in the individual, can the " significance of the whole" be determined beyond what itself testifies to as a whole; and do the "connective links which bind together" have any " meaning" except just as they do bind together ? And since this whole and these connective links are given to us by the science of psychology, what is this except com- pleted philosophic method, and what more has philosophy to do except to abstract from this totality, and regard it, on its material side, as philosophy of nature, and on its formal as real logic? Psychology, as science of the realisation through the individual of the universe, answers the question as to the significance of the whole, by giving that whole, and at the same time gives the meaning of the parts and of their connexionl by showing just their place within this whole. It would be fatal to the existence of philosophy as well as of psychology to make any distinction here. W/ere not the universe realised in the individual, it would be impossible for the individual to rise to a universal point of view, and hence to philosophise. That the universe has not been completely realised in man is no more an objection to the employment of psychology as the determination of the nature of this universe, than it is to any treatment of philo- sophy whatever. In no way can the individual philosophise about a universe which has not been realised in his conscious experience. The universe, except as realised in an individual, has no existence. In man it is partially realised, and man has a partial science; in the absolute it is completely realised, and God has a complete science. Self-conscious- ness means simply an individualised universe; and if this universe has not been realised in man, if man be not self- conscious, then no philosophy whatever is possible. If it has been realised, it is in and through psychological ex- perience that this realisation has occurred. Psychology is the scientific account of this realisation, of this individua- lised universe, of this self-consciousness. What other account can be given ? It is the object of this paper to show that no other account can be given. Not only is any final distinction or dualism, even of aspects, in man's nature utterlv untenable, but no distinction even of aspects can be</page><page sequence="6">158 J. DEWEY: made in the treatment of man's nature. Psychology has to do with just the consciousness which constitutes man's ex- perience, aand all further determinations of experience fall within this psychological determination of it, and are hence abstract. More definitely, Psychology, and not Logic, is the method of Philosophy. Let us deal seriatim with these two questions. I. No such distinction in the nature of man, as that in one aspect he is "part of the partial world," and hence the subject of a purely natural science, psychology, and in aniother the conscious subject for which all exists, the subject of philosophy, can be mainitained. This is our first assertion. Let us turn again to that most lucid and comprehensive statement of philosophic doctrine by Prof. Caird, from which extract has already been made. The distinction to be upheld is that between the "sphere in which all knowledge and all objects of knowledge are con- tained" and " one particular object within this sphere ". The question which at once arises is, How does this distinction come about ? Granted that it is valid, how is man known as requiring in his nature this distinction for his proper comprehension ? There is but onae possible answer: it is a distinction which has arisen within and from conscious experience itself. In the course of inan's realisation of the universe there is necessitated this distinction. This dis- tinction therefore falls within the sphere of psychology, and cannot be used to fix the position of psychology. Much less canpsychologybe identified with some one aspect of experieince which has its origin only within that experienice which in its wholeness constitutes the material of psychology. The dis- tinction, as we shall immediately see, cannot be an absolute one: by no possibility or contingency can man be regarded as merely one of objects of experience; but so far as the dis- tinction has relative validity it is a purely psychological one, originating because man in his experience, at different stages of it, finds it necessary to regard himself in two lights,-in one of which he is a particular space- and time-coinditioned being (we cannot say object or event) or activity, and in the other the unconditioned eternal synthesis of all. At most the distinction is only one of various stages in one and the same experience, both of which, as stages of experience-one, indeed, of experience in its partiality and the other of experience in its totality-fall within the science of experience, viz., psycho- logy.</page><page sequence="7">PSYCHOLOGY AS PHILOSOPHIC METHOD. 159 We will see how the qiiestion stands if we state it other- wise. Does or does not the self-consciousness of man fall within the science of psychology? What reason can be given for excltuding it? Certainly few would be found so thorough-going as to deny that perception is a miiatter which that scieince must treat; those however who admit percep- tion would find themselves hard put to it to give a reason for excluding memory, imagination, conception, judgment, reasoning. Why having reached the stage of reasoning, where the original implicit individual with which we began has been broken up into the greatest possible number of explicit relations, shall we rule out self-consciousness where these relations are again seen united into an individual unity? There is no possible break: either we must deny the possibility of treating perception in psychology, and then our " purely objective science of psychology " can be nothing more than a physiology; or, admitting it, we must admit what follows directly from and upon it-self-consciousness. Self-consciousness is indeed a fact (I do not fear the word) of experience, and must therefore find its treatmeent in psychologv. But this is not all. Not onily does self-consciousness appear as one of the stages of psychological experience, but the explanation of the simplest psychological fact-say one of perception, or feeling, or impulse-involves necessary reference to self-consciousness. Self-consciousness is in- volved in every simpler process, and no one of them can be scientifically described or comprehended except as this invo- lution is brought out. In fact, their comprehension or explanation is simply bringing to light this iinplication of self-consciousness within them. This would be the last thing that the upholders of self-consciousness as the final unity and synthesis, the absolute meaning of experience, could deny. The organic nature of self-consciousness being their thesis, it must indeed reveal itself in, or rather consti- tute, each of its members and phases. The very existence of any idea or feeling being ultimately its relation to self- consciousness, what other account of it can be given except its organic placing in the system? If there be such an act as perception, a candid, careful examination of it, not of its logical conditions, but of itself as matter of experienced fact, will reveal what it is; and this revelation will be the declaration of its relation to that organic system which in its wholeness is self-consciousness. We may then abstract from this relation, which constitutes its very being, and consider it as an object of perceptionv, and, generalisinig the case, produce a</page><page sequence="8">160 J. DEWEY: philosophy of nature; or, considering it as conditioned by thought, we may thus produce a logic. But both of these proceedings go on in abstraction from its real being, and cannot give the real method of philosophy. In short, the real esse of things is neither their percipi, nor their gintelligi alone; it is their experiri. - Logic may give us the science of the intelligi, the philosophy of nature of the percipi, but only psychology can give us the systematic connected account of the experiri, which is also in its wholeness just the experior- self-consciousness itself. We may see how the matter stands by inquiring what would be the effect upon philosophy if self-consciousness were not an experienced fact, i.e., if it were not one actual stage in that realisation of the universe by an individual which is defined as constituting the sphere of psychology. The result would be again, precisely, that no such thing as philosophy, under any theory of its nature whatever, is pos- sible. Philosophy, it cannot be too often repeated, consists simply in viewing things sutb specie ceternitatis or in ordine ad universum. If man, as matter of fact, does not realise the nature of the eternal and the universal within himself, as the essence of his own b,eing; if he does not as one stage of his experience consciously, and in all stages implicitly, lay hold of this universal and eternal, then it is mere matter of words to say that he can give no account of things as they uni- versally and eternally are. To deny, therefore, that self- consciousness is a matter of psychological experience is to deny the possibility of any philosophy. What the denial comes to we have had historically de- monstrated in Kant. He admits perception and conception as matters of experience, but he draws the line at self-con- sciousness. It is worth noticing that his reason for denying it is not psychological at all, but logical. It is not because self-consciousness is not a fact, but because it cannot be a fact according to his logical presuppositions. The results following the denial are worthy of notice as corresponding exactly to what we might be led to expect: first, with the denial of the fact of self-consciousness comes the impossi- bility of solving the problem of philosophy, expressed in the setting up of an unknown thing-in-itself as the ultimate ground and condition of experience; and, secondly, comes the failure to bring perception and conception into any organic connexion with experience, that is, the failure to really comprehend and explain them, manifested in the limitation of both perception, through the forms of space and time, and thinking, through the categories, to pheno-</page><page sequence="9">PSYCHOLOGY AS PHILOSOPHIC METHOD. 161 mena which are in no demonstrable connexion with reality. The failure to recognise self-consciousness as a stage of psychological experience leads not only to a failure to reach the alternate synthesis of experience, but renders it im- possible to explain the simpler forms of psychological experi- ence. This failure of Kant teaches us another lesson also, in that, as already stated, it was due to abandoning his real method, which was psychological, consisting in the self- knowledge of reason as an organic system by reason itself, and setting up a logical standard (in this latter case the principles of non-contradiction and identity), by which to determine the totality of experience. The work of Hegel consisted essentially in showing that Kant's logical standard was erroneous, and that, as matter of logic, the only true criterion or standard was the organic notion, or Begriff, which is a systematic totality, and accordingly able to ex- plain both itself and also the simpler processes and princi- ples. That Hegel accomplished this work successfully and thoroughly there can be to the writer no doubt; but it seems equally clear that the work of Kant is in need of another complemnent, following more closely his own con- ception of method and of philosophy, which shall consist in showing self-consciousness as a fact of experience, as well as perception through organic forms and thinking through organic principles. And it s'eems further that, only when this has been done, will, for the first time, the presupposi- tions latent in the work of Hegel, which give it its convincing force and validity, be brought out. Again, it seems worthy of note, that the late Prof. Green (of whom the writer would not speak without ex- pressing his deep, almost reverential gratitude), when fol- lowing out Kant's work from its logical side, hardly escaped Kant's negative results. (By Kant's logical method we mean the inquiry into the necessary cognditions of experience; by his psychological method the inquiry into the actctal nature of experience.) After his complete demonstration of con- sciousness as the final condition, synthesis and unity of all that is or is knowable, he finds himself obliged to state (Prolegg. to Ethics, p. 54): " As to what that consciousness in itself or in its completeness is, we can only make negative statements. lihat there is such a consciousness is implied in the existence of the world; but what it is we can only iknow through its so far acting in us as to enable us, however partially and interruptedly, to have knowledge of a world or an intelligent experience." Had he begun from the latter statement, and shown as matter of fact that this universal</page><page sequence="10">162 J. DEWEY: consciousness had realised itself, though only partially and interruptedly, in us, he certainly would have been able to make very positive statements regarding it, arid would also have furnished a basis in fact for his logical method, which now seems to hang upon nothing but a unity of which all that can be said is that it is a unity, and that it is not any- thing in particular. When one reflects that it is not only upon the existence of this unity, but upon its working in and through us, that all philosophy and philosophising depend, one caninot conceal the apprehension that too great a load of philosophy has been hung upon too feeble a peg. So, too, after his victorious demonstration that upon the existence of this spiritual unity depends the possibility of all moral experience, he finds himself obliged to state. (p. 180), with that candour so characteristic of all his think- ing: " Of a life of completed development, of activity with the end attained, we can only speak or think in negatives, and thus only can we speak or think of that state of being in wvhich, according to our theory, the ultimateb nmoral good must consist ". Once more, had he started from the fact that as matter of actual realisation this absolute good has been reproduced in our lives and the end attained (for surely the good is a matter of quality and not of quantity, and the end a power, not a sum), he would not have found himself in this difficulty. But with a purely logical method, one can end only with the mibutst be or the ought: the is vanishes, because it has been abstracted from. The psycho- logical method starts from the is, and thereby also gives the basis and the ideal for the ought and mvust be. But it is time that we returned to our thesis, which, in brief, was that no distinction which maintains that psycho- logy is the science of man as " part of this partial world" can be maintained. The following reasons for this denial have been given: it was pointed out that the relativeb validity which this distinction in man's nature undoubtedly possesses is itself the product and manifestation of psycho- logical experience; that man as mian, or as the conscious experience whose science is psychologv, is self-conscious, and that therefore self-consciousness as the unity of subject and object, not as "purely objective," as the totality, not as a " part," must be included in the science of psychology; and that furthermore this treatment of self-consciousness is necessary for the explanation and comprehension of any partial fact of conscious experience. And finally, it was. pointed out that the denial of self-consciousness as constitut-</page><page sequence="11">PSYCHOLOGY AS PHILOSOPHIC METHOD. 163 ing matter of experience, and hence of psychology, was the denial of the possibility of philosophy itself; anid this was illustrated by historic examples. Before passing on to the second topic, I wish briefly to return to Prof. Caird's ex- position, and shelter myself somewhat beneath the wings of his authority. In the article already referred to, he goes on to state that the natural objective scienee of inan after all " omits the distinctive characteristic of man's being "; that while we may treat inorg,anic nature and even- organic with purely natural objective methods anid principles, because " they are niot unities for t/hemseves, but only for vs," such treatmen-t cannot be applied to manl, for man is fjr hiimself, i.e., is niot a pure object, but is self-colsciousness. Thus, he continues (p. 89): " In man, in so far as lhe is self-conscious -and it is .elf-consciousnless that makes himb ntan-the unity through wlichl all things are and are known is manifeste(d. . . . Therefore to treat h-imii as a simply natuiral being is even more iniaccutrate and nisleadbinl tlhani to forget or deny hiis re- lationi to natuire altogether. A true psychology niuist avoid botlh errors: it must coniceive man as at once spirituial a(Il nattral ; it miust fincl a reconciliation of free(lom andl necessity. It miiust fatce all the difficulties involved ini the coniception of the absolutte priinciple of self-conisciouisniess- throughIl which all things are and are known uas mnofestnfg itself int the lifre of a being lilce mban, whl o ' comiies to himiiself ' only by (a lo, l)rocess of developmenet out of the unconsciotusness of a merely animal existence." When it is stated, later on, that the natural science of man " is niecessarily abstract and imperfect, as it omits from its view the central fact in the life of the object of which it treats" (p. 92), it is hardly worth while discussing whether there be any such science or n-ot. But there is suggested for us in the quotation just made our second problem- the final relation of psychology, which confessedly must deal with self-consciousness, to philosophy. For there the pro- blem of psychology was stated to be the question of the " absolute principle of self-consciousness, manifesting itself in the life of a being like nman ". That is, it is here suggested that psychology does not deal with the absolute principle in itself, but only with the modes by which this is manifested or realised in the life of man. Psychology no longer ap- pears as an objective science; it now comes before us as a phenomenology, presupposing, a science of the absolute reality itself. It is to this questionl that I now turn. Is psyehology the science mnerely of the manifestation of the Absolute, or is it the scienee of the Absolute itself ?</page><page sequence="12">164 J. DEWEY: IL. The relation of Psychology to Philosophy now stands, I suppose, something like this:-There is an absolute self- consciousness. The science of this is philosophy. This absolute self-consciousness manifests itself in the knowing anrd acting of individual men. The science of this manifesta- tion, a phenomenology, is psychology. The distinction is no longer concerned with man's being itself; it is a distinc- tion of treatment, of ways of looking at the same material. Before going to its positive consideration the following ques- tions may suggest the result we desire to reach. How does there come about this distinction between the " spiritual" and the " natural," betweeii " freedom " and " necessity"? How does there come into our knowledge the notion of a distinction between the " absolute principle of self-conscious- ness)" and " man coming to himself only by a long process of development out of the unconsciousness of a inerely animal existence "? Is this a distinction which falls outside the subject-matter of psychology, and which may therefore be used to determine it; or is it one which has originated withbin psychological experience, and whose nature therefore, instead of being capable of fixing the character of psychology, must itself be determined by psychology ? Furthermore, what is this distinction between the absolute self-consciousness and its manifestation in a being like man? Is the absolute self- consciousness complete in itself, or does it involve this realisation and manifestation in a being like man ? If it is complete in itself, how can any philosophy which is limited to " this absolute principle of self-consciousness " face and solve the difficulties involved in its going beyond itself to manifest itself in self-consciousness ? This cannot be what is meant. The absolute self-consciousness must involve within itself, as organic member of its very being and activity, this manifestation and revelation. Its being must be this realisation and inanifestation. Granted that this realisation and manifestation is an act not occurring in time, but eternally completed in the nature of the Absolute, and that it occurs only " partially " and " interruptedly " through (nlot in) time, in a being like man,-the fact none the less remains that philosophy, under any theory of its nature, can deal with this absolute self-consciousness only so far as it has par- tially and interruptedly realised itself in man. For man, as object of his philosophy, this Absolute has existence only so far as it has manifested itself in his conscious experience. To return to our questions: If the material of philosophy be the</page><page sequence="13">PSYCHOLOGY AS PHILOSOPHIC METHOD. 165 absolute self-consciousness, and this absolute self-conscious- ness is the realisation and manifestation of itself, and as material for philosophy exists only in so far as it has realised and manifested itself in man's conscious experience, an-d if psychology be the science of this realisation in man, what else can philosophy in its fulness be but psychology, and psychology but philosophy ? These questions are stated only to suggest the end which we shall endeavour to reach. I shall not attempt to answer them directly, but to consider first the relations of Psycho- logy to Science, and hence to Philosophy; and secondly to Logic. (1) The Relation of Psychology to Science.-Psychology is the completed method of philosophy, because in it science and philosophy, fact and reason, are one. Philosophy seems to stand in a double relation to Science. In its first aspect it is a science-the highest of all sciences. We take one sphere of reality and ask certain questionis regarding it, and the answers give us some one science; we find in the process that this sphere of reality can only artificially be thus iso- lated, and we broaden and deepen our question, until finally, led by the organic connexion of science with science, we ask after the nature of all reality, as one connected system. The answer to this question constitutes philosophy as one science amid the circle of sciences. But to continue to re- gard it in this way is to fail to grasp the meaninig of the process which has forced us into philosophy. At the same time that philosophy is seen as the completion of the sciences, it is seen as their basis. It is no longer a science; it is Science. That is to say, the same movement of thought and reality which forces upon us the conception of a science which shall deal with the totality of reality forces us to recognise that no one of our previous sciences was in strict truth science. Each abstracted from certain larger aspects of reality, and was hence hypothetical. Its truth was con- ditioned upon the truth of its relations to that whole which that science, as special science, could not investigate with- out giving up its own independent existence. Only in this whole is categorical truth to be found, and only as cate- gorical truth is found in this whole is the basis found for the special sciences. Philosophy as the science of this whole appears no longer therefore as a science, but as all science taken in its organic systematic wholeness,-not merely to which every so-called special science is something subordinate, but of which it constitutes an organic member. Philosophy has no existence except as the organic living unity and bond</page><page sequence="14">166 J. DEWEY: of these sciences; they have no existence except through their position in this living synthesis. Now the question is, where does psychology stand within this organism ? On the one hand, psychology is certainly a positive science. It finds its materials in certain facts and events. As to systematic observation, experiment, conclu- sion and verification, it can differ in no essential way from any one of them. It is based upon and deals with fact, and aims at the ordered comprehension and explanation of fact as any special science does. Yet the whole drift of this paper has been to show that in some way psychology does differ very essentially from any one of them. Where shall we find this difference? In one word, its relation to them is precisely that which we have discovered philosophy to bear: it is not only a science, but it turns out to be science as an organic system, in which every special science has its life, and from which it must abstract when it sets up for an independent existence of its own. We begin with any special science. That turns out to be not only some one department or sphere of reality, but also some one depart- ment of conscious experience. From one science to another we go, asking for some explanation of conscious experience, until we come to psychology, which gives us an account of it, in its own behalf, as neither mathematics, nor phy- sics, naor biology does. So far we have only a special science, though the highest and most concrete of all. But the very process that has made necessary this new science reveals also that each of the former sciences existed only in abstraction from it. Each dealt with some one phase of conscious experience, and for that very reason could not deal with the totality which gave it its being, consciousness. But in psychology we have the manifestation and explication of this consciousness. It gives in its wholeness what each of them would give in part, viz., the nature of experience, and hence is related to themn as the whole is to the part. It appears no longer, therefore, as the highest of sciences: it appears as Science itself, that is, as systematic account and comprehension of the nature of conscious experience. Mathematics, physics, biology exist, because conscious ex- perience reveals itself to be of such a naature, that one may make virtual abstraction from the whole, and consider a part by itself, without damage, so long as the treatment is purely scientific, that is, so long as the implicit connexion with the whole is left undisturbed, and the attempt is iiot made to present this partial science as metaphysic, or as an explanation of the whole, as is the usual fashion of our</page><page sequence="15">PSYCHOLOGY AS PHILOSOPHIC METHOD. 167 uncritical so-called "scientific philosophies". Nay more, this abstraction of some one sphere is itself a living function of the psychologic experience. It is not merely something which it allows: it is something which it does. It is the analytic aspect of its own activity, whereby it deepens and renders explicit, realises its own nature; just as their con- nexion with each other is the synthetic aspect of the same self-realising movement, whereby it returns to itself: while psychology in its completeness is the whole self-developing activity itself, which shows itself as the organic unity of both synthetic and analytic movements, and thus the con-di- tion of their possibility and ground of their validity. The analytic movement constitutes the special sciences; the syn- thetic constitutes the philosophy of nature; the self-deve- loping activity itself, as psychology, constitutes philosophy. What other position can be given psychology, so soon as we recognise the absurdity and impossibility of considering it a purely objective science ? It is the science of the modes by which, in and through the individual, the universe is realised, it is said. But that the universe has no existence except as absolutely realised in an individual, i.e., except as self-consciousness, is precisely the result of philosophy, anid can therefore be no objection to such a consideration of the universe: in fact, such a statement only amounts to saying that psychology considers the universe as it really is. If the assertion is varied again, to read that philosophy treats of this individualised universe as it eternally is, while psy- chology cana treat of it only as it partially and interruptedly becomes, this loses sight of two very important facts. First, philosophy can treat of absolute self-consciousness only in so far as it has become in a being like man, for otherwise it is not material for philosophy at all; and, secondly, it falls into the error of regarding this realisation in man as a time-con- ditionied product, which it is not. Time is not somethiiig outside of the process of conscious experience; it is a form within it, one of the functions by which it organically con- stitutes its own being In fact, psychology as philosophic method has an immense advantage at just this poilnt over any other method of treating this problem. To any philo- sophy attempting to consider the absolute self-consciousness by itself, it must remain for ever an insoluble problem why the is should ever appear as becoming, why the eternal should ever appear through the temporal. Psychology solves the problem by avoiding the assumption which makes it a problem. For, dealing with an individualised universe, one of whose functions of realisation is time, it knows nothing</page><page sequence="16">168 J. DEWEY: about any consciousness which is out of relation to time. The case is just here: if philosophy will deal with the abso- lute conasciousness conceived as purely eternlal, out of relation to time, then the existence of that which constitutes the actual content of man's experienice is utterly inexplicable; it is not only a mystery, but a mystery which conatradicts the very nature of that which is, ex hypothlesi, the absolute. If philosophy does deal with the eternal absolute conscious- ness as for ever realised, yet as for ever having time as one of its organic functions, it is not open to any one to bring charges against psychology as philosophy, for this afnd no more psychology does. The question just comes to this: If we start from reason alone we shall never reach fact. If we start with fact, we shall find it revealing itself as reason. The objection to an account of fact or experience as philosophy is but a preju- dice, though historically considered a well-grounded one. On the one hand, it has arisen because some partial accounit of experience, or rather account of partial experience, has beeni put forth as the totality, and just because thus put forth as absolute has lost even the relative validity which it possessed as partial. Such is the procedure of Empiricism. On the other hand, we have had put forth as matter of fact certaini truths declared to be immediate anid necessary and intuitive, coming no one knows whence and meaning no one knows what. The aversion to immediacy, to " unde- duced" fact, as given us by the Intuitionalists, is certainily a well-grounded one. But neither of these objections lies against psychology as accounit of the facts of experience. Men are mortal, and every actual account of experience will suffer from the defects of mortals, and be but partial, no doubt; unfortunately we are none of us om-niscient yet. But the very essence of psychology as method is that it treats of experience in its absolute totality, not setting up some one aspect, of it to account for the whole, as, for example, our physical evolutionists do, nor yet attempting to determine its nature from something outside of and beyond itself, as, for example, our so-called empirical psy- chologists have done. The vice of the procedure of both is at bottom precisely the same-the abstracting of some one element from the organism which gives it meaning, and setting it up as absolute. It is nio wonder that the organism always has its revenge by pronouncing this abstracted ele- ment " unknowable ". The only wonder is that men should still bow in spirit before this creation of their own abstracting thought, and reverence it as the cause and ground of all</page><page sequence="17">PSYCHOLOGY AS PHILOSOPHIC METHOD. 169 reality and knowledge. There is indeed an anthropomor- phism which is degrading, but it is the anthropomorphism which sets up the feeblest element of its own thinking, pure being, as Mr. Spencer does, or the poorest element of its own feeling, a sensation, and reverences that as its own and the universe's cause. That is the anithropomorphism of the enslaved thought which has not yet awakened to the con- sciousness of its own totality and spiritual freedom. Nor does the account of fact given by psychology have anything in commonl with the " ultimate, inexplicable, necessary" ment,al facts called intuitions. The fact of psychology reveals itself as precisely reason, which thereby accounts for itself, and in accounting for itself accounts for all its members. The fact of psychology is not -isolated "truths," but the organic system of self-conlsciousness. This fact is indeed " immediate," but it is iminediate only in and through a process, hence of mediation. It is indeed self-evidencing, but what it evidences is simply, of the parts, relation to and dependence upon the whole, and of the whole, that it is self-conditioned and self-related. Of the whole fact it may be said indeed that it is iniexplicable. "It is true that we cainnot explain the spiritual principle which is implied in all experience by reference to anything else than itself."'I "Because all we can experience is in- cluded in this one world, and all our inferences and explana. tions relate only to its details, neither it as a whole, nor the one consciousness which constitutes it, can be accounted for in the ordinary sense of the word. They cannot be accounted for by what they include; and being all-inclusive, there remains nothing else by which they can be accounted for." 2 In short, any system of philosophy must ultimately fall back on the fact for which no reason can be given except precisely just that it is what it is. This implication of fact 3 is latent in all philosophy whatever, and all that psychology as philosophic method does is to render this necessary iun- plication explicit. It alone starts from the completed fact, and it alone is therefore completed philosophy. If it may have seemed at times in the course of the dis- cussion that the nominal subject-the relation of psychology to science-had been left, it will now appear, I thinik, that we have all the timne been dealing with just that subject. I Prof. E. Caird, MIND viii. 560. 2 Green, P'rolegomena to Ethics, p. 52. 3 The insistence upon this seems to have been Lotze's great work as a philosopher. 12</page><page sequence="18">170 J. DEWEY: Science is the systematic account, or reason of fact; Psycho- logy is the comnpleted systematic account of the ultimate fact, which, as fact, reveals itself as reason, and hence accounts for itself, and gives the " reasons " of all sciences. The other point, the relation of psychology to logic, has al- ready been dealt with by implication, and need not detain us long again. (2) The Relation of Psychology to Logic.-The whole course of philosophic thought, so far as the writer can comprehend it, has consisted in showing that any distinction between the form and the matter of philosophic truth, between the content and the method, is fatal to the reaching of truth. Self-consciousness is the final truth, and in self-conscious- ness the form as organic system and the content as organ- ised system are exactly equal to each other. It is a process which, as form, has produced itself as matter. Psychology as the account of this self-consciousness must necessarily fulfil all the conditions of true method. Logic, since it neces- sarily abstracts from the ultimate fact, cannot reach in matter what it points to in form. While its content, if it be true philosophy, must be the whole content of self-consciousness or spirit, its form is only one process within this content, that of thought-conditions, the Idee. While the content is the eternal nature of the universe, its form is adequate only to " thinking what God thouight and was before the creation of the world," that is, the universe in its unreality, in its abstraction. It is this contradiction between content and form in logic which makes it not philosophic method, but only one moment within that method. No contradiction Tesults as soon as logic is given its proper place within the system. The contradiction occurs when, at the same moment that it is said that logic is " abstract," the logical method is still said to be the method of philosophy. Such contradictions certainly appear to exist, for example, in the philosophy of Hegel. They have been often pointed out, and I shall only summarise them, following for the most part a recent writer.' There is no way of getting from logic to the philosophy of nature logically. The only way is to fall back upon the fact; " we know from experience" that we have nature as well as the Idee. In truth we do not go from logic to nature at all. The movement is a re- verse movement. " In reality, the necessity for any such transition is purely factitious, because the notions never existed otherwise than in nature and spirit. . . . They were got I Prof. A. Seth, " Hegel: an Exposition and Criticism," MIND 24.</page><page sequence="19">PSYCHOLOGY AS PHILOSOPHIC METHOD. 171 by abstraction from the concrete. . . . We owe, there- fore, no apology for a return to the reality from which we took them." In short, it is necessity of fact, a necessity of coniscious experience, which takes us from the realm of the Idee to the realm of nature, from the sphere of thought- conditions to the sphere of existent relations. " The same is true when we pass to the philosophy of spirit. The general fornm of personality is deducible, but not a living human spirit with its individual thoughts, feelings and actions." This remains " the incomprehensible and inexpli- cable point in philosophy". And so it does undoubtedly while we regard logic as method of philosophy. But this " inexplicability" is but the express condemnation of the method, not a fact to be contented with. If we go deeper and inquire not how is the transition from logic to the philosophy of nature or to the philosophy of spirit made, but how is any transition whatever possible, we find the same difficulty. It exists only by reason of the presupposed fact. "We cannot in strictness say that the result has been independently proved, because it has been reached in this fashion by the method. It was presupposed in the method all along." In a definite case, how is the transition, say from the category of quality to that of quantity, made ? It occurs not by virtue of the category of quality in itself, but by virtue of the fact that the whole Idee is implicitly contained in the principle of quality, and must manifest itself, which it does by forcing quality, as an inadequate ex- pression of its own nature, into quantity, which expresses its being more fully. And thus the process continues until the Idee has manifested itself as the whole organic system, which has expressed explicitly all that which in Idee it is. But this movement itself depends on spirit, and on the mani- festation of spirit in nature, as already seen. Every purely logical transition therefore occurs at bottom because of fact, i.e., seen in its wholeness it is not a logical transition but a factual. Psychology, as philosophic method, merely starts from this everywhere presupposed fact, and by so doing, for the first time, gives logic its basis and validity. There can be no escape from this result by saying that after all in the philosophy of spirit, spirit is shown to be the prius and condition of the whole, as it undoubtedly is by Hegel himself. This merely brings the contradiction itself into clearer light. For logic, being thus confessedly determined as abstract, is still retained to determine the nature of the concrete. Logic, while it is thus declared to be only one moment of spirit, is still used to determine the</page><page sequence="20">172 J. DEWEY: nature of the whole. Thus is revealed the contradiction between form and content involved in the use of logic as the method of philosophy. Spirit is reached by a logical process, and the logical result is that as fact it is not reached at all. As concrete, it is beyond the reach of any abstract process. Either one must call in the aid of the presupposed but suppressed Fact, and recognise that after all the process has been going on within a further and higher determina- tion; or, failing to see this, must recognise Spirit as only one factor or moment of the logical movement, that is, give up the notion of self-consciousness as subject, anid fall back into Spinozistic pantheism. The logical movement, con- sidered by itself, is always balancinig in unstable equilibrium between dualism and pantheism. Set up as absolute method, it either recognises the fact, but being unable to comprehend it, has to regard this fact, as foreign element over against it, as the matter of Plato and Aristotle, the thing-in-itself of Kant, and Anstoss of Fichte,' or endeavours to absorb the Fact as a mere element in its own logical being, and falls into Pantheism. This is the reason why Hegel, although the very centre of his system is self-conditioned spirit, lends himself so easily to pantheistic treatment. Logic cannot reach, however much it may point to, an actual individual. The gathering up of the universe into the one self-conscious individuality it may assert as necessary, it cannot give it as reality. It is only as logic contradicts itself and faces back on the con- stant presupposition of this reality that it can demonstrate what it asserts. Taken purely by itself it must issue in a; pantheism where the only real is the Idee, and where all its factors and moments, inlcluding spirit and nature, are real only at different stages or phases of the Idee, but vanish as imperfect ways of looking at things, or as illusions, when we reach the Idee. And thus the Idee itself vanishes, as an organic system, as a unity which lives through its distinc- tions, and becomes a dead identity, in no way distinguishable from the substance of Spinoza. Logic set up as absolute method reveals its self-contradiction by destroying itself. In a purely logical method the distinctions, the process must disappear in the final unity, the product. Only a living actual Fact can preserve within its unity that organic system of differences in virtue of which it lives and moves and has 1 The inability to go from the ' be-cause' of reason to the ' cause' of fact, from logic to reality, when logic is not taken simply as one movemyent. within reality, is clearly set fortlh in the closing chapters of Mr. Bradley's Principles of Logic.</page><page sequence="21">PSYCHOLOGY AS PHILOSOPHIC METHOD. 173 its being. It is with this fact, conscious experience in its entirety, that psychology as method begins. It thus brings to clear light of day the presupposition implicit in every philosophy, and thereby affords logic, as well as the philo- sophy of nature, its basis, ideal and surety. If we have determinied the nature of reality, by a process whose con- tent equals its form, we can show the mea:ning, worth and limits of any one moment of this reality. The conclusion of the whole matter is that a " being like man," since self-conscious, is an individualised-universe, and hence that his nature is the proper material of philosophy, and in its wholeness the only material. Psychology is the science of this nature, and no dualism in it, or in ways of regarding it, is tenable. Whatever the dualism may be, it is only relative, and one which occurs within, not without, psychological experience. Psychology, as the complete sys- tematic account of man, at the same tiime shows the value and meaning, and affords the condition, of the special sciences, the philosophy of nature and of logic. Or, in a word, if the reality of spirit be the presupposition, the prius and the goal, the condition and the end of all reality, the science of spirit must occupy a corresponding position with relation to all science. Surely then, as the Editor of this Journal formerly urged, " the method of psychological approach is not philosophically valueless," and we have "ground for the belief that it has onlyto be more systematically followed out for the attaining of as great results as have been claimed for another way, while in this way the results are more likely to secure general acceptance," '-because, we may add, it simply expresses in a scientific way that which lies at the basis of all that has been otherwise secured. 1 "Psychology and Philosophy," MIND, Vol. viii. 20.</page></plain_text>
