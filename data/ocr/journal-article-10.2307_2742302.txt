Historically most important are the remains found in the mastaba of the Princess Khekeretnebti, daughter of the next to last 5th Dynasty king, Djedkare Izezi (around 2450 B.c.). With the proprietress of the tomb, a 30-35-year-old woman of extremely gracile build, was buried a 16-year-old girl, whose dispersed and largely fragmented skeleton had to be reconstructed. Study focused on the comparison of these two individuals in terms of anthro- pometric, descriptive, and epigenetic features and will be complemented by the determination of their blood groups. The aim is to test the hypothesis of a relationship between them that cannot be demonstrated from written documents. In the vicinity of this mastaba and in the superposed layers derived from the destruction of the pyramid temple of Queen Khentkaus were found a number of secondary burials later than the 5th Dynasty. Bodies were mostly laid in simple wooden anthropomorphic coffins, the head usually oriented towards the west, and furnished only with amulets and articles of simple personal adornment. They were not embalmed, but usually wrapped. These were apparently people from some nearby agricultural village. According to the coffins, most of these burials-30 males, 22 females, and 12 children-dated from the Late period (26th-30th Dynasties) to the early Ptolemaic period. Another 3 males and 3 females were dated late New Kingdom (12th-beginning of 11th century B.C.), and 2 males belonged to the Roman period (30 B.C.-A.D. 395). Special attention was given to the detection of pathology. Among other things, several cases of small polytopic osteolytic lesions causing perforations of the skull vault were found. Their etiology is not uniform; in one case, however, they were probably the result of a malignant tumour, either the metastasis of a carcinoma or a myeloma multiplex.</page></plain_text>
