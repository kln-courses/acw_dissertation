<plain_text><page sequence="1">Gestaltheiligkeit im bauerlichen Arbeitsmythos. By Leopold Schmidt. Wien (Osterreich. Mus. fur Volkskunde), I952. 214 PP. viii, 240, 7 maps In his latest book Professor Schmidt rightly maintains that the study of the spiritual background of material folk culture remains the chief concern of folklorists. In his investigatioln of harvest implements, among which sickle and scythe occupy the first rank, he proves that their deep spiritual meaning is of far greater signi- ficance than the aspects of material and form, origin and diffusion. Never before has the close relationship between material culture, folk art and magico-religious objects been so clearly demonstrated. The author uses the term Gestaltheiligkeit to denote 'traditional form plus traditional meaning' as a kind of depth charge. The peasants' unanimous and yet unconscious acknowledgment of the sacredness inherent in their harvest implements constitutes the 'bauerliche Arbeitsmythos.' It took Professor Schmidt 20 years to collect the relevant beliefs and customs in many parts of the Eurasian continent. The arche- types of the mythological beings associated with the sickle, whose variety is astounding, go back to the Neolithic period and are so dim that we can no longer recognize to what extent the people differentiated between the implement itself and its anthropomorphic form. The whole subject seems to me so original and important that I prefer to forego questioning some very minor points and put instead four Celtic references on the maps, which have been left almost blank in regard to the British Isles. There were and still are places where the cutting of hay is taboo: on visiting the large stone circle at Ballynoe (Co. Down) in the summer of i95i I noticed that the high grass between the two inner rings had been left standing. There is an Irish parallel to the North German and Finnish Wetzzauber (p. 53): at Sanihain-tide the Fianna used to grind their arms on a stone (Silva Gadelica, II, 209); the strange markings on the well-known stone at Kilnasaggart may have been caused by such a magical observance. In 'The Adventures of the Sons of Eochaid' (Revue Celtique, Vol. XXIV, p. I97) we read about an old loathsome hag guarding a well: 'The green branch of an oak in bearing would be severed by the sickle of green teeth that lay in her head and reached to her ears . . .' Sickles are mentioned among the implements of Celtic saints (Wh. Stokes, Lives of Saints from the Book of Lismore, p. 253; M. Stokes, Three Months in the Forests of France, p. xxxiii). Evidence of greater bearing may be forthcoming from Celtic literature; Professor Schmidt's book should greatly help to elucidate their meaning. E. ETTLINGER</page></plain_text>
