<plain_text><page sequence="1">Archaeoastronomical Implica tions of an Agricultural Almanac in the Dresden Codex Victoria R. Bricker, Harvey M. Bricker Ernst Förstemann (1906:159) pointed out that pages 38 b to 41 b of the Dresden Codex contain a double tzolkin almanac of 520 days, divided into five periods of 104 days each (Figure 1). The eleven pictures on those pages are clearly concerned with agri cultural subjects like rainfall, drought, and planting; in most cases, the captions over the pictures also seem to refer to events of interest to the Maya farmer. At the same time, however, the first and the last captions in the almanac contain eclipse glyphs. The appearance of eclipse glyphs in an almanac 520 days in length implies that it is also concerned with the correspondence bet ween a double tzolkin and a triple eclipse half-year, as is the major eclipse table on pages 51 to 58 in the same Codex (Teeple 1931:88-91; FI. Bricker and V. Bricker 1983). The first caption must refer to the beginning of the 520-day al manac, and the last must refer to the end. The intermedíate dates follow intervais of 104, 208, 312, and 416 days. None of these intervais corresponds to the length of the eclipse half-year, 173.31 days (Teeple 1931:90), or one of its multiples (e. g., 346.62 days). This means that the captions with eclipse glyphs must refer to the extremes of the almanac, to its first and last tzolkin dates. Table 1 shows in abbreviated form the structure of the tzolkin dates and intervais mentioned or implied by the agricultural al manac on pages 38 b to 41 b. The tzolkin date that immediately precedes the first caption is 6 Cauac. That caption contains two eclipse glyphs, the first representing a darkening of the Sun and the second a darkening of the Moon (Figure 1). Our work with a similar pair of eclipse glyphs in the Mars table on pages 43 b to 45 b of the same Codex suggests that the 6 Cauac date falls bet ween dates of solar and lunar eclipses (V. Bricker and H. Bricker n. d.). The tzolkin date that introduces the last caption in the al manac is 13 Ben (Table 1). That caption refers to a single eclipse, a darkening of the Sun (Figure 1), which may occur on the 13 Ben date itself or in the six-day interval that links it to the 6 Cauac date at the beginning of the next run of the almanac. The question is where within the time period relevant to ancient Maya civilization do such conditions prevail? It can be shown quite simply that they do not occur later in Maya history than A. D. 919. Eclipse dates cluster in three restricted zones of a double tzolkin during any given period of several decades (Teeple 1931:90; H. Bricker and V. Bricker 1983); in our previous work on the eclipse table in the same Codex we referred to these zones as "eclipse danger windows" (H. Bricker and V. Bricker 1983). Table 2 defines the limits of these "windows" for the 33-year per iod covered by the version of the eclipse table actually shown on pages 51 to 58, the so-called 12 Lamat Original, which began in A. D. 755. The 6 Cauac date that precedes the first caption in the agricultural almanac falls near the end of the first window (Table 2). The eclipse table can be used five times (c. 165 years) without correction, but by the beginning of the sixth multiple the as tronomical nodes have moved backward through the tzolkin by slightly more than eight days, and the table must be corrected (see H. Bricker and V. Bricker 1983, for a discussion of nodal re cession and the correction necessary to counteract it). By that time, the 6 Cauac date falls about two days after the window closes, and it can no longer be used for predicting eclipses, not only in the eclipse table itself, but also in the 520-day agricultural almanac (Table 2). Thus the beginning date of the sixth multiple of the eclipse table, 2 August A.D. 919, can serve as a terminus 29</page><page sequence="2">ante quem for the agricultural almanac.

The eighth-century date, A. D. AAugust 775, was the day before a new moon (Goldstine 1973), and the Moon would almost cer tainly have been invisible. On the previous day, however, which should have been the last day of visibility for the waning lunar crescent, the Moon and Venus, which was then a "morning star", were in conjunction (Table 4), rising almost together shortly be fore 4:00 A. M., approximately 90 minutes before sunrise (Kluepfel 1980). The tenth-century date, 28 July 906, was a new moon date, and the most probable day of last lunar visibility was two days earlier. On 26 July 906, the Moon and Venus were again very close together, in or near conjunction (Table 4), rising about 3:00 A. M., approximately two and one-half hours before sunrise.

The times shown for each date are local times for the Yucatán peninsula (20° 30 ' north latitude, 88° 30 west longitude) approximately 15 minutes after Moon-rise or Venus rise (whichever occurred later) on the day in question. Ecliptic longi tudes and latitudes, tabulated in decimal degrees, and other astronomical data were obtained from Kluepfel (1980). The quantity "zlA" is the absolute différence, in degrees, between the longitudes of Venus and the Moon. The quantity "d", also in degrees, is the Over all résultant angle between Venus and the Moon, taking into account différences in both longitude and latitude. This value, calculated by the algorithm given by Duffett-Smith (1981:52), would seem to be a more relevant measure of how close two celestial bodies appear to be to a ter restrial observer than just the différence in longitudes.

El almanaque en la parte central de las páginas 38-41 del Códice Dresden se ocupa en primer lugar con temas agrarios y relacionados con las estaciones del año, pero también menciona eclipses solares y lunares. A pesar de que no están vinculados datos Long Count con este almanaque es posible datarlo entre 775 y 906 d.C. gracias a que está relacionado con las tablas de eclipses en las páginas 51-58 del Códice Dresden. Esta datación es comprobada independiente mente por datos climatológicos y arqueoastronómicos.
