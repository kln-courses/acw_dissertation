McNamara B IRDERS interested in American history are fond of noting that Columbus knew he was near land when he saw a flock of migrating birds.1 Thus Europe's discovery of the New World is synchronous with the discovery of New World birds. This fact is not just a starting point for the present article; Columbus's use of the birds is symptomatic of the next three hundred years of American "ornithological" writing. He was not interested in determining the species; these birds were but a chance sign in a more important venture, and birds as signs were incorporated into the discourse of discovery. Indeed, few American "ornithologists" writing before the publication of Mark Catesby's Natural History of Carolina, Florida, and the Bahama Islands ( 73 I-I743)2 described birds in a discourse we would consider ornithological. The principal function of such early tracts as Thomas Hariot's A Briefe and True Report of the New Found Land in Virginia (i 590), William Wood's New Englands Prospect (i634), and Thomas Morton's New English Canaan (i637) was to promote immigration by advertising a colony's opportuni- ties. These tracts listed birds primarily to assure potential settlers of an adequate food supply; hence these field reporters classified birds as a natural "commodity." Southern reporters such as John Lawson in A New Voyage to Carolina (I 709) and William Byrd in Natural History of Virginia, or the Newly Discovered Eden (I737) claimed to write natural history, and they treated the land and its inhabitants in much greater depth than the earlier writers had.3 Lawson signed himself "Surveyor General" of Caro- Mr. McNamara is a doctoral candidate in American literature at the University of California, Irvine.

Yet their texts were still advertisements. New Voyage is dedicated to the colony's Lords Proprietors; Eden describes property Byrd owned. Both authors were more likely to note if a bird is edible than to describe it. So despite the development of a natural historical discourse in the interim, these "ornithologies" written a century apart share a common commercial purpose. The nature reporter at his desk, raptor-quill pen in hand, is an appropriate emblem of the early American "ornithologist's" relation to his subject. In this article the word ornithology frequently appears in quotation marks because, strictly speaking, there was no ornithology before John Ray saw into print The Ornithology of Francis Willughby (Latin, i676; English, i678). By noting the size, color of irides, bill shape, foot type, and "characteristic marks" for each species discussed, Ray's work significantly redefined what statements about birds were valid as natural history, thereby greatly influencing the development of ornithological discourse. In fact, his title is the first recorded use of "ornithology" in English, a point that escaped Elsa Guerdrum Allen, who titled her monumental history of protoscientific writing about birds from Aristotle to Alexander Wilson "The History of American Ornithology before Audubon."4 We should further be mindful that, before Catesby's visits, "American ornithology" was centered in England. Colonists writing before Catesby did not make sustained attempts at transcribing what they saw into written discourse, thus not adding to our knowledge of birds, nor did they follow Ornithol- ogy's method. For most reporters it was sufficient to apply a British name to an American bird as a conventional schema and perhaps correct it with a qualifier such as "lacking horseshoe on breast."5 This article cannot approximate the breadth that makes Allen the Experimental Description of That Part of America Called New England ...

The focus here, rather than being strictly ornithological, is on examining the discourses of English colonists and visitors to understand how they established their authority on birds. Many of these discourses had to be removed from ornithology's fields of presence-"all statements formu- lated elsewhere and taken up in [ornithology], acknowledged to be truthful, involving exact description, well-founded reasoning, or necessary presupposition"-and concomitance-statements concerning "different domains of objects" and discourses "active" in ornithology as "analogical confirmation," general principles and premises, models "transferred to other contents," or "higher authority"6-as it became a branch of natural history. Thus this article takes seriously the intentions of the early field reporters and the contexts in which they wrote, rather than extracting what predicts current ornithology and discarding the rest as eccentric. We have already glimpsed the use of birds as "landmarks" and their treatment as food. They were also used to mark class distinctions, as Wood did when describing the ruby-throated hummingbird as being "for some Queene's rich cage more fit" in the poem that prefaces his "ornithology." (A century later, Catesby would connote the bird's richness by using gold dust to represent its iridescence.)7 Such transformations of natural objects into valued possessions were common during the age of exploration, when novelties carried home for patrons were often publicly displayed. In reviewing texts claiming some measure of descriptively "ornithological" validity, we find appeals to the authority of folklore and see birds used as moral emblems, theological exempla, and aesthetic objects. These dis- courses of commodification were relatively unimportant for Allen, a mid-twentieth-century research assistant at Cornell University's center for ornithological studies who wanted to tell "the story of [ornithology's] early growth and development."8 But discourses of commodification were more important than any nascent discourse of "ornithology" for the colonial reporters. These marginal discourses did not disappear from ornithological dis- course once Linnaeus's General System of Nature produced its standard grammar. Aesthetics and theology inform writings about birds by such highly regarded naturalists as William Bartram, whose Travels through North &amp; South Carolina, Georgia, East &amp; West Florida was published in 6Michel Foucault, The Archaeology of Knowledge, trans. A. M. Sheridan Smith (New York, I972), 57-58. We might pause to consider how the concept of speciation is secured by the philosophy of science and to remark the concept's great importance today in environmental science and law. 7Wood, New Englands Prospect, 26, line 3, of the poem about New World birds that prefaces his prose description of them.

This article is not another review of colonial ornithology but an inquiry into the positive value of those "non-ornitho- logical" discourses brushed aside in our desire to tell a (hi)story. I. THE DEVELOPMENT OF EUROPEAN SCIENCE: FROM ENCYCLOPEDIC TO NATURAL ORDER We will be better equipped to evaluate the colonial tracts if we first sketch the progress of the European paradigm of natural history in the first half of the seventeenth century. We find a shift in the domain of English-language books on birds by contrasting the structure of Ray's Ornithology with Edward Topsell's The Fowles of Heauen (I 6 I 2 or i 6 I 3)) 11 Although general characteristics of bill and foot had been used in classification as early as Aristotle's History of Animals, medieval encyclo- pedists shifted their focus from observation and description to the readily available resources of allegory, fable, and etymology. Since the distinction between the natural thing and its uses as a sign had not emerged, material we classify as literary uses of birds was then as much a part of a bird itself as its wings' shape and its nesting behavior. Fowles proceeds alphabetically, not by any rough taxonomy, reflecting an encyclopedist's interest in the ordering of texts rather than the orders of birds. Each entry contains a list of names for the bird in foreign languages, references to the bird by philosophers, historians, and poets from classical antiquity through the sixteenth century, and the bird's mythological and allegorical functions, including its heraldic significance. Topsell's dominant principle being inclusivity, to speak authoritatively he needed only to present a broad array of testimony already in the archive. The entry for cranes includes two pages of "proofs" that the Greek alphabet "was collected out of the flight of Cranes." Discussing the generation of the barnacle goose, which some authorities said arose from wood (barnacles were said to be the goose's "larval" stage) and others from 9 Carolus Linnaeus [Carl von Linn6], A General System of Nature, trans.

My differentiation between Ray and Topsell generally follows Foucault's reading of natural history in the I7th century (Order of Things, I 29).</page><page sequence="5">2I4 WILLIAM AND MARY QUARTERLY copulation among barnacle geese, Topsell deferred to a series of author- ities as diverse as Aristotle and "an Irishe man called Octauian," who speak through the text's "I." He rejected none of the theories but concluded that "Barnicles engendred out of wood begotten by the humour of the Sea, by a naturall instinct fall to breede by copulation who were begotten by putrefaction and operation of the Sea, euen as the first created fowles which God made out of the waters."'12 Topsell added little by way of observation, and many of the text's illustrations are fanciful ones taken from earlier works. Ray's Ornithology disregards all literaria and seeks only "to describe each Species, and to reduce all to their proper Classes or Genera." Ray and Willughby "wholly omitted what [they] find in other Authors concerning Homonymous and Synonymous words, or the divers names of Birds, Hiero- glyphs, Emblems, Morals, Fables, Presages, or ought else appertaining to Divinity, Ethics, Grammar, or any sort of Humane learning: And present [the reader] only with what properly relates to Natural History." Common names alone were retained, as signifiers applied to the living creature. In securing the book's authority, Ray portrayed the capable master who relinquishes this role only to others of secure "ornithological" reputation.13 The relevance of Ray's biographical notice of his young partner may not be apparent: Willughby was a promising naturalist who died of pleurisy in I672, and he was a member of the Royal Society of London at its chartering. But we must recall that Ornithology asks to be judged by its careful selection and organization of data, not its inclusive- ness; the preface's ethical argument implies that the authors would not use their authority to deceive readers. The narratives of the conditions under which birds were first observed lend further credence to the data presented. Ornithology's first book comprises a general discussion of avian anatomy that includes birds' generation, ages, "properties and accidents," breeding grounds, divisions, and some of Willughby's own questions, mostly unanswered. The taxonomy of individual species is subdivided by land and waterfowl; within each group the major divisions are usually based on bill or foot shape. Willughby's chief virtues, in Ray's estimation, are observa- tional: the number of species he saw and dissected, and particularly his recording of species' "Characteristic Marks," which put an end to "unnec- essary multiplications of Species [due to] the Readers often mistaking several descriptions of the same Animal . . . for so many descriptions of several Animals."'14 Willughby's own descriptions of size, color, and 12Topsell, Fowles, I87, 48-52. 13 Ray and Willughby, Ornithology, A4r, A2v. 14Ibid., A3r. Discussing description by predetermined variables versus "com- plete" description, Ray wrote that on birds lacking a "Characteristic Mark" Willughby was often "too scrupulous and particular, partly because Nature does not in all Individuals ... observe exactly the same spots or strokes, partly because it is very difficult to word descriptions of this sort as to render them intelligible." Today's photographic field guides are also often too particular and thus less useful than guides whose sketches highlight certain of a bird's features.</page><page sequence="6">FEATHERED SCRIBE 215 characteristics are quite good, although descriptions borrowed from other authors are of uneven quality and his trust in their reliability was misplaced on occasion. The preface consigns Topsell's anthropocentrism to ornithology's field of memory. Nevertheless, Ornithology does revert to a human perspective when discussing the taste or medicinal properties of certain birds, dividing diurnal birds of prey by "generousness" and "bravery," and offering a six-page description of nightingales that includes instructions for catching, keeping, and training them.'5 Likewise, the essay on fowling was useful to anyone wishing to capture and study birds, but its true intent comes out in Ray's concentration on catching birds that are edible or are nuisances to fishermen and farmers. These additions may be justified on two counts. The first is structural: essays on fowling and falconry and the list of fabulous birds are appendixes, thus outside ornithology proper. The second reason derives from Ray's theocentric conception of nature; ornithology studies what is proper to birds, which were created by God with useful functions: "since the omniscient Creator could not but know all the Uses, to which [natural objects] might and would be employed by Man, to them that acknowledge the Being of a Deity, it is little less than a Demonstration, that they were created intentionally, I do not say only, for those uses."16 The danger of pursuing such discourses was that they could reduce the bird from an object in itself to a commodity in a system of use and exchange value. That both John Clayton and Cotton Mather, the only Americans before Catesby to demonstrate interest in the natural history of birds, were ministers reflects natural history's continued ties to theocentric explana- tions during the period under study. But where Topsell, himself a clergyman, justified his project by asserting that, "in a word, the scriptures cannot be rightlie vnderstood without the knowledge, and historie of fowles," Mather positioned himself as both a Doctor of Divinity and a Fellow of the Royal Society on the title page of The Christian Philosopher. Topsell supported his assertion of birds' theological significance with five pages of scriptural citations and glosses by Church Fathers-for example, the Levitical prohibition against eating eagles because their habit of "soaringe aboue the cloudes signifieth God." He noted that birds, "Volucres celi," are one of three things God designated as "of heauen." He attacked at great length the "idlenes and impiety" of Greeks and Romans by surveying their use of birds in auguries and citing the failures and inconsistencies of their readings. For his part, Mather presented a summary of natural philosophical writing, "with Religious Improvements" according to his subtitle, in order to show "that Philosophy is no Enemy, but a mighty and wondrous Incentive to Religion."'17 15Ibid., 220-226. l6John Ray, The Wisdom of God Manifested in the Works of the Creation ... (London, I 69 I), I I 3. 17Topsell, Fowles, 9, I7, i6; Cotton Mather, The Christian Philosopher: A Collection of the Best Discoveries in Nature, with Religious Improvements (London, I72I), I.</page><page sequence="7">2I6 WILLIAM AND MARY QUARTERLY Consistent with the Puritan "disposition to see God's hand in events, a perception of the identity of natural order and divine decree, an ability to read the analogy between spiritual law and natural laws, and a faith in the fundamental perfection of the plan of creation,"'18 Mather was concerned with restoring God to the center of natural history studies. Philosopher's chapter on birds added a new twist to a familiar theological argument: birds' ignorance of the import of their actions substitutes for man's ignorance of the world's workings in making necessary the appeal to divine providence to explain the harmony of the natural world. Mather made the point often: "The untaught Artist gives a motion to his wings, than which the acutest Mathematician could not give one more agreeable. Blind Philosopher, canst thou see no G 0 D in all of this?"; "This Instinct of the Ostrich particularly, who leaveth her Eggs in the Earth, and warmeth them in the Dust, is ascribed unto G 0 D, who supplies the want of Concern in the Parent-Animal another way."19 Ray never denied a role to God, as his preface, his Wisdom of God Manifested in the Works of the Creation (i 69i), and his calling to the ministry should make clear.20 However, the line drawn between religion and natural history when Ornithology describes birds without reference to God's design was anathema to Mather. The source of Mather's strategy and many of his examples can be found in Ray's Wisdom, a work that began as a series of commonplaces delivered in the chapel of Trinity College, Cambridge, and proved so popular that it received its eighth edition in I7I7. The echoes are heard most clearly if one reads one of the two-volume editions of Wisdom, which first appeared in i692. Mather added little to Ray; in fact, Mather's acknowledged debts to scholars other than Ray seem a learned man's attempt to conceal overdependence on one authority. The immediately striking difference between these authors is that while Mather frequently injected God into his text, Ray kept his promise in the first edition "to Trace the Footsteps of [God's] Wisdom in the Composition, Order, Harmony, and Uses" of the universe, thereby proving God's existence "by arguments drawn from the Light of Nature, and Works of Creation."'21 Although Mather's chapter on birds is encyclopedic, it is composed with a principle of selectivity that recognized only accepted natural historical and philosophical discourse in most of its matter. Mather did offer one original observation, a description of the nests of passenger pigeons (a bird he studied at some length) that substitutes for an example of Ray's. He explained how pigeons, with skill humans could hardly match, 18 Perry Miller, The New England Mind: The Seventeenth Century (New York, I939), 2i6. 19 Mather, Philosopher, i83, I 93. 20 Ray's refusal, on the ground of his beliefs, to subscribe to the Act of Unification in i662 cost him his positions in the church and at Oxford.

And the R E A S 0 N for this Architecture of their Nests! 'Tis this; their Bodies are much hotter than those of other Birds; and their Eggs would be perfectly addled by the Heat of their Bodies in the Incubation, if the Nests were not so built, that the cool Air might come at them to temper it.22 To his credit, Mather resisted wholeheartedly assenting to fantastic stories, even when they redounded to the glory of God. Thus he prefaced his relation of a raven who counsels quarrelsome neighbors to "Look into the third of the Colossians, and the sixteenth" with the confession that he "know[s] not what well to make of [it]." Mather did turn to outright allegory in his chapter-ending request, "Teach me, 0 Stork, how gratefully to treat my Parent; shew me, 0 Dove, how lovingly to treat my Consort," but this is virtually an appendix. By beginning with natural historical matter and postponing the greater part of his allegories and commentaries on the usefulness of birds to the chapter's end-including the fact that the edible birds are the most prolific and travel in flocks that are "more visible and audible to us"23-Mather rather closely approximated his essentially religious discourse to the norm of natural history. John Clayton's letter to the Royal Society (i693) includes a list of fifty-seven species he had seen in Virginia, but the anatomical investiga- tions and speculations reported in that list are the letter's particular source of merit. While discussing the mockingbird, Clayton described the "ears" of birds, explaining how they are different from man's ears and similar to those of moles. He then described the larger passage between the "two skulls" in the more pleasing songbirds, hypothesizing that an analogous structure in humans causes some to be good singers. His letter also refers to his earlier demonstration before the society that three nerves in the bills of flat-billed birds serve to distinguish food from other matter surrounding it during those birds' underwater foraging.24 The Royal Society, Clayton's audience, sanctioned the "correct" orni- thological discourse in England and collected specimens such as those Clayton used in his demonstration. Besides encouraging scientific curios- ity, the society helped invalidate such curious science as that reported by 22 Mather, Philosopher, i88. On Mather and pigeons see Frederic T. Lewis, "The Passenger Pigeon as Observed by the Rev. Cotton Mather," Auk, LXI (I944), 587-592, and "Cotton Mather's Manuscript References to the Passenger Pigeon," ibid., LXII (I945), 306-307. 23 Mather, Philosopher, I97, i96.

In his New-Englands Rarities Discovered (1 672) Josselyn recorded the "Pilhan- naw," a bird "four times as big as a Goshawk ... having two or three purple Feathers in her head ... [and a] Head as big as a Childs of a year old." He also told of swifts that drop one of their young down the chimney "by way of Gratitude" to their hosts before their fall migration. His "surgical" uses of birds include drinking goose fat to cure the bloody flux and laying vulture skin on one's stomach to cure stomach colds. What made Josselyn unique was not that he related such material-Ornithology occasionally did the same-but that such reports constitute the full extent of his record. In I 7 5 7 the British naturalist and Royal Society fellow Peter Collinson sent John Bartram, William's father, a copy of Rarities with a letter reading, "as thou lovest curiosities and novelties, I herewith send thee a book will let thee see the notions of a virtuoso about one hundred years agone."25 Yet the collector of this period was as likely to be a wealthy patron of some voyage eager to possess a "rarity" as a sign of his success as he was to be a natural historian, since the Royal Society was composed not just of natural historians and theologians but also of colonial administrators and merchants "tied to an imperial network of communication and flow of authority" whose idea of useful knowledge made the society "more like a mercantile company than a humanist university."26 In short, some mem- bers were as likely to be interested in advertisements as in observations. Only as natural history evolved into an autonomous discourse and its practitioners came to see the world through the Linnaean schema did collection and display become focused. One of the greatest collections belonged to the Philadelphian Charles Willson Peale. In I784 he began acquiring for his "world in miniature," a museum intended to display specimens of all life forms in taxonomic order with their habitats sketched on backdrops. By the turn of the century, Peale had assembled 765 species of birds alone with a view to educating the public rather than offering amusement as earlier collections had intended.27 II.

Before the advent of a centralized authority, his predeces- sor, the early travel writer, had appealed to his own ethical integrity to defend himself against the proverb that travelers may lie by authority- particularly when writing advertisements. Thomas Hariot wrote A Briefe and True Report of the New Found Land in Virginia as a member of Sir Walter Ralegh's I585 expedition. His stated goal was to answer the "slaunderous and shamefull speeches" of citified men put off because they had found in the colonies neither "daintie food, nor any soft beds of downe or fethers." He did so by showing how one's "dealing [in colonization] if it proceede, may returne . .. profit and gaine; bee it either by inhabitting &amp; planting or otherwise in furthering thereof."28 Under the plan of advertisement, birds were treated as "commodities," but within this narrow scope there are significant differences between Hariot's attempt to bring back something of the New World's strangeness and the reports of his successors in the next half century. Hariot's list of birds is brief and unremarkable; turkeys, doves, par- tridges, cranes, herons, swans, and geese are all "commodities victuall." But his purported record of local names for eighty-six birds, including eight "strange" waterfowl and fourteen landfowl that he had "taken [and] eaten," far exceeds any list produced in New England during the next hundred years, despite later authors' longer observation periods. John White, named governor of the Roanoke colony in I 587, produced drawings to complement the list.29 His surviving work is adequate to quite good and avoids the ambiguities of verbal pictures; the sketches extant in a copyist's hand range from stylized to inaccurate. Hariot's and White's attention to songbirds is largely absent from the New England reports. In using native American names for the birds, the two resisted fully appropriating them into English culture either by conflating Old World and New World species or by placing them in familiar genera and using an adjective to mark specific difference. Either strategy would have aided linguistic colonization of the New World by making the land seem familiar. Francis Higginson's argument for the superiority of New England's air, soil, and provisions to those of England in New-Englands Plantation (i630) and William Wood's in New Englands Prospect are typical of their genre in praising the land's curative powers: both men claimed to have been continuously ill in England. After beginning with the eagle (the "king of birds" was a traditional opener), Higginson mentioned only "excellent" hawks and edible species-turkeys, partridges, pigeons, ducks, and geese. 28 Hariot, Briefe and True Report, 5, 6. 29 Ibid., 20.

[it] could fly but a little way," and winter waterfowl so plentiful that for "a great part of winter the Planters haue eaten nothing but roastmeat of diuers Fowles which they haue killed."30 What was here good press would become an eighteenth-century natural history debate over the relative sizes of American and European animals. Wood was the first reporter to dwell on passerines, whose songs yield "honest pleasure" but no profit. His "ornithology" is divided into twenty- eight lines of end-stopped heroic couplets that note the pleasures of swallow flight and lark and thrush songs, and four and a half pages of descriptive prose that take "profit" quite literally by giving prices for nine edible species (from three pence for a teal to four shillings-"and he is well worth it"-for a male turkey).31 Wood's poetic epithets are uneven. At their least satisfying, the "ominous Screech-Owle" and "ever constant" doves appropriate folkloric and poetic conventions, while the "Silver Swan" sacrifices accurate description to alliteration. His birds are often anthropomorphized or allegorized, his greatest success being his blending of Puritan values and field observation in the "Humilitee" (willet), whose striking pattern remains hidden except when the bird spreads its wings and rises heavenward.32 New Englands Prospect contains little description, no measurements or systematic description of birds' characteristic markings, and no discernible ordering of the species into families. Eagles are differentiated by head and tail color and relative size; turkeys are "blacke"; for brant, Canada, and snow geese, only the Canada goose's facial coloring is described. An impressive exception is Wood's description of the ruby-throated hum- mingbird as "one of the wonders of the Countrey, being no bigger than a Hornet, yet [having] all the dimensions of a Bird, as bill, and wings, with quills, spider-like legges, small clawes: For colour, she is as glorious as the Raine-bow; as she flies, she makes a little humming noise like a Humble-bee."33 Although he underestimated its size, Wood observed criteria of "birdness"-wings, feet, and bill-that would become major points of reference in ornithological description. The hummingbird's iridescence is a useful field mark. Wood did not invoke English species just to describe American birds; he recalled them to record species he did not find in the colonies. In the middle of his description he wrote: "There 30 Higginson, New-Englands Plantation ... (London, i630), C2r-v. In I79I Bartram called the eagle "an execrable tyrant [who] supports his assumed dignity and grandeur by rapine and violence, extorting unreasonable tribute and subsidy from all the feathered nations" (Harper, ed., Travels of Bartram, 5). Its food- stealing behavior being familiar to earlier writers, the changed political climate and his friend Benjamin Franklin's choice of the wild turkey for national bird are likely causes of Bartram's revisionism. 31 Wood, New Englands Prospect, 2 6, 3 I, 2 9. 32 Ibid., 27, lines I 3, I, 2 I, 27.

Cuckoos, jays, and sparrows were present, but not the species a British observer would have first associated with the names. Thomas Morton wrote his New English Canaan after being banished from New England by the Massachusetts Bay government. Morton's animosity toward the Puritans and his admiration of the Indians' relation with nature inform Canaan's structure; reading carefully, we can see it guiding parts of his "ornithology." To gain distance from the once-sickly Higginson and Wood, pious men who told of other men's skill with rifles, Morton made himself the eminently capable main character of his book, telling of the plump, tasty fowl he killed (enough to feed his dogs on geese), and turkeys that he "salute[d]" with his gun "with such a courtesie, as [made] them take a turne in the Cooke roome." An expert hunter, his differentiation among brants, snow geese, and Canada geese is sufficient to allow field identification. He was the first to distinguish blue- and green-winged teal and claimed to have shot snipe expressly "to see what difference [he] could finde betweene them and those of [his] native Country." Morton did call ruffed grouse, greater prairie chickens, and bobwhites "pheisants," "partridges," and "quailes," respectively, invoking the most similar species among British birds, but not without appropriate reservations. He made clear that he named "pheisants" as they were ''commonly called," noting that the grouse are "rough footed; and have stareing fethers about the head and neck," unlike European pheasants. With the prairie chicken he noted the lack of a partridge's "horseshoe" on its breast and the lack of distinctive facial coloring. He did not describe the bobwhite, but rightly called it a quail.35 Morton further distinguished himself from earlier reporters by evalu- ating falcons. While falconry was closely allied to "ornithological" dis- course, access to the vocabulary of falconry was restricted by requisite knowledge and social standing. Since before Ray there was no properly ornithological discourse of falcons, and to discuss their attributes was the domain of falconry, Wood would say only: "To speake much of Hawkes, were to trespasse upon my owne judgement, and bring upon my selfe a deserved censure, for abusing the Faulconers termes." (Ray's Ornithology would provide an appendix on falconry "Collected out of several Authors" and accompanied by a glossary of terms from falconry.) Hariot alluded enigmatically to "Faulcons, &amp; Marlin haukes, which although . . . they bee not vsed for meate, yet for other causes [he] thought good to mention," and Higginson, as we have seen, mentioned "excellent" hawks. William Strachey's A History of Travell into Virginia Britannia points to the class aspect of falconry, a sport limited to men who could afford to purchase, train, and keep the birds. Strachey wrote that he brought back to England "a Falcon and a Tassell, the one sent by Sir Tho: Dale to his Highnes the 35Ibid. , 29. 35Morton, New English Canaan, 68, 69, 67-68, 70.</page><page sequence="13">222 WILLIAM AND MARY QUARTERLY Prince, and the other was presented to the Earle of Salsbury"; he made no mention of taking a hawk for himself. Morton, who advertised himself on Canaan's title page as a gentleman of Clifford's Inn, turned this prohibi- tion to his advantage by declaring that "these of all other fether fowles I must not omitt, to speake of, nor neede I to make any Apology for my selfe, concerning any trespasse, that I am like to make upon my judge- ment, concerning the nature of them, having bin bred in so genious a way, that I had the common use of them in England."36 Morton's securing of his authority answers a deeper rhetorical need as well: placing himself firmly within English culture, he furthered his project of making Puritan New England appear as an alien culture. Morton was less successful in attempts to describe two small birds. It is not true that American larks (presumably horned larks) are "like [the] Larkes of England in all respects: sauing that they doe not use to sing at all"; horned larks look different and do sing, although not as well as Wood claimed. Morton is in all respects inferior to Wood on the hummingbird, and his theory that it "out of question lives upon the Bee, which hee eateth and catcheth amongst Flowers," since its bill prevents feeding on flowers, is a misguided attempt to fill out the natural history of the hummingbird through deductions from personal observation. The erratic Josselyn later observed that "they feed upon Honey, which they suck out of Blossoms and Flowers with their long Needle-like Bills."37 III. ORNITHOLOGY IN THE SOUTH BEFORE CATESBY: ONE TEXT IN THREE VOLUMES Although early southern observers like Hariot, Strachey, David Ingram in his Relation (I589), and John Smith in A Map of Virginia (i6I2) mentioned birds,38 their lists lack the descriptive and discursive richness of New England lists. Only with the appearance of Ornithology did 36 Wood, New Englands Prospect, 27; Ray and Willughby, Ornithology, 397-399; Hariot, Briefe and True Report, 20; Strachey, The Historie of Travell into Virginia Britannia (i6I2), ed.

Nehemiah Grew urged his readers to examine hummingbirds' digestive organs to learn whether they siphon nectar or feed on small insects (Letter, Royal Soc., Phil. Trans., XVII [i693], 8i 5). Grew had written "The Description of the American Tomineius, or Humming Bird," ibid., 760-76 I. 38John Smith, A Map of Virginia ... (i6I2), in Philip L. Barbour, ed., The Complete Works of CaptainJohn Smith (I580-i63I) in Three Volumes (Chapel Hill, N.C., i986), I, I55-I56. The list reappeared, substantially unchanged, in Smith's The Generall Historie of Virginia . . . (i624), ibid., II, i i i. Smith's Map was used by Strachey, who had read it in manuscript and "incorporated about four-fifths of [it]" into The Historie of Travell (ibid.. I, I24), but Strachey's ornithological descriptions are frequently more detailed than Smith's.

[London, I602], I2).</page><page sequence="14">FEATHERED SCRIBE 223 southern reporters begin cataloging their colonies' avifauna-in the newly emergent discourse of natural history. In I705 Robert Beverley published History and Present State of Virginia, essentially a political history and characterization of colonial life. Beverley had no interest in describing birds, only in naming them. Listing the fowl of the shores, swamps, and savannahs, he included "Cranes, Curlews, Herons, Snipes, Woodcocks, Saurers, Ox-eyes, Plover, Larks, and many other good Birds for the Table that they have not yet found a Name for." He was equally disinclined to go beyond the familiar and edible in his list of upland birds-"Wild Turkeys, of an incridible Bigness, Pheasants, Partridges, Pigeons, and an Infinity of small Birds"-and waterfowl: "such a Multitude of Swans, Geese, Brants, Sheldrakes, Ducks of several Sorts . . . that the Plenty of them is incredible." These truncated lists assure the reader of Virginia's bounty and suggest a variety beyond conception, while saving the author research. Thomas Glover's "An Account of Virginia" (i676) divides its more extensive report on birds; it lists waterfowl when discussing rivers and bays, and landbirds when discussing the soil. Glover described a sea monster, but his birds are unspectacular. Most are simply commodities; the mockingbird, "redbird," and hummingbird, three American species unlike anything in Europe, are described sufficiently for one to know why the bird is so named.39 John Lawson wrote A New Voyage to Carolina for that colony's Lords Proprietors, whom he served as surveyor general, a position that gave him professional authority but raises questions about his objectivity. His most important contribution to field description in the colonies was his notation of habitat, nest building, or feeding behavior-categories made ornitho- logical by Ray-for well over two dozen species. Lawson's best description is of wood ducks "having a red Circle about their Eyes, . . . a Top-knot reaching from the Crown of their Heads, almost to the middle of their Backs, and abundance of Feathers of pretty Shades and Colours." Its occurrence in his journal instead of in his section on birds may reflect Lawson's conception of ornithological description's limits; when he de- scribed the duck in the list, he merely wrote that "she [in fact, the male] has a great Topping, is pied, and very beautiful. She builds her Nest in a Wood-pecker's Hole." Allen's praise of Lawson's "specific differentiation regarding nearly every species he mentioned" is hyperbolic.40 The second wood duck description exceeds many others in specificity; for example, "Whistlers[:] These are called Whistlers, from the whistling Noise they make, as they fly," is hardly adequate when there is also a "whistling duck." Lawson's tendency to see American birds in terms of English ones let him make superficial observations and declare far too many birds the same as in England. He reports bullfinches, nightingales, and hedge sparrows in his 39Beverley, The History and Present State of Virginia. ed. Louis B. Wright (Chapel Hill, N.C., I947), I53; Thomas Glover, "An Account of Virginia," Royal Soc., Phil. Trans., XI (i676), 626, 63I. 40 Lawson, Voyage to Carolina, 44, I48.

While Allen thinks he meant "without question the purple finch, the mockingbird and some one of our sparrows," her assertion does not account for his separate listing of mockingbirds or his curious nominalism in designating the hedge sparrow: "Hedge-Sparrows are here, though few Hedges"; apparently any sparrow that landed in a hedge was so named.41 Lawson's claim that American birds are more beautiful than British birds may be advertisement, but his preoccupation with aesthetic valua- tion reveals him as a man with a refined eye and a fascination with nature not always present in earlier reporters. While aesthetic value is anthropo- centric, it is a step closer to studying the bird in itself than Wood's anthropomorphic moralizing-itself closer to the observation of avifauna than Topsell's compilation of names and quotations. Lawson also revealed his sensibility when reporting that he never tamed mockingbirds since they "build yearly in [his] Fruit-Trees," so that he always had "their Company . .. as to the singing Part." Crossing ornithological discourse with folk tales, Lawson told stories of eagles stealing pigs, with the result that people who heard pigs crying overhead but did not see the bird "have thought there were Flying Sows and Pigs in that Country," and of great horned owls sounding so human that travelers were led astray by their calls. In addition, he told of folk using birds without killing them: "The Planters put Gourds on standing Poles, on purpose for [martins] to build in, because they are a very Warlike Bird, and beat the Crows from the Plantations. "42 Much of Lawson's work on southern birds reappeared twice in I737 without credit-in William Byrd's Eden and in John Brickell's The Natural History of North-Carolina. The case against Brickell as a plagiarist dates at least to i826;43 the case against Byrd is made with similar ease by reading his and Lawson's "ornithologies" side by side. At seventy-one species, Eden's list is of adequate size, but its descriptions, often abridgments of Lawson's, are uninspired. Byrd's only sustained effort at description is in his paragraph on woodpeckers, but of the four species described, only the ivory-billed and red-headed may be distinguished. Eden being a promo- tional tract for land he owned, Byrd was understandably concerned with "useful" birds, primarily edible ones, some of whose prices he listed in a later section. If a species was inedible, as cormorants and tropicbirds are, he might praise its feathers; the pelican's stomach, we are told, serves well as a tobacco pouch.44 Byrd's discussion of domestication was his only 41 Lawson, Voyage to Carolina, I49, I48, I44; Allen, "Ornithology before Audubon," 462. 42Lawson, Voyage to Carolina, I43, I37, I45, I44-I45. 43John Brickell, The Natural History of North-Carolina ...

Although of question- able ornithological value, it is a natural next step in the development of birds' commodity status and may reflect the degree to which Virginia was becoming gentrified. The birds Byrd listed as domesticated include cardinals, mockingbirds, "ground mockingbirds" (thrashers?), humming- birds, and parrots, all of which were kept for enjoyment. The mockingbird may even prefer its cage, Byrd suggested, contra Lawson, since it "loves the human being very much ... [and] out of the love which it has for him, [can] scarcely leave him at all."45 While Josselyn's story of the swifts was one of many fanciful tales he reported in earnest, one cannot be sure that Byrd was not being ironic, given his penchant for irony in the Dividing Line histories. Like Byrd, Brickell used Lawson "as a suggestive guide" to "enlarge" upon.46 Brickell ranged beyond Lawson and beyond recognized ornitho- logical discourse to include a list of ills that birds or their bodily parts could be used to cure. His primary contribution to ornithological dis- course was to reintroduce folk medicine (and tall tales) on a grander scale than Josselyn had done sixty-five years earlier. Along with such remedies as woodpecker tongue for toothaches and goshawk dung in wine to "cause Conception," he passed on such nonmedical folklore as eagles breeding nearly all year, cuckoos wintering in hollow trees, "where their Feathers come off," and cardinals becoming "Milk-white, and so stupid that they scarce know how to feed themselves" after prolonged time in cages.47 Given that he wrote sixty years after Ray and Willughby, and twenty years before the landmark tenth edition of Linnaeus's System, Brickell's work amounts to a grand anachronism, a foregrounding of ornithology's field of memory. Thomas C. Parramore has argued that "there is little, if anything, ... to suggest that the author had attended an institution of higher learning," a claim based in part on the standing of the "authorities" Brickell cited. Lest we think Brickell's work had much effect, Allen noted that by his day "the intelligent were becoming less credulous."48 But to reject Brickell's ornithology because he was a quack rather than because he transgressed the boundaries of the "ornithological" is to recognize how poorly defined those boundaries were. The discourse of natural history authorized a detailed, more objective accounting of the New World than the advertisements had given, but colonial ornithology awaited a first-rate authority who would taxonomize his subject and pare from it all marginal concerns. IV. THE SPEAKING EYE: CATESBY, LINNAEUS, AND BEYOND The most important shift in the way New World nature reporters saw and wrote about birds was brought about by Mark Catesby, an Englishman 45Ibid., 65. 46 Allen, "Ornithology before Audubon," 463. 47Brickell, Natural History, I 89, I7 6, I7I, i 8o, I 9 I. 48 Parramore, "John Brickell," I I; Allen, "Ornithology before Audubon," 463.</page><page sequence="17">226 WILLIAM AND MARY QUARTERLY who first visited Virginia in I 7I2-I7i9 and later used the work he did there to attract patrons for his Natural History.49 Catesby knew Ray's Ornithology and used its variables-size, weight, color of the irides, bill shape, foot type, tail construction-as the basis of his descriptions; he added whatever he could learn about a bird's diet, range, nesting sites, and behavior. Thus the true beginning of American ornithology was accom- plished by a European who employed a system developed in England. Unlike the reporter/promoter, Catesby made very few references to the taste of a bird's meat or its potential for crop damage. Unlike Ray and Willughby, he made little use of sources other than personal observation and included no information on his sightings other than where they occurred. His descriptions supplemented the variables with only such characteristics as differentiated the species under study from similar species. Catesby, like Ray, doubted that exhaustive description could convey a clear image of its object, and he used this doubt as a method- ological justification for his drawings. Echoing Ray on "Characteristic Marks," he wrote: The Illuminating Natural History is so particularly Essential to the perfect understanding of it, that I may aver a clearer Idea may be conceiv'd from the Figures of Animals and Plants in their proper Colours, than from the most exact Description without them: Where- fore I have been less prolix in the Discription, judging it unnecessary to tire the Reader with every Feather, yet, I hope sufficient to distinguish them without Confussion.50 Catesby drew only the more colorful males unless the female's coloring could lead to identifying it as a separate species, which Catesby himself did on occasion. Where earlier reporters' untrained eyes and desire to make their observations available to English readers led them to see similarities, Catesby's training helped him see the differences among species within the totalizing structure of families and orders. This glance that "instantly distinguishes the essential," replacing the gaze that aimed at exhaustive description, is only half the task of the speaking eye.5' The value for each variable places the individual in a general frame, while "the character ... makes it possible both to indicate the individual and to situate it in a space of generalities that fit inside one another."52 Eventually, ornithological knowledge became represented in a system of nomenclature whose organization into genera, families, orders, and so forth does not necessar- ily correspond with the birds' most obvious features; no longer can one 49For biographical data see George Frederick Frick and Raymond Phineas Stearns, Mark Catesby: The Colonial Audubon (Urbana, Ill., i961). 50 Catesby, Natural History, I, xi-xii. 51 On the shift from the open field of the gaze to a glance that strikes at one point see Foucault, Birth of the Clinic, I20-I22. 52 Foucault, Order of Things, I 59.</page><page sequence="18">FEATHERED SCRIBE 227 conflate the two redbirds (cardinal and summer tanager) as early "orni- thologists" had often done, by treating as inessential everything but their redness. There was more at stake in Catesby's system of nomenclature than there had been for earlier authors, since he entered a discourse whose greatest claim was its ability to place life forms in ordered relation to each other. While he could have followed Hariot in using Indian names for New World species, to do so would have introduced a linguistic rupture into that discourse. It would have built into the descriptive system another discourse that lacked the academic claims of Latin, whose correct usage marked one as an initiate in the field. Explaining that "very few of the Birds ha[d] Names assign'd them in the Country, except some which had Indian Names," Catesby opted to call them "after European birds of the same Genus, with an additional Epithet to distinguish them,"53 recording English designations as well as Latin binomials. The name and the authority of the name thus returned as central concerns of the naturalist. Catesby might be a principal authority today had his Natural History not appeared a scant few decades before the tenth edition of Linnaeus's monu- mental System. Linnaeus's revisions of the metadescriptive level of orders and families cost Catesby his fame, but Catesby's observations remained useful for later systematizers. Linnaean descriptions of seventy-five American species, three Jamaican birds, and possibly two other North American species are based "in whole or in part" on information in Catesby's Natural History.54 The major stylistic difference between Linnaeus and Catesby is the former's greater terseness. All evidence of the human author is removed, as Linnaeus's description of the bald eagle demonstrates: Cere and legs yellow; legs somewhat downy; body brown; head and tail white. Inhabits woods of Europe and America; 3 feet 3 inches long; feeds on hogs, lamb, and fish, which it takes from other birds, nest large, eggs 2. Bill yellow; head, neck, irids and tail white; toes yellow; claws black; rest of body chocolate.55 After the codification of nomenclature and description, the reporter's task changed greatly. No longer was it necessary or, considering printing costs, even desirable to describe all the species of birds found in an area. That information was already in the archive; only the trained observer might add to or correct it. The reformulation of the discourse was not effected immediately, since many reporters' intentions did not change. Thus Alexander Hewatt's An Historical Account of the Rise and Progress of the Colonies of South Carolina and Georgia (I779) recalls Beverley's or Glover's lists in its brief enumeration and attention to a few American 53Catesby, Natural History, I, xii. 54Frick and Stearns, Catesby, 58-59.

John Filson's The Discovery, Settlement and Present State of Kentucke (I 784) lists (in addition to the expected geese and ducks, turkeys, quail, grouse, parakeets, owls, and ravens) the ivory-billed woodpecker, whose bill "is asserted . .. [to be] pure ivory, a circumstance very singular in the plumy tribe."56 The report is sheer folklore, but it must have enticed traders and others. Jonathan Carver's Three Years Travel throughout the Interior Parts of North-America (3d ed., I781) describes the land around present-day Minnesota, which Carver claimed would "prove a more abundant source of riches to [England] than either its East or West Indian settlements." A mapmaker by training, Carver became an adventurer in the hope of profiting from his discoveries. Unable to secure Royal Society patronage, he added folk tales, curiosities, and an active narrator to his brief journal notations in an attempt to recover his expenses through the popular press. The most memorable parts of his bird descriptions are, as in Filson, the incursions of folk beliefs like the osprey's "attractive power" to draw fish to the surface and the carefully described yet nonexistent Wakon (or "Spirit") bird that the Naudowessie Indians "caught" while Carver was among them.57 Other writers of the early republic who discussed birds were amateurs in the best sense. Although their interests lay in areas of natural history other than cataloging (particularly fossil remains and natural formations), they compiled their lists with care. Thomas Jefferson listed one hundred twenty-six different species in Notes on the State of Virginia (1785), ninety-three in a chart complete with local names and, if available, references to Linnaeus, Catesby, and Buffon's Histoire Naturelle des Oiseaux. In this compilation, Ray's lack of concern with the diverse names of birds gave way to a multilingual ornithological taxonomy. Gilbert Imlay listed one hundred twenty-seven species with Latin designations where available-mostly Linnaean-in A Topographical Description of the Western Territory of North America (I797); he also noted the common but improper use of "partridge" and "quail" for prairie chickens and bobwhites. Jeremy Belknap listed one hundred twenty birds with Latin designations in The History of New Hampshire (I792) and entered the then-current debate on the torpidity of swallows, writing that "evidences of [their] retiring to the water, or marshy ground, and there remaining torpid, during the winter, are so many" that the theory of their migration would soon be rejected.58 56 [Alexander Hewatt], An Historical Account of the Rise and Progress of the Colonies of South Carolina and Georgia, 2 vols.

After charting migrants, Barton listed resident birds, occasional residents, and occasional visitants, and added comments on each species that range from references to other naturalists to notes on nesting behavior and questions about the accuracy of a species' taxonomic placement. Frag- ments' apparatus reflects the major ornithological issues of the time; it includes Barton's speculations on the reasons migrating birds follow water, observations refuting the theory that fall migrants fly west of the Appalachians, notes on known winter ranges, and a report from "above thirty years ago" that some torpid swallows found in a "Gum-tree ... about four miles from the town of Lancaster" had been revived "upon the application of heat." To supplement data proving that migration is a "willed" act responsive to weather and vegetation patterns rather than to the calendar, Barton quoted Virgil's Georgics to demonstrate that the ancients used their knowledge of the significance of birds' migration in planning their agriculture. Like so many of the texts in this survey, Fragments closes with a return to the nonornithological subject of birds' usefulness to man, as Barton argues that flycatchers, bluebirds, woodpeck- ers, wrens, ibises, herons, and vultures are "so useful to man, by destroying insects and reptiles of various kinds, that they ought studiously to be preserved, if not by the LAWS, then by the GOOD-SENSE of the country."60 While Barton's Fragments accurately depicts how the discourse of ornithology was constituted at the time (and demonstrates the persistence of its field of memory), Francis Harper argued that it, like most of Barton's work, was cribbed from William Bartram.61 If so, Barton's citations of Territory of North America .. ., 3d ed. (London, I797), 280-282, 3I9; Jeremy Belknap, The History of New Hampshire. . ., 3 vols. (Boston, I792), III, i65-I74. The theory of torpidity originated in ancient Greece. Linnaeus thought swifts could become torpid (General System, trans. Turton, I, 632). Catesby called the theory "absurd" and argued that migration is a response to changes in temperature and food supply ("Of Birds of Passage," Royal Soc., Phil. Trans., XLIV rI746], 435-444). Collinson suggested that believers in the theory capture birds at migration time, keep them under water for two weeks, and see what happened ("Migration of Swallows," ibid., LI rI760], 460). 59 Allen, "Ornithology before Audubon," 534-53 5. 60 Benjamin Smith Barton, Fragments of the Natural History of Pennsylvania ... (Philadelphia, I 799), I 7, xi,2 I-24. Barton's note on torpidity is doubly unreliable: it is hearsay, and the event might be explained as a freak caused by a sudden severe weather change. 61 "The Fragments is little more than a compilation by a closet naturalist, who managed over a period of years to wheedle out of Bartram, or to cull from his Travels, the essential part of the 'ornithological information it presents" (Harper, ed., Travels of Bartram, xxx).</page><page sequence="21">230 WILLIAM AND MARY QUARTERLY George Edwards, Thomas Pennant, and other British ornithologists show him, like Mather, to be concealing too great a debt to a single source. Bartram's major work, the Travels, describes a trip undertaken in I 773. Its ornithological core is a list of two hundred fifteen species subdivided by order and family and noted as summer or year-round residents of Pennsylvania, migrants through Pennsylvania, summer or year-round residents of the Carolinas and Florida, migrants through the Carolinas and Florida, or winter residents in Pennsylvania. The list is supplemented with an introduction and notes.62 But Bartram's Travels is different in genre from Barton's Fragments. Bartram went far beyond Catesby in restoring the author to the travelogue. Where "Linnaean terse observation" de- scribes the Fragments, Bartram combined a naturalist's precise eye with a journalist's sensibility to create a work that appeals equally to the general reader and the natural historian. Although a competent artist, in Travels Bartram relied on words to convey images of the birds he saw.63 He did not confine himself to taking measurements and did not always specify such variables as foot type and color of irides even with the limpkin, a bird he neither recognized nor knew "which species of European birds to join it with." But his lengthy description of its color, markings, bill and tail shape, and leg size makes the limpkin immediately recognizable to a birder, an infrequent occur- rence in earlier narratives besides Catesby's. An excerpt from Bartram's description of the limpkin's bill is indicative of his method: the bill or beak is five or six inches in length, arched or bent gradually downwards. ... [I]t is large or thick near the base, compressed on each side, and flatted at top and beneath, which makes it appear four square for more than [an] inch, where the nostrils are placed, from whence to their tips, both mandibles are round, gradually lessening or tapering to their extremities.64 Bartram's careful descriptions distinguish him from Timothy Dwight, whose Travels in New-England and New-York was begun in I796 and published posthumously in i82i-i822.

Dwight's description of the kingbird is a brief panegyric to an overmatched bird that drives off its "enemy" by virtue of its "severe discipline." Evaluating the songs of catbirds, mock- ingbirds, and brown thrushes, he treated them as instruments of human pleasure. Dwight's subsequent account of the song of "a small brown bird" metaphorizes his concern for human settlement by portraying a harmoni- ous community: "When two of them unite, the voice of one is regularly elevated a third greater above that of the other. When there are three, the third raises his voice afifth above the first, and of course a third less above the second."66 Once his little brown bird has been incorporated into a musical discourse, Dwight takes the privilege of naming it "the Songster of the Woods." That Bartram's Travels was also shaped by its contemporary aesthetic is shown by comparing it with his "Report to Dr. Uohn] Fothergill," the British naturalist for whom Bartram collected on that expedition. The "Report" comprises the field notes of a naturalist, recorded in a voice usually objective and free of moralizing about nature. The published account in Travels took liberties with the "Report," embellishing, combin- ing separate events for dramatic effect, and filtering observations through an active and organizing authorial consciousness in order to render a world suggestive of the religious sublime.67 In his empathic leap to a crane's perspective, Bartram wrote a prose version of a prospect poem: "bound on interesting discoveries, [they] wheel round and double the promontory, in the silvery regions of the clouded skies, where, far from the scope of eye, they carefully observe the verdant meadows on the borders of the East Lake."68 But if his mind is overactive here, making him less a knowing eye than a projecting "I," his rapture is immediately balanced by an accurate description of cranes' ascent and flight formation. While Dwight and Bartram both textualized nature to support philosophic and aesthetic visions, Bartram's text is distinguished by his superior talent as a naturalist. In his persona Bartram recalls Morton and Byrd, who were active participants in the scenes they described. But where the Council member, Byrd, like the educator, Dwight, was concerned with settlement, Bartram, like the poets of sensibility, was a lone traveler.

Solomon, I, 34-3 5. 67 Bartram's aesthetic revisions are amply demonstrated in Thomas Vance Barnett, "William Bartram and the Age of Sensibility" (Ph.D. diss., Georgia State University, i982). Barnett underplays Bartram as a naturalist, missing a chance to examine the effects of two competing sets of generic demands on Travels. Of three incidents Barnett chooses from Travels to mark Bartram's competence in the wilds (p. 44), two are not in the "Report" and the third is much changed from the original. 68 Harper, ed., Travels of Bartram, 93.</page><page sequence="23">232 WILLIAM AND MARY QUARTERLY in attitude more apparent than in the contrast between Byrd's cranes and Bartram's wood storks. Byrd was impressed that cranes "travel generally in Flocks, and when they roost they place Sentinels upon some of the highest Trees, which constantly stand upon one leg to keep themselves waking." A footnote elaborates on this martial scene: "if any of the Scouts should be careless at their Posts &amp; suffer any Surprise they are torn to pieces without Mercy." Bartram, on the other hand, saw a "solitary wood-pelican, dejectedly perched upon [a tree's] utmost elevated spire ... like an ancient venerable sage." Later in Travels Bartram gave a carefully detailed description of the bird's bill, legs, head, coloring, and diet, again noting its solitariness and describing it as seeming "extremely grave, sorrowful and melancholy."69 Bartram's setting is much the same as Byrd's, but military metaphors give way to the quasi-religious aura of the wandering wise bird. We get an even better insight into how much Bartram's observation was affected by his aesthetic if we compare the stork in Travels with the stork in the Florida section of "Report." In the latter he wrote simply and without anthropomorphizing: "It seems to be Catesby's Wood-Pelican. [T]hey are a remarkably scarce &amp; a very solitary bird[.] I never saw but 3 or four and these in the most lonesome unfrequented places." While referring explicitly to Catesby, Bartram ignored Catesby's note that in autumn wood storks in Carolina "sit in great numbers on tall Cypress and other trees" and are "stupid bird[s]."70 Travels has one dark moment in which Bartram, as a synecdoche for humankind, is an intruder on, rather than an observer of, the intercon- nected system of nature. As he came upon a hawk that had attacked a coach-whip snake that "wreathed himself several times around the hawk's body, who had but one of his wings at liberty," they "mutually agreed to separate themselves . . . considering [him] as their common enemy." In the animals' retreat from Bartram's presence, the scene emblematizes man's difference from the rest of creation. Bartram's discursive mastery of the scene reinforces his distance; only he can give meaning to the incident in which the three creatures participated. Rather than dwelling on the implications of how he assumes the animals viewed him, Bartram restored nature to its unfallen state with a description of the snake, which "with respect to venom . . . [is] innocent as a worm." Shortly after this passage, however, man's specific difference from other animals reemerges: Bartram carefully describes a savannah crane that hunters in his party had killed for 69 William K.

Wood storks are gregarious; Bartram furthered his narrative by overlooking Catesby's notes. Having no firsthand knowledge of the bird, Alexander Wilson accepted Bartram's account for his American Ornithology; or, The Natural History of the Birds of the United States (Edinburgh, i83I [orig. publ. Philadelphia, i8o8- I8I4]), III, 54.</page><page sequence="24">FEATHERED SCRIBE 233 dinner.7' This tension between scientific distance and immediate physical need aptly frames the question of man's relation to nature. Bartram thus shares much with Ray: both authors presented significant ornithological data, while their discursive passages attempted to situate ornithology within larger contexts-Christianity for Ray, philosophical issues in late eighteenth-century thought for Bartram. The first two hundred years of American ornithological discourse developed less smoothly than Allen's model of continuous progress indicates. Catesby's importance in this history is beyond doubt. He was the most important ornithologist to discuss American birds in the period and the first person working in the colonies deserving the title ornithol- ogist. His Natural History caused a break in American "ornithological" discourse. No earlier colonial reporter, not even Lawson, had a direct effect on Catesby, who was trained to see and write according to Ray and Willughby's paradigm. Where earlier reporters looked for similarities, Catesby articulated differences. The final proof of his eye is his writing, which removed virtually all anthropocentric traces from the study of birds as objects in themselves. In the wake of Catesby and Linnaeus, access to the discourse of ornithology became subject to greater restriction: to generate a list was to use names correctly. The proper use of nomenclature presupposes a user well trained in seeing ornithologically, rather than mythologically, theologically, or through any other discourse. He must be conversant with distinguishing characteristics and able to differentiate among families. The natural history of birds is more exacting than the speculation on fossils and other curiosities that attracted amateurs like Carver, Filson, and Jefferson. Barton's connecting of migration and food supply, and his taxonomic questions, indicate the scope of the naturalist's concerns. Were his authorship not questioned, Barton's terse notations would make him the successor to Catesby. Bartram is the only late-century candidate as Catesby's successor and the first American-born ornithologist. His investigation of migratory patterns is clearly substantial, yet he had little to add to Catesby by way of description and frequently referred Fothergill to The Natural History of Carolina in his "Report." Bartram's Travels is a hybrid text that brings to ornithology a scientifically unnecessary supplement. Seeking less to add information to the archive than to make information available to the uninitiated, the book shifted the paradigm of the travelogue, rather than of the ornithological discourse whose paradigms it so regularly subverted. Moving through a now anglicized wilderness in which Indians, though still an other, are no longer "savages," Bartram is beyond the period of explorers' fabulous tales. His American landscape is indebted to a British 7' Harper, ed., Travels of Bartram, I38, I39-I40. Dwight unintentionally juxtaposed the man of sensibility with the older reporter of food supply who masters nature when he wrote: "The wood duck is one of the most beautiful of all birds, and remarkably delicious. I have caught and tamed them without difficulty" (Travels, ed. Solomon, I, 35).</page><page sequence="25">234 WILLIAM AND MARY QUARTERLY poetic to which we may trace his repeated use of prospects and his musings on the interconnection of all nature. In such moments his careful glance relaxed into a poetic gaze scanning a moralized landscape. While his description and commentary are better than those of the other Americans, the generic demands of the sentimental travelogue caused him to produce details that create an entire scene for the reader, instead of paring away data not needed for technical notations. In another sense, the speculative excursions lost in teleologically determined readings like Allen's are what count in ornithology. The methods, lessons, and concerns of colonial reporters were reproduced in other discourses, just as those other discourses formed part of the reporters' fields of concomitance. The sorts of discursive incursions I have been highlighting gave meaning to what the eye knows by situating ornithology within the nexus of interests and contexts shared by writer and audience. This practice remains popular today; most of our naturalists and scientists who write for general audiences speculate in many nonsci- entific discourses, including politics, law, history, ethics, and literature. The shifts in how successive authors employed the discourses available to them mark shifts in how early American society saw itself and described its world. When birds entered Bartram's narrative not just as animals but also as aestheticized or moralized signs, the particular sign system was new with him, but the use of this strategy in "American ornithology" dates to Columbus.</page></plain_text>
