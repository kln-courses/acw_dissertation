      <p>In 1955 the poet Frank O’Hara argued that a painting by Cy Twombly—then on view at the artist’s first one-person show at the Stable Gallery in New York City—summoned the image of an irate bird, observing, “A bird seems to have passed through the impasto with cream-colored screams and bitter claw-marks.” Twombly himself stated that the now-lost painting resembled a “skinned turkey.”<sup>1</sup> While O’Hara often evoked the natural world in his poetry, his application of it to Twombly’s painting stood as the first time a critic noted the artist’s use of naturalist subjects. Since that time, Twombly’s oeuvre has typically been characterized within the theoretical framework of gestures and marks, semiotically parsed in such a way as to avoid any recognition of subject matter that might correspond to actual material objects or living organisms in the world. While these kinds of interpretations have their critical place, they have obscured other possible readings of the artist’s body of work. Such dogmatic approaches eliminate many of Twombly’s objects from the scholarly literature and reinforce critical positions that do not account for the importance of the full range of his projects not only to art but to the natural sciences—those disciplines through which artists have long investigated the material world.</p>
      <p>Focusing on Twombly’s <italic>Natural History Part I, Mushrooms</italic> (1974, fig. 1), a portfolio of ten lithographic and mixed-media prints, I seek not only to resuscitate works largely omitted from the scholarship on the artist but to explain how these works point directly to Twombly’s primary creative endeavor—exploring and articulating the relation between natural history and human history. Twombly’s visual and material inquiries in paint, print, and the natural world provide us with a model for bringing these spheres into greater consonance. As such, the prints that compose <italic>Natural History Part I, Mushrooms</italic> are a vital, if often overlooked, model for the intersection of art and science in later twentieth-century visual culture. They broaden traditional interpretations of Twombly’s work; help us view our interaction with the natural world, here through mushroom hunting, as a pretext for artistic production; and highlight the mutually constitutive connection between natural history and human history in contemporary art practice and everyday life.<fig id="fg1" position="float" fig-type="figure">

      <p>Illuminating my analysis of Twombly’s prints are the mycological activities of his artistic colleague John Cage. In 1972 the noted experimental composer created his own fungi-inspired print portfolio, in collaboration with the textile designer Lois Long and the famous botanist Alexander H. Smith. Entitled <italic>Mushroom Book</italic>, the print portfolio draws attention to broader art-nature dialogues also evident in <italic>Natural History Part I, Mushrooms</italic>; the centrality of hunting mushrooms to both Twombly’s and Cage’s fungi prints; and, finally, the relevance of natural history to us today.<sup>2</sup> Direct interaction with nature, as experienced through the unique qualities of mushroom hunting, serves as a specific pretext for both artists’ enterprises. In attending to natural history—that supposedly anachronistic practice of observing the natural world that preceded the positivist science of biology—Twombly and Cage prompt us to ask just what the modern era lost to an insistence on objective truth, primacy of vision, and disciplinary specialization. Viewing Cage’s <italic>Mushroom Book</italic> as a contemporaneous practice that contextualizes Twombly’s <italic>Natural History Part I, Mushrooms</italic>, I contend that Twombly encourages viewers to be naturalists themselves, uncovering their own contemporary natural history through the art objects before them.</p>
      <p>A consideration of Twombly’s artistic undertaking and its reception before the making of <italic>Natural History Part I, Mushrooms</italic> sheds light on his later mycological endeavors. In the art historical canon, Twombly is often grouped with such peers as Robert Rauschenberg and Jasper Johns. Twombly studied at the Art Students League in New York City and at Black Mountain College in North Carolina, where he worked under several important postwar abstract expressionists including Willem de Kooning, Franz Kline, and Robert Motherwell. While abstract expressionists created works that were increasingly devoid of recognizable subject matter, many artists who came later, Rauschenberg and Johns among them, reintroduced imagery based on the observable world. Rauschenberg’s so-called Combines include such specimens and objects as a taxidermic ram, a raptor, and a tire, alongside various artistic media. His two-dimensional works come off the wall, and his sculptures, precursors of installation art, incorporated subject matter from the everyday world. Art no longer spoke of the self-reflexive qualities of paint, as the critic Clement Greenberg had announced, but embraced life, or that area between art and life.</p>
      <p>Cage played a central role in identifying the importance of Rauschenberg’s stuff-of-life artistic program; the composer read the artist’s earlier <italic>White Paintings</italic> as collectors of shadow and dust, the landing pads of material accumulations.<sup>3</sup> Cage came to this interpretation when he, Rauschenberg, and Twombly were all in residence at Black Mountain College. During this period Cage conducted his first happening, an art performance driven by a degree of chance, which involved not only artists but theoreticians and architects like Buckminster Fuller, famous for his own mushroom, if an industrially produced one: the dome-shaped Dymaxion House.<sup>4</sup> After leaving the experimental school, Rauschenberg and Twombly traveled to North Africa together on an extended research trip.</p>
      <p>Twombly himself would go on to make objects that engaged both the materiality of art and the everyday. But in the 1950s and 1960s the artist largely built his reputation on heroically sized white paintings and equally massive gray ones such as those on view today at New York’s Museum of Modern Art and the Menil Collection in Houston. These paintings attest to Twombly’s focus on writing and gestural forms as art (fig. 2). For many viewers these paintings resemble blackboards, suggesting things beyond simple words and marks. Still, as with Rauschenberg’s subtle <italic>White Paintings</italic>, Twombly’s mimetic imagery has often proved elusive. In the 1970s the French literary critic Roland Barthes wrote two essays on Twombly and his oeuvre: “Non Multa Sed Multum” and “The Wisdom of Art.” Arguably the most famous and influential pieces on Twombly, these texts spurred the inquiry into the meaning of the artist’s words and scrawls. In his first essay, Barthes argued that Twombly performs the gesture of writing. In the second, he posited a lack of correspondence between the words in Twombly’s paintings and actual people, places, or things in our empirical world. The art historian Rosalind Krauss took up these texts in a 1994 <italic>Artforum</italic> article on the eve of the Twombly retrospective exhibition at the Museum of Modern Art. She viewed scholarly interpretations that Twombly’s art had “proclivities toward representation” as embodying “a massive misunderstanding.”<sup>5</sup> Instead, she proposed, his written and painted words refuse semiotic signification (e.g., a mushroom form never suggesting an actual fungus in the ground or even such metaphoric mushrooms as the clouds of atomic bombs).<fig id="fg2" position="float" fig-type="figure">

      <p>The critical focus on the gestural and nonobjective aspects in Twombly’s work stands in contrast to the presence of faithfully appropriated naturalist imagery in <italic>Natural History Part I, Mushrooms</italic>, in which the artist printed morphologically correct illustrations from a German fungi book. Art historians have devoted little study to Twombly’s natural history of mushrooms and the natural world as a subject of his concern. Yet pieces such as <italic>Apollo</italic> (1975, fig. 3), for example, are witness to this interest. By scrawling the words “laurel,” “swan,” “hawk,” “raven,” “snake,” “mouse,” and “grasshopper” in graphite, Twombly recalled O’Hara’s characterization of his early painting as an ornithological record—if not of the bird itself then of the animal’s actions.<fig id="fg3" position="float" fig-type="figure">

      <p>In view of the fact that <italic>Natural History Part I, Mushrooms</italic> dates from the same era as <italic>Apollo</italic>, one would be hard-pressed not to reckon with the representational elements in Twombly’s art and to consider the possibility that at least some of the words and images that the artist incorporated into his works, and specifically in his mushroom portfolio, require further analysis.<sup>6</sup> Twombly’s portfolio offers highly specific taxonomical references to mushrooms such as <italic>Lactarius vellereus, Clavaria botrytis, Lactarius torminosus, Phlegmacium praestans, Lactarius sanguifluus, Morchella conica, Lactarius piperatus, Clitocybe geotropa</italic>, and <italic>Craterellus cornucopioides</italic>, in the form of text below his appropriated images. This Latin nomenclature compels us to acknowledge the materiality of Twombly’s morels and other fungi and their association with natural history through their species-specific identification.<sup>7</sup> They stand as more than mere gestures and warrant greater scholarly examination, particularly with regard to the artist’s compelling choice of subject matter.</p>
      <p>In his project to explore the relation between nature and culture, natural history and human history, Twombly could have chosen many other objects or organisms besides mushrooms. Since he experienced mushrooming as a pleasant, and often useful, way to engage the natural world, the artist must have appreciated the range of their meanings and provocative connotations. Mushrooming may reference the exponential growth of a specific population or the sudden increase in size of an object or person, as when Alice in Wonderland ate her cake. In the decades after World War II, mushrooms were often equated with the clouds generated by atomic bombs, technologically sublime manifestations of death. And while for centuries fungi were feared for their ability to decompose matter, especially grains of rye, today we often view this rotting effect in a positive light, since fungi can create nourishing compost and stabilize toxic waste. Some savor mushrooms as culinary delicacies, while others refrain from consuming them for fear of poisoning. Many cultures, such as the Mazatec of northern Oaxaca in Mexico and the Sámi of northern Scandinavia, have looked to certain varieties as the embodiment of the divine, available to faithful followers through sacred practice. The Swedish naturalist Carolus Linnaeus, who invented binomial nomenclature and the associated system of classification outlined in his 1735 <italic>Systema Naturae</italic>, never gave mushrooms their own kingdom, instead ordering them with plants and ultimately within the subcategory of <italic>Cryptogamia</italic> because of their indistinguishable reproductive parts. Today, they have earned their own kingdom, but their classification still entails a great deal of slippage, since mushrooms exhibit characteristics of both plants and animals; in fact, we now know that mushrooms are biologically closer to animals than to plants. Considering the rich and varied associations of mushrooms, it is no wonder that Twombly found these organisms to be ideal subjects for his explorations of contemporary relationships between art and nature.</p>
      <p>To be sure, acknowledging that Twombly’s oeuvre pays close and sustained attention to the natural world requires one to reconcile this sharp focus with the artist’s concern for the world of culture. Words like “Virgil” and “Roma” appear scrawled across paintings and prints, indicating the artist’s preoccupation with human history, albeit one imagined and mythologized through the high culture of master artists, poet laureates, and lauded playwrights. Twombly’s entire body of work, I argue, presents the history of humankind as a companion to natural history, discursive fields that help us explore the material world and our cultural production and reproduction of it.</p>
      <p>The intersection of nature and culture in Twombly’s work finds its roots in many ancient texts, but it is the Enlightenment-era comparative anatomist Baron Georges Cuvier who perhaps offers the best model for understanding the artist’s mushroom prints. In his public address at the National Institute of Sciences and Arts in Paris on October 6, 1798, Cuvier outlined the need to write a natural history as much as a human one: <disp-quote>
            <p>Henceforth . . . it will be necessary for physicists <italic>[physiciens]</italic> to do for the history of nature what antiquarians do for the history of the techniques and customs of peoples; the former will have to go and search among the ruins of the globe for the remains of organisms that lived at its surface, just as the latter dig in the ruins of cities in order to unearth the monuments of the taste, the genius, and the customs of the men who lived there. These antiquities of nature, if they may be so termed, will provide the physical history of the globe with monuments as useful and as reliable as ordinary antiquities provide for the political and moral history of nations.<sup>8</sup>
            </p>
         </disp-quote> While Cuvier’s associations here lie with animals and his work on fossils, he made an important connection between the history of the natural world and that of the human world at a time when people were increasingly considering their own position vis-à-vis materiality. Cuvier’s articulation anticipates the importance of future explorations in the realms of both nature and culture, science and art. For Twombly, as for Cuvier, a joint investigation of human and aesthetic history, on the one hand, and natural history and practical science, on the other, provides the richest and most comprehensive study of the material world.</p>
      <p>In the summer of 1964 Twombly hiked in the Italian Alps, observing nature and hunting mushrooms. The foray served as a pretext for his series of lithographs in <italic>Natural History Part I, Mushrooms</italic>. In his prints the artist brought the mushrooms of the hunt to his paper, notating the curves of each cap, the turgidity of each stem, the smell of fecund earth, and the variety of their colors. He made lithographs after illustrations from mushroom books and incorporated other marks on top of and around the chosen fungi.<sup>9</sup> Some of these marks resemble mushrooms, while others look more like the squiggles and scrawled words for which the artist has become so famously known, as in his use of the words “Val Gardena,” which appear in the lower right of print No. VI (fig. 4). Twombly’s inclusion of naturalist imagery suggests a deliberate engagement with the world of observing, collecting, and classifying fungal organisms.<fig id="fg4" position="float" fig-type="figure">

      <p>Lithograph No. VI features two species originally illustrated in a German volume on mushrooms. The one at the far left is surely a morel, with the image of graph paper covering its stem and its Latin binomial, denying confirmation. At center, <italic>Craterellus cornucopioides</italic>, or a black trumpet, can be seen more completely; it partially lies over a two-dimensional design that may be read as the floor plan of an unidentified structure. Both fungi are further obscured by a translucent sheet collaged over them. To the right, the artist represented a second sheet of graph paper covered with zigzag markings. He drew other mushrooms loosely, abstracting them from their guidebook alter egos—one, at the upper left, proposes a simultaneously phallic and ballistic form. Then there are the smears, the spans of crisp white paper, and the lithographic addition of red-bordered sticker labels. Numbers litter the piece, some positioned with the regularity of a spreadsheet and others placed less deliberately. Lines and scrawls, scribbles and smudges—some printed and others drawn by Twombly with crayon on top of the finished work—alternate with the voids of empty space.</p>
      <p>This lithograph, which encourages one to wander through passages of revelation and occlusion, exemplifies the way the entire portfolio choreographs the viewer’s gaze. A fungi enthusiast once told Cage that a person should distinguish between “picking” and “hunting” when mushrooming, because “Hunting is different from the ‘orgy’ of an abundant pick.”<sup>10</sup> Mushrooms in a dense outcropping have no chance against a passionate fungi enthusiast. Contrary to this practice of picking en masse, Twombly embraced a degree of restraint, including only one, two, or three mushroom illustrations in each print. Instead of composing a field riddled with fungi, he inserted distance between each specimen, allowing the viewer the privilege of pondering the voids.</p>
      <p>Twombly’s mushrooms both adhere to and defy the history of mycological illustration. For instance, in his decisive publication on the Academy of the Linceans, a seventeenth-century Italian group that took upon itself the task of depicting the entire natural world, the art historian David Freedberg analyzed various representational strategies at work within the prints he studied.<sup>11</sup> Many of the artist-naturalists presented mushrooms in situ, delineating their changing appearance during the course of their life cycles. Some focused on interior details, providing cross sections and even microscopic views, while others emphasized morphology, or identification and classification via external forms. Field guides, at least since the late nineteenth century, have utilized a range of representational approaches, from fungi in the field to single examples on white grounds, in illustrated prints, line drawings, or photographs. Even given these different strategies for portraying mushrooms, from Renaissance images to modern field guides, naturalists sought a precision and clarity in their visual descriptions that Twombly, who regularly obscured his lithographic fungi, eschewed.<sup>12</sup>
      </p>
      <p>In his fungal foray, Twombly integrated collages and sketches, prints and diagrams, words and images. His lithographs address such diverse themes as repetition and process, artistic and biological reproduction, and life and death, always using the mushroom as his point of departure. Barthes argued that Twombly’s mushroom imagery “serves itself only as the thematic pretext for an accumulation . . . of other highly diverse images, colors, materials and drawings/writings/scribbles.”<sup>13</sup> I argue here, alternatively, that the mushrooms are thematically crucial to the artist’s prints. Indeed, a sustained engagement with the natural world is central to Twombly’s portfolio. His creative works construct and illuminate the various relationships we maintain between the materiality of culture and nature. Twombly viewed the study of nature as a prerequisite for making meaningful art objects: <disp-quote>
            <p>A lot of people have no knowledge of plants, trees, botany and things. I knew a poet who was totally ignorant about botany. And I said: you can’t be a poet without knowing any botany or plants and things like that; it’s impossible, that’s the first thing you should know.<sup>14</sup>
            </p>
         </disp-quote> In contrast to the unnamed poet of his critique, Twombly demanded an understanding of nature through study and experience. Employing taxonomy, he becomes as much a mushroomer as an artist in these prints, pursuing specimens like an enthusiastic naturalist in the field, his fungi operating as devices that direct us both to the art itself and to the practice of hunting mushrooms.</p>
      <p>Three characteristics of the hunt hold particular resonance for my interpretation of Twombly’s portfolio. First, when looking for fungi, a mushroomer spends a great deal of time surveying the ground. Second, mushroom hunting requires keen visual skills of identification to classify species and types, enabling one to distinguish among culinary, hallucinatory, and deadly varieties. Third, in engaging one’s senses to locate mushrooms, hunters open themselves up to encountering things and situations seemingly unrelated to the desired target. These characteristics of the hunt—ground survey, identification, and openness to non-fungi stimuli—work together in Twombly’s portfolio to convey the entwined processes of knowing nature and making art.</p>
      <p>When viewing these images individually, framed on a wall, an observer can easily forget that they were originally a series of lithographs from a “natural history” portfolio, stacked one on another in a manner similar to the prints in the double-elephant folio of the nineteenth-century ornithologist John James Audubon. Looking down on these large, unframed lithographs, our eyes move from figure to ground, from mushrooms to paper, from the accumulations to the voids. One simply cannot absorb all of the images in the portfolio at once, a quality Cage, for his part, embraced when he wrote to Alexander H. Smith that he fully intended people to “go hunting in my handwritten page.”<sup>15</sup> Indeed, this artistic endeavor mirrors the naturalist practice of mushrooming. As the famed mushroom hunter Paul Stamets has said, “I always stared at the ground and couldn’t look people in the eye. . . . That’s how I found fungi.”<sup>16</sup> The act of looking down requires that a hunter shift his or her gaze from one area of the ground to another at such close range that it can be difficult to take in the surrounding landscape all at once.</p>
      <p>The protagonist in John Lanchester’s novel <italic>The Debt to Pleasure</italic> (1996) provides a view of a mushroom hunt—albeit one of fiction—and the effects of looking down while doing so: <disp-quote>
            <p>Mushroom hunting is an agreeable mixture of the active and the contemplative: on the one hand is the fresh air, the promise of the early day, the walk, the sudden bends and stoops; on the other the intellectual activity of identification and of what military strategists . . . call “target acquisition.” . . . it involves an anxious concentration on one’s own performance, a determination to come back with one’s mushroom or on it, a silent free-floating mixture of boredom and anxiety of the sort familiar to hunters and psychoanalysts. So much looking down can induce a vertigo when one finally looks up and realizes where one is, who one is.<sup>17</sup>
            </p>
         </disp-quote> Barthes once connected the automatic character of Twombly’s gestures to the drawings the artist made in the dark at his hotel in Augusta, Georgia, where he stayed while on break from working as a code cracker for the U.S. Army. His military work undoubtedly helped the artist develop an eye for details, for distinguishing the relevant from the extraneous, a skill valuable to the intense focus needed in mushrooming. Drawing in the darkness of his room, in turn, spoke to the degree of chance that can interrupt endeavors of precision and order. In fact, Twombly declared himself “a little too vague” at deciphering codes to excel.<sup>18</sup>
      </p>
      <p>As in any mushroom hunt, this downward focus has to be suspended occasionally to engage a wider landscape, a visual oscillation that provides spaces of contemplation. Twombly was no doubt aware that looking down is distinguished from the time-honored traditions of the visual arts and architecture, where so often an equation is made between the upward gaze and the uplifted subject.<sup>19</sup> Gothic cathedrals and modern skyscrapers, statues set in niches and on pediments, the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel, as well as countless monumental history and landscape paintings all ask the viewer to stand back and tilt his or her head in order to gaze up or out. This upward gaze often connotes respect for that which rises above the base materiality of the world.</p>
      <p>In contrast, the downward gaze is often abjectly cast, as in looking down to avoid stepping on or in something undesirable, looking down in shame, or looking down on someone. There are times, however, when people look down in reverence, as when praying or paying one’s last respects to a person who has died. Twombly neatly combines the varied cultural constructs of looking down in print No. VII from the <italic>Natural History</italic> portfolio, in which viewers find themselves staring down on two women in a cemetery, who in turn look down upon a flower-laden coffin (fig. 5). In this visual thanatopsis, Twombly includes two of the most desired edible mushrooms, a black morel (<italic>Morchella conica</italic>), collaged at upper right, and a bloody milk cap (<italic>Lactarius sanguifluus</italic>), part of the lithographic matrix at left. The artist demonstrates that in surveying the earth in the hunt for mushrooms, we find ourselves as many times faced with death and decay as with the vibrancy of life. While fungi evoke growth and population explosion through often quick and abundant sporing, they also allude to death, with some species exhibiting parasitical properties. With a downward gaze fixed on the burial ground, the artistic ground of the lithographic paper itself, and the stone ground on which the print was created, Twombly indicates that <italic>we</italic>, bent over the mushroom portfolio observing this scene, are parasites of the artist’s imagery.<fig id="fg5" position="float" fig-type="figure">

      <p>The complexity of the mushroom, both biologically and culturally, likewise was not lost on Cage. The composer’s contemporaneous <italic>Mushroom Book</italic> provides a critical context for Twombly’s portfolio, one that further emphasizes both artists’ view that art requires a sustained engagement with nature. <italic>Mushroom Book</italic> contains ten prints, like Twombly’s, but Cage’s works are enclosed in a blue denim portfolio, which also includes the composer’s poem dedicated to mycology, mushroom hunting, and the culinary preparation of edible varieties.<sup>20</sup> As with Twombly, Cage’s mycological vision embraced three central features of the hunt—ground survey, identification, and openness to extra-fungal stimuli—to explore consonances between making nature and making art. In the portfolio’s final print (fig. 6), Cage refers the viewer to this first characteristic, the process of looking down, by superimposing his text over a map of a region of the Palisades Interstate, a mushrooming area the composer frequented. Here the ground is the print, the map and allusions to a road atlas, and the soil in which the mushrooms, represented in the interior of the folded sheet, are found.<fig id="fg6" position="float" fig-type="figure">

      <p>Unlike Twombly’s portfolio, which is composed of one-sided lithographs, each of Cage’s prints consists of a sheet folded in half vertically. The imagery on the folders’ exteriors includes excerpts from Cage’s mushroom poem often overlaid with his editing marks, arrows, scribbles, musical notes, and maps.<sup>21</sup> The complete poem is printed in legible type on a piece of translucent Japanese paper inside the folder for print X (fig. 7), where it is accompanied by Smith’s text with scientific information about each species, as well as culinary applications or other notable observations. Each of Smith’s field guide entries, if you will, lies on top of a particular mushroom illustrated by Long. Cage’s artistic strategy blurs Long’s otherwise richly chromatic illustrations and renders the reading of his own and Smith’s texts difficult. This calculated oscillation between concealment and disclosure can be seen throughout Cage’s portfolio, from the first print, where layers upon layers of writing defy linear narrative and logic (fig. 8), to the last. Cage argued that this compositional approach, also evidenced in Twombly’s portfolio, “Enables one if he wishes to hunt for a particular text in a given lithograph, just as he might hunt for a particular mushroom, late summer or fall, in a forest.”<sup>22</sup>

      <p>Cage understood well the proficient eye and nimble mind required to observe and classify mushrooms (fig. 9), and the dangers inherent in faulty observation; he “nearly died” when he mistook a poisonous hellebore for skunk cabbage: “The more you know them, the less sure you feel about identifying them. Each one is itself. Each mushroom is what it is—its own center. It’s useless to pretend to know mushrooms. They escape your erudition.”<sup>23</sup> His confessed misidentification of a hellebore speaks to the difficulties inherent in taxonomy and the precision it requires—from recognition and classification to proper culinary preparation. Hunting fungi demands that one know mushroom morphology and be able to situate one’s observations within standardized schemes of classification. For Cage, sharp sensory skills helped him separate edible varieties from hallucinatory and lethal ones (the latter two he deemed toxic), but even a great deal of taxonomical knowledge could not entirely prevent an error of the eyes.<fig id="fg9" position="float" fig-type="figure">

      <p>Twombly also explored the role of visual acuity in hunting fungi, and more widely in the fields of nature and art. This attention to visual identification helps to account for the artist’s preoccupation with mushroom hunting as a critical precursor to making art. Yet this precision, so central to the history of the naturalist project, slips away between “accumulations” that have been observed in Twombly’s prints.<sup>24</sup> Indeed, Twombly routinely drew frenetically on the print matrix and by hand over his exacting renditions of mushrooms. Print No. I, for instance, includes a lithographic red and white label that overlaps a collaged mushroom element with a Latin binomial, requiring one to consult a field guide to distinguish the particular morel (see fig. 13). The species of the mushroom to the left, <italic>Lactarius piperatus</italic>, can only be discerned at near-microscopic range by peering through the translucent printed label covering its name. In lithograph No. IV, Twombly obscured not only the name of the central mushroom, <italic>Clitocybe geotropa</italic>, located in the top register, with a collaged piece of translucent graph paper, but also its shape and color with the same graph paper, scribbles, and white lithographic ink in a shape resembling a sticker label (see frontispiece). Print No. X features red conté crayon furiously colored over a <italic>Phlegmacium praestans</italic>, while a black mark on top of it further conceals the mushroom’s form (fig. 10).<fig id="fg10" position="float" fig-type="figure">

      <p>With his almost nihilistic approach and seemingly antagonistic mark making defacing the mushroom imagery, Twombly challenges our claim to know the natural world through empirical means. This suspicion of the veracity of morphological renderings found in mycological illustration has a long history. As Freedberg argues, even the Linceans eventually began to see the limits of this “confidence in pictures”: <disp-quote>
            <p>Pictures can indeed show everything; but how to suppress the temptation to make something look like something else we know? How to avoid investing it with the marks of what we know best—a face, a living being? You may decide to suppress everything except . . . what you believe to be the determining elements of a class; but in so doing you deny one of the basic virtues of pictures: to show the distinctiveness of things, to show not just what is essential, but what is adventitious or unique. Would it ever be possible to avoid seeing what the eye wants to see, or to show how things are similar, when similarity is so clearly determined by experience, expedience, and desire?<sup>25</sup>
            </p>
         </disp-quote> Freedberg speaks to the illusions of objectivity and the way that a purportedly objective stance inevitably falls short of creating images that are exact, mimetic, truthful. Twombly’s desecration proposes a similar uneasiness with the claims for truth often made in the process of observing and recording species.<sup>26</sup>
      </p>
      <p>The French historian and philosopher Michel Foucault once asserted, “Natural history is nothing more than the nomination of the visible.”<sup>27</sup> If so, then what Twombly reckons with in <italic>Natural History Part I, Mushrooms</italic> are the limitations of taxonomical systems and their employment in naturalist illustrations. His portfolio highlights the instability of knowledge acquired through visual perception and the fallacy of equating words with images. Twombly’s gestural cancellations also remind us that there is nothing quite “natural” about “history” or “nature”; as anthropocentric, though certainly useful, terms—like Latin binomials—both are constructs of human culture.</p>
      <p>And yet, at the same moment that Twombly drew over his own naturalist-inspired mushrooms as if the days of natural history’s ability to convey accurate information were over, he also proposed a reanimation of the discipline in contemporary art. His mushrooms are not merely cancelled out but are often vitalized with screaming red swirls and bold gestures. Like so many visual artists before him, Twombly appropriated an existing arena of critical investigation and used it in his oeuvre as he pleased. He could take a specific species and turn it into a generalized mushroom form and then imbue it with atomic or phallic suggestiveness, for example. Without an empirical burden of proof, he could more easily explore what naturalists and scientists, with their imperative to arrive at objective truths, could not.</p>
      <p>Twombly’s mushrooms thus stand as hybrids of truth and fallacy, culture and nature, reproductions and metaphors of the caps that push their way through grasses and dead leaves. He scribbled on them with vibrant red crayons, both nullifying the veracity of their naturalistic representations in books and prints and emphasizing the actuality of their chromatically charged living bodies as found in the out-of-doors. For Twombly, words and images in our visual and conceptual fields have limits, but they also remain rich with possibility. Twombly proffers, much as the Linceans did, the highly provocative realm of pullulating mushrooms.<sup>28</sup> His portfolio presents colors and gestures that exude excited states, all in an effort to rouse our senses in anticipation of tasting woodsy mushrooms, feeling the soil between our fingers, and smelling the fecund earth from which they spore.</p>
      <p>Given the fallibility of visual perception, then, it is no surprise that for many mushroomers, seeing alone hardly determines accurate identification or a successful hunt. Rather, mushrooming requires and elicits additional proficiencies. Cage famously said, “Mushrooms are making sounds [as they produce spores] and we should be listening to them.”<sup>29</sup> The composer’s assertion might be taken quite literally, to mean the sound of mushrooms sporing, but also metaphorically. He recognized that mushrooms say something significant about the perceptive abilities of humans and argued that we need to pay careful attention to them. His remark proposes that vision alone provides an incomplete observational toolbox.</p>
      <p>As the art historian Suzanne Delehanty once wrote, “The arcadian wanderings of the mushroom hunt demand intuitive and exacting knowledge, reason and passion.”<sup>30</sup> Indeed, such multisensory experiences are pervasive in the naturalist practice of mushrooming. Confirming Delehanty’s notion of the marriage of “reason and passion” in hunting, Stamets has said, “The thing about mushrooms [is]: It’s not luck. There’s something else going on here. We’ve been guided. . . . All of our big finds, we have been led.”<sup>31</sup> Some might call this phenomenon extrasensory—superstition, karma, or grace. Likely referring to a combination of accumulated knowledge, keen visual observation, and a receptive mind and sense of perception that bring one to a find, Stamets concedes, “mushroom hunters . . . tend to burn an image of a mushroom on their retina. Then you end up overlaying that image on the landscape. The mushrooms seem <italic>to jump</italic> out at you.”<sup>32</sup> Certainly this jumping out is not a mere function of vision but a sense of how something looks, gained through visual and textual evidence, field observation, and a stored knowledge of morphology and habitat.</p>
      <p>Twombly’s and Cage’s prints demonstrate the way a mushroom hunt encourages participants to open themselves up to other natural features, art, or even life’s intangibles. Many descriptions of mushroom hunting emphasize the journey and the pleasure of looking along the way over the end result. Cage provided various accounts of his own hunting adventures in his poem to fungi printed in his <italic>Mushroom Book</italic>. In one foray, the composer recounts advice a fellow enthusiast gave him:<sup>33</sup>
      </p>

                  xlink:href="fg16.tiff"/>
      </p>
      <p>The goal for Cage was a general one, a kind of diversion on the ostensible road to hunting mushrooms. Yet by walking the same path in reverse, Cage noticed mushrooms he had not discerned on the first leg of his trip (likely a combination of chance and looking more closely on his return). One thing led to something else.</p>
      <p>This approach to openness can be found in an undated letter to Cage from the artist Alison Knowles, in which she describes her part in a Fluxus performance by the artist Nam June Paik: <disp-quote>
            <p>This one [piece] involved climbing to the top of the Eiffel tower, cutting a lock of my hair off . . . we watched it blow, and took the elevator down. Dick [Higgins, a Fluxus artist] suggested that we could find the hair in a grassy area where the wind might well have taken it. We had nothing better to do that fine afternoon and we three started stalking this lock of hair. We found instead a small one and a large bed of Pluteus cervinus [The Deer Mushroom]! . . . So, other things led us into mushrooms; And mushrooms, even in their absence, had us into other things.<sup>34</sup>
            </p>
         </disp-quote> Knowles’s performance of Paik’s piece illuminated a space between nature and culture, imperative and action, sporing and cogitating. In the process of cutting a lock of hair, dropping it from the top of the Eiffel Tower, and descending in an attempt to retrieve it, the artist embarked on a hunt that left her happening upon mushrooms. Thoughts and actions emerged between the loose structure of Paik’s Fluxus command and the artistic sequence of events. Knowles’s enactment of this command led to a fungal foray and then the mushrooms led to “other things.”</p>
      <p>As one of the foremost thinkers on indeterminacy, Cage, no doubt, would have appreciated this event of chance. He frequently arranged his own works, as in his third print from <italic>Mushroom Book</italic> (fig. 11), to precipitate the unexpected. Twombly’s portfolio likewise follows this open structure, leaving room for texts that have yet to be written and images that have yet to materialize; it revels in the spaces between and through his gestures and the mushrooms.<sup>35</sup> Mushrooms lead us from fields of art to fields of nature; from the downward gaze of nature study to the vertical field of cultural display; and from sight to other forms of sensory observation. As a work of visual art featuring a haptic three-dimensional portfolio format and one that continually conjures the sounds and scents of forests and fields through the art of hunting mushrooms, Twombly’s <italic>Natural History Part I, Mushrooms</italic> likewise provides a deeply multisensory experience.<fig id="fg11" position="float" fig-type="figure">

      <p>Yet Twombly, as a painter, sculptor, and printmaker, also presents us with a specific consideration of representation within natural history and traditional histories of art. I have provided some instances of Twombly’s place in the spectrum of historical and contemporary mycological illustration, from the seventeenth-century Linceans through modern field guides. In many ways, however, Twombly’s printed and collaged mushrooms, with their attention to morphology and accompanying Latin binomials, stand as generic motifs. In other words, Twombly could have taken his fungi from any number of mycological volumes. Other forms of appropriation, I contend, are far more specific. One cannot help but be struck by his repeated employment of the work of Leonardo da Vinci, the Renaissance artist-naturalist renowned for, among many other things, his extensive notebooks containing descriptions of inventions, anatomical features, and materials and organisms of the natural world.</p>
      <p>The art historian Claudia Swan points out that in notebook images such as <italic>The Layers of the Scalp Compared with an Onion</italic> (fig. 12), Leonardo marked “the visual organ” as “the starting point for thought.”<sup>36</sup> Building on Swan’s assertion, I would posit that Twombly’s appropriation of Leonardo’s <italic>Leda and the Swan</italic> in print No. I reinforces the modern artist’s interest in the role of vision in relation to the other senses (fig. 13), as well as his suspicion that vision does not afford us a full appreciation or understanding of our material world. Since Leonardo’s early sixteenth-century painting is no longer extant, Twombly used a copy of the Renaissance artist’s work attributed to Giuliano Bugiardini, who likewise exhibited an eye for naturalist illustration, with his careful delineation of particular species (fig. 14). In the foreground, strawberries and poppies, turtledoves and other birds are rendered with the heightened detail and flattened features typical of natural history images. By incorporating a reproduction of Leonardo’s painting into the first print of <italic>Natural History Part I, Mushrooms</italic>, Twombly connected his contemporary natural history to a historical one, and himself to one of the most lauded artists in the Western tradition.<fig id="fg12" position="float" fig-type="figure">

      <p>Twombly’s inclusion of <italic>Leda and the Swan</italic> in his print also serves as a playful and even mischievous example of the artist’s frequent expression of sensuous, erotic, and provocative forms in this portfolio and his wider body of work. In Leonardo’s original composition, the swan embraces the soft, creamy flesh of Leda’s hips, buttocks, and thigh with his elegant white-feathered wing. Leda, in turn, in both the painting and Twombly’s visual citation of it, places her left arm and hand on the swan’s back. Her right hand firmly grasps the lower reaches of the swan’s neck, ensuring the stability of the bird in the midst of ecstasy, as evidenced by the swan’s parted beak and longing eye.</p>
      <p>Twombly offers two cropped portions of the Renaissance painting situated among two different mushroom species and a pencil sketch that reiterates the form of the swan’s neck. From left to right, then, one reads a spongy white concave mushroom, then the first portion of the Renaissance artist’s painting, in which Leda embraces the swan with his engorged yet not quite fully erect neck. To the right of this image appears, in lithographic form, a loose sketch of the swan’s neck drawn on lined notebook paper. Twombly collaged a firm, upright morel to the right of this section, along with a last glimpse of the swan’s neck and his left wing in a second crop of the painting, completing his gallery of erotica in miniature.</p>
      <p>The combination of concave and rigid fruiting fungal bodies, Leda and the swan’s sensuous embrace, and Twombly’s allusion to the mythological bird’s swelling member through his appropriations and pencil sketch speaks to the very concept of mushrooming, or the magical Alice-in-Wonderland action of quickly growing large before one’s eyes. Fungi are most turgid at the height of harvest but become flaccid if left to absorb too much moisture. As cooks know, adding too much liquid while sautéing will almost always produce a limp specimen. Twombly here plays on the effect that moisture can have on mushrooms, equating turgidity and phallic engorgement. This concupiscent force permeates Twombly’s print portfolio and is key to understanding the mirroring of biological and artistic reproduction in his work. In print No. IV, for instance, Twombly orients a mushroom with a concave funnel cap and pointed stem at top center to imply that its priapic structure will penetrate a similarly funnel-shaped fungal body just below it (see frontispiece). In print No. VIII, an image of a ball hangs from a wall hook in the upper right, evoking a breast, a scrotum, or both simultaneously (fig. 15).<sup>37</sup> And in No. X, a vigorous line and scribble erupt from an erect form, intimating ejaculation (see fig. 10).<fig id="fg15" position="float" fig-type="figure">

They drew such species as stinkhorns, he argues, with emphasis on their “erect, drooping, ejaculating, and dripping phalli.” These artist-naturalists offered, Freedberg writes, “a kind of unrepentant <italic>jouissance</italic> in drawing the phallic or testicular parallel, or making specimens seem to be as genital as they possibly could.”<sup>38</sup> Twombly’s meandering squiggles and abstract mushrooms, as such, repeatedly evoke a generative capacity or fecundity. Fungi are by their nature fruitful organisms, and we rarely consider them singularly. They spawn together in trays or beds of compost on mushroom farms, and we buy them in groups for consumption. In nature, particularly after a rainstorm, mushrooms shoot through the grasses and forest undergrowth in clusters, and with an abundance that dispenses with reproductive inhibitions. Indeed, Twombly’s ten prints read as though they belonged to such a family, his mushrooms emerging from one print to the next as if each anticipated the other’s existence.</p>
      <p>Notably, Twombly’s appropriation of Leonardo’s <italic>Leda and the Swan</italic> involved its own form of visual reproduction. Twombly drew inspiration from a copy, perhaps even a postcard, of the painting that now hangs in the Borghese Gallery in Rome. The artist’s portfolio, then, is the result of a process of layered visual representation that reiterates naturalist reproductions—images of fungi that depict a type, a median view of all mushrooms from that particular species. If the parallel between making art and making nature is not enough, consider the mythological tale of Leda and the swan itself, in which Zeus, disguised as a swan, “seduces” Leda. That same night, Leda heightens her fruitfulness by copulating with her husband. The two events begat four children, two by each “suitor.” In Leonardo’s painting, two children are depicted, a large egg suggesting their origin, but also the second set of twins yet to be born. In his print, however, Twombly cropped out Leda’s children, creating his own progeny as the dual realms of art and nature. Still, one could compare the surprising elements of the Leda and the swan story that Twombly evoked in his mushroom portfolio and the very unexpected and often irrational aspects of mushrooming and making art.</p>
      <p>Indeed, fungi are complex organisms that carry a range of connotations. If we look at fungi as conversely parasitic and generative, for instance, they represent the multiple possible outcomes of copulation. Sex can be pleasurable, but it can also be dangerous and deadly. Selecting a partner and hunting mushrooms can be equally euphoric and perilous; both endeavors present us with situations and experiences that are never completely knowable. Twombly’s anthropomorphic fungi, then, expose not only the very human anxiety surrounding sexual interactions but, more importantly, through the art of hunting mushrooms, our awareness of the deficiencies of visual perception in our attempts to order our world.</p>
      <p>Twombly’s mushroom hunts in life and in print reinforce the entwinements of culture and nature. His fungi are not merely incidental motifs but organisms specifically selected to elicit parallels between the processes of hunting specimens and making art. <italic>Natural History Part I, Mushrooms</italic> operates as a kind of contemporary field guide that marks epistemological shifts in the sciences, from the so-called golden age of natural history to our own present-day understanding of microbiology, from the age of whole-organism study to that of DNA analysis. Taking mushrooms as his central motif and the hunt as his structure, the artist extended a naturalist activity beyond its discrete operations of walking, picking, and cooking and makes us question the relation between forms of perception, systems of taxonomy, and the fixity of knowledge. As the field guide author David Arora has said, “Mushroom hunting is not simply a matter of traipsing through the woods. . . . It is an art, a skill, a meditation, and a process.”<sup>39</sup> Twombly’s portfolio consists of more than drawn lines, collaged mushrooms, and printed papers. It resuscitates a historical natural history and at the same time makes us aware of natural history’s persistent relevance today, a practice about which artists have at least as much to say as scientists, if not more. Twombly’s mushrooms are metaphors, organisms, material evidence of being. But they morph as quickly into something else—a gesture, an action, an event, a passing thought, connecting natural and artistic exploration. We take pleasure in lingering over each mushroom image, toiling among the marks and voids that surround and obscure them, and immersing ourselves in the richness of fertile soil. These visual accretions rise through the collaged forms and saturated scribbles of printed paper unexpectedly, yet elegantly—like mushrooms rising through the surface of the earth after rain.</p>
