<plain_text><page sequence="1">Archaeology in Turkey: The Stone, Bronze, and Iron Ages, 2000 ALAN M. GREAVES AND BARBARA HELWING* Few nation-states can boast of an archaeological heritage as rich as that of Turkey (fig. 1 ) . While this has never been any great secret to historians, in the past 10 years there has been a noticeable change in the general public's perceptions of Turkey. The responsible management of cultural resources has now become a topic of public interest, even more so in a nation facing the challenges of a rapidly changing economy. As part of its objective of creat- ing an archaeological site inventory for the whole of Turkey, the TAY (Tiirkiye Arkeolojik Yerle§me- leri) Project documents and publishes the status of registered archaeological sites as they exist at this time on the ground. The result is an often alarming catalogue of sites now lost to the bulldoz- er; this information is disseminated in English and Turkish via print and on the Internet.1 The project has an impressive collection of academic and fi- nancial backers, and its results are distributed wide- ly through the Turkish government from the Pres- ident down to local municipalities. There can be few countries that are experiencing the same lev- els of destruction as Turkey is, as a result of the factors mentioned above, but even fewer that docu- ment and publicize it so effectively as the TAY Project does. Large-scale destruction of archaeological sites has also inevitably resulted from the long-antici- pated completion of the Birecik Dam. Now post- excavation analysis of the results of excavations carried out under the glare of the world's media can begin. Only following the publication of this research can the full implication of the archaeo- logical work completed be absorbed and assimi- lated by the academic community. No sooner have the sites of the Birecik Dam area been covered than another project, the Ihsu Dam on the Upper Tigris, began (figs. 2-3) . Archaeolog- ical survey work in this area has already been car- ried out and published2 and a response is under way, coordinated by METU University's Center for Research and Assessment of the Historic Environ- ment (TACDAM) under the direction of Numan Tuna.3 Researchers have moved quickly to initiate several new projects in the dam zone. Perhaps not surprisingly, initial results from this previously over- looked area of archaeological research have thrown new light on old questions about the historical ge- ography of the Assyrian provinces, fueled in partic- ular by the newly discovered texts from Giricano. Other important developments in the year 2000 included the discovery of a new type of hominoid in Qankin-Corakyerler. The new fossil, thought to represent a missing link between the Asian and African hominoid species, once again highlights Turkey's crucial role as a bridge between the conti- nents. For the Bronze Age, the discovery of large grain and water storage installations at Bogazkoy and Ku§akh will fuel much debate about their Hit- tite builders and the economic and political signif- icance of these works. Also, the surprise discovery of a seemingly Hittite inscription on Mount Lat- mos will further the debate of the historical geogra- phy of Bronze Age western Anatolia mentioned in last year's newsletter. For the Iron Age, the culmi- nation of renewed excavations at a number of Urar- tian sites around Van will, we hope, lead to a reas- sessment of the importance of this long overlooked culture. BIBLIOGRAPHIC REVIEW Print Publications. Following the example set by the Keban Dam Rescue Projects, publication of the salvage excavations in the flood areas of the new Birecik, Karkamish, Ihsu, and Batman Dams have been published with admirable speed. The second volume, consisting of reports from the 1999 sea- son, is now available.4 * This article is based on notes taken at the 23rd Interna- tional Symposium of Excavations, Surveys and Archaeometry in Ankara (28 May-1 June 2001) and from published works. Many excavators provided reports, illustrations, and informa- tion for inclusion here and are credited in the text, for these we are enormously grateful. Thanks are also due to Suheyla Gedik of Hacettepe University, the staff of the British Insti- tute of Archaeology in Ankara and the University of Liverpool. 1 http://tayproject.eies.itu.edu.tr/ 2Algazeetal. 1991. 3http://www.metu.edu.tr/home/wwwmuze/tacdam.html 4Tunaetal. 2001.

Fifty years of research by members of Istan- bul University are reviewed in one large volume, with a short summary on every excavation.5 An in- formative review of the research history of Hittitolo- gy has also been provided in a richly illustrated bi- lingual exhibition catalogue by F. Canpolat (2001), which includes short biographies of the most emi- nent scholars of the field. Research into the as yet poorly understood Bronze Age of eastern Anatolia has received a remarkable input with the publication of Aynur Ozfirat's Dogu Anadolu Yayla Kulturleri, based on her University of Istanbul Ph.D. thesis (2001). This tries to extract archaeological information from material deriving almost entirely from clandestine excavations on the eastern Anatolian high plateau. Conferences. In May 2001 the annual Interna- tional Symposium of Excavations, Surveys and Ar- chaeometry was held, and all the archaeological project directors who had worked in Turkey pre- sented the results of their work from the 2000 sea- son. This year it returned to its traditional home - the National Library in Ankara. The proceedings of the 2000 symposium are now published as Kazi Sonular Toplantasi volume 22. Neolithic faunal remains from Turkey were dis- cussed in a series of papers held at the fourth sym- posium on "Archaeozoology in the Near East," in- cluding papers focusing on Qatalhdyuk and Cayonu.6 Papers presented at the conference "La Cilicie: Espaces et pouvoirs locaux (2^me millenaire av. J.-C.-4^me siecle ap. J.-C.)" held at the French In- stitute in Istanbul in November 1999 have also now been published.7 Electronic publications. A number of sites now have their own Web sites, with additional informa- tion, color images, and contact information. These include: Liman Tepe, Panaztepe, Bakla Tepe, Bogazkoy, Troy, Catalhoyiik, gos Hoyiik, Kerkenes Dag, and a number of other sites. The Web site ad- dresses are included in the listings for these sites, given below. The foreign research schools also now have Web sites, including: The British Institute of Archaeology at Anka- ra (www.britac.ac.uk/institutes/ankara), The German Institute of Archaeology in Istanbul (www.dainst.de/de/ abt/istanbul.html) , and The American Research Insti- tute in Turkey (http://mec.sas.upenn.edu/ARIT). These can provide foreign scholars with useful con- tacts and information about research, study, and trav- el in Turkey. Festschrifts. On the occasion of his 65th birth- day, Harald Hauptmann was presented with a festschrift by his students, containing a variety of articles relating to Anatolian archaeology.8 MIOCENE Pa$alar. During the 17th season of excavation at the middle Miocene site of Pa§alar, lead by Berna Alpagut of Ankara University, another 20 m2 of fos- sil-bearing layers were exposed to the north and northwest of the area previously uncovered. Re- mains of hominoids, classified as ramapithecus, are for the most part represented by teeth and mandi- ble fragments and make up of 5% of the total fossil bone assemblage. Overall, ruminants form the larg- est group, followed by suids and carnivores. Two species of elephants are represented, and an up- standing elephant foot was the most remarkable find of the 2000 season. Giraffes, anchitheria, hip- popotamus, and rhinoceros are represented, fur- ther supporting the suggested reconstruction of a mixed tropical-steppe environment. (Jankiri-Qorakyerler. Rescue excavations at the late Miocene site of Qankm-Corakyerler were car_ ried out by Qankin Museum with scientific supervi- sion by Ayla Sevim of Ankara University. The 2000 season's star find was the remains of a new type of hominoid, dating to between 8 and 7 mya, the most recent found in Turkey to date. The fossil, proba- bly a male, is thought to belong to a previously un- known species and is expected to help to further clarify the relationship between the Asian and Afri- can hominoids. Faunal remains found alongside the hominoid belong to proboscidae, rhinoceros, equids, cervidae, giraffes, suids, and bovide, indi- cating the existence of an open grassland savanna at that time.9 PALEOLITHIC Karain. Excavations at Karain cave continued in several squares in hall E, under the direction of I. Yalgmkaya of Ankara University. The layers exposed belonged to the middle Paleolithic phase III3, also known as the Karain Mousterian, and characterized by the use of Levallois technology, with sidescrap- ers, round scrapers, and notched pieces. The ac- companying fauna included foxes, turtles, birds, and deer. Visitors now find it easier to visit Karain since iron ladders and platforms were installed.10 5 Belli 2000. 6Russell and Martin 2000; Hongo and Meadow 2000; Ilgez- di 2000; Oksuz 2000. 7Jeanetal. 2001. 8Boehmer and Maran 2001. 9 For a report on the 1999 season, see Sevim and Kiper 2001 . 10For a report on the 1999 season, see Yalcinkaya et al. 2001 .</page><page sequence="4">74 ALAN M. GREAVES AND BARBARA HELWING [AJA107 Komurcu-Kaletepe. The international team work- ing under the direction of Nur Balkan-Ath at the obsidian quarry and workshop in Komurcu-Kalete- pe, on the slopes of Golludag, divided their atten- tion between the Paleolithic and the Neolithic us- age of the site. As a result of exceptional erosion during the winter of 1999-2000, Paleolithic layers cut by the slopes of dere 3 were accessible for excava- tion. Four subsequent occupation horizons over- laying the natural rock, and sealed on top by dat- able volcanic layers, were exposed. The oldest lay- er consists of a pre-Acheulean layer containing coarse rhyolite implements, followed by a horizon with Acheulean industry, the next with Levallois blade technology, and the uppermost with Leval- lois flake-based Mousterian. An estimated time range for the sequence from 1,000,000 B.C., possi- bly correlating to the formation of the obsidian de- posits, to 100,000 B.C., is assumed. A Pleistocene horse mandible was found in the second layer and dated to around 200,000 B.C., making it the oldest known Anatolian horse. For the Neolithic period at Komurcu-Kaletepe, see below.11 U^agizh Magarasi. Erksin Gulec, Ankara Univer- sity, and Steven Kuhn and Mary Stiner, University of Arizona, kindly provide the following information on this unique early Upper Paleolithic cave site: Ucagizh Cave, located on the Mediterranean coast about 1 2 km south of the town of Samandag, is unique within Turkey for its long sequence of early Upper Paleolithic deposits. The site is situ- ated on a steep coastal slope approximately 18 m above sea level. Once a much larger chamber, the cave collapsed at some time in the past. In situ deposits are preserved mainly along the former back wall of the cave, as well as in a tunnel-like side chamber. Despite erosion that occurred sub- sequent to the collapse of the cave vault, the se- quence of early Upper Paleolithic deposits is near- ly 3 m deep in some areas. AMS radiocarbon de- terminations indicate that the deposits span a period from approximately 28,000 to 41,000 radio- carbon years ago (uncalibrated) . The earliest Upper Paleolithic layers at Ucagizh cave (layers F, G, and H) contain what is known in the eastern Mediterranean as the Initial Upper Paleolithic or IUP. The IUP is characterized by typ- ical Upper Paleolithic tool forms (endscrapers, burins, etc.) manufactured using techniques that closely resemble Middle Paleolithic Levallois tech- Fig. 2. The Karkamish Dam area. (Map: Archeographics) nology. Because it contains features of both Middle and Upper Paleolithic, the IUP is considered by some researchers to be "transitional" between the two periods. More recent in situ deposits at the top of the Ucagizh stratigraphic sequence (layers B- B3) contain a classic kind of Upper Paleolithic as- semblage, characterized by well-developed prismat- ic blade technology. The materials from these lay- ers most closely resemble early Ahmarian assem- blages from sites such as Ksar cAkil (Lebanon) and Yabrud (Syria). The intervening layers (C, D, and E) appear to document a gradual evolutionary tran- sition between the IUP and the Ahmarian. Ugagizh has yielded rich assemblages of stone tools, animal bones, and other archaeological ma- terials. Analyses of these materials, as well as stud- ies of pollen, phytoliths, and sediment micromor- 11 For a report on the 1999 season, see Balkan-Atli et al. 2001; for the 2000 season, see Balkan-Atli and Binder 2001.</page><page sequence="5">2003] ARCHAEOLOGY IN TURKEY 75 Fig. 3. The Ihsu Dam area. (Map: Archeographics) phology, are in progress. Given the site's proximity to the sea, it is somewhat surprising that the prehis- toric inhabitants concentrated their foraging activ- ities mainly on terrestrial resources. The more re- cent layers (B-B3, C) do contain evidence for the use of coastal foods, including mollusks and even large marine fish. The remains of large terrestrial game, however, including roe deer (Capreolus capre- olus) , fallow deer {Dama mesopotamica) , and wild goats (Capra aegagrus) dominate throughout the strati- graphic sequence. One explanation for this terres- trial focus may be the presence of two short, steep- walled valleys on either side of the site. These val- leys would have been ideal spots for ambushing and trapping game animals, and they may have been one of the main things that attracted Paleolithic hunter-gatherers to the site. One of the outstanding features of Ucagizh Cave is the abundance of ornaments within the deposits. More than 1,500 beads and pendants, manufactured from a range marine and freshwater shells, have been recovered to date. Shell beads are present in substantial numbers throughout the stratigraphic sequence, including the earliest IUP layers (strata G and H). In fact, the perforated shells from layer H at Ucagizh Cave rank among the earliest well-dat- ed personal ornaments associated with Upper Pale- olithic or Late Stone Age remains anywhere in the world. Their presence demonstrates that distinc- tive traditions of personal ornamentation appeared almost simultaneously in Africa, Europe, and south- west Asia around 41,000-42,000 years ago.12 Karkamish Palaeolithic Survey. The 2000 season of surveying for Paleolithic sites in the Karkamish Dam environment, carried out by Harun Ta§kiran from Ankara University, has augmented the num- ber of registered locations to 70. The sites are re- stricted to the upper Euphrates terraces, at an elevation between 350 and 400 masl. Periods rec- ognized are the Upper Acheulean and Middle Pa- leolithic, while the Upper Paleolithic is still not attested.13 EARLIER NEOLITHIC Southeastern Anatolia and Cilicia Demirkdy. Excavations at Demirkoy Hoyuk in Batman Province were resumed in 2000 by Michael Rosenberg of the University of Delaware with four new soundings being opened in the central part of the site, and with the completion of the 1997 sound- ing opened on the southern slope. So far no archi- tectural remains more substantial than occasional plaster surfaces have been encountered. The finds, including serpentine beads, bone tubular beads, stone discs, and stone pestles, fall well within the standard range of PPNB material culture. In the 12 A report on the 1999 season has appeared in Dincer et al. 2001. 13 A report on the 1999 season is available in Tasjuran and Kartal2001.</page><page sequence="6">76 ALAN M. GREAVES AND BARBARA HELWING [AJA107 new soundings, four adult/ sub-adult burials were discovered, bringing the total number of burials at Demirkoy to six. Bodies were interred in a flexed position with their extremities apparently bound together. On the bones of one burial, lying in a tightly flexed position, red and black bands were visible, and these may be the remains of the decora- tion of textile or leather with which the feet of the deceased had been bound together. Mezraa Teleilat. Rescue excavations at the enor- mous Neolithic site Mezraa Teleilat in the Karka- mish Dam area under the direction of Mehmet Oz- dogan of Istanbul University have advanced at re- markable speed, with 30 grids being uncovered so far. Neolithic remains are found immediately un- derneath the large Iron Age building. The uppermost Neolithic layer, dating to the Halaf period, was badly disturbed by Achaemenian pits. Beneath this lay a building layer with corridor houses, associated with proto-Halaf material. The third building layer, divided into three sub-phases, is characterized by red polished pottery, compara- ble to Hassuna material. Red-on-buff and impressed pottery also occurs. The architecture consisted of cell plan houses with dry stone walls using locally available limestone, arranged around large open spaces. In the north of the excavated area, a heavy fire seems to have put an end to this occupation. In one of the burnt house cells lay the skeletons of four caprines and a human skeleton. This probably represents a stable for sheep or goats, and the hu- man may have been killed while trying to rescue the animals from the fire. The next layer appears to represent a period of temporary abandonment in this part of the site. No architectural remains were encountered, and two graves with flexed human skeletons were its only features. The following layer belonged to the PPN peri- od, represented by a well-preserved building level. Here was a rectangular house, constructed from dry stone wall with a larger central room and nar- row, long side-rooms. Characteristic stone bowls were found in the house. PPNB layers have been similarly encountered on the western slope, but here in the form of small narrow buildings with thin mudbrick walls. Post- holes form a regular feature in these buildings and point to the extensive use of wooden poles. Byblos and Amuq points, as well as flint borers and disc shaped scrapers, form a regular part of the PPN lithic assemblage. An hourglass shaped bone ob- ject is identified as a belt hook.14 On the Iron Age levels, see below. Gobekli Tepe. Excavations at Gobekli Tepe, by director Harald Hauptmann and field director Klaus Schmidt, continued in 2000 with the further investigation of Buildings B and C. Building B, in common with previously excavated constructions, was surrounded by stone benches. A monolithic stone frame that may once have served as a window was the most remarkable find in this area. So far, about one quarter of Building C has been exposed. With a date of ca. 9000 B.C. (cal.), this is the oldest building so far investigated at Gobekli Tepe. One of its pillars has relief decoration, with the four feet of a large animal preserved. Fragments of sculp- tures apparently smashed in antiquity were found among the stone debris filling the building. A frag- ment of a human torso is closely related to an exam- ple known from Nevali Qori, as is the head of a pred- ator with fletched teeth. Material from Building C could be seen as being typical of the PPNB, but it could also be earlier, as Helwan and Nemrik points occur alongside the otherwise typical PPNB industry. A great deal of effort was also put into safeguard- ing the site. Mobile roof construction, covering 500 m2, has been set up.15 Exceptional as the site is, more limestone statues have now begun to turn up in the Taurus foothills, suggesting that the sculptures recovered at Nevali Qori and Gobekli Tepe are part of a wider cultural phenomenon. One of these statues from the vicinity of Adiyaman has recently been published.16 Akar^ay Tepe. Investigations at Akargay Tepe in the Karkamish Dam rescue area, carried out by an international team led by a group from Istanbul University, continued on a limited scale in two soundings. In these trenches, no coherent archi- tecture was uncovered, but house corners and open- air working spaces, a roasting pit, and garbage dumps were found. The associated material con- sisted of monochrome pottery with lug handles and husking trays. Only in the third layer came any dif- ferent pottery, characterized by a dark surface and simple shapes. The lithic industry represented in these layers was closely related to the PPNB, but 14 For a report on the 1999 season, see Kami et al. 2001; Ozdogan et al. 2001b. 15 Several reports summarizing the activities of the recent years have appeared, e.g., Schmidt 2000a, 2000b, 2001. 16 Hauptmann 2000.</page><page sequence="7">2003] ARCHAEOLOGY IN TURKEY 77 also includes conical cores that would be more rep- resentative of the PN. Stone vessels and an obsid- ian bead show that ground stone industry was well developed during that time.17 Kortik Tepe. Excavations at the flat site of Kdr- tik Tepe in Diyarbakir Province, conducted by Veci- hi Ozkaya from Dicle University, have exposed sev- eral PPN period hocker graves and unconnected floor remains, immediately below the plow soil. Grave goods accompanying the burials include stone vessels with coarse geometric incisions, cylin- drical stone beads, and grinding stones. The stone bowls from the graves allow comparisons to be made with other early PPN sites, such as Nemrik and Hallan Cemi Tepesi. Central Anatolia Kdmurrii-Kaletepe. Investigations at the Neolith- ic obsidian quarry and workshop continued in areas P and M. The cultural sequence of the main excavation area (P) had already been established but was refined in 2000, with five layers being distin- guished from the middle Paleolithic to the late PPNB. Excavation concentrated on exposing more of an obsidian workshop in layer 3, dated to the ninth millennium B.C. - the early to middle PPNB. Obsidian debitage, estimated to be up to 12 tons in weight, is distributed over a circular area approximately 7 m in diameter. A circular concentration of homogeneous debitage distrib- uted across a ca. 1.5 m diameter area appears to be a knapping station. Among the obsidian de- bris, carbonized vegetation residues were pre- served, and these may help to establish a firm date for this layer. Investigations in area M, ca. 200 m from area P, were carried out by systematic small-scale surface collection and the excavation of a 4 m2 trench. The material was characterized by debitage from the preparation of biface forms comparable to Qatal- hoyuk VIII (according to Mellaart's sequence), dat- ing approximately to the second third of the sev- enth millennium B.C.18 Musular. Excavations at Musular, carried out un- der the scientific supervision of Mihriban Ozba§a- ran, continued on a small scale in 2000, with an extension of the excavated trenches toward the east. Two new soundings were made to the east and the south to investigate the extent of the settlement. Results confirm the current picture of a settlement with large-roomed houses arranged around open spaces. A canal of dry stone wall construction apparently provided drainage for rainwater. In contrast to the slightly earlier site of A§ikh, animal bone assem- blages from Musular included cattle as the main domestic animal. Among the wild species, horses were most common. So far only a small sample of paleobotanic remains have been analyzed. As at A§ikh, wheat and barley, lentils, and bitter vetch were the major crops.19 Catalhdyiik. Following the long 1999 season, work at Catalhoyuk in 2000, directed by Ian Hod- der of Stanford University, concentrated mainly on post-excavation analysis and remote sensing. Ground penetrating radar and high-resolution magnetometer surveys were carried out on Qatal- hoyiik East and yielded better results than previ- ous attempts at remote sensing on the site. A large building that was detected on the southern slope and investigated by surface scraping proved to be Byzantine in date. Other activity included continued work in Build- ing 3 of the Berkeley area, where five building phas- es, each with further subdivisions, have now been distinguished. Detailed analysis of the platforms inside the building indicates that they each had a distinctive function; the southern platform being used for food preparation while the northern plat- forms were for burials. The northeastern platform, which was painted red, held the grave of an adult man, while two children were interred below the northwestern platform. On Catalhoyuk West remains of a domestic house consisting of one large room with three adjacent side-rooms, distinguishable into four or five phas- es, was found. Here the mudbrick walls were con- structed as double walls, but only rarely were the walls and floors plastered. Storage bins form do- mestic installations in the corner of the large room, and the floor was covered with smashed pottery, apparently the remains of a deliberate abandon- ment and destruction. The pottery was mostly paint- ed red on white, although there was some incised and white encrusted decoration on black pottery. 17 The report on the 1999 season is now available (Arimura etal. 2001). 18 The 1999 season has been reported by Balkan-Atli et al. 2001 .

GREAVES AND BARBARA HELWING [AJA107 There was also a unique example of a quadrangular vessel of white plaster with bichrome decoration.20 Konya Plain Survey. Carried out by Douglas Baird of Liverpool University, in 2000 this survey extended to the west in order to include different soil types and the hilly flanks of the Konya Plain. In stark contrast to the pattern emerging from the Car§amba fan, which is dotted with early sites, hard- ly any prehistoric settlement is attested in this area, revealing a clear preference for the fertile alluvial soils further down. Western and Coastal Anatolia including Thrace Marmara-Thrace. A comparative analysis of the lithic industries of Bulgarian and Turkish Neolith- ic sites, which is important for understanding the transition from Mesolithic to Neolithic in this area, has now been published.21 LATER NEOLITHIC TO CHALCOLITHIC Southeastern Anatolia and Cilicia Arslantepe. Because of their commitment to the Karkamish Dam rescue project, work by the Ar- slantepe team in 2000 was restricted to a study season, concentrating on the material from the large period VII public building found in 1998- 1999 in the southwest area. A closer examination of the mass-produced conical bowls found both scattered on the southern part of the floor of the main rooms, and stapled upside down in a side- room, showed that the assemblage falls into two types. Half have a flint scraped base, while the oth- er half has a string-cut flat base, indicating the use of a fast potter's wheel. The bowls vary greatly in size and volume. M. Frangipane suggests that they may have been used as part of a public ritual for the distribution of food rations, with food being eaten on the spot within the context of a ritual- ized redistributive event. Cleaning and conservation of the Arslantepe VII wall paintings allowed two layers of paint to be dis- tinguished. The pictorial scope of the upper layer, where red-orange was the main color, clearly relates to the depictions in the VIA wall paintings found there previously. Further restoration of the VIA wall decoration revealed black and red painted plastic lozenges on the walls of a side-room to Temple B.22 Tilbe§ir. Excavations continued under the direc- tion of Christine Lepinski-Lecomte from CNRS in both the deep sounding on the western slope of the high mound and in area J of the lower town. The continuation of the deep sounding, where lay- ers of the late fourth millennium B.C. had been uncovered last season, proved the existence of a large mudbrick structure, supposedly a city wall, at the bottom of the sounding. The associated materi- al is heavily chaff tempered but also contains some Uruk related shapes. The Bronze Age remains ex- posed in the lower town are discussed below.23 Tell Kurdu. There are some new publications on this site.24 Domuztepe. The joint UCLA-Manchester Univer- sity project at Domuztepe in the Kahramanmaras, Plain ran a study season in 2000, investigating aspects of ritual, economy, ecology, and environment at the site. Analysis of remains from the so-called Death Pit revealed further details of a complex ritual that must have begun with the offering of cattle in the pit before human remains were deposited above. Within a short period of time, more than 30 indi- viduals were buried here, all young adults within the 15-23 age range, and in an apparently healthy physical state. Their skulls had been removed from the body before burial and placed separately. Dis- membered body parts were buried only after sub- stantial parts of the flesh had been removed. The pit was later set on fire, resulting in an ash layer that covered the human remains. Finally, the Death Pit was marked with a wooden post. New data on the economy of the site indicates that subsistence was based on mixed husbandry, with pig, cattle, sheep, and goat being the major groups of faunal remains. Craft activities at Domuztepe includ- ed stone carving, obsidian knapping and grinding, basketry, and textile production. Neutron activation analysis (NAA) of the obsidian revealed that the raw material was imported not only from central and east- ern Anatolia, but also from as far away as Armenia. The analysis of pollen samples is currently being carried out by the Groningen laboratories. 20 The second volume of the Qatalhoyuk monographs has appeared, dealing exclusively with methodological reflections (Hodder 2000b) .

Hacinebi now has a Web site available.26 Fistikli Hoyiik. Fieldwork at the small Early Halaf site of Fistikli Hoyiik in the Karkamish rescue area, carried out by Susan Pollock and Reinhard Bern- beck of Binghamton University, ended with the com- pletion of the 2000 season. Two more tholoi and the remains of a cell building all with limestone foundations and pise walls were uncovered. In two areas, on the northern and eastern fringes of the settlement, remains of large pise earthworks were uncovered and are assumed to have protect- ed the settlement against occasional flooding by the Euphrates. Later in the history of the settle- ment, the area adjacent to the eastern earthwork was turned into a rubbish dump. Open areas were another distinctive feature of the site and featured sequences of large domed kilns with plastered floors, and fireplaces one on top of another. Radiocarbon dates place the site in the first half of the sixth millennium B.C. (7020 ± 45 B.R; 6840 ± 45 B.R). Among the typical Early Halaf pottery, a body sherd with a human representation is espe- cially noteworthy. Processing of flint and, to a lesser degree, obsidian took place on site. Stamp seals carved with geometric designs, stone discs inter- preted as counting devices, and clay tokens were also found.27 Kenan Tepe. B. Parker of the University of Utah reports that the prehistoric occupation of Kenan Tepe could only be accessed in one small (2x2 m) sounding, containing Ubaid pottery. The tomb of an adult woman, containing no burial gifts but with remains of textiles, was the only feature.28 A§agi Salat Tepe. Despite considerable quanti- ties of Uruk pottery collected on the southern, erod- ed part of A§agi Salat Tepe, situated above the Di- cle River in the Ihsu Dam rescue area, excavations conducted by S. Yucel §enyurt of Gazi University have so far not reached the Chalcolithic layers. Salat Tepe. There is a new publication on this site.29 Eastern and Northern Anatolia Sos Hoyiik. During the seventh season of exca- vations at Sos Hoyiik, directed by Antonio Sagona of Melbourne University, investigation of the re- mains of the Late Chalcolithic settlement contin- ued. A date between 3500 and 3300 B.C. has been proposed or the earliest occupation (layer VA), based on radiocarbon dates. The settlement at this time was characterized by houses constructed from mudbrick without stone foundations with lime-plas- tered floors and with circular or ring-shaped hearths. Material retrieved from the earliest level belongs to the Sioni type of the Proto-Kura Arax culture. On top of this earliest layer stood a huge curved wall, 2.5 m wide and preserved to a height of 1.75 m. This wall must represent some sort of fortification, but its position at the very heart of the settlement is currently not well understood. It may, according to Sagona, have served as an internal boundary wall. The wall had been destroyed twice, possibly by earthquakes, once around 3100 B.C. and again around 3000 B.C. Finally, domestic houses were constructed around and above it, with a sherd- paved floor laid out on top of a layer of pure sand. A crucible fragment and residues of bronze were found here in a layer characterized by Late Kura Arax pottery and Martkopi ware.30 Central Anatolia Kosjk Hoyiik. Excavations at K6§k Hoyiik were resumed in 2000 under the direction of Erol Fay- dali of Nigde Museum, with scientific supervision by Aliye Oztan and Siileyman Ozkan of Ankara University, who very kindly provided the following report: During the excavations, the upper layers in the previously untouched squares H-I/ll-12 were re- moved and the third building level was exposed. In square H/ll, the area below the 1995 water pump was excavated down to level 1. Here, huge quantities of pottery with a light colored orange or buff slip and brown geometric painting, apparently imported Can Hasan 2B ware, came to light. In the space between the building, an ash pit containing animal bones and horns as well as a lot of pottery, both painted and unpainted varieties were found. The head of a crouching mother goddess figurine, resembling the Hoyiicek plug-head figurines, but in terracotta, was found. Among the pottery were frag- 25 A note on the 2000 study season appeared in Campbell 2000. 26 http://faculty-web.at.northwestern.edu/anthropology/ stein/index.html 27 Reports on the 1999 season have appeared in Pollock and Bernbeck 2001; Pollock etal. 2001.

GREAVES AND BARBARA HELWING [AJA107 merits with relief decoration, showing humans with hands extended towards the head of a deer, or grasp- ing its tail, throwing a boomerang or holding a tree. These humans are shown with short skirts held to- gether by a belt. In the second excavation layer, gray slipped ce- ramic with stamped and incised white encrusted motives, such as spirals and rays, comparable to material from Gelveri, Guvercinkayasi, and Orman Fidanhgi, and with connections reaching as far as the Middle Danube valley, were found. Under a mudbrick bench, west of a small room found in this layer, five human skulls were found. The third building level in squares H/ 11-12 con- sisted of three houses, arranged east and west of an irregular alley. The first house measured 8 x 4 m and, like the others, had a trapezoidal plan. It had a large central room with two small storage rooms to the north and a workspace to the south. The large room had been repaved during the course of its us- age, then a pavement of ceramic fragments was laid out before the room was replastered. Some of the fragments used for the pavement had relief decora- tion, including motifs that had not previously been encountered, such as reptiles and leopards, with the leopard's dots shown as small lunates. Also seen for the first time was a mother goddess holding the head of a calf under her arm. A theriomorph vessel from the fourth room, which is reminiscent of wall reliefs from Qatalhdyuk, probably represents the head of a deer. Beneath the bench inside the fourth room, an infant burial was found. The second house lay north of the first and had five sides. It reused the north wall of the first house for its southern wall. It had a single room with a nar- row (50 cm wide) entrance. Probably a workspace, this room was equipped with an oven next to the eastern wall and a bin in the north corner. Arranged along the western wall were a square silo, a mortar and a pot stand made from mud, a bin with two com- partments, and another silo. A stone pot-stand was found on the floor, as was a fragment of a thin-walled white stone bowl, a rare find at K6§k Hoyiik. Two rooms of the third trapezoidal house were partially excavated, and an oven and a bench instal- lation were found in the southern room. A Halaf- style stamp seal cut from a green veined stone was found on the street of level 3. A small sounding was sunk in order to investi- gate the fourth building level, and a soft ashy fill was encountered 60 cm below level 3. A mudbrick wall with stone foundations, running northwest- southeast, was found in the middle of the trench. Both faces of the wall had been destroyed by pits dug from above. On the floor west of the wall, six obsidian tools and cores were found.31 Tepecik Qiftlik. Excavations under the direc- tion of Erhan Bicakci from Istanbul University be- gan anew in 2000 at the Neolithic/Chalcolithic site of Tepecik, on the Melendiz plain in Nigde prov- ince, close to the famed Giftlik/Golludag obsidian sources. The site is a shallow mound measuring 300 x 170 m and rising 4.5-9.5 m above the plain. Excavations began by opening several trenches on the southeastern terrace, where two Neolithic build- ing levels were encountered at a depth of 2 m, be- neath a layer of pits. Here dry stone walls were con- structed from small volcanic tuff stones preserved to 5-6 layers high. The walls formed rectangular building units, which were apparently domestic houses judging by installations such as a tandir oven. The pottery from these layers was handmade mono- chrome, usually light buff in color, or occasionally red slipped and burnished. Shapes are simple, with deep bowls and S-profiled jars. Plastic decoration occurs; most remarkably the plastic figure of a bull attached to the body sherd of a large jar. The lithic industry was based on obsidian, with leaf shaped and tanged points all showing a fine retouch cover- ing the whole surface. Artifacts include ground stone mace heads and abundant bone implements, especially awls. Horse phalangi were used to pro- duce bone idols. The cultural sequence at Tepecik began in the second half of the seventh millennium B.C. in the PPN, and ran well into the Chalcolithic. Compari- sons for the material from Tepecik can be made with K6§k Hoyiik, especially the plastic decoration of pottery.32 Guvercinkayasi. Excavations at Guvercinkayasi, under the direction of Sevil Gulcur of Istanbul Univerity, extended the previously exposed areas on the northwestern slope and the acropolis. It was clear that the new rooms uncovered on the acropo- lis had been blocked with big stone slabs at the end of their use. Beneath this, room fills with pottery appeared. In situ finds included large storage jars standing within the remains of ovens; a bin show- ing traces of at least two burning events; and a large pot with bull's horn relief. On the slope, the ex- 31 For a report on the K6§k Hoyiik seals, see Ozkan 2001. 32 A report on the first season at the site, providing ample pictorial evidence, is already available (Bicakci 2001 ) .</page><page sequence="11">2003] ARCHAEOLOGY IN TURKEY 81 posed rooms contained clay benches and large bins filled with pottery, grinding stones, and bone tools. One room, apparently a potter's workshop, had been used as a storeroom containing a silo and many bone tools. Broken copper fragments found in a pot and pestle stones found in situ point to the processing of copper at the site. Stone sling pellets were found in considerable quantities. Square pot- tery vessels, a jar with a pointed base, and more bichrome white on red painted pottery broaden the range of known pottery types from the site. Two new calibrated radiocarbon dates now place the site at ca. 4800 B.C., making it contemporary with Northern Ubaid sites.33 Cadir Hoyiik. Excavations at Cadir Hoyiik under the direction of Ronald Gorny from the University of Chicago continued with a deep sounding and new trenches dug on the south and east of the site. The south slope yielded the burnt remains of a large building close to the enclosure wall and as- sumed to be a gate building, with finds of fruit- stands and omphalos bowls and radiocarbon dates from the fifth millennium B.C. The sequence un- covered in the deep sounding consists of two su- perimposed building layers of the fourth millenni- um and two pot burials. Associated with the lower level, were the remains of what was apparently a bead-making workshop, including obsidian drills, bone implements, and the beads themselves.34 Western and Coastal Anatolia including Thrace Mente§e Hoyiik. The 2000 season at Mente§e Hoyiik, directed by Jacob Roodenberg, concentrat- ed on the excavation of a deep sounding, which provided a stratigraphic sequence for the second half of the seventh millennium B.C. In this sound- ing, the outer walls of two buildings were encoun- tered, both with very different construction tech- niques - one wattle and daub wall, and the other large clay slabs. Below this was the burial of a wom- an and a child. The body of the women rested in a flexed position on a wooden board, or perhaps the remains of a coffin. She wore a necklace of stone beads, and her arms rested on a terracotta box. This burial, dated to 6200-6100 B.C. cal., therefore fills the gap between phases IX and VIII in the Ihpmar sequence. Below the burial level, open spaces and rubble-paved courtyard surfaces were uncovered, yielding mostly monochrome, red burnished pot- tery, with occasional incised decoration and, more rarely, white painted fringes below the rim. A date of 6500-6400 B.C. cal. was obtained for this lower- most occupation level.35 Ilipmar. Work at the site has stopped for now, but material from the Ihpinar excavations is now on dis- play in newly opened showcases in Iznik Museum. Orman Fidanhgi. The final report on the res- cue excavations here, a crucial missing link con- necting the Chalcolithic sequences of Thrace and Anatolia, carried out by Turan Efe between 1992 and 1994, has now been published.36 Kirklareli-A§agi Pmar. A new series of excava- tions at A§agi Pmar, conducted by Mehmet Oz- dogan from Istanbul University, began with the opening of new trenches south of the previously excavated area on the northeast of the mound. The uppermost level was characterized by a round construction built of a double row of wooden poles, associated with monochrome pottery with dot- filled incised bands. The layer below had white on red painted pottery and anthropomorphic ves- sels similar to those from Vinca. Further investigation of the AP 3 phase malachite workshop, especially around the neighboring ov- ens, produced further evidence for all stages of the bead-making process as well as discarded, broken pieces. Beads of a wide range of materials, such as rock crystal, shell and spondylus, marble, and ag- ate, were recorded. Microwear analysis of the flint borers found with them is under way. The reconstruction of a typical post-wall build- ing, assumed to have had a domed upper part, is part of an experimental project that will finally form the core of an open-air museum.37 Bademagaci. Fieldwork in 2000 was restricted to the Byzantine church in area C. New radiocar- bon dates have become available for the Early Neolithic layers at Bademagaci and place the low- ermost layer 8 at ca. 7000 B.C. and layer 4 at ca. 6450-6400 B.C.38 Menek§e Qatagi. Here rescue excavations under the direction of A. Erim-Ozdogan and M.A. I§in re- vealed three layers of badly preserved Chalcolithic occupation. Architecture consisted of post-wall huts, 33 A report on the 1999 season has been published (Giilgur and Endogru 2001). 34Areporton the 1999 season has recently appeared (Gorny etal. 2000). 35 Information on the human remains uncovered during the 2000 season is now published (Alpaslan and Roodenberg 2001 ) . 36 Efe 2001b. 37 A report on the 1999 season has appeared (Ozdogan et al. 2001a). 38 For a report on the 1999 season, see Duru 2001.</page><page sequence="12">82 ALAN M. GREAVES AND BARBARA HELWING [AJA107 and the pottery showed incised decoration, brush- wiped surfaces, and finger impressions and is com- parable to material from Toptepe II- III, resp. Kara- novo VII. At the beginning of the Early Bronze Age was a period of heavy flooding, discernable as a lay- er containing clusters of shells. This destroyed the Chalcolithic occupation layers, especially in the northeastern part of the site. Latmos. Survey work in the mountainous area of Latmos-Be§parmak Dagi continued under the di- rection of Anneliese Peschlow-Bindokat. Nine new rock paintings were recorded during reinvestiga- tion of previously known sites, pushing the known distribution area of this, so far still unique, rock art considerably toward the east and the Cine valley. The number of rock paintings now totals 94. For the first time, ground and chipped stone imple- ments were discovered below one of the paintings. Domestic equipment, such as grinding stones, proves the actual presence of humans close to the paintings. Pottery of LC-EB date was also collected from two unpainted limestone caves on the eastern slope of the Degirmenbogazidere. For results from the Bronze Age, see below. Ulucak Hoyiik. Excavations by E. Abbay and his colleagues from Ege University, Izmir, continued in three trenches, where a stratigraphic sequence running from Late Neolithic to EB was exposed. The Late Neolithic had three building levels that were characterized by rectangular buildings with dry stone walls, preserved to a height of 2.1 m, and plastered floors, which may have had two stories. Characteristic finds were red polished pottery in elaborate shapes, such as oval vessels and one an- thropomorphic vessel; terracotta figurines in the shape of humans and animals; polished stone axes; and a rich bone industry, used for the production of points and shafts. BRONZE AGE Southeastern Anatolia and Cilicia Zeytinli Bahce Hoyiik. Rescue excavations by the Arslantepe team in the Karkarmish Dam zone un- der the direction of M. Frangipane have already added considerably to understanding the crucial transition from the Late Uruk to EB period. A well stratified, long sequence covering this tran- sition from Late Uruk to EB I was exposed in sever- al trenches arranged in steps on the western slope. Unlike most cultural sequences from the region, the transition from the Late Uruk to the EB I peri- od at Zeytinli Bahce seems to have unfolded gradu- ally without abrupt changes. The exposed Late Uruk cultural layers in the lower trench consist of small- scale architecture, rooms formed of thin walls with stone foundations, and open courtyards used for domestic activities. In the upper trench, three more building layers of EB IB date with subrectangular rooms with thick walls and circular hearths were found. The still incomplete Late Uruk to EB IB sequence now covers seven layers in the lower trench and five layers in the upper trench. The material culture is characterized by plain simple ware and reserved slip pottery. High stemmed bowls comparable to Karkamish material and cyma cups seem to be most characteristic in the upper trench. Toward the end of the sequence, near the end of EB I, necked jars on pedestals make their first ap- pearance. Animal husbandry changed toward the end of EB I, when sheep and goat decline against an increasing number of pigs. A new trench was opened on the west slope of the conical mound on the very top of Zeytinli Bahge Hoyuk. Here, a typical EB III/IV assemblage - with metallic ware, triangular lug handled jars, and gob- lets - was found. This might point to the existence of an EB acropolis, which later served as the base for the still enigmatic monument that formed the conical mound.39 Tilbes Hoyiik. Jesus Gil Fuensanta of the Uni- versity of Alicante very kindly provided the follow- ing report on the 2000 season: Tilbes Hoyiik, in the Birecik Dam rescue area, was the focus of an international salvage project on five adjoining sites on the Urfa bank of the Euph- rates (Firat) River, north of Birecik. Tilbes, Apam- ea acropole/modern Tilmusa, and Tilobur were flooded by the reservoir of the Birecik Dam in the late spring and early summer of 2000. The project focuses on fourth and third millennia, although remains of Middle Bronze and Achaemenid/Late Iron Age date are also of interest. Among the most interesting finds from LC Tilbes Hoyiik are fragments of a bulla and a numerical to- ken. The iconography of the bulla and the token suggest connections to other sites in the vicinity, such as Hacmebi (the bulla fragment) or as far away asjebel Aruda, Uruk/Warka, or Susa. Remains of at least six buildings with Proto-Ubaid and Late Ubaid pottery, flint, obsidian, and basalt artifacts were found near Tilbes, partly covered by the dam wa- ters. This early flooding prevented us from finish- 39 For a report on the 1999 season, see Frangipane and Bucak 2001.</page><page sequence="13">2003] ARCHAEOLOGY IN TURKEY 83 ing some of the planned investigations, mostly the excavation of the so-called Large Building of late EB/early MB in square A2/A6, thought to be a pub- lic building, and implying some central role for the site in late pre-Classical times. This assumption is based on the fine quality craft products in the build- ing and its monumentality. The remaining time was used to collect additional pottery, among which were some EB sherds with traces of cuneiform inscrip- tion indicating volume capacities. Tilvez Hoyiik. Jesus Gil Fuensanta from the Uni- versity of Alicante reports: Tilvez Hoyiik in the Birecik Dam rescue area sur- vived flooding by the dam, but is now under threat because of its proximity to a new concrete factory, the construction of which destroyed much of the EB strata and the excavated trenches on northwest side of the mound. Some EB IV sherds, complete pots, tombs, and an interesting relief fragment were rescued. Kazane Hoyiik. Investigations at Kazane Hoyiik on the Harran Plain, under the direction of Patricia Wattenmaker, concentrated on the development of the lower town during the EB to MB transition. In area A, on the highest part of the lower town, the entrance of a courtyard house was exposed. Anoth- er trench (area B), located close to the city wall, revealed an outdoor space in the upper phase, and four separate building structures in the lower phase. These houses were built close to each other, shar- ing common walls and common drainage. It seems that the lower town at the end of the third millenni- um B.C. was both smaller and denser than it had been during the mid third millennium, and that the lower town was partly abandoned but still kept its urban status during the early MB. Giricano. Andreas Schachner of Munich Univer- sity kindly supplied the following report: Rescue excavations were carried out at Giricano under the auspices of the Ilisu Dam Salvage Project in cooperation with Diyarbakir Museum. The site lies about 0.3 km north of the Tigris, 11 km south- east of Bismil, and is threatened by the construc- tion of the Ilisu Dam.40 The site was chosen for investigation because of its strategic position, controlling a crossing of the Ti- gris. This medium-sized site (ca. 170 x 120 x 25 m) will also provide an interesting contrast to the enor- mous site of Ziyaret Tepe on the opposite bank of the Tigris. The site is situated on a low natural hill overlooking the Tigris flood plain. The aim of the 2000 season was to investigate the stratigraphic se- quence and establish the nature of the main occu- pation periods. One large and five smaller trench- es were excavated. Three main periods of occupa- tion were investigated dating to the Late Bronze/ Early Iron Age, Middle Bronze Age, and Chalcolith- ic. There was also an earlier Chalcolithic occupa- tion, shown by the traces of an earlier mound at the bottom of one trench and the presence of painted Chalcolithic pottery on the surface of the mound that may date to the Halaf period. To investigate the Chalcolithic period, a test trench was dug on the southern side of the site, which produced well-preserved architectural re- mains of a large regularly planned building. Paint- ed pottery and a clay bulla, impressed with a stamp seal, were found on an external floor surface. The pottery, as well as some of the small finds from this area, have parallels in the Gawra B period (Early Uruk) in northern Iraq.41 Since no Late Chalcolith- ic pottery, such as beveled rim bowls, was found at Giricano, it seems that the settlement was aban- doned before the Late Uruk period. There were no third-millennium B.C. finds on the surface of the site or the trenches so far excavated. Excavations of Middle Bronze Age occupation revealed large well-preserved mudbrick walls from three major consecutive buildings (Buildings A- C) on the north slope of the mound. They were separated from the earlier levels by a short gap. The later building closely followed the plan of the old- er one. The close relationship between these ar- chitectural levels is also seen in the pottery, which was nearly identical in all three buildings. Beside typical northeastern Syrian forms and wares there were also sherds resembling east Anatolian forms. In the latest building, Building C, a possible Khabur ware painted sherd was found with red-brown washed ware, the most distinctive ware found in the three buildings, which has parallels at north- ern Mesopotamian sites such as Tell Brak and Tell al-Rimah. A clay model of a house (fig. 4) and a hemispherical stamp seal with a rosette motif were recovered from the debris of the buildings. The important later finds at the site are discussed below. Surtepe. Jesus Gil Fuensanta from the Universi- ty of Alicante kindly provided this information on the 2000 season: 40 For details on historical geography of the surrounding area see Radner and Schachner 2001. 41 Gut 1995.</page><page sequence="14">84 ALAN M. GREAVES AND BARBARA HELWING [AJA107 At Surtepe, in the Birecik Dam rescue area, exca- vations began in areas that allowed access to the Middle-Chalcolithic/Ubaid, Late Chalcolithic, and Early Bronze period remains with the minimum overburden of later material. This was the case at the southern end and on the northern slope of the mound. Several stratigraphic trenches and sound- ings were opened to determine the depth of these remains. In addition, areas that had been eroded or quarried for mudbrick material by local villagers were cleaned to produce stratigraphic sequences. Surtepe was first occupied in the Halaf period, at least on the northern side of the mound. On the south side, thick deposits of the Early Bronze Age and late fourth millennium (Uruk) overlay a meter- thick erosion level covering Ubaid levels. The ma- terial can be compared to nearby Tilbes. Surtepe yielded a long sequence of fourth-millennium B.C. Late Chalcolithic levels with monumental architec- ture and large samples of ceramics. Large wall foun- dations with several rebuilding phases were uncov- ered in the southern trenches, associated with Late Chalcolithic material, most of which was classic southern Uruk. A remarkable find was the fragment of a terracotta model (fig. 5) originally depicting several buildings, including a ziggurat. The model was made of fine ware and is associated with Late Uruk material. According to our geological research, the river flooded the site sometime during the Late Chal- colithic period. In square B3 we found a well pre- served, probably monumental structure of mud- brick (fig. 6) associated with Late Uruk and Early Bronze Age pottery, the latter including reserved- slip ware. A stack of 60 unbaked mudbricks was found at the foot of the mudbrick platform. When they were opened, we found Early Bronze sherds inside. The platform was at least 10 m high and its function remains unknown. Another comparable structure was observed in earth quarries in the cen- tral area of the site, sector C, but could not be exca- vated. Square Bl on the northwestern slope of Surtepe yielded typical EB 1 reserved slip and cyma recta profiles. Oylum Hoyiik. Here work by Engin Ozgen and the author (BH) concentrated in three major ar- eas: the step trench on the eastern slope, the Chal- colithic soundings on the western terrace, and in two new trenches on the southern slope. In the northeastern step trench, work on the Middle Bronze Age layers was finally completed, reaching the surface of the EB mound. It became apparent that this surface was left open for some- time before the area was resettled in the later MB period, and that the chamber tombs of the EB grave- Fig. 4. Giricano: model of a house. (Courtesy of Andreas Schachner) yard must still have been visible on the surface be- cause the line of MB walls respect the tombs. One more chamber tomb was opened; it contained the disarticulated skeletons of at least eight individu- als but no grave goods. Between the tombs, struc- tures of small pebble stones and areas with mud- brick pavement were observed which might have belonged to burial cult installations. Walls of huge basalt slabs forming a large building unit with small domestic rooms were only encountered in the northern extension of the step trench. The lowermost step of the trench revealed two layers of houses, both partly destroyed by slope ero- sion. The uppermost building had a carefully plas- tered white floor and a central hearth with a bev- eled rim bowl imbedded in the center of the hearth. The building had been swept clean before being abandoned. Below, another building level follow- ing roughly the same layout had a full range of Late Uruk related shapes, made from a distinctly local chaff-tempered clay. A new sounding was sunk into the western ter- race. Below a deep layer of recently disturbed soil, we came directly upon the interface of the LC 2 and LC 1 layers, the latter forming a slope surface. Three pithos burials were apparently dug in from the LC 2 layer. The LC 1 layer had two superim- posed layers of fragmentary architecture, richly sup- plied with domestic installations such as a sherd- paved platform, a hearth, and a mudbrick box. Excavations on the southern slope began im- mediately above the modern village. Below recent houses, a late Roman-Byzantine graveyard formed the uppermost level. The next level is formed by a house of unknown date, dug into the slope and cutting the LB layers and further dis- turbance was caused by two silos and several pits. Despite this poor preservation, two rooms of LB</page><page sequence="15">2003] ARCHAEOLOGY IN TURKEY 85 Fig. 5. Surtepe: terracotta model of a ziggurat. (Courtesy of Jesus di Fuensanta) date were traced, both forming long, narrow units, one of which included a stamped bulla.42 Musliimantepe. Musliimantepe on the northern bank of the Dicle River is yet another site that will be flooded by the Ihsu Dam. Its earliest occupation goes back to the Late Uruk period, as shown by sur- face finds. Excavations conducted by Eyyiib Ay from Kinkkale University also found Early Bronze Age graves. Pottery finds included "metallic style" and Nineveh 5 types.43 §araga Hoyiik. §araga Hoyiik, excavated by M.K. Sertok and F. Kulakoglu, is situated south of the highway between Gaziantep and §anhurfa, 8-10 km north of Karkamish in the Karkamish Dam zone. Here, on the west bank of the Euphrates, a 6 m deep layer of alluvium has been deposited since the construction of the mound. In the 2000 season, excavations were centered on the northeast and northern sides of the mound. A step trench on the western side was also excavated as was an extramural burial ground, 800 m away to the west of the mound. The gener- al stratigraphy of the site stretches from the Late Uruk to the Medieval period. Excavation of the Uruk layers was made difficult by the raised wa- ter table that covers them. Some Late Uruk pot- tery was recovered including beveled rim bowls and spout fragments, but no other Uruk remains could be reached. For the Early Bronze Age, three architectural phases could be identified. The first sits directly on top of the Uruk levels. Here simple jar burials were found. The pottery of this period is fine and was made on the fast-wheel. Types include "metal- lic-ware" pottery and Hama goblets, although very few fruit stand fragments were found. In the extramural cemetery to the west, two graves were excavated. The finds here resemble those of the graves in the Birecik Dam area and date to the same period - the first quarter of the third millen- nium B.C. High-footed fruit stands and three piec- es of reserved-slip pottery were found. Middle Bronze Age remains were found in three trenches opened across a 100 m area. Here food storage vessels were found and were pre- sumed to be the remains of depots from a public building. Three phases of the building were identified, and the building had an outer wall. In a later phase these pithoi, which had combed decoration, were reused for burials. Associated with the first phase of the building was a grave that contained early Babylonian late phase pot- tery and a seal impression that resembled types of the Kiiltepe/Kanesh lb period. There were at least six phases to the Late Bronze Age at the site. Two distinct building groups were identified - the northern and the southern. On the south side was a temple, measuring 10 x 8 m and with three phases. It was the presence of a cult room in the third phase that led to its identification as a sanctuary building. In the cult room there were niches in the walls, an altar on the west side, and a platform on the south side. The final phase this room was filled in and the building was subdivided by a north-south wall. The north building complex consisted of two buildings that were leveled and rebuilt on two or three separate occasions, yet there is no evidence of any destruction by fire. Finds include pottery, tripod jars, and a Mittani seal impression. The ce- ramic repertoire includes Khabur ware and Nuzi pottery. No early Iron Age level can be identified, and in the next level is a third-century B.C. Achae- menid pottery kiln and building. On the west side, a step trench was dug and here Medieval remains were found at the highest level, beneath which was a Middle Bronze Age layer in- cluding graves. Beneath these was a natural ash lay- er, then a layer of pebbles, and then a layer of sand.44 42 A report on the 1998-1999 season is available (Ozgen et al.2001). 43 A report on the 1999 season is available (Ay 2001). 44 A report on the 1999 season is out (Sertok and Kulakoglu 2001).</page><page sequence="16">86 ALAN M. GREAVES AND BARBARA HELWING [AJA107 Fig. 6. Surtepe: monumental mudbrick structure. (Courtesy of Jesus di Fuensanta) Ziyaret Tepe. The fourth season of archaeologi- cal work at Ziyaret Tepe was directed by Tim Mat- ney, who kindly provided this information: Excavation in 2000 was limited to five areas (op- erations A through E). Four were on the High Mound (A, B, C, and E) and the fifth (D) was locat- ed in the Lower Town on the site of a potential Assyrian gate or tower structure previously identi- fied through geophysical survey. Operation E on the eastern edge of the High Mound recovered the best stratigraphic sequence, while the best archi- tectural discoveries were in operations A and D. In operation A were architectural remains of the Late Iron Age (Late Assyrian) period. The remains of a large mudbrick building were recovered im- mediately below the surface. There was also an ex- tensive baked brick pavement measuring 11 x 5 m and associated massive mudbrick walls, 2-5 m in thickness. The plan of this building is difficult to assess because of extensive damage caused by refuse pits. Those few diagnostics recovered in primary context were consistent with a date in the Late Iron Age on stylistic grounds. It is clear that this is part of a monumental Neo-Assyrian public building. With only a paved courtyard, two surrounding walls and small portions of two rooms recovered it is im- possible to assign any particular functional desig- nation to this building, which overlooked the Low- er Town. There is no evidence of a destruction lay- er in the building and the paucity of in situ finds argues for a gradual abandonment. In operation D an area of 500 m2 was opened at the eastern limit of the Lower Town. Here was found a monumental mudbrick structure overlaying a deposit of gray soil, approximately 10 cm thick, which ran across the whole of operation D and ef- fectively divided the stratigraphy into two phases. Below the gray soil was an earlier cultural horizon marked by a white plastered floor abutting a lower, thin mudbrick wall with an associated suprafloor deposit rich in cultural deposits - bone, pottery, charcoal, and worked flint. Underneath the white plastered floor was a layer of brown earth and a cob- bled surface with an associated pit cut into natural. This possibly represents a small settlement in the Lower Town prior to the expansion and fortifica- tion of Ziyaret Tepe. The ceramics are possibly Ninevite 5, early third millennium B.C. In the north- ern sector of operation D a massive mudbrick struc- ture made of bricks of a standard size, 37 cm2 x 1 1 cm thick, was found. This was probably part of the city gate. In the western portion of operation D were clear living surfaces associated with a mudbrick structure of at least two small rooms, 4 x 6 m in size, which were possibly part of a tower of a gatehouse. Finally, the discovery of an intact pottery kiln, mea- suring 2.6 m across x 1.4 m high, in the northern- most corner is important. The kiln was identified as a strong magnetic anomaly during gradiometry survey and clearly lay outside the fortified city. Reports on the 1999 season have now been published.45 Arslantepe-Malatya.

Andreas Miiller-Karpe provided the fol- lowing information on the 2000 excavations at Ku§akh (ancient Sarissa): The eighth season of excavations at Ku§akh-Sa- rissa saw the completion of excavations of Build- ing C on the acropolis; uncovering a new monu- mental building, Building E, on the north side of the acropolis; and confirming the results of geo- physics surveys. 45Matney 2001a, 2001b; Matney and Bauer 2000.</page><page sequence="17">2003] ARCHAEOLOGY IN TURKEY 87 Excavation in Building C concentrated on find- ing the Hittite floor level of rooms 60-62. Beneath a clay floor, an earlier floor which had the lower part of pithoi embedded in it was found. In one pithos hole in room 62 were three bullae with string holes in the end and seal impressions on the flat sides, each with a different personal name in hi- eroglyphics. On the older floor were found pottery sherds, a silver earring, bronze arrowheads, and a bronze spearhead. This evidence, together with a crack in the bedrock in room 60 and repairs to walls in room 22a, suggest a destruction caused by an earthquake. The final destruction was a sack and fire in the Middle Hittite period. Building E was first identified as a geomagnetic anomaly in 1997. It was a long, rectangular struc- ture, 12 m wide x 42 m long, in the same orienta- tion as Building C. In 1995, geophysical survey at the southern tip of the city identified a D-shaped anomaly immediate- ly behind the city wall, which has now proved to be a grain silo. This is estimated to have had a capacity of 1200 m3, enough for 720 tons of grain, which is sufficient for 3,942 people for one year. Built around a tumulus on the summit of the acropolis was a ring of Iron Age defenses. This ring was 70 m across, with semicircular bastions on the angles, paralleled at Zincirli. This was destroyed by fire, but how this happened must remain an open question.46 Kelenderis. Nearby this Classical site, re- searched by Levent Zoroglu, on the south coast of Turkey opposite Cyprus is a 600 m long sea cave filled with stalagmites and stalactites and with a re- mote entrance high on a cliff. Here Chalcolithic and Early Bronze Age pottery of Beycesultan type was found. Gre Virike. A. Tuba Okse of Hacettepe Univer- sity kindly provides the following information on the ongoing salvage excavations at Gre Virike (fig. 7) in the Karkamish Dam salvage area: Gre Virike lies 15 km south of Birecik, in §anliur- fa province on a gravel terrace on the eastern bank of the Euphrates. Excavations have been in progress since 1999 as part of the Karkamish Dam Salvage Project as a result of the surveys carried out in 1989.47 During the 1999-2000 seasons,48 a mudbrick paved area, stone structures, graves of different types, and a terrace in the southwestern area have been un- covered across a 1266 m2 area (fig. 8). The mudbrick pavement, measuring ca. 50 x 35 m, is oriented in a north-northeast to south-south- west direction. In order to construct this pavement the gravel terrace had been dug down to a depth of 1 m in areas J10 and K7 and to a depth of 3 m in area K9. In the profile of a disturbance caused by a bull- dozer in area G8, it could be seen that the pave- ment was preserved to a height of 1 .5-2 m, with large basalt blocks utilized in its foundation. The pave- ment had been adapted in the steep southern and western slopes and was supported by stone walls. A series of rooms, with stone-built walls, uncov- ered on the top of the mound was shown to have seven levels. A series of rooms found in area J-K8 and K9 consisted of small rooms, inside which plas- tered pot settings were found. The largest room in area K8 had been used as a kitchen. Two rooms in area K9 had been attached to a chamber tomb. Some single-roomed structures relate to the cemetery's late phase. Plastered rectangular depressions of varying depths within the mudbrick pavement oc- cur in area K-L10 and in the northern part of area K9. The plastered sides in area K9 are preserved to a height of 1.5 m. A rectangular, chamber tomb that had been built inside the mudbrick pavement in area K9 was archi- tecturally aligned with the room-series and the pave- ment itself (fig. 9). The main room is 2.3 x 3.7 m and the passage leading to the front room to its east had been closed with a limestone slab. The lime- stone walls are 1.2 m thick and are preserved to heights of between 1.7 and 1.9 m. The bones of one adult, one infant, and parts of sacrificed animals have been found, although badly decomposed be- cause of the effect of the limestone. Inside the tomb, 76 ceramic vessels, a copper/bronze spearhead, and needles dating from the EB 3 have been found. In a circular grave built of limestone and areaJ9, three infants had been buried. From this grave, 32 ceramic vessels, a bell shaped like a bird, a bath trough, two toy ox-cart wheels, copper/bronze nee- dles, and some beads of agate dating to the EB 3-4 have been recovered. Above the floor of an oven in area K, a mudbrick cist grave, in which an infant and then later an adult had been buried, was uncovered. In this grave, evi- dence of gold-leaf ornamentation is attested. In area K9 a disturbed cist grave built of thick limestone slabs was found, disturbing the northern wall of the chamber tomb. 46Muller-Karpe2001. 47Algaze 1991:186, 232, 236, fig. 25b, no. 82, fig. 29; Al- gaze et al. 1994 :185, 54-5, fig. 8, no. 69, fig. 16A-B, fig. 18; Okse 1999. 48 Okse 2001; Okse and Bucak 2001; Uysal 2001.</page><page sequence="18">88 ALAN M. GREAVES AND BARBARA HELWING [AJA107 Fig. 7. Gre Virike: general plan, 1999-2000. (Courtesy of A.T. Okse) Pithos burials of infants have been found in areas J-K9. Five small ceramic vessels and a copper-bronze needle of EB 3-4 date have been found around the mouth of a pithos burial, which had been set up at the southern wall of the chamber tomb. On the southwestern slope of the mound, two stepped terraces have been uncovered. The upper step was built after the gravel terrace had been dug down to a depth of 1.5 m. A basalt structure on the upper step in areas G7- 8 was disturbed by a bulldoz- er. The basalt blocks in the foundation of the lime- stone wall supporting the upper terrace from the south are connected to the basalt wall supporting the lower terrace in area F6. The basalt wall is 1.2 m thick and 1.5 m in height, and a series of rooms built of limestone are situated along its southern edge. The mudbrick pavement and the stone struc- tures seem to have been built for non-domestic purposes. The grandiose architectural edifices that had been built in such a narrow space display to greater extends the important role of Gre Virike with regards to mortuary practices and commemo- rative ceremonies in the latter half of the third mil- lennium B.C.49 49 Okse 2001; Okse and Bucak 2001; Uysal 2001.</page><page sequence="19">2003] ARCHAEOLOGY IN TURKEY 89 Fig. 8.

Yildirim, and L Ediz, began following the discovery here of a Hittite relief vase. In the large (26 x 16 m) Building 1, a marked difference in elevation between the different rooms was observed with rooms 1 and 2 being almost a meter deeper than rooms 4 and 5. The architec- ture of Building 1 rarely survives above a single course of stones, although room 4 can be identi- fied as a courtyard for cult activity. The limits of Building 2 were traced and it is also dated to the Old Hittite period. The neighboring Building 3 shared a connecting wall with Building 2 and had a rectangular courtyard. Building 4 had 10 rooms of varying sizes all centered around a cen- tral courtyard. One of these rooms was a depot, which contained Old Hittite pottery. A 3 m wide passage connected Building 3 to Building 4. In this passage two ovens were found. The foundations of Building 6 have also been found. It is now possible to say something about the gen- eral plan at Hiiseyindede, which consisted of a sa- cred building (Building 1) with domestic houses around it. In general the pottery assemblage resem- bles that of Bogazkoy, Alaca Hoyiik, Inandiktepe, Ali§ar, and Eski Yapar.50 Kulliioba. This site, in the Seyitgazi district of Eski§ehir province, covers a 250 x 150 m tell that stands 10 m above the level of the plain. Excava- tions by Turan Efe were centered in the western trench, where six levels have been identified down to the natural subsoil. Level 6 is Chalcolithic, levels 5, 4, and 3 are EB transitional, and level 2 and 1 are Early Bronze Age. A new EB pottery assemblage re- sembles the "Yukan Sakarya" group. On the eastern side of the mound, there was an upper and a lower town with a zigzag defensive ar- rangement and rectangular houses fronting onto a street. The east gate of the upper city had two tow- ers flanking the gate, behind which was a large open courtyard. On the western side, a large complex was un- covered. This was probably a princely residence. In the middle of the complex was a large megaron with attached megaron-like rooms, and 18 m away was another EB2-style megaron. On top of the mega- ron was an EB3 building with four phases. The EB2 pottery at the site was local and was white with painted red decoration. Bowls with looped handles are typical. The figurines found were incised with lines and dots on the head to represent hair. At the end of the EB2 pottery forms include tankards, but after this period, these are 50Yildinm and Sipahi 2001; Yildirim 2000.</page><page sequence="20">90 ALAN M.

In this year, excavations by Aliye Oz- tan took place between the sankaya and hatipler ar- eas of the site and focused on a burnt level beneath the Assyrian colony period level. A northwest- southeast wall previously had been found here, and further work in 2000 showed this to be a road. The road itself was made of broken pottery sherds. On both sides of the road were houses with stone foun- dations. Excavations on the west side of the road uncovered two buildings of trapezoidal plan. Un- der the floor were three infants buried in the fetal position. A second level that included houses was found beneath the road; this area clearly had not previously been used as a road. The second level had two phases. In the upper level were five north- west-southeast oriented rectangular buildings. Timbers had been used in the mudbrick construc- tion. To the east was an adult burial in an earth-cut grave, buried in the fetal position. The third level was burnt. Finds from an upper floor that had collapsed were found high in the stratigraphy, not found in situ on the floor. It is not clear if these finds belong to the second or third level. Rooms four, six, and eight were excavated and a rock crystal bead was found. In room four, the re- mains of a burnt fallen roof and burnt wooden beams were found. In the west corner of room eight was a platform. In room three a wooden door was found and between rooms one and three were steps.52 Ikiztepe. Following its excavation between 1975 and 1986, the necropolis at Iziktepe is now the sub- ject of a new research project under the direction of Onder Bilgi. The new project, which will run for three years, will aim to establish the limits of the cemetery and conduct socioanthropological re- search on the human remains. Excavations in 2000 centered on a new trench, area M, at the center of the mound. Here, 14 new Fig. 9. Gre Virike: chamber tomb in Area K9. (Courtesy of AT.

Finds included stamp seals, whetstones, a female figurine, a schematic figurine, worked bone, a crescent shaped loom weight, and six spindle whorls. Anthropological research on the human remains of 25 individuals revealed pathology in the form of head injuries, a female skeleton with a leg deformi- ty and a jawbone that showed evidence of malnutri- tion. In addition to adult skeletons were the re- mains of a one-year-old child and a six-month term fetus.53 Kiiltepe-Kanesh. Excavations of the Assyrian trad- ing colony by Tahsin Ozgiig continued with the dis- covery of many rich finds among the mudbrick buildings and graves of the Lower Town.

Stone artifacts include a fragment of the nose and eye of a beautifully carved bull in black serpentine and a complete serpen- tine frog. Metal artifacts include three bronze bowls, a bronze dagger, gold pins, and a gold ring with a rosette inset with seven petals of lapis lazuli. One cylinder seal and four stamps seals were found and are yet further evidence of the role that this site played as a center of trade.54 Kaman-Kalehoyuk. Kamam-Kalehoyuk is on the old highway between Ankara and Kayseri. Research objectives for the 2000 season included stratigraph- ic study of the north trench, where excavations un- der the direction of S. Omura have been ongoing since 1994, and work on the Assyrian trade colony period of the site. In level 3B an Old Hittite period circular build- ing that appears to have been a food depot has been found. This contained a very thick ash layer, in which were found 15th- and early 14th-century B.C. bul- lae. In a second 15 m diameter building, with plas- tered walls 3 m high, a rhyton and an arrowhead, but very few bullae, were found. Room 288 was a rectangular building beside these two circular build- ings that together formed a building complex at the center of the Kamam-Kalehoyuk site. This room cuts into the earlier Assyrian trade colony period levels. Its walls survive to a height of 2 m with plaster covering the walls up to 3 cm thick. A stamp seal in the shape of an animal foot was found here. In level 3C, the Assyrian trade colony period set- tlement was destroyed by a fire, the cause of which is unclear. In this level human skeletons were found in some rooms, with bronze weapons beside the graves that parallel examples from Kultepe Karum IB. In one building complex, numerous skeletons were found in the rooms and courtyard. Anthropo- logical research has shown that a distinction can be made between those people buried in the court- yard and those in the rooms of the building. In level 4, the Early Bronze Age, five sublevels have been distinguished. In sublevels 1 to 4 hand- made and wheelmade pottery paralleling Ali§ar types is found, whereas in level 5 there is only hand- made pottery.55 Bogazkoy. Excavation continued here under the direction of Jiirgen Seeher. Continuing work on the grain silos, reported in the last newsletter, un- covered a 1.5 m thick layer of burning with radio- carbon dates from the 16th century B.C. New inves- tigations were begun on the highest part of the city, the west plateau. Here aerial photography and geo- physical prospection had revealed a number of very large sub-rectangular anomalies. Excavation re- vealed these to be four reservoirs - two large ones parallel to one another (nos. 4 and 3) and two small- er ones to the south (nos. 2 and 1 - the South Pool). The South Pool was 7-8 m in depth, considerably deeper than the norm for pools at Bogazkoy, which are generally only 2-3 m deep. The South Pool was probably originally as large as the longer pools 3 and 4, but was foreshortened by the construction of an earthen dam with a retain- ing wall of stone. A huge quantity of pottery was found dumped in this pool. This included 30 "spin- dle bottle" jars, libation rhytons in the form of hands and relief vase fragments depicting crowns, and a winged sphinx. This deposit is probably cultic; it is possible that this pottery was brought up from one of the city's many temples and dumped in this pool. Pollen and radiocarbon samples were taken. It is hoped that these will help determine whether this cult function was a later reuse of this pool, or was its original, intended purpose.56 Alaca Hoyiik. Excavations in the northeast cor- ner of the site, behind the Mavi Saray, continued under the direction of Aykut Qinaroglu. Beneath a layer that included Phrygian pottery, a 3.75 m high burnt wall with stone foundations and a mudbrick superstructure was found. This wall had wooden courses in the mudbrick and was part of an east-west oriented trapezoidal room. Near this, to the south was a smaller room. Here were found a stamp seal, a ring, and some bronze pins. The pot- tery, which is Old Hittite in date, included frag- ments of gargara spouts, a small conical bowl with a pierced bottom, and part of a bull's head rhyton. A reappraisal of the "Royal" tombs at Alacahoyuk also has been published recently.57 Ortakoy-Sapinuva. In 2000, excavations by Aygiil and Mustafa Suel concentrated on three main areas. In 1999 and 2000, excavations were carried out on the northern defensive wall. A 100 m long stretch of casemate wall with two towers has now been un- covered. Unlike other Hittite casemate walls, how- ever, the boxes in the wall do not appear to have been filled in with rubble, but instead seem to have been used for domestic purposes.

South of this length of wall was an 8 m wide gate, south of which were two walls, diverging at a 40° angle. This is clearly a city wall resembling that of the Bogazkoy King's Gate area. The second area to be researched was the so- called Agil onu ("the place in front of the sheep fold"). The naturally uneven ground here had been leveled with clay over an area of 25,000 m2. On the east, west, and south sides of this area the ground slopes away steeply. Dr. Siiel believes that to the north side of this flat area there was once a monu- mental building. Working in the eastern area, a gat- ed entrance was found from which a road extends to the northeast before turning 40° west to the en- trance of Building 1 . This building had three rooms and an entrance on its south side. Foundations built of broken stones survived to a height of 70 cm. The walls built on top of these foundations were of mud- brick, and the exterior wall was skimmed with clay. This clay skim is not a recognized Hittite building technique and is known only at Ortakoy. This local architectural style was used for both monumental and other buildings. There was only one phase to this building, inside which a saddle quern and hearth were found. The finds included very fine plates, pitchers, seals, and fruit stands. In area C a monumental building with 2 m thick walls of cyclopean masonry surviving two courses high was found. The building covered an area of 26 x 16 m, but full details of its plan are not yet available. Finds included conical pitchers, finely made plates and bowls, single handled cups, two handled double spouted jars, and a rhyton. Small finds included spindle whorls, a quern, a metal pin, and a hieroglyph seal impression. Black Sea Project. The ambitious Black Sea project, initiated by R. Ballard and F. Hiebert, has not yet revealed any Bronze Age or earlier occupa- tion below the modern coastline. However, the land survey by O. Doonan of the University of Pennsylva- nia identified 173 new sites in a 10 km wide strip of land running from the summit of the Pontus Moun- tains to the harbor of Sinop. One of these is a lithic site that predates the flooding of the Black Sea. In another part of the project, a stratigraphic cut through the land that divides Sinop harbor into two bays was dug in order to understand the history of the harbor. Here a sequence of cultural layers down to the Bronze Age was documented.58 Western and Coastal Anatolia Gokceada (Yenibademli Hoyiik). Halime Huryil- maz kindly provided the following information and illustrations: In the 2000 season excavations followed on from those in 1999 in trench G10, in the west of which Early Bronze Age levels had been found. This con- firmed that two long northwest-southeast oriented walls in the first architectural level formed part of a rectangular building, measuring 11 x 4 m. Such rectangular buildings are typical of the Early Bronze Age in western Anatolia and the Aegean. A similar example had been found previously to the east of the mound in trench H10 in 1998. Troy I pottery was excavated from the floor of the rectangular building. The second architectural layer yielded fragments of walls and an example of a north Aegean type of pyxis with lid (fig. 10) resembling examples from Troy and Yortan cemetery. Remains of a large (12 m) rectangular building were found in the third architectural level. Finds from this level included kitchen wares, bone, and a terracotta figurine. Another northwest-southeast oriented building, with a hearth in the southwest corner, was found in level 4. Terracotta figurines of a human, a bull, and various animals were found in front of the hearth. The rich inventory for this level also included a bowl with zigzag decoration (fig. 11), jugs, stone idols, and axes.59 Archaeobotanical research identified beans, bar- ley, and vetch with wheat being the most important crop. Paleogeographic research in the Buyukdere valley has shown that this area was originally a bay that began to silt up from the start of the Holocene.60 Troy (Troia). Manfred Korfmann (Tubingen University) kindly provided the following infor- mation on the latest developments from the 2000 season: The identification of Troy (Troia) with the (W)Ilios of Homer and the Wilusa of the Hittites is becoming more widely accepted in scholarly cir- cles as the result of the archaeological discoveries at the site. Following 13 years of intensive excava- tions, work at Troy is now starting to wind down. Much work was carried out on material in the exca- vation house and restoration work was carried out on Gate FL, Megaron IIA, Gate FO, and the adja- cent Troy II citadel wall, the western part of the Troy VI citadel wall, and the spring cave. 58 A report on the 1998-1999 activities is available (Doonan etal. 2001). 59 On the 1999 season excavations, see Huryilmaz 2001. 60 On the 1999 season geoarchaeology survey, see Oner 2001.</page><page sequence="23">2003] ARCHAEOLOGY IN TURKEY 93 Fig. 10.

(Courtesy of Halime Huryilmaz) On the citadel, quadrant G6 and Gate FO were re-excavated, prior to restoration work, and the gate was found to have three construction phases. The citadel wall here represents the best-preserved re- mains of the "burnt city" and in places still stands up to 4 m in height and has three bastions. In front of the first bastion a 0.3 x 0.4 m drainage culvert was found. It was also shown that in the construction of the wall a thin "equalizing layer" of clay was used between the stone foundations and the mudbrick superstructure and that small irregular apertures showed where stabilizing timbers had been built into the wall. The Troy VT period megaron VIA was excavated with the intention of finding faunal evidence for the introduction of horses prior to the "Troian High Culture" (Troy IV) period. A mudbrick building with several phases, two rooms, and in situ finds on the floor were found; unfortunately, no horse bones were found. Gate VTV was also investigated and two stelae lining the inner front of the citadel wall were found. A ramp and small forecourt suggests that the nearby building VIA was used as a passage or reception building and consequently megaron VIB must have been used in cult observances to which the population of the Lower City were admitted. More stelae (and seven pithoi) were also found in gate VTU (Troy Vila period) and are now becoming a familiar feature of "Wilusa." In the Lower City, remains of a Troy V house in quadrant X7, which although poorly preserved could be seen to have two floors and two superimposed ovens, show that the settlement extended further to the west in this period than was previously thought. The excavation here of the Troy VI stone paving, which was probably a road bed, continued and was found to have been covered with later Troy VII pav- ing and pithos fragments. In quadrant Z8, several pits cut into the rock to the west of the Troy VI cita- del wall were found and excavated. One undisturbed pit contained Troy IV pottery. Re-excavation of the "round bastion" in quadrant A7, previously thought to be of prehistoric date, proved that it was in fact Archaic (sixth century B.C.). In D9, limestone splin- ters from working the bedrock in preparation for the citadel wall show that this wall can only have been built in the Middle Troy VI period at the latest. By the Late Troy VI period the wall had already sus- tained some damage. There is no evidence of archi- tecture outside the citadel wall until the Troy Vllbl phase. The end of the Troy Vllb (VIIb2) period can now be dated, by radiocarbon and Pro togeome trie pottery from D9, to ca. 1000 B.C. Trenches were dug to PI 2 and F26 to confirm the results of geophysical survey that suggested the existence of a north-south negative anomaly in this area. This proved to be a ditch with a sandy fill, including late Troy Vl/Troy Vila pottery, 4 m wide x 1 m deep that appears to have functioned as an anti-chariot "tank-trap" within shooting range of archers on the citadel wall, 100 m to the east. The Spring Cave was situated between this ditch and the Troy VI/VII wall that was on a natural ledge above it.61 Panaztepe.

GREAVES AND BARBARA HELWING [AJA107 concentrating on cleaning work and confirmation of documentation. The site, which is 12 km west of Izmir on the north side of the Bay of Izmir, was orig- inally an island with a small bay to the east of the acropolis and the Middle Bronze Age necropolis to the west. In previous years an important group of graves had been uncovered, 77 in total, with 64 pithos graves and 12 cist graves. There were two important new finds in the 2000 season. Firstly, a wall running northwest- southeast, to the east of the cemetery was discovered. This wall was 1.4-1.6 m wide and survived to a height of between three and five cours- es of stone. This wall probably enclosed the graves to form a sacred enclosure or temenos. The second important discovery was an intact tholos tomb, located near the temenos wall. This tomb was 1.12 m deep and 2.5 m in diameter, sealed with flat stones and with a short dromos. Inside were nine skeletons with stone beads, lead beads from a necklace, a bronze pin, and a gold ring. Also in the grave were three Mycenaean pots from the LH3A period - two plain and one painted. There was also a bronze sword dated to the 14th-13th century B.C. Panaztepe is therefore the richest and largest grave- yard of this period in the region, combining Anato- lian burial traditions (the pithos graves) with those of the Aegean (the tholos).62 Liman Tepe. In 2000, research at Liman Tepe, under the direction of H. Erkanal and M. Artzy, com- bined excavations in the southern trench with un- derwater investigations. In 1990, an EB2 bastion was found in the south- ern trench at Liman Tepe. It was thought that this bastion flanked a gateway, and the excavations this year were aimed at uncovering the opposing bas- tion and gateway. The layers here proved to be very mixed, however, including Classical, Mycenaean, and Middle Bronze Age material and with a Classi- cal period well cutting through the earlier peri- ods. A ramp constructed of wide, flat stones was found to the east of the existing tower and dates to the EB3 period. A team from Haifa University began research into the underwater remains of the harbor mole in the sea below Liman Tepe. They used a total station to carry out an underwater topographic survey and a suction system to lift silt from the stones.63 Miletos. A new book has appeared on the histo- ry of Miletos, which addresses some of the histori- cal issues regarding the Bronze Age settlement of the site. Also in print is the report on the final sea- son of survey work in the Khora (territory) of Mile- tos, which has now located many new prehistoric findspots in the area.64 Torbali-Bademgedigi Hdyugii. Recip Meric con- tinued his investigations on the north, east, and south sections of this Bronze Age hilltop site. The line of a road, terraced into the slope with a wall on one side, was traced leading up the hill to the for- tress. The defensive wall survives to a height of two or three courses, with larger stones being used to- ward the bottom. Finds included Mycenaean LHII- IC and Middle Bronze Age pottery, from an earlier layer, as well as two finely knapped stone arrowheads. Latmos. Above the high pass between Alinda and the Euromos Plain (860 m asl), a Hittite hieroglyph- ic inscription was found under the overhang of a very prominent crag. The inscription measures 12 x 2.6 m and looks west toward Latmos. The text cannot yet be understood, but it is clear that it is not a continuous text but instead consists of a cartou- che and six images.65 For the prehistoric finds from the survey, see above. Yassikaya. This site was subject to a single four- week rescue excavation by Turan Efe of Istanbul University to preempt ongoing looting. It is situat- ed on the steep and densely forested southern slope of a spur near Eregli Cave, close to the Black Sea coast. Two soundings were made on the pla- teau. This is a very unusual location for a settle- ment, being in such a steep area between rock nee- dles. Here collapsed fallen rock had sealed materi- al beneath it including fragments of mudbrick and burnt pottery pieces in the upper layer. Grindstones indicate that domestic activities took place at the site. The ceramics included red-slipped hand- made pottery with plastic ridges and incisions in the shape of line bundles and zigzags, which can be compared with that of Kocakaya, 40 km away, and with Kocaeli in the Paphlagonia Survey. Relations between the Marmara area, the Iznik group, and Sozopol in Bulgaria can also be traced. Cavlum Kdyii. Excavations of the Middle Bronze Age cemetery at Qavlum Koy, 18 km east of Eski§e- hir, continued under the direction of N. Bilgen. In 62 On the 1999 season, see A. Erkanal 2001.

In this new area the graves were found to be less dense- ly packed than those found in previous seasons, although preservation conditions were good. The standard form of burial was inhumation in a pithos, covered with a stone and with grave goods laid out- side the pithos. Finds included trefoil jugs, toggle pins, and beads.66 Isparta-Harmanoren Mezarlik. Here Mehmet 6z- sait excavated pithos graves and double pithos graves containing hocker burials. In some cases the burial pithos was covered by second pithos or by stones. Finds include EB-MB toggle pins and typi- cal EB pitchers. IRON AGE Eastern Anatolia Anzaf Kale si. The site of Anzaf Kalesi is 1 1 km northeast of Van and has been the subject of exca- vations by O. Belli and A. Ceylan. Dr. Belli very kindly provided the following information on excavations in 2000: Research focused on the pithos depot rooms to the northwest of the Temple of Haldi. These are on a broad terrace and the rooms are numbered I to V, from west to east. The rectangular depot room I contained 14 pithoi for oil and wine, measured 5 x 10 m, and was built of mudbrick with clay floors and blue painted walls. Here an ivory hairpin was found, showing influence from Skythian art. Between depot rooms I and II were a 1.6 m thick mudbrick wall and a 1.6 m wide door. Depot room II was also rectangular and measured 5 x 10. The walls and floor were plastered and painted white and blue. On the east wall of this room were four niches at 1.5 m intervals. In 1999 the mouths of 13 pithoi had been found here, but 16 were found during excavation. Cuneiform writing on the pithoi gives their capacities and contents (oil and wine). Separated from depot room II by a 1.6 m thick wall was depot room III, measuring 6.5 x 10 m. There was a 1.5 m wall between this and depot room IV, which measured 5 x 10 m. Depots like these are comparable with those at Cavu§tepe and Karmir- Blur.67 Ayams. Located 35 km north of Van, Ayanis was built by King Rusa II and is now being excavated by A. Cilingiroglu and Z. Derin. It has now been 10 years since excavations began in 1989. Recent work has focused on the magazine depots on the west side. The depot was a cellar level with another floor above it and large stone blocks fell onto the pithoi during its destruction. The second focus of excavation has been the tem- ple of Haldi. The rooms in the temple had floor levels at differing elevations, with rooms 1, 2, and 3 being at a lower level. On the south side of the temple the bedrock slopes away steeply. Thousands of weapons have been found in the temple. Several heaps of shields were also found, with shields mea- suring 0.8-1.05 m. A bronze votive plaque was also found, decorated with five sun motifs. The remains of 20 arrow quivers made of bronze and leather were found with hundreds of arrowheads in them. Mush- room-headed nails of bronze and iron, iron lance heads, and unburnished pottery were also found.68 Van Yoncatepe. Excavated by Oktay Belli, the site of Yoncatepe lies 9 km southeast of Van. The site itself is at an elevation of 2,050 m asl, and to the east Erek Dag rises to 3,200 m above. The commanding position that this site has over the nearby freshwa- ter springs makes it the most important place in the Early Iron Age in eastern Anatolia. On the acropolis, a large depot room, full of in situ pithoi, was excavated. This building had been destroyed by fire. There were a total of 26 pithoi, which appear to have been used for storing liquids. Along the edge of the depot were smaller measur- ing jars. This room was a stone-built cellar, the ground floor above being constructed of mudbrick. The depot measured 12.5 x 5 m. A door was found in one wall but this could not be safely excavated. The excavator believes this to be part of a palace for an early beylik (principality) , with the possibility of many more depots to come. In the necropolis, six chamber tombs and plain graves in soil were excavated. In the burials, the skeletons of dogs are found very carefully laid out in tombs beside the bone of the human occupants. Sometimes these buried dogs are covered with pot- sherds. More than 40 graves with dogs have been found. The chamber tombs appear to be family tombs. This is the first sample of Urartian graves to be studied. The graves are positioned side by side and sometimes 3-story tombs were built. The tombs are made of sandstone with steps leading down into 66Bilgen2001. 67 Belli 1998, 1999; Belli and Ceylan 2000, 2001. 68 Reports on the 1996, 1997, and 1998 seasons have now been published in Turkish (Qilingiroglu and Derin 1998; Ql- ingiroglu and Saglamtimur 1999; Qlingiroglu and Derin 2000) . Articles in English from the Fourth Anatolian Iron Ages Collo- quium include a discussion of the date of the Ayanis castle (Cil- ingiroglu and Salvini 1999) and the potters' marks from the site (Derin 1999) . A synthesis of 10 years of excavations at the site has also now been published (Qlingiroglu and Salvini 2001 ) .</page><page sequence="26">96 ALAN M. GREAVES AND BARBARA HELWING [AJA107 them. The pottery in the graves was found to con- tain food items including wheat, oats, grapes, ap- ples, quince, and other fruits. Of the sample so far, 80% are cremation burials and 20% are inhu- mations. This mixed cremation and inhumation tradition has also been noted in Hakkari, Raragunduz, and Dilkaya. The artifacts found in- clude a considerable number of iron tools. This may be because in the Early Iron Age tin was in short supply, and so iron was used to make all knives, arrowheads, bracelets, etc. Other interest- ing finds include gold earrings, an earring of tin- lead alloy, and a button of "antimon" that resem- bles Caucasian types.69 Giricano. Andreas Schachner provided the fol- lowing report on the Bronze Age- Early Iron Age transition: Apart from graves and later disturbances, no re- mains later than the Early Iron Age were found in the excavation (fig. 12). Immediately beneath the surface a badly preserved level of this period pro- duced examples of the typical handmade and grooved-rim decorated East Anatolian Early Iron Age pottery. Below this level were several pits, a frag- mentary surface, and some ashy lenses; a large part- ly excavated sub-rectangular pit was the main fea- ture of this level. It contained large quantities of Middle Assyrian sherds, which closely resemble those from sites in northern Syria and Iraq, and some local forms. Near the northern edge of this pit among disturbed debris, 15 cuneiform tablets were found in a pot. According to Karen Radner of Munich Universi- ty, the tablets record the commercial activities of a man called Ahuni, son of Kidin-Sin. In five texts he is described as coming from a village called Dun- nu-sa-Uzibi, which may plausibly be identified with Giricano. In two texts Ahuni is identified as com- ing from Tushan, supporting the suggestion, by K.-H. Kessler, that Ziyaret Tepe should be identi- fied with this Assyrian city. Twelve of the 15 texts are dated to the year of the limu Ili-iddina, who is mentioned on the Broken Obelisk, a monument attributed to the Middle Assyrian king Assur-bel- kala (1073-1056 B.C.). As Ili-iddina is the fourth or the fifth limu of Assur-bel-kala's reign, the Giri- cano texts date to 1069 or 1068 B.C. Interestingly, the texts already show many features of the Neo- Assyrian dialect. The fact that the archive contained Fig. 12. Giricano: aerial view. (Courtesy of Andreas Schachner) valid but unredeemed loan documents may sug- gest that Ahuni was prevented from recovering the tablets before the next harvest, perhaps because Assyria lost control of the region to invaders from the north or west. For a report on the Bronze Age and Chalcolithic period remains, see above. Hakkari. Investigations by V. Sevin, A. Ozfirat, and H. Biber uncovered a number of skeletons and pottery in the tomb in a continuation of the work reported last year. The most common type is mono- chrome pottery, sometimes with relief decoration, with some Van Urmia painted pottery and some Khabur wares occurring. Monochrome and poly- chrome rhytons were also found, including bird- shaped examples. Study of the remarkable deco- rated stelae from the site has also continued.70 69 Reports on the 1998 and 1999 seasons have now appeared (Belli and Kavakli 2000, 2001). 70 A report on the 1997-1999 seasons has now been pub- lished (Sevin et al. 2001) and a discussion of the stelae has recently been published by Veli Sevin (2001).</page><page sequence="27">2003] ARCHAEOLOGY IN TURKEY 97 Fig. 13. Kerekenes Dag: plan of east end of the Palace Complex. (Courtesy of Geoff Summers and Francoise Summers) Mezraa Teleilat. Here there is an extensive Late Assyrian layer, including a large building. Unfortu- nately the remains of this building are obscured by the later Achaemenid layer and no finds could be recovered. For the earlier period at the site, see above. Central and Western Anatolia Kerkenes Dag. Geoffrey and Francoise Summers, together with David Stronach and Musa Ozcan, have continued working at this impressive site and pro- vide us with this information: The Iron Age city, probably the Median city of Pteria in Herodotus, was founded here on a gran- ite mountain in ca. 600 B.C. and probably destroyed in 547 B.C. The 2000 campaign continued the re- mote sensing survey of the Iron Age city and the clearing of monumental buildings. A GPS survey of the site was completed, provid- ing 1.4 million readings that can be used to creat a three-dimensional image of the city using com- puter-aided design (CAD) and overlaid aerial pho- tographs. The magnetic gradiometer survey, which will take the next three seasons to complete, has so far revealed large urban blocks of two-roomed buildings with large doors. The sensitivity of this system at this site is such that even single burnt- out posts can be identified. The city had wide streets and regular blocks, with the main street running between the Cappadocia Gate and the East Gate. For the excavations, the clearance of the Cappa- docia (southeastern) Gate was carried out in 1999 and 2000. The gate had a 6.2 m wide entrance pas- sage and three towers. The full height of the slop- ing glacis, constructed in front of the vertical stone wall, was shown to be 5 m. The full height of the original wall may have been as much as 4 or 5 m above this, making for an extremely formidable defense, built entirely of stone with some timber supports or possibly a parapet. Clearance work at the eastern end of the Palace Complex was also completed in 2000 (figs. 13- 14). Here, the glacis supported structure A - a monumental building with thick walls suggesting that it may have had two floors. The glacis suggests that defense of this building was important, and it may have been a command post while the city was being built around it. Structure A was then remod- eled and the glacis was cut to the south side of the neighboring structure B for the construction of a ramp. Two buildings behind structure A were excavat- ed. Structure C had two rooms with more ordinary stone walls than those found in structure A, sug- gesting a single story building. No doors or inter- nal features were identified, but smashed pottery was found on the floor (fig. 15). A small part of structure B was also uncovered, revealing unusual stone walls with steps to support its timber ele- ments. Burnt timbers of oriental beech were found on the floor. Few objects were found during the excava- tions. A bronze socket arrowhead with parallels at Sardis and Gordion almost certainly dates from the presumed destruction date of 547 B.C. In- lays from boxes or furniture were also found, one of them made of ivory inlaid on one side and showing Egyptian influences, revealing more about the sumptuous art of Kerkenes Dag. Pot- tery includes tripod bowls, trefoil mouthed jugs with side spouts, burnished buff ware, a few paint- ed sherds, and incised pottery with parallels at Gordion.</page><page sequence="28">98 ALAN M.
