The model development follows the FTSS's rigorous quality assurance (QA) procedure and uses the manufacture's product data and test facilities extensively. The models are validated at material, component &amp; assembly, full dummy certification and sled test application levels. A detailed modeling methodology is described. The models correlate well with both the component and whole dummy level test results. INTRODUCTION Side impact collisions account for one of the highest fatality rate in all kinds of vehicle crash. Despite an increase in NCAP-type rating programs and the introduction of innovative active and passive vehicle restraint systems, there is no evidence of a reduction in car crash deaths. The regulators around the world are reviewing the need for an updated side impact regulation that could be more effective in addressing the safety needs of the present and future vehicles. The World SID project is a global effort to design new side impact Anthropomorphic Test Devices (ATDs), namely the WorldSID 50th and 5th (representing a 50th percentile male and 5th female), under the International Organization for Standardization (ISO), being considered for a harmonized side impact crash test regulation. The World SID 50th physical dummy has been evaluated by the US OSRP, NHTSA, the European funded APROSYS program and others similar worldwide in its prototype form and production forms against the current 50th percentile male side impact dummies such as DOT- SID, EuroSID-1/2, BioSID in order to compare the bio- fidelity ratings. As a result, the World SID 50th (revised prototype) achieved the best overall dummy rating and also the best single body region ratings for the head, thorax, abdomen and pelvis as shown in Table 1. [1] The World SID 50th new dummy exhibits a more human-like response in a crash event and has the highest bio- fidelity rating of any side impact crash test dummy to- date. Table 1 .

World SID 5th was also developed under the direction of the ISO. WorldSID 5th represents a woman of small stature and a young adolescent and was developed through the European Integrated Project on Advanced Protection Systems project (APROSYS) in consultation with the WorldSID Task Group. Both versions of the World SID dummies will provide the foundation for future common and internationally accepted regulatory test procedures and enable automakers and researchers to improve passenger safety by facilitating the comparison of crash test results worldwide 977</page><page sequence="2">FTSS has been making great efforts on the successful development of virtual (FE) dummies since 1995. The usage of these FE dummy models has been increasing over the years in CAE simulations of crashworthiness analysis and occupant protection. During the design phase of the World SID 5th and 50th dummies, finite element models were used to help determine design parameters and material characteristics. Since then FTSS has developed fully validated models of the World SID 5th and 50th. FE MODEL DEVELOPMENT The FE model development follows a goal that the developed models will perform and give accurate and robust results as close as the physical counterparts do. They were created under FTSS's newly introduced rigorous quality assurance procedure. Before developing these high quality FE dummy models, it was essential to make sure the following data available: • Accurate geometry (CAD) data representing the physical dummy's structural features; • Material models and element formulations representing each physical component; • Mathematical models in the application FE codes for representing integrated relationship defining kinematics of the dummy parts such as joints, sensors, internal/external contacts and grouped rigid bodies. • Reliable dummy certification test data at component and whole dummy assembly levels. The development process can be divided into the following stages: GEOMETRY MODELING The FE mesh was generated from the design CAD data as shown in Fig. 1a and 1b. The final geometry was verified by laser scanning the outside surfaces of the physical dummy (Fig. 2). Fig. 1a. World SID 50th upper torso: physical vs FE model The World SID 50th FE model has a mass of 74.7kg and a total of 135737 elements as shown in Fig. 3. Fig. 1b. World SID 50th lower body: physical vs FE model Fig.2 Geometry confirmation by laser scanning Fig.3 World SID 50th FE model statistics The World SID 5th FE model creation followed a similar procedure as the World SID 50th. The final model has a mass of 54.5kg and a total of 119137 elements as shown in Fig. 4. 978</page><page sequence="3">Fig. 4 World SID 5th dummy model and statistics MATERIAL TESTING AND MODELING The World SID dummies have some unique materials such as Nitinol (Nickel Titanium shape memory alloy) for ribs and Hyperlast Polyurethane Elastomer foams for pelvis and arm flesh. These materials had to be tested and modeled with special cares in addition to other materials of head skin, neck rubber, rib damping and lumbar, etc. As an example, the following describes a standard procedure for material model development for the Hyperlast foam used. 1. Select a proper material model in the application code: in the Hyperlast foam (a highly starain rate dependent material) case, Ogden model was selected [2], The model describes the material behaviors using both quasi-static and dynamic (general visco-elastic) terms. 2. Test samples were made from certified materials. 3. Quasi-static compression and dynamic stress relaxation tests were carried out. (Fig. 5) 4. Obtaining Ogden parameters by curve-fitting the test curve. 5. Obtaining general visco-elastic terms for the Ogden model by curve-fitting the stress relaxation curve. Fig.5 Hyperlast Material testing and modeling MODEL-TO-TEST VALIDATIONS Before a model was released, it had to pass various certification tests. Typical certification tests for the World SID dummies include head drop, neck pendulum impact, full dummy pendulum impact at different locations on the dummy. There are also other non-certification tests and in-house type tests such as sled impact, arm drop and rib drop test. Some of the FE model set-ups for test validations are shown in Fig. 6. These tests can be classified as component level validations and full dummy level validation as explained in details next. Fig.6. World SID model set-ups for test validations COMPONENT LEVEL TEST VALIDATIONS Component level model to test validations were carried out on all certification tests and some special in-house load cases. Certification tests are: Head drop and Neck pendulum impact. In-house test load cases include Arm drop and single rib drop tests. Some typical set-up and validation results are shown in Fig. 7-8.

It was noted that some permanent rib deformations (5- 10mm) existed in these simulations which should be around zero for Nitinol ribs. This reflects the limitation of the material model for the ribs at the time of the World SID 50th version 1.0 release. This has been since overcome by the newly available software development and the new material model is included in the forthcoming FTSS release of version 1.1 of the World SID 50th FE model. NEW DEVELOPMENT IN MATERIAL MODEL New materials are being used from time to time in new product development such as the World SID dummies. FE model creation on these new dummies has to keep up with these new changes in material. A typical example here is the use of Nitinol ribs - a shape memory material. Latest software development such as Lsdyna 971 has new updates for shell elements to accommodate this new material. Fig.9a-b explain the use of the new material model. The use of Nitinol ribs allows the dummy rib to restore to their initial shapes after impact. When the shape memory material model was not available, a kinematic hardening plasticity was used; this usually resulted in some permanent deformations at higher impact velocities as shown in Fig. 9a. By using the new material model (such as MAT 30 for shell elements in Lsdyna 971), the ribs in the World SID 5th FE model performed very similar to the test as shown in Fig. 9b.

Apart from material models, appropriate joint types, stop angles and stiffness load curves were determined by considering design constrains and joint property tests. Full dummy level pendulum tests are typical dummy certification tests detailed in Table 2: Table 2.

FE results in dotted red line and test data are in solid lines in the picture. Fig. 10a Thorax pendulum impact set-up Fig. 10b World SID 50th thorax pendulum impact model- to-test validation The maximum rib deflections were observed around 20ms in all four loading cases with rib deflections correlate very well with the test data. In the pelvis impact load case, the pendulum acceleration was also observed to correlate well with the test data (not shown). FULL DUMMY SLED TEST AND VALIDATION The World SID 50th FE model was finally validated by sled test. (World SID 5th sled test data was not available at the time of the publication of this paper.) The sled tests are not dummy certification tests. However it provides good experimental bases for dummy integrity and robustness tests. The sled test carried out on the World SID 50th dummy was a Wayne State University type test [3]: rigid seat sled impact at 6.7m/s. Fig.11a shows the test picture from high speed video at a time corresponding to 45ms of FE simulation time and the FE dummy model at the same time. Fig.11b shows the internal deformations of FE dummy model at various simulation intervals. 981</page><page sequence="6">Fig. 1 1 a Sled test of World SID 50th : physical vs. model Fig. 11b. FE model simulation: internal deformation Fig.1 1c shows the correlation of rib deflections of the FE dummy with the sled test results. Fig. 1 1c Sled test: model-to-test validation As shown in Fig. 11c, the FE model rib deflections correlate with the test data very well except for the lower abdomen rib, which was complicated by the insertion of an ensolite pad, arm position and arm end deformation. CONCLUSION 1. Advanced World SID 5th and 50th FE models have been developed. The FE models correlated well at different validation levels: material/components, sub- assembly and full dummy level certification tests and sled test. 2. FTSS's FE dummy model development QA procedure was introduced and carried out throughout in the development to guarantee the model quality at satisfactory level. 3. It is believed that the current dummy models are able to predict reasonable and reliable dummy injury criteria and can be used by industry in crashworthiness and safety analysis. REFERENCES 1 .
