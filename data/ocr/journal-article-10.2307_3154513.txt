<plain_text><page sequence="1">THREE CONCEPTIONS OF GOD PROFESSOR HERBERT A. YOUTZ Congregational College of Canada, Montreal, Canada However it came about, and whatever the significance of the fact, man is religious. We are worshiping beings. But it is a common- place of reflective thought that we do not all worship the same God. It is a far cry from the crude, instinctive, inarticulate worship of the savage, to the reverent, deliberate, awe-inspiring self-dedication of the developed man. Mankind does not all worship the same God. Development is here, as everywhere, the law of God's world. And so the central inquiry of every religious study must be: How did the worshiper conceive his God ? What God did he worship ? For whether he names his God Jove, or Jehovah, or Jesus, we appeal from the name which the worshiper gives to his deity, and we ask what his conception of his deity was while he prayed. Everything in his religion will be relative to that conception. For names are quite as apt to conceal our convictions as to reveal them. This principle is apparent when applied to religious history in general. The savage man has a savage God; the cruel man has a cruel God; the effeminate man has an effeminate God; while the good man everywhere lifts up holy hands to a God who rewards goodness. Pursuing our inquiry further, we may make the same generali- zation within the limits of Christian thinking. Christendom does not all worship the same God. We do not all hold the same con- ception of God and of his relation to his universe. The conviction of God is native to our thinking. But the form of our conviction varies with age, education, character, and all that enters into the personal equation. We are developing persons. The units of our thought are for the most part fluid and not fixed. Intelligence is a marvelously complex and ceaselessly unfolding fact, not a self- identical quantity. From boyhood to manhood we outgrow the old, and put on the new. "When I was a child I thought, spoke, and understood as a child; but when I became a man I put away 428</page><page sequence="2">THREE CONCEPTIONS OF GOD 429 childish things." And even when we come to manhood we all see through a glass, darkly, ever straining to get a more perfect glimpse of the God who "wondrously hides himself;" ever getting one-sided glimpses of the Majestic One, and then carrying these cherished, broken gleams of truth down to the world and calling them philosophies of religion! There are three great typical conceptions of God and his relation- ship to the universe which are current in Christian thought today. Corresponding to these three conceptions, there are three typical world- views, or philosophies, or theories of reality. The conception of God and the world which a man embraces will shape all his thinking, will enter into his character and conduct, will give the form to his theology, and content to his doctrine. We are dealing with the nerve of religion-nay, its very throbbing heart-when we consider the conceptions of God which control us. Constructive work in theology today will not offer an eclectic revision of doctrines, but will follow the religious fact back to its source in the vital conception of the supreme fact-God. The theologian's interpretation of the spiritual facts will be largely influenced by his dominant conviction of God's relationship to his world. The three conceptions which I will succes- sively characterize are known as supernaturalism, naturalism, and immanence. I Supernaturalism is the type of philosophy which conceives two distinct realms of reality, which it denominates, respectively, nature and the supernatural. Nature is this common world, the world of fixed causes and effects which God created in the primeval day, and which has been remorselessly grinding on through the centuries, upheld by divine power. It is the world of geology, astronomy, and physics; of this solid earth and its natural vegetation, and its natural creatures. Nature is the world which God brought into being by the creative fiat of Genesis; the familiar world of our com- mon experience, in which we are born, live our life, and die. God in his heaven beneficently administers the government of nature. It would be blasphemy to deny his intimate knowledge of natural processes or to affirm that any part is independent of his will. And yet it is a relatively independent world which God conducts as a</page><page sequence="3">430 THE AMERICAN JOURNAL OF THEOLOGY system, sitting meanwhile on his heavenly throne. His real presence is in heaven. He is present in his universe only in his power to con- trol the immensity of this cosmos and to keep it smoothly working, executing that original plan of the Almighty. For the religious mind the world of nature is indeed a series of parables to conduct our thought to a higher realm, namely, a spiritual. God's goodness and love and care are all symbolized here to the initiated, and we are thus led to reverent thoughts of the Father above. We are even bidden to get a conception of life that enables us to feel that "we cannot drift beyond his love and care.'.' The all-seeing eye follows us whether we flee with the wings of the morning or hide beneath the mountains. But it is, after all, the care of a God who rules in deistic fashion, rules from without, through the medium of secondary causes, hampered in some sense by the irrevocable outworking of world-laws with which he may not interfere. This is supernaturalism-a conception of God not without a real relationship to this world, but ruling from without. God is a "tran- scendent" God, is the theological form of this conception of the divine relationship. "God's in his heaven, all's right with the world," is the song of a religious heart who thus conceives that even in this world-system God's loving superintendency controls. Now, there is something majestic about this conception of God and his relationship to his world. When one reads the Hebrew chronicler's reverent account of the creative days, or follows the Hebrew psalmist's majestic imagery setting forth the glory of God manifested in his works, the religious nature utters a reverent " Amen." The reality and the vividness of the heavens, the world, the sea, and all that is therein, all sheep and oxen and cattle, and all that is on the earth and under the earth-all the works of his hands! It is an awe-inspiring conception of God's relationship to his world. And the appeal is so true to our deepest convictions that our hearts echo those words of the ancient psalmist uttering the instinctive call to worship: "0, come, let us bow down; let us worship before the Lord our Maker. For we are the sheep of his pasture, and the people of his hand." Who can be unmoved by the truth of that heart-cry ? Supernaturalism became the current philosophy of the Christian</page><page sequence="4">THREE CONCEPTIONS OF GOD 431 church. Right down through its history you can trace this conception of God and his world, in the ecclesiastical rites and doctrines. There is a natural order and a spiritual order, a sacred and a secular, a human and a divine. There is a line of cleavage between the natural order and the supernatural order. In his general, impersonal, benefi- cent way, God administers to every man who is woven into the web of history. But to visit a personal heart, God is required to transcend the natural order; and lo, a miracle, a departure from nature! The miracle is the token of God's immediate presence, whether in nature- miracles or in the miraculous conversion of the human heart. The marvelous leaven of Jesus' gospel has accomplished its work for the most part within the conceptual forms which possessed men's minds. It did not pause for a better philosophy, but it eagerly sought to save men from sin to eternal life. Its aim was first of all practical. Jesus' gospel was a fresh revelation of the blessedness of life lived in communion with God. Men eagerly appropriated the gospel of the divine relationship with men, but they conceived of this gospel under the old forms. God in heaven condescends to men on earth. He dwells in heaven; he visits on earth. The natural order-this is God's ordinary, secular handiwork. The supernatural order is where God makes personal revelations to his own; transcending the natural order, transcending men's thoughts and the forms of their daily life, he appears in prodigies and marvels. A "natural revelation "-this only symbolizes the nature of God. A "special revelation "-this is the only token of God's very presence. Nature may set forth a divine meaning: but only the supernatural order attests the divine presence. Permeated by this idea of a dualistic order, men have sought both speculatively and practically to bridge the chasm that separates humanity from divinity. Practically, this effort is exemplified in the gospel of otherworldliness which led multitudes to renounce the world, and in convents and monasteries to sever as far as possible the ties that bound them to the natural world, and, if possible to achieve a fellowship untainted by the world, that should ultimately win them a part in the heavenly life. On the theoretical side the miracle has played a large part in the religious education of the race. It was the necessary unit of thought</page><page sequence="5">432 THE AMERICAN JOURNAL OF THEOLOGY in a world-conception or philosophy by which men construed their convictions of God's relationship to the world. The miracle was the token and proof of divine presence. But it must be kept in mind that the gospel, the religious convic- tion, simply affirmed that the loving God is in very truth related to our world and to our lives. This alone is the indestructible core of the vital religious creed. All else is interpretation, philosophy, theology. How God is related to his universe-this is the problem that men have struggled with. We are related to God-this is the vital heart of all religion. Supernaturalism-that is simply one con- ception of how we are related. Alas for scholarship, that men are ever confounding their explanations with the thing explained. Reli- gion abides; philosophies change. God is related to his world. How ? This theory of God and his world, so picturesque, and withal so adequate to the earlier faiths, passed into the history of the Christian church. It typified and shaped the religious conceptions of centuries of saints. The church became a supernatural organ through which God uttered his authoritative voice. Thus we have the doctrine of Roman Catholicism. The authority of the church is God's author- ity. The sanction of the church makes sacred whatever it elects to sanctify. What crimes against the moral sense have been com- mitted in the name of supernaturalism! For what is the theory of the Romish church but a concrete expression of the supernatural mediated through an organized sacrament to the natural order. God and his supernatural kingdom over all; men in the natural order here below; and between, the church holds the keys of death and of hell. God is far away; the machinery of the church must bridge the dis- tance. Popes and confessional and absolutions grow out of this need. That beautiful, majestically simple conception of the reverent Hebrew which mediated his conviction of the divine relationship has been turned into a ceremonial barrier against which the tide of human protest has dashed and thundered. But we need not go outside the camp of Protestantism to see the fruit of the supernaturalistic philosophy. When Luther nailed his theses to the church door in Wittenberg, when he organized the forces that protested against the scandal of a despiritualized church,</page><page sequence="6">THREE CONCEPTIONS OF GOD 433 his voice was like an echo of the Nazarene teaching us that life is lived in the presence of the Heavenly Father. Like Jesus, Luther called the church back to the religious fact that underlies all theology -God related to his world. He called men back to individual fel- lowship with God. The flame of religion blazed up. Luther's followers protested against this unspiritual supernaturalism, and exposed the unethical concept of communication with an absentee God. Thus Protestantism was founded upon a faith that brings God into the individual heart. But, like that earlier Moses who led the tribes out of bondage only to find the sense-bound people clamoring for a visible God and making for themselves a golden calf, so was Luther, the Moses of the Protestant deliverance, besought. Holy church, the visible, tangible representative of the transcendent God, was renounced in the passion of their religious enthusiasm. But the people were not yet ready for the full conception of a God apprehended by naked faith. They clamored in the mount of God's presence for another outward token that should mediate the supernatural God to the natural world below. And the old philosophy largely prevailed. Supernatural- ism was the regnant conception still. Luther indeed taught that salvation is by faith, and that every man may come to the heart of Jesus Christ and find God. But every prophet's message is beyond the ken of his followers. And when the current of history flowed on, a Holy Book had taken the place of a Holy Church within the com- munion of the mighty Protestant movement. The logic of the Prot- estant programme is not far to seek. Here is the Bible, a veritable word of God; the record of conquering saints of many ages; the record of sin and penitence, of shame and folly; of holy men, of deeds of faith; of God manifesting himself in the lives of these men and women, hearing their prayers-yes, and answering their prayers; the record of religious experiences and religious history. And, most precious of all, here is the picture of Jesus and his marvelous life among men, the record of his gospel of God's love and of human salvation; this is a Holy Book, the Word of God! And to this day we have not out- grown it. We never shall. The richest, most blessed record of God's way with the human life, and the incomparable gospel of Jesus Christ!</page><page sequence="7">434 THE AMERICAN JOURNAL OF THEOLOGY And yet, when with the scholar's conscience and the scholar's insight we interpret the history of the church for the last four hundred years, we cannot conceal from ourselves the fact that the super- naturalistic conception of God's relation to his word has shaped the history of the church and determined our interpretation of the Bible. Here again criticism demands that fact and explanation be discrimi- nated and held apart. Explanation must not be confounded with fact. Truth may be a very different thing from a theory of the truth. It is significant that we have not yet fully outgrown the super- naturalistic philosophy as we read our Bibles. A "supernatural book," an "infallible guide," an "inerrant Scripture "-these are phrases in common use. Mark how men search for the record of supernatural deeds. Note how Christian evidences have been largely synonymous with the record of miracles. See how men read the supernaturalistic view into the simple record; how the Bible itself from a simple, faithful record has been distorted into a volume of infallible "proof-texts," or regarded as of magically uniform texture of truth. Indeed, this is the avowed theory of some schools of theo- logical learning today-supernaturalism as the principle of biblical interpretation. Even in the record of Christ, men will turn hastily the pages that speak of Jesus living divinely the common life of lowly men, and pause with their finger on the page that records how he called Lazarus to life, or made a barren fig-tree wither. Why? Because they seem to see stronger evidence of God's working in these latter passages. Is Christ diviner when he calls to dead Lazarus than when he fathoms human need and loves common men ? Is God nearer to men in death than in life ? Is God in the spectacular and not in the common ? If the world really thought so, it would seek another God! No, we are only in bondage to a theory of interpretation which we have not wholly outgrown. Nature and the supernatural are conceptions that haunt our thinking and warp our vision. The extraordinary, the miraculous, the intermittent, the supernatural-these are the forms under which our philosophy allows us to see God revealing himself. We are all familiar with some of the difficulties that have arisen in the field of Christian theology during these latter days. Science</page><page sequence="8">THREE CONCEPTIONS OF GOD 435 and theology are supposed to clash; higher critics are anathematized. Critical science in general is looked upon askance in many religious circles. There are restlessness and distrust in ecclesiastical work. Scholarship is often regarded as synonymous with skepticism. Schools of learning are said to lead to atheism; and even theological colleges are seats of heresy. There is unrest. This is a transition period in thought. I am concerned here to point out only one fundamental cause of the fer- ment. We are outgrowing our old conceptions of God's relationship to his world. Supernaturalism as a philosophy no longer satisfies thinking men, and we are all engaged in achieving a better philos- ophy, and in adjusting ourselves to the new view of the facts. Scien- tific thinkers have discovered a new world, a larger world, and we are trying to find an explanation to fit the facts. Even in theology some of us can no longer make the facts fit our explanations, and so we are reverently seeking a more adequate theology. Super- naturalism as a theory of God, of the Bible, or of the individual religious life, is being outgrown. We can vociferate, and quote authorities, and invoke the saints against the scientists, and finally, closing our eyes, take refuge in a church or a Bible. But the work of human thought moves on. The religious message that God has for men of our times must harmonize with their deepest convictions of truth. Mystery we must admit; but contradictions-never! The God whom we call men to worship must be seen to be a reasonable God. Religion has not changed. Our message has not changed: God's love and fatherhood; man's childhood and brotherhood; the saviorhood of Jesus Christ! This gospel is as high and as deep and as broad, as convincing and inspiring, as it ever was. But we dare no longer identify our gospel with our theology, our Bible with our theory of the Bible. We must no longer identify facts and explana- tion. Religion is a fact-the most vital, urgent, inspiring fact of human life. And if our supernaturalistic conception of religion must give way, and our supernaturalistic conception of the Bible must change, that does not alter the fact that religion is a vital experience to me, nor does it alter the fact that in Jesus Christ and his gospel I find God, and salvation in a blessed experience of communion with him.</page><page sequence="9">436 THE AMERICAN JOURNAL OF THEOLOGY The whole difficulty here, and the cause of the unrest and con- fusion, lies in the fact that religion has failed to discriminate its vital interests and its legitimate field of inquiry from the interests and fields of other sciences. It has dogmatically presumed to dictate the limits of all other scientific research because of this indiscriminate and unscientific assumption that religion must be identified with one general conception of religion; i. e., supernaturalism. But modem science, in the name of astronomy, geology, physics, chemistry, and other accredited branches, has been discovering and verifying the laws of reality. In many cases these have turned out to be quite other than the uncritical assumptions of other days. Order and law are first principles on which these sciences build. A critical study of history has disturbed the easy confidence with which another age superimposed a supernatural order on the natural at will. A miracle in the sense of external interference with natural laws is so far discredited as to become the starting-point for skepti- cism rather than faith. Our whole modem way of conceiving the world makes it difficult, or logically impossible, to retain the tradi- tional supernaturalistic view. The alternatives are to ignore science or to ignore religion, if religion is identical with the supernaturalistic world-view. This age of natural science does not hesitate to make the choice to the utter confusion of the religious nature. Has the Christian religion no alternative except to ask men to stultify themselves in order to be religious ? Is faith merely a miracle of credulity ? Can we not dissociate the kernel of religion from its husk, and exhibit it as consistent with the vital convictions of our keenest thinkers ? May not religious truth be illumined and not extinguished by our current world-view ? Is there not a better view where the interests of our cognitive natures and of our religious natures will be seen to harmonize ? Such a work as Andrew D. White's Conflict of Science and Theology is not the mere record of a battle, but of a prolonged civil war, pitiful and useless, and demoral- izing. If peace has been declared, the tidings have not yet reached some of the warring factions. Certainly faithful scientists and faith- ful theologians may be permitted to do something to promote the propaganda of peace by emphasizing our common principles, and exposing the mistakes on which the conflict rests.</page><page sequence="10">THREE CONCEPTIONS OF GOD 437 II The dissatisfaction with supernaturalism as a theory of reality has found expression in two reactionary directions, each of which offers the outlines of a philosophical explanation. The first of these explanations is so-called naturalism. It is a form of conception which has crept into our thinking in this age of natural science. It is an explanation that is indigenous to the atmosphere of the scien- tific spirit, and may be characterized as the attempt to impose the natural-science method and the natural-science limitations on all phenomena. Naturalism is the natural-science method aspiring to be the exclusive world-philosophy. It expresses a serious and wide- spread attitude of mind today toward the questions of theism and allied theological problems: naturalism, positivism, or even material- ism, as it is variously called. A modem examination of naturalism' opens with this paragraph: Sir Isaac Newton concludes his famous Principia with a general scholium in which he maintains that the whole diversity of natural things can have arisen from nothing but the ideas and the will of one necessarily existing being who is always and everywhere, God supreme, infinite, omnipotent, omniscient, abso- lutely perfect. A little more than a hundred years later Laplace began to publish his Mechanique celeste, which may be described as an extension of Newton's Principia on Newton's lines, translated into the language of differential calculus. When Laplace went to make a formal presentation of his work to Napoleon, the latter remarked: "M. Laplace, they tell me you have written this large book on the system of the universe and have never even mentioned its Creator." Whereon Laplace drew himself up and answered bluntly: "Sire, I had no need of any such hypothesis." Since that interview another century has almost passed. Sciences that were then in their infancy--such as chemistry, biology, geology, and even psychology-have in the meantime attained imposing proportions. Anyone who might now have the curiosity to compare the treatises of their best- attested exponents with the great work of Laplace would find that work no longer singular in the omission which Napoleon found so remarkable. God is not a necessary hypothesis today in writing science. In naturalistic philosophy God is not a datum, but a hypothesis, if indeed he is not bowed out as superfluous. Modem psychology, pursued by this method, reduces personality to a complex of deli- cately adjusted nerves. The spiritual and personal fade into shadows, and become negligible factors. Naturalism needs neither the hypoth- x Ward's Naturalism and Agnosticism.</page><page sequence="11">438 THE AMERICAN JOURNAL OF THEOLOGY esis of God nor the hypothesis of any person. Given forces and laws and atoms enough, explainers of this type leave nothing to be desired. It all becomes a matter of cause and effect, of description and history. All mysteries yield to the crucible, or the test-tube, or the historic method. God becomes a name we have coined for the unknown, or simply a collective term to designate the logical all. A man reduces to a piece of protoplasm which develops according to a given norm. But his whole pedigree--i. e., his explanation-is writ- ten in the books of the scientist. His total meaning is comprehended in this explanation. There is no need of the hypothesis of person- ality, whether human or divine. "Fact I know, and law I know," wrote Huxley; "but what is this necessity save an empty shadow of my own mind's showing, something illegitimately thrust into the perfectly legitimate conception of law ?" Now, such is the spirit of false naturalism which rises like a cold fog and hovers with a materialistic chill over the laboratories of science. It is a spirit and a view-point not wholly comprehensible to those quietly sheltered in the religious atmosphere of the church. But it is a spirit which in protean shapes enters very largely into the intellectual life of today. Out in the world where men are thinking through the great intellectual problems of our generation the natural- istic current is a mighty factor to reckon with. By contact we have all absorbed something of the scientific spirit; we breathe it as the climate of our age. It is a mood toward life which meets all our intellectual workers as they go out to seek the solution of life's prob- lems. Materialism, sugar-coated, is the theory of the universe which many an educated leader offers. And when the theory works down into the masses, it becomes less scientific, the sugar-coat rubs off the intrinsic doctrine, and it becomes bald atheism. And there is not much inspiration in the creed of atheism in whatever dress. It withers life at its roots and issues in pessimism. Naturalism conceives the world as mechanism, and studies it as a complex of causes working according to definite laws. Its assump- tions are the assumptions of natural science: the reality and finality of force and matter, and the validity and universality of natural laws. Mechanical law is the omnipresent fact. The structure of a molecule is a marvel of organized law; and the worlds of astronomy</page><page sequence="12">THREE CONCEPTIONS OF GOD 439 are poised in space and regulated in their orbits with a nicety of adjustment to law that awes the scholar. All life down to its minut- est details, on analysis, proves to be thus organized-organized in terms of unvarying law. Chemistry and physics and astronomy have opened up an amazing physical world, marvelous in structure, infinite in extent. And the other sciences are swiftly coming into line with the scientific method. The structure of a crystal is no more perfect than the regular structure of the world itself, and all of its parts. Biology, zooilogy, botany, and even psychology and the social sciences, are organizing their data in conformity to this ruling conception, law. Life in all its extent is an expression of law, and can be comprehended in terms of law. The scientist finds his fascinating task made to his hand: to approach this orderly cosmos at some point, and within the limit of his own particular science to experiment and tabulate and formulate the cosmic laws. He is a discoverer and a describer. In this universal reign of law he makes one little kingdom his own by right of discovery and conquest. But in this splendid task, legitimate naturalism is in danger of a metamorphosis into false naturalism. Forgetting that he is a dis- coverer, and awed by the magnitudes with which he deals-the magni- tudes of law and force and matter-the scientist is likely to proclaim these discoveries as the limits of knowledge itself. Rather, he hypos- tatizes these magnitudes into self-sufficient quantities; and law and force-mere descriptive names for what he observes-harden into metaphysical realities. His forces are generalized into the Eternal Energy; and somehow the capital letter has turned description into metaphysics. And law itself becomes an independent entity carrying its own power to act. Now, the false naturalist has all the para- phernalia for constructing a world. He conjures with forces and laws in this illegitimate sense, and lo, a self-running cosmos, a system, a universe! And he need call in no other fact. Natural science has issued its manifesto of independence. Explanation can go no far- ther. "Fact I know, and force I know," he says with Huxley; and, with Huxley, he intimates the superfluity of any further explanation. With Laplace he says: "I have no need of any hypothesis of a God. My laws and forces-are they not sufficient forces and powers ?"</page><page sequence="13">440 THE AMERICAN JOURNAL OF THEOLOGY And, thus led on by the exigencies of his method, the mechanical ideal becomes the all-sufficient hypothesis for accounting for a universe. And when "development," and "evolution," and "natural selection," and other abstract terms are admitted as dynamic entities at conveni- ent places in the system, this form of naturalism is indifferent as between the claims of atheism and theism. Indeed, atheism would seem to be the more scientific hypothesis, according to the law of parsimony. Thus the fallacy of abstraction has done its perfect work. Science is falsely erected into a virtual argument against theism, and, in the atmosphere of mechanical science, all spiritual quantities, and the religious convictions and experiences by which men and nations live, are felt to be unable to meet the familiar tests of truth. Thus it is that the student-spirit, breathing this atmosphere of naturalism, goes out to feel a sense of distrust of religion; a sense of unreality in prayer; a sense of insecurity in the domain of personal and ethical values; because the world of his study has a self-sufficiency of its own without the assumption of a God. Thus confusion over- spreads his religious life; and often the most cherished sentiments and convictions of life take wings and vanish, because they are felt to be alien to the scientific spirit. But naturalism as a philosophy is not intentional atheism, any more than it is the intentional denial of the reality of self. I am con- sidering it here rather because it is a form of conception of God and of his relationship to the world. Natural scientists are not godless. They are performing an inestimable service for the world. More- over, science serves a ministry to reverence and religion. It is an aspect of truth which bulks large in our thought-life today. But it is the misapplication of the methods of science which issues in the phi- losophy of naturalism. It is the misconception of science which issues in skepticism. As a description of the orderly method of the world, science in all its branches is doing invaluable service. But when that method hardens into an ultimate explanation, and pur- ports to be a philosophy of life-to give the final and total conception of reality-it loses its way and perverts its end. After science has accurately described and classified its remotest data, the task of explanation is incomplete. Total experience has not been fathomed.</page><page sequence="14">THREE CONCEPTIONS OF GOD 441 The rational nature of a man will still demand that the facts described be construed in terms of the ideals of intelligence. Construe this omnipresent fact of causality: What is the power that works ? What is the ultimate nature of law ? What is the ultimate nature of these units with which science works ? Until these queries are answered, the mind is not satisfied. It is here that a conception of God and his world comes into view. And when a descriptive method chal- lenges the interpreting powers of intelligence, and denies that we can know aught of God or his world save to rehearse the processes of history and experience-this is method gone mad. Thus scien- tific method that has lost its way issues in the naturalistic philosophy. The world becomes a mere mechanism; God is the "Unknowable," the "First Principle," the "All," or an "unnecessary hypothesis." And our relationship with him can be reckoned only in terms of sequences of necessary causes and effects. There is little room for personal values. The truest account of the moral and religious life is a catalogue of the moral and religious phenomena. In the lan- guage of the physical laboratory, the verities of religious experience are no longer "Facts," and even God is a "Hypothesis." Such theorists, I repeat, are not primarily irreligious; they are only slaves to a method. But that method, misdirected, becomes a false method; and it reacts with serious consequences in a thousand ways upon thought and life. For even if the religious nature faithfully asserts itself in the face of this disconcerting mood, and calls back its God, he is likely to be placed in some unreal realm of pale spirits, or on a distant throne. Meanwhile we are environed by the great reality-Mechanism! I am confident that students of philosophy and theology will recog- nize the reality of this type of thinking which I have thus briefly characterized. As a world-view it has some eminent representatives, whose systems are already self-refuted. But as a mood, a spirit in religious interpretation, it is far-reaching in its effects upon the stu- dent-mind, and must be reckoned with by the theologian who would do constructive work. Can this view of the world prevail ? In a word, no; because it theorizes for the scientific mood and not for a man as a man. I am much more than one of my interests. This view is too narrow and barren in its psychological analysis, and it is too limited in its method</page><page sequence="15">442 THE AMERICAN JOURNAL OF THEOLOGY of inquiry. The content and realities of life are far richer than the naturalistic method allows; and the tests of reality and truth are far more complex than its formulas allow. Life is much more than the scientific interest. I am a man. And the life which I explain by my philosophy must be as many-sided as personality. Laws and forces and causes and motion-these are indeed facts. But so are prayers, consecrations, sacrifices, purposes, and character. So are worship and holiness and love. So all personal values are facts in terms of which I live my life. And the theory of reality which neglects these facts is doomed by default. I must find an interpretation of life which satisfies me, and brings life and explanation into accord. Naturalism, then, fails to satisfy the religious demand. Mechani- cal relationships, as the final terms of our thinking emasculate life of all higher meanings, and thus contradict the great catholic convic- tions of the race, and stultify the practical controlling ideals of life. This is its condemnation as a practical philosophy. Moreover, the place of God in such a world-scheme is so remote or so doubtful that religion can live only by a desperate act of "faith" which is either meaningless or a contradiction of the naturalistic philosophy. In its most religious estate it could offer only Deism as the solution of God's relationship to the world. But Deism has long ago been cast out as a philosophic outlaw. It fails to comprehend the real problem involved. God as "a First Cause," a sort of omnipotent Reserve Power, an "Unknowable" prodigy, who has sublet the universe to secondary causes in a mechanical system, is a puerile attempt to satisfy the imagination. It not only fails to satisfy the religious need for the presence of a living God, but, worse still, it offers no account to the rational nature of the present causal fact. Mechanism itself as dynamic cause is the real problem, and not what we may imagine behind it. How to construe the causal relation of God to his world is precisely the problem. To posit God behind this mechanism is equivalent to positing x behind it. For religious thinking it would seem that naturalism is a more barren and inade- quate theory than supernaturalism; for in effect it denies the possi- bility of a personal relationship with God, which supernaturalism provides for by the device of miraculous departure from the natural. The theologian today is thus caught between two conflicting cur-</page><page sequence="16">THREE CONCEPTIONS OF GOD 443 rents of thought. Supernaturalism is largely the bent of the churches and the creeds. Naturalism is at least the implicit philosophy of the scientific world about us. Both forces are significant, but both philosophies are confused and largely self-contradictory. Amid these two currents of thought the theologian must sail a course which promises to reach the haven of truth. These are difficult days for the theologian. A vital philosophy of life must underlie all vital theology. Shall he pour the wine of his convictions into the old bottles, in default of a better containing-vessel ? Will no successor of Immanuel Kant arise to achieve for us a theory of knowledge which will dispel our confusion and give us some solid foundation principles on which religion and science may alike build their structure, in mutual respect and confidence ? For the end must be harmony and symmetry and consistency of building, if both together are to consti- tute the temple of Truth. Thus scientific thought cancels the pretensions of supernatural- ism. But the demands of life and religion easily expose the barren- ness and inadequacy of naturalism. How shall we conceive of God and his relationship to us in terms that shall preserve the truth of both naturalism and supernaturalism, and yet more adequately illumine and construe the facts? For both types of thought contain abiding truth. Law, development, the orderly working of the uni- verse-this supreme element of truth in science we must hold as a fundamental principle. The value of the scientific emphasis on law is incalculable, and its consequences for ethical and religious mean- ings are only beginning to be seen. A moral world must be a world of consistency and law. A lawless world would be both irrational and immoral. On the other hand, personal relationships, eternal values, volitional- determinations, cosmic meanings-these are the abiding elements in supernaturalism. Can we see the outlines of the larger view, where life's methods and life's meanings will not clash? III This leads me to characterize the second reactionary tendency of which I spoke. I believe we are able to forecast the conception within which these aspects of truth must harmonize. In the conception of the world-order as identical with the activity</page><page sequence="17">444 THE AMERICAN JOURNAL OF THEOLOGY of the divine will, we find the emphasis of modern thinking. Reality is but another name for God in action, expressing himself in terms of regular laws. This is the doctrine of the divine immanence. It is the view of the world which transcends the crude, anthropomorphic dualism of supernaturalism, and the equally untenable materialism of naturalism. God and his world are not mutually exclusive terms. He is immanent at every point of his creation. "He is the omni- present ground of all finite existence and activity. The world, alike of finite things and of spirits, is nothing existing and acting on its own account, while God is away in some extra-sidereal region; but it continually depends upon, and is ever upheld by, the ever-living, ever-present, ever-working God." The system of nature is but another name for the order in which God acts, in the unique and inscrutable fact which we call creation. And the laws of nature which the scientist studies, and the orderly procession of cause and effect and of historical unfolding-these are but the human view of the rational forms in which the Supreme Person incessantly works his will. Cosmic processes are all alike evidences of the Immanent Agent at work. In this view we have eliminated the supernaturalistic problem of passing from the supernatural to the natural order. For the natural order is only the familiar form in which the supernatural power works. An unfamiliar phenomenon, however "miraculous" in effect, could be no more supernatural than a familiar phenomenon; for the order and the dynamics of each are equally expressive of the energizing of the one supreme will. On the other hand, naturalism is complemented with the fact without which it can only be a formal or modal philosophy. That is, the abstract notions of cause and law are construed in terms of mind and endued with a real dynamic explanation. Law is an abstraction from the orderly way in which something works. But what is it that works ? "Cause" is a word to express the dynamic problem. But what is cause ? The doctrine of an immanent God provides a meaning for cause, as an immanent agent acting; and interprets law as merely the method of his regular acting. The doctrine of divine immanence is not a new doctrine, but it is finding new formulation and new application in the exigencies of</page><page sequence="18">THREE CONCEPTIONS OF GOD 445 the thought-life of today. Paul's doctrine that God is all and in all is being reinforced from every branch of human inquiry. The historian, the psychologist, the metaphysician, as well as the theo- logian, are finding this conception to be the magic key which fits the riddle of life-the missing element around which all facts and prin- ciples crystallize into harmonious unity. The divine transcendence, on the one hand, baffles the longings of religion and scandalizes the philosopher. On the other hand, the world as mere mechanism is an affront to a man's sense of value and a sterile principle for reason. But if thought can grasp the living God as the-personal Principle who forms the core of reality in the whole mechanical world, organic and inorganic, then law and development become merely the forms of his creative life, and fellowship and fatherhood are consistent with the fact of his immediacy and control. Divine immanence as a philosophic doctrine transcends the dualism of supernaturalism where God visits men or breaks into the order of nature. The ordinary distinction between natural and supernatural is obliterated in this view. Both the active and the formal principle of nature, the law and the force, are simply expressive of the fact of the Eternal Agent realizing himself in the forms that we regard as the natural. In the final sense mechanical nature is as much super- natural as any celestial order could be. That is, the only final fact here is divine action. Creation involves no surplusage over this, no crude "stuff" apart from the orderly incessant action of divine volition. God is all as well as in all. The only point in the cosmic order where this conception of creation does not seem to suffice for thought is in the case of finite personalities with a measure of free- dom or self-determination. But in the case of these personalities the dependence upon the divine activity is just as real and absolute as in the case of things. The doctrine of immanence is in no sense relaxed. Only we must think of the creative act as so conditioning the nature of the created person that he possesses a measure of self- determination which involves real freedom in thought and conduct. This is the distinction between thinghood and selfhood. Finite persons, like things, express the creative act and have no being apart from that act. But persons are in the "image" of God. The "system of nature" thus becomes supernatural, and the super-</page><page sequence="19">446 THE AMERICAN JOURNAL OF THEOLOGY natural, so far as we know it, becomes the natural. More exactly stated, both are equally divine, so far as "divine" calls for the power, purpose, and presence of God. And this is a great gain for consistent thinking, in that the scandal of conflict between science and religion is seen to be baseless. For, verily, "the undivineness of the natural, and the unnaturalness of the divine, is the great heresy of popular thought respecting religion." On the other hand, divine immanence as a philosophic doctrine informs and supplements mechanical explanation. From a descrip- tion of endless being and becoming, it becomes a description of the mode under which a " supreme rational Will forever founds and admin- isters the order of the world." The limitation of the function of natural science to inductive description is recognized. And the rational demand to construe the ultimates of science in terms of the highest ideals of mind must be conceded as a right and necessity. "Law," "force," "cause," "necessity," when seen in their true pro- portions, are not dynamic facts, but only formal descriptions that call for further interpretation. To hypostatize these into self-sufficient entities is the temptation of the naturalistic mood, and is possible only on an inadequate analysis of the general problem of knowledge. The doctrine of immanence' supplies a conception of the active dynamic principle which science describes, but does not construe for the ultimate categories of thought. " Cause," then, from being a mere abstraction to conceal our problem, becomes a name for the omnipresent Will realizing his plan under the forms which science describes as mechan- ism. "Law," becomes, not the name of a power, but a method. And even "force" is seen to be a generalization that leads to no insight. Personality becomes the ultimate conception everywhere; and thus mechanism is transformed into the activity of an omnipresent Will; while natural and supernatural lose their contrast, and express the one fact of men living in the immediate presence of God. And there is no other reality. On this view of causality and law, the philosopher would have no insuperable logical difficulty in admitting the possibility of a miracle. Or, rather, the form of that haunting problem is so transformed that it must be discussed in terms of other conceptions. The incom- mensurability presupposed in the antithesis of natural law and</page><page sequence="20">THREE CONCEPTIONS OF GOD 447 supernatural purpose no longer exists. The natural is not only as divine as the "supernatural," but it must be thought as equally pur- posive. And when law has no other meaning than the orderly mode in which a purposing God chooses to act, there seems to be no a priori ground for affirming that God cannot act in any way he chooses in the interests of his purpose. That is, law can no longer be thought of as one of the dynamic "necessities" with which naive thinking has com- passed the problem of revelation. And, in religious explanation, purpose is confessedly the supreme conception, not mode. As to whether the miracle is a historic fact as well as a logical possibility, that must be left to historic considerations. It is noticeable, how- ever, in discussions even of this phase of the subject, that the con- clusion is likely to be determined according as the personal emphasis of the critic is upon order or upon purpose as the supreme considera- tion in the world-view. " Pure logic " in this field usually reflects the personal convictions of the theorist. The real grounds of the argument are sub-logical, in the personal presuppositions that underlie all logic. On the other hand, the religious theorist, on this view of immanence if the eyes of his understanding were opened, would feel no call for a miracle to aid his faith, for all alike would be equally divine to him. A miraculous event could not be more divine than a common event; since all alike are acts of God, and express both his purpose and his presence. Indeed, the religious thinker would see in the marvel of law a factor to appeal to his sense of awe and worship for a trust- worthy God. But he might conceive a departure from the common order as a worthy pedagogical device chosen by a God for whom purpose is supreme over law, for the instruction of an undeveloped race; or for an age so lost in the ideals of natural science that natural law is a more sacred conception than purposive goodness. But, in general, his faith and his philosophy might be symbolized in the con- ception that affirms: From Horeb's bush the Presence spoke To earlier faiths and simpler folk; But now each bush that sweeps our fence Flames with His awful Immanence. Such, in faintest suggestion, I conceive to be the type of philo- sophic conception which is coming to control men's minds. It is a</page><page sequence="21">448 THE AMERICAN JOURNAL OF THEOLOGY developed form of the idealistic conception of the world. Paul's thought of the present God "in whom we live and move and have our being "-this is finding acceptance as our best metaphysical conception of reality. The heart is leading the intellect-Faith is leading Reason-in the quest for a tenable philosophy. But then it has always been so. We believe what life demands, and then our reason construes our belief. The implications of such a view, and the far-reaching consequences for theology, I cannot even hint at here. But such a conception, thoroughly naturalized in the world of modem thought, would have a transforming power little short of epochal. It would enrich our religious conceptions, and bring a sense of reality in religious acts for which religious preachers and teachers cry out. It would show that religion is to pervade all life, and is not chiefly a matter of churches and of prayers. For who would not feel the call to worship, if he felt that in very fact all life is lived in the divine presence ? Might we not hope that our daily task would be performed and our common life lived with the air of men "who serve in a Temple" ? For the makers of theology, I have already pointed out, the con- ception of God is central. It shapes and points all other doctrines, and determines the appeal of these doctrines for the thinking man. The conception of God as immanent seems to me suited to the temper of our age. It satisfies the rational nature by construing reality in terms of the ultimate conception of intelligenec-personality. Thus I stand before a fact which I cannot resolve, and cannot explain away-God in every fact of life. The scientist, each in his respect- ive field, will have unlimited freedom for his fruitful inquiry. Real- ity does not become less real, nor substance less substantial, nor do the laws of nature grind less remorselessly. The scientist will ques- tion the laws and the facts at every point, and unfold the science of every realm. But his science will be only the description of the way in which the personal, immanent Cause works. And the religious nature is satisfied by the conception of an imma- nent God, for it means that in the mystery of personal fellowship I need not violently abdicate the convictions of scientific cognition. I am always in touch with the Infinite. In working out my own life-plan and in tracing the sequences of history, I must interpret all</page><page sequence="22">THREE CONCEPTIONS OF GOD 449 in terms of this principle of a God who is immanent and active in it all. Fellowship with God is not achieved by some telepathy with heaven, or magical ascension to the holy of holies. God is unspeak- ably near to me at every point of life. I do not ascend into heaven, nor do I summon his spirit to my need; but, resting in the conviction of the eternal presence, I confidently command my own soul, Speak to him thou, for he hears, and Spirit with Spirit can meet, Closer is He than breathing, and nearer than hands or feet. There are two or three points at which the doctrine of the divine immanence is peculiarly liable to misinterpretation and must be guarded. First of these is the ready query: Is not this view pan- theistic in its consequences ? Does it not so identify God and the world that it confuses the sense of responsibility involved in the moral and the rational life ? We point out in reply that this identifi- cation has been clearly and explicitly avoided by two postulations. First, the world as an act of will is no necessary aspect or part of God, as pantheism involves. The world is a free creation. We affirm, not that God and the world are identical, but that God iden- tifies himself with the world in the volitional act of creation. Second, created personalities are given freedom or self-determination as a part of their native endowment. A measure of' independence and of real responsibility is characteristic of the created person. What- ever the difficulties of this view, it is no more opaque than the doc- trine of creationism in general, to which reflective thought shuts us up. Here individual finite freedom obviates the necessitarianism of pantheism, and makes room for finite responsibility. Again, our language may lead some to feel that we have identified es- sential religious relations with cosmic relations that obtain universal- ly. To affirm a theory of reality in which God as the ground of reality is "nearer than hands or feet," must not lead us to ignore the distinction between the good and the bad, the religious and the irreligious. In the ontological sense God may indeed be the One in whom I live and have my being. But this fact does not make me religious. Religion is a distinctly individual act, and depends upon a personal initiative which establishes a new set of relationships between God and me which I can only call personal. These relationships are</page><page sequence="23">450 THE AMERICAN JOURNAL OF THEOLOGY ethical, growing out of my character; and not merely implications of my existence. But even so, some theories of reality administer to the religious fact, while some do not. Some theories of reality are inconsistent with the affirmation of confidence in religion. Psy- chological unity demands consistency among the articles of my belief, if one is not to cancel or confuse the other. All that we claim for the doctrine of immanence is that it is first of all a consistent theory of reality. And, second, in the unity of consciousness, it is not only consistent with, but administers to, religious life, by presenting con- ceptions contributory to both confidence and awe. The vital act of individual communion with God which is the heart of all religion is not affirmed in the doctrine of immanence, but the doctrine is shown to provide for the religious life. It makes the same emphasis that supernaturalism does upon the special nature of the soul's relation- ship to God in the religious act. But, unlike supernaturalism, it does not create an artificial chasm between scientific thought and religion. And, unlike supernaturalism, it does not encourage the intermittency of the religious life so characteristic of the conception which does not see God's presence in all the forms of life. Both immanence and supernaturalism alike make faith necessary to bring God near to the worshiper. But supernaturalism also requires credu- lity; immanence does not. Unity of consciousness is thus provided for. It is perhaps worth noting here that there is a hysterical aver- sion, on the part of a few, against admitting metaphysical considera- tions into religious explanation. This hysteria is rapidly healing. It originally arose as a protest against the scholastic fallacy of iden- tifying metaphysics and religion. But the protest having been once made against this identification, its extravagant form, as exhibited in Ritschl and others, must be abandoned. Modern psychological study, as well as a better analysis of the problem of knowledge, forbids such absolute and mutual exclusion of metaphysics and religion. To those who would characterize the divine immanence as a profoundly "metaphysical" view, and therefore to be eschewed, it is sufficient to indicate that supernaturalism, or any other theory of reality, involves metaphysics. Prejudice and false theory aside, there is an implicit metaphysical view in every theory of reality,</page><page sequence="24">THREE CONCEPTIONS OF GOD 451 including those which explicitly disavow such alliance. As a final word to such theorists we summarize as follows: The intelligent acceptance of the doctrine of the divine immanence is not itself the establishing of the personal religious fact. The essentially religious attitude is always an individual act of the person. "The inner life of religion in the last resort is something secret and incommunicable." But in the unitary life of intelligence this personal act of communion with God, which is the essence of religion, is best construed and best promoted from the standpoint of the man who holds the immanence of God as an ultimate explanation of reality. Remoteness of "natural" relations with God in no way administers to the intimacy of the religious relation. The other conceptions discussed may indeed be held by a truly religious man; though we have endeavored to show that their ministry is not to mental consis- tency and "peace in believing." Religious explanation is not indif- ferent to metaphysics, nor can be in a sound psychological analysis. The practical consequences of the theory of the divine immanence for theological interpretation would be manifold. Not least of these consequences would be the clearer discrimination of the method and field of theological study, the frank recognition of the com- petency and finality of every science in its own limited field, and the disclosure of the unreason of "heresy" trials. Purpose would be- come the controlling conception everywhere, and a frank facing of the evolutionary unfolding of law would transform many a venera- ble doctrine, with the result of giving it a vital meaning now obscured or discredited. The doctrine of sin is a case in point. Both ethics and evolution may justify their conceptions of sin without can- celing each other. And the high meanings of the Christian doctrine of salvation from sin are only enhanced. The doctrine of God ex- pressed in the Christian conception of redemption, and its relation to the non-Christian religions, would be deepened and broadened. The missionary motive will be quickened, as men grasp the purpose of God in all history. History studied in the light of the conviction of an immanent God would take on new lessons, and some of the old lessons would be discredited. "Through the ages one increasing purpose runs." That purpose is not arbitrarily confined to one age or one people. Historical science, from being a mere catalogue,</page><page sequence="25">452 THE AMERICAN JOURNAL OF THEOLOGY becomes an unbroken revelation. Revelation will take on a less technical and more vital meaning. Inspiration will disregard our theological classifications. Bible interpretation will frankly accept the "historic method," without thereby losing one whit of its revela- tion value. And in the unfolding of the religious life of the individual Christian, technical "evidences" and doctrinal "tests" will give place to a vital personal growth in the life of the spirit. The work which Luther began will be completed in the renewed confidence that all life is lived in the divine presence. Religion itself will be increasingly seen to include every phase of life. The "natural" aspects will be seen to have supernatural significance. Systematic work and impul- sive experience, growth by law and the surprises of communion, will be equally religious. In all the normal aspects of life God is equally expressing his one consistent purpose which never falters. Religion which realizes the immanence of God in all the forms of life will seek not so much to locate him in a holy mount, or a holy city, in churches and formal prayers; but will rather worship everywhere in spirit and in truth. The last vestige of other worldliness should disappear for religion as men realize that in the normal and wholesome functions of life in this world, communion with God is completed and the fulness of God's life becomes the confident possession of men. And so our changing philosophies are ever conceiving new heavens and a new earth. We are trying to get better conceptions of God's relationship to us; but of the fact of that relationship our hearts never permit us to doubt. Religion abides, while theologies change. Our little systems have their day, They have their day, and cease to be; They are but broken lights of Thee, And thou, O Lord, art more than they. The supernaturalistic theory of reality is symbolized by the paint- ings of the Middle Ages, where the gods are seated on the clouds, while the earth below is the habitation of men. A scientific age has analyzed the clouds, and the traditional conception of a heaven in the skies, whence angels descend, no longer appeals to the imagination. Naturalism has compelled us to relocate the habitation of God. And in this our best revelation and our best philosophy agree, that wher-</page><page sequence="26">THREE CONCEPTIONS OF GOD 453 ever there is life, there God is. He is immanent in all his works. His habitation is with men. A cross-section of cosmic life would not reveal heterogeneous evidences of God's purposiveness, a natural and a supernatural. But all would equally express him and his purpose. Even a historical incarnation brought him no nearer to life, but only revealed him more adequately. This is the doctrine of the divine immanence; and theology orientated to this truth has an inspiration for our age.</page></plain_text>
