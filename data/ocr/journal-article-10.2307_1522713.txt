Unlike Ju- daism, early Christianity, and Islam, he explains, the Buddhist faith has not condemned the representation of holy beings or living creatures. Nonetheless it believes that its most crucial spiritual insights lie beyond the power of human imagination to describe or depict; the visual arts can allude to them only obliquely, through omission or the use of non-iconic figures. This discrepancy between the practical, ritual functions of the work of art and concepts of ultimate sanctity, Seckel suggests, has affected Bud- dhist arts throughout Asia, particularly those of the Meditation School (Chan, or Zen) in China and Japan. Seckel's analysis begins with an exploration of certain remarkable fea- tures of the oldest surviving examples of Indian Buddhist narrative art. Re- lief carvings at sites such as Bharhut and Sanci, dating to the second and first centuries B.C., seem to depict in minute detail events from the leg- endary life of Sakyamuni, the historic founder of the creed. They do not, however, portray him in human form but indicate his presence in an indi- rect manner, using such symbolic motifs as a tree or throne or footprints. Not until the first century A.D. - a half-millennium after the found- ing of the faith - did images of Sakyamuni and Maitreya, the Buddhist messiah, begin to appear. Thereafter the number of holy beings depicted in art increased dramatically. Paintings and sculptures were seen as indis- pensable tools for instruction, but, paradoxically, Buddhist thinkers con- tinued to believe that the visual arts were incapable of representing such lofty insights of the faith as the Nothingness of Nirvana, which transcends all phenomena. Why was the art of this creed so slow to develop a symbolic language capable of expressing its religious doctrines? How did the initial absence of a Buddha image reflect theological concepts? Under what conditions did the first Buddhist cult images appear? How is the absence of the Bud- dha image in the early sculptures germane to aesthetic principles that governed Buddhist art in other parts of Asia? 7</page><page sequence="6">For more than a century scholars have debated these questions and pro- duced a vast literature (recently reviewed by Yuvraj Krishan and Klemens Karlson). In general, the scholars may be classified as belonging to one or the other of two camps, which may loosely be labeled pragmatic and philo- sophic. The first focuses on artistic practice or religious ritual; the second focuses on metaphysics and doctrine. Using the first approach, for exam- ple, the French archaeologist Alfred Foucher claimed that artisans work- ing in northwest India (the Gandhara region) employed Greco-Roman models to produce the first Buddha images. Foucher's views were chal- lenged on philosophic grounds (as shown below); but scholars who worked largely with his methods, notably J. van Lohuizen-de Leeuw and Takata Osamu, proposed that the first Buddha images arose at Mathura in north- central India and developed from Indian artistic and doctrinal roots. Vidya Dehejia, moreover, believes that the term &lt;&lt;aniconism&gt;&gt; has taken on too much &lt;&lt; baggage &gt;&gt;, and says that early Buddhist art is best approached with- out the distraction of dealing with it. Variants of this approach are held in- dependently by Dieter Schlingloff and Tanaka Kanoko. Also questioning the emphasis upon doctrine and philosophy, a newly published volume ed- ited by Robert and Betsy Sharfplaces primary focus on the veneration and ritual consecration of Japanese Buddhist images. The philosophic approach was strongly advanced by the Anglo-Indian philosopher Ananda Coomaraswamy, who argued that Indian ideology, not foreign influences, was the critical factor in the development of Bud- dhist iconography. Endorsed by such scholars as Heinrich Zimmer, Hein- rich Dumoulin, and Benjamin Rowland, this view holds that the absence of the image of the historical Buddha in the early monuments was due to the concept that his attainment of enlightenment had altered his ontolog- ical character; he had transcended the phenomenal world. Doctrines changed, however, and by the first century A.D. Sakyamuni and his succes- sor Maitreya were considered transient incarnations of an abstract, eternal Buddha principle. Artists could thus represent them in human guise, whereas the higher principles remained beyond human cognition and the power of art. Dietrich Seckel, firmly based in the philosophical camp, emphasizes the central role of metaphysics in the formation of Buddhist iconography. He brings a singular resource to his studies: having lived for many years in Japan and worked with advanced Japanese scholars, he writes from a pan- Asian perspective and has extracted universal features of Buddhist art from its many local forms. Indeed, his 1962 Kunst des Buddhismus, translated into eight languages, remains the classic introduction to the subject. In the present work he analyzes with unprecedented thoroughness and detail the symbolic content of early Indian Buddhist sculpture at sites ranging from 8</page><page sequence="7">Kistna River region in the south to the Gandhara district in the north. Nonetheless, his primary focus is the role played in this imagery by Indian philosophic principles. Citing works of art from throughout Asia, he traces the changes in Buddhist thought in the customary divisions of the faith: Hinayana, Mahayana, State Buddhism, Esoterism, Pure Land, and Zen. He explores the relationship between art and doctrine by citing widely recog- nized concepts embedded in the difficult-to-translate Sanskrit terms such as lokotara ( transcendence ?), sznyatd ( &lt; nothingness,? ? void, &gt; or &lt; relati- vity &gt; ), tathatd (&lt;&lt; thusness &gt;&gt;), and, of course, nirvana (?&lt; cessation,? ? eman- cipation, &gt; &lt; release &gt;) and sambodhi ( &lt;awakening, &gt;&lt; enlightenment ). Previously aniconism had been understood as limited to the initial phase of Buddhism and its art in India. Seckel, however, demonstrates that it has been a fundamental principle reigning continuously at the highest levels of philosophic thought throughout Buddhist history - side by side, or even above, the rich iconography and powerful ritual functions of Bud- dhist art - valid therefore not only &lt; before &gt; but also &lt;&lt; beyond &gt; the image. Though limited to the Buddhist community, with occasional refer- ences to Hinduism, Seckel's discussion is fully compatible with studies of aniconism and its various permuations in other historical contexts. In Ju- daism, for example, it is reflected in the commandment of Moses condemn- ing idolatry. Early Christian art replaced the image of Christ with letters or symbolic motifs such as a shepherd or a fish. Islam has occasionally shown extreme hostility to representational art, religious and secular. The Icono- clastic Controversy was a major event in the history of Byzantium. The Protestant Reformation in northern Europe vigorously rejected Roman Catholic imagery. Working under the influence of Indian thought, twen- tieth-century artists such as Piet Mondrian, Kazimir Malevitch, and Vass- ily Kandinsky produced non-representational, non-figural compositions. (Overviews of the various manifestation of aniconism may be seen in works by Kenneth Clark, Robert Ousterhout, and Alain Besancon). Besancon's book offers apt quotations that find deep resonance in the present study: John Calvin (&lt;&lt;The majesty of God, which is beyond the reach of any eye, must not be dishonored by becoming representation &gt;) and G.W.F. Hegel (&lt;Thought long ago stopped assigning to art the sensible representation of the divine. &gt;) To these can be added Seckel's haunting words: &lt;&lt;... the ultimate goal of Zen art is the No-Longer-Symbol: the empty picture, the &lt;picture&gt; as emptiness, the shapeless shape, the &lt;thundering silence&gt;. &gt; * 9</page><page sequence="8">Dietrich Seckel's essay was originally published in 1976 under the titleJen- seits des Bildes. Anikonische Symbolik in der buddhistischen Kunst in the Ab- handlungen der Heidelberger Akademie der Wissenschaften (Philosophisch-his- torische Klasse). As that series is not easily accessible to art historians, Helmut Brinker and John Rosenfield felt strongly that it should be brought to a wider audience. The translation was made by Andreas Lei- singer, with editorial help from Sylvan Barnet and William Burto and fur- ther editing by Rosenfield and Brinker.

IO</page><page sequence="9">Aniconism in Early Buddhist Art BASIS IN DOCTRINE AND WORSHIP The artistic creation of the Buddha image begins with the non-image - seemingly a paradox, but quite in keeping with the teaching of the en- lightened Buddha who entered into Nirvana at his death. Thus the Sutta- nipata (5.7.8), one of the oldest texts extant in the Pali canon, says of him: He, who [like the sun] has gone to rest, is comparable to nothing whatsoever. The notions through which his essence might be expressed are simply not to be found. All ideas are nothing as bearing upon him; hence all modes of speech are, with re- spect to him, unavailing.I What applies to speech applies equally to visual representation. The Bud- dha stands beyond the outward manifestation of people, gods, and all other living beings because he is transcendent (lokottara), gone beyond the world of phenomena limited to ordinary perception, beyond the circumscribed existence in the cycle of samsara. He is &lt; a being who is a non-being, &gt; &lt;&lt; not being anything definite anymore (dkincannana),&gt;&gt; &lt;&lt;nothing at all.&gt;&gt; 2 There- fore he cannot be seen in his essential nature nor be represented visually; every shape would show him in a non-essential, even falsifying manner, and a personal image would be meaningless. A general prohibition of images, such as in the Old Testament or in Islam, was therefore not necessary in early Buddhism; nor would such a law have said: &lt;Thou shalt not make images&gt;&gt; (Exodus 20, 4) but rather: &lt;Thou canst not/art not able to make images. &gt;&gt; The non-discernible Nirvana nature of the Buddha - his invisi- ble presence - must and can be evoked in other ways: especially by sym- bolic signs which have perceptible shapes but do not attempt to offer a likeness, and which serve as supports for the inner vision of what they ac- tually mean. The nature of the Buddha and of the ultimate truth manifested and revealed by him, as shown by this inner view, is infinitely more real and effective than any ?true? image ever could be. i Zimmer: Kunstform und Yoga, p.

(s.v. Akificafiniyatana). II</page><page sequence="10">To be sure, in later phases of Buddhist teaching, legendary reports of a &lt;&lt;True Image, &gt; a &lt;&lt; First Effigy, &gt;&gt; of the Enlightened One come into being. Certain works are regarded as such, especially the so-called Udayana im- age;3 but until the advent of Sakyamuni's personal, iconic representation - beginning around Ioo A.D. (or somewhat earlier) due to profound changes in doctrine and worship - all Buddhist art in India employs ex- clusively a group of aniconic symbols. These allude to the person of the Buddha and represent the decisive events and localities of the creed, such as his enlightenment under the Bodhi tree. This use ofaniconic symbols, however, appears in even more developed stages of the faith, for as far as we know the oldest form of Buddhism - from the time of its founder (563-483 B.C.; new dates: ca. 450-370) until the first significant monuments around the second century B.C. - makes vir- tually no attempt to represent its doctrine in artistic form. After all, early Buddhism has meditative methods, fixed on goals beyond perception and imagery, to gain the highest knowledge. At first, the ascetic word-renun- ciation by the community of monks plays an important role. Compared with these radical means, the use of visual symbols for what is ultimately imperceptible and ungraspable is already a kind of concession to the reli- gious needs of the lay followers. It is called an &lt;&lt;aid to salvation &gt; (upaya- kausalya) - ?a skillful method &gt;&gt; leading to higher knowledge, a stepping stone towards (ever) more pure spheres of abstract spiritual insight.4 Bud- dhists, and especially followers of Zen, have upheld his attitude towards the religious image to the present day (as we discuss below). Even in the early phase of the personal iconic representation of the Buddha (at such sites as Mathura and Amaravati), monks rarely appear as human figures, on the other hand they are quite frequently so depicted in Gandhara. After all, the Buddha was initially taken only as the messenger of an insight he consid- ered as true and liberating, but not as the holy being receiving religious adoration at the center of a cult. To talk about a prohibition of images in India is wrong also because it is erroneous to think that Buddhism turned consciously against an already flourishing religious imagery for dogmatic reasons, or for the sake of world- denying asceticism, or that it had to defend itself against such imagery. Op- position to image-friendly cults was unnecessary because they hardly ex- isted among India's higher creeds; Buddhism tolerated such tendencies on a popular level. For Buddhism, there was thus neither danger of idolatry nor temptation towards iconoclasm. A highly explosive alternative, such as we find in Jewish, Christian, and Islamic religious history, was not an 3 See note 59. 4 Zimmer: Art of Indian Asia, vol. I, p. 232. 12</page><page sequence="11">issue for Buddhism. Contemporary Brahmanism had no images of deities in the sense of central cult figures; the first images of that kind came into being at about the same time and in a similar religious development as the first Buddhist images. Brahmanical cults engaged in sacrificial ceremonies, using a highly developed language of symbols, an iconography without icons. &gt;&gt;5 &lt;&lt;This predilection for symbols was taken over by Buddhism. ?6 Thus it is hardly surprising that a number of symbols used in earliest Bud- dhism - and partly in later Buddhism as well - appear on coins minted be- fore and during the Kushan dynasty: the tree (with or without railing), the wheel or the sun disk (sometimes on top of a column), svastika, triszla (a kind of trident), as well as the lotus flower. But it is fairly safe to say that these symbols did not have specifically Buddhist meanings at the time - if indeed they were meant to have a religious meaning on the coins.7 They were part of the general Indian repertoire, used as such and adapted by Buddhism as well as by other religions (e.g. Jainism). This is made quite clear by the fact that the stupa, the Buddhist symbol par excellence, seems to be absent from early coins. Thus the many-spoked wheel of the famous Sarnath lion capital - most likely to be interpreted as cosmic pillar or axis of the world - was primarily meant as a symbol of the sun and by exten- sion as a symbol of the ruler, and only in second place as the Buddhist wheel of the Doctrine.8 On the other hand, religious images in human shape did exist in India during the centuries before Christ, even if they were not cult images of deities in the highest and strictest sense. Early Brahmanical texts mention images of Nagas (serpent gods), and there is evidence for the concept of &lt;&lt; image &gt; in the use of such words as pratimd, pratikrti, and murti.9 Inscrip- tions prove that cult buildings with sculptures existed; Yaksa figures may well have an old tradition, even if extant works date back only to ca. Ioo B.C.; numerous archaic terra-cotta figures dating from the fourth to second centuries B.C. are probably to be interpreted as mother goddesses. All this seems to have been on the level of more popular, folk piety, where much of it remains to this day. But it is also safe to assume that the prototypes of Hindu images and Jaina representations were also created somewhat ear- lier than the Buddha image in Mathura, although the tidal wave of sys- 5 Coomaraswamy: Origin of the Buddha Image, p. 7. 6 Plaeschke: Buddhistische Kunst, p. 69. 7 Coomaraswamy: History of Indian and Indonesian Art, p. 48 f. and ill. 30; Notes on In- dian Coins and Symbols, p.

Foucher (The Be- ginnings of Buddhist Art) interpreted these symbols as specifically Buddhist. 8 Przyluski: Symbolisme du Pilier de Sarndth; Irwin: &lt;Asokan&gt; Pillars; Rowland: Art and Architecture, p. 40. 9 Coomaraswamy: Origin of the Buddha Image, p. 4. I3</page><page sequence="12">tematic creation of personal-iconic images (i.e. official cult images, en- gulfing all three religions evenly and at the same time) reached its apex slightly later, after Christ's birth and then especially from the late first to the third century A.D.'? Before that period we encounter deities such as In- dra, Brahma, Sirya in fully developed form in narrative relief carvings on early Buddhist monuments (such as Bharhut and Sanci), although the Bud- dha is still shown by means of strictly aniconic symbols in these represen- tations. This phenomenon can hardly be explained as the result (or the con- comitant) of the general absence of images of early Indian religious art; surely it must have its own reasons, most likely to be found in the doctrine of the Buddha nature mentioned in the beginning of this chapter.

SYMBOLS IN SCENES OF THE LIFE OF THE BUDDHA Mostly one has been content to say that in the earliest times the Buddha was represented not as a person, but aniconically by this or that symbol. This paper is an attempt to analyze such representations somewhat more closely and to ask what function the symbols serve, what precise meaning they carry, and what variants can be distinguished. If the aniconic representation of the Buddha is based on the concept of him as one who has been completely removed from the world of phenom- ena by his entry into Nirvana and therefore cannot be perceived by the senses, it may come as a surprise that in biographic scenes he is still repre- sented by means of aniconic symbols, showing his worldly life before the I4</page><page sequence="13">''.I' ` ~~~: i If I It~~?: ~" iJ 4IA (?rJ~- i~i?p C-tI 2 2.

Calcutta, Museum. Nirvana, when he was still living as a human among humans. But his hu- man shape is, after all, the last embodiment of a being destined from the beginning for salvation; i.e. Buddha-hood was intrinsically latent in him since his birth as the son of an Indian prince. This concept of the Buddha interprets him not only as an historic person - as master, preacher, and founder of a monastic community - but also as the manifestation of an other-worldly Buddha-nature (buddhata) beyond time, whose true nature cannot be grasped by means of this-worldly, visual representation. During the time of Asoka (268-239 B.C.) this interpretation led to the assumption that the historic Buddha was preceded by six other Buddhas in earlier ages; these Buddhas, too, are represented only by symbols in the earliest monu- ments such as Sanci (Ill. I). Seen from this perspective, the non-represen- tation of the historic Buddha in biographic scenes, too, is consistent, since all Buddhas appearing in whatever world and age are considered only as per- sonifications or temporary manifestations of that absolute Buddha-nature. In scenes illustrating thejataka stories, accounts of earlier lives of Bud- dha Sakyamuni in which he gradually matures to Buddhahood by the &lt;&lt; ac- cumulation of merits &gt; (according to the doctrine of Karma), he is repre- sented in his earthly manifestations (e.g., deer, tortoise, monkey, as shown below), again quite consistently, for in these previous lives he had not yet I0 For the earliest known Hindu cult figures in bronze, see: Hirtel/Auboyer: Indien und Sudostasien, ill. 41 (from Sonkh near Mathura, second cent.

I5</page><page sequence="14">4. Jataka of Sujita and the dead 4 completely developed the Buddha-nature. The Buddha-nature unfolded in him fully in his last existence during our age, i.e. when - to use Buddhist terminology - he turned from a Bodhisattva (a being destined for enlight- enment) into a Buddha (a fully enlightened being); and up to this moment of enlightenment the texts call him &lt;&lt; the Bodhisattva.? &gt; In the scenes of his previous lives, he appears often as animal sacrificing itself for others or ac- complishing other good deeds: e.g. as a stag (Ill. 2)in the Ruru-Jataka (Nr. 482), or as monkey king (111. 3) in the Mahakapi-Jataka (Nr. 407). He may also be endowed with miraculous characteristics (the golden deer, the ele- phant with six tusks). Most often, however, he appears in some sort of hu- man guise - such as the landlord's young son Sujata (Nr. 352; Ill. 4), or the King Vessantara (Nr. 547) - and in these cases he is shown as a human be- ing like all other humans. Thus, still predestined to Buddhahood, he may be shown in his human form. Once he has attained Buddhahood, however, it is no longer possible to show him as a human being, not even in the phases of his last existence preceding his final release (Nirvana), i.e. dur- ing his earthly historic life. He mut e mu represented by symbols, his pres- ence suggested by signs or hints. Such a symbol is called a avyakta-muirti, a ?pnon-perceptible image,&gt;as a formless form since it includes ?the budo of the essential being. Beyond its evident meaning (e.g. as tree of enlight- ii siva has been attributed avyakta-laksana (invisible characteristics), too; Monier- Williams: Dictionary, p. iii b.

In this respect, all the various symbols con- verge in one meaning. In early works, such as the relief carvings on the railings and gates of the stapas and other holy monuments of Bodhgaya, Bharhut, Sanci (ca. Ioo B.C. to Ioo A.D.), partially also of Amaravati and Nagarjunakonda (ca. 8o A.D. to the third century), it is quite clear that to each phase of the Bud- dha's existence - and thus each level on the way to enlightenment - a specific symbol is assigned, often the only means of identifying the scene. The foremost purpose of early Buddhist art is to illustrate the holy scrip- tures; it is thus a narrative art, and this is precisely what gives it its enchant- ing freshness and vigor. Already one of the first scenes of the biographic cy- cle takes the legend quite literally and shows the miraculous conception, the entrance of the Bodhisattva into the maternal body in the shape of a white elephant, quite as his mother Maya saw it in a dream (e.g. in a pillar medallion at Bharhut [Ill. 5]; in a later relief from Amaravati [Ill. 6], the dream scene is represented somewhat less literally without the elephant). This is an obvious illustrative method, although it must not be forgotten that the elephant, associated with all life-giving forces, is at the same time an old Indian symbol to which the Buddha has a right in his capacity as cakravartin, (spiritual) Ruler of the World. It is therefore hardly surprising that the next important scene, the birth of the Buddha, is represented with a leap into the sphere of purely sym- bolic allusion: often it is shown by the image of a standing or seated female figure (usually thought to be the goddess Laksmi) who is being showered 17</page><page sequence="16">, ~ -i',, .: --.-- -.... - : ~.T",~,~:' .:p-~:, ~,,,,~ "'v ? .' . . . . .....- 7 8 with water by two elephants in accordance with the abhiseka rite (a kind of baptism, initiation, a ritual birth) (Ill. 7). This representation may be enhanced by a water container (kumbha,purnaagata)I2 and lotus plants, or it may be reduced to a container with the lotus only. To be sure, the hypothesis that this group symbolizes the birth of the Bodhisattva has been contested; but these old Indian symbols of fertility and good fortune - the female deity or Mother Goddess, the elephant, the lotus, the vessel of life's bounty, the holy water -may very well represent a holy birth rite. If one refuses to accept the Laksmi-abhiseka group as rep- resenting the birth scene, one has to explain the strange fact that this scene - one of the four great events of the Buddha's life explicitly mentioned in all pertinent texts - is never otherwise shown on the earliest monuments containing all other important events of the Buddha's life. (Incidentally, this is one of the earliest representations of the lotus as the seat of a divine being, as in terracotta figures of the Maurya and Sufga periods [third to first century B.C.]). Buddha on a lotus throne is first seen in the early iconic phase, i.e. after the second century A.D., in Amaravati and Gandhara. The lotus, in fact, is ubiquitous in early Buddhist art: as ornamentation, votive offering in veneration scenes, laid down on the altar-like Buddha throne. Not until a later phase of early Buddhist art, at Amaravati and Nagarju- nakonda (third century), as well as in Gandhara, is the birth scene shown as it is described in the texts (I11. 8): Maya reaches for a tree branch in the Lumbini grove, and at that moment the child issues from her right side and is received by a group of gods. But even here, the child cannot be seen. Its presence is only alluded to in the next scene by the seven footprints (bud- 7.

In early Buddhist art sculptors replaced the regular &lt; his- torical illustration, full of figures, with a completely different, heraldically structured group of symbols beyond history; and in later Buddhist art (ad- mittedly in an exceptional case) the event was shown by aniconic allusion at a time when personal-iconic representation was generally predominant (for the other scenes even in the same monument). This is a phenomenon awaiting further study. In the scenes following the birth, the infant is represented in various ways (Ill. 8): during the bath after birth by an honorific umbrella and a whisk suspended from a tree in front of which there is also a water urn; dur- ing the First Seven Steps by footprints, as mentioned before. In later Bud- dhist art, e.g. in sixth century China, in the midst of iconic representation, the seven footprints are sometimes replaced by lotus flowers which are sup- posed to bloom under the feet of a holy being.13 They are said to have ap- peared when the new-born Siddhartha made his four-times-seven steps, a symbol of the eventual supremacy of his doctrine. 13 Relief on the back of a sixth century stele in the University Museum, Philadelphia; Seckel: Buddhistische Kunst Ostasiens, ill. 32.

I, 0.' is invisible but suggested by the umbrella and heavenly beings floating By no means all phases ofBuddha's life exist in artistic representations, and even of the existing ones we shall mention only the most important ex- amples. The first meditation of the young prince under a jambu tree in a field is shown by an empty throne under the tree and a plowing peasant (Bodhgaya; i 11. 2i). In the lGreat Departure, the secret escape from the palace and from worldly life altogether (11. i), we see a horse whose rider is invisible but suggested by the umbrella and heavenly beings floating through the air paying homage (Sanc I, east gate; Amaravat). In addition gods lift the hooves of the horse into the air in order to make the escape silent. Horses in other scenes meant to be without a rider are not shown with such gods. In Sanci I, east gate, both the gods and the rider-less horse are shown side by side (I c. 12). The later, iconic phase of Amaravati shows the rider in normal human form (Ill. I3). Before withdrawing into seclu- sion for six years' ascetic exercises, the Prince removes his turban and cuts off his long, richly decorated hair with his sword Both turban and hair jew- elry float upwards into the Heaven of the Thirty Three Gods (tr yastrgima), where they are placed on a throne or altar in a shrine and venerated with music and dance (Bharhut; Ill. 14; Gandhara; Ill. I);I4 sometimes the tur- ban is carried aloft in a large chalice in the midst of a group of rejoicing gods (I11. i6). This important biographical scene from the life of the Bud- dha depicts the decisive transition from his worldly life to the Eightfold Path of Enlightenment. The central object, however, is the turban, which does not represent the holy person himself but only an object belonging to him (albeit an important one, intimately connected to his role as prince). Indeed, the turban is immediately given the status of relic, and the same happens to the Buddha's alms bowl (I1I. 17), about which more later on. I4 Zimmer: Art of Indian Asia, vol.

Amaravati, stupa railing medallion: The Great Departure. London, British Museum. The decisive event, the enlightenment under the Bodhi tree (asvattha, pippala, or Pipal;ficus religiosa) at Uruvela (today's Urel near Bodhgaya), is usually represented by the tree itself (bodhi-druma, -ruksa, Ill. i8); fre- quently, under the tree there is an empty throne, called the diamond seat (vajrasana); according to cosmological interpretation this is the immov- able center of the world, the only fixed point in the unsteady chaos of ap- paritions. The throne may have the shape of a simple, altar-like block of stone, but it can also be shown as a lavishly embellished chair surrounded by various symbolic animals.15 This ensemble of tree and meditation seat is called bodhi-manda (seat or site of enlightenment), and Bodhgaya re- mains to this day the very center of Buddha worship, since it is here that the crucial step toward enlightenment was taken. In early Buddhist art, holy trees can have other meanings and functions, but the Pipal tree stands at the center of this iconography. Inscriptions in Bharhut call- " ... .:', ing the Pipal tree bhagavato (the Exalted One, i.e. the Bud- j^^. ^dha) are proof that the Pipal tree can represent the personage of the Buddha or indicate his presence. An identity between SSf ^ ^his person and the tree is established in the collection of Ja- takas. There the &lt; Bodhisattva&gt; (i.e. the Buddha-to-be) incar- nates himself as tree deity (rukkha-devatd) no less than 43 times. In the Divyavadana the Buddha agrees to a Bodhi tree I 4f j being planted as his representative during his absence, since , .^lf.i,~ tthe tree is his &lt;permanent residence? (mana nibaddhavdso .:.^ . viya).i6 It is still to be studied how the concepts of personal &gt;t / f/ t. identity, scenic locality, and presence at a residence interact 13 21</page><page sequence="20">14 I5 in this scene. Sometimes, but by no means regularly or consistently, hon- orific umbrellas for the Exalted One can be seen near, above, or beside the tree; but his presence is indicated above all by two footprints (Ill. 24) show- ing the wheel of the doctrine, placed usually in front of the throne or some- times on a low bench. Like Sakyamuni, the six Buddhas of the Past can be represented by their Bodhi trees (Ill. I). The botanical attributes of these trees are quite pre- cisely distinguished in texts and often in images, too,'7 and the Buddha of the Future, Maitreya, will in turn be assigned his own tree. Foliage of the respective trees and possibly also the fruit must therefore be carefully scru- tinized in order to avoid false identification. The asvattha orpippala tree of Sakyamuni is easily identified by its heart-shaped, pointed leaves with long stems. (These leaves were already a popular motif on seals and painted ce- ramics of the Indus culture, where most likely there was also a religious 14.

Not every tree in early representations is necessarily Sikyamuni's Bodhi tree. We have already encountered the Jambu tree in the scene of the first meditation; another example is the mango that the Buddha miraculously caused to grow in order to convince his adversary of his superior capabili- ties. In Bharhut and Sinci, this episode is shown using the icono- graphic model of the enlightenment scene (Ill. I9)20 - a mango tree with fruit, an empty throne in front of the tree, an honorific umbrella above, worship- pers all around - except that in this case the tree does not represent the Buddha. In the Bharhut relief showing the purchase of the Jetavana garden for the Buddha (I11. o20), the donor, the wealthy merchant Anatha- pindika (or Anathapindada), had to cover the entire ground with pieces of gold, and the Exalted One might be represented by a tree. The tree in question is different from g_ ethe others in the park by its foliage and a railing around it; it is also being watered by the donor with a bucket.

Later on we shall talk again about tree sanctuaries and their veneration as well as about symbol combinations a nd various meanings given to trees - a complex sub- ject that far outreaches the illustrativ e function within the framework of the Buddha biography. The Bodhi tree with the empty throne in front also appears in other scenes connected with the enlightenment, especially the attack of Mara and the temptation by his daughters, or the protection of the Buddha by Naga Mucalin.da (I1. 21), who spreads his snake heads above him like an umbrella, e.g. in a pillar relief from Pauni dating to the first century B.C. (To be sure, in this example the tree does not have the pointed leaves so typical of the Pipal tree; it could therefore represent a different Buddha, but in a similar scene.) Usually, the empty throne is combined with a tree, although sometimes, as we shall see, with other symbols as well; but it is always meant as the seat of the Buddha, the dominant personage of the scene and recipient of veneration. The throne itself is never the object of veneration. However, one must be very careful to distinguish if it is indeed the Buddha himself who is represented by the throne, or if the tree is meant as a holy object which in turn can receive veneration. This distinction can 2I Stnci I, north gate: Zimmer, Art of Indian Asia, vol. 2, pl. iI a; story: vol. 1, p. 241. 22 Bhirhut, Prasenajit pillar: Coomaraswamy: Sculpture de Bhdrhut, ill. 29; story: p. 48ff. 24</page><page sequence="23">20.

This de- scent is indicated by a footprint on the topmost and fl^ ij i the lowest rungs of the ladder, the upper one of the ?ffiA|iati 9 right foot, the lower one of the left foot (Bhirhut). 1IJilBtl However, elsewhere (Sinci I, pillar of the North gate23) the ladder is shown with a tree and throne on both ends, a further instance for the identification of the Buddha with a tree; it is also an example for the separation of such a symbol from its orig- inal historic-illustrative context, thus making it freely available. The foot- print, too, as we shall see, is to gain significance and dissemination far beyond its original function as illustration of a specific scene.24 Along with the two first main events, birth and enlightenment, the third one, the First Sermon in the Deer Park near Benares, is one of the most frequently depicted themes in the aniconic phase. In Buddhist terms, this sermon is &lt;the turning of the wheel of the dharma (dharmacakrapravar- tana),&gt; and thus the wheel is always at the center of the scene. Since the Buddha is present on a throne, the wheel frequently appears on or above an altar-like throne seat, which sometimes takes the shape of a chair with one or two cushions, and surrounded by listeners and worshippers - gods, peo- ple, animals (Sanci I, West Gate, middle rail; Ill. 27). Characteristic of the scene, and often a means of identifying it, are the two deer listening at the feet of the Buddha while at the same time indicating the locale, i.e. the Deer Park (although they are by no means always present). This aniconic repre- sentation of the First Sermon, including the deer (see p. 34f.), can even be found in the completely iconic art ofGandhara25 (although rarely and only as a supplement on the base of Buddha images). (A motif similar to the deer occurs already in the Indus culture: on the famous seal with the three-faced 23 Zimmer, Art of Indian Asia, vol. 2, pl. 8. 24 Worshipping of the footprints is widely practiced in India, especially in the Visnnu or Krisna cults. 25 Ingholt: Gandhdran Art in Pakistan, ill. 79; cf. ills. 75, 76, 78. 27</page><page sequence="26">.,/, ,'--,~ 5~ ?;~~'":~ ', !'.'4~~" ." ..."~:.'".::' .:~. !".... ? .... . :? .:,..... :.; .....~ i,, ~...~ ..~ . -'....: .,... . f' b= _*'"-. / - 4 .... ::h t X T ..0 ~di'"JZ '- . - ~' 'F.~ ~~:'~ ' ."4 t , i ?* _ _# E _ 2 5 5 ~,.: :II 7 ? ~ -~.~ I L? 27.

In the Bheyond,rhut relief showing King Prasenait visiting the Buddha (Illnote. 28), the latter is represented by a large wheel adorned with a garland and an um- brella inside a stately building which might well be the Jetavana monas- tery. Around this building, the king is performing the rite of circumambu- /atio (pradaksind). This wheel does not signify the First Sermon, but the teaching Buddha per se, or the embodiment of the doctrine as such. Thus the symbol of the wheel, too, has been separated from the historical event and its biographical-illustrative function, becoming a general symbol that can be used quite freely, just like the Bodhi tree, the footprints, and other representative Buddhist signs. 26 Mode (see footnote i8), pl. 66; Sir Mortimer Wheeler: Civilizations in the Indus Valley and Beyond, London i966, i11. 43; cf. note 44. 28</page><page sequence="27">30 30. Sanci, Stupa I, South Torana: Asoka visiting the site of the First Sermon. In situ. In the scene of the First Sermon as well as in V.^Ij^^C ^^other passages, the wheel is often combined with -.'~,.. it ' jip, a pillar or column (stambha, yupa). In these cases, the wheel stands on a column of varying height, _i,,ke^^^ ' often quite short, and sometimes a throne may _ be added, too. In a relief medallion from Bharhut (I11.29) we see the Buddha in this symbolic shape as he is worshipped by gods or people lis- tening to his sermon; animals, too, most likely the usual deer, are lying atop the pillar and in _R ^^ ffront of the wheel. However, when King Asoka appears as worshipper with his entourage, e.g. in ,5 W J v | ~ ~ a relief on the pillar of the south gate of Sanci I t li'3lt (I11. 30), the wheel column does not represent the .J j long deceased Buddha himself but the site of his '. * . a . . i First Sermon, and at the same time, in more gen- B ll t eral terms, the doctrine, the Buddhist truth it- self. This cakra-stambha motif is connected with 4tjt ; i t_ the symbolism of the universal monarch (cakra- ,; -, ^ ~: vartin) and the world axis; it has old origins, and 3 &lt; &lt; * _ w11 we encounter it in the ? Asoka &gt; pillar of Sarnath as well. Later on, in the Saddharmapundarika ^ j&lt;l Sutra (the SOtra of the Lotus of the Good Law), the Buddha is called a &lt;Gold Pillar?, (suvarna- ^L- yupa). We shall come back to these cosmological - J ^ a) ' . v aspects; for the moment, however, let us remain with the biographical scenes. Many events fall between the First Sermon and Buddha's entry into Nirvana, the forty years of peregrination and teaching, but only few of them are of interest to us here. The descent from the Heaven of the Thirty- Three Gods has been mentioned already. A new, quite strange symbol for the Buddha appears in scenes in which he walks across the water or in the air. In one instance (Ill. 31) he converts the unbelieving ascetic Uruvilva Kasyapa by proving his miraculous powers (Sanci I, East gate); another time (Ill. 32), at the encounter with his royal father in Kapilavastu, he avoids the protocol problem of who has to bow to whom, the son to the father, or the father to the Exalted One (Sanci I, North Gate, right pil- lar). The Buddha is represented by a basically quite simple, archaic sym- bol: the &lt;walking path&gt; (cankrama), hovering like a heavy stone plinth or plank in the middle of the scene. The cankrama can be seen a third time in Sanci I (East Gate, left pillar), in an unusual representation of a group of gods who solemnly welcome this event above the enlightenment 29</page><page sequence="28">r? L n.--?7 s Y ?r: 4sr " "" * t t T?Q- Ise s c 1 %1 ,?' ...?ll_ccrr* LP 31 32 scene.27 Between the two rows of gods lies a long, horizontal plinth; maybe it is supposed to remind the believer of the Buddha's roaming through distant world space during the seven weeks after his enlighten- ment, as mentioned in the texts. The symbol is different from most oth- ers in that it represents an action of the Buddha, not his actual person it- self, nor a situation or a locality of his life, such as the tree representing his enlightenment or the site thereof. In Buddhist art, the attainment of salvation - the final fulfillment, the entry into &lt;complete extinction&gt; (pari-nirvdna) - is symbolized by the burial mound, the stupa, the privilege of mighty rulers (cakravartin), Bud- dhas, and other holy persons. Thus it is quite consistent when the Buddhas of the Past, having entered Nirvana eons ago, sometimes appear in the im- age of the stupa (Ill. I). Originally, it is the stupa (or numerous stupas, ac- cording to legend) where the earthly remains of the Buddha were buried. According to Buddhist thinking these relics are crystal pearls left after the cremation of the body of an enlightened person; they contain the essence of his being and are his holy body (sartra).28 They are called ? seeds &gt; (bija) 31.

There- fore the stupa is more important than the image chapel in early Buddhist art, and remains so to this day in Sri Lanka. 30 I Lw; , -2 W 4</page><page sequence="29">I L ;i L....l L' L-. .L 33 33.

Madras, Museum. contained in the &lt;egg (anda) or &lt;womb (garbha) of the stupa body. Thus the Buddha is present bodily in the stupa (which in its essence is a reliquary tomb, and basically remains so for later Buddhism as well) in the form of these formless relics, and the stupa can therefore be worshipped as the Buddha.29 This can be seen in countless relief carvings on early monu- ments (which themselves were mostly stupas; Ill. 33). In the case of the ear- lier ones (Bharhut, Sanci) the stupa still retains the simple shape of a hemi- sphere on a base surrounded by a railing; on top of the mound is a box-like structure called a harmikd from which protrudes the vertical mast of the central axis, adorned with one or more umbrellas. The umbrellas as well as the stupa body may be embellished by flower garlands. In the late phase (Amaravati, Nagarjunikonda), these decorative elements grow increas- ingly rich - the expression of an ever growing cult of veneration (pzijd). (From an early date on, votive stupas are being donated to holy sites; they survive in all sizes and many materials in all Buddhist countries, dating to all ages.) At this stage, the stupas themselves carry relief carvings showing 29 E.g. in the Lalitavistara, the stupa is identified with the body ofthe Buddha (Benisti, , Etude sur le Stupa, , p. 5I); the position of a Buddha image in the center of a sanctu- ary and of apradaksina-patha ?equates the image liturgically with the stupa?&gt; (Do- hanian, p.

In front of and beside the stupa, believers are worshipping - sometimes they are animals, such as elephants (Ill. 35) - and above the stupa divine beings rejoice over the final enlightenment of the Buddha, since it signifies and guarantees the possibility of liberation from the sufferings of the cycle of sa.nsdra equally for all living beings. Occasionally the reliefs on early monu- ments illustrate scenic events, as in Sanci (on a pillar of the North Gate; Ill. 36) where a group of musicians and other people in a festive mood are shown congregated in front of a staipa. They t o d- are the Mallas of Kusinagara (the site where c- Sakyamuni died) celebrating in holy rapture the eul e t e reception of their share of the Buddha relics. On the other hand, the stapa soon develops into an i f isolated cult minonument devoid of all historical- narrative connections with time and space, such as the image-less st.ipa in the center of the caitya Ain g hall of Karl (111. 37) (early second century A.D.), - ' a particularly magnificent example in its sim- a plicity and purity (similar at Bedsa; Bhaja, late j g o . second century B.C.; Ajanta IO, ca. first century B.C.).

The image is meant to remind the believer that the Buddha (in his relics) is really present inside the stupa, symbol of the universe and its center, as timeless &lt; core&gt;&gt; or &lt; seed, &gt; and that he appears only in order to propagate the sacred word, which is also such a &lt; seed. This survey of the various symbols with which early Buddhist iconog- raphy alludes to the Buddha in the different stages of his religious life shows that no single symbol was reserved exclusively for the central figure, al- though othe symbolized reality of all Buddhist emblems [is] the same, ..jC _' l drnamely the Buddha. &gt;&gt;3 The symbols have very different origins: from the body of the Buddha, from places significant in his spiritual life, from a sa- cred monument, or from royal symbolism; others were freely invented. This multiplicity can be explained by the close connection with biogra- phical situations, by the predilection of Buddhist art for narrative illus- .g:.r5 ^K^ tration, by the influence of pre-Buddhist concepts, but also by the early Buddhist aversion to fixed dogmas and rules. None of the symbols - nei- ther the tree, the wheel, the stupa, nor any other - could claim exclusivity as long as the aniconic principle remained in force, because the represen- tation of the Buddha was closely linked to, rooted in, and derived from the respective biographical situation. As soon as the personal image of the Bud- ' ." . ... '";" dha came to prevail, however, a limited number of final, canonical formu- lae for the representation of the Buddha developed, models which changed ' t but little during the long history of the faith. Among these image types, i that of the Buddha seated with folded legs, hands joined in the meditation f mudri, became the most widely accepted since it showed the Buddha in _..s~--a?: ; ~~a~., .'i~ 30 Dumoulin: Buddha-Symbole, p. 55. 39 33</page><page sequence="32">the archetypal, eternal posture of the Enlightened One, removed from time, immutable, imperturbable, and perfectly concentrated. Thus the im- age, too, even though a representation of a person, attains to a high degree the character and the validity of a symbol. The other main image types, such as the teaching Buddha, the Buddha granting protection and salva- tion, or the Buddha calling the earth goddess to testify, are basically only variants of the principal seated image but show him in action. Later on we shall see that the group of early symbols, too, has a dimension beyond the biographical-historical illustration. It was a considerable artistic challenge to create an abundant religious imagery without representing the main figure. But the early Buddhist artists and artisans turned that handicap to their advantage. For one thing, if the beholder knew the encoded pictorial language, the symbols allowed precise, programmatic representation of a scene's content. The symbols also kept the artist from the danger of depicting the Buddha as too similar to the persons of his environment and thus debasing him to the realm of samsara with its fleeting and sorrowful phenomena, profaning him by fitting him into the real and realistically depicted everyday life. And finally the symbols allowed the artist to create a center of emptiness, tranquility, and contemplation in the midst of the crowds and vitality of the narrative scenes. This center of emptiness corresponded quite precisely to the reli- gious meaning of the Buddha's character and the doctrine of his entry into Nirvana, and was far more suggestive than a human figure in the midst of many others. In the silent sign, replete with the highest meaning, the Bud- dha's presence was all the more spiritual, pure, and meaningful. This con- cept applies not only to illustrative scenes, but also to the design of the cen- tral cult monument, the complete stupa, at least in its original shape, as at Sanci. There the teeming multitudes of the relief carvings on the railings and gates surround the austere sanctuary - a sanctuary in which the Bud- dha is present through his relics, symbolizing the release from a life of il- lusion and suffering. The railings and gates form the boundary to the pro- fane world, while the innermost core, the stupa itself, emanates, by the simple grandeur of its hemispherical shape, the Nothingness of Nirvana, transcending all appearances and thus not representable. The principle that the ultimate truth cannot be depicted and can be alluded to only by sym- bols was to remain largely valid for later Buddhism and its art. 34</page><page sequence="33">GROUPS AND COMBINATIONS OF SYMBOLS Although various symbols are firmly rooted in the Buddha's biography, sometimes they can be detached from the narrative context and used more or less independently. For instance the tree can play various roles depend- ing on the biographical scene and mean something else each time (e.g., First Meditation; Enlightenment; Miracle of the Mango Tree.). Yet in the scenes of the Purchase of the Jetavana Garden or the Descent from Heaven of the Thirty-Three Gods, the tree represents the Buddha in a manner that cannot be derived from the story in question. This formulaic use is possi- ble because the symbol attains an intrinsic value and becomes transposable, just as during the phase of iconic, personal representation the Buddha figure (isolated from one scene or distilling the contents of one scene in ab- breviation) becomes the single cult image that can be transplanted into var- ious contexts. Combinations of symbols isolated from biographical scenes are also possible, specifically in two ways. The first possibility is to line up in a row the symbols for the three main events of the Buddha's biography: Enlightenment, the First Sermon, and Entry into Nirvana (the fourth event, Buddha's birth, is usually absent). For instance, in a pillar from Amaravati (Ill. 39) we see, from bottom to top, the tree with the throne, the wheel with the column above the throne, and finally the stupa. Divine worshippers venerate all three symbols. This act of adoration means that the symbols have been detached from the specific narrative context of the biographical scenes and that they have attained the level of cult objects. To be sure, in this case the sequence is still an histor- ical one, visualizing the logical chain from the enlightenment to the ser- mon and to the Nirvana, the last placed on top and literally culminating the sequence. Nevertheless, this set of images is different from the one on another pillar at Amaravati in which there are, from bottom to top, repre- sentations of the enlightenment, then the scene with Sujata proffering food to the Buddha, and the Crossing of the Nairanjana River (11. i8): this group of images shows some events together within the historical-biographical sequence, of which only one is of central significance. By contrast, the first sequence lifts the three main events from the complete biographical story by means of the adoring celestial beings common to all three representa- tions: these celestial beings remove the images from their narrative-his- torical context and turn them into almost mystery-like cult objects. In another constellation of such image groups, three symbols are lined up horizontally in one frame, on the left the tree, on the right the wheel column, and in the middle a reliquary representing the stupa (Nagaruni- konda; Ill. 40). Here, too, the Nirvana symbol is especially distinguished as the goal of the path to salvation, not only by its central position but also by the majestic sign of a tempietto, a round or polygonal pillared pavilion 35</page><page sequence="34">40 4I with a cupola. The three symbols are precisely differentiated: in front of the tree and the wheel column is a throne (a chair with arm and back rests), in front of which is the plinth with the footprints - i.e. the living Buddha is present - while, accordingly, there is no such throne in front of the reli- quary. Another Nagarjunakonda relief carving (Ill. 41) representing a stupa shows, between tree and wheel column, again inside a cupola pavilion, a flaming pillar with throne and footprints in front, a symbol for the Bud- dha about which we shall talk presently. Such groupings of symbols seem to occur especially in the somewhat later phase of aniconic art, in Amara- vati and Nagarjunikonda. According to the logic of typological develop- ment, they belong indeed to a later phase, since they are derived from the original narrative context. On the other hand, a similar group can be found already in the Caitya Hall of Karli (early second century B.C.). Among the fifteen columns of the right side of the caitya Hall, the eighth, i.e. the cen- tral one, set off by its beveled shape, is the only one that carries three small reliefs: a stupa in the middle, to the left a wheel column with deer - orig- inally, a metal wheel was inserted - and to the right a column with a lion capital like the &lt;Asoka? type. (It is not clear what the column symbolizes here). This group of symbols on a column is reminiscent of the dyaka-stamb- has, the pillar groups (mostly five) attached to the stupas of Amaravati and Nagarjunikonda, and meticulously rendered on stupa relief carvings; these pillar groups also show the most important symbols (Ill. 34). Also to be mentioned are three supporting pillars between the lateral railings of a 40. Nagarjunikonda, stupa relief: Bodhi tree (left), reliquary (center), wheel column (right).

Groupings of three are es- pecially popular, with a central motif set officonographically and formally, and flanked by two accompanying motifs. Such a sublimely charged for- mula &gt; (Hoheitsformel) arises quite naturally in early Buddhist art whenever worshippers or guardian deities on both sides are turned towards a central object of adoration (tree, wheel, column, stupa, divine or human being); examples are the two elephants beside Laksmi, or the worshippers beside the tree, wheel, or stupa symbols (frequently in Bharhut and Sanci). This simple formula develops into a more complex grouping in the re- liefs of a torana railing from Mathura (ca. IOO A.D.; 11. 43,44). In the mid- dle of that narrow, long band of images, there is a bodhighara (a tree sanc- tuary), on both sides of which a row of six worshippers are turning towards the center. This main central group is itself flanked by a wheel column on the right and a stupa tower on the left, each of which is worshipped by be- lievers on both sides. The correct biographical-historic sequence is of no importance in all these group images: the tree, the wheel, and the stupa are not lined up in accordance with any time sequence. Thus, they are no longer narrative illustrations of an episode, but are combined as isolated, trans- historical elements of a doctrinal system, and any one of them can be em- phasized by being placed in the central position. Something resembling a triad develops quite early, similar to the ones that the iconic-figural art of Mathura, Gandhara, and Amaravati will soon create and canonize as a fun- damental configuration of Buddhist cult figures for all times. Indeed, the figural triad, too, is isolated from the narrative-illustrative context of the Buddha's biography, and becomes an iconic-heraldic cult object above and beyond time. 43 44 37 42</page><page sequence="36">The second, quite different way of combining such isolated symbols is to join them into an imaginary body of the Buddha. The core of this composite symbol can be found in those representations of the First Ser- mon in which the wheel of the doc- trine is combined with a pillar or a column, perhaps even with a throne - in that case the wheel may be seen as the shining head of the Buddha and the column as his backbone. If, moreover, footprints are in front of the throne, the symbol clearly refers to the person of the Buddha. The foot- prints are, after all, frequently the deci- sive evidence for the personal presence of the Buddha, and thus often help identifying certain scenes. If flames are flaring up on both sides of the pillar or column, clearly the subject is one of the miracles of grvasti, when flames issued from the Buddha's shoulders and water streamed from his feet.3 Such a symbol of the Bud- 45. dha's body can be seen in a relief from Nagarjunakonda (Ill. 41) where the Aariati, medallion on stfipa railing: Rihula is central image between Bodhi tree and wheel column seems to depict the introduced to his father, the scene of Sravasti; but as we have already mentioned, the central scene Buddha(cf ill. 3). Amaravati, Museum. should nevertheless be interpreted rather as an isolated cult symbol char- acterized by the cupola pavilion. Another example, this one from Amara- vati (Ill. 45), transplants the motif of the flame pillar, again by means of the procedure mentioned above, into a purely biographical-illustrative con- text. In an artistically successful scene suggesting the presence of the Bud- dha, Sgkymuni's son Rihula is introduced to his father, who persuades him to join the community of monks. Strictly speaking, the flame pillar motif does not belong to this narrative context - further evidence, therefore, that the symbol alludes to the person of the Buddha and that it is used as a trans- posable formula. The imaginary body of the Buddha can further be seen in completely de-historicized, hieratic form, free from any narrative context, on stupa re- liefs such as one from Amaravati (111. 34). There we can see not only a throne with wheel column (i.e. the teaching Buddha) in front of the represented stfpa, but also, on each side, a high, slender column consisting of super- 31 Frequently in Gandhiran art, e.g. Rowland: Art and Architecture, pi. 33; John M.

In situ. imposed stories - most likely representing the heavenly spheres - and each carrying on its lion capital a large wheel. Hardly anybody would interpret this wheel column as the Buddha's body, if underneath it there were not an empty throne with the footprints in front of it, and if we did not know of more simple, undisputed examples for the meaning of this symbol. But the doubling of the column shows to what ex- tent it has already become an independent "te^^ ^ j ~ formula available at random. Such a highly abstract formulation is not, as one might think, a product of the late phase of Amara- vati and Nagarjunakonda - where sometimes the Buddha is already shown in human form in the same relief (Ill. 34, top). This formula- tion occurs as early as Sanci I (Ill. 46), even in an especially abstract form: at the bottom are the large footprints with the wheel symbol, on top is a wheel designed as lotus rosette ^^^|^6| ~ ~reminiscent of a nimbus, crowned (as else- where) by a trisula, a trident symbolizing the i^^3% ~ Three Jewels: the Buddha, the Dharma, and the monastic congregation), which is covered by an umbrella at the very top. From the feet to the wheel head, the body axis rises in the shape of numerous, richly embellished lotus palmettes. Next to this motif occupying the full height of the torana pillar, there are sev- eral relief frames of the usual illustrative type - a striking contrast of representational con- fin ^ cept as well as formal appearance. 46 39</page><page sequence="38">SYMBOLISM OF A COSMOLOGICAL AND UNIVERSAL NATURE As the preceding chapter indicates, behind or beneath the meaning visible in early Buddhist images and in the texts on which they are based, other layers of meaning help explain seemingly strange aspects of Buddhist sym- bols. These further dimensions can be explored by comparative interpre- tation of a religious-historical nature. We are dealing here partly with con- cepts that reach far back into Indian antiquity, concepts that are integrated into Buddhism from an early time and are in turn enriched with new con- tent. We have shown this above with examples of early symbols on coins, the Pipal leaf and the trisula. On the other hand, we see an increasing ten- dency to divest the concept of the Buddha of its historic-individual char- acter - i.e. of Sakyamuni as the founder and teacher of a religious commu- nity with certain doctrines and a predominantly philosophical concept of salvation. Instead, the Buddha is invested with a new character, that of uni- versality reaching supra-historical, supra-individual, even supra-human and cosmic dimensions. (What we mean here is what has often and mis- leadingly been called the deification of the Buddha, an important aspect of Mahayana doctrine as it developed in early Buddhist art). Developing hand in hand with this tendency is an &lt;&lt;imperialization,?&gt; i.e. the Buddha's actions and his authority are interpreted increasingly as those of a ruler. Both principles, the universal and the imperial one, converge in the idea of the uni- versal monarch, the cakravartin (I11.47), and characteristics and attributes of the secular ruler are transferred to the Buddha as a spiritual uni- versal monarch. It is precisely because of the idea of universality that old Indian concepts concern- ing the order of the universe are involved, and ?1^ j analogous to the Brahman idea of(mahd-)puruna, the primordial man or cosmic archetypical being, the Buddha's body, too, is identified with the ' v world-body, i.e. the universe. Because of this |r,i general re-interpretation, all important symbols of the Buddha's life are given a new dimension and an expansion of meaning which might well be taken as an adulteration from the point of view of Proto-Buddhism (a problematic entity in 0 ~ many respects). For Buddhists - at any rate - the S'. new concepts are binding, and in most Buddhist ' countries they have retained their validity at all . times, even though in many variants. ;; ' . 47.

Bangkok, private collection. 40</page><page sequence="39">This is not the place to expound ancient Indian concepts of the uni- verse, and we can give only a few examples of some symbols that convey this other, more inclusive, level of meaning. The symbol for the birth of the Bodhisattva (Laksmi-abhiseka) is connected with a very old cult of life and fertility, in which the lotus - at the same time a world symbol - also has its place. In India, as elsewhere, the tree of life plays a central role in folk cults. But at the same time, the tree is the world tree and world axis. When combined with the throne, the tree becomes the symbol of the ruler whose seat stands in the center of the world, whose sovereign authority is legitimized by his ascending the throne at the foot of this central world axis. The ruler thus gains the godlike power which benefits the entire world. The animal symbols frequently found on the ruler's throne are ei- ther imperial ones such as the lion - the Buddha, too, is often seated on a lion's throne - or, cosmologically, they designate elements of the universe and the four cardinal points. The wheel, long before it becomes the sym- bol of Doctrine and the First Sermon, is the Sun Wheel which determines the world's orbit. It thus belongs to the universal monarch and, by exten- sion, to the spiritual universal monarch, the Buddha. The meaning of the word for universal monarch, cakravartin (cakra = wheel, vrt = to turn) is &lt;the one who sets the holy wheel (of world-pacifying dominion) in mo- tion. ,32 That title is directly transferred to the Buddha and means in his case the teaching of the Dharma, the world law, by which he exercises his spiritual universal reign. The wheel has become one of the 32 &lt; major signs &gt; of superhuman perfection on the body of the Buddha (I11. 58): he wears it on his palms and on the soles of his feet, thus impressing it on to the ground wherever he goes. In all later Buddhist art, this sign can be seen on Buddha figures. The sun wheel crowns the axis mundi, the pillar which stands in the immovable center of the world. When the Bud- dha is symbolized by this pillar, his head (and the wisdom . 1 ~emanating from it) appear as a radiant wheel, illuminating F . J the world like the sun. The &lt;Asoka? columns represent this fc - idea as imperial symbol. In a purely Buddhist context, the t u " wheel-column appears at the entrance to Caitya Halls such as Karli33 (where the original metal wheel has been lost), beside stupas, as the Amarivati reliefs show; and later in Thailand as 32 Zimmer: Philosophie und Religion, p.

The flaming pillar -body, in Buddhist legend the universe; he thus attainsra- cle at lrivastl - most likely can be traced to the Vedic concept of Agni, the holy fire, symbolized as a cosmic pillar. Other traditional Brahman con- cepts are transposed onto notions of the Historical Buddha, who, accord- ing to Nirvana doctrine, can be neither grasped intellectually nor depicted visually. When, however, the Buddha is perceived in a cosmological way derived from the Brahmanical ideas of empty space and the universe, his body becomes the world body, identical with the universe; he thus attains the quality of infinity and boundlessness. By the same token, the stupa, the last Buddhist symbol in the biographical sense and the ultimate one in the p phlosophic-religious and universalistic one, has pre-Buddhist roots in th cult of the burial mound - especially of kings - and in the closely con- nected concepts of the world mountain and the cosmos. The cosmos is, af- ter all, represented to perfection by the stupa with its circular shape en- compassing all world directions and with the world axis at its center. And in the midst of this world, as seed but or &lt;&lt; embryo, mpl resides the Buddha in his sacral body, the relic. Indeed, as Universal Buddha he is identical with this world.34 Within the frame of these cosmological and universal con- cepts, many of the symbols converge - despite their different origins and development - in a fairly homogeneous iconological system. Thus it might be said that actually the symbols of the early Buddhist images are not Buddhist at all, but belong completely to the vegetal, cos- mological, and imperial realm of ideas of pre-Buddhist India, and that they are merely interpolated into the Buddhist context. It is therefore not sur- prising to see them assert their original nature ever more clearly in their new environment, too. But this interpretation is too radical. To be sure, Buddhism uses pre-Buddhist ideas and symbols - and increasingly so as 42</page><page sequence="41">time goes on - but in Buddhism these ideas and concepts attain new, ad- ditional meaning. In a way, they pass through the spiritual medium of Buddhism, gain a specific new hue, and continue in mutated condition and with new dimensions of meaning, while at the same time carrying along the old significations. This process of adaptation is quite typical, and oc- curs in other religions as well. VARIANTS OF MEANING So far we have talked almost exclusively about the part that symbols play in the aniconic representations of the Buddha's person. In that respect, the symbols are more or less firmly tied to the Buddha's biography, and their validity in this function ends with the entry into Nirvana. However, the symbols lose this significance when they occur in later historical settings, as, for instance, when King Asoka visits the place of the First Sermon in Sarnath in the midst of a flock of worshippers and a herd of deer (Sanci I, south gate; Ill. 30). Even if we grant that Asoka came there to have the fa- mous column erected in memory of the august event, and that he may have felt a kind of mystical identification of the locale with the Teacher himself, we cannot assume that the scene depicts the personal presence of the Bud- dha. (We can contrast it to, say, the representations [Ill. 28] showing the visit of King Prasenajit to the still living Buddha, symbolized by the wheel.) Similarly, when Asoka visits the sanctuary at the Bodhi Tree in Bodhgaya in order to revive the dead tree (Ill. 50; Sanci I, east gate), here, too, the tree does not symbolize the person of Buddha. The image refers to an event from the history of the Buddhist religion, the Enlightenment un- der that tree. Part of this history is the rise and increasingly lavish embellishment of holy places as cult sites. While the memory of the presence of the holy person still resonates there, the holy object at the site - e.g., tree, throne, stupa - turns into a cult object. Often it is not easy to decide which alter- native meaning applies. Sometimes (maybe even originally) the function of a symbol such as a tree is to identify the site, but at other times the same tree is also nearly identical with the Buddha ( my permanent residence, &gt; see above). In other cases the tree is there to remind the believer of the Bud- dha and his enlightenment, thus becoming the center of worship. In yet another variant the tree can be a code for the idea of enlightenment or of &lt;Buddha-hood per se. Several of these aspects converge in the Kalinga- bodhi-jataka,35 where we are told that the Buddha ordered that a ?tree of 34 Snodgrass: Symbolism of the Stipa, p. 360ff.; p. 363: &lt;&lt;In Buddhist art the stupa and the Buddha image are interchangeable. &gt;&gt; 35 Jataka no. 479; E.

A tree planted in the Buddha's memory and for worship can be consecrated when the Buddha himself meditates under it:37 this, too, shows the mingling of personal identification, sacral locality, and cult function in such a symbol. Sites connected with the life of the Buddha may be a natural holy place, originally no doubt a rock seat under a tree near a river, on which a shrine or temple is gradually built. At first it may be marked by a fence, then by some structure with an open space in the center surrounding tree: the bo- dhimanda (a seat of enlightenment) turns into a bodhighara. Once a site with its holy object is established, it can be multiplied and transferred some- where else, as the countless Bodhi Trees throughout the Buddhist world show (most of them being regarded as offspring of the original tree at Bodh- gaya); they are thus &lt;&lt;identical&gt;&gt; in a religious sense. Even the original Bodhi Tree is said to have been inhabited by a tree deity (v[r]ksa-devatd) before the Buddha attained enlightenment there, and tree sanctuaries (caitya-v[r]ksa) are built most likely from a very early time on. Such sanc- tuaries are mentioned in the Atharva-Veda; they occur on coins dating to the third or second century B.C.; and legend has Asoka surrounding the tree at Bodhgaya with a fence.38 Buddhism adapted early folk cults to its own religious ideas and pur- poses, refining the primitive practices in the process. In many cases it is difficult to decide if the Buddha is considered identical in the strictest sense of the word with the sacred objects, or if his presence at the holy sites is not just assumed and imagined. It may well be that the objects are only signs indicating the place of the respective event and the biographical point in time within religious history. The best evidence for the Buddha's personal presence are the footprints seen at such sites - as pars pro toto - or as actual &lt; traces &gt; in the sense of a sacred presence of a holy person who does not be- long to empirical reality. A symbolization of this holy person is, on the other hand, the combination of several symbols into a Buddha (as wheel column, flame pillar, world axis, characteristically often with footprints) - but in this case a different dimension is reached, namely the one of cos- mological universalization. 36 Coomaraswamy: Elements, p. 4. 37 Viennot: Le Culte de l'Arbre, p.

Bharhut stupa, railing relief: Bodhi tree sanctuary (bodhighara). Calcutta, Museum. At any rate, the holy objects at historical sites become cult objects from an early time on, &gt; ^,, .sT ~ and are worshipped (pujJa) at some places to this !' /F8&gt;il~ day. The objects, too, are soon isolated from their y^J^ ^^y^^^ original context; they can embody the Buddha t . .i^l and his doctrine quite independently, and in this function they are spread all over the Buddhist world. As is well known, the footprints, the .:. ~ ^U^^^B! wheel, the stupa, can be found in all Buddhist x";^~ ;; countries; they are objects of contemplation and " ' ' ,~%" 1e adoration, endowed with magical power to dis- pense happiness and blessings. In early Buddhist art, however, these objects appear predominantly in a narrative context and at various levels of de- velopment. Especially the tree sanctuaries are l shown sometimes as a simple fence, sometimes as an elaborate structure several stories high and It.. ~ lavishly embellished, the tree always protruding '~~!. "from its open center (Ill. 51). One would be in- ?I B^c dined to interpret all these representations as sanctuaries built after the death of the Buddha, i.e. when the tree had become a memorial and a cult object at a sacred site. It would further seem logical to accept as representations of the en- lightenment scene and the personal presence of the Buddha only such images where the tree is not yet enclosed by a building or fence. But there are many examples of inconsistencies which point to the manifold faceting of these aspects and meanings. Thus, the Prasenajit pillar at Bharhut shows a bodhighara (Ill. 5I), although the inscription clearly mentions &lt; [the scene of] the en- lightenment of the exalted Sakyamuni (bhagavato sakamunino bodho). ? And the West Gate of Sanci I (lower railing, inside) carries a representation of the attack of Mara - where the Buddha is to be understood as personally present - with the tree already enclosed by its protective and cultic struc- ture.39 In the image showing Asoka's visit at Bodhgaya (see above) at the same monument, the presence of the structure is chronologically correct, while in the Mara scene, which belongs to the Buddha's biography, the structure is an anachronism. But obviously, such a logic of time sequence had to take second place to the knowledge that the decisive religious facts and events are beyond time and history. 39 Zimmer: Art of Indian Asia, vol. 2, pl. 20. 45</page><page sequence="44">Buddhist literature and images indicate that the Buddha is thought to have been an object of worship even during his lifetime. His footprints are considered as his representation and adored accordingly (in many places up to this day). Objects belonging to him, such as his turban or his alms bowl, are seen as relics; and he is considered to be personally present in the relics of his earthly body buried in the stupas. A characteristic relief (11l. 24) shows the veneration of the Buddha seated on a throne under a canopy, un- mistakably identified by the footprints (Bharhut, Ajatasatru pillar); but the altar-like throne itself is richly adorned with flowers and garlands, among which there are three handprints (the &lt;&lt; five-finger sign&gt;&gt; ;pancdngu- lika). (According to J. Ph. Vogel, the handprints have a triple meaning: protection against evil influences, consecration of a sacrificial offering, and sign of veneration.40) Holy person, holy object, holy site - seen as it were sub specie aeternitatis - are one and the same; they can take each other's place, and they can be worshipped in the same way. The wide range of the symbols' meanings can be clearly seen in the ex- ample of the stupa. From its genetic, i.e. cultural and religious, origin the stupa is a tomb; in the case of the Buddha, it contains his sarra (essentially his &lt;&lt; body?) and he is therefore personally and bodily present in the stupa. But his presence goes beyond empiricism into an ideal realm. Since the stupa is connected with the final and crowning event in the Buddha's earthly life, i.e. his entry intoparinirvana, it has a biographical significance, designating the holy site where the event took place. It is thus site- and time-specific, and this relation with place and time is extended into the cos- mic dimension and universalized. Just as the Buddha is the universal ruler, the stupa becomes the world symbol. On the other hand, the stupa symbol far outreaches the dimension of space, time and biographic-historical as well as universal personality, and extends to the sphere of Nirvana's empti- ness, transcending all dimensions. It can therefore symbolize the idea of Nirvana, the absolute &lt;Buddha essence or &lt;&lt;Buddha-hood,&gt; just as the tree represents the same Buddha-essence in its aspect of world-illuminat- ing Enlightenment, and as the wheel represents it in its aspect of the uni- versal truth, of the final doctrine and its preaching. This meaning and func- tion are present even in early Buddhist art - as isolated representations of the footprints, the tree, the wheel, or the stupa show - and the same can be seen in such triad-like combinations as the reliquary with tree and wheel column on either side. 40 Auboyer: Le Trone, p. IIff.; Vogel: &lt; The Sign of the Spread Hand. ) 46</page><page sequence="45">The Indians themselves distinguish three kinds of venerable objects.4' The first, called sdrfraka ( bodily, corporeal ?), are physical remains or ob- jects belonging to the body of a holy person, such as hair or footprints (the tooth of the Buddha worshipped in Sri Lanka is, for instance, such an ob- ject). The second kind, called paribhogika (objects &lt;for use?), are such things as the Buddha's alms bowl, clothes, seats (vajrdsana), and even the Bodhi Tree. The third kind, uddesika (&lt;hint, illustrate, explain&gt;&gt;), are ac- tual symbols - which are, after all, connotative, meaningful, explanatory signs - such as the triratna (trisula), the wheel of the doctrine, or the stupa. The meanings and functions of the stupa are distinguished by the same three categories: sdriraka stupas contain body relics of the holy person; paribhogika stupas contain objects that once belonged to a holy person; and uddesika stupas indicate a sacred site and remind the believer of an event that happened there. Thus, one could speak of body stupas, object stupas, and sign (or memorial) stupas.42 These three categories do not closely co- incide with our variants of meaning and function delineated above - holy person, holy object, holy site. For one thing, the topic here is a different one, but the categories partially overlap and point in the same direction. At any rate, it is important to see that a certain motif or iconographical el- ement can belong to several categories at the same time, and have several aspects. A strict categorization is not possible, nor would it make sense. The point is to grasp the basic possibilities that often cross each other, mingle, and overlap, and to reach the deepest meanings inherent in them and un- folding through them. GENESIS OF THE BUDDHA IMAGE The development of Mahayana doctrines, and the increasing influence of folk piety, with its need for devout submission (bhakti) to and offerings (pijd) to merciful saviors, led to the creation of the iconic, personal Bud- dha image in human shape. The development of Jain and Hindu cult 41 Zimmer: Art of Indian Asia, vol. I, p. 233; Coomaraswamy: Elements, p4. This dis- tinction is attributed to the Buddha in the Maha-Parinibbana-Sutta (Benisti, &lt; Etude sur le Stupa, , p. 50). 42 The memorial stupa seems to be older than the reliquary stupa with the corporeal presence of the Buddha (Dutt: Buddhist Monks, p. I83 ff.). The latter concept with its material aspect is at first considered suitable only for the laymen who need a cult, but not for the monks who have a spiritual understanding of the ungraspable Bud- dha. In the Nirvana-Sutra (V 16-22), the Buddha does indeed speak of (memorial) stupas at the sites of the four great events (Birth, Enlightenment, First Sermon, Nir- vana). Foucher is of the opinion (Beginnings of Buddhist Art, p. ioff.) that the wor- ship of these sites had its origin in the memory of these events and that subsequently they attained ever more symbolic and universal validity. However, in the present study, these religious-historic developments are not taken into consideration. 47</page><page sequence="46">figures occurred in a parallel fashion, since the believers' demand for a per- sonal object of devotion displaced ascetic early Buddhism's limited sym- bols of the unimaginable and unrepresentable. Deeply rooted concepts of popular religion are traditionally prone to anthropomorphic representa- tion; they well up powerfully and transform - socially as well as philo- sophically - the ?higher&gt; art forms which prefer the abstract sign and symbol. Popular deities and genii, such as mother goddesses and yaknas, developed theologically as well as iconographically into deities of high rank. A yaksa type could turn into a Siva type - or indeed, in a Buddhist context, into a Bodhisattva. The elements needed for anthropomorphic representation are readily available in older art. Standing Naga figures like the ones on a relief from Pataliputra43 (third to early second centuries B.C.) are common. Seated figures of rulers appear on coins from about IOO B.C.44 On later coins (first or second centuries A.D.) that type of figure is changed to the Buddha enthroned on a lotus flower, beside which the old symbol of the fenced-in tree is occasionally still present. The type of the seated asce- tic and teacher is easily adapted to a Buddha, as can be seen in a Bharhut relief dating to the early second century B.C. showing the Brahman hermit Digha with his disciples. (This is perhaps aJataka illustration in which the Bodhisattva appears as Brahman.) The seated ascetic figure had already been prefigured divine form on the famous seal from Mohenjodaro.45 After all, even in the earliest Jataka illustrations the Buddha (or more precisely the Bodhisattva) appears as a human figure. The oldest representations of the Buddha46 occur sporadically since the first century B.C. but mainly in the first century A.D. and especially in the early second - while aniconic Buddhism is still in full bloom, and the same applies to the early Jain representations on the Ayagapata-reliefs47. By the second century A.D., the Buddha image in human form is fully developed in the north at Mathura and in the Gandhara region, in the south in Andhra at Amaravati and Nagarjunakonda, and it soon spreads to Sri Lanka as well. The various types of images created at these original sites then begin their 43 Coomaraswamy: Origin of the Buddha Image, fig. 24. 44 Ibid., fig. 6-Io, esp. 9 and Io. 45 Ibid., fig. 27; Coomaraswamy: Sculpture de Bharhut, fig.

The image could be admitted without misgivings since in Hinayana, and in early Mahayana too, the Buddha rep- resented in an image is considered as a rZpa-kaya, as a transient epiphany invisible after death. Only much later, around 400 A.D., does the Three- Bodies (trikdya) doctrine give rise to the problem of if and how the true Buddha body is to be represented. At the beginning of the Buddhist iconic tradition, no such problem exists48. Gradually, the symbols of early Buddhist art disappear as the iconic representation progresses (in Gandhara, those symbols rarely occur, be- cause that region does not know a pre-Kanishka aniconic phase). In the il- lustrative or narrative scenes they are no longer needed, since the Buddha appears in human form, and as cult objects they are largely, but not com- pletely, replaced by the figural cult images. To be sure, some of the sym- bols live on to this day, especially the footprints, the wheel, and the stupa (not to mention such ubiquitous signs as the lotus, the triratna, and the svastika, as well as the popular cult of holy trees). Those symbols are significant concentrations of important Buddhist doctrines, highly charged with meaning, especially after they have been detached from the illustra- tive context and used independently, as mentioned above. We shall give examples of this continuous existence in the art of later Hinayana and es- pecially Mahayana Buddhism. At the same time, we will also have to dis- cuss the rise of new symbols. The new iconography is usually called Mahayanist, but in many as- pects it is just as valid for the so-called Hinayana or Theravada regions. But before it is fully developed, there is a transitional phase during which the aniconic symbol and the iconic image exist side by side, often at the same monument, even in closely adjacent picture frames. Some examples: in the line of Buddhas of the Past, stupas no longer alternate with trees (see above) but with seated figures until all six or seven Buddhas of the Past appear in human form.49 On a torana cross-railing from Mathura,50 the Buddha sits in a cave and receives the visit of Indra; he is represented in human form, one of the earliest examples of personal representation. Yet, on the back- side of the same railing, the old symbols - tree(-sanctuary), wheel, and stupa - can be seen. A relief from an Amaravati stupa (I11. 52)5' shows an enthroned Buddha figure in the lower part, and above it a wheel column with an empty throne and footprints in front.

(Incidentally, his feet stand upon two lotus flow- ers, one of the earliest examples of this motif to indicate walking, later to become popular.) The former relief dates to the second century, the other most likely to the third. In this period, the decisive step toward the per- sonal Buddha image is taken everywhere, and its main types - the Buddha seated, standing, and walking in the typical positions of meditation, teach- ing, and protection-granting - are created in this formative phase of the 52 Madras, Museum; Rowland: Art andArchitecture, p. 70; Zimmer: Art of Indian Asia, vol. 2, p. 96. vol. 2, pl. 96. 50</page><page sequence="49">54a 54a.

Then a Buddha sits on the throne; his figure, endowed with a nimbus, dominates the scene. The tree re- I .

(This important phase is represented by the Bodhisattva figures [in fact Buddhas] of Katra and Ahichchatra [I11. 54a] near Mathura.)53 In the next phase, only Pipal leaves on the nimbus remain, until they, too, disappear. Later, another combination of figure and symbol occurs, still strongly influenced *IBi- b by the idea of the cosmological world axis and ,.'- S _ - .~~the universal ruler. On a relief in front of the Caitya Hall at Karli54 dating to the Gupta pe- riod (ca. fourth century), the teaching Buddha is enthroned on a lotus flower above a column with a small wheel, taking the place where the large and predominant symbol of the doctrine used to stand. Thus the symbol is displaced by the figure; what remains of the sym- bol is only a small token. Yet even in much later times the Buddha (or a Bodhisattva embodying his absolute wisdom) can still be associated with the column, as shown by the inscribed &lt;victory column&gt; (jaya-stambha) on the Javanese Mafijusri statue of Kerulak;55 and we have already men- tioned that the Lotus Sutra calls the Buddha a &lt;gold column. &gt; Many small wheel symbols56 appear on the dais of Buddha statues from Mathura, Gandhara (Ill. 54a, b), and in many later works as well (for in- 53 Rowland: Art and Architecture, pl. 46; Zimmer: Art, vol. 2, pl. 71; Hartel/Auboyer: Indien und Suidostasien, ill. 43. 54 Rowland: Art and Architecture, pl. 88b; Zimmer: Art, vol. 2, pl. 80; Rau: Kunst In- diens, pl. 40. 55 Auboyer: Le trone, p.

Often standing on columns and flanked by deer or worshippers, the wheels can be regarded as attribute-like additions serving to define the image's meaning more precisely; unless, that is, one prefers to see them as continuing symbols of the Buddhist doc- trine. In any case, the function of this wheel symbol vacillates in meaning between the sermon scene, the indication of the site, the sign of the doc- trine as such, and the cult object being offered puijd; but it certainly no longer rprresents the Buddha. However, in one of the rare Gandharan an- iconic representations, we see a pillar with three (!) large wheels on top be- ing worshipped by monks and other believers (Ill. 55). It would be tempt- ing to interpret the three wheels as a symbol of the doctrine and also, in a wider sense, of the ?Three Jewels?&gt;&gt; (triratna) - Buddha, Dharma, and Community -, if not at the same time two footprints at the base of the col- umn most likely would indicate the person of the Buddha. Generally, how- ever, the old wheel symbol is used only as an attribute added to a figure or scene already clearly defined iconographically. In the same manner the stupa symbol is often added above or below a Nirvana image (the death of the Buddha). The stuipa proclaims the central idea of the Nirvana scene, but it is also meant as cult object because believers worship it; reliquaries, too, are used in the same way. The wheel symbol appears in a very literal way - like a stage prop - when the preaching Buddha touches the wheel in front of him; it is atop a small column flanked by deer, and his hands (Ill. 56) literally set the wheel in motion (Gandhara). A completely differ- ent situation is depicted when - for example in relief carvings from Gand- hara, Mathura, or Amaravati - divine beings in heaven are shown adoring the Buddha's alms bowl or his turban above worship scenes with Buddha figures.57 The bowl and the turban are objects which could never represent 54bk~~j;?''iiSa:~],~ s tance at Ajant~, f~~~~ifth to sxhcnuy.

Taxila, Museum. the person of the Buddha; clearly, as the first relics of the Buddha, they have remained cult objects. A symbol seen on the pedestal of Buddha figures in Gandharan art, but seemingly nowhere else, is the column-shaped fire al- tar, usually flanked by worshippers on both sides (I11. 57).58 This altar is hardly to be understood as an incense altar; it is an Iranian symbol of Ahura- Mazda, stemming from the Zoroastrian fire cult, and occuring on Kushan coins, too, as a ruler's attribute. To be sure, the fire rite is quite common in ancient Indian cults, but this aniconic symbol is associated with the Buddha because, for his worshippers in the Kushan empire, he is equal to Ahura-Mazda as a supreme power. The flame symbolism can be found else- where as well in connection with Gandharan Buddha figures. These preliminary phases in the evolution of Buddhist symbolism reflect experiments with new thoughts and concepts as well as differences of doctrine among various believers' communities ( sects &gt;&gt;) and monastic centers. After these phases, the personal representation soon comes to be considered as a matter of course and is even said to date from the lifetime of the Buddha. Indeed, the Buddha himself is said to have declared that the making of his effigy is necessary for the continuation and the dissemina- tion of the faith, and that the making of such effigies is not only allowed, 57 Bachhofer: Early Indian Sculpture, vol. 2, pi. 1o3; Ingholt: Gandharan Art, fig. 230 (chalice in a shrine) and pl.

If the dogmatic argument for aniconic represen- tation is, as mentioned in the beginning of this paper, that the Buddha, upon entering into Nirvana, could no longer be compared with anything, and that he could not be grasped in any way, the worship of images is de- fended by a counter-argument clearly expressed in an inscription on a Chi- nese Buddha figure dated to 746 in the Museum of East Asian Art, Berlin:6o &lt;&lt;The highest truth is without image.

I8. 54</page><page sequence="53">Aniconism in Later Buddhist Art A PRINCIPLE THAT TRANSCENDS HISTORY Aniconic symbolism spans a historic phase in early Buddhist art that is fairly precisely delimited. To assume, however, that the old symbols were abandoned with the advent and the subsequent permanent dominion of the Buddha image would be quite wrong. To a certain extent, aniconic sym- bols remain valid as a principle beyond history. The symbols are not sim- ply replaced by figural images. True, images take the place of most aniconic symbols, but the old motifs nonetheless retain a part of their functions and even gain new meanings: not instead of or beside iconic images, but rather on a level of meaning higher than that of representational art. Thus, the symbol occupies a place in Buddhist art not only before (historically), but also beyond (transhistorically) the image. In due course, aniconic symbol- ism will again become the characteristic sign of a historically clearly defined phenomenon, Zen Buddhism. In the following, we will give examples of the significant role of ani- conic symbolism during the centuries from the creation of the Buddha im- age until the time when Zen Buddhism offers a dialectical challenge to that image. Such examples can be chosen at random from several centuries, several &lt;sects,?&gt; and from several countries of the Buddhist ecumenical community, since the aspects in question here are valid throughout, vary- ing only insignificantly. In later Buddhism - in so-called Hinayana as well as Mahayana, and especially in Vajrayana - the highest goal of salvation and the central reli- gious concept remains Nothingness, the emptiness of Nirvana. This emptiness, embodied, manifested, and personalized in the Buddha - or rather in the countless Buddhas - becomes visible and effective in the Bud- dha's image. To be sure, the most perfect Buddha images, in their strongly idealized and formalized artistic appearance, are removed from the sphere of empirical reality (i.e. the samsdra realm) to such an extent that due to their transcendence and abstraction they attain the character of symbols. But for the strict and consistent Buddhist to reach the highest level of knowledge, even these subliminal images are only an expedient, a useful aid (updya-kausalya) of quite preliminary, inessential nature. The image's 55</page><page sequence="54">essential purpose is to help the believer overcome all sensory, form-bound perception. For the less advanced devotee, however, the Buddha appearing in the image is a merciful power, a savior who can be approached in pious devotion (bhakti) and by many cultic acts (pijd). This more or less popu- lar religious attitude has mainly sustained Buddhist art for all time. For the higher insights, however, images are no longer necessary; indeed, they are detrimental. The less image-bound (i.e. the less tied to and tarnished by the elements of the illusory realm of phenomena), the purer the medi- tative view and the liberating perception. Although images can serve as supports in this process, image-less signs are better supports because they facilitate the step towards salvation in &lt;extinction. &gt; In order to understand mature Mahayana Buddhism, it is important to grasp the doctrine of the levels of perception, i.e. the meditation and con- sciousness levels that are called &lt;worlds? (dhdtu). Of especial note are the three steps leading towards an ever-stronger ability to overcome form. The first is the kama-dhatu (the world of sensory perception and desire). The second is rZpa-dhdtu (the world of purified form). The third is ar7pa-dhdtu (the world of purely spiritual non-form), which leads to the highest state, nirodha-dhdtu (the world of extinction), which is identical with Nirvana. Closely related is the doctrine of the three bodies (tri-kdya), or the Bud- dha's three forms: the nirmdna-kdya (incarnation body), manifest in the em- pirical world; sambhoga-kdya (transfiguration body), revealing itself to the visionary eye in far-off realms of bliss; and the dharma-kaya (body of ab- solute essence), completely inaccessible to sensory perception. The higher these levels, the more they are removed from the world of forms and phe- nomena, culminating radically in the dharma-kdya, the absolute truth be- yond human understanding, but absolutely present, manifesting himself in, and at the same time encompassing, all other Buddhas. One of the Chi- nese pilgrims' inscriptions at Bodhgaya,6' the site of Sakyamuni's enlight- enment, says about the dharma-kdya: ?It resides at all times beyond this world; at its holy site, it is not really present. &gt; In esoteric Buddhism, Va- jrayana, this principle is called Vairocana or Vajrasattva, and thought of as the uncreated, unborn, primeval Buddha (ddi-buddha), without beginning whatsoever. And because of its universalistic-cosmological aspect, it is also called the universal Buddha. &gt; The more abstract a visual sign is, the truer and more effective it is. An image fulfills its purpose all the more if it reaches the boundary of all form, and allows the step into the realm beyond all form. There, spiritual con- cepts, too, are extinct, and all image-related and image-supported medi- tation is surpassed. Beyond all images, even the most sublime ones, there 61 Edouard Chavannes: &lt;Les Inscriptions Chinoises de Bodhgaya, , p. 8 ff. 56</page><page sequence="55">is always one more step; the image can never be the final point at which re- ligious aspiration may stop and be content. The unlimited dialectical progress beyond any seemingly final position, i.e. beyond even the most perfected Buddha image, is what makes the aniconic principle indispensa- ble here, too. It hints at the basically invisible and ungraspable truth in such a way as to avoid the spiritual impediments of images. Every image, even the most sublime one, remains a &lt;&lt;mere image,&gt; since true shape is shapeless. If the image is to fulfil its highest task, it has to transcend itself and become superfluous, and the believer is supposed to follow if he wants to reach higher religious levels and the highest goal, i.e. enlightenment. Countless texts and above all the religious practice of the Buddhist world attest to the correctness of this way of spiritual training. (Incidentally, sim- ilar principles apply within the philosophical-mystic schools of Hin- duism.) From the viewpoint of the liberated, enlightened consciousness, all im- ages lack essence and true reality. Pratimd - image, effigy - is only an apparent likeness of a temporary phenomenon, a particular aspect, an ephemeral manifestation of reality and truth whose totality and absolute- ness cannot be grasped in this way. The image is thus not highly esteemed, and Sanskrit terms such as pratibimba (reflection) or pratirzipa (likeness) carry, beside their neutral meaning of &lt; image of a real object, representa- tion, effigy, &gt; a clearly deprecatory nuance. The image does not contain any truth; it is a shadow or a mirror-image, a mirage, a copy, maybe even a counterfeit. In the merely phenomena-bound apparition of the Buddha, his true essence (buddhatd) remains ungraspable. Thus there is the theory of the three phases of the development of the Buddha doctrine, between the proclamation of the faith by Sakyamuni and the saving appearance of Maitreya. At first the true and genuine doctrine appears, then the formal- istic-imitative one, and finally the doctrine suited to the degenerated final stage. The second phase is called, characteristically, pratirzipaka-dharma (or saddharma-pratirzipaka), i.e. merely copy-like, inessential, falsified doc- trine, in which the truth can no longer be grasped. To be sure, the image, a manifestation of the highest truth, can serve as an implement in cult practice or as an aid for meditation. (It is thus akin to the yantra, a geometrical diagram often used in meditation, and thought to possess occult powers.) In Mahayana, it is widely believed that the im- age partakes of the bodily presence of the Buddha and other holy persons, and that in extreme cases it can achieve a kind of image-magic. The cus- tomary &lt; eye opening &gt; ceremony upon completion of a statue (by painting in the eye pupils) testifies especially to this striving for personification, an- imation, and the ritually effective presence of the one depicted in the im- age. When the image has been created in an effort to achieve correctness 57</page><page sequence="56">and fidelity to the &lt;&lt;original&gt;&gt; - as ?&lt;likeness&gt;&gt; (pratima)62 - it serves as an instrument that assists believers to identify themselves spiritually with the holy being who is visually represented. But a sign without figural likeness (i.e. a symbol) is a better yantra, especially in the pure form of a geometri- cal diagram by which the believer's spirit is led right up to the boundary of visual perception, and incited to cross it. A good example is the man- dala, which is most useful when it no longer depicts the countless figures of the Buddhist &lt; pantheon, &gt; but rather shows more or less abstract sym- bols. Each of the holy beings is assigned a symbol and a holy word (mantra) containing the being's pure essence and providing a ritually effective for- mula, also called bija (&lt;&lt; germ ? or &lt;&lt; seed &gt;), which take the form of a a writ- ten character (siddham, see below). Together with the mandala and mantra there are such ritual physical acts as mudrds, symbolic gestures in which the essence and the acts of the holy beings are enclosed and &lt; sealed. ? Accord- ingly, the Tibetans (but it applies everywhere) differentiate between sku- rten, ?physical supports,&gt; i.e. images; gsung-rten, &lt;verbal supports,&gt; i.e. texts and sacred formulas; and thugs-rten, ?spiritual supports,? i.e. sym- bols such as the stupa.63 According to the Maha-Vairocana-Sutra, the fol- lowing three: aksara (sound, word, or written character), mudrd (symbolic gesture), and pratikrti (image), consitute the three forms of the mystical body of every Buddha.64 They can take each other's place, are identical in their essence, and are all three rooted in the ungraspable nature of the Bud- dha who is in turn but a &lt; sign, &gt; a &lt;&lt; reflection &gt; of the absolute truth. Even in later Buddhism, then, the tendency towards avoiding images and the inclination to rank symbols higher than figural images are princi- ples rooted deeply in Buddhism's religious-philosophical convictions and in experience of meditative exercises. These principles remain valid from the image-less symbol in early Buddhism to the image-less symbol in later stages, and the history of Buddhist art stretches from the not-yet-image to the not-anymore-image, across a richly unfolding world of imagery and be- yond. A radical Buddhist could very well say - and many Zen followers did indeed say - that any Buddha image is bound to be completely devoid of value and therefore superfluous for higher understanding. 62 Zimmer: Kunstform und Yoga, pp. 28, 102. 63 Denwood: The Tibetan Temple, p. 47. 64 Tajima: Les deux grands Mandalas, p. 39; Maha-Vairocana-Sutra, chapter 28 (Taisho Tripitataka, vol.

We shall limit ourselves to symbols that represent the Buddha himself (or the Buddhas themselves) and the &lt;&lt;Buddha-nature? (bud- dhatd), i.e. symbols which have a fundamental, central, and universal meaning referring directly to the person or the idea of the Buddha. His- torically, the symbols in question can be divided into two groups: those taken over from the iconography of early Buddhism, and those newly cre- ated or adopted; Vajrayana Buddhism in particular is strongly influenced by Hinduism and it has taken over many of its symbols - including Tantric sexual motifs. But of all these symbols, only a small number fall within the scope of our topic. Among the most important symbols of the personal, blissful presence of the Buddha are still the footprints (Buddha-pdda). They are found every- where in the Buddhist world, especially in the regions of the Pali tradition but also in East Asia. Shown usually in pairs and made of various materi- als, they appear in sanctuaries and also in the open air, where they are of- ten carved into the rock in colossal size. The faithful believe that such foot- prints had been imprinted like seals by the Buddha during his visits to these countries (in Thailand, there are figures showing the Buddha in this act).65 The most famous example is the footprint on Adam's Peak in Sri Lanka - although Hindus attribute it to Siva, Muslims to Adam, Chris- tians to either the apostle Thomas or to the devil.66 Many examples can be traced to the legend in which the Buddha, during his last sojourn in the land of Magadha and just before he entered Nirvana in Kusinagara, is said to have left his footprint in Pataliputra (Patna) out of mercy for all beings and for their salvation. In 645, the famous Chinese monk Xuanzang brought a rubbing or a drawing of this footprint to the Tang capital Chang'an, where he deposited it. Various copies were made to the same scale, the most famous among them on the holy Mount of Wutai. From Chang'an, the footprints reached Japan, too; in 752, they were carved into a stone slab at Yakushiji near Nara,67 and praised in a number of poems (purportedly by the Empress K6myo). The footprints (length: 48 cm) and a second stone slab with the poems can still be seen there. The large seated 65 Theodore Bowie: The Arts of Thailand, Bloomington I960, fig.

In early Buddhist art - in illustrative scenes or as independent repre- sentations (one of the earliest examples is from Amaravati; Ill. 59) - the footprints are often adorned with the wheel symbol alone. Later, seven or eight symbols became customary: beside the wheel are the vajra (see be- low), the trisula, the svastika, the umbrella, the vase, a pair of fish, and a conch. Several of these symbols entered Buddhist iconography relatively late. As we have seen, the wheel can represent the Buddha himself origi- nally, but then also it becomes one of the magic marks on his person and is counted in the group of &lt;&lt;Thirty-Two Great Signs &gt; (mahalaksana) of his body. Applied to the footprint, the wheel, as well as the other signs, retains much its original function to guarantee the presence of the Buddha almost magically. In South-East Asia (especially Sri Lanka, Cambodia, Thailand, and Burma), large footprints can be found everywhere, sometimes on giant re- clining figures of the Buddha entering Nirvana but also as isolated cult ob- jects (Ill. 6o, 6i). The soles can carry no fewer than io8 symbols repre- senting the complete cosmos in space and time. At the center of the cosmos the Buddha occupies the ruler's position, and with his footprint he &lt; seals &gt; the spot where the sphere beyond this world touches our visible world, the spot from which we can transcend our world.68 The trace &gt; - the visible, testifying legacy of an absent or non-graspable being - is thus situated in 68 Characteristically, in Burmese temples the footprints are sometimes painted on the ceiling; Gordon H.

But for popular piety, the footprints of the Buddha are still the guarantee of salvation and the redemption of all sins offered by his teaching. In a very early layer underlying these beliefs, the footprints, as well as the handprints, certainly had a magic and especially apotropaic function. The wheel, too, is one of the symbols that have remained valid at all times in the Buddhist world. It usually represents the Buddhist doctrine, but its old meaning of solar wheel and ruler's symbol also still applies at times. For instance when the Adi-Buddha Vairocana, whose name is trans- lated in East Asia as &lt; Great Sun, &gt; seated in the center of the Garbhadhatu Mandala, holds in his hand the wheel, it is an attribute (or rather an im- personal symbol) of himself, not a symbol of the Buddhist doctrine. As one of the Seven Treasures of the cakravartin, the wheel can still be seen in the arts of the Tang Dynasty, e.g. in a painting from Dunhuang.69 In concen- trated shape, the wheel rests on a short column standing on a throne pedestal among the symbols of the mandala (Ill. 62).

In the iconography of esoteric Buddhism, the wheel occurs everywhere, for instance on a lotus flower with aureole (I11. 63) or as simple, six-spoked gilt-bronze cult implement lying on the altar to be handled by the priest during the ritual.70 In the end, the wheel assumes the character of an or- nament used for all Buddhist utensils; in Japan, it can even be a family crest, the only specifically Buddhist heraldic motif.7' (In contrast, the widely disseminated bhava-cakra, the wheel of life, is not the symbol of the Buddha having entered Nirvana, but rather the symbol of the samsdra cy- cle; when the Buddha is represented there, he stands outside the wheel.) Equally ubiquitous is the old, pivotal symbol of the stipa. As tomb and reliquary,72 it is closely linked to the person and the holy body of the en- lightened Buddha. As Nirvana symbol, it represents the highest ideal of that religion and signals the reaching of its spiritual goal. Thus, the stfipa is the cult center of the monastery (vihdra) from the beginning, and in one way or another it remains an almost indispensable part of a Buddhist tem- ple compound, even after cult images, especially in the Mahiyina regions, gained in importance. In the countries of the so-called Hinayana tradition, such as Sri Lanki, Thailand, or Burma, the personal cult image and the stipa correlate and complement each other, but the former, despite its great numbers, can never rival the stipa. The coexistence of stiupa and cult image can be seen in India from the second and third centuries A.D. on- 70 Ishida: Mikkyj higu, ills. 337-359; Seckel: Buddhistische Kunst Ostasiens, ill.

Borobudur, Java: the upper- most terraces. ivt '64 '-" ' ward. At the front of the stuipas (or their representations in reliefs) in Amaravati, Nagarjunikonda, and later in Ajanta and Ellura, the figure of the Buddha appears. The Buddha is to be thought present in the stupa and manifesting himself from inside it (Ill. 38). But in Nagarjunikonda, stuipa and cult image are kept apart; two chapels, one for the stupa and one for the cult image, are placed opposite each other as equal votive centers.73 At Borobodur in Java (ca. 8oo00), an organic identity still exists between Bud- dha symbol and Buddha image. On the three uppermost circular terraces (Ill. 64) - above the narrative relief carvings of the lower spheres - Bud- dha statues are placed into latticed stupas, hidden yet half-visible and thus in a way half-iconic and separated from the realm of ephemeral phe- nonomena. But in the highest, central stupa with solid walls, there may or may not have been a Buddha statue (completely invisible). Whether there was a Buddha inp he top Buda is ute but en te thtoat symbol and figure can be replaced and exchanged with each other, the question is irrelevant. The presence of a figural image in the non-figural stupa remains a valid principle of later Buddhism in all regions, even in the pagodas of East Asia. The facet that the stupa ad th udden yet half-vle and th uex- changeable is clearly seen in Burmese cult implements in the shape of bronze lotus blossoms (Ill. 65).74 These devices can be opened and closed mechanically and contain inside either a Buddha figure or a stupa in the center, surrounded by the eight main scenes of the Buddha's life on eight 73 Seckel: Kunst des Buddhismus, text fig. 32. 74 Luce: Old Burma - Early Pagan (see note 67), vol. 3, pl. 426; Shorto: &lt;The Stupa as Buddha Icon; , cf.

These scenes (or four of them) are often shown on votive stupas as well.75 All this testifies to the direct relation be- tween the Nirvana symbol and the person of the Buddha. That is to say, one can indeed talk about &lt;the stupa as Buddha image&gt;&gt; (Shorto; see note 74); but since the symbol is of a higher rank, the personal image can more easily be dispensed with. ; | - i . The Indian stuipa's basic circu- a lar, hemispherical shape is taken I . over and somewhat modified and 65 enriched in south-east Asian countries (especially Sri Lanka, Burma, and Thailand) and in Tibet. In East Asia, however, the stupa undergoes dras- tic structural changes resulting in the tower-shaped, multi-storied pagoda developed in China and adopted in Korea and Japan.76 In its fully devel- oped stage, the East Asian pagoda consists of a central pillar rising from the foundation to the peak. Constructed around this central pillar are sev- eral stories of four, eight, or twelve sides, a design that represents the world structured around its axis and thus resembling a mandala in its floor plan as well as in its iconological significance. There is an identity between the axis and the Buddha; the Buddha is allied to the axis in his relics or in the shape of an image. He is represented by the axis; indeed, he is present in it. On the ground floor of the Tahoto,77 a special type of pagoda often seen in Japan, the central pillar does not reach down to the foundation; there it is replaced by a statue representing the absolute Buddha Vairocana, shown as though in the center of a mandala. In China, Korea, and Japan, from the center of a pagoda - whether figure, core pillar, or aniconic relic - the Bud- dha nature emanates in all directions as symbolized by the small Buddha figures sculpted or painted on the walls. Basically, in most cases, the pagoda remains a receptacle for relics. In- side the foundation stone or in other places, Buddha relics are deposited in precious containers (Ill. 66). The Buddha is thus bodily present and in in- timate relation with the world axis. A type of stupa-shaped reliquary pop- ular in India and other Buddhist countries is represented in Japan by magnificent examples (Ill. 67). The spherical stupa body is still recogniz- 65.

This symbolizes the physical universe as identified with the mystic body of Vairocana, the universal Buddha, who is present also in the relics. In con- trast to other types of tombs, such as those of Egypt or China which copy iconically real or imaginary structures, the Buddhist type may be called an- iconic. It does not belong to the realm of the deceased person, nor does it establish a relation to any imagined world of the dead; rather, it relates to the complete extinction in Nirvana, unimaginable and unrepresentable. While Buddha is represented aniconically in such symbols as the foot- prints or the stapa, sometimes a Buddha statue used for worship attains life and ritual validity only when relics are deposited in the body or in the pedestal. As is frequently the case in gri Lanka, they are enclosed in a stone case (yantragala) subdivided into smaller sections arranged like a mandala. The yantragala is a symbol of the power and presence of the Buddha and si- multaneously of the cosmic universe across which the world-transcendent (lokottara) Buddha statue rises.78 In many Buddhist countries, Buddha 78 Dohanian: ,The Colossal Buddha,,, p.

In the mandalas of Esoteric Buddhism in East Asia, the Adi-Buddha Vairocana can be symbolized by a stupa (Ill. 71). The lotus seat, flaming au- reole, and vajra indicate that this stupa connotes the non-personal numen that can be represented only aniconically, as the ungraspable, absolute Bud- dha present in all things of this world. The identity of the Buddha (espe- cially Vairocana) with the universe is often shown by figures, scenes, and especially symbols on his body or attire, the iconography of which charac- terizes him clearly as embodiment of the world in its entirety and, on oc- casion, as world ruler (cakravartin) (11. 72).79 79 Auboyer: Le Trone, p. 148ff.

Frequently, however, the diagrams show not the figures themselves but their symbols; some- times, but not always, those symbols are identical with objects associated with those sacred beings. Such diagrams are usually called samaya- mandala8? (Ill. 73 a, b). Samaya - literally &lt; agreement, &gt; &lt; convention , - means in this case a sign or symbol containing and bringing to the fore the real nature of a holy figure; hence samaya-kdya, symbol-body. ? For ex- ample, the stupa, as mentioned above, is a symbol for Vairocana, as is the wheel, which can also appear at the center of a mandala. Above all, how- ever, mandala diagrams reveal how the fully developed Mahayana, espe- cially its esoteric forms, created a large repertory of new, specific symbols, or took them over from other realms, e.g. Hinduism. 8I 73 a.

Originally the .. ..thunder and lightning bolt of Indra, the vajra is also interpreted as a diamond because it resem- bles the purity, firmness, indestructibility, and enlightenment power of absolute truth and the immutable, adamantine essence of all being.

It appears prominently in mandalas, and its name appears in the term Vajrayana (? Thunderbolt Vehicle ?), which is a synonym for Esoteric Buddhism. Mandalas are ubiquitous in Buddhist art and architecture. The floor plan of a sanctuary can constitute a mandala in abbreviated form. The cen- tral pillar of a Japanese pagoda can represent Vairocana and the world axis as well; the central pillar, the other pillars, and the iconographical content of the wall paintings then constitute in their totality a mandala.82 Ma. .alas show a gradation in character from highest absraction and ultimate meta- physical rank down to image-figural manifestation, as described in Esoteric Buddhist sources.83 The Dharma-Mandala contains purely conceptual writ- ten characters which constitute the mantras of the various beings (see be- ten characters which constitute -the mantras of the various beings (see be- 80 Lokesh Chandra: The Esoteric Iconography, pl. 222ff.

Tajima: Les Deux Grands Mandalas, p. 197 ff. 81 To discuss the other symbols here individually would be well beyond the scope of this paper. In the mandalas, the divine figures can be specified by such symbols, some of them representational, some of them half or completely abstract. Such symbols were compiled in voluminous iconographical catalogues for use in the art workshops of the monasteries. In Japan, a great number of such works are extant, partly based on Chinese models or Chinese originals brought to Japan. They have been collected in a comprehensive publication: Taishoshinshu daizokyo, zuzo (see bibl.); cf. Hamada: Zuzo. 82 Seckel: Kunst des Buddhismus, p.

This in turn allows the last and decisive step into absolute emptiness. Therefore the holy beings, or rather their essential nature, can also be represented in the mandalas by purely geometric structures. The triangle (trikona) plays an important role in that respect. In the iconography of Esoteric Buddhism (apart from cor- responding phenomena in Hindu, especially Tantric, symbolism), the tri- angle has at least three meanings. First, fire and the fire god Agni; second, Vidyaraja Acalanatha (J: Fudo Myoo), who is also associated with fire and whose image is circumscribed by an aureole of flames84; and third, Vairo- cana, who manifests himself in Agni as well as in Acala. In the case of Vairo- cana, the triangle can appear with its apex upwards or downwards, but we shall disregard the subtle speculations engendered by the position of the sign. Sometimes the Vairocana triangle - like the wheel, the stupa, or the vajra - stands on a lotus blossom as an a-personal &lt; numen &gt;&gt; (supernatural, holy being), the blossom again resting on a throne pedestal (Ill. 75). In the Garbhadhatu-Mandala, the triangle appears further in the horizontal field directly above the central square where Vairocana is enthroned on a lotus blossom. There, the triangle signifies the &lt;&lt;triangular wisdom fire&gt;&gt; of the Buddha, destroying all evil passions of living beings; it is called &lt;&lt; seal (sym- bol) of wisdom of all Tathagatas (Buddhas),? whose ultimate reason of be- ing lies in Vairocana. The triangle symbolizes the dharma-kdya, the ab- solute, ungraspable body of the Buddha.85 The most telling symbol for the all-encompassing universe transcend- ing all diversity, however, is the circle. In the oldest stupas - such as at Sanci - the circle appears, significantly, in the floor plan as well as in the contour of the main structure. This three-dimensionalized circle is recre- ated in time and function when the devotee performs the ritual of circum- ambulation (pradaksina). Iconographically - apart from sun and moon as symbols of various holy figures - the circle can be found first of all in the shape of the wheel, and above all in the shape of the nimbus, surrounding the head or frequently also the body of an enlightened one. The circle (i.e. the nimbus) transforms the corporeal figure into the qualitatively differ- ent category of a geometrical-abstract ideal shape. Sometimes, the nimbus can even represent the person of the Buddha, such as in the birth scene in a wall painting from Kyzil (Ill. 9) mentioned already above. At the same 84 Another Vidyaraja, Trailokya-vijaya (J: Go-sanze Myoo), is sometimes surrounded by a hemisphere. 85 For the triangle symbol in Tantric art (also non-Buddhist), see the exhibition cata- logue: Tantra, Stuttgart 1973; Zimmer: Kunstform und Yoga, pp. IOIff., I30ff., ill. 36. 71</page><page sequence="70">time, the nimbus emanates the light of wisdom, often in the form of dart- ing flames resulting in a pointed aureole; the aureole's core, however, is al- ways a circular nimbus, the prabhd-mandala (&lt; light circle&gt;). The doctrine and the iconography of the nimbus are developed into a complicated sys- tem in Mahayana, in which the symbolic motif of the circle is combined with the one of radiating light, splendor, and gold.86 Gold, the color of the Buddha's body, is called the ?true color?&gt; and serves as an important sym- bol of the absolute perfection of the Buddha, subject neither to tarnishing nor to refraction into the colors of the world of ephemeral phenomena. In- deed, an influential sutra is named after the luster of gold, Suvarna-prabh- asa. The concept of ? circle &gt; or ? round &gt; is important for the description of timeless eternity without beginning or end, of perfection, of the ulti- mate truth, of the intrinsic essence and its perception, since the circle is ?&lt;full?&gt; as well as ? empty. &gt; In Chinese texts of the East-Asian Mahayana canon, the following terms incorporate the concept of the circle87: the round doctrine or the round vehicle; the round enlightenment or wisdom (symbolized by the mirror, where the notion of reflected light is added); the round shining light (of the Buddha, i.e. the nimbus); the round Bud- dha (dharma-kdya); the round silence (Nirvana); the round fruit (also Nirvana, the ultimate, final result of religious seeking); the round empti- ness (often hinted at by an empty circle); the round triple truth (in which all particular aspects of the world, all one-sided ways of perception pene- trate and cancel each other). The circle itself is called a &lt;round (i.e. per- fect) sign?, (C: yuanxiang; J: enso) - strictly speaking a paradox since in Buddhism the signs (S: laksana) designate precisely the visible symbols, belonging to the world of ephemeral phenomena, and thus stand in con- trast to intrinsic nature, which is non-phenomenal and ?characteristic- less. &gt; However, since both stand in the dialectical relation of &lt; non-dual- ity,? the (relative) sign can be an (absolute) one as well and thus hint, by its perfection, at the otherwise ungraspable essence. No sign or symbol achieves this end better than the circle. The Sanskrit word mandala itself means ritual-magic circle. In Chinese terminology, it is also called ? round altar?, - not only because of its (original) shape, but also because the mandala is an all-encompassing, perfect image of the world. 86 Behrsing: &lt;Der Heiligenschein in Ostasien;?

The double ring of this mudra represents the two divergent but inseparable aspects of the world. Those two aspects, symbolized by the Garbhadhatu- and the Vaj- radhatu-Mandalas, still mean one and the same thing88. Some mudras im- itate old, traditional symbols - for instance the lotus, the wheel, or the vajra - but &lt;&lt;mudras with (visible) signs?, formed by the hands are trans- formed into the realm of the invisible by &lt;&lt; mudras without signs &gt; formed in the mind only. Thus there is, for non-figural symbols, yet another step upwards from image-bound sign to image-less sign. The symbol of the mudra, replete with and expressing the ultimate truth, is called &lt;&lt;seal, print&gt;&gt; (C: yin, J: in) or ?&lt;seal-sign &gt; (yinxiang/inzo), and this term reaches even further into the realm of the non-image. The es- sential nature of the Buddha (buddhatd), the true Dharma, the reality in- herent in all beings - immovable and unchangeable - is compared with the imprinted, ultimately valid, true, and legitimate seal, called the Bud- dha spirit (&lt;&lt;heart?) seal or Dharma seal (C: foxinyin; J: busshin'in).89 This spiritual seal is passed from the Buddha to the traditional line of patriarchs and masters. Each receives in turn the yinke/inka as testimony and approval of initiation and succession, although, to be sure, the certificate is but an outward document for the inward character attained by identity with the Buddha. Chan (Zen) followers in particular cultivate this custom and talk about the &lt;&lt;Buddha spirit seal&gt;&gt; or the ?&lt;spirit seal of the patriarchs &gt; as a sign of ultimate enlightenment. It is passed on in unchanging validity without word or image - an immediate &lt;transmission of the spirit by the spirit?&gt; - despite all personal embodiments and concrete images in space and time - eternally remaining the same beyond all visibility and shape. 88 Saunders: Mudra, p. 89 f.; for the following pp. 36, 38, 40, 99; Ui: Bukkyo jiten, p. 52 (see inzo). 89 Gundert: Bi-yan-lu, vol. 2, p. 123 ff. When Guo Ruoxu, an art writer of the eleventh century, called paintings and other art works ?&lt;heart (or spirit) seals,? it was hardly without allusion to such Buddhist concepts: &lt;It is first of all in the springs of the heart that one imaginatively creates forms and lines. Such lines ... are called its prints &gt; (yin; the Chinese word for ?&lt;lines &gt; is actually &lt; traces &gt; [ji] - a term that we will encounter in another context, too); Kuo Jo-hsii: Experiences in Painting, p. 15 (Chinese text, vol. I, p. 12). 73</page><page sequence="72">WORD, LETTER, SOUND Also prominent in Vajrayana are true, genuine words, ? the mystic-mag- ical syllables called mantra (hence another name, Mantrayana, for this movement in Buddhism) or dhdrani (a term derived from dhdra, hold- ing, supporting, containing &gt;). Used often in close conjunction with mu- dras, these syllables can be joined into long and complicated compounds. Words made up of mantra are artificially created; they are abstract words, supposed to exclude all intellectually graspable meaning inherent in reg- ular language, and thus they are removed from the world of samsara. Thus the word-symbol or word-body (mantra) is added to the figural image (pra- timd) and the physical symbol (mudrd). Word, image, and gesture are, af- ter all, the three forms or aspects of one and the same mystical body of every Buddha. Each holy being from the highest Buddha Vairocana on down- wards is assigned a syllable - in itself meaningless - such as a, a, om, um, va, vam, hum, hrh, sr, trim, kna, yam, in which the essence of the respective being reveals itself to the initiated in its highest purity, but invisible and shapeless. Therefore such a syllable is also called bija (bija-mantra, bija- aksara), seed or nucleus in which the essence is enclosed and from which the Buddha nature unfolds. Almost bursting with the essence, so to speak, the mantra has immense potency; it can be used not only for meditation but also for magical effect. The metaphysical meaning of bija is truth as principle and origin of being,&gt;&gt; and thus the content of Absolute Con- sciousness (alaya-vijndna) as &lt;seed,? i.e. basis and origin of all phenom- 76.

There are mandalas or parts of mandalas (I11. 76) consisting only of siddham letters in the form ofpaintings, drawings, embroideries, metal plaques, or stone engravings. A single sign can also serve as image-less cult image, for instance in the form of a metal plaque - often round and gilded - with an A or another siddham letter in relief or engraved. In paintings, for example, it can stand like a personal cult object with a nimbus on a lo- tus pedestal (11c. 78). leading directly to insight into the essence and to realization of essential unity between the Buddha present in the sign and the meditating believer, without any detour via the figural image.

On Japanese temple banners - often in =':~:'.?'th . embroidery - the rank order (and at the same time the triadic unity) of image/symbol/letter leading to ever-purer perception of the Bud- dha nature is clearly expressed by u showing the Buddha, Bodhisattva, . . or other figure at the bottom; the respective, still material-bound cult symbol above the figure; and on top the abstract siddham letter (I11. 8i). The figural image belongs to the open,&gt;&gt; exoteric, doctrine and serves as &lt;&lt;helping hand&gt;&gt; (updya-kausalya), while the symbols beyond the image have an esoteric character and are accessible only to initiated believers who have attained a higher understanding. The difference between exoteric and esoteric doctrine is essential for the understanding of many Buddhist (and non-Buddhist) phenomena, espe- cially in the Vajrayana (or Mantrayana) systems, and thus also for aniconic symbolism and its relation to figural representation. The &lt;&lt;seed? (bija) of the esoteric-mystic word, symbol, or letter unfolds or manifests itself exo- terically in figural appearance. Quite generally, Buddhism in its higher, non-popular levels tends to avoid images and refrain from anthropomor- phic formulation of the essential truth. Even the Pure Land of a Buddha, e.g. Amitabha, with its rich imagery full of figures, is by no means the ul- timate goal of salvation - according to the strict interpretation of doctrine. Nirvana is not yet reached from this preliminary level. The concept of ?par- adise&gt;&gt; serves above all to satisfy the popular longing for salvation and sub- mission to a savior. ? Paradise &gt; still belongs - as ? transformed apparition &gt; (bianxiang/henso) - to the world of forms (rfipa-dhatu) in which the sam- bhoga-kaya of a Buddha manifests itself (not to mention his nirmana-kdya belonging to the empirical world of apparitions). But all higher knowledge leads to the world of non-form (arzipa-dhdtu), and ultimately to the world of extinction (nirodha-dhatu), which is also the sphere of the dharma-kaya. But in later times, the aniconic written character was by no means used only by esoteric Vajrayana. It was also used by the Hokke sect, founded in the thirteenth century by Nichiren (1222-1282) inJapan. Basing its teach- ing exclusively on so-called Lotus Sutra (Saddharma-pun.darika-s-utra; J: My6h6-renge-ky6), the sect raised the siitra's five-syllable name, the ?

Although the letters used for this are ordinary Chinese characters, they are written in a special calli- graphic stylization based on Nichiren's handwriting and reserved for this 94 Wilhelm Gundert:Japanische Religionsgeschichte, Tokyo/Stuttgart I935 (new print- ing I943), p.

Like cult images, the characters can stand on a lo- tus pedestal surrounded by a nimbus (I11. 78). (The same happens in schools which worship the holy name ofAmitabha; J: Namu Amida-butsu). These characters are not so much supports for meditation as evocative formulas for recitation, as can be seen in the prefix namu (from the Sanskrit: namas, namah; Pali: namo; &lt;praised be ... &gt;. The central cultic act of the Nichiren faith is the repetition thousands of times of the formula &lt;&lt;Namu myoho- renge-kyo, &gt; inducing a trance-like condition in the believer. All this leads us from the realm of visual form into that of sound, reli- giously significant sound which serves as a non-figural, aniconic symbol. The invocation of a god with holy sounds or syllables (bzja-mantra or - aksara) in which he is represented and whose sublime body they form, is among the oldest Indian cult practices, where the nada-rzipa (the sound- form) corresponds to the devata-rzipa (the figural form of a god), audible form to the visible one. Sound is replete with the eternal, invisible power inherent in the cosmos determining its origin and its passing away; holy sounds, especially the syllable OM that encompasses cosmic and psychic to- tality, allow man to realize his essential unity with the cosmos (or the Brah- man).95 Sanskrit, the holy language of the Vedas, is the &lt;&lt;emanation of the being (sat) in sound and word (sabda); out of sound grows the power of the holy mantras and of the Vedic hymns to hit upon the living truth and to work magic. ,96 In Saiva myth, the sound of Siva's drum is an important part; sound and ether, the finest of all materials, constitute the primeval creative power with which the unfolding of the universe begins. Sound reveals divine truth, but, paradoxically, sound also expresses the highest silence of the absolute.97 Mutatis mutandis, Buddhism shares the same beliefs. A bzja-mantra is not only the invocation of a Buddha or another holy being, but it also rep- resents their essence in the image-less realm of pure sound. The sound, however, has an unmistakable ambivalence of meaning: on the one hand, &lt;&lt; sound &gt; or &lt;&lt; voice &gt; corresponds to &lt; color, &gt; i.e. - like fragrance, taste, and touch - it belongs to the world of samsara phenomena or the world of ephemeral &lt; dust, &gt; which tarnishes the &lt;&lt; heart, &gt; whose pure essence is sym- bolized by gold.98 The famous opening sentence of the ?&lt;Heike mono- gatari, &gt;&gt; the Japanese war epic of the thirteenth century, reads: &lt; Gion-shoja no/kane no koe/shogyo-mujo no/hibiki ari&gt;&gt; (&lt;&lt;The Gion Shoja [temple's] 95 Encyclopaedia of Buddhism, I I I / I, p. io8 ff. 96 Zimmer: Philosophie und Religion, p. 539. 97 Zimmer: Art of Indian Asia, vol.

And indeed it is said that the sound brings salvation, just as the sound of the conch shell trumpet of the lamaist cult is said to have the power to save the believer and bring him enlightenment.100 The lion-like and truth-pro- claiming voice is one of the Thirty-two Great Signs of the Buddha; who- ever hears that voice receives the fruit of the path,&gt;&gt; i.e. deliverance into Nirvana.101 The &lt;voice&gt;&gt; or the ?sound&gt; of Nirvana, however, is silence. Found in the doctrine and practice of Hindu Tantrism is the term &lt; sound (shabda) of the Brahman &gt;&gt;: while sounds heard by the ear originate by two objects colliding, the Brahman sound (om) is a andhata shabda, &lt;a sound made without two objects colliding &gt;; it is heard only in one's innermost being, in the heart-lotus.'02 Among Zen followers, andhata shabda is called, in the paradoxical abbreviation of the koan of Hakuin Ekaku (I685-1768): &lt;&lt;Listen to the sound of the single hand! &gt; (sekishu no onjo). And in the fa- mous haiku by Matsuo Basho (1644-1694), the silence of Being is heard in the soft sound of the frog leaping into the water.'03 In and behind the sounds of samsdra, the silence of Nirvana must be &lt;&lt;heard. &gt; Thus sound and non- sound have the same relation to each other as image and non-image, or the world of form and color to gold and the empty ground of a painting. There are numerous classic examples of silence as the last answer and highest statement: Sakyamuni silently holding aloft a flower and the silent-smil- ing understanding of his disciple Kasyapa; the ?thundering silence&gt; of Vimalakirti in answer to the Bodhisattva Mafijusri's question about the highest truth; and Huike's silence after his last encounter with Bodhi- dharma, to which the master replied: &lt;You have attained my marrow.&gt;&gt; 14 99 Translated after Wilhelm Gundert's German version: Die japanische Literatur (Hand- buch der Literaturwissenschaft), Wildpark/Potsdam I929, p. 79.

Other paths towards image-less and direct enlightenment (C: wu; J: go = satori), not to be de- scribed here, were preferred. And yet Zen, too, knew and used meaning- laden symbols and letters (and uses them to this day) - but their peculiar- ity in contrast to everything we have seen so far should be kept in mind. It is true that some Zen schools even used geometric symbols as help towards enlightenment; but such symbols do not play an important part because it was soon noticed that they tempt the believer into speculative distractions. It is significant that such symbols were used in the early Chi- nese Zen doctrine known as the Five Ranks (C: wuwei; J: goi), 05 notably by the Tang-period master Dongshan Liangjie (Tosan Ryokai, 807-869), the founder of the Caodong (Soto) sect. At this time Zen increasingly moved away from the metaphysical speculation of older, ultimately Indian Mahayana philosophy, yet still felt a need to create some teaching systems, although these systems were subsequently rejected by many as inessential and misleading. The teaching of the Five Ranks, devised as competitive to the abhidharma-kosa doctrine, can be summarized as follows, at the risk of over-simplification. The Absolute (the One, the principle at the basis of all existing matter and beings) manifests itself in all things of the universe, stands in mutually penetrating relation with the world of phenomena; ul- timately both are one. The world of phenomena is represented by an empty white circle, the Absolute by a circle filled in with black. When the Ab- solute enters into the world of phenomena, it becomes perceptible by means of this world; the symbol for that state is a circle filled in with black in its upper half, white in its lower half. When the world of phenomena is nec- essarily transcended in direction of the Absolute, which is after all con- tained in the phenomena and constitutes their basis, a circle with its lower half black, its upper half white is used. If the Absolute is considered purely in itself and in its original unity, prior to its unfolding in the world of phe- nomena, it appears as a black circle with a white border, alluding to its in- herent potential for unfolding. The relativity of the world of phenomena considered in itself- whose things become evident in their intrinsic Ab- solute-ness at this level of knowledge - is depicted in a reversed way, as a black circle with a white center, since the Relative is embedded in Ab- I05 Ibid., p.

Finally, on the highest level, the undifferentiated unity tran- scending all opposites - even those of the four other levels - is shown as a filled-in black circle. This is the attainment of absolute affirmation in the radical negation of all opposites, i.e. ultimate deliverance. The empty white circle, however, is not its opposite since, as we have seen, the absolute and the phenomenal are in a relation of mutual penetration and fundamental unity. In the early ninth century, the Chan master Weishan (771-853) intro- duced another system of circle figures (C: yuanxiang; J: enso: ?perfect signs&gt;&gt;) as symbols for enlightenment and spiritual training.?16 A system of 97 circle signs, traditionally said to have been devised by the Sixth Pa- triarch, Huineng (638-713), was certainly in existence by the time of Yang- shan Huiji (807-883). In this system, written characters such as &lt;Bud- dha, &gt; &lt; sun,&gt; &lt;&lt; man,&gt; &lt;&lt; water, &gt;&gt; or the svastika are inscribed inside circles, a wordless means of communication intended exclusively for the initiated and requiring an intimate consent between master and disciple.107 Far more frequently, a simple, empty circle symbolizes the highest level of Zen insight. The best known example, perhaps, appears in the Ten Ox-Herding pictures,1?8 based on a parable formulated in various versions as a cycle of poems and pictures during the Song Dynasty (eleventh to thir- teenth century). Using the simile of an ox lost by its herd boy and finally found after long searching, the allegory shows in amiable disguise the stages of enlightenment, i.e. the attainment, or re-attainment, of correct insight into the essence of being. Once this insight is attained, however, there is neither ox nor herd boy any longer. Only a circle, an abstract sign representing the round emptiness (see above), is shown. Characteristic for Zen, however, is the fact that - at least in one version of this picture series - the end shows not world-secluded emptiness, but the ?&lt;return to the world,&gt;&gt; a world to be looked at and understood with different, newly en- lightened, eyes. It is the world of phenomena, which, if correctly grasped, leads directly and concretely to the ultimate insight, without the need for theoretical speculation or abstract signs. Thus it is not arbitrary that all scenes of this picture series are shown inside a circle. All existing things are, after all, &lt;&lt; non-distinct &gt; from the essential being.

The tendency against imagery inherent in Zen - far surpassing simi- lar tendencies in other Mahayana schools - is preferably shown in the use of abstract signs, primarily the circle (connection with the wheel symbol probably plays no part here, or only a small one). This is the case even af- ter the early phase of Weishan and Dongshan. To this day it has been cus- tomary (in Japan even more than in China) to paint a circle in one power- ful brush stroke, thus creating an impressive symbol (Ill. . 83). Often, the circle is accompanied by one or several Chinese characters taken from col- lections of Zen aphorisms. The circle reminds the believer not only of the perfection and the emptiness of the absolute, of the essential nature of the Buddha and , , at the same time, of his own self (bhuta-tat , but also - on the level of a geometrical-abstract, but not completely imperceptible form of symbol - of &lt;&lt;the mirror, in itself empty, but teeming with forms and colors.,,1?9 (In East Asia, mirrors are ordinarily round).

It symbolizes the suspension of all dualities in the ?&lt;true emptiness &gt; and the shapeless and colorless - i.e. non-phenomenal - essence of all things. The mirror can absorb and encompass everything, yet remain empty, free, and untainted. The circle is often likened to the moon. The moon signifies perfect enlightenment and thus also represents the Buddha, who is called quite ex- plicitly the &lt;&lt; Full Moon Exalted One. &gt;&gt; Nagarjuna is said to have called the Buddha nature (buddhatd) &lt;&lt; Full Moon Circle, &gt; thus providing the first ex- ample of the circle symbol in Buddhist literature.13 The figures of the mandala are enclosed in &lt;&lt; moon circles &gt;&gt;; in Esoteric Buddhism an impor- tant meditation is called &lt;&lt;viewing of the full moon circle &gt;; through this exercise, one's own self is recognized in its identity with the Buddha na- ture. Thus, Zen followers continue an old tradition. They interpret the cir- cle as the symbol for the &lt;&lt; original face before birth, &gt; the innermost essence of the self prior to individuation in temporary-phenomenal shape. Most likely, the &lt; portrait inside a circle&gt;&gt; (C: yuanxiang xiang; J: enso-zo), orig- inating in China around I300 and especially popular among Zen priests in Japan during the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries, was rooted in the idea and the symbolism of the mirror, the nimbus, and the &lt;&lt;perfect round of the moon. &gt; The many implications of this type of image and symbol can- not be further pursued here."4 In this kind of portrait, the &lt;&lt;shadow&gt; or 112 Gundert: Bi-yan-lu, vol.

"5 The later Zen master Hakuin (1685-I768) gave the subject a humorous, paradoxical twist: the beggar's sack has been turned into a circle, and Hotel is stand- ing on it, pointing at the moon - i.e. the truth is already the firm ground under him (Ill. 85). The same thing is expressed the other way round in the popular subject of a monkey - symbol of delusion and clinging to shadow- like apparition - who reaches for the turbid and evanescent reflection of the moon in the water, thus missing the real moon. But even the mirror image in itself can lead to the essence; the moon is reflected in many wa- ters, but it is everywhere the same moon - and at the same time it is be- yond all those partial reflected images. (The Am(r)tabindu Upanishad says: &lt;&lt;Truly being but One, the Self-of-All-Beings-and-Elements is pres- ent in every being. It must be understood as unity and plurality at the same time, like the moon reflected in the water. ? )ii6 The Zen master Sengai (I750-I837) brushed a delicately shaded ink circle as full moon; a short poem beside it calls the autumn moon a shadow or reflection (of true real- ity) cast on the sky (the infinite emptiness).17 &lt;&lt; Reflection &gt;&gt; and &lt; shadow &gt;&gt; in this case do not mean anything unsubstantial; rather, they are the com- pletely transparent clarity in which the true essence, the emptiness (szuny- atd) or suchness (tathatd) reveals itself directly to the spirit; hence the ex- pression &lt;&lt; moon of suchness. &gt; At the same time, the moon symbol reminds the believer and makes him immediately partake of the shining light of en- lightenment. This corresponds to the sun's radiance with which the high- est Buddha Vairocana is associated in Vajrayana; but Zen prefers the quiet, gentle, cool light of the moon and the lyrical mood it creates. Surprisingly, Sengai uses purely geometrical symbols in a famous ink drawing (Ill. 86):"8 circle, triangle, and square closely lined up from right to left and slightly overlapping. Equally surprising, he refers to old Va- jrayana symbols in his treatise &lt;&lt;Santoku-ho zusetsu.?&gt; But in many Zen schools, especially the one practiced by Sengai, the basic thought of, say, the Shingon doctrine was still studied; after all, the philosophical basis, ul- II5 Eto Shun: ,Nyuzgen zenso gaka Mokuan Reien&gt; (Mokuan Reien, Zen painter monk in Yuan China), in: Yamato Bunka 31, October I959, pp. 83-92 (pl. 12 shows the Chi- nese painting in the collection of the well-known painter Yasuda Yukihiko [1884-I978]); ill. of both paintings: Suiboku bijutsu taikei, vol. 5, Tokyo I974, pls. 48, 49. - Korin (I658-I716) humorized and secularized the subject in a painting in which Budai stands on a sack and plays football with the moon (kemari, the old court play dating back to the Fujiwara period): Oriental Art, n.s. 6, I960, no.

This is why the most important Zen art forms do not show images of holy beings or rigidly defined symbols, let alone whole systems of symbols in- volving a binding language of signs. Zen art shows us objects in a way based on pure contemplation of the essence, retaining a hovering openness of their meaning. Zen art often depicts humble things from everyday life, above all taken from nature: the all-encompassing landscape, flowers, stones in the garden, or some fruit, such as the six persimmons in the fa- mous ink painting by the Chan monk Mu Qi (thirteenth century; Ill. 87).120 The empty ground, too, on which the objects are shown, can be interpreted as an aniconic symbol for the ultimate truth and the absolute essence of be- ing, identified with the Buddha and the Buddha nature (buddhatd) by Zen followers. The empty, clear ground is comparable to the gold that symbol- izes the Buddha nature in classical Buddhist art. Just as in ?traditional? Buddhist art the gold is in dialectic contrast to the world of colors, in Zen- related ink painting the bare paper (or silk) of the ground is in dialectic contrast to the black of the ink and represents the objects in an abbrevi- ated, highly condensed fashion, often bordering on the abstract. Some- times, this was taken to extremes, as when a white sheet would be used as an ?image &gt; in the tea ceremony. As long as Zen art remains within the realm of the visual, it expresses itself clearest in the concentrated symbol or sign, analogous to the word in the realm of language. But the ultimate goal of Zen art is the No-Longer- Symbol: the empty picture, the &lt;&lt;picture&gt;&gt; as emptiness, the shapeless shape, the ?thundering silence. &gt;&gt; According to the legend of Zen's origin, Sakyamuni transmitted the word-transcending teaching by silently show- ing a flower to his disciples, although only Kasayapa understood it, an- swering it, also in silence, by a smile. For after crossing the threshold of the insight into the Nought, all things are quite simply accepted and admit- I20 Seckel: &lt;Sechs Kaki-Friichte. ? Sometimes such motifs from nature have a hidden sym- bolic meaning in Zen art that has yet to be clarified. Thus the great Zen thinker Do- gen (20oo- I253), in chapter 53 (?&lt;Baika-maki&gt; = &lt;&lt;Plum Blossom Volume &gt;) of his &lt;&lt;Shobo genzo ? interprets the plum blossom - on the basis of a verse by a Chinese Zen master - as allusion to the Highest Enlightenment (mujo-shogaku) of Sakya- muni, whose image is indeed occasionally flanked by paintings of plum blossoms (e.g., triptych at Rikkyoku-an, Tofukuji, Kyoto; late thirteenth century; ill.:Juyo bunkazai, vol. Io, Tokyo 1974, ill. 4; plum blossom painting in color: Suiboku bijutsu taikei, vol. 5, Tokyo 1974, pl. 2); cf. Gisela Armbruster/Helmut Brinker, eds.: Brush and Ink, Coll.

A well-known Zen simile puts it this way: &lt; Before a man studies Zen, to him mountains are mountains and waters are waters; after he attains insight into the truth of Zen through the instruction of a good master, mountains to him are not mountains and waters are not wa- ters; but after this, when he really reaches the abode of rest, mountains are once more mountains and waters are waters. &gt;&gt; That is to say, mountains and waters thought to be ? without essence&gt;&gt; are for the enlightened one moun- tains and waters again - but only now are they truly so.

It might even be said that Zen strives to transcend all tradi- tional symbolism and reaches a new symbolism on a higher level; these new symbols of a higher order, however, are precisely the most ordinary things taken from everyday experience.

Compared with the strict iconography of rigidly defined symbols of Vajrayana and other doctrines, Zen symbolism is more universal and at the same time more neutral, allowing more freedom to the spirit seeking en- lightenment. It might even be said that Zen strives to transcend all tradi- tional symbolism and reaches a new symbolism on a higher level; these new symbols of a higher order, however, are precisely the most ordinary things taken from everyday experience. Since these symbols grasp the Thing itself in its ultimate essence, the usual symbolsfor this thing are no longer necessary. Instead, there is the sign-less symbol - or rather non- symbol - of the empty ground in Zen paintings. Like Vajrayana, Zen has a third basic possibility of aniconic visual rep- resentation, the written character. But the completely impersonal, rigidly regulated esoteric system of siddham letters represents the exalted beings in hierarchical encoded cult formulae of magic potency and cold perfection I22 Gundert: Bi-y,an-lu, vol.

In contrast, Zen &lt;&lt;letters, - regular Chinese characters, freely chosen and individually shaped - express in their lively, often tremendously powerful brushstrokes not only the personality of the writer but also the degree of his insight and of his spiritual maturity. It is no co- incidence that hand writings of great Zen masters are called &lt;&lt; ink traces (C: moji; J: bokuseki) since they leave an immediate testimony of the writer's character and of the text's meaning in a lasting trace projecting the text's meaning in a lasting trace projecting the invis- ible-ungraspable into the realm of visibility. In that respect, Zen writings are related to the Buddha's footprints (see p. 4I f.). Moreover these Chinese characters do not represent incomprehensible artificial terms meant for the initiated as siddham letters do; rather, they represent aphorisms and basic notions that can be understood from the basis of their literal, everyday meaning without any mystic or esoteric content. Nevertheless many Zen masters, such as Hakuin, also write siddham letters, but they do so quite differently from Shingon masters: they write with personal immediacy and finely shaded transparency of the ink (Ill. 89) - in such a way that &lt;&lt; the form originates in that which is without form, ,,23 i.e. the same way in which Zen paintings are created. On the other hand, an Edo-period Shingon monk like I23 Hisamatsu: Zen and the Fine Arts, p. 68f. (for this siddham letter by Hakuin). 9i</page><page sequence="90">Jiun (1718-I804) - strongly influenced by Zen (and, incidentally, famous as a Sanskrit and sid- dham scholar) I14 - could brush his siddham let- ters so vividly and powerfully (Ill. 90) that they resemble Zen bokuseki. Such cross-reference be- tween the various ways in which the symbolic language was used shows the continuous tradi- tion common to the various Buddhist schools (&lt;&lt;sects?&gt;) quite different from each other, and their search for ever newer uses of the aniconic principle. The pivotal concept of Buddhism, the VOID - identical with the essence of things (suchness) and the Buddha nature - is expressed most purely in the countless versions of the Chinese 9I character for WU (J: MU; I11. 91), written for centuries by enlightened masters with uncanny command of the brush in utmost concentration and untrammeled spontaneity. These characters show abundantly that this void is in no way negative, but the highest affirmation, the &lt;seal, &gt;&gt; on final en- lightenment. Strictly speaking, the WU is no longer really a statement, for any statement would be limited, determined, relative, and not truly valid. WU, then, is a signal for the Inexpressible, the enlightening truth, and thus it is the same as the thundering silence &gt; taking everywhere in Bud- dhism the place of the ultimate (or penultimate) word. For this purpose, the silent written character without distinct, definable symbolic meaning is the appropriate form if its shape originates in the shape-less and returns there - or rather does not originate nor return but simply is. &lt;&lt;Everything comes without a whence in its coming, and goes without a whither in its going, and that which is, is eternally what it is. &gt; (Nishida).125 ? Even when it is painted, it is not painted. &gt;&gt; Thus a verse (S: gathd) of the Zen text Wumenguan (J: Mumonkan; The Pass Without a Gate, &gt; 1228). The subject being painted, or rather not painted, is the &lt;&lt;original face prior to birth,? one's own essential nature to be experienced directly, without mediation of pictures, symbols, or words; it is identical with the Buddha nature, to be realized inside oneself. Therefore the self can never be grasped in images or symbols, yet it is &lt;no secret at all;? ?&lt;when you look back at your (&lt;&lt; original ) face, all secrets inside you will be evident, &gt;&gt; &lt;&lt; the origi- nal face cannot be hidden &gt;&gt;26. 9I.

Literally, the ding means &lt;&lt;crown of the head&gt;&gt; (S: usnisa), the protuberance on the Buddha's head (or, more precisely, one point on it), one of his Great Signs (S: laknana), a sign of enlightenment visible only to enlightened followers. To ordinary beings it is invisible, thus it is also called &lt;&lt;invisible head-sign &gt; (C: wujian dingxiang; J: muken chinso; S: anavalokita-mzirdhatd-laksana; compare the term avyakta-mirti mentioned on p. I6). The portrait of a Zen master was often inscribed by the sitter in his own hand and given to a disciple when he had attained en- lightenment. Such portraits were of great importance for the &lt;transmit- ting of the spirit by the spirit, &gt; a process that happened silently and pri- vately. Its &lt;true form, the essence of its wisdom, is beyond visibility and comprehensibility, just like the &lt;&lt;head sign &gt; of the Buddha. For enlight- enment is emptiness, and true emptiness is called ?without signs&gt; (C: zhenkong wuxiang; J: shinkzu muso). But the portrait steers the follower to- wards that goal, and helps to transcend the apparition, the image. It is one of the paradoxes of Zen that the portrait, which is supposed to show the ap- pearance of the sitter as accurately as possible, has been assigned such a task. That even the portrait can achieve this task is proof of the tremendous force of the urge towards imageless-ness in Zen Buddhism. Zen followers know that the essence of a person cannot be shown in a painting. They are convinced that this essence, the &lt;&lt; heart &gt; identical with emptiness, is best rendered in the non-pictorial, non-material form of the &lt;ink traces &gt; by an enlightened one. Such works - in their literal content, too - lead close to the threshold of invisibility and shapelessness, i.e. &lt;emptiness.&gt; Therefore, the inscriptions on Zen portraits are more im- portant than the image of the sitter himself, since they are written in his own hand and thus form a direct and immediate link with the master, in contrast to the technically rendered portrait following certain icono- graphical and stylistic patterns. Thus, images are rather an obstructive veil and fettering materializa- tion which detain us on the penultimate or even earlier stage, depriving us not only of the freedom of infinitesimal progress but of the last, decisive break-through. This way of thinking led to the radical and at first sight sac- rilegious act of the Chinese monk Danxia (739-824), who burned a wooden Buddha statue in order to warm himself at the fire. The point of the story lies in Danxia's reason for his action: he told the indignant priest of the tem- ple that he wanted to collect the relics of the Buddha (sarira) in the ashes, 126 Heinrich Dumoulin: Wu-men-kuan - Der Pass ohne Tor, translated (into German) and explained (Monumenta Nipponica Monographs I3), Tokyo I953, p. 36f. 127 Brinker: Zen-buddhistische Bildnismalerei, p. 12 ff.; Encyclopaedia of Buddhism, I/4, I964, 579 (s.v. anavalokita-mzurdhatd-laksana). 93</page><page sequence="92">whereupon the priest scornfully asked if he expected to find relics in a wooden statue. ?&lt;Well, in that case,&gt;&gt; answered the monk Danxia, ?&lt;May I have the remaining two Buddhas for my fire&gt;&gt;? I28 The materialization of relic and image is taken ad absurdum here, but the episode does not advo- cate iconoclasm in principle because it would equally be bound to objects and images, but only in a negative way. Zen followers tolerated Buddhist images, and of course they erected statues in their temples; but their atti- tude towards such icons was a completely independent one: pictures and statues were irrelevant and this is precisely why they could be tolerated. Among the most popular Zen subjects for paintings are the Buddha as an historical individual returning into the world from seclusion in the moun- tains after his enlightenment'29, and Sakyamuni transmitting his true doc- trine, inexpressible in words, to his disciple Kasyapa by silently holding up a flower. The attitude of Zen followers towards the image shows clearly how the principle of aniconism was transhistorically valid. Yet to talk about a &lt; re- turn &gt;&gt; to aniconism would not be correct, since, for one thing, Zen consents to imagery to a certain degree, as a preliminary and essentially unimpor- tant means; for another, the image-less symbol or sign played an impor- tant role in various schools of Buddhism prior to the full development of Zen during the Tang Dynasty. Thus, the Zen aphorism which we want to cite in conclusion - and to show it in a masterly &lt; ink trace &gt;&gt; by the Japan- ese Zen abbot Mujaku Dochu (I653-1744) (Ill. 92) - proclaims the im- possibility to represent the Buddha, the early Buddhist concept to which we referred at the beginning of this paper. This aphorism formulates a thought from the heights of Mahayana philosophy, propounded after a long period of abundant imagery, taking the form of Zen dialectic and paradox: Tongshen wu yingxiang (J: Tszshin mu yozo) says (in preliminary rough trans- lation): &lt;The universal body is without reflected shape (or shadow im- age). ?130 In such a saying, each word requires explanation. The &lt; universal, all-pervading body&gt; refers to the absolute Self, the true essence - of the Buddha, but also of all human beings and of all extant things. The word universal (an unsatisfactory translation of the term tong/tsu) can be used be- cause this ?&lt;body,&gt;&gt; this true essence of the Buddha nature with its &lt; origi- nal countenance before birth,? possesses all-pervasive knowledge and per- 92.

Therefore, this body does not cast any shadow, since it is identical with light; and in this world of light there are no reflections, since there is no contrast of light source and reflecting or shadow-casting obsta- cle, hence there can be no &lt;&lt;image. &gt;&gt; According to a famous Zen aphorism, the spirit cannot even be compared with the mirror of the highest knowl- edge, and to clean it from the dust of delusion is impossible since &lt;&lt; the clear mirror does not rest on a stand&gt;&gt; and &lt;from the beginning, nothing exists - how could a grain of dust settle on it then?&gt;&gt;I3 In the same sense, every image, every reflection or shadow lacks true reality and independent essence; at best it can be a temporary non-essential apparition of true real- ity. In Chinese/Japanese terminology, yingxiang (J: yozo) corresponds to the Sanskrit term pratibimba or pratiruipa (see above); the negation corre- sponds to nirdbhdsa and animitta: without characteristics, image, appari- tion, or shadow. This negation, however, implies a strong affirmation: whatever does not cast or possess any shadow image, has true being; nirdb- hdsa and animitta can also mean nirvana. I30 Quoted from chapter 90 of the Biyanlu (Japanese: Hekiganroku), I28; explanation: Imai Fukusan/Nakagawa Soan: Zengo ji-i (Dictionary of Zen sayings), 5th ed., Tokyo I966, pp. 256 and 533. - The concept ofying/yo (read yo in this case; usually however it is read as ei) is ambivalent: on the one hand, it means shadow (image), on the other hand shining (image), luminous reflex; the brightness (e.g. of the moon) causes shad- ows but is, in itself, a kind of image-apparition. The apparent contradiction between lustre and shadow is dissolved in this concept. Foying/butsuyo matches the Sanskrit Buddhachaya (Soothill/Hodous: Dictionary of Chinese Buddhist Terms, p. 227). In order to provide an image for king Bimbisara, the Buddha let his shadow fall on a cloth; on the other hand, the Buddha's image in the Dragon cave has the character of a shining apparition (see note 59), visible only to people of &lt;&lt; pure spirit, &gt; i.e. tran- scending empirical, tarnished vision. The concept of the Zen portrait - ?invisible top-of-the-head sign,&gt; visible only to enlightened people - also belongs to this context; cf. the interpretation of the concept by the calligrapher of our aphorism, Mujaku Dochu, as referred to by Brinker: Zen-buddhistische Bildnismalerei, p. 17. I3I This knowledge is also called yuan-tong, &lt; round (or perfect) penetration &gt; and can be paraphrased as &lt;&lt;universality by wisdom to penetrate the nature or truth of all things &gt;: Soothill/Hodous: Dictionary of Chinese Buddhist Terms, p. 398. 132 Dumoulin: Zen, p. 87f.; cf. Gundert: Bi-yan-lu, vol. I, p. 143f. 95</page><page sequence="94">But we would still be enmeshed in the world of dualities if we did not understand that this universal body with its all-pervading splendor of wis- dom is by no means simply the opposite of the shadow image, no more than the body of ultimate reality &gt; (dharma-kaya) of the Buddha is the oppo- site of his &lt;&lt;incarnation body&gt; (nirmana-kdya), or nirvdana the opposite of samsdra. In Buddhism, and especially in Zen, the word WU/MU does not mean a simple negation, but a dialectically infinite negation. Ultimately, the term transcends any conceivable affirmation or negation: it is a non- statement of an insight that is utterly free from all opposites and limita- tions. It cannot be defined, but only alluded to by silence or at best by a sign.133 With this insight, the antithesis between the universal body (of the Buddha in nirvadna and of one's own Self) and the shadow image finally dis- appears, too; according to the doctrine of non-duality (advaita), they are ?neither the same nor different,,&gt; their mutual relationship cannot be defined by either a Yes or a No, and the provisional translation ofMujaku's aphorism turns out to be too categorically negative. A tentative paraphrase of the aphorism could be worded as follows: ?The Universal Body stands beyond any possible statement of whether it has a shadow image or not&gt;?; or: ?The relationship between the Universal Body and the shadow image is that of Nought, i.e. of neither/nor and &lt;as well as&gt;. &gt;Finally we see that between the principle mentioned in the beginning, that the Buddha can- not be grasped in images, and the argument for Buddha effigies cited at the end of the first part, i.e. that images are indispensable because as manifes- tations they lead to the grasp of the highest truth, there is also a non-du- ality, and neither principle should be blindly made into a dogma. It is in this dialectic or paradox of image and non-image that Buddhist art remains suspended. I33 All such statements are to be interpreted in the Buddhist sense in accordance with the principle of the Four Terms of Differentiation &gt; (Soothill/Hodous: Dictionary of Chinese Buddhist Terms, p. 172; Ui: Concise Bukkyo jiten, p. 396, shikufunbetsu): ex- isting, non-existing, the one as well as the other, neither one nor the other; cf.
