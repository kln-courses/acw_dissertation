Allen S. Weller/Editor book reviews Ernst Scheyer Lyonel Feininger: Caricature and Fantasy, 196 pp., 50 ill. Detroit: Wayne State University Press, 1964. $15.00. T. Lux Feininger Lyonel Feininger: City at the Edge of the World, photographs by Andreas Feininger, 124 pp., many ill. New York: Frederick A. Praeger, 1965. $14.95. Feininger is internationally known for the linear purity of his crystalline presentations of North German churches, for the peace and quiet of his renderings of the Baltic sea, and his lighter side is little appreciated. While Hans Hess' excellent large monograph (New York, 1961) does not neglect the humorous and satirical aspects of Feininger's art, mani- fested chiefly in his early work, the pages de- voted to these are few. Hence, one is grateful to Professor Scheyer for drawing attention to Feininger's oeuvre produced before 1913, car- toons more playful, more whimsical than, say, those hard-boiled, hard-hitting works by George Grosz which were like hand-grenades thrown into junk shops. Feininger's creations were nearer to the spirit of fairy-tales. Schey- er reveals a Feininger unknown to visitors of museums, the Feininger related to the 19th century German caricaturist, Wilhelm Busch, the Feininger whose cartoons and illustra- tions are, on the whole, "gemuetlich" rather than biting. His amusing drawings for Ulk, his "Kin-der-Kids" color cartoon series for the Chicago Sunday Tribune, will now be recalled with delight by those old enough to have enjoyed them. Nonetheless, Feininger did not always confine himself to harmless entertainment. He was a Lincolnian Republican and, as a liberal living in Imperial Germany, he was glad to be able to lampoon reactionary pros- ecutors, opportunistic ministers of state, and, especially, the Kaiser's megalomania. Still, he got tired of his commercial work, and he gradually gave up one newspaper assign- ment after another, until, when he was about forty-two, he could devote himself completely to more ambitious painting and print making. But, as Alfred Hentzen pointed out in the preface to the catalogue of a Feininger memorial exhibition (Hamburg, 1960), this artist "never abrogated his early work. The grotesque creations of his fantasy . .. never disappear from his work ... always hovering between melancholy and gaiety." Indeed, odd little figures, dwarfed by the monumental architecture, turn up, now and then, even in his oils of the final period (1937-1956). Scheyer reproduces many pictures for which there was no space in Hess' mono- graph. There are numerous excerpts from the artist's letters, addressed to his intimate friends, Alfred Vance Churchill, an art his- torian and museum director, and to H. Fran- cis Kortheuer, a development engineer. Fein- inger, a good violinist who might have be- come a well-known virtuoso like his father, also had gifts as a writer. His letters are viv- idly written and make fascinating reading. Visiting for the first time Brussels, that "Paris in miniature," Feininger offers this ART JOURNAL XXVI 2 210</page><page sequence="2">observation: "The quaint old houses, three and four centuries old, some of them with their huge chimneys and quaint gables, give existence in their darker recesses to mon- strous shadows from the dazzling lights . . ." This could describe one of Feininger's own paintings. While both Hess and Scheyer repeatedly refer to the toys the master made partly for his three sons, and partly for his own enter- tainment, Lyonel Feininger: City at the Edge of the World-the arbitrary subtitle is taken from that of one of the drawings-is almost exclusively devoted to this very special side- line in his career. Feininger was, by the way, not the only modern artist to create toys- Klee, Picasso, Calder also made "excursions into the gamesome world," as T. Lux Feinin- ger writes. In 1911 a friend saw the toy en- gines and cars the painter had made for the amusement of his oldest son, Andreas (the photographer), and proposed that they be adapted for mass production in his father's factory for wooden toys. Unfortunately, World War I intervened and the plan never was carried out. Feininger continued to make toys for his sons. In a letter he half-seriously complained about his "periodical craze for making toys for Christmas," adding: "Every year I get the urge to saw wood into bits and paint them in bright colors. The boys take it for granted that I shall make 'mannequins' for them." As an old man, returned from Germany to his native New York, Feininger spent the winters whittling wood, to produce for his grandchil- dren figures of people and animals that are more fantastic, more grotesque than any he had created before: "The New York figu- rines, recalling some of the mysterious paint- ings of Piero di Cosimo, may be theriomor- phic humans of anthropomorphic animals." Many of the figures and houses are illus- trated, often in excellent color. The artist's son, Lux, is justified in his comment: "The toys an artist has fashioned may serve to gain an insight into the formal ideas of their creator."
