<plain_text><page sequence="1">FRANZ HANCAR: THE EURASIAN ANIMAL STYLE AND THE ALTAI COMPLEX (Cultural historical interpretation with a consideration of the newest Pazyryk discoveries of 1p46-- p949) EVERY IMPORTANT ARCHiEOLOGICAL FIND SERVES AS A MAGNETIC POLE IN that, it clarifies relationships of causality with other accidentally deposited material, and acts as a power field according to its artistic intensity. As for the fundamental problems of the Eurasian animal style, new discoveries have repeat- edly brought light and order to archaeology, bringing clarification and organization to hitherto obscure problems.l The following study will show in outline what the Altai com- plex can effect in the above mentioned sense, particularly after the most recent and striking discoveries have been included. Two most recent achievements create favorable conditions for research: the chronologisation of Metal Age development in Siberia, by now materially well-founded, classified by cultural analysis, and historically well-secured; and the unique multiformity of the results of the Altai (Pazyryk) excavations of 1929 and 1947-I949. In its wideness of survey, meticulous use of synchronizing analogies, and steady tracing of cultural development, S. V. Kiselev's record 2 (1949) of Metal Age phases in Siberia goes beyond the frame of an auxiliary chronology, in contrast to those of S.A.TeplouchovS (1929), M. P. Grjaznov4 (940) and S. I. Rudenko 5 (X949). With respect to the Altai, it is important For details cp. for example A. Salmony, Sino-Sibirian Art, Paris 1933, or D.N. Eding, Reznaja skul'ptura Urala, Trudy Gos.

This independent growth of culture finally comes into contact with that of the Eastern Huns (Noin-Ula, Il'movaja Pad', burial grounds of Derestujsk). The Altai complex therefore lies between two fortunately datable phases of cultural development in Northern Asia. These phases are: the Karasuk, definitely datable because of the ethno-cultural interdependence of Yin and Chou time Sui-yuan and An-yang; and the first period of political power of the Huns, definitely datable by its reflexes in the literary sources of the Han dynasty. This given limitation of the Altai complex of about 700 to Ioo B. C. is confirmed by its cultural chronological division into the two periods of Majemirsk and Pazyryk, and by their materially founded synchronization with the Scythian and Sarmatian phases of cultural de- velopment in the Pontic Steppes. The Altai complex is thus fixed in time and classified chronologically. Moreover, its material finds are in some cases of singular abundance, plasticity and detail of information. They permit a review of the daily life, spheres of interest, intellect, and faith of their ancient own- ers, and acquaint us with the origin and sources of that characteristic art which is akin to the art creations of the Pontic Scythians and Sarmatians. For a period now of nearly two hundred years7 their charming beauty has appealed even to contemporary man although it has remained uncomprehended, strange, and mysterious in meaning. The unique historical im- portance of the Altai complex is that it makes possible a far-reaching historical knowledge of this art. The Pontic Scythian conditions were early complicated by influences from the high civili- zations of nearby Greece and the Near East. In contrast, the finds from the remote and therefore culturally less disturbed and more simply developing Altai-Sajan region show the appearance of the Eurasian animal style and enable it to be classified as to origin and age. This style does not mature over night, and the domination of the animal motive in the art of hunters and shepherds goes back to animal motives developed under similar economic 6 M. P.

This constant develop- ment becomes evident and is traceable in the Altai-Sajan region. The first landmark hereof is seen in the oldest animal representations of the Bronze Age, in those sculptured stone heads of the mountain sheep (argali) which, as a rare exception, crown two stone steles of Minussinsk.8 The remaining steles 9 belong to the same farming and cattle-raising society of the late An- dronova civilization after i5oo B. C. However, they represent in anthropomorphic features the tribal deity in the cultic-cosmic image of the virgin-mother goddess-protectress, shown more or less overgrown by graphic-magic additions.10 Several problems remain to be solved: the original meaning of the stone steles of Minussinsk; and the transformation of their human faces and figural additions. Kiselev firstly assumes that the steles belong to the Karasuk stage, basing his assumption on their resemblance to Chinese symbols and the t'ao t'ieh masks. A satisfactory historical interpretation of these monuments will possibly have to recognize them as well as some other cultural features of the Andronova civilization as lingering into the Karasuk phase. The meaning attributed to the steles will not be discarded but may possibly be modified, since even their most divergent forms 11 adhere to the human 8 M. P. Grjaznov and J. R.

They differ from the Turkish stone babas which are a millenium and a half younger. In their first monograph, published in 1929, M. P. Grjaznov and J. nejder (op. cit., p. 90) attributed them to the Ka- rasuk phase because they antedate the Kurgan culture of Minussinsk (now called Tagar Culture). In 1933 S. V. Kiselev (Semantika ornamenta karasukskich stel, IGAIMK Ioo, M. L. 1933, pp. 280-293) coined the term "Karasuk stele". In I949 (MIA 9, pp. 97-IOI) he was in favor of incorporating the stone babas from Minussinsk into the Karasuk Culture on account of similarities with Chinese forms. In 1950 M. P. Grjaznov objected to this opinion and recognized the stone babas of Minussinsk to be part of the late Andronova culture on the basis of renewed investigation and an exhaustive revision of the cultural analysis. His evi- dence concerning manufacture, meaning, and date of the Minussinsk stone babas is based on their visible relation with meaning and form of small stone sculptures from late Andronova graves. He also refers to the fact that Karasuk people used the stone babas of Znamenka as a rock surface for their drawings, that is, as a natural object without special significance. I consider this evidence as valid. 10 M.P. Grjaznov, SA XII, pp. 131-142, 152-156. 11 Ibid., fig. 2/4. 173</page><page sequence="4">face and female characterization. This whole indecision does not however affect our train of thought here. It is important to note that in surveying the beginnings of animal art in the Altai-Sajan region it is not the domestic sheep but the wild argali which is distinctly and realistically depicted. This animal is unmistakably and intimately connected with the virgin- goddess. The association is completely analogous with elements of hunters' civilizations known through lingerings in folklore. Like many North-Asiatic tribes the Altai people trace the origin of some clans to a matrimonial union of a virgin with a wild animal. The legend of such a marriage lives on in the Altai region in the tradition of the Kumandinces, the C el- kances, and the Ujgures. The animal acts the male part in the tribal origin. This conception is typical in the mind of hunters and cattle-raisers. It is evidently connected with the socio-economic progress due to increase in livestock, and refers to the fact that the animal image in the Karasuk period is again that of a wild animal's head. As such it becomes a second landmark in the development of a shepherd's art in the Altai-Sajan region. Having expected powers of protection and aid, this head serves as the knob of a knife handle in the hands of the shep- herd. The burden of production and the main interest and concern of the tribes has been shifted to the shepherd and to his economic efficiency. This efficiency pertains to migra- tions to suitable pastures, tending, guarding, and primary utilization of the large flocks of sheep. It is relevant to the formation of the Eurasian animal style that its precursors of the Altai- Sajan variant as represented by the ram-headed stone steles of Minussinsk or by the animal- head knob of the Karasuk knives belong to the region of the West-East running forest steppe belt. It can not be denied that the realistic Bronze Age art creations of this area have close contact and deep-rooted relation to the hunters's art of Siberia and of the Taiga of Eastern Europe.12 Around 7oo00 B. C. the development of the Altai separates from that of its forelands of 12 For Siberia, compare the bone carvings from Bazaicha near Krasnojarsk (J. Savenkov, Sur les restes de l'epoque neolithique, Congr.

It goes its own way though not in the practice of the art itself. The Majemirskian phase 18 and the contemporary early Tagar culture of the Minus- sinsk basin 14 produced the early typically Siberian animal style art. It seems to be essential that the naturalistic trend of its animal representation is genetically linked with the Karasuk period. Its flourishing coincides with an age of expert craftsmanship in bronze casting (the numerous "treasure finds" = depots of casters). The period shows an improvement in the quality of cattle-raising and a shift to a preponderance of big cattle, bovines and horses. The enlarged repertory and the wider use of animal motives are archaeologically traceable and signify a widening of the horizon. This repertory goes back to the influences of the first Eurasian continental trade which had existed since the late second millenium B. C. and was carried by people who worked metal. In age and character it may be paralleled with the Pontic Scythian art. It is demonstrably interrelated, and has been brought repeatedly into genetic and complete relationship with Scythia.15 As far as can be seen today,le archaeological documentation is by no means missing for those early relations between Pontic Scythia and the Altai-Sajan region. They must have existed, judging from Herodotus' detailed information about the tribes of the North-east, his knowledge ofg the corresponding gold riches of the large Scythian kurgans.l7 Although the available material shows a far-reaching parallelism between the 13 Named after the characteristic finds in the Majemirski steppe on the upper Narym, excavated in I9I8 by A. V. Adrianov (M.P. Grjaznov, Pamjatniki majemirskogo etapa epochi rannich kocevnikov na Altae, KS XVIII, 1947, pp. 9-17; S.V. Kiselev, Altaj v skifskoe vremja, VDI 1947, 2, pp. I57-I72; the same, MIA 9, pp. I67-173). 14 This term, coined by S. V. Kiselev (Tagarskaja kul'tura I, RANION IV, M. I928, pp. 257-267, and MIA 9, pp. I08-I76) was set forth in direct contradiction to the term proposed by S. A. Teplouchov (op. cit., p. 45 ff., 60 f.), namely "Minussinsk Kurgan culture", or in short, "Minussinsk culture". 15 Compare the position taken by J. Borovka (Scythian Art, London I928, p. 75 f.) and E. H. Minns (The Art of the Northern Nomads) Proceedings of the British Academy, XXVIII, London I942, p. 13, f.) con- cerning the derivation of the Scythian animal style. 16 S. V. Kiselev (MIA, 9, pp. 134-146) gave a comparative analysis of Scythian and Tagar figure motives according to subject and treatment. 17 Examples of imported Siberian objects are: the knife of hammered iron from the neighborhood of Cigirin with the head of an elk-cow as finial (G. Borovka, op. cit., pi. X, fig. C), similar to the old Tagar bronze knives with elk or horse head (MIA 9, pi. XXIII, fig. 3); also Siberian socketed celts and burins from the 175</page><page sequence="6">Scythian and Tagarian cultural developments, the choice of their respective motives certifies an evident independence of the two regions which precludes any genetic derivation of the Scythian animal style from the Tagarian. The art of the Altai in its Majemirskian period does, however, relate to Tagarian art in its motives when the coiled animal, ibex and stag, the heads of birds and of hoofed animals, appear las the elements used. Neither does it deviate from the typically Tagarian man- \ ner of representation nor decorative use of the animal image, showing invariably a restrained but striking characterization of 2 the model and a vigorous accentuation of the muscles, sometimes combined witha -a superimposed spiral.

The separation lies in function and in the idea. The separation becomes manifest in the archaeological fact that around 700 B. C. horse-trappings first occur in North Asia. They have been found in the region of the Jenissei only occasionally, and have never been obtained from graves in the Minussinsk region. In strong contrast to this, they have been found in the Altai, in the neighboring Tuva Urjanchai and Mongolia in complete sets 18 which were without exception in burials where the riding-horse had been obligatorily sacrificed. In complete accord with these facts, only the Majemirskian bridle developed a multiformity of three-hole psalia19 in addition to the general Scytho-Siberian type of two-piece horse bits ending in stirrup or ring form. The animal style passes over early to the bronze strap ornament as shown by the late Majemirskian strap (fig. 2). Taken as a whole it imitates a boar's tusk, but shows a bird's beak with cere, eye, and ear spiral composed into the pointed end and the head of a beast of prey \ with open maw into the blunt end.

It becomes evident that one of the last steps of the socio-economic development of the Altai precedes the appearance of riding-horse trappings, horse-funeral, and the transfer of 18 For instance: With the undisturbed skeleton of an early Majemirskian horse-funeral on the Buchtarma were found, aside from the bronze bit, two small discs for breast decor and forty appliques for the leather straps (M.

The stages of the art-evolution are the representation of the primordial tribe practiced by the sedentary Andronova farmer-cattle-raisers; passing over the Karasuk shepherds with their typical knife handles; to the Majemirskian riding- horse trappings. The evolution culminates in the highest stage of shepherd nomadism, that of the horse-riding nomads. From the point of view of cultural history, shepherd nomadism is a highly specialized social and economic structure. Its focus is on the breeding of large herds of cattle. The utilization of these cattle determines the character of production and establishes autarchic consumption. It regulates the division of labor.21 It determines the relationship of the group to neighboring high agricultural civilizations. It deeply impresses the nomadic character and mentality and their expression in art and cult. Horse-riding nomadism is an ethnic pheno- menon which functions as a factor of general historic happenings. Seen from the point of view of evolution, this nomadism in the Eurasian steppes ultimately results from the util- ization of two cultural achievements: namely, the riding horse and iron. Seen in this perspective, the complex of usages and attitudes regarding the riding horse ceases to appear to be a mere modification of the closely related cultural inventory 22 of the Tagarians of the Minussinsk basin. To characterize the differences between the Altai and the Jenissei evolution from 700 B.C. on, one hardly needs to mention again that the ancient Tagar culture tended toward agriculture. This trend of the Tagars is recognizable from the fact that besides their horse and cattle raising the ancient irrigation channels can be traced, and that traces of their water, watch towers and refuge-fortresses are still exposed. 23 The question is posed: what discernment, insight, and knowlege does the Altai complex convey regarding its maturation to the stage of horse-riding nomadism? In other words, what does it offer in its general social and economic manifestations and whas does it offer in its art this script of the scriptless, which is often as much a mirror of intellectual level and character as are written letters? 21 Cp.

C.), late Majemirskian (500-3 00 B. C.), and Pazyryk period (300-1oo B. C.) of the Altai. Economically, we perceive from the very beginning a high cultivation of hunting and a visible appreciation of fur-bearing animals. This is accompanied by a universal and exhaustive utilization of the horse with pronounced military specialization of horse-riding as a means of combat. After 500oo B. C. iron begins to be used for the production of weapons. Remains of settlements of the early Majemirskian and late Pazyryk period are extant (Bol'serecenskoe I on the upper Ob above Barnaul24). The Pazyryk burials show a basic type of funerary chamber constructed with bark-covered timber. Notwithstanding the increase in dimensions of these chambers and the particularly lavish decoration in the Pazyryk burials, they re- mained basically the same throughout the centuries. This was so even after increasingly large herds of horses were bred, in consequence of which the grazing space had to be ex- tended, requiring longer sojourns on winter-grazing grounds. It is possible that this sojourn required blockhouses which resembled the funerary chambers and constituted the last survival of a formerly sedentary life within a then completely nomadic civilization. With regard to the social organization, the existence of typical family burial grounds reflects the continuance of the patriarchal-clan societal structure. The tendency of the social de- velopment is determined in the most evident manner however by the differentiation of property arising as a consequence of an accelerated and unequal capital increase due to the raising of large herds. The distribution of power is causally connected with this capital increase and is disclosed by the furnishing of the tomb and by the wealth of funerary gifts of horses and especially of gold. In a highly significant contrast, the Tagarian farmers evolve a rich tribal chieftaincy to meet the necessity for an authoritative administration of their irrigation systems, but the mass of their population shows no essential differences in wealth. Regarding the intellectual sphere and taking into account the expressions of art, one could see the precipitation of continuous cultural growth in the expanded use of animal decoration: from the knob of the Karasuk knife to the Majemirskian bridle, to ornamental bracteae for 2 M. P. Grjaznov, KS XVIII, p. I 5. 179</page><page sequence="10">straps and garments as well as to mirrors. Considering the problem however from a universal, cultural and historical point of view, one cannot misconceive the most essential impulse of the development. For instance, in burial customs, a simple grave-pit is followed by a subdivi- sion of the grave into a timber chamber and a space for the horse. After the Karasuk outfit for the dead, which was restricted to his personal clothing and adornments and to gifts of provisions in earthern jars, the cultural development of the Altai adds weapons, bridle, saddle, and the riding-horse, always sacrificed by an axe blow on the forehead to the ac- coutrement for the dead. The mentality of nomadic horsemen is unmistakably and tangib- ly evident in the totality and in the details of the Altai complex, acquainting us with the essence of its animal style. The five Pazyryk kurgans in the Eastern Altai 25 prove to be most informative. They re- present the full cultural maturity of Altai horseman nomadism of the last centuries B. C. Furthermore all five were excavated by experts, and had been fortunately preserved in a frozen state by the concurrence of climatic, physical, and human factors.26 Considerable material remained beneath the huge stone kurgans (diameter at the base up to 50 m., height up to 2 m.), ranged in a chain along the Ulagan river. The larger graves (up to 7.2 m. x 7.2 m. x 4 m. depth) within the spacious funerary chambers were formed by many beams and double walls. Outside of them were the sacrifices- horses (numbering up to 14), and their state trappings - although robbery had occured in each instance soon after the princely burials". Although there exist only "remains", the material obtained is so abundant, its problems so manifold and far flung, and the literature originating from it already so extensive, that it is impossible to do anything like justice to the find and its importance with a limited character- 25 M.

For this reason I choose to deal with the cult as the most significant force in pro- ducing the animal style. The cult as a mirror of mind shows in the sepulchral layout as a whole the well-known idea of an earthly conceived continuance of the personal existence after death and provides in this way precious views into the everyday life and general way of living. A number of phenomena point unmistakably to a tent life in which people sit on the ground. These are: wall draperies and floor coverings of sheep-wool felt; small, low wooden tables, colored in dazzling red, with a removable, oval, concave top set on four insertable legs carved in lion shape;27 women's half-length boots of soft leather with tops of leopard skin and with richly ornamented soles of colored leather and with pearls sewn on; and round-bottomed wooden vessels set on felt bases.28 In combination with the riding-horses and their rich bridle and saddle trappings, and in spite of block-house construction in the conservative burial custom, these finds prove definitely a nomadism of cattle-raisers. Two cult features handed down to us are of primary importance: indications for the practice of hemp-narcotism and mummification of corpses. Funerary furnishings of little material value occasionally survived untouched by the spolia- tions of the grave robbers. Thus the Western compartment of the funerary chamber in the second Pazyryk kurgan, which yielded the most important discoveries, contained the fol- lowing interesting items: a leather blanket (i.75m. long, l.Sm. wide) with a border and a central decoration showing scenes of winged lion-griffons attacking elks; beneath it were six staves with a leather bottle attached to one of them and adorned on opposite sides with the representations of a griffon attacking a gor-cock; in the bottle were hemp seeds (cannabis sativa E. sp. cannabis ruderalis Janisch, apparently wild) and under the bottle a small bronze vessel in the shape of the Siberian cauldron on a conical base, with two horizontally placed handles enveloped in birch-bark. The vessel was filled with stones, and among them were roasted hemp grains.29 The use of the bronze cauldron as a censer with isolated handles is certain, and the in- 181</page><page sequence="12">---'^&gt;-' *-&gt; terpretation of the whole complex as paraphernalia , ' ~.~r^ for some kind of "sudatory hut" in Herodotus' sense ,^*^^SV 1^^is cogent. 80 If objects found nearby contribute con- .KVt -i /^A^^1?^-.^^ ^ firming evidence, it was associated with the wife buried in this grave together with the silhouette of a stag y^^^/-^^ n4X ncut out of leather, winged lion-griffons made of "N^VAyfi 3 copper, pearls, and a bronze mirror adorned with Fig. 3 one pearl and placed in a fur case.

As to objects and craft, the Pazyryk animal style art comprises chiefly wood (figs. 4, S) and stag horn carvings (figs. 6, 1 I) in full round or low relief (only occasionally stamped copper has been found [fig. 3]), frequently gold-plated, particularly as psalia of horsebits, frontlets (fig. 6) appliques of strap ornaments (fig. 5), plaques for whip handles, pole tops (fig. 4) and table legs. There are, furthermore, silhouettes cut out of leather or felt (figs. 7, 8), sometimes cov- ered with gold foil, sometimes antithetically duplicated by the folding technique. These serve as appliques on clay or leather vessels, on the huge timber coffin, on the wooden saddle bows, on leather jackets, and the ornamental leather cases for horse manes (fig. 8). Finally, one has to mention multicolored felt appliques, composed as mosaics, occcasionally supplemented by trimmings of dyed furs, and leather or horsehair, used particularly as de- coration for saddle covers. In trying to understand the nature of the Pazyryk animal style, the prevailing concentration on the horse harness strikes one as characteristic.3" Inasmuch as Pazyryk art originates from a horseman nomadism, this is perfectly logical. The validity of this feature is not impaired by the regrettable fact that nothing has been left of the valuable personal adornments of the buried since the grave-robbers carried away the mummified corpses or cut off their heads and limbs, obviously in order to take the precious necklaces, bracelets, leg and foot-rings, the existence of which we may infer. An additional, visible characteristic of Pazyryk animal style art is its colorfulness and obvious enjoyment of both dull and bright combinations of white, yellow, blue, red, maroon, and black with brilliant touches added by gold-tinsel in- serts and impressed tin foil. According to my judgment, the Pazyryk animal style shows the great emotional vigor of dicii "Cujskaja dolina," MIA I4, M. L. 1950, p. 69 f.). For women shamans, compare the grave of a female at Karagol on the Ursul river, Altai (S.V. Kiselev, MIA 9, pp. 189-193), and also the "portable altars" from the lower Volga and the Southern Ural (A.M. Tallgren, Portable Altars, ESA XI, pp. 47-68) which B. Gra- kov (Perezitki matriarchata u sarmatov, VDI 1947, No. 3, pp. I00-I2I) demonstrates to be indications of socially high ranking "women priestesses" among the Sauromatians of the VI-IV centuries B.C. 83 E.

The representation of a single animal occurs, but is not used for significant areas of ornament. On places of importance, such as forehead and headdress Fig. io of horses, on saddle covers, the leather blanket of the Attack of a tiger on a mountain sheep Cut-out leather silhouette hemp-incense-tent, etc., one finds exclusively the Main ornament of a saddle cover animal scene as decoration. I certainly consider animal From the first Pazyryk Kurgan scenes (attack of panther on reindeer, combat of griffon and tiger, attack of eagle-griffon on argali) as dominant. Even the Pazyryk horse masks show such scenes. Formalistically this fundamental theme of Pazyryk art is linked in several ways: I. A strikingly naturalistic rendering of animal bodies and movements, particularly of the elk (fig. 7) or the tiger (fig. IO), is coupled closely and in the same representation with dot, comma, and bow-shaped ornaments on shoulders, groin, and croup of the animals. This results in a strong ornamentalization (figs. 8, z, II) which makes the original model almost unrecognizable. 2. In the representations of animal attacks, renderings of the entire animal (figs. 9, lo) in silhouette or composed in colored patches according to the materials used, occur with or without accentuation by subdivisions inside the contour. These are found side by side with astonishing abstractions of high artistic quality which come close to symbolic rendering (figs. 4-6). 3. The most marked peculiarity of all Pazyryk animal attack representations is the con- tortion by 1 80? of the backs of all attacked hoofed animals, and sometimes of felines. The Pazyryk animal style is intrinsically related to the remarkable gold plaques from West Siberia which illustrate animal combat and attack scenes. The origin of these plaques has never been made clear by finds although a chronological and cultural classification has been attempted from different points of view.34 It is most important and essential to trace the 34 I.

In the art of the Pontic Scythians these particulars of representation are not found. It is unanimously agreed that the Noin Ula picture-carpets date from the second pre-Christian century. These picture-carpets as well as the widely spread Ordos bronzes depend in their style on the Siberian gold plaques which are decorated with semi-precious stones of various colors in cloisonne technique. There can be no doubt about their syn- chronism with the Pazyryk artifacts. Moreover, the ideal, formal, and even material nearness of the Siberian gold plaques 35 to the Pazyryk animal style speaks for their closest genetic Samanizm v otnosenii k russkoj archeologii, Zapiski Russk.

I believe that this relationship exists not only because there is an evident relation between the textile and jewelry art of the horse-riding nomads but also because the very extensive Pazyryk representational art clearly attests a center which conceives the animal attack, basing it both upon a realism derived from immediate observation of nature and also on symbolic abstraction. At first one might rightly object to this generalization because the personal gold ornaments of the dead are missing from the Pazyryk kurgans and also because the animal attack scene is missing from the tattoo which is the most intimate connection of the Pazyryk animal style with man. The factual evidence reveals that the mummified male dead from the second Pazyryk kurgan I88</page><page sequence="19">?A_* was tattooed on breast, back, both arms from wrist to shoulder, and the right shinbone with seventeen animal motives (figs. 12-X4).36 y^^"^ ^!^Probably at an early age the man had soot introduced under his ! -, luskin by means of needle punctures.

Four ibexes are shown fleeing one behind the other contiguously on the inside of the calf from ankle to knee. There is a mountain sheep on the right under- arm (fig. 16) and an onager-like animal near it (fig. 15). Except for these, all the remaining eight undamaged animal motives are of a fantastic kind: three stags with griffon beaks and enormous antlers with tiny tips in the form of griffon heads (figs. 15, 17), and five felines of various shape, in one instance winged, always with emphasis on clawed-legs, open maw, spiral-tipped tail, some- times with a griffon's head as tail tuft.

It is characteristic that all hoofed animals but not the felines have trunks contorted by 180?. Nevertheless this contortion does not suggest the death struggle sometimes considered as the explanation of this convulsive contortion. None of the beasts of prey is attacking; none of the hoofed animals is struck down. On the contrary, the jumping-down movement of the mountain sheep (fig. I6), the gallop of the onager-like animal (fig. 15), and the stepping out of the stags (figs. 15, 17) seem almost tangible. As compositions, pictures of this kind constitute a disconnected assemblage, an enumeration and lining up of the following animals: large fantastic felines, evidently ready for combat and eager to attack, and hoofed animals ready to jump and to run. It may not be without functional significance that the biggest feline extends from the corpse's left shoulder blade under the left arm reaching the heart, while the other animal designs are more evenly distributed. Although the writers of antiquity, Hippokrates, Herodotus,37 Pomponius Mela,38 Ammianus Marcelinus,39 and Plinius Secundus,40 mention unequivocally the tattooing practiced by their contemporaries in Rome, Greece, Thrakia, Judea, Asia minor, Assyria, and particularly by the Agathyrsians, Dacians, and Sarmatians, they do not inform us as to the aim and mean- ing of this tattooing. The idea of magic protection and defense is immediately suggested by the disposition and renderings of the beasts of prey. The fact that antler and horn bear- ing animals of the local wild fauna have relation to the tribal origin, protection, and welfare up to the present time among the hunting and cattle-raising tribes of the Altai-Sajan region corroborates this idea of magic protection. The Altai shamans were assisted by animal- shaped spirits 41 among which the stag, mountain sheep, and ibex were the most important. I am led to assume by this a functional interrelation between the position of the dead as a shaman and the apparently disconnected animal designs in analogy to the animal figures on mantle and cap of the Siberian shaman representing magic forces ready to come to his aid. 37 Her.

The animal art reflects the past: magic and totemistic animal concernincepts angre grounded in the beliefs concerning the tribe. On a higher level of thinking these myths are transformed into cosmic ideas of a cattle-raising and farm- ing stage. They are finally formed, evolved and spread by the vitality and power of the horse-riding nomads. A significant fact is the continuity of the original meaning of the animal image. It is also most revealing that its elementary sense persists within the frame of the Eurasian animal style. The wild animal continues to represent the early and deep-rooted idea of origins, and it lasts up to the very end, despite the fact that game taken in hunting had long since disappeared from the focus of interests. It is to be observed that the warlike horse-riding nomads do not discard this basic conception but incorporate it into their own life as a new creation of scenes of animal combat and attack,42 even though their economy is based on flocks and large herds of cattle. V. V. Gol'msten 48 interprets the animal scenes as combat and attack not of ordinary beasts but of animal-ancestor deities of certain clans, and rightly refers to the evident continuity of the magical purpose of these motives which become manifest in the strikingly fantastic exaggeration of the attacking beasts' strength and the utter submission of the attacked animals.44 42 A.

I933, p. 115-121. 44 The fact that the griffon appears especially as the enemy of the stag and bird points in my opinion to the conception of cosmic dualism, contrasting light and darkness, sun world and underworld. This inter- pretation has been given by I. I. MeScaninov (O primenenii lingvisticeskogo materiala pri issledovanii vescestvennych pamjatnikov, Soobs'c'. Gos. Akad. Ist. Mat. Kul'tura, I, I932, No. 1-2, pp. 6-12). It seems more probable than does the idea of fantastic power concentration in animal-shaped images of ancestor and god (V. V. Gol'msten, op. cit., p. 115 f.). I believe that pure hunting magic can not be con- sidered the impulse for the animal art of the Altai, in spite of the considerable interest which the nomadic Altai horsemen had in hunting (J. G. Andersson, Hunting Magic in the Animal Style, BMFEA, No. 4, Stockholm, I1932). 191</page><page sequence="22">In spite of all relationship existing between the Pontic Scytho-Sarmatian art and Siberia, a fundamental separation between East and West becomes apparent in that the Altai carries on without exception the animal motive."5 Already in the late fourth and early third cen- tury B. C. Pontic Scythia shows for the first time the organic incorporation of men into its repertory of motives in addition to its characteristic form of the animal combat and attack scenes."6 This human form can have the shape of the great female goddess, the male mon- ster-killing hero, or of the Scythian prince elevated by the deity through the potion which brings about the mystic union. As far as I can see or judge, this persistance, not rigid but vitally creative, of the Altai po- pulation on the animal representation as the most characteristic expression in Altai art seems to flow from two sources of energy: from a deeply rooted affinity to shamanism and from the differentiation in the state of social development as well as in the factors determin- ing its level and nature. As to the differentiation in the state of social development and the factors determining its level and nature, the following is of decisive importance: there can be no doubt that the dead of the Pazyryk kurgan represent the highest level of social rank, proven by several interesting details. Their knighthood can only belong to a great regional and tribal unit of the third and second centuries B. C. There is no sign however of a step leading to the formation of a monarchical state. This step was taken by the Pontic Scythians and is re- flected in their art when they create a person and link him with the figure and military exploits of Ateas, later on of Scilurus and Palacus. It is no accident that the youngest "royal" Scythian kurgans on the Dnjepr and on the Kuban show the acceptance of the ancestral motives of Heracles-Targitaos or hero-ancestor,47 combined with the snake-legged 45 The few exceptions do not loom large in importance. They are: a small wooden sculpture of amulet character which represents a squatting man; wooden adornments to be strung up on thongs; and two silhouettes cut out of leather which depict male faces in full front view, either with or without beard (S. I. and N. M. Rudenko, op. cit., p. 46, 48, and pls. VII, fig. 6, X, 2-4, XI, 2-4). 46 Compare for instance the attack of a griffon on a fallow-deer on the silver amphora from the Certomlyk Kurgan or on the gold bracelet from Kul Oba (E. H. Minns, Scythians and Greeks, Cambridge 1913, fig. 46 and 92, 2). 47 B. N. Grakov, Skifskij Gerakl, KS XXXIV, I950, p. 7- 8 192</page><page sequence="23">Echidna 8 and the great female deity. When this step is taken, the griffon motive is pre- ferred.49 Finally the transfer of power from god to prince finds an expression in the representation of the potion of mystic union. Then for the first time the scepter, tiara, rhyton, baldachin and other motives appear as emblems of sovereignty among the fune- rary gifts. Nothing analogous is to be found in the Altai. Evidently the Altai knights did not know any reinforcement of their power by tracing their ancestry back to tribal origins in the heroic age. Neither did they base their social rank on some kind investiture by the grace of god. Or not yet? The answer hereto is linked, in my opinion, to the cultural historical clarification of two archaeological phenomena which relate to the social development in the Altai in the last centuries B. C. There is first the fact that the fifth Pazyryk kurgan contain- ed a ritual drum made of horn and a woman's tiara, both possibly belonging to the shamanistic orbit. There is also a felt picture-carpet covering the wall (4 m. x 6 m.) on which is portrayed an enthroned goddess who wears a tiara and holds the tree of life in her hands and has a horseman in froat of her.50 The second archaeological phenomenon is found among the contemporaries of the Pazyryk knights located in the Taiga, East of the Jenissei, on the Angara and upper Lena. They are the only ones in Siberian art of the third and second centuries B. C. who employed human representation. These representations, to us informative and instructive, have the shape of standards or bronze finials in the form of oval disks showing a man's face framed by a beard and an antler crown on the forehead, clearly recognizable as a shaman.51 It is obvious that the hero-ancestor motive, common among the Pontic Scythians of the late fourth and early third centuries B.C., replaces the animal motive on these standards.52 The roots of these motives are revealed by the Burjatic legends58 48 D.

They are even more clearly disclosed by the myth of the Jenis- sei Ketes and of the Jakutes 5 who believe the deified shaman to be the ancestor, cultural hero, commander-in-chief, and mighty protector of the tribe.
