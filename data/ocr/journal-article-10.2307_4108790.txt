<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Kerosene Lamp and the Development of Mir6's Poetic Imagery E V A N M A U R E R, The University of Michigan When I first knew Miro he had very little money and very little to eat and he worked all day every day for nine months painting a very large and wonderful picture called "The Farm."... No one could look at it and not know it had been painted by a great painter and when you are painting things that people must take on trust it is good to have something around that has taken as long to make as it takes a woman to make a child . .. and that shows even fools that you are a great painter in terms that they understand. After Miro had painted "The Farm" and after James Joyce had written Ulysses they had a right to expect people to trust the further things they did even when the people did not understand them and they have both kept on working very hard. ERNEST HEMINGWAY' HEMINGWAY began his friendship with the Catalan artist Joan Mir6 in Paris during the winter of 1923. The French capital was an exciting cultural magnet that drew young artists, writers, poets, and musicians from all over Europe and America to a milieu that supported new modes of creative expression. The Farm (fig. 2), which Mir6 had completed the year before, is part of a series of works from the early 1920s in which he went beyond conventional pictorial representation to achieve the mysterious and poetic personal style he would continue to explore during his long career as one of the great artistic geniuses of the twentieth century. With the acquisition by Harold Joachim of The Kerosene Lamp of 1924 (fig. 1), the Art Institute gained a significant example of Mir6's work during a seminal phase of his development, when he began to replace representational imagery with a richly poetic use of signs and symbolic metaphors-a new language of the imagination. The Kerosene Lamp is a large, mixed media drawing on finely woven canvas in which Mir6 created a variety of forms and symbols that will be identified and analyzed later in this discussion of his iconography. The linear elements used by Mir6 in this drawing range from thin, straight, red pencil lines which establish the underlying structural grid, to the darker and often boldly modulated, curving lines of black chalk which he used to create his symbols and images. The interaction of these two systems produces an ambiguous sense of figure-ground relationships that offer the viewer an active role in exploring the mysterious spatial effects of the composition and the rich poetic dialogue of the images. For example, in order to create a greater perception of spatial illusion, Mir6 used the 61</page><page sequence="2">FIGURE 1 Joan Mir6 (Spanish, 1893-1983). The Kerosene Lamp, 1924.

These elements demonstrate his awareness of the meta- physical compositions of Italian painter Giorgio de Chirico in the massing of sharply angled planes in an indeterminant space. The imagery of The Kerosene Lamp also recalls de Chirico's use of large-scale objects like gloved hands, flags, fruits, and plumes of smoke. De Chirico's work was well known among the avant-garde in Paris, and he enjoyed an especially strong reputation with the proto-Surrealists with whom Mir6 was associated. In this drawing and other works of the period, Mir6 used color in a very restrained way, reinforcing the subtle plajy of spatial relationships and symbolic forms that together achieve the artist's goal of visual poetry. The most pervasive 62</page><page sequence="4">Mir6's Kerosene Lamp color in The Kerosene Lamp is a white from chalk that was rubbed onto the surface leaving much of the warm, natural tone of the canvas showing through. The white chalk gives the effect of a thin, transparent screen over which floats a strange mixture of forms and shapes that Mir6 emphasized with a heavier application of white and black chalks and a very light and subtle use of red- orange and blue pastels. The most dense use of white establishes the centrality of the curving forms of a plume of smoke, a pipe, and the wick of a kerosene lamp from which the drawing takes its name. Other recognizable elements such as a glove, framed picture of a man with a long moustache, animal head, crossed flags, or kerosene reservoir, round fruit, and taloned walking stick are minimally tinted, providing a subtle play of color spread evenly over the entire composi- tion. The success of this drawing results from careful manipulations of line, color, and composition achieved with the technical skills Mir6 learned as a young art student in his native Spain. Born near Barcelona in 1893, Mir6 showed an early interest in drawing that led to his enrollment in art school at the age of fourteen. He later studied at Francisco Gali's Escola d'Art and, after his graduation in 1915, was encouraged and his work exhibited by the Barcelona dealer Jose Dalmau, whose gallery was an avant-garde center that also exhibited new French work by the Cubists and Fauves, by Fernand Leger and Marcel Duchamp.2 Dalmau's gallery was Bar- celona's closest link to the innovations and excitement of the Parisian scene that Mir6 would first experience on a visit in 1919. His brief stay in Paris had a profound effect on the twenty-six-year-old artist, who resolved to return the following winter as an active participant. As he explained to a friend, "One must go to Paris ready to pitch into the battle, not as a noncombatant spectator."3 Although Miro returned annually to his Catalan residence in Montroig to maintain the close contact with the countryside that engendered his strength of spirit and love of nature, he now also needed the artistic and cultural atmosphere of Paris to provide the critical and intellectual counterbalance to his poetic sensibility. In 1920, he wrote to his closest art-school friend, E.C. Ricart: "Never again Barcelona, that's flat. Paris and the country-to the day I die! I don't know why it is, but those who lose contact with the world's brain fall asleep and turn into mummies. In Catalonia no painter has ever attained his full growth. Unless he starts making long visits to Paris, [he] is going to fall asleep forever."4 Returning to Paris late in 1920, Mir6 arranged to rent the studio of a Spanish sculptor who spent each winter teaching at the Escola de Belles Arts in Bar- celona. The studio was located at 45 rue Blomet and, by extraordinary coinci- dence, the room next to Mir6's was occupied by the French artist Andre Masson, an active member of the Parisian avant-garde Mir6 was seeking. Recalling the Wednesday gatherings organized by poet Max Jacob at which he was a regular visitor, Masson told friends how "there one day I met Joan Miro, a Joan Miro then as unknown as I. Mir6 said he was a painter. I told him I was one too. I told him I was going to leave Montmartre for I had just rented a studio at 45 rue Blomet. He said, 'That's strange, just a few days ago I rented a studio at the same address.' We were going to be neighbors. Another curious meeting seemingly engineered by the hand of Providence."5 In these years, Masson was working on a series of interiors and mysteriously symbolic compositions such as Man of 1924-25 (fig. 3). Its central element is the headless linear torso of a naked man emerging from a bursting pomegranate and surrounded by a group of evocative images in a shifting, dislocated space. While Masson's painterly technique is quite different from Mir6's and his images are more clearly representational than the Spaniard's, during their years as neigh- 63</page><page sequence="5">FIGURE 3 Andre Masson (French, born 1896).

Shapiro Collection. bors, Mir6 and Masson shared a similar tendency to emphasize the poetic or evocative relationship of symbolic forms. Masson had strong contacts with painters such as Andre Derain, but he was more actively involved with the Dada-inspired poets and writers Michel Leiris, Georges Limbour, Robert Desnos, and Antonin Artaud, all of whom would soon be associated with poet Andre Breton and the Surrealist movement. Mir6 recalled that "the poets Masson introduced me to interested me more than the painters I had met in Paris. I was carried away with the new ideas they brought and especially the poetry they discussed. I gorged myself on it all night long- poetry principally in the tradition of Jarry's Surmdle. . 6. ."6 Alfred Jarry, best known for his Ubu plays, was one of the most revolutionary and eccentric of the Parisian literary geniuses at the turn of the century. Surmale (Super Male) is his most erotic farce, featuring a hero whose prodigious feats of lovemaking create roles of mythic importance for the male and female characters. Mir6 paid homage to Surmaile in a 1924 drawing, Composition (fig. 4), which depicts on the right the hero, Marceuil, with the over-sized phallus that Jarry described in his story. The shape of the phallus is repeated in the curved pipe and in its plume of smoke-one of the many times that Mir6 would use the pipe as an 64</page><page sequence="6">Mir6's Kerosene Lamp archetypal male symbol. Ellen, Marcueil's ultimate sexual partner, is on the left, her dotted outline a reference to Jarry's description of her body as being on the point of decomposition after a marathon performance with her priapic lover. As we shall see, the images of Composition, such as the pipe, the outline of the figures, and similar insect wings can also be found in The Kerosene Lamp, which was done during the same year. Through his earlier readings of Jarry and other literary innovators such as Guillaume Apollinaire, Mir6 was receptive to the ideas of the young poets he had met at Masson's rue Blomet studio. As art historians Rosalind Krauss and Margit Rowell have shown, Mir6's creative use of poetic metaphor and his sense of visual freedom were vitally stimulated by his contact with these writers. Through new modes of expression and the abandonment of formal rules of language structure, they evolved very personal and often irrational visions deriving from the uncon- scious and the dream.7 The poetic dream images that Mir6 admired were fre- quently energized, like his own imagery, by references to the powerful forces of desire, as in this passage from Robert Desnos's "Poemes a la mysterieuse" of 1926: I dreamed so much of you that you lost your reality can I still touch that living body kiss on that mouth the birth of the voice that is dear to me, I dreamed so much of you that my arms in embracing your shadow so used were they to cross each other on my breast that they would be clumsy in encircling your contours perhaps.8 These verses of desire, expressed through a merging of dream with reality, evoke the same feelings of mysterious dislocation as the floating objects and anthropo- morphic symbols of Mir6's Kerosene Lamp. They are both prime examples of FIGURE 4 Joan Mir6. Composition, 1924. Pencil. Hartford, Wadsworth Atheneum, The Ella Gallup Sumner and Mary Catlin Sumner Collection (1937.506). Photo: E.

Erpf (18.55). what Andre Breton, in his Surrealist Manifesto of 1924, called "the new mode of pure expression."9 Although he would always be closely associated with the Surrealists, Mir6 was never involved in the formal, dedicated sense demanded by Breton. In 1981, Mir6 reminisced: "I was not a Surrealist, really. A Spaniard does not need to be a Surrealist-he is already irrational. I was interested in the idea of peinture- poesie-painting as visual poetry."10 In order to attain this visual poetry, Mir6 went beyond conventional representation, replacing immediately recognizable, ordinary images with suggestive forms and signs. To intensify the dreamlike and mysterious effect of this perceptual experience, Mir6 simultaneously trans- formed the normal, logical settings of representational imagery--interiors or landscapes-into non-specific environments of indeterminate time and place, removing or generalizing familiar points of reference such as floors and fur- niture, or perspectively correct indications of landscape such as hills, trees, roads, or houses. This change in Mir6's work was gradual, and its origins can be 66</page><page sequence="8">Mir6's Kerosene Lamp seen most clearly by comparing a still life of 1921, Table with Glove (Glove and Newspaper), with one of 1922-23, The Ear of Grain. In Mir6's Table with Glove (Glove and Newspaper) (fig. 5), objects are arranged prominently on the surface of a round table whose top has been tilted up so that it almost fills the upper section of the painting, and five objects acquire a visual emphasis that gives them the importance of icons. The lack of cast shadows enhances their quality of mystery, for they seem to be suspended above the surface of the table. Mir6 used these common objects from his studio many times over the next six years, and all are present in the 1924 Kerosene Lamp. In the later composition, Miro gave his walking stick a ball-shaped head decorated with tufts of flamelike hair. The glove, like the other objects, has been simplified in detail and its fingers now hold the newspaper, still recognizable by letters JOUR (from the French journal, or newspaper) written in a reversed, mirror image. The circular portrait of the man that adorns the newspaper in the 1921 composi- tion has been transformed in The Kerosene Lamp into a more informal, framed representation of a younger man with black hair and a longer, more gracefully curved moustache. One can also see references to the speckled cover of the book, whose corner overlaps the edge of the table, in the rectilinear forms that fill the upper right corner of The Kerosene Lamp. The pitcher with its proud rooster within a wreath of leaves has no direct counterpart but may have affinities to the central image of the lamp and its living flame. As a final note, one could also relate the curving lines of the table's wheels to the spiral used in the later drawing. The objects in Table with Glove are still anchored in reality because of the normal spatial indications of floor, molding, table, and wall that surround them. The following year, Mir6 simplified his spatial references even further, as ex- emplified by The Ear of Grain (fig. 6). In this arresting composition, a covered FIGURE 6 Joan Mir6.

By their angles, the two planes could refer to a table or to a floor, but Mir6 deliberately avoided an exact visual definition of these elements in order to emphasize the evocative relationships of the three objects floating in front of them. Through this breakdown of ordinary spatial conventions, he established a new pictorial formula, one that he expanded and developed for many years and that served as the basis of The Kerosene Lamp. During the next Paris season of 1923-24, Mir6 completed two major land- scapes in which he finally achieved the full expression of visual poetry he was seeking. The earlier of these is The Tilled Field (fig. 7), a mysterious yet comic representation of Catalan country life, with a farmer plowing on the right, a farm house and yard filled with a menacing array of animals, and a huge carob tree that has a single eye staring from its branches and a human ear attached to its trunk. The interior forms of The Tilled Field, like those in Table with Glove, are simplified but can still be perceived as objects existing in a natural spatial environment. Several of the objects in this painting would be used later in The Kerosene Lamp, including the crossed flags, the newspaper marked JOUR, and the profile of the animal's head silhouetted against the paper. In a less obvious but equally important way, anthropomorphizing the large carob tree by giving it an eye and ear would lead to the more subtle equivalence of the kerosene lamp and a woman's body in the Chicago composition. The final step in Mir6's break with traditional representation is evident in the freest and most imaginative work he had yet painted, The Hunter (Catalan Landscape) of 1923-24 (fig. 8). As in The Ear of Grain, Mir6 reduced his background to two relatively undifferentiated horizontal planes, which here are defined by a curving horizon line. Floating in front of this image of yellow and rose fields is a wonderful melange of letters, objects, shapes, and lines within which we are invited to find the hunter and the landscape that the artist's title indicates are the subjects of this playful fantasy. With his early devotion to 68</page><page sequence="10">Mir6's Kerosene Lamp realism, Mir6 could never reject the essential role of visual forms as indications of meaning. In a 1948 interview with James Johnson Sweeney, the artist insisted that "for me a form is never something abstract; it is always a sign of something. It is always a man, a bird, or something else. For me painting is never form for form's sake."" During the same interview, Mir6 explained the process by which these associative forms were created: "Forms take reality for me as I work. In other words, rather than setting out to paint something, I begin painting and as I paint the picture begins to assert itself, or suggest itself under my brush. The form becomes a sign for a woman or a bird as I work.""12 That Mir6 had specific meanings in mind for all the elements of The Hunter was proven when he provided The Museum of Modern Art, New York, with a detailed identification of 58 objects and forms in the painting." The hunter himself is seen at the top left, his triangular head marked by a single staring eye, a spidery moustache, and the same curved pipe with a plume of smoke that Mir6 was to use in The Kerosene Lamp. The crossed flags to the left of the hunter's head are the French and Catalan flags, symbols of Mir6's two bases of inspira- tion, which can also be found in the Chicago drawing. The onion-shaped form sprouting four flamelike projections is the hunter's heart-an image very similar to the flaming sun-egg that Mir6 very carefully placed in the upper center of the painting. We shall see later how Mir6 transformed this metaphorical conflation of a human organ, an object of reproduction, and a source of heat and light into other forms of multiple meaning in the flame seen in The Kerosene Lamp. Balancing this sun-egg in the lower half of the painting is an animal with a triangular tail connected by a thin straight line to a large profile head with a great staring eye, whiskers, and a protruding tongue. The identity of this creature was hinted at by Mir6 in the four letters SARD, the beginning of the word sardine. A more feline version of this curious animal can also be found in The Kerosene Lamp. After his usual summer stay in the Spanish countryside at Montroig, Mir6 returned to his Paris studio on rue Blomet. During the following months, he worked on a series of paintings and large finished drawings that are generally FIGURE 8 Joan Mir6. The Hunter (Catalan Landscape), 1923-24.

Actually, the backgrounds of Mir6's work at this time weren't gray but rather, as in The Kerosene Lamp, the warm, neutral tone of the umprimed canvas with uneven applications of thinly brushed white and gray tempera. Two of these, The Kerosene Lamp and The Family (fig. 9), are signifi- cant links in a series that connects The Hunter to his major painting of 1924-25, the famous Harlequin's Carnival (fig. 10). Recalling the financially difficult times in which these works were made, Mir6 said that "for the 'Carnival d'Arlequin' I made many drawings into which I put the hallucinations provoked by my hunger. In the evening I would come home without having eaten and put down my sensations on paper.""14 Like the young poets who were his companions, Mir6 adopted the Surrealist technique of creatively utilizing phenomena such as the tricks of perception one often experiences when light-headed from sensory deprivation. Through such conscious technical efforts and his marvelous sense of fantasy, Mir6 developed a unique visual world of imagination and dreams, an allusive pictorial reality. The Kerosene Lamp and The Family are almost equal in size, and although the former work was executed in black and white chalk with pastel and red pencil on canvas and the latter is in charcoal and conte crayon on scored sandpaper, both are characterized by a soft, transparent surface. They are as similar in iconog- raphy as they are in appearance, and while we have no record of the artist's comments on The Kerosene Lamp, we are fortunate that he left a detailed description of The Family. Mir6's information about this picture, in conjunction 70</page><page sequence="12">Mir6's Kerosene Lamp with other statements he made, serves to identify some of the characters in The Kerosene Lamp and to interpret its major symbolic theme. According to Mir6, The Family is a personalized version of the group-portrait photograph.15 On the left, four loosely related elements define the father's head: the thick double curl of his hair, a pipe with a plume of smoke, a pair of staring eyes, and a black handlebar moustache. Below the moustache are a curving set of bowels, his sex, and a pair of triangular legs. In his right hand, he holds a newspaper with the letters JOUR, while below the newspaper is a pair of dice, about which Mir6 commented "No husband is perfect."'16 Mir6 placed the mother in the center of the picture, where her plantlike form acts as a solid anchor for the entire composition. Conceived as an anthropomorphic flower, the mother's circular head, with its wispy petals of hair, grows from a thin stalk, at the other end of which is the bulb with its radiating system of roots that Miro identified as the mother's sex organ. The arrow going across her body is a jeweled pin, and the two round forms below it are her breasts. Associated with the image of the mother is a sinuously curved vertical shape that Mir6 described as a flame. The mother holds hands with her son, who also has a round head. This sphere is divided in half vertically, black on the left and white on the right side, which is also decorated with four curving locks of hair. The son's body, like that of the mother, is indicated by a narrow column to which is attached a bottlelike shape that symbolizes his sex organ. Arranged around the figure of the son, from top to bottom, are a window with an eye, a wasp, a piece of furniture, a hobbyhorse, and a soccer ball. These fantastic characters have been meticulously placed within a faintly indicated grid system. Pentimenti, those still-visible underdrawings that we can observe most clearly next to the father's head, are other indications of the exacting care the artist took to achieve a balanced construction of forms. In a letter of 1922, Mir6 commented on this process as a part of the sensuous and spiritual aspects of the act of artistic creation: To communicate emotion through objects you must love them immensely because you may be sure that in the contrary case you will make a picture wholly without interest. I become more demanding of myself from day to day, an exigency which makes me rework a picture if one of its elements is a millimeter too much to the right or left. In the room which serves as my atelier I always have books that I read during the intervals in my work. All this requires a continual sense of spiritual vibration. When I paint, I caress what I am making, and the effort to endow it with a meaningful life tires me enormously. Sometimes, after a session of work, I fall into an armchair, exhausted, as after the act of lovemaking.1" Mir6's description of The Family gives us the information necessary to realize that the images of The Kerosene Lamp constitute a closely related version of the group-portrait theme featuring the same cast of characters. The man in the framed picture is a more clearly recognizable bust-length version of the father in The Family, with the same wavy black hair and long, black handlebar moustache. The newspaper indicated by the letters JOUR is again located next to the father, although here the letters have been presented as if reflected in a mirror or written on the outside of a window through which we are looking. Beneath the father's framed torso are two triangles that correspond to the triangles Mir6 identified as the father's legs in The Family. Among the other objects associated with him are the large, phallic pipe with its eddy of smoke and the die with its single dot immediately to the left of the pipe's stem. The son is obviously represented by the object resembling a walking stick in the upper left corner which has the very same head, hair, and body as the boy in The Family. 71</page><page sequence="13">FIGURE 10 Joan Mir6. The Harle- quin's Carnival, 1924-25. Oil on canvas; 64.1 x 93 cm. Buffalo, Albright-Knox Art Gallery, Room of Contemporary Art Fund. In The Kerosene Lamp, the mother is again the central element of the composi- tion, but instead of using the botanical image of The Family to represent the female, Mir6 here portrayed her in the form of a lighted lamp. The full, double curves that describe the shape of the common glass kerosene, or oil, lamp were also used by Mir6 as a poetic device to suggest the round, curving bosom, narrow waist, and full hips of the mother's torso."' The interpretation of this shape as a female body is further corroborated by comparing it to the large female form that dominates one of the artist's yellow-ground paintings of the same year. Portrait of Madame B. (fig. 11) describes a very similar curving torso with the same tall, columnar neck found in The Kerosene Lamp.19 In 1924, Mir6 produced a less finished pen and ink sketch also entitled Kerosene Lamp (fig. 12) which features the curves of the woman-lamp shape and its waving flame with radiating arms of light and heat. As in the Chicago drawing, a framed image of a man with a long handlebar moustache hangs to the right of the lamp. The two have another similarity in the treatment of the upper right corner as a window through which one has a view of the more distant space of the sea or a group of architectural forms. Both of these sections also give a certain visual emphasis by texturing the surface with dots and short, curved lines. 72</page><page sequence="14">Mir6's Kerosene Lamp Mir6 elaborated his metaphorical image of the woman-lamp with several details that also serve as signs of essential elements of womanhood. The center of her torso is filled with a white, curved form that represents the lamp's wick, its sinuous line not only reflecting the shape of the lamp but acting also as a reference to the woman's intestine-an anatomical feature Mir6 used in the father of The Family. Above the wick floats a flame whose color shifts from pale orange to blue and whose form, similar in shape to that of the wick, is surrounded by radiating, curved black lines that Mir6 used to indicate the mother's sex organ in The Family. The flame, with its nimbus of hairlike lines, is the central poetic metaphor of the work: it equates the source of heat and light with the sexual essence of the woman.20 Using a similar system of pictorial analogy, Mir6 indicated the breasts of the woman-lamp by the piece of fruit and spiral that flank the torso and are connected by a thin, straight line.21 Above the fruit-breast form is an angled line with a round head that intersects with a point between the wick and flame. It resembles the jeweled pin found on the mother in The Family. In the context of the lamp, it should probably be identified as the adjustment screw that controls the height of the wick and therefore the flame. The seven double-curved forms with pale orange bottoms in the lower left corner are most likely moths or other insects attracted to the light of the lamp, a metaphor for woman's compelling powers. Mir6 used many winged insect shapes in his work of this period, such as the wasp in The Family Below left FIGURE 11 Joan Mir6. Portrait of Madame B., 1924. Tempera on can- vas; 129.9 x 95.9 cm.

As we have seen, the glove to the right of the lamp was first used by Mir6 in Table with Glove of 1921; after its reappearance in The Kerosene Lamp, it became a common element in many paintings and drawings of 1925 and later. The animal head in profile at the right attached to a sticklike body is clearly a version of the son's hobbyhorse. The motif of the animal head can be traced to the fish of The Hunter and to the large- jawed animal of The Tilled Field. Mir6's continuing utilization of words as pictorial elements was a lingering feature of the Cubist influences he had assimilated earlier and his exploration of the tableau-poeme, where words were incorporated as pictorial elements of a composition. In addition to the letters JOUR, he also included here the words DER ("the" in German) and THE ("tea" in French) in the upper right corner, where they serve as a counterbalance to the visual weight of the other symbols and forms. Floating above the word DER is another international symbol: the familiar crossed flags of France and Catalonia, symbolic references to Mir6's dual ties to the land and traditions of his birthplace and the multinational, intellectual stimulation of Paris, where The Kerosene Lamp was created. The visual poetry that Miro created in The Kerosene Lamp and then in The Family would become the basis for Harlequin's Carnival, the most ambitious and successful painting of this series. In it, the viewer can recognize many familiar shapes and characters as well as a host of new ones, all presented with the same sense of capricious mystery that enlivens the earlier works but is here more fully developed in its imagery, composition, and brilliant color. As we explore the fantasy world of the carnival, we recognize compositional forms and objects from The Kerosene Lamp. Both works have a similar white S-curved form as their central pictorial element which is surrounded by such forms as winged insects, bewhiskered animals, men with lamp-shaped bodies and curved moustaches, red flames, dice, round-headed walking sticks, and gloved hands. This extraordinary melange is at once playful and menacing, a dreamworld fantasy that is more like the climax of an elaborately bizarre stage production than a poem. James Thrall Soby referred to the connection of Harlequin's Carnival to avant-garde French theater when he noted that "the playful spirit of the painting is abetted by brilliant colors-reds, blues, greens, whites, and yellows; the puppetlike character of the figures recalls the fact that Alfred Jarry, whose famous Ubu Roi was written for puppets, was at the time one of Mir6's preferred authors."22 By his commitment to poetic imagination and creative freedom, Mir6 trans- formed the elements of the ordinary into intriguing images that expand the viewer's own consciousness through an open-ended process of suggestion and analogy. As we follow the artist's imaginative act in conflating the objects of nature to reveal underlying formal and experiential realities, we attain something of his own recognition that all phenomena are endowed with meaning, that the whimsical and the serious are inseparably intertwined. In the following passage from his Catalan Notebooks, Joan Mir6 gave us an appropriate summation of his belief in the value of artistic creativity-his words can also serve as a tribute to Harold Joachim's legacy of spirit and excellence: What counts is not one's work, it is the direction one's imagination has taken in life; not what one has done during the course of it, but what can be learned from it, and what it will help other people to do at some future date.23 74</page><page sequence="16">Mir6's Kerosene Lamp NOTES 1.

This image of breast forms attached to a woman's body by taut, wirelike lines may well have been inspired by a prominent scene in Guillaume Apollinaire's well-known play Les Mamelles de Tiresias (The Breasts of Tiresias) of 1917, in which the heroine, Tiresias, opens her blouse and out fly balloonlike breasts that bob around her on string. The artist used more recognizable breasts in another version of this same configuration-his Portrait of Mrs. K. (London, private collection), from the same 1924 series that would culminate in his great picture Maternity (Cagnes-sur-mer, private collection), where a woman's breasts are again represented by abstracted shapes attached to the ends of a thin, taut line. 22.
