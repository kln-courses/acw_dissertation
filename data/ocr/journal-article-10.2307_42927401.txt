Our work this trip was concentrated in the northern group. Bibliographic references are arranged by journal title, then alphabetically by author. Espíritu Santo A survey was made of the east coast of Santo. Data were recorded on a number of shallow, old village sites that contained pottery. A rock-shelter near Hog Harbor at the northeast tip of Santo was excavated, and pottery was recovered from various depths of the midden, which was 2 ft. deep in places. Excavations were carried out in several mounds that contained pottery on the offshore island of Aore. A survey was carried out on Araki Island, just off south Santo, and a number of sites that contained abundant pottery were recorded. Extensive excavations were carried out at two old village sites on Tangoa Island, off south Santo. The up to 3 ft. of midden produced a large collection of pottery and shell im- plements, with some stone and bone artifacts. Mary Elizabeth Shutler made a study of modern pottery-making at the village of Wusi, on the west coast of Santo, and collected pottery from old village sites in the river valleys of the west coast of the island. Malekula Numerous sites with large amounts of pottery were recorded on the east coast of Malekula and on some of the offshore islands such as Vao, Atchin, Wala, Rano, and Uripiv. Stone and wood carvings, stone fences, and stone alignments were recorded on these small islands. This information is added to the extensive collections of pottery previously collected from Malekula. A large number of old village sites, caves, and rock-shelters, and some pictographs have now been recorded for Malekula. # Assistant professor, Department of Anthropology, San Diego State College.</page><page sequence="2">124 Asian Perspectives^ x, 1967 Aoba Several sites with potsherds were discovered on north and south Aoba. Ambrym, Paama , and Pentecost With the cooperation of the British government, it was possible for us to carry out limited surveys on the islands of Ambrym, Paama, and Pentecost. Northeast, southeast, and south- west Ambrym were examined with negative results owing to the very deep volcanic ash that covers the island. The same problem was encountered on Paama. However, we recorded a number of sites on the west coast of Pentecost and collected some pottery and stone axes. Banks Islands and Torres Islands On the Melanesian ship Selwyn, I was able to visit all the Banks Islands, and Hiu, northern- most of the Torres. I recorded a number of old village sites throughout the Banks Islands and made a good sample of stone and shell artifacts. On Hiu in the Torres, I recorded pictographs in a large cave at the northern tip of the island as well as an old village site with stone carvings. The Hiu pictographs are reported in the Pacific Island Monthly ( PIM : Langdon 1967). Southern New Hebrides Considerable additional surveying was carried out on the south and north coasts of Tanna, and a number of promising sites were recorded. We made short trips to Aneityum and Futuna to check previous work. The material from our 1963-1964 and 1966-1967 fieldwork is now being described and analyzed. By correlating over 36 radiocarbon dates now available for the New Hebrides with the limited stratigraphy with artifact and pottery serriation, we anticipate the development of tentative cultural sequences for the New Hebrides, integrated with Garanger's work in the central New Hebrides ( AP : Garanger 1966). The total of our combined efforts should provide a basic understanding of the internal relationships of the New Hebrides and perhaps will shed some light on the origins and external relationships of the New Hebrides, in parti- cular, and for Melanesia in general. It is now demonstrable that these islands have been oc- cupied for at least 3,000 years. Jose Garanger, of the French Centre National de Recherche Scientifique, returned to the New Hebrides in October 1966 and spent another year in intensive survey and excavation around northwest Efate, the surrounding offshore islands, and the Sheperds. New Caledonia During June and July of 1967, continuing work I began in 1952 and 1964, I conducted further excavations at the original Lapita pottery site on the west coast of New Caledonia; I recovered a large sample of Lapita pottery and an intrusive burial. Loyalty Islands For ten days during July 1967, Richard B. Shutler, Luc. F. Chevalier, curator of the Noumea Museum, and I conducted an archaeological survey of Ouvea, Loyalty Islands. We recorded several shallow village sites on the main island of Ouvea with the recovery of a few potsherds that apparently came from New Caledonia. On a small islet at the northwest end of Ouvea, we discovered and photographed several small burial caves. On the islet of</page><page sequence="3">S H ut ler: Melanesia 125 Mouly at the southwest end of Ouvea, we collected more pottery from the mainland. A similar survey was conducted on Maré in 1964, with the recording of a number of old village sites, caves, rock-shelters, stone monuments, and some pottery, apparently from the île de Pins. Walpole Island During June and July of 1967, a French naval and scientific expedition, including Luc F. Chevalier, made two trips to Walpole Island, which lies some distance northeast of New Caledonia. They recovered some Melanesian and Polynesian artifacts in an apparent strati- fied situation, in which the Polynesian artifacts were below the Melanesian. The inferences of this situation are most interesting. The material along with some shell and stone axes and adzes recovered from guano mining operations in the 1920s is being readied for publication by Luc F. Chevalier and me. This 1967 expedition to Walpole Island is reported in the Pacific Island Monthly {PI M : Dunn 1967).
