<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Minoan lion: presence and absence on Bronze Age Crete Andrew Shapland Abstract Animal depictions are frequently treated by archaeologists either as direct reflections of human animal relations or as symbolic of social realities. This paper offers a different way of conceptualizing animal depictions, as objects which mediate between society and human relationships with non human animals. The focus here is on the large number of lions depicted on sealstones from Bronze Age Crete, despite there being no evidence (excluding the depictions themselves) that lions were present on Crete during this period. This paper examines how these depictions change over the course of the Bronze Age, and suggests links between iconographic features and knowledge of, and encounters with, real lions. It considers the interplay between the affordances of lions revealed in the depictions, as dangerous predators, and the affordances of the objects, as a means of social interaction. The Minoan lion is an animal which is neither reducible to its iconographic manifestations nor possible to understand apart from a network of material culture.

Introduction In one scene displayed on the film a troop of four or five lions appears in headlong flight to the right, the hindmost with tail trailing behind, while one braver than the rest turns on his pursuers, his tail swinging above him. (Evans 1930: 122) This description of a scene from a wildlife film comes from the third volume of The Palace of Minos, Sir Arthur Evans's account of the Minoan civilization he was engaged in discovering, and re-creating, at Knossos on the island of Crete. He is adducing the 'remarkable parallelism' between a lion hunt filmed in Tanganyika and that inlaid on the IJ Routledge World Archaeology Vol. 42(2): 273-289 Humans and Animals \ Tayfor^ranciscroup ? 2010 Taylor &amp; Francis ISSN 0043-8243 print/1470-1375 online DOI: 10.1080/00438241003672989</page><page sequence="2">274 Andrew Shapland famous Shaft Grave dagger from Mycenae in mainland Greece (Karo 1930: 95, no. 394). The dagger (Plate 1), he suggests, depicts a 'definite incident' which had been inlaid with remarkable skill: 'It can hardly be doubted that the artist from whose design the engrailed group was drawn had been an eyewitness of such a lion-hunt. The acquaintance of Minoans with lions - rather, we may suppose on the mainland than on insular sites - dates far back' (Evans 1930: 120). It is exactly the Minoan acquaintance, as mediated by material culture, with an animal that was not part of the Cretan fauna that is the subject of this paper. Rather than the animal we know from wildlife films, or even this dagger, it focuses on the way the lion was known in Bronze Age Crete. It is by examining the peculiar Bronze Age Cretan depictions of lions that this paper seeks to explore the role of material culture in human-animal relations. But first it is necessary to reflect on how Cretan depictions of lions have been contextualized, by Evans and subsequent scholars: first, within a knowledge of lions informed by modern technology and, second, within a wider set of depictions from Late Bronze Age mainland Greece. It is by recontextualizing Minoan lion depictions within Bronze Age Cretan material culture and society that they can be seen from a new perspective. Animals into art The parallel which Evans makes explicit between animal depiction and wildlife film offers a useful starting point for considering modern approaches to animal imagery. Evans is arguing for the transparency of the scene on the dagger as a faithful depiction of real events, placing the viewer of the object in the same relation to the lion hunt as the viewer of a film. This straightforward correspondence between event, depiction (whether static or moving) and viewer can be challenged on various grounds, but it is a prevalent approach to animal depictions in archaeology. Palaeolithic cave paintings, for instance, were commonly seen as a faithful record of the local fauna before zooarchaeological studies showed the mismatch between the two (Mithen 1990: 247-9). As Morphy warns, 'animals in art do not provide a window to the world, but a selection from the world, a selection that tells us as much about human societies and human concerns as about the animals themselves' (1989: 14). Although Morphy stresses that animal depictions can provide a window, even if a distorted one, to another culture, from a post-structuralist point of view the window becomes a mirror. This line of argument has recently been applied to ancient Near Eastern animal depictions (Collins 2002), but there is a danger of losing sight of the human-animal relations which ultimately inform the depictions. This danger is exacerbated by the shift Plate 1 Replica of the Lion Hunt Dagger (?

The accessibility of animals via wildlife films, and the profusion of animal imagery in contemporary society, leads Baker (2001: 27) to suggest that our interactions with animals are now highly visual, and that there is a 'space of representation' which shapes our attitudes towards them, independently of interactions with living animals. He terms this process 'disnification', which he sees as the trivialization of animal imagery: 'The animal is the sign of all that is taken not-very-seriously in culture; the sign of that which doesn't really matter' (Baker 2001: 174). Clearly many people in contemporary society do take animals seriously, but Baker's approach highlights the operation of the 'disnified' images of the present as a challenge to thinking about images from a different cultural and historical context. The parallel between dagger and film is easy to dismiss as a type of disnification, blurring the difference between the accessible animal imagery of modernity and the cultural significance of lion hunting in the Mycenaean world. Yet it is harder to dismiss Evans's observation that the same type of lion behaviour is apparent in the two media. Acampora argues against the idea that representations are entirely socially constructed, even if they do not transparently 'produce' the animal to the viewer. He argues for 'translucent' representations of animals, 'not 'in themselves' but in relation to their human, organic and geographic environments' (2001: 303). In other words, the animal encountered by the human is not entirely socially constructed but nor is it free from cultural meaning. Following Acampora, Dombrowski (2002) argues for a 'realist zoontology', which allows for the interaction of human and animal: the lion of the wildlife film and that of Disney's Lion King, potentially inform people's image of the lion encountered in the zoo without the contradictions between these images becoming apparent; press stories about animals attacking zoo intruders, however, challenge the cultural construction (e.g. MacDonald 1994). As Dombrowski suggests, 'There is, from a theoretical point of view, a dynamic interrelationship between our social constructs and the world we attempt to describe and evaluate' (2002: 199). From this point of view the lion is not an arbitrary symbol of power for ancient rulers: although not every ruler will express power using the lion, the choice of the lion can be seen partly as the product of its role as top predator and its dangerousness in relation to humans (Morgan 1998: 29-31). One way to consider the relationship between humans and lions, as depicted on the dagger, is the affordance concept proposed by J. J. Gibson. 'Affordances are properties taken with reference to the observer. They are neither physical nor phenomenal' (Gibson 1979: 143). A lion, for instance, affords danger when pursued by humans, providing a rationale for hunting them for aspirant Mycenaean warriors. The usefulness of the concept is that it can be applied to humans, animals or objects: affordances lie in the relations between entities, and are realized in particular encounters between them. Found in a burial context the dagger afforded display, but the affordance of its sharp edge might have been used in the cutting of meat, hunting or warfare. The depiction on the dagger draws attention to the way in which affordances can be perceived indirectly, through images (Reed 1988: 307). Gibson regarded images as an incomplete substitute for experience, and did not fully develop the consequences of his theory for art objects, which arguably require a more complex account in order to place them in a cultural, rather than just perceptual context (Knappett 2005a: 49). However, the</page><page sequence="4">276 Andrew Shapland value of Gibson's work is exactly in providing a realist account of both perception and human interactions with animals which does not take culture as its starting point. A number of relational approaches to art objects allow the affordances of animals and objects to be considered within a more sophisticated account of images and social interaction, consistent with the affordance concept. Gell (1998) suggests that art objects are indexes from which social agency can be inferred, or 'abducted'. Hence the dagger allows Evans to abduct the agency of an artist who was present at a lion hunt. Even though the artist is no longer present, the dagger survives as an index of their skill. The term index is derived from Peircean semiotics, and denotes a relationship by contact rather than resemblance (iconicity) or convention (symbolism) (Peirce 1998). Summers uses Peirce's index as the basis for his definition of trace as 'an indication of former presence and contact' (2003: 687). He argues that all art objects should be seen as 'real metaphors', meaning that they are substitutions for something that is not present. A similar argument is put forward by Belting (2005a, 2005b), who suggests that images are brought into existence by a perceiving body and a transmitting medium, and hence give form to something through an iconic relationship: 'Images are present because of and through their media, yet they stage an absence of which they are an image' (Belting 2005a: 312-13). From these perspectives the dagger acts as the trace of a lion hunt, leading Evans to believe that the artist was there in person. The dagger is the medium which performs what Belting calls the 'presence of an absence', giving a fleeting encounter with lions a durable form. The following discussion of lion depictions from Bronze Age Crete considers how the affordances of lions were displayed on these objects, but also the role of the object in mediating these affordances. As Knappett (2005b: 85-6) has argued, affordances can be usefully combined semiotics to consider the connections between objects as well as the way people interact with them. This allows a consideration of how people interacted with objects depicting lions and whether these objects were ultimately connected with encounters with lions. Bronze Age Crete Sir Arthur Evans, who used the term Minoan to describe Bronze Age Crete (c. 3200-1100 BC), developed a tripartite chronological scheme of Early, Middle and Late Minoan which is still used to describe the pottery sequence of the island. However, this does not neatly fit with what are seen as the main architectural and social changes during this period, centring on the building of monumental buildings Evans termed 'palaces'. The alternative scheme used here divides the Bronze Age into Prepalatial (3200-1950 BC), Protopalatial (1950-1700 BC), Neopalatial (1700-1450 BC) and Final Palace (1450-1350 BC) (Dickinson 1994: 10-17; Fitton 2002: 28-9). Depictions of lions on Bronze Age seals in particular have often been seen as a window, leading to the persistent suggestion that lions were present on Crete in the Bronze Age (Guest-Papamanoli 1996; Pini 1985: 155-6: Warren 1979: 123). Fossil evidence suggests that lions were not part of the Pleistocene fauna of Crete, and there is no zooarchaeological evidence that lions were present on Crete during the Bronze Age (Jarman 1996; Van der Geer et al. 2006). Lion remains have been found elsewhere in the</page><page sequence="5">The Minoan lion 277 Bronze Age Aegean (Thomas 2004: 189-90; Trantalidou 2000), although not all necessarily indicate the presence of a live lion since pelts can still contain toe bones and animal remains, particularly teeth and claws, become traces of infrequently encountered animals. The curation of jaguar parts in various South American societies provides a useful analogy (Helms 1999: 58; Politis and Saunders 2002: 124-6). The historical, and growing zooarchaeological, evidence for lions in mainland Greece provides, in contrast to Crete, circumstantial evidence that there were wild populations of lions on the Bronze Age Greek mainland (Bloedow 1992: 299; Hughes 2003: 26; Thomas 2004: 192). As will be suggested, the import of lion pelts to Crete helps to explain some of the peculiar iconographic features of Cretan sealstones. Although a wild population of lions on Crete can be discounted, it is possible that lions were brought to Crete in the Late Minoan period, as Younger puts it, as a 'palace showpiece' (1988: xi). As will be argued, a closer reading of iconographic evidence does suggest an increasingly detailed knowledge of lions, and, given the way the major palaces were excavated, the absence of remains is far from conclusive. However, by seeing lion depictions as staging the presence of an absence, as argued above, reading them straightforwardly as indicating the presence of lions is to neglect the way these depictions functioned in Bronze Age Crete. Instead, using depictions to convey knowledge of lions and lion characteristics was a means of social distinction. The opposite extreme in interpretation is also apparent, akin to Baker's argument that animal representations operate independently of the animals themselves. Hence the lion is frequently seen as a symbol, whether of chiefdom in the Prepalatial period (Weingarten 2005: 765) or Mycenaean domination of Crete in the Final Palace period (Hallager and Hallager 1995). These symbolic approaches assert an essentially arbitrary meaning for lion imagery; an analogy is the mediaeval bestiaries, where lions have a variety of allegorical meanings and a frequent identification with Christ (Haist 1999). This anthropomorphism is evident in the rather human-like lion depictions of this period, a tradition even influencing drawings of lions said to be from life (Gombrich 1977: 68; Mezzalira 2002: 38; White 1947: 428). In contrast, the lion depictions of Bronze Age Crete exemplify Gibson's theory of pictures, depicting the affordances of these animals and interactions with them, giving these images an indexical character. It can be suggested that these objects were used to establish connections with lands beyond Crete, and ultimately the practice of lion hunting. Lion depictions from Minoan Crete The following seeks to quantify the appearance of lions in Minoan art, alongside an iconographic treatment. A number of articles have dealt with depictions of lions in the Bronze Age Aegean, but in most discussions the Minoan evidence is merged with Mycenaean iconography, often across media (Ballintijn 1995; Bloedow 1992; Morgan 1988: 44-9; Pini 1985; Thomas 2004). Even without assuming, as Evans did, that the finest art objects in the Shaft Graves at Mycenae were of Minoan manufacture, iconographic interchange between Crete and the mainland is apparent from the Late Bronze Age. The studies tend to focus on the question of the observation of lions and lion hunting, which</page><page sequence="6">278 Andrew Shapland would have occurred on the mainland, using the most detailed Bronze Age depictions. However, of interest here are the lion depictions in circulation on Crete. These depictions convey certain lion characteristics, particularly the mane, but frequently show no understanding of what a lion looks like. However, this is a more complex problem than it appears, since Cretan artists did seem to know what a griffin looked like, in that it has a stable and enduring form. It can be argued that both were understood as animals which inhabited the world beyond Crete: whereas griffins were always known from imported depictions, it is argued here that lion hunting on the mainland resulted in a new source of information about lions in Neopalatial Crete. This helps to explain the changing appearance of lions in Bronze Age Cretan iconography. Seals Pictorial designs on seals first appear in the Prepalatial period, when seals are frequently made from imported hippo ivory as well as local stone. In later periods soft and often brightly coloured imported hard stones were used in the manufacture of seals. Late Minoan depictions show that seals were worn around the wrist, while others are likely to have been worn as pendants (Krzyszkowska 2005: 21); this allows them to be associated with individual people, although this person might be using a seal as heirloom or as the holder of an office. In other words, seals afforded use by individual people, although it is difficult to establish a one-to-one correspondence between seal and user. Their prime function was to make impressions in clay, which have survived as sealings when accidentally fired. Hence seals were used to create material traces of their users in clay in a bureaucratic context. The question is why so many seals and sealings showed lions and other wild animals. Cretan seals and sealings have been well-published in the Corpus der Minoischen und Mykenischen Siegel (CMS), and the numerical data in this paper are based on analysis of all seals and sealings depicting animals published in the CMS volumes for Cretan collections. Given the exchange of objects between Crete and the mainland this selection is more likely to be representative of the seals in circulation in Bronze Age Crete than an analysis of all extant Minoan seals. Seals and sealings can be dated by context, particularly so for the sealing deposits found in the destruction deposits marking the end of the palatial periods. This contextual information provides a useful anchor for the stylistic dating of unstratified seals. The stylistic groups referred to below indicate the considerable effort that has gone into the close dating of seals (Krzyszkowska 2005: 10-11); the broad cultural periods used here largely overcome uncertainties over exact dating. Most of the seals illustrated are typical of groups of lion depictions; the anomalous seals are included for particular features of interest. The lion is the second most frequent closely identifiable animal on Cretan seals (Fig. 1), and the most frequently depicted identifiable animal in the Prepalatial period. The characteristics of Prepalatial lions are distinct from later depictions: as can be seen from a typical depiction (Plate 2a) from the so-called 'Parading Lions and Spirals Group' group (Yule 1980: 208-9), bodily proportions are the most distinguishing feature, as well as the indication of a mane. In the absence of lions on Crete in this period, the most likely explanation for the accurate depiction of their proportions is imported depictions</page><page sequence="7">The Minoan lion 279 35-_____?-__-_? ?

(Weingarten 2005: 763); apart from these iconic characteristics they do not reveal information about lion affordances. Lions do appear on an imported Syrian cylinder seal from a Prepalatial tomb at Mochlos, illustrating the possibility of iconographic transfer; as Aruz (2008: 40, 65) points out however, the circular composition of these seal depictions and the more streamlined depictions of lions are distinctly Aegean rather than Levantine. Prepalatial zoomorphic lion seals have close parallels with Egyptian zoomorphic amulets. Plate 2b shows an example with a distinctive ridged mane made from a synthetic material composed of powdered steatite seemingly imitating Egyptian manufacture. Zoomorphs in this material are collectively known as 'white pieces', and include other Egyptian forms such as scarabs (Pini 1990; Aruz 2008: 57-61). An ivory seal from Kalathiana shows a sitting lion with a human underneath, which Evans (1928: 55, fig. 26) saw as an example of the Egyptian idea of the guardianship of the dead, but which has also</page><page sequence="8">280 Andrew Shapland been seen as showing lions as a threat to humans (Bloedow 1992: 302). Egyptian zoomorphs of this kind are not known to have human figures underneath, discounting Evans's suggestion (Aruz 2008: 58). Whereas Aruz sees it within a Near Eastern tradition of showing fallen enemies, Bloedow's interpretation requires the lion form to be imported into a cultural context which was informed about the threat of lions, presumably from the mainland. However, the lion's alfordances are not otherwise clearly indicated in the Prepalatial period because it is typically shown standing or walking. Even on a seal (Platon 1969: no. 222) from Marathokephalo which has been interpreted as a possible Prepalatial lion hunt scene (Krzyszkowska 2005: 67), there is no interaction between human and lion. Based on the depictions alone, the lion can best be seen as having iconic significance whose value derived from indexing prestigious imports rather than unseen lions. As can be seen in Figure 1, there is a dip in the proportion of lions on seal depictions in the Protopalatial period: this can be seen as a watershed between two distinct sets of depictions. On the three-sided prism seals typical of this period, bodily proportions and indication of a mane remain the lion characteristics. A lion on a three-sided prism from Ayios Charalambos (Plate 3a) shows a striated mane which resembles 'white piece' lions; neither requires an understanding of what a mane was. Other depictions from the same period are less easy to see as a continuation of the Prepalatial imagery; Pini (1985: 165) suggests that it is during the Protopalatial period that first-hand observations of lions are first apparent in seal depictions. At the end of the period, from the Phaistos palace sealing deposit, comes a lion depiction which is far more detailed than anything seen before (Plate 3b), although the V-shapes on the mane are markedly stylized. Again this shows the form of the lion but not its affordances. Here, however, it is shown in a landscape; it can be argued that this is among the first 'naturalistic' animal depictions on seals, the plants locating it beyond the domestic sphere. A peculiarly Cretan group of lions with a circular head and dotted eye has been identified, dated to the Neopalatial period (Betts 1981; Younger 1983; Younger and Betts 1979). An example with a spear over its back comes from a securely dated sealing deposit at Zakros (Plate 4a); these depictions are common on soft stone seals, that is, locally available material rather than imported hard stone (Pini 1995). The attribution of some by Betts (1981) to the 'Jasper Lion Master' illustrates that some of the most characteristic are carved on hard stone seals like jasper, so that the appearance of the lion was not entirely dictated by material. Their most interesting aspect, that is, how unlike lions they appear compared with earlier depictions, is often attributed to the competence of the engraver, ^^^^^ Plate 3 Protopalatial lion depictions: a) Pini (1992a: no. 43); b) Pini (1970: no. 270).</page><page sequence="9">The Minoan lion 281 'certainly not one of the greatest artists of LMI glyptic' (Betts 1981: 7) or 'sehr mdfiige Arbeiten\ very mediocre pieces (Pini 1995: 196). Instead one can argue that they illustrate that the engraver knew two things about a lion, that it had a mane and tufted tail, but was unclear on the head and overall appearance. Rather than the continuation of earlier imagery, the most obvious explanation for this is that these depictions were based on lion pelts, with claws, which effectively convey these characteristics, but not a lion's proportions or head shape. Less common frontal depictions of lions, such as a steatite lentoid excavated at Episkopi Pediados (Plate 4b), show this particularly clearly. There are also very detailed lion depictions on Neopalatial seals. A sealing from Ayia Triada (Plate 5a) shows a lion with an arrow in its side: even this depiction, however, could be based on a pelt because of the way the feet are depicted, arguably more like toe bones. At the same time it is an unambiguous depiction of lion hunting. The detail of this hard stone depiction, conveying information simultaneously about skilled craftsmanship and lion hunting, can be seen in contrast with the less informative soft stone seal depictions. This could indicate that there was competition among seal users for the most detailed depictions of lion hunting, as a means of demonstrating superior knowledge, as well as access to skilled engraving and imported materials. The implication perhaps intended is that the seal owner has hunted or encountered such a dangerous animal, an activity shown rarely on Cretan seals, but which does appear on a sealing from Chania (Pini 1992a: no. 135). More generally the seal creates an association between seal owner and this socially Plate 4 Neopalatial soft stone lion depictions: a) Pini (1998: no. 70); b) Platon and Pini (1985: no. 156).

Seal depictions convey an interesting mix of, from a zoological point of view, correct and incorrect information about lions. Ballintijn (1995: 36) argues that the wounded lion pose is in fact borrowed from dogs and cattle. The same can be said of the scenes of a lion, with a mane suckling a cub (e.g. Pini 1992b: no. 276). She argues, however, that the mane is a useful way to identify a lion, rather than this betraying a lack of first-hand experience of lions. A final incongruity is the fact that lionesses tend to do the attacking, but again lions with manes are shown in attack scenes (which account for 19 per cent of lion depictions in the Neopalatial, and 25 per cent in the Final Palace period). A sealing from Myrtos Pyrgos (Plate 5b), impressed by a ring dated to LMI, with two lions attacking a cow, is mirrored by the hunting behaviour of African lions (Pini 1985: 154). There are other Neopalatial ring impressions showing lions, including the famous Mother on the Mountain sealing (Pini 2002: no. 256), where lions flank a female figure, and lions running in front of a palm tree (Pini 2002: no. 298). On the other hand, the arrangement of a Final Palace seal (Plate 6a), with a lion running alongside a cow and biting it, is borrowed from dog behaviour (Pini 1985: 162). Ballintijn and Pini usefully compare these depictions with modern zoological knowledge, showing which aspects of the depictions could have been based on observation. However, the discrepancies do not affect the information conveyed in these depictions about the lion's affordances, as a dangerous animal capable of attacking goats or cattle. Depictions of lions in the Final Palace period tend to be seen as more conventional, with more formal poses and designs. Younger (1985: 51-2) suggests that the later lion depictions were hardly based on observation. One argument against this is provided by a sealing from Knossos which, as Rhyne (1970: 186) observed, shows a 'hair star' on the shoulder of the lion (Plate 6b): although this could be an observation imported from the Near East, nevertheless it points to a continuing interest in the details of lion morphology (Arkell 1948; Bate 1950; Kantor 1947). The 'Master of Animals' depictions are typical of the Final Palace period, most often featuring lions either side of a central figure. Bloedow has argued that, rather than seeing such arrangements as symbolic, they can be interpreted as depicting lion subjugation: 'Clearly, this is not a fate which lions would have chosen for themselves, and so depicts in supremely dramatic fashion the sheer violence by which they had been brought into subjection' (Bloedow 1996: 1163-4). Like hunting scenes, these Plate 6 Final Palace depictions of lions: a) Platon and Pini (1984: no. 44), b) Pini (2002: no. 307).</page><page sequence="11">The Minoan lion 283 seals can be seen as providing information about the practices involving lions; these later depictions make explicit the practice of subduing a dangerous animal, and so can be seen, like other depictions of lions, as indexes of a dangerous activity. Lions on Cretan seals are always indexes of overseas contacts: the first evidence for contact with the Near East is in the Prepalatial period, and extensive contacts between Crete and the mainland become apparent in the Neopalatial period. These two periods of contact can be used to explain the way in which information about lions gradually reached Crete, first as proportionally accurate depictions, then lion pelts and, finally, perhaps, the animal itself. Even if lions were brought to Crete, however, depictions continue to show them as dangerous predators, attacking other animals. The mane is the key to lion depictions throughout Minoan seal engraving, and one can see these depictions as increasingly providing information about the animal whose mane it was. Often the information was incorrect, in comparison with modern zoological knowledge about lions, but this is not always a useful standard against which to judge these depictions. To dismiss these differences simply as poor artisanship is to overlook the fact that they can be seen as useful indicators of what the seal engraver and seal owner knew about lions. Later seals displayed the affordances of the lion as a dangerous animal to be hunted. The seal itself afforded the user of the seal a way to demonstrate knowledge of an unfamiliar animal and associate themselves with the animal practice of lion hunting. Yet these seal depictions reveal varying levels of familiarity with lions. Rhyta A small number of lion depictions exist in other media. These media have different affordances from sealstones, and so would be useful in different social contexts. Three zoomorphic rhyta, vessels used for pouring liquids, from the Knossos palace are usually seen as Neopalatial but could be later (Koehl 2006: 122). Manes are indicated on all three, although the best known is usually identified as a lioness (Plate 7). As well as being a naturalistic rendering of a lion this shows another detail of lion anatomy, the superciliary vibrissae above the eyes. This feature, also seen on a gold lion's head rhyton found, like the Lion Hunt Dagger, in Shaft Grave IV at Mycenae (Karo 1930: 77-8, no. 273), reveals Plate 7 Lion's head rhyton from Knossos. Author's photo.</page><page sequence="12">284 Andrew Shapland knowledge of lion anatomy which was to become a defining feature of lion depictions in later Greek art. However, as Napier (1986: 113) argues, later artists were often confused about exactly what these marks were, resulting in confused depictions. An important affordance of these vessels was their manipulability. These objects acted as real metaphors, allowing the lion's head to be present during drinking ceremonies or similar performances. The red jasper and rock crystal eyes of the lioness would have made it particularly striking, and a demonstration of complex craftsmanship. However, Miller (1984: 131-5) sets these lion's head rhyta apart from some contemporary bull's head rhyta, whose naturalism and detailing, she suggests, make them almost life-like. Even so, these three-dimensional lion heads mark a new level of realism in Cretan lion depictions, reinforced by their formal qualities; rather than staging an absence, in Belting's terms, they almost stage a presence, blurring the boundary between animal and object. This would have been particularly the case for those who were not familiar with such objects; their impact would have been enhanced if they were used only in occasional socially charged events (Bevan 2007: 11). Fresco Given the prominence of lions in Minoan seal iconography, it is of interest that no fresco depictions of lions are known from Bronze Age Crete. One stucco relief with detailed hair from the Knossos palace has divided opinion between identification as a fragment of a lion's mane or bull's head (Evans 1928: 332-5, 1935: 538). Hood (1994 [1978]: 73), followed Evans, describing it as 'lion seizing prey', but this ambiguous fragment is not clear evidence for lion frescoes or attack scenes at Knossos (Shaw 1995: 115). In contrast, frescoes of cattle are frequent. This can be explained by regarding the frescoes as one of the media through which bull-leaping was given a permanent presence at the palace at Knossos, complementing an activity that took place in the vicinity. Lion hunting was an overseas activity largely restricted to artefacts associated with the person, namely seals. Conclusion The Mycenaean Lion Hunt Dagger (Plate 1) illustrated the affordances of lions as dangerous animals, attacking deer and humans alike. Requiring specialized knowledge to make, it connected the elite burials at Mycenae with an animal practice of great social significance. The affordances of the dagger, simultaneously a weapon and a depiction of an animal practice, reinforced the connections between a warrior ideology and lion hunting (Marinatos 1990). There is no reason to suggest that it was made by a Minoan craftsman, as Evans did, since no such object has been found in Crete. However, other objects in the Shaft Graves do show evidence for contact, whether direct or indirect, between Crete and the mainland at this time. This coincides with the first depictions of lions on Minoan sealstones which clearly show their affordances, attacking other animals. In the earlier Prepalatial and Protopalatial periods, the form of the lion was known, but its affordances as a predator were not shown, making it likely that these depictions were adapted from</page><page sequence="13">The Minoan lion 285 imported objects from Egypt and the Near East. From the Neopalatial period, not only are these affordances shown, indicating knowledge of lion behaviour, but depictions also frequently include spears. These sealstones acted as material traces of lion hunting, even though the form of the lion is frequently less accurate than earlier depictions, particularly on soft stone seals. It has been argued that this can be related to another material trace of lion hunting, in the form of lion pelts which were probably brought to Crete as hunting trophies, providing the prototypes for lion depictions. From the Neopalatial period onwards, seals were one means to make lion hunting present in a social context in which animal practices involving non-domestic animals were clearly of social significance (Shapland 2010). The zoomorphic rhyta from the Knossos palace show a better understanding of lion anatomy than seals, and their form was suited to making the lion itself present in certain social events; these were effective substitutes. This choice of medium, rather than frescoes, suggests that such a detailed depiction would have been relevant only to a small group of people rather than all users of the palace; whereas seals conveyed knowledge of the characteristics of a lion skin, these vessels, with their rock crystal eyes and realistic carving, acted as real metaphors for lions, but only among an elite social group which had conceivably encountered real lions. Lion hunting was an activity, however, which was extended more widely in Minoan society through material culture. The frequency of lion depictions on seals, but also their idiosyncrasy, could point to a different process, in which using the seal established a connection with lions in a context where few people knew what a lion looked like (including perhaps the seal user). Lion depictions on soft stone seals can be seen as inexpensive products connecting people who had never encountered a lion with an elite animal practice materialized in more detailed depictions on hard stone seals, which were ultimately linked to lion hunting abroad. This paper has sought to place lion depictions within a network of relations involving animals, humans and material culture. Seals were used to leave a trace of their user, and the same logic can be applied to the depiction, however indirectly, as the trace of a practice involving an exotic and dangerous animal. Rather than windows or mirrors these objects can be seen as constituent parts of the extended relations between humans and animals in Bronze Age Crete.
