Lin General Motors Corporation ABSTRACT The Hybrid III dummy is an anthropomorphic (humanlike) test device, generally used in crashworthiness testing to assess the extent of occupant protection provided by the vehicle structure and its restraint systems in the event of vehicle crash. Lumped-parameter analytical models are commonly used to simulate the dummy response. These models, by virtue of their limited number of degrees of freedom, can neither represent accurate three-dimensional dummy geometry nor detailed structural deformations. In an effort to improve the state-of-the-art in analytical dummy simulations, a set of finite element models of the Hybrid III dummy segments - head, neck, thorax, spine, pelvis, knee, upper extremities and lower extremities - were developed. The component models replicated the hardware geometry as closely as possible. Appropriate elastic material models were selected for the dummy "skeleton", with the exterior "soft tissues" represented by viscoelastic materials. The impact response of each individual component was determined by explicit integration finite element analysis. Subsequently, a whole dummy model was assembled from the various segments with appropriate joint characteristics prescribed to allow for dummy articulation. Finally, the thoracic impact force-deformation response was calculated from a ballistic impactor with a mass of 23.4 kg, launched from 2 initial velocities of 6.71 m/s and 4.3 m/s, respectively. The predicted response was compared with standard dummy and human cadavers experimental data. In all calculations, the model response compared favorably with experimental data, and provided a reasonable level of confidence of the model biofidelity. Introduction The Hybrid III dummy is an assemblage of mechanical components designed and manufactured to replicate the human body structural response when subjected to mechanical impact, primarily in the midsagittal plane. It is commonly used in die design of restraint systems, ejection seats and in crashworthiness of automobile structures to assess the potential for human harm, should a vehicle crash occur. Also, the dummy is used to certify the vehicle performance in frontal impact with a rigid barrier. Currently there are three dummy sizes developed to represent the midsagittal impact response of the adult population: 5th-percentile female (small), 50th-percentile male (average) and 95th-percentile male (large). The 50th-percentile dummy was developed first with its physical characteristics - height, weight, size, mass distribution, joint locations, etc. - selected to closely match the median of the U.S. adult male population. The other two dummies were derived from the 50th-percentile by geometric scaling [1]. The 50th-percentile dummy was developed at General Motors in the early 1970's [2]. Steel and aluminum components were used to represent human bones, so that the dummy can be used in repetitive testing without damage. The metallic "skeleton" is covered with pliable vinyl skin to give the dummy a reasonable human look and feel. The material properties of the exterior "soft tissues" encapsulating the various dummy "organs", head, neck, thorax, lumbar spine, knees and articulating joints were selected and tuned, so that their responses match human cadaver response when subjected to midsagittal impact loads. Several transducers are strategically located within the dummy, providing 34 channels of data [3] to monitor the dummy kinematics and associated loads and moments Although the dummy was developed in the early 1970's, it was not accepted by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) for use in compliance testing with FMVSS 208 [4] for passive restraints until 1986. Currently, the Hybrid III dummy is widely used in automotive crash testing when the vehicle is subjected to frontal or oblique impact. The most common test is the vehicle compliance impact test with FMVSS 208, where the vehicle is launched from 30 m.p.h. into a rigid barrier. In the test, the dummy kinematics and exerted loads are monitored and compared with established biomechanical human tolerance data. The vehicle crashworthiness is measured by its structural integrity together with its ability to manage the crash energy so that a properly restrained occupant can achieve a high level of protection. Vehicle crashworthiness is typically achieved by a combination of crash experiments and analytical models. Crashworthiness experiments, particularly when prototype vehicles are used, are extremely expensive. In today's competitive environment, mathematical modeling has been steadily gaining momentum, and it has been quite effective in shortening the design cycle, improving product quality and reducing cost. This paper is concerned with the development and validation of a detailed FE model of the Hybrid III dummy. The model development initially focused on geometric model building and comparing the impact response of the primary dummy segments - head, neck, thorax, lumbar spine and knee - with corresponding experimental data. Then, all of the dummy segments were assembled with appropriate descriptions of joint characteristics to simulate articulation and relative motion among the various segments. Finally, the assembled dummy, while in a seated position, was subjected 1868</page><page sequence="2">to a ballistic pendulum impact on the thorax and the whole dummy response was compared with a standard test used in dummy calibration. The developed model can enhance our capabilities in: 1. further understanding of the dummy biofidelity and its sensitivity to impact loads of various severities and directions beyond the midsagittal plane; 2. simulations of interactions and calculation of contact loads between restraint systems (air bag, three point belts and knee bolster) and an occupant in typical crash environments; 3. integration with a vehicle structure to develop a vehicle-occupant system model that can be used in crashworthiness studies to assess how variations in vehicle structure can influence the occupant response; 4. advancing the state-of-the-art in dummy development, particularly for nonstandard anthropometry. Dummy Description The 50th-percentile Hybrid III dummy (Figure 1), commonly known as an Anthropomorphic (humanlike) Test Device (ATD), represents state-of-the-art in biofidelic impact response in the midsagittal plane. Although the dummy geometry is based on human anthropometric measurements, and its component or subassembly responses closely match human cadaver responses, it does not necessarily behave like a human. In fact its "skeleton" is nonfrangible, constructed from metallic components (steel and aluminum) which provide sufficient durability and maintainability necessary for repetitive use of the device. But the device response can provide sufficient information to enable the prediction of actual human kinematics and joint loads (and/or moments) in dynamic load environments. The dummy segmentation closely resembles an anatomically based segmentation scheme, so that the subassembly weight and center of gravity location can be easily checked and compared with corresponding human data. The main segments comprising the dummy are described below: Head - The head consists of a hollow cast aluminum, thick shell with uniform thickness which approximates the exterior skull geometry. The occipital portion of the shell is removable to allow for mounting and servicing an accelerometer package located within the shell interior. The aluminum shell is covered with a vinyl skin that closely adheres to the skull to prevent the skin from slipping relative to the skull. The skin's physical properties and thickness were "tuned" to assure similar impact response on a rigid surface, with corresponding cadaver head experiments [5]. The head assembly is instrumented with a triaxial accelerometer, located at the head center of gravity, to monitor its three-dimensional translational acceleration response. Neck - The neck consists of four polymeric, nonsymmetric discs, which are geometrically shaped, including a horizontal slit in the anterior part to provide appropriate flexion-extension kinematics, similar to human cadaver response. The polymeric neck segments are sandwiched between aluminum discs to provide the neck with the necessary structural stiffness. A flexible steel cord is inserted along the neck axis to provide tensile strength. The neck top plate is connected to the head by a pin joint to simulate head rotation about a lateral axis through the occipital condyles. The neck lower part is a serrated bracket that attaches to the thoracic spine box via an adjustable joint to maintain the base plane of the head horizontal, or as demanded by the seating configuration. Figure 1. Hybrid III Dummy Interior and Exterior Components Shoulders - The shoulders assembly, consists of cast aluminum articulated linkages between the spine and the upper arms. Rubber blocks, pivots and bushings are inserted among the various parts to allow for flexibility and prevent metal-to-metal contact. The structure is designed to allow for weight control and durability. The whole assembly is contoured to provide a good shoulder-to-belt fit and to provide a realistic setting for 3 -point harness evaluation. Thorax - The thorax assembly, consists of six spring steel ribs lined with a damping material along the lateral sides of its interior surface to provide a viscoelastic/damped response. The ribs are connected at the back to a "thoracic spine", manufactured from welded steel plates which resembles a hollow box beam structure. An adjustable bracket is mounted at the top of the steel box to provide support for the neck. An inclined steel plate is mounted at the bottom of the thoracic spine which attaches to the "lumbar spine". The ribs are attached at the front to a plexiglass plate to simulate a "sternum". The thorax assembly is covered with a removable vinyl jacket, with a soft foam pad inserted at the sternum plate. A triaxial accelerometer transducer resides within the thoracic spine, approximately at the assembly's center of gravity, to monitor its three-dimensional acceleration. In addition a displacement transducer is mounted between the sternum and the thoracic spine to measure the chest compression in the midsagittal plane. Lumbar Spine - The lumbar spine is a thick curved cylindrical member, manufactured from stiff "polyacrylate 1869</page><page sequence="3">elastomer" rubber, to provide for a realistic human posture in a car seated position. Two flexible steel cords run through the middle of the cylinder to provide lateral stability while allowing fore and aft mobility. The lumbar spine is secured to the thoracic spine plate and to the "pelvis" by four screws. Pelvis - The pelvis consists of a cast aluminum structure with a geometry that somewhat resembles a human's pelvic bone structure. It is encased by soft rubber material to approximate the shape of human buttocks, which also houses a triaxial accelerometer. Lower Extremities - The lower extremities consist of the upper legs, lower legs, knee joints and feet. The upper and lower legs have steel inserts surrounded with soft rubbery material to simulate the look and, to some extent, the feel of human flesh. The knee joints consist of a cast aluminum cap with a steel clevis. The knee joint is constructed in such a way as to allow for applying a pre- specified torque to the pin joint. Upper Extremities - The upper extremities consist of the upper arms, lower arms and hands. They are constructed from steel shafts with appropriate joints at the shoulders, elbows and wrists to simulate the various degrees of freedom for arm motion. Similar to the lower extremities, all steel components are covered with soft rubbery material. The segments anthropometry, weights and center of gravity locations can be found in Reference [6] . Table 1 lists a summary of the 50th-percentile Hybrid III dummy inertial properties which were developed for the purpose of lumped parameter modeling. Table 1. Masses and Moments of Inertia of the 50th- Percentile Hybrid III Dummy. Several lumped-parameter models, however, were developed as early as 1963 [8] to simulate occupant response to a vehicle crash pulse. Later, two-dimensional [9] and three-dimensional [10] codes were introduced and became known as Crash Victim Simulation (CVS) codes. In the early 1980's a multi-body code (MADYMO) was developed by TNO [11] to simulate multi-body systems using rigid-body mechanics formulation. The three-dimensional CAL3D code was used to simulate occupant interactions with the steering system, [12] and the MADYMO code [13] was applied to simulate dummy interactions with an inflated air bag. The primary concern in developing these models is accurate representation of occupant kinematics and associated acceleration and forces at each dummy segment center of gravity and of moments at the joints. It must be emphasized, however, that the analyst is required to make some judgments on how the dummy is divided into a group of lumped masses. Also, experimental data to describe the force-deformation response between the dummy and interior components that are likely to be contacted must be provided. In spite of their limitations, the lumped-parameter models have provided, and still provide, an effective analytical tool, particularly useful for non-intensive calculations. In the hands of an experienced user, they provide an effective design tool. Perhaps the main limitation of the lumped-parameter dummy models lie in their inability to represent the three-dimensional geometry of the dummy and to predict contact forces and deformations associated with dummy impact and interactions with other structures. In fact, in spite of the three-dimensional analytical techniques used to analyze the dummy response, it must rely on unidirectional force-deformation data, measured experimentally, to calculate impact/contact forces. There is an obvious need to develop detailed dummy models based on deformable structural mechanics and appropriate material description. Such a model can be used in : 1. improving the dummy response, and providing further understanding on how this relatively simple mechanical structure can replicate human response to mechanical impact; 2. design of seats and restraint systems, including belts, air bags and knee bolster; 3. integration with vehicle structures to develop system models to enable the analyst to assess in real time the influence of structural variations and restraint characteristics on occupant protection; 4. shifting from primary reliance on testing environments in vehicle design for crashworthiness to a balanced experimental/analytical method, which can save both time and cost. However, the developments of such detailed models is associated with considerable effort in model building and validation. In addition, the calculation time increases by about an order of magnitude. Status of FE Dummy Models - The FE technique represents our best mechanics-based knowledge for analyzing the transient response of geometrically complex structures with nonlinear material behavior, subject to large deformations. Dummy modeling is characterized by the following attributes: complex three-dimensional geometry consisting of solids, beams and shells, several materials with elastic, elastic-plastic and viscoelastic behavior, dynamic response persisting for about 100 ms, time- varying boundary conditions from contact impact and interactions with other 1870 Principal Moment of Inertia Mass kg cm* *2 Segment (kg) 11 12 13 Head 4.5 238.0 180.0 137.0 Neck 1.02 19.0 18.7 9.4 Thorax U7.5 2801.5 2472.1 1157.9 Abdomen 18.5 1682.4 1449.9 1112.6 Upper Leg* 7.4 1032.7 1031.4 126.2 Lower Leg* 4.16 937.7 929.3 41.8 Foot* 1.78 111.4 109.4 20.6 Upper Arm* 2.76 225.7 218.9 26.2 Lower Arm* 1.67 131.8 129.3 11.5 Hand* 0.6 15.0 12.1 7.2 *Values for one side. The dummy mass is approximately 78.3 kg. The moments of inertia shown are principal values computed at the C.G. of the component. Dummy Modeling During the development process of the dummy, experimental techniques were primarily used to design the various hardware components, so that their mechanical impact responses mimic as closely as possible human cadaver data. To our knowledge, only the thorax development was accompanied by a discrete spring-mass- damper model, developed by Lobdell [7], to simulate its transient response to impact.</page><page sequence="4">structures and nonlinear joints that are used in assembling the dummy segments. The first FE Hybrid III dummy model was presented in 1991 [14]. It simulated the dummy structure by a combination of solid, shell and beam elements. This dummy was represented by approximately 5,000 nodes and 3,000 elements and used explicit-integration, nonlinear FE analysis. Another Hybrid III dummy model was presented in 1991 [15], which simulated the dummy with 5,000 shell elements. However, details of interior dummy component models were not provided. Comprehensive models of the Hybrid III thorax and comparisons with experimental data were developed in 1991 [16, 17]. The current dummy model extends our previous thorax model work [16] to include all dummy segments. Accurate geometric representation of the dummy hardware and component validation against experimental data are the main ingredients which distinguish this dummy model from others, which appeared in the literature thus far. Analysis - The nonlinear EE code DYNA3D was used for calculating the impact response of the dummy models. A complete description of the code can be found in references [18, 19]. The code utilizes updated Lagrangian mechanics to formulate the semi-discrete equations of motion. The equations of motion are derived by applying the principle of virtual work to a weak form of the momentum equation. The spatially discretized second-order equations in time are solved by a central difference (explicit) technique. This integration technique requires no formulation of die global- stiffness matrix, and thus reduces computer storage and cost. The calculation cost is further reduced by using reduced integration and "hourglass" control to rid the response of the spurious zero energy modes. Figure 2. FE Model of the Hybrid III Dummy. The FE Model - The Hybrid III dummy model, shown in Figure 2, was developed by using the mesh generator INGRID [20] to replicate all dummy components, both interior and exterior. The model at this time, consists of 53 parts, built from a combination of solid elements (6,782), thin shell elements (530) and beam elements (264). The Figure 3. FE Models of the Interior Components of the Hybrid III Dummy and Joint Locations. Figure 4. FE Models of the Polyvinyl Exterior Components of the Hybrid III Dummy. 1871</page><page sequence="5">total number of nodes is 13,975. Figure 3 shows the interior parts of the dummy, which are represented by rigid parts with the exception of the lumbar spine, sternum and sternum pad. The exterior skin of the dummy model is shown in Figure 4. Table 2 lists the joints, their stiffness, connecting parts, and motion types. The stiffnesses used here are preliminary values based on lumped-parameter models. They have yet to be verified by comparing the dummy response with sled tests. Table 3 provides a summary of the model parts including their material constitutive types, number of elements and type of element. It can be observed that the majority of the parts constituting the dummy "skeleton" are defined as rigid materials. The deformable materials are: the rib cage, "soft tissues" covering the "skeleton", lumbar spine and neck rubber discs. However, it should be realized that any rigid part can be easily changed to a deformable component once its material properties are specified. The rigid parts characteristics are specified by defining their material mass densities. The deformable material properties are generally considered viscoelastic in shear and elastic in compression. Specific values have been determined experimentally [16] for the thorax segment, and were used for the whole dummy. Some adjustments were necessary to insure that the component's impact response match experimental data. The specific material constants are listed in the Appendix. Table 2. Description of Joints.

These segments and their corresponding part numbers, masses and principal moments of inertia are listed in Table 4. The dummy assembly's mass (without any instrumentation) is 78.8 kg which is almost identical to the actual Hybrid III hardware mass of 78.3 kg. Adjustment of the dummy model mass to account for instrumentation can be trivially achieved by adding lumped nodal masses at the location of the transducers. Also, although not shown, the CG. locations of the various segments were within few millimeters of the hardware segments. In comparing the model parts' moments of inertia with those from the hardware (Tables 1 and 4), some differences can be observed. The influence of these differences on overall dummy kinematics has not yet been evaluated. Further evaluation of the dummy assembly response in crash environments involving vehicle collision with a barrier and sled tests will be addressed in a future study. Geometric modifications of the component models will be addressed and reconciled to insure that the principal moments of inertia and their orientations agree with data from hardware measurements.

The occipital removable cap in the hardware was not modeled separately, rather it was considered as an integral part of the whole shell. Also, the interior compartment which accommodates the accelerometer package was not modeled. The exterior head geometry, however, was accurately modeled to represent the engineering design drawings. The dummy inertial properties, based on geometry and mass density (Table 4) closely represent the corresponding values of the hardware. The original head hardware development, including head anthropometry, landmark locations, inertial characteristics and comparisons with human cadaver data can be found in a comprehensive study by Hubbard and McLeod [5].

In a typical crash test, the head is subject to a combination of: inertial load, transmitted through the neck, and direct impact from interacting with the vehicle interior and/or the restraint system. In an indirect impact the head behaves almost like a rigid body. In a direct impact, the exterior vinyl layer plays an important role in the magnitude and duration of die contact force and the associated kinematics. The impact severity is assessed by the Head Injury Criterion (HIC) [21], which is based on a weighted- time integral of the three-dimensional head acceleration measured at the CG. HIC is the acceptable measure for compliance with FMVSS 208. The complete three- dimensional head kinematics describing both head rotation and translation can be calculated from a 12- one-dimensional accelerometer cluster located within the head interior [22]. The dummy head compliance test requires a free drop of the head onto a rigid surface from a height of 376 mm. In the test die head is suspended such that the initial contact widi the rigid plate occurs at die forehead as shown in Figure 5. The biomechanical performance requires a peak head acceleration in the range 225 - 275 g measured at the CG. The head acceleration is filtered at SAE filter class 1000. Two impact simulations of the FE dummy head model, shown in Figure 5, were conducted where the head was allowed to drop freely and impact a rigid surface from initial velocities corresponding to drop heights: 376 and 889 mm, respectively. In the calculations, the aluminum shell was considered rigid and the exterior polyvinyl layer was considered viscoelastic in shear and elastic in compression. This type of simulation resembles a classic Hertzian contact problem [23]. The model acceleration-time response, shown in Figure 6, captured the peak and duration quite well. However it can be observed that the predicted pulse shape is symmetric, unlike what is obtained from the test, where the rebound phase is longer. This asymmetric contact pulse is believed to be due to a difference in energy loss in the rubber material during the approach and rebound phases of contact. This behavior can not be included in the material model with its current formulation, which provides only for symmetric treatment of material response. The HIC values obtained from these pulses were within 7% of the experimental results, and therefore the skewness of the pulse does not seem to significantly influence the results of the FE model. Interestingly, the total energy calculated was not constant during the contact event. It showed a dip almost reflecting the contact pulse. This dip was verified to be due to the Figure 5. Head Impact Test Setup and Corresponding FE Model. 1873</page><page sequence="7">Figure 6. Measured and Calculated Head Acceleration- Time Response coupling between the deformable outer layer and the rigid shell. When the shell material was treated as deformable this dip disappeared. The model rebound velocity was nearly equal to the initial velocity, indicating little energy loss. The peak accelerations obtained: 255 and 475 g, respectively match closely the experimental data [5]. Neck - The FE neck model (Figure 7d) was developed to simulate the neck hardware described earlier in Section 2.2 using primarily three-dimensional brick elements. The elastomeric viscoelastic disc models contain thin horizontal cuts, about 20 mm deep, in the anterior part of the discs, so together with the disc asymmetry it can simulate the difference in neck stiffness for extension and flexion motions. A contact constraint was defined for each of the disc's slits. The material properties were identified by requiring the model response to match corresponding experimental data. This parameter identification technique or "reverse engineering" can be used in analysis where accurate material properties are difficult to obtain. Specific material constants are included in the Appendix. Figure 7 shows the head-neck assembly, neck hardware and corresponding FE models. To validate the neck model, the standard procedure described in the Code of Federal Regulations [24] was followed. The test consists of a pendulum drop with pre- specified length, mass and moment of inertia in the vertical plane. For the extension test, the regulation specifies an impact velocity in the range of 5.95 to 6.19 m/s whereas in the flexion test the range can vary from 6.89 to 7.13 m/s. The head-neck assembly attaches to the lower extremity of the pendulum bar in two configurations, as shown in Figure 8, to simulate extension and flexion motions, respectively. The pendulum impact energy is absorbed by an aluminum Honeycomb block. In a drop silo test of a block of Honeycomb material (100 x 100 x 100 mm), at an impact velocity of 7.5 m/s, the pulse had nearly a square shape with a duration of 5.5 ms and a peak force of about 3.9 kN. The pendulum bar is instrumented with a one-dimensional accelerometer mounted on the surface opposite from the contact location with the Honeycomb block. The pendulum deceleration response for extension (flexion) must be in the range of 17.2 - 21.2 g (22.5 - 27.5 g) at 10 ms, 14.0 - 19.0 g (17.6 - 22.6 g) at 20 ms and 11 - 16 g (12.5 - 18.5 g) at 30 ms, and can not exceed 22.0 g (29 g). A load transducer is mounted at the head-neck joint to measure the moment-time response about a lateral axis through the occipital condyles. The measured moment in extension (flexion) should be in the range 52.9 - 80.2 Nm (88.4 - 108.8 Nm) and should occur between 65 - and 79 ms (47 and 58 ms). Also, the moment should decay to 0 Nm between 120 and 148 ms (97 and 107 ms). The head rotation is measured by the rotation of D- plane as shown in Figure 8. The regulation specifies for extension (flexion) a rotation in the range 81-106 degrees (64 - 78 degrees) and should occur in the time interval 72 ms - 82 ms (57-64 ms) and should drop to 0 degrees between 147 and 174 ms (113 and 128 ms) . Two FE calculations were obtained to simulate extension and flexion motions, as shown in Figure 8. The models simulated two tests conducted at impact speeds of 6 m/s for extension and 7 m/s for flexion. The simulation kinematics for a time duration of 90 ms, at 20 ms intervals, are shown in Figure 9 for extension and in Figure 10 for flexion, respectively. The overall kinematics appears quite realistic and seems to capture the essential features of the anterior- posterior head-neck motion in the midsagittal plane as observed from actual tests. The calculated response histories from extension and flexion simulations are shown in Figures 11 and 12 for pendulum acceleration, moment at the occipital condyles joint and D-plane rotation, along with corresponding experimental data and compliance ranges. The predicted response matched the experimental data quite well for flexion and extension motions; and they also seem to satisfy the regulation requirements for pendulum acceleration and D-plane rotation. However, it may be noticed that the calculated moments for both extension and flexion are higher than the experimental data by 28% and 23%, respectively. This discrepancy is believed to be due to lack of exact material data. Future improvement of the dummy model should include accurate identification of the deformable components materials response. 1874</page><page sequence="8">Figure 7.

In a previous publication [16], the development and validation of an isolated thorax model was discussed in detail. In this study, the thorax model response was validated in situ. In addition, an impactor with a mass of 23.4 kg and diameter equal to 150 mm was launched to impact the thoracic mid-region from an initial velocity of 6.71 m/s, similar to the thoracic validation test, as shown in Figure 13, instead of applying a direct force-time pulse, as used previously in thorax validation [16]. Figures 14a and 14b show a midsagittal cross section of the calculated dummy deformations in the time span 0 - 55 ms, at 5 ms intervals. The maximum deformation (65 mm) was reached at 25 ms, which is consistent with experimental data [16]. The calculated force deformation response agreed quite well with measured data from human cadavers, as shown in Figure 15. The comparison with dummy experiments was shown in Reference [16]. A second calculation of the thoracic impact force-deformation response was obtained for an impact velocity of 4.3 m/s, as shown in Figure 16. From the two simulations, it appears that the thorax model captured the essential features of the hardware and accurately represented the thoracic response to impact in the midsagittal plane. Lumbar Spine - The short curved cylinder representing the lumbar spine was modeled by eight-node brick elements which accurately represented the exterior shape of the component. At this time no attempt was made to include the two flexible cables. Instead, it was assumed that the elastomeric rubber material would dominate the flexural response in the midsagittal plane. It should also be pointed out that the lumbar spine represents the only deformable component of the Hybrid III spine, i.e, no significant deformation is expected, under normal usage of the dummy between the neck and the lumbar spine. The elastomeric rubber material was represented by a Blatz-Ko rubber model [18]. The large deformation material response is assumed elastic with a Poisson's ratio of 0.463. To identify the shear modulus of the material, an experiment described in reference [25] was simulated, which provided the moment-rotation response of the lumbar spine in the midsagittal plane. In the model a moment-time ramp function was applied at one end of the model while keeping the other end constrained. The calculated deformed shape was then compared with the experimental response to insure that accurate kinematics of the component are captured. By iteratively varying the material shear modulus, it was noted that when G was 460 MPa and the material density was 1.3 gm/cm**3, the model response agreed quite well with experimental data as shown in Figure 17. Accordingly, this model was considered adequate, at this time, to represent the basic behavior of the lumbar spine despite exclusion of the flexible cables. Knee Joint - The geometry of the knee model is an approximate representation of the hardware as shown in Figure 18. It consists of a cylindrical surface, rigidly attached to the distal end of the femur shaft. A layer of viscoelastic material to simulate the knee padding surrounds the exterior surface of the knee joint. The knee joint articulates with respect to the tibia shaft by a pin joint, and, at this time, does not exactly replicate the femur-knee-tibia complex of the Hybrid III dummy. Figure 13. Thoracic Impact Test Setup and Corresponding FE Model To evaluate the knee padding, an FE model of the knee joint, distal femur, and lower leg was isolated from the dummy model and subjected to pendulum impact along the femoral axis, similar to the test set up, as shown in Figure 18 [2]. The femoral shaft was fixed to simulate the very large mass used in the test. Three cylindrical impactors were used with diameters of 51, 51 and 76 mm and masses: 0.5, 1.5 and 5 kg, respectively [2]. The impactor velocity for all 3 simulations was 2.1 m/s. The knee padding material of the Hybrid III dummy was selected to provide a peak force similar to measurements from human cadaver. In the test, the knee force was calculated from the mass of the impactor and its one-dimensional rigid-body acceleration. A similar procedure was followed in the FE simulations. The first simulation modeled the 0.5 kg impactor. In this test the material property was assumed viscoelastic in shear and elastic in compression with material constants selected so 1880</page><page sequence="14">Figure 14a.

The force-time response shown in Figure 19 represented nearly a Hertzian contact force persisting for about 3.5 ms, and the simulation was considered adequate in representing the padding material response. The impact durations are not provided in reference [2]. In the second simulation the impactor mass was increased to 1.5 kg and in the third simulation the mass of the impactor was increased to 5 kg with a diameter of 76 mm, while maintaining the same material properties used in the first simulation. The force time pulses (Figure 19) showed an increase in contact duration to 5.5 and 8.5 ms with peak forces of 2.2 and 5.3 kN. The peak forces agreed quite well with reported experimental data (2.05 and 5.7 kN) [2]. Figure 17. Moment-Rotation Response of Lumbar-Spine from Experiment and FE Calculation. Conclusions FE models of the Hybrid III dummy components - head, neck, shoulders, thorax complex, pelvis, upper extremities and lower extremities - were developed to simulate as closely as possible corresponding hardware of the dummy. The dummy "skeleton" consisted of metallic materials (aluminum and steel) covered with polyvinyl soft "skin" to simulate the exterior soft tissues. All metallic parts were assumed rigid, with the exception of the thorax rib cage which was treated as elastic with appropriate discrete dampers to simulate the ribs damping material. Viscoelastic material properties were assigned to all deformable components. Component validation tests were conducted for the head, neck, thorax, lumbar spine, and knees. The impact responses of all these components agreed quite well with experimental data and provided an acceptable level of confidence in the models. Subsequently, all components were assembled using appropriate joint kinematics and characteristics similar to those used in lumped parameter models of the dummy. The impact response of the whole dummy when subjected to thoracic impact from two initial velocities (6.71 and 4.3 m/s) were calculated. For the 6.71 m/s impact condition the calculated force-deflection response was in good agreement with corresponding experimental data from human cadavers. 1883</page><page sequence="17">Also, the deformed configurations of the assembled dummy assured that all dummy parts are properly connected. Figure 18. Knee Joint Impact Test Set Up and Corresponding FE Model. Figure 19. Calculated Force-Time Response from Three Knee Impact Calculations. Final validation of the assembled dummy with sled tests is yet to be conducted to evaluate the influence of segment inertial properties and joint definitions. Also, the material properties used in this simulation relied primarily on ad-hoc parameter identification. There is an obvious need to identify accurate viscoelastic materials response and incorporate them in the next release of the dummy model, particularly for the neck and the lumbar spine.

APPENDIX A Material Properties The Hybrid III dummy is manufactured from several metallic and nonmetallic parts. The material properties of the metallic parts (Table A.l) were assumed elastic. Their constants were obtained from the open literature, with the exception of the lumbar spine properties, which were identified by matching the model response with test data, using a Blatz-Ko [19] rubber model.

The Viscoelastic model used can be written as: G(t) = Goo + (G0 - Goo)xe"ßt, Where G0 and Goo are the short-term and long-term shear modulii and ß is the relaxation parameter. We have conducted uniaxial relaxation tests in both tension and compression, respectively, for the thoracic skin material, compression tests for the sternum pad and rib damping 1885</page><page sequence="19">material to identify the material constants, according to the previous equation, the tests were conducted at strain rates of 2.5 - 5.0 mm/mm/s. The bulk modulii were identified from standard one-dimensional tests. A summary of the material properties is listed in Table A.2. It should be emphasized that these values describe quasistatic material behavior, and dynamic tests at higher strain rates need to be conducted for accurate representation of the material response in impact environments, typical of vehicle crash. Also, only few samples were tested, and therefore, the data in Table A.2 may not represent all the inhomogeneity that exist in the soft materials of the dummy.

In this comparison, discrepancies were noted between calculated component responses and experimental results. To reconcile these differences, it was necessary to modify the soft material properties so that an agreement can be obtained, the final material properties used for the head, neck, thorax, upper extremities, lower extremities, pelvis are listed in Table A.3. Although these properties provided calculated response in reasonable agreement with experimental data, there remains a need to verify their accuracy by further testing of the dummy materials in deformation ranges and strain rates consistent with dummy exposure to impact loads.
