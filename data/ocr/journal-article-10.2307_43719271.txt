<plain_text><page sequence="1">374 THE CATHOLIC BIBLICAL QUARTERLY | 47, 1985 william w. hallo et al. (eds.), Scripture in Context II: More Essays on the Com- parative Method (Winona Lake, IN: Eisenbrauns, 1983). Pp. xv + 250. $15.00. The papers published in this volume had their origins in a Summer Seminar of the National Endowment for the Humanities led by William W. Hallo of Yale in 1980. The papers from an earlier seminar in 1978 had already been published in a book (see CBQ 44 [1982] 169-171). The subtitle is somewhat misleading since none of the articles actually deals with methodology ex professo. Rather, the articles are pre- sented as examples of what H. calls a "contextual approach." The most frequently cited characteristic of this methodology is that it uses comparative material in such a way as to point out discontinuities as well as continuities between the Bible and the ancient Near East. This necessity of looking at differences as well as similarities is, of course, one which scarcely any scholar who uses comparative material would care to deny, and though it may well be necessary from time to time to issue warnings about excesses in either direction, the plea for even-handedness can hardly constitute a complete methodology. Indeed, the various essays in the book actually use ancient Near Eastern materials in a variety of ways and there is no observable consistency which would warrant the claim that they serve as exemplars of a specific methodologi- cal approach. Nonetheless, many of the papers are of considerable interest and some make notable contributions. Hallo contributed the first essay, "Cult Statue and Divine Image: A Preliminary Study" (pp. 1-17). He reviews the evidence which points to the conclusion that large- sized anthropomorphic statues of deities are not found in Mesopotamia before the end of the third millennium. This suggests that the generally affirmed view that there is a radical distinction between the aniconic tradition of Israel and the practice of other ancient Near Eastern religions needs at least to be nuanced. Next is "Hittite and Israelite Cultic Practices: A Selected Comparison" (pp. 19- 38), by James C. Moyer. He finds that the Israelite scapegoat ritual and various procedures for custody and policing of sanctuaries have Hittite parallels. On the other hand, the OT opposition to consulting the dead, bestiality, transvestite practi- ces, as well as the designation of the pig and dog as unclean, may be reactions against Hittite ritual procedures. In "Ancient Amphictyonies, Sic et Non" (pp. 39-59), Henry E. Chambers sur- veys the well known arguments for and against the view that early Israel was orga- nized according to a pattern that can be called amphictyonic. Instead, C. argues in favor of a parallel with the Sumerian Nippur League, a view promoted earlier in a number of publications by Hallo. William E. Evans contributes "An Historical Reconstruction of the Emergence of Israelite Kingship and the Reign of Saul" (pp. 61-77). Paying attention to the various redactional strata of 1 Samuel and their tendentious points of view, E. attempts to sift out what can confidently be affirmed about the rise of Saul and his reign. His brief review of some comparative materials does not lead to very substan- tial results. Leo G. Perdue's paper, "The Testament of David and Egyptian Royal Inscrip- tions" (pp. 79-96) argues convincingly that the testament of David in 1 Kgs 2:1-12</page><page sequence="2">COLLECTED ESSAYS 375 represents a genre known from Egyptian wisdom literature. This is suggestive in connection with other proposals that the Davidic Court History of 2 Samuel 9-20 and 1 Kings 1-2 has been influenced by wisdom traditions. P. 's essay is a successful example of comparative study. The next article is "Naram-Sin and Jeroboam: the Archtypal Unheilsherrscher in Mesopotamian and Biblical Historiography" (pp. 97-125), by Carl D. Evans. The tendentious presentation of Jeroboam by the Deuteronomist who depicts him as the prototype of the king who offends the deity and brings trouble upon himself and his people is compared to the treatment of Naram-Sin in cuneiform sources. The parallel is cogently presented and successfully places the Deuteronomist within a broader historiographical context. In "Micah and the Problem of Continuities and Discontinuities in Prophecy" (pp. 127-46), W. Robert McFadden surveys Mesopotamian parallels for OT proph- ecy, including those in the Mari texts. Not surprisingly, his overview, which is too brief to make any significant new contribution, reveals both differences and similari- ties! The final section in which he argues for the authenticity of Mie 4:1-4 seems rather unrelated to the material that precedes. In "The Judean Exile after 701 B.C.E."(pp. 147-75), Stephen Stohlmann exam- ines the evidence in favor of a substantial deportation by Sennacherib in the wake of his 701 invasion of Judah. Particularly inviting of further study is his suggestion that a number of references to exile in the eighth century prophets, which are commonly understood as subsequent additions referring to the 587 exile, might actually be authentic and relate to the earlier deportation. Richard Nelson's piece, " Realpolitik in Judah (687-609 B.C.E.)" (pp. 177-89), argues cogently that Josiah's effort to stop Neko at Megiddo in 609 was due to pragmatic considerations rather than ideological anti-Assyrianism. The paper is stimulating and well argued, though it does not seem to have anything about it which could be attributed to a specifically "contextual approach." "The Biblical Book of Lamentations in the context of Near Eastern Lament Literature" (pp. 191-211), by W. C. Gwaltney Jr., contains a good survey of scholar- ship on the relevant Sumerian material and is an example of the comparative method at its best. The final paper is "Job and Ancient Near Eastern Wisdom Literature" (pp. 213- 30), by R. G. Albertson. Conrad E. L'Heureux, University of Dayton, Dayton, OH 45469</page></plain_text>
