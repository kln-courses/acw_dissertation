<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE USE OF DENTAL CHARACTERS IN THE ASSESSMENT OF GENETIC DISTANCE IN AUSTRALIA By Lindsay C. Richards* Peter J. Telfer* Introduction concept of genetic distance is used to describe and quantify the variation seen between populations. In the earliest studies anthropométrie characters were investigated (Pearson, 1926) but more recently the frequencies of various polymorphisms have been used to estimate genetic distances. Many characters have been described and used as markers in these studies. Blood groups, serum proteins, red blood cell enzymes and leucocyte antigens are among the biochemical characters whose frequencies in various populations have been compared. Penrose (1954), Hanihara (1977) and many others have used metric data derived from crania or teeth in comparing populations. Cavalli- Sforza (1974) and others have observed that in general, in human populations, estimates of distance between groups based on the frequencies of biochemical variants are often fundamentally different from those based on morphological traits. It has been suggested that morphological characters are more affected by the environment than biochemical variants. This results from their polygenic mode of inheritance and their more direct exposure to natural selection. Morphological characters with obvious functional value are arguably subject to greater selection pressures than biochemical variants. Some geneticists argue that a significant proportion of this biochemical variation is due to neutral mutations which respond more slowly to selective pressure (Lewontin, 1973). Genetic distance and the related consideration of the origin of the Australian Aboriginal have been the source of some controversy. Birdsell (1967) and others have maintained that the Aboriginal population can be divided into three geogra- phical, cultural and morphological groups. This has been termed the Trihybrid Theory. An alternative proposition suggests that the observed morphological differences are due to the effect of genetic drift or differential selection which occurs because of differences in the environment. Abbie (1970) discounted the possibility that a component of this variation is due to the pattern of migration and settlement because of the very long times involved. Considerations of genetic distance in Australia have been made difficult by the lack of suitable material. In recent times the tribal structure of the Aboriginal * Department of Restorative Dentistry, The University of Adelaide. Archaeology &amp; Phys. Anthrop.

Populations which have been subjected to biochemical analysis have all been from northern Australia (Kirk, 1966; Simmons and Graydon, 1971; Balakrishnan, Shanghvi and Kirk, 1975; Lie-Injo, 1976; Omoto, 1976). Morphological variants such as dermatoglyphic patterns have also been considered. Since isolated contemporary tribal groups are required, such studies have been restricted to a small group of northern Australian populations (Robson and Parsons, 1967; Parsons and White, 1973; White and Parsons, 1973). Only skeletal material is available for Aboriginal tribes from southern Australia. Both metric and non-metric variants have been described in this material (Fenner, 1939; Kellock and Parsons, 1970; Brown, 1973; Howells, 1976; Abbie, 1976). Unfortunately, very few collections of skeletal material contain well described population groups so that material must be grouped geographically rather than by tribal designation. Because the techniques used in this type of analysis can only be used on non-living material, comparison of data from southern and northern Australia is difficult. Sofaer, Niswander, MacLean and Workman (1972) considered the dis- tance scores obtained by comparison of non-metric dental variants in three American Indian tribes for which other methods of distance analysis had given reliable results and found that even though the low reproducibility of some of the characters was disturbing, the consistent improvement with the progressive removal of the characters showing the poorest reliability was encouraging. They concluded that "The change towards . . . the fundamental relationship shown by geography and by genetical estimates suggest that tooth morphology has the potential for providing moderately good discrimination even on (a) fine level". This evidence suggested that the pattern of genetic associations obtained from the incidence of non-metric dental characters might parallel those derived from established genetic markers. Because of this relationship and since teeth are among the few structures studied easily in both living and skeletal populations a preliminary investigation was undertaken to identify the problems involved in using non-metric dental variants to investigate genetic distances in Australia. Materials and Methods The frequency of seven non-metric dental characters (Table I) was estimated in five Australian Aboriginal populations and in three other world populations. These characters were observed on dental casts of Australian Aboriginal subjects from Yuendumu, Haast's Bluff and Kalumburu and for Mongoloid and Caucasoid groups. In the case of the other populations (Anson Bay, Lower Murray and New Hebrides) the dental characters were recorded from skeletal material (Figure I).</page><page sequence="3">186 THE USE OF DENTAL CHARACTERS Table I Replicability of Observations Corresponding observations Character Ν Ν Percent Shovelling I1 40 36 90.0 Shovelling Ρ 40 34 85.0 Carabelli's Cusp Mi 40 37 92.5 Carabelli's Pit Mi 40 39 97.5 Extra cusp PM2 40 37 92.5 More than 5 cusps Mt 40 36 90.0 More than 4 cusps M2 40 39 97.5 The presence or absence of each of the non-metric dental characters selected for study was recorded for each subject. Because of the difficulty in reliably scoring some of the characters described by Berry (1976a) and the importance of using accurate estimates of the incidence of variants, only characters for which scores could be reproduced in at least 85 per cent of a test population of 20 subjects were included. Figure I - Geographic distribution of populations.</page><page sequence="4">THE USE OF DENTAL CHARACTERS 187 Sneath and Sokal (1973) discussed the importance of excluding invariant characters in numerical taxonomic analysis. Since the concepts and considerations involved in studies of genetic distance are similar to those in numerical taxonomy, relatively invariant characters and those occurring at very low frequencies were excluded. Of the thirty-one characters described by Berry (1976b), seven satisfied both of the above requirements and were included in the study. The character definitions and scoring techniques of Berry (1976a) were used and all observations were made using binocular magnifying loupes with a magnification of two times. Further, all assessments were carried out by one observer within a period of only a few days. The first population examined was re-examined at the end of the study and the replicability estimates in Table I represent the differences between the original scores and those obtained on the second occasion. The incidence of each of the seven characters selected for the present study is shown in Table II. Genetic distances between populations were estimated using the method of C. A. B. Smith described by Berry and Berry (1967) where an inverse sine transformation is applied to the frequencies (p) so that θ = sin-1 (1 - 2p) The distance (d) between populations 1 and 2 based on any character is given by d = (θι - Θ2)2 - (l/Ni + 1/N2) where Ni is the sample size of the ith population. Since a number of variants η have been scored a mean measure of the distance (D) is obtained. η To estimate the magnitude of the errors involved in the distance score the replicability of observations was tested as described. Furthermore, two samples from one population (Yuendumu) were selected and the distance between them estimated. The distance of 5.0 χ 10~3 which was obtained was smaller than the distance between the test population and its nearest genetic or geographic neighbour and 1O~3 times the largest distance suggesting that random errors were of little significance. For comparative purposes, the data presented by Berry (1976b) for European populations were used to recalculate distances between those groups using the same seven characters used in the present study. This provided an opportunity to assess the effect of using a smaller number of reliable characters in the estimation of genetic distances.

Results and Discussion Several interesting patterns are evident in the distribution of characters. The incidence of shovel shaped maxillary central incisors (I1) was highest in the Mongoloid group (100 per cent) and declined with geographic distance from this group. This trend was observed both in the Australian and European popula- tions. Interestingly, Brace (1976) described an increase in tooth size which follows a similar pattern, but a parallel distribution of any morphological character has apparently not been previously described. The distribution of Carabelli's pit and the extra lingual cusp on PM2 also demonstrated some geogra- phical variability within Australia. Pits occurred with higher frequency in the central Australian populations (60 per cent to 72 per cent) than in coastal groups (41 per cent to 51 per cent). Similarly the additional cusp number of PM2 was more common in coastal tribes (88 per cent) than in central Australian groups (50 per cent to 60 per cent). If the presence of additional tooth material has a definite adaptive value (Wright, 1976) and since craniof acial morphology shows geographical variability within Australia (Brown, 1973) it may in time be possible to explain these regional differences in tooth morphology in terms of differences in craniofacial morphology and masticatory function between groups. The matrix of genetic distance is presented in Table III while Figure Π illustrates the associations between the populations based on these data. The Kalumburu and Lower Murray groups were separated by a small genetic distance and the Haast's Bluff and Yuendumu populations showed a similar trend. How- ever, the distance between these combined groups was very much greater than the distances within the groups suggesting the possibility of distinct "coastal" and "central" groups of populations. Except for the association between the Anson Bay and the Mongoloid groups, all Aboriginal populations more closely Table III Genetic Distances New Anson Haast's Lower Mongoloid Hebrides Kalumburu Bay Bluff Yuendumu Murray Caucasoid 1.1555 0.8369 0.6854 1.2530 0.9093 0.7404 0.8480 Mongoloid 2.5240 0.6833 0.2252 0.4165 0.4815 0.6117 New Hebrides 0.9455 2.0454 1.4061 1.2961 1.0127 Kalumburu 0.3018 0.1583 0.2830 -0.0852 Anson Bay 0.1237 0.2692 0.2102 Haast's Bluff 0.0087 0.1778 Yuendumu 0.3118</page><page sequence="7">190 THE USE OF DENTAL CHARACTERS resembled other Aboriginal groups than any other world population. The distances between closely related Aboriginal populations were of the same order as those between closely related European groups while the coastal and central Aboriginal groupings were separated by genetic distances of the same order as the distances between European populations. There is reason to believe that a high degree of racial admixture had occurred in the Anson Bay area and the association between this group and the Mongoloid group supports this suggestion. This may help to explain the otherwise anomalous distance between the Anson Bay group and other populations. Figure II - Cluster analysis of eight populations based on seven non-metric dental characters. The pattern suggested by both the distribution of characters and the analysis of distances conformed very closely to that described by Balakrishnan, Shaghvi and Kirk (1976). These authors used five biochemical markers in their analysis of 18 tribes and found that, with few exceptions, the populations segregated into a "coastal" and a "central" group in the same way suggested by the analysis based on non-metric dental variants. Omoto and Misawa (1976) estimated genetic distances between 18 world populations using 16 polymorphic biochemical loci. Although the Micronesians and the New Hebridians appeared to have little in common, the patterns suggested by non-metric dental characters and biochemical variants are very similar. The distances based on anthropométrie variants calculated by Howells (1976) bear very little resemblance to those based on biochemical data calcu- lated by Omoto and Misawa. Interestingly, the distances based on non-metric dental variants, unlike other morphological characters, correspond closely to those calculated from biochemical data.

Cavalli-Sforza (1974) suggested that anthropométrie characters ". . . are more affected by climate . . . and so the relations . . . are due more to similar environment than similar descent". This is of particular interest in the study of Australian Aboriginal populations where descent and environment have been the contentious issues. The different genetic patterns suggested by morphological variants and by polymorphic biochemical characters might be explained, at least in part, by this difference in selection.

ENGLAND ■ BONN ~T HEIDELBERG - J By using the seven non-metric dental characters the distances between Australian groups were of the same order as those described by Omoto and Misawa (1976), but the distances between racial groups were relatively greater. This same pattern was seen when the recalculated distances between European groups based on seven characters were compared with the distances calculated by Berry (1976b) based on 30 characters (Figure III). Examination of Figure III also shows that the re-calculated distances change the order of associations of some closely related European populations. This draws attention to the problem in choosing the characters to be considered. Intuition suggests that including more characters will improve reliability but it has been shown that this tends to distort distances because of the necessity of including relatively invariant characters. Estimates of the heritability of some characters are available but the precise details of the inheritance of these characters is still not entirely clear (Biggerstaff, 1973) . When the genetics of each of the variants is better understood</page><page sequence="9">192 THE USE OF DENTAL CHARACTERS it might be possible to provide appropriate weightings for each character and to so refine the technique. Attempts to determine the significance of the estimated distances are confused by the range of variance estimates available. For instance, the theoretical sampling variance has been given as Vi = -jjgX (l/ni + l/n2)2 (Berry, 1976) 4 or v2 =-^3 Χ (1/ηχ + 1/η2)2χ (Kellock and Parsons, 1973) and the empirical variance estimated by 1 (Sx)2 V3 = -wi~Xx '· - The method used by Berry and Berry (1967) gives a variance of the order of 2.0 χ 10"4 which suggests that all distances are significantly different from zero at the 5 per cent level. Alternative methods imply a range of variances with conflicting implications and there appears to be no clear indication as to which estimates are the most appropriate. For these reasons, the implications of the analysis of the variance of the distance are not discussed. Conclusions Studies of genetic distance between the Aboriginal populations of Australia have been complicated by the availability of material and by the difficulties inherent in comparing distances based on different types of markers. As a result, the genetic associations and the origin of the Australian Aboriginal populations remain unclear. Non-metric dental variants are among the few characters which can be studied in both contemporary and historical populations. By choosing only those characters showing greatest interpopulation variants and highest replicability, estimates of genetic distance which conform closely to those calculated by the analysis of established biochemical variants can be obtained. The distances between Australian populations calculated using non-metric dental characters corresponded closely with the distances based on biochemical markers described by Balakrishnan, Shanghvi and Kirk (1975). Furthermore, distances between the Aboriginals and other world populations conformed to the pattern described by Omoto and Misawa (1976) in their biochemical study. The use of non-metric dental variants apparently exaggerates the distance between the major population groups but the magnitude of the distances between</page><page sequence="10">THE USE OF DENTAL CHARACTERS 193 populations within these groups remains of the same order as those suggested by biochemical variants. The associations between populations within these groups however can change as the number of characters considered changes. The problem of deciding whether or not to include relatively invariant and unreliable characters to increase the number of loci considered is a dilemma that will only be resolved when the genetics of each of the characters is understood and the heritability of each character is known. Despite these problems, the close association with established estimators of genetic distance and the ease with which data can be collected suggest that the use of selected non-metric dental variants has a place in the analysis of genetic distance between human populations and may be of particular use in Australia where both contemporary and historical populations are to be considered.
