One example of their activity is this book about 'the traditional proofs for the existence of God in the light of present day logic and theory of science'. The lectures delivered at a symposium in Munich were the basis for the eleven contributions in this book. All contributors teach at German or Austrian universities. Since the proofs for the existence of God (the ontological one being the one exception) have their cradle in the philosophy of nature of Aristotle and the Stoics, one might be tempted to think that they are necessarily outdated. Is the existence of the Aristotelian God anything more than an astronomical hypothesis of old Greeks? In his introduction Ricken characterizes this view with the term 'superficial'. Not only do the proofs contain many interesting argumentative strategies, but it seems that only since the accomplishments of Frege and Russell can the quality of the medieval proofs be savoured. All contributions concentrate on one (or both) of two central texts : chapters II and III of Anselm's Proslogion and the second quaestio (Pars prima) of the Summa Theologiae. Edgar Morscher reconstructs the arguments of Proslogion II and III claiming that they are not valid. His criticism is not Kantian in nature, but sees a transfer from de-dicto to de-re utterances in the premisses. Weingartner uses intuitionistic logic for a reconstruction. From this point of view the argument(s) is valid, but the price for this validity seems to be a weaker conclusion. The result is not that IQM exists, but that IQM is free of contra- dictions. This author also reacts against the view that Anselm presents an aprioristic argument. Nieznanski discusses the formalisations of Hartshorne and Hintikka. Essler formalizes the Kantian criticism of the ontological argument.</page><page sequence="2">184 BOOK REVIEWS Siegwart reflects on the phrase 'quam omnes Deus nominanf at the end of each of the five ways. Isn't it a transgression of the maxim that the same expression should not be given multiple definitions? Kleinknecht identifies the core problem of the second way as the justification for putting an end to the infinite regress. A solution involving the axiom of choice, however, offers no satisfaction. Nieznanski formalizes the third way in modal logic S5 and develops in the line of Leibniz a neothomistic proof ex contingentia mundi. Lofflers shows that there are three arguments contained in the long neglected fourth way. He sees connections with Godel's proof for the existence of God (summum bonum). Essler has this proof by Godel as the main subject of his paper. Runggaldier discusses the fifth way, which is again a deductive argu- ment. Recent reformulations (Swinburne), however, turn it into an inductive, probability argument. In so doing, other possible explanations beside God are not ruled out. Runggaldier asks whether the transcendence of God is thus sufficiently warranted. Anthropomorphism seems to be the big threat here. Muck discusses the more general question whether theology as a scientific discipline stands or falls with the proofs for the existence of God. Wimmer pays attention to the fact that the Proslogion was presented in the form of a prayer. This brings him in the neighborhood of Wittgenstein's view of theology. Theology as grammar is a kind of transcendental reflexion. It tries to reveal the transcendental conditions for the possibility of a religious life. These revealed structures can not in their turn receive any further foundation, a fate religion seems to share, according to Wimmer, with science. On the whole this book offers from a logical point of view a multi-faceted and thoroughgoing approach to the traditional proofs.
