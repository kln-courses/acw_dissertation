<plain_text><page sequence="1">Funerary Lament and the Expression of Grief in the Transforming Landscape of Luxor Elizabeth Wickett Introduction In the late 1970s and 1980s, I undertook a private research project in Luxor in Upper Egypt with the aim of trying to record and translate laments sung by women at funerals. In my naiveté, I had not realized how daunting such a task would be. I did not know that the performance of such laments was one to which men, and certainly strangers, were not privy. However, after some time, I was able to convince women of my interest in the poetry of the laments, and, for the sake of my research (and often at the request of my Luxor colleague, Jamal Zaki al-Din al- Hajaji), women famed for their ability to lament agreed to cluster together (as they would normally do at the commemoration of the anniversary of a death) and intone laments into my tape recorder. On other occasions, when it was not considered appropriate for me as a foreigner to be present in a particular village, women would lament discreetly into a microphone as a solitary act of mourning, and, later on, the tapes would be passed on to me for transcription. These con- texts of performance were not entirely unnatural but could be described as a legitimate form of "simulated natural context." In this way, over two years, I collected many lament repertoires, but because of the sensitivity of my presence as an onlooker at funerals, only twice was I allowed to witness lamentation at an actual funeral and see the interactional dynamics between "the one who begins" ( il-badãya ) and "the one who responds" (HIT bitrudd calěha ).1 During this time, I was able to ascertain that the socially sanctioned modes for the expression of grief was the singing of funerary laments known as cidxd (a word derived from the verb °idd (meaning to "enumer- ate" or "repeat"). These were shaped as almost identical pairs of rhyming couplets (sometimes triplets) and performed by the ra' isa (leader) or badãya and reiterated by a chorus of mourners and the bereaved. Alifyi (2012) 111</page><page sequence="2">Traditionally, the cidïd laments are performed for the first three days of the funeral and subsequently on the fifteenth, thirtieth, and fortieth days, the latter being the day on which the soul is presumed to depart defini- tively from the land of the living until its return on the anniversary of death known as il-hal. This disciplined and highly regulated aspect of lament performance is a prime feature of the genre and a reason why women in the past were required to spend so much time at funerals. Young married women with children do not generally attend funerals; rather, mature women- and widows in particular- make duti- ful attendance at lamentation sessions. At a funeral, the badäya's role as animator is to evoke tears in the mourners, both the bereaved and those who have come in sympathy, while the bereaved widow daubs her face with mud, unplaits her hair, scoops dust from the ground, and flings it on her head in mourning, even ripping her garments apart in a frenzied display of grief. Squatting on the ground with a soaked handkerchief to swab the tears and her face half-shrouded in a black veil, the leader will chant and sway to the leaden rhythm. As she intones the first word of a lament, her partner- another woman, also well-versed in the art of lamentation and usually her principal respondent- will provide a con- trapuntal response to which the chorus of other mourners will join in. This creates the antiphonal voice of lament. The respondent may, on occasion, attempt to "steal the floor" at the cadence by interrupting the natural pause in the flow of the couplets to introduce a new lament or variation on the same theme. Still, it remains the duty of the badãya to orchestrate the flow of laments, propelling the rhythm forward as she rocks back and forth and to compose new laments provoking new images in the minds of the mourners such that they are compelled to break down and weep unconstrainedly. A highly valued attribute of a skilled badãya is her ability to "make a stone weep," as the famous folk- lorist Hasan El-Shamy indicated to me in a personal conversation. The Personae of Lament As I discovered, laments are divided into discrete categories, determined by the gender, age, and, sometimes the kind of death suf- fered by the person mourned. Accompanying each category is a set of core images. For example, laments for fathers conjure up images of male prowess or masculinity lost, while those for mothers are sugges- tive of nurturing and procreative functions. The young virgin who dies unmarried- or as she is known in the laments: "the bride"- is 112 Alif 32 (2012)</page><page sequence="3">mourned with images redolent of her nascent fertility and innocence. During performance, the badayď s skill is to reconfigure and reshuffle these images, and, at the same time, to add new apt verses to previ- ously known couplets so as to create an elegiac farewell to the person who has died. Historical Context When investigating the historical foundations of lament cos- mology and performance in Upper Egypt, I found that many of the laments echoed the lamentations of their predecessors, inscribed, apparently verbatim, on ancient tomb walls from the Old Kingdom (c. second millennium BC) and later (see Wickett, For the Living). The tropes of lament, their composition and performance style, as well as a substantive portion of lament themes invoke strong comparisons with the most ancient funerary liturgies extant, those incised on the pyramids of the kings of the Sixth Dynasty in Saqqara known as the Pyramid Texts. With these, I would include the ritual and non-person- alized nature of the laments and perceptions of the afterlife, namely, its conceptual frame: visions of the tomb as a marshy or watery place, the idea of the deceased assuming the form of a migratory bird, and the phenomenology of the soul, its capacity to depart and return. As one example of this conceptual linkage, some contemporary laments express the notion that the tomb is "a house" constructed on the "seas," as the lamenter cAliya from al-cAiyaïysa sings: How we built houses on the seas, how we built houses! yãmã banëna blyttt calalbuhttr yãmã banêna bîyût Let us ask after him from the captain who passes by ni s 'al calëh irrayyis illT yifüt How we built sanctuaries on the seas, how we built sanctuaries! yãmã banëna hTyam calalbuhür yãmã banëna hTyam Let us inquire from the captain who appears nis'al caleh irrayyis illT yibãn (qtd. in Wickett, "For Our Destinies," vol. II 433) Other examples exist of these conceptual parallels, suggesting that this tradition of lamentation may have survived for millennia in Upper Egypt because of belief in the continuation of the life-force after death, Alif 32 (2012) 113</page><page sequence="4">and the transmission of knowledge of the tradition through oral per- formance. Women have transmitted this knowledge of laments and funerary traditions from mother to daughter for generations. Fuelled by their fervent belief in the importance of the lamentation to the deceased, women have preserved this practice with tenacity. Though the lament tradition has been retained across Upper Egypt, Luxor has been particularly distinguished by the poetic quality and dimension of the laments performed there, possibly as a result of the cultural heritage of Luxor. The settlement of Luxor town occupied the original precinct of Luxor temple and is now a palimpsest of human habitation on the site. The establishment of a Roman camp on its ruins determined the town's rectangular contours and a monastic settlement grew up amidst the Roman edifices during the early centuries of Christianity. After Fatimid and Abbasid incursions, and later on, the construction of the shrine and mosque to Sidi Abu'l Hajjaj, the town of Luxor (al-'Uqsur literally means "the castles") survived as a predominantly Coptic enclave into the early part of the twentieth century. Even as late as 1948, the temple of Luxor was buried in the sand and unexcavated. At that time, pilgrims entered the shrine of Abu'l Hajjaj by passing through the two submerged statues of Ramses and the precinct was thronged with mud-brick houses of Copts and Muslims, pigeon tow- ers, four Coptic churches, and over forty shrines honoring Islamic holy men. After much local opposition, the Egyptian Antiquities Organization removed these houses, but was required to leave intact the high-domed shrine of the Muslim sheikh, Sidi Abu'l Hajjaj, situat- ed on the first pylon of Luxor temple. These factors are significant since the cultural traditions of the Coptic residents of Luxor and the Hajajiyya (descendants of the sheikh)- including its celebratory festi- val, the mulid or birth feast of Abu'l Hajjaj- evolved, and were influ- enced by, this ancient site. The mulid, in particular, imbibed important features of its precursor, the Opet Feast, which originated at least from the time of the reign of Queen Hatshepsut and may have been per- formed to commemorate the annual rising of the Nile at the start of the inundation. Amongst the array of diverse traditions which have been documented in ancient Egyptian texts and iconography and have influ- enced popular culture to date, it is the practice of lamentation by women at funerals that has emerged as one of the most elaborate and integral to the lives of women in Upper Egypt. The greatest change to Luxor has come in the last decades of the twentieth century when men from Luxor who had emigrated to work 114 Alif 32 (2012)</page><page sequence="5">in the Gulf and Saudi Arabia- seat of Wahhabi Islam- returned home. Luxor men informed me that having observed the practice of Islam in these new contexts- and, most notably, the absence of Egyptian traditions and cultural forms in funerary observance there- they had learned that these practices were not "Islamic" and, conse- quently, decided to proscribe the performance of lament by their wives at funerals. This crusade against what they had learned was "heretical" tradition was then taken up by local sheikhs (and later on by the liter- ate male community) to become an attack levied directly at women and their tradition. Lamentation was branded as "un-Islamic." As women's observance of mourning at funerals in Upper Egypt had always been separated from men's, some women persevered and con- tinued to lament in the firm belief that it was their moral duty to do so for the perpetuation of the family unit: "For our destinies and our fates," they argued, "for us, the living, as well as the dead." However, most were required to observe death as men in Upper Egypt do, in sti- fling silence. As Holst-Warhaft argues in her analysis of the suppres- sion of funerary lament in Greece, when women's voices of lamenta- tion are silenced, they are deprived of control over the rituals of death and left "without a language" to address the dead (7). Sorrow and anguish continue to be experienced but there is no route for the less histrionic expression of pain and grief and the achievement of a modicum of catharsis. Transformations of the Context of Lament Since 2003, and more dramatically since 2007, in the face of continuing destruction of traditional houses and large swathes of the built-up environment in Gurna and Luxor in the name of tourist sector development, the practice of lamentation in Luxor has been recontex- tualized and seemingly adapted by women to express their sorrow at the destruction of their homes and neighborhoods. In the last decade, two major waves of bulldozing of houses have taken place, the most dramatic in Gurna, and the most compre- hensive in Karnak and Luxor. The three-hundred-year old West bank settlement of Gurna, built in the desert above ancient tombs, was razed to the ground in the name of preserving the antiquities underneath. This area was occupied 2000 years ago by Christian zealots who burned the wall paintings in a burst of iconoclasm and determination to destroy the "pagan symbols" they retained, and several hundred Alifil (2012) 115</page><page sequence="6">years ago by waves of Bedouin nomads who occupied land near those monastic settlements established on the mortuary temples of Medinat Habu (and the nearby desert escarpment). They inhabited the tombs as troglodytes, and in many cases expanded their living quarters over ground into several-storey, mud-brick habitations. The tombs over which the people of Gurna built their towering mud-brick dwellings were, in most cases, devoid of paintings, as the 1970s film by Shadi cAbd al-Salam, al-Mummia (also known as The Mummy or The Night of Counting the Years ) revealed. It is generally known that the tombs of greatest artistic value had long ago been iden- tified and restored for tourism and, therefore, if their destruction had been to reveal new treasures, the tombs of Gurna were "salvaged" in vain. Instead, the land is now denuded of human habitation, and the tombs reclaimed are now locked to both tourists and former residents. More drastic still has been the destruction of the core of Luxor town and many mud-brick houses in Karnak. This was accomplished in the name of restoring the original route and sculptured heads of the three-kilometer-long Avenue of Sphinxes, an act which has resulted in the razing of the original commercial center of Luxor town (the houses of many residents and offices) as well as all tradi- tional houses of Karnak built near the ancient Avenue, which was until recently an area of waste ground. These two major events have prompted a public revival of the lament tradition but in a new context. In 2009, my colleague and tran- scriber-one of the foremost devotees of cidid, Jamal Zaki ai-Din al Hajaji- informed me that in Luxor, many of the old houses of some of the Hajajiyya and others dating from the mid-twentieth century in the center of modern Luxor had been destroyed. As they were being knocked to the ground, in an extraordinary defiance of tradition, women came out to lament vociferously. Funerary laments are nor- mally performed at funerals and on anniversaries of a death, but rarely otherwise. Lamentation without a deceased is considered taboo. Other unorthodox and spontaneous outbursts of lamentation not in the context of funerals, have been recorded in the course of Luxor his- tory, the most famous being the laments sung for the removal of the mummies of Pharaohs from the famous cache in Luxor. This was re- enacted in the film al-Mummia by Gurna women who were brought in to sing traditional laments as the procession of coffins moved towards the Nile. They did this, drawing on the repertory of the lamentations they were accustomed to singing at funerals for the deceased. On this 116 Alif 32 (2012)</page><page sequence="7">occasion, women were lamenting the transposition of the ancient bodies from their resting place on the West bank of Luxor to an unknown des- tination just as in the context of contemporary belief, laments would have been required to accompany the deceased on their dangerous jour- ney to the afterlife.2 The lamentations for houses destroyed in Luxor were not recorded, but- as no traditional laments tackle this eventuality other than those for the self and one's fate- it is highly possible that laments were sung invok- ing the collapse of "the house," as if for the demise of the father. As men- tioned earlier, this image- the collapse of the pillars, a prime metaphor for the death of the husband/father in contemporary laments, and a prominent motif in the expressive traditions of lament from the Old Kingdom- was also retained into the Late Graeco-Roman Period in Luxor. In a particular fragment of funerary lament dating from the Late Period (the Twenty- sixth Dynasty Saite period, c. 664 BC, until the end of Alexander the Great's reign, c. 323 BC) and transcribed from the hieroglyphics by Egyptologist Lüddeckens in 1943, the lamenter bewails her fate in the same vein, using the house destruction motif as her central theme: My heart cries, cries . . . Wail! Wail! Wail for me! Wail for me! Destroyed is my house in a single blink of the eye. (154)3 Compare this with the contemporary lament by Qomiyya, from Kom Lolah, Luxor, whose lament indicates that on the death of "the father," this pillar falls or is razed to the ground: He was the pillar of our house and the pillar has been razed dã camüd bëtna wil camüd haddtt Tell us . . . to whose house have they dragged it? wi tigülülna fibêt min šaddu? Razed, he was the pillar of our house and the pillar has been razed ithadd dä camüd bëtna wil camüd ithadd Why not tell us? In whose house has it been raised? wi tigülülna fibět min itšadd? Why not tell us? In whose house has it been raised? wi tigülülna fibět min itšadd? (qtd. in Wickett, "For Our Destinies," vol. II 537) Alif 32 (2012) 117</page><page sequence="8">Qomiyya was one of the first women in Luxor to explain to me the meanings of lament. She began her discussions of lament by singing: "the bindings round my head, you, the black cloak you who gave me strength against my family," after which she said: "That was for the father. They say this for him, for our father, when he dies" (qtd. in Wickett, For the Living, vol II 537). The collective "they" is important. Lamenters draw upon a stock of images and metaphors, coined by the most prolific members of the profession, to embody and mourn the deceased. Analysis of the repertoires I collected between 1980 and 1985 in Luxor reveals that in the case of the laments for the "father/husband" (titles which, in the context of lament, are synonymous), the image of the pillar collapsing is the most commonly repeated metaphor (Wickett, For the Living 270). Pharaonic Resonances In terms of comparison between ancient and modern, the con- cept of a pillar which collapses on the ground and is then raised to the vertical (as in Qomiyya' s lament) has ancient antecedents. In an Old Kingdom (Sixth Dynasty) letter to the dead more than four thousand years old, for example, the dead person is urged to revive: "Raise thyself up, thou hast devastated thy house" (Gardiner and Sethe 1). What is fascinating is that the devastation of the house evokes memories of rituals practiced for the ancient Egyptian god of resurrection and rebirth, Osiris. For centuries, a physical pillar was righted in rituals designed to assert Osiris's resurrection to life as part of the Osirian mysteries. This pillar was regarded the embodi- ment of stability in a process which was accompanied by lamenta- tion: "Mourning accompanied the ritual erection of the Djed pillar to assist Osiris in his struggle against death. It was hoped to please him and so to win his favour for deceased relatives and friends of the mourners; the lamentations would also bring about a good har- vest and a high Nile" (David 125). The "Djed" pillar, a fetish object daubed with facial markings and topped with feathered headdress to show its anthropomorphic character was believed to be the embod- iment of Osiris. It was also ritually raised from the horizontal to the vertical during the king's royal jubilee or Heb Sed festival in ancient Egypt, to celebrate the resurrection of the god from death to eternal life (Rundle-Clark 235). Qomiyya's lament, through its play on words, suggests echoes of both themes. 118 Alif 32(2012)</page><page sequence="9">Contemporary Lament Themes of Destruction The repertoires of contemporary funerary laments, collected and recorded during my field work in Luxor, reveal the fact that many lamenters compare death to earthquakes and natural cataclysms, including cosmic events and other spontaneous acts of nature which trigger destruction and misfortune.4 The elaborate range of contempo- rary laments on this theme is clear in the following: a. Death as an earthquake causing the walls of the house to collapse: [How I wish] foreign countries did not exist . . . bilãd bucd mã kãnit How the earth quaked when its walls collapsed yãmã zalzalu hitãnu mãlit Did not exist, I wish foreign countries did not exist mã bagïet yãrêt bilãd il-bucd mã bagïet How the earth quaked when its walls collapsed yãmã zalzalu hitãnu wagcit (Lamenter Tayha from Luxor, qtd. in Wickett, "For Our Destinies," vol. II 588) b. A cosmic event occurs and a landslide/miasma overwhelms the vic- tim, as in pathetic fallacy, resulting in destruction of the house: Her house has been destroyed in the fall bêtha harbãn finnazla A cloud came upon her, truly, the source of her misfortune jãtha gamãma wallã sahibt ilhajma Her house has been destroyed in the collapse bêtha harbãn finnazlãt A cloud came upon her, truly, the source of her misfortunes jãtha gamãma wallã sahibt ilhajmãt (Lamenter Qomiyya, qtd. in Wickett, "For Our Destinies," vol. II 544) In these two matching couplets, the first ending in singular noun, the second pluralized, we can see that death is precipitated by a cosmic or Alif 32 (2012) 119</page><page sequence="10">physical disaster. Destruction of the house is, however, the dominant motif. The following contemporary laments reveal the gamut of vari- ations on the house destruction motif. c. Death instigates destruction or dismemberment of the fabric of the house: How she wept, his eldest daughter, how she lamented and wept, wi bakit bittu ilkabTra cadadit wi bakit "Indeed! The pillars of our house have collapsed" "ahh yãmã cawãmíd bětna wagcit" Fallen over, his eldest daughter lamented and said, mãlit bittu ilkabira cadadit gãlit "Indeed! How the pillars of our house have teetered and fallen "ahh yãmã cawãmíd bětna mãlit" (Lamenter Zeinab from Luxor, qtd. in Wickett, "For Our Destinies," vol. II 635)4 d. Death destroys the house, clan, or extended family of the living: What's wrong with my small house? What's wrong? It has collapsed! mãl bëtî sugayyar? mãlu? harbãn! There is a sense of emptiness inside fi barãha jõwwa Truly, the devastation has endured walla ilharãba dãm (Lamenter Tariyya from Kom Lola, qtd. in Wickett, "For Our Destinies," vol. II 682) This destruction invokes a human response, and the lament soon turns to protest: In the midst of the houses, their house has been destroyed, in the midst of the houses wist ilblyüt běthum harbãn wist ilbïyût They will protest its destruction when the crowd passes by yišku ilharaba lamma iljamc yifiJt 120 Alif 32 (2012)</page><page sequence="11">In the midst of their place, their house has been destroyed, in the midst of their place wist ilbakãn yã bëthum harbãn wist ilbakãn They will protest to the crowd when it appears yišku iljarrf lamma yitbãn (Lamenters Balabil and Aliya from al-cAiyaïysa, qtd. in Wickett, "For Our Destinies," vol. II 467) And this one: O my misfortune! Say for them, truly, my misfortune! yã sümT mã gullT calëhum w'âna yã sümT They destroyed the houses and filled my existence mã harabu ilblyüt wi camaru ilkünl You, my promise, I say to them, you, my promise yã wcfdï w'âna ' agül calêhum yã wcfdï They destroyed the houses and left for the grave ma harabu ilblyüt wi rãhu illahdï (Lamenter Tariyya, qtd. in Wickett, "For Our Destinies," vol. II 582) In the following lament, the house in the sense of the clan has been destroyed and "the place of eternity" has been filled with young men who have died before their prime: You who are northward bound, wearing what you must wear yã mubahhira yã lãbsa illãzim Your house is destroyed; the house of youth is full to brimming bêtuk harãb bët issibãb cãmir You who are northward bound, wearing a pectoral yã mubahhira yã lãbsa ilkirdãn Your house is destroyed; the house of youth is overflowing bêtuk harãb bet issibãb camrãn You who are northward bound, wearing a gold necklace yã mubahhira yã lãbsa illibba Alif 32 (2012) 121</page><page sequence="12">Your house is destroyed; the house of the youth is beautiful bêtuk harãb bët issibãb c ajaba (Lamenter Umm Salih from Luxor, qtd. in Wickett, "For Our Destinies," vol. II 600) As in the Late Period lament cited earlier, at the death of her hus- band, the lamenter traditionally would sing "a lament for the self." In this case, the lamenter mourns the destruction of her house and imagines that she has transposed herself into the wood- en coffin at the grave: Do not withdraw the lion from by my side ma tall cuš issib c min jãrl My little house is destroyed and my fortunes have dimmed yitharib biwëtï wi yigill migdãrl Do not withdraw the lion from his place at my side ma tall cuš issibc min janbï My little house is destroyed and my coffin is nailed shut yitharib biwëtï wi yitsakkar hašabl (Lamenter Umm Salih, qtd. in Wickett, "For Our Destinies," vol. II 605) e. Death and dismemberment of objects within the house, also a form of pathetic fallacy: In this example, the women erect funerary tents for the lament rituals and the house, epitomized as the house "with the clay water jar" (or zir), the source of water, and "the oven," the source of bread, is rent apart on the woman's death: The house with the clay water jar, they erected tents for her, she who rent apart the house with the clay water jar bët izzTr nasabülha y 'ill! itšarak bët izzïr Truly, she was young-it caused us great suffering wallã sugayyãra-scabit calëna kitîr The house with the clay oven, they erected a funerary tent for her, she who rent apart the house with the clay oven bët ilfiirn nasabülha y'illï itšarak bët i If urn 122 Alif 32(2012)</page><page sequence="13">Truly, she was young- we felt great sympathies for her, all of us wallã sugayyãra - scabit c alena, Ukuli (Lamenter Nafisa from al-Hajis al-Bahri, Edfu, qtd. in Wickett, "For Our Destinies," vol. II 534-35) f. Personification of the guest room within the house: Even the guest room wailed and groaned at the death of the father: The guest room groaned at your ascent, the guest room groaned w'il mandara juddit min tifak wilmandara juddit And of those left behind, not one could repress it w'illT warãk, ilkull ma šaddit The guest room wailed at your ascent, the guest room wailed w'ilmandara nãnit min tifak w'ilmandara nãnit And for those who are left behind, there is emptiness w'illT warãk ilkull ma hãlit (Lamenter Balabil, qtd. in Wickett, "For Our Destinies," vol. II 468) g. The house, as a living entity, should clasp onto the wings/veils of its mistress as she departs: You, her house, clasp onto her flowing veils yã bëtha w'imsik hulãlTha Swear by your mistress and let her remain yã mahlafcalu sittik wi halTha Her flowing veil, you, her house, clasp on to her flowing wings mijanãhha yã bëtha w'imsik mijanãhha Swear by your mistress and bring her back yã mahlafcalu sittak wi rajjacha On the quay, they furnished her with a bed of their flowing veils calilmuwarida farašha hulalThum Why not cry out to the skipper to let them off? mã nada calrayyis yidallThum Alif 32 (2012) 123</page><page sequence="14">Their flowing head veils on the quay, they unfurled their flowing head veils magarfhum calilmuwarida f aratu magarf hum Why not cry out to the skipper to let them off? mã nada calrayyis yinazzilhum (Lamenter Šargawiyya from Karnak, qtd. in Wickett, "For Our Destinies," vol. II 557) In these laments, a woman's futa or ginac, the long, all- enveloping veils which billow out like sails, implicitly become "wings." "The house" is urged to clasp onto them to prevent her from leaving. Through the slight shift in consonants, a technique for creat- ing a tension of juxtaposed meanings known in Arabic as jinas or paronomasia, their veils {magarf ãha) become like flowing wings ( mijanãha in Safidi dialect). Conclusion The gamut of traditional laments mourning the death of friends and family is vast and highly elaborate, but the tradition is under threat. The contexts of lament have changed, and- as traditional mud-brick houses in Gurna and Karnak and old palatial houses in the original town of Luxor have been gradually destroyed- those affected say that a general feeling of despondency and helplessness has ensued. The transformation of context of lament performance from the funerary to the world of the living signals a mood of desperation and complaint. To serve the context of destruction of the houses, the metaphoric language of lament has been transformed from the symbolic to the literal. In a sense, this is a violation of the semiotic code of lament in which sym- bols are intended to be invoked metaphorically. To the women lamenters, "the house"- in symbolic terms- invokes the sense of clan or extended family, and the continuity of life across generations. It is emblematic of heritage: the living fam- ily and its roots on the land of its ancestors. When their houses were destroyed, women were not only mourning the demise of physical structures, but also the rupturing of the ancestral line, "the destruc- tion of the house of their grandfathers," as an informant/lamenter put it. In an abstract sense, they were also mourning the destruction of the environs, and in spiritual terms, the ingrained norms, values, and behaviors, what could be called the Upper Egyptian habitus, 124 Alif 32 (2012)</page><page sequence="15">those qualities of life which people who have lived for millennia in the agricultural surround of the Nile Valley have now lost. Ironically, this re-contextualization of laments to mourn the destruction of houses of the living is evidence of a revalidation of lament. By invoking deeply ingrained and historically significant cul- tural symbols, women have shown their continuing belief in the sym- bolic language of lament and its capacity to evoke intrinsic power. Funerary laments have always been performed, as the lamenters Balabil and cAliya sang: "For our destinies and our fates." The out- pouring of sentiment is consistent with the reaction to circumstances and the traditional proclivity to lament fate. Postscript A film I made in 2008 ( Pilgrimage to Eternity ), using footage from the 1980s to illustrate the famous tradition of pilgrimage paint- ing on the facades of houses in Gurna and Baycarat, strangely pre- figured these developments. To illustrate my own sorrow at seeing houses destroyed and their spectacular pilgrimage facades dismem- bered-figurative paintings which acted as significant markers of prestige and cultural identity to those living in the West bank of Luxor- I added the soundtrack of funerary laments to the images. I paired the literal collapse of "the pillars of the house" to the laments for the father: "the pillar which has been razed," to try to evoke the sense of sorrow and despair felt by the inhabitants, unaware at the time that some women in Gurna were engaged in the same act of mourning or that those who had lost their traditional houses in Luxor might eventually do the same. When lamentation was denounced by men returning from abroad, women became deprived of the vehicle of expression of sorrow. The prac- tice of lamentations for the destruction of "house and hearth" in Luxor reveals definitively that some women still consider funerary lament the appropriate mode for the expression of grief and calamity in Luxor, despite the voices of those clamoring for its abolition. Whether women will suc- ceed in retaining the tradition over the next centuries remains to be seen.

Alif 32(2012) 125</page><page sequence="16">2 I witnessed a similar procession of lamenters and weepers down the main street of Luxor from the train station, accompanying the coffin of the deceased being transported from Cairo in 1981. 3 Lüddeckens gathered together a corpus of lament fragments, inscribed over a time span of over 2,500 years in Old Kingdom tombs at Saqqpra and Giza (c. 2589-2269 BC) at El Kab near Edfti during the Middle (c. 2040-1640 BC) and New Kingdom (c. 1570-1070 BC) and in the Late Period tombs at Thebes on the West Bank of Luxor, now Guma (in this case, c. 751 BC-27 AD), and translated them from hieroglyphics into German. Elliptical and often exhortative like actual laments, these fragments were presented as tran- scripts or stylistic recreations of actual lamentation performed by the bereaved. Lüddeckens identified this particular text as "a lament from Thebes" and listed it as # 84.
