Reviewed by Mary Nooter Roberts Inventing Masks is an outstanding volume- required reading for African-art specialists and strongly recommended for other scholars interested in the dynamics of expression. Zoe Strother's research is exemplary, teaching that a sensitive student can expect repeated awak- enings from arbitrary assumptions. The book presents the initiation of a deeply engaged re- searcher into an understanding of what Cen- tral Pende masking is, who invents it, what makes it work, and how it changes over time. Strother asserts that so-called traditional African art is anything but static. The dynamics of localized masking and other artistic forms have been addressed by many scholars, such as Lamp in Art of the Baga (1996), Amoldi in Playing with Time (1995), and Vogel and Ebong in Africa Explores (1991). Still, the notion that change is the norm in African societies is not widely recognized, and stereotypes persist of an African past frozen in time. Inventing Masks is a lively, compassionate, and irrefutable demonstration that the only stasis associated with African expression resides in some out- siders' portrayals of it. Inventing Masks follows in a genealogy of social science and humanities treatises on cul- tural change, such as Wagner's The Invention of Culture (1981) and Hobsbawm and Ranger's The Invention of Tradition (1983). In The Invention of Africa (1988), Mudimbe considers the con- struction of Africa by outsiders, and Errington's recent The Death of Authentic Primitive Art, and Other Tales of Progress (1998) continues to turn the dynamics of such invention in upon itself. Rather than simply underscoring the "inven- tion of tradition," Strother describes the Pende case as "a tradition of invention." The book, designed in an unusual horizon- tal format, is divided into two richly illustrated parts: one on processes of mask invention among contemporary Central Pende of Zaire (now the Democratic Republic of the Congo), the other a precolonial and colonial art history of Pende masking. The book's theoretical mes- sages are far reaching and broadly relevant, but just as important, Strother pays tribute to Pende art, long recognized as one of central Africa's most important styles. Until her research, L'art pende (1959) by Leon de Sousberghe was the principal source on this immensely rich cultur- al and artistic milieu. While Strother refers to de Sousberghe's observations, she refines, deepens, and some- times corrects them. For example, while Pende ~~f I I -~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ I Anthropomorphic Harp Zande, Zaire Height: 291/2' masks have been divided into two categories, wooden and fiber, Strother clarifies that Pende define their masks not by material but by func- tion and context. A first Pende category con- sists primarily of fiber masks (although some are wooden) belonging to and used in fraterni- ty rites; a second category, which is more the focus of Strother's study, is mostly wooden masks (although some are fiber) reserved for the fraternity but used for the benefit of the community as a whole (p. 17). A second clarification concerns the classifi- cation of masks according to type, which Strother finds inadequate for understanding the historical and creative vitality of Pende masquerades. Instead, she asserts that genre allows for observation of change in ways that typology tends to freeze through synchronic analysis. Drawing upon Jauss, Jameson, and Todorov, she applies literary theory to masking to extend her interpretive horizons and allow readers to perceive "the individual in the act of reinventing the cultural code" (p. xvi). Personal agency and creativity become explicit. During her research in Zaire, Strother learned that rather than asking, "Is this an old or a new mask?," it is more pertinent to won- der, "Whose ideas are these?" In other words, who is responsible for the dazzling array of Pende mask forms, and how, when, and why were they invented? Strother emphasizes that Pende people crave fame, and, especially, young unmarried men use masking as a vehi- cle for attracting attention to themselves. winter 1999 * atrican arts "Dancers are the rock stars of the Central and Kwilu Pende" (p. 27), and masquerade "dif- fuses male rivalry into the realm of popular culture" (p. 15). Yet, he who craves fame and whose name becomes identified with the mask is not the mask sculptor, as Western observers might expect, but the performer who invents the dance through which it is performed. Once an innovative dance and a song to accompany it have been arranged, details of costume and props are decided, and, finally, the headpiece is commissioned to embody the character and circumstances the dance is to convey. That the mask is the last stop in the pro- cess inverts Western art historical paradigms of the object as centerpiece of the aesthetic event. Museum display of Pende masks with- out attendant elements becomes unthinkable after reading this book. And yet, even if a museum owned the original costume, the "mask" would still be devoid of its dance and song that not only enliven it but provide its identity. A Pende mask is not identifiable on the basis of form or by name alone, then. It can only be identified by its dance, in a com- bination of form and context. Furthermore, genres change, and a mask's popularity will dictate its "reinvention." How Pende "see the dance in the face" is the subject of the next three chapters, in which Strother explains the ways Pende theories of physiognomy govern the formal treatment of a mask's headpiece. Certain characteristics of gender and personality are expressed through 11 M. m</page><page sequence="2">Watergeus straat 11 5b 3025 HN Rotterdam Holland z Tel. (0)10-4256427 Fax.

Pende posit a paradigmatic system of inner character which establishes a sliding scale of gender and is conditioned by metaphors of tempera- ture, ranging from the cool and composed female to the feminized male, the average male, and the hot and violent hyper-male. Unfortunately, discussion of physiognomy strikes uncomfortably close to nineteenth-cen- tury Western phrenology, which purported to link class, race, and intellect through facial and cranial structures. Strother deflects such comparison by stressing that Pende distin- guish only gender and age through physiog- nomy, and that these are linked to a broader ontology of societal stability versus disharmo- ny. "Physiognomy reveals that for many Pende, ontology is itself gendered" (p. 118). Yet, physiognomy is not interpreted by every artist according to the same principles; rather, each mask within a genre is actualized according to highly variable individual ex- pression. Pende artists make conscious choic- es about the ways that inner character and intention can be reified through masquerade. Contorted black-and-white Mbangu masks demonstrate how the same misfortunes are personified in different ways by different artists. One sculptor presents Mbangu as a sorcerer, another as a clown; and a third uses the mask to express the conflicted state of someone who has suffered physical hard- 12 ships. Mbangu demonstrates that Pende masks are never "types" but rather "complex composites of multiple conditions and per- sonalities" (p. xvii). Strother proposes that gendered physiog- nomic codes may constitute a widespread phe- nomenon in African art. From Songye to Dan, masks' genders are differentiated by facial anatomy and are thus "read" according to vocabularies similar to that of Pende. Yet, as Strother admits, it is quite impossible "to jump systems...without risking misinterpretation," for "these are profoundly relational systems" (p. 167). The important point is that a mask is an "open text" responding to individual ex- pression and to critical interpretation, whose reading depends upon knowledge of other masquerades both within and across genres. The second part of Inventing Masks is a his- toriography of invention during precolonial and colonial periods. The history of Central Pende masking is quite different from that of Eastern Pende. While the latter still dance masks for rituals such as funerals, Central Pende have secularized their dances, and per- form them only in times of peace and social harmony. Strother cites specific political events, such as the 1931 rebellion, as causes of this sec- ularization, explaining that Central and espe- cially Kwilu Pende who suffered the most during that upheaval lost faith in their spiritual denizens. As a result, these masks no longer ful- fill their original purpose to honor and petition the ancestors, although they are nevertheless considered to reinforce a sense of community and to "rejoice the village" (p. 20). In spite of these differences, there are mask genres that bridge the two Pende regions. By following clusters of invention, Strother traces the histories of transformation in seven mask genres whose invention predates the separa- tion of Eastern and Central Pende in the eigh- teenth century. Pende gauge the relative age of a genre by how many changes have been intro- duced into the song, dance, and headpiece of a mask ensemble. As in linguistic phenomena, older structures seem to show more diversity. Sometimes the Eastern and Central headpieces for a single genre may look completely differ- ent, although the core of their dance is identi- cal, as in the case of Pumbu, whose dance is a furious storm of action intended to convey an aesthetic of fear. To explain such transforma- tions of form and meaning across space and time, Strother looks to structuralist theorists such as Todorov, who holds that "a new genre is always a transformation of an earlier one, or of several: by inversion, by displacement, by combination" (p. 224). People mix and match genres, and sometimes the easiest way to trans- form a genre is by changing the sex of the char- acter. Genres that are most popular are the ones most likely to permit such variations. Strother frequently draws analogies to per- formances and literary genres in the United States and elsewhere in the West (e. g., TV shows like "Happy Days" or "The Waltons") to suggest how Pende genres reflect the "inter- alrican arts * winter 1999</page><page sequence="3">ests, hopes, and outlook of a period" and how audiences contribute to the development of genres (as did a series like "Star Trek"). Rarely, however, do these comparisons have the weight of the history of oppressive colonial experience that precedes her Pende cases, as revealed in her powerful demonstrations in the last chapter on colonial mask inventions: mas- querade-even at its most secular and light hearted-is always in dialogue with the social and historical circumstances of the times. Central Pende peoples used a genre of out- rageous masks called mafuzo as a form of resistance and transcendence of otherwise intolerable colonial conditions, when Pende often equated colonialism with sorcery. It is here that Strother introduces "Article 15" into the dynamics of Pende mask invention and reinvention. Article 15 is an ironic ethos of survival and endurance that often emerges as an aesthetic of subversion. While this final chapter of the book demonstrates the rise and fall of a genre as a response to political pressures, it made this reader yearn to know how different historical factors have affected the history of invention among neighboring Eastern Pende. Is the longing for individual fame as prevalent in the east as in the center? Is the comparison of Central Pende mask inventors to "rock stars" applicable in the east, where masks are worn on solemn ritual occasions of ancestral devo- tion and where all masks are owned by the chief? In other words, to what degree is the eagerness to invent and the overt search for public acclaim driven by the secularization of the art form? Has Pende masking always been popular art, or did it become popular art when it stopped being ritualized? What is popular art, anyway? Strother addresses the question of popular art in the conclusion. Drawing upon the writ- ings of Bogumil Jewsiewicki and Johannes Fabian, she asserts that popular art, previously attributed primarily to urban contexts, was no less prevalent in rural Zaire during her research. In both urban and rural settings, one finds sim- ilar relationships between art form and audi- ence, which play active, participatory roles in the definition, transformation, stabilization, and ultimate reinvention of art. Popular art thus belongs to the public domain, whether urban or winter 1999 ? african arts rural. As Strother states, "there is no hermetic division between city and country, between 'modernity' and 'authenticity' " (p. 19), a point of utmost importance as scholars grapple with the arbitrary categories of an invented Africa. She cites cases of artists who navigate, without anxiety, between village masking contexts and foreign markets, paying for their children's edu- cation with money acquired from middlemen who purchase village masks for sale to expatri- ates in Kinshasa. Like all art forms, masks are in conversation with the world around them, which they manage-when successful-to both mirror and transform. Zoe Strother's dynamic and insightful book will have an impact on African art his- tory for years to come and will require that all subsequent fieldworkers rethink their assumptions. In the intersection of cultures, paradigms are transformed or cast off alto- gether so that new models may come into existence. "Whose ideas?" should be a ques- tion that every art historian asks. With half the persistence and perception that Strother demonstrates in Inventing Masks, African art studies are certain to advance and deepen understanding.

Hall, New York, and Prentice Hall Inter- national, London, 1996. xxviii + 378 pp. $95 hard- cover. Reviewed by Joseph J. Lauer A three-year project led by visual resources librarian Linda McRae and researcher Susan Kelliher, under the supervision of Daniel Biebuyck, the University of South Florida's first Stuart Golding Chair in African Art, pro- duced this attractive indexed list of African ethnic names. The compilers were assisted by other visual resources librarians, who sent unpublished authority lists and classification schedules, and they made special use of the expertise of Janet Stanley (National Museum of African Art). African Ethnonyms (AE) contains over 4,500 names for over 2,000 peoples, plus some toponyms. Each of the entries includes the name of the country or countries, a list of vari- ant names, the preferred names (if any) in the Library of Congress Subject Headings (LCSH) and the Art &amp; Architecture Thesaurus (AAT), and a list of coded references to monographs with more information. Many entries also provide an indication of the primary source, explanatory notes to clarify complex relation- ships, lists of narrower categories, and see also references to broader categories. A two-part introduction precedes the alphabetical listings. The first part, apparently by Biebuyck, is a sophisticated review of the problems of multiple names and identities. Many of the examples are drawn from Congo- Kinshasa, where the distinguished anthropol- ogist and art historian began working in the 1950s. It closes with a challenge: [M]uch work still needs to be done about ethnic nomenclature, particularly in reference to the origin and meaning of terms and the systematization of correct, readable, and acceptable spellings....it is possible to find adequate solutions for the problems, provided a massive effort is made involving cooperation between various disciplines concerned. To achieve a real solution it is necessary not merely to produce new names and new transcriptions of ethnonyms; but to examine critically the heuristic value of numerous terms, and to clarify the scope of the cultural and artistic realities they cover. The second part of the introduction is a guide to use, with some indication of the scope. At the end of the book are notes on varying prefixes with ethnolinguistics terms and on language classification. There is also a toponyms index of over 300 places, a country index of ethnonyms, a list of bibliographic abbreviations, and a bibliography of about 1,050 monographs (but no articles) published from the 1950s to 1996. 13 l?aai^sa^^^^ ^^^^^B ^^5S5^&amp; TS^iyf^roro0 m - ?11+[ 1~ [?1~ I *LLI ff.aL.r;; iI io. zLtirtf?

BERZOCK: Notes, from page 35 [This article was accepted for publication in September 1999.] Many people have helped with the research and writing of this article. At the Art Institute of Chicago I owe much to Richard F Townsend, Curator of the Department of African and Amerindian Art, for giving generously of his time and counsel, Bart Ryckbosch and the staff of the Museum Archive for their expertise and assistance in finding museum records, and Hsiu-ling Huang and the Imaging Department for expe- diting the orders for photography. Thanks are also due James N. Wood, Director and President of the Art Institute of Chicago, Christa C. Thurman in the Department of Textiles, and Andrea D. Barwell, MacArthur Fellow in the Depart- ment of Twentieth Century Painting and Sculpture. I am indebted to Evan Maurer and Raymond Wielgus, who thoughtfully discussed with me their involvement with the department. Thanks also to Amy M. Mooney for commenting on an early draft of the article and to Kate Ezra for support and advice. Most especially, I offer my gratitude to Cary Berzock for his love and moral support. 1. The other objects illustrated in Wardwell's article have been deaccessioned from the collection. 2. Only a handful of African objects were acquired before 1924, none of which remain in the collection today. Before 1925 the Children's Museum was sometimes called the Children's Room. 3. Mr. and Mrs. Worcester were made Benefactors of the museum for their generosity, and in 1925 Mr. Worcester be- came a Trustee. 4. In 1924, the Art Institute was organized into four curatori- al departments: Painting and Sculpture, Prints and Drawings, Decorative Arts, and Oriental Art. In 1928 the Department of Classical and Egyptian Art was formed. 5. Beryl J. Wright suggests that Chicago's Negro in Art Week was one of several independent exhibitions inspired by the national appeal of the Harmon Foundation-sponsored exhi- bitions of art by African Americans (1989:55). 6. The core of the Harlem Museum of African Art's collection consisted of works from the Blondiau Collection of African Art, which had been acquired by Theatre Arts Monthly and later purchased "by public subscription" for the museum (Chicago Woman's Club 1927: n.p.). 7. Though the Art Institute owned works by Picasso in the 1920s, those reflecting his interest in African art did not enter the collection until later. 8. Several important private collections of African art were started in the 1920s, including that of Albert C. Bares, who was also a noted patron and supporter of African Ameri- can artists. 9. For a deeper analysis of the Negro in Art Week and its rela- tionship to the New Negro movement, see Meyerowitz 1996. 10. In his analysis of a similar Dawson image, Richard Powell suggests that Dawson's blending of allusions to contemporary Western culture and timeless Africa "urbanized and deprimi- tivized 'Africa' for the 'progressive' black consumer" (1997:63). 11. Confusion at this time about how to treat African acquisi- tions at the Art Institute is evident in the different approach- es taken. For instance, while the purchase of the combs (Fig. 5) in 1924 was not subject to committee approval, Harding's gift was sent for approval to the advisory committee of the Department of Oriental Art. 12. Of the original six African objects given by Harding, only two remain in the museum's collection. The other is a Kuba drinking horn (1928.173). 13. For instance, the African objects given by Harding were displayed with a group of six carved horn spoons from Timor (MacKenzie 1930:9). Other objects acquired by the Children's Museum in 1928 included a Hopi doll, a Japanese doll, and a wood block print and impression by Auguste Lepere (Art Institute of Chicago 1928:26). 14. Confusion continued about how to handle African acqui- sitions. Unlike the Harding gift, the Benin plaque was sent for approval to the advisory committee of the Department of Painting and Sculpture. 15. In her lengthy and penetrating discussion of the contra- winter 1999 ? alrican arts dictory attitudes of the English toward Benin art and culture in the late nineteenth century, Annie Coombes suggests, "The terms 'decay,' 'deterioration' and 'degradation' were mobi- lised in the Benin context partly because they were a conve- nient means of undermining the all too substantial evidence (both through historical accounts and the tangible evidence of the bronzes and other items) of an ancient and thriving soci- ety in Africa, which displayed all those signs associated with European definitions of civilisation" (1994:11). 16. The Art Institute records consulted do not indicate the rea- son for the transfer. 17. For more on the Wielgus Collection and the collecting phi- losophy of Raymond Wielgus, see Pelrine 1996. 18. At their first meeting, members of the Committee of Primitive Art discussed the possible relationship between the Art Institute and the Field Museum. They decided that "there will be no conflict in the field of Primitive Art since scientific museums are interested in collecting ethnographic material, whereas the Art Institute will stress only the esthetic side and exhibit primitive objects for their artistic value" (Art Institute of Chicago 1957:1). 19. This mandate did not preclude the acceptance of gifts of Oceanic material. 20. Capitalizing on his training, Wardwell simultaneously held curatorships in the Department of Primitive Art and the Department of Decorative Arts at the Art Institute. 21. Wielgus discussed his weekly meetings with Wardwell in a telephone conversation with me in August 1999. 22. Of the six, only the boli figure and ntoma mask remain in the collection. A third piece, a figure of a water buffalo, is no longer believed to be Bamana (see Wardwell 1962: fig. 1). 23. These were "Yakutat South: Indian Art of the Northwest Coast" in 1964, "The Sculpture of Polynesia" in 1967, "Gold of Ancient America" in 1969, and "Art of the Sepik River" in 1971. 24. After his departure from the Art Institute, Wardwell became director of the Asia Society Gallery in New York. Until his death in March 1999, he remained active in the fields of African, Oceanic, and, Amerindian art, working as a con- sultant and publishing on such topics as Eskimo and North- west Coast Indian art. 25. Personal communication with Evan Maurer, Sept. 1999. 26. In the 1960s and '70s, the Museum of Primitive Art orga- nized many nationally touring exhibitions. In 1968 Roy Sieber and Arold Rubin's ground-breaking exhibition "Sculpture of Black Africa: The Paul Tishman Collection" was presented at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, and in 1972 Sieber's "African Textiles and Decorative Arts" began its national tour.

My utmost gratitude also goes to Florence Alexis for providing simultaneous translation dur- ing the interview. Finally, many thanks to Ann Brener for valu- able editorial comments on an earlier version of this paper. 1. The life story and work of Korczak Ziolkowski provides a striking comparison. For nearly thirty-six years Korczak ded- icated his career to his Crazy Horse project, on which he worked until his death on October 20, 1982, at age 74. He is buried in the tomb he and his sons blasted from a rock out- cropping near the projected site of the Crazy Horse Memorial. 2. Quoted from Mrs. Bigue N'deye, a friend of the artist, who sang at the opening of his latest exhibition on January 23,1999. 3. He recalls saying to himself at the time, "Even if I am a dunce, I can't be a total idiot if my sculpture's up there!" See Pivin et al. 1995:164. 4. Interview with Ousmane Sow at his house, "Le Sphinx," Dakar, January 26,1999. Unless otherwise attributed, all quotes from the artist derive from this interview. 5. In Sow's own words, "I was younger at the time, and respect for age difference in the African tradition made it difficult to mingle with them. But, like other African immi- grants, I attended their lectures and followed their in- tellectual contributions." Sow also notes that it was an extraordinary period for him, as he forged lifetime friend- ships with people he met at that time. He felt welcomed, though he confesses to the fact that he was and still is a loner. 6. See Riefenstahl 1973 and 1976. Both books stirred up a seri- ous debate about her photography, art, and the links to fascist aesthetics. For a criticism of Riefenstahl's photographic works among the Nuba, see Faris 1980:38; and World Apart: The Nuba, a BBC film production for which James Faris served as con- sulting anthropologist. 7. This series was first unveiled on December 21, 1998, on a beach in Dakar that will be the site of the Memorial of Goree Island. On March 20, 1999, Battle of the Little Bighorn was presented on the Pont des Arts (the Bridge of Arts) in Paris as part of a major Ousmane Sow retrospective. It re- ceived rave reviews.
