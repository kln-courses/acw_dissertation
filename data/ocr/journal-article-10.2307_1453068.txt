LEON DA MODENA'S RELATIONSHIP TO THE Kol Sakhal THE case for Leon's authorship of the Kol Sakhal rests on the unsound methodological principle that author- ship may be determined on the basis of stylistic and ideological similarities, even when these are superficial. A methodology based on such assumptions is entirely in- adequate for solving the problem of the authorship of the Kol Sakhal. Similarities in style or in ideas are overriding only when they are so individualistic that no other person could conceivably have possessed them. To establish such an identity is difficult, even when the similarities are much more pronounced than are those which allegedly exist between the Kol Sakhal and Leon's works. In any period, similar views are held by many persons, even though their number, as in the case of heretics, may be comparatively small. Likewise, the most individualistic literary style will contain expressions, phrases, idioms, and technical terms which may be found in the writings of contemporaries. When, therefore, one seeks to establish authorship on the basis of similarities alone, he can arbitrarily choose as author whomever he wishes. In their eagerness to discover as many similarities as 307</page><page sequence="2">308 THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW possible, Reggio, Geiger, Libowitz,285a and others have over- looked completely the profound differences that exist be- tween the style and the ideas of the author of the Kol Sakhal and those of Leon da Modena. These differences are so marked that they exclude the possibility of Leon's author- ship of the Kol Sakhal. Consider, for a moment, the problem of style. Did Leon have so unique a style as to make possible the certain 28Sa Libowitz in his biography of Leon da Modena (Rabbi Yehudah Aryeh Modena, [New York, 1901]) has compiled a long list of such similarities (pp. 28-47). A careful analysis of them, however, shows that they are extremely superficial. Thus he points out (pp. 32-33) that both Leon and the author of the Kol Sakhal were opposed to the absolution of vows by the rabbis. Such agreement, even if it were proved, is meaningless, since the rabbis themselves recognized that the right of absolution was not derived directly from the Pentateuch. Leon specifically notes this (Magen we-Sinnah, p. 10a) when dealing with the problem in connection with da Costa's thesis. Obviously a heretic will make a frontal attack against the weakest positions of his opponents; hence both Uriel da Costa and the author of the Kol Sakhal called attention to the rabbinical law with reference to absolution as proof that the rabbis were usurpers. Leon, on the other hand, was anxious that the privilege be not abused, but he stoutly defended the need for such authority (ibid., Beth Yehudah, II, 19b, col. 1; 6b-7a; 45a; Riti, Part II, Chap. IV, ? 3). Leon wanted rabbis to he cautious lest heretics use this argument effectively against them. Nor is it true that Leon agreed with the author of the Kol Sakhal on the subject of proselytes, as maintained by Libowitz (pp. 31-32). Leon insisted that a proselyte undergo circumcision (Beth Yehudah. I, p. 17a, col. 2), in contrast to the opposition voiced by the author of Kol Sakhal (p. 59); in general, Leon is much less favorably disposed to proselvtes; cf. Beth Yehudah, II, p. lb. Equally unconvincing is the argument (pp. 13-14) that since Leon believed in the influence of stars on man's fortunes, he must have been the author of the Kol Sakhal, who likewise held such belief. Aside from the fact that the Talmud and numerous rabbis held the same beliefs too, a careful comparison between the specific beliefs of the author of the Kol Sakhal (pp. 16-17) and those of Leon in the Ben David, (in Taam Zekenim, ed. E. Ashkenazi, F. A. Main, 1854, pp. 61b-62a) reveal obvious differences. But even if identical beliefs could be shown here, they would not necessarily prove identity of authorship, precisely because others may very well have shared these views. In fact, Leon could very well have agreed completely with the Kol Sakhal in this matter, and still have abhorred his other doctrines.</page><page sequence="3">LEON DA MODENA AND KOL SAKHAL- RIVKIN 309 identification of an anonymous work, as his? His style is as typical of his age as it is of him; for he made it a point not only to conform to the literary standards of the time, but to insist that others also do so. In the Italy of his day, there was a conventional mould for virtually every type of literary expression. A dedication required one formula, an introduction, another, and a poem, still a third. His rab- binic commentary, the Beth Yehudah, is patterned after the classical rabbinic commentaries; his letters are models of epistolary correctness; his verse hews to the contemporary metrical standards. Like other writers of his time, he was fond of punning and took pleasure in making clever and sublte allusions to biblical and rabbinic texts. It is true that he excelled along these lines, but it was an excellence that was carefully circumscribed by the literary conventions of the day. It would thus be hazardous to identify a work as Leon's even if it possessed all the characteristic features of his writing; for these features are also found in the works of his contemporaries. How, then, can one attribute the Kol Sakhal to Leon when this work does not possess the specific literary characteristics of the period, but is so bereft of individuality that any Jewish writer in the late Middle Ages could have been its author? One looks in vain for the skillful play on words, the subtle references to rabbinical and biblical material, and the literary flexibility which characterize not only Leon's style but that of his contem- poraries.286 The clumsy, cumbersome, pedestrian-like style 286 J was unable to find a single pun or ingenious allusion in the Kol Sakhal, yet in Leon's one page introduction to the Kol Sakhal and the Shaagat Aryeh there are several, e. g., (p. 5): ... lnilmz i'D: n130 9Iz' ... r 1 n 1 W131e ny1 iz n w1i ... 1iZn1i1n -ni Inn . Also in the four pages of the Shaagat Aryeh, there are many puns and allusions; e. g., (p. 67): . .. nninn nilV3 iz by Imim im-'r ywwn nlr- 3w1; p. 68: pn 91nn j'.l "iP.n 1'M in[n M' z iyi imiwn, nno; p. 70: lint 'nyzn) r'nmn..

I shall introduce only two examples of differences in stylistic usage because they are especially significant. In his various writings Leon had occasion to deal with Chris- tianity, and he frequently refers to the Trinity and the Gospels. Invariably, he uses the term voiw'v for Trinity and r9",11inn for Gospels.287 The author of the Kol Sakhal, however, refers to the Trinity as r6tcm VJbw,288 and to the Gospels as w'nxiim njI1289 - designations which Leon never uses. The significance of this difference lies in the fact that these are technical terms and hence reflect current usage rather than personal selectivity. These illustrations should suffice, since stylistic criteria alone cannot be decisive. Even the most diverse styles would prove very little in the face of absolute agreement in the realm of ideas; and conversely, stylistic similarity may be brushed aside as coincidental if ideological disparity can be demonstrated. And it is precisely in the realm of ideas that Leon and the author of the Kol Sakhal have virtually nothing in common. A careful study of Leon's writings reveals that he ex- pressed views not only that cannot be harmonized with those of the Kol Sakhal, but which are diametrically opposed to them. These differences are manifest even in those areas where a superficial study finds agreement. reader that Leon's other works are replete with such literary devices. Nevertheless, it must be emphasized that even were it shown that the author of the Kol Sakhal used such devices, this would not prove that Leon was the author; for other writers resorted to them also. 287 Cf.

Yet one searches his writings in vain for so much as a hint that he held such theological views. It has been held that since both Leon and the author of the Kol Sakhal favored the curtailment of the liturgy, Leon must therefore have been the author of the Kol Sakhal.292 But in reality there is no agreement at all. The author of the Kol Sakhal wanted to eliminate all the standard prayers, including the Shema and the Amidah, and he even goes so far as to say that the Shema is no prayer at all !293 He advocated that the daily service be replaced by a short prayer, a paragraph in length, and that the services on the sabbath day should last no more than an hour.294 Leon, on the other hand, never advocated the elimination of even a single prayer which was part of the basic liturgy, such as the Shema and the Amidah. He did favor a radical curtailment of the many payyetanic additions which he 290 Cf. supra, JQR., XXIX (1948-49), pp. 64-66.

This obvi- ously is the meaning of his comment in the Beth Yehudah to the effect that now that Israel is in exile, Jews should be content to offer a short prayer rather than indulge in liturgical trivialities.295 So too, Leon was willing to permit Uriel da Costa to eliminate the payyetanic accretions as long as he did not interfere with the basic liturgy.296 Similarly, Leon, in contrast to the author of the Kol Sakhal, considered the Shema to be an example of the perfect prayer, and he considered it very important that it be said at the proper time.297 Even with regard to the characteristics of a good prayer, Leon and the author of the Kol Sakhal do not see eye to eye. Leon believed that when one said a short prayer, the prayer should be primarily devoted to the common weal,298 while the author of the Kol Sakhal does not even mention this principle in his formula for a good prayer.299 Neither is there agreement between Leon and the author of the Kol Sakhal with respect to congregational participa- tion in the services.

The author of the Kol Sakhal wanted to do away with the differences in ritual between Spanish, Italian, and German Jews.302 Leon, on the other hand, considered these ritual differences to be unimportant, and in fact he was very anxious that they be preserved.303 In attacking the Kab- balistic notions of prayer, Leon asks rhetorically whether the Kabbalists believe that God does not accept the prayers of the German, Sephardic, Italian, and Ponentine Jews merely because the wording differs. Are they of the opinion that only the kabbalistic formula are pleasing to Him?304 Most significant of all, however, is a glaring omission in the liturgical reforms advocated by the author of the Kol Sakhal. In the lengthy section on prayer and worship, the author never even remotely advocated the use of choral singing and music in the synagogue.305 He does not even insist that the cantor have a good voice, so long as it is JOI Beth Yehudah, II, 6a, col. 2: nJmnIp)n ornp 1Z' K'ian v nflnm nny 101 7D1' OKt IA ly 1im 1'1D' nmn9v 'm btim 1-7- bm5 Knm7W Vvn9 YSy ImlDD 1'" 'm 1rn9 'mnn'9 K -um pxn' pnK 'nom lo 'n9 Wrn K nvn.

The sharp contrast between the views of Leon and those of the author of the Kol Sakhal is apparent on every issue. The author of the Kol Sakhal denounced the use of Mezuzah because it was a rabbinical innovation.308 Leon, however, was consistently traditional in his view. "Come and see," he says in the Beth Yehudah, "how great is the power of the mezuzah! Rabbi Judah acted wisely when he sent a mezuzah in exchange for a precious gift [that had been sent to him]; for it is stated in the Palestinian Talmud ... that a mezuzah is sufficient to save a large city from being destroyed, even though the inhabitants thereof are guilty of idol worship."309 The author of the Kol Sakhal considered the tefillin to be in the same category as mezuzah: a rabbinical innova- tion.310 Not so did Leon consider it. In his Beth Yehudah, 306 Ibid., p. 42; cf. supra, n. 300. An interesting illustration of Reggio's false assumptions is his assertion (Bekinat ha-Kabbalah, p. 78) that the author of the Kol Sakhal must have been an Italian because he uses the word hazan for cantor, and not only shelta4 Pibbur as a Spanish Jew would use. Such an assertion is without basis, since Jacob ben Asher uses the term zazan in his Turtm. 307 Cf. supra, JQR, XXXVIII (1947-48), pp. 385-7. Similarly, the author of the Kol Sakhal has nothing to say about the neglect of Hebrew grammar by even learned Jews. If Leon had been the author of the Kol Sakhal, one would have expected him to take the rabbis to task for this state of affairs, as he so frequently does in his authentic writings (cf. Beth Yehudah, II, 12b, 32b; Ritt, Part IV, chapter x, ? 1, Part II, chapter i, ? 1; introduction to Lombroso's edition of the Bible, cited in Divan of Leon de Modena (ed. Bernstein), p. viii, n. 10. 308 Kol Sakhal, p. 59. 309 Beth Yehudah II, p. 32a, col. 2. 310 Kol Sakhal, pp. 38-9.</page><page sequence="9">LEON DA MODENA AND KOL SAKHAL-RIVKIN 315 he insisted on the importance of tefillin: They allude to the essentials of faith which are written therein: the existence, unity, and power of God. Man must be certain of these principles and not doubt them at all.3I" "One who does not put on tefillin or zizith," Leon ex- plained in another passage, "is an ignoramus. Although putting them on involves an act rather than knowledge, the person who performs the act indicates that he has some understanding [of the principles involved.]"32 Whereas the author of the Kol Sakhal ridicules the rabbinic teaching that even God wears tefillin,3'3 Leon found it pregnant with meaning. In attacking the Kab- balists he made a point of just this teaching: "How ridic- ulous," he said, "are the contentions of the Kabbalists that only through their methods can the teachings of the sages be understood! How, they ask, can one explain [except in our way] the rabbinical teaching that God wears tefillin?" "It is not at all difficult, [Leon replied], to understand this passage as alluding to God's love for Israel and to his desire to do good to them. Indeed all the anthropomorphic pas- sages in the Bible are to be explained in the same allegorical way.' '314 In sharp contrast to the Kol Sakhal, Leon approved of the minute regulations of the rabbis. "These [talmudic] passages which tell us to search for leaven," Leon explained, "are replete with useful lessons, and they are in agreement with the teachings of the early sages who said that leaven is to be compared to the evil inclination.... Thus when we search for leaven, we should arouse ourselves and examine our deeds and our thoughts so as to remove every 3I Beth Yehudah, I, 4b, col. 2; Magen we-Sinnah, pp. 5b-6a; Rtti Part I, chapter v, ? 10, Chapter xi, ? 4. 312 Beth Yehudah, I, p. 9b, col. 1. 3I3 Kol Sakhal, p. 39. 34 Ari Nohem, p. 21.</page><page sequence="10">316 THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW transgression and destroy every sin."'35 Contrast this view with the antagonistic attitude of the Kol Sakhal towards the custom!316 The author of the Kol Sakhal even objected to the reading of the Haggadah.3'7 Leon on the other hand, not only advocated that it be read, but he insisted that the order followed therein was proper.3'8 A very interesting difference between Leon and the author of the Kol Sakhal concerns the intermediate days of Pass- over and Sukkoth. The author of the Kol Sakhal demanded that all restrictions on work during these days be elim- inated.3Is It is clear that he must have felt that it was too severe an economic burden, for he gives this as a reason for abolishing the observance of the second day of the festi- vals.320 Leon, however, insisted that even the threat of severe economic loss should not deter the good Jew from observing strictly the intermediate days of Passover and Sukkoth. "These days of iol ha-Moed are very important," he said, "although many Jews treat them lightly. Preachers should reprove such Jews and point out to them that God will give a good reward to those who refrain from doing that which profanes His name even when it leads to a serious economic loss."321 (Italics mine). 31S Beth Yehudah, I, p. 21b, col. 1-2. 3I6 Kol Sakhal, p. 47: . .. .p-ii irnin ... yrnn np-ininr nin 9nn i: 1K:. 317 Ibid. 318 Beth Yehudah I, 4a, 24a.

The heretical author of the Kol Sakhal insisted that the Oral Law was first codified by Judah ing the progressive nature of rabbinic laws pertaining to the Sabbath (ibid., I, 28b-29a), with negative attitude of Kol Sakhal (p. 44). 322 Cf. Kol Sakhal, pp. 36, 37-38. 323 Beth Yehudah I, pp. 30a-b; cf. ibid., 35a; Magen we-.Sinnah, p. lOb. 324 Kol Sakhal, pp. 33, 37, 43, 47, 51, 63, 64, and passim. 325 Ibid., p. 51. 326 Beth Yehudah, I, p. 34b, col. 2. Leon's sympathy with the detailed laws of the rabbis is reflected in his assertion that they did well to discuss at length how ink for the writing of holy books should be made (Ibid., p. lib, col. 2; cf. Ibid., II, 24a, col. 2). So too in contrast to the author of the Kol Sakhal (p. 58), Leon approved of the rabbinical laws inculcating obedience to parents (Beth Yehudah, II, 13b, col. 2; 31b, col. 1; Riti Part IV, Chapter XI, ? 1, 2, 3), and found useful lessons in the rabbinical law pertaining to the rebellious son (Beth Yehudah II, 30b-31a). Similarly, Leon agreed with the rabbis that the beating of the willows on Hoshanah Rabbah was of prophetic origin (Beth Yehudah, I, 31a, col. 1-2). The author of the Kol Sakhal, on the other hand, fulminates against this law (p. 50). So too, Leon sees meaning in the rabbinical law of Shehita and the law of covering the blood after slaughtering (Beth Yehudah, II, 41a, col. 1, 41b, col. 2) which laws are opposed by the author of the Kol Sakhal (pp. 52-3).</page><page sequence="12">318 THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW the Patriarch because he wished to bring to an end the irresponsible piling up of numerous legal innovations one after another. But he failed as did all those following him who attempted to bring some order out of chaos.327 Leon held a contrary view. He held that the Oral Law was committed to writing because Judah feared the laws would be forgotten in times of stress. It was an emergency measure, and only because of this was the Oral Law put into writing. Codification is not desirable and frequently leads to harmful consequences. Living interpretation is to be preferred to final authorative decisions.328 Leon and the author of the Kol Sakhal likewise held mutually exclusive notions with respect to the toilet and to sex. The author of the Kol Sakhal looked upon these matters as unseemly, and he criticized the rabbis for dis- cussing them at great length.329 He even took exception to the rabbinical dictum which advocated sexual intercourse between husband and wife on Friday evening: "If a man can refrain from cohabiting with his wife on the Sabbath it is good, for what could be more repugnant than this . . "330 Such prudishness found no sympathy in Leon. He felt that the rabbis gave very sound advice in these matters, advice which enabled those who followed it to live healthy lives.33' No part of the body in itself was unseemly as long as it was used the way God had ordained.

That man utilizes it for unholy ends it not the fault of the organ, but of man's failure to curb his illegitimate desires.332 The differences in attitude between Leon and the author of the Kol Sakhal in this matter are especially significant, since they involve psychological commitments which would be most difficult to conceal. If Leon had really felt such aversion to toilet matters and sex, he would have expressed it openly inasmuch as a negative attitude towards sex in no way involved a heretical position. The author of the Kol Sakhal directed some of his most vitriolic attacks against the rabbinical laws which insisted that it was man's duty to procreate. This rabbinical inven- tion, he contended, was the source of all the hardships and tribulations that Jews undergo in the Dispersion. Each person should decide for himself whether he should have children, since the world will be preserved through others, if he refrains.333 Leon could never have been in sympathy with such views. His autobiography, and letters clearly reveal a man who dearly loved his wife and children.334 Furthermore, in his 332 AMagen we-Sinnah, p. 6b; cf.

This is one of the most bitter passages in the Kol Sakhal, and it could not have been written by a man who was in love with wife and children. 334 Only a husband with deep feeling could have written the following passage (Ilayye Yehudah, pp. 51-2): -ron nibri.:n ipo ow3 'nHn Htfl Dfl n y ;1 -7 i i mp :np z ;min, Y1'9n '.1, 0y: Din oln nry.1 01iw I'b lp n nWn D btl H'tl -'7 r z c 0' 9D: 'flfl'D D1"fl OH o ,oy'D3s fl ID 'rr, fl'D0 l nf,l ...Oyp9 nrlfl i 7 nr,n' '; cf. also ibid., p. 26 and passim; Leo Modenas Briefe, Letter 85, p. 84, Letter 84, p. 82. Leon's difficuilties with his wife were confined to his very last years, when she was obviously</page><page sequence="14">320 THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW Riti and elsewhere he commended the rabbis for their interest in procreation, since it saves man from sin.335 An equally sharp disagreement is to be found in the opposite views held by Leon and the author of the Kol Sakhal with respect to usury. Here too a non-heretical question is involved, and one would therefore expect com- plete agreement-if Leon were really the author of the Kol Sakhal. Yet they hold extremely divergent views. Leon is very much opposed to the practice of usury and would go so far as to prohibit Jews from taking usury from Christians.336 The author of the Kol Sakhal, however, would permit taking interest for a business loan even from Jews; for he makes a distinction between money borrowed for personal need and money borrowed for the purpose of making more money.337 That Leon could not have formulated this theory is proved bv the fact that he is frankly apologetic in his Riti for Jewish money-lending. He is anxious to point out to his gentile readers that the Jews should not engage in this occupation, even though necessity forces them to. The author of the Kol Sakhal is also very much concerned with the way gentiles feel about the Jews. He would not want to condone a practice that created ill-feeling among the mentallv unbalanced (cf. ibid., pp. 60-61). This was long after the KQI Sakhal came into Leon's hands. The affection that Ieon had for his children and grandchildren is frequently expressed; cf. IHayye Yehudah, pp. 28, 36, 39-40, and passim. Leon's intense sorrow over the death of his son Zebulon was expressed in his introduction to the Kol Sakhal and Shaagat Aryeh. 335 Riti, Part IV, chapter ii, ? 1. Leon here approved of the rabbinical injunction that a man should at all times be married - a teaching which the author of the Kol Sakhal (p. 62) ridiculed; cf. also Beth Yehudah 1, 26a, col. 1-2, Leo Modenas Briefe, Letter 70, pp. 66-8, and Magen we-.Sinnah, p. 6h (9zmnn'9D ;n93w l' p mlP ''l 9;; 9 nD:;: 336 Riti, Part II, Chap. v, ? 4, 5. 337 Kol Sakhal, p. 56.</page><page sequence="15">LEON DA MODENA AND KOI SAKHAL-RIVKIN 321 non-Jews. If, then, Leon had been the author of the Kol Sakhal, he would have used this occasion to attack the rabbis for permitting the taking of usury, since it created bitterness among the gentiles against the Jews!338 Under no circumstances would he have taken the positive stand towards usury held by the author of the Kol Sakhal! In many other instances, too, Leon takes a position which is incompatible with his authorship of the Kol Sakhal. Leon explicitly mentions in his Riti that the custom of kapparah on the eve of Yom Kippur was in disuse in Italy and in the Levant, and that it was an idolatrous and superstitious practice.339 The author of the Kol Sakhal also considered this to be an idolatrous practice, but he assumed that the rabbis favored it and that the custom was universally obeyed.340 Hence, Leon, could not have written this passage, since he was well aware - and he knew that his contemporary readers were well aware - of the fact that in Italy and in the Levant the custom was not observed, that rabbis in these countries considered the custom as superstitious, and that no less an authority than Joseph Karo had urged, in his 338 Note, for exanmple, the invective used by the author of the Kol Sakhal when he deals with procreation (p. 62), with the prohibition of using the bread and the wine of a non-Jew (pp. 54, 55), with idolatrous practices (pp. 55-6), etc. Usury would have afforded the author of the Kol Sakhal an excellent opportunity for similar abuse, if he had thought that usury was a cause of gentile enmity. It is obvious that if Leon had written the Kol Sakhal he would not have permitted the taking of interest, but would have inveighed against the rabbis for stirring up the wrath of the Christians against the Jews! 339 Rtti, Part III, Chapter vi., ? 2: e chiamavano Capara, ma in Levante, &amp; Italia si e dismesso, come cosa riconosciuta senza funda- mento, e superstitiosa. (My emphasis) 340 Kol Sakhal, p. 49. The author of the Kol Sakhal using the Turim, and apparently not knowing the Shulhan Arukh, assumed that the practice was universal, since the compiler of the Turim, Jacob ben Asher, urged that it be followed (Tur Orah Hayyim, Laws of Yom Kippur, 605). This ignorance of the custom that prevailed in 17th century Italy and the Levant, points to a 16th century date for the Kol Sakhal.</page><page sequence="16">322 THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW Shulhan Arukh, that the practice be discouraged.34' If Leon had been the author of the Kol Sakhal he would scarcely have held the rabbis responsible for a base custom which the rabbis themselves opposed! Similarly, Leon could not have written the passage in the Kol Sakhal which clearly implies that medical considerations were of no importance in the circumcision rites performed in accordance with rabbinical law.342 In his Riti he insisted that the Mohel must be proficient and that every medical precaution must be taken.343 Obviously, Leon as author of the Kol Sakhal would not have made accusations the absurdity of which would be patent to every Italian Jew who attended a circumcision ceremony! So too when dealing with the question of levirate marriage in the Riti, Leon subscribed to a point of view which is in stark contradiction to that of the author of the Kol Sakhal. The latter insisted that most brothers-in-law would prefer to marry the widow, but that the rabbis forced them to give azlitzah (Release). The reason for this, he said, was that the laws of release were complicated, and hence the services of the rabbis were more essential than in the simple rite of levirate marriage.344 Compare this approach with Leon's. In the Riti he explained that the rabbis urged zalitzah (Release), be- cause most men would marry for ulterior motives and thus frustrate the intent of the law.345 At the same time, he condemned the extortion which was frequently associated with securing bazitzah,346- an abuse which the author of the Kol Sakhal does not even mention!

The denunciation by the author of the Kol Sakhal of the rabbinical law forbidding the use of the wine of a non- Jew on the grounds that it made the Jews odious in gentile eyes, is another example of a point-of-view which would have had little meaning for the Italy of Leon's day.347 Leon explicitly stated in his Riti that the prohibition was not observed in Italy because the Jews did not consider Chris- tians idolators.348 He would hardly have attacked, had he been the author of Kol Sakhal, a condition which was not prevalent. That Leon and the author of the Kol Sakhal had nothing in common is illustrated by their opposite evaluation of rabbinic teachings. The author of the Kol Sakhal was in- sistent that the rabbis were responsible for the fact that the Jews were hated and despised.349 Leon, on the contrary, consistently praised the superiority of Jewish laws and institutions. In his Riti he explained how the rabbis emphasized the importance of being scrupulously honest in all dealings with gentiles, lest Jews be guilty of the very great sin of profaning God's holy name.350 Although the exile caused many Jews to disregard these teachings, they were nonetheless binding.36' Elsewyhere in the Riti, he pointed out that the rabbis taught that one must pay as much respect to the hoary head of a gentile as to that of a Jew.352 347 Kol Sakhal, p. 55. 348 Rsts, Part II, chapter viii, ? 1. 349 Kol Sakhal, pp. 33-4, and passim. 35O Riti, Part II, chapter v., ? 1 (Per obligo della Legge, cosi ds Mose, come a bocca, devono esser realissimi, e non fraudar, ne tgannare alcuno, sia chi si voglia, o Hebreo, o non Hebreo .. .) ? 2.

Differences such as these are apparent wherever one turns, and they outweigh in significance a host of superficial similarities.354 They prove conclusively that Leon was not the author of the Kol Sakhal. But even more convincing proof is at hand. The author of the Kol Sakhal refers to one or more works that Leon could not have written. One of these contained an attack against the Kabbalah and against the aggadic parts of the Talmud.355 It was supposed that Leon was referring to his own polemic against the Kabbalah, namely the Ari Nohem, and to his commentary, the Beth Yehudah.356 Such a supposition is completely unfounded, even if one were to assume that the author of the Kol Sakhal was referring to two works instead of one. Leon's work against the Kabbalah could not have been referred to because the author of the Kol Sakhal and Leon opposed the Kabbalah for entirely different reasons. 353 Ibid., Part V, chapter ii, ? 4. 354 An additional illustration is worth noting. The author of the Kol Sakhal after castigating the rabbis for the multiplicity of laws concludes as follows (p. 64): m6 D61Y mfl9'm nl9'i, KiK rllz|T -pn iK. Cf. this with Leon's high evaluation of the rabbinical laws and his insistence that through studying them one is assued a share in the world to come (Beth Yehudah II, 47b-48a): --riwi rzy pipan -n-n pnDaD VKrn w'n 1',nlinpv ~MIK' nixon In pN'n,NV D'1) -nnb -IM- n-an iwt lUl -imN DOir' 11i 'K m 1 Dp '1Y'9, fl1i,3 D"1VV -TD 'nomDK D610 n:Y9 1a3Y I9Drnm 'ni MY, 3 ryll tni VVbIyr nX31 -y0 -IDIT rnrl' llntn W'. 355 Kol Sakhal, p. 32: DipDo ' rt irDKnm 1 rifl1 in y ni n nam rn 356 Reggio in Behinat ha-Dat, p. 77: ntt wri' n: 1: innv yzn InIM3 11.9D nt -n:t -p-I ,DD,n -ilnn nln- 1331DI ]'"N I-1 -im n t-I 11 ['N'' 11 snvm ': 6i-pr - -in-rn rn' -i. Although no mention is made of the Beth Yehudah, this is the only work that Leon wrote on the aggadic parts of the Talmud. He never wrote a work dealing with the midrashim, as did the author of the Kol Sakhal.</page><page sequence="19">LEON DA MODENA AND KOL SAKHAL-RIVKIN 325 The former attacked the Kabbalah because it was based on rabbinic teachings,357 whereas Leon attacked it because it was alien to rabbinic tradition.358 Likewise it is impossible to identify Leon's commentary, the Beth Yehudah, with the anti-aggadic work referred to by the author of the Kol Sakhal. This work must have been a blistering attack against the teachings of the rabbis if one is to judge from the evaluation of these aggadic teachings' in the Kol Sakhal: "One third of the midrashic and aggadic teachings of the rabbis deal with useless and impossible things; one-third with eating, drinking, and sexual inter- course; one-half of one-third, speaks of God as though he were the basest of men and of his righteous followers in a manner minimizing their merits; one fourth of one third is riddles that later scholars repeated as wisdom; one- fourth of one-third consists of some good teaching, since it would be impossible that out of so many thousands of speakers not even one should utter something good.... I have already been drawn aside from my purpose in writing this essay, for I have elsewhere expressed myself at length concerning these aggadic teachings and this Kabbalah."359 One searches in vain throughout Leon's many writings for so much as a single example of this type of thiAking. 357 Kol Sakhal, p. 32: 198rVT ly3 ', nly-r Kbt f wn DZ 01po URbm r'prirpnl nlnnn 'n ry mnnmm. In listing the characteristic misconcep- tions in the Kabbalah (pp. 31-32), (n1iyDnmi nmom lnn), the author of the Kol Sakhal makes-no mention of the belief in transmigration of souls (9Ih) -a concept so bitterly opposed by Leon not only in the Ari Nohem, but in a special work the Ben Davnd devoted just to this subject. Does this omission point to a pre-Lurianic date for the Kol Sakhal? 358 Cf.

And in no work is this feeling more evident than in the Beth Yehudah - a work which from beginning to end is a tribute to the teachings of the rabbis.360 Finally, the author of the Kol Sakhal refers to a philo- sophical work that he wrote dealing with the whole problem of creatio ex nihilo.36' No writing of Leon deals with that problem; hence he could not have been the author of the Kol Sakhal. It is thus obvious that whoever wrote the Kol Sakhal also wrote one or more works dealing with the problem of creation, attacking the Kabbalah as an outgrowth of rab- binic teaching, and deriding the aggadic teachings of the Talmud and the midrashim. Since none of Leon's works show such characteristics, and since the heretical ideas of the Kol Sakhal can be found nowhere in Leon's writings, one may assert that Leon could not have been the author of the Kol Sakhal.362 360 Leon's high regard for the aggadic teachings accounts for the Beth Yehudah and for the Beth Lehem Yehudah. The latter is a topical index to aggadic passages. As a preacher Leon was especially interested in these teachings. 36I Kol Sakhal, p. 8: o .nm innK mlpon -iln 'plD91 ni'K7 'nKm, imi 'ii np'n Y'3flDUD lriv'v rin rion rit -r mnn'. The author of the Kol Sakhal refers (p. 9) to the divine Plato. Leon never expressed himself so; cf. Ben David, p. 64. 362 If Leon did not write the Kol Sakhal, then who did? Unfortunately, the author's identity must remain unknown until new evidence comes to light. However, a few comments may be in order with respect to the problem of dating the Kol Sakhal. Although the evidence is still not decisive, the following considerations pointing to a 1500 date should be considered. 1) No evidence whatsoever exists at present which pre- cludes the possibility of its having been written, as Leon holds, about 1500. 2) The author uses the Turtm of Jacob ben Asher and not the Shulhan Arukh. He is likewise completely ignorant of Karo's work, assuming that all Jews accept the teaching of the Turim with respect</page><page sequence="21">LEON DA MODENA AND KOL SAKHAL-RIVKIN 327 The implications, then, of the evidence are clear. Leon was an enlightened spokesman for rabbinic Judaism and he never deviated from his loyalties. He was a bitter opponent of heresy, and he never lost an opportunity to write polemics against those who sought to undermine the authority of the Oral Law. The Kol Sakhal was a work that came into his hands and which he sought to refute, in the same manner that he had refuted the Theses of Uriel da Costa. How odd that so talented a defender of the faith should for so long have worn the heretic's crown! to kapparoth. A 17th century writer would have known that Jews in Italy and the Levant did not approve of the custom. 3) There is complete ignorance of practices current in Italy during the early 17th century. 4) The author never mentions the Levantine ritual, but only the Sephardic, Ashkenazic, and Italian. Leon always mentions the Levantine, and uses Sephardim as synonymous with Levantine. 5) There are no anachronisms which I have been able to find. 6) There are no stylistic peculiarities which would necessitate a later date. Until more reliable evidence is at hand, we have no right to reject Leon's assertion as to the date of its composition.</page></plain_text>
