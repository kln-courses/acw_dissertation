Klyde and R. Wade Allen Systems Technology, Inc. Kevin Rider University Of Michigan Ann Arbor Kristin Overmeyer Intrinsic, Inc. Copyright © 2005 SAE International ABSTRACT A combined biodynamic and vehicle model is used to assess the vibration and performance of a human operator performing driving and other tasks. The other tasks include reaching, pointing and tracking by the driver and/or passenger. This analysis requires the coordinated use of separate and mature software programs for anthropometrics, vehicle dynamics, biodynamics, and systems analysis. The total package is called AVB-DYN, an acronym for Anthropometrics, Vehicle and Bio-DYNamics. The biodynamic component of AVB-DYN is described, and then compared with an experiment that studied human operator in-vehicle reaching performance using the U.S. Army TACOM Ride Motion Simulator. INTRODUCTION The work presented herein was conducted as part of a Phase II Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) program for the U.S. Army Research Laboratory at Aberdeen Proving Ground, MD. The ultimate goal of this program is to develop a computer aided design tool, referred to herein as AVB-DYN, for analyzing the effect of dynamic environments on the habitability and performance of the human operator in specific workstation designs. In the analysis of human/machine interactions, the first models developed were behavior models for precision control tasks. These models describe the input/output relationship of the overall system and have been verified extensively with experimental data. The basic elements of the precision control task are illustrated in the Figure 1 block diagram. Here, the mission or task produces forcing function inputs in the form of command inputs that are to be followed and disturbance inputs that are to be regulated against. The display presents the command and feedback quantities to the human operator who then produces the necessary control actions to manipulate the controlled element. The system outputs are then displayed directly or indirectly to the human operator to complete the feedback loop. The repeatability of human behavior when performing such tasks has led to the description of underlying laws, in particular the "crossover law" (for review see McRuer &amp; Krendel, 1974). Figure 1. Basic Elements Involved in a Precision Control Task The human/machine interaction begins at the left with the sensory inputs. These include visual, proprioceptive, and vestibular (i.e., the so-called "seat-of-the-pants" feel) inputs. When performing a precision control task, the forcing functions are perceived primarily by the visual channel. These sensory channels provide the input signals to the higher brain processes. The end result of these processes is motor commands in the form of alpha and gamma motor neuron signals that operate the neuromuscular system. Finally, the neuromuscular system provides inputs to the controlled element to guide the motions of the vehicle. 863</page><page sequence="2">To this point the control loop structure for the human/machine system has been established for precision control tasks, and the generalized human response structure has been identified. The next step is to place the human/machine system in a vibration environment. The required elements to interface the human and machine in such an environment are shown in Figure 2. The top of the figure features the familiar precision task control loop that includes the display, human operator, controlled element, and feedback path. Below are the additional elements that are required in a biodynamic environment. The three primary interfaces for the human are the display, the seat, and the control inceptor (steering wheel, stick, pedals, etc.). These elements interact with the vehicle structure (e.g., the floor) in a passive or possibly active manner. An example of an active interaction is a seat with vibration isolation features. In a dynamic environment the display, seat, and control have modes at unique frequencies with different amplitudes and phases. When the amplitude of the vibrations becomes large simply viewing the display or gripping the controller can become difficult. Figure 2. Biodynamic Interfaces for Human/Machine Control Linear models to describe the human operator in this biodynamic environment were created and validated by Systems Technology, Inc. over more than a decade of research conducted primarily for the U.S. Air Force. The end result was the model referred to as BIODYN, with the most recent version referred to as BIODYN-80 [2] . The work described herein involves the translation of this linear model to a fully nonlinear, 6 degree-of- freedom multi-body model and subsequent validation. The new model is referred to as BIODYN-II. The BIODYN-II component consists of a skeletal model and a neuromuscular model. The skeletal model approximates the relevant morphology and function of the human skeleton but is equivalent to a mechanical system, (i.e., a system of linked rigid bodies), which is currently a 17-segment and 16-joint multi-body system. The neuromuscular model, which approximates specifically relevant morphology and function of the human neuromuscular system, represents the net effect of complex agonist/antagonist muscle pairs. Validation of a model as complex as the AVB-DYN BIODYN-II model represents a significant challenge. Data from carefully designed experiments in which human subjects are exposed to relevant vehicle motion environments are required. In this paper, the data from an extensive University of Michigan/TACOM study of driver ride motion response ([9], [10]) will be used to tune and test the AVB-DYN BIODYN-II model. A key strategy was to apply system identification methods to validate and refine estimates of skeletal and neuromuscular parameters. BIODYN-II MODEL The BIODYN-II model is based on BIODYN-80 [9] and mechanized using the Tango multi-body physics engine software package. Body segment parameters were generated by Jack from UGS PLM Solutions and GEBOD from the U.S. Air Force [8]. The details of the model will be described in the following. BIODYN-80 BIODYN-80 is a versatile computational tool used to determine transmissibility transfer functions between vertical and/or fore-aft vibration inputs and important biodynamic outputs, such as motions of the torso, head, eyes, arms, or hands. The program scenario assumes a seated operator, gripping an arbitrary-angle stick and viewing a display, possibly engaged in a tracking task. The physical model uses an "isomorphic," lumped parameter approach to represent the relevant portions of the whole-body torso, limbs, and head, as well as postural compliances among the joints. The implementation of this model includes a chain of interacting parallel and serial second-order elements, with neuromuscular and other force feedbacks at the arm or head. The resulting equations are in "second- order element" matrix form and apply to a wide range of seated postures. A separate input file that describes the particular set of parameters to be used is created by the user (usually by modifying one of a cataloged set). This file is incorporated in the matrix to produce linear coefficients for perturbations about the selected equilibrium posture. A variety of outputs and inputs can be specified to evaluate the desired transmissibility transfer functions. Figure 3 presents the biomechanical model and defines many of the necessary parameters that describe the nominal (or trim) situation. It utilizes an "isomorphic," or body-mimicking representation, of the major body segments in their orientations, simplified to a minimum 864</page><page sequence="3">number of lumped parameter equivalents. The biomechanical features include: • Semisupine torso - sliding hip plus rocking chest supported on a compliant buttocks/seat; • Head bobbing on an articulated neck with passive compliance, or active neuromuscular system; • Upper arm and forearm links plus grip-interface compliance, driven by an active neuromuscular system; • Arm-rest restraints (optional); and • Stick "feel system" dynamics from zero to infinite stiffness, and any angle of stick or grip. The simplified torso model was derived to describe the dominant motions of the head and arm elements. Thus the "pin joint" node between upper and lower torso segments is not meant to represent any physical feature. In practice, the masses and inertias are obtained from tabulated bio-mechanical and anthropometric data for the appropriate sized person, the postural angles are based on the actual situation, and the spring forces and damping coefficients are fitted to data or taken from other sources (e.g., [2] and [3]). Figure 3. Main Biomechanical Elements of BIODYN-80 A lateral vibration biodynamic model is shown in Figure 4 (Appendix B of [4]) for a compensatory control task. For this task the operator commands his neuromuscular system (NMS) based on the state of the error signal. The NMS then moves the limb, which in turn actuates the control stick. Inputs from a motion environment enter the loop by acting directly on the control stick, and by causing limb motion due to shoulder motions transmitted through the operator's torso. The biomechanical process causes motion induced control responses for lateral vibration. Here the elements for the vertically positioned stick as well as upper torso plus hip body segments have been "folded flat" into the plane of lateral arm motions. The arm pivots about the shoulder and connects to the top of the center stick through interface damping and compliance. The arm is modeled as a simple solid inertial segment as independent motion at the elbow is not considered important based on observations during the experiment. The control stick has distributed mass and is restrained by rotational compliance and damping. The arm is driven, relative to the shoulder, by agonist/antagonist muscle pairs for which the model will use one net muscle pair. The effects of NMS restraints on arm motion relative to the operator's shoulder in response to motion inputs are a concern. Simple compliance and damping are assumed to represent the basic NMS effects as a low frequency approximation. The torso is assumed to pivot as a solid body about the hip complex, and is restrained by rotational compliance and damping. The hip complex is shown undergoing pure lateral translation only, being restrained by compliance and damping provided by the subject using his legs to brace himself as well as by flesh movement at the seat cushion interface. Figure 4. Lateral Vibration Model BIODYN-II SIX DEGREE-OF-FREEDOM MODEL The complete BIODYN-II model is the combination of the longitudinal and lateral models of BIODYN-80. The combined constraints and action/reaction effects of each joint are listed in Table A.1 in the Appendix. The first 865</page><page sequence="4">two major columns show the constraints and effects of the joints in the lateral and longitudinal models of BIODYN-80. The combined constraints and effects of the complete BIODYN-II 6DOF model are listed in the last column. Since the GEBOD data are determined to be used for setting up the BIODYN-II model, modifications were made to the model so that it better complies with the body segmentation of GEBOD (Figure 5). The major modification to the model is the addition of a second abdomen segment, and the thighs, calves and feet that were not a part of the original BIODYN-80. The feet are currently assumed to be adhered to the cab floor. Figure 6. BIODYN-II Body Segmentation TANGO MULTI-BODY PACKAGE In this Phase II effort, the BIODYN-II skeletal model was formulated and coded using the "TANGO Physics Engine" developed by Intrinsic, Inc. of Brighton, Ml. TANGO is a multi-body dynamics tool comparable to established software such as DADS and ADAMS. It provides a relatively straightforward procedure for defining complex multi-body mechanical systems and effectively formulates the equations of motion and integrates them to provide time series of positions, velocities, accelerations, forces and moments at user- specified points in the system. The formulation of the dynamics of the skeletal system will be intrinsically nonlinear including the nonlinearity associated with inequality constraints. The use of TANGO has significant advantages for formulating a skeletal model considerably more complex than the original BIODYN-80 model. The modeling complexity increases exponentially with the number of body components due in part to complex holonomic constraints (generally due to linking of body parts) and inequality constraints (generally related to seat restraints). An intermediate software layer (ISL) that wraps around TANGO was developed for the implementation of BIODYN-II. The primary goal of the ISL is to look at the data structure exported from the anthropometrics software, (e.g. Jack and GEBOD) and then create the biodynamic model automatically. The ISL supports: 1) the loading of a text file description of the biodynamic system data, 2) the editing of the biodynamic system data, 3) the graphical (3 dimensional) representation of the biodynamic system, and 4) the creation and simulation of the biodynamic system. The ISL also has utility functions that facilitate the coordinate transformation, input signal links, output signal links and format conversions. The structure of the ISL is shown in Figure 6. The system contains lists of bodies, joints, and effects. Each body contains lists of frames. Each joint and effect refers to the frames of certain bodies as part of its definition. Inputs and outputs also refer to frames for where to send excitation to and get information from. System I I Body Joint Effect Input ^ ^ Frame Output Figure 5. Intermediate Software Layer (ISL) Structure MODEL PARAMETERS The parameters for setting up a complete BIODYN-II model will be primarily from the following two sources: Jack Anthropometrics Software: Jack includes kinematic and biomechanic human models with 69 segments and 68 joints that obey physiological joint limits. The models can be represented as stick figures, wire frame, shaded, high resolution or transparent models. The database includes U.S. Army personnel from ANSUR 88. Other sources are NASA RP-1024, SAE J833, and NHANES III. During this project, the mass and center of mass (COM) properties of each body segment were reviewed and implemented in the new anthropometric toolkit of Jack by UGS PLM Solutions. Body section weights and COM locations are calculated from regression equations (Clauser, McConville &amp; Young, 1969; McConville, Churchill, Kaleps, Clauser &amp; Cuzzi, 1980).Additional COM locations are calculated based on ratios from Humanscale 1/2/3 [7], The moment of inertia properties, which are not currently available in Jack, are provided by GEBOD. 866</page><page sequence="5">GEBOD (Generator of Body): GEBOD, developed by Systems Research Laboratory, Inc. of Dayton, OH for the U.S. Air Force, is an interactive software application that generates human and anthropomorphic test dummy body descriptions that include: geometric and mass properties of body segments; and locations and mechanical properties of the joints. The GEBOD software can be used to compute the body segments and joints properties of children, adult females and males, or anthropomorphic dummies. For adult subjects, GEBOD requires weight and/or standing height inputs. The software then computes body segment and joint properties and writes the data to a user specified output file. For this project, only the moment of inertia and principal axis information from GEBOD are used (see Cheng &amp; Rizer, 1994 for more information). The computed body data includes the body dimensions, for example waist height, head length, shoulder to elbow length, etc. GEBOD also provides inertia properties of each body segment and mechanical properties such as stiffness and viscosity and locations of each joint. GEBOD, also, may compute the body data with user specified body dimensions. With this feature, users can compute the necessary body information with specific body dimensions of children, adult males and females. BIODYN-II MODEL VALIDATION IN-VEHICLE REACH STUDY The University of Michigan has conducted a human reach experiment using the US Army RDECOM's Ride Motion Simulator (RMS). The goal of the experiment was to investigate human operator performance, specifically reaching performance, under a vibration environment [9], Though the design of the experiment focused on the motion of the fingertip, its wide range of control factors (12 subjects, 4 input frequencies, 4 input amplitudes, and 9 discrete postures) and reasonable motion data resolution (in the scale of mm) make it applicable to the validation of the BIODYN-II model. Each subject had highly reflective marker balls attached to his or her body. The markers were tracked by a VICON motion capture system with ten cameras. There were also two accelerometers attached to the seat (seatpan and seatback). While sitting in the RMS, the subject was instructed to push one of eight target buttons located in the cab. When not reaching to a target, the subject held the home button on the steering wheel (control column). The complete data set collected in the experiment includes the motion inputs into the RMS, subject push button signals, accelerations at the seat and seatback, and motion capture data collected by the VICON system. The push button and acceleration data, which are primarily analog data, can be used without further processing. RMS Inputs: There are two sets of vibration inputs in the experiment. The first set features single sinusoidal waves with various frequencies (2-8 Hz), amplitudes (0.1 - 0.5 g), and directions (longitudinal, lateral, and vertical). This input set is ideal for dynamic system identification. The second set is a real world road profile, which provides a reality check of the data. Subject Reach Data: For this paper, we have focused on the "driving" posture, which is when both of the subject's hands are on the steering wheel. Since the subject was performing various tasks throughout the experiment run, it is critical to determine the subject's posture as a function of time for the.validation process. Figure 7. Subject Reach Data There is one analog signal channel for each target button and the home button. A target button is pushed when its voltage is zero. Figure 7. a shows when the 867</page><page sequence="6">targets 3 and 8 were engaged. A sudden drop in the home button voltage indicates that the home button is pushed, while a short duration peak in voltage indicates that the home button is released (Figure 7.b). The fingertip trajectory shown in Figure 7. c provides another view of the process. Between 30 and 33 seconds, the subject reached to target 3 located at 45° to the right; and between 36 and 39 seconds, the subject reached to target 8 above the subject. The quiescent periods between these two reaches coincides with the subject holding the home button. Therefore, using the push button signals in conjunction with the motion capture data, the subject posture can be determined at any point in the run time. Motion Data The subject model used in the University of Michigan/TACOM study has 24 markers and 8 targets as shown in Figure 8. Twelve subjects participated in the study ranging from a light weight female to a heavy weight male. The experiments featured sinusoidal vibration forcing functions of varying amplitudes and frequencies and axis of input. The trajectories of the markers have been recorded. However, data for markers on the right-hand side of the body were more clearly visible than those on the left due to interference of the RMS cabin with line of sight of the capture system cameras. Based on the recommendations of Mr. Rider, the project lead from the University of Michigan, STI selected a heavy weight male (180 cm in height and 97.7 kg in weight) to initiate the BIODYN-II validation process. Figure 8. TACOM RMS Platform, Subject Marker Positions and Target Positions From the camera image of the reflective markers, three different sets of data can be generated from the Vicon iQ software that is included with the motion capture system, including the motion of the platform, markers located at different parts of the body, and the simplified representation of the body skeleton (shown in Figure 9). In Figure 10 an example of the processed data under a 4Hz, 0.35 g vertical sinusoidal vibration is shown. Two seconds of data have been selected during which the subject held the home button (driving posture). The platform signal though somewhat noisy, shows a 4 Hz sine wave with 20 mm amplitude peak to peak. The torso and shoulder responses to this vibration move in all three directions, but mainly in the vertical direction. The elbow has similar motion as the shoulder but also has more significant lateral motion. This is probably because the elbow flips inward and outward as the arm moves up and down. The fingertip follows the motion of the platform because the subject was holding the steering wheel. In the following analysis, the focus is on the motion of the shoulder. Figure 9. Vicon iQ Software Figure 10. Trajectories of the Major Markers Transfer Function Calculation A transfer function provides an efficient and comprehensive view of the relationship between input and output signals. Therefore, the time histories of the input-output pair (platform and shoulder in this case) have been converted into transfer functions in the frequency domain using FFT (Fast Fourier Transform) analysis. For a complete test run in the RMS motion data, a subject was instructed to push the target buttons at various positions. Between the target-pushing, the subject assumed a driving posture (gripping the steering wheel). In general, there are eight to ten times in a test run that the subject was in the driving position. To get a 868</page><page sequence="7">better idea of the dynamic behavior of the subject in the driving posture, all of the data segments in that posture need to be investigated. Using the data segmentation scheme described earlier, all of the driving posture data segments in a test run were identified. Data segments that have time span larger than one second were selected and their input-output transfer functions were calculated and plotted (e.g. Figure 11). Each data point represents a data segment. To better summarize the results, the data points are grouped according to their input amplitudes. Data points within each amplitude group are averaged and the minimum and maximum values within that group were marked using error bar notation. The result are shown in Figure 12 and Figure 13. Figure 11. Transfer Function from Platform Horizontal to Shoulder Horizontal Figure 12. Error Bar Representation of the Transfer Function from Platform Horizontal to Shoulder Horizontal Figure 13. Transfer Function from Platform Vertical to Shoulder Vertical BIODYN-II SIMULATION Anthropometric Parameters The only available information about the subject in this experiment was his or her weight, height, and arm length. These measurements are far less than those required to set up a BIODYN-II model, but could be used as inputs to the GEBOD program to generate the detail anthropometric data of the subject. To justify the use of the GEBOD program, GEBOD data were compared with the measurement of the subject and the marker positions (Table 1). The GEBOD data had a very good prediction of the forearm and hand and reasonable prediction of the upper arm (the error is less than 10%). Table 1. Measured and Predicted Arm Length for the Subject Subject Marker GEBOD Measurement Position Prediction Weight 97.7 kg 97.7 (input) Height 180.3 cm 180.3 (input) Upper Arm N/A 29 - 31 .5 cm 33.8 cm Forearm N/A 31.8 cm 30.9 cm Hand N/A 19.5 cm 19.5 cm Forearm + Hand N/A 51.3 cm 50.3 cm Arm Length 79.4 cm 80.3 -82.8 cm 84.15 cm (Shoulder-Hand) The BIODYN-II model was set up for the subject using the size and mass properties from the GEBOD program, and posture extracted from the motion data. What were missing were the force generation/transmission effects including seat compliance, arm strength, waist and neck stiffness, etc. These properties were not measured in the experiment and thus need to be estimated. A good starting point was the default parameter set of BIODYN- II, since these parameters were based on estimations from real data used in BIODYN 80 [2]. The simulation result is shown in Figure 15, in which the transfer function of the input-output pair of the BIODYN-II model is compared with that of experimental data (Figure 13). The BIODYN-II model has a peak magnitude at 2.5 Hz while the data peaks at 4 Hz. Though the model has failed to predict the data, it has captured important characteristics of the data. Next, the parameters were adjusted to get an improved match. There were four major factors in driving posture that may affect the dynamic response of the biodynamic system including the force between hip and seat, the torque at the waist and shoulder that maintains the posture of upper torso, and the force at the hand/grip interface (see Figure 14). 869</page><page sequence="8">Figure 14. Major Force/Torque Factors in Driving Posture Figure 15. Transfer Function of Default BIODYN-II Model First, a sensitivity study was performed. The parameters were varied one at a time while keeping the others constant. The simulation results of 50%, 100% and 200% of the default values were compared against the experimental data. The change in hip/seat parameters clearly has significantly influenced the results (Figure 16), while the other three factors have only minimal effects. Figure 16. Sensitivity Study of the Hip/Seat Effect Further tuning of the hip/seat factor resulted in a BIODYN-II model that has a good prediction of the magnitude response (Figure 17). The discrepancy in the phase response (about 60° at 8 Hz) requires further investigation. Figure 17. Transfer Function of Tuned BIODYN-II Model One set of experiments in the RMS data used a real world road profile as the input for the RMS platform. This road profile is ideal for the validation of BIODYN-II model because it has only vertical component and the amplitude range of its acceleration (± 0.5 g) is compatible with the data used for model identification (Figure 18). The road profile is loaded into the BIODYN- II model for driving platform motion. The simulation result is then compared with the shoulder motion measured in the RMS experiment. Figure 19 shows the comparison of shoulder vertical motion from the data and the BIODYN-II model. The shaded areas indicate the subject was in the "driving" posture. The simulation result matches the data closely in these areas. Figure 18. Road Profile Input 870</page><page sequence="9">Figure 19. BIODYN-N Time Response Prediction CONCLUSIONS AVB-DYN is an integrated software package that combines anthropometric, vehicle dynamics, biodynamic, and system analysis tools. This paper discussed the biodynamic part (BIODYN-II) of this integrated package. The framework and implementation of BIODYN-II was described in detail. A motion capture data set was used for the validation of the BIODYN-II model. The time domain dynamic response under a real world vibration input verified the model prediction matches the data very well. The overall purpose of AVB-DYN is to evaluate human operator performance in vehicle-mounted workstations. This includes issues of ride quality and comfort to the extent that they impact human operator performance. The human operator may be controlling the vehicle (e.g., a driver or pilot) or may be performing another task (e.g., tracking a target, monitoring a display screen, entering data using a keyboard). The human could also be a passive passenger concerned only with ride quality, but this situation is not the primary focus of the current work. Unlike much of the other biodynamic software developed in recent years, AVB-DYN is not focused on prediction of injury or impact of the human with the vehicle interior. However, under sufficiently large accelerations and loose restraints, the biodynamic model to be formulated should compute such impacts properly. Though this paper has focused on the "driving" task, the model can be used to study other tasks including reaching for a button, pointing a weapon, etc. ACKNOWLEDGMENTS This work is the result of a Phase II Small Business Innovative Research (SBIR) project funded by the U.S. Army Research Laboratory, Human Research and Engineering Directorate, at Aberdeen Proving Ground in Maryland.
