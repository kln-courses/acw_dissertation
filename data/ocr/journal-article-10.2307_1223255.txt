<plain_text><page sequence="1">AUGUST 1991 subgroups/group, average of 5), and within three subgroups a total of 16 subsubgroups (again my term). None of this is dichotomous or indeed parallel in construction. In fact, Welch argues against dichotomous keys on p. 62. In addition, there are "guides" for Abies, Cupressus, and Juniperus (resp., pp. 98-100, 290-291, 324-325), actually tables for the first two, and finally even a dichotomous key for Chamaecyparis (p. 196). On the downside are use of angiosperm terminology ("flowers," "fruits," etc.), anthropomorphic and teleological expressions (among the worst, species that "laughed," a plant that "wakes up slowly" in the spring, p. 32), various slips (e.g., "Johnson" for "Johnston," p. 317), fuzzy language (Diselma in mountains of "Australia and W. Tasmania," p. 317), and erroneous ranges (Fitzroya cupressoides "only in southern Chile," p. 317, a mistake also in Krussmann, p. 119). I examined the manuals by Welch, Rushforth, Kriissmann, and three others, including W. Dallimore &amp; A. B. Jackson's A hand- book of Coniferae and Ginkgoaceae (1966, 4th ed. rev. by S. G. Harrison) to seek morphological and horticultural information (but not especially information on cultivars) on Ginkgo and 12 species of conifers. All show similar slips and fuzziness. Indeed the disagreement and misinformation perpet- uated from one book to the next is rather disconcerting. Welch's work naturally is vital for an up- dating of nomenclatural and taxonomic aspects of the many infraspecific taxa he treats. Unfortu- nately, the high cost of the book, ca. $137.75 for the first of two volumes, will restrict its acquisition to botanical libraries. Individuals needing a "conifer manual" will get much better value for their money spending $65.00 on Kriissmann or $27.95 on Rushforth. [Rudolf Schmid, UC] Woodland, Dennis W.

He appears to have succeeded, though the proof will be in the pudding sales. The book covers the requisite topics, including a useful chapter with con- tributions by four outsiders (see Contents) that distills Stuessy's new Davis &amp; Heywood (for review see R. Schmid, Taxon 40: 361-362), and 245 handy, compact summaries for vascular plant families. The 210 family synopses for the angiosperms are ringed with a border and involve one page per fam- ily except for grasses and comps, which slop onto two pages (legumes are split into three families). Students will be intrigued by the many photos of botanists and botanical institutions and by the fig- ures of newspaper clippings on plant rustling (p. 468), the letter to John Thomas by a student who is endangering plants (p. 473), and the phylogeny of paper clips (p. 399).
