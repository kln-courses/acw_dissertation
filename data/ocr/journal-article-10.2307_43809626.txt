This essay explores the less familiar, Norwegian sources of Naess's thought and its rootedness in the Scandinavian Enlighten- ment. The context of the native tradition illuminates both the underlying central values of Deep Ecology - and its famous inconsistencies. THE LINEAGE OF A GREEN UTOPIA In 1984, on one of his many eco-trips round the world, Professor Arne Naess alighted at the University of Minnesota for an International Conference. Con- scious of, but unabashed by, the reputation of Norwegians as Weltverbesserer ('timeless world improvers'), he presented a paper in which he outlined the Green Utopia of Norway in the anno 2084.1 Naess imagines a group of visitors from Houston landing on an island near Bergen (islands are mandatory in Utopias - they so easily convert to versions of the self). The Houstonians encounter an egalitarian, self sufficient community riding around on bicycles. This community consists of humans, animals, plants, forests and fjords coexisting in biotic bliss with one another. Technology has low visibility and is used with discernment. Odd atavisms from the 20th century, however, remain. 'The people are not willing to give up their wooden stoves, their telephones, their trains and their bicycles.' There is even a counterculture of youths still infatuated with consumerism. łA not-too happy counterculture', obviously. Most strikingly, Homo norvegicus futurus does not require alcohol or drugs for the sufficient reason that he is rarely bored. The visitors from centres Worldviews : Environment, Culture , Religion 1 (1997): 57-73 © 1997 The White Horse Press, Cambridge, UK.</page><page sequence="2">58 NINA WITOSZEK of decadence (such as Houston, Texas) are offered a pseudo-mathematical equation: B- R (F + D)3 where boredom (B) is proportional to repetition (R) and inversely proportional to feeling (F) and discrimination (D) raised to the third power. Significantly enough, there are only a few artists and scientists on the island. They feel that 'Norway is too small for them and that they have little impact on the rest of the population. Apart from a few large centres of learning, most Universities and High Schools are small and interaction between them is less intense than a hundred years ago'.2 This, in brief, is a utopia of the future ecocentric man: a logical extension in many ways of the principal strategies of Arne Naess's own Deep Ecology. It is moderately flexible (in that it allows for some concessions to the ancien régime) and moderately inconsistent - as indeed is Naess himself. If looked at carefully, it reveals an intimate connection, not just with contemporary scenarios of environmental future, but with the indigenous nature tradition. While discussing the nucleus of native inspiration in Naess' s thought, Peter Reed and David Rothenberg have pointed to such matters as contemporary Norwegian philosophy (from Peter Wessel Zapffe to Sigmund Kval0y); socio- ecological factors such as low population density, the salience of rural culture and indeed the very exuberance of nature itself; the robustness of naturromantikken (nature romanticism) in literature and painting from Wergeland to Finn Alnaes; the practice of everyday life fixated as it is on outdoor activities, and, finally, the eco-political strategies of both the Norwegian state and the radical native counter-culture.3 While not disputing the relevance of these fairly evident factors, I wish to discuss in more detail the books, deeds and people that have shaped the communal memory in which Naess's thought is immersed. For it is against the background of indigenous normative patterns and traditions of knowledge that we become struck, not by the radicalism, but the archaism of Naess's thought. These traditions reach far beyond contemporary green awakenings or a problematic Romanticism; they draw on the ancient wisdom encoded in the sagas. Naess, we might say, established a green canon for the twentieth century which resonates with modern sensibility, appeals to our intuitions and urges us to re-read and transform the status quo. But the canon itself is a theatre of memory, composed of preceding images, 'places' and authors that have woven together a mundus imaginalis , a set of ethical standards and cognitive strategies which have been transmitted from generation to genera- tion. The great strength of the canon assembled by Naess lies not merely in its power to colonise and challenge our minds but in its ability to assimilate and mobilise cultural energies which have their source in the cognitive-ethical fabric</page><page sequence="3">59 ARNE NAESS AND THE NORWEGIAN NATURE TRADITION of Norwegian culture. Notwithstanding Naess's own insistence on the influence of Spinoza, Gandhi or Advaita Vedantaon his work, there is an invisible tradition that nourishes deep ecology - invisible by virtue of the mere fact that Naess is so completely immersed in it and so unconsciously in dialogue with it. 'Ideas', as Lord Acton once wrote, 'have a radiation and development, an ancestry and posterity of their own, in which men play the part of godfathers and godmothers more than that of legitimate parents.'4 FROM HÀVAMÀL TO THE PASTORAL ENLIGHTENMENT TO NAESS Central to Naess's ecological work is the notion of the cosmic humility of humankind. The systemic wisdom which represents humans as part of larger wholes sounds novel and 'romantic' but is, of course, quite ancient. It is discernible in most cosmologies, including Western ones. The text of Hâvamâl in the Poetic Edda which, in the case of Norway, may be treated as just such an ancient ecological codex, taught one thing: keep measure, don't over-reach, survival is imperative. As the Jester would later put it in King Lear , 'Have more than thou showest / Speak less than thou knowest.' In Norway the fascinating strategic opportunism of Hâvamâl - one that advocates a precarious equilibrium which avoids intolerable choices and desperate situations - has never been challenged by the Faustian mythos of the over-reacher. The old aristocratic code of suicidal honour, so typical of the sagas, died out with the Viking era and was never resuscitated as a national cultural ideal. It is the pragmatic, plebeian wisdom of Hâvamâl that, over the centuries, was elevated to the national ethos. To a contemporary sensibility educated in hubris, the prescriptions of carefulness, caution and moderation advocated by Hâvamâl sound like an uninspiring catechism of mediocrity. So too does Naess's Green Utopia. (So too does contemporary Norway, as some prejudiced observers insist.) The central injunction implicit in Hâvamâl: 'Thou shalt not think (or show) thou art anybody special' , is enlarged in Naess to read 'We human beings should not think that we are all too special in the universe'. In the Edda , we recall, this principle applies even to gods who have to pay for any excess of wisdom (Odin), beauty and goodness (Balder) or vitality (Thor). There is a remarkable continuity in this pattern of thought, an absence of those leaps and lacunas which would fracture or re-orient the ancient template. The distance between Hâvamâl and Naess is nothing like the distance between, say Beowulf and Sir Alfred Ayer. It is as if in the Norwegian case the values of moderation and respect for the elements that have been incubating for centuries were simply re-canonised by Naess -and with them, the pragmatic tradition that gives priority to action over the word, experience over fixed principle, practice over theory. Utterances like 'the</page><page sequence="4">60 NINA WITOSZEK smaller we come to feel ourselves compared to the mountain, the nearer we come to participate in its greatness' are merely rhetorical adornments of an old wisdom designed to keep humans in their right place in the order of things.5 So too the semi- Words worthian kinship with Nature - '[f]rom about the age of eight a definite mountain became for me a symbol of a benevolent, equal-minded, strong 'father', or of an ideal human nature'6 - bears a particular cultural stamp. It articulates both an atavistic idea of nature as ancestral (in a literal rather than religious sense), and announces that undersocialised Norwegian self that prefers the simple relation to a cowslip to the necessarily intricate and fraught relation to a parent. The Hâvamãlian, slightly a-social, common-sense pragmatism which under- lies Naess' s renowned inconsistency, is part of a culture that has been challenged less by other tribes and other scribes and more by the harshness of the elements. It bespeaks values that are resilient under stress and which, when it comes to Naess's most radical propositions, are qualified by the rhetorical adjunct 'in principle'. The 'in principle' clause inserted into the programmatic article on biospherical egalitarianism, for example, is justified on the grounds that 'any realistic praxis necessitates some killing, exploitation and suppression'.7 Con- cessions are unavoidable, dogmas are ductile, principles and practice diverge. That explains why, after thirty years of his deep ecological Odyssey, it is still unclear how far Naess would go in demanding radical change from societies and individuals whose concerns about the environment are non-existent or based on 'shallow' perceptions. The radical interpretation of deep ecological premises implies that 'change' will necessitate a rejection of the liberal constitution through non-violent action and construction of a new society based on a biocentric world view. The reformist interpretation, on the other hand, reduces deep ecology to a 'therapeutic philosophy' attempting, within the existing political system, to raise people's consciousness in order to transform their ego- oriented self-realisation into a proper, ecosophic one. Naess tends to tackle the problem contextually. If, in a discussion, one inquires about the reformist interpretation, the reply is that Deep Ecology is not a 'reform movement' . If, on the other hand, one criticises the radical orientation, Naess retorts that deep ecology is by no means radical in a fundamentalist or totalitarian sense.8 What looks like the strategy of a proverbial liberal, i.e. a man who cannot take his side in a debate, is, in fact, a gesture of pragmatic adjustment. For Naess, meaning is not a stagnant property inherent in an idea. Meaning happens to an idea which most feel to be right: it becomes true, is made true by events. Ultimately it is philosophising-as-action that counts for Naess, a perpetual struggle of intelligent organisms to solve the problems created by their interaction with their natural environment. There is one further element of the ancient semiosphere which has percolated into Naess' s vision: Nordic eschatology. In Voluspa , which foretells the moral</page><page sequence="5">61 ARNE NAESS AND THE NORWEGIAN NATURE TRADITION degeneration and the inevitable end of the world of gods and men, the Ragnarok is to be followed by rebirth. A green world and a more benign race will populate the globe: I see green again with growing things the earth arise from out of the sea; fell torrents flow, overflies them the eagle on hoar highlands which hunts for fish. [....] On unsown acres the ears will grow all ill grow better; will Baldr come then. U.] 1 see a hall than the sun more fair, thatched with red gold, which is Gimlé hight. There will the gods all guiltless throne and live forever in ease and bliss.9 Naess's version of this doomsday optimism is to be found in his 'Deep Ecology for the Twenty Second Century'.10 As has been argued by Anker, though Naess declares himself a futurological optimist, he takes for granted that humankind has to go through a cathartic rite de passage first. Out of Naess's five extrapo- lations to the future ecological (dis)order, four are apocalyptic, envisioning breakdown and chaos followed by some form of ecological authoritarianism to impose order and stability. In short, Naess's predictions are all based on Voluspian optimism, one that envisions a hundred evil years before a new humankind is restored. Just as it is erroneous to translate Naess's Deep Ecology into dogmatic or hierophantic terms (a tendency in American interpretations), so it misses the point to see him as an heir to European romanticism and the religion of nature. For the German and English Romantics, nature was imbued with meaning because it resonated with the selfhood of the poet or philosopher. Such meaning in turn reflected the glory of the numinous and the divinity of world spirit. Not for Naess. In spite of his occasional references to a Greater Self, Naess's vision is a continuation of the Enlightenment agenda: Why should this philosophy [Kantianism] apply only to human beings? Are there no other beings with intrinsic value? What about animals, plants, landscapes, and our very special old planet as a whole?11 Shining through such declarations is not the sublime romanticism of Schiller or Emerson but the rationalist optimism of the Norwegian Enlightenment as it was practised and preached by eighteenth and nineteenth century pastors. Naess's 'Eight Points of Deep Ecology' read like an anti-manifesto, resting as they do on rational rather than inflammatory propositions. His rhetoric eschews romantic</page><page sequence="6">62 NINA WITOSZEK affectation: The universe is my universe, not my ego's but that of the great Self we have in common. This is metaphysics, but through philosophical research it can be developed in the direction of clarity and cognitive responsibility/12 In tune with the Enlightenment pastors, for whom rivers had tongues and the land was endowed with breasts and shoulders, Naess sees no discrepancy between rationalism and anthropomorphism. Characteristically, he attempts to rehabilitate the anthropomorphic imagination not on romantic-mystical, but on functionalist grounds. For him, the expression 'the life of the river' is useful because it 'may be introduced in a scientific text by using the terminology of ecosystemics'. Similarly the slogan '"let the river live" has had an important function in situations of social conflict'.13 Clearly for Naess, being a pragmatist is not just a way of practising philosophy and staying cheerful. It is part of that heritage of an optimistic and pre-technological enlightenment in which he is immersed and on which he continues to draw. Just as his native intellectual predecessors Martin Schweigaard and Niels Treschow, Naess stays ironically aware, even dismissive, of academicism and the pedantic abstractions of philosophy. The ancient Norwegian imperative to excoriate elitism and to privilege an egalitarian populist self reasserts itself again and again in his work and public statements. So does the emphasis on practical action - a result of a peculiarly Norwegian obsession with the usefulness of art and philosophy. Hence 'those who subscribe to the foregoing points have an obligation, directly or indirectly, to participate in the attempt to implement the necessary changes'.14 Like Spinoza (but also like leading eighteenth and nineteenth century Norwegian writers, scientists and philosophers such as Ludvig Holberg, Hans Str0m and Niels Treschow), Naess seems to assume that the natural solution to any crisis, including the environmental one, is, in principle, discoverable by anyone, anywhere and in any circumstances. If it has not been discovered, it must be due to immaturity, the clouding of reason or perhaps bad luck: The rational solution of value conflicts is not something that is impossible to achieve... 1 take it therefore to be an empirically testable hypothesis that the attainment of well- rounded human maturity leads to identification with all life forms in a wide sense of 'life' and including the acknowledgement of the intrinsic values of all of these forms.15 There is a puzzle here. What seems at first sight like a Utopian dimension to Naess' s thought turns out to be a projection of the native le bon sens into a rescue package for environmentally exhausted civilisation. The philosopher who has demanded: 'Will the Defenders of Deep Ecology Please Rise?' speaks from a country in which the assertion of the inalienable right of the individual has constituted an almost unbroken tradition. It is a world in which the relative</page><page sequence="7">63 ARNE NAESS AND THE NORWEGIAN NATURE TRADITION absence of urban culture, of reifying bureaucracy and wasteful aristocracy, of devastating wars and ethnic collisions could not but hatch some version of a philosophy which went beyond the human. The old Nordic imperative of n0ysomhet, that untranslatable term which means contentedness in frugal but adequate circumstances, hardly needed to be invented or rediscovered. The older generation of Norwegians, for example, remembers a world in which parsimony and the ideal of Spartan austerity were synonymous with good citizenship. In some respects, deep ecology may be seen as possible and affordable due to a benign cultural blindness to the intractability and insolubility of conflicts in other semiospheres. In Norway the suppression of needs and the imaginative exten- sion of individual worth and rights to all species are only partially innovatory ideas; fundamentally, they belong to an enduring indigenous tradition which emphasised the cult of virtuous simplicity and, well into the 1980s, opposed a materialistic concept of human felicity. Naess's vision is not a rootless abstrac- tion, self-begotten and self-sustaining, severed from culture and history in the way other utopias have attempted to be. With deep ecology, Naess proffers an expanded version of values of the Norwegian rural Enlightenment to the rest of the globe. It is this successful, rationalist-democratic worldview, one that was allowed to flourish in a culture largely spared the experience of social debasement and bestiality, which goes some way to explain the terrible beauty of deep ecology. When queried in the course of an interview as to the possible dangerous implications of a philosophy based on identification with the whole, Naess replied with his usual insouciance: 'Everything really important is dangerous, so that's OK.'16 When pressed, however, he clearly opposed his philosophy to vitalism: I see unconditional 'cult of life' as being unethical. It is that strand that led in part to Nazism: You read nature in a certain way. You see the lions and their prey. You analogise to humans, a hierarchy emerges, with systems, totems of power. You begin to say yes to brutality, yes to exploitation. And among the humans, yes to sadism. One must be very careful, then, if one is to use 'Life!' as the center of an ethic.17 These remarks reveal Naess' s acute awareness of the problems intrinsic to a holistic approach. Still the belief that 'Self-realisation!' will be a sufficient warrant against totalitarian excesses springs from a culturally privileged faith in the peaceful coexistence of diverse species and the rational consensus-orientated dialogue between humans. It is difficult to imagine deep ecology being born in a latitude further south than Copenhagen: its discourse and its world view is, on the whole, rather wintery , unresponsive to the power of passion, the metaphysics of evil and the lure of eroticism. Ultimately, it rests on a belief in a cosmic whole where every organism, from the King to your local friendly wolf is a good, self- restrained Protestant citizen.</page><page sequence="8">64 NINA WITOSZEK CULTURAL 'RADICALISM' AND THE METAPHYSICS OF AUTHENTICITY Cultural radicalism is a fetish phrase in the Norwegian history of ideas. Jon Elster, among others, has propounded the following definition: Cultural radicalism is a political and intellectual attitude. A cultural radical's commitment and indignation border on moralism. In his universe scandal is an important category. The analysis of economic and social causes is not his strong point... His motto has been formulated by Helge Krog: 'If you are in doubt as to which standpoint to adopt vis à vis a concrete cause, choose the one which will harm you most/ A cultural radical lives in the city. He is remote from mass movements on the periphery, be it language or the temperance cause, or low church ideas .... He takes the side of the weak, whether defined economically or culturally .... Cultural radicalism is against Christianity but for women priests ...18 Given the comprehensiveness of this caricature, it is significant that Elster should overlook three important dimensions of radicalism à la norvégienne. Firstly, although this radicalism is rational, intellectual, anti-clerical and anti- bourgeois, it is not the opposite of the eighteenth century provincial religious awakening but its continuation. It is principally a Norwegian bud-dism (from bud = 'commandment'). Elster himself indicates that the deep structure of Norwe- gian counter-culture reveals manicheism, moralism, fervent search for the truth and the ethics of social commitment - and these were the chief predilections of the eighteenth century priests. Secondly, cultural radicalism in Norway invokes, to a very large degree, nature as part of a ritual of resistance to bourgeois elitism or capitalist techno-worship. It is reactionary in spite of its 'revolutionary' pretensions. It appeals to values which have been central to Norwegian culture for a very long time: the ideal of egalitarian solidarity, the drive towards social betterment, democratic individualism and the basically rationalist modus operandi. These values are hardly either 'revolutionary' or new. What is new from the end of the nineteenth century on, is the obsessive, almost religious search for authenticity propelled by the shock of urban theatrics. The rejection of the social mask and a resultant 'truth pilgrimage' has been central to Norwegian writing from Ibsen, Bj0rnson and Hamsun to the socialist and Maoist apostles of the 1960s and 1970s. The great appeal of psychoanalysis and Marxism in Norway, if not in all of Scandinavia, had less to do with their revolutionary potential and more with their availability as techniques to unmask the social lie spawned by a nascent urban culture. Det er bedre a snakke sant enn à snakke pent , goes a Norwegian motto ('It's better to talk truthfully than to talk beautifully'). If for Voltaire telling the truth was imperative only when one could not avoid it, for Norwegian writers and intellectuals truth telling has always been a cardinal commandment. For Ibsen, if truth and God had been separated, he would have</page><page sequence="9">65 ARNE NAESS AND THE NORWEGIAN NATURE TRADITION chosen the truth. For socialist writers of the interwar period Hoel and Krogh, 'the free writer has one and only one task: to tell the truth as he sees it, however uncomfortable it is' .,9 The notion of society with its role-driven and role-ridden character, has always seemed false to the eco-existentialist on his way to the mountains. Freedom, liberty, equality, fraternity, justice and natural rights - interpreted not as bourgeois ideas (as, say, in France) or aristocratic virtues (as in Poland) - have been mythologised into the original mores of the peasantry. Bourgeois freedom has been synonymous with 'free trade, free selling and free buying' to use Marx's phrase.20 Hence rebellion in the name of freedom and truth has always been rebellion in the name of nature. 'Feeling apart in many human relations, I identified with nature', confesses Naess - thus allying himself with the native ventas tradition.21 The endless search for the naked, authentic individual with original opinions, free from cliches and received phraseology, has been part of both Naess' s philosophy of nature and of language. His early study of Truth as conceived by Those who are not Professional Philosophers , is a typical example of the cultural radicalism of the '30s, a search for the peoples' rather than the philosophers' truth.22 It is also an anarchic counter-cultural lampoon of the pomposity of high science. Naess' s progress thereafter has had a certain logical momentum to it - out of the entrapments of language and into the authenticity of nature. In some respects Naess 's deep ecology is a resolution of, and a therapy for, the cultural neuroses that troubled Ibsen, Hamsun, Sandemose and countless other sensitive Norwe- gian souls. Typically, Naess 's radicalism of the truth is scarcely related to revolutionary radicalism in any of its usual forms. Fundamentally, it is a spectral radicalism that mimics the pragmatic strategies of the Norwegian prolonged enlightenment. Here is Arne Naess on this theme: Reform or revolution? I envisage a change of revolutionary depth and size by means of many smaller steps in a radically new direction. This essentially makes me belong to the political reformists, I suppose? Scarcely. The direction is revolutions, the steps are reformatory.23 This, of course, should be nothing new to Naess's compatriots: it sounds like a summa sumárum of Norwegian radical-conservative politics up to the present. What redeems Naess' s re-statement of the Norwegian tao with its fixation on the truth, the right way, the ethics of responsibility, commitment and struggle, is his ludic, sceptical intelligence. In a conversation with the British philosopher, Sir Alfred Ayer, Naess regretted his paradoxical, detached commitment: T am sorry to say, in some ways I feel miserable to be defending scepticism now, because there is a very tragic conflict between the attitude I hold in my integrated and concentrated moments, which is more or less sceptical, and the requirements of consistent action. For instance, when we believe that we really must do</page><page sequence="10">66 NINA WITOSZEK something about some terribly pressing problem, we must somehow narrow our perspective.'24 Though it may be a deeply felt conviction, consistency is, for Naess, as for Oscar Wilde, ultimately the last refuge of the unimaginative. Ultimately, Naess' s exasperating plasticity points again to a pragmatic strategy of intellectual compromise, of fighting for a truth in the sense defined by Rorty : as something 'good to believe in' rather than something that has a transcendental status. NAESSIANIC PREDECESSORS AND INTERLOCUTORS The international influences on Naess's work are well defined and have been relatively well explored: Spinoza, Gandhi and, of course, Socrates (Naess' s proclaimed Socratic ambition is to be a 'respectable pest'). Naess's principle of 'Self-realisation !' can be taken as inspired by the Hindu philosophy of the Greater Self - or as an extension of Marx's anticipation of a future in which '[i]n place of the old bourgeois society, with its class antagonisms, we shall have an association in which free development of each is the condition for the free development of all'.25 Similarly Naess's conception of the good life and his own modus vivendi brine to mind the early Marx who imagined a life in which it was 'possible for me to do one thing today and another tomorrow, to hunt in the morning, fish in the afternoon, rear cattle in the evening, criticise (philosophise) after dinner, just as I have a mind, without ever becoming hunter, fisherman, shepherd, or critic'.26 But there have been other influences at work. Peter Reed and David Rothenberg, in the course of their compendium of native inspiration in Naess, mention such contemporary Norwegian philosophers and activists as Peter Wessel Zapffe, Nils Faarlund and Sigmund Kval0y.27 To these we might like to add a number of less obvious, but perhaps more significant, predecessors such as the eighteenth and nineteenth century thinker and philosopher Niels Trescho w. Holism was an intrinsic dimension of his vision, which was also marked by an empirical bias uncontaminated by abstract speculation. With the significant exception of the work of Monrad, most Norwegian intellectual tradition of the eighteenth and nineteenth century emphasised the primacy of experience and a belief in the possibility of uniting democracy and science. All the furnishings of Treschow's philosophy - the monist inspiration of Spinoza and Leibniz, the attempt to 'improve' on Kant's pure reason by inserting an empirical corrective, the socialist leanings, and the precursory evolutionism - are, from another perspective, a systématisation and further development of a native 'eco-human- ism'. Central to Treschow's vision is the idea of 'self-realisation' (called by Treschow Fuldkommelsesdrift). All nature - both organic and non-organic - is typified by a drive towards the realisation of its individuality. The process of self-</page><page sequence="11">67 ARNE NAESS AND THE NORWEGIAN NATURE TRADITION fulfilment is directed from an indivisible centre, or 'Middle Point', which ensures that 'any single form and any individual creature approaches its fulfilment in the way prescribed by Nature'.28 Individuum est ineffabile , and its suppression is the suppression of the richness and diversity of life. The charac- teristic melange of holism and individualism which figures so strongly in Treschow (and indeed in most eighteenth and nineteenth century strains of Norwegian thought), is also to be found in Naess's philosophy: There are two sorts of mysticism: in one of them you get completely absorbed in something much bigger than you, an organic whole or God, but on the other hand there is the mysticism you find in Spinoza, which tries to retain, after all has passed, the individual.29 Though it would be too much to call Treschow a 'prototypal Naess', many of the Leitmotifs of his nature philosophy animate Naess's deep ecological thinking. Ultimately, however, both Treschow' s and Naess's ideas build on the ancient wisdom as recorded in Snorre' s Edda: a belief that 'all is originally One' , a strong sense of realism, and an assessment of reality through the prism of common sense and human experience: Almighty God created heaven and earth and all things in them, and lastly two humans from whom generations are descended .... He also gave them a portion of wisdom so that they could understand all earthly things and the details of everything they could see in the sky and on earth. They pondered and were amazed at what it could mean that the earth and animals and birds had common characteristics in some things ... Rocks and stones they thought of as equivalent to teeth and bones of living creatures. From this they reasoned that the earth was alive and had life after a certain fashion, and they realised it was enormously old in count of years and mighty in nature.30 There is finally Henrik Wergeland, the only true Romantic among the nineteenth century Norwegian preachers of nature andiiation. But it is less the romantic, demiurgic Wergeland, and more Wergeland the Enlightenment prank- ster and reformer, who can be rediscovered in Naess's thinking about humans and nature. The Wergelandian ecstatic identification with all beings - T who read rapture in each petal of the hundred leaved rose'31 - is given a more rationalist twist by Naess: Given our biological endowment, each of us has the capacity to identify with all living beings... humans have the capacity to experience the intimate relations between organisms and the inorganic world - that is, between the biosphere and the ecosphere in general.32 Among more contemporary interlocutors, the most significant has undoubt- edly been Peter Wessel Zapffe: Naess's philosophical opponent. There are, we might say, two schools of thinking about Nature in the Norwegian cultural</page><page sequence="12">68 NINA WITOSZEK tradition exemplified, respectively, by Zapffe and Naess. The Naessian strain represents a culmination of Enlightenment optimism and rationalism combined with the folk tradition of Askeladdian resourcefulness and pragmatism. The second, more iconoclastic strain, figures in the work of Hamsun, Vigeland and Zapffe. At its centre there is Nature conceived as sacrum , an incomprehensible, immoral God, awesome in its beauty and merciless in its mindless cruelty. If in the vision of the Norwegian Enlightenment there is less religion and more reason, in the apocalyptic school, religion (in its original pre-Christian sense) plays an enormous part. Here Nature is God and, in the case of Zapffe, a dying God. Tt shows neither morality nor reason; its degeneration is inevitable and nothing, not even man's most glamorous achievements, can escape final anni- hilation.'33 For Zapffe, the human demand for meaning in a meaningless universe heading for an inevitable Ragnarok is the source of life-as-tragedy. No other existential genres are possible. Human beings are a destructive environmental element' whose hapless role is to hasten the death of God. In his more torrid moments, Zapffe could see himself as a negative, ecological Christ, a 'man who has grasped life in its cosmic context, and whose agony is the agony of the world'.34 Per contra, at the centre of Naess's deep ecology is a benign, rationally based hope, articulated in deep questions which curiously refuse to come to terms with the mystery of what it is to be human. In Zapffe's ecology, deep questions, when asked, unveil the cosmic rapaciousness of man and the awesome mortality of nature. Zapffean philosophy goes beyond the Nietzschean 'Dare to lead the tragic life, and you will be redeemed',35 for it reaches to a bottomless void from which there is no exit. NATURE vs CULTURE Irrespective of postmodern unmaskings of the cultural creation of nature, the agon between nature and culture has remained an enduring refrain in Norwegian texts until this very day. Its ultimate articulation is Norwegian ecophilosophical thought which, far from being anti-intellectual is, more or less unambiguously, anti -Kultur and anti -Zivilisation in orientation.36 From the eighteenth century pastors and on to Ibsen, Hamsun and contemporary kulturradikaler , Culture - conflated with a 'high' culture of useless splendours and excesses - has been deprecated in Norway as a product of inhuman, mostly foreign, agencies and institutions. Hamsun, who always wanted to die 'on the cowberry bog' (a d0 paa den Tyttebaersmue) believed in the authority and wisdom of the forest and simple folk.37 As late as the 1 980s the philosopher of outdoor life, Nils Faarlund, indicated an explicit conflict: 'I prefer not to speak about man and culture but</page><page sequence="13">69 ARNE NAESS AND THE NORWEGIAN NATURE TRADITION instead of nature and culture... and our present culture is on a collision course with nature.'38 Yet another Norwegian friluftsliv philosopher, Gunnar Breivik, makes an egalitarian claim which is so outrageous as to be only Norwegian: 'Hunting and trapping are equally good expressions of the relationship with nature as Grieg's music and Wergeland's poems.'39 The most radical nature philosopher, Sigmund Kval0y, has gone so far in his holy biocentric wrath as to oppose an ecophilosopher to a European: Ecophilosophy has become with us unmistakably Norwegian. In contrast to the urban, European, recreational perception of nature reserved for the upper classes. Norwegians have viewed closeness to nature as life necessity.40 Arne Naess has consistently derided such radical - if not fundamentalist - declarations. And yet, however we take it, his vision of Norway in 2084 alluded to above signals an implicit scepticism with regard to both science and civilisa- tion. High Culture, with its ideals based on elitist hierarchy and anthropocentric values, is part of a hubris scenario and therefore a nuisance in the deep ecological vision.41 Science - not a very salient factor in the Green Utopia - has been addressed by Naess in a separate work launching such commandments as 'use imagination', 'leave nature alone', 'find alternative ways', 'serve people!'42 The appeal of this anti-Kultur attitude can be traced back to long centuries of at-homeness in nature and an exaggerated feeling of the threat posed by the polis. The Spartan impulse which inspired nineteenth century cultural national- ists to preach a way of life both simple and austere enough to make the agropolis genuinely self-sufficient, has never really died out in Norway. At the beginning of the nineteenth century Jacob Aall, the iron-master, complained bitterly of the contempt with which wealth was regarded by a large section of the Norwegian Parliament.43 Naess's ideal, based as it is on a dream of an autarchic pastoral republic where small is beautiful and poor is dutiful, promulgates the old tradition. 'We shall not be members of a rich man's club',44 is the battle cry of his protest against membership of the European Union. Though Naess himself would not want to own anything that would not fit in his coffin (or urn), his is a privileged, Midassian renunciation of all the gold (i.e. oil) which surrounds him. If it has been inspiring (in the sense of Norway's not joining the 'rich man's club'), it is because it still resonates with a culture in which the old ideal of an austere, authentic and independent existence remains part of the Norwegian Dream. The dream has been summoned and amplified in the books and deeds of successive generations. Ultimately, there is little to separate Naess's utopia of Norway in 2084 and Ludvig Holberg's subterranean state of Totu', imagined in 1741 : 45 In the latter, the Norwegian bom dramatist depicted a society of thinking trees, an enlightened state with an almost unlimited freedom òf expression, immune from dogmas, spurning wealth, practising deistic nature religion and full equality between all</page><page sequence="14">70 NINA WITOSZEK inhabitants of both sexes. In Potu disputants were kept for public amusement, like game-cocks, and doctors of philosophy were called Maditcs , the English equivalent of which is 'worms'. But above all, no one could become a professor who had not held some practical position. Even if Naess never read Holberg, his personal life philosophy ultimately re- enacts the Holbergian ideal. According to the latter, the individual should 'have only provisional opinions, whereby he should keep one door always open for a willingness to learn, for instruction, and for the truth that may follow'.46 NOTES 1 Arne Naess, łThe Green Utopia of 2084' , unpublished paper presented at the University of Minnesota in 1984. 2 Ibid., pp. 8-13. 3 Peter Reed and David Rothenberg, Wisdom of the Open Air : The Norwegian Roots of Deep Ecology (Minneapolis: University of Minnesota Press, 1993). 4 Letters of Lord Acton to Herbert Gladstone , ed.

Inquiry 16 (1973), pp. 95-6. 8 To be more specific: During a debate with Karl Otto Apel on 18 July 1990 in Melbu. Norway, Naess rejected the radical interpretation in favour of the reformist one. Sometime later, however, in a lecture at the Center for Development and the Environment at Oslo University (on 1 7 September 1 99 1 ), he strongly emphasised that the deep ecology movement was a radical movement, not a reformist one.
