<plain_text><page sequence="1">PLOTINUS AND THE GNOSTICS BY JOSEPH KATZ Plotinus' essay against the Gnostics (Ennead II ix) 1 has often been commented upon. Due acknowledgment has been made of the polemical sharpness with which Plotinus attacked what he regarded as the arrogant myth-making and the dialectical imprecision of the Gnostics. But a much more important fact seems to have escaped the interpreters. For it is amazing that almost all of the ideas that Plotinus finds objectionable in the Gnostics have been asserted by himself too in one form or another. The polemic against the Gnostics, consequently, turns out to reveal a vital ten- sion in Plotinus' own system, rather than a mere external differentiation of his doctrines from others. To see Plotinus as in some sense a Gnostic manque is to discover an important aspect of his many-faceted philosophy. In the essay against the Gnostics Plotinus, who usually is very restrained, permits himself a large amount of emotive invective. This too suggests that we are touching upon a vital nerve of Plotinus' thought. The avowed purpose of the essay against the Gnostics is to oppose those who assert that the world of sense or its originating source are evil. Ploti- nus declares that whatever the deficiencies of the world of sense, it is a copy of the intelligible world and thus exhibits the order and beauty ap- propriate to it. It is the best possible world, given its inevitable spatial and temporal character. Plotinus even goes so far-and it is going far for a Platonist-as to say that surely those who have had the experience of intelligible beauty and harmony will not fail to be touched by their sensu- ous copies. " Would any musician who had once heard the intelligible har- monies not also be moved by those of sense? "2 Plotinus even permits himself, something exceedingly rare in him, a moralistic censure, reproach- ing the Gnostics with unconcern for virtue and declaring solemnly that 1 The title of the essay as given in sections 5 and 16 of Porphyry's Life of Ploti- nus is "Against the Gnostics." In section 24 it is " Against those who say that the maker of the world is evil and that the world is evil." The titles are not due to Plotinus and in the body of the essay neither the names of particular thinkers nor the generic name " Gnostics " occur. In section 10 Plotinus refers to " friends who had come across these doctrines [the doctrines attacked in Enn. II ix] before be- coming friends of ours and who, I do not know how, still persevere in them." The brevity of Plotinus' statement of the doctrines he attacks and the incompleteness of our sources make it very difficult to determine which specific men Plotinus had in mind. Given the nature of Plotinus' problem in Enn. II ix it will be permissible in this article to use the term " Gnostics " in a generic sense-and it may well have had just such generic significance for Plotinus too. For a discussion of the problem which specific men and doctrines Plotinus may have had in mind, see Carl Schmidt, Plotins Stellung zum Gnosticismus und kirch- lichen Christentum, Texte und Untersuchungen zur Geschichte der altchristlichen Literatur, new series, vol. 5, fasc. 4 (Leipzig, 1901), especially pp. 13ff., 30ff., 48ff., 82ff. 2 Enn.

Plotinus argues at some length against the notion of a " fall." 9 In part his argument deals with an issue on which he has been uncompromising: an eternalistic conception of existence which regards novelty as an imputation of potentiality and hence imperfection to the high- est source of things.10 But there are other imperfections which according to Plotinus the notion of a "fall" introduces into the intelligible world, such as an anthropomorphic desire for honor, or deliberative reasoning." In general, the notion of the fall of the psyche seems self-contradictory, given the perfectionist definition of the psyche and the absence of body, the prime source of limitation, in the intelligible world. Indeed, Plotinus occasionally speaks as if he thought that it is not the psyche itself, but only a reflection of it caught in matter, that we find in the sense world and that constitutes the composite of psyche and body called man.'2 But this asser- tion does not represent Plotinus' usual position. His usual view is that the psyche is a member at once of this world and of the intelligible world. Even in the essay against the Gnostics he does not forsake it, even though it weakens his argument. For he can now ascribe only to the universal soul, not to individual souls, the capacity of fulfilling the cosmological function of administering the body of the world without directly descending into it.13 But this assertion, obviously, hardly solves the problem, but only shifts it somewhat. For if it exempts the universal soul from the " fall," it does not do so for the individual souls. At first, even on this issue Plotinus is not without resources to bar a too 3 Enn.

See also St. Augustine De civitate Dei X. 31, where St. Augustine objects to the notion of an eternal pre-existence of the soul on the ground that change in or of the soul, admitted by Neoplatonists, contradicts the eternalist thesis. See also X. 30 where he shows the difficulty of maintaining the Neoplatonist thesis of the fall (or of the transmigration) of a soul conceived as pre-existent on a superior level of reality. 11 Enn.

In some contexts this conception too finds explicit statement. The fall of the soul is then derived from dis- content and overbearing. Her fall is a withdrawal from the whole into an individualistic separateness.l7 The fall is a self-assertion. Plotinus even goes so far as to declare on occasion that the fall stems from the soul's " arrogance."18 These passages illustrate well how close Plotinus, too, is to " acosmism," how he is willing to violate cosmological order, and dia- lectical rigor, for the sake of a drama of rebellion and redemption. Plotinus strongly objects to the Gnostics' insistence on their specially- privileged place in the universe, their insistence on being the children of god, better than other men and deities.19 There is a rationalistic and a socio- logical aspect to his argument. He is irked that "men without station," members of the " vulgar crowd," should claim such distinction, and more emphatically, that the way to salvation should flagrantly bypass dialectic and the stern intellectual and moral discipline it requires.20 But these reser- vations do not imply immunity to the serpent's temptation: eritis sicut Deus. In Plotinus' system too identification with the One is the ultimate goal of human endeavor. The self in its upward flight does not stop at the level of nous in a mere contemplation of the highest existence-as do the redeemed in Christianity. Plotinus too holds something like the Gnostic notion of the divine spark when he says, in more Aristotelian language, that ascent to and union with the One means the reawakening of the psyche's potentialities,21 or when he declares that the supreme part of the psyche is forever united with the One.22 Plotinus' " acosmism " is of course more mitigated than the Gnostics'. According to Gnostic doctrine, this world is the product of an evil demiurge, and men of the divine pneuma owe no allegiance either to this creator god or to his world.23 Plotinus finds it particularly objectionable in this doctrine 14 Pato Phaedrus 246c, Enn.

Often there is an attempt to minimize the flaw that initially in- heres in the psyche and also to shift at least part of the responsibility upon the obtruding presence of a body. See Enn. III ii 4. Such passages betray Plotinus' uneasiness with the more Gnostic implications of his thought. 19 Enn. II ix 9, 16, 18. 20 Enn. II ix 9. e1 Enn. VI ix 1I, IV viii 1. 22 Enn. II ix 2. 2S Cf. Enn.

According to Plotinus, the sun and the stars possess not only immortality, but a wisdom and a freedom from passion superior to those of men born only recently and subject to lust, pain, and the fits of temper.24 A striking vindication, even a glorification, of the world of sense occurs in Ennead III viii, which Plotinus puts in the form of a hypothetical speech by the cosmos itself: I was made by god and as I stem from the realm beyond, I am perfect con- taining all living things. I am self-sufficient and independent, in want of nothing, because in me there is everything, all plants, animals, all that is born, the plurality of gods, the tribes of demons, excellent souls, and men happy through the quality of their life. The earth is not alone adorned by the whole gamut of plants and all the varieties of animals, nor does the power of the soul extend to the sea omitting the air, ether, or heaven; but there are found beyond the earth souls, and excellent souls only, which give life to the stars and to the well-ordered and eternal round of heaven that in imitation of the intelligible world wisely describes a circular path around the same center forever, without the need for deviation. All things that exist within me aspire towards the Good, but each realizes it according to its capacity; for the whole heaven depends on it, all that I possess of soul, the gods that exist in my parts, all animals, plants, and all that is in appearance inanimate. The latter seem to participate in existence alone, of the others some participate in life alone, some also possess sensation, some even reason, and some universal life. For one must not ask that unequals be equal. One must not ask of a finger to see, but of the eye. Of the finger one must ask, I suppose, to fulfill its proper function of a finger.25 What Plotinus says in such contexts implies no special exaltation of man. It seems only a short step to the Stoics' submission to nature or even to Aristotle's notion of mortal man reaching only a temporary immortality in the study of the eternal patterns of nature. No notion of man's super- natural character seems to break in to require the union of two incom- mensurable orders of existence. But such subordination of the psyche holds for Plotinus only when he views it in its state of association with the body, or in its cosmological func- tion as a hypostasis mediating between the intelligible and the sensible worlds. Ultimately, for Plotinus too, the psyche transcends both the sensi- ble and the intelligible worlds.26 It leaves behind sun, stars, and the other divinities.27 Plotinus' conception of man never reaches the boldness of the Gnostic conception of man the redeemer, but neither does it rest content to assign man the function of a " part " in a universal whole. Union with the One is as all-devouring ontologically as solipsism is epistemologically. Be it noted, moreover, that ascent is accomplished neither by grace nor prayer, but through the adoption of Plotinian philosophy. 24 Enn. II ix 5, 13. 25 Enn. III ii 3; cf. II ix 8. 26Enn. VI ix 11, IV viii 1. When united with the One, the psyche "is raised above all the other intelligible beings." 27Plotinus maintains the existence of deities, but they are to him of inferior rank than the One. The plurality of gods exhibits the abundant power of the One (Enn. II ix 9).</page><page sequence="5">PLOTINUS AND THE GNOSTICS 293 There seems to be one respect in which Plotinus is profoundly different from the Gnostics, and that is in his painstakingly rationalistic way of arguing. At the very beginning of his essay against the Gnostics28 he charges the Gnostics with needlessly multiplying the number of hypostases. What he has in mind is the multiplicity of entities, half-conceptual and half- mythical, that spring from the fertile Gnostic imagination. To Plotinus the dramatic evolution of the Gnostic world destroys the perfection of the One by introducing potentiality into it.29 Similarly, to Plotinus the Gnostic division of nous into an intelligence at rest and an intelligence in motion, or into thought and awareness of thought, seems to ignore the capacity for interpenetration and unification that immaterial existence possesses and to lead to an infinite regress (awareness of awareness of thought becomes a superior hypostasis and so forth).30 These arguments are representative of Plotinus' approach in general. A disciplined logic underlies Plotinus' method. He himself is quite aware of this when he charges the Gnostic constructions with not being " Greek." 31 Nevertheless, Plotinus cannot be called a rationalist without major reser- vations. For Plotinus' system too rests on myth. He is, of course, unaware of this, and on the surface pushes rationalism so far that he will usually accept the traditional Greek myths only on the assumption that they are metaphorical, and in particular always translates their temporal form into his eternalistic concepts. The break in Plotinus between a rationalist method and a mythical background is discernible at a juncture in his system that, on the surface, seems to furnish a model of consistency: the relation- ship of the One to nous. In Plotinus' system, nous generated by the One is the first reflection of ultimate simplicity. On the level of nous the One's richness splits up into manifoldness, but as the realm of nous is immaterial, its multiplicity is compatible with togetherness and eternity. Nevertheless, the apparent smoothness of the transition from the One to nous is one of the triumphs of Plotinian dialectic. It hides the conflict between the rationalist method and the mythical background. As one might expect, discussions of nous imply the former, discussions of the One imply the latter; but the division is not really clear-cut, since the conception of nous is not without a rather full share of myth (as, for instance, in the identification of nous and Being), and since much logic enters into the definition of the One (as, for instance, in deriving some of the logical implications of unity). Plotinus' discussions of nous are often a more or less hypostatized de- scription of the rationalist approach. Most characteristically this is asserted 28 Enn. II ix 1. 29 Enn. II ix 1, 6. 30 Enn. II ix 1. 31 Enn. II ix 6. Plotinus is nevertheless led to remark that the Gnostics with an appearance of justice derive some of their doctrines from Plato (Enn. II ix 6, 17). He might have added other Greek sources, particularly the Pythagoreans. But rather than admit the "impurity" of the Greek tradition, Plotinus prefers to charge the Gnostics with an impure interpretation. When he charges the Gnostics with unfitting elaborations of the ancient doctrines and when he speaks of the "deceit" capturing mankind, one gets a good idea of the bitterness with which Plotinus faced not only the Gnostics, but also, in all likelihood, Christianity.</page><page sequence="6">294 JOSEPH KATZ in Ennead III viii, where he declares that not just rational beings, but all nature aspires towards contemplation. "Begetting means to produce some form; and this means to spread contemplation everywhere."32 Practical activity, the mechanical arts are attempts to get hold of ideas and express them in actions or artefacts characteristic of men who cannot more purely hold them in mind.33 "All life is some sort of thought ... The highest life and perfect thought are one and the same thing." 34 In other words, it is in being understood that things reach their fulfilment. For this Plotinus quite properly might claim the "Greek" tradition-with reservations, for how should one term his reification of the intellectual function? Moreover, Plotinus' having all nature subserve the design of contemplative fulfilment- how like the Gnostics it is in its anthropocentric egotism! 35 It is a quite different manner of being and a quite different experience that Plotinus understands under the name of the One. It is so little intel- lectual that Plotinus denies even self-awareness to the One.36 In the de- scription of the One the terms of his system forsake him, and occasionally he even says that the One is not to be called the One 37 or that the Good is not to be called good.38 There are dialectical reasons for this via negativa, given the conception of levels of reality and the view that the proper referent of discursive language is sense existence. But Plotinus has a more definite notion of the One, and forgetting his negative strictures he refers to it in the metaphors of joy,39 of love,40 of light,41 even of intoxication.42 The soul is in such a state then [when unified with the One] that it has contempt even for thought, which before has given it much joy.... Nous must have (1) the power of intelligence which gives it the vision of what is contained in itself and (2) the power of grasping that which is beyond itself by a direct apprehension.... The first vision is that of intellectual nous, the 32Enn. III viii 7. In Plotinus the Trational principles (logoi) of nature are understood at once in an ontic and an epistemic sense. 33 Enn. III viii 4; see also Enn. IV iv 44 where Plotinus asserts that only con- templation is free from the magical influences to which action is necessarily subject. 34 Enn. III viii 8. S5 Nevertheless, Plotinus' identification of nous with Being creates strong am- biguities, even to the point of an anti-intellectualist conception of the intelligible world. Plotinus' usual objection to the notion of providence is that it ascribes de- liberation to the intelligible world, which in his view creates rather by its being what it is (Enn. III ii 3, VI vii 1, II ix 8). In Enn. II ix 2 Plotinus asserts that the world soul governs not "by deliberation," but "by its contemplation of the world above it." The contrast of "deliberation " with " contemplation" mirrors the ambiguity of the identification of nous with Being. Occasionally Plotinus goes so far as to assert the quite modern-sounding idea that knowing, even the knowing of nous, springs from want (for instance, Enn. III viii 11). Plotinus also tends to a conception of consciousness which makes it a product of incomplete absorption in activity (for instance, Enn. I iv 10). 36 Enn. VI ix 6. 37 Enn. V v 6, 13. 38 Enn.

For when nous ceases to be rational and is drunk with nectar, it becomes nous which loves and achieves the unity which gives happiness through its fullness. Such drunkenness is better for it than a sobriety that is above such drunkenness.43 Salvation in the One is very much more than intellectual fulfilment. The metaphors describing the One, the metaphors of the ascent to the Alone, of the fall, of the arrogance and self-assertion of the psyche, of the treacherous black magic of matter,44 all describe a reality that is rich and imaginative. One need only expand what Plotinus says, let the imagination run more freely, give it appropriate expression in rite and acts, and one has full blown Gnosticism. Even as it is, Plotinus' system may be taken as one vast hymn to inex- haustible seminal fertility.45 In his world everything emanates from the highest power by cosmological necessity, and yet this necessity involves it in pain and longing.4" The whole universe is endowed with the qualities of psyche. Not only man but everything longs to return to, even to be ex- tinguished in the One.4T All being constitutes the vast spectacle of bitter necessity and sweet salvation. Moder readers have been puzzled about the existential reference of Plotinus' system. But his system is at least exis- tential in its reference to psychic reality-of course frequently in symbolic rather than literal terms. But Plotinus shrinks from the full implications of his own thought. Something like Gnosticism is implied by half of his thought, and yet he is blind to it to the extent of ignoring that almost all of the ideas he finds objectionable in the Gnostics can nearly be matched by ideas of his own. But he knew the Gnostic temptation from the inside. The very vehemence of his essay against them is one more testimony to the fact that the bitterest battles are always against one's own unacknowledged impulses. It might perhaps be said that Plotinus could have integrated his thought better, had he had at his disposal the Christian distinction between faith and reason or the distinction between non-discursive and discursive symbol- ism. But no mere conceptual distinction would have helped Plotinus48 (as it helped little many Christian thinkers who soon involved their revealed God in the most intricate dialectical contexts or asked pseudo-physical ques- tions about him). Plotinus' integration of the discordant elements in his system was dialectical, and he succeeded at it so well that he might be called 48 Enn. VI vii 35. 44 Enn. IV iv 43, 44. 45 For the extremes to which the Gnostics carried the seminal cult see Epiphanius Panarion 26. There is much of the libidinous in the Gnostic imagination in general. 46 Enn.

VI viii 13. 48Phrases like Porphyry's "the unreasoned and unreasonable faith" (alogos pistis) of the Christians indicate how much such a distinction lay outside the Neo- platonists' orbit in their insistence on at least the form of rational demonstration. They are hence genuinely puzzled by certain characteristic New Testament passages which promise salvation through other mear, than philosophic knowledge.</page><page sequence="8">296 JOSEPH KATZ the master of those who aim at consistency. The often-praised architecture of Plotinus' system is really analogous to a Gothic facade over a modern structure of steel and concrete. The emanation of the One into nous hides a major discrepancy. Again, the third hypostasis, the psyche, comes close to being a superfluous reduplication, and the reconciliation of its cosmologi- cal with its ethical function is hardly possible.4 On the level of sense Plotinus never fully overcomes the discrepancy between a substantial and a privative conception of matter and evil50 (just as St. Augustine never fully shed his Manicheanism). Plotinus' chain of being, on the surface an unbroken continuum of all degrees of power, hides a mass of conflicting tendencies and assumptions. Yet such was Plotinus' dialectical power that even if the post-Enlightenment reader has difficulty finding the existential referents of his thought, some variant of his system has up to the nineteenth century served as the best rational yardstick of reality.51 The preceding discussion also throws some light on the problem of Ploti- nus' mystical experience. Plotinus himself in a few passages seems to lay claim to such an experience.52 Still, he hardly dwells on the experience 49 To Plotinus nous is not only "vision " but also true Being and Life. Hence once nous is endowed with Life, the psyche seems to lose its most specific function and the world of senses could have been derived immediately from nous. There is indeed in Plotinus' system an isomorphism between nous and the sense world. Both contain in their differing ways-the one in immutable and nonmaterial same- ness, the other in space and time-the totality of things. The psyche, if Plotinus were fully consistent, should follow the same pattern of "horizontal" plenitude. Instead the psyche, in one sort of context, has a "vertical" plenitude, being asso- ciated with the various levels of reality. In other contexts it shrinks from this sort of plenitude to a more univocal agent whose function is mediation and which is a mobile being capable of ascent and descent. Either "vertical" plenitude or mobility bring the One within reach of man, that is, of man who has undergone the philosophic discipline. There are other possible implications to the distinction between nous and psyche, such as its standing for the male and female principle respectively, as is suggested, for instance, by the fact that in Plotinus the male deities of traditional myths tend to be identified with nous, the female ones with psyche. Cf. Rene Arnou, Le Desir de Dieu dans la philosophic de Plotin (Paris, 1921), appendix A, 296ff. The absence of an explicitly female person from the Christian trinity should be noted, while with the Gnostic divinities the feminine is usually well represented. (Note also the quite positive evaluation of the Biblical Eve and women in general with the Gnostics.) 50 Enn. II v 4, 5, II viii 1lff. 51 It might be noted that it has been a recurrent method in philosophy to bridge by dialectic or metaphor or both the gap between incommensurable thought sys- tems or between thought and experience. One finds this, for instance, in the Monad- ology, where Leibniz attempts to reunite geometry with physical reality. Or one finds it in the many attempts to solve the mind-body " problem," a problem due in many of its formulations to the improper opposition of two sets of abstractions. More recently this method has been exemplified in the dialectical exercises of those who have put values beyond the reach of scientific method and yet wish somehow to relate values to this world. 52 Enn. IV viii 1, VI ix 9.</page><page sequence="9">PLOTINUS AND THE GNOSTICS 297 itself. The experience is the indicated goal, but Plotinus describes the struc- ture of the One, as well as that of nous, in logical rather than experiential terms. The present discussion, nevertheless, has uncovered some strong mythical undercurrents in Plotinus. The answer suggests itself therefore that Plotinus' thought in its non-logical aspects was not so much oriented on a single or rare mystical experience, but rather on those unconscious or half-conscious impulses that find expression in myth. If Plotinus is to be given a name, he should be called a " mythic " rather than a mystic.53 Plotinus is to be regarded as in a sense a Gnostic manque, and to see him as such is a major clue to his thought.64 Plotinus seems to be launched 53 The distinction between the two is sometimes a fine one, but in mystical ex- perience, one might say, the symbolic is given active sensory expression, in myth it is more intellectualized (which fits in well with Plotinus' rationalism). Myth can be so attenuated that, as in some theologians, for instance, " God " is not much more than a logical term. There is, as some scholars have noted (for instance, R. Arnou, op. cit., 276-278), much parallelism between the ritual of the mystery religions and the metaphors describing the mystic experience, including for instance the central significance of light. (In the ceremony the climax is reached when the statue of the god is revealed in a blaze of light.) Plotinus seems to have been acquainted with the ritual of the mystery religions (see Ennead VI ix 11) and this has to be taken into account when one looks for the referents of Plotinus' statements con- cerning supersensible experience. Myth, mystery ritual, mystic experience are of course related expressions of psychic striving. E. Brehier in his book La Philosophie de Plotin (Paris, 1928), chapter 7, has argued that the idea, often prominent in Plotinus, of the self's absorption in a larger non-conscious existence is not Greek in origin, and attempts to deduce it from Indian sources. Whatever the possible rela- tions of historical influence, the emotional roots of the idea of the absorption of the individual in a larger whole should be given full consideration. It is interesting to note that the " Western " (Plotinus' " Greek ") mind, in the face of certain psychic projections, readily resorts to the epithet "Eastern" or some equivalent. Thus the tendency of the essay against the Gnostics to separate intellectually from one's self certain of one's psychic strivings is rather general. It is one of the forms of self-alienation. 54 Hazel E. Barnes, in an article on " Neo-Platonism and Analytical Psychology," The Philosophical Review, LIV (1945), 558-577, states on the first page that Plotinus "to a large extent presented in religious metaphysics what they [the Gnostics] were saying by means of elaborate religious symbolisms." The body of the article is devoted to another topic than the direct substantiation of this asser- tion. It should be noted that it is the claim of the present article that Plotinus, rather than presenting a philosophical version of Gnosticism, presents a much re- stricted view when compared with Gnosticism. E. Brehier, op. cit., has called atten- tion to the dual orientation of Plotinus' thought. He says (35), "We find in Plotinus a double presentation of reality: on the one hand a presentation akin to the myth of the soul. . . . On the other hand, the universe . . . can be the object of rational thought." On p. 8 Brehier declares that for all of Plotinus' attachment to the rational method of Greek philosophy, "the problems which he puts himself are problems which Greek philosophy never envisaged. They are problems that are properly religious." It seems to the present writer that " religious " may be too specific a term to denote the psychic factors implied in Plotinus' thought. On the resemblance of Plotinian and Gnostic ideas concerning the highest existence, see</page><page sequence="10">298 JOSEPH KATZ on a path that he does not dare to pursue to its end. His use of reason does not lead back to " Greek " science, and yet it bars a frank acknowledgment of its mythical motivations. As compared with contemporary Gnostics and Christians, there is something peculiarly unfinished and thwarted about Plotinus' philosophy. The ascent to the One is a more jungle-like journey, stirring more monsters in the soul and awakening more longings than Ploti- nus allowed. Both Gnostics and Christians saw this much better. In the case of Plotinus too, Dionysos is playing his tricks on another sober son of Apollo. It should finally be said that Plotinus' philosophy is properly compared with Gnosticism, rather than Christianity. The development of what was to become Christianity was controlled by the limitations, both positive and negative, of a mass movement and an eventual state religion. Both Ploti- nus' and the Gnostics' are essentially minority creeds with no hope of mass following and without the penalty of dilution. Both separate mankind into classes, considering only a small group with special attainments as the redeemed: Their minority status is not due to accident, but to the fullness of their expression of certain special impulses which society at large con- siders dangerous or impractical and from which it shrinks into conformism. Plotinus, had he known of it, would have been sympathetic to the rebellious interpretation the Gnostics gave of the serpent's advice in Eden. To acquire knowledge of good and evil is an inspiration from the highest God, prohibi- tion of it the work of a fallen deity. In the way they interpreted the serpent's advice Plotinus and the Gnostics differed. The gnosis of Plotinus tends to be knowledge by discursive symbol, that of the Gnostics knowledge by myth and even acquaintance; in Ennead IV viii 7 (cf. Enn. IV viii 5) Plotinus goes as far as to say that experience of evil may have the value of enhancing the psyche's appreciation of good, but, he adds characteristically, only for those who need to learn by experience rather than by science. Neither Neoplatonism nor Gnosticism ever became genuine alternatives to Christianity, because they were both more partial and in some respects more perfect. Both of them continued their careers as tacit or open heresies under Christianity (Gnosticism, for instance, in the guise of alchemy). The temptation of intellect and the temptation of myth are as omnipresent as Plotinus held his One to be. They lurk furtively in the very soul of the conformist whose vaunted realism is often not much more than a defense against such divine madness. Vassar College. E.

But the body of the article is an addition to and in some respects a revision of what I say in chapter 2, entitled "The nature of Plotinus'' mysticism. "</page></plain_text>
