Yet more controversial are his arguments for dating the Pentateuch in the post-exilic period, especially late in that period. There are strong arguments for dating at least parts of it much earlier. Whatever may be thought of such questions, readers will value the book and find it interesting. To end on a lighter note, Scottish readers are unlikely to welcome the description of James Barr in the penultimate sentence of the book as "der englische Alttestamentler und Theologe". [J.A.

This book is based on Maori's dis- sertation at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, which was noted in VT 27 (1977), p. 256. The published form differs from the original in that the treatment of a number of subjects has been expanded, and more recent publications have been taken into consideration. The chapter headings are listed in English as well as Hebrew, but the book lacks the English summary of the dissertation. A translation into English would be welcome. [J.A. EMERTON] E.

The tenth anniversary of the Werkgroep Informatica, Vrije Universiteit, Amsterdam, was made into an oppor- tunity for representatives of a number of research groups to meet and report on their work. This volume includes the text of the reports on VU Amsterdam (E. Talstra, F. Postma), Maredsous (R.-F. Poswick), Westminster Seminary, Philadelphia (J. Alan Groves), Jerusalem (E. Tov, B.A. Nieuwoudt), Bethel-Bielefeld (C. Hardmeier), and Tubingen (H. Schweizer), and a short response by H.M. Vroom which drew attention to the contribution of formalized computer-based research on the biblical text to reflection about hermeneutical questions. The volume provides a valuable progress report on projects which were under way in the late 1980s before the massive devel- opment of "computer Bibles" on microcomputers in the past few years provided the wished-for "scholar-friendly" tools that are now in widespread use. [G.I. DAVIES] K. VAN DER TOORN (ed.), The Image and the Book: Iconic Cults, Aniconism, and the Rise of Book Religion in Israel and the Ancient Near East. Contributions to Biblical Exegesis and Theology 21. 271 pp. Uitgeverij Peeters, Leuven, 1997. BEF 1240. In his intro- duction, the editor stresses the importance of iconography in the study of religion in Israel and elsewhere in the ancient Near East rather than almost exclusive reliance on texts. He notes the view of some scholars that images of Yahweh were used in temples in Israel. The present book "offers... a representative and well-informed survey of the available data, both textual and archaeological, on the role of divine images in the biblical world" (p. 18). The articles are all in English. I. Cornelius surveys iconography in Egypt, Mesopotamia, Anatolia and Urartu, and Syria-Palestine. He finds five ways of representing a deity: "as an anthropomorphic being;... a theriomorphic being; ... a mixture of the two;... in inanimate form (by symbols such as a lightning fork or a weapon"); and "by a materially emphasized empty space" (pp. 41-2). Angelika Berlejung describes and discusses the Mesopotamian ritual of the mouth-washing of images "to establish perfect purity and to enable con- tact between the earthly and the divine worlds", after which the "image became 'charged' with positive powers" (p. 45). H. Niehr "collects and discusses the evidence for a YHWHi statue in the First Temple" (p. 74). He believes that, given the widespread use of cultic images in the ancient Near East, the onus of proof is on those who deny such use in Israel and Judah, and who are thus involved in difficulty in explaining some passages in the O.T. For example, in 1 Kings xii 28-9 "The calf, as YHWH'S divine image, is not only a pedestal for an invisible deity... but is itself a theriomorphic cult image" (p. 82). Further, Niehr holds that cultic statues of Yahweh were found in Jerusalem no less than in the Northern</page><page sequence="2">576 BOOK LIST kingdom. While some of his arguments (such as the claim that references to seeing the face of Yahweh imply the presence of an image) have some plausibility, he overstates his case. For example, he holds that Ps. xxiv, 7, 9, xlvii 6, 9 and lxviii 25-6 imply that there were processions with Yahweh's image, but rejects the theory that he was represented by the ark, on the ground that "the ark is not mentioned at all" in the first of these passages, "nor does the ark have sufficient theological significance to do duty as the representation of YHWH" (p. 86). But it is also true that an image "is not mentioned at all", and Niehr's claim about the ark's lack of theological significance is no more than an assertion. On the other hand, Ps. lxviii 2 recalls words spoken of the ark in Num. x 35. Similarly, the argument that "it would be hard to visualize YHrWH seated on his throne in combination with the ark" (p. 87) in Ps. xlvii 6, 9 and other enthronement psalms is plausible only if the verses are understood in a wooden and unimaginative way. Why could not the ark symbolize the presence of Yahweh? Further, prophetic visions of Yahweh picture him anthropomorphically, but that need not imply "the existence of a cult statue in the First Temple" (p. 90). Niehr seems too sure of his own interpretation of the evidence to do justice to other possibilities. C. Uehlinger offers a thorough survey and evaluation of anthropomorphic cult statues in Palestine in the Iron Age, and then turns to such "statues of Yahweh and associated deities". He discusses the evidence from Kuntillet 'Ajrud and Khirbet el-Qom and rightly questions the theory that a drawing of pithos A from the former site represents Yahweh and the goddess Asherah. On the other hand, he maintains that, while the words yhwh... wl'srth may be understood to refer either to Yahweh and Asherah or to Yahweh and "a cult symbol, usually a wooden pole" (p. 142), the former understand- ing is, not only possible, but preferable. This view is more questionable. He also sug- gests that the representation of a bearded male figure and what is perhaps a female figure from a site in Judah of "the late 8th or early 7th century" (p. 150) may rep- resent Yahweh and Asherah. Finally, Uehlinger draws together his conclusions. He has, he claims, found evidence for cultic statues in both Israel and Judah, and he questions "the assumption that Yahwism was ever aniconic in essence" (p. 153). On the other hand, he recognizes that T.N.D. Mettinger "has made a good case for the existence of de facto 'aniconism' within the Yahwisms of pre-exilic Israel and Judah" (p. 153). He thinks of "aspects of gradual change during the late Iron Age" combined "with expe- riences of sudden disruption at the close of the monarchical period" (p. 154), and he offers a possible view of the way in which the development occurred. B. Becking discusses Nimrud Prism IV 25-41 of Sargon II, and argues that its ref- erences to taking divine images from Samaria may be more than a literary topos: they may be evidence for iconic polytheism in Samaria. He also argues, however, that reliefs in Sargon's palace in Khorsabad have nothing to do with Samaria. T.N.D. Mettinger discusses Israelite aniconism, a term which he uses "to refer to cults where there is no iconic representation of the deity (anthropomorphic or theri- omorphic) serving as the dominant or central cultic symbol" (p. 174). He distinguishes between "de facto aniconism", i.e. "the mere absence of images", and "programmatic aniconism", i.e. "the programmatic demand for a cult without images" (pp. 174-5). He finds the latter in the Decalogue, in which he believes it to be an insertion. He regards the insertion as a prohibition of images of Yahweh and dates it in the late 6th cen- tury B.C. Before that, "we find some signs of a reaction against images in connection with Hosea in the north (the bull at Bethel) and Hezekiah in the south (Nehushtan)", but "it is difficult to argue that there was a living tradition of programmatic aniconism" before the exile (p. 184). He suggests, however, that there is some evidence for defacto aniconism in pre-exilic times. In his opinion, the cherubim throne (1 Kings vi 23-8; cp. the phrase yoseb hakkerubim in a number of verses) did not contain an image of Yahweh, but was empty, and he challenges the arguments of Niehr: "The case for a cultic image of YHWH in the first temple must... be judged as not proven" (p. 187).</page><page sequence="3">BOOK LIST On the other hand, a consideration of the image of the bull at Bethel leads Mettinger to conclude that "the balance of probability weighs slightly in favour of the interpre- tation of the bull statue itself as representing YHWH. However, the result is by no means conclusive" (p. 192). Mettinger next discusses the cult of standing stones among the Phoenicians and, later, among the Nabateans and the pre-Islamic Arabs. He relates this to the Israelite use of massebo6t, before they were regarded as illegitimate cultic objects, and sees here a kind of de facto aniconism. "The age-old practice of the aniconic cult (of various types: standing-stone aniconism, empty throne) contributes on a more profound level [than close contacts with iconic cults during and after the exile] to the explanation of the anti-iconic stance" (p. 204). R.S. Hendel explores "some factors in addition to the open-air sanctuaries [which Mettinger has linked with aniconism] that may have contributed to the formation and articulation of de facto aniconism in Israel" (p. 206). He considers three subjects. First, some Mesopotamian texts describe particular gods in anthropomorphic terms and yet use terms that go beyond mere anthropomorphism. For example, in the Enuma Elish Marduk has four eyes and four ears and "his form was outstanding". "Marduk is exalted above the other gods to the degree that his body transcends the anthropo- morphism of the other gods" (p. 207). Further, in Egyptian texts from the New Kingdom the "transcendence of the sun-god is expressed in part by denying him anthropomor- phic representation" (p. 211). Second, few, if any, of the Palestinian statues or figurines of the Iron Age can be identified with Yahweh, and this is related by Hendel to the idea that one may not see Yahweh and live. Third, Hendel believes like Mettinger that above the ark was an empty throne, and he discusses the implications of this view. K. van der Toorn comments that the question under discussion "is not, or not only, whether the Israelites worshipped images, but whether they had symbols which for all practical purposes served as divine images for them" (p. 229). He comments on the way in which there was a tendency earlier in the present century to contrast "book religion" with "ritual religion" to the disadvantage of the latter. Van der Toorn, how- ever, wishes "to challenge the idea according to which the religious image addresses only the senses, whereas the written word addresses the human mind" (p. 232). He describes the Babylonian cult of images, and then turns to the "Torah as the Icon of Israel". He believes that Israelite religion in the pre-exilic period "was not very different from its contemporary Babylonian counterpart", and that Yahweh "was represented by an image" in the Jerusalem temple (p. 239). The Deuteronomists brought about a change in attitude, and the Torah was "substituted for the icon of the deity" (p. 241). He suggests various comparisons between the Babylonian cult of images and the ways in which the Torah was viewed, not only in Deuteronomy and later parts of the O.T., but also in post-biblical Judaism. Finally, he enquires about the reason for the change introduced by the Deuteronomists, and suggests that it is linked with the centralization of the cult in Jerusalem. "The two aspects of the Deuteronomistic reform resulted in a monopoly of religious power: the Jerusalem clergy had strengthened its position at the cost of the local priests" (p. 247). Van der Toorn comments on the effects of the change and asks about "the motives behind the Deuteronomic anti-iconism: was it really a desire to promote a loftier form of religion, or mainly a way of establishing a position of religious monopoly?" (p. 248). The book ends with a "selected bibliography", a list of the illustrations (of images, etc.) and indexes of biblical references and subjects. This work both gives an account of the current debate about images in ancient Israel in its Near Eastern setting and presents different points of view and the arguments advanced in their favour.
