<plain_text><page sequence="1">A One-Semester Introduction to Literary Interpretation Ingeborg Baumgartner and Max Noordhoorn In a recent article, "Teaching Foreign Literature in College: Premises, Problems, Proposals," Helene Scher suggests that "a well-structured literature curriculum be based on a one-semester introduction to literary interpretation, which would be a prerequisite for all other literature courses."1 For the past four years just such a course has been a part of the curriculum at Albion College. The gradual reduction and ultimate elimination of specific subject requirements that began about ten years ago, placed upon individual departments the responsibility of teaching skills in writing and in providing background for literary interpretation (technical terms, genres, and literary movements). Since adequate preparation in these areas was clearly needed, a new course entitled "Interpretation of Literature" was designed for junior-level students to instruct them in the fundamentals of textual analysis. The course is to be taken after the fourth semester of language learning and preferably prior to other courses in literature. Taught primarily in German, the course is open to INGEBORG BAUMGARTNER, Associate Professor of Modern Languages at Albion College, received the Ph.D. from the University of Michigan. MAX NOORDHOORN, Assistant Professor of Modern Languages at Albion College, received the Ph.D. from the University of Michigan. 42</page><page sequence="2">any student who satisfies four semesters of college German or the equivalent. Actually, qualified students including freshmen are en- couraged to enroll in it. The course purposively sets about to train the students in basic skills and verbal tools that are deemed necessary not only for the enjoyment of literature but also for the analysis of other subjects as well. Organization of the course is based on a fifteen-week semester which is divided into three equal sections-prose fiction, drama, and poetry. Ex- perience proved that more time must be devoted to prose and drama than to the poetry. In the first five weeks, the students are introduced to prose fiction through two German novellas.2 Three introductory sessions on the history, characteristics, and terminology of the genre are followed by about twelve hours of discussion of the two novellas. Specific assignments accompanied by relevant German questions form the basis for class discussion, which is conducted in German. Sometimes the assigned pages are divided among members of the class for brief oral reports in German. In our case, this can be done because enrollment varies from six to ten students. As outside reading and as the topic for the first paper Thomas Mann's Tonio Kr6ger was selected.3 This assignment is carefully controlled. Students hand in an outline of their work to be evaluated before the following meeting for obvious organizational flaws. The five- to ten-page papers, written in English, are returned at the earliest possible date with copious comments and suggestions for improvement. The second section is devoted to drama, and approximately the same procedure is followed as in the first five weeks: a three-period in- troduction precedes four weeks of reading and discussion. The two dramas, one by Friedrich Hebbel and one by Bertolt Brecht, introduce the students to representative pieces of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, to the traditional as well as to the epic form.4 Outside reading offers a wider choice from a list including works by Friedrich DCirren- matt, Max Frisch, Gerhart Hauptmann, and others. Again the students are asked to hand in an outline of their papers one week before these are due. The third section is devoted to the introduction of poetry. The text, Paths to German Poetry by Lore Barbara Foltin and Hubert Heinen, provides a representative selection of German poems from various periods, a superb introduction, helpful notes, and stimulating questions.s About a dozen poems may be selected for class discussion. It is useful to assign eager students the task of interpreting a poem for presentation in class. This is to be done in German and under the guidance of the instructor. Each student then writes a paper on one poem from a list of ten. In addition to the outline of the paper, an English prose translation of the poem chosen is required. This was found to be immensely helpful in preventing any misunderstanding of the literal meaning of the poem. To further test the students' progress, 43</page><page sequence="3">no outline for the interpretation of the poem is provided in the syllabus. The same procedures are followed in class discussions and when writing papers: a brief backgound of the poem, a technical analysis of meter, rhyme, etc., a line-by-line and strophe-by-strophe discussion, in- tegrating meaning and technique. A two-hour final exam tests the knowledge of terminology and of readings done for class. The examination consists of a choice of two out of four essay questions and the definition of a list of technical terms. Such a course seems to offer much to students and instructors as re- flected in the students' positive course evaluation and in their per- formance in subsequent literature courses. They enjoy a distinct ad- vantage in more advanced literature courses: they can ask appropriate questions and know what to look for. As far as the instructor is con- cerned, a major benefit of this course is its flexibility. The readings and the time spent on each of the sections may be easily changed or various parts of the course may be taught by different instructors.6 Since papers constitute a significant part of the course, providing students with a sample outline for at least two papers greatly facilitates their skill in this area and decreases the instructor's frustration significaptly when evaluating the finished work. Moreover, students begin to apply their acquired skills, to discriminate, to organize their thoughts into logical sentences and lucid paragraphs. As mentioned before, the student is solely responsible for the outline of the last paper. The two major concerns in designing such a course are sequence and selection. It is practical to start with an introduction to prose fiction. In the beginning of the semester, the student generally has more time at his disposal to read a longer assignment, and he can draw upon his past experience where such reading material formed the basis of the syllabus. The transition to drama is a fairly natural one, and the student's background (TV, movies, theater) may be used to illustrate several points. The introduction to poetry is scheduled at the end of the semester because by then the student has been trained sufficiently to observe texts more closely, is familiar with some technical terms, and has refined his skills so that poetry is more easily accessible to him than may be the case earlier in the semester. Selecting novellas, dramas, or poems for class discussion and outside reading can be left to the discretion of the individual instructors, who may select on the basis of interest, expertise, linguistic ease, and accessibility. In conclusion, experience has shown that in an introductory course in literature it is most profitable to focus on the intrinsic interpretation of a text and that an attempt to include "a brief survey of the major in- terpretive approaches," as Scher suggests, is too ambitious an un- 44</page><page sequence="4">dertaking at this point.7 Such a survey is better suited to the student's subsequent exposure to literature after the fundamentals have been mastered. * Albion College Appendix On the first day of class each student receives a packet containing the following: 1. titles of texts, objectives of course, and manner of evaluation; 2. detailed syllabus; dates for outlines, papers, and examination; discussion and lecture topics for each class meeting; 3. outlines for paper on Tonio Kr6ger and for paper on drama; 4. list of books reserved in the library; list of additional books recommended; and 5. list of terms with which they have to acquaint themselves.

Sub- sequently, we substituted for Taugenichts Ludwig Tieck's Der blonde Eckbert with notes and questions provided by the instructor. We prefer texts with explanatory notes and questions in German, but because many texts are out of print, the choice of material is limited. Instructors can substitute other novellas, short stories, or even excerpts from novels for the ones we have chosen. 3Thomas Mann, Tonio Kr6ger, ed. by Van Horn Vail, Kimberly Sparks, and Thomas Huber (New York: Harcourt Brace Jovanovich, Inc., 1974). This edition provides the students with the necessary apparatus to work on the novella independently. 4We use Friedrich Hebbel's Maria Magdalena (Stuttgart: Reclam, 1972) and Bertolt Brecht's Leben des Galilei, ed. by Victor Lange (New York: Harcourt Brace 46</page><page sequence="6">jovanovich, Inc., 1972) and provide notes along with German questions. SLore Barbara Foltin and Hubert Heinen, Paths to German Poetry (New York: Dodd, Mead &amp; Company, 1969). 6The syllabus can be altered to serve a shorter period of instruction, e.g., for a ten- week period with about thirty meetings the assignments could be reduced to cover only one novella, one drama, and about six poems in class, while retaining about three periods for the. introduction to each genre. The number of papers assigned could be reduced from three to two. 7Scher, p. 59.</page></plain_text>
