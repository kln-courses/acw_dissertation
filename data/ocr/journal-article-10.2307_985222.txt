<plain_text><page sequence="1">DE WETTE IN NEW ENGLAND SIEGFRIED B. PUKNAT Department of Foreign Languages, University of California, Davis AN ARTICLE on the University of Berlin in the Christian Examiner in November, 1836, names the illustrious professors who had been identified with that institution in the early nineteenth cen- tury, notably Fichte, Schleiermacher, Hegel, and De Wette. "Of these," the writer, Henry A. Walker, continues, "De Wette alone still survives, and toils industriously at Basle to heighten the glory that already crowns his days. The exile, though a bold innovator, is allowed on all sides to be one of the best critics and ablest writers in Germany. His works are but little obscured by the mysticism common to his countrymen, exhibit- ing much of the English pith, nerve, compactness, and point." Here is a clue for the popularity of Wilhelm Martin Leberecht De Wette in New Eng- land in the first half of the nineteenth century- for the fact that he was one of the most extensively translated and admired German writers of the period. De Wette enjoyed the enviable reputation of being simultaneously one of the least mystical of German thinkers, a stylist who could boast of English directness and simplicity, and a theologian whose ideas harmonized with the views of the New England transcendentalists. While the names of Eichhorn, Paulus, Neander, Strauss, and other giants among the German theologians of the late eighteenth and early nine- teenth centuries have been remembered, De Wette suffered undeserved oblivion, from which several critics, and more recently studies undertaken at the University of Basel, have attempted to rescue him. Karl Barth is among those who have la- mented this neglect, suggesting that in many areas De Wette anticipated important ideas later capi- talized on by others.2 His prominence in New England may be indicated by the names as well as the number of his translators. Theodore Parker, James Freeman Clarke, Samuel Osgood, and Frederick Frothingham applied their knowl- edge of German to De Wette, and Osgood and Clarke, at least, may have helped thereby to coun- 1 21 : 220. 2 Gesammelte Vortrage 2: 195, Munich, Chr. Kaiser, 1925. teract the notion widespread in New England that the study of German was the first step toward unbelief and a fearful movement into intellectual cloudiness. When James Freeman Clarke asked Emerson to write an article on Schleiermacher, he pressed his case by citing De Wette's high regard for Schleiermacher,3 from which one may infer Emerson's familiarity with and high regard for De Wette. And in The Dial itself there was severe criticism of any slighting of the "profound works of De Wette." 4 In the New England of the 1830's and 1840's De Wette was prominent among those north German thinkers whose influence played such a significant role in both American philosophy and education. Today he is least known of this group that included Lessing, Herder, Fichte, and Schleiermacher. I Born near Weimar on January 12, 1780, De Wette came of a long line of clergymen originating in the Netherlands in the sixteenth century. After attending Gymnasium in Weimar, where Herder was then in charge of the school system-De Wette sometimes had his lessons and oral tests at Herder's home-he entered the University of Jena in 1799, and by 1804 taught there as Privat- dozent. From 1807 to 1810 he was a professor, first of philosophy and then of theology, at Heidel- berg. In 1810 he became, through Schleier- macher's efforts, a professor of theology at the newly founded University of Berlin, where he worked with Schleiermacher for a period of nine years. As a result of a letter of sympathy written to the mother of Kotzebue's assassin, containing words that the Prussian government interpreted as unfriendly and offensive, De Wette was dis- missed from the faculty in 1819, despite the pro- test of the academic senate. His refusal to accept 3January 18, 1835. Letters of Ralph Waldo Emerson, ed. by R. L. Rusk, 1: 425, New York, Columbia Univ.

The next three years he lived as a private citi- zen in Weimar, dedicated to his studies and to writing not only theological works but also the novel Theodor oder des Zweiflers Weihe, which James Freeman Clarke was to translate in the late thirties. In 1822 the rejuvenated University of Basel attracted him to that city, where he re- mained for twenty-seven years, until his death on June 19, 1849. His second wife, the mother of his two children, brought to her marriage with De Wette in 1809 her son by her first marriage, Karl Beck, born 1798. It was probably through his politically active stepson that De Wette took a personal interest in the young assassin, Karl Sand, at whose parental home he had once by chance visited. Karl Beck and his friend Karl Follen, who was accused'of having instigated the assassination of Kotzebue, were destined to take the same road as refugees. Both first lived as teachers for several years in Switzerland, Follen for a period giving public lectures at Basel and editing with De Wette the literary journal of the university. Together Beck and Follen emigrated to America and later became professors at Harvard. De Wette succeeded in combining scholarship with public activity in a manner especially appeal- ing to the New Englanders. Besides his many scholarly writings in the fields of Biblical criti- cism, ethics, dogmatics, and education, his trans- lation of the Bible (regarded as an outstanding achievement of accuracy), his critical edition of Luther's letters, and his creative writing (includ- ing two novels, a play, and some poems), he was active in many organizations devoted to the im- provement of education and social conditions. In a poem written a half year before his death, De Wette alludes to his restless diligence in pursuit of knowledge, but laments the inadequacy of his work and what he regarded as failures in his par- ticipation in the theological battles of his day. Al- though he now wishes he had endured more for the ideals of freedom and justice, he is thankful that he has kept his faith free of illusion and de- ception. The content and spirit of these late verses reveal the persistent affinity between De Wette and the New Englanders to the end of his life, even though a return to orthodoxy was im- plied by his Base'l colleague Hagenbach.5 Like the 5 Hagenbach, K. R., Rede bei der Beerdigung des Herrn Dr. und Professor W. M. L. de Wette, Basel, 1849. The copy in the Harvard Library is inscribed "to New Englanders, De Wette expected a rebirth of mankind through spiritual and ethical rejuvenation by means of the Christian religion. Herder, in many ways De Wette's model, had already attempted to fuse religion and secular- ism-theology and humanism-a dichotomy that became critical especially in Germany and New England. De Wette was a major figure in that movement of Biblical criticism which reached a peak in the early nineteenth century, a line of development from Spinoza in the seventeenth cen- tury, through Semler in the eighteenth, to Gries- bach, Paulus, De Wette, and others in the early nineteenth century. The problem to which the historical-critical method was applied-one at the very basis of the New England controversy cen- tered on the doctrine of miracles-was the attempt to define historical truth. The two translations of De Wette published in George Ripley's Specimens of Foreign Standard Literature (14 v., Boston, 1838-1842), subsequent to the opening volumes of Jouffroy, Cousin, and Constant, may be thought of as part of Ripley's answer to Andrews Norton, who had been espe- cially vociferous on the impious temerity of Ger- man philosophizing, on the "German insanity." It was Norton who republished in Cambridge in 1840 two articles by Professors James W. Alex- ander and Albert B. Dod of the Princeton Theo- logical Seminary entitled "Transcendentalism of the Germans and of Cousin in its Influence on Opinion in this Country" (originally in the January, 1839, issue of The Biblical Repertory and Princeton Review). The authors of these attacks refer to the oblique entrance of German influence into New England, that is, by way of the French. After several attempts at irony, the writers inform their readers that if a transatlantic philosophy is bound to come, they want it to come- "in its native robustness and freshness." 6 When they say that the French language is less fit to convey the "endless distinctions of the German," they hardly intend flattery to the Germans. Al- though this attack upon George Ripley does not account for the policy he had already established N. L. Frothingham from L. De Wette, M.D." Biographi- cal data are given by his children in a pamphlet attached to this publication.

SOC. for his series,7 it was undoubtedly an additional stimulus to encourage him to publish De Wette. In an earlier article in The Boston Daily Adver- tiser 8 Ripley had already argued with Norton that the science of theology had received its greatest developments in Germany and that theological doctrines, such as the doctrine of miracles, could be discussed in Germany with freedom, learning, and industry. It may be that Ripley as well as Clarke and Osgood, whose translations were to appear in the Specimens of Foreign Standard Literature, learned mainly through Charles Follen and Charles Beck of De Wette, although some of his works had been in use at Andover in the twenties and perhaps even a few years before 1820.9 In his inaugural discourse at Harvard, where he became Professor of German in 1830, Follen emphasized the need on the part of the student of German literature, particularly of theological works, for direction under a guide. Follen was himself such a guide, and in his recommendations he probably mentioned the stepfather of his friend Charles Beck, whose family he had visited in Basel and with whom he had left Europe for America. In this same discourse Follen stated that whatever the degree of skepticism and the rejection of his- torical evidence, the Germans still embraced the spiritual essence of Christianity: ". . . it may well be said of every one who has enjoyed a German education, that his mind has been nurtured in religion." 10 Charles Beck, who became Professor of Latin at Harvard in 1832, had excellent opportunities to become exposed to theology and its controver- sies after his mother married De Wette, while the latter was still a professor at Heidelberg. Beck shared with Follen an interest in the dissemination of German knowledge in New England, and probably helped make his stepfather's writings available. In 1837 he was visited by his young halfbrother, Ludwig De Wette, who in the follow- ing year described in book form his five-months stay in Cambridge and his journey in the United States and Canada." The special appeal to Amer- ican readers of the attitudes and style characteris- tic of the senior De Wette's work, in combination 7See "Editor's preface," in vol. 1. 842, November 9, 1836. 9 Cf.

That New England in the first half of the nine- teenth century was peculiarly receptive to the ideas of German theologians is well known. Indeed, interest in theology was one of the two or three main channels through which German thought reached New England.12 The strongest single stimulus for New England interest in German culture was the need for theological knowledge and support, which could best be met in the writ- ings of the theological revolution that had long been under way in Germany, that "Athenaeum of modern times," in the vocabulary of the Christian Examiner by 1825.'3 This is not to say that the reading of German literature, "the most profound, the most original, and the most various literature of modern Europe," in the enthusiastic view of the same periodical,'4 was exclusively the result of an interest in German theology, or that the awareness of Weimar, "the Athens of modern Europe," came only as a by-product of a concern with German theology. For better or for worse, Kotzebue was the leading playwright on the Bos- ton stage in 1800, and Goethe and Schiller were not entirely unknown at that early date. The Sorrows of Werther had already been used as an appropriate volume for the bedside table of a sui- cide in one of the earliest American novels.14a In 12 In 1916 W. Girard (Du Transcendentalisme con- sidere essentiellement dans sa definition et ses origines franSaises, Univ. of California Publications in Modern Philology 4 (3): 351-498; see especially p. 400) at- tributed, in a sentence, the diffusion of German idealism in America to theologians, especially Herder, Schleier- macher, and De Wette, an emphasis endorsed by G. Sherburn in his otherwise unfavorable review of this study, in Modern Philology 15: 317-320, 1917. More recently, R. Wellek (Minor transcendentalists and Ger- man philosophy, New England Quarterly 15: 652480), while rejecting both the notion that interest in German thought could be ascribed to the return of the G6ttingen students and the theory that German philosophy first came through Coleridge and Carlyle, has also regarded theology as supplying the motive for the study of German thought. A comprehensive account has recently been given by Pochmann, H. A., German culture in America, Madison, Univ. of Wisconsin Press, 1957; see especially the section on the unitarians' interest in German rational theology, 114-151.

Nevertheless, the stimulus to read German literary works came from a prime interest in German idealism among the New Englanders. This interest was either directly or indirectly tied up with native intellec- tual currents, the origin of which was essentially theological. Many of the more liberal theologians in New England believed that transcendentalism would save religion and that the masters of the "transcendental method" were German. This "method" was committed to the spirit of inquiry, and had proved its worth by the amazing erudi- tion evinced in every phase of philosophy and theology. The New Englanders were intensely conscious of having entered a state of reflection and of "in- quiry concerning themselves and their destination, the nature of their being, the evidence of their knowledge, and the grounds of their faith." For many of them "the German philosophy [was] the strongest expression of that tendency." 15 In the theological controversies of the time-orthodox versus liberal, Calvinist versus Unitarian, rational- ist versus supernaturalist-German theology was inevitably both attacked and defended. That "German theology" as such did not exist occurred to few of the debaters. Probably in no other European country at that time was there so much independence of inquiry and such a wide variety of speculation. The varied studies in the "science of divinity" were being pursued with a depth of research unparalleled elsewhere. Time and again it was pointed out that between orthodoxy and rationalism there was to be found in Germany almost every variety of opinion, more or less liberal, with prominent spokesmen for each. Al- though a better acquaintance with German theo- logical writings was producing a fairer estimate by the early 1830's, that is, more of a balance between exaggeration and deprecation, the contro- versy over German theology, which began shortly before 1820, reached its peak around 1840, at the very time three important De Wette translations were about to appear, and abated in the late 1850's. The most prominent among the early opponents 15 Review of Coleridge's Biographia literaria and other works of Coleridge, Christian Examiner 14: 120, March, 1833. of "German theology" was Professor Moses Stuart of Andover. In an 1846 postscript to his Letters to Dr. Channing, published originally in 1819, he sees his prophecies as having been valid. In America it will not be possible, he thinks, to go beyond Theodore Parker's position. "It needs a German mind and education to do this." 16 Others joined Stuart, soon after his Letters were pub- lished, in giving warning against indiscriminate following of German scholars. One writer, for example, suggests in his criticism the extent of theological influence by 1825: Every tyro in Biblical criticism has learnt to point with oracular solemnity to Germany, and to put on a countenance of portentous significancy, as he gravely proceeds to confound all the liberal inquiry in the world with the liberal inquiry of that country.... A spirit of extravagance has infected the literature and politics, as well as the religion of the learned in Germany.17 Another article ten years later contains a caveat in the report that the extreme liberals were occu- pying the most important pulpits as well as the most important professorships in theological schools in Germany. The writer, George R. Noyes, added that no books were more common in the libraries of young New England theologians than those emanating from Germany and that the study of the German language and literature were on the increase "and must continue to increase." 18 A critic's attitude toward theology often deter- mined his pronouncements on German literature. While a reviewer of a translation of Undine could give his verdict in favor of German literature, having just spoken of the "more profound produc- tions of Germany, the labors of the theologians and philosophers," 19 another critic, who denounced transcendentalism as coming from Germany and as "one of the first fruits of a diseased admiration of everything from that source," lamented the fact that there were more English translations of Faust than of the Iliad, and that a version of one of Schiller's plays had a better chance of finding purchasers and readers than did a native drama. "In the literary history of the last half century, there is nothing more striking to be recorded, than the various exhibitions of this German mania. . ..

PUKNAT [PROC. AMER. PHIL. SOC. fected." 20 Anyone who touched a German book in any field could be suspected of being on the broad road to infidelity. But the focus of attack was on theology and philosophy, and in his battle in 1839 against the modern school of German infidelity, it is Spinoza, Schleiermacher, and De Wette whom Andrews Norton singled out as special targets. Spinoza's pantheism was derided as the "public secret of Germany." 21 Orville Dewey, in Two Discourses on Religion (1841), outdid the rest, however, in interpreting German theology as a kind of necessary evil: "The very state of the German mind . . . is an argument with me, for the miraculous element in the Chris- tian system." 22 Despite the anathemas pronounced against a whole generation of German theologians, there were those who admired, and benefited by, Ger- man research, even if they could not accept German speculation in toto. A work such as David Friedrich Strauss' Life of Jesus, which Moses Stuart regarded as positive proof for his theory and prophecy, was reviewed with considerable moderation, though not without skepticism. As Theodore Parker pointed out, the work of Schleiermacher and De Wette was often as bold and remorseless and sometimes as destructive as that of Strauss. At the same time, it was rightly believed that Strauss was indebted to De Wette, as well as others, for modifications of his views.23 Some New Englanders, such as George Bancroft as early as 1824, defended German theology as a center and main support of Protestantism.24 Convers Francis similarly tried to create order in the chaotic reactions to German theology, asking what would be meant by such an expression as "American theology." 25 In his 1842 review of several theological works, G. W. Burnap referred to the clamor raised on the subject of German theology, which had the orthodox Hengstenberg at one extreme and Strauss at the other, and con- cluded that prejudice should be replaced by a study of the more moderate representatives, espe- cially Schleiermacher and De Wette.26 By 1857, 20 Locke and the transcendentalists, by "F.

Allen, in his review of "Recent German Theology," 27 could express his sadness that a host of obscure names and petty controversies were now occupying the ground where Lessing, Herder, Fichte, Schleiermacher, and De Wette had "waged their high controversy with error or unbelief." To the problem of error or unbelief De Wette applied the historical-critical method. The histo- rian attempts to create an organic whole out of the individual facts or reports that he accepts as valid.28 This step, the imposition of continuity, wholeness, or meaning, is the poetry of history. This poetry of history, which De Wette finds more poetic than poetry itself, is an essential part of his concept of myth. Rather than separate historical fact from tradition, he regards the whole as the sacred poetry of history. He takes exception, therefore, to the attempts of those who recognize nothing supernatural in history by trying to ex- plain everything on a natural basis. But he is not in the camps of the traditionalists, the super- naturalists, or the orthodox. His interest in myth, in mystery, in the very concept of the dignity of man and the dogma of the individual human being as part of Mind and the creative spirit, kept him from joining forces with the rationalists or the naturalists. His concept of myth helped him solve the apparent contradiction between fact and fic- tion. He belongs to the stream of criticism that sees the "symbol" as the very basis of poetry and in poetry the incarnation of spirit. The higher truth of the Bible- the religious idea-he removes from the realm of empirical thought to the realm of poetry. The area of religion exists for him as an essential part of human experience, and the shell of language, necessary as it is, is not identical with it. This part of De Wette's criticism, espe- cially his Beitrag zur Charakteristik des Hebrais- mus (1807), was the source of much misunder- standing and opposition, but it attracted the attention of the liberals, including the New Englanders. His radical approach made De Wette a target for many attacks. His extensive investigations, beginning in the Jena period, on the origin of the Gospels, their relationship to one another, his work on the Psalms, and his comprehensive intro- duction to the Old and the New Testament (1817- 1848), a standard work which underwent many 27 Ibid. 63: 431 ff., November, 1857. 28For some of the following I am indebted to K.

Perhaps his opponents in Germany and in New England had some grounds for their fears. One of the direct results of De Wette's scholarly activities was the signifi- cant impression gained, for example, by Jakob Burckhardt. Son of a clergyman, Burckhardt originally planned to follow his father's profession, but gave this up as a result of De Wette's under- mining of his faith in orthodoxy. He wrote to a friend in 1838: "De Wette's system grows before my eyes to colossal dimensions; one must follow him, nothing else is possible; but, alas, every day there disappears under his hands a fragment of the traditional teaching of the Church." 29 He goes on to mention De Wette's use of myth, but arrives at a conclusion quite different from any De Wette might have expected from his search for truth. With Schleiermacher, translator of Plato and author of the famous Reden iiber die Religion (1799), he wanted to reconcile rationalism and supernaturalism in an approach that included both. For them, Christianity was neither a doctrine of reason nor mere recorded history but a living phenomenon. Their view was still christological, despite the lesson Burckhardt believed to have learned on this very issue. To be sure, ambigui- ties remained-or at least resulted in the opposi- tion of both sides, as in the case of the New England transcendentalists. Although drawn to Schleiermacher, and main- taining for many years a cordial relationship with him, De Wette went his own way. Each dedi- cated a work to the other, and later Schleiermacher visited De Wette at Basel. While both regarded religion as a matter of feeling, De Wette, certainly in his Berlin period, tended more toward a Kantian outlook and Schleiermacher to a Schel- ling-Spinozist view. Schleiermacher was much closer to the romantic movement, to Schelling, Tieck, and the Schlegels, but both sought organic knowledge, a unity in the diversity of perception. Their conception of theology is essentially philo- sophic. De Wette owes to his friend, the theo- logian Fries, an outlook that attempts to combine Kant's ethics with Jacobi's doctrine of feeling in a system that Fries called philosophic anthro- pology: the theory that philosophic knowledge is dependent on the self-knowledge of man. The 29 Quoted by Heller, E., The disinherited mind, chapter on "Burckhardt and Nietzsche," 54, Cambridge (Eng.), Bowes and Bowes, 1952. basis of his system is threefold: knowledge, belief, and intuition-knowledge of things, belief in the eternal nature of things, intuition of the eternal or infinite in the finite. De Wette was opposed to Schelling's natural philosophy, which broke down the difference between subject and object, that is, between the ego and the non-ego or God and creation, whether in the sense of Schelling's "nature" or Hegel's "mind." 30 For De Wette, religion was a matter of both individual conscience and of community. In his Religion und Theologie (2nd edition, 1821) he lays stress on the idea of religious community, hence recognizing historical as well as psycho- logical and anthropological aspects and thereby giving a new validity or at least a new interpreta- tion to older church doctrines as well as pagan myths. In his lectures on the history of religion he relies heavily on Benjamin Constant's De la religion considere dans sa source, ses formes et ses de'veloppements, part of which Ripley was to in- clude in the first volumes of his Specimens. He does not reject dogma, nor does he wish it to be regarded as something complete or rigid. He wants the student to see Christianity in its living form, as it developed, not as it is codified, to apply the genetic method to both Biblical and church dogma. De Wette's contribution in the field of Christian ethics was considerable. For him, ethical laws were not imposed from without but rather some- thing man bears within. About the time of his dismissal from the University of Berlin, or per- haps a little earlier, De Wette underwent a transi- tion from theoretical to practical theology. He was absorbed in the problem of the relation be- tween natural law and Christian dogma. In 1817 and 1818 he had already published essays attempt- ing to analyze the contemporary moral status of politics, science, and art, and to suggest means for improvement. During his stay in Weimar from 1819 to 1822 he began his work on a critical edition of Luther's letters and wrote his novel Theodor (to be discussed in some detail below), the story of the development of a young theo- logian, giving in a sense an account of his own inner history. There was contemporary objection to the mingling of religious and non-religious questions in this novel as well as to specific theo- logical aspects, and the book received a public answer entitled "Die wahre Weihe des Zweiflers," 30 For this reason he opposed, though unsuccessfully, the appointment of Hegel at Berlin in favor of Fries.</page><page sequence="7">382 SIEGFRIED B. PUKNAT [PROC. AMER. PHIL. SOC. apparently by the theologian Tholuck. Since the novel was concerned with more than theological controversy and entered the realm of art and ethics, its literary form aroused interest among the laity as well, and the book went into a second edition. De Wette's interest in the theater re- sulted in an anonymously printed three-act play, Die Entsagung (Berlin, 1823). In this Weimar period De Wette also preached, and considered a call to Braunschweig. While higher authorities in touch with the Prussian government were making difficulties, he accepted instead the proffered chair in theology at Basel. Becoming a Swiss citizen before 1830, he held office on the Board of Education, gave a series of public lectures, helped found a scholarly journal, and presided over the theological faculty. True to his beliefs as indicated in his writings, he could submit to ordination in the Reformed Church (granted by the Church Convention), accept the Basel Confession (1534), and be at home-and remain above friction-in both the Reformed and the Lutheran Churches, again on the basis that religion is a living process more than knowledge of or observance of customs and practices. To him the Church was not a system of concepts but the living community of faith and love. Both at the university and in his public lectures he aimed to declare the truths of Christianity to those whose education resulted in a cleavage between faith and knowledge. The new theology bore Schleiermacher's name because his technique and language were closer (than the genetic-anthropological approach of De Wette) to the speculative philosophy of the age. But this distinction explains the choice of De Wette over Schleiermacher in Ripley's Specimens of Foreign Standard Literature. In his attempt to reconcile science and faith, De Wette's thinking harmonized with the ideal of the New Englanders -the aim of fusing the divine and the human into the true God-man. Like that of the New Eng- landers, De Wette's theology had a strong an- thropological substructure. Like Herder, he ap- proached theology from the human point of view, hence his many connections with philosophy and the arts. Besides a number of poems, the novel and the play already mentioned, he wrote Heinrich Melch- thal oder Bildung und Gemeinschaft (Berlin, 1829). This companion novel to Theodor traces the life and education of a layman in the light of prevailing scientific and aesthetic opinions. Both novels, as Wolfgang Menzel pointed out,31 were written in the spirit of Herder-a reasonable, rational, sensible ethics, against both extreme clericalism and pietism, though Menzel objected to the fact that the spokesman for theological wisdom in Melchthal is a woman. De Wette's reflective and critical mind did not, however, allow much expression for his poetic and creative facul- ties. As a critic, he wrote several articles in the field of literature and art, including "Tragic Poetry," "Goethe's Faust," and "Painting and Architecture." His interests extended to music, Hebrew (in his last years he took instruction in the Talmud from a rabbi), the modern languages, botany, and geology. Although a Swiss citizen, he eagerly followed public affairs in Germany, hoping for its political rebirth in 1848. Liberal in both theology and politics, he warned against the dangers of a liberalism deceived by blind com- mitment to the doctrine of progress. II De Wette's phenomenal reception in New Eng- land focuses on four impressive translations of his works for American readers: the novel Theodor; or, The Skeptic's Conversion (2 v., 1841), trans- lated by James Freeman Clarke; Human Life (a work on ethics, 2 v., 1842), by Samuel Osgood; Introduction to the Old Testament (2 v., 1843), by Theodore Parker; Introduction to the Canoni- cal Books of the New Testament (1858), trans- lated from the fifth edition, by Frederick Froth- ingham (all published in Boston). De Wette was known in New England earlier, however, for he had been given wide publicity through Moses Stuart's Letters to Dr. Channing in 1819 and 1820. This was not Channing's only contact with De Wette. Margaret Fuller tells in her Memoirs of reading De Wette and Herder with Channing one evening a week in the winter of 1836-1837. In his "Fifth Letter" on the "Mode of Exege- sis," republished with the other letters to Chan- ning as the first part of Miscellanies in 1846, Stuart attacked what he called violations of in- terpretation on the part of those professing the Christian religion. There was much less danger, he thought, in outright renunciation of the doc- trine of divine inspiration of the Scripture, his reason here being essentially a practical one: the point of contention is much clearer, and the degree of influence is greatly reduced.

He covers briefly the period from Semler, through Eichhorn, Ammon, Thiess, and others, to De Wette, to whom he gives special attention, singling out for criticism his theories concerning the Pentateuch (later origin than had been be- lieved) and his book De morte Christi expiatoria (Christ's conscious change from moral teacher to prophet to expiator when he was disappointed by his lack of effectiveness in the two first roles). He then continues: Yet De Wette holds a most exalted rank in Ger- many. I doubt whether Germany can boast of an oriental scholar, or literary man, who has more ad- mirers than De Wette. Gesenius, Professor at Halle, has spoken of him, in a letter recently received, in the highest terms; and selects and recommends him, among all the literati, critics, and orientalists, of Germany, as most deserving of special acquaintance and confidence (p. 182).32 By his own and his Andover colleague's corre- spondence with the Germans, Stuart was function- ing as a cultural intermediary, and in his published writings was encouraging further acquaintance with them, although he himself realized "it needs only a moderate acquaintance with German rea- soners and critics (a thing which is fast coming in), to induce young men to go with them . (p. 183). Indeed, he is convinced, as was Chan- ning himself, that no one could read the Germans and ever again turn to Priestley, Belsham, Car- penter, Yates, and Lindsey as critics "but with disgust." He admires their erudition, and ac- knowledges obligations to them, but believes their views to be "fundamentally subversive of Chris- tianity." Stuart recommends them for study, for the good that they offer "in a more scientific man- ner, and in a better digested and more lucid form than I can elsewhere find" (p. 186). This letter to Channing was an ambivalent plea for the study of German writers. Its primary purpose was to bring theological issues to a head. German theo- logians were soon widely read in theological and quasi-theological circles, whether of the shade of belief of a Stuart, a Norton, a Channing, or a Ripley.33 Stuart himself may have read his De 32 Quotations are from the 1846 publication, in Miscellanies. 33 In a postscript written for the 1846 republication, Stuart had the satisfaction of being able to show the Wette all too well, if there is any validity to the remark in George R. Noyes' review of a later work that the Andover professor had chosen the task of proving what had been proved by De Wette and others.34 Soon after his statement that neither German theology nor philosophy had received tolerable justice at the hands of English scholars,35 George Ripley, whom Emerson was recommending to Carlyle that same year as a "very able young man," 36 formulated a plan for the publication of foreign literature, resulting in the fourteen vol- umes of Specimens of Foreign Standard Litera- ture (1838-1842), which Professor Perry Miller recently called an ambitious project "the impor- tance of which has been little appreciated by histo- rians of American culture." 37 He succeeded in interesting some of the younger members of the transcendental group who like him were dissatis- fied with the philosophy of experience as repre- sented by the Locke school and were drawn to German philosophy and theology. Ripley assumed a leading role in the controversy that culminated in Andrews Norton's attack upon German thought. It was Ripley who made the public answer, pub- lished in Cambridge as three letters on the Latest Forms of Infidelity (1839-1840), the last two in reply to Norton's rejoinder to his first letter. These letters contained an enthusiastic account of Schleiermacher and De Wette and a vindication of them as well as of Spinoza, including a correc- tion of Norton's poor translation from De Wette: "a knowledge of German is no merit, but the want of it in those who undertake to expound German theology is an inconvenience." As Weiss re- marked in his biography of Theodore Parker, Ripley's thorough knowledge of the subject gave dignity and value to this controversy. The importance Ripley attached to his plan for a series of translations even before he indulged himself in this direct exchange of views with Nor- ton may be judged by his letter to George Bancroft trend from Semler through De Wette and others to Strauss, with his idea of "moral romance," and finally to Bruno Bauer, with his charge of fraud. 34 Christian Examiner 40: 71, January, 1846, a review of Stuart's Critical history and defence of the Old Testa- ment canon. 35 In his review of Marsh's translation of Herder's Spirit of Hebrew poetry, in the Christian Examiner 18: 167, May, 1835. 36 The correspondence of Carlyle and Emerson, rev. ed., 1: 60, Boston and New York, Houghton, Mifflin and Company, 1884. 37 The transcendentalists, 189.</page><page sequence="9">384 SIEGFRIED B.

For my own part, I could not but be pleased with finding such a forcible defence of views, which I have enter- tained from the moment I understood the import of the philosophical movement in Europe, since the epoch formed by the "Critique of the Pure Reason." The great problem of modern theology, Ripley thought, was to reconcile religion of the letter and of the spirit, the testimony of doubtful tradition with the voice of God within the human soul. He praised Bancroft's philosophic discrimination evinced in his comparison between Penn and Locke: The always ignorant and often petulant idolatry of Locke, which is cherished in our high places of learn- ing, is a dark symptom in the state of culture among us.... You have done a good service to the history of philosophy by shewing the identity of the Quaker principles with the vision of Plato, the psychology of Kant's &amp; the modern Eclecticism of France. 38 Dated Boston, November 6 (1837); MS in Massa- chusetts Historical Society (quoted by permission). 39 Boston, September 20, 1837; MS in Massachusetts Historical Society (quoted by permission). Again he dwells on the importance of under- standing the connections between the principles of American democracy and the liberal theology: It is a cheering sign to perceive the manifestations of a freer &amp; better spirit, among our educated young men of the most promising character, and-strange enough-especially in the clerical profession. Almost to a man, those who shew any marks of genius or intellectuial enterprise are philosophical democrats. New life will be breathed into the languid veins of our liberal Chris- tianity; &amp; with such men as Brownson, &amp; the brave, young writers in the Western Messenger, I almost hope to see the time, when religion, philosophy &amp; politics will be united in a holy Trinity, for the re- demption &amp; blessedness of our social institutions. Like the editors of the Western Messenger, Ripley was fully aware of developments in the- ology in Germany, and looked to them for sub- stantiations of his own way of thinking in the controversy over miracles that was raging in New England. In a letter published in The Boston Daily Advertiser of November 9, 1836,40 intended as a reply to Andrews Norton's attack on Novem- ber 5 in that same paper, Ripley underlined the importance of German theology: As to modern theologians I need not tell you that it is in the country of Luther, that the science of theology has received its greatest developments, since the time of the Reformation. You are aware that every topic of this science has been discussed there with freedom, learning, and strenuous industry. Ripley's motivation in planning a series of pub- lications of foreign works is therefore quite clear. He had found in European literature both a wealth of material that should be made available to Amer- icans and a wealth of evidence favoring his side in the theological battle. This second factor ex- plains the religious character of many of the writers chosen, a feature of which both Ripley 41 and the reviewers were aware. Works actually published in the Specimens of Foreign Standard Literature were Philosophical Miscellanies (Cousin, Jouffroy, Constant) ; Select Minor Poems (Goethe and Schiller) ; Ecker- mann's Conversations with Goethe; Jouffroy's Introduction to Ethics; Menzel's German Litera- ture; Songs and Ballads (Uhland, Korner, Bur- ger, and other German lyric poets); and the two 40In Miller, loc. cit., 161-162. 41 Cf.

But others had been planned: 41a Goethe's Correspondence, a Life of Goethe, Fichte's Destiny of Man, a Life of Jean Paul Richter with selections from his works, Selected Religious Writings of Herder, Schelling on the Philosophy of Art, Selections from Less- ing, the theologian Ammon's Progressive Devel- opment of Christianity, plus one French work, Guizot's History of Civilization. A third work by De Wette was also to be included, his Lectures on the Philosophy of Religion, which Osgood re- garded as the best contemporary account of the history of religion, even superior to Constant's five volumes on the history of the religious prin- ciple, to which De Wette had acknowledged in- debtedness. The undertaking of the Specimens proved to be too ambitious, yet the volumes that were completed form a remarkable achievement. Four of the ten volumes devoted to German thought contain the two works by De Wette. The first, to be discussed below, was the novel Theo- dor (volumes X and XI). The other was Samuel Osgood's translation of Human Life; or, Practical Ethics (volumes XII and XIII), completed in 1841 and published in 1842 "to the memory of Charles Follen." Osgood must have learned much of matters German while he worked with James Freeman Clarke between 1835 and 1837 on the Western Messenger in Cincinnati, after complet- ing his studies at Harvard College and in the Divinity School. By 1838 he published a thirty- four page article on De Wette in -the Christian Examiner,42 an essay revealing first-hand knowl- edge of the German theologian. In this article he suggests the reason for the reception De Wette is soon to enjoy in New England, namely, that De Wette, more than any of the German theo- logians with the possible exception of Herder, was "the most congenial with English readers." He mentions De Wette's pleasing style, common sense, and poetic sensibility. His philosophic sentiment does not lose itself in misty clouds, nor does his scholarly spirit bog down in minutiae. He had been satisfied with neither the forbidding critical system of Kant, the airy ideals of Fichte, nor the pantheism of Schelling. Osgood indicates that De Wette had already become a kind of favorite with English readers, and reports that in Germany the majority of living theologians would rank De Wette as the most distinguished of their number. He is the third of the illustrious trio of Herder, 41a Cf. Christian Examiner 24: 274, May, 1838. 42 Ibid., 137-171. Schleiermacher, and De Wette, and now wears the mantle of the other two. The account Osgood gives of De Wette's life is derived from scattered notices and suggestions from his works. At least by the time he begins the translation, a corre- spondence is under way, an exchange of letters with De Wette that apparently lasted until the latter's death in 1849. On the basis of the novel Theodore and contri- butions to the field of ethics, Osgood considered De Wette a guide in matters of taste in music, poetry, and all the fine arts, as well as social behavior. The American saw great similarities in the problems that faced Theodore and many young New Englanders. De Wette's philosophy, he thought, was more modest than other systems prevalent in Germany, having some features of resemblance to the Scotch. Concerning *De Wette's important work, Uber die Religion und Theologie (1821), Osgood wrote that De Wette had combined the critical system of Kant and the philosophy of faith and feeling of Hamann, Jacobi, Fries, and Schleiermacher into the three-fold modes of conviction: knowledge (empirical, mathematical, rational), faith or feeling (instinct of the heart), and sentiment (resignation, devo- tion, inspiration-the essential elements of religion which are in the soul of man). This German had reconciled the rational and the sentimental schools of moralists, so Osgood later wrote, by making the understanding the means of interpreting sentiment. In 1838 Osgood issued a second arti- cle, twenty-three pages in length,43 on De Wette's views on theology, stressing the principles that would appeal to the more liberal among the Uni- tarians: that the letter is only the dress of the spirit and that facts are to be valued for the ideas which they contain. Accepting De Wette's expla- nation of the doctrine of the Trinity as identical with that of the Unitarians (De Wette saw em- bodied in the Trinity every truth contained in monotheism, anthropomorphism, and pantheism), Osgood did remind his readers that the German found the Unitarian view one-sided and cold." Osgood did more than anyone to introduce De Wette to New England as a philosophical writer by his translation of the Lectures on Ethical Science ( 1823-1824). On the author's advice, the first 43Ibid. 25: 1-23, September, 1838. 44Thirty years later Osgood was himself to become what Perry Miller has called one of the casualties of transcendentalism when he left the Unitarian ministry and took orders in the Episcopal Church.</page><page sequence="11">386 SIEGFRIED B. PUKNAT [PROC. AMER. PHIL. SOC. part is condensed in the form of an introduction and the second fully translated. In his preface, Osgood expresses the belief that the work, by presenting a comprehensive and striking view of life in its various duties and relations, must have a practical value even for those who are not in accord with De Wette's theory of morals. De Wette's strong and earnest humanity, his vindica- tion of the essential rights of man, his sympathy with the various sentiments of the human heart, his taste and imagination, his love for freedom, the breadth of his faith unconfined to dogmas and rites, in a word, a religion that "is as expansive as human life," give this work a rare appeal for the audience Osgood had in mind. A favorable review of Human Life called it an admirable companion and successor to Jouffroy's Survey of Ethical Systems, and added that it manifested the same "clearness of spirit." 45 OS- good had already complained, in a review 46 of Jouffroy's Ethics, which Ripley published in his Specimens, that Jouffroy had said too little or nothing of Jacobi, Fries, and Schleiermacher. But De Wette, whose system seemed to him not unlike Jouffroy's, had in several works given a system of ethics more congenial "to our English sense" than that of any other German philosopher. It does justice to every element of human nature, whether passion, will, self-interest, or reason, and has in addition the merit of applying ethical science to Christianity and of giving a philosophical state- ment of the ethics of the Gospel. In two further articles in 1840 and 1841 47 Os- good discusses phases of De Wette's writings in the field of ethics. By 1844 he could report that De Wette was well known in America both as a moralist and, especially through Theodore, as a theologian. He credits Theodore Parker with being the first to introduce him as a Biblical critic, referring to the fact that Parker led in translating a complete work in this field. In the article 48 on Parker's translation Osgood praises De Wette especially as a sensitive and penetrating critic of poetry, but is somewhat apprehensive of his liberal doctrinal interpretations as well as of Parker's interpolations.

Barnas Sears, editor of the Christian Review, had strong reservations with respect to De Wette's fol- lowing the philosophy of Fries. On some theological questions, however, he too was in agreement with De Wette (cf. his review of Theodore in 6 - 537-557, 1841). 48 Christian Examiner 35: 303-311, January, 1844. iner 49 stress De Wette's readiness to learn spirit- ual lessons from passages that contain only sym- bolic truths, his turning to the essentials of primi- tive faith in the midst of prevalent critical contro- versies, his resisting, unlike Strauss, with whom he coincides on some points, the attempt to ex- plain away all supernatural reality. All this adds up to the conclusion that he is "the greatest Bibli- cal scholar of our age." 50 This enthusiasm for De Wette was shared by Theodore Parker, whose interest in the German theologian probably began in the thirties as a result of his editorial work on the Scriptural Inter- preter. George Ripley, Frederick Hedge, and Convers Francis may have encouraged Parker to pursue his scholarly work on De Wette's study of the Old Testament. Starting on the American edition in 1836, he published it in 1843. This work, and his interest in German thought resulting from his labors with the translation, led directly to the collecting of his remarkable library of 13,000 volumes,51 which Thomas Wentworth Higginson in his report to the trustees of the Boston Public Library called "the richest private library in Boston." 52 Parker was attracted to De Wette's theological liberalism and his critical method, which combined historical and exegetical aspects of criticism. He acknowledged his debt to De Wette's historical and critical methods, and despite their differences in conclusions De Wette remained Parker's favorite guide. It was De Wette's view that if Biblical study is treated in the scientific spirit of criticism, historical investigation in theo- logical questions logically follows. The historical study of doctrine became, therefore, a further object of his scholarly activity. Through his criti- cal edition and creditable translation of the De Wette work, regarded as the most important study of his life,53 Parker was among the first in America 49Which I believe are Samuel Osgood's, 26: 285 f., March, 1844; 46: 326 f., March, 1849. 50 Osgood later described, in Appleton's Journal of 1869 and 1870, some of his personal experiences in Ger- many and emphasized his admiration for the intellectual standards of the faculty at Berlin. 51 According to Dirks, J.

He has been seen as a transitional figure who relied on scholars representing the "mediating" school in Germany, to which De Wette and Schleiermacher belonged, as opposed to the extremes of both orthodoxy and rational- ism. He mediated between the critical approach or scientific inquiry and the emphasis on human consciousness characteristic of the transcendental- ists, and thereby plays a role in the shift from enlightenment to transcendentalism. Parker's preoccupation with De Wette is one factor in the intensification and broadening of his German reading. He did not think that any new observation had been made or any general law discovered in his field by any French or English theologian of his century. Germany, "par emi- nence the land of theological books," he regarded as "the new East out of which the star of Hope is to rise." 54 Hence an antagonistic reviewer of his Discourse of Matters pertaining to Religion (1842) could decry Parker's "terrible array of German artillery." 55 De Wette's critical approach probably contributed to Parker's acceptance of some of the findings of more extreme scholars, as for example a Strauss or even a Bauer, so that in his famous 1841 sermon on "The Transient and Permanent in Christianity" he could say, ". modern criticism is fast breaking to pieces this idol which men have made out of the Scripture." Least of the labor expended on the De Wette text was the translation itself. Parker did not hesitate to make interpolations, both of his own and of borrowings from other German sources, thus add- ing or enlarging individual sections. But the work was made more valuable by the additions, accord- ing to Osgood, who praised the idiomatic English and the adherence to the spirit of the original, at the same time criticizing the excessively liberal interpretation of both De Wette and Parker and the want of greater regard for the unity of revela- tion. Fifteen years later the translation was still commended as Parker's most complete critical work, one held in high esteem by scholars. A reviewer of the third edition (the second having appeared in 1850) extols the original German au- thor's patience, candor, and learning, adding, "his work is much the most serviceable that exists." 56 Soon after the publication of the first edition, Parker had an opportunity to see De Wette in 54 Parker, Theodore, Thoughts on theology, The Dial 2: 485-528, April, 1842. 55 Christian Examiner 32: 394, July, 1842. 56Ibid. 65: 125-126, January, 1859. Basel, a visit described in a letter in 1844 to Convers Francis, his friend and mentor in Ger- man culture and senior member of the New Eng- land Transcendental Club. Parker's account gives many glimpses of De Wette and the life he had accepted at the modest University of Basel in ex- change for his distinguished position at a more illustrious university: At Bale, of course I saw De Wette, a compact little man with a rather dry face, a little irritable, I fancy, perhaps something soured by his long disasters. He had not received the copy of my translation which Mr. Brown was to send him. This grieved me much. He is preparing a new edition still, but with no con- siderable alterations from the last. It will soon ap- pear. During the last time I stayed at Bale, I saw a good deal of him, first and last, heard him lecture, &amp;c., spent an evening with him at a friend's-his wife is away-dined with him at his son's. His functions are not great; he has from twelve to twenty students of theology, and the whole University at Bale num- bers but about sixty pupils! You may fancy that De Wette spends his time more agreeably in the study than elsewhere. But then he has leisure enough to write, and think, and speculate, and print, too. He knew but little of ecclesiastic affairs or theological matters with us. He only knew Norton as one that polemized against him. The light of the seven gold candlesticks, on the back of the academical lectures, had never gladdened his eye. Even Grey's Key was known only by name. Wouldn't it be a good plan for the "Body," as Father Briggs says, to send out-with a lot of Grey's Keys to enlighten the Germans withal? Some of "our excellent tracts" might also be circu- lated to advantage. Pray suggest it. Who knows but it may stay the flood of Rationalism which threatens to leave sundry dogmas where Grotius says the Ark may still be seen? I heard De Wette lecture on the Harmony of the New Testament. He cut right and left and made no bones of saying that such a passage was probably unaicht (spurious), that John knew nothing of it, &amp;c. "Carpenter's Harmony" would set the Professor right on this point. I cannot tell you all the thousand things we talked about in Bale, theological and philosophical. Of these at home. Last year or earlier he went to Halle and Jena, and was received with great enthusiasm by the professors and students at Jena, he made a speech to them, and advised them to study their books, get their lessons, and keep silent. So some one told me, which advice they will keep as well as George Fox the simi- lar advice which some one gave him; but it takes a great deal of soul to bear up well under exile and long misfortune. Yet De Wette has never retracted un- generously anything he has said. The good men, says Ewald, justified him in all his course at the time of his exile, but the journals never dared say one</page><page sequence="13">388 SIEGFRIED B. PUKNAT [PROC. AMER. PHIL. SOC. word in his defence. I think he is a great and noble man. Perhaps no theologian in Germany has more influence at this moment than he. He is both critical and mystical, so seems sometimes to waver, and does lean as one or the other element gets the upper hand.57 Parker's travels in Germany acquainted him with other notables, among them Bettina von Arnim, who read to him from her own work. One month after the letter just quoted Parker wrote about this meeting to Dr. Francis, who would have special interest in the matter since his sister was at the time in correspondence with Bettina. In Heidelberg Parker talked with Paulus about German theology, and reported that Schel- ling had tried to have Paulus' book on Schelling suppressed. From Ewald in Tubingen he heard enthusiastic approval of his having undertaken the task of translating De Wette for the Ameri- cans. Parker continued to correspond with De Wette and other acquaintances abroad, and hence should not have been as surprised as he was that so many people loved him "not only in New Eng- land, but in old England and also in Germany," as he wrote from Europe the year of his death, 1859. In his recollections written that same year he could say that the German language, "hitherto the priceless treasure of a few," had become well known and that a storehouse of the "most origi- nal, deep, bold, comprehensive, and wealthy litera- ture in the world, full of theologic and philosophic thought," had been opened to many.58 Parker's translation of De Wette is a major element in his contribution to the dissemination of German thought in New England. The influence of the German "mediating" school left its mark on all of his writings. Another important work of De Wette's in the field of Biblical criticism was his Introduction to the New Testament, the fifth German edition of which was translated by Frederick Frothingham and published in 1858. This work, too, was con- sidered, as a reviewer pointed out,59 the best of its kind. Frothingham had spent several years in Germany, where he increased his knowledge of German and enhanced his familiarity with German theology. Frederick was not the only one in his family who was concerned with German writings. Nathaniel L. Frothingham wrote a number of 57 In Weiss, John, Life and correspondence of Theo- dore Parker 1: 244-245, New York, D. Appleton and Company, 1864. 58 In Miller, loc. cit., 488. 59 Christian Examiner 65: 140, July, 1858. reviews of German literary figures, including Herder,60 Schiller, and Jean Paul; in theology he was drawn to comment on Herder, Schleier- macher, and De Wette for New England periodi- cals. De Wette's son sent N. L. Frothingham an inscribed copy of Hagenbach's address at De Wette's funeral, which the recipient later pre- sented to the Harvard Library. 0. B. Frothing- ham, in his writings covering many phases of German influence, also did not fail to mention De Wette. Frederick Frothingham's translation came out shortly after the appearance in 1856 of the second editions of Osgood's and Clarke's translations. Thus, there were two peaks in the publication of De Wette in America, one in the beginning forties, the second a decade and a half later. Although the second may be regarded in the main as an echo of the first, it indicates the persistence of an inter- est which even extended into the seventies with a third printing of Human Life and Theodore. Left for final discussion in this study is Theo- dore; or, the Skeptic's Conversion, which gave the most comprehensive survey of De Wette's ideas and had the widest appeal to readers. Published in 1841, the impressive translation by James Free- man Clarke was begun at least by 1836, when the first serial installment appeared in the first vol- ume of Clarke's Western Messenger, in Cincin- nati, other selections following in 1837 and 1838. With the subtitle "History of the Culture of a Protestant Clergyman," the work was then pub- lished in its entirety in Ripley's series. It is the most significant of that group of De Wette's writ- ings which may be called literary, though their purpose was primarily to expound and elucidate theological problems. Of De Wette's attempts at creative writing, the New Englanders knew only Theodore and the poems interspersed in it, but in this novel American readers found an easily di- gestible account of a subject of great concern to many of them, namely, contemporary trends in German thought. Clarke's preface to the translation announces his purpose of making available a sample of the German theological writings that at the time were creating such a stir in America. He saw great similarities in the problems that faced Theodore and the young New Englanders.

It was both a source of information and an example of a philo- sophic mind struggling through the many phases of speculation and doubt-a case of liberal Chris- tianity framed in fiction. Only in the writings of German theologians, Clarke avers, could one find fresh views of the essence and spirit of religion and profound scholarship in criticism, philology, and church history. He extols the life, freedom, and depth of the German mind that contributed to the preeminence of German theology. Although his translator realized De Wette's lack of certain qualities desirable in any form of literary writing, he saw the author of Theodore as a central figure in the current tendencies in German theology and a leading conveyer of German thought. In the light of the American interest in De Wette already evident, Clarke thought no other work of his could more adequately give a general view of De Wette's opinions on philosophy and theology. He also believed that such a book would clarify some of the issues focusing on the transcendental move- ment as well as calm some of the alarms aroused by other excursions into German material.6' De Wette, in his own preface to the second edi- tion of Clarke's translation, states that he had never sought credit as an artist. His sole purpose was to demonstrate that the skepticism produced by narrow and shallow study could be removed by more profound examination. And in a letter included in the preface to the American edition, De Wette wrote to Clarke that he had aimed to give in a freer and more attractive form than a scientific treatise the view of Christianity he con- sidered most valid. He tells of having been under the influence of Schelling, the two Schlegels, and Schleiermacher, and of his search for a theology that "gave more play to the imagination, and more food to the heart, and which shrunk from the coldness of a merely intellectual system," a theol- ogy striving for the reconciliation of faith and reason. His purpose in the novel was always to be a mediator between extremes. Detecting a cor- responding social tendency for every religious 61 Clarke's own indebtedness to De Wette has already been pointed out. Cf. Thomas, J. W., James Freeman Clarke, apostle of German culture to America, 96f., Bos- ton, J. W. Luce, 1949. Theodore very probably inspired Clarke's own religious novel, Thomas Didymus, 1881, which he first intended to publish as a translation from the German. After a correspondence covering a number of years, Clarke on his visit to Europe in 1849 went to Basel but arrived just after De Wette's death. tendency of his time, and stressing the importance of community and a common spirit, he related poetry and art to religion. Among the analogies between literature and theology, he mentions the dramatic school of Iffland and Kotzebue as cor- responding to the theological school of rationalism and the works of Goethe and Schiller to a more transcendental trend in theology. Simultaneously with Theodore's religious development through rationalism, supernaturalism, mysticism, and a leaning toward Catholicism, his views on poetry and art develop or change. In the preface to the American edition, De Wette refers to his own system as critical-aesthetic, a system of which he believed himself to be the lone supporter in the late thirties. As a student of philosophy-his initial appoint- ment at Heidelberg was in this field-De Wette had been forced to come to grips with the rigid moral code of Kant and the naturalism of Schel- ling, the predominant philosophical trends of his time. Schelling's God, who in order to become acquainted with Himself must be shed abroad in creation and in eternal change be destroyed and produced anew, was for De Wette not God but only the constantly renewed life of nature: If all is from and in God, and every thing can be carried back into the same ideality; if the absolute, which appears in all things, is necessarily what it is; and if every thing which now exists belongs to its essence;-then vanishes all distinction between good and bad; nothing is imperfect in the world; every thing is sanctified by God,62 or rather he is desecrated by imperfection (p. 59 63). The idea of a divine will above all change is thereby lost, and freedom is cancelled out, since everything, including God, is subject to necessity. De Wette has Theodore study under a professor of philosophy-Fries, to whom De Wette felt philosophically indebted-who held a middle place between Schelling and Kant and attempted to reconcile the two. Fries' scheme presupposes a primal consciousness-faith-as belonging to the human mind (Schelling's "intellectual percep- tion") and tries to show how this primal conscious- ness is unfolded into a variety of spiritual faculties and how the whole framework of human knowl- 62 The influence of German idealism on such New Eng- land spiritual movements as Christian Science has not been sufficiently explored. 63 All page references are to the 1841 edition of Theo- dore; or, the skeptic's conversion, Boston, Hilliard, Gray, and Company.</page><page sequence="15">390 SIEGFRIED B. PUKNAT [PROC. AMER. PHIL. SOC. edge and experience is based on their commin- gling, through which a world, situated in time and space and subject to the laws of nature, is exhib- ited to the mind. But-and here is the return to Kant-this knowledge is only an imperfect copy of the essence of things, of which the archetypes lie hidden in the primal consciousness. Faith, or Kant's intuition, becomes the only source by which the world can appear as a harmonious whole. Knowledge alone does not lead to full understand- ing of the world. Only feeling and love give things their living meaning. And action completes the certainty of knowledge and feeling. The de- pendence and limitations of the human intellect are acknowledged, and the point fixed where it connects itself with the knowledge of things in their essences. To an extent, the absorption of the particular being in universal being is allowed, but without cancelling out personal existence. By its faculty of faith, the soul possesses a super- natural knowledge above the transitory nature of the world of experience, and thus cannot itself be of a transitory nature. The reconciliation of reason with faith is made possible by ascribing a kind of faith to reason. Hence Kant's understanding, the lower faculty of knowledge, alone can be in conflict with "revela- tion." De Wette's conception of revelation was of special interest to his New England readers, since this was closely related to the core of their theo- logical controversy. Inward revelation he places in the reason. It is the "last, unconditioned ground of reason. . . . The inward revelation is to our knowledge what God is to the outward world. Revelation is our inward God, in which we believe, from which our mind receives life and light" (pp. 79-80). When expressing his opin- ions regarding the connection between external or historical revelation to the internal or natural, he gives the impression made on him-and on Theo- dore-by the performance of Schiller's Maid of Orleans, which is thus established as a source of his views. Internal and external revelation have the same origin, namely, the human soul, in that supernatural knowledge which he calls faith. The internal revelation is faith itself. External reve- lation is a special expression of it. In the inspired person the divine spark that exists in all minds is not quenched and buried, but is fanned into a flame. This heavenly fire strengthens and illuminates all the lower faculties: the will obeys no longer the passions, but only the inward, heavenly impulse; the under- standing receives the godlike light in a pure and unclouded ray, and is not misled by the perplexities of sensual knowledge. In such a mind, human reason is transfigured to the divine reason; or, if you choose, it is brought back to its original purity and perfec- tion; its archetype, grown confused and deformed, comes up again distinct and clear. The seat of all error and immorality is the understanding; which, as the faculty of voluntary consciousness, may sub- stitute, in the place of the pure archetype, a false conception of its own (pp. 94-95). De Wette uses Schiller's play, therefore, to demonstrate at once Kant's distinction of reason and understanding and the contemporary theo- logical application of this philosophic distinction. Clarke feels constrained to underline this passage by paraphrasing it in a footnote in which he says, among other things, that the function of the under- standing is not to see truth but to show the rela- tions of knowledge. Its function is to analyze, compare, infer, systematize. Acting freely in these processes, the understanding is liable to error. Goethe's organic whole, or rather Fried- rich Schlegel's version of it, can be destroyed by analysis, by the conscious mind. Consequently the unconscious mind is superior. In the application of The Maid of Orleans to the question of external or historical revelation De Wette also analyzed what the "image" can do and indeed what "image" means to him in literary and philosophic terms. For when the Kantian reason manifests itself in words and actions, others are forced to discover in it the image of that archetype which resides in all minds. If people recognize in it the truth and goodness of God, they have an external revelation of Him. Thus any person in whom the divine principle predomi- nates over the human is a kind of mediator. This manifestation is more by actions than by words, "for the whole man appears in his action, in which feeling, knowledge and active energy are united" (p. 99). The feelings are more directly affected by the sight of an action than by the sound of words. The image may lead to misunderstanding, as it did Joan of Arc, according to De Wette, when she believed herself to have received inspira- tion from the Virgin Mary. But the worship of the Virgin contains a degree of truth. Joan did not err in thinking herself inspired by a lofty spirit. "Her pure and humble soul, abstracted from earthly things, lost in contemplation, was kindled by the divine sparks which slumber in every human mind" (p. 89). Of special interest to the student of Schiller is Theodore's rejection of</page><page sequence="16">VOL. 102, NO. 4, 1958] DE WETTE IN NEW ENGLAND 391 any implication that the love of the sexes is im- pure. If the human mind is incapable of loving with equal intensity and at the same time two objects, then Joan's love for Lionel must weaken her patriotic ardor. Feeling, in this case love for a nation, can direct the will. For De Wette, feeling is at the very root of the moral law, a prime difference from Kant's system of ethics, which had no place for feeling and which, destitute of warmth and life, belonged to the realm of the understanding rather than to higher reason or faith. The most lasting influence on Theodore-and De Wette-was Schleiermacher, especially his Discourses on Religion, which attempted to define religion and its connections with intellectual and moral life. The book gave him the key to the relation of religion to morality, science, and art. "Science is the existence of things in our reason; art is our existence in the proportion and forms of things" (p. 162). Only as our minds become one with nature, when the finite and the infinite meet, can we begin to possess science and art. Schleier- macher regards the union of the finite and the infinite as the essence of religion. This union he locates in the feeling, placing religious science in the intellect and morality in action. By religious feeling man comes in touch with the infinite, by knowledge and action with the living world. Neither rationalism nor supernaturalism can have any meaning for Theodore, restricted as they are to doctrines, dogmas, abstract ideas. Living feeling, originality of feeling and thought (origi- nality in the sense that the individual himself has the experience), means little to the rationalist, while the supernaturalist has renounced his pow- ers of mind. On the subject of miracles, the central issue in the New England theological struggles of the thirties, Theodore, who cannot regard a miracle as anything in violation of the laws of nature, could give support to Ripley, Parker, and Clarke. In part exaggeration, the miracles are for him the results of a higher knowledge on Christ's part and confidence on the part of those who experienced or beheld them. Since the miracles are seldom reported with historical exactness, they must have been intended more for their moral significance. The writer's view of their meaning, rather than the outward shell, was what mattered. De Wette laid great stress on symbolic meaning. Indeed, he believed that full harmony between symbolic significance and the historical or moral truth of Christianity established rather than destroyed the essence of Christianity, for its true essence lay in faith or feeling, from which proceeded "truth for the intellect, goodness for the active powers, and beauty for the aesthetic sense' (p. 242). De Wette's system presupposes the existence of God in the world no less than above the world. The divine spark in every human being is not nullified by the doctrine that God is the cause and source of all man's power. Man's feeling of con- fidence derives less from mere observation than from active participation in creation, in the rich treasures of life that flow from the inner fountain in the human soul. The problem, therefore, of external revelation, as conceived by the orthodox and the supernaturalists in Germany or in New England, is seen in a completely different light. The Bible is a testimony of faith and not a source for scientific knowledge. De Wette clearly dis- tinguished between the two domains, and decried the restrictions placed by the literalists on personal thought and independent inquiry in the domain of factual knowledge. He challenged both distrust of the power of the human mind and the presump- tion of the possession of factual truth on the basis of literal interpretation of ancient documents. In Biblical criticism itself, in which field De Wette excelled, he valued more the intellectual striving and the influence it exercised on the spiritual condition of the church than the literal results of its investigations: "Its duty is to keep the intellect awake, that it may not yield itself to a hasty fancy, or an easy credulity" (II, 196). The intellect has its limits, but ought always to remain active within those limits. While the intel- lect was no substitute for the essence of religion which was in feeling or faith, the absence of a free scientific spirit in any theology was offensive to De Wette. The following words had special meaning for the liberals of New England: Is, then, the system of Calvin, however highly we may prize it as a monument of his faith and intellec- tual acuteness,-is it the sum of all Christian knowl- edge? Has the Holy Scripture been exhausted by him, so that it is now unnecessary to look into it and search it with a free mind? Has not this theology the stamp of the age in which it originated? And shall this stamp be impressed upon ours, which, in many particulars, has become so different ? (II, 58-59). Though admitting that much error and confusion may have resulted from the variety of theological thought in his time and country, he commended</page><page sequence="17">392 SIEGFRIED B. PUKNAT [PROC. AMER. PHIL. SOC. the intensity of intellectual activity in the realm of spiritual culture in Germany, the search for truth, the desire to educate, the devotion to poetic and artistic beauty. This receptive spirit was not easily found elsewhere, he believed. Many New Englanders were soon to be making similar statements. Art was closely related to religion, for De Wette, and on two levels. A basic tie in his "critical- aesthetic" system was symbolism and its function. The other connection was the appeal to human sensibilities in both religion and art. Through his approach to many of the scriptural documents as poetic statements of faith as well as his own predi- lection for belles lettres, De Wette applied his critical faculties, gaining help from the aesthetic theories of his day, to the function and meaning of literature. Just as he had first sought the moral element alone in theology, so he had conceived the thought, the sentiment, the emotion as the essence of beauty. But through his study of aes- thetics his attention was directed to the "poetic form of the whole," which alone gives value to a work of art and through which it becomes an image of the universe. Turning his attention from Schiller to Goethe, he reread the latter's works numerous times in order to find the meaning of poetic form. He realized, at the very time Ifiland and Kotzebue were still at the height of their popularity, that pathos was not a triumph of poetic art. The aim of poetry was not to move strongly, to give a moral stimulant, but rather to give regard to the harmonious proportions of the emotions which the poet excites. Ifiland's Hagestolz, in which the author assumes the role of a moral teacher, aims to give an unfavorable impression of unmarried life, but for the poet, according to Theodore, it should be a matter of indifference whether his protagonist is married or not. Mar- riage and bachelorhood are situations which may each reveal aspects of human experience. Life in its inmost depth and peculiarities should be exposed, and in a way that lifts the spectator or reader to a height from which he may imper- sonally-and even cheerfully-view the whole scene. The artist, although inspired, must in like man- ner remain a master of his inspiration. Pure aesthetic creation or pleasure is possible only when conflict with personal interests is excluded. Choos- ing Joan of Montfaucon as an example of Kotze- bue's work, De Wette's hero charges this play with extravagance and calculation for effect. The spirit of morality may animate but not dominate art whose goal is living beings, not moral ma- chines. Nor does he approve of rigid categorizing of good and evil. Rather he recommends a free mixture of the two, since the contrast is to a large degree in man's conscience and not in the external world. The poet should not anticipate moral an- swers or predetermine contrasts of good and bad, but leave these judgments free, exhibiting the general and free law of life as it lives in all human convictions. In Goethe one may see how a poet can be moral without breaking artistic unity by tedious moralizing. Since the judgment of good and evil, belonging as it does to the moral under- standing, will depend to some degree on the indi- vidual, it is not suited for poetry, which requires free judgment. The moral judgment is confining, whereas poetry should take us out of and above ourselves. Obviously echoing Schiller's theories and polarities, Theodore states that the highest beauty derives from a perfect unity of body and spirit, of innocence and knowledge, simplicity and richness, humility and courage, seriousness and cheerfulness. Art which merely excites reflection or arouses action may fail to partake finally of the nature of the beautiful. But when pleasant to the contemplation or when satisfying in itself by harmonious proportions giving inward delight, the work of art has through form attained beauty. Variety is characteristic of all phenomena, but when variety is welded into a unity, appearance becomes beautiful. This unity is beyond that of plan, purpose, or design, which merely satisfies the understanding through the adaptation of means to ends, but of a higher kind that acts on feeling rather than the understanding. Like Schiller the aesthetician, De Wette held that whatever pleases in the view of human actions and sentiments, whatever entertains and delights in the representation of human character in art, is always a quality of the soul. And though he did not as clearly distinguish grace from the sublime as did Schiller, he also believed that with- out the aesthetic contrast of beauty and deformity, of good and evil, beauty itself cannot exist. If evil or deformity is given a degree of character and power, they too partake of the nature of goodness and beauty. Ethical beauty and natural beauty have a common basis in that both are manifesta- tions of life. While he does not neglect to suggest that the material the artist chooses should be "pure," De Wette is nevertheless "modern" when he says that beauty arises principally from form:</page><page sequence="18">VOL. 102, NO. 4, 19581 DE WETTE IN NEW ENGLAND 393 What is there in a drop of water, in itself, to gratify the sense of beauty? But when drops of water unite in a stream, it attracts the eye by its calm and clear flow. And when it plunges, as here, from rocks, so as to represent to the eye an animated play, full of form,-a bravely leaping bow, a dance of foaming waves,-when the material, insignificant in itself, becomes, as it were, alive, and full of splendor from its manifold forms,-then we see the full mani- festation of beauty. Beauty is life. But life is in form-in the free, harmonious connection of the material . . . (II, 159-160). Again like Schiller, De Wette ascribed a crucial role to art in the life of man. The chief aim of art is to educate the moral sensibilities, man's moral nature, to be a "ministering servant at the shrine of holiness and religion." Like Novalis in Ger- many and Channing in New England, De Wette maintained that the art of a nation must be deeply rooted in its culture, particularly in its religion. The artist is not wholly free in the choice of sub- ject but should seek inspiration in the culture known to his audience. Penetrated by the spirit of a people, a national art can in turn influence that spirit. Poetry sometimes anticipates life and often loiters after life, but poetry and life exercise a mutual influence upon each other. True art must partake of a popular character, that is, it dwells, as among the Greeks, in the life and man- ners of the people as well as in "the burning words of the bard." At one time it was "a flower which bloomed wild over the fruitful native soil, while with us it is artificially raised in gardens and hot-houses" (I, 230). This whole section of Theodore must have had particular relevance to contemporary American pleaders for a native literature. The essence of the aesthetic is expression di- rected to the feelings of a people, but this expres- sion which moves the soul does so by the percep- tion of beauty. From Schleiermacher De Wette accepts the notion that the world of aesthetics is joined to religion as the latter's organ of manifes- tation, the idea that the beautiful is a manifes- tation of the good. Aesthetic symbols are a means of expressing the religious sentiment. Since the essence of religion is feeling, it can be expressed only imperfectly and to a limited degree. Even less can it be restricted to doctrines and dogmas. The most suitable means of expressing religious sentiments is, then, in poetry and other arts. These give suggestions and images where the real and the final belonging to religion cannot be ex- pressed. Every poem or work of art is, for De Wette, a religious symbol in that it gives us a sensible image of that which sustains the world, and is an image in miniature of the harmonious order of the universe. De Wette speaks of two kinds of religious symbols: mythology, a repre- sentation of the supernatural world by means of arbitrary characters, and symbolism, the sacred emblems and usages peculiar to religion. The latter presupposes an equipoise between form and substance, the free aesthetic form. Not that re- ligious symbols without religious life have much meaning. For Theodore, faith, the religious com- munity, as well as religious symbolism are based on feeling, and hence in a sense related. Every poetic image and work of art is a sym- bol. In the transference of spiritual truths from the doctrinal to the symbolic, De Wette saw two advantages. First, the incomprehensible can be saved from a misleading spelling out and, second, feeling is given a greater chance for warmth and life: It may be stated, as a general rule, that the sym- bolical view begins where the historical ends; and the former is the summit and the flower of the latter. The substance of the story belongs to history, its spirit to symbols. When the substance has been ex- amined and harmonized, it becomes the object of symbolical contemplation. The history of Christ's passion, for instance, is treated historically when the facts are critically investigated, and placed in their actual relation to each other; it is symbolically treated when we see in it the eternal or ideal story of the war which good must wage with evil, the spirit with the flesh, and the perfection and glorifying of our human nature. There are points, too, where history reaches its limits, and seems to tread on the verge of the supernatural world . . . and here the symbolic view alone must take its place (I, 246). When doctrine is insisted upon, the aesthetic view becomes subordinate to the intellectual, a defect-the preponderance of thinking over feeling and the want of the poetic in religious life-which De Wette saw in the Protestant church. For that reason he made his true representative of female piety, in Theodore, a Catholic, since most Protes- tant women at that time were either "cold Ra- tionalists and moralizers or gloomy and austere Pietists." For him the ideal of piety included the imaginative and poetic, aesthetic attributes that helped account for the trend toward Catholicism in Germany in the first decades of the nineteenth century. Superstition must be opposed and under-</page><page sequence="19">394 SIEGFRIED B. PUKNAT [PROC. AMER. PHIL. SOC. standing advanced, but there are "holy places which must always remain veiled in reverential obscurity" (I, 273). The true form of religious expression, he had learned from Schleiermacher, was not in statements of fact but in the symbol or image of that which transcends factual knowl- edge. Underlying De Wette's attitude or ap- proach, is the assumption that a rational view, in its proper light, is not in inner conflict with the religious view. Free research must continue, but be united with a symbolic retention of doctrine.64 Religion, like art and love, has archetypes in imagery and belongs to the imponderable. Theodore; or, the Skeptic's Conversion, though significant for its treatise on the problems of faith and for the aesthetic issues it posed for New Eng- land readers, does not live as fiction. The style is easy and lucid, certainly for a theologian of the period. Yet the characters seldom escape their author's didactic intentions. They remain mouth- pieces or pawns in a game of dialectics. With all its analyses of the role of feeling in art and reli- gion, the book sets up human relationships singu- larly lacking in emotional vibration. The impact of effective fiction is missing. Ironically, the best criticism of Theodore is written into the novel itself in De Wette's penetrating theories on the ultimate artistic failure of moralizing and abstrac- tion unless cast into moving images. On the other hand, the story does demonstrate a degree of poetic sensitivity and a profound respect for the role of literary creation, which explain the author's reputation in his day as a first-rate interpreter of religious poetry. As Samuel Osgood stated in his article on Parker and De Wette,65 the latter was admirably fitted for the office of critic of poetry in all its forms. Understanding the im- pulse of the poet, he added a dimension to Biblical criticism as much in his approach to the poet as to the prophet. In his writings on the Psalms, his views on the rhythms of the lyrics have the merit of originality. Theodore Parker was espe- cially impressed with De Wette's characterization of the Pentateuch as the Hebrew national epos.66 64This aspect of De Wette's thought is discussed in an excellent long essay by Schenkel, D., W. M. L. De Wette und die Bedeutung seiner Theologie fur unsere Zeit, 1849. The copy in the Boston Public Library, once owned by Theodore Parker, has that part checked which indicates De Wette's attitude toward the Bible as a prod- uct of human endeavor rather than a supernatural book or an object of mockery on the part of freethinkers. 65Christian Examiner 35: 303-311, January, 1844. 6,Cf. letter to Convers Francis, March 10, 1840,; MS in Boston Public Library. From the vantage of cultural history, Theodore is an exceptional work, a narrative which reads as well as can be expected in a combination with the skillfully manipulated texture of complex ideas on philosophy, religion, art, and social conditions. In palatable form De Wette offered both a digest of contemporary German thought and a blueprint for cultural progress. III Cultural progress, the improvement of both the individual and the community, was a key-word to the New England Transcendentalists. Whether their attachment to the literature of Germany was a cause or only an effect (as Orestes Brownson maintained), concern for the theological questions inextricably bound up with New England intel- lectual activities was a primary motivating force in turning their minds to Germany. The peculiar task of the theology of the first half of the nine- teenth century, in Germany as in New England, was the problem of harmonizing reason and faith, nature and mind, God's word in creation and God's word in revelation. The path by which many came to the idealism of Goethe and Schiller, or Kant and Schelling, was theology. And of the German theologians none, not even Herder or Schleiermacher, was accorded the reception given De Wette. The reasons for De Wette's becoming so well known in New England may be summarized as follows, no one answer being sufficient in itself: 1. The particular theological complexion of New England at that time, with a large group for whom trends in German thought were made to order. Many New Englanders were on the point of floundering on the issue of revelation and mira- cles, and De Wette offered not only a means of reconciling reason and faith, but demonstrated that he could maintain his faith within the estab- lished church, whether Lutheran or Reformed. 2. The intellectual bent and explorations of the New Englanders. Nowhere did they find greater inspiration or information in Biblical criticism and other areas of theology than in Germany. There they met a highly developed combination of intellectual pursuits and dedication to religion- the use of the critical method and the retention of the basic ideas of Christianity. 3. De Wette's form of liberal theology. He was a moderate in his philosophic and theological views, and represented a balance between Kant and Schelling, between the rationalists and the</page><page sequence="20">VOL. 102, NO. 4, 1958] DE WETTE IN NEW ENGLAND 395 supernaturalists, the orthodox and the liberal. He both sustained his New England readers in their aims and was a vehicle for the information they sought. Balance, moderation, reasonableness were attributes that they missed in many other German writers. In connection with De Wette's liberal- ism, it should perhaps not be overlooked that he was also a liberal in politics, devoted to public affairs, opposed to distinction of rank, and willing publicly to oppose authority for his ideals. 4. The particular quality of De Wette's work, his balance in spirit and style as well as in sub- stance. He was readable from the point of view of the educated layman as well as of the scholar or specialist. 5. The personal mediation of Charles Follen and Charles Beck. Encouraging many of the leading intellectuals of New England in their attempts to form mean- ingful concepts, De Wette's work was the basis of Theodore Parker's greatest single achievement in scholarship. On Ripley, De Wette's effect was immeasurable. Clarke, Osgood, and even Norton, the leader of the opposition to German thought, were profoundly affected by this German theo- logian. And Emerson, who regarded Unitarian- ism as being at once too coldly rational and not rational enough, may have found some comfort in De Wette, to whom Clarke referred in a letter to Emerson as a recognized standard of theological excellence. To other New Englanders interest in De Wette brought a fresh knowledge of Ger- man literature, since repeated American editions of his writings included his fiction, which grap- pled with problems of aesthetics. Interest in German literature was often a by-product of theo- logical concern. Through his offerings in both areas, De Wette quickened American study of another culture.</page></plain_text>
