<plain_text><page sequence="1">Women's Leadership in Marginal Religions: Explorations outside the Mainstream , edited by Catherine Wessinger (University of Illinois Press, 1993) Catherine Wessinger has col- lected essays on women's leader- ship roles (theoretical and actual) in a handful of American groups outside the religious mainstream. The chapters, written by histori- ans, folklorists, and theologians, take a 1980 article by Mary Farrell Bednarowski as their starting point. Bednarowski had looked at nine- teenth-century religious groups for common elements contributing to expanded leadership roles for women. These elements, she found, included (1) the denial of an exclu- sively male anthropomorphic deity; (2) a reinterpretation or denial of the Fall; (3) the lack of a traditional, ordained clergy; and (4) a reexami- nation of marriage and motherhood as the only proper and fulfilling spheres for women. For the most part, the essays in Wessinger's collection revolve around religious groups meeting Bednarowski's four criteria. The groups include Shakerism, Theoso- phy, African-American Spiritualism, Christian Science, New Thought, and feminist spirituality. The col- lection also offers some analysis of three groups that do not otherwise fit Bednarowski's model: Catholi- cism, Pentecostalism, and Mor- monism. Seventh-Day Adventists are excluded even though their prophetess, Ellen G. White, is men- tioned twice in passing. The six-page discussion of Mor- monism confines itself to some women's current attempts to rec- oncile gender roles and theology from within the Church. Unfortu- nately, no historical overview of women's roles in Mormonism is given, as is often provided in the essays examining other groups. All essays accept insiders' theo- logical explanations without ques- tion. No attempts are made to discredit any group's religious claims. Generally, the authors be- lieve that marginal religious groups are more supportive of the idea of</page><page sequence="2">218 BYU Studies female leadership than are the mainstream traditions. This charac- terization holds true even for many of the groups where leadership, in actual practice, changed from reli- ance on a few charismatic found- ing mothers into a male hierarchy. - Julie Hartley-Moore</page></plain_text>
