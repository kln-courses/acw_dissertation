'Reason as Fact and as Fetish, II' [Conclusion of a brilliant paper which comments on the rise of mathematical logic and the " illusion that the upshot of an experiment or a statistical manipulation is a 'fact' revealed, not an event transformed ". The Aristotelian, Newtonian, and logistical meanings of Reason can join forces against the evolutionary or functional. They all rest on acts of 'animal' faith, and their tools are purely linguistic. This is the sole basis of the antithesis of ' theory' to ' practice '. And ' pure' theory was sterile, because its study was "the prerogative of a leisure class ". Modern " descriptions of the world are methods to alter it". It does not find identities but forces upon it identifications, and sees that " if the middle that the law of excluded middle excludes were not continuously bobbing up in the stream of experience " the law would have no meaning.] A. Tonness. 'A Notation on the Problem of the Past-with Especial Reference to George Herbert Mead.' [Distinguishes between the metaphysical and the epistemological problem of Time. Metaphysically the " reality of time is the metaphysical reality of the direction of natural processes ".

[Defends Russell's ' endocephalic ' theory that ' ideas ' are " literally parts of the brain of the percipient " against the attacks of Lovejoy and J. B. Pratt, and criticises their ' epistemological dualism '. The conclusion, however, is that the endocephalic hypothesis is doomed to " drift forever in the logical doldrums with such hypotheses as solipsism, the theory of free will, and: the doctrine of human immortality".] P.

Menard was a Greek scholar who exercised for some years a not inconsiderable influence over Renouvier. They appear to have been at one in politics as republicans and opponents of Napoleon III. Menard's admiration for Ancient Greece found expression in a passionate defence of Polytheism to which Renouvier, too, inclined for some years as being especially suitable for a "republican ". In the second last letter here printed, however, he records his return to a monotheistic position. Menard is also shown in these letters as trying to gain Renouvier's support for his polemic against the belief in "progress " and, consequently, in the cultural superiority of the modern world over the ancient.] L. Brunschvicg. De la vraie et de la faus8e conver8ion (8uite). [The fourth instalment of this long article which, even now, is not yet complete. It continues the confrontation of two antithetic tendencies in European thought, both philosophical and theological, which are here contrasted as "la raison de sens commun " and "la raison de bon sens." The former is identified with the use of abstract concepts, as practised by "Aristotle and Taine ", the latter with the use of analytic relations, as practised by " Descartes and Einstein ". The former is allied to " the illusory experience and the subjective intuition of Roger Bacon and William James ", the latter to the " well-founded experience and the experi- mental conknection of Galileo and Claude Bernard ". To escape the former, it is necessary to emancipate oneself from the metaphysics en- shrined in the grammar of ordinary language. This language imposes conventional patterns of thought which are practically useful but devoid of theoretic truth. Many of the terms used by scientists have two meanings, one in popular language, the other in scientific language, e.g.&gt; "energy ". The scientist has to learn to think in the latter language, e.g., to think of energy in terms of mathematically stateable relationships, even whilst continuing for ordinary purposes to use conventional language. In this instalment, Brunschvieg pursues the contrast between the two senses of reason in a series of polemical discussions directed successively against believers in occultism; Gabriel Marcel; Jacques Chevalier; Gilson's exposition and defence of Thomistic and Augustinian thought; M. Blondel; M. Nabert; and others. Throughout, he combats the tendency to fall back, whether in philosophy or theology, on the super- natural or the transcendent. Always he emphasises that the true con- ception of the spiritual is as immanent, as the reality of the actual; and as the chief representatives of this sort of rationalism he cites Plato, Spinoza, Fichte. Pure philosophy and pure religion are, at bottom, one and the same, and the consciousness of the spiritual in nature can realise itself only in harmony with scientific truth. Thus, e.g., God is to be conceived, neither in terms of anthropomorphic imagery, nor, agnostically, as an indefinable Beyond. God is real in human experience, as Spinoza held, in man's ascent to the consciousness of the All, or Whole, expressing itself in him and in all other things. This consciousness, though it is momentary in time (now present, and then again displaced by other thoughts), is also " eternal " because the Whole, thinking itself in my thinking it, in this relation to itself transcends temporality.] P.-M. Schuhl. Sur le mythe de la politique. [Attempts to remove a difficulty in the interpreta- tion of the fanciful astronomy of Plato's PoliticU8. The world is there said to be first turning around its own axis owing to the impetus which God imparts to it; and, then, after God has ceased to move it, to be turning of itself but in the reverse direction, and " on a very small base ". What</page><page sequence="3">410 PHILOSOPHICAL PERIODICALS. is the meaning of this reverse movement on a small base ? The author explains it by means of the account, in Republic X, of the spindle on the knees of Necessity, and thus ascribes the reverse movement of the world to the unwinding of the torsion imparted to the string. He regards the whole passage as an attempt to convey a rational truth in imaginative, but inaccurate, form, comparable to the similes by which present-day thinkers seek to bring home the theory of relativity to those not trained in mathematical reasoning. In an Appendix, the author deals briefly with Reitzenstein's attempt to trace Iranian influences on Plato's as- tronomy.] Etudes Critiques. L. Weber. Une philosophie de l'invention: M Edouard Leroy. [First instalment of a critical discussion and ap- preciation of Leroy's philosophy. (Incidentally, this article is an excellent foil to the Rationalism of M. Brunschvieg's article above.) Common- sense, Science, and Philosophy correspond to three different points of view, viz., that of bodily action and social relations; that of analytic reduction and rigorous reasoning; and that of synthetic intuition and the inner life. " The time for rationalist superstition has passed ". All creative, inventive, thinking-whatever its results and achievements- is intuitive and wholly different from the reflective thinking which takes the finished results as its data. In the latter, the living impulse has exhausted itself, whereas invention, or inspiration, is the living impulse at work, using what it has made in the past and feeling its way towards what it is about to make in the future.] M.-A.

Syndicalisme et politique en France. [A very well-informed and thoughtful discussion of the impact of Syndicalist modes of thought on contemporary politics in France, including the typically French problem of the relation between the Roman Catholic Church and the " lay " (i.e., secular) State which is based on the ideals of the Revolution of 1789. There is an excellent distinction between liberty as autonomy, as power, and as independence, and the inter-play between its economic and political aspects is kept steadily in view. The author recognises that modern industrial democracy needs expert planning and organisation (" la tech- nique ") if producers and consumers, in harmony with each other, are to obtain the optimum benefits of modern science and machine production. But he emphasises also that the acceptance of the necessary regulation and control by a people of democratic temper is impossible without a strong emotional drive (" la mystique "). For the creation and mainten- ance of so delicately organised an order as modern conditions require " moral forces are indispensable ".]-Reviews of books, French and Foreign. -Periodicals.-Obituary: Herbert Wildon Carr. xxxixe Ann6e, No. 3, Avril-Juin, 1932. L. de Broglie. La representa- tion simultanee des possibilit6s dans la nouvelle physique. [A brief, but illuminating, account of how the formulae of traditional wave-mechanics are re-interpreted in modern quantum-mechanics. In the classical theory of light, as propagated through space in the form of waves in the ether, a wave of light admits of two kinds of " decomposition ". One is " spatial " decomposition which describes the propagation of a light-wave through space by assigning to it at each point in space a determinate function of time, f(t); and the square of that function measures the intensity of the light-wave at that point. The other is " spectral " decomposition which treats a given light-wave as a sum of plane monochromatic waves. Quantum ~~~~~~~M r..nr i.it.thrl of hr 4 ,nnlsr(r"naa tutr</page><page sequence="4">PHILOSOPHICAL PERIODICALS. 411 of light, conceives the " wave " no longer as an actual vibration in an actual ether, but as an abstract quantity (grandeur abstraite) the square of which measures the probability of the presence of the corresponding photon at a given point of space. In general, " the light-wave represents through all its possible decompositions the totality of probabilities relative to the photon associated with that wave ". The same re-interpretation applies to the formulae for the vibration of material particles, e.g., the electron. " For matter, as for light, the wave represents schematically through all its decompositions the totality of possibilities relative to the associated corpuscle." And this correlation of wave and particle can be further generalised into the statement, " To every mechanical quantity (grandeur) which is measurable relative to a particle (corpuscule) corre- sponds a certain decomposition of the associated wave, giving the possible values of that quantity and their respective probabilities ". So conceived, the source of Heisenberg's Principle of Uncertainty becomes clear: the reason why we cannot determine with precision at once the position and the quantity of movement of a particle is that it is impossible for the two decompositions, spatial and spectral, of the associated wave to be simul- taneously simple.] L. Brunschvicg. De la vraie et de la fausse con- version (suite et fin). [The fifth and last instalment of this long article, the sections of which have appeared at intervals during the years 1930-32. The present section bears the special sub-title " Transcendance et Re- ligion ". The " conversion " of which the author has been tracing the nature, now appears quite clearly as the turning of the human mind to a rational understanding of itself and of the Universe of which it forms part, comparable to what Plato, in the Republic, describes as the turning of the eye of the soul to the light. Just as in previous instalments the author had contrasted two antithetic ways of conceiving reason and rational methods of thought, so in this article he contrasts two opposed ways of conceiving the Universe, each of which claims to be " spiritual" and to do justice to the demands of " spirit ". The one, which he calls spiritisme and rejects, construes the Universe as a society of spirits. In theology, it leads to an anthropomorphic God and to insistence on the immortality, in the sense of unending, death-surviving existence, of each human soul or self. The other, which he calls spiritualisme and accepts, finds the root of genuine spirituality in the act of reflection by which the Universe becomes conscious of itself and which, in varying degrees, is realised in man's scientific and philosophical thinking, so far as that aims, in selfless surrender, at grasping adequately the nature of the real. Spinoza's contemplation of the Universe sub specie ceternitatis, and the concept of immortality based thereon, are its prototype. As in previous articles, this view is elucidated by polemical comparisons with opposing contemporary tendencies of thought. In these discussions the author displays his vast learning and his gift for acute criticism. An interesting point is that " life in the biological sense and life in the spiritual sense are oriented in opposite directions ". For the former, knowledge is but a means to survival, for the latter it is an end in itself. On true religion as standing " outside " all historical religions; on what constitutes proof in philosophy; on religion and art; and on a large number of other topics, there are stimulating discussions designed to illustrate the main theme.] J. Laporte. L'attention et le libre arbitre selon saint Thomas (suite). [Continues from the previous issue a carefully documented analysis of S. Thomas's theory of free-will, leading to the affirmation that "we are masters of our acts because we are masters of our judgments; we are</page><page sequence="5">412 PHILOSOPHICAL PERIODICALS. masters of our judgments because we are masters of our attention " (The next instalment, it is to be hoped, will explain what is meant by being "master of ' one's attention, for obviously the whole problem lies in the assertion that " the will has the power to give or withhold attention ".)I A. Dorolle, Les formes du rai8onnement. [The traditional distinction between deductive and inductive reasoning has been shown, by common consent among logicians, to be without foundation. Reasoning is the act by which one passes from one belief to another with the consciousness of having grounds for this passage. The essence of the process, from the logical point of view, lies in discovering or establishing an identity between differences, i.e., in " assimilating " the differences to each other in this sense. Hence, all fundamental forms of reasoning must be classified according to the way in which this assimilation is effected. This yields two main types, viz., linear assimilation, or deduction; and assimilation of bundles or groups of characteristics, or analogy. All reasonings reduce to one or other of these two types.] Etudes critiques. J. Renauld, L'eauvre de Gustave Belot.

Describes the general features of his metaphysic and calls attention to certain points in which it differs from that of St. Thomas. His Aristotelian- ism is influenced more by Avicenna and Alfarabi than by Averroes, and has thus a Neo-Platonic infusion. This comes out, e.g., in his language about God as a universal intellectus agen8 and the presence of a certain forma inchoativa in " first matter," and in the doctrine that the " rational soul " is contained inchoative in the " sensitive ". Though he anticipated the Thomist denial of the presence of " matter " in the angels, and the formula that the composition characteristic of spiritual substances is that of quid eat with quo eat, he did not arrive at the clear Thomist identification of this distinction with that of existence and essence.] A. Fauville. L'asMociationiame moderne. [Associationism, though often declared to be dead, is constantly being resuscitated. The author discusses in par- ticular the views of E. L. Thorndike, as an example of associationism founded on elaborate experimentation interpreted by statistical methods. It is claimed that such research proves that all learning by experience pre- supposes an identical mechanism in all cases, and that we can formulate rigorous " quantitative laws " of the process. An examination of the methods employed by Thorndike and others leads to the conclusions that (1) the process of learning by experience tends to the establishment of an automatic " mechanism ", (2) the starting-point of the process is a condition of consciousness which is very different in different cases. (e.g., it may be the perception of an association or of a logical connection) ; the presence of these qualitative differences in (2) shows that such experi- ments in the process of learning in men and animals yield no knowledge of the real character of " intelligence ".] A. de Poorter.

[Largely critical of Gilson's treatment of the question whether there is, strictly speaking, an Augustinian philosophy. The writer's view is that Augustine's own " philosophy " is really a speculative theology, since its avowed object is the understanding of a Credo. He has not a philosophy distinct from this theology and it is a mistake to suppose that there can be a " Christian philosophy."
