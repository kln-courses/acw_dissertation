<plain_text><page sequence="1">F linn, John, Le Roman de Renart dans la littérature française et dans les littératures étrangères au moyen âge. Toronto: University of To ronto Press, 1963, pp. xi + 731. $ 5.00. This vast compendium of Renardiana has two purposes: 1. to review all versions, adaptations, translations, etc., of this masterpiece of medieval French literature, and 2. to show the development of its satirical character, already present in the first branches. Emphasis is given to the later branches, reworkings and foreign imitations, where satirical, moralizing and didactic elements become preponderant. Concomitantly, the author follows the rise and fall in popularity of the Renart epics by means of all traceable allusions, references and quotations in medieval literature, as well as in sermons, treatises, folklore and proverbs. He is also interested in the semantic development of Renart-goupil, and, espe cially, in the endowment of this animal protagonist with various symbolic values (ruse, hypocrisy, the incarnation of evil). (Chap. I) This world of animals, where contemporary situations are easily recogniza ble, is presented in the French versions (renart en romanz) in twenty branches composed by as many authors. In view of our present state of knowledge, the folkloric element not having been properly investigated as yet, Flinn prefers a chronological arrangement of the branches to one governed by the logical suc cession of events (Table by Foulet, p. 17). He then discusses various views on the origin of the epic (Grimm, Sudre, G. Paris, L. Foulet, Graf, Van Mierlo, et al.); he himself considers the epic as essentially clerical and satirical. Both the comical and the satirical are based on travesty and parody, the latter touch ing on society as well as literature (chanson de geste, roman courtois). This is most apparent in Branch II, where the Hersent story ridicules the love of Tristan and Yseult, and of Launcelot and Guinevere. The author of this branch is so well informed about contemporary events that some of the animals have been identified with historical figures : Messire Chameau — the Papal legate, Pierre de Pavie; Nobel — Louis VII (?). Branch II (with parts of Branch V added to it by Foulet) is most similar to V and XV. In V Renart appears as the prototype of the faux dévot; XV satirizes the clergy; III is essentially comical; IV incriminates the monks most disrespectfully; XIV is a parody of the mass; I is a masterpiece, in chanson de geste style, of royalty, clergy and public affairs (the Second Crusade); interestingly, the lower strata do not fare better, which bespeaks the clerical origin of the epic; IX is anti-feminine; X (R. médecin) anthropomorphic and moralizing; VI, also strongly mysogynic, mentions pape lardie for the first time in connection with false devotion; XII relates, in a Norman setting, personal experiences of its author, Richar de Lison, thus the story of the curé-chasseur, and, most importantly, the Fête des fous·, XIV is, with the bell incident, a parody of parodies and refers to abuses existing at Vol. VI, No. 2 119</page><page sequence="2">L'Esprit Créateur the time; VIII (pélérinage de R.) is directed against the crusades; VII contains a violent, defamatory and obscene attack on the rapacity, arrogance and cyni cism of the nobility, which are exceeded only by the outrages of the monks of Corbie, who are more sinful than Renart himself; XI alludes to the Third Crusade in form of a parody of the Chanson de Guillaume; IX is diverting, with its story of the trompeur trompé; XVI shows contempt for the peasant; XVII (Mort et procession), unsparing in obscenities, especially in the death vigil, vilifies the Church and the customs of the time; the later branches, XVIII-XX, are based on Latin sources and have Isengrin as a main actor; XXIV pretends to be an introduction to the whole epic. To prove the satirical and critical character of the branches, Flinn offers quotations from works of contemporary authors (Moralia of Martin de Braga, Remède d'amour of Jacques d'Amiens, Vie des set dormanz of Chardri, etc.), where the epic is treated either as frivolous fiction, or as a work whose success is to be deplored. Never theless, all medieval authors (Gautier de Coincy, Benoît de St. Maure, Alexan dre de Bernay, Jean de Meung and even Charles d'Orléans) seem to be extremely familiar with it. Flinn reminds us that, in the Isopets, the names of animals and their attributes were replaced with those given them in the Roman de Re nart. By comparing a fable from the Romulus with the corresponding passage from Renart Flinn specifies the contributions of the French poets to the original apologue. Allusions to the characteristics of Renart — ruse, perfidity — and to those of Isengrin — stupidity, violence, thoughtless cruelty — are manifold in contemporary sources on both sides of the Loire, and may even be found in the Catalan troubadours. The analysis of the branches confirms Flinn's own thesis that the apparently comical is always satirical, and strengthens the view of Faral, who first noticed the transformation of an animal character into a symbol of Evil and Hypocrisy (Chaps. II-III). Chap. IV deals with the sirventes and other satirical poems composed by Philippe de Novare at Cyprus, where he stood in the service of the Ibelins, whose struggle with Frederic II and his vassals he described in the form of a new Renart-branche. In this ferocious satire of the Cyprus war, which he later incorporated into the second part of his Mémoires, parallels with original Renart branches (I, VI, X) are easily discerned. In Chap. V, Flinn attempts an interpretation 01 Kuteoeui s Kenan ic tses tourné, using Ham's edition with the corrections made by Faral. Following the latter, he maintains that the poem was inspired by les faits du jour, thus by the drastic economy at the court of Louis IX, instigated by the mendicants, which inconvenienced Rutebeuf personally; by the decrees of the Council of Paris (1261); by the unfortunate intervention of Pope Alexander IV into the purely French affair of Guillaume de St. Amour. Rutebeufs hostility towards the orders, which is manifest in other poems, leads to equating Renart with hypo crisy and regarding his epithet bestourné as meaning "métamorphosé vers l'esprit des moines." Other identifications with contemporary characters (Fran ciscans, lacobines, lesuits) and with persons immediately surrounding the king are also considered. Chap. VI discusses the Couronnement de Renart, which Flinn, in agreement with other critics, describes as a "symbolic fable with a historical background." 120 Summer 1966</page><page sequence="3">Reviews Written most likely by a clerk in the household of Guillaume de Flandre it alludes to the latter's death, which occurred under suspicious circumstances, and was intended as a warning to Guillaume's successor not to let Renart triumph. The episodes of this work are taken from the old stock: R. disguised as a grans clers appears at the court of Noble whose death is imminent and, through his ruses, assures himself of Noble's succession. He receives hommage from the lords, travels to the Holy Land, visits many countries teaching renardie wherever he goes. In a bitter tone, the poet describes conditions in Flanders: the rise of the urban patriarchate, the exploitation of labor by the cloth mer chants in good favor with the French king and with the orders. Another Flemish political satire disguised as a Renart story, Le Menestrel de Reims, refers to the strife between Jean d'Avesnes and Marguerite de Flandre, and the interference of the French. In Chap. VII, Flinn describes J. Giélé's Renart le Nouvel which allegorizes the old branch material, sometimes in their smallest details: Orgueil — the cor rupt aristocracy; Maupertuis— a palace of perdition; the six princesses — six vices; Renart's boat — the world steered by a corrupt clergy, etc. The poem is inspired by Robert de l'Omme's Miroir de vie et de mort, Raoul de Houdenc's Songe d'enfer and similar works, and especially by the Tournoiement d'Anté christ. Renart is here the root of all evil. Of interest are a new anecdote deriding royalty (Noble's amorous adventure with dame Harouge), the treatment of the Fortune-theme (she is here an agent of the devil and not a collaborator of Providence) and forty intercalated love songs with musical notation. The narra tion shifts from fable to allegory and is submerged by digressions. Giélé, who is still an orthodox believer, wants to show how the old feudal society has been corrupted through the examples of a clergy depraved by pride, ambition and cupidity and has allied itself with the forces of evil. Flinn recognizes a general historical background but does not admit identifications of the prota gonists with historical figures. Chap. VIII is devoted to Renart le Contrefait, the most complex and volu minous of the Renart epics, and the last one in France. The story is used as a vehicle for divulging the author's vast knowledge and sometimes subversive truth. In spite of confusion, incoherence, lengthy digressions and frequent repetitions, the 40,000 verses offer a vivid picture of the epoch. The character of Renart lacks unity, since he appears both as a tricky animal and a mouthpiece of the author with regard to the problems of his time. The work is, as a whole, bourgeois in spirit, anti-clerical, mysogynic, and informed from many sources. The last branches of this monumental production are short stories incorporated into other works (Livre du roi Modus, the ballads of Deschamps). There is a great gap between the Middle Ages and La Fontaine, the latter's sources being still contro versial. The eighteenth-century revival of Renart is effected through the Flemish reworkings (Chap. IX). in ins nrsi conclusion rnnn reneraies nis tnesis or tne growth ot the satirical element from the first to the last version, of the symbolic character of the key animals, especially of Renart and renardie, reminding us that satirical literature was, in the Middle Ages, one of the few outlets for animosity and dissatisfaction (Chap. X). In Chap. XI, he considers the influence of the Roman de Renart Vol. VI, No. 2 121</page><page sequence="4">L'Esprit Créateur on moralizing and didactic literature, on sermons and predication. In Chap. XII, he discusses the popularity of the epic in Italy as shown by two versions, one in Franco-Italian, Rainardo e Lesengrino, the other in Medieval Latin prose, published by J. W. Muller, with the French title, Renart dans la chancellerie (Leyde, 1910), and reprinted in the appendix of his book. In Chap. XIII, he deals with the Alsatian poet Heinrich der Glichezaere who was the first to unite all Renart stories into a homogeneous work, his Reinhart Fuchs. In Chap. XIV, Flinn takes up the two Flemish versions, Reinaert de Vos and Reinaerts Historié, which acquired greater fame and were of greater influence on all later Renart literature than the French epics. One of the many German translations of the Historié was to be the model of Goethe's Reineke Fuchs. Flinn remarks rightly that the tone of the Alsatian and Flemish poems is "sombre et un peu sinistre" whereas the French epics are always gay and playful. In England (Chap. XV) Renart became known through Eude's stories, through Caxton's translation of Reinaerts Historié, and through one of Chaucer's most famous stories, the Nonne Ρ reestes Tale. Flinn ends his very comprehensive analysis of Renart material with a three page conclusion, which may be best summarized in his own words, describing Renart as "une figure populaire et bien plus réelle que les créations allégoriques, Fauvel et Faux Semblant, l'incarnation de la ruse et de l'hypocrisie, deux aspects du mal dont l'existence posait au monde médiéval un problème aigu et an goissant."
